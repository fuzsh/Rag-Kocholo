        "text": "Nina Hustedova Appeal\n\nThe daughter of our dear friend, Birger Husted, lost her life in tragic circumstances in Prague on Friday, 6th November, 2020. Our deepest and heartfelt sympathies go to Birger and his family.\n\nNina's life dream was to build a senior home with a kindergarten. When Ninaâs grandmother died in Denmark, she and her sister Anna worked over the summer helping in the local retirement home. Nina was very impressed by the kindness, care, love, and opportunity for senior citizens to have a decent life in the facility and wanted to build a senior home that would operate on similar principles in their home country of Czech Republic. Unfortunately, Nina left us forever, so this dream cannot be fulfilled by her. But it can be fulfilled for her.\n\nNina's family together with closest friends would like to enhance and improve senior living in the Czech Republic by initiating a senior home concept whereby senior citizens will find understanding and love, where there will always be things to do and where everyone will find their place and dignity. The family are presently studying the best way to launch this concept and will share further details in the coming weeks.\n\nOur club would like to support the family to make Nina's dream come true. This dream describes in the best way what Nina was like. It is a dream that the family want to spread as much as possible among as many people as possible.\n\nNinaâs family have decided to start a collection in her name with our support, so that she can continue to help others. You can make a donation HERE.\n\nA Facebook page has also been set up where updates will be posted.\n\nDisaster Aid Europe Sky Hydrant Appeal Albanian Night\n\nThe Disaster Aid Europe Sky Hydrant Appeal Albanian Night was a great success last Friday 28th August, with the Albanian Ambassador to the Czech Republic, Ilirian Kuka as the Guest of Honour. We were so lucky to have our District Governor Nominee George Podzimek as our Master of Ceremonies â he was marvellous.\n\nWe had 55 people and 4 children come to the evening â programme attached; it was a great turnout! However, we had many more donations from those who could not attend, both due to Covid and other commitments, as well as from our Club Fun Evening fund raiser Curry Night.\n\nThe Albanian Night was a very enjoyable evening at the International Hotel in Prague 6 (outside until the rain came!) with delicious Mediterranean food, beer, wine, soft drinks ; fantastic mood music provided by a violinist and musician/singer Roberto Caporali, and Stuart provided an exhibition of the Sky Hydrant and other DA Europe information. There was also terrific Tombola and Auction (attached prize list). And the Ambassador with his wife stayed and enjoyed the event until 22.00. In fact most did not want to leave even at 22.30!\n\nDisaster Aid Europe, a project of this club (RC Prague International) raised over 100,000czk during this evening! an amazing result and so A BIG THANK YOU to all sponsors of the Auction and Tombola, and above all A BIG THANK YOU to all who either donated through a ticket purchase (700czk from each ticket sale was a donation) or sent a donation. The proceeds of the evening were based on ticket sales (as stated before, each participant paid a ticket price which included an amount to cover the cost of the evening plus also a donation), an auction of 5 prizes and a Tombola of about 37 prizes. The leading Auction prize, donated by RC Durres, Albania, Disaster Aid Europeâs partner in DAEâs work in Albania was 5 â 7 nights hotel stay for 2 people in either Hotel Kitarrat or Hotel Arvi, Durres, Albania and this was won by one of the DAE Trustees and member of our Club (Immediate Past President), Fernanda Escobar Illoldi! Congratulations!\n\nDisaster Aid Europe thanks all of you (DAE member, RCPI members, friends and family) who contributed to making the evening such an enjoyable success!\n\nIncluding other donations plus a final âtop upâ of 248euro from our own RCPI club, Disaster Aid Europe Sky Hydrant Appeal has now achieved its target of 5,000euro! So soon the purchase of a Sky Hydrant will be made, sent from Disaster Aid Australia direct to Albania, and then Stuart Amesbury, a DAE Trustee and RCPI member will travel to Durres help the RC Durres team to install it at a University facility, hopefully in October!\n\nYou can see the full album of pictures HERE\n\nThank you again everyone!!\n\nIrena Brichter\n\n\"Thank You\" from SANANIM\n\nThe SANANIM Gala, organised by our very own Naomi, was a great success and raised substantial funds for the charity who thanked us in a delightful letter:\n\nOur Dearest Naomi & David, all members of RCPI, volunteers, friends,\n\nWe sincerely thank you for once again absolutely perfect and heartfelt organization of the best-of-the-year event dedicated to SANANIM !\n\nThe 29th SANANIM Anniversary Gala at Zlata Praha was indeed splendid, as always. We can't thank you enough for all your efforts, as we fully realize that the organization is highly demanding.\n\nThank you for bringing together such an amazing group of people, brave and mature enough to support our non-popular topic. Even after the five years, it is hard for us to believe, that thanks to you, so many people are willing to help our cause. We may repeat ourselves, but it is still very rare. You and your friends are totally unique in your attitude, personal values and generosity. Thank you for bringing these values to the Czech Republic!\n\nThank you for keeping the Gala night amusing, warm, entertaining and so pleasant for everybody. Your long term support means for all of us in SANANIM more than can be expressed by words. Please, do stay with us, we will do our best to nurture our friendship forever.\n\nThank you ! We are looking forward to seeing you and your friends soon !\n\nAn Ambassadorial Visit\n\nDr Christoph Israng, Ambassador of Germany to the Czech Republic joined Members and guests at our club meeting. Dr Israng explained the importance of the relationship between Germany and the Czech Republic in a number of dimensions. \"In trade, the volumes are greater than those traded with the Russian Federation\" said Dr Irsang, emphasising that the Czech Republic is a key partner of Germany not least because of its 815km long border. Dr Israng commented that in some areas there is always room for improvement, not least in logistical matters of ambulances or snowploughs crossing the border - here we can make things more efficient.\n\nDr Israng also reflected on the historic relations of the countries starting with the 16,000 people who sought refuge in the West German Embassy in Prague in 1989 as they sought a way to a new and free life in the West which they were granted. Dr Israng invited Members to join the \"Festival of Freedom\" on the 28th of September where, 30 years later, the Embassy will open its doors and events of 1989 will be remembered.He also did not shy away from discussing the impact of the second world war. \"I have visited many places where atrocities were committed including Terezin. I have met the families and survivors of the atrocities and whilst I understand that some cannot forgive, many recognise that the Germany of today is a changed country. These are the most emotional experiences of my work.\"\n\nRCPI President Josef Simpartl thanked Dr Israng on behalf of Rotary Club Prague International for his insightful and interesting account.\n\nRCPI at DOX\n\nRCPI member Helena organised a truly exclusive tour of DOX, the Centre for Contemporary Art in Prague. Members and friends were greeted by Michaela Silpochova (Head of International projects) and were then joined by Leos Valka - the Director and founder of DOX which opened in a converted factory in Pragueâs HoleÅ¡ovice district in 2008. Today Leos serves as its director and chairman of the board. In 2011, based on a nomination by VÃ¡clav Havel, he received an award from the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic for long-term merit in the area of fine art.\n\nMichaela guided members to the recently opened theater and performance auditorium which is one of the newest and best equipped contemporary spaces in Prague for performers to perform. A tour of the current exhibition called HARD TIMES was given another dimension by Michaela's explanations of the many factors which influenced the artists and exhibition. Then on and upward to Gulliver's Airship which is a realtively new addition to the exhibition and interpretation spaces of DOX. Constructed of wood the airship leaves the visitor with a sense of marvel at the structure and a feeling of an open space whilst being enclosed. A masterpiece.\n\nThe tour was followed by conversation, food and of course a few drinks in the cafe at DOX where a reception had been specially prepared for us. Many thanks Michaela, Leos and of course Helena.\n\nIf you missed the trip please do consider making a private visit to DOX to experience the art and spaces for yourself. Membership, both personal and corporate is available and goes a long way to sustaining this truly unique art space in Prague.\n\nYou can view all the pictures of the visit HERE\n\nA thousand postcards for charity\n\n\"I did not choose to become an artist - art was my escape\", said David Sandum when he spoke to Members and visitors at our recent RCPI club meeting. Our own member, Martin Sebek, introduced David and has himself been involved in assisting the Art Project which David presented. Following a very successful career start in IT the demands of his job, on the heels of many years of stress, took a toll on his health, and he fell into a severe depression. It was during this difficult time that he began to draw and paint, inspired by Edvard Munchâs philosophy that we should all write or paint our life story.\n\nIn 2010, David earned international acclaim by founding Twitter Art Exhibit, a social media initiative whereby artists from around the world send hand-painted postcards that are exhibited for local charities in need of funding. This annual event has gone global, taking place in such cities as Los Angeles, Orlando, and New York City. The 2017 exhibit in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, attracted more than 1,000 artists from 65 countries. The 2018 exhibition is in Canberra, Australia.\n\nThe project is growing every year and the volunteers managing it are very stretched in terms of their time. David asked RCPI members to consider how TAE could move to the next level of operation. \"It is not just about money, it is also about ideas and suggestions from people in business and other walks of life\" said David. You can find David on Twitter: @DavidSandum\n\nHelping Stroke Victims\n\nJ an DohnÃ¡lek from the charity ICTUS came to our recent club meeting to explain how ICTUS is helping those who have suffered a stroke. \"Many stroke victims find their condition has dramatically changed their life so much so that they cannot see a way forward\" said Jan, \"ICTUS is there to guide, assist and show that it is absolutely possible to approach life after a stroke with a positive attitude and through therapies to bring joy and a positive view of the future\".\n\nICTUS is a well established charity which works with stroke victims throughout the Czech Republic through a large network of volunteers and professionals providing many different services. \"from a listening ear and a friendly visitor to swimming lessons, outings, ICTUS is there to help those with stroke live fuller lives and explain that the situation is far from hopeless\" explained Jan.\n\nOne of the activities Jan focused on as especially beneficial are the swimming therapy sessions where volunteers work with those who have suffered a stroke to restore movement, build muscles and above all develop self confidence and a sense of achievement. The sessions cost just CZK 150 each and a course of ten sessions can truly make a difference. However finding the funding is difficult.\n\nRCPI Member Marie JehliÄkovÃ¡ presented Jan with a donation of CZK 36,000 which Marie and others raised through a number of golf events. Jan was, needless to say, delighted.\n\nYou too can help by making a donation which will fund swimming lessons. Just click on the donation button below or go to our special donation page for Swimming Lessons for Stroke Victims.\n\nâHi, I am Gary Powers, the son of Gary Powersâ\n\nOn Monday October 10, we had the visit of Gary Powers junior, whose father was the pilot of the U2 spyplane that was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960, who was captured and subsequently exchanged for a Soviet spy who had been apprehended in the U.S. Gary made a great presentation about the event, which would also define his own life, the historical context including some myth busting, showed video and photo material. The event has been captured both in various books and in the recent movie Bridge of Spies (the title referring to the exchange that took place over the famous Glienicker Bridge between Berlin and Potsdam). Much more importantly, Gary has made it his lifeâs mission to educate the public, and especially the âyoung publicâ, all over the world about the Cold War, the historical context, the circumstances that led to it and how it came to sustain that delicate but dangerous balance for so long. He has worked with both private and public, educational and commercial institutions, museums etc. in the Americas and Europe. He is now on a trip through Europe, with official invitations to Prague, Berlin and Warsaw.\n\nFollowing his presentation, lively discussions evolved to which many participants contributed their observations and personal memories of the time of the Cold War, obviously from both sides of the former Iron Curton. How important it is to keep the memories of that period alive and not leave it to the history books!\n\nAn Actor Calls\n\nBob Boudreaux joined Rotarians and friends at our meeting this week as our guest speaker. Bob started his career in the US military, however decided that addressing audiences was more his thing and, after leaving his post as a helicopter flight instructer, took on a post as television news reporter and anchorman. After 13 years as Channel 13 news anchor, it was a chance meeting with Guy Roberts at the Huston Shakespeare festival which changed his career direction once more and Bob joined The Prague Shakespeare Company where he has continued his acting career.\n\n\"Shakespeare in English language is not a new idea.\" said Bob, \"After the plague struck in England all theatres were closed whilst those in central Europe remained open. A number of actors traveled to Bohemia in order to make a living and brought with them English language Shakespeare\".\n\nBob enthralled the audience with an explanation of the cadence of Shakespeare \"10 beats a line - just like the human heart when spoken\" and the background to a production which Bob is producing which has a very personal connection: Man of La Mancha written by Dale Wasserman. Bob told the audience that this play was the career tipping point for him from flight instructor to actor. \"I saw the play whilst on a short leave from the services. It just captured me as it has captured audiences ever since. A play within a play within a play. A story of transformation which is as applicable now as it was when first written. It is all about recognising the good in others and transforming.\" Our very own RCPI Member, Linda, has recently published an interview with Lane Davis who start in the production.\n\nMan of La Mancha plays from the 6th of October in Prague.\n\nBob is a former Rotarian and Paul Harris fellow.\n\nA home for families\n\nGabriela Selinger and Pavel Kholl joined our recent club meeting to present the work of SKP HOPO, StÅedisko kÅesÅ¥anskÃ© pomoci HornÃ­ PoÄernice, the Christian Aid Centre which provides accommodation and care for displaced families. Gabriela explained how easy it is to fall into a poverty trap and how families are often separated in the process of being placed in the social system, SKP HOPO differentiates by offering accommodation for entire families so that the family unit remains together at this crucial time of stress and change.\n\nOver 3000 individuals have been helped by the centre since its founding in 1999, with around about 80 people in residence at any one time. The foundation has been restoring and adding to the large historic castle in Praze-HornÃ­ch PoÄernicÃ­ch which was used as an orphanage from 1927 to 1947 and then underwent a series of ownership changes including nationalisation.\n\n\"There are many stories of people who need help due to being made homeless\", said Gabriela, \"some are due to a series of incidents which build up over time and result in a family loosing its home. It is out mission to assist and help through housing and other means to put these families back on their feet.\"\n\nThe maximum stay for a family at the foundation is one year as dictated by Czech law. Club members asked Gabriela and Pavel many questions and if you would like more information about the work of the foundation please contact Gabriela by EMAIL.\n\nRCPI helps Canine Rescue\n\nMembers of Rotary Club Prague International, along with ZdenÄk StÅÅ¾ek, owner of Bejzment Burger Pub and also the promoter of the Jack Danielâs BurgerFest in Prague, visited PsÃ­ Ãºtulek TrÃ³ja to deliver several large bags of quality dog food and a pet carrier. This donation came from the proceeds of RCPIâs participation in BurgerFest 2016.\n\nPsÃ­ Ãºtulek TrÃ³ja is the city-owned dog shelter for Prague, and cares for 120 or more dogs at any moment, with sometimes more than 200 dogs coming through the facility in a single month. In 2016, the shelter cared for more than 2,000 dogs, and the Prague animal protection service reached the milestone of having processed the adoption of 80,000 animals (dogs, cats and others) since it opened in 1993.\n\nDogs end up at PsÃ­ Ãºtulek TrÃ³ja for various reasons. Some are stray dogs found wandering the Prague streets, often because irresponsible owners abandon them. Most come from owners who, for different reasons, no longer can or will keep a dog. According to Mr. Marcel KovÃ¡ÅÃ­k, a very skilled and caring dog attendant, who provided a complete and informative tour, most dogs are left by people who are going into retirement.\n\nWhen a dog arrives, it is checked for fleas, ticks and other parasites, washed, and given a thorough examination by a veterinarian. Any medical conditions that can be safely and effectively undertaken to bring a dog back to good health are performed.\n\nThe dogs are housed in various sections of the facility according to size â small, medium and large â and dogs who have been outside for most of their lives are provided with comfortable shelter in outside pens. Very aggressive dogs are housed separately from the main population until such time as they lose their aggression through training and good treatment.\n\nAll dogs at the shelter are on offer for adoption, and stay until they are either adopted or their health collapses. âA dog may be here for three hours or for three years,â Mr. KovÃ¡ÅÃ­k explained. The shelter does not put animals to sleep unless they can no longer live a good life.\n\nDog are not the only animals kept at PsÃ­ Ãºtulek TrÃ³ja â the shelter also gets an occasional pig, sheep, horses, exotic birds (including the peacocks witnessed on the property), quite a few snakes and lizards, and more. But not cats, which are kept at another facility, Ãtulek MÄcholupy.\n\nAs you can imagine, it is not inexpensive to take care of more than 100 dogs and other animals every day, while also giving tours, promoting adoptions, and sending officers out to catch abandoned animals. When Zed StÅÅ¾ek suggested PsÃ­ Ãºtulek TrÃ³ja as the designated recipient of the funds that RCPI would generate at BurgerFest, we were very happy to cooperate. Our ability to generate those funds was made greater when Mr. StÅÅ¾ek offered to let the club participate at BurgerFest without having to pay the participation fee, since RCPI is also a non-profit, with all-volunteer staff.\n\nNearly half of the RCPI members participated during the 2-day BurgerFest event, organized by co-chairs Christian Noll, Mamun Hassan and Casey Holt. Everyone enjoyed the days and the event, and the RCPI board has voted to make participation in it one of the clubâs annual efforts. We are welcomed by Mr. StÅÅ¾ek and BurgerFest, and now that the logistics of being burger vendors have been worked out, we look forward to raising even more money for a good cause in future years.\n\nSananim Gala Evening.... SUPERB!\n\nThe annual SANANIM fundraising gala evening was once a gain a great success. Great company, great food and great entertainment made a perfect evening for over 100 guests. The evening was dedicated to fundraising for SANANIM, a charity, which provides services in the area of prevention, treatment and re-socialization of non-alcoholic drug addictions. SANANIM has a number of different programmes including an Outreach Program where the primary goal is to find the risk users of injected non-alcoholic drugs directly in the streets, to protect them (and, at the same time, the healthy population that is in everyday contact with them) from infectious diseases, to motivate them keep them in the best social and medical state possible before they decide for abstinence.\n\nThe 26th Anniversary Gala was supported by many companies and individuals who gave donations and their time to make this event such a success. \"This event is a superb example of the generosity of individuals, companies and clubs.\" said Naomi Sullivan-Callender who coordinated the event. \"Everyone came together to increased the awareness of SANANIM and their work as well as raising a substantial sum for the organisation\".\n\nThe final amount raised by the Gala event will be revealed in a ceremony where a cheque will be presented to Sananim.\n\nSee the pictures in the RCPI ALBUM\n\nThe 25th Anniversary Gala was supported by many companies and\n\nindividuals who gave donations and their time to make this event such a success. \"This event would not have been possible without the support of so many individuals and organisations\" said Naomi Sullivan who coordinated the event. \"We have not only increased the awareness of SANANIM and their work but have also have raised a substantial sum for the organisation\".\n\n- See more at: http://rotarypragueinternational.org/Stories#sthash.B5uWcfjK.dpuf\n\nA word from the District Conference\n\nOn a fine May weekend a number of RCPI members traveled to Ostrava to take part in the Annual District Conference. Expecting a rather dull official occasion I am sure that they would all agree it turned out to be an interesting and amicable experience.\n\nDespite most of the travelers arriving too late to attend an extraordinary theatre performance where live actors mingled with life-size puppets (I was told that it was amazing) the Friday evening continued with a late-evening buffet snack after which some of the die-hards decided to explore the Ostrava city centre night-life. Many continued their Rotary old-friend-reunions & new-friend-introductions into the small hours of Saturday.\n\nAn independent sight-seeing program had been organised for accompanying attendants who did not take part in the Rotary Business part of the Conference. The Saturday morning was dedicated to dealing with administrative & Rotary related business issues. Delegates listened to presentations and voted on some key issues for the forthcoming Rotary year.\n\nThe Saturday afternoon provided a colourful excursion into the artistic virtues of the RC Exchange Students presenting the cultural background of the nations they came from. Often one could not but stand in awe how well they had mastered then difficulties of the Czech language in the course of their 12 month stay sadly coming to end. This year we accommodated over 95 of them with a number exceeding a hundred planned for next year, we were told.\n\nAfter a great meal based on the Czech cuisine, the Saturday Gala Evening took off with music & dance. In the foyer small & large groups were to be seen enjoying conversations over snacks & drinks with the intermixing exchange students adding international colour. The wide-screen TV´s turned on silent showing a high-pressure World Championship ice-hockey game between CZ & Latvia added the final spicy topping as both local as well as international hockey enthusiasts followed the score swing from one side to the other.\n\nFor those who did not have to leave early on Sunday a guided tour of the revitalised industry zone of Vitkovice was organised, an event generally underlining the simple fact that Ostrava has over the recent years made progress towards transgressing from a drab grey industrial agglomeration into a modern centre of business & industry, all suited for a good quality of life as well. Certainly still some way to go but you can already see the difference.\n\nThe event let me take away a strong impression - a District Conference of this sort is an experience that is always nice to attend if you like interacting with Rotarians, no matter if it is serious Rotary business or just being among like-wise minded friends.\n\nRotary International President K.R. Ravindran visits Prague\n\n\"Ravi\" Ravindran and his wife Vanathy met with members of the Czech and Slovak Rotary Clubs in Prague yesterday. Ravi addressed the Members and explained his vision for Rotary and some of the changes he has implemented which will be carried forward by future Presidents. Ravi and Vanathy have been traveling throughout the world, visiting 43 since his appointment in July 2015 and spending only 11 days at home, in Sri Lanka since then. He explained that this was his way of 'giving back' for the tremendous opportunities and friendship Rotary has given him since he joined at the age of 21.\n\nRavi urged members to engage more with the many youth exchange students in order that they become Members themselves and contribute to doing good for the world and enjoying further opportunities in Rotary. He went on to explain how he, in the role of RI President, contributes to Rotary and gave many examples where his leadership and interventions have brought about good. However Rotary is about the 1.2 million members who are active across the world, doing good. \"Operating with transparency and a business oriented approach is the way Rotary will thrive\" said Ravi as he gave examples of how concepts from business have been successfully adopted. \"Finding funding is no issue if you have a great idea and present it well, explaining the benefits for all concerned\" said Ravi, reciting how he raised millions for schools in Sri Lanka following the 2004 tsunami by involving large corporations at a local level.\n\nRavi hands over the reigns of the RI Presidency to John F. Germ at the end of June 2016.\n\nDoing Good Beyond the Grave: District 2240 recognizes its first Bequest Society Member\n\n“When the new Czech civil code was introduced I realized that it was time to make a will. Reaching 70 years of age encouraged this thought too. I also had the idea that after taking care of my children and grandchildren, I wanted to leave a permanent legacy of doing good in the world,” says Gerry Tipple of Prague International Rotary Club. “The Rotary Foundation gives us all the opportunity to establish such a legacy by making a commitment to the endowment fund. So I finalized my will to include a gift to The Rotary Foundation. The gift will establish an Endowed Fund for Basic Education and Literacy. This means that the income from my bequest will be used to support education and literacy grant projects around the world. People that know me know that I’ve been involved in educational projects in India for several years. The fund I have created will continue to support educational projects, designed and implemented by Rotarians, long after I am gone.”\n\nGerry’s decision represents a milestone for District 2240, as he is the first Rotarian in the Czech Republic and in the district to become a member of the Rotary Foundation’s Bequest Society. The Bequest Society honors individuals or couples who have made commitments in their estate plans of US $10,000 or more: globally, more than 11,250 Rotarians have already made this commitment. With a gift or commitment of US $25,000 or more to the endowment, any Rotarian can establish a personalized fund to support the area of focus of the donor’s choosing. Last year, the endowment fund provided more than US $10.7M in support for Rotary Foundation programs.\n\nDuring his presentation, Gerry asked members of his club: “How many of you have taken a look at your finances and written a proper will? Do you know what will happen to your money after you are gone? If you haven’t already thought about the legacy you will leave, I encourage you to do so soon. You don’t have to be wealthy to be philanthropic, and it would be natural for you to consider The Rotary Foundation as a means to achieving your goals. Prague International’s motto is ‘Having fun doing good,’ but research has convinced me that ‘having fun’ is over when we die. However, we can all continue to do good beyond the grave through our Foundation.”\n\nA presentation on Czech inheritance law and tax is planned for club members.

The winner was team \"World Class\" with a final time of 51 seconds to cover the 200m course. Rotary Club Prague International would like to thank everyone who participated, supported and helped in the oragnisation of the event which has raised hundreds of thousands of crowns for good causes.\n\nThis event is not just about the dragon boat racing, although that is the most exciting part of Prague’s Dragon Day. It is also about raising money for local charities that do invaluable work in supporting and helping those in need. It’s a unique opportunity for companies and organisations to get their brand and their name attached to the great causes that are being supported and to raise their profile. Our 2016 main charity partners are Å½IVOT 90, an organisation providing a wide range of services for senior citizens and Nadace Naše DítÄ who offer much needed help and support for many children in very difficult circumstances. A particular vote of thanks goes to Peter Klima and the Czech Dragon Boat Association for allowing us to use their boats and set-up on the day. Without this the day would not be possible.\n\nThe full results list is available HERE\n\nYou can see more pictures of the event by clicking HERE\n\nSocial Clinic - a passion for improving lives\n\nBarbora Janeckova visited Rotary Club Prague International and motivated the Members and friends with a passionate presentation about a topic she has been involved with for many years. Helping those who require psychotherapy, however do not have access to the services of a Psychotherapist due to financial or social reasons. it is difficult, if not impossible to obtain psychotherapeutic treatment in the Czech Republic without resorting to private financial means. However on many occasions early intervention can make all the difference before someone slides into a dark place resulting in a spiral of catastrophic consequences.\n\nBarbora recounted one incident of a man who was attacked on a tram. He was not hurt, however lost the confidence to travel by public transport. As a result of this he was absent from work, the consequence of which was that he lost his job. Not being able to pay the rent meant that he lost his apartment and became homeless and so the spiral continues. Luckily The Social Clinic managed to help and with a small number of therapeutic sessions he overcame his fears and is now back at work and living in a new apartment.\n\nThe Clinic is funded entirely by charitable means, starting with the donation of their time by a team of over 52 therapists and augmented by donations from the public and other organisations. \"Funding is our major issue\" said Barbora \"the State does not provide these services and because we cannot bear to see people suffering needlessly we founded this charitable organisation\".\n\nMore information at www.socialniklinika.cz\n\nHappy Birthday Gerry!\n\nRCPI met for a very special occasion this week: Gerry Tipple's Birthday, and a special one at that. Over thirty Rotarians and Friends attended a combined Christmas meal and celebration of Gerry's birthday. Gerry recounted some of the events of his early life including how his mother named me after Geraldo of 'Geraldo and his Concert Orchestra' fame, as he was on the radio that evening. \"Geraldo's real name was Gerald Walcan Bright. I guess I'm lucky not be called Walcan - especially as my father's name was Wallace\" said Gerry with a smile.\n\nIn line with the theme of birthdays Rotarians enjoyed the quizz based on 'can you guess who this is.... aged 4'. Some Rotarians have not changed a bit. The Barcelo served a delicious fare of roast duck, traditional dumplings as well as a variety of other courses followed by super puddings. Another quiz had Rotarians debating what are the ingredients of famous cocktails and how many Olympic medals the Czech Ice Hockey team has won.\n\nGerry kindly sponsored the food and wine and Members contributed to our Indian School project with a generous 21,500 Kc with still some more to come. It's a great contribution that will ensure we send the promised 80,000 Kc (200,000 Indian Rupees) as part of our Indian Food Helps Programme that will provide a lot support to the education of poor rural children in Rajsamand.\n\nThe evening was also the one where we all wished Ben Ivory farewell as he and Maureen return to Chicago. Ben has been an active member of RCPI for a number of years whilst working on an international assignment for Graebel. Of course we never say good-bye since Rotary is a great family and we already look forward to Ben and Maureen visiting us again. Ben did offer to host RCPI Rotarians in Chicago so book your slot!\n\nRotary is about doing good and having fun. Our meeting was a perfect example of fun, friendship, celebration and raising funds for good causes.\n\nA very Merry Christmas from Rotary Club Prague International!\n\nPhotography by Natalie Rajska\n\nLetter from the District Governor - Dec 2015\n\nDear Rotary Friends,\n\nChristmas is just round the corner.....\n\nMany of you have given generously. Bodo Hauswald, president of RC Bratislava Danube has told me of his club’s support of 3,650 EUR for Slovak volunteers who work as ambulance volunteers. Many individuals and clubs support Rotary projects. Rotary punch (mulled wine) and other drinks waft through numerous market squares and shopping centres with the proceeds already designated to specific causes. Sincere Rotary thank you to you all. Rotary is not only about finance. Support and work for Rotary and for our communities cannot always be counted financially. Organising trips, special evenings, normal club activities and help to the disadvantaged is all part and parcel of club life. And so also for this activity, I sincerely thank you.\n\nAs a small gift to our not so computer literate Rotary friends, I have arranged for the input of missing club officials onto the RI database! Presidents and Secretaries of clubs now have the opportunity, after logging into: https://www.rotary.org/myrotary/en/, to edit their members‘ details, and before the end of 2015 to in put all elected officials for the Rotary year 2016 - 2017, including the Executive Secretary position ï. At the same time as reminding you of club elections, I wish to remind you to nominate Rotarians for the position of District Governor 2018/19 (instructions and form is attached).\n\nDuring my club visits, I have been asked about the fate of the publication „Opava Rotarian“ , which many received and then for quite a while it did not appear. I have good news for you; the Opava Rotarian lives again: http://1drv.ms/1IL9JmF\n\nI would like to wish you all and your families a wonderful, peaceful and enjoyable Christmas season, and much good health and energy in the New Year, as well as great friendship within clubs and during multi club gatherings across the District.\n\nAnd don’t forget to be „A gift to the World“\n\nYours,\n\nVladimír Adámek\n\nRCPI presents cheque for 250,000 CZK to Sananim\n\nJiÅí Richter, Executive President of SANANIM received a cheque for CZK 250,000 from Rotary Club Prague international at the recent club meeting. RCPI member Nelly Jenicek together with JiÅí Richter explained the work of Sananim and some of the extraordinary successes the charity has achieved in the 25 years of operation.\n\nRCPI club member Naomi Sullivan-Callender co-organised the fundraising gala to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Sananim which was not only an outstanding evening of celebration but also raised such a significant sum for the charity. JiÅí thanked RCPI and Naomi in particular for her exceptional efforts which made the event possible.\n\nFounded in 1990, SANANIM is now one of the largest non-governmental organizations in the Czech Republic that provides complex services in the area of prevention, treatment and re-socialization of non-alcoholic drug addictions. The 25th Anniversary Gala was supported by many companies and individuals who gave donations and their time to make this event such a success.\n\n\"We have not only increased the awareness of SANANIM and their work but have also have raised a substantial sum for this amazing organisation\", said Naomi Sullivan-Callender, co-chair of the event. “It was a thrill to experience such a dynamic and exciting event. It’s an honour to work with our friends at SANANIM to celebrate their great success. This event would not have been possible without the support of so many individuals and organisations.”\n\nThe other stars were all our guests who bid for auction items and pledged donations with great verve and generosity.\n\nPictures of the event can be viewed HERE and of the cheque presentation HERE\n\nLetter from the District Governor\n\nDear Rotary Friends,\n\nIn my last letter I informed you of news that there were 2 cases of child polio in the Ukraine. Our friend RasÅ¥o MaÄar from RC Ostrava City sent me clarification and comforting news which I wish to share with you:\n\nDear Governor, dear Vadimir,\n\nI would like to follow up on your recent District Governor letter no. 3, which spoke of the infectious child polio. In my professional capacity, I focus on infectious diseases, vaccines and Epidemiology, and further more I travel to Africa and Asia on medical humanitarian missions, so I follow very closely the process of eradication.\n\nJust a few days ago, the World Commission on Child Polio Eradication Certification confirmed that the virus of the contagious child polio type 2 has definitely been eradicated from our planet.\n\nThis means that there remain two last virus types: 1 and 3. Til now, the last occurence of type 3 was in Nigeria in November 2012 and type 1 is circulating only in 2 countries of the world: Afghanistan and Pakistan. Unfortunately there, armed terrorists have fired on vaccination healthcare workers and some have been killed.\n\nThe recent cases of child polio in the Ukraine were caused by a weakened vaccine from an old generation of live vaccine applied by spoon into the mouth, a method not used in our country anymore. These cases were not an occurence of the wild polio virus, which happily no longer exists in Europe, and there was no epidemic. In this geographic area, the solution is to use non-live vacine as we do in our country or to increase the vaccination rate (still using the traditional method – by spoon)to pre war levels.\n\nThe eradication certification of type 2 polio virus means that there is no longer a need to vaccinate against this type and to change triple strength vaccine (OPV 1,2,3) to a double strength (OPV 1,2).The future eradication of the last 2 types would be a great success for the human race, which would mean the deletion of vaccination against infectious child polio from the vaccination chart in all countries of the world. As we all know, this has only happened in the case of one disease – dangerous true smallpox (varioly).\n\nIt is expected that total eradication of the remaining 2 types of poliovirus will be achieved in the next few years and it will be a great success for the whole Rotary movement.\n\nI mainly wanted to point out that in the Ukraine, we are not talking about a real epidemic of child polio cases even though the clinical cases created by the weakened virus vaccine could have further serious repercussions. There is no danger of a great epidemic even though there is a civil war on going and there is no change in the European status of the eradication of poliomyelitis.\n\nSincere wishes,\n\nRasÅ¥o\n\nDoc. MUDr. Rastislav MaÄar, Ph.D., FRCPS\n\nOn the occasion of World Polio Day (23rd October, 2015), we are asked to make a contribution to The Rotary Foundation because for this Day, as an exception, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will triple, not double a matching contribution. Individual as well as club contributions can be sent directly to www.rotary.org (at the same time informing our Finance Chair, Vladimir Jandik) or to the District account (account number is on page XIV of the Rotary District Directory, VS is the RI club number with the specific symbol 99).\n\nOn 23.10.2015 at 23.30 you have watch a direct broadcast from World Polio Day on: http://www.endpolio.org/worldpolioday.\n\n„...........the unpleasant Syrian refugee situation is the lithmus test for world compassion.........“ says General Secretary Rotary International John Hewko. „ Rotarians throughout the world are deeply affected by this migrant crisis which is now developing in many parts of the world“ which the UN have stated is the worst crisis in recent history. „Rotary is following the situation carefully, says Hewko, we know that our members have a natural desire to negotiate, as well as lessen the suffering and uncertainty of these families and people. We ask you to act as Rotarians have acted in more than 100 years..... use your professional knowledge and experience, your contacts and mobilise your local communities to offer the appropriate help and financial means to resolve this humanitarian crisis.\n\nRotarians can donate money to alleviate the suffering to RI partners like ShelterBoxhttp://shelterbox.org/. This organisation works together with other agencies so that they can distribute help in the required areas. ShelterBox is also working with communities in Greece to offer help to the homeless migrants.\n\nOur friend Jozef Klement from RC Zvolen has created a challenge to our clubs. Assistant District Governors will be in touch with clubs to let them know more about this challenge.\n\nAs the month of November is about focus on support and help through The Rotary Foundation, with our donations to the TRF, we are helping the needy.\n\nBe a gift to the world!\n\nYours,\n\nCelebrating in style - SANANIM 25th Anniversary Gala\n\nThe gala was a tremendous success and not only celebrated Sananim's 25th year but also raised substantial funds for the charity. Over 140 guests attended at the Intercontinental Hotel in Prague and enjoyed a delicious meal prepared by award winning chef Pavel Buchwaldek and danced the night away. JiÅí Richter, Executive President of Sananim made a passionate speech thanking the guests for their support and stressing the importance of the work of Sananim. Founded in 1990, SANANIM is now one of the largest non-governmental organizations in the Czech Republic that provides complex services in the area of prevention, treatment and re-socialization of non-alcoholic drug addictions.\n\nThe 25th Anniversary Gala was supported by many companies and\n\nindividuals who gave donations and their time to make this event such a success. \"This event would not have been possible without the support of so many individuals and organisations\" said Naomi Sullivan who coordinated the event. \"We have not only increased the awareness of SANANIM and their work but have also have raised a substantial sum for the organisation\".\n\nAn auction of donated prizes was held during the event and raised tens of thousands for the charity. Two etchings by the famous artist Martin Sladky have also been donated and are now available for auction. Click HERE for more details.\n\nThe final amount raised by the Gala event will be revealed in a ceremony where a cheque will be presented to Sananim.\n\nSee more pictures by browsing the RCPI Photo Gallery\n\nAn excellent collection of pictures is ready for you to view on SNAPFISH\n\nA very special letter\n\nIn 1938 Sir Nicholas Winton (1909 - 2015) and a small dedicated group evacuated 669 children from Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia in an operation which later became known as the Kindertransport. Sir Nicolas died peacefully at the age of 106 in 2015 and to commemorate his life the Czech Post Office issued a commemorative stamp.\n\nSir Nicholas lived in Maidenhead in England and as a gesture of international fellowship Rotary Club Prague International has sent a letter together with the commemorative first day cover bearing the stamp to the Rotary Club of Maidenhead where Sir Nicholas was a member.\n\nDear President Tony and Members of RC Maidenhead,\n\nAs a symbol of our international Rotary fellowship, we are pleased to send to you, a first day cover of a special stamp issued by the Czech Postal Service which commemorates your distinguished former member, Sir Nicholas Winton. We know that you are aware of the extraordinarily high esteem with which Sir Nicholas is held in the Czech Republic and you should also know that he remains an inspiration to us here as well as Rotarians everywhere. At a time when refugees are again high on the agenda, it is perhaps more appropriate than ever to remind ourselves of Sir Nicholas’s example. You may also like to know that at our meeting on the 3rd September we toasted your club with our usual international Rotary greeting:\n\nTo all of you there, from all of us here,\n\nIn Moravian wine and good Czech beer.\n\nFrom beautiful Prague, a Rotarian cheer!\n\nOur very best wishes to all of you.\n\nBest regards,\n\nThe Magic Box - A box of magic\n\nThis weeks meeting of the Rotary Club International Prague was very well attended with over 20 Rotarians and Friends coming together to meet, enjoy a meal, discuss, listen and learn. And learning was very much the theme of the evening as Jaroslev Vesely and Ilona Babkova introduced the members to the Magic Box. Sometimes the most successful inventions go right back to basics and this is what the Magic Box has achieved. With this entirely Czech invention Jaroslav has recognised that young children learn best in groups and do so whilst interacting playing on the floor. It's just natural. So, he invented a machine which projects an image of an interactive learning game onto the floor. Children absolutely love the concept - playing in groups on the floor whilst learning through interactive multi media. The Magic Box is just that, a box on wheels so that it can be moved from one classroom to another and be ready for action in a matter of seconds.\n\nMembers asked lots of questions and Ilona and Jaroslav explained not only the concept but also how they are expanding not only in Czech republic but also world wide with Magic Boxes now installed in Australia, Canada, Russia and the Middle east as well as throughout Europe.\n\nInevitably the funding of the purchase is a challenge for many pre-school organisations however Jaroslav explained that teaches, once they have seen the Magic Box and have used it in a classroom are absolutely convinced that it significantly enhances the learning experience for children.\n\nStars all around us....\n\nDuring the meeting of 6 August 2015, RCPI’s band of natives and aliens (many of the club’s members are not Czech nationals) enjoyed a presentation by Dr. Martin Pauer.\n\nIn addition to being Project Manager at Rockwell automation, and a lead ringer of the bells at St. Vitus cathedral, Dr. Pauer is, by training and avocation, a geologist and planetary geophysicist. He is also a volunteer at the Štefánik Observatory on PetÅín Hill in Prague, where several RCPI members and friends had already enjoyed the benefit of his assistance with gazing into the night sky through the observatory’s telescopes.\n\nDuring an engaging and informative presentation that lasted well past our usual 20:00 meeting close, but which kept all but a couple members and guests glued to their chairs, Dr. Pauer provided a PowerPoint tour of the Sun, the planets and their moons, sprinkling in little tidbits of information that came as a surprise to most, including the fact that our moon “wobbles” a little as it rotates, so we actually see about 60 percent of it during the course of a month.\n\nAttendees also learned that all moons but one orbit their planets in the same direction the planet rotates - counter-clockwise. But Triton orbits Neptune in a retrograde - clockwise - fashion. Venus also rotates clockwise, the only planet to do so; and Uranus rotates on its side relative to its travels around the Sun!\n\nVery interesting stuff, and you can see Dr. Pauer’s slides here:\n\nhttps://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=961D161A48C42C4E!4549&app=PowerPoint&authkey=!AP2YecxWbwYI_74\n\nYou can also take a trip up to the Štefánik Observatory any night before 23:00 to take a closer look at the heavens yourself. And look for news of a future presentation by Dr. Pauer about the bells at St. Vitus. Perhaps we’ll go watch he and his friends ring them!\n\nOn a bicycle at 4am in Prague in midsummer.... they must be Rotarians!\n\nThe Rotarians set off this morning on the Midsummer Dawn Cycle Ride around Prague. Despite a little drizzle of rain, the spirits were high as the group wound their way through the streets of the city visiting significant landmarks along the way such as Vysehrad Castle, Old Town Square, The Å½iÅ¾kov Television Tower, Prague Castle, Petrin Park and many more. The drizzle ceased half way through the ride, spirits rose and the pace quickened.\n\nAt 5am on a Saturday morning the city is quite different from the buzzing tourist metropolis which it will become again just a few hours later. The last party goers are on their way home, there are few cars about and those which are navigating the streets are mostly taxis taking home the revellers who started their fun many hours before on Friday evening. The early dog walkers are out as well as of course the deliveries bringing fresh produce to the cities hotels and restaurants. As we ride there is a light scent of rain on cobbled streets, blossom opening and the occasional whiff of freshly baked bread emanating from the many bakeries which have been busy throughout the night.\n\nAt 8:30 the ride returns to Mala Strana and we enjoy a hearty breakfast at Cukrkávalimonáda who have opened their doors especially early for us on this occasion. Petr has organised a quiz and the riders, strengthened by food and coffee, complete question, solve riddles and identify pictures with a prize at stake. We also raised 6000 Czk for charity along the way!\n\nA big thanks goes to Petr Smejcky for organising the event. If you enjoy this kind of event and want to find out more, come ans join us at one of our regular Thursday evening meetings. Everyone is welcome.\n\nMozart, Canaletto, Bruegel.... all in Prague @ Lobkowicz\n\nRCPI was privileged to have Veronika Wolf as our guest speaker. Veronika was invited by our very own Casey Holt who introduced her as the Director of one of the most beautiful, fascinating, extensive and indeed hidden gems in the city of Prague.\n\nVeronika is the Director at the Lobkowicz Collection which is housed not only at the Lobkowicz Palace, Prague Castle, but also in a number of castles throughout the Czech Republic. In a delightful visual tour, Veronika took the assembled Rotarians through the treasures of the collection which go back many centuries. She spoke of the tremendous efforts to bring the collection together once again after the Velvet revolution and the task she as the Director has now to maintain, restore, catalogue, interpret and display the thousands of artifacts.\n\nRotarians were fascinated by the account of the Breugel paintings and of course the most famous Canaletto painting London: The Thames on Lord Mayor’s Day, looking towards the City and St. Paul’s Cathedral (circa 1750) which formed the visual centrepiece of the celebrations of the Exhibition in London: Royal River: Power, Pageantry and the Thames to mark Queen Elizabeth's 60th year of reign. Veronika smiled as she told the club of her pride as she ascended the escalator at Victoria Station in London to be greeted by a massive banner proclaiming the celebrations - the backdrop - of course - the Lobkowicz Canaletto!\n\nThe club thanked Veronika for the fascinating talk and insight into the collection and the work of the Collection.\n\nA great way to not only see but also support the collection is to be come a member. Membership not only allows you access to the collection but you will also be invited to special private events, viewings and concerts not normally open to the public. A must do and must see in Prague.\n\nApril letter from the District Govenor\n\nDear Rotary Friends,\n\nFollowing on from our spring holidays, we see and feel nature around us in all its renewed energy – this has influence on all our activities, even our Rotary activities. Two weeks ago, all future Club Presidents and Secretaries met at PETS and District Training, so that under the DGE Vladimir Adamek’s conductors baton ‚they gained inspiration and information for the new Rotary year 2015- 2016.\n\nThe month of April in our Rotary calendar is Magazine Month. As you know, it a Rotarian’s duty and right to receive a Rotarian magazine, either The Rotarian, or a regional publication like in our District, our own „ROTARY GOOD NEWS“ (RGN). Its not uninteresting that we belong to that greater proportion of the Rotary world who have their very own magazine. If you are curious about which regions or districts have their own magazine, this you can find on: Rotary World Magazine Press.\n\nI was even more proud of our magazine, when the April information for DGs from the European Office of RI displayed a regional magazine and it was our own RGN! It is the magazine for all of us, which helps us be informed about Club activities in our District and about The Rotary Foundation; the English supplement we provide is very highly regarded by many Rotarians, publishers and other readers! Sometimes, when visiting clubs, I hear the view that our magazine gives more information from the Rotary world but less about our own club activities. The Editorial Board of RGN brings us the specific material sent from RI HQ – this is a requirement under our licence to publish a regional magazine – and in many cases, this is the only way we are informed about Rotary activities worldwide. So I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who, regularly or only sometimes, send articles to RGN and also to the Editorial Board, who has managed to make our magazine one of the best!\n\nI would very much like to welcome a new club into our District, RC Ostrava City, who were chartered on 4.2.2015, and also our District’s first satellite club: Karlovy Vary Spa Satellite Club of RC Most. Welcome into our Rotary District 2240 family! We have received information that RIP Gary Huang has named his Representative to our District Conference in Kosice (22-25.5.2015), and it will be PDG Moshe Yoan from Israel. So I also remind you to register for the District Conference – see attached. Please do not miss this unique opportunity to participate in the 3rd District Conference in Kosice / the first was in 1935, second in 2009. Finally, I would like to ask all those clubs who during the winter months focused their activities on supporting the eradication of Polio – project POLIO, to send these funds as soon as possible to our\n\nDistrict account (name of club, plus word: POLIO), so that the District can send these contributions to RI before the end of the Rotarian Year, as is required. Please send information on your contribution also to Pawel Jurkiewicz, RC Piestany (member of District TRF team): coffeetea01@gmail.com Those of us who wish to find out more about Rotary and meet with RC President Gary Huang, still have time to register for the President’s Conference in Graz 24-25.4.2015, which is focused on the 25th anniversary of re-establishing Rotary in Central and East Europe. Arising from the resolution at the District Training Gathering in Olomouc, the District Legislative Committee will distribute and send out the D2240 Bye Law to each club for their comments, so that the final version can be agreed by the District Conference in Kosice. I wish to thank everyone, including clubs who are working together on this important document.\n\nYours in Rotary,\n\nJozefa Poláková,\n\nDG RI D 2240\n\n2014/2015\n\nMelody in Mali\n\nDear Rotarians,\n\nI am definitely missing a little frosty air, mulled wine and good company in December! It sounds like you had a nice nice time!\n\nI'm afraid that if I write much about what I'm doing here in Mali, it might sound a bit like propaganda. In spite of the dust and some major logistical challenges, I'm quite enjoying this 'gig.'\n\nI have been as busy as expected since the moment I arrived in Mali to set up the Ebola prevention program for the International Rescue Committee (www.rescue.org). The first case of Ebola appeared in Mali just as I arrived and was quickly followed by a few more so an emergency situation seemed imminent. Fortunately, since mid-December, there have been no active cases here and Mali will be declared Ebola-free on January 18. Nevertheless, the need to keep working on improving preventive measures - at home, schools in health centres, stores and anywhere crowds gather - is here to stay as long as there is active transmission in neighboring Guinea. The Ebola outbreak has been and continues to be an invaluable learning experience on so many levels. Although the disease is not yet fully understood, we've learned a lot about how it is transmitted and about local cultural practices, fears and attitudes that can help to break those transmission routes with our interventions. It's really boiled down to providing raising awareness and mobilizing communities.\n\nI'm attaching a photo of part of our Ebola team of doctors, engineers and clowns (yes, clowns - - - can you tell which is which??), a picture of one of our staff interviewing a woman about about Ebola (she's collecting data on that phone in her hand - very handy way to do a survey, and surprisingly well-received here!) and finally a not all work and no play photo of me with some hashing buddies on the pre-Christmas 22k amble over hill and dale and river beds!\n\nIt looks like my replacement is arriving this week so I may be back in Prague before the end of the month. Hope to see you all then!\n\nAll the best,\n\nMelody Munz"
