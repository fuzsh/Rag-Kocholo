        "text": "The novel starts in October, 1937.\n\nThe first event shown is the murder of Anna Hansen, who is in a Reich Bride School. The Reich Bride Schools were institutions established in Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. They were created to train young women to be “perfect Nazi brides”, indoctrinated in Nazi ideology and educated in housekeeping skills. The fiancées of prominent SS members and senior Nazi Party officialswere taught skills including cooking, child care, ironing and to how to polish their husbands’ uniforms and daggers. They were required to swear oaths of loyalty to Adolf Hitler, to pledge to raise their children as Nazis and to marry in what the Nazis alleged to be ceremonies based on pre-Christian model—ceremonies that Nazi officials presided over, rather than ceremonies in churches.\n\nThe Deutsches Frauenwerk ran the schools. The Deutsches Frauenwerk was a Nazi Association for women, which was created in October 1933.\n\nThe leader of the women’s bureau was Gertrud Scholtz-Klink. Gertrud Emma Scholtz-Klink (9 February 1902 – 24 March 1999), was a Nazi Party member and leader of the National Socialist Women’s League (NS-Frauenschaft) in Nazi Germany.\n\nIlse mentions the Ariernachweiss, the certificate of Aryan purity, which was vital for an approval of marriage. In Nazi Germany, the Aryan certificate/passport was a document which certified that a person was a member of the presumed Aryan race. Beginning in April 1933, it was required from all employees and officials in the public sector, including education, according to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service.\n\nThe bride school in the novel is in Schwanenwerder, where Goebbels also had his house. Schwanenwerder is an island in the locality of Nikolassee in southwestern Berlin. The neighbourhood is considered an affluent residential area and was home to known people such as Joseph Goebbels and Ernst Udet.\n\nClara goes to see Magda Goebbels in Schwanenwerder. Johanna Maria Magdalena “Magda” Goebbels (née Ritschel; 11 November 1901 – 1 May 1945) was the wife of Nazi Germany’s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. A prominent member of the Nazi Party, she was a close ally, companion, and political supporter of Adolf Hitler.\n\nJoseph Goebbels was the minister of Propaganda. Paul Joseph Goebbels ( 29 October 1897 – 1 May 1945) was a German Nazi politician who was the Reich Minister of Propaganda from 1933 to 1945. He was one of Adolf Hitler’s closest and most devoted acolytes, known for his skills in public speaking and his deeply virulent antisemitism, which was evident in his publicly voiced views. He advocated progressively harsher discrimination, including the extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust.\n\nIn 1937 the Goebbels had four children: Helga (5), Hilde (3), Helmut (2) and baby Holde. The Goebbels children were the five daughters and one son born to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda Goebbels.\n\nLida Baarova was Goebbels’s mistress, and her new film was Patriots. Lída Baarová (7 September 1914 – 27 October 2000) was a Czech actress who for two years was the mistress of the Nazi propaganda minister of Germany, Joseph Goebbels. Baarová, working for the UFA studios, met Goebbels in 1936. Gradually, they became closer and, under the urging of Goebbels, started a relationship that lasted over two years. Their love affair caused serious complications between Goebbels and his wife Magda.\n\nClara, who is an actress, works for Ufa. The original UFA was established as Universum-Film Aktiengesellschaft on December 18, 1917, as a direct response to foreign competition in film and propaganda. In March 1927, Alfred Hugenberg, an influential German media entrepreneur and later Minister of the Economy, Agriculture and Nutrition in Hitler’s cabinet, purchased UFA and transferred it to the Nazi Party in 1933.\n\nClara was in the film Madame Bovary by Gerhard Lamprecht. Madame Bovary is a 1937 German historical drama film directed by Gerhard Lamprecht and starring Pola Negri, Aribert Wäscher and Ferdinand Marian.\n\nClara says that she will have her first major role in the Pilot’s Bride, and her co-star will be Ernst Udet. Ernst Udet (26 April 1896 – 17 November 1941) was a German pilot during World War I and a Luftwaffe Colonel-General during World War II. Udet spent the 1920s and early 1930s as a stunt pilot, international barnstormer, light aircraft manufacturer, and playboy. In 1933, Udet joined the Nazi Party and became involved in the early development of the Luftwaffe, where he was appointed director of research and development. He was in a few films at the time, and his last film was “The Miracle of Flight”\n\nAt the party that Magda Goebbels invites Clara is two of the guests are Unity Mitford (23) and Diana Mitford (27).\n\nUnity Mitford is a fervent admirer of Hitler. Unity Valkyrie Freeman-Mitford (8 August 1914 – 28 May 1948) was a British socialite, known for her relationship with Adolf Hitler. Both in Great Britain and Germany, she was a prominent supporter of Nazism, fascism and antisemitism, and belonged to Hitler’s inner circle of friends.\n\nDiana Mitford got divorced and in the book she has just married Oswald Mosley. Diana Mitford, Lady Mosley (17 June 1910 – 11 August 2003) was one of the Mitford sisters. She was first married to Bryan Walter Guinness and with whom she was part of the Bright Young Things social group of Bohemian young aristocrats and socialites in 1920s London. Her marriage ended in divorce as she was pursuing a relationship with Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists. She married Mosley at the home of Joseph Goebbels in 1936, with Adolf Hitler as guest of honour.\n\nThere are references to the women Hitler had a relationship with and their problematic lives. Eva Braun attempted suicide a few years before. Eva Braun ( 6 February 1912 – 30 April 1945) was a German photographer who was the longtime companion and later the wife of Adolf Hitler. Braun attempted suicide on 10 or 11 August 1932 by shooting herself in the chest with her father’s pistol. After Braun’s recovery, Hitler became more committed to her and by the end of 1932 they had become lovers.\n\nHe also had a strange relationship with his niece, Geli. Angela Maria “Geli” Raubal (4 June 1908 – 18 September 1931) was an Austrian woman who was the half-niece of Adolf Hitler. Raubal was living in Hitler’s Munich apartment, and he maintained strict control over her actions. She was in effect a prisoner, and planned to escape to Vienna to continue her singing lessons. Hitler and Raubal argued on 18 September 1931 when he refused to allow her to go to Vienna. He departed for a meeting in Nuremberg but was recalled to Munich the next day with the news that Raubal was dead from a gunshot wound to the lung.\n\nThe characters also mention the Spanish Civil war and the bombing of Guernica. The bombing of Guernica (26 April 1937) was an aerial bombing of the Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. It was carried out at the behest of Francisco Franco’s rebel Nationalist faction by its allies, the Nazi German Luftwaffe’s Condor Legion and the Fascist Italian Aviazione Legionaria, under the code name ‘Operation Rügen’. The operation opened the way to Franco’s capture of Bilbao and his victory in northern Spain.\n\nThe German squadron which took part in the bombing was the Condor Legion. The Condor Legion was a unit composed of military personnel from the air force and army of Nazi Germany, which served with the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War of July 1936 to March 1939. The Condor Legion developed methods of strategic bombing which were used widely in the Second World War shortly afterwards. The bombing of Guernica was the most infamous operation carried out by the Condor Legion.\n\nStrauss flew under the orders of Commander Hugo Sperrle. Hugo Otto Sperrle (7 February 1885 – 2 April 1953) was a German military aviator in World War I and a Generalfeldmarschall in the Luftwaffe during World War II. Sperrle was given command of the Condor Legion in November 1936 and fought with the expeditionary force in the Spanish Civil War until October 1937.\n\nEmilio Kleber was the military advisor to the International Brigades, who Mary met in Madrid. Manfred (Moses) Stern (also known as Emilio Kléber) (1896–1954) was a member of the GRU, Soviet military intelligence. He served as a spy in the United States, as a military advisor in China, and gained fame under his nom de guerre as General Kléber, leader of the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nMary is told that she needs to learn to photograph just like Robert Capa in Spain. Robert Capa (born Endre Ernő Friedmann; October 22, 1913 – May 25, 1954) was a Hungarian-American war photographer and photojournalist as well as the companion and professional partner of photographer Gerda Taro. He is considered by some to be the greatest combat and adventure photographer in history.\n\nMary is given a Zeiss Ikon Ikoflex.\n\nThere is a reference to the Nuremberg Laws, which stripped Jews of citizenship. The Nuremberg Laws were antisemitic and racist laws that were enacted in Nazi Germany on 15 September 1935, at a special meeting of the Reichstag convened during the annual Nuremberg Rally of the Nazi Party. The two laws were the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour, which forbade marriages and extramarital intercourse between Jews and Germans and the employment of German females under 45 in Jewish households; and the Reich Citizenship Law, which declared that only those of German or related blood were eligible to be Reich citizens. The remainder were classed as state subjects without any citizenship rights.\n\nIn the novel the Duke and Duchess of Windsor visit Germany on her honeymoon. Edward, Duke of Windsor, and Wallis, Duchess of Windsor, visited Nazi Germany in October 1937. Edward had abdicated the British throne in December 1936, and his brother George VI had become king. Edward had been given the title Duke of Windsor and married Wallis Simpson in June 1937. He appeared to have been sympathetic to Germany in this period and, that September, announced his intention to travel privately to Germany to tour factories. The Duke’s supporters saw him as a potential peacemaker between Britain and Germany, but the UK Government refused to sanction such a role and was against the tour, suspecting that the Nazis would use the Duke’s presence for propaganda. Windsor was keen that his wife—who had been rejected by the British establishment—experience a state visit as his consort. He promised the government to keep a low profile; the tour went ahead between 12 and 23 October 1937.\n\nOne of the high officials who are mentioned in this novel is Robert Ley from the Labour Front. Robert Ley (15 February 1890 – 25 October 1945) was a German politician during the Nazi era; Ley headed the German Labour Front from 1933 to 1945.\n\nClara’s dad is a member of the Anglo-German Fellowship.

It was widely perceived as being allied to Nazism.\n\nClara is warned that her name has been mentioned in the Gestapo Headquarters in Prinz Albert Strasse. The Geheime Staatspolizei, abbreviated Gestapo, was the official secret police of Nazi Germany and in German-occupied Europe. The force was created by Hermann Göring in 1933 by combining the various political police agencies of Prussia into one organisation. On 20 April 1934, oversight of the Gestapo passed to the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, who was also appointed Chief of German Police by Hitler in 1936.\n\nClara makes a reference to Gisela Wessel, an actress who was arrested for taking part in some illegal activities. Gisela Wessel (born November 10, 1926 in Hamburg ) is a German actress and radio play speaker .\n\nHoffman, who Clara sees in the Goebbels’ party, is Hitler’s regular photographer. Heinrich Hoffmann (12 September 1885 – 15 December 1957) was Adolf Hitler’s official photographer, and a Nazi politician and publisher, who was a member of Hitler’s intimate circle. Hoffmann’s photographs were a significant part of Hitler’s propaganda campaign to present himself and the Nazi Party as a significant mass phenomenon.\n\nDuring the party the Mitford sisters talk about Berghof, Hitler’s home in the Bavarian Alps. The Berghof was Adolf Hitler’s vacation home in the Obersalzberg of the Bavarian Alps near Berchtesgaden, Bavaria. The Berghof was rebuilt and renamed in 1935 and was Hitler’s vacation residence for ten years.\n\nHenny Hoffman, the photographer’s daughter, was also at the party. Henriette Hoffmann was the eldest child of the photographer Heinrich Hoffmann. Her house was an early Nazi stronghold, and in 1920 her father, a nationalist and anti-Semitic German Workers’ Party (DAP) member joined its successor, the Nazi Party. By 1930 Henriette Hoffmann worked alongside her studies at the University of Munich, as Hitler’s secretary. Prior to the suicide of Geli Raubal, Hitler briefly dated Henriette.\n\nAt the party there is also Annelies von Ribbentrop, the wife of Germany’s Embassador. Annelies von Ribbentrop (born January 12, 1896 in Mainz , October 5, 1973 in Wuppertal ) was the wife of the Reich Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop.\n\nThere were rumours that Joachim von Ribbentrop had been conducted an affair with Wallis Simpson.

Emma Johanna Henny “Emmy” Göring (24 March 1893 – 8 June 1973) was a German actress and the second wife of Luftwaffe Commander-in-Chief Hermann Göring. On 10 April 1935, she married the prominent Nazi and Luftwaffe chief Hermann Göring, becoming Emmy Göring. Their daughter, Edda, was born on 2 June 1938.\n\nMary Harker, who had been expelled from Germany, can return thanks to Charles Lindbergh, who got her a visa. Lindbergh had made a solo flight from New York to Paris, and his son was kidnapped and murdered. Charles Lindbergh (February 4, 1902 – August 26, 1974) was an American aviator, military officer, author, inventor, and activist. At the age of 25, he went from obscurity as a U.S. Air Mail pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the Orteig Prize for making the first nonstop flight from New York City to Paris on May 20–21, 1927. On March 1, 1932, Lindbergh’s infant son, Charles Jr., was kidnapped and murdered in what the American media called the “Crime of the Century.”\n\nClara is also invited to a party at Udet’s home, and the guests there talk about the Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich. The Degenerate Art exhibition was an art exhibition organized by Adolf Ziegler and the Nazi Party in Munich from 19 July to 30 November 1937. The exhibition presented 650 works of art, confiscated from German museums, and was staged in counterpoint to the concurrent Great German Art Exhibition. One million people attended the exhibition in its first six weeks.\n\nThe characters also mention that the House of German Art opened in Munich. The Haus der Kunst is a non-collecting modern and contemporary art museum in Munich. The building was constructed from 1933 to 1937 as Nazi Germany’s first monumental structure of Nazi architecture and as Nazi propaganda. The museum, then called Haus der Deutschen Kunst (“House of German Art”), was opened on 18 July 1937 as a showcase for what the Nazi Party regarded as Germany’s finest art, with celebrations including a historical pageant and a military parade. The inaugural exhibition was intended as an edifying contrast to the condemned modern art on display in the concurrent Degenerate Art Exhibition.\n\nErich, the son of Clara’s late friend, is in the Hitler Youth Boys. The Hitler Youth was the youth organisation of the Nazi Party in Germany. Its origins date back to 1922. From 1936 until 1945, it was the sole official boys’ youth organisation in Germany and it was partially a paramilitary organisation. It was composed of the Hitler Youth proper for male youths aged 14 to 18, and the German Youngsters in the Hitler Youth for younger boys aged 10 to 14.\n\nClara meets Ralph for a drink at a café owned by the actress Henny Porten.

On 24 June 1921, she married Wilhelm von Kaufmann, a doctor of Jewish origin. When the Nazis took power and she refused to divorce her Jewish husband, she found that her career, while doing twelve films a year, dissolved immediately.\n\nHitler is said to go to Munich often to meet his clique, that is, Rudolf Hess, Putzi Hansfataengl, and Ernst Röhm, who was executed). Rudolf Walter Richard Hess (26 April 1894 – 17 August 1987) was a German politician and a leading member of the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany.\n\nErnst Hanfstaengl (2 February 1887 – 6 November 1975) was a German-American businessman and close friend of Adolf Hitler.

By 1934, the German Army feared the SA’s influence and Hitler had come to see Röhm as a potential rival, so he was executed during the Night of the Long Knives.\n\nHitler’s favourite operetta was the Merry Widow by Franz Lehar. The Merry Widow is an operetta by the Austro-Hungarian composer Franz Lehár. The operetta has enjoyed extraordinary international success since its 1905 premiere in Vienna.\n\nRalph Sommers asks Clara to spy on Strauss, the Nazi pilot, and he tells her that he reports to Theodor Rowehl.

The Berlin Wintergarten theatre was a large variety theatre in Berlin. It opened in 1887 and was destroyed by bombs during World War II. Beyond a movie theatre, it was a multi-use variety theatre.\n\nRalph shows Clara the cyanide capsule he carries in the heel of his shoe. A suicide pill (also known as the cyanide pill) is a pill, capsule, or tablet containing a fatally poisonous substance that one ingests deliberately in order to quickly achieve death through suicide. Military and espionage organizations have provided their agents in danger of being captured by the enemy with suicide pills and devices which can be used in order to avoid an imminent and far more unpleasant death.\n\nWhen Clara is chased by the killer, she goes through the tiergarten. The Tiergarten is Berlin’s most popular inner-city park, located completely in the district of the same name.\n\nClara reaches Ufa Palast am Zoo and realises that it is the premiere of Patriots. The Ufa-Palast am Zoo, located near Berlin Zoological Garden in the New West area of Charlottenburg, was a major Berlin cinema owned by Ufa. Opened in 1919 and enlarged in 1925, it was the largest cinema in Germany until 1929 and was one of the main locations of film premières in the country.\n\nClara manages to get access to the cinema because she runs into Mimi Reiter, a fellow actress. Maria Reiter (23 December 1911 – 28 July 1992), known as “Mimi” or “Mitzi”, was associated romantically with Adolf Hitler in the late 1920s.\n\nAt the premiere Clara also sees other important people.
