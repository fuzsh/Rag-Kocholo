        "text": "Adolf Hitler is one of the most intriguing figures in human history. His frightening rise to power continues to fascinate us, capturing our interest and enhancing our understanding of far-right, totalitarian politics.\n\nBut — whilst you may know a lot about Hitler already — there are many smaller details that aren’t well-known. From adopted dogs to unusual diets, here are six things you (probably) don’t know about the leader of the Nazis.\n\n1. Hitler Adopted a Dog During the First World War\n\nIf you have a keen interest in history, you’re probably aware of Hitler’s participation in the First World War. But I’m guessing you don’t know about his little companion in the trenches.\n\nIn January 1915, Corporal Hitler was inside a trench in Fromelles, France, when a fox terrier appeared. (The dog seemed to have made its way across no man’s land.) Hitler adopted the dog, named him Fuchsl, and developed a close bond with him."
