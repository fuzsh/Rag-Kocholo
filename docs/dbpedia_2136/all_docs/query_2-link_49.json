Found as everything else forth and back (by uploads) by luck. already the site is amazing. i am standing on a field, seeing from the distance the street view and in the back you are able to see the amazing view to old prague. \n\tActually next to this villa on the left side is another highlight which i will show later on. \n\t\n\tfirst image from the field. \n\t\n\tsome description: \n\t\n\tWho's the fuck is LIDA BAAROVA? not less as: Lída Baarová (7 September 1914 – 27 October 2000) was a Czech actress and mistress of Joseph Goebbels. \n\tok, let's copy and paste some more infos from wikipedia: \n\t\n\tIn Berlin she met Gustav Fröhlich, a German actor, and starred in several films with him. In 1935, following her successful appearance in the German film Barcarole, she received several job offers from Hollywood studios. She turned them down, but later regretted it and claimed to her biographer, Josef Škvorecký: \"I could have been as famous as Marlene Dietrich.\"\n\tAfter her engagement to Fröhlich, they moved to Schwanenwerder on the outskirts of Berlin, where their house on the (later named) Karl-Marx-Strasse 8 was close to the residence of Joseph Goebbels on Inselstrasse 8. Goebbels was the propaganda minister in Adolf Hitler's regime, with a decisive voice in German movie production. Baarová met Goebbels in 1936, while working for Ufa films. Gradually, they became closer and started a relationship that lasted over two years. Their love affair caused serious complications between Goebbels and his wife Magda. Mrs Goebbels eventually decided to ask Hitler for permission to divorce Goebbels. The Führer intervened on 16 August, 1938. Baarová was told by Count Helldorf, the Police President of Berlin, that she had to quit her relationship with Goebbels and leave Germany, on Hitler's direct order.[1][2][3] She fled to Prague in 1939 and, in 1942, to Italy, where she starred in such movies as Grazia (1943), La Fornarina (1944), Vivere ancora (1945), and others.\n\tAfter Allied troops occupied Italy, she returned to Prague, where she dated her old friend Hans Albers, another of Germany's movie idols. In April 1945, Lída Baarová left Prague for Germany, to join Albers in his country house on the shores of Lake Starnberg. On the way, she was taken into custody by the American military police, imprisoned in Munich, and later extradited to Czechoslovakia.\n\tIn Czechoslovakia, 1945 Baarová was taken into custody on suspicion of collaboration with the Germans during the war. She was released after 18 months of custody due to lack of evidence. She has never been convicted or sentenced. While in custody, she was often visited by Jan Kopecký who, like many others, was infatuated with her. Kopecký was a close relative of a prominent politician in the post-war government of Czechoslovakia and hoped he could arrange Baarova's release from custody. Kopecký's prominent relative did not approve of this and Kopecký himself faced persecution. This was one of the reasons why Jan Kopecký and Lída Baarová decided to emigrate in 1948. Prior to their escape to Austria, they married on June 27, 1947, and formed an itinerant troupe playing marionettes. From there, Kopecký immigrated to Argentina, leaving Lída behind to recuperate in the sanatorium of Dr. Lundwall.[citation needed]\n\t\n\tIn Austria, Lída attempted a comeback, but Anton Walbrook withdrew from a film where he was cast with her. To escape the resulting negative media, she left for Argentina, where she lived in extreme poverty. She decided to return to Italy. Her husband stayed in Argentina and they were divorced in 1956. Back in Italy, she appeared in several films, including Fellini's I Vitelloni (1953), where she played the wife of a rich merchant. In 1958, she moved to Salzburg, where she performed in a theater. She married Swedish physician Kurt Lundwall in 1969.\n\t\n\tIf she ever felt guilt about her past, she rigorously suppressed it. \"There's no doubt that Goebbels was an interesting character,\" she observed in 1997, \"a charming and intelligent man and a very good storyteller. You could guarantee that he would keep a party going with his little asides and jokes.\"\n\t\n\t\n\tAHA!\n\t\n\tabout this villa: \n\t\n\tConceived as a semi-detached house with the representive part and roof terrace for the client and the second, smaller part for her parents.
