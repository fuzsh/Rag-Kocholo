        "text": "The novel is set in Berlin in 1933 just after the Nazi Party rise to power. Federal elections were held in Germany on 5 March 1933, after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January. They were the last multi-party elections in Germany until 1946.\n\nClara arrives in Berlin, intending to get a part in a film in Badelsberg, the famous film studios. Babelsberg Film Studio, located outside Berlin, is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world, producing films since 1912.\n\nUFA is the company running the film making in the country. UFA was a major German film company headquartered in Babelsberg, producing and distributing motion pictures from 1917 through to the end of the Nazi era.\n\nClara makes reference to many actors of the time. For example, when she visits the studios, there are posters of Leni Riefenstah, Marlene Dietrich and Lilian Harvey.\n\nHelene Bertha Amalie “Leni” Riefenstahl ( 22 August 1902 – 8 September 2003) was a German film director, photographer, and actress, known for her seminal role in producing Nazi propaganda.\n\nMarie Magdalene “Marlene” Dietrich (27 December 1901 – 6 May 1992) was a German-born American actress and singer. Her career spanned from the 1910s to the 1980s.\n\nLilian Harvey (19 January 1906[1] – 27 July 1968) was an Anglo-German actress and singer, long based in Germany.\n\nOther actresses that are mentioned in the book are Kristina Soderbaum, Olga Chekhova and Zarah Leander.\n\nBeata Margareta Kristina Söderbaum (5 September 1912 – 12 February 2001) was a Swedish-born German film actress, producer, and photographer. She is most known for her roles in Nazi-era films made by a German state-controlled production company.\n\nOlga Konstantinovna Chekhova (14 April 1897 – 9 March 1980) was a Russian-German actress. Her film roles include the female lead in Alfred Hitchcock’s Mary (1931).\n\nZarah Leander (15 March 1907 – 23 June 1981) was a Swedish singer and actress whose greatest success was in Germany between 1936 and 1943, when she was contracted to work for the state-owned Universum Film AG (UFA). This caused her films and lyrics to be identified as Nazi propaganda, though she had taken no public political position, and she remained a controversial figure for the rest of her life.\n\nClara travelled to Berlin when she was told that she could get a part in a new film, called Black Roses, starred by Lillian Harvey, but once there she learnt that the main actress was in America and the producer is nowhere to be seen. The film was eventually made and released in 1935. Black Roses is a 1935 German historical drama film directed by Paul Martin and starring Lilian Harvey, Willy Fritsch and Willy Birgel. A separate English-language version Black Roses was also made with Harvey reprising her role opposite Esmond Knight.\n\nWilly Fritsch is the main male character, and Clara hears that he is rumoured to be marrying Lilian Harvey soon. Willy Fritsch (27 January 1901 – 13 July 1973) was a German theater and film actor, a popular leading man and character actor from the silent-film era to the early 1960s.\n\nClara often makes a reference to Metropolis, a film produced by UFA. Metropolis is a 1927 German expressionist science-fiction drama film directed by Fritz Lang. It stars Gustav Fröhlich, Alfred Abel, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, and Brigitte Helm.\n\nClara mentions that Fritz Lang is a director she admires. Friedrich Christian Anton “Fritz” Lang (December 5, 1890 – August 2, 1976) was an Austrian-German-American film director, screenwriter, and occasional film producer and actor.\n\nIn her first visit to the studio, Clara learns that Billy Wilder and Peter Lorre have left the country because of the political situation.\n\nBilly Wilder ( June 22, 1906 – March 27, 2002) was an Austrian-American film director, producer and screenwriter. He became a screenwriter while living in Berlin. After the rise of the Nazi Party, he moved to Paris, due to rampant antisemitism and discrimination against the Jewish people.\n\nPeter Lorre ( June 26, 1904 – March 23, 1964) was a Hungarian-American actor. Of Jewish descent, Lorre left Germany when Adolf Hitler came to power.\n\nThe second main character, Leo Quinn, works for the Intelligence Service and is stationed in the British Embassy in Berlin. His boss is Frank Foley. Major Francis “Frank” Edward Foley (24 November 1884 – 8 May 1958) was a British Secret Intelligence Service officer. As a passport control officer for the British embassy in Berlin, Foley “bent the rules” and helped thousands of Jewish families escape from Nazi Germany,\n\nClara sees Dr Joseph Goebbels in that first visit to the studio. Paul Joseph Goebbels (29 October 1897 – 1 May 1945) was a German Nazi politician who was the chief propagandist for the Nazi Party, and then Reich Minister of Propaganda from 1933 to 1945. A distinctive characteristic of Goebbels is his limp. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg and walked with a limp.\n\nLeo mentions Sir Hugh Sinclair in connection with the Secret Intelligence Service. Admiral Sir Hugh Sinclair (18 August 1873 – 4 November 1939), known as Quex Sinclair, was a British intelligence officer. He helped to set up the Secret Intelligence Service ( before World War II.\n\nHelga, Clara’s new friend, persuades her to go on a double date with her and two of Goebbels’ aides. They go to Kaiserhof Hotel. Hotel Kaiserhof was a luxury hotel in Berlin. It opened in October 1875.\n\nClara draws the attention of Goebbels, and he asks his wife, Magda Goebbels, to contact Clara and offer her to be a model for the new Fashion Bureau. Johanna Maria Magdalena “Magda” Goebbels (11 November 1901 – 1 May 1945) was the wife of Nazi Germany’s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. A prominent member of the Nazi Party, she was a close ally, companion, and political supporter of Adolf Hitler.\n\nClara makes reference to a photo of Magda and Joseph Goebbels’ wedding that she saw in a shop after she arrived in Berlin. They were married on 19 December 1931, with Hitler as a witness.\n\nIt was Magda’s second marriage and he had been married to Gunther Quandt, who she divorced. Günther Quandt (28 July 1881 – 30 December 1954) was a German industrialist. Henry married Magda in 1921and they had a son, Harald Quandt. Magda was half Günther’s age. The marriage ended in divorce in 1929.\n\nOne of the more surprising aspects of Hitler’s arrival in power in 1933 was the foundation of a German Fashion Institute. Known as the Deutsches Modeamt, it was a reflection of Nazi attempts to control every aspect of women’s lives, including what they wore.\n\nWhen Leo meets his contacts in a pub, he mentions Anita Berber. Anita Berber (10 June 1899 – 10 November 1928) was a German dancer, actress, and writer who was the subject of an Otto Dix painting.\n\nIn the pub he watches Werner Finck perform. Werner Finck (2 May 1902 – 31 July 1978) was a German Kabarett comedian, actor and author. Not politically motivated by his own admission but just a “convinced individualist”, he became one of Germany’s leading cabaret artists under the conditions of the Nazi suppression after 1933.\n\nDuring a party thrown by the Goebbels, Clara sees all the high-rank Nazi officers, one of whom is Hermann Goering. Hermann Wilhelm Göring (12 January 1893 – 15 October 1946) was a German politician, military leader and convicted war criminal. He was one of the most powerful figures in the Nazi Party, which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945.\n\nMary and Rupert attend a performance of Erik Jan Hanussen, Hitler’s personal astrologer. Erik Jan Hanussen (2 June 1889, in Vienna – 25 March 1933, in Berlin), was an Austrian Jewish publicist, charlatan and clairvoyant performer. He is said to have instructed Adolf Hitler in performance and the achievement of dramatic effect.\n\nLater in the book Erik Hanussen is killed. Hanussen was assassinated on 25 March 1933, probably by a group of SA men, and was hastily buried in a field on the outskirts of Berlin, He was potential competition to Hermann Göring and Joseph Goebbels for the attention of their Führer, which may also have led to his murder.\n\nLeo explains to Clara that he is translating Ovid’s Metamorphoses. The Metamorphoses is an 8 AD Latin narrative poem by the Roman poet Ovid, considered his magnum opus. Comprising 11,995 lines, 15 books and over 250 myths, the poem chronicles the history of the world from its creation to the deification of Julius Caesar within a loose mythico-historical framework.\n\nLeo also explains to Clara that Ovid had an affair which ended up in his exile. In AD 8, Ovid was banished to Tomis, on the Black Sea, by the exclusive intervention of the Emperor Augustus. This event shaped all his following poetry.\n\nClara finally gets a part in a film made by Gerhard Lamprecht. Gerhard Lamprecht (6 October 1897 – 4 May 1974) was a German film director, screenwriter and film historian. He directed 63 films between 1920 and 1958. He also wrote for 26 films between 1918 and 1958.\n\nThe film is Ein gewisser Herr Gran, that is, A Certain Mr Gran, starred by Hans Albers and Karin Hardt.\n\nHans Philipp August Albers (22 September 1891 – 24 July 1960) was a German actor and singer.

During the period of German National Socialism, Pimpf was a term referring to a member of the Deutsches Jungvolk, the junior section of the Hitler Youth in Nazi Germany, for boys ten to fourteen. They were taught to be loyal to Hitler and the regime. Membership in the Hitler Youth was highly encouraged and incentivised during the mid-to-late 1930s and compulsory from 1939.\n\nMagda Goebbels throws a party at the Adlon Hotel. The original Hotel Adlon was one of the most famous hotels in Europe. It opened in 1907 and was largely destroyed in 1945 in the closing days of World War II, though a small wing continued operating until 1984.\n\nThere Clara meets Emmy Sonnemann, Goering’s girlfriend. Emma Johanna Henny “Emmy” Göring (née Sonnemann; 24 March 1893 – 8 June 1973) was a German actress and the second wife of Luftwaffe Commander-in-Chief Hermann Göring. She served as Adolf Hitler’s hostess at many state functions and thereby staked a claim to the title of “First Lady of the Third Reich”\n\nShe also meets Anneliese von Ribbentrop, the wife of Joachim von Ribbentrop.

The Romanisches Café was a café-bar in Berlin well known as a meeting place for artists. The coming to power of the Nazi Party and the subsequent emigration of most of its regulars signalled the final end of the café as an artists’ haunt. The Romanisches Haus was completely destroyed by an Allied air-raid in 1943.\n\nHelga gets a part in Barcarole, starred by Lida Baarova and Gustav Fröhlich.\n\nLída Baarová (7 September 1914 – 27 October 2000) was a Czech actress who for two years was the mistress of the Nazi propaganda minister of Germany, Joseph Goebbels.\n\nGustav Fröhlich (21 March 1902 – 22 December 1987) was a German actor and film director. He landed secondary roles in a number of films and plays before landing his breakthrough role of Freder Fredersen in Fritz Lang’s 1927 film Metropolis. He remained a popular film star in Germany until the 1950s.\n\nGoebbels forbid Jews from working at UFA. Three days before the official Nazi boycott of German Jews was instituted, Ufa fired all of its Jewish employees (29 March 1933). While in the course of 1933 the Propaganda Ministry was established under Joseph Goebbels (1897–1945) in order to create a precensorship office for the ideological control of all German film productions and the industry was aryanized by making it illegal for Jews to make films, Ufa and other film companies remained economically independent.\n\nThe characters mention Erich Pommer and Erik Charell leaving.\n\nErich Pommer (20 July 1889 – 8 May 1966) was a German-born film producer and executive.

He is best known as the creator of musical revues and operettas. When the Nazis took over in January 1933, the Ufa immediately annulled their contract with Charell because of his Jewish descent.\n\nHelga has no qualms to talk about Hitler, which causes her problems, and she mentions Geli Raubal, Hitler’s niece, who he seemed to have had a relationship with and who committed suicide. Angela Maria “Geli” Raubal ( 4 June 1908 – 18 September 1931) was an Austrian woman who was the half-niece of Adolf Hitler. As Hitler rose to power as leader of the Nazi Party, he was domineering and possessive of Raubal, keeping a tight rein on her. He did not allow her to associate with friends and attempted to have himself or someone he trusted near her at all times, accompanying her on shopping trips, to the cinema and to the opera.\n\nAngriff was the newspaper that Goebbels supported. Der Angriff is a discontinued German language newspaper founded in 1927 by the Berlin Gau of the Nazi Party. The last edition was published on 24 April 1945.\n\nMary Harker visits the Spandau camp where German girls are trained. The League of German Girls or Band of German Maidens was the girls’ wing of the Nazi Party youth movement, the Hitler Youth. It was the only legal female youth organization in Nazi Germany.\n\nThe youth leader was Baldur von Schirach. Baldur Benedikt von Schirach (9 May 1907 – 8 August 1974) was a Nazi German politician who is best known for his role as the Nazi Party national youth leader and head of the Hitler Youth from 1931 to 1940.\n\nLeo mentions Maxwell Knight, a spy.

Anna and her father held right-wing, anti-Semitic views and were considered sympathizers of Nazi Germany, which she visited several times in the 1930s. She later claimed to have met Hans Frank and Rudolf Hess.\n\nRudolf Hess is also mentioned in the book even though not as often as Goebbels or Goering. Rudolf Walter Richard Hess (Heß in German; 26 April 1894 – 17 August 1987) was a German politician and a leading member of the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany.\n\nWhen Helga’s son visits, Clara goes with them to Luna Park.

The park was closed for World War I but reopened after Armistice. Luna Park closed for the last time in October 1933.\n\nEnrich, Helga’s son, talks about his wish to be admitted to Napola, the National Political Academy School. National Political Institutes of Education (commonly abbreviated Napola) were secondary boarding schools in Nazi Germany. They were founded as ‘community education sites’ after the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933.\n\nOne of the time Clara meets Leo to inform him of her activities, they go to the National Gallery, and on that occasion Leo is before the Crucifixion by Brueghel the Younger.\n\nThe National Gallery in Berlin, is a museum for art of the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.

Convinced by events that National Socialism would become a significant force in Germany, Schultz sought interviews with leading members of the Nazi movement, establishing at an early date an acquaintance with then-Captain Hermann Göring, who was later to become Nazi Germany’s highest-ranking leader behind Adolf Hitler. Though personally repelled by Nazism, Schultz cultivated her connections with Göring and with other leading Nazis, strengthening her access to these authoritative news sources, as the Nazis gained control of Germany and, later, as Europe moved toward war. Schultz interviewed Adolf Hitler several times and her firsthand knowledge of Germany’s leaders helped her to accurately report their intentions and goals, as Nazi Germany’s ambitions posed an increasing threat to world peace.\n\nAnother Nazi figure who is mentioned is Ernst Röhm. Ernst Julius Günther Röhm (28 November 1887 – 1 July 1934) was a German military officer and an early member of the Nazi Party.\n\nThe women in Magda Goebbels’s circle mention Eva Braun.
