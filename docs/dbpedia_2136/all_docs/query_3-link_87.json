She made more than 140\n\t\n\tGrethe Weiser was born Mathilde Ella Dorothea Margarethe Nowka in Hanover, Germany, in 1903. She spent her childhood in Kotsche and Dresden. In 1920, she escaped from her dominant and sometimes violent father by marrying Joseph Weiser, a Jewish confectionery manufacturer. Her only child, a son, was born in 1922. The family moved to Berlin. Quite quickly she established herself in the cabaret scene in Berlin, especially after her husband became a leaseholder of a nightclub on the Kurfürstendamm. There Grethe studied acting and singing, and played for the first time at the famous Wintergarten and at the Cabaret der Komiker. Her film debut in Männer vor der Ehe (1927), where she played a mate. In the nextyears, she mainly appeared in smaller roles. Her first bigger part was in the comedy Schützenkönig wird der Felix/Bashful Felix (Carl Boese, 1934) starring Rudolf Platte and Ursula Grabley. Her husband decided to leave Germany because he was Jewish and so not destroy the career of his wife. In 1934, their marriage was dissolved. Later that year, Weiser began a lifelong relationship with Hermann Schwerin, an Ufa film producer. However, the couple were not married until 1958. Weiser avoided becoming a member of the Nazi Party. She managed to finance and arrange for her ex-husband and their son to survive the Nazi years in Switzerland, as well as at the same time continue her career in Germany. She played supporting parts in such films as the drama Einer zuviel an Bord/One Too Many on Board (Gerhard Lamprecht , 1935), starring Lída Baarová,  She played the female lead in the comedy Hilde und die vier PS/Hilde and the Volkswagen (Heinz Paul, 1936) opposite Ludwig Manfred Lommel. She also co-starred with Renate Müller and Georg Alexander in the romantic comedy Eskapade/Escapade (Erich Waschneck, 1936). At the same time, she had successful hits with chansons like Der Vamp or Emils Hände. She played the title roles in the comedies Meine Freundin Barbara/My Friend Barbara (Fritz Kirchhoff, 1937) and Die göttliche Jette/The Divine Jetta (Erich Waschneck, 1937) with Viktor de Kowa. Weiser was a star now. She played a supporting role in the drama Frauen für Golden Hill/Women for Golden Hill (Erich Waschneck, 1938) starring Kirsten Heiberg and Viktor Staal. She also played a supporting part in the last German film with Lilian Harvey, the romantic comedy Frau am Steuer/Woman at the Wheel (Paul Martin, 1939).\n\t\n\tDuring the war years, Grethe Weiser played supporting roles in films like the musical Wir machen Musik/ We Make Music (Helmut Käutner, 1942), starring Ilse Werner and Viktor de Kowa, and the drama Familie Buchholz/The Buchholz Family (Carl Froelich, 1944), starring Henny Porten, After the war, she had a small part in the third DEFA film, Irgendwo in Berlin/Somewhere in Berlin (Gerhard Lamprecht, 1946), which sold 4,179,651 tickets. It was one of the Trümmerfilms (rubble films) made in the aftermath of the Second World War and dealing with the impact of the battles in the countries at the centre of the war. The style is characterised by its use of location exteriors among the ‘rubble’ of bombed-down cities to bring the gritty, depressing reality of the lives of the survivors in those early years. She then was the star of : Morgen ist alles besser/Everything Will Be Better in the Morning (Arthur Maria Rabenalt, 1948), with Ellen Schwanneke and Jakob Tiedtke. She then appeared in the hit Tromba (Helmut Weiss, 1949), a Italian-West German circus film with elements of film noir. It’s success suggested that audiences supported a shift away from Trümmerfilme. Another success was Gabriela (Géza von Cziffra, 1950), starring Zarah Leander. It was Leander's comeback film after a seven-year absence from filmmaking, and Weisser again appeared in a supporting role. During the 1950s, Weiser starred again in a series of West-German comedies. Examples are Wenn Männer schwindeln/When Men Cheat (Carl Boese, 1950|), the cross dressing comedy Fanfaren der Liebe/Fanfares of Love (Kurt Hoffmann, 1951) starring Dieter Borsch and Georg Thomalla, Der keusche Lebemann/The Chaste Libertine (Carl Boese, 1952) again with Georg Thomalla, and Die Kaiserin von China/The Empress of China (Steve Sekely, 1953) with Nadja Tiller. Among her best films are also  Der Onkel aus Amerika/Uncle from America (Carl Boese, 1953) opposite Hans Moser, and Casino de Paris (Andrér Hunebelle, 1957) as the mother of Caterina Valente. Most of her films were comedies, happy humour films and full of heart. In 1960 she played on stage in Hamburg and in Berlin an der Komödie am Hebbel and at the Renaissance Theater. In 1968 she got a Verdienstkreuz (Cross of merit) from the German President. Two years later, Grethe Weiser died after a road traffic accident, aged 67. Her husband also died. She is buried in an Ehrengrab (Honorary Grave) at the Heerstraße Cemetery in Berlin.\n\t\n\tSources: Rudi Polt (IMDb), Wikipedia and IMDb.",
