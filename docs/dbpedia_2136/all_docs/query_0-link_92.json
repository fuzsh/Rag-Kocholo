        "text": "Abbreviations Used\n\nNotes and Sources\n\nWe have deposited our Adolf Hitler research files in the Irving Collection at the Institut für Zeitgeschichte, Munich, Germany. Most of them can be seen without restriction. The principal items are available on our microfilm from Microform Ltd (see page 21.)\n\npage ix Hugh Trevor-Roper (Lord Dacre) emphasised Hitler’s singlemindedness in foreign policy, in a paper read in Munich in November 1959 (VfZ, 1960, 121ff). See also Karl Bracher’s article on Hitler’s early foreign policy (VfZ, 1957, 63ff), and Hitler, Das Zweite Buch (Stuttgart, 1961). page xvii The still-closed Allen Dulles files on the Ciano diaries, 1944–1969, are Nos. 20, 21, 23, 48, and 170 (Princeton Univ. library).\n\npage xxiii Hitler’s ancestry: the propaganda ministry repeatedly forbade any kind of press speculation on this, e.g., in December 1939 (HL, Hans Fritzsche papers).\n\npage xxiv Noted American journalist Louis Lochner visited one concentration camp in May 1933, and wrote to his daughter that the prisoners were treated humanely, but that they were being held without judicial procedure (Lochner papers, State Historical Society of Wisconsin.)\n\npage xxvi The Goebbels diary references are from the entries for Sep 19, 21, Oct 1, 1935.\n\npage 1 The police reports are reproduced in VfZ, 1963, 274ff. The speech in Salzburg in August 1930 (page 2) will be found in BA file ns.11/28. For two more early speeches on the Jews in Vienna, in December 1921 and Jun 1922, see VfZ, 1966, 207f.\n\npage 3 Gerd Heidemann provided the transcript of Hitler’s remarks to Scharrer from his remarkable collection.\n\npage 8 The revealing quotation is from Hitler’s secret speech to his generals, Jun 22,1944 (BA file ns.26/51).\n\npage 13 The OCMH team under Georg Shuster conducted a series of perceptive interrogations of leading Germans including Schacht, Dönitz, Schwerin von Krosigk and Ribbentrop in 1945: these give much frank information on these early years (copies in Irving Collection, IfZ).\n\npage 13 The letters of Walther Hewel from Landsberg are in his widow’s possession: microfilm of Hewel’s diaries and papers, Irving Collection, IfZ.\n\npage 14 Robert Ley wrote several manuscripts in his Nuremberg cell before committing suicide in October 1945. The Nuremberg authorities ordered them destroyed, but they fortunately became lodged in Robert H. Jackson’s files instead (na, rg..238, Jackson files, Box 181). My microfilm of them, DJ–79, is in the Irving Collection, IfZ.\n\nSee also Ley’s interrogation on May 29, 1945 (SAIC/30) and an East German’s view in VfZ, 1970, 443ff. The US embassy sent a 112-pp. report on the Labour Front to President Roosevelt in August 1938, stressing the Front’s ‘belief that the state has an obligation to make the life of the workman richer and fuller.’ Roosevelt wrote to the embassy: ‘All of this helps us in planning’ (FDRL, PSF box 45, Germany).\n\npage 15 On the history of the autobahn, I was fortunate to obtain access to the Fritz Todt family papers and diaries (still restricted); and I used Shuster’s interrogation of Dorsch. See too Dorsch’s paper of Mar 8, 1950, in BA file Kl. Erw. 529/2.\n\npage 15 Relying partly on Elke Fröhlich’s monumental transcription of the diaries of Dr. Joseph Goebbels and on other archival sources, and being the first western historian to retrieve the Goebbels diaries from the microfiches held in the former Soviet secret state archives in Moscow, I wrote a biography of Hitler’s propaganda minister, Goebbels. Mastermind of the Third Reich (Focal Point, London, 1996) as a companion volume to my studies of Milch, Hess, Rommel, and Göring.\n\nThe entries of Feb 3 and 6, 1933, reveal Goebbels’s silent fury at being left out of Hitler’s initial Cabinet. As for the mysterious fire that destroyed the Reichstag building on the night of Feb 27–8, 1933, the private diary note made by Goebbels on Feb 28, 1933 (on the microfiche of Feb 16 – May 1, 1933, which I first reviewed in the Moscow archives in 1992) proves that the conflagration took Hitler and himself totally by surprise; see too Goebbels’s diary for Apr 9, 1941, written after a talk with Hitler about the fire.\n\npage 15 Oron J. Hale, in The Captive Press in the Third Reich (Princeton University Press, 1964) wrote the definitive history of Nazi press monopoly. I also used the Cabinet records (BA, r.43 i/ 1459), Shuster’s interrogation of Eugen Maier and Max Amann, and Seventh Army interrogations of Amann and Hans Heinrich Hinkel. For the loan from Epp, see his papers (t84/24/ 9692).\n\npage 16 The birth of the SS and police state: see Shuster’s interrogations of Frick and Göring, July 1945. Himmler’s letter of May 18, 1937 is on t175/ 40/0962f; Heydrich’s letter to Himmler, May 23, 1939, is in BDC file 238/i.\n\nMy transcript of Himmler’s notes is in the Irving Collection, IfZ.\n\npage 16 For a review of the Nazi Forschungsamt wiretapping agency, see my biography Göring(New York & London, 1989); I have also published a history of the FA, Das Reich hört mit (Arndt Verlag, Kiel, 1989, reissued 1999); revising my earlier documentation on the FA, Breach of Security (London, 1968), the later work is based on my interviews with FA staff, on the manuscript zs.1734 in IfZ files by Ulrich Kittel, a senior FA official, on interrogations of Göring, Steengracht, Ribbentrop, and Schapper, and on the OSS historical file on the FA, xe 4986 (na, rg.226).\n\npage 17 Hitler’s relationship to Hindenburg is described by Lammers under SAIC and USFET interrogation. See also Hitler’s letter to the president, Apr 5, 1933 (t81/80/2044f).\n\npage 18 Hitler’s secret speech of Feb 3, 1933 is the most important proof that his foreign policy remained constant from 1933 to 1941. Mellenthin’s record is in IfZ files; I also used Liebmann’s notes and Raeder’s version, in his manuscript on Hitler and the Party (in Robert H. Jackson’s files).\n\npage 20 On the founding of the secret Luftwaffe, I used Milch’s papers and diaries and Cabinet records. See my book, The Rise and Fall of the Luftwaffe (London & New York, 1973); and the German official histories by Karl-Heinz Völker, Die deutsche Luftwaffe 1933–1939 (Stuttgart, 1967) and Dokumente und Dokumentarfotos zur Geschichte der deutschen Luftwaffe (Stuttgart, 1968).\n\npage 20 Raeder’s study on German naval policy 1933–1945 is in Jackson’s files (NA); see also his Nuremberg interrogation, Nov 9, 1945, and particularly the wartime German studies by navy historian Dr. Treue (BA files pg/ 33965a and 33966a): these quote many pre-war documents no longer traceable. A good guide to the documentation is James Hine Belota’s 1954 Ph.D. thesis, University of California: my microfilm of this, DJ–47, in Irving Collection, IfZ.\n\npage 20 Hitler’s command is quoted in Fritz Todt’s letter to Oberbaurat Koester, 14 Nov 1936 (todt papers).\n\npage 21 Quotations from the Ribbentrop files, see pages xxii-xxiii.\n\npage 21 On the decision to pull out of the League, see Ian Kershaw’s informative discussion in Hitler: 1889‒ 1936 at pages 490–493.\n\npage 24 On the growing tension between SA and regular army, I used Fritsch’s and Liebmann’s paper published by Klaus-Jürgen Müller in Das Heer und Hitler (Stuttgart, 1969): also Weichs’s manuscript (n.19/6) – he had been Fritsch’s chief of staff for one year. Papers in Krüger’s files (t580/265) have a Mar 1934 marginal note by Krüger indicating that he believed the Abwehr was conniving against the SA.\n\npage 26 The quoted passage is from Vormann’s manuscript (IfZ, F34); Keitel and many other army generals have testified that the SA was stockpiling illegal weapons: on which see the evidence in Wehrkreis VII file 1652 (BA).\n\npage 26 Eduard Wagner’s letters are available on our microfilm (see page 12).\n\npage 27 The journalist was Bella Fromm. Her typescript diary is in the Mugar Memorial Library, Boston University. The role of the FA was confirmed to the author by Dr. Gerhard Neuenhoff, and by a BAOR report in xe 4986 (see note to page 16). Göring told Milch that he had sent Körner with the ‘the final bits of evidence against Röhm & Co., probably mostly wiretaps,’ according to Milch’s manuscript written at Kaufbeuren on Sep 1, 1945.\n\npage 27 I first exploited the Goebbels diary microfiche on the Röhm putsch and Dollfuss murder in the Moscow archives in 1992; see my Goebbels. Mastermind of the Third Reich (London, 1996), pages 193f.\n\npage 27 In the archives of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Bonn is a lengthy hand-written ‘Diary of Viktor Lutze beginning with the ill-starred Jun 30, 1934,’ which Dr. Ulrich Cartarius had partially transcribed at the time he kindly allowed me access to it. I suspect that Lutze, who was killed in a 1943 motor accident, retrospectively wrote it up from early 1936.\n\npage 29 The most important items from Wehrkreis VII file 1652 (BA) have been published and analysed by KlausJürgen Müller in Militärgeschichtliche Mitteilungen, 1968, 107ff. I also used Milch’s diary, notebook and unpublished memoirs; papers from the ‘Röhm Trial,’ Munich, May 1957; Shuster’s interrogations of Göring and Frick, July 1945, and of Buch by CCPWE-32.\n\npage 30 On Schleicher’s murder, see Theodor Eschenburg’s paper in VfZ, 1953, 71ff.\n\npage 30 Hans Frank afterwards boasted that he had staged a sit-in at the Stadelheim prison, which he controlled as Bavarian minister of justice, to prevent the arbitrary execution of ‘240 more’ SA men ‘without trial,’ as he later protested to Hitler. Hitler rebuked Frank, ‘You only became minister by default.’ The SS later rued that their captives had ended up in Stadelheim instead of being turned over to Himmler’s tender mercies. On Dec 31, 1934 Frank was dismissed from the Bavarian justice ministry and became a Reich minister without portfolio (USFET-MISC interrogation oi/x-p.26, dated Sep 12, 1945).\n\npage 31 Hitler’s anger at the unnecessary murders is described in Julius Schaub’s private papers, in the Irving Collection, IfZ. Wilhelm Brückner also described this in several affidavits and drafts for the Traunstein police in 1952 (ibid.). For the report of Lutze’s ‘drunken meanderings’ see Himmler’s files, t175/33/1892ff. Lutze’s version is credibly supported by Ley in a long typescript, ‘Thoughts on the Führer,’ written in summer 1945 (Jackson papers, copy in Irving Collection, IfZ). For a list of 83 victims, see t81/80/ 3456ff. On July 16, 1934 Goebbels recorded: ‘Terrible! A lot of things happened that did not entirely accord with the Führer’s will. Fate! Victims of the revolution!’\n\npage 32 Hindenburg’s sympathetic comment was known by Kempka (Shuster interrogation), by Funk (see Henry Picker, Hitlers Tischgespräche, Stuttgart, 1963, 405) and by Brückner (a memo dated May 1949).\n\npage 33 Adam relates this episode in his own secret memoirs (IfZ, ED109). On the Dollfuss murder, see Helmuth Auerbach’s article in VfZ, 1964, 201 et seq.; I also used Papen’s (monitored) conversation on May 7, 1945 (x-p.3) and Shuster interrogations of Seyss-Inquart in July 1945. The Austrian historian Dr. Ludwig Jedlicka has also published important documents of the SS, dredged up from Lake Schwarzensee in Czechoslovakia in 1964, in Der 25. Juli 1934 im Bundeskanzleramt in Wien (Vienna, 1965); to which I add the 1934 Goebbels diaries, see my Goebbels. Mastermind of the Third Reich, pages 184f.\n\npage 35 On relations between the Wehrmacht and SS, Walther Huppenkothen – a Gestapo official – wrote illuminating studies which are in the BDC’s special Canaris file. I also used Fritsch’s papers and a manuscript by General Edgar Röhricht on Himmler’s fight for military power, dated Mar 1946 (IfZ).\n\npage 35 Goebbels noted on Dec 15, 1934: ‘He thus seems to be assuming the worst. I am very downcast…We’ve got to find a good doctor. The Führer must be brought back to good health. The people around the Führer are too easygoing.’\n\npage 36 There is reference to Hitler’s speech of Jan 3, 1935 in the diaries of Leeb, Goebbels, and Milch; the fullest recollections of it are those of Raeder (Aug 1945), Admiral Hermann Boehm (IfZ: zs.12) and Dr. Werner Best (Mar 1949, IfZ). Best’s diary is in the Royal Danish archives, according to British archival sources, but is not available to historians.\n\npage 36 Beck’s papers (n.28).\n\npage 36 Blomberg’s important directive of July 10, 1935 is not found, but adequately paraphrased in Fritsch’s order of Mar 3, 1936 (naval files, AA serial 9944, page e.695952ff). See Donald Watt’s convincing argument on this in Journal of Contemporary HistoryOct 1966, 193ff; and Goebbels’s diaries.\n\npage 37 Hitler’s remark on May 25, 1935 is reported by Raeder’s adjutant, Captain Schulte-Mönting, IMT, xiv, 337; see also Shuster’s interrogations of Dönitz and Raeder, and Wolfgang Malanowski’s paper in WR, 1955, 408ff. For a history of the German admiralty, 1935–1941, see Michael Salewski, Die deutsche Seekriegsleitung 1935–1945, Bd. I (Frankfurt M., 1970), and – specifically from Hitler’s viewpoint – the monograph published by his naval adjutant Rear-Admiral Karl-Jesco von Puttkamer, Die unheimliche See(Munich, 1952).\n\npage 38 Eicken’s medical notes were microfilmed: na special film ml/131. I also used a British interrogation of Eicken, and papers by Schaub.\n\npage 40 Goebbels noted Hitler’s prophecies of a United States of Europe and about the coming wars in his diary entries of May 30 and Jun 9, 1936.\n\npage 41 Körner’s letter was to StateSecretary Herbert Backe. Frau Ursula Backe, the latter’s widow, made her husband’s letters and private papers available to me.\n\nAs for Hitler’s Aug 1936 memorandum, see Professor Wilhelm Treue’s excellent study, printing this document, in VfZ, 1955, 184ff. Hitler briefly referred to it in his Table Talk on Jan 24, 1942. For the Cabinet (Ministerrat) session of Sep 4, 1936 see nd, 416–ec.\n\npage 41 Milch’s records, now in the BA, are important for the origins of the Legion Condor. I also used Shuster’s interrogations of Warlimont and Göring.\n\npage 41 For Göring’s comments see nd, 3474–ps.\n\npage 43 The German tax officials’ association, the Bund deutscher Steuerbeamten, issued a booklet on fifty years of tax reform, Fünfzig Jahre deutsche Steuerfachverwaltung(Düsseldorf, undated), which had an amusing chapter on Hitler’s delinquent tax affairs at pages 53 et seq. For his Who’s Who entry see the chancellery file, ‘Personal Affairs of Adolf Hitler’ (r.43 ii/960); the quotation is from his speech to field marshals and generals on Jan 27, 1944 (BA, Schumacher collection, 365).\n\npage 44 In his manuscript Von Below describes Hitler’s growing interest in Japan. A first-rate source is Shuster’s interrogation of Dr. Werner von Schmieden, who headed the Far East division of the AA.\n\npage 45 For Hitler’s early warmth of feeling toward Britain, see e.g., G. Schubert, Anfänge nationalsozialistischer Aussenpolitik (Cologne, 1963) for the period 1922–1923; and the little-known article by Hitler in the monthly, Deutschlands Erneuerung, 1924, 199ff (on which cf. Wolfgang Horn in VfZ, 1968, 280ff). In his interrogations and manuscripts Ribbentrop dwelt at length on his endeavours to cement Anglo-German friendship: of particular interest is his manuscript of Aug 2, 1945, found among Robert Jackson’s papers (NA), of which I have placed a transcript in the Irving Collection, IfZ. Ribbentrop frequently referred to his 1936 offer of an alliance to Britain: and so did Hitler, e.g., on Aug 31, 1944 (Helmut Heiber, Hitler’s Lagebesprechungen 1942–1945 [Stuttgart, 1962], 614).\n\npage 46 For Hitler’s references to Lloyd George’s remark, see his speeches of May 30, 1942 (Picker, op. cit., 503) and Jan 27, 1944, and Table Talk of Jul 18, 1942.\n\npage 46 Mackenzie-King’s diary note, Jun 29, 1937: Public Archives of Canada, Ottawa: mg26/J.13.\n\npage 47 See the Goebbels diaries, Feb 23, May 3, 26, 1937 and Sep 18, 1938, for Hitler’s ambition to undo the humiliation of the Peace of Westphalia.\n\npage 47 The quotation is from Hitler’s secret speech to Nazi editors on Nov 10, 1938, transcribed, Feb 1940, in BA file NS11/28; a different transcript was published in VfZ, 1958, 175ff and the speech is summarised by Rudolf Likus in Ribbentrop’s files (AA serial 43, 29044ff).\n\npage 47 Hitler’s agents like Keppler and his assistant Dr. Edmund Veesenmayer deserve much closer attention than they have been afforded by historians; they exercised greater immediate influence on foreign policy and events than Neurath, Ribbentrop, and the diplomats. I obtained all possible interrogations of them (US State Department, OCMH, Shuster, and Nuremberg) and studied their BDC personnel files too.\n\npage 48 Bene as a ‘crafty, squintyeyed little rat’: Goebbels diary, Feb 16.\n\npage 49 There is material on the iron and steel shortage of 1937 in Milch’s and naval staff files and the Jodl diary. For the raw-materials origin of the Hossbach Conference, see Milch files, md.53/867, 53/849, 65/7510.\n\npage 49 François-Poncet reported on the Hossbach Conference in two cypher telegrams, Nos. 4409–10, on Nov 6, 1937 (unpublished); that the FA decoded these is evident from correspondence between Blomberg, Raeder, Puttkamer and Wangenheim in naval staff files (pg/33272).\n\npage 49 An authentic but evidently incomplete note on the Hossbach Conference of Nov 5, 1937 exists, written on Nov 10 (nd, 386–ps). There has been controversy as to its authenticity: e.g., Walter Bussmann in VfZ, 1968, 373ff. I am satisfied with it, as Hitler’s adjutants (Below, Puttkamer) told me they saw it at the time; it is also mentioned in Jodl’s diary, and in Beck’s horrified commentary of Nov 12 (BA, n.28/4), and indirectly in the Wehrmacht directive of Dec 7, 1937. Other useful arguments on it: Kielmansegg, in VfZ, 1960, 268ff; and Hermann Gackenholz, Reichskanzlei 5 Nov 1937 (Berlin, 1958), 459ff. It is to be noted that there is no acceptable evidence of any opposition by Fritsch either at this conference or later. He did not even mention the conference in his private papers. Alan Bullock, in Hitler, a Study in Tyranny, describes a dramatic row between Hitler and Fritsch on Nov 9: it must have been a loud one, because Fritsch spent the day in Berlin and Hitler was in Munich.\n\npage 50 The letter from the naval commandant, Captain Schüssler, to Raeder is dated Jun 26, 1937 (BA, pg/33273). On Jan 10, 1944, the Admiral speculated that Hitler had decided quite early to square accounts with the USSR, primarily for Weltanschauung reasons. ‘In 1937 or 1938 he did hint that he intended to eliminate the Russians as a Baltic power; they would then have to be diverted towards the Persian Gulf.’ (pg/33954b).\n\npage 50 The speech of Nov 23, 1937 is on BA discs F5/EW.68,368–68, 400.\n\npage 50 Lord Halifax’s diary contains a graphic account of his meeting with Hitler: Borthwick Institute, York University; and PRO, fo.371/20736.\n\npage 51 Ribbentrop’s long letter to Hitler, A.5522 dated Dec 27, 1937, is in the British FO library: it seems to have been handed by Ribbentrop as a carbon copy to Montgomery in May 1945 to ensure it was brought immediately to public attention. Quite the reverse happened: it vanished from sight until recently. I have supplied transcripts to the AA, the IfZ and BA.\n\npage 51 A misdated and unsigned summary of Hitler’s speech on Jan 21, 1938 is in BA file rh.26–10/255. Milch noted in his diary, ‘Three-hour speech by Führer to Reich war ministry. Tremendous!’ And Jodl, ‘At the end of the National-Political course the Führer speaks two and a half hours to the generals on his views on history, politics, the nation and its unity, religion and the future of the German people.’\n\npage 53 Blomberg’s own surviving accounts of this affair are his manuscript for the US Seventh Army, SAIC FIR/ 46 of Sep 13, 1945, and unpublished jottings in his family’s possession, since transcribed by Elke Fröhlich of IfZ. I also used the diaries of Alfred Jodl and Wolf Eberhard; the latter officer was Keitel’s adjutant 1936-1939. Microfilm (DJ–74) and my transcript of the Eberhard diary are in the Irving Collection, IfZ. Of secondary value were interrogations of Karl Wolff, Meissner, Keitel, Wiedemann, Bodenschatz, Puttkamer, Count von der Goltz, Frau Charlotte von Brauchitsch, Canstein, Siewert, Engel and Lammers; the unpublished memoirs of Hitler’s Luftwaffe adjutant Below, written in 1946; and the diaries of Göring deputy, Erhard Milch (of which I have deposited transcripts and microfilm, DJ–56, 57, 58 and 59, in the Irving Collection, IfZ).\n\npage 55 The ‘Buff Folder,’ the police file on Fräulein Gruhn, survives as No. 7079 in the archives of the Berlin public prosecutor. It contains no evidence of a criminal record or of morals charges. From the testimonies of Miklas and Löwinger in the file, it is possible to reconstruct how she was entrapped. I visited her in West Berlin in 1970, but she was not willing to be interviewed.\n\npage 55 Fritsch’s personal hand-written notes composed between Feb 1938 and Sep 27, 1938 were removed to Moscow in 1945 from the Potsdam army archives, and were kindly made available to me by Lev Bezymenski. I deposited transcripts with the BA–MA, Fritsch Collection, n.33/22 and the Irving Collection, IfZ. Their authenticity was confirmed to me by Fritsch’s adjutant, Colonel Otto-Heinz Grosskreutz. Of supporting interest were Fritsch’s private letters to the Baroness Margot von Schutzbar, of which the originals are in the Wheeler-Bennett collection at St. Anthony’s College, Oxford; and the Feb 1939 manuscripts of Fritz Wiedemann, Hitler’s ex-adjutant, in the Library of Congress, Box 604 (see my transcript in the Irving Collection, IfZ).\n\npage 59 Fritsch was interrogated by the Gestapo’s Dr. Werner Best and Franz Josef Huber on Jan 27, 1938. The 83-page verbatim record – on NA microfilm t82/272 – quotes the Fritsch dossier extensively, as do his own notes.\n\npage 62 Other biographers have without exception dated this speech by Hitler on Feb 4, 1938: but Fritsch’s notes, the diaries of Milch, Eberhard, and the later Field Marshal von Leeb make clear that it was on the fifth. The best summaries are those by Liebmann (IfZ, ed.1), Felmy, Adam, Weichs, Hoth, and Guderian.\n\npage 63 Heitz described his meeting with Hitler and Himmler on various occasions, e.g., to Weichs, Viebahn, and von der Goltz; he himself died in Soviet captivity.\n\npage 66 I base my account of Hitler’s speech winding-up the Fritsch affair on Jun 13, 1938, on Fritsch’s notes, on the letters written by Halder and KarlHeinrich von Stülpnagel to Beck on Jun 14 and 15 (n.28/3), on the diaries of Milch and Eberhard, and on the written recollections of Liebmann, Below, Adam, Felmy, Judge-Advocate Rosenberg and General von Sodenstern.\n\npage 67 Hess’s letters to his parents were intercepted and copied by British Intelligence (fo.371/26566). His widow Ilse allowed me exclusive access to the rest.\n\npage 68 Todt’s remark is in a letter to Dietrich, July 15, 1937 (family papers).\n\npage 70 Letters listing films shown to Hitler and his comments are in his personal office (Adjutantur) files, e.g., ns.10/48.\n\npage 70 The events leading up to the Führer’s meeting with Schuschnigg were exhaustively examined in Der Hochverratsprozess gegen Dr. Guido Schmidt (Vienna, 1947), which contains documents and illuminating testimony from Schmidt, Hornbostel, Tauschitz and others. Apart from the countless interrogations of Papen (e.g., x-p.3), Keppler, Veesenmayer and Dirksen, I found the unpublished 1938 Goebbels diary and Austrian documents captured in 1938 by the Nazis invaluable: AA, serial 2935.\n\npage 70 In his interrogations, e.g., by the US State Department and at Nuremberg, Neurath gave specious reasons for his dismissal as foreign minister.\n\npage 71 Ribbentrop was thus described by Stülpnagel to Vormann (IfZ, f34). He attracted few friends, but in private some diplomats still spoke kindly of him to me – for instance Hasso von Etzdorf, a post-war ambassador to the U.K., who mentioned several positive qualities to me. In view of Weizsäcker’s bitter hostility to him, as a professional diplomat, the references in his diary need taking with a pinch of salt: I suspect that some – written on loose sheets – were interpolated by Weizsäcker years later.\n\nRibbentrop told Shuster in July 1945, ‘It was my sole function as foreign minister to execute the Führer’s foreign policy by diplomatic means.’ He wrote the same to Himmler on Sep 6, 1942 (t175/117/2473). In addition to the important Ribbentrop files mentioned on page xxii, researchers should consult file xe.000887 on Ribbentrop released by Fort Meade (na, rg.319).\n\npage 72 Reinhard Spitzy, Ribbentrop’s secretary, gave me an eye-witness account of the Berghof meeting. Minister Guido Zernatto’s account of these events, published in Candideas ‘The Last Days of Austria,’ will be found usefully in Ambassador von Mackensen’s papers (AA, serial 100, 65372ff).\n\npage 72 On the Hamburg suspension bridge project, there is an informative letter in Todt’s papers from him to Major-General Hermann von Hanneken, Apr 1, 1939 (‘The Führer has expressed the wish that work should begin this year’). Test drilling was complete, but a petroleum wharf would have to be moved to make way for the southern pylon and bridge pier.\n\npage 73 Further evidence that Hitler planned no immediate action on Austria is implicit in a letter from his special agent Keppler to Himmler, dated Mar 7, 1938: ‘…May I remind you that you were going to submit proposals as to which officers you considered best suited for the exchange with Austria’ (Himmler files, t175/32). See too Goebbels’s 1938 diary, a complete transcript of which I published and annotated as Der unbekannte Dr. Goebbels (Focal Point, London, 1995).\n\npage 74 Wilson’s letter is in Roosevelt’s files (FDRL, PSF box 45, Germany). For Chamberlain’s report to the Foreign Policy Committee, see DBFP, xix, No. 465. Henderson’s offical report is instructive: ‘England,’ he had argued to Hitler, ‘had declared her readiness to clear up the difficulties, and she now put the question to Germany whether she too on her side is ready.’ On the colonies, Hitler rightly challenged whether Belgium and Portugal, currently administering them, had even been consulted. He added that he ‘could easily wait for six, eight, or ten years’ for colonies – Germany was not interested in colonial expansion, he said. This was hardly the attitude of a state wishing to ‘rule the world’ or challenge the British Empire. Henderson reported to the British Cabinet that it ‘was clearly not colonies which interested Hitler.’ See too Henderson, Failure of a Mission,\n\npage 116.\n\npage 75 The OKW study of Mar 7, 1938, drafted by Beck but signed by Brauchitsch, is in naval file pg/33311. Hitler’s reaction is in Keitel’s memoirs.\n\npage 78 The 1945 interrogations of Glaise-Horstenau, and above all his conversation with Ribbentrop’s aide Likus on Apr 20, 1938 (AA files, serial 43, 28926ff) provide most of the narrative. My timing of events is based on the diaries of Goebbels, Bormann, Eberhard, and Jodl, on the FA reports (2949–ps) and post-war interrogations of Göring, Papen, Keppler, Wiedemann, and the police general von Grolmann.\n\npage 80 Hitler’s anxiety about Mussolini’s reaction is plain from the FA’s record of his phone conversation with Prince Philipp of Hesse, his courier to Rome, on Mar 11, 1938 (2949–ps). On Mar 12, Jodl noted in his diary, ‘Schörner [commanding a Mountain Corps] is pushed forward to the Italian frontier.’ In a letter to the OKW on 28 Mar, Keitel mentioned that Hitler was asking whether the three mountain divisions ‘are adequate for an initial defence of our southern frontier and to what extent they are to be reinforced by frontier guards’ (pg/33274). I have put a transcript of Jodl’s unpublished diary Mar 11–18, 1938, in my collection, IfZ. For a facsimile of Hitler’s letter to Mussolini, see T. R. Emesen, Aus Görings Schreibtisch (East Berlin, 1947).\n\npage 80 On the nocturnal phone calls to Hitler, see Weizsäcker’s letter to his mother, Mar 13, 1938: ‘The last days were pretty hectic. Even at night – i.e., on Mar 11/12 – Marianne got little sleep as my phone never stopped ringing.’ Most of the calls came from Vienna, as Weizsäcker recalled on Mar 26: ‘After Seyss-Inquart was successfully installed, he represented that it would be superfluous and undesirable for German troops to march in. During the night of Mar 11–12 I passed on these representations, in part, supported by our chargé d’affaires [in Vienna] von Stein, by General Muff [the military attaché] and by the C.-in-C. of the army, General von Brauchitsch; but nobody in the Reich chancellery would listen.’ Since I wrote this work, the Weizsäcker papers have been published by Professor Leonidas Hill (Berlin, 1974). There is little excuse for past historians (A.J.P. Taylor, Alan Bullock, Joachim Fest, John Toland) to have ignored them.\n\npage 80 Viebahn’s nervous breakdown is described in Jodl’s unpublished diary, and in the unpublished part of Keitel’s memoirs too.\n\npage 81 That Hitler only decided on Anschluss when actually in Linz is proven by entries in the diaries of Weizsäcker (Mar 26, 1938) and Milch, and by the testimony of Keitel, Keppler, Milch, and the secretary of the Austrian legation in Berlin, Johannes Schwarzenberg; both Ribbentrop and Göring were astounded by Hitler’s decision.\n\npage 82 Wolf Eberhard described the finger-and-thumb episode to me; after the entry into Prague in March 1939, Keitel actually reminded Eberhard of it.\n\npage 83 In addition to published and unpublished British, French, German, Czech, Polish and American documents I drew extensively on interrogations of Ribbentrop, Andor Hencke (the Secretary of the Prague Legation), General von Wietersheim, General von Salmuth, Halder, General Kalmann Hardy (the Hungarian military attaché), Nicolaus von Horthy, Brauchitsch and Blaskowitz, and on the written testimonies of Below, Engel, Adam and Henlein’s Berlin agent, Fritz Bürger, for the chapters that follow.\n\nBesides the Weizsäcker, Jodl, and Eberhard diaries three more diaries are now of importance: that kept by Hitler’s ADC Max Wünsche from Jun 16 to Nov 20, 1938 (ns.10/25) listing the Führer’s appointments and decisions: the diary of Helmuth Groscurth, published as Tagebücher eines Abwehroffiziers 1938–1940 (Stuttgart, 1970), and Goebbels’s May 1938 diary.\n\npage 85 For Keitel’s instruction of Mar 28, 1938, see file pg/33274.\n\npage 86 Likus reported, on Apr 26, Hitler’s remarks to Sztójay (AA, serial 43, 28929).\n\npage 87 Hitler’s visit to Rome is described in many sources – notably in Julius Schaub’s manuscripts, in Engel’s notes, and in Wiedemann’s San Francisco manuscript of Mar 28, 1939.\n\npage 88 Hitler’s remark aboard Conte Cavourwas recalled to Ciano on Aug 13, 1939: it is clearer from the draft (Loesch film, F5, or t120/610) than from the final typescript that this was Hitler’s, not Mussolini’s remark.\n\npage 89 Speer and Schaub both confirmed Hitler’s gratitude to the Social Democrats for abolishing the monarchy; so do the typescript memoirs of Franz von Sonnleitner, which Reinhard Spitzy kindly made available to me; and see Dr. Werner Koeppen’s note of Sep 18, 1941: Koeppen wrote 192 summaries of Hitler’s mealtime conversation for Rosenberg’s information; of these, Nos. 27–55 have survived (t84/387).\n\npage 89 Jeschonnek’s report is in naval staff file pg/33272.\n\npage 90 Hitler’s private remarks were in his Table Talk, Oct 21–22, 1941. See also the post-war interrogations of Albert Speer and – with due caution – his books, and the fine (but unpublished) dissertation by Dr. Armand Dehlinger on Nazi reconstruction plans for Munich and Nuremberg (IfZ, MS 8/1). Schmundt recorded Keitel’s and his own secret conferences with Hitler several times between Apr and Oct 1938, and filed the notes with telegrams and directives on ‘Green.’ Schmundt’s ‘Green’ file was microfilmed by NA at my request (their film t77/1810). A formal war diary was also begun shortly after by Helmuth Greiner for the OKW’s National Defence branch (L.), as an entry in Eberhard’s diary on Nov 22, 1938, on Keitel’s daily conference records: ‘Greiner: goes on leave, after completion of War Diary for period from May 21, 1938 to conclusion of Czech crisis: Valuable material compiled daily, largely from hand-written notes of Chief of OKW [Keitel]. Wehrmacht adjutant, Lieut.-Colonel Schmundt, suggests note to effect that further complementary documents are in his files.’ (The 1938 Greiner war diary has not been seen since.)\n\npage 91 In Reich justice ministry files is a note on the fate of the two Czech policemen (Koranda and Kriegl) who gunned down the two Sudeten German farmers. On Oct 20, 1940 the minister ruled that they had no case to answer; but Himmler nonetheless had them locked away (BA, r.22/4087).\n\npage 92 Puttkamer cabled Raeder on May 24, 1938 about Hitler’s prediction that Britain and France would now be the Reich’s enemies: see naval files pg/ 36794, 33535 and 34162 for the telegram, together with the flurry of conferences that Hitler’s prophecy instigated at naval staff level.\n\npage 92 Hitler’s order for the West Wall – popularly dubbed the Siegfried Line – is mentioned in Fritz Todt’s diaries and papers (in family possession), in Adam’s memoirs, and in records of the General Staff’s fortifications branch (t78/300).\n\npage 93 In view of their importance, I completely deciphered Beck’s pencilled notes written during Hitler’s speech on May 28, 1938 (n.28/3); my transcript is in the Irving Collection, IfZ. Wiedemann also described the speech in his 1939 and 1940 manuscripts (film DJ–19) and in various interrogations. In his diary Weizsäcker observed on May 31, 1938: ‘On 28 May the Führer briefed his intimates in a three-hour speech to the effect that preparations for the later settlement of the Czech problem are to be forced ahead. He named..? [sic] as the date.’\n\npage 93 Raeder’s stipulation appears again in the naval staff’s study of Oct 25, 1938 (pg/34181): ‘The objective of land operations [in the west] must be to occupy the Channel coast as far as the western approaches (Brest etc.),’ because to occupy this coastline would be ‘of overriding importance for the navy and Luftwaffe in the event of war with Britain/France.’\n\nRaeder doubtless made this plain to Hitler on May 27, because in his secret speech next day Hitler confirmed (according to Beck’s cryptic notes), ‘Objective of a war in west (France and Britain) is enlarging our coastal baseline (Belgium, Holland). Danger of Belgian and Czech neutrality. Therefore eliminate Czechs.’ Wolfgang Foerster’s interpretation of these lines in Ein General kämpft gegen den Krieg (Munich, 1949) is wrong: he expands them to suggest that the enlarging of the baseline (Belgium and Holland) would be the objective of war with the western powers; in fact it was the prerequisite, as Beck’s original note shows.\n\npage 95 Wünsche’s diary has lain unrecognised in Adjutantur des Führers files since 1945: now in BA file ns.10/ 125; and see ns.10/116. Fan-mail on the Schmeling fight: ns.10/13 and ns.10/88.\n\npage 96 For Hitler’s directive on pornographic interrogations, as quoted, see Lammers’ file r.43 ii/1536 and justice ministry file BA, r.22/1085. Such a rule would have spared President Bill Clinton much embarrassment in the 1998–9 Monica Lewinsky affair.\n\npage 97 The quotation on Kempka is from his RuSHA dossier (BDC).\n\npage 97 My account of Hitler’s relations with women is based on Wiedemann’s Feb 1939 manuscript; Schaub’s papers; a manuscript by Henriette Hoffmann; and an interrogation summary of Dr. Karl Brandt titled ‘Women around Hitler,’ Aug 6, 1945. Specifically on Geli Raubal, I interviewed her brother Leo Raubal in Linz, and used too the interrogation of their mother, the later Frau Angela Hammitzsch (46M-13) and of the housekeeper Anni Winter (IfZ, zs.494).\n\npage 97 Emil Maurice discussed his role with Christa Schroeder, who was my source. Top Nazis gossiped freely about Hitler’s triangular affair – see Goebbels’s diary for Oct 19, 1928: ‘Kaufmann… tells me crazy things about the Chief, his niece Geli, and Maurice… I understand everything, true and untrue.’\n\npage 99 The Eva Braun diary, 6 Feb to 28 May 1935, is periodically ‘rediscovered’ – for example by Dr. Werner Maser in Jasmin. Its faking by Eva herself is testified to by one of her friends, Frau Marion Schönmann.\n\npage 100 Speer’s memorandum is in Party chancellery files (t580/871).\n\npage 101 Todt’s letter to Thorak is in Todt family papers.\n\npage 103 A transcript of Hitler’s secret speech is in BA file ns.26/51.\n\npage 104 The quotation is from his secret speech to Nazi editors on 10 Nov 1938. See my note to page 47.\n\npage 105 Adolf Hitler’s ‘Study on the problems of Our Works of Fortification’ is dated Berchtesgaden July 1, 1938 (nd, 1801–ps). Warlimont stated under interrogation, ‘It is one of the best examples of Hitler’s military talent.’ And General Kurt Zeitzler agreed in a 1961 lecture (n.63/96) that Hitler had enormous sympathy with the hardships of combat troops – it was Hitler who pointed to the need for fortified latrines in the West Wall. One sketch of a command post by Hitler will be found in BA file 75134/38.\n\npage 106 Todt refers to his visit to the Berghof in a letter to Ministerialrat Schönleben on Aug 12, 1938 (Todt papers).\n\npage 106 ‘Put the wind up them’ – the quotation is from Eberhard’s diary, Aug 15, 1938. Eszterházy’s report to the Hungarian General Staff is in the Budapest national archives. See Professor Jörg Hoensch’s standard work, Der ungarische Revisionismus und die Zerschlagung der Tschechoslowakei (Tübingen, 1967). Winston Churchill, who had seen Henlein in London on May 13, 1938, was clearly completely taken in by his reasonableness and apparent independence of Hitler’s will. See Martin Gilbert, Winston S. Churchill, v, 939ff and Goebbels’s diary.\n\npage 106 For this visit, see Wiedemann’s papers. Sir Alexander Cadogan, Chamberlain’s adviser, wrote in his diary on July 18, 1938, ‘He [Wiedemann] said he was Hitler’s adjutant when H. was a “despatch bearer” during war, had to confess he never suspected his possibilities – thought him just a brave, reliable soldier.’ As for Forster’s meeting with Churchill, the Soviet government published Churchill’s account of it as found in German files (Dokumente und Materialien aus der Vorgeschichte des Zweiten Weltkrieges, 1937‒1938, Bd.I [Moscow], 144).\n\npage 107 Jodl’s diary has the best account of Hitler’s Berghof speech (of 10 Aug). Wietersheim, Keitel, Adam, and Halder rendered later descriptions, as did Salmuth in a manuscript dated Feb 2, 1946, in my possession, and General Bernhard, in a letter to Louis Lochner dated May 28, 1945 (HL, Lochner papers, box 2).\n\npage 108 Eberhard glued a four-page note on Hitler’s secret speech of Aug 15, into his diary. Some months later Liebmann also wrote an account (IfZ, ed.1).\n\npage 111 Post-war publications by the exile Hungarians are coy about how far they agreed to aid the Nazis, but the contemporary records seem plain enough – especially the Hungarian notes on their talks with Hitler, Göring, Keitel, Beck, and Brauchitsch Aug 22– 26, 1938, in which the Hungarian position was stated at one stage as: ‘Hungary has every intention of squaring accounts with Czechoslovakia in her own interest, but cannot be precise as to a date’ (t973/15/0326ff); see also the 1941 report by the German general attached to Hungarian forces (t78/458/ 5349). I used in addition Weizsäcker’s private papers, interrogations of Hardy and Horthy, and interviews of Spitzy and Raeder’s adjutant, Captain Herbert Friedrichs.\n\npage 112 Hitler’s conferences with the West Wall generals are recorded in General Staff files (t78/300/1364ff) and Adam’s memoirs (IfZ, ed.109/2) as well as Jodl’s diary.\n\npage 115 The memorandum, dated Sep 1, 1938, is in Schwerin von Krosigk’s files (t178/300/1302ff).\n\npage 118 The complete file of FA ‘brown pages,’ Sep 14–26, 1938, reporting Bene’s telephone conversations with Masaryk and others, was handed by the Nazis to the British ambassador in Berlin on the twenty-sixth (PRO, fo.371/21742). In Prague and London the Czechs (Hodza and Masaryk) indignantly denied them at the time; but one of Masaryk’s staff later admitted to British author Laurence Thompson – who did not see the actual wiretaps – that the conversations had taken place (see The Greatest Treason [London], 121). Kittel and Spitzy confirm this, as does Emil Rasche (in report xe.4896, na: rg.226).\n\npage 119 Chamberlain’s visit to the Berghof is reported in his own notes, in the diaries of Wünsche, Goebbels, and former ambassador Ulrich von Hassell, Vom andern Deutschland(Frankfurt, 1964), Sep 17, 1938, and in the British Cabinet minutes. On Sep 16, Weizsäcker wrote to his mother: ‘For about an hour yesterday the Führer related to Ribbentrop and me how his talks went. Both from an objective and from a psychological point of view it was perhaps the most interesting thing I’ve heard for a long time.’\n\npage 120 On the Sudeten Free Corps, see Dr. Martin Broszat’s excellent study in VfZ, 1961, 30ff; and Köchling’s own report dated Oct 11, 1938 (nd, ec– 366–1).\n\npage 123 Churchill’s sneak visit to France raised hackles on both sides of the Channel. Sir Maurice Hankey wrote in his diary on Oct 2, ‘Winston Churchill’s sudden visit to France by aeroplane, accompanied by General [E. L.] Spears, and his visit only to the members of the French Government like Mandel, who is opposed to the policy of peace, was most improper – Bonnet, the French foreign minister, has complained about it, asking what we would say if our prominent French statesmen did the same.’\n\npage 124 Hitler’s codebreakers at Godesberg: referred to in USFET Intelligence summary on the Forschungsamt, Oct 4, 1945.\n\npage 127 The events of Sep 28, 1938 are chronicled in Hassell’s, Eberhard’s, Jodl’s and Weizsäcker’s diaries and in the telegram of the American chargé d’ affaires to the US State Department on Oct 21, 1938 (The Foreign Relations of the United States [hereafter FRUS] 1938, I, 727ff). I also used Likus’ report to Ribbentrop, 3 Oct (AA, serial 43, 28993). According to Wiedemann, under interrogation in 1945, Hitler admitted to Göring that the British fleet mobilisation was the reason for his change of heart: ‘You see, Göring,’ Hitler said a month later, ‘at the last moment I thought the British fleet would shoot.’\n\npage 128 The Luftwaffe lieutenant who acted as interpreter at Hitler’s private meetings with the Italians that day, Sep 29, was Peter-Paul von Donat; see Deutsches Adelsblatt, Jun 15, 1971, for his account.\n\npage 130 Commenting on the ‘piece of paper’ over lunch in Berlin on Oct 1, Hitler remarked, according to Goebbels’s diary, that he did not expect Britain to honour it. Chamberlain was a real fox: ‘He tackles each issue ice-cool,’ he repeated, adding: ‘We’re really going to have to watch out for these British.’ The document went into the AA archives with a Top State Secret classification. In a private letter on Sep 30, Fritz Todt wrote: ‘The last few weeks have been tough going. But in four months we have poured the same amount of concrete along our frontier as the French managed in four years. This fact was not without its effect on the [Munich] conference.’\n\npage 132 For a published work on Nazi subversion in Slovakia that winter, see Jörg Hoensch, Die Slowakei und Hitlers Ostpolitik(Cologne–Graz, 1965). Notes on the Nazis’ talks with Slovak leaders are on Loesch film F18 (t120/625). For the Czech documentation, see Das Abkommen von München, Tschechoslowakische diplomatische Dokumente 1937–1939 (Prague, 1968).\n\npage 133 A translation of one Göring diary, Oct 3, 1938–Aug 8, 1942, was published in the London Daily Herald, July 7–14, and the New York Herald Tribune, July 6–24, 1945.\n\npage 134 For these FA wiretaps, see the FA’s highly significant summary ‘On British Policy from Munich to the Outbreak of War’ (n.140098) in Woermann’s AA file entitled ‘Documents: Outbreak of War’ (t120/723). It seems surprising that every historian who has written on that subject (including A.J.P. Taylor, Walther Hofer, Joachim Fest) overlooked this file. I published the entire document in translation in Breach of Security (London, 1968), with supporting materials, and in Das Reich hört mit (Kiel, 1995).\n\npage 134 Thomas described Keitel’s telephone call from Munich in several post-war interrogations, and in a speech to his Armaments Inspectors on Mar 29, 1940 (see the BA publication, Geschichte der deutschen Wehr- und Rüstungswirtschaft 1918–1945, Appendix III).\n\nMrs Jutta Thomas, my private secretary in London for over twenty years, who performed many feats including transcribing the Rommel shorthand diaries, mentioned only when she finally retired that the late General Thomas was her father-in-law.\n\npage 136 Goebbels’s scandalous behaviour is noted in the private diaries of Groscurth, Dec 30, 1938, and Hassell, Jan 22, 1939. Rudolf Likus minuted his chief, Ribbentrop, on Nov 3, 1938: ‘There has been uproar at the Gloria Palace cinema from Friday to Sunday during showing of the film Spieler. Lida Baarova was jeered. As from Monday the film has been dropped.’ (AA, serial 43, 29042). Hitler’s desire for Magda Goebbels arose, as he admitted to Christa Schroeder, from her likeness to Geli Raubal. For the British embassy’s views on her see PRO file fo.371/21671; and on the divorce scandal of Oct 1938, fo.371/21665 and / 21791, and my biography Goebbels. Mastermind of the Third Reich (Focal Point, 1996), chapters 26–32.\n\npage 137 The quotation is from Jodl’s draft of Oct 19, 1938 (t77/775/0629).\n\npage 138 For the Jewish problem in Czechoslovakia after Munich, see Heinrich Bodensieck’s analysis in VfZ, 1961, 249ff. Helmut Heiber wrote a brilliant study of the unusual Grynszpan case in VfZ, 1957, 134ff. Here is not the place to explore the extraordinary manner in which the alleged assassin’s adroit French lawyer obliged the Nazis to drop their plans (in 1942) to try the case: suffice to say that Grynszpan survived the war in a concentration camp and was last known living in Paris in the 1950s.\n\npage 140 The action report is in BDC file 240/1. For the British embassy’s reports on Kristallnacht, see PRO file fo.371/21637. Again, my Goebbels. Mastermind of the Third Reich provides in chapter 32 the first fully documented inside account.\n\npage 141 The ‘igniting’ function of Goebbels’s speech that evening is clear from a Nuremberg interrogation of Ribbentrop on Sep 13, 1945, and of Julius Streicher (who had it at first hand from SA General Hanns-Günther von Obernitz); and from the report of the Party Court to Göring, Feb 13, 1939 (nd, 3063–ps). The telexes issued that night also tell their own story: at 11:55 p.m. an ‘igniting’ signal by the Gestapo, Berlin (374–ps); at 1:20 a.m. a further one by Heydrich from Munich (3052– ps); at 2:10 a.m. one by Eberstein (BDC file 240/i) to his subsidiary police commanders at Augsburg, Nuremberg, etc., expanding on 374–ps, no doubt before Eberstein’s bawling out by Hitler; and then at 2:56 a.m. the ‘extinguishing’ telex was sent out as quoted (3063–ps), and repeated to all gauleiters (BDC file 240/i). At 3:45 a.m. the Berlin Gestapo came into line (copy in Groscurth’s papers).\n\npage 141 The fury of Hitler, Göring, Himmler and even Heydrich at Goebbels’s arbitrary act is borne out in varying degree by numerous contemporary sources including – by implication – his private diary, first transcribed by me; Groscurth’s and Hassell’s diaries, Wiedemann’s 1939 manuscript on the pogrom, the unpublished memoirs of the Luftwaffe’s chief judge-advocate Christian von Hammerstein, Engel’s notes, and Likus’ report of Nov 30 (AA serial 43, 29067).\n\npage 141 The principal witnesses of events in Hitler’s apartment are Below and Schaub, the adjutants. I also used the IfZ testimonies of Karl Wolff, Max Jüttner, Wiedemann, Brückner and Engel, and Schallermeier (Wolff’saide: see IMT, xliii, 511ff.)\n\npage 142 For Hitler’s attitude on the Jewish problem at this time, see his talk with the South African minister Pirow on Nov 24, 1938 and especially with Colonel Josef Beck, the Polish foreign minister, on Jan 5, 1939. He said, ‘If the western powers had summoned up a little more understanding for Germany’s colonial demands I might have made available a territory in Africa as a solution for the Jewish problem, which could have been used to settle not only the German but also the Polish Jews…’\n\npage 143 The speech of Nov 10: see my reference to page 47.\n\npage 143 SS Brigadier Dr. Benno Martin, the Nuremberg police president, was present when Hitler made the remark at dinner on Nov 14. Weizsäcker refers to Hitler’s ‘revenge’ remark several times in his diaries – in Feb, on Mar 16, 1939, on Jan 28, 1940 and in his Oct 1939 survey of events leading to the war.\n\npage 143 Hitler’s thoughts in November are set out by Keitel in a brief dated Nov 26, sent by him to the services on Dec 1, 1938 (pg/33316 and Loesch film F19, or t120/624).\n\npage 144 One record of the Reich Defence Council session of Nov 18 is in naval files, pg/33272: a better one is Woermann’s note, on Loesch film F19 (t120/ 624). Shorthand reports of this and other sessions of the council are also in BA file Wi/IF.5.560 (NA film t77/ 131).\n\npage 146 As Krosigk emphasises (IfZ, zs.A/20), Schacht was dismissed – he did not resign. For chancellery records leading up to Schacht’s dismissal, see the Allied compilation de.482/dis.202 of Oct 26, 1945 (in HL) and 3520–ps.\n\npage 147 Hitler’s three secret speeches – of Jan 18 and 25, and Feb 10, 1939 – will be found with the transcript of his speeches of Nov 10, 1938 and Mar 11, 1939 (page 159 ) in BA file ns.11/28. For different transcripts of two of them see IfZ files F 19/10 and ed-57, together with the diaries of Groscurth, Hassell, Milch and Eberhard, and Likus’ report of Feb 2, 1939.\n\npage 154 On Hitler’s changing posture towards the USSR: interrogations of Gustav Hilger, and his memoirs Wir und der Kreml(Frankfurt, 1955); of General Ernst Köstring, the former military attaché there; of Friedrich Gaus, Ribbentrop’s legal expert; and E. M. Robertson’s early but authoritative Cabinet Office monograph, ‘Barbarossa, the Origins and Development of Hitler’s Plan to Attack Russia’ (Mar 1952).\n\npage 157 An illuminating narrative on the ‘burrowing’ by Hitler’s agents into Slovakia is CSDIC (UK) report sir.830, of Aug 28, 1944, on the interrogation of a Viennese SD officer, Neugebauer; this reveals the roles of Ribbentrop, Göring, and the SD, and their secret contacts with Durcansky, Tiso, Tuka, Karmasin, and others (na, rg.332, MisY, box 4.)\n\npage 158 I found Hewel’s note on the events on Mar 10, 1939 among his family papers. Louis Lochner also described a dinner that night with the ‘terribly preoccupied’ Ribbentrop, Heydrich and other Nazis, in a letter to his children a few days later (Lochner Papers, Wisconsin, box 47).\n\npage 160 Elisabeth Wagner, the general’s widow, lent to me about 2,000 pages of his letters – only the more innocuous parts of which she published in her book Der Generalquartiermeister.\n\npage 160 For my account of Hitler’s controversial all-night session with Hácha, I relied – apart from Hewel’s protocol – on the testimony of Keitel, Warlimont, interpreter Paul Schmidt, Keppler, Göring, Werner Kiewitz, and Schaub.\n\npage 161 Himmler’s consternation: witnessed by Keitel and Schweppenburg, who later commented that Hitler had evident personal courage: ‘On the afternoon of Mar 16, 1939, Prague was anything but a safe place for the German head of state to be.’ In a private letter Eduard Wagner – one of the 1944 plotters! – also expressed his ‘uneasiness over the Führer’s personal safety’ that day; and see Rommel’s private letter of that day (t84/R275/ 0015).\n\npage 163 Hácha’s daughter wrote thanking Hitler for his courtesy: see the Adjutantur file ns.10/18. Propaganda directives to editors are in BA file ZSg 101.\n\npage 164 Colonel Curt Siewert’s note on Hitler’s discussion with Brauchitsch, Mar 25, 1939, is nd, R–100. Referring to Stalin’s speech of Mar 10, Molotov was to remark on Aug 31, 1939: ‘It is now evident that in Germany they understood these statements of comrade Stalin correctly on the whole and drew practical conclusions from them [Laughter].’ Friedrich Gaus also testified in a Nuremberg affidavit that when Ribbentrop related to Stalin on Aug 23 how the Führer had interpreted the Mar 1939 speech as a Soviet overture, Stalin replied: ‘That was the intention’ (Jackson papers).\n\npage 165 Hitler ordered one newsreel run twice; sitting next to him, Leni Riefenstahl heard him murmur, ‘He [Stalin] looks like the kind of person one could deal with’ (interview, July 1989).\n\npage 165 The evidence that it was on Mar 31 – i.e., after the British guarantee was announced – that Hitler asked for an OKW directive on ‘White,’ is to be found in the diaries of Eberhard, Bormann and Major Wilhelm Deyhle, Jodl’s adjutant (nd, 1796–ps), and an interrogation of Warlimont. On Mar 30, Colonel Wagner wrote, ‘Tomorrow the C.-in-C. [Brauchitsch] and the Führer get back and all our briefing notes must be ready by then’; and on Apr 1, Wagner used the phrase, ‘…yesterday, when the Führer took the decision’ (gestern bei der Führerentscheidung).\n\npage 180 The extraordinary Albrecht affair occurred in June 1939, not July as the Engel ‘diary’ suggests; see Albrecht’s BDC file. By July 8, Below was already performing some of his duties (see e.g., Weizsäcker’s files, serial 97, 108413). I also drew on statements of Puttkamer, Admiral Gerhard Wagner, Karl Brandt, Vormann, and Raeder’s two adjutants, Friedrichs and Kurt Freiwald, and on the Groscurth diary. Christa Schroeder recalls telling Hitler of public criticism of the way the older Party figures were loosely divorcing their wives in favour of younger women. Hitler replied, ‘The hardest fighters deserve only the finest women!’ This enabled her to reply: ‘Oh, mein Führer, then what a beauty you ought to have!’\n\npage 181 Hitler’s attitude to the Church establishment and to religious doctrines is well illustrated in the Table Talk notes written by Heim and Bormann, and by Rosenberg’s liaison officer Koeppen in 1941 (t84/387), and the Hewel diary entries that I quote. An official circular of Dec 10, 1935 formulated, ‘The Reich Chancellor [Hitler] was born a Catholic; he still adheres to the Catholic religion, but makes no use of its amenities, e.g., regular churchgoing or religious services’ (BA file r43 ii/961). According to his doctor, Hasselbach, Hitler paid Church Tax dues to the very end (quoted in Frankenpost, Mar 12, 1947).\n\npage 185 Niemöller aroused strong passions even in 1945. The material on him includes vivid OCMH interrogations of Meissner, Krosigk, and Lammers; Engel’s notes; Likus’ reports to Ribbentrop; Hans Buchheim’s study on the Niemöller trial in VfZ, 1956, 307ff; Krosigk’s papers in the IfZ (zs.A/20), and Dr. Goebbels’s 1938 diary.\n\npage 186 For Hitler’s confrontation with Niemöller on Jan 25, 1934, I used the Göring interrogation of Jul 20, 1945, a hand-written account by Lammers and versions rendered by Krosigk and Dönitz in July 1945 (OCMH), and the Table Talk of Apr 7, 1942. See too Rosenberg’s diary, Jan 19, 1940 (Hitler said he had ‘mimicked Niemöller’s sanctimonious phraseology and then ordered the man’s earlier phone conversation – which was conducted in the crudest matelot’s jargon – to be read out loud to them. Result: embarrassed collapse of stout brethren!’) The actual FA intercept is in BA file r.43 ii/163.\n\npage 186 Many moderates considered Niemöller’s incarceration well deserved, among them Dönitz – the pastor’s former crewmate at naval academy – Lammers and Krosigk (OCMH).\n\nNiemöller was after all preaching open sedition from his pulpit. The Allied interrogators also minuted that Niemöller’s personality was ‘a matter of concern to AMG [Allied Military Government] officers.’ As late as Jul 28, 1943, Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen recorded in his diary Göring’s reflection that ‘the Führer tried just about everything to establish one Reich Church along Lutheran lines; but the obstinacy of the Church leaders thwarted every attempt.’\n\npage 187 The surreptitious preparations in Danzig are referred to in the war diaries of the Military Commander of Danzig (BA, rh.53–20/v.25) and the divisional surgeon of Eberhardt’s Kampfgruppe (BA, p.1355). See also the diary kept by Field Marshal Fedor von Bock (n.22/1), and his formal operational proposal submitted on May 27, 1939 to Brauchitsch (BA, ii–h.82 I). Himmler also outlined the role of the SS Heimwehr in Danzig in his speech of Aug 3, 1944 in VfZ, 1953, 357ff. See too Danziger Vorposten (the local Nazi newspaper).\n\npage 188 The Rechlin display is extensively covered by the Milch documents: see especially md.51/5667ff, md.62/ 5293 and /5470, md.65/7326 and / 7347 and md.56/2678.\n\npage 189 August Kubizek related the 1906 episode in his book, Adolf Hitler mein Jugendfreund (Göttingen, 1953); it was confirmed by his widow Paula in Eferding (Austria) and by Winifred Wagner, in interviews with us.\n\npage 190 Wohlthat’s report of Jul 24, 1939 is on NA special film ml/123; see also Dirksen’s report of Jul 21. The secret talks were leaked by The Daily Telegraph and News Chronicle on Jul 22 and 23. German press circulars show attempts to play them down: HL, Fritzsche papers, box 4. The best study so far is by Helmut Metzmacher in VfZ, 1966, 370ff; since then the British file on the Wohlthat mission has been released to the PRO, fo.371/22990.\n\npage 192 I rely on Lossberg’s unpublished manuscript, rather than his later book Im Wehrmachtführungsstab (Hamburg, 1949).\n\npage 193 Hitler afterwards bragged of the agent he had placed at Croydon: see Captain Wolf Junge’s unpublished manuscript (Irving Collection, IfZ).\n\npage 193 This fragment of the Lahousen diary is nd, 3047–ps.\n\npage 193 Heydrich first put the scheme to manufacture ‘border incidents’ to SS Colonel Trummler, SS Brigadier Otto Rasch and SS General Heinrich Müller – of the Gestapo – in a Berlin conference on Aug 8, 1939. The later police general Otto Hellwig was present and wrote a manuscript which is in my possession. The famous Gleiwitz operation was first adumbrated at the second conference, on or about Aug 11. See also the Hassell diary, Aug 15, and Dr. Jürgen Runzheimer’s study in VfZ, 1962, 408ff (he also supplied me with further unpublished material).\n\npage 195 The interpreter Eugen Dollmann described the scene as Hewel hurried in, in a (monitored) conversation of Jun 4, 1945 (CSDIC report cmf/x.173).\n\npage 195 Hitler’s Berghof conference of Aug 14, 1939 is referred to in the diaries of Halder, Bormann and Milch. For the pages that follow I also drew heavily on naval staff files pg/33984, pg/33979, pg/32201 and the AA files on Poland, Danzig and the outbreak of the war.\n\npage 196 For the deception methods, see the papers on Die Meistersinger (BA, Schumacher Sammlung, 368) and on the Tannenberg ceremony (md.65/ 7323). The US envoy was completely hoodwinked, cabling Washington on Aug 8 that it was ‘unlikely that any action requiring extensive use of railroad and other transportation will be launched by Germany from the latter part of Aug to middle of Sep’ (na, 740.00/2026); and see Meissner’s letter to Brückner, Aug 15 (ns.10/12), and the Party’s circular, Aug 8, 1939, detailing the uniform to be worn to the Party Rally in September (HL, Goebbels Papers, box 2.)\n\npage 196 The Jablunka tunnel and Dirschau bridge operations are well narrated in the official German monograph by Herbert Schindler, Mosty und Dirschau 1939 (Freiburg, 1971). I also used Lahousen’s diary Aug 17 et seq., and his post-war testimony, Canaris’s note on a talk with Keitel on Aug 17 (nd, 795–ps), Halder’s diary of that date and – with caution – Groscurth’s second-hand version in his diary of Aug 24; and the War Diary of the Eighth Army, Aug 31, 1939, together with an Abwehr file in the BA, OKW 74.\n\npage 199 The OKW invitation dated Aug 19 is in naval file pg/33984. Five versions were written of Hitler’s speech on Aug 22: by Halder, Albrecht, Boehm (nd, Raeder–27), Bock and Canaris (nd, 789–ps and 1014–ps); see also Groscurth’s diary, Aug 24, 1939. The speech is briefly mentioned in the diaries of Milch, Leeb and Felber (the Eighth Army’s chief of staff, n.67/2). Other versions exist, but they are of only secondary value; the lurid script played into the enemy’s hands by the Canaris/Oster circle (nd,003–l) is quite worthless. See Winfried Baumgart’s scholarly investigation in VfZ, 1968, 120ff.\n\npage 200 Hitler did not deny that the western powers might declare war (but he believed that they would not actually fight). Bock later quoted him as having said: ‘I don’t know whether the British will join in against us or not.’ Vormann was briefed by Keitel on Aug 24 that Hitler still hoped to face Poland alone; but the Führer realised that Britain and France would be hostile and might even break off diplomatic relations and start economic warfare against the Reich.\n\npage 200 The reference to crushing ‘the living daylights’ – die lebendigen Kräfte – out of Poland was misinterpreted by the Allied prosecutors at Nuremberg. In fact Hitler was just stating the basic military fact that the strategic objective was to destroy the enemy, not attain some line on a map. The professional soldiers present understood this perfectly (see, e.g., Bock’s diary). Note that Hitler used precisely the same turn of phrase in his harangue to the generals before the Battle of the Ardennes, on Dec 12, 1944 (Heiber, op. cit., 721).\n\npage 201 There are two original albums of photographs of Ribbentrop’s Moscow trip in HL, William R. Philp papers.\n\npage 202 The next day, Aug 23, 1939, Göring called an important conference with the leading Reich ministers, about which Dr. Herbert Backe – state-secretary in the food ministry – wrote privately on the thirty-first: ‘I came to Berlin on Sunday [20 Aug]. On… [23 Aug?] we were asked round to Carinhall. Göring, Funk, Darré, Körner, Landfried, myself, Behrens, Neumann, and Posse. Göring disclosed in strictest confidence to us that it has been decided to attack Poland. He asked each of us about our own war preparations. Ration cards. We have managed to keep bread and potatoes ration-free for the first four weeks because of the good supply position. Fortunately, Göring reluctantly agreed. To safeguard the element of surprise, Göring has insisted on the strictest security. Everybody’s mood was very optimistic. The attack has been set down for Friday the twenty-fifth…After Carinhall, it was obvious to me that we would only be up against Poland – i.e., there would not be a world war – and that this risk could be accepted.’\n\npage 204 For the text of Mussolini’s first letter to Hitler on Aug 25 (later cancelled), see Ciano’s letter to the King in Mussolini’s personal papers (t586/405/0237).\n\npage 205 The time – 3:02 p.m. – is recorded in the private diaries of four people present: Vormann, Weizsäcker, Halder, and Wagner. See also the war diary of Führer’s HQ (t77/858/4392ff) and Rommel’s excited letters to his wife (t84/R273a), and the naval staff war diary, 3:30 p.m.\n\npage 205 Hitler’s special train is described at length in CSDIC (UK) report sir.970, dated Sep 25, 1944.\n\npage 206 Many observers thought that after this fiasco of Aug 25, 1939, Hitler would be forced to call off ‘White’ altogether. Eduard Wagner, representative of feelings in the General Staff, wrote to his wife next day: ‘Couldn’t write last night as evening very hectic. You can calm down – as far as I can see nothing’s going to happen!’ Vormann’s letter of Aug 26 also gives a vivid picture of the previous day’s events (transcripts in Irving Collection, IfZ).\n\npage 206 Lieutenant Herzner’s handwritten account of the desperate Jablunka operation is in Günter Peis’s possession in Munich, as is Hellwig’s narrative of the last-minute cancellation of fake ‘Polish’ incidents in Upper Silesia.\n\npage 207 The FA ‘brown pages’ on Ciano’s phone call to Attolico, numbers n.125,894 and n.125,810, are to be found in an OKW file (t77/545). See also Mackensen’s papers, AA serial 100. On Italy’s posture, Göring was surprisingly sympathetic. Backe’s letter of Aug 31 continues ‘…G[öring] disclosed to us in strict confidence that Italy’s not going to join in. This is why the attack was cancelled…Now we’ve got to see how we can get out of the mess. He says that besides the Russian pact we also signed a secret deal (he told us that already once at Carinhall: it evidently partitions Poland, with Warsaw allocated to us). Göring spoke up stoutly for Mussolini and his predicament, but added that if he was a real man he would have overthrown the monarchy. A tight spot for us. War unthinkable. If we get Danzig out of it, we’ll be happy enough. Perhaps a slice of the Corridor too. Conference (Funk) concluded that new situation has a silver lining for us too, as now we won’t have any bones to pick with France, while Italy has; so if we drop Italy we have a good chance of keeping France out…. We must avoid war and try to save face.’\n\npage 208 At midnight – 26/27 Aug – Goebbels sent for Backe, ostensibly to rebuke him for the low fruit and tea rations proposed. Backe wrote, ‘Goebbels heaps exceptionally bitter criticism on the foreign ministry for over-secretiveness. Everybody knows Henderson and Coulondre have been to see the Führer, only the German radio isn’t reporting it. The upshot is that the German public is forced to listen to foreign radios. I informed him of our grim food situation…Goebbels made a brilliant impression: objective, serious, determined. He has asked [his state secretary] Gutterer to brief the Führer on the difficulties with the foreign ministry, which rather leaves the impression that he himself is being given the cold shoulder.’\n\npage 208 ‘Voices against War’: Keitel’s economics expert Georg Thomas referred, in a speech on Mar 29, 1940, to two unfavourable reports he had submitted: one warned of fuel and ammunition shortages, and called for economic mobilisation in view of the possibility of war with the western powers (possibly the document dated Aug 9, 1939 on film t77/312/4349); Hitler however responded there would be ‘no war in the west, just war with Poland.’ On Aug 26, 1939, Thomas submitted to Keitel a second report, which Keitel reluctantly forwarded to Hitler. Hitler rebuked him, ‘Won’t you ever stop pestering me about your “war in the west”!’\n\npage 208 The key British files on Dahlerus are fo.371/22974, /22982, / 22990, /34482, /39178; prem.1/ 331a; and fo.800/316: the corresponding German secret records are on NA film ml/123.\n\npage 209 As before, the FA wiretaps were all printed in my 1968 book Breach of Security. For another FA wiretap, see Halder’s diary, Aug 28: ‘Enemy knows old date (26th) and postponement. Britain and France feel unable to give way so long as our troops on frontier. Henderson working to gain time. Chamberlain shocked at personal insults.’ Among other wiretaps shown to Hitler was one resulting on the Crown Prince’s telephone at the Cecilienhof Chateau outside Potsdam. General Joachim von Stülpnagel, freshly appointed commander of the 740,000-strong reserve army, telephoned to announce his new appointment and to promise an early visit ‘to ascertain your Majesty’s orders’! Hitler sacked him that same day and replaced him with General Fritz Fromm.\n\npage 209 No transcript of his speech to the Reichstag deputies has been found, but it is outlined adequately in the diaries of Halder, Groscurth, Hassell and Weizsäcker and mentioned in Backe’s letter of Aug 31. See also Rudolf Likus’ report of Aug 27 (AA serial 43, 29617). As for Hitler’s private intentions towards the USSR, the Gestapo official Dr. Werner Best recalled later, ‘After the Moscow pact was signed on Aug 23, word was passed round “internally” that we were not to be deceived by it – in two years at most the war against Russia would begin’ (IfZ, zs.207). Hassell, too, commented on Oct 11, 1939, ‘It’s highly possible – indeed quite probable since Hitler’s speech to the Reichstag deputies – that deep down he’s saving himself up for an attack on the Soviet Union.’\n\npage 210 The date of the sixteen-point proposals is not clear. The copy in Ribbentrop’s office file is marked Aug 28, 1939. Other sources suggest it originated next day.\n\npage 212 I publish this FA intercept in Breach of Security. Shorn of its FA security heading, the transcript is also in Ribbentrop’s office file (serial 43, 29636).\n\npage 214 The war of the ‘illegals’ is highlighted in the war diaries of the Military Commander of Danzig, and of Frontier Defence Command (Sector 3), in BA file e.271/1. For the role of the SA Brownshirts, see Viktor Lutze’s letter to Brauchitsch, Oct 13, 1939 (rh.i/ v.58) and the Oct 6, 1943 speech of his successor Wilhelm Schepmann (t175/ 119/5023ff).\n\npage 218 Goebbels’s memorandum is in BA file ns.10/37\n\npage 223 Colonel Eduard Wagner echoed Vormann’s awe in a letter of Sep 4. ‘Even so not a shot has been fired in the west yet, a funny war so far.’ Apart from reference to the published sources, I based my account of the Polish campaign on the diaries of Jodl, Bock, Halder, Helmuth Groscurth, Milch, Vormann, the naval staff, Wagner, Lahousen. Rosenberg, and the commandant of Hitlers HQ; and on interrogations of Hans von Greiffenberg, Blaskowitz, Göring, Dönitz, Scheidt, Warlimont and Keitel. On Wilhelm Scheidt (deputy chief historian to the OKW) see Seventh Army interrogation in na, rg.407, box 1954-I.\n\npages 225–226 Professor Martin Broszat’s Nationalsozialistische Polenpolitik 1939–1945 (Stuttgart, 1961). On the Bromberg massacre see the war diary of Rear Army Command 580 (General Braemer) in BA files (P.824), and of the Military Commander of West Prussia (RH53–20/v. 16). Kreisleiter Werner Kampe, appointed lord mayor of Bromberg with the job of ‘extracting compensation for ethnic Germans who suffered Polish atrocities,’ swindled the victims out of millions of marks to benefit befriended Party and civic officials (BA file r22/4087). About seven thousand Germans were massacred by the Poles in Bromberg.\n\npage 227 Three copies of Canaris’s memorandum of Sep 12, 1939, exist: one in the ‘Canaris–Lahousen fragments’ – a hitherto neglected file of key documents and extracts from the Canaris diary (al/1933); one in Groscurth’s papers (n.104/3); and an abbreviated copy in Lahousen’s IMT file (3047–ps); cf. Lahousen’s pre-trial interrogation of Sep 19, 1945, and Vormann’s diary, Sep 12, 1939: ‘Göring and Brauchitsch here at Ilnau. Canaris on account of Polish population.’\n\npage 229 Heydrich’s RSHA (Reich Main Security Office) conferences (on NA film t175/239); Heydrich’s related memorandum of May 1941 in VfZ, 1963,\n\npage 197; and Heydrich’s frank memorandum of Jul 1940, in Kurt Daluege’s papers (BA, r.19), on the role of his task forces.\n\npage 230 The purge in Poland: I used W. Huppenkothen’s 1945 essays, in BDC files; a CSDIC interrogation of Udo von Woyrsch; Dr. Rudolf Lehmann’s testimony; Halder’s diary; Heydrich’s conferences; and Klaus-Jürgen Müller’s Das Heer und Hitler (Stuttgart, 1969). The three colonels were Groscurth, Vormann and Wagner respectively – the latter after a discussion with Brauchitsch. The flavour of the General Staff’s joint planning with Heydrich on Poland also emerges from Colonel Wagner’s private letter of Sep 18, 1939: ‘Problems of extreme political impact which have got to be discussed secretly with the C.-in-C. and Halder: this calls for no mean callousness, which I appear to possess.’ And see General Heitz’s note on the instructions Hitler issued to him on Sep 20 at Danzig: (1) Don’t shed unnecessary blood to capture Hela; don’t make martyrs. Hela must fall sooner or later. (2) Inflexible harshness in pacifying the country. (3) Further confidential instructions.’ What can have been too confidential to commit to the War Diary?\n\npage 232 I portray the capitulation of the Warsaw garrison from the war diaries of Eighth Army and Army Group North.\n\npage 234 I reconstructed the history of Hitler’s euthanasia order from the interrogations of doctors Brandt, Conti, and Lammers, and the Nuremberg testimony of Viktor Brack, a section head (Amtsleiter) of the Führer’s chancellery in Berlin; see too the report by a nephew of Pastor von Bodelschwingh in PRO file wo.208/4174. The two studies by Hans Buchheim and Klaus Dörner in VfZ, 1967, page 121, and by Lothar Gruchmann, VfZ, 1972, page 235 et seq. are of unsound chronology. There are several justice ministry files on euthanasia in the BA, e.g., r.22/993, / 4209 and /5021. In the latter is a protest from Bishop Wurm on Sep 5, 1940: ‘Does the Führer know what’s going on? Has he given his approval?’ In a memo of Nov 1, 1940 even Heydrich was said to dissociate himself: ‘My security police have nothing to do with the operation that has meantime been started, it’s Reichsleiter Bouhler.’\n\npage 241 Apart from the Rosenberg and Groscurth diaries, for the curious mission of W.R. Davis see Wohlthat’s record of the discussion between Davis and Göring on Oct 1 on NA film ml/ 123 (CO file al/1506), together with the unpublished reports of the Dahlerus missions; Davis’s letters to Roosevelt, Oct 11 and 12, Adolph R. Berle’s diary (Oct 5, 6, and 7) and Roosevelt’s diary, confirming that he met with Davis on Sep 15, are in FDRL. For John L. Lewis, see na, rg.319, box 131: x.8516601.\n\npage 241 The Polish documents were published by Ribbentrop’s ministry as a White Book in April 1940; he had shown some to Mussolini in Mar. He and Göring mentioned them under interrogation in 1945. Adam Potocki, Polish ambassador in Washington, dismissed them as forgeries, but the carbon copies of the originals, in his papers in HL, prove them genuine.\n\npage 243 Rommel wrote on Oct 8: ‘It’s very pleasing that Paris and London are already openly discussing Hitler’s speech. The neutral voices are without exception in favour. I was at his conference for an hour and a half yesterday. The Führer is in best of moods, and confident.’ For Dahlerus’s reports, see PRO files fo.800/317, fo.371/ 23011, /23097, /23098, /23099. Hitler’s attitude is reflected by a letter written by Hewel on Oct 14 to an English acquaintance: ‘How often have I heard the Führer say, “Can Britain really be living so remote from the realities of European life as not to see the problems as they are?” I myself attended the conversations between the Führer and Henderson, in which this sick old man spoke such rubbish that the Führer finally came to the conclusion that Britain has no other ambition than the destruction of Germany.’ Hewel continued: ‘Every day the Führer and I read the British newspapers together, and we … just can’t credit that there can be so many lies and falsehoods.’\n\npage 246 Keitel’s notes on Oct 17, 1939 are preserved (864–ps); further versions are in Groscurth’s files (n.104/ 3) and diary, Oct 18; Hassell’s diary, Dec 30, and Halder’s diary, and a private letter of Wagner, Oct 18. Under interrogation Halder identified Canaris as his source (IMT interrogation, Feb 27, 1946; cf. grgg.3326C, Aug 7, 1945).\n\npage 247 Martin Bormann noted Hitler’s speech in his diary, Oct 21: ‘Reichsleiters and gauleiters to supper with Führer. After the meal the Führer gives them a picture of the situation, speaks for two and a half hours.’ See too Groscurth’s dubious version (n.104/3 and ml/123); in August 1940 Admiral Canaris remarked that ‘already in a 1938 [sic] speech to the gauleiters in Berlin’ Hitler had spoken of a campaign against Russia (hand-written testimony of Lieut. Gen. Franz von Bentivegni, Canaris’s section chief, Sep 28, 1945).\n\npage 250 Hitler was the original author of the strategy finally used in France. Professor H. A. Jacobsen, in Wehrwissenschaftlicher Rundschau, 1955, pages 433 et seq., concludes that Manstein’s staffwork assured the subsequent triumph of Hitler’s plan.\n\npage 253 The earlier assassination attempts are touched on in Hitler’s Table Talk on Sep 6, 1941 (Koeppen’s note) and May 3, 1942 (Heim’s note); Bavaud was beheaded in May 1942.\n\npage 254 Dr. Anton Hoch, in VfZ, 1969, pages 383 et seq., demolished the post-war legends by drawing upon the Gestapo interrogation of Georg Elser, the lone assassin (now in BA file r22/ 3100). I also used the diaries of Bormann and Groscurth, the day’s detailed programme (ns.10/126), and testimonies of Below, Grolmann, Schaub, and Baron Karl von Eberstein. The Gestapo finally listed eight dead and sixty-three injured (t175/473/4876). The trials of Elser and his former employer, whose negligence had enabled him to steal the quarry explosives, were adjourned sine die (file R22/4087), and Elser was executed in April 1945.\n\npage 255 Jodl’s diary and post-war testimony, coupled with his adjutant Wilhelm Deyhle’s notes (1786–ps), show that until Nov 13 Hitler was convinced he could amicably come to terms with Holland. An entry in the diary of Halder’s Intelligence chief, General Kurt von Tippelskirch (BA file ii H36/ 1), on Nov 12 proves that it was Hitler who ordered the kidnapping of the two British agents; he decorated the SS officers at a chancellery ceremony two days later (BDC file on SS Major Helmuth Knochen). British MI6 agent S. Payne Best’s papers are in HL.\n\npage 256 Admiral von Puttkamer told me of the Ardennes relief map; it was also seen by Lahousen in the chancellery on Nov 20, 1939, as he testified under interrogation six years later. Hitler himself referred to the relief map ‘we used at that time in Berlin’ in a war conference on Sep 17, 1944 (Heiber, page 660).\n\npage 257 The two Abwehr officers were Captain Fleck and Lieutenant Hokke, according to the diaries of Groscurth, Lahousen, Jodl and Halder. Lahousen noted: ‘The Führer has asked for every demolition charge’s ignitionhole [Zündloch] to be described to him.’ A record of the conference of Nov 20, 1939, is in al/1933.\n\npage 258 The best records of Hitler’s harangue of Nov 23, 1939 are in Leeb’s diary and nd, 789–ps, which agrees well with a text in Groscurth’s files (n.104/3). I also found summaries in the diaries of Colonel Hoffmann von Waldau, Bock, and Halder. General Hoth used it as the basis for a speech to the Fifteenth Army Corps’ generals (BA file W.2005/2), and Admiral Raeder likewise for his section heads (pg/ 31762a).\n\npage 264 I have been unable to resolve the conflict of evidence on Quisling’s two meetings with Hitler in December 1939. Jodl’s diary dates one the 13th; Raeder’s note on Rosenberg’s memo dates it the 14th; Rosenberg’s diary dates it the 15th; the otherwise very informative survey drawn up by his Aussenpolitisches Amt (ns.43/25) states with equal confidence ‘Quisling was received for a personal audience by the Führer on the 16th and again on the 18th.’\n\npage 265 Raeder’s adjutant (Freiwald) recalls that as they left the chancellery he hinted they might at least add to the signal, ‘I wish you a safe further voyage.’ Raeder refused however.\n\npage 267 Professor Broszat covered some of the ground on Hitler’s Polish policies (see my note to pages 225– 226). I also used the Groscurth, Halder, and Milch diaries; Frank’s verbatim remarks at a police conference on May 30, 1940 (2233–ps); an SS investigation of Soldau (no–1073); testimony of General von Gienanth – Blaskowitz’s successor – and Karl Wolff; and documents in chancellery files BA, r.43 ii/1332 and /1411a. Himmler’s notes are on NA microfilm t175/94.\n\npage 268 For the case of the magistrate – Otto Christian von Hirschfeld – see the Reich justice ministry file BA, r 22/4087 and Lammers’ memo in file r.43 ii/1411a.\n\npage 271 The 922-page ledger kept by Walther Hewel of the diplomatic papers submitted to Hitler from Jan 1940 to Aug 1942 is in AA files; it lists many of the Forschungsamt’s intercepts, including for example a decoded Belgian telegram of Feb 11, 1940, reporting Ciano’s comments to the Belgian envoy in Rome. For evidence that Ciano betrayed ‘Yellow’ to the Belgians see Groscurth’s diary of Jan 2, and Halder’s diary. On the seventh General Halder noted: ‘Other side knows date’; and next day Major Hasso von Etzdorf told him of a ‘telegram (Kerchove).’ The latter was Belgian envoy in Rome. On Jan 18, Weizsäcker wrote to Mackensen in Rome: ‘I believe Herr von Ribbentrop has briefed you about certain goingson between Rome and Brussels.’ (AA, serial 100, pages 64885 et seq.). On Jan 22, Halder’s Intelligence chief wrote in his diary: ‘It[alian] betrayal to Belg[ians] of German intentions and preparations.’\n\npage 271 The report by Halder’s Intelligence chief (Tippelskirch) on Belgium is in the files of Foreign Armies West (al/1329).\n\npage 272 My account of the affair is based on Jacobsen’s study in WR, 1954, pages 497 et seq., Jean Vanwelkenhuyzen, ibid., 1955, pages 66 et seq., and the diaries of Jodl, Halder, Groscurth, Milch, Hassell, and Deyhle; on the Weizsäcker file on Belgium; and on interrogations of Göring and Below. About a dozen damning fragments did survive the flames; the general geography of ‘Yellow’ could be deduced from them. ‘On Day 1 of the attack’ the Eighth Air Corps’ job would be to destroy the Belgian army west of the Meuse ‘in close co-operation with the Sixth Army Schwerpunkt at and west of Maastricht.’ The 7th Air Division (paratroops) had targets at Namur and Dinant. Another fragment stated: ‘Additionally it is intended to occupy Holland…’\n\npage 273 A postcard written by the Luftwaffe adjutant on May 14, 1940, confirms that Hitler struck on the victorious strategy in 1939: ‘I hinted at it to you at Christmas,’ Colonel von Below reminded his uncle. The date of Schmundt’s visit to Manstein is fixed by the diary of Frau Schmundt. Hitler instructed Schmundt to send secretly for Manstein, without informing either Brauchitsch or Halder. After meeting Hitler, Manstein marvelled in his own diary: ‘What an extraordinary conformity with my own views!’ According to Warlimont (MS P–215) Hitler saw the general off with the words: ‘Manstein is the only person to see what I’m getting at.’\n\npage 274 Several accounts exist of Hitler’s dinner on Feb 17, 1940 – Manstein’s, Rommel’s private letter (t84/R273a/0866), and General Geyr von Schweppenburg’s (IfZ, zs.680).\n\npage 275 On the Altmark affair I relied on the naval staff’swar diary and its case file (pg/33730) – with its full-length report by the captain – the Jodl diary, and Weizsäcker’s and Ernst Woermann’s AA files. On the legal aspects, see Heinz Knackstedt, in WR, 1959, pages 391 and 466 et seq., and the study by the US Naval War College in International Law Situation and Documents, 1956, pages 3 et seq.\n\npage 276 I based my account of the developing plan to invade Norway on the diaries of Milch, Jodl, Halder, Tippelskirch, and the naval staff. Raeder’s powerful support is clear in the latter diary entry on Mar 2, 1940, for example. I also employed the war diary of the army’s XXI Gruppe (BA file E, 180/ 5), and Raeder’s post-war manuscripts, ‘My Relations with Adolf Hitler’ and ‘The Occupation of Norway on Apr 9, 1940’ (nd, 1546–ps).\n\npage 277 For the Allies’ attempts to prolong the Russo-Finnish war, see the naval staff war diary, Mar 8–14, 1940. Weizsäcker hinted at the FA’s coup in his diary of Mar 13, noting that the western powers had offered empty promises to Finland: ‘We have hard evidence of this.’ After Ribbentrop disclosed the Finnish envoy’s message, in his White Book published on Apr 27, Dr. Pakaslahti, chief of the Finnish’s FO’s political department, cabled the envoy in Paris – Harri Holma – on May 14, identifying the telephone call intercepted as that at 3:30 p.m. on Mar 12 (Finnish FO archives, 109/C2e, Tel. R. 145). The call is mentioned in the diary of Finnish Foreign Minister Väinö Tanner (see his memoirs, Olin ulkoministerinätalvisodan aikana, Helsinki, 1950,\n\npage 387). Ulrich Kittel – one of the Forschungsamt’s section heads – confirmed the whole episode in zs.1734.\n\npage 279 According to the Hewel Ledger (see my note to page 271) two FA reports on the Italian talks with Sumner Welles were submitted to Hitler. Hewel endorsed the entry as follows: ‘The Führer has instructed that the Italians are to be handed a protocol on the Sumner Welles talks with the Führer and the foreign minister [on Mar 2] conforming in length and content to that supplied by the Italians.’ This mistrust was also plain in Hitler’s directive on Apr 4 on strategic co-operation with Italy (pg/33316): ‘Neither “Yellow” nor “Weserübung” [the invasion of Scandinavia] are to be discussed in any form before the operations begin.’\n\npage 279 Apart from the German transcript, we have Mooney’s own report on the meeting, in a lengthy telegram to Roosevelt on Mar 17 (‘The President had disclosed to me that he was not interested in saying to the German people what they should do about their leaders or their government – that was their own affair.’ Roosevelt had asked him to tell Hitler he was willing to act as ‘moderator’; Hitler had responded he ‘would be able to reach an agreement with President Roosevelt in ten minutes.’) FDRL: PSF box 4.\n\npage 280 In his speech to commanders on Apr 1, 1940, Hitler described their relations with Russia at present as favourable; but how long this would remain so could never be predicted (Appendix to war diary of XXI Gruppe).\n\npage 282 Hitler referred to the incautious utterances of Churchill and Reynaud in conversation with the Norwegian envoy Arne Scheel and the Swedish admiral Fabian Tamm on Apr 13 and 16; in a letter to Mussolini on the 26th; and in his famous Reichstag speech of Jul 19, 1940; see also his remarks in Table Talk, Jul 1, 1942, evening.\n\npage 283 The FA intercept is reported in the naval staffwar diary, Apr 7, 1940. I also read the testimony of Major Sas (zs.1626).\n\npage 285 The naval attaché in Oslo lectured the naval staff in Berlin on Apr 21 that Norway would return to normal only if Hitler directed the troops to adopt the slogan ‘We come as your friends to protect Norway’ and did not attempt to repeat ‘the Poland method’ there. For the situation created by the king’s defection, see Weizsäcker’s and Hassell’s diaries, and the report by one of Rosenberg’s staff to Schmundt on Apr 17 (ns.43/25) and Hitler’s talk with Quisling on Aug 18 (ng–2948).\n\npage 286 Warlimont ordered Lossberg to write an account of Hitler’s nervous actions for the OKW diary. Schmundt was aghast; as Lossberg later wrote: ‘He felt it was sacrilege to write down one of the ostensibly infallible Führer’s weak moments in black and white.’ The page was stricken from the official diary text. To get behind the scenes at the OKW, I used not only Jodl’s diary and Deyhle’s notes of Apr 24 (1781–ps) but also manuscripts by Lossberg and by the navy captains Wolf Junge and Heinz Assmann on Jodl’s staff, and interviews of Baron Sigismund von Falkenstein (his Luftwaffe staff officer) and General Ottomar Hansen (Keitel’s adjutant).\n\npage 288 Details of the British documents captured in Norway can be reconstructed from Jodl’s diary, Apr 23– 27; from the naval staff diary, Apr 27; from Hitler’s letter to Mussolini on the 26th and from Goebbels’s remarks at his ministerial conference the same day and on May 3 and 19; from Colonel Wagner’s private letter of May 7; and from the AA’s White Book on Apr 27, 1940.\n\npage 290 On the FA intercepts, see Jodl’s diary, the testimony of Sas, and Hermann Graml’s study of the Oster affair in VfZ, 1966, pages 26 et seq. On May 8, 1940, there is also a cryptic reference in Tippelskirch’s diary to alerts proclaimed in the Low Countries: ‘Luxembourg: Telephone conversation [overheard on] May 6: ‘Are they coming or aren’t they?”’ In the AA files of Ambassador von Mackensen (Rome) is extensive correspondence from May 17, 1940, to Jul 28, 1941, relating to the SD’s attempts to identify the German citizen in Rome who had tipped off the Vatican’s Father Robert Leiber, SJ, about ‘Yellow’ deadlines.\n\npage 296 General von Trotha provided me with original documents. I also used the war diary of the Führer’s HQ, diaries of Jodl and Tippelskirch, Hitler’s Table Talk, Oct 17–18, 1941 (Heim’s note), and Gerhard Schacht’s study on Eben Emael in WR, 1954, pages 217 et seq.\n\npage 298 The definitive account of the Luftwaffe attack on Rotterdam is still Professor H. A. Jacobsen’s, in WR, 1958, pages 257 et seq.; and see Kesselring’s interrogation by the USSBS.\n\npage 301 That it never occurred to Hitler that the British army was decamping from Dunkirk and leaving the French in the lurch has escaped most historians; it is hinted at by Ulrich Liss – chief of Foreign Armies West at the time – in WR, 1958, pages 325 et seq., but neither Jacobsen (in Allg. Schweizerische Militärzeitschrift, 1953, page 845 and elsewhere) nor H. Meier-Welcker, in VfZ, 1954, pages 274 et seq., nor the British official historians L. F. Ellis and J. R. M. Butler grasped this point. The entry in the diary of Tippelskirch on May 31 – ‘what picture emerged over the last few days to suggest that the British and French were embarking by sea?’ – suggests that the belated search for a scapegoat was beginning.\n\npage 301 That the initial decision to halt the tanks was Rundstedt’s – and only subsequently given Hitler’s blessing – is proven by the war diary of Rundstedt’s Army Group A. Rundstedt indignantly denied it after the war, but the facts are plain. Late on May 24 an impatient Halder radioed permission to Army Groups A and B to attack Dunkirk. Rundstedt (Army Group A) refused, as ‘the mechanised groups must first be allowed to pull themselves together.’ His operations officer, Blumentritt, marked the file copy of Halder’s signal, ‘Submitted to OC [Rundstedt] and Chief of Staff, but not forwarded to Fourth Army as Führer wants OC Army Group A to decide.’ This did not prevent Bock (diary) and Fourth Army (war diary, May 27) from attributing the order to Hitler. I also used the diaries of Jodl, Richthofen, Waldau, and Halder; the interrogations of Halder, Kesselring, Scheidt, Jodl, Warlimont, Rundstedt and Heusinger; and the memoirs of Keitel, Lossberg and Junge.\n\npage 303 Himmler’s written proposal for dealing with the eastern populations is in his files (t175/119/5133 et seq.). The document was rediscovered twenty years later by Christopher R. Browning in his Paths to Genocide (Canto edition, 1995), page 17. Himmler, he says, noted that ‘the Führer read the six pages through and found them very good and correct.’ Himmler’s notes for the meeting with Hitler give a good impression of his varied interests. ‘(1) Chief of SS and Police for Holland: Bach or Rauter? (“Warmly approves of Rauter, because Austrian”). (2) Pistol with spotlights. (3) Identity photos (Waffen SS). (4) Book by Divinger, Atrocities in Poland. (5) Memorandum on Poland. (“Not yet read”). (6) Legal proceedings against [British agents] Best and Stevens. (“Führer will fix the date”)’ (t175/94/ 5221). A genesis of these ideas will be found in Himmler’s speech notes of Mar 13, 1940. For Hitler’s broadly similar views, note his remark in Table Talk, Feb 4, 1942 (Heim’s note): ‘Wherever in the world there is some Germanic blood, we’ll be taking the best of it for ourselves.’\n\npage 304 My account of Hitler’s speech of Jun 2 at Charleville is based on Leeb’s diary; but also on the accounts by Rommel, Weichs, Bock and Salmuth. See too Blumentritt’s, grgg.313(C).\n\npage 305 For Leopold’s fury, see Army Group B’s telex to the OKH on May 31, 1940 (Weizsäcker’s AA files, serial 141).\n\npage 306 Hitler’s caustic comments about Italy were reported by General Thomas (1456–ps), Weizsäcker in a letter of Jun 5 and diary Jul 10, Junge and Puttkamer.\n\npage 307 The only record of Hitler’s private talk with Mussolini is in Italian, in the Duce’s handwriting (Mussolini papers, T586/406/769 et seq.). He talked with Hitler about the French fleet, but Hitler had persuaded him that modern bombers rendered big warships obsolete. ‘Since France wanted this war and declared it on us, despite my repeated offers of agreement,’ continued Hitler, ‘my terms will be such as to solve once and for all the outstanding problems’ – and he pointed to the Colmar– Mühlhausen area on the map, indicating that the present (German) inhabitants of the South Tyrol would be resettled there. For Russia Hitler expressed only ‘enormous contempt.’ He concluded: ‘Now Germany can be compared with a lucky and audacious gambler, who has kept winning but kept on doubling his stake. Now he is a little bit nervous – and wants to take home his winnings quickly.’ Waldau’s diary, Jun 20, reports that the Führer returned to HQ ‘bitterly upset about the complete inactivity of the Italians.’\n\npage 307 Admiral Puttkamer heard – and told me of – Hitler’s refusal to Raeder to assign the French fleet to Germany.\n\npage 307 In Weizsäcker’s files is a detailed list of all the ‘insulting and degrading conditions of the Versailles Treaty’ drawn up for comparative purposes (serial 1892H).\n\npage 308 Hitler had learnt the dimensions of the world’s principal theatres by heart, from the British architect Sachs’s Modern Opera Houses and Theatres.\n\npage 309 Telegrams of congratulation are in files ns.10/18 and /19.\n\npage 310 Canaris reported his talk with Hitler on Jun 11 (t77/1450/ 0899).\n\npage 311 On Jul 1, 1940, one of Ribbentrop’s officials learned that ‘the Führer has directed that as little as possible is to be committed to paper about the whole business’ – meaning his secret plans for annexing French territory. The official promptly wrote this down (Weizsäcker’s files, serial 1892H). A well-informed study is Pierre Crenesse, Le Procès de Wagner (Paris, 1946). See the naval staff diary, Jun 2, 1940, and Goebbels’s unpublished diary, May 30, 1942 – Hitler told him that Brabant, Belgium, and Flanders were to become German Gaue and that the Netherlands and France were to be thrown back to ‘the frontiers of 1500.’\n\npage 312 Streckenbach is quoted verbatim in Hans Frank’s diary, Jul 31, 1940. On the Madagascar plan see Hitler’s conference with Raeder on Jun 20, 1940. On the 24th Heydrich wrote reminding Ribbentrop that he had been promoting Jewish emigration on Göring’s instructions since Jan 1939; two hundred thousand had already emigrated, and he asked the AA to inform him should there be any conferences on the ‘Final Solution of the Jewish Problem.’ In fact an AA file with this title had existed since 1938, serial 1513. Ribbentrop’s staff had pressed him since Jun 3 at least to lay down Germany’s policy on Jews – for example they might all be excluded from Europe; or the eastern Jews might be sorted out from the western Jews; or they might be given a national home in Palestine. On the Madagascar idea see inter alia Rademacher’s AA memo of Jul 3; Goebbels diary, Jul 26; Hitler’s talk with Ambassador Abetz on Aug 3 (ng– 1838); Luther’s AA memo of Aug 15, 1940, and again of Aug 21, 1942 (‘The RSHA enthusiastically adopted the Madagascar plan’); and Hitler’s talk with Count Teleki on Nov 20, 1940.\n\npage 313 According to Curt Siewert, Brauchitsch’s staff officer, it was Brauchitsch who first egged Hitler on to tackle Russia (IfZ, zs.345). Late on Jun 21, 1940, the AA cabled the military attaché in Moscow to be on guard for the first signs of Russian aggression against Romania, as Halder was ‘urgently interested.’ See J. W. Brügel’s study on the Soviet ultimatum to Romania, in VfZ, 1963, pages 404 et seq.\n\npage 315 Many of the captured French documents were published in an AA White Book on the origins of the air war in 1943. Many are now in Weizsäcker’s AA files, serial 121, page 119942. See the files of Woermann, ‘War West II,’ for 104 more of the captured Allied documents.\n\npage 316 Invited by British officers to comment on his diary, Halder volunteered, re Jul 2, 1940 (‘The Commander in Chief has flown to Berlin’) the remark: ‘About this time Commander in Chief, Army, asked me to begin operational thinking about Russia.’ Re the entry of Jul 3 (‘Greiffenberg must take over as my deputy [O.Qu.I]’), Halder commented for the British: ‘For the planned operation in Russia.’ The political situation was already acute, as the naval staff diary, Jul 5, demonstrates. ‘Early further advances by Russians feared, objective: Bolshevisation of the Balkans…’ Halder’s frank commentary proves that the General Staff showed more interest in attacking Russia than has hitherto been supposed.\n\npage 316 Lossberg described the origins of his study for a Russian campaign (‘Fritz’) in a private letter of Sep 7, 1956. He had omitted this from his memoirs (‘which were heavily altered by the publishers anyway’); Greiner, the OKW war diarist, had urged him to make Hitler appear solely responsible. In a speech to gauleiters on Nov 7, 1943 (nd, 172–L) Jodl admitted: ‘The Führer himself…apprised me as early as during the western campaign of his fundamental decision to tackle this [Soviet] danger as soon as our military situation made it at all possible.’\n\npage 316 Lossberg, Jodl, and Puttkamer all stressed that Hitler perceived a need to tackle Russia while the German people were still in the mood. On Feb 17, 1941, Halder quoted Hitler as saying, ‘If Britain were finished, he would never manage to summon up the German nation against Russia again; so Russia must be dealt with first.’ As Hitler said in his famous speech of Dec 12, 1944, ‘You can’t extract enthusiasm and self-sacrifice like something tangible, and bottle them and preserve them. They are generated just once in the course of a revolution, and will gradually die away.’\n\npage 316 His refusal to unleash the Luftwaffe against England appears in many documents. Major von Etzdorf noted on Jul 10, 1940: ‘Britain, three options: Air war: Führer opposed, as desires to draw up fresh requests; foreign minister in favour. Blockade: Führer in favour, hopes for effect within two and a half months. [Peace] offer: Reichstag has been postponed sine die…’ And Tippelskirch noted similarly that Hitler was weighing several possibilities: ‘Fresh rubble heaps [i.e., bombing war]; intensification of blockade? – Two months [suffice]. Ri[bbentrop] tougher line. Late autumn Russia?’ On Jul 16, Major Etzdorf noted: ‘Britain: common sense may have to be bludgeoned into them.’\n\npage 318 I used Walter Schellenberg’s unpublished memoirs – the handwriting is daunting but not illegible – and the Tippelskirch diary, Jul 11, 1940, in following the Duke of Windsor episode.\n\npage 318 The most important FA intercepts were communicated to the German ambassador in Moscow and are in his embassy’s files; remarkably, most have not been published. Echoes of them can be traced in the Etzdorf, Halder, and Tippelskirch diaries. A summary of them will be found in Pol. V files in AA archives, serial 104, pages 113176 et seq.\n\npage 319 OKW files reflect the economic chaos caused by the withdrawal of barges for invasion preparations. By Jul 22 a thousand German barges had been requisitioned, and nine hundred more in Holland and Belgium (t77/ 201/7513).\n\npage 306 On Jul 15, 1940, Papen warned that Stalin had 180 divisions available. General Halder’s experts were more optimistic; Colonel Eberhard Kinzel (Foreign Armies East) allowed the Russians 20 infantry, 4 cavalry and 4 mechanised divisions or brigades in Poland; 20 infantry, 4 cavalry divisions and 6 mechanised brigades in the Baltic states; 15 infantry divisions in Finland; and 15 infantry, 9 cavalry divisions and 10 mechanised brigades in the annexed part of Romania (al/ 1367).\n\npage 321 Hitler’s private meeting with Jodl was certainly between Jul 27 and 30. I relied on Jodl’s various post-war accounts and on what he told his staff – Warlimont, Lossberg, Falkenstein, and Junge.\n\npage 323 According to the – unpublished – dispatch of the German minis"
