        "text": "[doffy backstory/dressrosa spoilers - im not done yet so some of this might be off. i just have many many thoughts, excuse the rambling]\n\ndoflamingo has officially become my favorite villain in one piece, the fact that this man has been fucked in the head since birth is so fascinating to me. the contrast between him and his his brother, how they grew up in the same environment but ended up completely opposite. while rosinante became a fighter for good, going undercover for the navy, doflamingo became a force of destruction, oppression and power. doffy doesn't care how he does it as long as he gains the power he lost when he was like 10 years old. the terrible and inhumane lifestyle of the celestial dragons was too ingrained, too perfect for doffy's wants and needs. when he lost that luxury and privilege, he refused to understand WHY his parents could ever want to give up being a celestial dragon, while rosinante, being empathetic and kind, quickly understood that the pain they endured at the hands of the people was because of the way their family had treated them. we know that doffy knew this as well, because law caught him in exactly that:\n\nhe slipped up. he's always known what he was doing was terrible. this idea of \"family\" is just a front - he doesn't care, he killed his dad because it was his fault doffy got beaten and humiliated, he killed his brother because he went against him, and he'd kill everyone else who got in his way too. the moment they're not useful to him, he will drop the act. that's why rosinante died - he thought his brother still loved him. he didn't, probably never did. doflamingo just wants to watch the world burn after the \"common folk\" made a fool of him when he was a rotten, spoiled child. he grew up in wealth, then in poverty, he's been on both sides, which makes his speech in marineford so much more powerful.\n\ntldr; doflamingo is, and always has been, a psychopath looking for ways to rule so he can oppress the people he deems unworthy so he can flourish in wealth and power. he is a selfish, awful man who thrives watching people squirm under him. he truly sees himself as a god.\n\nI always find it intriguing how everyone interprets stories and characters differently.\n\nFirst off, it's gonna sound as if I'm defending Doffy, only a little bit, but that's not really what I'm trying to do. I don't think the way Doffy evolved to be who he is was that straightforward, and I also don't think he wants to watch the world burn simply because he lost the luxurious lifestyle he had in Mariejois.\n\nI think Oda tried to tell a story of how people around you impact who you are. And he chose to show it through contrast. And the contrast is not between Doffy and Cora, but Doffy and Law, btw.\n\nSo you watch Doffy (let's keep Cora in mind as well) try to adapt to a polar opposite of what he knew his whole life. He only knew comfort, was spoiled and got everything he pointed a finger at. Now, what happens? He discovers pain, and lots of it. Now, what does he experience? Everybody rejects him, he's starving, being abused by everyone, loses a parent - a small child dealing with the death of a parent, just that alone - and ultimately, he feels betrayed.\n\nHis father, a parent, was supposed to keep him safe and happy, but what did he do in the end? (Let's not pretend none of us ever blamed someone just as childishly) He caused both of the boys nothing but suffering. Can't stress it enough: that's obviously not a reason to kill your dad.\n\nBut - and this is crucial - who gives Doffy that gun? Trebol, and what does he also do? He, not just verbally, but also by his actions, validates Doffy's feelings of hatred. He tells him that yes, you're right in hating everyone, the world and everybody in it failed you, they deserve all of your hate and fury, you're in the right, you are in the right.\n\nSo he shoots his father. Afterall, he's a traumatised, nearly deranged child, easily manipulated; because for the first time since he left Mariejois, someone accepted the kid, someone has shown him compassion and most importantly, told him what he wanted to hear - that he was above everyone.\n\nThat was the turning point for Doffy I'd say.\n\nAnd now the contrast. Law seeks out the Family, not like in Doffy's case where it was the other way around. But he's the same - hates everyone and everything because guess what? He lost everything, was betrayed and is rejected by everyone.\n\nI like to think of the white illness as of a metaphor for Law's pain and hatred. Cora decides to save the kid. Here's the difference:\n\nDoflamingo has spent his life being told that he's basically a God. (It must be awfuly lonely up there too, I think.) Noone shows him the right way, the better way.\n\nLaw is being shown the ultimate of human virtues, within it a way of life, the better way, and y'know, Oda says it basically explicitly:\n\nlove is the only way.\n\nSo, to conclude, does that mean I think Doffy wouldn't have turned out to be like we know him if he didn't run into Trebol?\n\nWholeheartedly YES.\n\nAnd does that mean he'd turn out to be good?\n\nHell no. He'd always be a bit of a cunt, for sure. Maybe just not himicidal, if you get me.\n\nAnd one last thing, just to prove, that he's nothing but a betrayed crybaby that just needed more love: the dude could've literally founded anything: a gang, simple pirategroup, party, alliance, idek what else. What did he found instead?\n\nOh yes, a fucking family.\n\nGoodness, first off - I read what I wrote yesterday and I sound so condescending in some parts, didn’t mean it like that, sorry :’))) tend to get intense when I get into it\n\nBut! Let’s do this, muhehe\n\nThe Family - totally agree, I think that the fact he decided to call them “family” is the closest Doffy will ever get to sentimental. I find it so bittersweet though, it could be interpreted as emotional - he has no family anymore, so he finds himself a new one, except he doesn’t give a fuck about any of the family members. Makes me sad rather than anything else. (That’s all that pink dude really does to me tbh)\n\nTo respond to the whole power thing - and this is just a wild fantasy in all honesty, but who knows - you said “even if doffy’s parents tried to step away it was too late, and all they did was add fuel to an already raging fire.” I’m thinking, what if he was spiralling out of control so much even back then? That it made them leave? To sort of “correct” the child? Oh boy, just thinking of that from the perspective of the parents, that would be one hell of a story.\n\nAnd the Law/ Corazon thingie, I realise it sounded as if i was trying to correct you or something (it was bad wording on my part really), I was just adding to it, because of course, the Doffy and Cora comparison is obviously substantial too.\n\nThe “he’s always been like that”. I don’t know, I suppose one can’t look away, but I still feel like I owe that mean man benefit of the doubt. I don’t know about you, but I’ve always been torn between “being born like that” or “becoming like that”. From what I’ve seen and experienced, the most evil, mean and vicious people are usually the ones who suffer immensly on the inside, for one reason or another. Maybe it’s what I’m projecting onto him really. Maybe it’s why I’m drawn to him as a character.\n\nHe’s interesting from that perspective too - so far, majority of suffering caused the OP characters to do some sort of “good”, but there we have him - he’s seen it all and he still chooses to be evil.\n\nAnd another longass essay is born, i do apologise :D\n\nThanks for replying and discussing this with me! (Been lonely on that matter so far) its so nice to nerd around with smn"
