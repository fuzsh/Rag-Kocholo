        "text": "he proposal of this paper is to observe how the Brazilian cinematographic narratives have been dedicated to depicting the issue of the feminine. The objective is to comprehend the specificities of the feminine representations from the work of the filmmaker Laís Bodanzky (1969). In order to achieve this objective, this paper uses the narrative analysis (GANCHO, 1991) and the filmic analysis (VANOYE and GOLIOT-LÉTÉ, 2012), with theoretical support from Flusser (2007) about communication and culture; Benjamin (1994) and Silva and Santos (2015) about narratives; Silva (2009) to understand poetical narratives; and Beauvoir (2009) and Butler (2017) with contributions regarding gender. The results point to poetical narratives that approach possible feminine.\n\n1968 ACROSS THE IRON CURTAIN Research Seminar European University Institute (Florence) 22, 23 and 24 February 2017 Organised by Prof Alexander Etkind and Prof Luisa Passerini * * * This workshop is a case study of simultaneous events that shaped our world in entangled ways. While we remember 1968 as the moment of liberating, though non-accomplished, student revolutions in France and the US, this year also saw the Soviet invasion in Czechoslovakia. The year marked the turning point in the Vietnam war and, arguably, in the Cold War as well. Richard Nixon was elected the president of the US, and Leonid Brezhnev consolidated his power over the USSR. Martin Luther King was shot dead in Memphis, and Andrej Siniavsky was serving in a forced labor camp in Mordovia. Yale University announced it was going to admit women. Using the new language of human rights, Russian and Ukrainian dissidents started their struggle with the Soviet regime. From Brazil to Italy, protest movements shook the world but mostly failed to change the governments. Led Zeppelin started performances, and the Beatles sang “Back in the USSR” and became popular there. On the both sides of the Iron Curtain, the enthusiasm and disappointments of 1968 transformed philosophy, political thought, literature and cinema of the subsequent era. The best-known French philosophers, Italian film-makers, American politicians, Polish dissidents all came from the generation that shaped 1968 and were shaped by this historical moment. After 1968, the crucial concepts of human existence – sex, power, gender, class, race – have never been the same, and their tectonic shifts also occurred across the Iron Curtain. In this workshop, we will explore various dimensions of this transnational change. We will complement case studies from countries of Western, Central and Eastern European with broader speculations on issues of history and memory, generations and revolutions, subjectivity and power.\n\nThe paper focuses on the long-term effects of Romanian communist natality politics and the way in which cinema was used to re-appropriate the past after the shift in political climate in 1989. Romania’s process of coming to terms with the past was characterized by political reluctance to explore the communist legacy. However, personal attempts of recollecting the past have a unique ability to bridge the intergenerational gap and facilitate the transmission of knowledge and memories. This paper therefore presents two examples of Romanian cinema focused on the experiences of those directly affected by the family planning politics of the communist regime. Das Experiment 770 - Gebären auf Behelf (2005), directed by Razvan Georgescu and Florin Iepan, is a documentary based on oral testimonies and documents that sketch the history of Romanian communism and the involvement of various individuals. The second source used—4 Months, 3 Weekes and 2 Days (2007) directed by Cristian Mungiu—is a film that uses a different language and technics in order to re-appropriate the past, not through direct testimony of those involved, but creating fictional characters. The target audience of these movies—as is often the case with historical cinema—is the second or third generation. Cinematography provides a simple and popular way of connecting these generations with the experiences of their predecessors.\n\nThe article engages Hungarian film production between 1945 and 2005 from a twofold perspective. It surveys women’s inclusion in the film-making profession and assesses the representation of women in Hungarian cinema. The study seeks answers to the questions whether state-socialist emancipation rhetoric and policies targeting women’s employment and social inclusion have also affected 1) the domain of creative work; and 2) the kinds of representations of women circulating in visual culture? The author argues that both women’s representation and women’s participation in cinema production have presented an overall more favourable picture in the decades of state-socialism than during the period following the system change. To indentify assessment criteria for „a favourable picture”, the insights of feminist film studies are consulted. The survey concludes that beside some pieces by engaged women filmmakers, a good proportion of complex portrayals of women came from male directors. At the same time, the author interrogates to what extent, and with what sort of qualifications, (Western) feminist film criticism may prove to be a viable tool of analysis to account for developments within an arguably different historical/social context and production environment. The starkly different production environments of mainstream Hollywood cinema (the foundational „research animal” of British-American feminist theory), its state-funded equivalent in socialist Hungary and the subsequent re-arrangement of the industry in the new market economy entail both material kind and film text-related consequences. The article proposes that the political economy of cultural production in state-socialist Hungary allowed for a kind of transformation of signifying practices that is appreciable from a feminist perspective."
