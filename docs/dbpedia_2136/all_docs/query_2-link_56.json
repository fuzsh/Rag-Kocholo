        "text": "The Institute of Documentary Film, in collaboration with the Czech Film Center and with the support of the DAFilms.com portal, presents a panel of upcoming Czech documentaries and the Czech Docs catalogue introducing 89 upcoming and 22 recently finished Czech documentary films.\n\nThe upcoming films cover controversial topics (as is the case with Modlany Akhbar about the Saudi presence in the Czech borderlands and the Czech response to it) and portray famous personalities of the past, such as actress Lída Baarová, writer Robert Musil, music composer Bohuslav Martinů and architect Josef Pleskot, as well as of the present, such as catholic priest Tomáš Halík, photographers Antonín Kratochvíl and Josef Koudelka, figure skater Tomáš Verner and popular rapper Rytmus. The portrait documentaries have also captured the life stories of less known yet comparably remarkable personalities, such as cardinal Štěpán Trochta imprisoned both by the Nazis and the communists, rescuer of a thousand Jewish children Antonín Kalina and one of today’s most renowned world immunologists and geneticists Emil Skamene. Human rights themes are traditionally strongly represented as well, focusing on the coexistence of Czechs and the Roma, portraying people living on the margin of the society in the Czech Republic, in the streets of Bucharest or in Rwanda, and looking into the life of gays and lesbians born around 1965. Current topics and society-wide phenomena such as tramping have also been covered by Czech documentarists.\n\nThe directors of the upcoming documentaries include Klára Tasovská and Lukáš Kokeš, Martin Dušek, Miroslav Janek, Kamila Zlatušková, Tereza Reichová and others. “This year, a record-breaking number of 111 documentary projects have been included in the catalogue, out of which 22 have already been finished while the others are in various stages of development. The number of European and international coproductions is increasing as well, as almost three dozen Czech documentaries are made in coproduction. Fans of Czech documentary films thus have a lot to look forward to,” said Institute of Documentary Film’s Anna Kaslová, coordinator of the Czech Documentary project.\n\nOn Monday, September 21 at 6:30 pm, the annual Panel of Upcoming Czech Documentaries will be held at Prague’s Světozor Cinema. The viewers will have a unique opportunity to acquaint themselves with ten upcoming documentary projects introduced by their filmmakers in a series of short presentations. The presentations will be followed by a preview of the documentary Czechs against Czechs in which director Tomáš Kratochvíl has captured his experience with living in the allegedly worst Roma ghetto in the Czech Republic. Admission is free."
