        "text": "A renowned actress and one-time mistress of Nazi Joseph Goebbels, Lida Baarová leaves a checkered past.\n\nHelen of Troy was known as the \"face that launched a thousand ships.\" It was her affair with the Trojan Paris (who carried her away from her Greek husband, Meneleus) that triggered the Trojan War. The stunning Czechoslovak film starlet Lida Baarová, who died Oct. 27 in Salzburg, might similarly be dubbed the \"face that broke a thousand windows.\"\n\nA well-known actress from Czechoslovak and German avant-garde films in the 1930s, Baarová was the notorious mistress of Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. According to the controversial historian David Irving, their intense affair played a part in what became known as Kristallnacht (the night of broken glass) on Nov. 9-10, 1938.\n\nBorn Ludmila Baarová on Sept. 7, 1914, to a well-off Prague family, the actress starred in her first film when she was just 17 years old. Though her younger sister, Zorka Janů, was thought to be the more talented actress, Baarová won an award in 1931 for her role in a film by Miroslav J. Krňanský, and left her studies to act professionally. She went on to make 44 films in various European countries during the course of her career.\n\n\"Her life was a classic mix of fame and tragedy,\" says film critic Andrej Halada, \"She was a really big star, maybe one of the two or three most popular women in Czech movies before the Second World War. But, as with many famous people, she was very much alone.\"\n\nHalada remarks that she wasn't a particularly great actress, but that she \"played good in good movies.\" He likens her acting to that of Sharon Stone today, pointing out that while her early films weren't particularly good, her fame steadily built to where she received roles in quality films.\n\nBaarová's beauty played a large role in launching her career. The Czechoslovak director Otakar Vávra, who made four films with Baarová, characterized her beauty as \"damned.\" He said she had an exquisite charm that would silence people when she entered a room. With her dark, sensuous eyes and high cheekbones, she quickly became a cinematic idol.\n\nIn 1934, Baarová signed with the German film company UFA, turning down an offer from MGM in Hollywood. At the time, Berlin was one of the major cultural centers of Europe, and there was little indication of the coming war.\n\nShe later characterized the decision as the worst she ever made.\n\nIn Berlin, Baarová became romantically involved with German actor Gustav Fröhlich (Metropolis ). She starred in many films including Barcarole, and various Czechoslovak and German films.\n\nThe actress became intimate with Goebbels in the late '30s, and their affair was as intense as it was controversial. It is reputed that Fröhlich caught Goebbels and Baarová in flagrante , and that Fröhlich slapped the propaganda minister across the face hard enough to send him to the hospital.\n\nIt was Adolf Hitler himself who ended Goebbels' affair with Baarová, after Goebbels' wife demanded a divorce in 1938. Magda Goebbels reportedly had denied her husband's requests that she engage in a menage a trois, and Goebbels had threatened to leave her to wed Baarová. Under \"advice\" from the Gestapo, Baarová returned to Czechoslovakia.\n\nSoon thereafter, war broke out in Europe.\n\nIrving writes in his book Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich that Baarová had so beguiled Goebbels that the propaganda minister was nearly driven to suicide. In a misanthropic \"frenzy bordering on delirium,\" he subsequently gave the fiery speech which precipitated Kristallnacht - violence by the SS and the Hitler Youth which resulted in 91 Jewish deaths and hundreds of injuries, as well as the destruction of 7,500 businesses and 177 synagogues.\n\nBittersweet memories\n\nAfter leaving Germany, Baarová worked for an anti-Nazi spy ring in Prague until she was expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1941. She lived in Italy during the remainder of the war and made several films there, but returned to Prague in 1945.\n\nIn a murky period of her history, Baarová was arrested by U.S. military intelligence on her way to a friend's villa in Bavaria in April 1945. She eventually was transferred from a Munich prison to a Prague prison, where she apparently spent two years - although it is not clear on what charges. During this time, her younger sister committed suicide and her mother died after a heart attack during a separate interrogation.\n\nIn the early '50s, Baarová returned to her film career, acting in major Spanish and Italian films, including Fellini's I Vitelloni. She was cast mostly in supporting roles. She eventually settled in Salzburg in 1958, where she acted on stage throughout the '60s. Married and subsequently widowed, she lived quietly for many years under the name Lida Lundwall. During her later years, Baarová hardly ever spoke about her suspected collaboration with the Nazis.\n\nShe wrote two memoirs, Fleeing (1983) and Sweet Bitterness of Life (1992). She also took part in a 30-minute Czech documentary about her life in 1995, Sladke horkosti Lidy Baarove (Lida Baarová's Bittersweet Memories).\n\nDuring the final years of her life she lived alone and was reported to suffer from depression, alcoholism and Parkinson's disease.\n\nBaarová was 86 years old when she died. Her body was cremated in Austria, and her ashes were sent to Prague.\n\nFrom the Archives of The Prague Post."
