You can't measure time the way you measure the distance between two points. 'Time' doesn't pass. We human beings have enormous difficulty in focusing on the present; we're always thinking about what we did, about how we could have done it better, about the consequences of our actions, and about why we didn't act as we should have. Or else we think about the future, about what we're going to do tomorrow, what precautions we should take, what dangers await us around the next corner, how to avoid what we don't want and how to get what we have always dreamed of.”Â\n\nâÂ Paulo Coelho\n\n•“The past was gone and the future had yet to unfold, and he knew he should focus his life on the presentâ¦yet his day-to-day existence suddenly struck him as endless and unbearable.”Â\n\nâÂ Nicholas Sparks\n\n•“Those who have hurt you in the past cannot continue to hurt you now unless you hold on to the pain through resentment.”Â\n\nâÂ Rick Warren\n\n•“You go on.

The past is still close to us. The things we have tried to forget and put behind us would stir again, and that sense of fear, of furtive unrest, struggling at length to blind unreasoning panic - now mercifully stilled, thank God - might in some manner unforeseen become a living companion as it had before.”Â\n\nâÂ Daphne du Maurier\n\n•“A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots.”Â\n\nâÂ Marcus GarveyÂ\n\n•“Young men speak about the future because they have no past, and old men speak of the past because they have no future.”Â\n\nâÂ Boyd K. Packer\n\n•“Forget the past - the future will give you plenty to worry about.”Â\n\nâ George Allen, Sr.Â\n\n•“Manâ¦who lives in three places â in the past, in the present, and in the future â can be unhappy if one of these three is worthless. Religion has even added a fourth â eternity.”Â\n\nâÂ Georg Christoph Lichtenberg\n\n•“The past is never where you think you left it.”Â\n\nâÂ Katherine Anne Porter\n\n•“The past was always there, lived inside of you, and it helped to make you who you were. But it had to be placed in perspective. The past could not dominate the future.”Â\n\nâÂ Barbara Taylor Bradford\n\n•“We can draw lessons from the past, but we cannot live in it.”Â\n\nâÂ Lyndon B. Johnson\n\n•“Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.”Â\n\nâÂ SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard\n\n•“Learn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future, and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now.”Â\n\nâÂ Denis WaitleyÂ\n\n•“Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future.”Â\n\nâÂ John F. KennedyÂ\n\n•“If you have a past with which you feel dissatisfied, then forget it, now. Imagine a new story for your life and believe in it. Focus only on the moments when you achieved what you desired, and that strength will help you to get what you want.”Â\n\nâÂ Paulo Coelho\n\n•“Stop acting as if life is a rehearsal. Live this day as if it were your last. The past is over and gone. The future is not guaranteed.”Â\n\nâÂ Wayne DyerÂ\n\n•“The golden moments in the stream of life rush past us, and we see nothing but sand; the angels come to visit us, and we only know them when they are gone.”Â\n\nâÂ George EliotÂ\n\n•“Look not mournfully into the past, it comes not back again. Wisely improve the present, it is thine. Go forth to meet the shadowy future without fear and with a manly heart.”Â\n\nâÂ Henry Wadsworth LongfellowÂ\n\n•“Forgiving does not erase the bitter past. A healed memory is not a deleted memory. Instead, forgiving what we cannot forget creates a new way to remember. We change the memory of our past into a hope for our future.”Â\n\nâÂ Lewis B. SmedesÂ\n\n•“Do not brood over your past mistakes and failures as this will only fill your mind with grief, regret and depression. Do not repeat them in the future.”Â\n\nâÂ SivanandaÂ\n\n•“I've been burdened with blame trapped in the past for too long, I'm moving on”Â\n\nâÂ Rascal Flatts\n\n•“If you are carrying strong feelings about something that happened in your past, they may hinder your ability to live in the present.”Â\n\nâÂ Les BrownÂ\n\n•“Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future, too.”Â\n\nâÂ Marcus AureliusÂ\n\n•“If you believe that feeling bad or worrying long enough will change a past or future event, then you are residing on another planet with a different reality system.”Â\n\nâÂ William JamesÂ"
