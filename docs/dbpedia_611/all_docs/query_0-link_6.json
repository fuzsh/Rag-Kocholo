        "text": "Unlocking Brilliance: Embracing Neurodiversity in Our Workplace In the workplace, we should understand that diversity is a driving force behind innovation and success. Following a talk I led at Atos, I recognized a need to change the narrative. With this, I welcome you to a groundbreaking four-part series to reshape the way we view diversity and inclusion, especially with neurodiversity and how important it is to add sprinkles, gummy worms, fruit and chocolate shavings to the vanilla cupcake of neurotypical. In this journey, we'll dive into the worlds that I know very well the worlds of dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia—three remarkable facets of neurodiversity that hold the key to unlocking untapped brilliance in our workforce. When we hear about these neuroabilities, we often think of the disadvantage that they bring, and the adaptations needed to overcome. In reality, these provide many advantages for those that hold these “Superpowers” and it’s up to us to reclaim the meaning & reclaim the power of each of these. At the heart of this series is a celebration of the superpowers inherent in neurodiverse individuals. From dyslexic thinkers with unparalleled problem-solving skills to dyscalculic minds that excel in pattern recognition, to the dysgraphia wonderers that can read people like no tomorrow, we're about to discover that embracing neurodiversity isn't just about doing what's right; it's about making us undeniably better. It’s about adding a much-needed flavor to the vanilla cupcake. Get ready for a paradigm shift that will challenge preconceptions, ignite conversations, and propel us toward a future where every unique mind is recognized as an invaluable asset. Together, let's champion diversity and inclusion as not just a goal but as the very essence of our collective success. Stay tuned for the first installment of \"Unlocking Brilliance\"—because when we embrace neurodiversity, we unlock the full spectrum of human potential. #neurodiversity #neurodiverse #atos #IDPD #superpowers #dyslexia #dyscalculia #dysgraphia #powerofwe\n\nWe are approaching April which is National Donate Life Month, and a time devoted to raising awareness about the importance of organ and bone marrow donations and to celebrate the lives of those who have received life-saving transplants and those that give them a second chance at life. In the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are on the waitlist for an organ transplant. I sit in the Daytona airport watching my little children fly home to Dallas while I wait to fly to NYC. The plane taking off with them in it was a bit surreal for me today, because as I write, I am preparing to donate my Kidney to my uncle at Weill Cornell in NYC. I will arrive home to my Upper East Side apartment to see my NYC family for a bit and head to the hospital bright and early in the morning for pre-operative testing; so, this April is ultra-special to me. Our surgery will be Thursday. For those in need of a kidney transplant, the waitlist can be YEARS long from a deceased donor. On top of that, the chances of receiving the right match while waiting is low with only about half the people in the US signing up to be a donor and this number varies from state to state. Living donor transplants can help shorten or eliminate the wait times. Living donation has a higher success rate than deceased donors. More than 98% of the kidneys received from living donors are still successful one year and more after transplant. I’m honored to share a part of me that means more birthdays, more holidays, more meals, more love, more laughter, and more memories for someone else. In addition, I want to highlight the importance of working for a company, like Atos, that supports such personal life balance, and removes all barriers to taking off for testing, surgery, and the time it takes to save a life. As leaders, it's important that we create a #culture that encourages our employees to take time off for personal reasons. By supporting our employees in their personal journeys, we not only create a more #positive #workplace culture, but we also create a #community that is focused on making a difference in the world. This National #DonateLife Month, you can make a decision that gives someone a second chance at life and helps alleviate the shortage of organs available for transplant. I encourage everyone to consider being tested to be an #organdonor or #bonemarrowdonor. The process starts at a transplant hospital. • To donate to someone you know, ask that person to put you in touch with their transplant hospital. • To donate someone you know but want to get tested before telling the person, talk to their transplant hospital. • To donate an organ to someone you do not know, call a transplant hospital near you to talk about it. A list of transplant hospitals are located at this link https://lnkd.in/ggdutai2. Let's work together to create a world where everyone has access to life-saving organ transplants. #SaveALife #Leader #OrganDonor #BeTheMatch #NationalDonateLifeMonth"
