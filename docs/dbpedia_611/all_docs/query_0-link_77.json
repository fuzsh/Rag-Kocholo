Annual report Jan-Dec 82\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBiljetina, R.; Chynoweth, D.P.; Janulis, J.\n\n1983-05-01\n\nThe objective of this research is to develop efficient processes for conversion of biomass-waste blends to methane and other resources. To evaluate the technical and economic feasibility, an experimental test facility (ETU) is being designed and installed at the Reedy Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant at Walt Disney World, Orlando, Florida. The facility will integrate a biomethanogenic conversion process with a waste-water treatment process employing water hyacinth ponds for secondary and tertiary treatment of sewage produced at Walt Disney World.

The program that was established was designed to heighten the awareness of energy usage in our Management and Cast Members, establish a method for recognizing and rewarding positive energy conservation efforts and, most importantly, keeping the effort simple and fun. Two programs work together to meet this goal: Utility Efficiency Awards and the Environmental Circles of Excellence. The Utility Efficiency Awards are given to the top areas that have demonstrated a reduction in utility consumption relative to the same period in prior years.moreÂ Â» More importantly, a report is generated that shows a best-to-worst ranking. Relying on the idea that {open_quotes}nobody wants to be on the bottom of the list{close_quotes}, conservation is enhanced by focusing attention on improving efficiency. To encourage direct cast member involvement in our environmental program, the Environmental Circles of Excellence were created. These groups, made up of hourly and salaried cast members, discuss their location`s environmental commitments, set goals and implement programs. This paper describes these initiatives in detail and presents some initial results that have heightened the awareness of energy conservation at WALT DISNEY WORLD.Â«Â less\n\nDr. von Braun Briefing Walt Disney\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1965-01-01\n\nDr. von Braun began his association with Walt Disney in the 1950s when the rocket scientist appeared in three Disney television productions related to the exploration of space. Years later, Dr. von Braun invited Disney and his associates to tour the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama. This photograph is dated April 13, 1965. From left are R.J.

To evaluate the technical and economic feasibility, an experimental test unit (ETU) was designed and operated at the Reedy Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The facility integrates a biomethanogenic-conversion process with a wastewater-treatment process employing water hyacinth ponds for secondary and tertiary treatment of sewage. Harvested water hyacinth is subsequently combined with sludge from the primary wastewater clarifier and fed at 1-wet-ton per day to the ETU digester. This results in themoreÂ Â» production of methane and other useful products. The digester was operated as a non-mixed, solids concentrating digester to encourage higher solids and microorganism retention times. Data collected during six steady-state operating periods confirmed earlier laboratory observations that this digester consistently produces 15 to 25% higher methane yields and conversions when compared to conventional stirred-tank digester. Digester operation was evaluated at different loading rates, solids blend ratios and feed configurations. Results from the program have provided a data base for the design of larger conversion systems.Â«Â less\n\nDisney in the Academy (and Other Disney Educational Experiences on College Campuses)\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTremblay, Christopher\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe study of Disney is not new to higher education.

Two content analyses were conducted using the animated feature films (n = 34) of the Walt Disney Company and after-school cartoons (n = 41). Each was coded for the modeling of the use of \"evil\" words when referring to a person, e.g., monster, devil, demon, wicked. Seventy-four percent of the Disney films contained \"evil\" references, with an average of 5.6 references per film. Forty-four percent of the after-school cartoons contained \"evil\" references, with an average of one per cartoon. The results are discussed within the context of children's repeated exposure to popular animated movies and cartoons and their learning to demonize people who engage in perceived \"bad\" behaviors.\n\nWhen Disney Meets the Research Park: Metaphors and Models for Engineering an Online Learning Community of Tomorrow\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nChenail, Ronald J.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIt is suggested that educators look to an environment in which qualitative research can be learned in more flexible and creative ways--an online learning community known as the Research Park Online (RPO).

The community consists of African American children who face serious disabilities and chronic illnesses, as well as the families who care for them. Disney films and characters permeate the lives and imaginations of these children and parenting kin. While the compelling power of Disney can legitimately be construed as a form of global domination, an emphasis on domination and on the consumer as unwitting victim easily underestimates the agency of the audience.

In the discussion of Disney and his work (based, in part on writings about him) it is suggested that he exhibited traits associated with anal eroticism, which raises an interesting question about the popularity of his work with the American public. The two dominant themes found in Krazy Kat are described as \"the triumph of illusion over reality\" and \"anti-authoritarianism.\" In a comparison of the two characters, it is shown they are polar opposites: Mickey Mouse is sadistic, asexual, and anal while Ignatz Mouse, the hero of Krazy Kat, is playful, sexual, and phallic.\n\nMs. Rodriquez and Mickey Mouse pose with a portrait of Ronald McNair\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1999-01-01\n\nIn the gymnasium of Ronald McNair Magnet School in Cocoa, Fla., Ms. Maria Rodriguez, an Walt Disney World Ambassador, and Mickey Mouse pose with a portrait of NASA astronaut Ronald McNair.

We discuss the results within the context of children's repeated exposure to popular animated movies and their learning of labels and stereotypes associated with mental illness. We recommend further research on this topic. We coded 34 animated feature films produced by TWDC for mental illness references (for example, \"crazy\" or \"nuts\"). We developed a coding manual to systematize the content analysis, to ensure accuracy of the data, and to ascertain intercoder reliability. Most of the films (that is, 85%) contain verbal references to mental illness, with an average of 4.6 references per film. The references were mainly used to set apart and denigrate the characters to whom they referred. Twenty-one percent of the principal characters were referred to as mentally ill. We discuss the contributions and limitations of the study. The findings have implications for child viewers in terms of their potentially learning prejudicial attitudes and distancing behaviours toward individuals perceived as being mentally ill. To further verify this connection, an assessment of the incidence of Disney film exposure and attitudes toward people with a mental illness, using a sample of school-aged children, is needed.\n\nInstruction and Delight: Some Observations for Museums.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKing, Margaret J.\n\nThis paper assesses the work of artist-creator Walt Disney as a model for museum educators to draw the public into its work.

Willigan.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, G\n\n1990-01-01\n\nFinancing a company is more complex than ever-and more important to its economic success. The demands on a CFO are tremendous. Optimizing capital costs requires an unprecedented level of technical sophistication. Yet the best CFOs today are not mere technicians. They are also strategists and innovators. Gary Wilson exemplifies the new CFO. In his 5 years as executive vice president and CFO of the Walt Disney Company and his 12 years at Marriott Corporation, he has shown how the finance function can add value-not just account for it. How does a CFO create value for shareholders? \"Just like all the great marketing and operating executives,\" Wilson says, \"by being creative.\" To Wilson, being creative means rethinking assumptions and finding clever ways to achieve financial and strategic goals. Some of Wilson's innovative deal making-like the off-balance-sheet financing he used at Marriott-is well known. At Marriott, he discovered the power of separating the ownership of an asset from its control. Marriott's strength was in operations, yet the company had a great deal of money tied up in real estate. Growth would require even more investment in real estate. Wilson's solution was to sell the hotels-in effect, removing them and the debt used to finance them from the balance sheet-and contract to operate them. In this interview, Wilson gives his view of the role of finance in today's corporation and explains the thinking behind some of the successful deals he has engineered-including Disney's Silver Screen movie-making partnerships and Euro Disneyland.\n\nDesign criteria for Reedy Creek Demonstration Project\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFelicione, F.S.; Logan, J.A.\n\n1980-11-01\n\nThis document defines the basic criteria for the 100-ton/day pilot plant which will use the Andco-Torrax pyrolysis process at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, to produce hot water.

Unfortunately, if people develop abdominal pain while planning for a vacation, they usually proceed with the vacation and do not consider getting medical attention for their pain. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of being on vacation and its association with ruptured appendicitis. From January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008, the incidence of ruptured appendicitis cases at Florida Hospital-Celebration Health, located 5 miles from Walt Disney World, was compared with that of Florida Hospital-Orlando, approximately 30 miles away from Walt Disney World. We evaluated whether patients \"on vacation\" versus residents of Orlando have an increased incidence of ruptured appendicitis. Of patients treated for presumed appendicitis, 60.59% at Florida Hospital-Celebration Health had ruptured appendicitis during this time versus 20.42% at Florida Hospital-Orlando. Of those 266 patients seen at Florida Hospital-Celebration Health, 155 were on vacation versus only 21 at Florida Hospital-Orlando. Although there is not a direct cause and effect, it is clear that there is a higher incidence of ruptured appendicitis in patients on vacation versus in the regular community in the Orlando, Florida area.\n\nDiscipline and Pleasure: The Pedagogical Work of Disneyland\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAronstein, Susan L.; Finke, Laurie A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDisneyland is work disguised as play; school disguised as vacation.

This prompted a study in which all Disney classic full-length animated films and shorts were analyzed for other examples of RBD. Three additional dogs were found with presumed RBD in the classic films Lady and the Tramp (1955) and The Fox and the Hound (1981), and in the short Pluto's Judgment Day (1935). These dogs were elderly males who would pant, whine, snuffle, howl, laugh, paddle, kick, and propel themselves while dreaming that they were chasing someone or running away. In Lady and the Tramp the dog was also losing both his sense of smell and his memory, two associated features of human RBD. These four films were released before RBD was first formally described in humans and dogs. In addition, systematic viewing of the Disney films identified a broad range of sleep disorders, including nightmares, sleepwalking, sleep related seizures, disruptive snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorder. These sleep disorders were inserted as comic elements. The inclusion of a broad range of accurately depicted sleep disorders in these films indicates that the Disney screenwriters were astute observers of sleep and its disorders.\n\n1863 Letter from Ralph Waldo Emerson about Walt Whitman\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPotter, Lee Ann\n\n2004-01-01\n\nBiographers have called Walt Whitman \"America's most influential and innovative poet\" and some have even called him \"the greatest of all American poets.\" But in the winter of 1862-63, even as he was gaining a reputation as a talented poet, Whitman was forty-three years old, volunteering as a nurse in Union hospitals, andâ¦\n\nLiving-History Villages as Popular Entertainers.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGeist, Christopher D.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nDiscusses the furor created when Walt Disney Studios announced plans to develop a \"historic amusement park\" near the Manassas (Virginia) National Battlefield Park.

The principal aim was to construct a new conceptual framework that may help scholars, practitioners and policy makers make sense of dynamic patterns of illegal drug use across bounded play spaces such as tourist resorts, music festivals and nightclubs. Ethnographic fieldwork employing a grounded theory design was undertaken over three summers in tourist locations on the Balearic island of Ibiza, including nightclubs, bars, cafes, beaches, airports and hotels. Field notes from participant observation were supplemented with data from semi-structured interviews (nâ¯=â¯56) and secondary sources gathered from tourist marketing. The framework of Disneyization has been discussed in terms of 5 constructs: theming, hybrid consumption, branding, performative labour and atmospheres; each having a specific role in relation to understanding illicit drug use in bounded play spaces. Thus: Theming sets the stage, by physically and symbolically demarcating space with indelible themes of hedonism that open up the possibility of illicit drug use. Hybrid-consumption blurs the distinction between legal and illegal forms of intoxication, making the trading and consumption of illegal drugs appear like a natural feature of the consumer space. Branding demonstrates how participants construct intricate hierarchies of taste and credibility related to drug of choice. Performative labour re-enforces hybrid consumption, with participants working in the bounded play spaces of Ibiza immersed within the illicit drug market. Atmospheres represents the alchemic synergy of bounded play space and is important to understanding illicit drug use as a sensorial, deeply immersive but transitory experience. This research offers Disneyization as a new conceptual framework for making sense of deeply complex spatial, socio-cultural, psychological and\n\nLeading Change: Military Leadership in Civilian Organizations\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-03-19\n\nmeasured by one person; the military leader.

We argue Disney and Pixar depictions of EOL and death can provide critical opportunities for discussing death and dying processes with children and adults alike. A content analysis of 57 movies resulted in a total of 71 character deaths. These instances of death became the discourse used for analysis. The EOL discourse was coded based on five categories (character status, depiction of death, death status, emotional reaction, and causality). After quantitative analysis, the films were qualitatively analyzed. Four themes emerged from analysis, unrealistic moments, managing EOL, intentions to kill, and transformation and spiritual connection. Discussion of results, limitations, and directions for future research are included.\n\nAvoiding the \"It's a Small World\" Effect: A Lesson Plan to Explore Diversity\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEndacott, Jason L.; Bowles, Freddie A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nClassroom instruction about other cultures all too often resembles the Disney version of \"It's a Small World\" with Fantasyland-like cultural stereotypes, ceremonial activities, and traditional dress that can lead to serious misunderstandings about the depth and complexity of global societies.

Although Epcot and OST have distinctive missions, certain areas of their respective research and development efforts are common, including the integration of remote sensors with robotics platforms, airborne surveys for environmental characterization and monitoring, and ground based measurements of vegetation stress. The first area of cooperative R&D pursued under the agreement is the evaluation ofmoreÂ Â» laser-induced fluorescence imaging (LIFI), a technology developed by OST and proven effective for uranium detection. This paper describes the efforts being conducted under the Epcot-OST agreement and presents initial results. An appendix describing LIFI technology is also included.Â«Â less\n\nKSC-07pd2411\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2007-09-10\n\nKENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLA. -- A reporter interviews STS-118 Mission Specialist Dave Williams during a special event at Walt Disney World in Orlando . The day's events honoring the STS-118 space shuttle crew recognized the inspirational achievement of teacher-turned-astronaut Barbara R. Morgan who helped dedicate a plaque outside the Mission: Space attraction, and included meeting with students and the media and parading down Main Street to the delight of the crowds. The other crew members attending were Commander Scott Kelly, Pilot Charlie Hobaugh and Mission Specialists Tracy Caldwell, Rick Mastracchio and Alvin Drew. Mission STS-118 was the 119th shuttle program flight and the 22nd flight to the International Space Station. Space shuttle Endeavour launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on Aug. 8 and landed Aug. 21. The mission delivered the S5 truss, continuing the assembly of the space station.
