        "text": "Some decades ago, Fela sang a song titled, Zombie. Every Nigerian believed that the song, Zombie, portrayed the Nigerian Armed Forces as composing mentally degenerated people who are incapable of discerning what is good from what is bad since they could only act on command. The Commander would order : March forward; Open your mouth; Turn to the right; Turn to the left; Fall in, Fall out; Halt!; Stand at ease; Shoot and kill and the Armed men would obey any orders from the Commander just like senseless people. To be fair, 'Zombies' in Nigeria are not limited alone to the Armed Forces because all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) throughout the Federation of Nigeria are peopled by 'Literate Zombies' whom, in my previous postings, were wrongly referred to as Western Educated. Being educated, whether in the Western, Eastern, Northern or Southern part of the world, should imply that one has successfully gone through an act or a process of acquiring knowledge in a specific field or profession. As an example, a Western Educated Nigerian Electrical Engineer must, at least, have acquired scientific and technical knowledge of generating and distributing electricity. When a Nigerian is employed, paid, and equipped financially and materially, to apply his/her acquired scientific and technical knowledge of generating electricity for Nigerians, but he/she fails, the purported Western Education in Electrical Engineering must either be a fake or his/her educator(s) must have deliberately trained him/her to be a Literate Zombie, which means he/she cannot act as an electrical engineer without supervision of, and orders from, his/her educator. The economic and industrial underdevelopment of Nigeria, despite the availability of enormous natural resources and good climate are caused mainly by the 'Literate Zombies' in the MDAs of Nigeria. Literate Zombies are fluent in spoken and written English Language. However, when it comes to practical application of knowledge, they are just like mechanical toys in their fields of specialization and must be winded repeatedly to perform pre-programmed functions. The winders of the Nigeria's mechanical toys are the foreign interests. What causes Nigerians to be 'Literate Zombies'?\n\nIn London Sunday Times of 14 October 2007, Dr. James D. Watson, who shared the Nobel Price with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins in 1962 for the discovery of the structure of DNA, said of the Black people in general thus, \"I am inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa because all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours, whereas all the testing says not really.\" He concluded, \"There was no reason to believe different races separated by geography should have evolved identically hoping that everybody was equal, people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\" In a nutshell, what Dr. James D. Watson was saying is that the Blacks are not equal to the Whites because Blacks are inferior intelligently to the Whites. Intelligence, as distinguished from brilliance, is creative. Brilliance is more of an ability to reproduce what intelligence has created. For instance, someone came up with the law of gravity. That is intelligence at work. Someone else studies the law of gravity, takes an exam in it and scores 100 per cent, that is brilliance. One cannot be intelligent without being brilliant but one can be brilliant without being intelligent. Thus, if we juxtapose Dr. Watson's opinion on the political and economic development of Africa as administered by the Literate Zombies, it becomes very obvious that Africans have, in all practical terms, demonstrated that we possess very low IQ. IQ tests are intended to determine the speed of thought, soundness of reasoning and sense of organisation. It is a very good test of mental capability and creative ability. In order to test the validity of Dr. James D. Watson's assertion about the superiority of the Whites to the Blacks, what one needs to do is to take a look at Nigeria, where the evidence of retarded intelligence or Zombie-like behaviour is astonishingly very glaring. Let's take a look at the Nigerian Minister of Power who is a professor of electricity. He travelled officially to London or New York to buy transformers and generating plants for the purpose of generating and distributing electricity in Nigeria. Before his departure, the honourable Minister had registered a brief-case Company in his name and opened several bank accounts in which he is the sole signatory. In collusion with the Permanent Secretary and some Directors of the Ministry of Power, the Minister awarded to himself the contract to supply Transformers and Generating plants and received, in advance, full payment for the contract into his bank accounts. On getting to London or New York, he saw a very beautiful environment and a system that works. Water flowed, electric lights were constant, roads were smooth, streets were clean, drainages were covered, public transport was excellent and technology worked for everybody. The Minister looked around and exclaimed, \"Wow, what a beautiful place!\" One would expect him to add, \"I will go back to Nigeria with these transformers and generating plants to create constant electricity supplies in Nigeria.\" Instead, the Nigerian Minister of Power turned to his White host to say and ask, \"I want to buy mansions here and I am going to pay cash down; can you help me?\" That is the limit of the IQ of all our Literate Zombies in Nigeria. They are all, as Yoruba people will call them, KÓLÁJÁDE and not KÓLÁWO'LÉ meaning take wealth outside and not, bring wealth inside home. Of course, White Londoner or New Yorker, as usual, would cooperate with Nigeria's Minister of Power to help him buy mansions there with the stolen money from the Ministry of Power resulting in epileptic power supply or permanent darkness for Nigerians. How were Literate Zombies created in Nigeria?\n\nIn a letter written to Pope Henessy by Edmund Blyden in 1871, he warned that the subjection of Africans to 'unmodified European training' would produce slaveries far more subversive of the real welfare of the race than the ancient physical fetters through which the Blacks were carted and ferried away to the Americas and West Indies like cattle. It is noteworthy that Edmund Blyden did not say 'unmodified European Education' but 'unmodified European Training.' For the mere fact that Chimpanzees are trained to use knives and focks to eat does not imply that they are educated. However, the warning of Edmund Blyden was not heeded because the intention of the colonialists was not to educate Africans but to train them to serve colonial interests. Training of Africans by the colonialists was not open to all Africans but to a selected few. The purpose of limiting the training of Africans to very few of us was better illustrated by a part of what Malcolm X said in his Message to the Grass Roots thus, \"The slave- master took Tom and dressed him well, fed him well and even gave him a little education - a little education; give him a long coat and a top hat and made the other slaves look up to him. Then he used Tom to control them. The same strategy that was used in those days is used today, by the same white man. He takes a Negro, a so-called Negro, and makes him prominent, builds him up, publicizes him, makes him a celebrity. And then he becomes a spokesman for Negroes - and a Negro leader.\" Trained Nigerians are Literate Zombies who have been rewired and retooled into abandoning Nigeria's real needs and aspirations for the purpose of devoting their lives and entire existence into serving the global conquerors. Literate Nigerian Zombies connive with foreigners to go into joint ventures, especially in the crude oil exploration, that present Nigerians as owners of companies which in reality are foreign owned. Due to the control of the white world over the literate Zombies that pervade the entire administration of Nigeria, the white world often act and behave as if Nigerians never can know where the shoes they wear are pinching unless they tell them. Therefore, the US and Western Europe controlled UN do not only always diagnose and proffer solutions to our industrial and economic problems but command the Literate Zombies to accept and implement their solutions. In 1985 when a Nigerian naira was exchanging at one dollar and fifty cents, the global economic dictators instructed the military and civilian Literate Zombies in Nigeria to devalue naira against the dollar so that Nigeria's products would be cheaper in the world market and make Nigeria to earn more money for its exports. Although the only major export from Nigeria was crude oil and its prize, internationally, was not decided in naira but dollar, Nigeria's Literate Zombies complied with the instruction of the global economic dictators. Naira was devalued and Nigeria's economy nose-dived and suffered a great recession. By the time Obasanjo became President in 1999, naira was exchanging at N85 to a dollar. Of what gain was the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa (UN-NADAF) which the global economic dictators forced Nigeria's Literate Zombies to accept in 1990? Five years later, 1995, the Global economic dictators set up the so-called implementing arm of NADAF called the United Nations System-Wide Special Initiative on Africa which Nigeria's Literate Zombies embraced just like a dog will embrace a bone thrown to it by its master. NADAF was buried in year 2000 without any benefit for Nigeria or Africa as a whole when the global economic dictators replaced it with New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). At the same time, Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) which was designed by the global economic dictators to cure most of our socio-economic ailments by year 2015 was handed over to Nigeria's Literate Zombies and they grabbed it without second thought. By the end of year 2015, Nigerians were economically poorer than year 2000, yet the global economic dictators were unrestrained to throw a new plan called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on the lap of Nigeria's Literate Zombies for implementations between 2015 and 2030. The enormous power of the global economic dictators over Nigeria's Literate Zombies was demonstrated in the recently celebrated Valentine Day.\n\nOn 8 February 2018, pmnewsnigeria.com in its publication announced that AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), founded in Nigeria in 2009, was to observe what was termed World Condom Day on 13 February 2018, with distribution of three-hundred-thousand condoms and carrying out forty-three-thousand HIV test among Nigerians.\n\nTwo days to the Valentine's Day, Nigerian Punch online had the headline, Avoid Unprotected Sex On Valentine's Day, Government Tells Nigerians. Here follows excerpts from the warning: Ahead of the Valentine's Day which will hold on Wednesday, 14 February 2018, the Director General of the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA), Dr. Sani Aliyu, has called on Nigerians, especially the youths not to engage in unprotected sex.\n\nHe said it was important that all Nigerians know their HIV/status, .. A young person not tested may not have the opportunity to enjoy future Valentine's Days, if he or she is diagnosed late or presents with terminal complications related to HIV infection and AIDS.\n\nThe NACA boss revealed that, at least, 15 per cent of Nigerian youths lose their virginity before the age of 15. He said that about 4.2 per cent of persons between the ages of 15 and 24 have HIV. The DG noted that first sexual contact in Nigeria begins at less than 15 years for 15 per cent of Nigeria's youth.... Only 17 per cent of young people know their HIV status. The DG states that new HIV infections are currently highest among young people aged 15 - 24 years. It is important to encourage the use of barrier protection such as condoms, which prevent STDs including HIV and unwanted pregnancies. Before commenting on the sexual warning to Nigerians by the Director General of the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA), Dr, Sani Aliyu, I want to assert that if Nigeria's socio-economic and health problems are enumerated in order of priority from one to a hundred (1 - 100), HIV/AIDS shall list 100. In August 1987, the Federal Government adopted a blue-print titled, National Health Policy and Strategy to achieve health for all Nigerians by the year 2000. It was initiated by the then Minister of Health and Human Services, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, a Professor of Paediatrics under the military President, Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida. In fact, Professor Ransome-Kuti had dismissed the existence of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria then, pointing out that Nigerians were dying of preventable and curable diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, cough and cholera. Professor Ransome-Kuti, however, believed that Nigerians were giving births to too many children. Therefore, he initiated in 1987, a government's population policy of one-woman-four-children at a cost of N228 million which was financially aided by USAID. Under Obasanjo's government, in 2004, and through his Minister of Health, Professor Eyitan Lambo, a new population policy of one-man-four-children was introduced. In a national broadcast in the evening of 9 January 2007, President Obasanjo announced that the meeting of National Council of State earlier on that date had adopted the census figures of 140,003,542 presented as the total population of Nigeria by the National Population Commission. He said among other things, \"This figure represents a 3.2 annual growth rate. This rate implies that, even with our planned annual economic growth rate of a minimum of 10 per cent, we need to seriously face up to the challenge of moderating our population growth to about 2 per cent to enable us to double the growth of our national economy every eight or nine years. We must also bear in mind that high rates of poverty generally correlates with large households. One way of addressing this critical matter is through more focussed attention on girl-child education and the discouragement of such unprogressive cultural practices as early child marriage.\" The Idea of overpopulation in Nigeria, and indeed in the whole of Africa, was propagated by the US controlled United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) in 1994, while, at the same time, another arm of the United Nations, UNAID, also controlled by the United States propagated that Africa's population was being decimated by HIV/AIDS. Although no HIV tests were carried out to ascertain the number of people infected, because it was too expensive, terrifying figures were manufactured to support estimated number of HIV infected people and AIDS deaths in Africa. Under the pretext of combating the spread of HIV and subsequent AIDS' deaths in Nigeria, Literate Zombies are recruited and remunerated by the global economic dictators to become condom evangelists. Since Nigeria's Literate Zombies are too mentally lazy to invoke their God's given right to self enquiries, they cannot discern that a country cannot be decimated by an incurable and deadly disease and at the same time be overpopulated. Although the first Colonial Governor General of Nigeria, Frederick John Dealtry Lugard, was a racist, he did not fail to observe that every matured female in Black Africa was mated. On overpopulation he remarked thus, \"The custom, which seems fairly general among the negro tribes, of suckling a child for two or three years, during which a woman lives apart from her husband, tends to decrease population (p.66, The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa, By F.J.D. Lugard).\" Unlike Europe and United States of America, Africans are born with sexual discipline. Prior to cultural and traditional pollution of Africa by the colonialists, sexual intercourse was restricted within marriage couples and between a man and a woman. During the three years a nursing mother breast-fed her child, the man maintained abstinence. Through Literate Zombies, we are now forced to adopt Euro-American sexual behaviours and perversities. While the tradition in our culture was that sexual intercourse between a man and a woman should be flesh to flesh, we are now being taught through Literate Zombies that a penis enveloped in a condom, which turns a woman into a masturbating machine for a man, is the new trend so as not to be infected with HIV and die of AIDS. However, on the infectivity of HIV, the Nobel Prize Winner in Chemistry, in 1993, Professor Kary Mullis, told us, \"Human beings are full of retroviruses, and neither HIV nor any other retrovirus by itself poses any kind of threat. Which is not to say that there is no such thing as AIDS - only that HIV doesn't cause it (p. 154, Positively False, Exposing the Myths Around HIV and AIDS BY Joan Shenton). Kary Mullis received Nobel Price for inventing the gene-amplification technique called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCP) that made it possible to detect a very tinny and dormant virus like HIV in the blood. That HIV is very difficult to transmit, Professor of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of Berkeley, USA, Peter H. Duesberg wrote, \".. HIV could never survive in evolution from sexual transmission. Based on studies ... conducted by the CDC (USA's Centre for Disease Control) and others, it takes on average 1000 unprotected sexual contacts to transmit HIV. According to Rosenberg and Weiner, HIV infection in non-drug using prostitutes tends to be low or absent, implying that sexual activity alone does not place them at high risk. ...//... Since about 10 to 30 sexual contacts are required to generate a child, but 1000 contacts are required to transmit HIV, HIV could never survive natural selection on the basis of sexual transmission, because the host would outgrow the parasite. ...//... The extremely low efficiency of sexual transmission of HIV also predicts that the safe-sex campaigns by the HIV orthodoxy will be of very limited value. Only those who would benefit are those who have an average of 1000 sexual contacts with HIV positives (p.248, AIDS: Virus or Drug Induced? Edited By Peter H. Duesberg).\" Professor Luc Montagnier, the discoverer of Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus (LAV), later renamed HIV by the USA, admitted to the fact that HIV by itself is not harmful and can only be rendered pathogenic by co-factors (p. 241, Inventing the AIDS Virus, by Peter H. Duesberg). At the Cold Spring Harbour meeting of Scientists, Dr Robert Gallo remarked, \"Montagnier did not conclude that their virus (LAV) was the cause of AIDS (p. 167, Virus Hunting by Robert C. Gallo).\" While Nigeria's Literate Zombies in year 2018 are still running around to preach condom-ized sex so as to prevent the spread of HIV infection, the British Guardian newspaper of Monday, 9 March 1987, reported Britain's Chief Medical Officer, Sir Donald Acheson, as having said of AIDS, \"It is not very infectious, you have a one in a hundred chance of catching it from sex with an infected person.\" Over eight years later, the curate at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Dungarvan, co. Waterford, Ireland, Father Michael Kennedy, revealed on Sunday, 10 September 1995,that a woman AIDS avenger had confessed to him of deliberately infecting 85 men with HIV. Reacting to the claim, the former Irish AIDS co-ordinator, Dr. James Welsh, in the Wednesday, 13 September 1995, issue of the London Times, categorically rejected the claim of the AIDS' woman avenger. He said, \"The woman would have had to have sex with each man 500 times to infect him according to the latest medical research. Some researchers say 1000 times (p.3).\" A section of Nigeria's Literate Zombies now deals in importation of condoms into Nigeria which was put at 400 million packets in 2017 under the pretence of safe sex and fighting HIV/AIDS. Another section of the Literate Zombies deals in importing oral and injectable contraceptives on a large scale into Nigeria for the purpose of what the UNFPA beautifully call, Access to Reproductive Health, which in reality means Family Planning or indirect population control.\n\nThe above explanations about the infectivity of HIV render useless the advice of the Director General of NACA, Dr Sani Aliyu, to the Nigerian Youths to know their HIV status. The medical facilities in Nigeria are not capable of carrying out such a large scale test even if it were necessary. Leaving that aside let us look at the statistics presented by Dr. Sani Aliyu to justify his call on the Nigerian Youths to test themselves for HIV. He stated, \"... at least 15 per cent of Nigerian youths lose their virginity before the age of 15.\" The expression, 'at least' before the 15% indicates that Dr. Sani is only guessing and that he has no evidence that Nigerian youths lose their virginity before the age of fifteen. Otherwise he should have stated how many youths before the age fifteen are in Nigeria. Furthermore, he told Nigerians that 'about 4.2% of persons between the ages of 15 and 24 have HIV. Again we need to know how many Nigerians are between the age bracket, 15 and 24, before Dr. Aliyu's insinuation about 4.2% can make sense statistically. Dr. Aliyu noted that first sexual contact in Nigeria begins at less than 15 years for 15 % of Nigeria's youth... Once more, Dr. Aliyu's assertion will make sense if the number of Nigerian youths below the age of 15 are known. Dr. Aliyu followed it up by asserting that Only 17% of young people know their HIV status without telling his readers how many young people are in Nigeria. Finally, the Director General of NACA, Dr. Sani Aliyu, stated that new HIV infections are currently highest among young people aged 15-24 years. Again, Dr. Aliyu's statistic is a fraud since he did not tell readers how many young people between the age of 15 and 24 are in Nigeria and which other age group was he comparing with. As it is in NACA, so are they in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Nigeria because they are manned by Literate Zombies whose duties are to serve foreign interest and not Nigeria's interest. A while ago, I objected to the harangue of Philp Emeagwali, Gabriel Oyibo, Chris Imafidon and Enoch Opeyemi by some debaters on this forum. Their crime, according to debaters, was that they claimed unmerited academic achievements. As for Emeagwali and Oyibo, I drew attention of debaters to the fact that none of the two was ever employed in the service of any of the MDAs in Nigeria. Consequently, Nigerians have not suffered anything from their alleged false claims. Nigeria has a lot of Ministries, Departments and Agencies created to solve both known and envisaged socio-economic problems in the country. Nigerians who claimed to have requisite education to solve our country's economic, industrial and infrastructural problems have not only been employed and remunerated to enhance productions but huge financial and material resources have been placed at their disposals to accomplish the desired goals. Nigerian Engineers, Scientists and Economists in the MDAs collect not only their salaries and fringe benefits but steal monies appropriated for projects in Nigeria. Employed Nigerians at the MDAs of Nigeria have not been able to demonstrate knowledge attributed to them in their certificates. Claims to knowledge by Nigeria's officials at MDAs are just as false as that of Philip Emeagwali and Gabriel Oyibo with the difference that the latter are less devastating and harmful to Nigeria than the employees at Nigeria's MDAs. If one is educated, one must be able to demonstrate in practice what one is educated in, whereas a literate Zombie possesses no practical knowledge to demonstrate except to follow or obey commands.\n\nS. Kadiri\n\nWhat is the definition of intelligence, asked Samuel Zalanga? Any attempt to define intelligence will be equal to trying to define wisdom and as the Yoruba adage says, OGBÓN ODÚN YI WÈRÈ ÈMI, meaning: this year's wisdom is next year's lunacy. Intelligence is recognised in relation to action or behaviour in solving or approaching any current problem confronting people or the society as whole. What Nigerians may consider as intelligent statement may be considered as unintelligent by the Americans or Europeans. An example is when iron ore was discovered at Ajaokuta in 1961, the Nigerian Prime Minister at that time, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, desired that Nigeria should use the iron ore to develop iron and steel industry in the country. The Americans counselled him that since there was surplus of steel in the world market, Nigeria should not utilise its iron ore to produce steel, rather it would be economically wise to export the iron ore raw. Balewa shrewdly asked his American advisers what the importers of Nigeria's iron ore were going to do with it when there was surplus of steel in the world market? The American advisers evaded Balewa's enquiry and told him, instead, that it would be cheaper for Nigeria to buy steel from the surplus world market than erecting iron and steel industry in Nigeria. Balewa thanked the American advisers and told them that the iron and steel industry would create more than half a million jobs for Nigeria and in addition encourage Nigerians in creative technologies like machine productions etc. To Nigerians Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was intelligent in his decision not to export jobs from Nigeria by importing Steel in exchange for iron ore export. Although the iron and steel industry is still a dream today, we can only blame well-remunerated western educated Nigerians who are employed there but have failed to perform.\n\nElsewhere, Kayode J. Fakinlede counselled in his post of Tuesday, 27 February 2018 thus, \"Let us not unnecessarily hero-worship the mental capacity of the Europeans. They are just human beings like ourselves. Through their own struggles to make life better for themselves, they have made inventions that are beneficial to the world...\" No one is hero-worshiping the mental capacity of Europeans but I think the time has come when we as a people should halt to reflect on where we are, how we got to where we are and where are we going next. It is of concern to me that nearly all African countries are engaged in wars being waged with weapons from Europe and the US. Whenever their cargo ships anchore in our seaports, they off-load weapons, bleaching creams, oral and injectable contraceptives, synthetic hairs and many at times toxic wastes from their industries. While departing African seaports, they load their ships with agricultural and mineral resources especially to the natural resources poor European countries to feed their industries. We, the natural resources rich countries are undeveloped and poor. If we are human beings like them why could they capture us as slaves and cart us to America and the Caribbean Islands to toil in the plantations for them? And if we are the same human beings like them why are we now indirectly enslaved through the control of natural resources in our territories? I agree that they make life better for themselves, but at our expense. The crumps which they throw at the African facilitators of our exploitation are erroneously referred to as benefit to us, Africans, whereas those crumps are nothing but lubricants intended to neutralize frictions in the machinery of self-administered slavery that we call independence.\n\nI can understand the frustrations of Mr. Kadiri here. Seeing that Africans are lagging behind the rest of the world in technological development, it is easy to come to a conclusion that something is wrong with our intelligence. ...//... We spend too much time castigating ourselves and talking ourselves down This is pitiable indeed - Kayode J. Fakinlede.\n\nI am not frustrated but angry to observe that whenever the chains tied around our necks and ankles by the global economic dictators were slightly loosen, it had been through the efforts of American-Europeans with good conscience, while we, the victim, remain not only passive onlookers to our own exploitations and humiliations but we aid and abet our economic exploiters. Our relation with the white world is that of the horse and its rider and if we are the same human being like them, why should they be riding us all the time or why could we not ride them too in the name of equilibrium and reciprocity? Talking about our unintelligent behaviours that have made us prone to other peoples exploitations and dehumanisation is not to castigate and talk ourselves down. Who are working in the cocoa plantations and who are eating chocolate cakes and drinking chocolate beverages? Who are working in the coffee plantations and who are drinking coffee? Who are digging gold and diamonds from both earth surface and deep wells and who are wearing jewel ornaments? Who are exporting crude oil and who are sleeping at the petrol station to buy fuel?\n\nEven now, there are many Africans all over the world and in many areas of human endeavour doing fantastic work to elevate the well being of humanity - Kayode Fakinlede.\n\nI have heard religious people preach, love your neighbours as yourself, and not, love your neighbours more than yourself. Thus, Africans must first work in all areas of human endeavours in Africa to uplift the wellbeing of Africans before extending such work to the rest of humanity. Africans cannot be fantastic house builders all over the world to provide decent accommodations for humanity while at the same time Africans are dwelling in squalors unless those fantastic African house builders are labourers in the world.\n\nOur biggest problem, to me, is Africans castigating the intelligence of other Africans. We, particularly the educated ones, have completely shut ourselves out of educating ourselves about the achievement of Africans - Kayode J. Fakinlede.\n\nÒGÚN the muse of creativity, deity of metallurgy and patron of blacksmith was born at a hilltop in Ile Ife. The name of his mother was Tabutu and his father's name was Òróna. Ògún left Ile Ife to settle in the present day Ìrè Èkìtì where he was the first to mine iron ore and working it into metal from which he invented cutlasses, hoes and subsequently axes. His inventions revolutionized agriculture at that time not only in Ìrè Èkìtì but the entire Yoruba land. That was why he became a deity, worshiped in all kinds of manners throughout Yorubaland. Ògun was an intelligent person of his era. However, the foundation of Ògún's iron and steel knowledge was destroyed by the British colonialists that turned Nigeria into importer of cutlasses and axes from Britain in the 1950s. Long after the demise of Ògún, the Yoruba had been manufacturing guns, similar to those used during the 1st world war, from his metal technology. Had our technological developments not been destroyed by the colonialists, Nigeria would not have had any problem with building iron and steel industry, planned since 1961, at Ajaokuta. I do not believe that the existence of Ajaokuta Steel Industry only in name, since 1961, constitutes any achievement and, as such, stating the incapability and failure of the supposedly qualified Nigerian academics employed and paid to produce steel at Ajaokuta, cannot reasonably constitute castigation of their intelligence.\n\nIn all fields of human endeavours to make life easier, our people were making progress before the slave raids interrupted our developments in Africa. In his Trade and Politics in the Niger Delta, 1830-1885, Professor Kenneth Onwuka Dike, referred to the 1888 observation of Consul H.H. Johnston thus, \"A native salt of old standing continues. The salt is made extensively by Jakrymen (actually Itsekiri men) from the leaves of a willow-like tree not unlike the mangrove; which are burnt; the ashes are soaked and washed, then evaporated; the residue represents native salt, which is now being preferred for many uses to introduced salt (p.22).\" It is noteworthy that Consul Johnston described the salt produced by our Intelligent Itsekiri people as native salt but the one that the British colonialist wanted to introduce to the people of Niger Delta was not described as native English salt but only as salt. Itsekiri people who were verse in the production of salt were murdered by the colonialists in order to make our people dependable on British supply of salt. The destillation and production of Gin in Nigeria, called Ògógóró in Yoruba and Kain-Kain in Ijaw languages, was outlawed by the British colonialists who branded it illicit gin. A country that had reached the age of bronze, as archaeological antiquities in Benin and Ife had confirmed, could not have lacked intelligent people. High intelligence was required to identify different types of metals fused together to create an alloy called bronze. Our great ancestors did not only discover copper, zink, tin and aluminium in nature, but knew what to do with them. Nigeria's literate zombies have been sitting and gazing at the huge iron ore deposits at Ajaokuta for the past 57 years without knowing what to do with it. Nigeria's literate zombies are waiting for foreign partners who are just human beings like them and who are academically less educated to them to come and erect an iron and steel industry for them to manage. Nigeria's MDAs contain shameless literate zombies lacking self-esteems, dignity and possessing heart of venoms and conscience of hyenas. They have, inexcusably continued to fail the nation and advertise themselves as the black man's show of crass incompetence and mental inferiority. To Nigeria's literate zombies, education amounts to nothing but ego-boosting chauvinism. Funds are earmarked for projects but Nigerians never eye-see any project because English speaking Nigeria's literate zombies always steal funds appropriated for projects and keep them in the countries of global economic dictators.\n\nDespite the fact that billions of dollars have been spent on Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the Nigerian Crude Oil Refineries since 1999 till date, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Chief Operating Officer Upstream, Dr. Rabiu Bello, on Thursday, 1st March 2018, admitted that the Nigerian refineries are not performing optimally. He said, \"We want to operate optimally but with efficient partnerships. It is a thing of shame that Nigeria, as the largest producer of crude (oil) in Africa and the 13th largest in the World, is the largest importer of petrol and the only OPEC country that imports refined products (crude oil).\" https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/fg-admits-refineries-not-performing-optimally/\n\nWhat is Dr. Rabiu Bello operating at NNPC when the refineries are actually in coma?\n\nIf we take into consideration the natural resources at the disposal of Nigeria, a climate devoid of natural disasters like earth quakes and typhoons, and coupled with high index manpower as evidenced by the academic qualifications of Nigerians employed in Nigeria's MDAs, Nigeria should be developed economically and industrially more than France, Benelux, Netherland, Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Britain because these countries of Europe are natural resources extremely poor. That Nigeria is economically and industrially underdeveloped depends on the mental inferiority of Nigeria's literate zombies and instead of measuring their intelligence quotients, IQ, it will be more appropriate to measure their stupidity quotients, SQ.\n\nS.
