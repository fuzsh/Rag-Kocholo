        "text": "Assalamu Alaikum\n\nHonorable Sir\n\nVote of thankfulness for this beautiful and informative materials on IQ and brain. Everyone is unique in this earth. Intelligence is gifted to everybody is some case. So, we should not under-estimate anyone. It is our duty to explore and exercise it. Different people defined it in different ways but, after experiencing your indicative abilities of intelligence, it is clear that each of us has it. The measurement process is pretty impressive and the list of the greatest IQ holders is informative too. The most moving part of your message to me is the segment where you described how we can improve our IQ. I think this portion is to be stressed much to make ourselves more sharp, as you said IQ can be improved by scientific training and patient practice. May ALLAH (SWT) bless us all with that patience. Thank you.\n\nPrayers and blessings\n\nJAHIR\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt's my immense pleasure to inform u that ur MSG-162 is a complete package including the meaning and evaluation process of IQ for Human Being. I really appreciate the methods mentioned in ur MSG regarding the evaluation process of IQ for Human being.\n\nThanks for uploading such an articulated MSG dedicated for the enrichment of Human being.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThis message shows how interesting and how funny our Iq is.And Iq no. of some scholars tell us how much God gifted tallents the possessed.\n\nMy personal view is Iq is mainly two types.One is God gifted and another one is developed by men.Some scholars like Kazi Nazrul Islam, Dr. Mohammad Sahidullah possessed God gifted Iq and some scholars like Bil Gates,Steve Jobs had their unique Iq.God gifted or Man made both types of Iq are important.We shouldn't focus on whether we possess God gifted Iq or not rather we should try to improve our general knowlwdge and make our way of thinking very unique.By the way I have been very happy seeing George W Bush has the lowest Iq among all American presidents.\n\nThank You\n\nMohi Uddin"
