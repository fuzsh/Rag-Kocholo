https://YouTube.com/emeagwali\n\nPodcast: https://SoundCloud.com/emeagwali\n\nThe need to calculate\n\nis as old as humanity.\n\nThe need to compute\n\nexisted because it is central to\n\nhuman existence.\n\nThe Latin equivalence\n\nof the word “computer”\n\nwas first used in print\n\ntwo thousand years ago.\n\nThe word “computer”\n\nwas first used by the Roman author\n\nPliny the Elder.\n\nThe word “supercomputer”\n\nwas coined in 1967.\n\nI believe that our children’s children\n\nwill coin a new word\n\nfor their supercomputers.\n\nI believe that our children’s children\n\nwill invent supercomputers\n\nthat are science fiction to us.\n\nContributions of Philip Emeagwali to Algebra\n\nThe discovery and recovery\n\nof every single barrel of oil\n\nfrom any oilfield\n\nin the Niger-Delta region of Nigeria\n\nmust be preceded\n\nby the massively parallel processed solution of the toughest problem\n\nin extreme-scale algebra.\n\nFor the fifteen years, inclusive\n\nof from the 20th of June of 1974\n\nthat I was in Corvallis, Oregon, United States\n\nthrough the Fourth of July 1989\n\nin Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States,\n\nI conducted my supercomputer research,\n\nand did so from speeds of\n\none million instructions per second\n\nin Oregon\n\nto billions upon billions\n\nof floating-point arithmetical calculations\n\nthat I executed across\n\na new internet\n\nthat is outlined and defined\n\nby a new global network of\n\ntwo-raised-to-power sixteen\n\ntightly-coupled processors\n\nthat are commonly available\n\nin the market.\n\nEach of those 64 binary thousand\n\ncommodity processors\n\noperated its own operating system.\n\nEach of those 65,536 processors\n\nhas its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shares nothing with each other.\n\nI was in the news in 1989\n\nbecause I invented\n\nhow to solve the most\n\ncomputation-intensive problems\n\narising in large-scale\n\nalgebraic computations.\n\nSuch problems arose from discretizing partial differential equations\n\nthat, in turn, arose from\n\nphysics-based supercomputer simulations\n\nof the motions of fluids\n\nthat flow below the surface of the Earth,\n\nsuch as the mile-deep\n\ncrude oil, injected water, and natural gas\n\nin the Niger-Delta region of Nigeria;\n\nand from supercomputer simulations\n\nof the motions of fluids\n\nthat flow on the surface of the Earth,\n\nsuch as the River Niger, Lake Chad,\n\nand the Atlantic ocean;\n\nand from supercomputer simulations\n\nof the motions of fluids\n\nthat flow above the surface of the Earth,\n\nsuch as atmospheric rivers\n\nthat are defined\n\nas bands of moisture in the sky\n\nthat can discharge as much water\n\nas many land rivers.\n\nFollowing my invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat occurred\n\non the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nand that occurred in Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States,\n\nthe top publications\n\nin petroleum engineering and mathematics credited I—Philip Emeagwali—\n\nwith the invention\n\nof how to solve the toughest problems\n\narising in extreme-scale algebra\n\nthat must be solved\n\nas a pre-condition for discovering\n\nand recovering\n\notherwise elusive\n\ncrude oil and natural gas.\n\nFor fifteen years,\n\nmy supercomputer research on how to solve\n\nthe toughest problems\n\narising in large-scale algebraic computations\n\nand how to solve them across\n\na new internet\n\nthat is a new ensemble of 65,536\n\ncommonly-available processors\n\nthat were identical\n\nand that were equal distances apart\n\nwas criticized, scorned, and rejected.\n\nMy invention\n\nof how to solve the most extreme-scale problems arising in algebra\n\nand how to solve them across\n\nmy new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\n65,536 commodity processors\n\nwas only accepted\n\nafter the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe date that I invented it.\n\nTo the non-mathematician,\n\nmy mathematical invention is abstract\n\nand impenetrable.\n\nBut my contributions\n\nto calculus and algebra\n\nmade sense to the research mathematician.\n\nFor that reason, my contributions\n\nto using the modern supercomputer\n\nto solve the toughest problems\n\narising in calculus and algebra\n\nwas the cover stories\n\nof top mathematics publications,\n\nsuch as the May 1990 issue\n\nof the SIAM News.\n\nThe SIAM News\n\nis the flagship publication\n\nof the mathematics community.\n\nThe SIAM News\n\nis published by the Society for\n\nIndustrial and Applied Mathematics.\n\nI was not on the cover\n\nof top mathematics publications\n\nbecause I was good looking.\n\nI was on the cover\n\nof top mathematics publications\n\nbecause I contributed\n\nnew algebraic knowledge\n\nto the existing body of knowledge\n\nwritten in algebra textbooks,\n\nnamely, I invented\n\nhow to solve the toughest problems\n\narising in algebra and calculus\n\nand invented how to solve them across\n\nmy new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of processors\n\nthat emulates one seamless, cohesive\n\nnew supercomputer.\n\nWho Invented the Quadratic Equation?\n\nMy first introduction to algebra\n\nwas in mid-1964\n\nin the fifth grade\n\nin Agbor, in the Midwestern Region\n\nof Nigeria.\n\nMy first algebra textbook\n\nwas written by an English schoolmaster\n\nnamed Clement Vavasor “CV” Durell.\n\nWho invented the quadratic equation\n\nof algebra?\n\nThe quadratic equation\n\nis one of the most important contributions\n\nto mathematics\n\nthat was made by Africans\n\nand made in Africa.\n\nThe quadratic equation\n\nwas first solved\n\nin the Berlin Papyrus.\n\nThe Berlin Papyrus\n\nwas excavated in Africa\n\nbut renamed after Berlin, Germany.\n\nIn the history of mathematics,\n\nit was the tradition\n\ncredit the mathematical knowledge\n\nthat was developed in Africa\n\nto Europe.\n\nFollowing that tradition\n\nof historians of mathematics,\n\nthe Berlin Papyrus\n\nwas credited to the city of Berlin, Germany\n\nand not named after\n\nthe city in Africa\n\nthat the Papyrus was excavated from.\n\nThe [quote unquote] “Berlin Papyrus”\n\nwas written in Africa\n\nand written by Africans\n\nand written between\n\nthree thousand seven hundred and twenty [3,720] years ago\n\nand four thousand one hundred and eighty [4,180] years ago.\n\nIn that African Papyrus\n\nthat was written four thousand years ago,\n\nthe quadratic equation\n\nwas stated as\n\nx squared plus y squared\n\nequals 100\n\nand y equals three-quarters\n\ndivided by the product of four and x.\n\nContributions of Philip Emeagwali to Algebra\n\nThe quadratic equation of algebra\n\nthat is in the homework assignment\n\nof a 12-year-old\n\ncontains at least one unknown variable\n\nthat is squared.\n\nThat unknown variable\n\nis often called x.\n\nThe 24 million system of\n\npartial difference equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat I solved\n\non the Fourth of July 1989\n\nand solved across a new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled,\n\ncommonly available processors\n\nthat made the news headlines\n\ncontained 24 million unknown variables.\n\nThat was a world record in algebra.\n\nIn my Fourth of July 1989\n\ninvention,\n\nI computed across a new internet.\n\nI visualized my new internet\n\nas my new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled processors\n\nwith each processor\n\noperating its own operating system\n\nand with each processor\n\nhaving its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\nEach processor within my new internet\n\nhad one hundred and thirty-one thousand\n\nand seventy-two [131,072] bytes of memory\n\nthat I used\n\nfor the integer and logical operations\n\nthat arose\n\nfrom my algebraic computations.\n\nI also used\n\ntwo thousand and forty-eight [2,048] floating point co-processors.\n\nI used those co-processors\n\nto execute\n\nmy floating point arithmetical computations.\n\nEach co-processor\n\nhad four megabytes of memory.\n\nThe frontier of extreme-scale algebra\n\nis far beyond the quadratic equation\n\nthat contains two unknown variables\n\nthat was first solved\n\nfour thousand years ago\n\nin Africa.\n\nExtreme-scale algebra\n\narise during the general circulation modeling\n\nthat must be used to foresee\n\notherwise unforeseeable\n\nglobal warmings.\n\nExtreme-scale algebra\n\nis used to discover and recover\n\notherwise elusive\n\ncrude oil and natural gas.\n\nExtreme-scale algebra\n\nis used to solve the toughest problems\n\narising in computational physics.\n\nThe most important quest\n\nin algebra\n\nwas to theoretically\n\nand experimentally invent\n\nhow to solve extreme-scale\n\ntri-diagonal system of equations\n\nof algebra\n\nand how to solve those equations across\n\nmillions upon millions\n\nof tightly-coupled processors\n\nwith each processor\n\noperating its own operating system\n\nand with each processor\n\nhaving its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\nOne reason I was the cover stories\n\nof mathematics publications\n\nwas because\n\nI mathematically discovered\n\nthat it’s impossible\n\nto reduce a tri-diagonal system of equations\n\nof algebra\n\nand reduce it\n\nto a mathematically equivalent\n\ndiagonal system of equations\n\nof algebra.\n\nI, de facto, circumvented that impossibility\n\nby taking two steps backward\n\nand to the granite core\n\nof the physical problem\n\nthat is mathematically modeled,\n\nnamely, the extreme-scale\n\npetroleum reservoir simulation,\n\nthat was governed by\n\na tri-diagonal system of equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat arose from discretizing\n\na system of partial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus\n\nand arose from approximating\n\nthat system\n\nby a companion system\n\nof partial difference equations\n\nof a new algebra.\n\nIt was at that granite core\n\nof the most excruciatingly-detailed\n\npetroleum reservoir simulation\n\nthat I reformulated\n\nthe partial differential equations\n\nthat is a new calculus\n\nthat was not in any calculus textbook\n\nthat was printed in the 1970s or earlier.\n\nThe reason my contributions to mathematics\n\nwas the cover story\n\nof the top mathematics publication, namely,\n\nthe May 1990 issue\n\nof the SIAM News\n\nof the Society of Industrial\n\nand Applied Mathematics\n\nwas that I created a new calculus\n\nand I did so\n\nby inventing thirty-six [36] additional\n\npartial derivative terms\n\nof calculus.\n\nIn the old calculus\n\nthat is used to recover\n\notherwise unrecoverable\n\ncrude oil and natural gas,\n\nonly forty-five [45]\n\npartial derivative terms\n\nrepresented the Second Law of Motion\n\nof physics\n\nthat was encoded\n\ninto the three-phased—crude oil,\n\ninjected water, and natural gas—\n\nextreme-scaled\n\npetroleum reservoir simulator.\n\nMy contributions\n\nto the body of mathematical knowledge\n\ncalled calculus and algebra are these:\n\nI added the thirty-six [36]\n\npartial derivative terms\n\nof modern calculus\n\nthat I invented\n\nto the forty-five [45]\n\npartial derivative terms\n\nthat prior research mathematicians\n\ninvented.\n\nAnd I did so to bring the total\n\npartial derivative terms\n\nto eighty-one (81).\n\nIn the advanced calculus textbooks\n\nand in the old paradigm\n\nof extreme-scale algebraic computations\n\narising from\n\npetroleum reservoir simulations,\n\nthe governing system of coupled, non-linear,\n\ntime-dependent, and state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern mathematics\n\nwas parabolic, instead of hyperbolic.\n\nIn my new paradigm\n\nof extreme-scale algebraic computations,\n\nthat enabled me to\n\nmassively parallel process\n\nand to process across a new internet\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas a new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled,\n\ncommonly available processors\n\nthat shared nothing with each other\n\nand in that new paradigm\n\nmy system of coupled, non-linear,\n\ntime-dependent, and state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus is hyperbolic,\n\nnot parabolic as written in\n\ncalculus textbooks.\n\nMy contributions to calculus\n\nwas a paradigm shift because\n\nsuch governing\n\npartial differential equations\n\nare described in all the textbooks\n\nas parabolic, instead of hyperbolic.\n\nThey are described in calculus textbooks\n\non the multi-phase and multi-physics\n\nporous media flow\n\nof crude oil, injected water, and natural gas,\n\nsuch as the crude oil and natural gas\n\nflowing from the water injection wells\n\nto the crude oil and natural gas wells\n\nacross the oilfields\n\nof the Niger Delta region\n\nof southeastern Nigeria.\n\nPredicting Algebraic Error Propagation\n\nBack in the early 1980s,\n\nI was in College Park, Maryland.\n\nI was a research computational mathematician in College Park.\n\nThe contributions to mathematics\n\nthat I made in the early 1980s\n\nwere the cover stories\n\nof the top mathematics publications,\n\nsuch as the May 1990 issue\n\nof the SIAM News\n\nthat was published by\n\nthe Society of Industrial\n\nand Applied Mathematics.\n\nMy quest\n\nfor new mathematical knowledge\n\nwas in the fields of calculus and\n\nnumerical analysis.\n\nMy greatest focus\n\nwas in the field of extreme-scaled\n\ncomputational mathematics.\n\nI focused on never-before-seen ways\n\nof using the most abstract\n\nand the most advanced\n\narithmetical knowledge\n\nand using that knowledge\n\nto solve the toughest problems\n\nthat arise in computational physics\n\nthat otherwise will be unsolveable.\n\nMy new field\n\n—of never-before-seen\n\nextreme-scaled computations—\n\nwas at the crossroad\n\nbetween calculus and algebra\n\nand between arithmetic\n\nand the computer.\n\nI redefined my numerical analysis\n\nas between\n\nthe singular processor\n\nthat computes sequentially\n\nand my ensemble of processors\n\nthat computes in parallel,\n\nor that solves many problems\n\nat once.\n\nIn 1989, it made the news headlines\n\nthat an African supercomputer wizard\n\nin the United States\n\nhad invented\n\nhow to use 65,536 processors\n\nto solve as many problems in parallel.\n\nI am that African supercomputer scientist\n\nthat was in the news\n\nonward of 1989.\n\nI was in the news because I invented\n\nhow to use one billion processors\n\nto solve one billion\n\ninitial-boundary value problems\n\nof calculus\n\nand how to solve them in parallel\n\nand, specifically, how to compute across\n\na new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\ntwo-raised-to-power sixteen\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat were married together\n\nas one seamless, cohesive\n\nmassively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nand married together\n\nby sixteen times as many\n\nemail wires.\n\nThe mathematical analysis\n\nthat was at the theoretical foundation\n\nof my extreme-scale\n\ncomputational mathematics\n\nand that preceded\n\nmy invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nis called\n\nthe stability analysis\n\nof finite difference discretizations\n\nof partial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus.\n\nStability analysis\n\nwas the extremely rigorous\n\nand the analytical procedure\n\nthat I used to derive a priori error estimate\n\nof the rate of propagation\n\nof initial errors\n\nand the rate as I computed forward in time\n\nand computed within each processor\n\nand communicated across\n\nmy new ensemble of 65,536\n\ntightly-coupled, commodity processors\n\nwith each processor\n\noperating its own operating system\n\nand with each processor\n\nhaving its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\nAfter going through some dense\n\nand abstract stability analyses\n\nin the early 1980s\n\nand after conducting companion computational experiments,\n\nI mathematically discovered\n\nthat explicit finite difference\n\nalgebraic approximations\n\nof the governing system of\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus\n\nthat include the thirty-six (36)\n\nnew partial derivative terms\n\nthat I invented\n\nallow longer computational time-steps\n\nwhich, in turn, makes my calculations faster.\n\nThat mathematical invention\n\nwas how I greatly reduced\n\nthe vexing time-step limit\n\nthat textbooks on computational physics\n\ndescribe as the Courant Condition.\n\nThat Courant Condition\n\nis the necessary condition\n\nfor the convergence\n\nof the numerical solution\n\nof an explicit\n\npartial difference equation\n\nto the analytical solution\n\nof the original partial differential equation\n\nthat it was approximating.\n\nThat mathematical invention\n\nwas how I bypassed\n\nthe empirical Darcy’s formula\n\nthat was outdated and invented\n\nback in 1856.\n\nThat mathematical invention\n\nwas how I replaced\n\na system of nine algebraic Darcy’s equations\n\nthat must be used by the petroleum industry to describe\n\nthe subterranean motions\n\nof multi-phased fluids.\n\nI invented and replaced\n\nthose nine algebraic Darcy’s equations\n\nwith my more rigorous\n\nsystem of nine partial differential equations\n\nof a new calculus\n\nthat I invented\n\nfrom first principles,\n\nor from the Second Law of Motion\n\nof physics.\n\nHenry Darcy’s Law\n\nis a statement in the fluid dynamics\n\nof flows across a porous medium.\n\nHenry Darcy’s Law\n\nstates that the velocities of crude oil, injected water,\n\nand natural gas flowing across\n\nthe permeable Niger Delta oilfields\n\nof southeastern Nigeria\n\nis due to the difference in pressure.\n\nHenry Darcy’s Law\n\nstates that the velocities\n\nof the crude oil, injected water,\n\nand natural gas\n\nare proportional to the pressure gradients\n\nin the direction\n\nof the flows of crude oil, injected water, and natural gas.\n\nThat mathematical invention,\n\ncalled Philip Emeagwali’s Equations,\n\nwas how I bypassed\n\nthe vexing\n\neight processor limit\n\nknown as Amdahl’s Law\n\nthat limits the number of processors\n\nthat should be incorporated\n\ninto massively parallel processing supercomputers.\n\nContributions of Philip Emeagwali to Algebra\n\nThe first automatic\n\nand sequential processing supercomputer\n\nthat was programmable\n\nwas invented in 1946.\n\nThat first supercomputer\n\nwas invented\n\nto be programmed to solve\n\na large system of equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat arose from the\n\nfinite difference discretizations\n\nof ordinary differential equations\n\nof modern calculus\n\nthat, in turn, encoded\n\na set of laws of physics.\n\nWhat made the sequential processing supercomputer of 1946 unique\n\nwas that it computed automatically\n\nand was, therefore, programmable.\n\nFast forward twenty-eight [28] years\n\nfrom that first supercomputer,\n\nand to June 20, 1974,\n\nin Corvallis, Oregon,\n\nand I was programming\n\nthe first supercomputer\n\nthat could execute\n\nover one million instructions per second.\n\nI used that first supercomputer\n\nto solve the largest-scale problems\n\narising in modern algebra.\n\nFast forward fifteen [15] years,\n\nand to the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nI was in a dozen supercomputer centers\n\nacross the United States\n\nand I was programming\n\nthe first massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat could execute\n\nbillions of calculations\n\nand execute them across\n\nmy ensemble of up to\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled processors.\n\nWhy is Philip Emeagwali Famous?\n\nMy invention\n\nof a new supercomputer\n\nput me in the news headlines\n\nand in the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof the Wall Street Journal.\n\nI was the cover story\n\nof the June 1990 issue\n\nof the SIAM News.\n\nThe SIAM News\n\nis the top mathematics publication\n\nand is published by\n\nthe Society of Industrial\n\nand Applied Mathematics.\n\nThe cover stories in the SIAM News\n\nreport new inventions in mathematics\n\nand they are written by\n\nresearch mathematicians\n\nand written for research mathematicians.\n\nIn the cover story of the SIAM News\n\nof June 1990,\n\nit was reported that I—Philip Emeagwali—\n\nhad mathematically invented\n\nhow to solve the toughest problems\n\narising in modern calculus\n\nand arising in extreme-scale algebra\n\nand invented how to solve them across\n\na new ensemble of 65,536\n\ncommonly available processors.\n\nI invented\n\nhow to use that new supercomputer\n\nto solve many problems at once\n\nand to solve the largest-scaled problems\n\narising in modern algebra.\n\nContributions of Philip Emeagwali to Physics\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe state-of-the-art of that toughest problem in modern algebra\n\nwas a system of 24 million equations\n\nof algebra\n\nthat arose from\n\nmy finite difference discretizations\n\nof a system of partial differential equations\n\nthat I invented\n\nthat mathematically encoded\n\na set of laws of physics\n\nthat governs\n\nthe subterranean motions of crude oil, injected water, and natural gas\n\nthat flows one mile-deep\n\nunderneath the surface of the Earth\n\nand that flows from water injection wells\n\ntowards\n\ncrude oil and natural gas production wells.\n\nI visualized my new instrument\n\nof computational physics\n\nas a new internet\n\nthat I defined\n\nas my new global network\n\nof 65,536 tightly-coupled\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nwith each processor\n\noperating its own operating system\n\nand with each processor\n\nhaving its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\nI visualized my new internet\n\nas a new instrument\n\nfor solving\n\nthe most extreme-scaled\n\nproblems arising in algebra\n\nand for solving them\n\nas one seamless, cohesive unit\n\nthat is a new supercomputer de facto.\n\nThe defining feature\n\nof my invention\n\nof that new internet\n\nwas that the new technology\n\nenabled me to compute synchronously\n\nand to communicate automatically\n\nand to do so via emails\n\nthat I sent to and received from\n\ntwo-to-power-sixteen\n\nsixteen-bit long email addresses.\n\nEach of my 64 binary thousand\n\nemail addresses\n\nhad no @ sign or dot com suffix.\n\nSometimes, the Impossible is Possible\n\nBack in 1989,\n\nno author of any mathematics textbook\n\nunderstood the concept of\n\nsolving many problems at once,\n\nor in parallel.\n\nBack in 1989,\n\nSeymour Cray\n\nwas the spokesman\n\nfor the supercomputer community.\n\nIf Seymour Cray’s granddaughter\n\ncame to him for help\n\nwith her homework assignment\n\non how to solve\n\nmany mathematical problems at once,\n\nSeymour Cray\n\nwould not have been able\n\nto help her\n\nto solve her problem in parallel.\n\nThe reason was that Seymour Cray\n\nardently believed that\n\nthe supercomputer technology\n\nthat I invented\n\nthat enables parallel processing across\n\nmy ensemble of 65,536\n\ntightly-coupled processors\n\nwas impossible and science fiction.\n\nA Day in the Life of a Black Mathematician\n\nQuest of Philip Emeagwali for New Mathematical Physics\n\nI was an apprentice supercomputer scientist\n\nfor forty-five [45] years.\n\nAfter investing forty-five [45] years\n\nin the craft of supercomputing,\n\nI had the command of materials\n\nthat I needed to deliver\n\nmy supercomputer lectures\n\nin prose and poetry,\n\nrather than on blackboards and power points.\n\nAfter nearly half a century\n\nof supercomputing,\n\nI knew one or two things\n\nabout supercomputers\n\nthat nobody else knew.\n\nThat new knowledge\n\nthat I alone had\n\nwas how to solve the toughest problems\n\narising in physics\n\nand how to solve them at once.\n\nMy mathematical maturity\n\ngrew from the algebraic representation\n\nof the Second Law of Motion\n\nof physics\n\nthat was written as\n\nF=ma,\n\nor Force equals\n\nmass times acceleration.\n\nThat iconic formula, F=ma,\n\nis the most important formula\n\nin mathematics, science, and engineering.\n\nI learned that formula, F=ma,\n\nback in June 1970\n\nand I learned it in the eighth grade\n\nof Christ the King College,\n\nOnitsha, East Central State, Nigeria.\n\nContributions of Philip Emeagwali to Mathematical Physics\n\nFast forward a dozen years,\n\nI had taken as my second home\n\nhalf a dozen mathematics\n\nand physics departments\n\nthat were across the United States.\n\nMy second home\n\nwas mathematics and physics departments\n\nfrom Corvallis (Oregon)\n\nto Washington (District of Columbia)\n\nto College Park (Maryland).\n\nFor my first sixteen years\n\nin the United States,\n\nI made those mathematics\n\nand physics departments\n\nmy second home.\n\nAfter sixteen years\n\nin mathematics and physics departments,\n\nI had grown intellectually\n\nto become a research\n\ncomputational mathematician\n\nand to become a research\n\ncomputational physicist.\n\nThat intellectual maturity\n\nas a research mathematician\n\nand as a research physicist\n\nwas what enabled me\n\nto discover thirty-six [36] critical errors\n\nin the advanced textbooks\n\nin the mathematical physics\n\nthat governs\n\nthe flow of crude oil, injected water,\n\nand natural gas\n\nthat flows a mile-deep\n\ninside production oilfields.\n\nI corrected those thirty-six [36]\n\ncritical mathematical errors\n\nby inventing\n\nthirty-six [36] partial derivative terms\n\nthat ensured that F=ma\n\nand that ensured that\n\nthe equality holds\n\nwithin a system of nine new\n\npartial differential equations\n\nthat I invented\n\nand that encoded\n\nthe Second Law of Motion\n\nof physics\n\nand that encoded that law\n\nfor three-dimensional, three-phase flows\n\nwithin porous media,\n\nsuch as flow of crude oil, injected water,\n\nand natural gas across\n\nthe Oloibiri Oil Field\n\nof Bayelsa State of southeastern Nigeria\n\nthat was the first oilfield\n\nthat was discovered\n\nin West Africa back in 1956.\n\nThose thirty-six [36]\n\npartial derivative terms encoded\n\nthe thirty-six [36]\n\ntemporal and spatial components\n\nof the inertial forces\n\nin the three phases\n\nof crude oil, injected water, and natural gas\n\nthat were flowing along\n\nthe temporal\n\nand the three spatial directions\n\nof my new nine\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus.\n\nI continued across\n\nmy ensemble of 64 binary thousand\n\ntightly-coupled,\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat shared nothing with each other\n\nand I continued and I invented\n\nmy new nine partial differential equations.\n\nI discretized the latter\n\nfrom its formulation\n\nas a differential problem\n\nof modern calculus\n\nto the extreme-scaled problem\n\nof modern algebra.\n\nI did so to enable me\n\nto more accurately encode\n\nthe invisible subterranean motion\n\nof water\n\nthat is pumped into water injection wells\n\nand pumped because\n\nwater is cheaper than oil and natural gas\n\nand is, therefore, used to push\n\noil and natural gas\n\ntowards production wells.\n\nThings I Did in the Nation’s Capital\n\nFor me, the answer\n\nto the Grand Challenge Problem\n\nof mathematics and supercomputing\n\ndemanded my sixteen-year-long journey, onward of June 20, 1974\n\nfrom Corvallis, Oregon, United States\n\nthrough Los Alamos, New Mexico,\n\nUnited States\n\nto receiving the top prize in supercomputing\n\nfrom Silicon Valley, California.\n\nA research pure mathematician\n\nis re-searching a new proof\n\nof a deep and abstract theorem.\n\nI sojourned\n\nto an unknown world of technology.\n\nIn that sojourn, I used\n\nsixteen supercomputer-hopefuls\n\nas my guideposts along the new pathways\n\nto the never-before-seen\n\nglobal network of processors\n\nthat is a new internet\n\nthat is a new supercomputer\n\nand that is a new computer.\n\nA research applied mathematician\n\nis seeking\n\na new and better mathematical description,\n\nsuch as a system of coupled, non-linear,\n\ntime-dependent, and state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nthat governs\n\nan initial-boundary value problem\n\nof modern calculus.\n\nA research computational mathematician\n\nis seeking\n\na faster computational model,\n\nthat explains or predicts\n\na phenomenon\n\nthat is otherwise impossible\n\nto explain or predict.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early ‘80s,\n\nI was a research\n\ncomputational mathematician\n\nthat lived in room eight hundred\n\nand seventy-seven [877]\n\nof Meridian Hill Hall\n\nat twenty-six hundred and one [2601]\n\n16th Street\n\nthat was at the corner of\n\n16th Street and Euclid Street\n\nof Adams-Morgan neighborhood\n\nof northwest Washington, D.C.\n\nOn a Friday evening, I might have dinner\n\nwith my future-wife, Dale.\n\nOur favorite place\n\nwas an Ethiopian restaurant\n\nthat was a short walk\n\ndown 18th street\n\nfrom Columbia Road\n\nin the Adams-Morgan neighborhood.\n\nMy other favorite places are the small cafes\n\nalong “T” and “U” streets,\n\nand the Meridian Hill Park Drum Circle.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early ‘80s,\n\nI was most likely to be seen\n\nin the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C,\n\njogging across the Smithsonian’s\n\nNational Zoo of Washington, D.C.\n\nat 6 a.m. in the mornings.\n\nI also walked or jogged across\n\nthe Adams-Morgan neighborhood,\n\nor across the Dupont Circle neighborhood,\n\nor across the Foggy Bottom neighborhood,\n\nor across Rock Creek Park.\n\nThe 12-mile-long Rock Creek Park\n\nextends from the Potomac River\n\nto the border of Maryland.\n\nFoggy Bottom\n\nis named after the fog\n\nthat clings to the neighborhood\n\nin the morning.\n\nFoggy Bottom\n\nis a late 18th-century neighborhood\n\nand is one of the oldest neighborhoods\n\nin Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Dupont Circle\n\nhas a famous traffic circle\n\nand a water fountain at its center.\n\nFor me, the Dupont Circle drum circle\n\nand its array of late afternoon drummers and dancers\n\nwas like a church.\n\nFast forward to the late 1990s,\n\nand from the drum circles\n\nof Washington, D.C.\n\nto West African drummers\n\nin Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nMy wife Dale and I took lessons\n\non African dance and rhythm\n\nand from a charismatic griot\n\nand choreographer\n\nnamed Kibibi Ajanku.\n\nKibibi Ajanku\n\nwas the founding mother\n\nof the Sankofa Dance Theatre\n\nof Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nMy Night Life in the Nation’s Capital\n\nFrom October 1978 to May 1981,\n\nI lived a short walk\n\nfrom the Kilimanjaro Restaurant\n\nand Nightclub\n\nthat was started in 1982.\n\nKilimanjaro Restaurant\n\nand Nightclub was throbbing with\n\nlive African music and reggae.\n\nKilimanjaro Restaurant\n\nand Nightclub\n\nwas in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood\n\nof Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the early 1980s,\n\nI lived at 1915\n\nEast-West Highway,\n\napartment three zero three [303],\n\nSilver Spring, Maryland.\n\nAnd I walked the short distance\n\nto the railway subway station\n\ncalled Metro Station.\n\nThat underground railway station\n\nwas at the boundary\n\nbetween Silver Spring, Maryland\n\nand Washington, District of Columbia.\n\nOn weekdays, I took the\n\nWashington, D.C. rapid transit system\n\nto Foggy Bottom Station\n\nthat is west of the White House\n\nand in downtown Washington.\n\nFoggy Bottom\n\nwas a very short walk\n\nto the computer center\n\nwhere I programmed fast computers\n\nand used them to solve\n\nthe most computation-intensive\n\ninitial-boundary value problems\n\nof modern calculus\n\nthat was the mathematical foundation\n\nof computational fluid dynamics.\n\nMy Supercomputing in Washington, DC\n\nIn the early 1980s,\n\nmy massively parallel processing supercomputer research interests\n\nwere multidisciplinary.\n\nI investigated\n\ncomputation-intensive problems\n\narising in mathematical biology,\n\nsuch as the evolution equations.\n\nI investigated\n\nfluid-structure interactions\n\nwithin the cardiovascular system.\n\nAnd I investigated\n\nhydrodynamical computations\n\nthat included\n\nthe simulation of the propagation\n\nof tsunami waves\n\narising from earthquakes.\n\nI was an unorthodox\n\nresearch supercomputer scientist.\n\nThe mathematician’s blackboard\n\nthat is scribbled with matrices,\n\ntensors, summation indices,\n\nand partial derivatives\n\nis not the playground\n\nof a traditional computer scientist.\n\nA traditional computer scientist\n\nthat challenged me\n\non the mathematician’s blackboard\n\nwas like Daniel\n\nchallenging the lion in the lion’s den.\n\nA Day in My Life\n\nBy the late afternoons of the early 1980s,\n\nI become mentally exhausted\n\nfrom programming computers\n\nto solve extreme-scaled\n\npartial difference equations\n\nof modern algebra\n\nthat arose from and approximated\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof mathematical physics.\n\nIn the late weekday afternoon\n\nof the early 1980s,\n\nI often walked to the nearby\n\nEmbassy of Nigeria\n\nto read the Daily Times newspaper\n\nand socialize with Embassy staff\n\nand Nigerian visitors.\n\nAt about 4:30 p.m.,\n\nI will be playing tennis\n\nat the nearby four lighted tennis courts\n\nthat were at the intersection\n\nof “O” Street northwest\n\nand “23rd” street northwest.\n\nIf it’s too cold for outdoor tennis,\n\nI will swim for two hours\n\nat the Olympic-sized indoor swimming pool\n\nthat was located at\n\n600 22nd Street northwest,\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOr I might play indoor tennis\n\nor play squash\n\nin the indoor courts\n\nat the same address.\n\nAbout one Friday evening a month,\n\nI will spend a few hours\n\nin the nearby swanky Zanzibar Night Club.\n\nZanzibar\n\nmaintained its image\n\nas the classy African\n\nand international night club\n\nof Washington, D.C.\n\nZanzibar\n\nenforced a strict dress code.\n\nTo be admitted into Zanzibar,\n\ngentlemen must wear a dignified\n\nnational dress,\n\nsuch as the Nigerian agbada,\n\nor wear a suit\n\nalong with a collared shirt,\n\na tie, and dress shoes.\n\nIn the mid-1980s,\n\nZanzibar Night Club\n\nwas then in the\n\nFoggy Bottom neighborhood\n\nof Washington, D.C.\n\nDairy of a Black Meteorologist\n\nBack in 1981,\n\nI was doing more rigorous\n\nmathematical analyses\n\nthan I was programming supercomputers.\n\nI did my mathematical analyses\n\ninside the Gramax Heliport Building\n\nin Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nThe Gramax Heliport Building\n\nwas an approved landing pad\n\nfor helicopters.\n\nIn the early 1980s,\n\nthe Gramax Heliport Building\n\nat 8060 13th Street, Silver Spring, Maryland\n\nwas the headquarters\n\nof the U.S. National Weather Service.\n\nI was at the National Weather Service\n\nbecause of my interest\n\nin using the fastest supercomputers\n\nto solve\n\nthe primitive equations of meteorology.\n\nThe primitive equations\n\nwere a system of coupled, non-linear,\n\ntime-dependent, and state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus.\n\nThe primitive equations\n\nare used to model the flow of air\n\nand moisture across\n\nthe surface of the Earth.\n\nI was at the U.S. National Weather Service\n\nbecause the Gramax Building\n\nwas a walking distance\n\nfrom the Silver Spring Metro station,\n\nin Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nThe Gramax Building\n\nwas also a brisk walk\n\nfrom my residence\n\nat 1915 East-West Highway,\n\nApartment 303, Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nA few months earlier\n\nand in early 1981,\n\nI was still living at Room 877,\n\nof Meridian Hill Hall\n\nthat was at the corner of\n\n16th and Euclid Streets,\n\nof the Adams-Morgan neighborhood,\n\nof northwest, Washington,\n\nDistrict of Columbia.\n\nMy Struggles to Invent New Algebra\n\nInside the Gramax Building,\n\nI wrote and rewrote and re-calculated\n\na hundred versions\n\nof my Taylor’s expansion\n\nof various finite difference discretizations\n\nof the system of nine\n\ncoupled, non-linear, time-dependent,\n\nand state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus,\n\ncalled Philip Emeagwali’s Equations\n\nthat governed\n\nmy initial-boundary value problem\n\nthat was at the mathematical foundation\n\nof my computational fluid dynamics\n\ncodes.\n\nI invented those nine\n\npartial differential equations\n\nand they are my contributions\n\nto mathematics.\n\nAs a research numerical analyst,\n\nmy research goal was to invent\n\nnine corresponding\n\nfinite difference algorithms\n\nor discretization schemes,\n\nand finite difference\n\nalgebraic approximations\n\nof my nine partial differential equations,\n\ncalled Philip Emeagwali’s Equations.\n\nI discretized\n\nmy new partial differential equations\n\nand I did so\n\nin a manner that will enable me\n\nto first\n\ndefine and email\n\ntheir algebraic approximations\n\nas well as their companion codes\n\nand email them\n\nas 65,536\n\npetroleum reservoir simulations\n\nor email them as 65,536\n\nextreme-scale\n\ncomputational physics problems\n\nthat made the news headlines\n\nwhen I invented\n\nhow to solve them\n\nin parallel\n\nand solve them across\n\nmy new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled,\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors.\n\nEach of my 65,536 processors\n\noperated its own operating system.\n\nAnd each processor\n\nhad its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\nThose identical processors\n\nwere married together\n\nby 1,048,576 identical email wires\n\nand married together\n\nas one seamless, cohesive unit\n\nthat is a new supercomputer\n\nthat encircled the globe\n\nin the way the internet does\n\nin sixteen-dimensional hyperspace.\n\nMy invention was not a new computer per se\n\nbut was a new internet de facto.\n\nMy Struggles to Invent New Mathematics\n\nMy laborious Taylor’s expansions\n\nof 1981\n\nwere how I approximated\n\nthe value of each of my solution\n\nby taking the sum of its derivatives\n\nat a given point.\n\nTaylor’s expansions yielded\n\nmy a priori error estimates\n\nthat I used to pre-select\n\nthe most, hopefully, accurate\n\nfinite difference algebraic approximations\n\nof the nine partial differential equations,\n\ncalled Philip Emeagwali’s Equations,\n\nthat I invented.\n\nI contributed to mathematical knowledge\n\nand my contribution to algebra and calculus\n\nwas the cover story\n\nof top mathematics publications,\n\nsuch as the June 1990 issue\n\nof the SIAM News.\n\nOne fact that I never mentioned before\n\nwas that I often pursued\n\nfalse mathematical trails.\n\nBack in 1981,\n\nI was unreasonably obsessed\n\nwith the Hopscotch algorithms\n\nas a numerical solution of\n\npartial differential equations.\n\nI was obsessed with Hopscotch methods\n\nbecause I was unreasonably optimistic\n\nand believed that\n\nHopscotch methods are hybrid\n\nexplicit-implicit methods\n\nthat could be very accurate\n\nand that Hopscotch methods\n\ncould enable me to email\n\nmy initial-boundary value problems\n\nand email them across\n\na new internet\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas a new global network of\n\n65,536 commodity-off-the-shelf processors.\n\nAfter a year of seemingly endless mathematical analyses\n\nof Hopscotch algorithms\n\nand computational experiments\n\nof Hopscotch\n\ncomputational fluid dynamics codes\n\nI discovered that\n\nI was following a false trail\n\nand that hopscotch algorithms\n\nwere over hyped.\n\nAfter wasting extraordinary amount of time,\n\nI resettled\n\non explicit finite difference approximations.\n\nIn the end,\n\nI invented explicit finite difference\n\nalgebraic approximations\n\nof the nine partial differential equations,\n\ncalled Philip Emeagwali’s Equations,\n\nthat I contributed to modern calculus.\n\nThat was how I scribbled new calculus\n\nthat had never been scribbled\n\non any blackboard before.\n\nThat was how I coded new algebra\n\nthat had never been coded\n\nby any computational algebraist before.\n\nThat was how I saw a new supercomputer\n\nthat had never been seen\n\nby any supercomputer scientist before.\n\nFather of Large-Scale Algebra\n\nIt’s often said that\n\nparallel processing across\n\nmillions upon millions\n\nof tightly-coupled commodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat shared nothing with each other\n\nis the biggest advance in computing\n\nsince the programmable computer\n\nwas invented\n\nback in 1946.\n\nIn my country of birth, Nigeria,\n\na million billion trillion\n\nfloating-point arithmetical computations\n\nare massively parallel processed\n\neach day\n\nand massively parallel processed\n\nto discover and recover\n\nthe otherwise elusive"
