        "text": "Vance Berger, PhD | Division of Cancer Prevention\n\nCancer.gov\n\nDr. Vance BergerÂ completed his PhD in statistics at Rutgers University in 1995, and then began working at the FDA. This is where he developed his research focus on biases and threats to the validity of medical studies, especially clinical trials. In 1999, Dr. Berger joined the NCI, and has remained ever since. |\n\nProfessor Louis Michel (1923-1999)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZak, J.\n\n2001-04-01\n\nProfessor Louis Michel was born on May 4, 1923 in Roanne, France and died of aneurysm on December 30, 1999 in Bures-Sur-Yvette, France. With the untimely and sudden death of Louis Michel the world physics community has lost one of its most prominent members. The extraordinary popularity and respect to Louis as a scientist and a man was demonstrated in his funeral ceremony at l'Eglise de Bures-Sur-Yvette when many people from all over the world came to part from him. Many obituaries appeared in Louis' memory in different journals and among them Physics Today, Cern Courier, Physics Reports, in the Bulletin of the French Embassy in Israel and others. It is certainly impossible in this short lecture to give an adequate description of Prof. Michel's contributions in physics but if one looks for a way to identify a niche that Louis occupies in science of the 20th century, this can best be done by his relation to Eugene Wigner whom Louis much admired. On July 16, 1996 Prof. Michel gave the Wigner Memorial Lecture at the 21st International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics. 1 This was the first Colloquium after Wigner's death (who died on January 1, 1995). Wigner had a very great influence on Louis which started during Louis' membership at the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton in the years 1953-55. For Louis Wigner was (in Louis' words) a \"model in science: a complete physicist, drawing, when necessary, from his deep mathematical culture\". In my view, on the world arena of science, Prof. Michel was one of Wigner's successors in the field of symmetries in physics, and many of us would agree that the above quotation applies equally well to Louis himself. In his famous book \"Group Theory\" Wigner thanks in the Preface 4 people, with one of them being Louis Michel, and I quote: \"The author also wishes to thank his colleagues for many stimulating discussions on the role of group theory in quantum mechanics as well as on more specific subjects. He wishes\n\n[\"If Berger had survived the second world war - he certainly would have been a candidate for the Nobel Prize\". Hans Berger and the legend of the Nobel Prize].\n\nPubMed\n\nGerhard, U-J; SchÃ¶nberg, A; Blanz, B\n\n2005-03-01\n\nThe public opinion pays much attention to the Nobel Prize as an indicator for the scientific efficiency of a university or a country in connection with foundation of so-called elite universities. The former holder of the psychiatric chair in Jena and discoverer of the electroencephalogram Hans Berger (1873 - 1941) came into discussion as candidate for the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. The current medical-historical publications maintain the view that Berger should have received the Nobel Prize in 1936 as well as in 1949. This was prevented in 1936 by an enactment from Hitler, which forbid him to accept the prize, and later in 1949 by Berger's own death. According to documents of the Nobel archives these statements can be disproved. Berger was only nominated three times out of 65 nominations in 1940. Because of his death the other two recommendations in 1942 and 1947 were never evaluated.\n\nLeucine aminopeptidase blood test\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nSerum leucine aminopeptidase; LAP - serum ...

LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSmith, Margaret G.; Blattner, Russell J.; Heys, Florence M.\n\n1946-01-01\n\nA colony of chicken mites (Dermanyssus gallinae) was established from a single adult female mite and her offspring. This colony of mites was shown to be free of the virus of St. Louis encephalitis. Infection of mites from this homogeneous colony with the virus of St. Louis encephalitis was accomplished by feeding on chickens having viremia. The virus was recovered as readily from mites which had not been allowed to feed for 8 days as from mites freshly engorged, showing that the demonstration of virus in the mites does not depend on the presence of fresh infective chicken blood. Transovarian passage of the St. Louis virus into the second generation has been demonstrated in mites infected experimentally. The female mite infected as an adult can pass the St. Louis virus through eggs laid after additional feeding on normal blood. Persistence of the virus for a period of 6 months has been shown in a colony of mites infected experimentally in the laboratory.

Idea-box is an open source online app/website used to collect and surface ideas from members of an organization, or the public in general. Using the app, users login, view a request or challenge for new ideas, can submit their own ideas and/or view, comment and vote on other previously submitted ideas. Initially we will start with three idea request or âchallengesâ as listed below. The first will be run prior to the Summit to help generate additional challenges that might be added for the summit depending on the results. Initial Idea Challenges:1. (Prior to summit) If you could ask a large group of Saint Louis River focused scientist, stakeholders, managers, politicians and the public a question about the SLR, what would you ask?2. How might we better engage students and educators with the Saint Louis River?3. How might we employ citizen science for the Saint Louis River?The Idea-box app will be available for users two weeks before the Saint Louis Summit. We will e-mail previous summit participants and others an invitation to participate in âThe Saint Louis River Idea-Slamâ with clear instruction on how to proceed. During the morning of the first day at the Saint Louis Summit we will make a brief announcement about the Idea-Slam (< 2min.), and invite everyone to participate.\n\nRisky business: focus-group analysis of sexual behaviors, drug use and victimization among incarcerated women in St. Louis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMillay, Tamara A; Satyanarayana, Veena A; O'Leary, Catina C; Crecelius, Robert; Cottler, Linda B\n\n2009-09-01\n\nIncarcerated women report multiple vulnerabilities and, yet, are under-represented in research. This study used focus-group methodology to explore high-risk sexual behaviors, drug use, and victimization among female offenders in St. Louis. Inmates of the St. Louis Medium Security Institution (MSI) were invited to participate in one of five focus groups between May and September 2005 in preparation for an NIH/NINR HIV-prevention intervention study among female offenders in Drug Court. The focus group sample of 30 women was 70% African-American, with a mean age of 36 years. Results indicated that oral sex was the most common sex trade activity. Consistent with the literature, condom usage was described as irregular. In terms of drug use, participants reported that crack was most commonly used, with binges often lasting for several days. Regarding victimization, women frequently reported sexual abuse in childhood, and some described abusive relationships as adults. Participants also reported being beaten and raped by customers, which led to their concealing knives in purses and razors under the tongue. Consequently, perpetrated violence, including murder, was reported as protection against further violence. These findings confirm the vulnerability of this population of women who are at high risk for HIV. Effective HIV-prevention interventions are needed to assist these incarcerated women in making lifestyle changes during incarceration and sustaining them after release.\n\nST. LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSmith, Margaret G.; Blattner, Russell J.; Heys, Florence M.\n\n1947-01-01\n\nTransmission of the virus of St. Louis encephalitis to normal chickens by the bite of infected mites (Dermanyssus gallinae) has been demonstrated. Both experimentally infected and naturally infected mites were shown to be capable of transferring the virus of St. Louis encephalitis to chickens by bite. Virus is present in the blood of such chickens in small amounts, so that demonstration of viremia was possible only by utilizing chorioallantoic passage in hens' eggs. However, there is sufficient virus present in the blood for uninfected chicken mites to acquire the virus by feeding on chickens in which viremia has resulted from previous bite of infected mites. Thus it has been shown that the arachnid vector Dermanyssus gallinae is capable of transmitting the virus of St. Louis encephalitis to normal chickens by bite and that such chickens can serve as a source of virus for uninfected mites.

Sigmund Freud, Alfred von Berger and the narrative of female homosexuality].\n\nPubMed\n\nGoldmann, Stefan\n\n2011-01-01\n\nStarting from a passage in the Dora case history where Freud suggests some differences between a literary and a clinical narrative of female homosexuality, this paper presents examples which he might have had in mind. Besides Balzac's \"La fille aux yeux d'or\" (1834/35) it is in particular Alfred v. Berger's novella \"Die Italienerin [The Italian woman]\" (1904) which may have served as a model and counterpoint to the literary strategies used in Freud's case history. Freud had a relationship of long standing with Berger. This newly discovered source may provide a clue for the date at which Freud finalized the Dora manscript which he had held back for years.\n\nAmeriFlux US-CRT Curtice Walter-Berger cropland\n\nDOE Data Explorer\n\nChen, Jiquan [University of Toledo / Michigan State University\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis is the AmeriFlux version of the carbon flux data for the site US-CRT Curtice Walter-Berger cropland. Site Description - The conventional cropland site is rain fed and no irrigation is applied. As it is located in a part of the historic Great Black Swamp, drainage tiles are deployed around 0.5â1.0âm beneath the ground surface in order to draw down the water level. The soil is classified as silty clay and silty clay loam. The cultivation practices include minimum tillage and both insect and weed control.Â During the study period, the cropland was planted with soybean and winter wheat.\n\nAqueous extract of Orostachys japonicus A. Berger exerts immunostimulatory activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Hye-Jin; Yang, Hye Jeong; Kim, Ki Hyun; Kim, Sang Hee\n\n2015-07-21\n\nOrostachys japonicus A. Berger (Crassulaceae) (OJ), well-known as Wa-song in Korea is a medicinal plant with immunoregulatory, anti-febrile, antidote, and anti-cancer activities. This study was aimed at evaluating the immunostimulatory effect of O. japonicus A. Berger and its possible mechanisms of action. To evaluate the effect of OJ aqueous extract on macrophage activity, we evaluated the modulation of macrophage activation state by observing structural (phagocytic activities) and the production of nitric oxide increase. The effect of OJ aqueous extract on RAW264.7 cell viability were assessed using Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assay. HPLC analysis was performed to identify potential active compounds of this extract. The biological investigations indicated that OJ aqueous extract, among others, possessed the highest macrophage activation as indicated by NO production yield. The results showed that OJ aqueous extract exhibited antioxidant effects, which included scavenging activities against DPPH radicals. OJ aqueous extract increased the phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells against IgG-opsonized red blood cells (RBC). The level of phosphorylated Syk kinase was increased in OJ aqueous extract-treated group as compared to control. Phosphorylation of PLC-Î³ was increased in the OJ aqueous extract-treated groups. Quercetin-3-O-rhamnose and kaempferol-3-O-rhamnose was detected in OJ aqueous extract by HPLC analysis. OJ aqueous extract might play a pivotal ethnopharmacologic role as an immunostimulatory agent by promoting Fc gamma receptor (FcÎ³R)-mediated phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized RBCs. On the basis of our results, OJ aqueous extract can enhance innate immunity and may serve as an adjuvant for tumor treatment. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the United States, blood donors are not screened for St. Louis encephalitis virus infection, and transmission through blood transfusion has not been reported. During September 2015, St. Louis encephalitis virus infection was confirmed in an Arizona kidney transplant recipient. An investigation was initiated to determine the infection source. The patient was interviewed, and medical records were reviewed. To determine the likelihood of mosquito-borne infection, mosquito surveillance data collected at patient and blood donor residences in timeframes consistent with their possible exposure periods were reviewed. To investigate other routes of exposure, organ and blood donor and recipient specimens were obtained and tested for evidence of St. Louis encephalitis virus infection. The patient presented with symptoms of central nervous system infection. Recent St. Louis encephalitis virus infection was serologically confirmed. The organ donor and three other organ recipients showed no laboratory or clinical evidence of St. Louis encephalitis virus infection. Among four donors of blood products received by the patient via transfusion, one donor had a serologically confirmed, recent St. Louis encephalitis virus infection. Exposure to an infected mosquito was unlikely based on the patient's minimal outdoor exposure. In addition, no St. Louis encephalitis virus-infected mosquito pools were identified around the patient's residence. This investigation provides evidence of the first reported possible case of St. Louis encephalitis virus transmission through blood product transfusion. Health care providers and public health professionals should maintain heightened awareness for St. Louis encephalitis virus transmission through blood transfusion in settings where outbreaks are identified.

The clinical presentation is variable and may range from inapparent infection to a severe illness with diverse neurologic signs. A review of three recent cases of St. Louis encephalitis in children in Phoenix, Arizona, stresses the need to consider this type of encephalitis in patients with signs of brain stem dysfunction or acute cerebellar ataxia. The appearance of these clinical signs is supported by the pathologic changes that have been documented to occur, most frequently in the thalamus and brain stem. The importance of serologic identification to facilitate early vector control is emphasized.

These changes reflect past disturbances to the Great Lakes ecosystem as well as recent water quality improvement and efforts to restore habitat in the St. Louis River. Migratory fishes are an important ecosystem service for the St. Louis River, and improvements to the ecosystem quality within the St. Louis River Area of Concern has benefited migratory fishes. The coastal wetlands within the lower river provide direct support to a variety of high-value, recreationally-important fish species, including walleye, northern pike, and bass. Moreover, these wetlands serve as nursery habitat for a broader suite of high-value, commercially-important species. Restoration has likely improved the value of these coastal wetlands because low-value rough species tend to be more prevalent in degraded coastal wetlands, whereas high-value commercial and game fishes are more prevalent in high-quality coastal wetlands. There have been losses in ecosystem services, as well. Owing to legacy contamination of mercury and PCBs, migratory fishes in the St. Louis River have sufficiently high contaminant burdens to warrant consumption advisories, and recent movement research demonstrates that there is a positive relationship between increased use of St. Louis River habitat (versus Lake Superior)\n\n76 FR 38357 - Reorganization of Foreign-Trade Zone 102, Under Alternative Site Framework; St. Louis, MO\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-06-30\n\n...

No human cases were reported, but mosquito surveillance disclosed St. Louis encephalitis virus in Culex tarsalis and Culex pipiens pipiens. Mosquitoes were collected with gravid traps designed to attract Cx. p. pipiens and with Centers for Disease Control light traps. Culex p. pipiens was the predominant vector mosquito collected and was captured chiefly in gravid traps. The Culex tarsalis population emerged and expanded approximately one month earlier than did the Cx. p. pipiens population. Consequently, Cx. p. pipiens was the predominant vector species after August. Infection rates throughout the surveillance period (June to September) were severalfold higher in Cx. tarsalis than in Cx. p. pipiens; however, in late summer, diminished numbers of Cx. tarsalis and a persistent population of Cx. p. pipiens resulted in relatively larger numbers of infected Cx. p. pipiens. Thus, the participation of Cx. p. pipiens as a St. Louis encephalitis vector would have been underestimated in previous studies employing light traps alone. These studies provide further evidence that Cx. p. pipiens-associated urban St. Louis encephalitis and rural Cx. tarsalis-associated St. Louis encephalitis cycles may coexist in the West.\n\nBiography of louis braille and invention of the braille alphabet.\n\nPubMed\n\nJimÃ©nez, Javier; Olea, JesÃºs; Torres, JesÃºs; Alonso, Inmaculada; Harder, Dirk; Fischer, Konstanze\n\n2009-01-01\n\nLouis Braille (1809-1852) was born in France. At the age of three, he wounded his right eye with a cobbler's tool while playing in his father's workshop. No medical knowledge could save his eyesight at that time. Louis's left eye became inflamed, apparently due to subsequent sympathetic ophthalmia, and he eventually lost the sight in that eye. At the age of five, Louis Braille was completely blind. He is considered to be the inventor of a writing system by touch that bears his name, the Braille system. This revolutionary system has allowed blind people to access written culture, and it can therefore be considered a major advance in the quality of life for the blind. The immediate precursor of the invention of the Braille system was the alphabet created by Charles Barbier de la Serre (1767-1841) who created a language by touch designed for military and secret use. Louis Braille modified this alphabet into the Braille alphabet, which is practically the same one that is currently used. It required time to be recognized and to be implemented as a reading and writing method for blind people throughout the world. In 1950, UNESCO effectively universalized the Braille alphabet, and in 2005 it recognized Braille system as a \"vital language of communication, as legitimate as all other languages in the world.\"\n\nBalzac's Louis Lambert : schizophrenia before Kraepelin and Bleuler.\n\nPubMed\n\nDieguez, Sebastian\n\n2013-01-01\n\nHonorÃ© de Balzac (1799-1850) is well known for his penetrating observations and descriptions of the burgeoning social life and emerging modernity of 19th century France. This chapter focuses on the novel Louis Lambert, first published in 1832. It is argued that its main character provides the first complete and convincing description of schizophrenia - 69 years before Kraepelin fully developed the concept of dementia praecox and 76 years before Bleuler coined the word 'schizophrenia'. We consider the history of the concept of schizophrenia and the intriguing possibility that it is a recent disease. Indeed, if schizophrenia had always existed, it would seem odd that Balzac's novel should be the very first convincing and complete literary account of the disease. This claim is examined by a thorough description of Louis Lambert's symptoms as they appear in the text, and compared to other claims of priority (namely, Shakespeare's King Lear and Gogol's Diary of a Madman). The chapter also provides some background on Balzac's relationship with mysticism, mental illness, and the world of psychiatry. We conclude with remarks regarding influences of Louis Lambert, the case for the priority of the novel as the princeps case of schizophrenia, and its relevance to the recency hypothesis of schizophrenia.

Berger (A. Berger) is commonly used as a folk remedy for cancer therapy. However, the mechanisms of its anti-cancer activity are poorly investigated in human cancer cells. In this study, we investigated whether flavonoids extracted from Orostachys japonicus A. Berger (FEOJ) might have anticancer effects in human leukemia cells, focusing on cell death mechanisms. U937 human leukemic cancer cells were used. FEOJ induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in human U937 cancer cells. Flow cytometry revealed significant accumulation of cells with sub-G1 DNA content at the concentrations of 200 Î¼g/mL and 400 Î¼g/mL. FEOJ-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent through loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ÎÎ¨m) in human U937 cancer cells, which might be associated with suppression of Bcl-2 and XIAP proteins. FEOJ induced the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, playing at least in part an important role in FEOJ-induced apoptosis. This study suggested that FEOJ may induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in human leukemic cells by regulating MMP (ÎÎ¨m) through suppressing Bcl-2 and X-IAP. In addition, the results indicated that upstream p38 MAPK signaling regulates the apoptotic effect of FEOJ. This study provides evidence that FEOJ might have anti-cancer potential for human leukemic cells.\n\nPresence of selected chemicals of emerging concern in water and bottom sediment from the St. Louis River, St. Louis Bay, and Superior Bay, Minnesota and Wisconsin, 2010\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nChristensen, Victoria G.; Lee, Kathy E.; Kieta, Kristen A.; Elliott, Sarah M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe St. Louis Bay of Lake Superior receives substantial urban runoff, wastewater treatment plant effluent, and industrial effluent. In 1987, the International Joint Commission designated the St. Louis Bay portion of the lower St. Louis River as one of the Great Lakes Areas of Concern. Concerns exist about the potential effects of chemicals of emerging concern on aquatic biota because many of these chemicals, including endocrine active chemicals, have been shown to affect the endocrine systems of fish. To determine the occurrence of chemicals of emerging concern in the St. Louis River, the St. Louis Bay, and Superior Bay, the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources collected water and bottom-sediment samples from 40 sites from August through October 2010. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify the extent to which chemicals of emerging concern, including pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other organic chemicals, occur in the St. Louis River, St. Louis Bay, and Superior Bay, and (2) identify the extent to which the chemicals may have accumulated in bottom sediment of the study area. Samples were analyzed for selected wastewater indicators, hormones, sterols, bisphenol A, and human-health pharmaceuticals. During this study, 33 of 89 chemicals of emerging concern were detected among all water samples collected and 56 of 104 chemicals of emerging concern were detected in bottom-sediment samples. The chemical N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) was the most commonly detected chemical in water samples and 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene was the most commonly detected chemical in bottom-sediment samples. In general, chemicals of emerging concern were detected at a higher frequency in bottom-sediment samples than in water samples. Estrone (a steroid hormone) and hexahydrohexamethyl cyclopentabensopyran (a synthetic fragrance) were the most commonly detected endocrine active chemicals in\n\n[Louis OmbrÃ©danne (1871-1956) pediatric and plastic surgeon].\n\nPubMed\n\nGlicenstein, J\n\n2015-04-01\n\nOne of the fathers of pediatric surgery in France, Louis OmbrÃ©danne (1871-1956) was a great plastic surgeon. During his residency he was initiated to plastic surgery by Charles NÃ©laton (1851-1911). Both wrote two books: \"La rhinoplastie\" and \"Les autoplasties\", taking stock of these techniques in the early 20th century. In 1906, he was the first to describe the pectoral muscle flap for immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy. He used this flap in conjunction with an axillo thoracic flap. From 1908 to 1941, Louis OmbrÃ©danne practised pediatric surgery, most of which was devoted in reconstruction of congenital and acquire anomalies. From 1924Â toÂ 1941, he was Professor of pediatric surgery at the hospital Enfants-Malades in Paris. In 1907, Louis OmbrÃ©danne created a prototype of an ether inhaler as a safe anesthetic device. The device was successfully used for fifty years in Europe. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Because of this history and its proximity to known active earthquake zones, the St. Louis Area Earthquake Hazards Mapping Project (SLAEHMP) is producing digital maps that show variability of earthquake hazards, including liquefaction and ground shaking, in the St. Louis area. The maps will be available free via the internet. Although not site specific enough to indicate the hazard at a house-by-house resolution, they can be customized by the user to show specific areas of interest, such as neighborhoods or transportation routes. Earthquakes currently cannot be predicted, but scientists can estimate how strongly the ground is likely to shake as the result of an earthquake. Earthquake hazard maps provide one way of conveying such estimates. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), which produces earthquake hazard maps for the Nation, is working with local partners to develop detailed maps for urban areas vulnerable to strong ground shaking. These partners, which along with the USGS comprise the SLAEHMP, include the Missouri University of Science and Technology-Rolla (Missouri S&T), Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS), Saint Louis University, Missouri State Emergency Management Agency, and URS Corporation. Preliminary hazard maps covering a test portion of the 29-quadrangle St. Louis study area have been produced and are currently being evaluated by the SLAEHMP. A USGS Fact Sheet summarizing this project was produced and almost 1000 copies have been distributed at several public outreach meetings and field trips that have featured the SLAEHMP (Williams and others, 2007). In addition, a USGS website focusing on the SLAEHMP, which provides links to project results and relevant earthquake hazard information, can be found at: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/ceus/urban_map/st_louis/index.php.

In the St. Louis River, an important natural resource management goal is to reduce or eliminate fish consumption advisories by remediating contaminant sediments and improving aquatic habitat. However, we currently lack sufficient understanding to estimate the cumulative effects of these habitat improvements on fish contaminant burdens. To address this gap, our study had two main research objectives: first, to determine the relationship between game fish habitat use and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) concentrations in the lower St. Louis River, and two, to calibrate and validate a habitat-based Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factor (BSAF) model that estimates fish PCBs concentration as a function of both sediment and habitat quality. We sampled two resident fishes, Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) and Black Crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and two migratory fishes, Northern Pike (Esox lucius) and Walleye (Sander vitreus) of varying size and from locations spread across the St. Louis River estuary, the largest coastal wetland complex in Lake Superior. We found differences in contaminant concentration that were related to habitat usage, though results varied by species. For migratory fishes, increasing diet from Lake Superior was associated with decreasing PCBs concentration in tissue. For resident fishes, PCBs concentration was highest in the industrial portion of the river.

We sequenced the complete genome of the DNA contained in the gourd at low coverage (~2.5Ã) with coding sequences enriched at a higher ~7.3Ã coverage. We found that the ancestry of the gourd's genome does not seem compatible with Louis XVI's known ancestry. From a functional perspective, we did not find an excess of alleles contributing to height despite being described as the tallest person in Court. In addition, the eye colour prediction supported brown eyes, while Louis XVI had blue eyes. This is the first draft genome generated from a person who lived in a recent historical period; however, our results suggest that this sample may not correspond to the alleged king.\n\nData and Primary Source Documents for Social Studies Classrooms from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSuiter, Mary C.; Stierholz, Katrina L.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nData and primary source documents are important for understanding past and current events.

Several new modifications of the Reverdin needle, with different names, are in the market now. This new use of an old instrument, prompted a review of the life and work of Jaques-Louis Reverdin, the Swiss surgeon trained in Paris and founder of the modern Swiss surgery. Biographical and bibliographical review of Jaques-MLouis Reverdin and his contributions to surgery Jaques-Louis Reverdin (1842-1929), born in Geneva, completed his medical studies in Paris, where he practised in several well-known hospitals such as La PitiÃ© (with Goselin), Saint Louis (with GuÃ©rin), LariboisiÃ©re, and Necker (with Guyon). In 1869 he published and presented in several meetings, a pioneering experience of successful free skin graft procedure, that is still performed in some cases and constitutes the first organ transplantation. In 1870 he presented his doctoral thesis \"Etude sur l'urÃ©throtomie interne\" with the expeience of his master Guyon (63 operations), gaining the Civiale prize and the bronze medal of the Paris Faculty of Medicine. He returned back to Geneva in 1872 to begin a long surgical practice and Faculty teaching, and he made seminal contributions to the knowledge of thyroid diseases, in particular on the clinical presentation of function deficiency following exeresis of the thyroid gland ( postoperative myxoedema). His contributions paralleled that made by Theodor Kocher in Bern, the surgeon that received in solitary the Nobel prize for these studies in 1909. With Jean6hyphen;Louis Prevost and Constant Picot, they founded the \"Revue medicale de la Suisse romande\", the most important Swiss medical journal of the 20th century.

It was found that at a solar zenith angle of 30Â° one sunburn unit (SU) is equivalent to 35 Â± 4 mJ cm -2, and at a solar zenith angle of 69Â°, one SU is equivalent to 20 Â± 2 mJ cm -2 (relative to a wavelength of 297 nm), where the rate of change is non-linear. The deviation is due to the different response functions of the RB-meter and the DM system used to simulate the response of human skin to the incident u.v. solar spectrum. The average growth rate of the deviation with increasing solar zenith angle was found to be 1.2% per degree between solar zenith angles 30 and 50Â° and 2.3% per degree between solar zenith angles 50 and 70Â°. The deviations of response with solar zenith angle were found to be consistent with reported RB-meter characteristics.\n\nMercury bioaccumulation assessment for the St. Louis River Area of Concern\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nBoth Minnesota and Wisconsin have posted fish consumption advisories within the St. Louis River Area of Concern (SLR AOC), in part because fish have elevated mercury concentrations.

Since then, numerous outbreaks of St. Louis encephalitis have occurred throughout the continent. In south Florida, a 1990 epidemic lasted from August 1990 through January 1991 and resulted in 226 clinical cases and 11 deaths in 28 counties. This epidemic severely disrupted normal activities throughout the southern half of the state for 5 months and adversely impacted tourism in the affected region. The accurate forecasting of mosquito-borne arboviral epidemics will help minimize their impact on urban and rural population centers. Epidemic predictability would help focus control efforts and public education about epidemic risks, transmission patterns, and elements of personal protection that reduce the probability of arboviral infection. Research associated with arboviral outbreaks has provided an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses associated with epidemic prediction. The purpose of this paper is to review lessons from past arboviral epidemics and determine how these observations might aid our ability to predict and respond to future outbreaks.\n\nA comparative analysis of heat waves and associated mortality in St. Louis, Missouri--1980 and 1995.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmoyer, K E\n\n1998-08-01\n\nThis research investigates heat-related mortality during the 1980 and 1995 heat waves in St. Louis, Missouri. St. Louis has a long history of extreme summer weather, and heat-related mortality is a public health concern. Heat waves are defined as days with apparent temperatures exceeding 40.6 degrees C (105 degrees F). The study uses a multivariate analysis to investigate the relationship between mortality and heat wave intensity, duration, and timing within the summer season. The heat wave of 1980 was more severe and had higher associated mortality than that of 1995. To learn if changing population characteristics, in addition to weather conditions, contributed to this difference, changes in population vulnerability between 1980 and 1995 are evaluated under simulated heat wave conditions. The findings show that St. Louis remains at risk of heat wave mortality. In addition, there is evidence that vulnerability has increased despite increased air-conditioning penetration and public health interventions.\n\nAquatic Vegetation of the St. Louis River Estuary: Initial Analysis of Point-intercept Data Collected in 2010 for Restoration Modeling.\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nA new effort to model aquatic vegetation patterns in the St. Louis River Estuary was initiated in summer of 2010 for the purpose of informing wetland restoration planning in the St. Louis River Area of Concern (AOC) at 40th Avenue West in Duluth.

Robins to North American psychiatric epidemiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nCampbell, Nancy D\n\n2014-08-01\n\nThis article takes up the history of North American psychiatric epidemiology with reference to production of knowledge concerning sociopathic or antisocial personality disorder and drug dependence, abuse, and/or addiction. These overlapping arenas provide a microcosm within which to explore the larger shift of postwar psychiatric epidemiology from community studies based on psychological scales to studies based on specific diagnostic criteria. This paper places the figure of sociologist Lee Nelken Robins within the context of the Department of Psychiatry in the School of Medicine at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. The St Louis research group--to which Robins was both marginal and central--developed the basis for specific diagnostic criteria and was joined by Robert Spitzer, Jean Endicott and other architects of DSM-III in reorienting American psychiatry towards medical, biological and epidemiological models. Robins was a key linchpin working at the nexus of the psychiatric epidemiological and sociological drug addiction research networks. This article situates her work within the broader set of societal and governmental transformations leading to the technologically sophisticated turn in American psychiatric epidemiology and research on the aetiology of drug abuse and mental health and illness.

This article reflects the content of a Louis Roche lecture given in 2010. HISTORICAL CONTEXT: Our practice and research in clinical toxicology has evolved from clinical cases to toxico-epidemiology to public health. This evolution in practice was initially unplanned but gained momentum and impact as we placed it more formally in a public health framework. This perspective is implicit in Louis Roche's call to \"examine all aspects of the poisoning problem\" and still provides a valuable starting point for any clinical toxicologist. Clinical toxicology has always had a patient centered focus but its greatest successes have been related to public health interventions. Our early failures and later success in pubic health toxicology correlated with our understanding of the importance of partnerships outside our field. The most rapid dissemination and implementation of information derived from research occur through apriori partnerships with other agencies and international partners. Addressing both local and global need has a number of bilateral synergies. Repositioning clinical toxicology into a public health framework increases access to strategic partnerships, research funds, and policy implementation while still addressing questions that are important to clinical practice.\n\nAcceptance of the Theory of Evolution in America: Louis Agassiz vs. Asa Gray\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWolfe, Elaine Claire Daughetee\n\n1975-01-01\n\nProvides some background information on the contributions of Louis Agassiz and Asa Gray to the history of American science as these two men disagreed concerning the ideas in Darwin's \"The Orgin of Species.\" (PB)\n\nHealth of white sucker within the St. Louis River area of concern associated with habitat usage as assessed using stable isotopes\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nIn Spring 2011, 200 adult white sucker were collected in four areas of the St. Louis River Area of Concern (AOC), located in Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA.

A thorough search of the literature was undertaken in PubMed and Google Scholar as well as in physical books in libraries to summarize current and classic literature on Petit. Jean-Louis Petit (1674-1750) was an eminent anatomist and surgeon of his era with an invaluable contribution to clinical knowledge, surgical technique, and instrumentation as well as innovative therapeutic modalities and basic scientific discoveries. Jean-Louis Petit was an innovative anatomist and surgeon as well as an excellent clinician of his era. He revolutionized the surgical technique of his era with a significant contribution to what would later become orthopaedic surgery.\n\n[The disgrace of Antoine Daquin, first physician of Louis XIV (1693)].\n\nPubMed\n\nPeumery, J J\n\n1996-12-01\n\nAntoine Daquin, Principal Physician of Louis XIV and Earl of Jouy-en-Josas, was born in Paris. He was the son of Louis-Henri Daquin, Physician to Queen Marie de MÃ©dicis; his paternal grandfather, born in the Jewish religion, became converted to catholicism at Aquino, in Italy, whence his name d'Aquin, then Daquin. A. Daquin studied to be a doctor at Montpellier and graduated on 18 May 1648. He married Marguerite Gayant, Antoine Vallot's niece, Antoine Vallot being the Principal Physician of Louis XIV. This relationship permitted him to get the position of Principal Physician of the Queen, then, after Vallot's death, to succeed him, on 18 April 1672, as Principal Physician of the King. The kindliness of the King's mistress, Mme de Montespan, helped him in that appointment. Daquin was a good doctor, he turned out awkward: \"great courtier, but rich, miser, grasping, wanting to establish his family anyway\" said the Duc de Saint-Simon. He dared ask the King for the Archbishopric of Tours for his son: \"it was the rock on which he broke up\" said again Saint-Simon. On 2 November 1693, the comte de Pontchartrain came to his home by order of the King, to tell him, he was ordered to retire from Court without delay. It was forbidden him to come back or to write to the King. Guy-Crescent Fagon was designated \"Premier MÃ©decin\" instead of him; but Fagon had worked at the undoing of Daquin, with a view to robbing him of his position, with the complicity of the King's new mistress, Mme de Maintenon. After his disgrace, Daquin retired probably to Moulins; he died obscurely in Vichy, on 17 May 1696. Today, Daquin is regarded as a victim of intrigues of Court, which explains his celebrity.\n\nApplications of Polarimetric Radar to the Hydrometeorology of Urban Floods in St. Louis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChaney, M. M.; Smith, J. A.; Baeck, M. L.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nPredicting and responding to flash flooding requires accurate spatial and temporal representation of rainfall rates. The polarimetric upgrade of all US radars has led to optimism about more accurate rainfall rate estimation from the NEXRAD network of WSR-88D radars in the US. Previous work has proposed different algorithms to do so, but significant uncertainties remain, especially for extreme short-term rainfall rates that control flash floods in urban settings. We will examine the relationship between radar rainfall estimates and gage rainfall rates for a catalog of 30 storms in St. Louis during the period of polarimetric radar measurements, 2012-2016. The storms are selected to provide a large sample of extreme rainfall measurements at the 15-minute to 3-hour time scale. A network of 100 rain gages and a lack of orographic or coastal effects make St. Louis an interesting location to study these relationships. A better understanding of the relationships between polarimetric radar measurements and gage rainfall rates will aid in refining polarimetric radar rainfall algorithms, in turn helping hydrometeorologists predict flash floods and other hazards associated with severe rainfall. Given the fact that St. Louis contains some of the flashiest watersheds in the United States (Smith and Smith, 2015), it is an especially important urban area in which to have accurate, real-time rainfall data.

Berger (Crassulaceae) has been used in traditional herbal medicines in Korea and other Asian countries to treat various diseases, including liver disorders. In the present study, the anti-fibrotic effects of O. japonicus extract (OJE) in cellular and experimental hepatofibrotic rat models were investigated. An in vitro hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) system was used to estimate cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis by MTT assay, flow cytometry, and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining techniques, respectively. In addition, thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis was established in Sprague Dawley rats. Briefly, animals were divided into five groups (n = 8): Control, TAA, OJE 10 (TAA with OJE 10 mg/kg), OJE 100 (TAA with OJE 100 mg/kg) and silymarin (TAA with Silymarin 50 mg/kg). Fibrosis was induced by treatment with TAA (200 mg/kg, i.p. ) twice per week for 13 weeks, while OJE and silymarin were administered orally two times per week from week 7 to 13. The fibrotic related gene expression serum biomarkers glutathione and hydroxyproline were estimated by RT-PCR and spectrophotometry, respectively, using commercial kits. OJE (0.5 and 0.1 mg/mL) and silymarin (0.05 mg/mL) treatment significantly ( P < 0.01 and P < 0.001) induced apoptosis (16.95% and 27.48% for OJE and 25.87% for silymarin, respectively) in HSC-T6 cells when compared with the control group (9.09%). Further, rat primary HSCs showed changes in morphology in response to OJE 0.1 mg/mL treatment. In in vivo studies, OJE (10 and 100 mg/kg) treatment significantly ameliorated TAA-induced alterations in levels of serum biomarkers, fibrotic related gene expression, glutathione, and hydroxyproline ( P < 0.05- P < 0.001) and rescued the histopathological changes. OJE can be developed as a potential agent for the treatment of hepatofibrosis.\n\nCurrent status of non-native fish species in the St. Louis River estuary\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThe fish community of the St. Louis River estuary is well characterized, thanks to fishery assessment and invasive species early detection monitoring by federal, state, and tribal agencies.

The incidence of raised skin lesions (mucoid plaques) was high (31 %), however, microscopically only 4.5 % of the white suckers had neoplasia (papillomas). The remaining lesions were epidermal hyperplasia. Superior Bay had the lowest percentage of skin/lip lesions (10 %), while St. Louis Bay had the highest (44 %). St. Louis Bay also had the highest incidence of skin neoplasms (12 %). No hepatocellular neoplasms were documented, however bile duct tumors were observed in 4.5 % of the suckers. Foci of cellular alteration were observed in fish from all sites except the upper AOC. Stable isotope data indicated that most of the suckers relied on the St. Louis River AOC for the majority (>75 %) of their diet, indicating they were resident within the AOC and not in Lake Superior. The amount of diet obtained from the upper estuary was a significant predictor of skin lesion incidence. Hence, habitat use within the AOC appears to be an important risk factor for skin and possibly, liver lesions.\n\nInfluence of Sex and Age on Natural Resistance to St. Louis Encephalitis Virus Infection in Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAndersen, Arthur A.; Hanson, Robert P.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nA difference was observed in susceptibility of adult male and female mice to St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus as measured by the death rate after intravenous challenge. Female mice that had susceptibility similar to that of males at 2 months of age had increased resistance to SLE virus at 3 and 4 months of age. The increased resistance occurred after sexual maturity, indicating that the resistance factor possibly was related to an aging process in the female. The susceptibility of male mice remained unchanged over the 2- to 4-month period. Neither pregnancy nor castration had any effect on resistance of adult mice to St. Louis encephalitis virus.

Though researchers have analyzed and described various sociodemographic characteristics of SIDS and infant deaths by unintentional suffocation in St. Louis, they have not simultaneously controlled for contributory risk factors to racial disparity such as race, poverty, maternal education, and number of children born to each mother (parity). To determine whether there is a relationship between maternal socioeconomic factors and sleep-related infant death. This quantitative case-control study used secondary data collected by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services between 2005 and 2009. The sample includes matched birth/death certificates and living birth certificates of infants who were born/died within time frame. Descriptive analysis, Chi-square, and logistic regression. The controls were birth records of infants who lived more than 1 year. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses confirmed that race and poverty have significant relationships with infant sleep-related deaths. The social significance of this study is that the results may lead to population-specific modifications of prevention messages that will reduce infant sleep-related deaths.

In an effort to control the abundance of ruffe and limit dispersal, a top-down control strategy using predators was implemented in 1989. We used bioenergetics modeling to examine the efficacy of top-down control in the St. Louis River from 1991 to 1994. Five predators--northern pike (Esox lucius), walleye (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui), brown bullhead (Ictalurus nebulosus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens)--were modeled to determine their consumption of ruffe and four other native prey species-spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius), emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), and black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus). Although predators ate as much as 47% of the ruffe biomass in 1 year, they were not able to halt the increase in ruffe abundance. The St. Louis River is an open system that allows predators to move freely out of the system, and the biomass of managed predators did not increase. A selectivity index showed all five predators selected the native prey and avoided ruffe. The St. Louis River has several predator and prey species creating many complex predator-prey interactions; and top-down control of ruffe by the predators examined in this study did not occur.\n\nTeach for St. Louis: Cross-Cultural Challenges and Successes of New Teachers\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTao, Sarah A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTeach For America (TFA) teachers are placed in urban, impoverished, and highly diverse schools.

Calendar year 1985\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNot Available\n\n1986-04-01\n\nDuring 1985, the environmental monitoring program was continued at the St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS) in St. Louis County, Missouri. The ditches north and south of the site have been designated for cleanup as part of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP), a United States Department of Energy (DOE) program to identify, decontaminate, or otherwise control sites where low-level radioactive contamination remains from the early years of the nation's atomic energy program. The site is not currently controlled or regulated by DOE or NRC, although radiological monitoring of the site has been authorized by the DOE. The monitoringmoreÂ Â» program at the SLAPS measures radon gas concentrations in air; external gamma radiation dose rates; and uranium, thorium, and radium concentrations in surface water, groundwater, and sediment. Potential radiation doses to the public are also calculated. Because the site is not controlled or regulated by the DOE, the DOE Derived Concentration Guides (DCGs) are not applicable to SLAPS, but are included as a basis for comparison only.
