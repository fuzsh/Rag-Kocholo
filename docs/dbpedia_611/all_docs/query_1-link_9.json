        "text": "\"Success is not measured by the position one has reached in life\n\nas by the obstacles which [one] has overcome while trying to succeed.\"\n\nâ€“ Booker T. Washington\n\nThe National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion joins the Nation in commemorating Black History Month. Our theme is \"Success Always Leaves Footprints.\" It celebrates the numerous accomplishments and the meaningful legacy of Blacks throughout history. Our footprints, like legacies, encourages upcoming generations in recognizing the importance of lifting others and being proud of their heritage. What we see, what we do today and in this moment, will inevitably become a footprint in history. Our lives must not only be defined by what we do with what we learn, but also by the discoveries that come from what you create with the things you learn.\n\nThese Black Americans have and are presently leaving footprints for the future. We are proud to recognize them this month and each day of the year.\n\nShirley Jackson is a physicist and the eighteenth president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
