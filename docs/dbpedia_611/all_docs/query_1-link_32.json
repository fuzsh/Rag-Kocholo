        "text": "It is with great sadness that we share news of the passing of an exceptional IBMer, Robert Dennard. Many IBMers, researchers, scientists, and colleagues across the industry had the great fortune to work with ‚Äì and learn from ‚Äì Bob during his 50-plus year career at IBM. Brilliant, creative, passionate, and generous with his time and wisdom, Bob epitomized the spirit of IBM. His contributions ‚Äî not just to IBM but to science and technology ‚Äî laid the foundation for modern computing. Most notably, Bob is recognized as the inventor of DRAM, shepherding his hypothesis about the potential impact of storing a bit of information in a single transistor and capacitor cell into the invention of dynamic random-access memory in the 1960s. DRAM spearheaded exponential progress in memory capacity and speed, and catalyzed what is today a global market expected to soon surpass $100 billion. For those who did not have the benefit of working with Bob during his career here, know that his work ethic, mentorship and ingenuity helped shape the culture at IBM Research, and that his presence is still felt. As he and colleagues grappled with the related challenges of scaling and power consumption, Bob offered, ‚ÄúYes, there is an end to scaling. But there is no end to creativity.‚Äù To learn more about Bob‚Äôs enduring legacy, and to share your fond memories and reflections, please head to the page below: https://ibm.co/3JUoNCa\n\nRobert Dennard: The Man Behind DRAM and the Evolution of Modern Computing Robert Dennard, an IBM researcher, invented dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), a revolutionary memory cell used in nearly every computer and electronic device today. Dennard‚Äôs work also led to the formulation of Dennard‚Äôs law, which predicted that as transistors get smaller, their performance per watt would increase, enabling faster, more efficient computers. However, by 2005, as transistors began to leak and consume more energy, Dennard‚Äôs law broke down. Despite this, Dennard‚Äôs contributions have significantly shaped modern technology and the culture at IBM‚Äôs Thomas J. Watson Research Center. Dennard passed away in 2024 at the age of 91. https://lnkd.in/e_Vj_JC2\n\nEver wondered how something made of silicon can think? When I was a kid, I used to think the CPU had dwarfs helping us do things. üòÇ üòÇ I recently completed the \"How Computers Work\" course from the prestigious University of London on Coursera! üéì‚ú® Delving into the intricate world of computer hardware, I discovered how these incredible machines are capable of thinking and making decisions. This journey has deepened my understanding of the fascinating intersection between hardware and intelligence. üñ•Ô∏èü§ñ A huge shoutout to the University of London for this enlightening experience and to Coursera for providing such a fantastic platform for learning and growth. Looking forward to applying this knowledge to innovate and push the boundaries of technology! üöÄüí° #LearningNeverStops #ComputerScience #Hardware #Technology #Innovation #Coursera #UniversityOfLondon\n\nI was lucky enough to be invited to the University of Cambridge last week to look at Project DAWN. I also got to see an Intel Corporation Ponte Vecchio based Dell Technologies server built ready for (and fitted with) CoolIT Systems cold plates (those who know, know how cool this is - pun intended). Chatting with our host he did point out that we are now outperforming Moore's Law regarding computing power. This is amazing but brings into perspective even more clearly the huge shortfall in skilled human resources. As IT continues to exponentially increase in performance, humanity seems to conversely continue to fail to match anywhere near the same scale of levelling up of skills. I keep reading that DCs are resource hungry (not necessarily true) but they are also human skills hungry and those skills are in short demand. If we want to realize our potential (and stop people in DCs getting job offers on a daily basis üòÆ ) we need to start our own law of exponentially improving training and skilling up. I would call it Farquharson's Law but no-one could spell it so maybe Joe's Law (after Joe Bishop who told me about the other bit) - those that learn teach others and as such we create the skills we need at an increasing, if not exponential rate. #IntelyesItookyourimagebutitwasontheinternetdontsueme #teamisg #datacentre #datacenter\n\nIn total, 60 authors who contributed to 16 of the 37 papers accepted at CGO 2024 are researchers working in the industry.
