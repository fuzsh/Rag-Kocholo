Hence, the extension of the BSC is also required to help the social business organisation in delivering their multiple bottom lines in the most effective ways and provide organisations a mechanism to track their performance holistically through both quantitative and qualitative information. The growing of Islamic Philanthropy Institutions (IPI especially in Malaysia with the objective to promote social development based on the charitable activities has been acknowledged by the society. Therefore, in order to ensure the sustainability of these institutions, a proper measurement system is required to ensure the final goal of the institutions is achievable and successful. Thus, the objective of this paper is to formulate the main indicators and variables that are suitable to measure the IPIs based on BSC system in four main perspectives which are financial perspective, stakeholderâs perspective, internal process perspective and learning and growth perspective. The uniqueness of the establishment of IPIs would require different indicators and variables which are more appropriate as compared with the profit sector organisations. The outcome of this study could provide clear picture and guidelines in designing a proper performance measurement system to be implemented by current IPIs in Malaysia in order to maintain the sustainability and competitiveness of this institutions in future.\n\nBETWEEN PARCIMONY AND COMPLEXITY: COMPARING PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR ROMANIAN BANKING INSTITUTIONS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nANCA MUNTEANU\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The main objective of this study is to establish the relationship between traditional measures of performance (ROE, ROA and NIM and EVA in order to gain some insight about the relevance of using more sophisticated performance measurements tools. Towards this end the study uses two acknowledged statistical measures: Kendallâs Tau and Spearman rank correlation Index. Using data from 12 Romanian banking institutions that report under IFRS for the period 2006-2010 the results suggest that generally EVA is highly correlated with Residual Income in the years that present positive operational profits whereas for the years with negative outcome the correlation is low. ROA and ROE are the measure that best correlates with EVA for the entire period and thus -applying Occamâs razor- could be used as a substitute for more complex shareholder earnings measures.\n\nFinal Report: Performance Engineering Research Institute\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMellor-Crummey, John [Rice Univ., Houston, TX (United States)\n\n2014-10-27\n\nThis document is a final report about the work performed for cooperative agreement DE-FC02-06ER25764, the Rice University effort of Performance Engineering Research Institute (PERI).

It analytically answer two research questions: Do institutional isomorphism exist in the implementation of performance measurement system and accountability in public sector organizations? (RQ1 and Do government agencies actually use performance measurement information to aid decision-making and help plan for future performance improvement? (RQ2. This study is a qualitative research to answer two research question proposed with use semi-stuctured and open interview from SKPD officers in the local government of Yogyakarta Province. The results of interview were analyzed use thematic content analysis. Our finding show that three form of institutional isomorphism (coersive, mimetic and normative were existed in the implementation of performance measurement system and accountability in public sector organizations. This result also show an interesting finding in government agency that performance information who reported in LAKIP was only a formality. The information content in LAKIP is not used as feedback to aid decision-making and plan for future performance improvement.\n\nBehavioral Change and Building Performance: Strategies for Significant, Persistent, and Measurable Institutional Change\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWolfe, Amy K.; Malone, Elizabeth L.; Heerwagen, Judith H.; Dion, Jerome P.\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThe people who use Federal buildings â Federal employees, operations and maintenance staff, and the general public â can significantly impact a buildingâs environmental performance and the consumption of energy, water, and materials. Many factors influence building occupantsâ use of resources (use behaviors) including work process requirements, ability to fulfill agency missions, new and possibly unfamiliar high-efficiency/high-performance building technologies; a lack of understanding, education, and training; inaccessible information or ineffective feedback mechanisms; and cultural norms and institutional rules and requirements, among others. While many strategies have been used to introduce new occupant use behaviors that promote sustainability and reduced resource consumption, few have been verified in the scientific literature or have properly documented case study results. This paper documents validated strategies that have been shown to encourage new use behaviors that can result in significant, persistent, and measureable reductions in resource consumption. From the peer-reviewed literature, the paper identifies relevant strategies for Federal facilities and commercial buildings that focus on the individual, groups of individuals (e.g., work groups), and institutions â their policies, requirements, and culture. The paper documents methods with evidence of success in changing use behaviors and enabling occupants to effectively interact with new technologies/designs. It also provides a case study of the strategies used at a Federal facility â Fort Carson, Colorado. The paper documents gaps in the current literature and approaches, and provides topics for future research.\n\nCorrelation between nutritional status and comprehensive physical performance measures among older adults with undernourishment in residential institutions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSingh DKA\n\n2014-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Devinder KA Singh,1 Zahara A Manaf,2 Noor Aini M Yusoff,3 Nur A Muhammad,2 Mei Fang Phan,1 Suzana Shahar2 1Physiotherapy Program, School of Rehabilitation Sciences, 2Nutrition and Dietetics Program, School of Health Care Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, 3ASIA Metropolitan University, Cheras, Malaysia Purpose: The consequences of combined undernourishment and decreased physical Â­performance in older adults are debilitating and increases cost of care. To date, the information regarding the association between nutritional status and physical performance does not provide a complete picture. Most studies used limited or self-reported measures to evaluate physical performance. The objective of this study was to examine the correlation between nutritional status and comprehensive physical performance measures among undernourished older adults who reside in residential institutions.Methods: Forty-seven older adults (26Â males, 21Â females aged â¥60Â (69.23Â±8.63 years who were identified as undernourished from two residential institutions participated in this study. A battery of physical performance tests (10Â m gait speed test, dominant hand grip strength test, timed five-repetition sit-to-stand test, ten step test, arm curl test, scratch test, and respiratory muscle strength test, biochemical profiles (serum albumin, hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and prealbumin levels, and falls risk using the short-form Physiological Profile Approach were performed. The Functional Ability Questionnaire and Geriatric Depression Scale were also administered.Results: The results demonstrated that generally older adults with undernourishment scored poorly on the physical performance tests, had depression, and a high risk of falls. Biochemical results demonstrated that 10.9% of the participants were anemic, 63% had hypoalbuminemia (<3.5Â g/dL, and 21.7% were at risk of protein energy malnutrition with prealbumin level (100â170Â mg/L.

The main source containing this information is profit and loss statement. A correct and complete information can not be limited to this annual report. Understanding the concept of financial performance requires a holistic approach of the entity. An overview of information on financial performance will be achieved by coordinating information about the profit of the entity, rates of return, cash flows, financing cost and risk. For the economic and financial analysis we often use to separate financial equilibrium indicators of outcome indicators and management indicators. The study upon the financial performance may be based on the income statement, balance sheet and explanatory notes. It may use tools such as: income, interest rates, rates of return, rates of structure, liquidity and solvency rates, rotation rates, cash flows, debt coverage rates and more. Management of banking assets, liabilities and bank risk management must be assembled into a whole. In an uncertain environment, continuously changing, under conditions of the economic and financial crisis, the binomial profitability - risk is increasingly difficult to manage. Under these conditions, the boundary between courage and unconsciousness is also more fragile. On the other hand, the prudence, mandatory rules could be understood as some constraint measures on bank management, that may adversely affect the financial performance of the credit institution.\n\nSMEs, Institutions and Performance\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nJensen, Camilla; Low, Mei Peng\n\n2013-01-01\n\nfor combining the resource-based theory with an institutions-based approach towards constructing a more practical and empirical oriented analytical framework.

However, it is not clear if the adoption of the BSC model is appropriate, or yet is hard to perceive how HEIs have modified and implemented this tool for evaluating educational institutions, public or privates, in Brazil. This study aims to fill the gap existent in the context of using the BSC in organizations. We intend to demonstrate how these organizations use performance indicators to measure their primary activities. A quantitative and exploratory study was developed from the analysis of performance indicators found in the web sites to Brazilian universities. A total of 91 Brazilian private universities evaluation process were reviewed. Even with a considerable amount of private HEIs there are few that have performance indicators guided by numerical and statistical data covering its main activities which is a concern for their managers in terms of managerial control.\n\nFACTORS INFLUENCING THE SUCCESS OF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT: EVIDENCE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHerlina Primarisanti\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available There were only a few government institutions in Indonesia capable of preparing good accountability reports. Based on the survey conducted in the Special District of Yogyakarta, the study aimed to empirically examine the influencing factors in the development of the measure-ment system of performance, performance accountability and the use of performance informa-tion. Additionally, it also tried to interpret and to explain empirical evidence in the perspective of the institutional theory. The institutional theory was used to find out the extent to which the development of the measurement system of the performance, the performance accountability and the use of the performance information was influenced because of the presence of coercive, mimetic and normative isomorphism phenomena. The study used mixed methods that combined quantitative and qualitative study approaches simultaneously and a sequential explanatory strategy. It used Partial Least Square (PLS analysis to test the hypotheses. It gave evidence that training, incentives and authority in decision making had significant impacts on the development of the measurement of the performance, the performance accountability and the use of the performance information. It contributed to the understanding of the influencing factors of the development of the measurement system of the performance, the performance accountability and the use of the performance information in order to improve the measurement system of the performance of government institutions.\n\nDiagnostic colonoscopy: performance measurement study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKuznets, Naomi\n\n2002-07-01\n\nThis is the fifth of a series of best practices studies undertaken by the Performance Measurement Initiative (PMI), the centerpiece of the Institute for Quality Improvement (IQI), a not-for-profit quality improvement subsidiary of the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) (Performance Measurement Initiative, 1999a, 1999b, 2000a, 2000b). The IQI was created to offer clinical performance measurement and improvement opportunities to ambulatory health care organizations and others interested in quality patient care. The purpose of the study was to provide opportunities to initiate clinical performance measurement on key processes and outcomes for this procedure and use this information for clinical quality improvement. This article provides performance measurement information on how organizations that have demonstrated and validated differences in clinical practice can have similar outcomes, but at a dramatically lower cost. The intent of the article is to provide organizations with alternatives in practice to provide a better value to their patients.\n\nIRE (Institut National des Radioelements) site in Belgium.

It includes analysis of MFIs of India. This study includes analysis of performance of microfinance institutions with reference to both financial and non-financial ways. Performance of microfinance institutions is measured using four parameters, which are sustainability/profitability, outreach, operational and financial efficiency. Data is taken of 99 Microfinance Institutions of India from the Microfinance Information Exchange for a period of 11 years. Variables of this study are both in absolute and relative terms. The endogenous variables are Return on Assets and Return on Equity for sustainability, Number of Borrowers per Staff Member for operational efficiency, Cost per Borrower for financial efficiency, and Number of Active Borrowers for outreach. Panel data analysis is done after checking the assumptions of the model. Hausman Test is applied to find out the suitability of Fixed or Random Effect Model. Both random and fixed effect were found suitable for application. In addition to this descriptive analysis of the variables is also done. The results show that most of the variables used in the study are significant in outreach model; other than rank, financial revenue to assets ratio, portfolio at risk, deposits, and capital to assets ratio all other variables are significant in case of sustainability using ROA model and same variables are found insignificant in ROE model except financial expense to assets ratio; in financial efficiency model both significant and insignificant variables are found; and in case of operational efficiency all variables are found significant.\n\nDoes agreement on institutional values and leadership issues between deans and surgery chairs predict their institutions' performance?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSouba, Wiley W; Mauger, David; Day, David V\n\n2007-03-01\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the values that medical school deans and surgery chairs consider most essential for effective leadership, to assess their perceptions of the values and leadership climate in their institutions, and to test the premise that agreement on leadership values and climate predict greater organizational effectiveness and performance. From June 2005 through March 2006, questionnaires designed to assess leadership core values and organizational leadership climate were mailed to medical school deans and surgery chairs of the 125 U.S. academic health centers. Institutional performance measures used were the National Institutes of Health (NIH) standing and U.S. News and World Report ranking of each institution. Sixty-eight surgery chairs (54%) and 60 deans (48%) returned surveys. Q-sort results on 38 positive leadership values indicated that integrity, trust, and vision were considered the most important core values for effective leadership by both chairs and deans. Both groups ranked business acumen, authority, and institutional reputation as least important. Deans consistently ranked the leadership climate as being healthier (more positive) than did their surgery chairs on multiple scale items: leadership is widely shared (P = .005), information is widely shared (P = .002), missions are aligned (P = .003), open communication is the norm (P = .009), good performance is rewarded (P = .01), teamwork is widely practiced (P = .01), and leaders are held accountable (P = 002). Tighter alignment between chairs and deans on core values and on the leadership climate scale correlated with higher school and department NIH standing and higher U.S. News and World Report medical school and hospital ranking (P leadership values, deans believe that a healthier leadership climate exists in their institutions than their surgery chairs do. The study findings suggest that tighter leadership alignment between deans and surgery chairs may predict a higher level of\n\n28 CFR 545.22 - Institution work and performance pay committee.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 28 Judicial Administration 2 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Institution work and performance pay...

However, it is difficult to summarize the results of individual-items analyses, whereas sum-scores may be meaningless if the dimensions that the items are assumed to measure are not verified. Although these limitations are circumvented by using factor analysis, response styles may still bias research results. We use data from Guyana to show that a second-order factor model is appropriate for measuring institutional trust. We also demonstrate that response styles can inflate item and factor convergent validity and may either distort regression effects or create completely spurious ones. We therefore recommend using factor models with corrections for response styles in institutional trust research instead of sum-scores and individual-items analyses.\n\nPerformance Measures for Public Participation Methods : Final Report\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPublic engagement is an important part of transportation project development, but measuring its effectiveness is typically piecemealed.

Random errors can be assessed by institutes themselves by repeated measurements, but systematic deviations cannot be assessed without comparisons with other institutes. The comparisons were performed for illuminated IV, spectral response and reflection measurements. The results were split into systematic differences between the partners and random differences within an institute for a single measurement session. The total differences are: J{sub sc}: 0.27 A, V{sub oc}: 8.5 mV, FF: 2.4 %, {eta}: 0.6%, spectral response: 0.14 A/W and reflection: 0.08. For all measurement methods, the systematic differences exceeded the random differences. The major component for the systematic differences is likely the reference device, but also temperature control, contacting scheme and setup differences play a part.\n\nInformation Security Governanceas as Key Performance Indicator for Financial Institutions\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKrjukovs, D; Strauss, R\n\n2009-01-01\n\nDue to their nature financial institutions and their performance are in constant focus of attention from different stakeholder groups.

IÅ¡oraitÄ\n\n2004-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The article analyses the following issues: 1. Performance measurement in literature. The performance measurement has an important role to play in the efficient and effective management of organizations. Kaplan and Johnson highlighted the failure of the financial measures to reflect changes in the competitive circumstances and strategies of modern organizations. Many authors have focused attention on how organizations can design more appropriate measurement systems. Based on literature, consultancy experience and action research, numerous processes have been developed that organizations can follow in order to design and implement systems. Many frameworks have been proposed that support these processes. The objective of such frameworks is to help organizations define a set of measures that reflect their objectives and assess their performance appropriately. 2. Transport sector performance and its impacts measuring. The purpose of transport measurement is to identify opportunities enhancing transport performance. Successful transport sector management requires a system to analyze its efficiency and effectiveness as well as plan interventions if transport sector performance needs improvement. Transport impacts must be measurable and monitorable so that the person responsible for the project intervention can decide when and how to influence them. Performance indicators provide a means to measure and monitor impacts. These indicators essentially reflect quantitative and qualitative aspects of impacts at given time and places. 3. Transport sector output and input. Transport sector inputs are the resources required to deliver transport sector outputs. Transport sector inputs are typically: human resources, particularly skilled resources (including specialists consulting inputs; technology processes such as equipment and work; and finance, both public and private. 4.

Leaders of integrated health systems need to develop a methodology and system that align organizational strategies with performance measurement and management. To meet this end, multiple healthcare organizations embrace the performance-indicators reporting system known as a \"balanced scorecard\" or a \"dashboard report.\" This discrete set of macrolevel indicators gives senior management a fast but comprehensive glimpse of the organization's performance in meeting its quality, operational, and financial goals. The leadership of outpatient operations for Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota built on this concept by creating a performance management and measurement system that monitors and reports how well the organization achieves its performance goals. Internal stakeholders identified metrics to measure performance in each key category. Through these metrics, the organization links Mayo Clinic's vision, primary value, core principles, and day-to-day operations by monitoring key performance indicators on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis.\n\nDEVELOPMENT AND EFFICIENCY OF BUDGET OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS BY THE METHOD BASED ON PERFORMANCE\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIrina-Ètefana, CIBOTARIU\n\n2014-11-01\n\nFull Text Available In Romania, public sector performance is a concept on which it has been written very little and rarely applied in practice. The situation is not the same in developed countries economically to where we focus our attention, regarded as models for our country. Internationally, since the early 70s of the last century there were initiated processes of modernization and reorganization of public institutions in different countries. The society required a higher efficiency of the services provided by it, a better use of public services and also an effective bureaucratic model. It can be said that only in this context, government institutions can gain strength, consistency and can become more reliable. Flexibility, decentralization, creativity, self-management and management contract, all used as measurement tools are the basic features of a managerial reforms that focus on results. Determining the results in the public sector and implementing a system of financial and nonfinancial performance measurement requires a clear definition of the objectives and goals of each organization and component institution.\n\nAnnual index & ranking for institutional Open Access performance\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nGrigorov, Ivo\n\nA simple institutional index based on % of peer-review publications that are accessible through (gold and/or green) OA via the internet, can be a very powerful tool for both administrators and funders to see where their efforts and institutions rank in the global OA effort. Credible answers...... to questions like: \"Who are the leaders?\", \"Who are the latest performers?\", \"What publicly-funded institutes researching into topical themes with socio-economic consequences, could do better at making their research accessible to stakeholders?\" can also stimulate non-commited institutes to invest more in OA...\n\nRole of institutional controls in selection of remedial measures\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBakr, A.A.; Agoston, E.N.; McLeod, R.V.; Hicks, H.T.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis paper explores the regulatory intent of CERCLA's definition and applicability of institutional controls at hazardous substance release sites undergoing remedial action and institutional controls that have been defined and implemented at selected CERCLA (Superfund) sites in the United States. Under provisions of CERCLA, institutional controls can be components of, or supplements to, interim or final remedial measures for hazardous substance [as defined under CERCLA 101(14)] releases. The use of institutional controls has been proposed in a number of RODs for large Superfund sites (e.g., Times Beach, Missouri; the Clothier Disposal Site in Oswego County, New York; and the Wildcat Landfill in Kent County, Delaware). In these cases, the selected remedial actions combine active response measures with institutional controls to protect human health and the environment. These RODs provide insight to how widely the concept of institutional controls is used and under what conditions. The use of institutional controls at large federal facilities is also discussed\n\nIssues with performance measures for dynamic multi-objective optimisation\n\nCSIR Research Space (South Africa)\n\nHelbig, M\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Dynamic and Uncertain Environments (CIDUE), Mexico, 20-23 June 2013 Issues with Performance Measures for Dynamic Multi-objective Optimisation MardÂ´e Helbig CSIR: Meraka Institute Brummeria, South Africa...\n\nDifferences in technology innovation R&D performance creation behavior between for-profit institutions and not-for-profit institutions.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPark, Sungmin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe present study compares the performance creation behavior between for-profit institutions and not-for-profit institutions within a national technology innovation research and development (R&D) program. Based on the stepwise performance creation chain structure of typical R&D logic models, a series of successive binary logistic regression models is newly proposed. Using the models, a sample of nÂ =Â 2076 completed government-sponsored R&D projects was analyzed. For each institution type, its distinctive behavior is diagnosed, and relevant implications are suggested for improving the R&D performance.\n\nPerformance Evaluation of Indian Technical Institutions Using PROMETHEE-GAIA Approach\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRanjan, Rajeev; Chakraborty, Shankar\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIt has now become an important issue to evaluate the performance of technical institutions to develop better research and enrich the existing teaching processes.

This work describes the development of a rating instrument created from a multi-institutional consortium. Using a participatory design and a modified Delphi approach, a multi-institutional group of expert otologists constructed a 15-element task-based checklist for evaluating mastoidectomy performance. This instrument was further refined into a 14-element checklist focusing on the concept of safety after using it to rate a large and varied population of performances. Twelve otolaryngological surgical training programs in the United States. A total of 14 surgeons from 12 different institutions took part in the construction of the instrument. By using 14 experts from 12 different institutions and a literature review, individual metrics were identified, rated as to the level of importance and operationally defined to create a rating scale for mastoidectomy performance. Initial use of the rating scale showed modest rater agreement. The operational definitions of individual metrics were modified to emphasize \"safe\" as opposed to \"proper\" technique. A second rating instrument was developed based on this feedback. Using a consensus-building approach with multiple rounds of communication between experts is a feasible way to construct a rating instrument for mastoidectomy. Expert opinion alone using a Delphi method provides face and content validity evidence, however, this is not sufficient to develop a universally acceptable rating instrument. A continued process of development and experimentation to demonstrate evidence for reliability and validity making use of a large population of raters and performances is necessary to achieve universal acceptance.

This is very important for sustainable quality in technical educational institutions. Applied kinds of software, which are taught at technical educational institutions, have to offer the professional and methodical knowledge concerning conditions of working ambient for students of selected technical specialisations. This skill is performed in such a way that the graduates, after entering the practical professional life, will be able to participate in solutions for actual problems that are related to environmental protection by means of software support. Nowadays, during the training processit is also obligatory to introduce technical science. Taking into consideration the above-mentioned facts it is possible to say that information technology support for environmental study subjects is a relevant aspect, which should be integrated into the university educational process. There is an effective progress that further highlights the focus on the quality of university education not only for environmental engineers. Actual trends require an increasing number of software/hardware educated engineers who can participate in qualitative university preparation, i.e.IT environmentalists. The Department of Environmental Engineering at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, TechnicalUniversity in KoÅ¡ice, Slovakia is an institution specified and intended for quality objectivisation. This institution introduced into the study programmes (âEnvironmental Managementâ and âTechnology of Environmental Protectionâ study subjects with the software support, which are oriented towards outdoor and indoor ambient and in this way the Department of Process and Environmental Engineering is integrated effectively and intensively into the area of measurement training with regard to the requirement of quality educational processes.\n\nMicrofinance Performance and Informal Institutions : A Cross-country Analysis\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nHermes, Cornelis; Postelnicu, Luminita\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper investigates the relationship between the extent to which informal institutions are developed at the country-level and the financial and social performance of MFIs, using data from institutions active in 100 countries.

Microfinance institutions (MFIs have mostly a high concentration of women beneficiaries and aim at alleviation of poverty in all its forms. Accordingly, the principal purpose of microfinance institutions is to be social performing by reducing poverty. However, they have to reconcile this objective with financial performance by trying to be profitable and sustainable. On other side, Islamic Microfinance has progressively growing in the world, particularly in poor countries, as credible alternative which allows poor populations to have access to basic financial services at low cost. The integration of Islamic finance concepts to microfinance was one of the valuable reasons in attracting poor to get advantage of these services. Whereas the complexity of these methods in microfinance and lack of transparency in profit distribution, there are some challenges about their efficiency. It is therefore of utmost interest to consider if the financial performance of Islamic microfinance institutions will be negatively correlated with the depth of outreach. The aim of this paper is to examine the performance of Islamic microfinance institutions in comparison with conventional institutions. This study focuses analysis on the MENA region, where a large proportion of the poor are practicing Muslims and are thus unable to take advantage of traditional microfinance contracts which are incompatible with Shariaâ. Using a non parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA to estimate the efficiency of the microfinance institutions, our study provides the empirical evidence from Islamic and conventional microfinance institutions in MENA region.\n\nMeasuring systemic importance of financial institutions: An extreme value theory approach\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGravelle, Toni; Li, Fuchun\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we define a financial institution's contribution to financial systemic risk as the increase in financial systemic risk conditional on the crash of the financial institution.

It provides empirical evidence about the relationship between the use of a performance measurement system and the organizational factors of accountability and organizational performance. We investigate the three roles of a performance measurement system (its operational use, incentive use, and exploratory use, and three organizational factors (contractibility, the legislative mandate, and management commitment. A mixed method approach with sequential explanatory design was used to answer the research question. The hypotheses testing used Structural Equation Modelling-Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS. Our findings were based on survey data from 137 SKPD officers in the local government of Yogyakarta Province, and showed that management commitment had a positive association with accountability and organizational performance. We also found a positive association between the legislative mandate and accountability. However, this research did not find any significant association among the three roles of the performance measurement system with accountability and organizational performance. Based on the institutional theory, our findings show substantial contributions by the institutional isomorphism, which was used in an appropriate manner to explain the context of public sector organizations, especially in the local government of Yogyakarta Province.\n\nTechnology transfer from biomedical research to clinical practice: measuring innovation performance.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBalas, E Andrew; Elkin, Peter L\n\n2013-12-01\n\nStudies documented 17 years of transfer time from clinical trials to practice of care. Launched in 2002, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) translational research initiative needs to develop metrics for impact assessment. A recent White House report highlighted that research and development productivity is declining as a result of increased research spending while the new drugs output is flat. The goal of this study was to develop an expanded model of research-based innovation and performance thresholds of transfer from research to practice. Models for transfer of research to practice have been collected and reviewed. Subsequently, innovation pathways have been specified based on common characteristics. An integrated, intellectual property transfer model is described. The central but often disregarded role of research innovation disclosure is highlighted. Measures of research transfer and milestones of progress have been identified based on the Association of University Technology Managers 2012 performance reports. Numeric milestones of technology transfer are recommended at threshold (top 50%), target (top 25%), and stretch goal (top 10%) performance levels. Transfer measures and corresponding target levels include research spending to disclosure (0.81), patents to start-up (>0.1), patents to licenses (>2.25), and average per license income (>$48,000). Several limitations of measurement are described. Academic institutions should take strategic steps to bring innovation to the center of scholarly discussions. Research on research, particularly on pathways to disclosures, is needed to improve R&D productivity. Researchers should be informed about the technology transfer performance of their institution and regulations should better support innovators.\n\nInstitutions, distributed cognition and agency: rule-following as performative action\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nHerrmann-Pillath, Carsten\n\n2011-01-01\n\nRecently, Aoki proposed the concept of substantive institutions which relates outcomes of strategic interaction with public representations of equilibrium states of games.

Ayuk\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Orientation:Â This study outlinesÂ institutional effectivenessÂ (IE in higher education (HE and interrogates its underlying elements from a student perspective. Following a review of contemporary perspectives on student educational outcomes, the study identifies and explores the importance of four pertinent indicators of IE in the context of a South African (SA higher education institution (HEI. Â Research purpose:Â This study aimed to explore the structural validity and reliability of the Student Educational Outcomes Effectiveness Questionnaire (SEEQ, administered to students at an SA HEI, collecting data on their perceptions of IE. Â Motivation for the study:Â Institutional effectiveness is a contested concept in HE and several approaches to define it, using various sets of underpinning elements, can be found. The conceptualisation and measuring of IE within the SA HE sector is a hugely neglected area of research. This study therefore attempted to delineate and to gauge IE, utilising the perceptions and preferences of students at an SA HEI. Â Research design, approach and method:Â Data for this study were collected using a self-selection sample (NÂ = 807 of students from four schools at the selected HEI. Reliability and exploratory factor analyses were performed to explore the internal consistency and structural validity of the above-mentioned SEEQ. Â Main findings:Â The reliability of SEEQ is deemed to be acceptable and the validity of the four theoretical constructs (or dimensions hypothesised in respect of IE from a student perspective were supported. Â Practical/managerial implications:Â Preliminary empirical evidence suggests that SEEQ could be employed in a cautious manner by HEIs (especially in SA, with a view to gauge IE, as well as to promoting the scholarship and management of institutional performance and student success.

The Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS), the most widely used performance measurement set in the U.S., includes a number of measures that evaluate preventive and chronic care provided in ambulatory care facilities. While HEDIS has made important contributions to the tracking of ambulatory care quality, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the measurement set could be improved by providing quality of care information at the levels of greatest interest to consumers and purchasers of care, namely for individual physicians, clinics and physician organizations. This article focuses on the improvement opportunities for quality performance measurement systems in ambulatory care. Specific challenges to creating a sustainable performance measurement system at the level of physician organizations, such as defining the purpose of the system, the accountability logic, information and reporting needs and mechanisms for sustainable implementation, are discussed.\n\nBudget institutions and fiscal performance of the Brazilian Federal Government\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAna Carolina Giuberti\n\n2015-05-01\n\nFull Text Available This article aims to assess the impact of federal budget institutions on the primary deficit of the Brazilian Federal Government from 1985 to 2009, a period marked by important changes in these institutions. Based on the methodology established in the literature on political economy that is linked to the macroeconomic mainstream, three sets of budget indices and their respective sub-indices are constructed, and their behaviour over the period of analysis indicate that the changes made have resulted in institutions that induce greater fiscal discipline. Regarding the effect of these institutions on the fiscal performance, the results allow us to conclude that the institutional changes have contributed to a lower government deficit.\n\nTowards Sustainable Performance Measurement Frameworks for Applied Research in Canadian Community Colleges and Institutes\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWilliams, Keith\n\n2014-01-01\n\nApplied Research (AR) in Canadian community colleges is driven by a mandate, via the collective voice of Colleges and Institutes Canada--a national voluntary membership association of publicly supported colleges and related institutions--to address issues of interest to industry, government, and/or community.

Public research institutions are characterized by multiple stakeholders with different needs, and the management of R&D activities requires balancing the multiple goals of different stakeholders. This characteristic is a key issue in the process of construction of the PMS. Empirical evidence is provided by an Italian public research centre, where the researchers carried out a project aimed to develop a PMS following action research principles. This project gave the possibility to researchers to interact with different stakeholders and integrate their different information needs in a comprehensive set of key performance indicators (KPIs. As a result, multidimensional framework for measuring R&D performance in a public research centre is proposed and a set of Key Performance Indicators is developed, suggesting implications for academics and practitioners.\n\n[IMSS in numbers. Evaluation of the performance of health institutions in Mexico, 2004].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe evaluation of health institutions performance in Mexico during 2004 was done using 29 indicators that describe intra-hospital mortality rates, productivity of health services, availability of health resources, quality of care, security, investment and costs of health care and the satisfaction level by users of health services. This exercise describes the efficiency and organization of health services provided by the different health institutions and allows comparing and balancing the performance of each institution. Results indicate the differences in availability of resources, inequity in the financing health care services, and inefficiency in the use of resources but also describe the level of efficacy of certain institutions and the satisfaction level that different users have of health services. The evaluation of the performance of the entire health institutions should provide the means to improve all the process of health care and to increase the quality of care in all health institutions in the country.\n\nFree Market Institutions and FDI Performance in Emerging Asian Economies\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVogiatzoglou Klimis\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper examines long-term developments in the quality and efficiency of free market institutional systems across thirteen emerging economies from South, South-east, and East Asia over the 1995â2014 period. The paper also empirically assesses the impact of free market institutions on a countryâs inward foreign direct investment (FDI performance. We find that the free market institutional framework in most economies is still relatively inefficient, restrictive, and underdeveloped but has, nevertheless, substantially improved during the last twenty-year period. Our empirical results also indicate that a free market institutional system in a host-country is a factor that attracts inward FDI to emerging Asian economies by multinational companies. Consequently, policy makers should focus on further improving the quality of free market institutions.\n\nImproving Organisational Performance through knowledge management : The case of Financial Institutions in Uganda\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nBagorogoza, J.; de Waal, A.; van den Herik, H.J.; van de Walle, B.A.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nPurpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the knowledge management practices of financial institutions in Uganda, in order to understand how these practices influence the high performance organisation factors and thereby the performance of the financial institutions.\n\nInstitutional factors as criteria for business environment identification\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKlovienÄ, Lina\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe paper focuses on the analysis of business environment in the context of performance measurement.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the performance of the UCITS investment funds in Croatia and to detect relatively homogeneous groups among the UCITS funds based on its performance. The analysis includes 55 UCITS, in the period from the beginning of 2011 until the end of 2014, and it is conducted on daily data of share prices, available from Bloomberg terminal. Analysis is performed separately within the groups of different investment fund by investment strategy. The research methodology is based on the calculation of various indicators of absolute and relative risk-adjusted performance and riskiness of the funds. In general, based on analysis of performance measures, it can be concluded that funds with higher values of net assets were more successful compared to the funds with below-average asset values. Also, funds with below-average values of net assets were more volatile. At the same time, funds run by foreign own management companies were more successful by the absolute performance measures, compared to funds run by management companies with domestic ownership. On the other hand, those funds were more volatile, as well.\n\nStrategic Approach for Optimizing of Zakah Institution Performance: Customer Relationship Management\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEstu Widarwati\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Zakah is part of the Indonesian economy, which requires the development and structuring.

Following the advice of Thiel and Leeuw (2002, we focus on the incentives created by the institutional environment of these agencies. The core of this environment is a double principal-agent relationship between the European Commission (EC, the national government and the Managing Authority. We investigate its institutional features and the resulting organisational incentives for Managing Authorities in Hungary. Relying on programme evaluations, we explore how these incentives actually affected the design and use of performance measurement by Authorities in two policy fields: active labour-market policy and higher education. We find that external incentives to focus on absorption and formal compliance created bias against integrating performance measurement into the policy process and tackling problems of performance risk and non-measurability.\n\nDirect assessment as a measure of institutional effectiveness in a dental hygiene distance education program.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOlmsted, Jodi L\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThis ten-year, longitudinal examination of a dental hygiene distance education (DE) program considered student performance on standard benchmark assessments as direct measures of institutional effectiveness. The aim of the study was to determine if students face-to-face in a classroom with an instructor performed differently from their counterparts in a DE program, taking courses through the alternative delivery system of synchronous interactive television (ITV). This study used students' grade point averages and National Board Dental Hygiene Examination scores to assess the impact of ITV on student learning, filling a crucial gap in current evidence. The study's research population consisted of 189 students who graduated from one dental hygiene program between 1997 and 2006. One hundred percent of the institution's data files for these students were used: 117 students were face-to-face with the instructor, and seventy-two received instruction through the ITV system. The results showed that, from a year-by-year perspective, no statistically significant performance differences were apparent between the two student groups when t-tests were used for data analysis. The DE system examined was considered effective for delivering education if similar performance outcomes were the evaluation criteria used for assessment.\n\nDo institutions, ownership, exporting and competition explain firm performance?\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nCommander, S.; Å vejnar, Jan\n\n-, Ä. 65 (2008), s. 1-73 ISSN N Institutional research plan: CEZ:AV0Z70850503 Keywords : firm performance * ownership * competition * export Subject RIV: AH - Economics http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/60636/4/IPC-working%20paper-065-CommanderSvejnar.pdf\n\nInstitutional Forecasting: The Performance of Thin Virtual Stock Markets\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nG.H. van Bruggen (Gerrit); M.

The majority of the current studies focus on the Environmental Kuznets Curve and the level of economic growth. This paper addresses this question by relating environmental (âEnvironmental Performance Indexâ to macroeconomic (Gross Domestic Product per capita, âOpen Markets Indexâ and governance indicators (âWorldwide Governance Indicatorsâ. The sample consists of 75 countries, including all G20 and EU members, comprising âmore than 90% of global trade and investmentâ. Findings show that the Environmental Performance Index is positively correlated to each of the (institutional indicators, so as to confirm that the selected indices are consistent with previous studies, suggesting that environmental performance increases in line with economic development and that good governance increases a countryâs levels of environmental protection. By applying factor analysis, an empirical model of the Environmental Performance Index is estimated, suggesting that there is a significant positive correlation between a countryâs economic growth, the openness of an economy, high levels of effective governance, and its environmental performance.\n\nA photographic method to measure food item intake. Validation in geriatric institutions.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPouyet, Virginie; Cuvelier, GÃ©rard; Benattar, Linda; Giboreau, AgnÃ¨s\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFrom both a clinical and research perspective, measuring food intake is an important issue in geriatric institutions. However, weighing food in this context can be complex, particularly when the items remaining on a plate (side dish, meat or fish and sauce) need to be weighed separately following consumption. A method based on photography that involves taking photographs after a meal to determine food intake consequently seems to be a good alternative. This method enables the storage of raw data so that unhurried analyses can be performed to distinguish the food items present in the images. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to validate a photographic method to measure food intake in terms of differentiating food item intake in the context of a geriatric institution. Sixty-six elderly residents took part in this study, which was performed in four French nursing homes. Four dishes of standardized portions were offered to the residents during 16 different lunchtimes. Three non-trained assessors then independently estimated both the total and specific food item intakes of the participants using images of their plates taken after the meal (photographic method) and a reference image of one plate taken before the meal. Total food intakes were also recorded by weighing the food. To test the reliability of the photographic method, agreements between different assessors and agreements among various estimates made by the same assessor were evaluated. To test the accuracy and specificity of this method, food intake estimates for the four dishes were compared with the food intakes determined using the weighed food method. To illustrate the added value of the photographic method, food consumption differences between the dishes were explained by investigating the intakes of specific food items. Although they were not specifically trained for this purpose, the results demonstrated that the assessor estimates agreed between assessors and among various estimates made by the same\n\nComposite Measures of Health Care Provider Performance: A Description of Approaches\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShwartz, Michael; Restuccia, Joseph D; Rosen, Amy K\n\n2015-01-01\n\nContext Since the Institute of Medicineâs 2001 report Crossing the Quality Chasm, there has been a rapid proliferation of quality measures used in quality-monitoring, provider-profiling, and pay-for-performance (P4P) programs. Although individual performance measures are useful for identifying specific processes and outcomes for improvement and tracking progress, they do not easily provide an accessible overview of performance. Composite measures aggregate individual performance measures into a summary score. By reducing the amount of data that must be processed, they facilitate (1) benchmarking of an organizationâs performance, encouraging quality improvement initiatives to match performance against high-performing organizations, and (2) profiling and P4P programs based on an organizationâs overall performance. Methods We describe different approaches to creating composite measures, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and provide examples of their use. Findings The major issues in creating composite measures are (1) whether to aggregate measures at the patient level through all-or-none approaches or the facility level, using one of the several possible weighting schemes; (2) when combining measures on different scales, how to rescale measures (using z scores, range percentages, ranks, or 5-star categorizations); and (3) whether to use shrinkage estimators, which increase precision by smoothing rates from smaller facilities but also decrease transparency. Conclusions Because provider rankings and rewards under P4P programs may be sensitive to both context and the data, careful analysis is warranted before deciding to implement a particular method. A better understanding of both when and where to use composite measures and the incentives created by composite measures are likely to be important areas of research as the use of composite measures grows.

Background:\\tA disproportionate number of departmental and faculty productivity indices in higher education rely solely on research. Productivity in other areas of faculty workload areas, like teaching and institutional and community service, are either measured separately or ignored all together â even when those activities are institutionally mandated. This does a disservice to those who work in those institutions and skews incentives. Methodology: This paper utilizes a unified methodology inclusive of the three primary areas of faculty responsibility (teaching, research, and service to calculate depart-mental productivity in five disparate departments (English, Biology, Mathematics, Sociology, and Computer Science common to two universities with differing missions (teaching and service. Findings: The results reveal the bias inherent in relying solely on research as a proxy for overall productivity in institutions that have differing missions. Recommendations for Practitioners: Utilizing better metrics informs higher education administrators, promotes better decision-making, and allows incentives to re-align with desired outcomes. Recommendation for Researchers: This paper recommends combing all aspects of faculty workload into a single benchmark index to better measure departmental productivity. Future Research: Further research into improving this simple index is warranted and would include how to account for quality and other facets of productivity.\n\nTU-G-BRD-05: Results From Multi-Institutional Measurements with An Anthropomorphic Spine Phantom\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMolineu, A; Hernandez, N; Alvarez, P; Followill, D\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose: To analyze the results from an anthropomorphic spine phantom used for credentialing institutions for National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored clinical trial. Methods: An anthropomorphic phantom that contains left and right lungs, a heart, an esophagus, spinal cord, bony material and a PTV was sent to institutions wishing to be credentialed for NCI trials. The PTV holds 4 TLD and radiochromic film in the axial and sagittal planes. The heart holds one TLD. Institutions created IMRT plans to cover â¥90% of the PTV with 6 Gy and limit the cord dose to <0.35cc receiving 3.75 Gy and <1.2cc receiving 2.63 Gy. They were instructed to treat the phantom as they would a patient, including making plan specific IMRT/SBRT QA measurements before treatment. The TLD results in the PTV were required to be within Â±7% of the plan dose. A gamma calculation was performed using the film results and the submitted DICOM plan. â¥85% of the analyzed region was required to pass a 5%/3 mm criteria. Results: 176 institutions irradiated the spine phantom for a total of 255 results. The pass rate was 73% (187 irradiations) overall. 44 irradiations failed only the gamma criteria, 2 failed only the dose criteria and 22 failed both. The most used planning systems were Eclipse (116) and Pinnacle (52) and they had pass rates of 76% and 71%, respectively. The AAA algorithm had a pass rate of 77% while superposition type algorithms had a 71% pass rate. The average TLD measurement to institution calculation ratio was 0.99 (0.04 std dev.). The average percent pixels passing the gamma criteria for films was 89% (12% std dev.) Conclusion: Results show that this phantom is an important part of credentialing and that we have room for improvement in IMRT/SBRT spine treatments.

Organizational performance is measured by different methods, both quantitative and qualitative. Many of the known methods for the evaluation and measurement of organizational performance take into account only financial indicators, while ignoring the non-financial ones. The integration of both indicators, through the combined application of multiple methods and the comparison of their results, should provide a more complete and objective picture of organizational performance. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP is a formal framework for solving complex decision-making problems, as well as a systemic procedure for the hierarchical presentation of the problem elements. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA is a non-parametric approach based on linear programming, which allows for the calculation of the efficiency of decision-making units within a group of organizations. The work is an illustration of the method and framework of the combined use of the multi-criteria analysis methods for the measurement and evaluation of the performance of higher education institutions in the Republic of Serbia. The advantages of this approach are reflected in overcoming the shortcomings of a partial application of the AHP and the DEA methods by utilizing a new, hybrid, DEAHP (Data Envelopment Analytic Hierarchy Process method. Performance evaluation through an integrated application of the AHP and the DEA methods provides more objective results and more reliable solutions to the observed problem, thus creating a valuable information base for high-quality strategic decision making in higher education institutions, both at the national level and at the level of individual institutions.\n\nManaging Resources and Relations in Higher Education Institutions: A Framework for Understanding Performance Improvement\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHo, Sophia Shi-Huei; Peng, Michael Yao-Ping\n\n2016-01-01\n\nChanges in social systems demonstrate that various structural disadvantages have jointly led to increasing competition among higher education institutions (HEIs) in many countries, especially Taiwan.

Students` satisfaction is influenced by the degree to which higher education institutions meet or exceed their expectations. Higher education managers in general and business higher education managers in particular need to determine the students` level of satisfaction in order to assess their performance. This, however, is difficult to achieve because satisfaction is an abstract concept and no clear consensus exists over its definition and measurement. Although, on account of education`s complexity and peculiarities, the investigation of satisfaction with educational services has been laborious, the literature review reveals a growing number of papers dealing with this issue. These papers consider the factors affecting satisfaction mostly as individual coefficients and ignore the latent relationships between constructs. However, since the determinants of partial student satisfaction simultaneously manifest in the overall satisfaction, it may be considered that an individual approach to them, would partially cover the issue being studied. For this reason, the purpose of this paper is to develop a model for measuring student satisfaction with business education services, a model which should be approached holistically and whose latent structure should be taken into account. The proposed measurement tool, based on the study of the literature, was tested on the students of a business educational institution and the results confirm the goodness-of-fit, reliability and validity of the model. The developed tool encompasses a number of factors that allow the assessment of student satisfaction with a wide range of services provided by business education institutions and relate to: educational process (syllabus, training of teaching staff, examination policy, administrative staff, admission\n\nPerformance measurement and insurance liabilities\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nPlantinga, A; Huijgen, C\n\n2001-01-01\n\nIn this article, the authors develop an attribution framework for evaluating the investment performance of institutional investors such as insurance companies.

The study of empathy and its role in companies is important because it is not yet widely known the benefits that can provide to any institution. The study attempt to show a full mediating role of empathy in this relationship. The sample consist onÂ 69 work teams, from 7 Small -and Medium- sized Enterprises (SMEs including 4 educational institutions and 3 institutions of medical services from Spain. The Interclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC1 and ICC2 and the Average Deviation Index (ADM(J supports data aggregation at the team level. The results using SEM, through work teams, supported the hypothesis, that is, the empathy plays a full mediating role between transformational leadership and excellent team performance. Finally, theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.\n\nEvaluation of Individual and Aggregate Credit Institutions Managementâs Performance\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNicolae Dardac\n\n2008-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Data Envelopment Analysis method allows both the measurement of the relative efficiency of an homogenous group of credit institutions, and the identification of those banking activityâs components generating a state of inefficiency. The present study focuses on this last issue, by proposing an interpretation of inefficiency signals and by strengthening the major role played by the credit institutionâs executive board in designing a viable, coherent business strategy and in defining its risk profile.DEA method places all the efficient credit institutions on the efficiency frontier, without allowing their differentiation. In order to exceed this limit, we have analysed and compared two ranking techniques. The results obtained suggest that the hierarchy generated by the two techniques hasnât changed significantly for almost 60% of our sample of credit institutions.\n\nPerformance Measurement und Environmental Performance Measurement\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSturm, Anke\n\n2000-01-01\n\nDie Zielsetzung der vorliegenden Dissertationsschrift besteht in der Entwicklung einer systematisierten Vorgehensweise, eines Controllingmodells, zur unternehmensinternen Umweltleistungsmessung.

Based on institutional theory, we anticipate higher performance through emulating successful strategies or through restructuring consistent with mimetic isomorphism. Conversely, coercive isomorphism results from restructuring driven by regulation, and we anticipate that they are associated with lower performance. To examine these relationships, we consider divestment by South African firms over two periods, using mixed methods. We find tentative support for our predictions,Â and we outline implications for policymakers, as well as for management research and practice.\n\nH-Index of Astrophysicists at Raman Research Institute: Performance of Different Calculators\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMeera, B. M.; Manjunath, M.\n\n2012-08-01\n\nH-index, a single number proposed by J. E. Hirsch in 2005 has gained popularity as an index number to measure the research performance of individuals, institutions, universities, etc. There are many calculators to derive the h-in dex number, such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, etc. However, h-index can be calculated manually, provided we have access to a complete list of publications of a scientist and the number of citations received by them. It is observed that h-index for a given scientist at a ny given point of time differs from one calculator to the other. Here is an attempt to calculate the H-index of scientists of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Group at Raman Research Institute using Google Scholar Free calculator, Web of Science Paid calculator and The SAO/NASA As trophysics Data System manual calculation and comparison of the results. Application of this h- index phenomenon to the research output of RRI scientists in a group is done while keeping in mi nd Hirsch's systematic in vestigation to predict the position of a scientist using h-index in physics. It is believed that the higher the academic age of a scientist, the higher will be the h-index. An attempt is made to find whether this assumption is true with respect to the sample studied by including the superannuated scientists from Astronomy and Astrophysics Group at Raman Research Institute under the purview of this study.\n\nStrategic Measures of Teacher Performance\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMilanowski, Anthony\n\n2011-01-01\n\nManaging the human capital in education requires measuring teacher performance.
