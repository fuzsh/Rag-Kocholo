        "text": "Abstract\n\nOur society emphasizes the importance of mathematics and science in our life success. However, intelligence isn’t confined to such areas and different intelligence give out different influence to our success. The paper focuses on two quotients. Intelligence Quotient(IQ) and Emotional Quotient(EQ) are the two. They define the potential of the person differently. Intelligence quotient determines our potential through how good are we at processing information and how good we are at learning. Emotional quotient determines our potential on how well we relate to others and how good our social skills are. Currently, researchers say that our EQ tells more about our successful life. We need an education that can teach us both IQ and EQ and other areas we may be neglecting. Holistic education deals with eight areas and education lead us to develop ourselves as a whole.\n\nKeywords: Intelligence Quotient(IQ), Emotional Quotient(EQ), Holistic education\n\nIQ&EQ and Holistic Education\n\nWhat do you think influences your success more between IQ(Intelligence Quotient) and EQ(Emotional Quotient)? People think differently about this matter but I’m sure that more people think that IQ has more influence on the matter. Our education focuses more on it and our society has also put more importance on Mathematical skills and Science skills rather than Emotional skills and Arts. However, the limit of focusing only on the intellectual skills has been shown in our society and people have been more recognizing the importance of developing emotional skills. Holistic education, on the other hand, introduces a new kind of education where we develop not only IQ and EQ but more.\n\nIQ\n\nWhat is an IQ\n\nIQ is an acronym for Intelligence Quotient. IQ describes one’s intelligence level in the means of number. It is measured by taking an intelligence test. It was first developed by a French psychologist Alfred Binet. With Theodore, the two developed the first intelligence test, known as Binet-Simon scale today. Later, it was improved by many psychologists such as Lewis Terman, David Weschler and more (Mcfadden, 2017). IQ tests mostly measure the aspects of visual-spatial processing and auditory processing as well as memory and processing speed (Kaufman, 2014). IQ is calculated in two ways. Firstly, IQ is calculated by multiplying 100 to mental age divided by chronological age. Secondly, IQ is calculated by comparing scores against the scores of others in the individual’s same age group (Cherry, 2018).\n\nAverage IQ. The average IQ is known to be 100. Scores between 85 and 115 are also considered average. Nearly 68% of test takers are in this interval. However, if more precisely described, scores between 85 and 100 is considered average and scores between 100 and 115 is considered above average (Free IQ-test.net, n.d).\n\nHigh IQ. Then what is considered a high IQ? Scores between 115 and 129 iare considered high intelligence. 13.6 percent of the test takers are in this interval. Scores between 130 and 144 are considered superior intelligence. Only 2.1 percent of the test takers are in this interval. People with scores between 145 and 159 are less than 1 percent of the test takers and they are considered to be exceptionally gifted and are called genius. Lastly, people with IQ over than 160 are considered to be an extraordinary genius (Free IQ-test.net, n.d).\n\nAlbert Einstein. When asked to name genius people, Albert Einstein would be named from most of the people. He is known to have an IQ between 160 and 190. He has discovered the theory of relativity, the theory of stimulated emission and has received the Noble prize in 1921 for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. His discoveries are currently used in GPS navigators, barcodes and solar panels (Sanjuanbenito, n.d).\n\nPhilip Emeagwali. Known as the “Bill Gates of Africa”, He has an IQ of 190. He has invented a formula that allows supercomputers to perform calculations per second (iamdrhork, 2017). His discovery is used in weather forecasting today and is also used to predict the likelihood and effects of future global warming. He also developed ways of making oil fields more productive which has resulted in the United States saving hundreds of millions of dollars each year (Famous Black inventors, n.d).\n\nKim Ung-Young. Born in South Korea he is known to have an IQ of 210. He was fluent in four languages by the age of three. He went to study at the University of Colorado at the age of 8 and after graduation, he went to work for the NASA. However, he doesn’t recall his childhood as good memories. He later says his life in NASA was horrible and he comes back to Korea at the age of 16. He then lives an ordinary life, which is depicted as a failed life of a genius to others. However, he gives his thoughts that “Being special is not as important as living an ordinary life” (MessageToEagle,2015).\n\nEQ\n\nWhat is an EQ\n\nEQ is an acronym for Emotional Quotient. EQ is a measure of one’s emotional intelligence. It refers to a person’s ability to perceive, control, identify and express emotion. Howard Gardner says that our EQ is the level of our ability to understand people, what motivates them and how to work cooperatively with them. EQ is measured through EQ tests. There are five major categories of EQ. The five categories are self-awareness, self-management, motivation, empathy, and social communication (Bressert, 2018).\n\nAverage EQ or Normal EQ. The average EQ score ranges from 90 to 100, with a perfect score measuring 160. EQ can be developed throughout life unlike IQ which typically remains the same. EQ can be learned and practiced which helps develop our emotional intelligence. Continuing to understand people and your emotions and putting efforts on empathizing helps develop your EQ (Frameworks, n.d).\n\nMy EQ. I took a simple EQ test online in https://www.arealme.com/eq/en/. I scored a hundred which is an average. I also took another test on a Korean website and I scored 57 over a hundred and I was above average. The average was 40 in the second test. While taking the test I recognized that I was good at relating to other people’s feelings. I noticed that I was also doing fine at motivating myself and being self-aware of my emotions. It doesn’t mean that I’m perfect in those parts. I recognized that I was self-aware but lacked self-confidence and that I do motivate myself and set goals but I lack constancy. But I realized that I really lacked social skills. I was really poor on communicating, as in delivering my message clearly and I also wasn’t really sure of what attitudes should I take in situations that I don’t usually go through. I also lacked in self-regulation. I could control my emotions from being exposed but I wasn’t good enough to keep the emotions I do not want from coming out. I believe that I should practice EQ by dealing with different people in different situations. Writing a journal about my good traits and the feelings I’ve felt the day, how and why it came out and also about the goals I have every day will help me understand my emotions and have more self-confidence.\n\nThe difference between IQ and EQ.\n\nIQ measures one’s intelligence while EQ measures one’s emotional ability. IQ focuses on abilities such as visual and spatial processing, knowledge of the world, reasoning, and memory. On the other hand, EQ focuses on abilities such as identifying emotions, relating to others, perceiving how others feel and communicating with others socially. Another difference is that EQ is more highly developable than IQ. People say that IQ is an inborn intelligence while EQ is an acquired intelligence. IQ and EQ are both elements of success but they differ in how they influence success. Cherry(2018) suggests that people with high IQ tend to be better at studies at school and tend to be healthier. However, people with high EQ tend to have better leadership and have better management skills and better results at work. IQ more likely influences success in school while EQ influences success in life (Surbhi, 2016).\n\nHolistic Education\n\nWhat is Holistic Education\n\nHolistic education is a philosophy of education based on the premise that each person finds their identity, meaning, and purpose in life through community, to the natural world, and to humanitarian values such as compassion and peace. The aim of holistic education is to call forth from people an intrinsic reverence for life and passionate love of learning(Owen, 2011). Cambridge dictionary defines holistic as an adjective that means dealing with or treating the whole of something or someone and not just the part. Therefore, holistic education implies an education that does not only deal with intelligence or emotional intelligence but that deals with every aspect of ourselves as a whole (teachnology, n.d). Holistic education mainly focuses on eight aspects. The eight aspects are core academics, emotional development, critical thinking, conflict resolution skills, character formation, healthy social skills, manners, and hands-on lessons (Bhandari, 2017). The concepts of IQ and EQ seem to be finely incorporated in holistic education and more widely treated in this education.\n\nThe Importance of Holistic Education. Unlike current education, holistic education help children learn what they need to learn and what they want to learn. The education focuses on children’s interest and the learning pace of each student(Holistic Education, n.d). The education we are at the moment mainly happens in our mental area. However, holistic education focuses on each part of the person and is known to be lead by our higher self (Till, 2011). Another advantage of holistic education is that it broadens and deepens the educational process. This helps the students comprehend better and learn to find answers on their own. This education also enhances the student’s social skills and attitude toward life and studies that are substantial when living in the modern world.\n\nAreas that I lack in holistic education. There are eight areas of holistic education and I believe I lack in all of those areas. But if given a chance to develop some areas I would develop my critical thinking and social skills. I think that if I would develop these two areas, I would be able to deal better in situations that I encounter. In my opinion, to develop these two skills I should read many books, put myself in new situations and learn about social skills through older people who have had more experience than me.\n\nConclusion\n\nLearning about EQ and IQ as well as holistic education made me realize that I’ve been so focused on studying school subjects for my grade and that I’ve been neglecting other areas that should be developed for my life. I realized that I lacked in many areas and that I should develop myself as a whole. Writing this paper also made me think once more about my priorities in studying and my goal in life. I’ve learned that IQ isn’t everything and EQ is more important and we can aim higher by applying holistic education to our lives. Holistic education is actually one of the ideologies of Sahmyook University, however, I do not believe that their ideology is well-applied to our education. I think that offering the best quality of class to the students and opening classes that teach manners and classes that enhance creativity and emotions would help produce more well-rounded and that would function better in the workplace. Removing the scoring system and extending extra-curricular activities and classes would also be a good idea.\n\nReferences\n\nBhandari, D. (2017). The importance of holistic education.

People learn at school that the earth is a globe and has seen pictures of round earth. Every person would have had a globe in their classrooms. However, currently, there are people who believe that earth is actually flat. They have their proofs that prove that the earth is flat and there are ongoing researches and experiments to prove it.\n\nCognitive dissonance\n\nDefinition\n\nCognitive dissonance is a state when there are conflicting attitude, behavior, and beliefs and it brings a feeling of disturbance. Psychologist Leon Festinger first proposed the theory of Cognitive dissonance centered on how people try to reach inner consistency. When dissonance occurs, they either change the belief or their behavior or add new information to eliminate dissonance (Cherry, 2018; McLeod, 2018). However, people are more likely to change their belief than their behavior. So, for me, it just seems like people justifying their actions for comfort.\n\nExamples of Cognitive Dissonance\n\nThe most common example people use to explain cognitive dissonance is a situation where the smoker smokes and knows that smoking leads to cancer and is bad for health. The smoker’s behavior(smoking) collides with. his belief(smoking is bad) and to avoid dissonance and discomfort the smoker makes some changes to his original belief. He may say that because he exercises regularly smoking isn’t bad for him. He may also give more importance to researches about denying the relationship between smoking and health (McLeod, 2018). I’ve encountered cognitive dissonance in my daily life. It usually occurs when I eat junk foods. I’ve learned that junk foods are bad for my health and body. Even so, I keep eating junk foods but think to myself that I should be happy when I live and that’s what’s important. Another cognitive dissonance I’ve encountered was when I’ve learned that my birthday wasn’t the day I was born. I’ve learned the truth when I was 18 and it felt really weird. My mom wanted me to change the day we celebrate my birthday but I decided not to change. I thought to myself that as I’ve celebrated it on the same day for 18 years it’s my real birthday no matter when I was really born.\n\nWhat 21st Century Skills come to play when experiencing any kind of cognitive dissonance.\n\nI think when we experience any kind of cognitive dissonance, flexibility and critical thinking come to play. Especially, when we encounter a new belief in contrary to the beliefs we had, we try to eliminate the dissonance by analyzing and interpreting the new information and deciding whether to change one’s belief or not. We also try to make reasons on why the original belief is right and the new one isn’t. Even though, we mostly stick to our original beliefs we sometimes do change our behavior and belief so flexibility skill also seems to be used.\n\nThe Shape of the Earth\n\nThe History\n\nBefore scientist discovered about sphere earth, people believed that the earth was flat (Esiegel, 2011). Around B.C 500, Pythagoras first proposed that the earth was round. Around B.C 350, Aristotle declared that the earth was a sphere. Alexandria philosopher Eratosthenes later in B.C 240, even estimated the size of the Earth (Starchild authors, 2003). It was confirmed in the 1500s when Magellan circumnavigated the globe (Moshakis, 2018). In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published a book about the Copernican system, which is a model of the solar system centered on the sun and planets and earth revolving around it (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica, 2017). And with these information and new proofs through developed technology, people believed that the earth was a spinning globe. However, Samuel Birley Rowbotham born in 1816 believed that the earth was flat, unlike the ordinary beliefs.\n\nHe became the father of the Flat Earth movement and published a Zetetic Astronomy: Earth Not A Globe (The Flat Earth Society, n.d).\n\nFlat Earth\n\nThe earth that flat-earthers describe is a form of a disk with Antarctica ice wall around the edge and North pole in the center. They believe that what early scientists found about the earth being round can’t be taken seriously as they lacked the technology to prove them. They also do not believe the pictures of the earth taken by NASA and believe that NASA photoshops the pictures and videos to make the people keep on believing the Earth is flat. Flat-earthers explain that gravity exists in a greatly diminished form compared to what is commonly taught. They claim that the earth accelerates constantly 32 miles an hour and that’s what keeps us to the ground (The Flat Earth Wiki, n.d). Earth’s day and night cycle are explained by positing that the sun and moon are spheres measuring 32 miles (51 kilometers) that move in circles 3,000 miles (4,828 km) above the plane of the Earth. The sun in the flat earth model moves in circles around the North pole and that makes the day and night cycle and seasons (Wolchover & Live Science staff, 2017).\n\n5 Different Proofs of Flat Earth\n\nFlat-earthers have many explanations for why the earth is flat. However, this paper will introduce only 5 proofs.\n\nThe horizon appears to be flat.\n\nThe horizon appears to be 360 degrees flat to the observer regardless of the altitude. This wouldn’t be possible if the earth was a round ball of 25,000 miles in circumference. If so, the horizon would be noticeably curved even at sea-level, and disappearance of objects the further they go would be noticed as they lean away from us (HillaryWP,2016; Horizon Distance Proves Flat Earth?, n.d).\n\nNon-changing View of Stars. If we were living in a globe earth we wouldn’t be able to see the constant non-changing view of the stars and constellations. The experiment name known as “Airy’s Failure” proved that the stars move relatively to stationary earth rather than the other way around. The experiment was done by filling the telescope with some water to slow down the speed of light, and calculating the tilt needed to get the starlight directly to the tube (HillaryWP, 2016; Non-changing view of Stars prove flat earth, n.d).\n\nShip captains’ navigation. Plane sailing and Great Circle sailing, the most popular navigating methods, both use plane trigonometry, making all calculations assuming the earth is flat. There haven’t been any mistakes through the navigation which shows that the assumption of the captains’ is right (HillaryWP, 2016).\n\nWater consistently remains level. The natural physics of water is to find and maintain its level. Therefore, if the earth was tilted and spinning the flat level surface of the water would not exist. If the earth was a globe, due to the curvature there would be a massive bulge of water in the oceans. However, it remains level because the earth is flat (HillaryWP, 2016).\n\nThe ray of the Sun. The sun is actually a lot closer than what we thought. If it was really millions of mile away the rays would come in vertically. However, the sun rays that we observe everyday comes in forming a triangle. If the earth was flat and the sun was only a few thousand miles away and 32 miles across. To add, we can see hot spots directly underneath the sun proving that it is very close (HillaryWP, 2016).\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen I first heard about the flat earth, all I could think of was who would be foolish enough to think so. However, as I researched I found out about their proofs and the reasons why they think so. They had their logical reasons and that made me think once more about their theory. I’ve also researched about the reasons why the earth is round and why the flat-earthers are wrong. With these two research, I didn’t change my mind about the shape of the earth. I may be wrong but as I’ve lived my whole life believing the earth is a sphere, it isn’t easy to change my original belief. But I’ve learned another lesson through the flat earth theory. I’ve realized that I’ve never questioned my beliefs. They may be right or wrong but I didn’t try to figure out the truth. Questioning the shape of the earth may be seen as foolish just like asking if one plus one equals two, but never questioning why and just absorbing the information people provide seems much more foolish and dangerous.\n\nReferences\n\nCherry, K.

He was a hedge fund analyst before starting the Khan academy. The Khan academy which started with YouTube videos is now a large website being sponsored by many companies such as Google, and Microsoft. The tutoring videos in the website are divided into 8 courses such as math, math by grade, science, and engineering, computing, arts and humanities, economics and finance, test preps and college, careers and more. The tutorial videos encourage ‘Flipped learning’, where the student learns the basic lessons at home and improve the knowledge at school. Students are encouraged to be active in school hours in a ‘Flipped classroom’.\n\nSalman Khan\n\npicture retrieved from the siasat daily\n\nNowadays, flipped learning has become a hit in Korea education. When we talk about flipped learning we can’t help but mention Salman Khan the founder of Kahn Academy. This academy provides free online education to everyone and dreams for education that is available to everyone, anytime, anywhere. We’ve always agreed that we should change education systems which haven’t changed even a bit in so many years. Salman Khan has made the change and revolution is currently occurring in education.\n\nEarly life and family situations\n\nSalman Khan was born in New Orleans, Louisana on October 11, 1976, to Fakhrul Amin Khan and Masuda Khan. His parents were immigrants. His mother was born in India and his father was born in Bangladesh (Salman Khan, 2014). His mother raised him as a single mother and he just assumed he would not be able to afford a top four-year university. However, when his sister applied to college, he realized that he could go to his choice of college by scholarships (College admissions, 2014).\n\nEducation\n\nKhan attended public schools in Metairie, Louisiana, and graduated Louisiana, Grace King High School as a valedictorian. He then went to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), where he thought he could thrive the most (Fink, n.d). He studied mathematics, engineering, and computer science. After graduating from MIT, Khan went to Harvard Business school and earned a Master of Business Administration.\n\nCareer\n\nKhan was an intern at PARC (Palo Alto Research Center Incorporated) in 2002 and after graduating Harvard he worked as a hedge fund analyst at Connective Capital Management from 2003 to late 2008. In 2009, he founded the Khan Academy (Fink, n.d).\n\nKhan Academy\n\npicture retrieved from The Kahn Academy\n\nKhan Academy was started by Salman Khan when he started tutoring his cousins by phone and interactive notepad in 2005. He started making videos for his cousins and posted them on YouTube in 2006. The videos went viral and people started commenting on how those videos helped them learn (TED, 2011). His wife encouraged him to quit his job and focus on achieving his vision. So he quit his job as a financial analyst in 2009 and started the Khan Academy. Khan Academy received the Microsoft Tech Award for education in late 2009. Salman Khan had some struggles at first financially. However, he started getting donations from many different people and companies, including the Microsoft and Google in 2010 (High, 2014). Now, Khan Academy is a website worth 210 million with more than 59 million registered users in 190 countries including Bill gates (IBM, 2018).\n\nTutorial Videos in Khan Academy. https://www.khanacademy.org/ is the link to Khan Academy. When we go there we can find videos divided into 8 courses. The courses are math, math by grade, science and engineering, computing, arts and humanities, economics and finance, test preps, and college, careers and more. I have registered for some of the tutorial videos and they are organic chemistry, health and medicine, and computer programming. The videos are uploaded on YouTube and when you study a lesson through the website the video comes up and you can comment below about things you want to ask. After watching the video, they provide you with some exercises to make sure you’ve understood it correctly. So I’ve tried to count the videos in Khan Academy channel on youtube and there were about 1879 videos in the Khan Academy channel. There were 9 other Khan academy channels which means that if we estimate the videos in each channel to be about a thousand there are over 9000 videos in Khan Academy.\n\nFlipped Classroom. Khan Academy encourages the ‘Flipped Classroom’. The idea of ‘Flipped Learning’ started in the 1990s by Harvard professor Eric Mazur who developed a model of ‘peer instruction’. The idea was popularized in the mid-2000s by Salman Khan and two chemistry teachers Jon Bergman and Aaron Sams. The flipped classroom is one where students are required to learn about the lesson outside the classroom and come to school and do workouts and do exercises related to the video they’ve watched. Pre-learning the lesson is done in many ways such as watching pre-recorded videos or reading or researching and depends on the teacher. The main goal in flipping a class is to increase the time the teacher and the student interact and cultivate deeper, richer learning experiences for students. In traditional classrooms, teachers stand in front and talk and the students listen and are given homework to do at home. However, in flipped classrooms teachers interact with students one on one and use the time to check where each student needs help and find out how to make the students understand the concept better. Students change from being passive to active in flipped classroom. They have to participate, and they can use the class time to supplement what they’ve learned. Khan Academy is used in some schools and the website has a program that helps teachers see how their students are doing. They offer tools like dashboard and you can find more information in this video. https://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education?\n\nConclusion\n\nI’m a Korean student who was developed in an environment where you are fed with information without knowing if you are eating the right thing or if you’ve digested it fully. I might not get used to a new education system. However, I believe education needs innovation for future generations. Salman Khan says that Khan academy expects failure but mastery as well. I have studied for more than 12 years now but I don’t remember what I’ve learned, and I don’t believe I have mastered anything especially in middle school and high school. Just learning what teachers teach and just memorizing without fully understanding hasn’t helped me develop any skills to learn new things on my own. Salman Khan has done wonderful things, and I think he has given hope to students and has given more opportunities to learn. Neither, Kahn academy nor the flipped classroom might be the perfect answer for better education for everyone, but I think they’re definitely worth a try.\n\nReferences\n\nCollege Admissions.

The 12 skills are divided into three categories. The learning skills, literature skills, and life skills. Learning skills are also known as the four C’s, literacy skills are also known as IMT skills and life skills are also known as FLIPS. Each skill takes part in our life and there are skills that are improved currently in our education whereas there are skills that aren’t. the paper also introduces how to improve skills that I lack on.\n\n21st Century Skills\n\nThe century has changed, and the skills needed for success have changed too. Just as how machines changed the skills needed, the growth of knowledge and technology has changed the skills for success. No longer is memorizing facts and relying only on what we’ve learned at school is possible but catching up and applying new technology and information on your own and creating something out of it is needed. The skills needed for this century are called 21st century skills. The Assessment and Teaching of 21st Century Skills project was made by Cisco, Intel, and Microsoft and was showed to the world in 2009 at a World Forum held in London (Binkley et al, 2010). Students are given new standards to adapt to this exponentially growing society.\n\npictures from https://education.microsoft.com/Story/Lesson?token=mlZJz\n\nAll about 21st century skills\n\n21st century skills also known as P21 is consisted of 12 skills divided into 3 categories. They are divided into learning skills, literature skills, and life skills. Learning skills are also known as the four C’s. The four C’s are Critical thinking, Creativity, Communication, and Collaboration skills. Literacy skills also called IMT skills are information literacy, media literacy, and, technology literacy. Life skills also known as FLIPS are flexibility, leadership, initiative, productivity, and social skills (What are 21st century skills?, n.d ).\n\nLearning skills\n\nThe Four C’s are skills that are required in workplaces as well as for your studying in the future. The American corporation reported that companies want employees with the four learning skills (What are 21st century skills?, n.d).\n\nCritical thinking. Firstly, critical thinking is related to problem-solving and discovering the answer to one’s question. Therefore, critical thinking helps one to learn, discover and have purposeful thoughts (What are the 4 C’s of 21st century skills?, n.d).\n\nCreativity. Creativity is about thinking outside the box. They become unafraid of breaking the rules or thinking differently from the convention demands (Applied, n.d). Students need to think outside in both digital and nondigital environments in the 21st century to be able to develop their best solution (Crockett, 2016). Furthermore, developing one’s creativity encourages one to realize who one is and what one is capable of.\n\nCollaboration. Collaboration means getting together for a greater good. Learning to collaborate is essential as when one works in a company, one would have a common goal to achieve as a team. To add, collaboration is needed when business is done worldwide. Therefore, collaborating isn’t limited offline but extends to online as well (Crockett, 2016).\n\nCommunication. Lastly, communication is a term that incorporates interaction and sharing information (What are the 4 C’s of 21st century skills?, n.d). Sharing what you know and don’t know, expressing oneself clearly and being able to convey one’s idea is what makes communication important. According to a paper written by Binkley et al (2010), distinguished critical thinking and creativity as ways of thinking and collaboration and communication as ways of working.\n\nLiteracy skills (IMT)\n\nInformation literacy, media literacy, and technology literacy are the three literacy skills. These skills are tools for working in the 21st century (Binkley et al, 2010). Furthermore, as information is flooding online, these skills become more crucial. We should be able to understand what to information is saying, where the information came from and who created the information. Through these skills, we would be able to distinguish credible sources from those that aren’t and be able to consume and produce information (What are literacy skills?, n.d).\n\nInformation literacy. Information literacy is more about understanding the facts, figures, and data. It also includes the process of separating facts from fiction.\n\nMedia literacy. Media literacy is about identifying publishing methods, outlets, and sources. Students will learn which media formats to believe and how to find sources and what to believe.\n\nTechnology literacy. Technology literacy is about understanding how each gadget and technology works and learning how to use them. Unable to do so may keep you from adapting to society.\n\nLife skills\n\nLife skills are important when working but it also important in managing your career as well as your personal life.\n\nFlexibility. Flexibility is about recognizing you might be wrong and searching for better plans each time. It also prepares you to change when change is needed.\n\nLeadership. Leadership is about making everyone cooperative and getting the best out of each person for a better outcome. Leadership is needed in your personal life and in your job, as you would have to lead a group in your job or you would be a part of a team to accomplish a common goal and learning leadership would teach you how to lead as well as how to follow.\n\nThe initiative. The initiative requires students to be self-starters (What are 21st century skills?, n.d). When working, we need to develop a fine-tuned initiative. In our working places, people won’t be guiding us about what to do all the time. We have to find what to do on our own and start doing it.\n\nProductivity. Productivity is about getting the best out of our work and may also be about efficiency. Time is limited, and we should learn how to use it best.\n\nSocial skills. Social skills are about interacting with people around as well as meeting new people and working with them. Etiquette, manners, politeness and small talk are basic skills that enhance social skills. We need social skills when meeting and coexisting with people and without these skills, we may have a hard time when working and, in every situation, in meeting people and interacting with them.\n\nWhat skills did I develop in my middle and high school education?\n\nI believe that I have developed some in my middle and high school years. But I hardly think they were developed via classes. Most of the classes were done by teachers teaching us about the subject out front and us listening in the back. So even though we would learn about something we wouldn’t be able to develop the skills as we wouldn’t practice them. I think I’ve developed communicating, collaborating, initiative, social skills by interacting with friends and being in school. The one class I believe that influenced me is my middle school P.E class. We had to learn new sports and were divided into teams and played sport together. Our P.E teacher always revised the game rules so that we would be able to play the game more easily and find the sports more entertaining. P.E class has developed my collaborating skills and shown what creative thinking is. Being a vice president of the class helped me develop leadership and communication skills and doing club activities and participating in group competitions lead me to be more active\n\nWhat skills am I developing in my University classes?\n\nI think I am developing my information literacy skills, media literacy skills, production and flexibility skills through all my classes in the University. Most of my classes have assignments and group projects. My English class, for example, assigns me with every new topic to write in APA format every two weeks. My other classes have group presentation assignments where we have to research and write an essay about it and make a presentation in class. Researching the topics develops my literacy skills, finding the information and judging the credibility of each source. Leading the projects develops my flexibility and as I have limited time, I try to be more productive. Most of my classes are still more about memorizing and processing the things my professor is saying. However, I shouldn’t keep relying only on classes but should teach myself and develop the skills I lack from now on.\n\nWhat skills to improve.\n\nI feel that I lack in so many skills. I do not think that I have achieved anything fully. I wish to improve every skill. But improving all of them may not be possible at once. Therefore, as I study to become a nurse. I would first improve the skills I need in the future. If I become a nurse, I think I would need critical thinking, communication, collaboration, information literacy, and all the life skills. It doesn’t mean others are not needed but these are the ones that should be prioritized.\n\nHow to improve the skills.\n\nI lack accepting information, processing the information as well as solving problems in life. I believe that my critical thinking and information literacy may be improved by reading more books and newspapers. I will develop my communication and collaboration by participating in classes and club activities. I would do more volunteering, be more motivated, and have a part-time job to improve my life skills. Most of all I would keep in mind the skills I lack and remind myself to improve.\n\nConclusion\n\n21st Century skills opened my mind about education. I realized that I wasn’t studying right. I am not capable of learning new things without being a student in a classroom and I am not used to finding answers on my own. To become a nurse and a versatile person, I dream to become, I have to overcome these problems. 21st-Century Skills kind of showed me the way. Korean education should change and for those people who are still taught in the old way, we should at least teach ourselves for our own future.\n\nReferences\n\nBinkley, M. Erstad, O. Herman, J.

Especially freshmen like me have fantasies about our first college vacation. I made big and specific plans for my vacation and they included reviewing all the things I’ve learned the first semester, going on a trip, hanging out with my high school friends, reading plenty of books, and plenty more. I did some of the things that I had planned but I have some regrets for not doing everything and for not spending my time more efficiently.\n\nGood Memories\n\nHanging out with Friends\n\nIt had been about two to three months since I had met my friends. So the first thing I did when I went back to Daejeon was meeting my friends. I met Cynthia first who was in Daejeon too. We went to Dosol mountain which is near our house and went up and came down to the other side. It was such a hot day so we decided to eat blue lemonade bingsu (a korean term for a dessert with milk ice flakes and various toppings). We still didn’t want to say goodbye so we headed to Megabox to watch a movie. On our way there we met our other high school friends and even met our former classmates when we were juniors, in the cinema. We watched ocean 8 and went back home. From that day, we hung out every other day. Sometimes on our own and sometimes with some of our other friends like Yubin, Jinkyung, Seulgi, and Sungmin. We mostly went to PC cafes, restaurants, the library and boardgame cafes where we played board games and read webtoon books all day. It was really fun and we could feel that everyone had matured and changed a little bit after a semester in college but knew for sure that we were still the same ‘us’.\n\nGoing on a Trip\n\nHitchhiking in 7th national highway. I planned to go on a trip with my ACT church family and the concept of the trip was being hungry and penniless, and the name of the trip was ‘ACT Marble’. We planned to move from Gosung to Gangreung on the first day, Gangreung to Uljin on the second day, Uljin to Kyeongju on the third day, Kyeoungju to Busan on the fourth day and going back to Daejeon on the fifth day. We were 20 people and we divided ourselves into five groups and were given ten thousand won per person each day. We stayed in churches except when we stayed in the house of the trip leader’s girlfriends’ parent. The first day and the second day were the most memorable. On the first day, only our group decided to go to the unification observatory. We had to walk about 3 kilometers to go to the place where you register to go in. So we walked and walked and talked and tried to hitchhike a car but failed. But a military truck, passing by, stopped and gave us a ride to our destination. But when we got there we were informed that we can’t enter without a vehicle. So we decided to divide into two’s and ask for a ride in and out. Me and my partner asked a married couple and they said yes. We talked about how they got here and they told us about their lives. After we got back we contacted the other two and they said that a man who was traveling alone helped them out and that he was willing to give us a tour and a ride to Gangreung. We were so amazed at this news and couldn’t believe that things like this happened. So the man took us to different spots that were really beautiful and even gave us food and everything. He told his story to us and it was really interesting. We traveled with him until 7 pm and said goodbye. Saying goodbye wasn’t easy because we had so much bonding and had such a great time. He was like our new friendly uncle. The remaining four days were like this too. We met great people and they all had their own life stories to tell. Interacting with them was the best part of this travel. Experiencing people and extraordinary events really made the trip unforgettable. I made so many memories and I became closer to my church family.\n\nSokcho trip. The friends I stayed in the Philippines with when I was in grade 6 are all college students now and I thought that this vacation would be an excellent timing to go on a trip just like before. So we decided to go to Sokcho and Naksan beach. We booked two nights in a hotel nearby the beach. And decided to meet in Sokcho terminal before going to the beach. We were really excited because it has been around 6 years since we’ve spent time together and it just felt like the good old times. For two nights and three days we swam, ate, walked around, took pictures but mostly we spent time in our rooms talking and chilling. We felt so good and we could feel that we hadn’t changed a bit. We nagged each other with the same things and we had the same habits and the same interests just like before. Those three days were just so good and it was really memorable.\n\nRegrets\n\nWasting time\n\nAs I’ve said earlier I had planned to review all the things I learned and also read many books. I also planned to study Microsoft Excels and PowerPoint. However, that didn’t go well. I became so lazy that after all my trips and hanging out with friends, I just stayed home and relaxed watching TV and using my phone. I really felt guilty all through the vacation, whenever I behaved that way. I really thought to myself that I waste my time all the time and that I won’t be able to develop myself at all if I keep behaving this way. At the end of my vacation, I thought about how I could’ve spent it. I thought I should’ve started a part-time job or had a daily activity to do, without any exceptions. That would have made me feel how each day flies. I couldn’t feel time flowing and it became August all of a sudden and my vacation ended.\n\nGoal settings\n\nIn retrospect, I still have achieved some of the plans I set. I think that I might have wasted my time more if I hadn’t made any plans or goals for the summer. Goal setting helps people analyze what they want for the future and helps one make their plans. It gives one more motivation and gives the person a standard to judge how efficiently and effectively time is spent. So goal setting is not only important when you have important events but also in daily life. Making specific goals is important. Making vague and grandiose goals may discourage people from achieving their goals before starting. So better to make them specific and achievable. Making achievable goals helps make plans on how to achieve them and helps the person to keep in check with his goals. It doesn’t mean that we should only make goals that are small but it means that we should make goals that we know for sure how to achieve it and know that we are capable of achieving it. After spending my vacation something came to my mind and it’s that setting goals is one thing but achieving them another. In my opinion, to better achieve goals we should write them all down and write down the cons of achieving the goals. We should also write down how to achieve them. For example, if your goal is to become good at English, you should write down memorizing 50 words a day, making 15 sentences a day and reading one English book a week. Once you’ve written them all down you should allocate time to each plan and lastly, you should stop making excuses and just start.\n\nReflecting on myself through this writing, made me realize how much more I could’ve done during my summer vacation. I did have a lot of fun and made good memories but I had more goals and plans. I think I made too many goals that I was tired before even I started. So as my summer vacation is over now, I’ll try to set specific and achievable goals for this semester and make plans and goals for the next vacation but this time as achievable as possible. I hope I won’t be full of regrets this time.\n\nHoward Gardner and His Theory of Multiple Intelligences\n\nHow do people define their own knowledge and intelligence? Howard Gardner introduces eight intelligences. With Howard Gardner’s theory, we would be able to define the intelligences we have and be able to develop them.\n\nHoward Gardner\n\nHoward Gardner was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania in 1943. He graduated from Harvard where he had Erik Erikson who developed the 8 stages of psychosocial development as a tutor. He entered Harvard’s doctoral programme in 1966, and in 1967 he became a part of the Project Zero research team on arts education. This project helped him explore his interest in human cognition. The following event which was the establishment of the Project on human potential resulted in ‘Frames of Mind’ (1983) which is Howard Gardner’s first statement of his theory of multiple intelligences (Smith, 2002, 2008).\n\nMultiple Intelligences\n\nHoward Gardner has introduced eight intelligences overall. He says that our schools focus mostly on two or three intelligences only. However, he believes that we should give equal attention to the other intelligences too. He suggests that the classrooms should be able to teach the students according to their most highly developed intelligence (Armstrong, n.d). Gardner also suggests that a person is strong in a specific area while possessing a range of other abilities too. Then now let’s see each intelligence and it’s characteristics.\n\n-picture retrieved from gardenschool journal\n\nVerbal-Linguistic Intelligence\n\nVerbal-Linguistic intelligence refers to the ability to analyze information and ability to produce work related to language (Edutopia, 2013). Linguistic intelligent people are most likely to enjoy reading and writing, be good at debating and remembering written and spoken information and be good at explaining things (Cherry, 2018). Memorizing and using outrageous words, reading books and essays, story-telling and doing crossword puzzles will help develop our linguistic intelligence (Hine, n.d). This intelligence would excel in tasks involved with writing or speaking. Therefore this intelligence is evident in poets, novelists, journalists and public speakers (Vital, 2014).\n\nLogical-mathematical intelligence\n\nLogical-mathematical intelligence refers to ability to develop equations, make calculations, and solve abstract problems (Edutopia, 2013). Logical -mathematical intelligent people are most likely to enjoy thinking about abstract ideas, like conducting scientific experiments and be good at solving complex computations (Cherry, 2018). Playing pattern games, practicing socratic questioning and using symbols and formulas will help develop our logical-mathematical intelligence (Hine, n.d). This intelligence would excel in tasks involved with logical thinking. Therefore this intelligence is evident in mathematicians, prorammers, and detectives (Vital, 2014).\n\nMusical intelligence\n\nMusical intelligence refers to abiliy to produce and analyze music and recognize different types of sound (Edutopia, 2013). Musical intelligent people are most likely to enjoy listening to music, composing, singing, playing musical instruments, be good at remembering melodies and understanding music (Cherry, 2018). Listening and seeing musical performances, using musical instrument and composing music are some of the activities that can help develop musical intelligence (Edutopia, n.d)). This intelligence would of course excel in tasks involved anything with music like rhythm, melodies and note. Therefore this intelligence is evident in singers, conductors and composers (Vital, 2014).\n\nBodily-kinesthetic Intelligence\n\nBodily-kinesthetic intelligence refers to the ability to use one’s body (Edutopia, 2013). The body means from head to toe and the ability to use your fingers meticulously is also an example of bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. Bodily-kinesthetic intelligent people are most likely to be good at dancing and sports, be excellent at physical coordination and enjoy creating things (Cherry, 2018). Role-playing, miming, playing sports and doing physical exercises are some of the activities that can help develop bodily-kinesthetic intelligence (Hine, n.d). This intelligence shows excellence in tasks involving anything with body movements, body coordination, and acting. Therefore this intelligence is evident in athletes, dancers, surgeons, and craftspeople (Vital, 2014).\n\nVisual-Spatial Intelligence\n\nVisual-Spatial intelligence refers to the ability to visualize things (Edutopia, 2013) and the ability to recreate and redefine the space (Hoerr, 2000). I personally think that visual-spatial intelligence is related to everything that involves seeing and perceiving the space around you. Visual-spatial intelligent people are most likely to be good at putting puzzles, be good at interpreting graphs and maps, enjoy drawing and visual arts and easily recognize new and familiar patterns and space (Cherry, 2018). Drawing the environment around, playing with patterns, mind-mapping and taking pictures are some of the activities that can help develop visual-spatial intelligence (Hine, n.d). This intelligence shows excellence in tasks involving visualization and space. Therefore this intelligence is evident in architects, pilots, sculptors and craftspeople (Vital, 2014).\n\nNaturalist Intelligence\n\nNaturalist intelligence refers to the ability to connect with nature and the ability to know about the plants, animals, and weather (Edutopia, 2013). Naturalistic intelligent people are most likely to be good at biology and zoology, be good at categorizing and organizing and easily recognize and classify plants and animals (Cherry, 2018). Spending time outdoors, planting trees are some of the activities that can help develop naturalistic intelligence (Hoerr, 2000). This intelligence shows excellence in tasks involving visualization and space. Therefore this intelligence is evident in botanists, chefs and animal rescuers (Vital, 2014).\n\nInterpersonal Intelligence\n\nInterpersonal intelligence refers to the ability to connect to and recognize other people’s mood and feelings and the ability to get along with people (Edutopia, 2013). Interpersonal intelligent people are most likely to be good at communicating, be good at resolving conflict in a group and be able to see situations in different aspects (Cherry, 2018). Group projects and peer teaching are some tips that can help develop interpersonal intelligence (Hoerr, 2000). This intelligence shows excellence in relationships and people. Therefore this intelligence is evident in teachers, social workers, and politicians (Vital, 2014).\n\nIntrapersonal Intelligence\n\nIntrapersonal intelligence refers to the ability to connect to and recognize other people’s mood and feelings and the ability to get along with people (Edutopia, 2013). Intrapersonal intelligent people are most likely to be good at understanding oneself, know well about one’s weaknesses and strengths and have great self-awareness (Cherry, 2018). Group projects and peer teaching are some tips that can help develop intrapersonal intelligence (Hoerr, 2000). This intelligence is all about knowing oneself and one’s feelings. Therefore this intelligence is evident in counselors, philosophers, and psychologists (Vital, 2014).\n\nIntelligence Definition People who exhibit this intelligence linguistic sensitivity to the meaning and order of words Winston Churchill, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Barbara Jordan logical-mathematical the ability to handle chains of reasoning and to recognize patterns and order Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, Benjamin Banneker musical sensitivity to pitch, melody, rhythm and tone Ray Charles, Harry Connick Jr., Carly Simon bodily-kinesthetic the ability to use the body skillfully and handle objects adroitly Mia Hamm, Michael Jordan, Michelle Kwan spatial the ability to perceive the world accurately and to recreate or transform aspects of that world Mary Engelbreit, Maya Lin, Frank Lloyd Wright naturalist the ability to recognize and classify the numerous species, the flora and fauna, of an environment Charles Darwin, Jane Goodall, George Meriwether Lewis interpersonal the ability to understand people and relationships Colin Powell, Martin Luther King Jr., Deborah Tannen intrapersonal access to one’s emotional life as a means to understand oneself and others Anne Frank, Bill Moyers, Eleanor Roosevelt\n\nThis was retrieved from ASCD and this can help you understand the 8 multiple intelligences and get to know specific people who exhibit the intelligence.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith this information, I’ve tried to think what my most highly developed intelligence is. I feel that my most highly developed intelligence is intrapersonal intelligence and the other intelligences I feel I’m dominant on seems to be interpersonal intelligence and logical-mathematical intelligence. When I learn, I tend to apply the subject to my own situation and I learn better when I study alone. I try to analyze the contents first and try to understand it afterward. With the 3 dominant intelligence, I believe I would be a good nurse or a counselor.\n\nReferences\n\nArmstrong, T. (n.d). Multiple intelligences.

Trying to achieve and accomplish many things at once, and having various things to do make our minds focus on more than two things and wander around one from another. Being able to fully relish the moment and focus on what’s happening seems to be missing in our daily lives. It doesn’t seem like a bad idea to bring the idea of mindfulness back to our society.\n\nWhat is “Mindfulness”\n\nAccording to Cambridge dictionary, “Mindfulness” is the practice of being aware of your body, mind, and feelings in the present moment and is thought to create a feeling of calmness. “Mindfulness “ means living in the present and fully attending to the things around. Being aware of what you are doing and what’s happening without judgment or without being overly emotional and reactive to what’s going on around you is “Mindfulness” as well (stock, 2017).\n\nWhat are the benefits of “Mindfulness”?\n\nMindfulness has many advantages in many ways. Firstly, “Mindfulness” brings changes to our brain. In a youtube video by Asap Science (2015) suggests that when we meditate brain scans show increased activity in regions correlated with decreased anxiety, depression as well as increased pain tolerance. Default Mode Network improves memory, goal setting, and self-awareness. This network is known to be activated when our brains are minds are at rest.\n\nSecondly, “Mindfulness” reduces stress. A study on present-moment awareness performed by Donald, Atkins, Parker, Christie, & Ryan (2016) found that “Mindfulness” helps cope with daily stressors by facilitating adaptive response (as cited in Ackerman, 2017). Researchers Grégoire and Lachance (2015) found that call center employees who took part in a brief mindfulness intervention experienced less stress, anxiety and fatigue than before and greater satisfaction at work (as cited in Ackerman, 2017).\n\nThirdly, “Mindfulness” helps boost immunity. A study published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine found out that eight weeks of meditation increases antibody levels. There’s no exact explanation for this but I think that the positive energy of focusing on the present moment strengthens our body (Borreli, 2016).\n\nHow does one achieve “Mindfulness”?\n\nOne can achieve “Mindfulness” anywhere anytime you want. The staff of Mindful blog (2017) suggests 6 steps to achieve “Mindfulness” and gives out tips for “Mindfulness”. The six steps are: “Take a seat”, “Set a time limit”, “Notice your body”, “Feel your body”, “Notice when your mind has wandered” and “Be kind to your wandering mind”. The mind wanders off inevitably but when it does we shouldn’t judge or be obsessed with the fact that it wandered. We should just calmly bring back our mind to the present consciously. This routine will be done repeatedly and we just have to bring back our mind repeatedly too.\n\nCan “Mindfulness” be practiced alongside any religion?\n\nI think that “Mindfulness” can be practiced alongside Buddhism. A Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh is famous for using “Mindfulness” to find fulfillment in life. He also recommends “Mindfulness” because it helps one become aware of one’s negative emotions and helps clear one’s mind. (The Power Of Ideas, 2017). ’The Buddha taught meditation as an essential tool to achieve liberation from suffering” says in a Buddhist blog Lion’s Roar (2017). And through this “Mindfulness” seems to be a part of Buddhism now which helps meditate and cultivate good traits.\n\nWhat are the drawbacks of practicing “Mindfulness”?\n\nThere may be some drawbacks when we practice “Mindfulness”. “Mindfulness” may lead one to be indifferent to things around. “Mindfulness” is about reacting to things less overwhelmingly. But people may understand that “Mindfulness” is about being numb and dull to things around (Belot,2015). Furthermore, In a study published in Psychological Science, the author team led by psychologist Brent Wilson found that after a 15-minute “Mindfulness” induction, participants showed more likeliness to form false memories than other participants who practiced. Mind-wandering. And the authors concluded that practicing “mindfulness”, may lead to people’s reality-monitoring accuracy impair that increases the perceptibility to false memories (Dholakia, 2016).\n\nConclusion\n\nI daydream and think about things unrelated to the thing I was focusing often. I sometimes find myself waking up from some thoughts and become confused on what kind of situation I was in. So I believe that “Mindfulness” can benefit me by helping me fully be involved in the present. Practicing “Mindfulness” every morning after I wake up will help me focus on daily tasks and help me think about the day I’m going to live. I would just have to wake up 10 minutes earlier than my usual schedule. I think “Mindfulness” can help people have a peaceful mind and give someone a habit to think and concentrate about a thing at a time. I think that “Mindfulness” is needed and is a good thing to practice but I don’t think it’s a must.\n\nReferences\n\nAckerman, C. (2017).

Multitasking involves performing multiple tasks in succession and switching back and forth from one task from another (Gaille, 2015). People feel the need to do multitasking due to the expectation to work on multiple tasks at the same time that leads one to feel the need to be efficient and flexible (Gardner, 2014).\n\nPros of multitasking\n\nFirstly, multitasking keeps resilience against distractions. When we concentrate only on the multiple tasks that we have to do, even though distractions come we would be so focus on those tasks that we won’t be distracted by them (Gaille, 2015). Secondly, multitasking helps one make use of time. Doing one task repeatedly will make one lose focus and get bored. Instead of just keeping on doing a task with less concentration, shifting from one task to another will help one keep focused on one’s tasks. Korean students are usually taught to shift subjects when one cannot concentrate. It is known to help students save time. Shifting to another task when the task is stuck and unable to move on helps utilize time and prevent downtime (Gardner, 2014). Thirdly, multitasking creates a habit of adaptation. Adapting to a different and new environment is a sequence of analyzing the situation and what has changed, figuring out what to do and the right solution for oneself. To multitask we have to evaluate the tasks that needs to be done and decide which tasks to do simultaneously or in succession. With every new task that needs to be done improvement occurs on what task to do and through this repetition of analyzing and deciding, one can develop the habit of adaptation (Gaille, 2015).\n\nStudies about multitasking\n\nPeople multitask tasks with media a lot. A study on media usage and integration of auditory information and visual information was published in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review. Participants from nineteen to twenty-eight answered questionnaires about their media usage. Then their ability to integrate two sources of sensory search was evaluated through simple experiments. The test results showed that heavy media users were better adept at integrating auditory information with visual information (Cherry, 2018).\n\nCons of multitasking\n\nFirstly, we aren’t actually multitasking when we multitask. We feel like we are multitasking but actually, we can’t give our attention to two tasks simultaneously. Our attention is just like a battery that when we work on something the work takes most of our attention and there’s not much left for other tasks (Macmillan, 2016). Secondly, multitasking keeps us from doing our tasks. Multitasking makes us feel that we can finish our tasks in a short time. So when we have to do something we are more likely to procrastinate when we multitask. Multitasking makes us feel we’ve done a lot due to repeated switching tasks. This may hinder us from doing the tasks we have planned to do for a day but make us feel not bad about it (Gaille, 2015).\n\nStudies about multitasking\n\nStudies about multitasking with multi-tasking friendly technologies. People multitask using cell phones or notebooks Information and communication technologies (ICT) with other tasks and a study done by Junco and Cotten found out the relationship between multitasking and academic results. Their study has found out that students that use ICT while studying impacts the capacity for cognitive processing and deeper learning negatively that results in lower overall Grade Point Average (GPA) (Junco & Cotten, 2011). A study between laptop use and lectures was done and the results showed that students with open laptop had a gradual decrease in their memories of the lecture (Hembrooke & Gay, 2003). Furthermore, study at London’s King’s College says that constant exposure to e-mails and other ICTs lowers IQ by 10 points (Gardner, 2014).\n\nStudies about how multitasking affects productivity. Experts estimate that switching between tasks can cause a 40 percent loss on productivity (Macmillan, 2016, par 6). Switching between tasks can make gaps between and it can take time for adjustment. These reasons decrease the productivity. In a 2009 study by a researcher in Stanford University suggests that heavy multitaskers have a hard time sorting out relevant information from irrelevant details and that they have difficulties switching from one task to another and were more mentally unorganized (Cherry, 2018).\n\nConclusion\n\nI really love relaxing and having no stress at all. My pursuit of relaxation and stress-free life makes me multitask. I relax when I watch movies or when I listen to music. So whenever I do something I tend to listen to music or watch short movies and videos. To avoid stress, I try to switch the task I was doing to a new task that I suddenly remember even though the new task can be done later. This kind of multitasking hinders me from completing my tasks as fast as possible which always makes me pressed for time. Multitasking also keeps me from doing important things because multitasking little tasks makes me feel as if I’ve done a lot regardless of what I’ve done. So to eliminate distractions that take me “off task”, I should be able to decide what my number one task is and plan what to do next and try to control my thoughts and emotions to be able to focus on the tasks I have to do. I didn’t have much thoughts about multitasking. But after writing and learning about multitasking I think I should try not to multitask when doing my important tasks such as studying or spending time with people I love. Multitasking doesn’t seem like a good working habit but multitasking listening to music and walking still seems like a good idea to me. So I should restrain myself from multitasking but I should still leave some flexibility.\n\nReferences\n\nCherry. (2018). Very Wellmind. https://www.verywellmind.com/\n\nGaille.

TED is an abbreviation of Technology Entertainment and Design but TED video handles almost every topics. So if we want to learn more about certain things, watching TED videos would be a great help. Three TED videos will be introduced in this essay.\n\nDo Schools Kill Creativity\n\nThe speaker of this video is Ken Robinson, who is a British educationalist. He is also an author, speaker and international advisor on education in the arts, education and arts bodies. He believes that all children are full of creativity, but becomes educated out of it. They are educated to be afraid of mistakes. Then, he gives out his thoughts about the problems of education that keeps creativity away. He first mentions the hierarchy of subjects. Mostly Mathematics and languages are at the top and art is at the bottom of the hierarchy of subjects. The reason this hierarchy system is used is based on two ideas. The first idea is that the most useful subjects for jobs are treated importantly. The second idea is that the education system is based on an academic level, which is designed by the universities. This system is highly unfavorable to others who have talents on other subjects or other aspects rather than what the universities prefer. They get to think that they aren’t talented or brilliant because what they were good at wasn’tvalued and were stigmatized at school.\n\nNow, academic inflation is happening and the structure of education is shifting. Ken says that we should radically rethink of intelligence. He introduces us to his thoughts about intelligence. Firstly, it is diverse. Secondly, it is dynamic. Thirdly, it is distinct. Ken says that the only hope for the future is seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are.\n\nWhat I’ve learned from this video is that I may have not been appreciating my talent and intelligence enough just because they aren’t related to academical achievements. I thought that for a better education for everyone we should be appreciating every talent for their own and stop deciding on our own which intelligence or talent is more important than other.\n\nThe Child-driven Education\n\nThis video is spoken by Education scientist Sugata Mitra. Sugata Mitra is a professor of educational technology at the school of education, communication and language sciences at New Castle university and is best known for his “Hole in the wall” experiment. In this video, he talks about the solutions he had found out about a problem found everywhere.\n\nEvery country has places where teachers aren’t enough. And places where there aren’t the best environment for students as well as teachers. Sugata mitra has tried experiments to address this problem. First, he embedded computers on the walls in New Delhi and left them without anything else. The children in New Delhi didn’t know English or internet at all but soon a boy was seen teaching somebody how to browse. In central India, within 4 hours of seeing the computer for the first time children recorded their own music. These experiments proved that children can learn what they want to learn on their own and that they can learn how to use the computer and internet by themselves no matter where they were and what they know. After all these experiments Mitra decided to try other experiments to find out how much the children can learn from a computer on their own. He asked the children in Hyeradad, India who had very strong Telegu accent to make themselves understood to the computer which had a speech to text interface. When he came back two months later their accents had changed and spoke a neutral British accent. Furthermore, Mitra decided to question if Tamil speaking students can teach themselves Biotechnology in English on their own. After two months they had become teachers of one another and achieved a higher grade. Furthermore, another two months with a granny effect which is encouraging one when one does something regarded to biotechnology made them achieve 20 percent higher than before. Mitra has also found out in an experiment that students that discuss while learning have more photographic recall than students that just learn on their own. Based on all these experiments he created Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE). Mitra thinks that if we can just afford SOLEs to every child on earth the problem would be solved and that children would be able to learn everything.\n\nI’ve felt that SOLE can be a great help and a great approach to children who aren’t able to get the education they need and be a great help for students who would like to learn new things that school cannot teach or would like to learn more about what they are interested in. But I also thought that this may give students the burden to have the urge to learn everything because everything is available. I think things might be different if it’s only up to students what they would learn but for now, I think that SOLE is a really effective learning device but may have some negative aspects.\n\nHow to connect with depressed friends\n\nThe speaker Bill Bernat is a recovering addict who advocates for mental health awareness through speaking, comedy, and storytelling. World Health Organization (WHO) says that depression is the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide affecting more than 350million people. The speaker says that depression doesn’t take the desire of one to connect with other people but just the ability to do so. So it may seem hard to talk with a depressed person but actually, it ain’t hard. He also talks about why we try to avoid depressed people. It is because we are worried that we might be depressed too, we also get worried that we should take care of the depressed person’s welfare. Also, we might be scared because we have prejudice that they are different from us. But Bernat tells us that depressed people are no different from any other and that there are no certain rules to become one. He then gives out tips about how to relate or how to build a bridge to depressed people. He introduced the ‘Dont’s’ first. Firstly, we shouldn’t ask the depressed people to just get over depression. Depression comes as one cannot get over it by one’s own strength. Secondly, we shouldn’t be hell bent on fixing the depressed people. The pressure to get better can make the depressed person more depressed. Thirdly, we shouldn’t take the negative responses personally. Depressed people may not embrace all the advice that is given. But it’s because they feel there’s no bright future no matter what they do and not because the advice is bad. Nextly, he introduced the ‘Dos’. Firstly, we should talk to the depressed in Natural voice. We should know that it isn’t rude to be upbeat. Secondly, when making an offer you should be clear on what you can do and can’t do. This will help prevent them being disappointed.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe first two TED videos helped me think about current education and gave me new ideas and information about creativity and education. The third video gave me information about how to treat depressed people. As a nursing student, I have to get ready to be a nurse. Nurses are always in the same place with patients and they are more opt to be depressed than other people. Therefore i’ve wanted to learn about how to get along with depressed people and these TED videos helped me know what I want to know.\n\nLimited Time\n\nI’m sure everyone has tried to manage all the tasks they have and would like to do so at the designated time. I too have always desired to do so and have always challenged myself. But unfortunately, I’ve always failed. Now, as a college student, I know how much my time means to me and to my daily life achievements and satisfaction. So I’ve researched some tips for time managing and thought about what I can do differently.\n\nTime Managing Tips\n\nI’ll introduce the tips for “Time Managing.” Firstly, Keep a to-do list. Keeping a to-do List will increase your productivity by 20 percent, and save you energy and time. As you make a list break down large or complex tasks into smaller pieces and cross out one by one. (Chun, n.d , para 5) But, you shouldn’t forget focusing on high-value activities. You should identify the activity with the most positive effect and start with important things first. (Madsen, 2015, para 4) Secondly, related to the first tip Prioritize. Prioritizing will make you an effective person. Some focus on working hard but tend to concentrate on the simple, easy tasks that they forget doing the urgent and important tasks. They may be efficient but not effective. So you should decide what tasks are urgent and important and sort these in order of priority. If you become effective as well as efficient that would be better. To be efficient while effective, you should keep a time log to keep track of how you spend your time and analyze what your interruptions are and how much of your time was wasted (”How To Manage Your Time Efficiently” n.d, paras. 11-12). You should also put good systems in place and take regular breaks. Pomodoro technique is a technique which you divide an hour to two 25 minutes with 5-minute breaks between each period . This technique is known to improve your concentration and longer break after every four Pomodorosbreaks is known to increase focus and efficiency (Chun, n.d, paras. 11-13).\n\nProcrastination and solutions\n\nReading all these tips, they seem to be quite easy to follow but people still aren’t able to manage time as they need to. That’s because of procrastination. Procrastination makes it hard for us to complete tasks and as time managing tips are also a sort of tasks, we fail accomplishing all the habits we should practice for good time management and completing the tasks in the to-do lists. Then why do we procrastinate with our tasks? The reason we procrastinate is due to unpleasant tasks, timing, anxiety, and self- confidence. Unpleasant tasks, self- confidence, and anxiety keep us from starting the tasks. Ainslie(2001) suggests that when present efforts are highly noticeable in comparison with future ones, and are leading individuals to postpone tasks without anticipation when it comes time to do them, the required action will be delayed yet again. (as cited in Heshmat, 2016, par 5) The gap between the impulse and decision also hinders us from starting and doing the tasks. The main solutions were to attain small goals to reach bigger and long-term goals. (Heshmat, 2016, pars.3-7) And, doing the most difficult task which is important too to help reduce anxiety can be done more easily by dividing the projects into subprojects. (“Effective Time Management”, n.d, para 8)\n\nThe Best Six Tips For Me\n\nAmong all the tips I found there were six ones that seem to be important for me. First, keeping a time log. I usually let interruptions bother me that I don’t even know when I was interrupted and when I did things that weren’t planned. If I use a time log, it will make me look back on the day and help me analyze my time. I’ll also be able to see how much time each task took depending on my focus. Second, limit multitasking. I tend to listen to music or watch video clips while studying. It seems that I can have fun and study at the same time at first, instead, I soon realize that I get stressed because of the urge to focus on listening to music or watching clips and the rational thoughts remind me to focus on studying. So rather divide the time to do each thing (Give the main task I must do a bigger portion of the time). I may be able to relish the moment and use it efficiently. Third, stop procrastinating. Even though every day has the same 24 hours I always think that the 24 hours tomorrow will be far longer and so I put off the tasks I have to do today to tomorrow. And I procrastinate again the next day and the next day then it becomes daily. So it’s much better to not procrastinate on the first hand. According to a Ted video spoken by Vaden (2015) , we should dream for a peaceful tomorrow and for that we should start working and stop procrastinating. Fourth, setting clear goals and action planning. Whenever I set goals and work for them, the motivation and passion don’t last long. I think the reason is the lack of clarity in the goals and setting them without plans. If we set the goals we should make them clear and think of how to achieve them and divide them into smaller goals. Fifth, prioritize. Sometimes I focus on the things that don’t need to be done at all or at the moment. The negative aspects of it are that it gives me the notion of satisfaction when I’ve done it, makes me forget all the tasks I should’ve done and feel like I’ve had lived my day doing my best. I may have done my best but to see the results I’ve just wasted my time and energy. Prioritizing makes us know what is important and which tasks should be done. It prevents us from doing unimportant things when there are urgent and important tasks waiting to be done. Sixth, sleep only at night and nap regularly. I usually sleep while studying and it makes the time go fast while I’ve done nothing. It also keeps me from keeping track of time.\n\nConclusion\n\nWriting this essay and thinking about time made me realize that there are reasons why i procrastinate and keep lost of time. As i realized why I procrastinate and learned tips for time managing , I think I would be more cautious with my time from now on. I would put the tips I’ve learned for time managing to action as well.\n\nReferences\n\nHow to manage your time efficiently. (n.d). University Of Kent. Retrieved from https://www.kent.ac.uk/\n\nChun.
