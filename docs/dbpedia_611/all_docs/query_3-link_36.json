Follow the hashtag #SPEAKblackhistory to read about some incredible individuals in the coming weeks and months. #OtisBoykin #InnovativeInventor #ElectricalResistors #PacemakerDevelopment #HealthcareAdvancements #TechnologyInnovator #HumanSafety #GuidedMissiles #ConsumerElectronics #IngenuityInTechnology #LegacyOfInnovation #PioneerInElectronics #InspirationForScientists #EngineeringExcellence #ImprovingHumanity #InventiveGenius #CreativeInnovation #blackhistory365 #blackhistoryeveryday #InventorLegacy #HumanitarianImpact #TalentsAndCreativity #BetteringHumanity #InspiringFutureGenerations #ElectronicsPioneer\n\nAs we celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, tune in throughout February as we honor and share insights from Black inventors and luminaries in the innovation space. We'll share stories and insights from innovators such as Juan Gilbert, FNAI of #NAIMemberInstitution the University of Florida. Dr. Gilbert's work in developing the voting system Prime III tackles the challenge of equity in the voting process by implementing speech support, voice recognition, and text and speech in multiple languages to make voting more accessible. His words of wisdom: \"Set-backs are a part of invention. The best way to recover is to keep going. You evaluate what caused the set-back and then formulate a way forward. Set-backs are just points of information that help me improve the invention.\" ‚ñ∫Read our short interview with Dr. Gilbert in Invention Insider here: https://ow.ly/hu7350Qz9u8 #invention #innovation\n\nRecently, the inspiring details about Dr. Charles Richard Drew - a trailblazer in medical science known for his revolutionary work in blood plasma preservation, came to light. While we hold an immense appreciation for Dr. Drew's monumental contributions to society, his legacy raises an important question: How many undiscovered geniuses are there in the Black community, overlooked by the patent system? Tune into this week's #DrivingDiversity with Elaine Spector, for an in-depth look at the challenges facing Black inventors and the steps we can take to close the inventor gap in the patent ecosystem. Eager to dive deeper into the story and impact of Dr. Drew's innovations, and explore how we can support the next generation of Black inventors?

Studying MDA is always interesting to me. Thank you to Dr. Purwanti for her invaluable collaboration in this study. Her expertise truly enriched our research process. I am also grateful to the editorial board of UGM Rubikon Journal for their excellent feedback and cooperative publication process. Our study delved into the representation of color-based injustice in Dahmer ‚Äì Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story series on Netflix. Through the lens of Multimodal Discourse Analysis approach, specifically the three metafunction framework by Kress and van Leeuwen (2021), this study analysed various semiotic resources presented in the series to address the research problem. This research viewed the series to be a media of raising pubic awareness of black lives matter. Therefore, we expect that this research would contribute to the interaction in multicultural society in which colored people should have equal opportunities. For those interested in this field of study, feel free to access our paper in the Rubikon Journal of UGM through this link https://lnkd.in/g5ZhR5Eg I can't wait for another MDA publication in the near futureüòä\n\nWe are grateful for the vital contributions our African American students, faculty, and staff bring to NIU on a daily basis. The 2024 Black History Month theme is ‚ÄúAfrican Americans and the Arts.‚Äù Did you know African American (AA) art was infused with African, Caribbean, and the Black American lived experiences? In the arenas of visual and performing arts, literature, fashion, folklore, language, film, music, architecture, culinary and other forms of cultural expression, the AA influence has been paramount. AA artists preserve history and community memory as well as for empowerment through their art. Artistic and cultural movements such as the New Negro, Black Arts, Black Renaissance, hip-hop, and Afrofuturism, were led by people of African descent and set the standard for popular trends around the world. In the 1920s and 30s, the rise of the Black Renaissance and New Negro Movement brought the Black Arts to an international stage. Members of the armed forces, such as James Reese Europe, and artists such as Langston Hughes, Josephine Baker and Lois Mailou Jones brought Black culture and Black American aesthetics internationally, and Black culture began its ascent to becoming a dominant cultural movement to the world. In addition to the Harlem Renaissance, today we recognize that cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New Orleans also were home to many Black artists. The 1960s continued these gifts and talents through the cultural evolution known as the Black Arts Movement, where artists covered issues such as pride in one's heritage and established art galleries and museum exhibitions to show their own work, as well as publications such as ‚ÄúBlack Art‚Äù. This period brought us artists such as Alvin Ailey Jr, Judith Jamison, Amiri Baraka, Nikki Giovanni and Sonia Sanchez. This movement would not have been as impactful without the influences from the broader Black world, especially the Negritude movement and the writings of Frantz Fanon.

Our time together seeks to shift the sector by regarding & remembering we are worthy of inhabiting and taking up space that requires, expects, and pushes the need to solve nothing. In this space, at this juncture in our sector-shifting journey, we get to connect, be, explore, laugh, be curious, and rest. NORTH conversation path is designed for Technology Students + IMAGINATION. Join a conversation at soshiftsthesector.com ID: Backdrop is a picture in the cosmos. At center is the word NORTH. The question above it: What does AI Look like when the designer identifies as Black? The question below it: Imagine exploring opportunities and ideas outside of your current conditioning of what is possible. At the bottom of image is \"JOIN THE CONVO\" 2023 Season for SSTS ends in September. If this type of communication speaks to YOU, register to join one or two convos. Hope to see you.\n\nCelebrating Black History Month: Embracing Diversity and Building a More Inclusive Future...
