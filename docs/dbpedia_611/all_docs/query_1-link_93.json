Speaking about the background to the book, Baroness Floella says,”Britain has always been a nation that’s evolved due to different races coming in, from as far back as you can go. I hope Coming to England makes people of colour feel worthy, appreciated and that they belong and that it makes white people say, ‘That could be me, what would it be like if I moved somewhere else?’.”\n\nMaria Isabel Sanchez Vegara\n\n& Pili Aguado\n\nPicturebook\n\nPart of the critically acclaimed Little People, BIG DREAMS series, discover the incredible life of Harriet Tubman, the Underground Railroad conductor who 'never lost a single passenger.'

Discover how a little boy whose father called him \"troublemaker\" grew up to fight apartheid, become South Africa's first black president and campaign for freedom and justice throughout the world. Adapted by poet Chris van Wyk and illustrated by South African artist Paddy Bouma, with an introduction from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Long Walk to Freedom introduces children to the life of one of the world's most beloved leaders.\n\nChildren's Information Books about Black History\n\nDK\n\nNon-fiction\n\nWriter of the foreword, Mireille Harper, loved listening to the empowering stories of inspirational Black People that her mother told her growing up. But where are these people in most mainstream or school history books? Erased, ignored, forgotten, omitted?\n\nThis important book seeks to begin to redress the imbalance in written history, where very often, significant contributions by black men and women have been overlooked and marginalised.\n\nThrough vibrantly designed and graphically stunning double-page timeline spreads, we learn about inspiring, powerful, talented and world-changing figures such as Mansa Musa, Taytu Betul, Mary Seacole and Nelson Mandella. We meet inspirational black men and women from the fields of music, dance, engineering, mathematics, politics and sport, as well as Ancient African rulers and present day activists.\n\nThe journey of the US Civil Rights Movement is portrayed over several pages through the book – from those who spent their lives working to abolish slavery, through to Martin Luther King Junior and today’s activists who continue the fight for Black Lives Matter. We also learn how gifted writers such as Maya Angelou and Stormzy have used their creative voices to highlight injustice and inspire change.\n\nWe travel around the world – from African Empires, to the Caribbean, the USA and the UK – learning about the lives and values of these significant individuals. Each fascinating double page timeline is completely different in design, and through facts, quotes and images, marks key aspects of each person’s life story, shows their success and resilience in the face of adversity and demonstrates their enduring legacy.\n\nK. N. Chimbiri\n\n& Joelle Avelino\n\nNon-fiction\n\nExplore the incredible history of Afro hair. The Story of Afro Hair celebrates the fashion and styles of Afro hair over the last 5,000 years. From plaits to the Gibson Girl, cornrows to locks, the hi-top fade to funki dreds, The Story of Afro Hair is the ultimate book of Afro hairstories. Kicking off with an explanation of how Afro hair type grows and why, The Story of Afro Hair then takes us right back to the politics and fashion of Ancient Egypt. Speeding forwards to modern times we experience the Kingdom of Benin, Henry VIII's court, the enslavement of African peoples, the Harlem Renaissance, the beginnings of Rastafarianism, Britain in the 1980s - and much more. With profiles of inspirational key figures in the Afro hair beauty industry, such as Sara Spencer Washington, Madam CJ Walker, Viola Desmond, Lincoln Dyke, Dudley Dryden and Anthony Wade.\n\nAtinuke\n\n& Mouni Feddag\n\nNon-fiction\n\nThis non-fiction book is British-Nigerian storyteller Atinuke's personal love letter to the African continent, and its 55 countries in all their variety. It divides Africa into five sections: South, East, West, Central and North, each with its own introduction. This is followed by a page per country, containing a delightful mix of friendly, informative text and colourful illustrations.\n\nLania Narjee, The Black Curriculum CIC\n\n& Chanté Timothy\n\nNon-fiction\n\n“Legacies: Black British Pioneers” is an engaging and thought-provoking children’s book by author Lania Narjee and illustrator Chante Timothy, embarking on an inspiring exploration of Black British History. This bold, colourful work tells the stories of the trailblazers, innovators, and champions that have helped shape Britain, many of whom have previously been overlooked in mainstream education. Narjee’s writing harmoniously pairs with Timothy’s vibrant illustrations to bring each figure to life, navigating through four significant domains: The Arts, STEM, Sport, and Politics & Social Justice.\n\nFrom the medical advancements of Dr Cecil Belfield Clark to the ground-breaking music of Evelyn Dove and Arlo Parks, from athletes like Maurice Burton to activists Olive Morris and Claudia Jones, the book weaves a rich tapestry of Black British contribution and achievement in these areas. Contemporary figures such as Stormzy and Marcus Rashford also feature, bridging the past and the present and highlighting the enduring legacy of Black British pioneers.\n\nThe foreword by Lewis Hamilton adds a personal touch to the narrative, further cementing the book’s relevance and connection with today’s world. Aimed at children aged 8 and above, “Legacies: Black British Pioneers” maintains an accessible tone without compromising the depth of its content, presenting the information clearly and in an engaging format to facilitate independent learning and classroom discussions. The book also serves as a catalyst for change and a celebration of Black British heritage. Its empowering message is a stepping stone for children to discover, learn, and be inspired. This book is an invaluable addition to any library, classroom, or personal bookshelf, filling a crucial educational gap and providing a much-needed resource for teachers and students.\n\nDavid Olusoga & Jake Alexander\n\n& Melleny Taylor\n\nNon-fiction\n\nThis new illustrated children’s edition of David Olusoga’s account of Black British history is an essential book for schools – not only as an accessible and informative non-fiction read for KS2, but also as a book that I would thoroughly recommend for improving primary teachers’ own historical subject knowledge and especially those with input into their school’s curriculum design. As expressed perfectly by Lavinya Stennett (CEO of the Black Curriculum) in the Afterword, ‘This book is a testimony to the rich experiences of Black people of Britain in different periods of our history, and a reminder of the dearth of Black history in our curriculums.’\n\nIn the book, Olusoga explains the overlooked history of Black people in Britain from Roman times to the present day. Readers may be surprised to imagine the multiculturally diverse make-up of Roman Britain – and indeed to question why sources of history in primary schools may paint a historically misrepresentative picture of Roman society. Equally interesting is the development of notions of race throughout the periods of history, as the book walks chronologically through key eras. Did you know that it was only during the time of James I that the term ‘white’ was used as a description of racial identity, or that long after the abolition of slavery, the Victorians were propagating their own racist theories to justify profiting from slave-powered commerce?\n\nThe new illustrated version adds an impressive visual element with full-colour illustrations, maps, portrait galleries, timelines, and photographs. This edition makes the history behind the book accessible to a younger audience still and makes for a highly recommendable and informative non-fiction read.\n\nChildren's Chapter Books about Black History\n\nCatherine Johnson\n\nChapter book\n\nCatherine Johnson scooped the Little Rebels Award in 2019 with this short, middle-grade chapter book about the historical horrors of slavery.\n\nThe story follows a young boy called Nat, who is enslaved on a Jamaican plantation. When Nat is brought to England in the 1700s, he hopes to finally find freedom from bondage. Instead, Nat discovers the disappointing truth that slavery is still very much alive in England – and he witnesses the heavy role that Britain plays in operating the slave trade.\n\nLittle Rebels Judge Darren Chetty comments that the story “explores the humanity of those whose humanity was denied through chattel slavery. It subtly examines the similarities and the differences between class oppression and a system of slavery rooted in racism. It tells a story of Britain that continues to be neglected.”\n\nWhile the main character is fictional, the details of the story are very much rooted in historical events and features real-life people and places. We recommend this book as a go-to for upper KS2 classes learning about Britain’s role in the slave trade. Teachers are likely to find very helpful the informative historical notes at the end of the book.\n\nLeila Rasheed\n\nChapter book\n\nEmpire’s End: A Roman Story is part of the VOICES series that celebrates the lives of BAME protagonists during key eras of British history. This book tells the tale of a young North African girl who sets out on a danger-filled journey to Britain during Roman times. This is a gripping adventure that offers a new perspective into the myriad of Roman narratives shared in schools and is full of details that immerse readers in knowledge of life in Roman times. The story helps to develops an understanding of the Roman world as one that was full of many different cultures, religions and ethnicities.\n\nCatherine Johnson\n\n& Katie Hickey\n\nChapter book\n\nThe topic of polar exploration is a popular one in primary schools with teachers and pupils easily being able to reel off a list of famous arctic explorers: Shackleton, Scott, Cook, Peary. But how often do you hear the name Matthew Henson among the list, the man who travelled with Captain Peary and claimed to be the first to reach the North Pole?\n\nIn Race to the Frozen North, best-selling author Catherine Johnson offers a fictionalised retelling of Matthew Henson’s story, including how his achievements were unfairly suppressed for decades because of the colour of his skin. Published in Barrington Stoke’s ‘super-readable’ and dyslexia-friendly style, this is an accessible read for children in KS2.\n\nMichaela Morgan\n\n& Karen Donnelly\n\nChapter book\n\nTully and his brother don't have much. But they do have each other. And Tully has an amazing talent. Football. But when the First World War begins, Tully must fight for respect on the battlefield not the pitch ... Based on the amazing true story of Walter Tull, a First World War hero and one of the first black British professional football players. Particularly suitable for struggling, reluctant or dyslexic readers aged 8+\n\nCatherine Johnson\n\n& Katie Hickey\n\nChapter book Dyslexia-friendly\n\nOlaudah Equiano was cruelly snatched from his home in Essaka, Africa, aged only 11, in 1756. Initially taken with his older sister, Ifeoma, they soon became separated. Olaudah never heard from her again. From there he was taken to England, first enduring a long voyage where he was treated horribly, along with the other slaves. He was sold several times before being taken to America to be a house slave. The master was cruel and the slaves were too scared to even speak to each other. Next he was bought by an English naval officer and taken to sea. Here he finally made friends and began to learn to read and write, as well as experiencing many adventures and great peril.\n\nOlaudah’s story does not end there. He is bought and sold a couple more times before he is taken to the West Indies. Here he sees a chance of freedom. It turns out he has a flair for business and becomes his master’s trusted slave. Working hard, he finally earns enough money to buy his freedom and returns to England as a free man. Here he wrote a book about his experiences and worked hard in the campaign against slavery.\n\nThis is an incredible true story, vividly brought to life by Catherine Johnson. It would be a brilliant addition to any UKS2 or KS3 classroom, especially if studying slavery. A difficult subject matter sensitively brought to life for children.\n\nBenjamin Zephaniah\n\nChapter book\n\n‘I love history. I am history. We made history.’\n\nThis masterpiece is written by Benjamin Zephaniah, and it delivers a powerful story about what it was like to be part of the Windrush Generation. Based on real events of the time, this fictional story features Leonard – a boy who was born in Jamaica and grew up in England.\n\nWe first meet Leonard when he is a child in his native Jamaica, living with his mother and grandmother, surrounded by the sea. The women in his life have instilled a deep sense of his Caribbean heritage and history, teaching him the stories that have verbally been handed down through generations… not the history and songs that have been taught in his school.\n\nLooking for a brighter future for them all, his family respond to the post-war plea from Great Britain, for workers from the Empire to relocate to rebuild a broken country. His father travels first, and Leonard and his mother follow later in 1958. On a cold April morning, they arrive in Southampton – the reception they receive is frosty, in more ways than one. And so begins Leonard’s life in England, and we see how he is treated at school, at work, socially and in his later years too. It is a striking account of how the Windrush Generation were treated throughout the 60s to modern-day atrocities.\n\nAt times, this is a difficult read. How can society continually undervalue people who have given it so much? But it is also an important and powerful read, endorsed by Amnesty International, and would be well-placed in the hands of readers in Upper KS2 and Lower KS3.\n\nPatrice Lawrence\n\nChapter book\n\nPart of the ‘Voices’ series, which celebrates the experiences of BAME figures in British history and written as a first-person narrative, Diver’s Daughter gives a uniquely fascinating perspective into life in Tudor times.\n\nEve, our narrator, and her mother start the story in South London. Eve’s mother was stolen from Mozambique as a child and so the story offers insight into the lives of black families in England during this time, something that is rarely mentioned in either historical fiction or non-fiction texts about the period and something that, in the notes at the back of the book, the author further discusses.\n\nPatrice Lawrence paints a vivid picture of life within the cramped and dirty London streets, which transports the reader into Tudor times. The action moves from London down to the South Coast and brings in the story of the sinking of the Mary Rose, as well as the fascinating lives of the divers who went to search for its treasures.\n\nIt is a gripping story to enjoy, with intrigue and so much suspense, and offers so many opportunities for discussion about the Tudor period. The author has included lots of Tudor vocabulary, which can be investigated within the topic.\n\nThe book would be highly recommended as a class novel or used as a guided reading text within upper KS2, although could also be enjoyed by confident readers within Year Four and Five.\n\nCatherine Johnson\n\nChapter book\n\n1720. Blue Mountains, windward Jamaica. In the sweltering heat Captain Shettlewood leads a troop of British soldiers through the thick trees towards the river. They are hunting slaves who have escaped from the brutal plantations. Their mission: to find them, and kill them. But up ahead, hidden among the rocks above the water, a group of men with cutlasses and muskets wait patiently for the instructions of their leader. Queen Nanny is a 'wise woman' with a reputation for ancient obeah magic, and a guerilla fighter with a genius for organisation. So the battle for Jamaica begins, the First Maroon War, in which the maroons - escaped slaves - will make a final, do-or-die stand against the slavers and soldiers of Empire.\n\nBeverley Naidoo\n\nChapter book\n\nThis thought-provoking novel is set in South Africa in the time of Apartheid. The gripping and empathetic story will draw pupils into engaging imaginatively with what life would have been like for families living during this time of racial segregation. A very popular choice for upper KS2.\n\nIszi Lawrence\n\nChapter book\n\nA riveting pirate tale set in the eighteenth century during the golden age of piracy in the Caribbean, perfect for fans of Emma Carroll and Jacqueline Wilson. It’s 1718: pirate ships sail the oceans and brutal slave masters control the plantations. Eleven-year-old Abigail Buckler lives with her father in the Caribbean. Her clothes are made of finest muslin so she can’t play in them, not that there’s anyone to play with anyway. She isn’t even allowed to go out alone. But when pirates attack Abigail’s life will change forever. Suddenly her old certainties about right and wrong, good and bad start to unravel. Maybe Abigail doesn’t have to be so ladylike after all… Packed with historical detail about the Atlantic slave trade, the ravages of empire and human cost of providing luxuries like sugar, cotton and tobacco to Europe, Blackbeard’s Treasure is a page-turning, swashbuckling adventure which takes a look at the real pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nJ. T. Williams\n\n& Simone Douglas\n\nChapter book\n\nThe first book in the ‘Lizzie and Belle Mysteries’ series sees the young best friends and amateur detectives use their skills to investigate odd goings-on in a theatre, which in turn reveals further mysteries and crimes which they must solve.\n\nSet in Georgian London, this book illuminates the multiracial history of Britain, and the struggles and injustices faced by Black people in a place where many powerful people thrived on keeping slavery alive. It also demonstrates that White people had an important role, as well as responsibility, to offer support to Black anti-slavery activists and to challenge the White slave owners of the time. Many of the characters and events in this book are based on real people and things that happened, and there is a lot of scope to research real stories. The real Elizabeth Sancho was daughter of the African-British writer and abolitionist Ignatius Sancho. Dido Belle was the daughter of Maria, an enslaved young African woman, and John Lindsay – captain in the British Royal Navy.\n\nThis is a fantastic mystery story, which could also lead to discussions about race, theatre, slavery and family history.\n\nAuthor JT Williams also visited our blog to discuss the role of fiction in bringing history to life for children.\n\nChildren's Biography Books Celebrating Black Lives\n\nJamia Wilson\n\n& Andrea Pippins\n\nNon-fiction\n\nThis is an eye-catching anthology that celebrates the inspirational achievements of fifty-two trailblazing black women and men, including artists, sports legends, scientists and activists among many others.

Talk about race is often discouraged, but this book aims to bring everyone into the conversation. It explores the history of race and society, giving context to how racist attitudes come into being. It looks at belonging and identity, the damaging effects of stereotyping and the benefits of positive representation. The authors talk sensitively about how to identify and challenge racism, and how to protect against and stop racist behaviour. Aimed at young people aged 10 and upwards. Part of the groundbreaking and important 'And Other Big Questions' series, which offers balanced and considered views on the big issues we face in the world we live in today.\n\nJordan Akpojaro\n\n& Ashley Evans\n\nNon-fiction\n\nRacism can sometimes be a difficult subject to broach and to discuss in primary schools. Children have perceptive questions that seem to adults, to require rather complex answers. This book seeks to address these questions and open up a forum to enable children to talk about how they feel as well as address possible misconceptions and myths. It provides the teacher or parent with a starting point from which to support children understand an issue that must not be avoided.\n\nThe format is simple: questions under the main headings of the what, why and how of racism and answers provided when you lift the flap. Each page groups together questions under the main headings in order to probe each area more deeply – for example, to consider not just what racism is but what it feels like as well as questions about what we mean by ethnicity and why we use particular terms e.g. heritage and ethnicity rather than ‘race’.\n\nThe book seeks to support children in thinking more deeply about their behaviours, like whether it could be racist to copy people’s clothes and traditions. It tackles some of the things that children will hear in wider society – why the Black Lives Matter slogan is not the same as saying that not all lives matter. The book also addresses the causes of racism from slavery to fake news and explores questions about our identities and how each of us can play our part in tackling racism. The book finishes with some fairly unsettling facts – that in the past, humans were exhibited in zoos; that people are still enslaved today; and that in wars, millions have been killed because of racism. The book’s author was supported by the ‘Show Racism the Red Card’ organisation, a child psychologist and a history professor ensuring that the answers are clear, accurate and approached with sensitivity and respect.\n\nThis is a powerful and necessary addition to a primary classroom.\n\nKatie Daynes & Jordan Akpojaro\n\n& Sandhya Prabhat\n\nNon-fiction\n\nAnswering young children's questions about racism is hard. This book gives both children and adults the language and sensitivity they need to talk about the topic. It gently explains what racism is, how it happens, why it is NEVER acceptable and what each and every one of us can do to eradicate it."
