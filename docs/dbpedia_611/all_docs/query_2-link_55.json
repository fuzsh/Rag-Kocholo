https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47RzSvweTOE\n\nhttps://YouTube.com/emeagwali\n\nPodcast: https://SoundCloud.com/emeagwali\n\n11.1 How I Named My New Internet\n\n11.1.1 Naming of My New Internet\n\nScientific knowledge\n\nis the first son of God.\n\nScience pre-existed before humanity\n\nand before our planet, the Earth,\n\nwas formed 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nBack in 1989,\n\none of the science news headlines\n\nwas that an African Supercomputer Wizard\n\nin the United States\n\nhad experimentally discovered\n\nhow and why parallel processing\n\nmakes modern computers faster\n\nand makes the new supercomputer\n\nthe fastest\n\nand invented\n\nhow and why to use\n\nthat new supercomputer knowledge\n\nto build a new supercomputer\n\nthat encircled the globe\n\nin the way the internet does.\n\nI am that African supercomputer scientist\n\nwho was in the news\n\nback in 1989.\n\nI was in the news\n\nfor experimentally discovering\n\nthat parallel processing\n\nis an entirely new way of supercomputing\n\nacross thousands or millions or billions\n\nof processors.\n\nParallel processing\n\nis defined as the technique\n\nof fastest supercomputing\n\nthat is fastest\n\nby computing many things\n\nat once, or in parallel,\n\ninstead of computing only one thing\n\nat a time, or in sequence.\n\nPrior to my 1989 invention,\n\nparallel processing was widely caricatured\n\nand rejected\n\nas a huge waste of everybody’s time.\n\nParallel processing\n\nwas rejected for four reasons.\n\nThe first reason\n\nthe parallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas rejected\n\nwas because supercomputing in parallel\n\nhad performance problems.\n\nThat is, in the 1980s and earlier,\n\nparallel processing supercomputers\n\ncould not compute faster than\n\nsequential processing supercomputers.\n\nThe second reason\n\nthe parallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas rejected\n\nwas because it was physically impossible\n\nto invent\n\nhow to harness\n\n64 binary thousand processors\n\nand harness them\n\nto compute together to solve\n\nany of the twenty toughest problems\n\narising in supercomputing.\n\nThose extreme-scale problems\n\nwere called the twenty Grand Challenges\n\nof supercomputing.\n\nThe third reason\n\nthe parallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas rejected\n\nwas that programming supercomputers\n\nto solve a system of coupled, nonlinear,\n\ntime-dependent, and state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof a new calculus\n\nmade research computational mathematicians\n\ndeeply uncomfortable.\n\nIn particular, to parallel process\n\nvia emails\n\nsent to and from\n\nsixteen-bit long email addresses\n\nand to parallel process\n\nthe most dense, abstract,\n\nand impenetrable equations\n\nand to parallel process\n\ntheir algebraic approximations\n\nand to parallel process\n\ntheir floating-point arithmetical calculations\n\nthat must be executed across\n\nsixteen times\n\ntwo-to-power sixteen,\n\nor across one binary million, email wires\n\nis like dancing in the fire.\n\nThe fourth reason\n\nthe parallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas rejected\n\nwas that I, its discoverer,\n\nwas black and African.\n\nMy research and experimental discovery\n\nof parallel processing\n\nwas not taken seriously\n\nin the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nMy 1,057 page research report\n\non the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas rejected six times\n\nand rejected by three universities\n\nand rejected by scientific journals\n\nbefore it was eventually accepted\n\nby the supercomputer community.\n\nIn the 1980s, the massively\n\nparallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas unfathomable\n\nand for that reason\n\na president of an American university\n\nthat had an annual research expenditure\n\nof one billion dollars\n\nand his five supercomputer experts\n\nthrew my one thousand\n\nand fifty-seven [1,057]-page\n\nsupercomputer research report\n\ninto the trash.\n\nWhen a newspaper journalist\n\nwriting about my invention\n\ncame to interview\n\nthose five supercomputer experts\n\nthey couldn’t do the interview.\n\nThe reason was that\n\nthey never read or understood\n\nmy supercomputer research report.\n\nSo I was not taken seriously\n\nuntil The Computer Society\n\nof the IEEE—The Institute of Electrical\n\nand Electronics Engineers—\n\ngave me the top prize in supercomputing.\n\nTo put my dilemma in context,\n\nback in the 1980s,\n\nit was impossible\n\nfor an all-white scientific jury\n\nto give me the top award\n\nin computer science.\n\nThe award committees\n\nasked for my photograph\n\nor insisted on a face-to-face interview\n\nthat will reveal\n\nthe fact that I am black and African.\n\nIn the 1980s,\n\nonly one award committee\n\ndid not demand my photograph.\n\nI won that award\n\nand it made the news headlines\n\nthat a black African\n\nhad won the top prize\n\nin supercomputing.\n\nThe controversy\n\nprompted the award committee\n\nto change their rules\n\nand to demand a face-to-face lecture\n\nthat, in turn, made it impossible\n\nfor other black supercomputer scientists\n\nto win the top prize in supercomputing.\n\nTo this day,\n\nthe color of my skin\n\ngets more attention\n\nthan the solution of my equations.\n\nIn the 1980s and earlier\n\nand in the United States,\n\nwhite research mathematicians\n\ndid not attend research seminars\n\ngiven by black research mathematicians.\n\n11.1.2 Why I Won the Top Prize in Supercomputing\n\nWhen the Computer Society\n\nof The Institute of Electrical\n\nand Electronics Engineers\n\ngives its top award to a supercomputer inventor,\n\ncomputer scientists\n\nand the 450 thousand members\n\nof The Institute reads about it.\n\nAfter my widely-rejected\n\nexperimental discovery\n\nwas accepted and validated\n\nby The Computer Society,\n\nthe naysaying vector processing supercomputer scientists\n\nthat—at that time—did not believe in\n\nparallel processing supercomputers\n\nsaw The Computer Society’s endorsement\n\nof my experimental discovery\n\nas a vote of confidence\n\non massively parallel processing supercomputers.\n\nThe public saw the news headlines\n\non the African supercomputer wizard\n\nthat won top US prize\n\nas a vote of confidence\n\non Philip Emeagwali.\n\nIn the decades of the 1960s\n\nthrough ‘80s,\n\nparallel processing\n\nwas the subject of a titanic battle\n\nbetween the majority\n\nwho believed that all supercomputers\n\nshould be powered by\n\na single, isolated processor\n\nand the minority\n\nwho believed that all supercomputers\n\nshould be powered by\n\nan ensemble of thousands of processors.\n\nThat was the reason\n\nonly one computational mathematician\n\nattended my public lecture\n\non parallel processing\n\nthat took place in November 1982\n\nand took place in a lecture auditorium\n\nthat was a short walk\n\nfrom The White House, Washington, D.C.\n\nNine years later, my lecture\n\non parallel processing supercomputing\n\nthat I gave on July 8, 1991\n\nin Washington, D.C.\n\nwas before a standing room only audience of research computational mathematicians\n\nthat were attending\n\nthe largest international congress\n\nof mathematics.\n\nThat audience—that was similar\n\nto the one of nine years earlier\n\nthat humiliated, ridiculed,\n\nand rejected my experimental discovery\n\nof parallel processing—gave me\n\na standing ovation.\n\n11.1.3 The Free Performance Lunch is Over\n\nAfter my experimental discovery\n\nof how and why parallel processing\n\nmakes modern computers faster\n\nand makes the new supercomputer\n\nthe fastest\n\nmy telephone began to ring off the hook.\n\nIt seemed like every other\n\nresearch computational scientist\n\nwanted to become my new best friend\n\nand my new scientific collaborator.\n\nSo, I was not surprised\n\nwhen Steve Jobs\n\ntried to reach me by telephone\n\nin about June 1990.\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nwanted to know how he could harness\n\nthe power of parallel processing\n\nto process images\n\nand to do so faster.\n\nTo put things in context,\n\nback in June 1990, Steve Jobs\n\nwas depressed and devastated\n\nbecause he was unceremonious removed\n\nfrom Apple Corporation,\n\nthe company that he started.\n\nLooking for a new direction,\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nwas intrigued by my experimental discovery\n\nof how and why parallel processing\n\nacross a global network of\n\n65,536 processors,\n\nor across a new internet,\n\nreduced 65,536 days, or 180 years,\n\nof time-to-solution\n\non only one processor\n\nthat is not a member\n\nof an ensemble of processors\n\nto just one day of time-to-solution\n\nacross a new internet\n\nthat is a global network of\n\n65,536 commodity-off-the-shelf processors.\n\nFast forward eighteen years,\n\nto June 9, 2008,\n\nSteve Jobs\n\ntold the opening session\n\nof Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, California\n\nthat parallel processing\n\nis still very challenging.\n\nAs reported, the following day,\n\nin the June 10, 2008 issue\n\nof the New York Times,\n\nSteve Jobs\n\ntold Apple’s Worldwide Developers\n\nthat: [quote]\n\nPROP ALERT\n\n“The way the processor industry\n\nis going\n\nis to add more and more cores,\n\nbut nobody knows\n\nhow to program\n\nthose things,”\n\nSteve Jobs said.\n\nAnd he continued:\n\n“I mean, two, yeah;\n\nfour, not really;\n\neight, forget it.”\n\n[unquote]\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow and why\n\nmassively parallel processing\n\nis at the heart of the fastest supercomputer.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nthat massively parallel processing\n\nis a necessary condition\n\nfor the fastest supercomputers.\n\nHistorically, we never had\n\nnew supercomputers without\n\nexperimentally discovering\n\nfaster supercomputer speeds.\n\nTo achieve grand wizardry\n\nin fastest massively parallel supercomputing\n\nrequires the visceral understanding\n\nthat the massively parallel supercomputer\n\nis not a new computer, per se.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nthat my new and massively\n\nparallel supercomputer\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas a global network of\n\n65,536 processors\n\nis a small internet, de facto.\n\n11.1.4 My Naming Convention Across a New Internet\n\nI invented a new internet\n\nthat was defined and outlined\n\nby a new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled processors.\n\nAnd I invented\n\nhow to use that new internet\n\nto make modern computers faster\n\nand to make the new supercomputer\n\nthe fastest\n\nand how and why to use\n\nthat new supercomputer knowledge\n\nto build a new supercomputer\n\nthat encircled the globe\n\nin the way the internet does.\n\nI will take a retrospective look\n\non my early years,\n\nor the sixteen years\n\nonward of June 20, 1974.\n\nI will look back on how I named\n\neach processor within my new internet\n\nthat is a global network of\n\n64 binary thousand processors.\n\nAnd how I invented\n\nthat new internet\n\nto be a massively parallel supercomputer.\n\nI experimentally invented\n\nhow to assign a unique string of\n\nsixteen zeroes and ones\n\nand assign each string\n\nas the sixteen-bit name\n\nof each of my two-to-power sixteen codes that had a one-to-one correspondence\n\nwith my 64 binary thousand processors.\n\nSo after several years\n\nof hands-on, direct programming\n\nof an ensemble of 64 binary thousand\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas my new internet,\n\nI became known to programmers\n\nin the supercomputing community\n\nas the [quote unquote]\n\n“go-to” person.\n\nResearch supercomputer scientists\n\nthat sought answers to questions\n\non message passing came to me.\n\nVector processing supercomputer programmers—who at that time\n\npresumed that I was in the\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\n\nin Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States\n\nthat was the supercomputing capital\n\nof the world\n\nemailed me\n\nwhen they wanted to learn\n\nhow to program\n\nthe message-passing ensemble of processors\n\nthat everybody hated\n\nand that everybody ridiculed, mocked,\n\nand disrespected\n\nas a huge waste of everybody’s time.\n\nThat unique message-passing\n\nsupercomputer experience\n\nthat I gained in the 1980s\n\nwas the reason,\n\nI was appointed in the early 1990s\n\nas the Distinguished Lecturer\n\nof the two leading computer societies\n\nin the world,\n\nnamely, the Association\n\nfor Computing Machinery\n\nand The Computer Society\n\nof the Institute of Electrical\n\nand Electronics Engineers.\n\n11.1.5 Father of the Internet\n\nA twelve-year-old writing a school report\n\non “Philip Emeagwali”\n\nasked me:\n\n“Why are you called\n\nthe father of the Internet?”\n\nI answered:\n\n“The internet\n\nhas many fathers and mothers,\n\nuncles and aunts.\n\nBut I am the only father\n\nof the Internet\n\nthat invented a new internet.\n\nI am the only father\n\nof the modern supercomputer\n\nwho was profiled\n\nin major U.S. newspapers\n\nand who was credited\n\nfor the invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nBack in June 1974,\n\nI conceived 64 thousand computers\n\naround the Earth\n\nthat comprised of\n\na new global network of computers.\n\nI conceived that new global network\n\nas used to forecast the weather.\n\nBut it took me fifteen years,\n\nonward of June 1974,\n\nto invent how to harness\n\nthat new global network of computers\n\nand harness it to forecast the weather.”\n\nIn 1989, it made the news headlines\n\nthat an African supercomputer wizard\n\nin the United States\n\nhad won the top prize\n\nin the field of supercomputing.\n\nThat African supercomputer wizard\n\nwas in the news for inventing\n\nhow to harness a new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors. Each processor\n\nwas akin to a tiny computer.\n\nI am that African\n\ninternet scientist\n\nwho was in the news\n\nback in 1989.\n\nI won the top prize in supercomputing\n\nbecause I experimentally discovered\n\nhow an ensemble of 65,536,\n\nor two-raised-to-power-16,\n\ncommodity-of-the shelf processors\n\ncould be assembled\n\nas the building blocks\n\nof a new supercomputer\n\nand harnessed to become\n\nthe world’s fastest supercomputer,\n\nde facto.\n\nI was in the news\n\nbecause I invented\n\nhow to synchronously communicate\n\nand how to simultaneously compute\n\nand how to communicate\n\nand compute together\n\nand how to do both\n\nas one seamless, cohesive unit.\n\nThat cohesive unit\n\nwas my new supercomputer de facto.\n\nThat cohesive unit\n\nwas defined around\n\na sixteen-dimensional hyperball\n\nthat is a new internet, by definition.\n\nThat cohesive unit\n\nwas the supercomputing machinery\n\nthat I used to send and receive emails\n\nto and from\n\n65,536, or two-to-power sixteen\n\nsixteen-bit long\n\nemail addresses.\n\nEach of those 64 binary thousand\n\nemail addresses\n\nwas a unique string of\n\n16 zeroes and ones.\n\nBack in the 1980s,\n\nI emailed 64 binary thousand\n\ncomputer codes\n\nto as many processors.\n\nEach of those computer codes\n\nsolved initial-boundary value problems\n\nwith each problem’s governing\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern calculus\n\nand with each equation’s specified\n\ninitial and boundary conditions.\n\nWhat made the news headlines\n\nwas that I solved\n\n24 million equations of algebra.\n\nThat was a world record\n\nin algebra\n\nback in 1989\n\nas well as my contribution\n\nto algebra.\n\nEach equation of algebra\n\nthat I solved\n\nwas restating the Second Law of Motion\n\nthat was at the physics core\n\nof the computational physics model\n\nthat I executed\n\nwithin each processor.\n\nI was in the news in 1989\n\nfor inventing\n\nhow to solve problems\n\nin extreme-scale algebra\n\nand for inventing how to solve them across\n\na new internet\n\nthat is a new global network of\n\n65,536 tightly-coupled processors\n\nwith each processor\n\noperating its own operating system\n\nand with each processor\n\nhaving its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other.\n\nI was in the news in 1989\n\nfor inventing that new internet\n\nand for inventing it\n\nas a new supercomputer, de facto.\n\nWhat made the news headlines\n\nwas that I synchronously communicated\n\nvia emails to and from\n\nacross 65,536 cooperating processors\n\nand that I simultaneously computed\n\nat the speed of 47,303\n\ncalculations per processor\n\nto compute\n\nat the then unheard of\n\ntotal speed of\n\n3.1 billion calculations per second.\n\nThat experimental discovery\n\nof massively parallel processing\n\nchanged the way we think about\n\nthe new supercomputer\n\nthat is the fastest computer\n\nthat will become\n\nthe computer of tomorrow,\n\nif history repeats itself.\n\nThat experimental discovery\n\nof massively parallel processing\n\ngarnered international headlines\n\nand I the story teller\n\nbecame the story\n\nand the subject of school reports titled:\n\n“The Contributions of Philip Emeagwali\n\nto the Development of the Computer.”\n\nI was the first to experimentally discover\n\nhow and why parallel processing\n\nmakes modern computers faster\n\nand makes the new supercomputer\n\nthe fastest\n\nand how to use\n\nthat new supercomputer knowledge\n\nto build a new supercomputer.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nmassively parallel processing\n\nand I did so\n\nby solving a grand challenge problem\n\nthat the United States government\n\ndefined as one of its\n\ntwenty gold-ring problems\n\nin supercomputing.\n\nMy experimental discovery\n\nchanged the way we looked at\n\nthe supercomputer.\n\nBack in the 1970s and ‘80s,\n\nI looked at the precursor\n\nto the modern supercomputer\n\nthat I programmed\n\nas a parallel processing internet\n\nthat was outlined and defined\n\nby my 65,536\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors.\n\nFast forward four decades,\n\nthe modern supercomputer\n\nis a union of vast numbers of processors\n\nthat communicate\n\nas a tightly-coupled Internet\n\nthat is outlined and defined\n\nby millions upon millions of processors.\n\nThat experimental discovery\n\nof the parallel processing internet\n\nis the reason I am profiled in books on the history of the Internet.\n\n11.1.6 How I Named My New Internet\n\nThe internet\n\nhas many fathers and mothers,\n\nuncles and aunts.\n\nBut I am the only father\n\nof the Internet\n\nthat invented a new internet.\n\nI am the only father\n\nof the computer\n\nwho was profiled\n\nin major U.S. newspapers\n\nand who was credited\n\nfor the invention\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nEach of my 65,536\n\ntightly-coupled processors\n\nwith each processor\n\noperating its own operating system\n\nand with each processor\n\nhaving its own dedicated memory\n\nthat shared nothing with each other\n\nencircled my new internet\n\nand had its unique name.\n\nThat name was a unique string of\n\nsixteen zeroes and ones.\n\nI used a unique binary reflected\n\nnaming scheme\n\nfor each processor\n\nthat was within my global network of\n\n65,536 processors.\n\nMy global network of processors\n\nis a small internet.\n\nThat small copy of the internet\n\nis one of the keys\n\nto my experimental discovery\n\nof how and why parallel processing\n\nmakes modern computers faster\n\nand makes the new supercomputer\n\nthe fastest\n\nand my invention\n\nof how to use\n\nthat new supercomputer knowledge\n\nto build a new supercomputer.\n\nThe experimental discovery\n\nof massively parallel processing across\n\na new internet\n\nis my contribution\n\nto the development of faster computers\n\nand the fastest supercomputer.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow and why\n\nthe millions of processors\n\nof a massively parallel supercomputer\n\ncan be harnessed to cooperatively\n\ncompute together\n\nand to compute as one seamless,\n\ncohesive unit\n\nand to compute faster than\n\nany serial or any vector\n\nprocessing supercomputer.\n\nI experimentally discovered massively\n\nparallel processing\n\nand I invented the technology\n\nthrough my proper naming\n\nof the processors within my internet.\n\nI visualized my internet\n\nas encircling a globe, or a hyperglobe,\n\nin hyperspace.\n\nThat experimental discovery\n\nis my contribution\n\nto the development\n\nof the first internet\n\nthat’s the fastest supercomputer\n\nand that massively parallel processed\n\nacross an ensemble of\n\n65,536 cooperating processors.\n\n11.1.7 The Modern
