        "text": "Extensive research on African-Caribbean males indicates that they have high levels of underachievement and exclusion as compared to other groups of students in secondary schools in the UK. This dissertation concerns African Caribbean males’ memories of their experiences in secondary schools in South Wales. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were implemented to collect data. Five male participants aged 18 to 26 years were interviewed about their stories. The majority of the participants’ stories reflected positive secondary school experiences with four of the five participants entering University and the fifth participant successfully securing his National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) level 3. Most of the participants did not reveal a school culture of inherent racism, discrimination and victimisation. Furthermore the participants’ responses to how they would react to offensiveness were calm and peaceful. The relatively successful experiences of secondary school, NVQs and University matriculation compared with the negative statistical evidence of black boys failing in schools forms the substance of this dissertation, which explores the participants’ successes as well as the resilience factors that they developed. This dissertation provides a framework for exploring and gaining meaning about African Caribbean boys’ educational experiences and trying to gain meaning from their interviews about what factors hinder or enhance their ability to succeed in school.\n\nThis study seeks to challenge deficit views on Black male education by highlighting the perspectives of academically successful Black males in a secondary school setting. Employing interpretive qualitative methods, I present the narratives of academically successful Black males, emphasizing their reflections on race, school and academic achievement. In particular, this study highlights the educa- tional dispositions and expectations of Black males, including the influences of their support systems on their academic trajectories. One support system comprised of parents, including the academic expectations held of their sons as well as their racial socializing practices. Another support system included their teachers, particularly those who demonstrated pedagogical, expectation and relational characteristics seen as enabling Black male success.\n\nWithin Higher Education, a substantial amount of research has explored black students’ experiences within post 1992 universities (Elevation Networks 2012; BITC 2010; RfO 2011; Leathwood 2004; Read et al. 2003). Research indicates that British African Caribbean men (BACM) are well represented in higher education (Richardson 2010). However, when the type of universities these students attend is examined, research indicates that substantially more black students attend post-1992 universities than ‘old universities’ (Bhattacharyya et al. 2003; Elevation Networks 2012). In 2010 less than one per cent of all Oxbridge students were black. Between 2010 and 2012 less than five per cent of all students entering Russell Group and Oxbridge universities were British African Caribbean (Boliver 2013). Only limited research has explored the outcomes of ethnic minority students studying at Russell Group universities (Fielding 2008; Richardson 2008) and much of this has been quantitative rather than qualitative. Furthermore, minimal research has explored the experiences of black students and black men in particular through their experiences of attending elite UK universities. This dissertation explores the counter-narratives of the few British African Caribbean men who have successfully attended and graduated from elite universities in England and Wales. This research examines these students’ recognised as well as unrecognised, resources and capitals to gain an understanding of the factors that have assisted them in their matriculation to, and graduation from, elite universities. It is hoped that these findings will be beneficial in helping staff involved in the admission processes at elite universities to gain a better understanding of areas that need improvement in order to increase the numbers of British African Caribbean male students attending elite universities. Lastly, this research hopes its findings will be beneficial in influencing more black men in future generations to aspire to attend elite UK institutions.\n\nThis thesis aims to address a paucity in the literature of the experiences of &#39;home&#39; Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) students in postgraduate (PG) education in England, with a particular focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). This is done by (1) identifying institutional barriers to access to and progression through PG study, including the role of Widening Participation (WP) policy and (2) the factors facilitating educational success of BME students. This thesis uses a multi-faceted framework of intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1991), Critical Race Theory (CRT) (Gillborn, 2008), Bourdieusian thinking tools (Bourdieu 1997) and Yosso&#39;s (2005) community cultural wealth (CCW) capitals (aspirational, linguistic, social, navigational, familial and resistant). It argues for the addition of what is theorised as perspective capital to the CCW framework, which can be seen as a resource that allows people of colour to make contributions to the field, stemming...\n\nBritish graduates of African Caribbean parentage who achieve educationally are an under-researched group. This paper uses intersectionality and critical race theory to explore the higher education (HE) experiences of a small group of British African Caribbean graduates. The theory of intersectionality provides a powerful tool for examining the structuring effects of ‘race’/ ethnicity, social class and gender in order to understand how multiple identities converge to create the specific experience of British African Caribbean students in a UK higher education context. Intersectionality lends itself to a qualitative methodology (Crenshaw, 1989) and critical race theory suggests that it is important to hear the voices of minoritised people in order to understand and challenge racism (Yosso, 2005). As such, a narrative approach was used to elicit what participants considered to be key features shaping their higher education experiences. It transpired that subtle racism in the forms of low expectations and lack of diversity positioned them as ‘outsiders within’ (Collins, 2000). In response, participants used independent learning strategies and emotional withdrawal to navigate their way through the sometimes hostile HE environment. Closely linked to ‘race’/ ethnicity were issues of social class, which influenced where participants studied and heightened their concerns about their own academic abilities. Consequently, African Caribbean support networks served as a vital source of social capital to overcome these challenges. The research involved both male and female respondents and a gender dynamic was evident in the prevalence of the women studying for Masters degrees at post-graduate level and identifying pleasure as a prime motivation to study. However, class related issues re-emerged as a barrier to doctoral study and academic careers. One of the conclusions of the research is that increased diversity in academic staff, higher education curriculum and cultural activities would improve the experience of British African Caribbean students. Another conclusion is that untapped potential exists amongst British African Caribbean postgraduate women. If harnessed, this could serve to bridge the gap between universities and communities in order to enhance social inclusion and genuinely improve diversity in higher education.\n\nThe challenges facing Black males throughout the educational pipeline have been discussed by researchers in detail. However, missing from this research are discussions from the perspective of researchers, educators, and community members united on how to better support Black males. The purpose of this reflective piece is twofold. First, we address and contextualize the issues that Black boys and men face and have to overcome in academic and community settings from our various perspectives serving as a teacher candidate, in-service teacher, and higher education professionals. Second we provide recommendations for education stakeholders to help support Black males from our various perspectives."
