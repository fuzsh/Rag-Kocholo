        "text": "Mankind has always been on a mission to better itself in whatever field or endeavor it sought out\n\nto accomplish. In doing so, our race came upon the need to quantify and differentiate. This is ever\n\nmore valid for the human intelligence.\n\nPinpointing the birthdate of the IQ Test is, more often than not, an arduous journey that can vary\n\nfrom author to author. In the early 19th century, Paul Broca and Sir Francis Galton were two of the\n\nfirst academics who pondered on the importance of measuring intelligence under what we now\n\nknow is the wrong assumption that intellectual prowess is directly linked to the size of the human\n\nskull – the bigger your head, the smarter you are. Around the same period, Wilhelm Wundt\n\nsuggested that mankind’s innate capacity to process thoughts was the real method of measuring\n\none’s intelligence. In today’s day and age, it is fair to say that both these lines of thinking are no\n\nlonger relevant, but were in fact the predecessors of what is now called the modern IQ Test.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1900s, two French psychologists by the names of Alfred Binet and Theodore\n\nSimon were solicited by the Ministry of Education to create a test that would assist in distinguishing\n\nbetween children who suffer from any form of mental impedance and those who did not have any\n\ndisorders but were what we normally refer to as “lazy”. It is important to provide the historical\n\ncontext that led to the need for this test: a recent law had been passed making it mandatory for\n\nchildren to attend school, thus the need to devise a way of branding a child’s needs based on their\n\nintellectual capacity.\n\nBinet and Simon’s initial approach was to formulate questions founded on subjects that are not\n\ncommonly trained at school such as focus, memory and problem-solving skills. The goal of this\n\nprocess was to regulate and ultimately predict the overall success of the child at an academic level.\n\nOnce Binet started processing the data he had obtained, it came to his attention that physical age\n\nwas not a defining factor when it came to correctly answering the questions – some potential\n\nscholars were better at answering more complex questions when compared with older children.\n\nThe opposite was also valid. Intrigued by this prospect, Binet then came to suggest the idea of\n\nmental age, this being the measurement of intelligence based on a child’s average ability within a\n\nspecific age group.\n\nAfter obtaining and analyzing a significant amount of data, the first intelligence test was born under\n\nthe name Binet-Simon Scale. This innovative method became the foundation of the intelligence\n\ntests that are still carried out during our times. This is not to say that Binet, the test’s creator, didn’t\n\nfind some flaws in its effectiveness: it is not reasonable that a person’s level of intelligence be\n\nlabelled based solely on a standardized test. Binet emphasized that several intellectual factors need\n\nto be considered and that an ideal result would only be possible when comparing subjects with\n\nsimilar upbringings. The initial use of the term IQ dates back to 1912 when William Stern, a German\n\npsychologist, entertained the idea of an intelligence quotient, based on the works of Binet.\n\nDespite its limitations, the Binet-Simon Scale was a remarkable milestone in quantifying the human\n\npsyche and quickly found a place for itself within the United States where it was first used by Lewis\n\nTermin, a Stanford University psychologist, who applied the test to a sample of American applicants.\n\nThis evolution of the initial test was published in 1916 as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and\n\nremains the standard intelligence test used in the country to this day. The result of this test, also\n\nknown as the IQ or Intelligence Quotient score is calculated by dividing the test taker’s mental age\n\nby their chronological age and then multiplying this number by 100. For instance, considering a child\n\nwith a mental age of 15 and a chronological age of 12, their IQ would be 125 (15 ÷ 12 x 100).\n\nThe IQ Test’s first massive trial by fire happened during World War I where 2 million recruits were\n\nasked to undergo this examination with the intent of allocating soldiers to certain roles and\n\nleadership positions. In 1917 two tests were developed by Robert Yerkes, the then chair of the\n\nCommittee on the Psychological Examination of Recruits – the Alpha and Beta tests. The Alpha test\n\nwas planned as a written test, while the Beta test was comprised of images oriented at soldiers who\n\ncould not read and/or speak English. Despite the end of the war, these tests remained prominent in\n\neveryday life. As an example, they were used as a selection process for new immigrants intending\n\nto enter the United States. The massive use of this test did however lead to wrong preconceptions\n\nabout specific nationalities which, in its place, led to restrictions related to human influx.\n\nUnhappy with the restrictions of the Stanford-Binet scale, American psychologist David Wechsler\n\nissued a new intelligence test, acknowledged as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), in\n\n1955. Much like Binet, Wechsler thought that intelligence involved different mental abilities.\n\nWechsler also established two different tests explicitly oriented to children: the Wechsler\n\nIntelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence\n\n(WPPSI). The adult equivalent of the test has undergone intense revisions since its maiden version\n\nand is currently known as the WAIS-IV.\n\nThe WAIS-IV covers ten subtests as well as five complementary tests. The test covers four key areas\n\nof intelligence: verbal understanding, perceptual reasoning, memory and processing speed. Instead\n\nof utilizing a chronological and mental age premise, the WAIS score is obtained by associating the\n\nsubject’s score with individuals in the same age group. This scoring method has become the\n\nstandard technique in intelligence testing and is also used in the modern revision of the StanfordBinet test.\n\nAs is valid for all forms of human experience, quantifying one’s intelligence is not a simple process\n\nand, as has been mentioned, suffered several updates throughout the decades. What is true though\n\nis that we can rest assured that great minds are constantly studying and perfecting what we know\n\nabout the mystery that still is the human mind.\n\nPerformance is the main reason for pressure and stress in today’s high-paced world. We are\n\nconstantly on the spotlight when it comes to getting whichever task done as quickly and efficiently\n\nas possible that we often forget to take care of ourselves. We are always on the clock and this takes\n\na huge toll on our overall health and energy levels.\n\nThis is not something you should worry too much about though. There is no need to think you are\n\ngoing crazy, let alone to start knocking on your friendly neighborhood therapist’s door. All you need\n\nis a little motivation. The following list will run you through 10 great apps to help you keep the juices\n\nflowing and your mental health as sharp as ever.\n\n1.

The most mysterious and\n\nintriguing of these is our brain. It holds countless secrets that science is yet to find answers to\n\nand, as with all muscles, it needs to be exercised in order to fully function. Here are a few tips\n\nand tricks to keep your brain in ideal condition regardless of the effects of aging.\n\nGet Physical Exercise\n\nBody and Mind are connected in more ways than we can imagine. The way you treat your\n\nphysical side is going to undeniably reflect itself on your mind. Make sure that you stay physically\n\nactive, even if you can only make time for a simple walk. Numerous studies have shown that the\n\nslightest form of motion can go a long way into improving both memory and cognitive skills. At\n\nan anatomical level, the impact caused by your foot when walking causes pressure waves\n\nthrough the arteries which increases blood flow. Sports that are proven to be optimal sources\n\nof brain health are:\n\nTeam sports such as basketball or football\n\nCycling\n\nYoga or Tai Chi\n\nAerobic or gym exercise\n\nWalking\n\nRunning or jogging\n\nWater sports\n\nMaintain a Healthy Diet\n\nFood is the fuel that keeps us running as human beings so maintaining a close eye on what we\n\nconsume is extremely important. Our brain is particularly fond of nuts, fish and even red wine;\n\nhowever, these products are also known to give our mind an extra boost:\n\nSalmon – a great source of Omega-3 fatty acids\n\nGreen Tea – rich in polyphenols and antioxidants, it not only improves alertness and\n\nfocus, but is also known to reduce the risk of serious diseases such as Alzheimer or\n\nParkinson.\n\nEggs – packed with essential nutrients such as B6, B12, folate and choline, all elements\n\nthat help regulate both our memory and our general mood\n\nBlueberries – the antioxidants they contain aid in improving the communication\n\nbetween brain cells, delay short-term memory loss and also reduce inflammation.\n\nWork on your posture\n\nIt might sound like a cliché that your parents, teachers and even television has been feeding you\n\nthroughout the years, but the truth is that having good posture plays a beneficial role on your\n\nwellbeing. Studies show that keeping an upright posture does improve the circulation and blood\n\nflow to the brain. Here are three simple tips to make sure you’re in the right direction:\n\nSleep with an aligned spine – resting on your back or on the side is known to generate\n\nless stress on your spine. When sleeping on your back, gravity makes sure that your body\n\nis centered on your spine. Should you sleep on your side, try to point your chin straight\n\nahead.\n\nBalance- exercising your overall body balance will not only avoid occasional tripping and\n\nfalling, but it also benefits your spine. More relaxing activities such as Yoga or Tai Chi are\n\nvery beneficial in this regard.\n\nWeigh healthy – Being over or underweight adds stress to your muscles and ultimately\n\nmakes you more inclined to adopt a wrong body posture\n\nSleep as much as you can\n\nThis is a tricky one and will clearly vary from person to person. Not getting enough sleep can\n\ndeeply impact your overall state of mind and lead to severe problems related to memory,\n\nconcentration, as well as cognitive functions. It is during our snooze time that newly acquired\n\nskills and memories are processed by our brains creating a permanent imprint. As a rule of\n\nthumb, adults above 65 should attempt to get 7-8 hours sleep, while those aged 26 to 64 should\n\naim at 7-9 hours. Here are some suggestions on how to make the most of our bedtime:\n\nConsistency – try to go to bed and wake up at the same time on a routine basis.\n\nRepetition is key to a healthy rest.\n\nLight dinners – having very large meals can lead to longer digestive periods which can\n\nboth be harmful to your stomach and deprive you from sleep. Try to keep your evening\n\nfood consumption to small snacks such as nuts or fruit.\n\nCut on stimulants – Coffee, Chocolates, Cola or Cigarettes should be highly avoided\n\nbetween four to six hours prior to going to bed. Alcohol should also be limited as it\n\ndisrupts both REM and slow-wave sleep, both essential to a healthy memory.\n\nNever Stop Learning\n\nNot only is the unknown exciting, but it also stimulates the brain. Studies have shown that\n\nreading and writing on a regular basis, for instance, helps reduce memory loss at a later stage in\n\nlife by 32%. Playing a musical instrument is also a beneficial way of engaging your memory and\n\nso is learning a foreign language as it improves cognitive functioning in older adults as well as\n\nhelps strengthen your decision making, believe it or not. Having a hobby also increases your\n\nnotion of self-esteem and self-worth which in itself can do wonders for the mind. Simply think\n\nabout something that interests you and go for it. A few ideas to start things off:\n\nCarpentry\n\nGardening\n\nCooking\n\nPhotography\n\nFishing\n\nPainting\n\nSwimming\n\nDon’t over-use your brain\n\nIt is important to remember that we are not machines, meaning that we have the luxury of not\n\nhaving all the answers at all times. Save your mental energy by choosing what needs to be\n\nremembered and what doesn’t. Use calendars, planners, shopping lists or address books instead\n\nof wasting away mental power that could be used for other, more significant, tasks. Not having\n\nto worry about too many details will help you focus better and free up your memory.\n\nThese are but a few tips and tricks that will get you on your way to programming your brain to\n\nbetter aid you in day-to-day tasks. Keep in mind that aging is part of life, but we have the power\n\nto take care of ourselves and make sure that our journey on Earth is an amazing one from day\n\none.\n\nLife is made out of unforeseeable circumstances, some pleasant and heartwarming, others bitter\n\nand full of pain. Illness is without a doubt the main source of discomfort and lack of quality of\n\nlife. Dementia, a general term used to describe the loss of memory and other related thinking\n\nabilities, can lead to other more serious diseases such as Alzheimer’s. But what if there are\n\nsimple ways of training our brains into preventing or at least delaying the effects of this\n\ntroublesome disease?\n\nTraining one’s brain is a continuous task that, when done correctly, has exceptional results not\n\nonly on a person’s mental prowess but also on their wellbeing as a whole. Common forms of\n\nactivities that challenge the brain are crossword puzzles, sudoku and a wide variety of computer\n\ngames. Many studies have been undertaken with the sole goal of answering one question: can\n\nbrain training prevent dementia? Some say yes. Evidence shows that cognitive training can\n\nimprove both memory and thinking, especially among middle-aged or older individuals.\n\nEvidence also suggests that brain training may even help older adults to perform their daily tasks\n\nat a more satisfying pace, however, further studies are required in order to consolidate these\n\nclaims.\n\nBrain training is based on the idea that if you do not use something, you will end up losing it. As\n\nsuch, the more you challenge your brain the less likely you are to suffer any form of cognitive\n\nimpairment, which obviously includes dementia. The premise for this theory is that individuals\n\nwho perform highly complex jobs or who do crosswords, puzzles or learn new hobbies tend to\n\nhave lower rates of dementia.\n\nThe biggest study taken to date with the use of computer brain training was sponsored by the\n\nAlzheimer’s Society and counted with nearly 7,000 people above the age of 50. The brain training\n\nprogram in display tested the individual’s cognitive and problem-solving skills. The outcomes\n\nunveiled that there were progresses in reasoning and the recollection of words six months after\n\nthe test. The further the exercises were accomplished; the more likely participants were to see\n\nenhancements in these brain functions. Some people in the study took cognitive tests but did\n\nnot participate in the brain training games. This type of study is considered precise because the\n\ninvestigators can compare the results of those who did brain training with those who did not.\n\nThis helps to analyze the true effect of a study on a patient. Those above 60 years of age who\n\npartook in the study described that the brain training test also improved their ability to\n\nexperience their daily activities such as handling a household budget, making meals, shopping\n\nor even using public transportation.\n\nThere are a great variety of commercial brain training games and products on the marketplace,\n\nsome of which have been tested in rigorous studies while most of them have not. This can be a\n\ndelicate matter as brain training games are designed to challenge different brain functions so be\n\non the alert when choosing a training game. These may not have scientific evidence backing\n\nthem up which may mean that they are making false claims for their own financial benefit.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease affects 5.4 million people in America alone, most of which are over 65. As\n\nour society ages, higher is the number of individuals who suffer from this disease. Alzheimer’s\n\ncauses issues with memory, discerning and conduct, and while it is normal to sporadically\n\noverlook things as you get older, Alzheimer’s is not a standard part of aging. Alzheimer’s disease\n\nis the most frequent form of dementia, a general term for memory and thinking difficulties that\n\nare so severe that they can affect day to day events, accounting for at least 60 percent of\n\ndementia cases, mostly among those 65 and older. In some situations, however, it can distress\n\nyounger people. Alzheimer’s is a progressive and sadly uncurable disease. Nevertheless,\n\ninvestigators have confidence that it is possible to try and delay the onset of symptoms or stop\n\nthem from progressing at a fast pace. One of the ways researchers trust as a form of delaying\n\nthe start of dementia is with the help of brain training. The premise behind brain training is that\n\njust as exercise helps you keep your body in good shape, mental exercises help your brain stay\n\nnice and fit.\n\nA rigorous study discovered that brain-training actions can decrease the risk of dementia. The\n\ntechnique used is called speed-of-processing, being the main objective to have the person\n\nspeedily recognize and recall an object that is before them.\n\nThroughout the study, applicants were arbitrarily placed in one of three training groups: verbal\n\nmemory skills training, reasoning and problem-solving skills and the third for speed-ofprocessing training. All through speed-of-processing training, contributors acknowledged an\n\nobject in front of them, as well as objects in their peripheral vision. As the game carried on,\n\napplicants had less time to identify objects and also faced distractions on the screen.\n\nThe group of contributors that established speed-of-processing brain-training sessions\n\nexperienced a 29 percent reduced risk of dementia for the following 10 years. Still, academics\n\nnote that more revisions need to be performed in order to understand why speed-of-processing\n\nbrain training is effective, as opposed to the other types of brain training.\n\nDespite the fact that it is uncertain if games tailored explicitly in the direction of dementia and\n\nAlzheimer’s prevention actually work, there is proof that maintaining your mind sharp and taking\n\ngood care of yourself can help keep your brain healthy as well.\n\nTaking care of oneself, such as getting 150 minutes of exercise per week, eating a healthy diet\n\nfilled with fruit, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and dairy may encourage brain health.\n\nAdditionally, staying mentally and socially dynamic as you age may help to keep your brain\n\nhealthy. Consider lively events such as adult education classes, handicraft workshops, reading a\n\nstimulating book, doing crossword puzzles or other errands that expose your mind to new and\n\nfulfillng tasks.\n\nNobody likes being labelled. The same principle is valid for intelligence. It is part of our DNA to\n\ncontinuously try to better ourselves and let’s face it – no one likes being called dumb. There has\n\nbeen a lot of debating recently regarding IQ results and if we are stuck with the same score for\n\nthe rest of our lives. In this article we will try to shed some light on this matter.\n\nAt a first glance, one can claim that our IQ will remain unchanged throughout our lifetimes. It is\n\na fact that our personal life experiences and growth play a very important part in our path, but\n\nit is common ground to consider that an individual’s IQ score will remain unchangeable.\n\nShould we dig deeper, it will come to our attention that even the standard IQ score shifts in\n\ndifferent stages of our lives. The IQ of a child will mutate as he matures, this is only logical. If we\n\nadd working-memory training to the mix the results are even more significant. The only obstacle\n\nin IQ gain is old age – where disease plays a negative role on the intellectual integrity of a person.\n\nOne of the most intriguing age spectrums are the teenage years. Research suggests that during\n\nthis period, an individual may either increase or decrease his IQ. This is most probably related\n\nto the development changes that a teenager experiences in terms of brain structure.\n\nLongitudinal brain-imaging studies further show evidence that fluctuations in grey matter are\n\nthe possible cause for this unstable occurrence.\n\nMRI brain scans and standard IQ tests were performed on 33 normal people in their early\n\nteenage years and then again in their late adolescent years. Results were far ranging, being the\n\npicked-up IQ scores between 77 and 135 in the early teen group and 87 to 143 in the later years\n\ngroup. The reached conclusion was that the IQ score altered between -20 to +23 in terms of\n\nverbal IQ and -28 and +17 for non-verbal IQ. Further analysis showed a link between the IQ and\n\nincreases in cortical density and the brain volume related to the regions involving verbal and\n\nmovement functions.\n\nThis discovery is immense and provides answers to serious questions. Experiences during an\n\nindividual’s teenage years presumably alters one’s brain structure and mental capacity.\n\nOccurrences such as drug abuse, social stress or poor education seem to have significant\n\nnegative impacts on a young adult’s IQ level while a mentally healthy environment and an\n\nabundant educational experience can hugely benefit a teenager’s intellectual ability.\n\nThis data proposes that, no matter how much importance is given to a child at a pre-school level,\n\nit is the middle school and early high school years that form and shape our true intellectual\n\ngrowth. This makes us question the social neglect given to those who are “slow learners” as\n\nopposed to early high achievers who, more often than not, fail to live up to expectations as\n\nparents and educators assumed that they already had what it took to manage social experiences\n\non their own. This is a clear indication that educational care is something that should be\n\nincentivized no matter how autonomous a pupil appears to be.\n\nAlterations in a person’s IQ depends on a countless number of factors. Something we should\n\nconsider, though, is that maybe it is not about making a person smarter, it is actually about\n\nmaking said person function better. It is possible to teach a child to be better at math without\n\nthe need to teach him actual math. What is important is that we teach the child to organize and\n\nplan his strategy better, this will improve their academic outcome not only in a determined\n\nsubject but in the global comprehension of the task at hand. To some academics, being smarter\n\nis actually being more efficient at using the tools we are inherently given.\n\nComprehending changes in IQ also calls for delicate and pondered consideration on how we are\n\nmeasuring a given intelligence. There is a huge misconception about skill and knowledge – we\n\ncan improve our vocabulary through studying but this does not mean that we are getting any\n\nbrighter. The best approach to measuring intelligence is to analyze the skills that motivate the\n\ngain of knowledge we are looking to achieve.\n\nEven further studies seem to indicate that individuals, especially in more modern societies, are\n\nexperiencing significant changed in IQ over time – approximately 3 points per decade. To be\n\nmore precise, there seems to have been an 18-point increase from 1947 to 2002. Putting things\n\ninto numbers, the average IQ of a 20-year-old in 1947 was lower than that of a person with the\n\nsame age in 2002. Results also show that the older you are, the more stable your test score will\n\nbe.\n\nIt is important to differentiate between three distinct connotations of the word intelligence.\n\nThere is biological intelligence, or what is classically defined as neural efficiency. Then there is\n\npsychometric intelligence – your measured IQ score – which is an incidental and flawed method\n\nof estimating biological intelligence. Research throughout the past decade with the use of\n\nseveral state-of-the-art forms of neurotechnology (ie. brain fitness programs) suggest that it is\n\npossible to tweak your neural productivity. Your cognitive functions can be made to work more\n\ncompetently and in a more synchronized form. Taking all this into account, it is fair to say that\n\npeople can change their IQ scores. Your score may alter not due to any significant change in\n\ngeneral intelligence, but because different tests may be used which measure different levels of\n\nskill. Furthermore, some abilities tend to stabilize over time – such as verbal and reasoning –\n\nwhile others tend to deteriorate – for instance, processing speed and short-term memory.\n\nAs a conclusion, yes, our IQ varies throughout our lives, both in an increasing and a decreasing\n\npattern. Data seems to validate that our teen years are important in shaping our standard IQ\n\nscore, however it is not the only decisive factor. What is really determinant is how we use the\n\nlevel of intelligence we are given, the way we approach a task and how well we plan a strategy\n\nto face it. Being prepared is the key. Never stop challenging ourselves is the door.\n\nTrying to come up with a list of the smartest people who ever stepped foot on the planet is\n\nanything but an easy task to accomplish. Intelligence is highly subjective and so are the skills that\n\ndefine someone as smart. Being intelligent is one thing, using that intelligence to in some way\n\nadvance humanity, is something entirely different. At an IQ level, anything above 140 is generally\n\nconsidered near genius. Nonetheless, here is a list of some of the brainiest unsung humans who\n\never lived.\n\nWilliam Sidis\n\nWilliam James Sidis was an American child prodigy said to have an IQ between 250 and 300,\n\npossibly the highest score ever. Apart from his above-average math skills, which allowed William\n\nto join Harvard at the age of 11, he also spoke 40 languages. Sadly, William did not live up to\n\nexpectations and matured into an average human being, landing mediocre jobs and getting into\n\ntrouble with the law on several occasions.\n\nJudit Polgár\n\nWith an IQ of 170, Judit Polgár was a Hungarian chess player who is widely considered to be the\n\nbest female chess player of all time. At the age of 15 years and 4 months, Polgár won the title of\n\nGrandmaster, at the time the youngest to have done so. She is also the youngest person to ever\n\nbreak into the FIDE top 100 players rating list. She was the top-rated woman in the world from\n\nJanuary 1989 until her retirement on 13 August 2014.\n\nPhilip Emeagwali\n\nPhilip Emeagwali is a Nigerian computer scientist who won the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for priceperformance in high-performance computing applications, by using an innovative mathematical\n\nformula and applying it in an oil reservoir modeling calculation. With an IQ of 190, Philip was\n\nvoted as the greatest African scientist of all time. As an interesting sidenote, his math work is\n\noften considered as being influential in the construction of the internet.\n\nSrinivasa Ramanujan\n\nSrinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to\n\nanalysis, number theory, infinite series and continued fractions, together with solutions to\n\nmathematical problems then deemed unknowable. Ramanujan, who had almost no proper\n\ntraining in mathematics, initially developed his own research in isolation. His estimated IQ was\n\n185.\n\nHypatia of Alexandria\n\nHypatia was a Greek astronomer, philosopher and mathematician who lived in Egypt, then part\n\nof the Eastern Roman Empire. Although heralded by Pandrosion, another Alexandrine female\n\nmathematician, she is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded.\n\nWith an estimated IQ of 170-190, she was brutally murdered by a group of Christian fanatics\n\nafter being accused of witchcraft.\n\nGottfried Leibniz\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a renowned German polymath and one of the most significant\n\nlogicians, mathematicians and natural philosophers of the Enlightenment and is best known for\n\ninventing calculus. In philosophy, Leibniz is most illustrious for his optimism – his conclusion that\n\nour universe is, in a limited sense, the best possible one that God could have created. Leibniz’s\n\nIQ estimates range from 182 to 205.\n\nAndrew Wiles\n\nSir Andrew John Wiles is an English mathematician and a Royal Society Research Professor at\n\nthe University of Oxford, specialized in number theory. In 1995, Wiles verified a 358-year-old\n\nmathematical theory called Fermat’s Last Theorem, which until then was registered in the\n\nGuinness Book of World Records as the “most difficult math problem” in the world. He was\n\nappointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2000. Sir Andrew Wiles is\n\nsaid to have an IQ of 170.\n\nEmanuel Swedenborg\n\nEmanuel Swedenborg was a Swedish theologian, scientist, philosopher and mystic. He is best\n\nknown for his book on the afterlife, Heaven and Hell. In 1741 he began to experience dreams\n\nand visions which concluded in a “spiritual arising” in which he received a revelation that he was\n\nappointed by Jesus Christ to write The Heavenly Doctrine to reform Christianity.\n\nChristopher Hirata\n\nChristopher Hirata is an American cosmologist and astrophysicist who was hired by NASA at the\n\nage of 16 to do some research on the colonization of Mars. Christopher was only 13 when this\n\nchild prodigy won the gold medal in 1996 at the International Physics Olympiad. He also received\n\nhis PhD under the supervision of Uroš Seljak in 2005 from Princeton University in Astrophysics.\n\nKim Ung-Yong\n\nKim Ung-Yong is a South Korean professor and former child prodigy said to hold the highest IQ\n\nscore (210) according to the Guinness World Records. At the age of one, Kim had learned both\n\nthe Korean alphabet and 1,000 Chinese characters by studying the Thousand Character Classic,\n\na 6th-century Chinese poem. At three years old, he began to solve calculus problems. At 5, Kim\n\nhad acquired astonishing linguistic skills and could speak Korean, English, French, German and\n\nJapanese.\n\nAinan Cawley\n\nAinan Celeste Cawley is a Singaporean boy prodigy who, according to his parents, had said his\n\nfirst word when he was two weeks old, could walk at six months of age and build difficult\n\nsentences by his first birthday. Cawley gave his first public speech at the age of six and at seven\n\nyears and one month of age, he had passed the GCSE chemistry and studied chemistry at the\n\nSingapore Polytechnic a year later. At the age of 9, he was able to recite pi to 518 decimal places\n\nand could remember the periodic table.\n\nChristopher Langan\n\nChristopher Michael Langan is an American autodidact who is considered an intellectual prodigy.\n\nABC’s 20/20 estimated that Langan’s IQ is anywhere between 195 and 210 dubbing him what\n\nmost journalists consider as the smartest man in America. Growing up, Christopher Langan\n\nquickly showed above-average skills: he could speak at six months of age, read by his third\n\nbirthday and even question the existence of God by age five. He obtained a perfect score on his\n\nSAT, despite having fallen asleep during the test. He is an avid learner, regardless of the subject,\n\nand can study math, languages and philosophy for long periods of time each day."
