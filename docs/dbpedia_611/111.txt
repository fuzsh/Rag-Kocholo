1. Philip Emeagwali is a computer scientist and mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the fathers of the internet. He played a crucial role in the development of supercomputers and their applications in complex mathematical calculations.

2. Despite being born in Nigeria in 1954, Emeagwali did not receive formal education until the age of 14. Until then, he lived in a remote village and had never attended school. However, his determination and passion for learning pushed him to teach himself basic mathematics and eventually earn a scholarship to study in the United States.

3. Emeagwali's groundbreaking work in computational fluid dynamics led to his achievement of winning the Gordon Bell Prize in 1989. This prestigious prize is awarded for achieving the greatest performance in terms of speed and efficiency in high-performance computing applications.

4. Emeagwali's mathematical abilities are extraordinary, as he can perform mental calculations involving large numbers and complex equations almost instantaneously. He has been referred to as the "human computer" due to his exceptional mental arithmetic skills.
