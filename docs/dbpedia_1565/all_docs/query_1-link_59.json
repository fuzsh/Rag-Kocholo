Read More\n\nObject Lesson: Kintsugi reflects beauty in flaws, strength in healing\n\nMore than 500 years ago, Japanese artists developed a technique that celebrates breakage as a part of life’s journey.

Read More\n\nObject Lesson: America by Will Ryman\n\nWill Ryman’s large-scale sculpture America is a reflection on the industries and economies that built the United States over the past few centuries.
