Life and work

Beese was born in Reisicht, Silesia, Germany (now Rokitki, Tczew County, Poland). As a young adult she first found work as a weaver in Dresden. She attended the Bauhaus school, starting in 1926, where she studied with Josef Albers, Wassily Kandinsky, Joost Schmidt, and Gunta St√∂lzl. Though she enrolled to study weaving, she took classes in photography as well as architecture, changing her career path.

She was one of the first women to join the Bauhaus Department of Architecture in 1927 and the first to study with Hannes Meyer and Hans Wittwer. She continued to work with Meyer after leaving Bauhaus, working at his office in Berlin and later following him to Moscow to work for Mart Stam, whom she would later marry. After moving back to Stam's home in Amsterdam she ran her own architectural firm in the mid-late 1930s. She is best known for her work redeveloping the city of Rotterdam, where among other projects she helped to build the Pendrecht, Alexanderpolder, and Ommoord districts. Later in life she took a job teaching architecture at the Academy of Architecture and Urban Planning in Amsterdam.
