Heaney was born and raised in Bellaghy, County Derry, Northern Ireland.\n\nThe poems published in Heaney's famous 1979 volume 'Field Work' were among the finest he would ever write. Inspired by the four years that the poet and his family spent in Glanmore Cottage in rural County Wicklow after leaving Belfast and the Troubles.\n\n'Throughout the volume Heaney's outstanding gifts, his eye, his ear, his understanding of the poetic language are on display - this is a book we cannot do without' Martin Dodsworth, Guardian"
