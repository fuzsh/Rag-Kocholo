        "text": "Seamus Heaney, the eldest of nine children, is born at the family farmhouse, called Mossbawn, near Castledawson, County Derry.\n\nHe grows up on his father's cattle farm. His father also works as a cattle dealer.\n\nAfter an initial education at Anahorish Primary School, Seamus Heaney wins a scholarship to St Columb's College, then a Catholic boarding school in the city of Derry.\n\nHis four-year old brother Christopher is killed in a road accident. (See Mid-Term Break.)\n\nHis family move to a larger farm in nearby Bellaghy.\n\nDeath of a Naturalist, his first full collection, is published by Faber and Faber. Digging and Mid-Term Break were included in this award winning volume. It earned him the Somerset Maugham Award and the Geoffrey Faber Prize. The celebrated Irish poet Austin Clarke, reviewing it on Radio Eireann said that unlike most first books, this one is mature and certain in its touch.\"\n\nDooor into the Dark, his second collection, published by Faber and Faber. It is the Poetry Book Society Choice for the year.\n\nRequiem for the Croppies, written in 1966 on the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter Rising of 1916, is included.\n\nSeamus Heaney leaves Belfast and moves south to the Republic of Ireland where he is appointed to the Department of English in the teacher training college, Carysfort College. He lives in Glanmore, County Wicklow.\n\nWintering Out, his third collection of poems, is published by Faber and Faber.\n\nElected to the Boylston Chair of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard University, one of the university's most prestigious offices.\n\nDeath of his mother, Margaret Kathleen. (Remembered in the poem, Clearances.)\n\nStation Island, his sixth collection of poems, is published by Faber and Faber.\n\nElected Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford, a post he was to hold for five years. This obliges him to deliver three public lectures every year but does not obluge him to live in Oxford.\n\nDistrict and Circle, his latest collection of poems, is published by Faber and Faber. It is chosen as the Poetry Book Society Choice Summer 2006.\n\nHe suffered a stroke from which he recovered in August 2006, but cancelled all public engagements for several months.\n\nDistrict and Circle wins the T. S. Eliot prize. The Poetry Book Society awards the annual T. S. Eliot Prize for 'the best collection of new verse in English first published in the UK or the Republic of Ireland' in any particular year.\n\nDistrict and Circle wins the Irish Times Poetry Now Award for the best collection by an Irish poet in the past year.\n\nThe Royal Irish Academy announces the award of the 2008 Cunningham Medal to Nobel Laureate and Academy Member, Dr Seamus Heaney in recognition of his exceptional literary and scholarly distinction and achievement. The Cunningham Medal is presented to him at a special ceremony in Academy House on 28 January 2008.\n\nSeamus Heaney becomes artist of honour in Østermarie, Denmark. Seamus Heaney Stræde was therefore named after him in the center of Bornholm, another green island.\n\nStepping Stones: Interviews with Seamus Heaney by Dennis O'Driscoll is published by Faber and Faber.\n\nHe was presented, in March, with the David Cohen prize for literature, an award which is biennial and for a lifetime's achievement; \"...a lovely award,\" said Heaney in accepting it, \"when offered by a panel of such distinguished writers and readers.\"\n\nSeamus Heaney turned 70 years old on 13 April 2009. To recognize and celebrate this event, Ireland's public service braodcaster RTE, supported by a Lannan Foundation grant, has recorded Heaney reading his entire body of work. These recordings, available in both CD and MP3 formats, are distributed by Faber and Faber in Great Britain in association with RTE (who broadcast the recording in Ireland for 24 hours on the birthday itself). This is the only such complete record of Heaney's work.\n\nThe Irish Times produced a special supplement to celebrate his birthday. RTE produced a special television documentary Out of the Marvellous, a fresh and original look at the man and the poet and celebrated the event in numerous radio shows. Many RTE personalities also contributed their own personal responses to his poetry and read from his work.\n\nTranslates the Scottish poet Robert Henryson's The Testament of Cresseid and Seven Fables."
