        "text": "DUBLIN, Ireland -- Seamus Heaney, one of the world’s best-known poets and winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize for literature, died yesterday after a short illness, his family said. He was 74.\n\nHeaney, born in Northern Ireland, was a rarity among poets, having won acclaim from critics while producing best-sellers.\n\nHis poems evoke an Irish country childhood, with images of potato diggers and peat-bog cutters, and echo the deep political splits that have riven the island.\n\nHis works include the 1966 debut Death of a Naturalist, The Spirit Level, District and Circle and an acclaimed translation of the old English epic poem Beowulf.\n\nThe weaving of rural roots and modern realism helped him to become the most acclaimed Irish poet since William Butler Yeats. Heaney was born in the year that Yeats died, and died in Dublin near the house where Yeats was born.\n\nHe found recognition in academic circles, becoming professor of poetry at Oxford University and lecturing at Harvard University, and won the Nobel prize for his “works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth.”"
