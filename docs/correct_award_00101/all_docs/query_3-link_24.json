        "text": "(1939–2013). The Irish poet Seamus Heaney was considered one of the greatest poets writing in English in the 20th century. His Nobel-prizewinning poetry reflected the turbulence of his homeland while simultaneously celebrating the human spirit and the beauty of the natural world.\n\nSeamus Justin Heaney was born on April 13, 1939, in Northern Ireland, the oldest of Margaret and Patrick Heaney’s nine children. He was born on his family’s farm, Mossbawn, which was in County Derry, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Belfast. He grew up in a thatch-roofed home typical of rural Irish homesteads at that time, milking cows and listening to detective stories on the radio. As an adult he described his childhood as “an intimate, physical, creaturely existence in which the night sounds of the horse in the stable beyond one bedroom wall mingled with the sounds of adult conversation from the kitchen beyond the other.”\n\nHeaney attended the local Catholic school Anahorish, where he was first exposed to the writings of John Keats, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Robert Frost, and Geoffrey Chaucer. He later attended a Catholic boarding school, St. Columb’s College in Londonderry. He left for Queen’s College in Belfast when he was 18.\n\nWhile working toward a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, Heaney discovered the poetry of Wilfred Owen, Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell, and Patrick Kavanagh. He became associated with a group of young writers known as the Group and began to publish poetry under the pseudonym Incertus. He graduated in 1961 and went on to earn his teacher’s certificate at St. Joseph’s College in Belfast. In 1963 he took a position as a lecturer in English at St. Joseph’s.\n\nHeaney’s first book, Eleven Poems, was published in 1965, the same year that he married Marie Devlin. The next year his son Michael was born, and Heaney left St. Joseph’s to teach modern English at Queen’s College. His second book, Death of a Naturalist (1966), won several awards, including the Cholmondeley Award in 1967 and the Somerset Maugham Award in 1968. A second son, Christopher, was born in 1968.\n\nDoor in the Dark, published in 1969, was named the Poetry Book Choice of the Year. In 1970 Heaney left Northern Ireland to guest lecture at the University of California at Berkeley, returning home the next year to resign his lectureship at Queen’s College and move to Glanmore in County Wicklow. In 1972 Wintering Out was published.\n\nOne of Heaney’s most celebrated collections, North, appeared in 1975. It won the E.M. Forster Award and Duff Cooper Memorial Prize. Heaney also won the Irish Academy of Letters Award that year. North dealt explicitly with the political and religious conflicts in Northern Ireland and included a poem entitled Casualty, which mourned the loss of a Catholic friend killed by a bomb set by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in a Protestant pub. Although poems like Casualty were inherently political, Heaney’s goal was not to persuade his audience but rather to express the complexity of the situation in poetic language.\n\nHeaney moved to Dublin, Ireland, to teach at Carysfort College in 1975. In 1982 he joined the faculty of Harvard University as visiting professor, and three years later he became full professor. His poetry from this period includes Field Work (1979), Selected Poems (1980), Station Island (1984), and The Haw Lantern (1987). The latter volume included a series of sonnets, Clearances, which Heaney dedicated to his mother, who had died in 1984. Some of his critical writings were collected in Preoccupations: Selected Prose (1980) and The Government of the Tongue: Selected Prose 1978–87 (1988).\n\nHeaney retained his post at Harvard while teaching at the University of Oxford from 1989 to 1994. While at Oxford he published the poetry collection Seeing Things (1991) and a play, The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles’ Philoctetes (1991). These were followed by The Redress of Poetry (1995), a collection of his Oxford lectures, and The Spirit Level (1996), another poetry collection. In Electric Light (2001) and District and Circle (2006), he returned to the Ireland of his youth. The poetry in Human Chain (2010) reflects on death, loss, regret, and memory. Heaney was both critically acclaimed and popular—his books sold by the tens of thousands and his readings drew hundreds of loyal fans, sometimes referred to as “Heaneyboppers.”\n\nHeaney also produced translations, including The Cure at Troy (1991), which is Heaney’s version of Sophocles’ Philoctetes, and The Midnight Verdict (1993), which contains selections from Ovid’s Metamorphoses and from Cúirt an mheán oíche (The Midnight Court), a work by the 18th-century Irish writer Brian Merriman. Heaney’s translation of the Old English epic poem Beowulf (1999) became an unexpected international best seller, while his The Burial at Thebes (2004) gave Sophocles’ Antigone contemporary relevance.\n\nIn 1995 Heaney won the Nobel Prize for Literature. In his Nobel address, “Crediting Poetry,” he claimed the task of the poet was to ensure the survival of beauty. He also credited poetry for its “power to persuade that vulnerable part of our consciousness of its rightness in spite of the evidence of wrongness all around it, the power to remind us that we are hunters and gatherers of values, that our very solitudes and distresses are creditable, in so far as they, too, are an earnest of our veritable human being.” He died on August 30, 2013, in Dublin."
