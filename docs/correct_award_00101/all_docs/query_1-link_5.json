        "text": "Seamus Heaney, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995 “for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past,\" died in 2013. Here, contributor Yvonne Watterson takes a personal look at some of Seamus Heaney's most impactful works.\n\nIreland's poet, Seamus Heaney, died on August 30, 2013, and was buried in Bellaghy. His body was brought home from Dublin to rest next to the grave of his little brother, Christopher, whom many of us know from “Mid-Term Break,” a poem now learned by heart by Irish children in schools north and south of the border.\n\nThe first time I heard \"Mid-Term Break\" was when Brian Baird, the late UTV newscaster, and my beloved Anglo-Irish Literature Tutor at Stranmillis College, read it aloud at a seminar one morning.\n\nIt cleaved my heart open.\n\nHere, Seamus Heaney reads \"Mid-Term Break:\"\n\n\"Mid-Term Break\" by Seamus Heaney\n\nI sat all morning in the college sick bay\n\nCounting bells knelling classes to a close.\n\nAt two o’clock our neighbors drove me home.\n\nIn the porch I met my father crying–\n\nHe had always taken funerals in his stride–\n\nAnd Big Jim Evans saying it was a hard blow.\n\nThe baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram\n\nWhen I came in, and I was embarrassed\n\nBy old men standing up to shake my hand\n\nAnd tell me they were ‘sorry for my trouble,’\n\nWhispers informed strangers I was the eldest,\n\nAway at school, as my mother held my hand\n\nIn hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs.\n\nAt ten o’clock the ambulance arrived\n\nWith the corpse, stanched and bandaged by the nurses.\n\nNext morning I went up into the room. Snowdrops\n\nAnd candles soothed the bedside; I saw him\n\nFor the first time in six weeks. Paler now,\n\nWearing a poppy bruise on his left temple,\n\nHe lay in the four-foot box as in his cot.\n\nNo gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.\n\nA four-foot box, a foot for every year.”\n\nThe young Seamus Heaney wasn’t there when it happened. He was away at school. Just another mundane evening, Christopher and another brother had been sent to the bus stop to give the bus conductor a letter to post in Belfast, as was the way in those days; his mother was at home, hanging clothes out on the line; his other two brothers, Pat and Dan, were walking down the other side of the road, on an errand to fetch paraffin oil.\n\nHeaney tells Dennis O’Driscoll in the book \"Stepping Stones\" that he can hardly bear to think about his little brother, just three and a half, noticing his big brothers on the other side of the road and running out from behind the bus to greet them. The driver of the oncoming car hadn’t a chance, and within only hours, Christopher died at the Mid-Ulster Hospital, in Magherafelt.\n\nChristopher was later buried at St. Mary’s Parish Church. in Bellaghy, where his big brother, Seamus, has been buried too, in the South Derry earth from which his father, Paddy, famously cut turf:\n\nFrom \"Digging\":\n\n“By God, the old man could handle a spade.\n\nJust like his old man.\n\nMy grandfather cut more turf in a day\n\nThan any other man on Toner’s bog.\n\nOnce I carried him milk in a bottle\n\nCorked sloppily with paper. He straightened up\n\nTo drink it, then fell to right away\n\nNicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods\n\nOver his shoulder, going down and down\n\nFor the good turf. Digging.”\n\nHere, Seamus Heaney reads \"Digging:\"\n\nIf you were to ask me to draw a map of my child-world, the one in which I moved before I started school, all Heaney’s places would be marked on it. I belong to those places too, and they are mine: Magherafelt, Bellaghy, Castledawson, the Moyola river, The Moss, Upperlands, The Hillhead, Toomebridge, Cookstown, the Lough shore – and The Broagh – where my mother grew up.\n\nFrom “Broagh”\n\n\". . . Broagh, its low tattoo\n\namong the windy boortrees\n\nand rhubarb-blades\n\nended almost\n\nsuddenly, like that last\n\ngh the strangers found\n\ndifficult to manage. \"\n\nOne of seven children, my mother was reared on a farm not far from the Heaneys. She remembers the man Seamus immortalized in “Digging,” his father, Paddy Heaney, in yellow boots and a heavy coat, trading cattle at the local fairs. She remembers Seamus as well, riding his bicycle, his face against the wind, his sandy hair flying behind him.\n\nAs a young mother, she frequently took me “up home” on the bus from Antrim to the Hillhead and then we would walk the rest of the way along the back road to my grandparent’s house. I still remember being scared of what might be hiding in the shadows of sprawling rhododendron bushes and the beech and alder trees that hung over us, but of course, there was nothing to fear.\n\nAs I grew older and The Troubles boiled, indeed there were other things to be afraid of on the road back to Antrim. Real things, as we wondered silently what lurked behind the questions asked by British soldiers when they stopped my father’s car on our way home. Dimming our lights for them. Answering obediently. Waiting for them to release us onto our roads.\n\nFrom: \"The Toome Road\"\n\n“One morning early I met armored cars\n\nIn convoy, warbling along on powerful tires,\n\nAll camouflaged with broken alder branches,\n\nAnd headphoned soldiers standing up in turrets.\n\nHow long were they approaching down my roads\n\nAs if they owned them?”\n\nBut when I was a little girl, I was oblivious to all of this. I stayed at my grandparents' house in Broagh (Irish for riverbank, bruach), absorbing the rustic, rhythmic speech of the men cutting turf, digging potatoes or baling hay, and the lovely heartsome sighs of my granny as she carried buckets of water in from the pump in the yard and then made milky tea for the men coming in from the fields, men like Big Jim Evans. Forty-five years later, and I can still see her, wiping her elegant hands on a flowery apron, wearing a sunny yellow cardigan and a big indulgent smile for me. How she loved me.\n\n\"1. Mossbawn Sunlight\"\n\nThere was a sunlit absence.\n\nThe helmeted pump in the yard\n\nheated its iron,\n\nwater honeyed\n\nin the slung bucket\n\nand the sun stood\n\nlike a griddle cooling\n\nagainst the wall\n\nof each long afternoon.\n\nSo, her hands scuffled\n\nover the bakeboard,\n\nthe reddening stove\n\nsent its plaque of heat\n\nagainst her where she stood\n\nin a floury apron\n\nby the window.\n\nNow she dusts the board\n\nwith a goose’s wing,\n\nnow sits, broad-lapped,\n\nwith whitened nails\n\nand measling shins:\n\nhere is a space\n\nagain, the scone rising\n\nto the tick of two clocks.\n\nAnd here is love\n\nlike a tinsmith’s scoop\n\nsunk past its gleam\n\nin the meal-bin.”\n\nThere were the long walks with my grandfather, down well-trodden Broagh byways that were wild with bluebells and foxgloves. On warm days, with my hand in his, he took me to McGurk’s shop for sweets and ice-cream sliders. Sometimes we spotted gypsies, or tinkers, as Granda called them, setting up camp. I remember thinking they must live charmed lives in a story-book world, with their tents and their colorful clothes and their caravans and ponies. Then, as now, I grappled with the idea of always being in-between places.\n\nThe men were tinsmiths, hence the name, and one of them, Mr. Sweeney, used to visit my Granny. She made him tea and in exchange, he brought hand-made tins for milking. The older I get, I find myself pausing to appreciate hand-made things, such as those my father still turns over in his hands, things I would have too-quickly dismissed all those years ago.\n\nFrom \"Fosterling\"\n\n“That heavy greenness fostered by water“\n\nJohn Montague\n\n“At school I loved one picture’s heavy greenness -\n\nHorizons rigged with windmills’ arms and sails.\n\nThe millhouses’ still outlines. Their in-placeness\n\nStill more in place when mirrored in canals.\n\nI can’t remember not ever having known\n\nThe immanent hydraulics of a land\n\nOf glar and glit and floods at dailigone.\n\nMy silting hope. My lowlands of the mind.\n\nHeaviness of being. And poetry\n\nSluggish in the doldrums of what happens.\n\nMe waiting until I was nearly fifty\n\nTo credit marvels. Like the tree-clock of tin cans\n\nThe tinkers made. So long for air to brighten,\n\nTime to be dazzled and the heart to lighten.”\n\nI shared with Seamus Heaney the phenomenon of being first in the family to go on to university – to go away to school. \"In Stepping Stones,\" he explains to Dennis O’Driscoll:\n\n\"Even Belfast was far away to me. In those days, I was outside the loop, my family had no familiarity with universities, no sense of the choices that there were, no will to go beyond the known procedures, no confidence, for example, about phoning up the local education authority and seeking clarification about what was possible – no phone, for God’s sake.\"\n\nUniversity education in Belfast was a world away from the Broagh and necessitated a kind of verbal dance with his mother, when he returned from it to the family home, full of new knowledge, new words, and new sensitivities. I can almost picture him – in that tight space between elevated and plain Derry speech, watching every word he says, weighing its impact before he utters it. My mother and I have danced that very dance, her telling me to this day, \"you know all them things.”\n\nFrom \"Clearances IV\"\n\n\"\"Fear of affectation made her affect\n\nInadequacy whenever it came to\n\nPronouncing words ‘beyond her’. Bertold Brek.\n\nShe’d manage something hampered and askew\n\nEvery time, as if she might betray\n\nThe hampered and inadequate by too\n\nWell-adjusted a vocabulary.\n\nWith more challenge than pride, she’d tell me, ‘You\n\nKnow all them things.’ So I governed my tongue\n\nIn front of her, a genuinely well-\n\nAdjusted adequate betrayal\n\nOf what I knew better. I’d naw and aye\n\nAnd decently relapse into the wrong\n\nGrammar which kept us allied and at bay.\n\nThere are other tricky steps to learn as you move through the various dances of Northern Ireland, but once learned, they stay with you for a lifetime. In \"May the Lord in His Mercy be Kind to Belfast,\" based on his interviews with the people who live there, Tony Parker makes an unsettling but astute observation that those born and brought up in Northern Ireland have this mutual need to know, right from the start, about a person’s background, so they can proceed in the dialogue, in the longer relationship, without saying the wrong thing, “the wrong word.” The schools we attended, our last names, the housing estates where we lived, the way we pronounce an “H” or an “A,” all became clues to help establish “who we are.”\n\n“Derry” or “Londonderry?” “The Troubles,” “the struggle, or “The Irish Question?” “Ulster” or “The Six Counties?” I remember the first day of my teaching practice in a Rathcoole classroom, when one of the pupils, showing off, asked me if I was a “Taig,” a derogatory word for a Roman Catholic. He thought I was “by the look of me,” but he had his doubts. My surname was Protestant, and my first name, Yvonne, could have been Catholic. How should I answer, knowing where I was and who I was?\n\nFrom \"Whatever You Say, Say Nothing\"\n\n“The famous Northern reticence,\n\nthe tight gag of place\n\nAnd times: yes, yes. Of the “wee six” I sing\n\nWhere to be saved you only must save face\n\nAnd whatever you say, you say nothing.\n\nSmoke-signals are loud-mouthed compared with us:\n\nManeuverings to find out name and school,\n\nSubtle discrimination by addresses\n\nWith hardly an exception to the rule\n\nThat Norman, Ken and Sidney signalled Prod\n\nAnd Seamus (call me Sean) was sure-fire Pape.\n\nO land of password, handgrip, wink and nod,\n\nOf open minds as open as a trap.”\n\nHere, Seamus Heaney reads \"Whatever You Say, Say Nothing:\"\n\nArtfully, we balance these two worlds, at once straddling the one that made us and that stretching far out in front of us, unknown. Far out. With age, I find myself turning inward and back to that first, to the Northern Ireland that made me and filled me up with questions and doubts.\n\nYet, at the same time, on an August evening when I’m alone in the car, a Phoenix sky a-tremble with gunmetal thunder-heads, I look intentionally homeward to the vast and too-bright spaces of the Arizona desert:\n\nFrom \"Known World\"\n\n\"\"Were we not made for summer, shade and coolness\n\nAnd gazing trough an open door at sunlight?\n\nFor paradise lost? Is that what I was taught?\n\nWhatever I am made for, I am sad that there will be no new words from Seamus Heaney to help me get there, that he has gone back to his first place just when I need him most.\n\nFrom \"Anahorish\"\n\nMy ‘place of clear water,’\n\nthe first hill in the world\n\nwhere springs washed into\n\nthe shiny grass\n\nand darkened cobbles\n\nin the bed of the lane.\n\nAnahorish, soft gradient\n\nof consonant, vowel-meadow,\n\nafter-image of lamps\n\nswung through the yards\n\non winter evenings.\n\nWith pails and barrows\n\nthose mound-dwellers\n\ngo waist-deep in mist\n\nto break the light ice\n\nat wells and dunghills.\n\n*Originally published in 2014, updated in 2022."
