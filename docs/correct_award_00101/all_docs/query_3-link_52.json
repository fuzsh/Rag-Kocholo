        "text": "Seamus Heaney, the Irish poet whose verse captured the transcendent power, darkness and humanity of his conflicted homeland, died Thursday at a hospital in Dublin. He was 74.\n\nHis death was announced in a statement released by his family and his publisher, Faber and Faber. The cause was not disclosed, but he was in failing health after a stroke in 2006.\n\nIn accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995, Heaney acknowledged another Irish Nobel laureate, William Butler Yeats, and the power of Yeats’ verse to define an Ireland beyond the violence of its independence almost a century ago.\n\nHeaney came to give voice to another period of upheaval that defined his native province of Ulster for much of his 50-year writing career.\n\nThe poet Robert Lowell called Heaney the greatest Irish poet since Yeats. The poet Paul Muldoon, a student of Heaney’s in the 1960s, said his mentor was “actually the most popular Irish poet ever,” although Heaney would have been indifferent to such ranking.\n\nIn 1999, Heaney’s translation of the Anglo-Saxon epic “Beowulf” became an international bestseller.\n\nEnda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, said in a statement that “there are no words to describe adequately our nation’s and poetry’s grief at the passing of Seamus Heaney.”\n\nSeamus Justin Heaney was born April 13, 1939, into a Catholic farming family in rural Northern Ireland. His father kept and traded cattle; his mother raised nine children, of which Seamus was the oldest, in a thatched cottage. His boyhood presented abiding images that ran keenly through his work.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Marie; three children, Christopher, Michael and Catherine Ann; five brothers; and three grandchildren."
