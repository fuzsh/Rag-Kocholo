        "text": "Obituary\n\nThe Irish writer and poet Seamus Heaney, who won the 1995 Nobel Prize in Literature, has died at the age of 74, his family said.\n\nHeaney was widely regarded as the greatest Irish poet since William Butler Yeats, who like Heaney was a recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nHeaney was awarded his Nobel prize \"for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past\".\n\n\"The death has taken place of Seamus Heaney,\" a short statement issued on behalf of the family said.\n\n\"The poet and Nobel laureate died in hospital in Dublin this morning after a short illness. The family has requested privacy at this time.\"\n\nFuneral arrangements are to be announced later.\n\nNorthern Ireland-born Heaney published his first major collection of poems, Death of a Naturalist, in 1966 and went on to become one of the English language's leading poets.\n\nTwo years ago, he donated a large collection of his literary papers to the National Library of Ireland.\n\nAlthough wary of being compared to Yeats – who died in 1939, the year Heaney was born – he acknowledged his kinship with a compatriot who also dug deep into ancient Irish traditions while reflecting his country's modern conflicts.\n\nSeamus Heaney was born on April 13, 1939 into a Catholic farming family in County Derry, Northern Ireland. His father was a farmer, while his mother's family had been workers in the local linen industry.\n\nThe eldest of nine children, Seamus grew up on the family farm of Mossbawm, before becoming a boarder at St Columb's College in the city of Derry, where he studied both Latin and Gaelic.\n\nHe went on to take English language and literature at Queen's University in Belfast, which became his home until 1972 and where he came under the influence of the British writer and teacher Philip Hobsbaum, who helped confirm his vocation as a poet.\n\nHis first published work was Eleven Poems in 1965, the year in which he married Marie Devlin, a fellow writer about whom he penned some of his finest poems and with whom he had two sons and a daughter.\n\nOther collections include Death of a Naturalist (1966), Door into the Dark (1969), North (1975), The Haw Lantern (1987), Seeing Things (1991), The Spirit Level (1996) and District and Circle (2006).\n\nIn 1972, at the height of the violence involving British troops and Catholic and Protestant paramilitaries over Northern Ireland's status, Heaney moved to Dublin, which was to be his home base for the rest of his life.\n\nAfter a spell devoted only to writing, he resumed teaching activities in 1975, speaking as a guest lecturer in US universities and in Britain.\n\nBetween 1989 and 1994 he held the coveted post of Professor of Poetry at Oxford University.\n\nThe following year he became the fourth Irish writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, the three others having been Yeats (1923), George Bernard Shaw (1925) and Samuel Beckett (1969).\n\nIn March 2009, Heaney was awarded the David Cohen Prize for Literature for his lifetime of work.\n\n\"For the last 40-odd years, Heaney's poems have crystallised the story of our times, in language which has bravely and memorably continued to extend its imaginative reach,\" said Andrew Motion, Britain's then-poet laureate and the chairman of the judges.\n\n\"At the same time, his critical writing, his translations and his lecturing have invigorated the whole wider world of poetry.\"\n\nIn 2003 the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry was opened at Queen's University, housing a unique record of Heaney's entire works.\n\nLoading"
