        "text": "The poems in Seamus Heaney’s Human Chain contain tones and phrases that are perfectly tuned; they are true to memory and loss, and somehow miraculously they also manage to offer a vision of what is above or beyond the mere facts. The feeling is elegiac but also loosened and buoyant. Memory in these poems is filled with tones of regret and undertones of anguish, but it can also appear in cadences of hard-won wonder. There is an active urge in the rhythms of these poems to capture the living breath of things; sometimes the breath is hushed, and other times wise and resigned in its way of holding rhythms in and then releasing them. In the most ambitious poem, Heaney wanders in the shadow of Virgil’s Aeneid, making his own journey in memory across Northern Ireland, allowing images and recollections in all their sonorous beauty to hit sharply against the sense of a time that has past, and can be recovered now in ways which are controlled but insistent in these poems.\n\nviii\n\nAs one when the month is young sees a new moon\n\nFading into daytime, again it is her face\n\nAt the dormer window, her hurt still new.\n\nMy look behind me hurried as I unlock,\n\nSwitch on, rev up, pull out and drive away\n\nIn the car she’ll not have taken her eyes off,\n\nThe brakelights flicker-flushing at the corner\n\nLike red lamps swung by RUC patrols\n\nIn the small hours on pre-Troubles roads\n\nAfter dances, after our holdings on\n\nAnd holdings back, the necking\n\nAnd nay-saying age of impurity."
