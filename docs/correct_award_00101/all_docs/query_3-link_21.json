        "text": "I first found Heaney’s work in a collection called Wintering Out, in my Grandmother’s house. I was very young, and it is probably the first book of poetry I ever read. It was a slim book, with the first few pages unstuck, and it was filled with cryptic language. It was concerned with rural Ireland at a time when I wasn’t even sure what the countryside was.\n\nA child tries to map out geography as well as time. Learning about where you are, and when you are is one of the first thing we try to discover, perhaps long before who we are.\n\nBack then, Ireland was at the height of the Celtic Tiger, an economic boom. Riverdance and the Irish football team’s success seemed to herald our arrival into a larger world.\n\nI remember Bill Clintons visit. And staying up for New Years 1995. But I grew up in the city. Heaney’s work was strange to me, like those long trips in the car down the country into another world. Trying to understand.\n\nToday marks the 10 year anniversary of Seamus Heaney’s death. Every time I read him, I’m brought back to that early encounter with his poetry.\n\nSeamus Heaney was born on April 13th 1939 in Mossbawn, Co. Derry. He was one of nine children to Margaret and Partick Heaney. Margaret was a farmer and Patrick a cattle dealer. The house Seamus grew up in was a one-story, thatched and white-washed house, surrounded by a bank with Alder trees. He very conscious of the sounds of busses and traffic passing nearby. His mother would get the bus at the stop at the end of the lane, taking her the mile and a half or so into town.\n\nMany of Heaney’s poems are filled with memories of growing up at Mossbawn. He began writing in 1957 under the pseudonym Incertus, the Latin word for uncertain. Death Of A Naturalist, his first book, in particular has a lot of poems about his coming of age.\n\nDigging is one of his most well-known poems. It explores three generations of Heaney’s family. Under his window, the poet hears the sound of his Father digging. In this poem time is shifting, his father is strained, working very hard.\n\nHe “bends low, and comes up twenty years away.”\n\nHeaney talks about the tools we use, and appreciates the graft;\n\n“By God the old man could handle a spade, just like his old man.”\n\n“My grandfather cut more turf in a day\n\nThan any other man at Toner’s bog.”\n\nThe poem has a meditative quality to it, varying between longer and shorter lines of iambic pentameter and tetrameter. The images grow deeper, and sensory detail like “the cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap of soggy peat” makes it feel like either the poet, or his father is digging into another world. Reader and poet are being drawn into the past as if it were a kind of Megalith.\n\nIt’s also a realisation about the kind of work Heaney is going to do:\n\n“Between my finger and my thumb,\n\nThe squat pen rests,\n\nSnug as a gun.”\n\nThat opening image suggests that in some way a pen can be as dangerous as any other tool. Heaney decides that he is going to dig with it.\n\nIt’s a striking poem. Like a lot of his early poems, it contains a kernel of everything he would go on to write, and it’s almost from the perspective of a child.\n\nI cannot describe what an impression poems like this must have made on me. Certainly I didn’t understand them. When I got older, I started reading poetry seriously, and it was only then I came back to Heaney’s work.\n\nI remember being struck all over again when I read North, a collection of poetry that features some of his most interesting imagery. Much of the collection is an archaeological dig into the roots of violence, bringing the past up into the present. It was also inspired by , The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved a book with photos of mummified remains found in the bog.\n\nThe Tollund Man; opens with the line:\n\n“Someday I will Go to Aarhus.\n\nTo see his peat-brown head.”\n\nThe reader can almost see Tollund Man, the bog-preserved corpse of a man who died in the 5th century BC, coming across the expanse of time and space to visit Heaney, just as much as the other way round.\n\nPunishment is deals with violence and ritual sacrifice. Not so much of the kind which is done in the name of ancient deities, but that which is carried out under the guise of being for the good of the community. Heaney is struck by the body of the Windeby Girl, found in 1952 in Germany, who seems to have been ritually killed.\n\n“I can feel the tug\n\nOf the halter at the nape\n\nOf her neck, the wind\n\nOn her naked front”\n\nHeaney considers that she may have been killed for adultery, or for loving the wrong person. whatever the case, it is clear to him that she was a scapegoat.\n\nIt’s very easy when we look into the past to imagine ourselves living in tribal conflicts and historical events, of course being the ones to cry out and protest against what’s happening. We wonder how did the people of a certain era think the way they did, or allow evils to happen without raising their voice? Surely we would speak out against it?\n\nHeaney notes the power of ritual, and of a herd mentality, it’s power to silence and to enforce:\n\nI almost love you\n\nBut would have cast, I know\n\nThe stones of silence.”\n\nIt’s a self-admonishment, but it’s honest. He talks about “conniving in civilised outrage,” pretending as we so often do to be shocked at violence and feeling the need to denounce it in some genteel way, but lying to ourselves and pretending not to know and understand “the exact and tribal, intimate revenge”.\n\nThe way Heaney drew me in to his poetry first as a child, and then in my own more formative years, coming out of secondary school, has stayed with me even at times when I’ve stopped reading poetry. Once you’ve read some of the bog poems, and perhaps looked up the photographs of these remains, you see how Heaney was unearthing something very deep, and yet always with us, that has never really went away.\n\nJust as so many of his poems are concenred with memory, I think his writing allowed me to understand more about my own memories, whether it was growing up, or being afraid of things. Listening to things from a childs perspective.\n\nMost importantly that inertia I often felt in myself, looking at the past. How far away it seemed, and how gigantic.\n\nIn Heaney’s work I see how these experiences are not things which have no value, but can be unearthed, repositioned and delved into again.\n\nIn his final book, Human Chain, Heaney wrote about how he had lost the ability to see these things as ordinary, and to take them for granted.\n\nIt was as if they were becoming stronger and more impactful, more startling. He urges us to be aware of the wonder of life:\n\n“Had I not been awake I would have missed it,\n\nA wind that rose and whirled”\n\nI was ultimate saddened to learn of his passing. And it still feels to me like it wasn’t very long ago, just as that first encounter with his work, and my own childhood, all seem very near to me the longer time goes on."
