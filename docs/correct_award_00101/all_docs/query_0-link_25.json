        "text": "I was recently recently reading through a poetry book and came across a fascinating poem called The Tollund Man by a gorgeous young man named Seamus. I was wondering if anyone else had heard of him, I would love to know your views, particularly on this piece!\n\nDespite all, I still do not like his poetry. For me Tollund Man is one of his more tolerable pieces, but none of his work gets anywhere near my anthology of my favourite poems.\n\nSadly no longer a 'gorgeous young man': he died in 2013, leaving a wonderful collection and variety of works. Thanks for drawing my attention to this thoughtful poem. I then was drawn to visit other web sites about prehistoric bodies found preserved in peat. nannymeya, I hope you follow this up with some of his other poems.\n\nProbably one of our most famous Irish poets. He was one of my tutors at Queen's University, Belfast. He was a lovely man, a real gentleman and not up himself at all. Have drunk a few pints with him in my time. He used to run some of his poetry ideas past us students for feedback. He was researching the Bog People at the time when writing Tolland Man and had us (his tutor group) enthused and fascinated.\n\nHe was a specialist in Yeats and Anglo Saxon poetry, and is well known for his translation of the famous Anglo Saxon poem, Beowolf.\n\nI love his poetry, clever working of language but accessible too.\n\nI was just saying the same thing annodomini when I saw you have already said it. I'm not that knowledgeable about poetry and the first time I read Mid Term Break was a year or so ago while on a course at City Lit. I believe it reflected an incident in Seamus Heaney's own childhood, which makes the last few lines especially heart-rending."
