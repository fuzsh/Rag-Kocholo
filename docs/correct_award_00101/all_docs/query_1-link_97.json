        "text": "Here in the UK, many children will study Heaney’s poems like ‘Digging’ or ‘Death of a Naturalist’ in school. When did you first encounter Heaney’s poetry and what prompted you to follow it further as a researcher?\n\nLooking back on my early encounters with Heaney’s poetry, I realize that I actually met his work and his word-mastery indirectly so to speak – without acknowledging his authorship. This instance I am talking about was reading Beowulf in his translation as an undergraduate student in a survey course on Old English Literature. This actually happened back at Olomouc University in the Czech Republic where I originally come from. This must have been in the late 1990s and, as you can see, his work had reached a high renown and circulation way beyond Ireland.\n\nSpeaking of his international reputation, I would like to also mention that quite a few of his collections have been translated into Czech and they keep coming out in very, as far as I can judge, sensitive, attentive and verbally fresh translations. Just before leaving for Canada this fall, I bought Human Chain published by Argo in 2018. Reading this collection, which was Heaney’s twelfth and last, in Czech translation made me really happy and I am sure Heaney would have loved the layering and resonance of several languages and cultural contexts brought together in this way.\n\nMy paper in Postgraduate English has grown out of my more mature appreciation of Heaney’s work, especially his later poetics, which was inspired and cultivated in one of my graduate seminars at the University of Victoria taught by Dr. Magdalena Kay. She has published quite a bit on Heaney’s work and is supremely attuned to the various tonalities of his poetics. Encountering Heaney in “Digging” and “Death of a Naturalist” should be just a beginning of a much longer and more exciting journey. So please read beyond your curriculum!\n\nIn your article for Postgraduate English you explore one particular poem within his 1991 collection Seeing Things. We’ll come to that shortly, but first where does Seeing Things sit generally within Heaney’s work? Four years after publishing the collection he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, so is this a high point of Heaney’s writing?\n\nThis is a very important question to ask and, as I mentioned earlier, to really understand and appreciate Heaney’s writing as well as his personal and aesthetic development, one needs to follow quite closely the various stages he was going – or writing – through. He repeatedly mentioned the essential need to transform and reassess his vision and practice especially as he started approaching his more mature years. In his poem “Settle Bed”, he writes:\n\nwhatever is given\n\nCan always be reimagined.\n\nI believe that this principle motivated and critically illuminated his whole writing career.\n\nHis collection Seeing Things (1991), perfectly performs and embodies this deeply felt need and imperative of Heaney’s for revisiting, reassessing and transforming. His journey towards a more airy and translucent expression regarding the inherited elements of his Irish identity had already started in Haw Lantern, a collection published in 1987 and one which baffled quite a few readers. A slim volume but in many respects a rebirth if this is not a too strong word to use. Recognizing the new awareness coming into fore and verbal surface in this collection, Seeing Things can be seen as a most organic continuation and intensification of this process. Approaching his fiftieth year, Heaney revisits the spiritual and physical terrain of his earlier life and recasts this rich experience into shimmering yet tight poems in ‘Squarings’. This exciting relocation ultimately results in a new faith and aesthetic confidence in Heaney and, I would dare to add, in a wider appeal of his poetry which is opening up to an ever more humanist and universal feeling. In my understanding, it was this undisputable fact which got recognized in the award of the Nobel Prize to the poet in 1995.\n\nTell us more about ‘Squarings’, then, the poem you focus on in your article. It seems a bit unusual to look at just one, albeit lengthy, poem from a longer collection. What makes this particularly interesting?\n\nIt is true that ‘Squarings’ is just one poem. However, to be more accurate, I prefer talking about it as a sequence or a long poem. It is in fact, as a series of forty-eight pieces, quite a monumental work. Translated into the language of prose, this would be a long short-story or a novella. Actually, I used the adjective ‘monumental’ but I would like to also make clear that I do not mean this in the sense of being monolithic and weighty. The sequence fascinates me so much, and it still does even after all that I have written about it, because of its incredible subtlety of expression and tentativeness of statement.\n\nSo to go back to your question, it is this exciting double nature of boldness and achievement occupying the whole second half of Seeing Things, and its delicacy of treatment of its material, this air of almost provisionality attached to it, which immensely attracted me and urged me to try and see if these qualities could and should be scrutinized any further. What followed was for me an unforgettable journey through a territory where the solidity of a rock and a quarry was as real and palpable as the touch of the shimmering light and a falling shadow of a cloud passing. I might have experienced something of the feeling which Heaney experienced drafting the sequence and which he later described as the freedom of “a kid skimming stones” and moving between the poems as “skittering and frittering across water”.\n\nYou make it sound like an almost physical encounter! Can you describe a bit more about how this feeling of being on a ‘journey’ is created through the poem’s form on the page?\n\nThe poem has the stanzaic form of the douzain – which stripped of its French coating means quite simply “a twelve-liner”, a poem of twelve lines. This seems to have quite an interesting history and what I would call “an assertive emergence” in terms of Heaney’s personal handling of it. He remembers discovery of this form and this particular line-count as a wonderful and ultimately boldening accident. After producing one, he suddenly felt it totally appropriate for the shape and quality of things he embarked upon expressing. He later commented that the space and logic of the douzain “felt given, strange and unexpected”.\n\nReading the resulting sequence as a whole, this is exactly the overall sensation conveyed here. In the twelve lines of individual douzains he found the perfect medium, pitch and just the perfect balance between freedom and stricture, between his individual search for meaning and a more traditional resonance.\n\nWithout going into further details, I would just like to mention the important fact that working within this idiosyncratic form Heaney is very subtly negotiating the inheritance of Dante’s terza rima as well as the long history of the sonnet. In his handling, the douzain proves fascinatingly pliable, absorbent and ultimately accommodating to the rich variety of emotional and spiritual movements within the individual pieces. The four three-line stanzas in each individual poem enter a surprising variety of relationships – there is analogy and parallel at work as well as powerful contrast and often an open-ended tonality. As readers, we “skitter and fritter,” carried on by this liberated form through forty-eight poems in total. The whole sequence consists of four sections, each containing twelve douzains. The resulting pattern is a more or less perfect “squaring” of twelve lines by twelve poems in each section, four sections “squaring” up the total. But I would add a warning here – let’s not make mathematical fascination outshine the metaphysics and aesthetics of Heaney’s exploration.\n\nEven without knowing the poem itself, ‘Squarings’ seems a suggestive title: the squaring or alignment of a piece of joinery; facing up to someone or something; trying to reconcile a conflict, as in squaring the circle. What themes or motivations lie behind the poem?\n\nI completely agree – ‘Squarings’ is an immensely suggestive and thought-provoking title and not only in formal and technical terms as have been emphasized. To me, this word offers a key to unlock the numerous interpretative potentialities of Heaney’s sequence. However, saying that, one has to be constantly alert to the fact that to truly engage in this poetic squaring means a constant renegotiation and shifting beyond any preconceived ideas we might have in connection with this term. The re-imagination of the given which we mentioned earlier, quoting the poet’s own philosophy, operates in this sequence at its most intense. And, in the end, we might always end up out-imagined by the words and images – but that’s ultimately the most reinvigorating experience for us as readers, isn’t it?\n\nJust to provide a bit more of a concrete guidance regarding the act of squaring, Heaney refers to the game of marbles he remembers so well from his childhood in arrestingly acute mental and bodily terms in poem iii. Here he mentions the “anglings, aimings, feints and squints / You were allowed before you’d shoot”. It is this intuitive multiplicity of strategies he employs in the sequence of his forty-eight poems, or forty-eight envisaged shots, which he uses to engage with various topics of concern in his fifties. I am afraid I can never do justice to this variety here, but what I try to accentuate in my paper is the revisiting aspect of his writing at this point. After the death of his parents a couple of years before drafting this sequence, he is re-evaluating various aspects and givens of his previous life including his sense of belonging, his relationship to the physical land and its imprint in the geography of his mind, his spiritual allegiance and idiosyncrasies of his faith, his way of wielding the medium of language in service of all this demanding squaring. In doing so, he is both subtle and bold, slightly shaken and surprised yet searching and longing for authentic experience of enchantment and deeper understanding.\n\nHeaney wrote that ‘a good poem allows you to have your feet on the ground and your head in the air simultaneously’. What did he mean by this? Does this provide a measure of what makes ‘Squarings’ a ‘good’ poem for you, or is there something else going on too?\n\nI am really glad that you bring up this fascinating quote which to me comments beautifully on one of the most admirable and lasting qualities of Heaney’s mature poetry. I have mentioned the arc of his development earlier when he moves so emphatically beyond his early identity as the poet of the physical and material, a kind of a naturalist or an archaeologist, to blend elements both earthly and let’s say ethereal in his later years.\n\nIn ‘Squarings’, this synthesis becomes of central importance and can be detected, in a way, as the modus operandi. It is also important to add that the poet mediates between these orders of things in intensely private and inward terms. I see this increasing tendency toward the preoccupation with one’s soul and consciousness as a defining quality and source of appeal of the sequence.\n\nIn my essay, I try to present this individual inner territory as the junction point for the endless interplay and organic interlocking between the physical and the immaterial. And Heaney is a master of capturing these instances. I hope that I can do at least some justice to this realization in my paper. To expand on the idea of synthesis a bit further, not only does he bring together elements physical (chemical almost) and transcendent (as if to look into the space between the atoms and harness some of its quality), but also a sense of temporal flow (in some of his memories and quasi-narratives) and aspects that are atemporal and out of time (in more meditative passages). Sensing this supreme combination of seemingly opposing forces has brought me to conclude that all the mentioned qualities shaping human existence convert in the end in the medium of language which is at once material and immaterial, locked in time and free from it. I believe that Heaney found a tremendous liberation in this fact while drafting the sequence, and making the territory of consciousness his prime focus he could commit himself to the act of writing of poetry with new boldness transcending any bounds of political partisanship. I suggest that this must have been immensely reinvigorating to the poet who was so constantly preoccupied with the legitimacy of writing in the divided Irish society.\n\nWhat’s your own favourite line or image?\n\nI am afraid that there are too many images and lines I have grown fond of to be mentioned here. In fact, each of the individual douzains presents an image or a turn of a line of haunting intensity and resonating beauty as Heaney translates his insights and intimations into the space of the twelve lines. There is a whole world and history alive in the sequence as his references run through many centuries of (not only) Western literature for instance, and his territory covers not only his native island but also a Scandinavian legend or the American West Coast as seen from the bus window and so on.\n\nBut there are two images I would like to focus on a bit more in detail as they carry a special resonance in terms of their profound humanist and visionary quality.\n\nThe first one is presented in poem vi. It tells a brief anecdote about Thomas Hardy who as a boy found himself lying in the field among cattle and “experimenting with infinity” as he was trying to communicate with the vast expanse of heaven above him and, in a way, awaited the signal from the higher order. This impulse does not expressly come, only the herd is stirred slightly, but this intense act of the mind creates what Heaney describes:\n\nas a ripple that would travel eighty years\n\nOutward from there, to be the same ripple ~\n\nInside him at its last circumference.\n\nI find this image of the inner working of the inspiration and spiritual continuity in oneself particularly striking.\n\nThe second image is, I think, quite well-known and often quoted in connection with the sequence. It comes in poem viii and tells the apocryphal story of the monks of Clonmacnoise who saw a ship suddenly sailing in through the church roof while they were at their prayers. I really recommend reading this douzain in its entirety as it is very direct, simple in its diction but creates a whole new perspective of looking upon miracles in our lives. I actually read this particular poem as presenting a space in mind where disparate phenomena might powerfully interlock (as the ship’s anchor gets stuck inside the church for a few moments) in order to transform the way we experience the marvelous and the way we are able to articulate such experience. I also love the etymological ripples at work here – “a nave” and “a ship” come from a shared semantic centre.\n\nRead Lucie Kotesovska’s article Immanent Spirituality and Legitimacy of Poetry in Seamus Heaney’s ‘Squarings’ for free in our open access Postgraduate English journal."
