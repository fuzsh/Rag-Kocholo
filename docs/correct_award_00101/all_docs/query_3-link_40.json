He was 74.\n\nHeaney’s family and publisher, Faber & Faber, said in a statement that Heaney died in a Dublin hospital. He had been recuperating from a stroke since 2006.\n\nThe Northern Ireland-born Heaney was widely considered Ireland’s greatest poet since William Butler Yeats. He wrote 13 collections of poetry, two plays, four prose works on the process of poetry, and many other works.\n\nHeaney was the third Irishman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, joining Yeats and Samuel Beckett.\n\nThe eldest of eight children, Heaney went to Catholic boarding school in Northern Ireland’s second-largest town, Londonderry.\n\nLife in 1950s Londonderry — where Catholics outnumbered Protestants two to one but were gerrymandered from power — provided Heaney his first real taste of injustice and ambiguity Irish-style.\n\nHis early work was rooted in vivid description of rural experience, but gradually he wedded this to the frictions, deceptions and contradictions rife of his divided homeland.\n\nIn 1972, the most deadly year of Northern Ireland’s conflict, Heaney left Queen’s University in Belfast to settle in the Republic of Ireland. That year, he published “Wintering Out,” a collection of poems that offered only oblique references to the unrest in the north.\n\nHis follow-up 1975 collection, “North,” captured the Irish imagination with his pitch-perfect sense of the evils of sectarianism.\n\nFuneral arrangements were not immediately announced."
