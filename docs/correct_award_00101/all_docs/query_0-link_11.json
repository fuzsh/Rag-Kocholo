        "text": "Stream Heaney's Nobel Lecture in the player below.\n\nHe had long staked his claim to that place, beginning his body of work as a poet, writer and playwright in the 1960s.\n\nHeaney's 1966 breakthrough collection of poems, Death of a Naturalist, helped bring him to national and worldwide attention, a collection of 34 poems that brought to vivid life Heaney's childhood experiences in rural Ireland.\n\nIt set the tone for a decades-long body of work praised for its clarity, imagery, emotional grounding and perspective, placing the poet's output as a staple in the study of poetry in the English language.\n\nHe was recognised for his gifts and contributions to his artform in his lifetime, achieving national-treasure status in the literary community at home\n\nParallel to this, Heaney pursued a distinguished career as an academic, starting at St. Joseph's College and culminating in professorships and residencies in Harvard and Oxford universities, with academic John Sutherland, calling him \"the greatest poet of our age\".\n\nTo mark the occasion, here are ten excerpts selected from poems across his body of work and correspondence.\n\nPoetry as contemplation and self-reflection\n\nI rhyme\n\nTo see myself, to set the darkness echoing.\n\n- from 'Personal Helicon', Eleven Poems, 1965\n\nON THE POET AND THE WORKING MAN:\n\nThe cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap\n\nOf soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge\n\nThrough living roots awaken in my head.\n\nBut I've no spade to follow men like them.\n\nBetween my finger and my thumb\n\nThe squat pen rests.\n\nI'll dig with it.\n\n- from 'Digging', Death of a Naturalist, 1966\n\nON MAINTAINING A BALANCE:\n\nGod is a foreman with certain definite views\n\nWho orders life in shifts of work and leisure.\n\n- from 'Docker', Death of a Naturalist, 1966\n\nON THE FLEETING NATURE OF THINGS:\n\nOnce off the bush\n\nThe fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour.\n\nI always felt like crying.\n\nIt wasn't fair\n\nThat all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot.\n\nEach year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not.\n\n- from 'Blackberry Picking', Death of a Naturalist, 1966\n\nON MOTIVES TO CREATE:\n\nThe main thing is to write for the joy of it.\n\nCultivate a work-lust that imagines its haven like your hands at night, dreaming the sun in the sunspot of a breast.\n\nYou are fasted now, light-headed, dangerous.\n\nTake off from here.\n\n- from 'Station Island', 1989\n\nURGING HOPE, AND CITED BY LEADERS:\n\nHistory says don't hope\n\nOn this side of the grave.\n\nBut then, once in a lifetime\n\nThe longed for tidal wave\n\nOf justice can rise up\n\nAnd hope and history rhyme.\n\n- from 'Doubletake', The Cure at Troy, 1990\n\nRead by US President Joe Biden in 2020, as part of his electoral campaign.\n\nWHAT IT COMES DOWN TO:\n\nAnyone with gumption and a sharp mind will take the measure of two things: what's said and what's done.\n\n- from Heaney's 1999 reinterpretation of Middle-English epic Beowulf\n\nON HIS WORK'S MUSICALITY:\n\n\"I don't mean sound as decoration or elaboration, but the actual cadence that moves the thing along.\"\n\n- from one of Heaney's interviews with author Dennis O'Driscoll, as published in his book Stepping Stones, 2009.\n\nLAST WORDS:\n\n\"Noli timere.\"\n\n- Heaney's reported last words, translating as 'Don't be afraid', in a text message to his wife, August 2013.\n\nWORDS TO LIVE BY:\n\nWalk on air against your better judgement.\n\n- from The Gravel Walks, The Spirit Level, published in 1996. Cited in his 1995 Nobel speech, and adorning his gravestone in Bellaghy, Northern Ireland."
