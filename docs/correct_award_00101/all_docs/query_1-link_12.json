        "text": "Seamus Heaney\n\nPoetry\n\nMossbawn\n\nFor Mary Heaney\n\nI. Sunlight\n\nThere was a sunlit absence.\n\nThe helmeted pump in the yard\n\nheated its iron,\n\nwater honeyed\n\nin the slung bucket\n\nand the sun stood\n\nlike a griddle cooling\n\nagainst the wall\n\nof each long afternoon.\n\nSo, her hands scuffled\n\nover the bakeboard,\n\nthe reddening stove\n\nsent its plaque of heat\n\nagainst her where she stood\n\nin a floury apron\n\nby the window.\n\nNow she dusts the board\n\nwith a goose’s wing,\n\nnow sits, broad-lapped,\n\nwith whitened nails\n\nand measling shins:\n\nhere is a space\n\nagain, the scone rising\n\nto the tick of two clocks.\n\nAnd here is love\n\nlike a tinsmith’s scoop\n\nsunk past its gleam\n\nin the meal-bin.\n\nBy Seamus Heaney\n\nFrom “North”, 1975\n\nCopyright © Seamus Heaney\n\nThe Haw Lantern\n\nThe wintry haw is burning out of season,\n\ncrab of the thorn, a small light for small people,\n\nwanting no more from them but that they keep\n\nthe wick of self-respect from dying out,\n\nnot having to blind them with illumination.\n\nBut sometimes when your breath plumes in the frost\n\nit takes the roaming shape of Diogenes\n\nwith his lantern, seeking one just man;\n\nso you end up scrutinized from behind the haw\n\nhe holds up at eye-level on its twig,\n\nand you flinch before its bonded pith and stone,\n\nits blood-prick that you wish would test and clear you,\n\nBy its pecked-at ripeness that scans you, then moves on.\n\nBy Seamus Heaney\n\nFrom “The Haw Lantern”, 1987\n\nCopyright © Seamus Heaney\n\nLightenings viii\n\nThe annals say: when the monks of Clonmacnoise\n\nWere all at prayers inside the oratory\n\nA ship appeared above them in the air.\n\nThe anchor dragged along behind so deep\n\nIt hooked itself into the altar rails\n\nAnd then, as the big hull rocked to a standstill,\n\nA crewman shinned and grappled down the rope\n\nAnd struggled to release it. But in vain.\n\n‘This man can’t bear our life here and will drown,’\n\nThe abbot said, ‘unless we help him.’ So\n\nThey did, the freed ship sailed, and the man climbed back\n\nOut of the marvellous as he had known it.\n\nSeamus Heaney – Selected Poems by Seamus Heaney\n\nFrom “Seeing Things”, 1991\n\nCopyright © Seamus Heaney\n\nPoems selected by the Nobel Library of the Swedish Academy"
