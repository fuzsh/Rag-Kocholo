        "text": "Seamus Heaney was born on April 13, 1939, in Castledawson, County Derry, Northern Ireland. He earned a teacher’s certificate in English at St. Joseph’s College in Belfast and in 1963 took a position as a lecturer in English at that school. While at St. Joseph’s he began to write, joining a poetry workshop with Derek Mahon, Michael Longley, and others under the guidance of Philip Hobsbaum. In 1966, he published Death of a Naturalist (Oxford University Press).\n\nHeaney produced numerous collections of poetry during his career, including Human Chain (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2010); District and Circle (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2006); Opened Ground (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1999), which was named a New York Times Notable Book of the Year; The Spirit Level (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1996); Selected Poems 1966–1987 (Faber and Faber, 1990); and Sweeney Astray (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1983). He also wrote several volumes of criticism, including The Redress of Poetry (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995), and of translation, including Beowulf (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2000), which won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award.\n\nIn June of 2012, Heaney was awarded the Lifetime Recognition Award from the Griffin Trust For Excellence in Poetry. He was also a Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and held the chair of professor of poetry at Oxford University from 1989 to 1994. In 1995, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature. Heaney was a resident of Dublin from 1976 to 2013. Beginning in 1981, he also spent part of each year teaching at Harvard University, where, in 1984, he was elected the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory.\n\nSeamus Heaney died in Dublin on August 30, 2013. In 2024, Farrar, Straus and Giroux published The Letters of Seamus Heaney, edited by Christopher Reid, after having published Heaney’s translations in the previous year.\n\nPoetry\n\nSelected Poems, 1988–2013 (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2014)\n\nHuman Chain (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2010)\n\nDistrict and Circle (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2006)\n\nElectric Light (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2001)\n\nOpened Ground: Selected Poems, 1966–1996 (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1999)\n\nThe Spirit Level (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1996)\n\nThe Midnight Verdict (Gallery Books, 1993)\n\nSeeing Things (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1991)\n\nNew Selected Poems, 1966–1987 (Faber and Faber, 1990)\n\nThe Haw Lantern (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1987)\n\nStation Island (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1985)\n\nSweeney Astray: A Version From the Irish (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1983)\n\nPoems 1965–1975 (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1980)\n\nField Work (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1979)\n\nNorth (Oxford University Press, 1975)\n\nWintering Out (Oxford University Press, 1973)\n\nDoor into the Dark (Oxford University Press, 1969)\n\nDeath of a Naturalist (Oxford University Press, 1966)\n\nProse\n\nThe Letters of Seamus Heaney (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2024)\n\nFinders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971–2001 (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2002)\n\nCrediting Poetry: The Nobel Lecture (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1996)\n\nHomage to Robert Frost, with Joseph Brodsky and Derek Walcott (1996)\n\nPreoccupations: Selected Prose, 1968–1978 (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1980)\n\nThe Fire i’ the Flint: Reflections on the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins (Oxford University Press, 1975)\n\nThe Government of the Tongue: Selected Prose 1978–1987 (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1988)\n\nThe Place of Writing (Scholars Press, 1989)\n\nThe Redress of Poetry: Oxford Lectures (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995)\n\nTranslation\n\nThe Translations of Seamus Heaney (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2023)\n\nAeneid, Book VI: A New Verse Translation (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2016)\n\nBeowulf: A New Verse Translation (W.
