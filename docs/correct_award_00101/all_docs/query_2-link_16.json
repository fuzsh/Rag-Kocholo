Known in his native Ireland as “Famous Seamus,” Heaney was that rare writer who garnered critical acclaim while harvesting a large public audience.\n\n“The first poetry a writer feels he can trust and come to a point that you think that is a poem, that is a life changing experience,” Heaney told Jeffrey Brown on the NewsHour in 2011.\n\nHe was a prolific poet, publishing 16 major collections of verse, plus a number of smaller collections, along with translations and scores of works of prose.\n\nHeaney was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1995 and in his address accepting the award described his life’s journey into “the wideness of language.”\n\nHere you can watch the NewsHour’s full profile of Heaney:\n\nYou can also watch Heaney read one of his most famous poems, “Death of a Naturalist,” here:\n\nBack in 2000, the NewsHour’s Elizabeth Farnsworth spoke with Heaney about his translation of the epic poem, “Beowulf.”"
