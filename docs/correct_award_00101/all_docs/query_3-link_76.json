The family has requested privacy at this time.\"\n\nFuneral arrangements are to be announced later.\n\nNorthern Ireland-born Heaney published his first major collection of poems, \"Death of a Naturalist\", in 1966 and went on to become one of the English language's leading poets.\n\nHeaney was the professor of poetry at Oxford University between 1989 and 1994.\n\nTwo years ago, he donated a large collection of his literary papers to the National Library of Ireland.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Marie and three children."
