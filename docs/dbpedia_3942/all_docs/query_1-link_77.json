        "text": "Essential Question\n\nWhat were the Stonewall Riots, and what role did they play in ongoing struggles for LGBTQ+ equality in the United States?\n\nOverview\n\nDownload student-facing Distance Learning Pack for this lesson.\n\nWe, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths–that all of us are created equal–is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.\n\nPresident Barack Obama’s soaring words echoed through the National Mall on Inauguration Day in 2013. For his second inaugural address, he joined together text from the nation’s founding documents with sociopolitical movements that reflected the country’s progress since its inception. At Seneca Falls in 1848, the Women’s Rights Movement was launched with the creation of the Declaration of Sentiments, which demanded equality between the genders. In Selma in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. galvanized citizens across the country in the demand for equal voting rights for African Americans. And in Stonewall, a police raid on a local gathering place initiated the modern Gay Rights movement.\n\nPresident Obama’s speech was especially important for the LGBTQ+ community, for in that moment, the highest elected official in the country recognized the history of discrimination that confronted LGBTQ+ people–a history that was none too far in the past. Until 1973, homosexuality was considered a psychiatric disorder by the American Psychiatric Association. Since World War II, the federal government consistently sought to deny LGBTQ+ people representation: in 1942, the government began screening military recruits in order to exclude gay men; in 1944, recruits for the Women’s Army Core were additionally screened; and by 1953, homosexuals were banned from being employed by the federal government. To this day, courtrooms across the country still allow what is termed the Gay and Trans “Panic” defense, a tactic which uses the victim’s gender identity or sexual orientation to partially or even fully excuse the violent actions of the perpetrator.\n\nIn such an environment, coming out as an LGBTQ+ person has carried the threat of familial or social alienation, potential unemployment, damaging shock or “conversion” therapy, and being abused or killed with impunity. For this reason, many flocked to urban centers that have had a reputation of being more accepting of LGBTQ+ people, such as New York City’s Greenwich Village neighborhood. But even here, people faced discrimination: in the 1950s and 60s, New York City regularly revoked liquor licenses for establishments with the reputation of serving LGBTQ+ people, and the police regularly raided establishments and arrested patrons under the charge of “unruly conduct.” Often, media accompanied such police raids, threatening to expose people who frequented the establishments. This drove LGBTQ+ people to dangerous, often illegal bars that bribed police officers to avoid raids–places such as the Stonewall Inn.\n\nOpened in 1967, the Stonewall Inn was a Mafia-run bar and dancehall catering to LGBTQ+ people. In order to stay open, the owners bribed the police on a monthly basis, with money procured by selling overpriced drinks and, as some have accused, blackmailing wealthier patrons. Even still, police regularly harassed customers.\n\nOn June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen entered the Stonewall Inn, intent on shutting down the establishment, perhaps permanently. But, as Anti-war, Women’s Rights, and Civil Rights Movements subsumed the country, those inside Stonewall as well as pedestrians in the neighborhood were less willing to oblige the authorities. As patrons began to be handcuffed and loaded into police vans, a bystander shouted “Gay Power!” Soon, people were resisting arrest and bystanders began throwing coins and bottles at police vehicles. A riot ensued, and the police officers barricaded themselves within the bar, only to be freed when tactical police force units arrived. For the next two nights, the riots continued.\n\nLike the Selma to Montgomery March and the Seneca Falls Convention, the Stonewall Riots spread national awareness of the discrimination faced by LGBTQ+ people. They also inspired many in the community to no longer be ashamed of their sexuality, but to stand up for their rights as equal American citizens. For this reason, it is widely considered the founding moment of the modern Gay Liberation Movement.\n\nIn this lesson, Barack Obama’s second inaugural address serves as a launching point for classroom discussions on how the Stonewall Riots might be comparable to other seminal moments in the ongoing fight for equality in the United States. To supplement these discussions, students will analyze Rod Stewart’s “The Killing of Georgie” as a poetic account of LGBTQ+ discrimination in the United States, and compare primary source documents from the Women’s Rights, Civil Rights, and LGBTQ+ Rights movements.\n\nView More\n\nObjectives\n\nKnow (knowledge):\n\nThe historical significance of the Stonewall Inn\n\nThe circumstances that led to the Stonewall Riots, and their lasting effects\n\nRod Stewart’s “The Killing of Georgie” as a testament to LGBTQ+ discrimination\n\nThe possible connection between the Stonewall Riots and the Women’s Rights and Civil Rights Movements\n\nThe historic importance of the Seneca Falls Conference and the Selma to Montgomery March\n\nMastery Objective:\n\nStudents will be able to determine the significance of the Stonewall Riots to the history of social justice movements in the United States by analyzing visual sources, reading primary documents, and examining popular music.\n\nImages\n\nActivities\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\nPlay Clip 1, “Seneca Falls, Selma, Stonewall.” Ask students:\n\nFor what occasion did President Barack Obama give this speech?\n\nWhat is an inaugural address?\n\nBased on what you saw in the clip, why might have this speech been historically important?\n\nIn the speech, President Obama lists “Seneca Falls,” “Selma,” and Stonewall” as moments in the fight toward freedom and equality. Have you heard any of these terms? What occurred at Seneca Falls, Selma, and Stonewall?\n\nTell students they will be looking at images related to these events, to better determine why each event was important. Show Image 1, National Women’s Suffrage Association. Ask students:\n\nWhat seems to be happening in this image?\n\nWhat kind of people do you see in this image?\n\nBased on the clothing displayed in the illustration, could you estimate when this event took place?\n\nWhat does the text in this image say? What is “Women’s Suffrage”?\n\nBased on this image, what might have Seneca Falls been about?\n\nShow Image 2, Selma Protesters. Ask students:\n\nWhat seems to be happening in this image?\n\nWhat kind of people do you see in this image?\n\nBased on the clothing displayed in this illustration, could you estimate when this event took place?\n\nWhat does the text in this image say? What are the protesters demanding?\n\nBased on this image, what might have the march in Selma been about?\n\nShow Image 3, Gay Rights Protesters. Ask students:\n\nWhat seems to be happening in this image?\n\nWhat kind of people do you see in this image?\n\nBased on the clothing displayed in this image, could you estimate when this event took place?\n\nWhat does the text in this image say? What are the protesters demanding?\n\nBased on this image, what might have the Stonewall uprising been about?\n\nProcedure:\n\nTell students that in the class, they will be learning about the 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City, and considering why President Obama aligned the event with other fights for equality and freedom in the past. Play . Ask students:\n\nBased on the clip, how would you describe the Stonewall Inn? Who owned it?\n\nWhat kinds of people frequented the Stonewall Inn? What does David Carter mean when he says it was open to the “most marginal” groups? Who might “street kids” and “gay runaways” be?\n\nAccording to the clip, what set off the riot at the Stonewall Inn? Was it only due to the police showing up to the bar, or did it reflect deeper issues?\n\nWhat might David Carter mean when he says the police raid that night “touched something in the collective unconscious”?\n\nWhat might Mark Segal mean when he says the police officers “became society” that night? What parts of society might he have been referring to?\n\nPass out Handout 1 – “The Killing of Georgie” Lyrics and Handout 2 – LGBTQ+ Event Timeline, 1940-1973. Tell students that to get a sense of the discrimination that confronted people at Stonewall, and LGBTQ+ people across the country, they will be looking at the song “The Killing of Georgie” by Rod Stewart.\n\nHave students read the lyrics in Handout 1, and then ask:\n\nWhat story is being narrated in this song?\n\nIn what ways does Georgie encounter discrimination?\n\nWhere does Georgie find acceptance and support?\n\nAsk students to now read Handout 2. After reading the timeline to themselves, ask:\n\nIn what ways did the U.S. government discriminate against LGBTQ+ people? Do you think the government’s practices influenced the way American society treated LGBTQ+ people?\n\nIn what ways did science, especially psychology, discriminate against LGBTQ+ people?\n\nWhat events in the timeline hinted that people were becoming more accepting of LGBTQ+ people? What kinds of people and organizations became advocates for the community?\n\nBased on the timeline, do you think the story of Georgie is believable? Could it have happened?\n\nWhat might have been some of the possible results of recording and releasing a song such as “The Killing of Georgie”? What are some ways the song might have affected the LGBTQ+ community? What about people in general?\n\nPlay Clip 3, “The Killing of Georgie” Ask students:\n\nBased on the clip, what might have been the importance of the song?\n\nWhat does Mitchell Morris mean when he says the “ban on representation?” How did “The Killing of Georgie” break that ban?\n\nWhat might Paul Gambacinni mean when he states the song was important because it talked rationally about the “existence” of Gay and Lesbian people? Does the song just acknowledge that LGBTQ+ people exist, or does it do something more?\n\nBased on the comments by Jason King, Rod Stewart, and Boy George, how might have the song been beneficial to the LGBTQ+ community?\n\nSplit the students up into groups, and hand out to each group one of the following documents:\n\nDeclaration of Sentiments (1848)\n\nDr. Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., “Address at the Conclusion of the Selma to Montgomery March” (1965)\n\nHarry Hay, “Statement of Purpose–Gay Liberation Front, Los Angeles, California” (1969)\n\nDisplay Image 4, Activity Instructions. Have students groups follow the instructions in the image. Then, ask students to present their answers to the class.\n\nSummary Activity:\n\nDisplay Image 5, Writing Prompt. Ask students to follow the prompt, and report their answers to the class.\n\nExtension Activities:\n\nResearch incidents prior to Stonewall Uprisings, including the Cooper’s Donuts riot (1959) and Compton’s Cafeteria riot (1966). After summarizing what occurred during these events, consider the ways they are similar or different to the Stonewall Riots.\n\nHandouts\n\nDeclaration of Sentiments (1848) Dr. Rev.
