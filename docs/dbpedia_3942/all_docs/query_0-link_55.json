        "text": "Happy Pride!\n\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride Month is celebrated each year in June — sparked by the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York’s Greenwich Village, a tipping point for the gay rights movement in the United States.\n\nThe Library commemorates Pride Month with LGBTQIA+ book recommendations, book clubs, highlights from past programs, film offerings, and other resources. This month's programming also includes special storytimes, exhibitions, and conversations.\n\nVisit the National Library of Medicine's traveling exhibition, Surviving and Thriving: AIDS, Politics, and Culture/Sobrevivir y Prosperar: Sida, Politica y Cultura, which opened June 7 and runs through July 27 near the entrance to 3N at the Central Library.\n\nStop by Friday Night Family Fun at the Plaza branch on June 14 for \"Representation Matters: Celebrating Diversity in Children’s Books,\" mini-storytimes with the Kid Corner staff and UMKC's Pride Alliance.\n\nJoin the conversation on June 26 at 6 p.m. at the Plaza branch about No Place Like Home: The Struggle Against Hate in Kansas. Oscar-winning filmmaker Kevin Willmott directed the 2023 documentary sequel to C.J. Janovy's award-winning book of the same name, No Place Like Home, with a focus on LGBTQ rights. RSVP here.\n\nReading & Watching with PRIDE\n\nExplore suggested LGBTQ Pride Month readings from Library staff and community-created lists in our catalog, including everything from history and nonfiction to popular fiction titles.\n\nResources with PRIDE\n\nLGBT Studies in Video Learn more about LGBT history and culture with the LGBT Studies in Video database.\n\nArchives of Sexuality & Gender Illuminates the experiences of not just the LGBTQ community as a whole but also individuals of different races, ethnicities, ages, religions, political orientations, and geographical locations.\n\nPrograms with PRIDE\n\nListen to audio or watch video from some of the Library's past signature events discussing LGBTQ history and experiences."
