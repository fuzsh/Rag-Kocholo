        "text": "ABOUT THE PROJECT\n\nLOGLINE\n\nIn 1969, a riot at New York’s Stonewall Inn launched the gay rights movement, and changed the course of history. In June, 2019, millions of LGTBQ people across the globe will commemorate 50 years of gay liberation. STONEWALL FOREVER tells the story of that uprising, traces its five decade legacy of resistance, and culminates with the bar today — now a National Monument but facing an uncertain future.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nIn the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, police raid a small, dark gay bar in New York’s West Village and begin arresting the gay, trans and gender non-conforming youth inside. But this time, they’ve had enough. Rather than be rounded up like criminals, arrested and beaten on account how who they love or how they dress, they fight back. The uprising and the riots that followed launched the gay liberation movement — its impact still felt today.\n\nIn June, 2019 millions of LGBTQ people across the world celebrate the revolution Stonewall launched. STONEWALL FOREVER documents the 50th anniversary celebration in New York, and turns back the clock to tell the story of the bar and its influence — through riots and revolution, defeats and rebirths, restoration and gentrification. STONEWALL FOREVER is a universal story of resistance. About how a local act of bravery by disenfranchised, gender non-conforming youth, launched a battle for freedom everywhere. It traces Stonewall’s effect through the triumphs and tragedies of the LGBTQ history — including Harvey Milk, AIDS, hate crimes, marriage equality, and the fight for transgender rights.\n\nSTONEWALL FOREVER features interviews with notable activists, artists, and influencers from Stonewall, gay liberation and the generations that followed. It’s a story made vivid through rare archival footage and photos, activist videos and home movies, coupled with innovative animation, motion graphics and original music.\n\nThrough it all, STONEWALL FOREVER tells the story of the bar itself. How a restored Stonewall Inn has become a beacon for LGBTQ people across the globe — even as the business owners face an uncertain future in the age of Grindr.\n\nSTONEWALL FOREVER is a history lesson for youth, a manual for activists, a love letter to gay bars, and a testament to the power of resistance."
