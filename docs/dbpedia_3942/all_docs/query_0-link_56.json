        "text": "Adjacent to Aunt Charlie’s, the Tenderloin District’s last working class drag bar, there’s a little-known name tucked away on the Turk Street sign between Jones and Taylor that simply says: Vicki Mar Lane. But who was Vicki Marlane, and why was a street named after her in her honor?\n\nTo commemorate the legendary drag queen who performed at Aunt Charlie’s—and provide relief funds for the beloved bar’s cornerstone staff members—the Tenderloin Museum, the Glide Legacy Committee, and the Save Aunt Charlie’s Collective are proud to present: “Forever’s Gonna Start Tonight,” the vibrant film which chronicles the remarkable experiences of Vicki Marlane, drag performer and icon who strutted onstage well into her seventies.\n\nVicki takes us on the ride of her life—from the early days of roller skating in women’s wear, to hoochie-coochie girl carnival sideshows and romantic road trips. We hitchhike through the adventures that led to her being San Francisco’s “Toast of the Town” in the early ’70s, while Vicki shares her tips of the trade acquired from decades of drag experience.\n\nDirected by Michelle Lawler, and produced by archivist and historian Mimi Klausner (Choosing Children, Best Short Documentary, New York Gay and Lesbian Film Festival) and Emmy Award-winning Susan Stryker (Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton’s Cafeteria, Frameline30), this film is a 21st-century toast to a legend.\n\nForever’s Gonna Start Tonight will be screened via Zoom at 6 p.m., followed by a Q&A with producers and activist Susan Stryker and Mimi Klausner, and director Michelle Lawler. Proudly in partnership with the Glide Legacy Committee.\n\nDonations for this film will go towards staff members experiencing financial fallout from the pandemic. Please donate at least $10 if you can, and higher donations welcome! 100% of the proceeds will go directly to the Aunt Charlie’s staff.\n\n*The event is limited to 500 attendees.\n\n*Zoom link will be sent on the day of the event to those who register.\n\nFor Karyn Skultety, Executive Director of Openhouse, San Francisco’s LGBTQ senior housing community, the idea to produce a socially-distanced drag show for its residents all started with a window overlooking the courtyard. “I had seen some of the videos online of people performing from balconies all over the country, and thought about our buildings with Mercy Housing—LGBTQ-welcoming, affordable senior housing.”\n\nSimilarly, Katie Conry, Tenderloin Museum Executive Director, saw a literal window of opportunity while visiting Donna Personna (before the pandemic), Openhouse resident and longtime collaborator of the museum. Nearly simultaneously, Conry and Skultety both thought, why not produce a socially-distanced, outdoor drag performance for some of our most vulnerable community members?\n\nOn May 22, Openhouse, SF Queer Nightlife Fund, and the Tenderloin Museum are proud to present: Live Drag for our LGBTQ Elders, a live drag show where powerhouse drag queens Dulce De Leche, Per Sia, Princess Panocha, Mary Vice, and Shane Zaldivar will perform in the courtyard of Openhouse. This performance will be virtually hosted by the one and only Juanita MORE!, and will be safely viewed by its LGBTQ seniors, as well as live streamed to the general public.\n\nA way to both connect with seniors and build an intergenerational community of support, Skultety describes drag as a bonding force within the LGBTQ community—and a way to exalt its elders, many of whom may feel isolated and invisible during the ongoing pandemic. “Drag is powerful in that way—it thrives on audience connection and interaction—and so this is us saying nothing can stop us from connecting with our seniors and we will do it in the most meaningful way,” she says.\n\nPaying homage to the LGBTQ pioneer who helped shape the world for younger generations—and who would have been part of the vulnerable community of LGBTQ elders—This special show will kick off Harvey Milk's 90th birthday celebration, a series of events celebrating Harvey's legacy. Openhouse is encouraging everyone to consider a gift of $9, $90, or $900 in honor of Harvey's 90th.\n\n“When we demonstrate to our community that elders matter, it makes all of us better. Younger LGBTQ [generations] live better lives when they are connected to the elders who helped create the world they live in today,” says Skultety. An opportunity to financially support drag performers who have lost income due to the crisis, as well as bring visibility and safe, in-person entertainment to LGBTQ elders, Live Drag for our LGBTQ Elders is an opportunity to reflect upon—and unify with—intergenerational LGBTQ community members.\n\nThis event is part Harvey Milk's 90th Birthday Block Party: https://www.facebook.com/events/625647098031154/\n\nHarvey Milk’s 90th Birthday Block Party\n\nFriday, May 22, 2020; 6:00 p.m.- 9:00 p.m.\n\nJoin the party via Zoom here: https://zoom.queernightlifefund.org/\n\nJoin the party via Twitch here: https://www.twitch.tv/sfqueernightlifefund/\n\nOpenhouse and the Tenderloin Museum are asking you to contribute to the Live Drag for Our Queer Elders fundraiser here: https://www.facebook.com/donate/231605168281729/\n\nOf course, a hero to many near and far, Harvey was and always will be, \"The Mayor of Castro Street\" to us here in San Francisco. For this reason, even as Castro Street shelters in place, his birthday block party will go on \"virtually” in the second half of a two-part event. This collaborative effort is organized by Supervisor Rafael Mandelman's office, the Castro LGBTQ Cultural District, the Harvey Milk LGBTQ Democratic Club, the Castro Community Benefit District, “Windows For Harvey” presented by the Castro Merchants Association, the Friends of Harvey Milk Plaza, Open House, the GLBT Historical Society, the Tenderloin Museum, the Golden Gate Business Association, and the SF Bay Area Queer Nightlife Fund.\n\nAbout the queens:\n\nJuanita MORE!\n\nJuanita MORE! is a denizen of the limelight. For almost three decades, the tireless hostess has blitzed San Francisco with high glamour, drag irreverence, danceable beats, culinary delectables, political activism and a philanthropic heart that has illuminated the entire city. Juanita remains a creation of fashion and glamour, generosity and nerve, inspiring those around her to make a positive difference in their lives and in their communities, doing it all with a timeless elegance and an innovative spirit.\n\nShane Zaldivar\n\nShane is originally from Florida and moved to California for school and the pursuit of an authentic lifestyle. Since moving in 2014, she has thrived as an artist and activist. Shane acted as a lead role in the immersive play, The Compton’s Cafeteria Riot. This play is a collaboration with The Tenderloin Museum and depicts events leading to the historic riot of 1966, which marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco. The play premiered in February 2018 and is looking to return sometime in 2021. Shane also performs as the Pop Up Drag Queen, where she brings smiles and drag to the streets of San Francisco (on select weekends). This performance-project began in 2017, and Shane has since collaborated with local San Francisco bands and toured internationally with the project.\n\nShane is currently working as a Training Coordinator for The Office of Transgender Initiatives, the first and only trans-led city government office, where she trains City and County employees on topics relevant to transgender & gender non-conforming (TGNC) and/or LGBQ+ populations. She also coordinates a Fellowship for TGNC and/or LGBQ+ immigrants.\n\nPer Sia\n\nWith a pedigree from performances at the late, iconic Esta Noche, Per Sia's trajectory has gone on to include art curation, stand-up, television, modeling, and maybe a quinceañera or two, in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and México. Currently, she is a regular performer in the nationally acclaimed \"Drag Queen Story Hour\" as well as an educator in residence at the Children's After School Arts (CASA) program in the San Francisco Unified School District recently profiled on KQED Arts and National Public Radio.\n\nDulce De Leche\n\nDulce De Leche is a multifaceted drag performer best known for her powerful, soulful voice. Inspired by 50’s & 60's soul divas and her childhood icon, Bette Midler, she is a ballsy and brassy broad who is a proud member of one of SF’s most respected drag houses, The House of MORE! Dulce has appeared on-stage with Peaches Christ Productions; on-screen in Adrian Anchondo’s Beyonce parody “In N Out Mission,” as the Cowardly Lion for the FRAMELINE29 promo video, and on HBO’s LOOKING. She has performed at Daytime Realness, WOMAN, Dragula SF, Honey Sound System, Hard French, Blow Pony and many other events. She was crowned the 2013 Miss Tiara Sensation and is the reigning Hard French Winter Ball Queen.\n\nPrincess Panocha\n\nPrincess Panocha is an Irish Mexican San Francisco native, where her drag resides on the corner of sex appeal and camp.\n\nMary Vice\n\nMary Vice has been part of the drag scene in Soma and the Tenderloin for the last 4 years. Pre-quarantine she was a regular fixture at Aunt Charlie’s, Powerhouse and The Stud, where she hosted a monthly party, Lip Service. She works closely with her drag mother, Mr. David Glamamore, sewing gowns for some of the biggest names in town like Juanita MORE! and projects like Levi’s 2019 Pride campaign. During shelter-in-place she can be found hosting an online drag show, Glama’s Pillows, every Monday night at 9 PM and Girl Talk, a current events drag talk show every Friday at 3 PM. Both shows air at twitch.tv/CashMonetDrag.\n\nAbout the organizations:\n\nOpenhouse\n\nFounded in 1998, Openhouse works to center the voices and experiences of LGBTQ older adults by providing opportunities to make social connections and build community. Openhouse is committed to creating a safe environment to encourage and support community members to share our diverse perspectives and identities to foster dynamic community engagement. We recognize and affirm that LGBTQ older adults live at intersections of race, ethnicity, class, culture, HIV status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, spirituality and ability. At Openhouse, everyone is a community member.\n\nSF Queer Nightlife Fund\n\nThe SF Bay Area Queer Nightlife Fund provides relief to LGBTQ nightlife workers and entertainers affected by COVID-19. Nightlife is central to the Bay Area’s queer culture. Those whose primary source of income is in nightlife are currently experiencing economic insecurity as a result of bar closures and event cancellations in light of the COVID19 pandemic. The purpose of the San Francisco Bay Area Queer Nightlife Fund (QNF) is to provide financial relief to workers in the nightlife industry for as long as the current crisis continues.\n\nTenderloin Museum\n\nTenderloin Museum celebrates the rich history of one of San Francisco's most overlooked neighborhoods. Through history exhibitions, resident-led walking tours, community programs, and the presentation of original artwork, the Tenderloin Museum invites all to learn about the roots of our dynamic neighborhood, and reclaim our city's past and future. All are welcome to join us in telling its story.\n\nAccording to Randy Shaw, attorney, activist, and Executive Director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic, for the last 100 years, the Tenderloin neighborhood has actively fought City Hall for survival. Treated as the black sheep of the Bay Area, the neighborhood, for all its cultural diversity and historical value, has endured more ongoing conflict than any other district in San Francisco. From the time City Hall shut it down entirely in 1917 to its present day status as a “containment zone—” an area where illicit activities are not only permitted, but propagated by the City—the neighborhood is now facing even more complex hardships during the ongoing pandemic.\n\nIn the past year, violent crime has shot up in the Tenderloin by 24 percent, and the neighborhood now has nearly 400 tents occupied by two to three people at a time. “We can't offer a safe place to live, it’s an unsafe environment. There’s no other way to say it,” says Kathy Looper, landlord of the Cadillac Hotel, a nonprofit hotel on Leavenworth and Eddy which houses low-income and formerly homeless residents. According to Looper, children struggle to get to school in the area, and residents are afraid to get services—or basic resources like groceries due to crowding on the sidewalks. For Looper and Shaw, it’s integral that the City of San Francisco takes action and treats the Tenderloin as a community rather than a containment zone—which is why they worked together in conjunction with business owners, residents, and local law school, UC Hastings, to file a lawsuit against the City for its neglect of the neighborhood.\n\nOn Thursday, May 21, join the Tenderloin Museum for a digital panel discussion between Randy Shaw, author, Tenderloin Museum Founder, and Tenderloin Housing Clinic Director, and Kathy Looper, landlord of the Cadillac Hotel, the first non-profit SRO in the West. Advocates of the Tenderloin, Shaw and Looper will detail the neighborhood’s decade-by-decade conflicts, its present day hardships, and the future of the neighborhood’s social, political, and economic landscape.\n\nAbout the speakers:\n\nRandy Shaw, Executive Director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic Tenderloin, Tenderloin Museum Founder\n\nRandy Shaw is a Berkeley-based attorney, activist, and author of The Tenderloin: Sex, Crime and Resistance in the Heart of San Francisco. A longtime proponent of tenants’ rights, Shaw has drafted pro-tenant key city ballot measures and state laws, co-authored studies on housing crises, and authored six books on activism and social change since the 1990s. In 1980, Shaw opened the Tenderloin Housing Clinic (THC), which prevents tenant displacement and provides legal assistance to low-income tenants. THC is currently one of the largest nonprofits in San Francisco which offers legal, housing, and support services, and continues to spearhead housing efforts for San Francisco’s most vulnerable populations today. In 2015, Shaw founded the Tenderloin Museum, which preserves the Tenderloin’s iconoclastic history, where he continues to serve as a board member.\n\nKathy Looper\n\nKathy Looper is the Administrator and Executive Director of Reality House West, Inc., San Francisco, a non-profit that has provided drug detox and rehabilitation services; a youth offenders residential program; housing for 160 low income senior citizens; a re-entry program for Federal prisoners; and community and economic development work in the Tenderloin area of San Francisco. She has 51 years of experience in the non-profit sector, and has won multiple awards from the State of California and the City and County of San Francisco for her work supporting homeless, low-income, and disabled communities. Looper and her husband, Leroy Looper, purchased and renovated the Cadillac Hotel in 1977, which set the groundwork for “supportive housing” that we see in San Francisco today.\n\nFree | Suggested donation of $10\n\nThe event is limited to 500 attendees.\n\nZoom link will be sent on the day of the event to those who register.\n\nIf there’s anything that history has shown us—and what the current crisis is reminding us—it’s that the Tenderloin is no stranger to hardship. But it’s difficult times like these that reveal the power, unity, and resilience of our small, community-driven neighborhood. On May 14, District 6 Supervisor Matt Haney, Tenderloin merchants, residents, and local nonprofit workers will come together for a digital panel discussion on the current state of the Tenderloin, TL Together.\n\nA conversation on how the neighborhood is coming together during the pandemic, this panel will highlight the Tenderloin’s successes and challenges from an interpersonal perspective—honoring the heroism of our community members working on the frontlines of the pandemic, as well as the resilience of our beloved, multifaceted neighborhood.\n\nAbout the panelists:\n\nMatt Haney\n\nMatt Haney is a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, representing District 6 (Tenderloin, Civic Center, Mid-Market, SOMA, Yerba Buena, Rincon Hill, South Beach, Mission Bay, Treasure Island).\n\nHoney Mahogany\n\nHoney Mahogany is a San Francisco native, nightlife fixture, and social worker who has been working and performing in the Tenderloin and SOMA since 2006. Honey is a founder of the Transgender Cultural District, and works as an aide to Supervisor Matt Haney.\n\nDel Seymour\n\nDel Seymour has been a member of the Tenderloin community for the past 30 years. He founded Code Tenderloin, a local nonprofit which has led a community response campaign to Covid-19, and works closely with Glide Memorial Church, St. Anthony's, and Swords to Plowshares.\n\nJose Ramirez\n\nJose Ramirez serves as St. Anthony’s Executive Director. He brings to the role more than a decade of experience in serving those who are experiencing homelessness, most recently as Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer at St. Francis Center (SFC) in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nChristy Shirilla\n\nChristy Shirilla has lived in San Francisco for 14 years, and in the Tenderloin for five.

But just wait until they hear about the Rainbow Coalition.\n\nThe Rainbow Coalition was a broad coalition of identity-based organizations, from the Black Panthers and Young Lords to working class white groups like the Young Patriots. Standing in solidarity in their class struggle against economic and racial injustice, the group both challenged—and changed—the face of 1960s politics in Chicago, one of the most segregated cities in postwar America. Collectively confronting issues such as police brutality and substandard housing, the Rainbow Coalition is a little-known yet historically significant political group that paved the way for future generations of activists.\n\nTold through rare archival footage and interviews with former Coalition members, filmmaker Ray Santisteban’s The First Rainbow Coalition took more than a decade to complete, and depicts the story of a powerful, multi-ethnic movement and the enduring legacy it left behind. Although short-lived, it had an outsized impact: breaking down barriers between communities, the movement created a permanent shift in Chicago politics and an organizing model for upcoming activists and politicians across the nation.\n\nOn February 20, 2020, the Tenderloin Museum will host a limited screening of veteran filmmaker Ray Santisteban's documentary film, The First Rainbow Coalition, as well as a director panel with original Rainbow Coalition members.\n\nA donation-based event, attendees will also have the opportunity to contribute funds to the Fred Hampton house in Chicago, which is facing foreclosure.\n\nAbout the Director:\n\nDirector/Producer Ray Santisteban has worked for the past twenty-six years as a documentary filmmaker, teacher, and film curator.
