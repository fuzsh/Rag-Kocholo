        "text": "The trailer for Roland Emmerich’s Stonewall movie was released yesterday, and it looks offensively terrible.\n\nThe film already looked whitewashed and ciswashed and just bad from the information we had before the trailer was released. I mean, here’s the official synopsis:\n\nSTONEWALL is a drama about a fictional young man caught up during the 1969 Stonewall Riots. Danny Winters (Jeremy Irvine) is forced to leave behind friends and loved ones when he is kicked out of his parent’s home and flees to New York. Alone in Greenwich Village, homeless and destitute, he befriends a group of street kids who soon introduce him to the local watering hole The Stonewall Inn; however, this shady, mafia-run club is far from a safe-haven. As Danny and his friends experience discrimination, endure atrocities and are repeatedly harassed by the police, we see a rage begin to build. This emotion runs through Danny and the entire community of young gays, lesbians and drag queens who populate the Stonewall Inn and erupts in a storm of anger. With the toss of a single brick, a riot ensues and a crusade for equality is born.\n\nSo the movie about Stonewall is focused on a cis white dude. Nope.\n\nAnd now we’ve got a trailer selling a movie that’s looking super cis and white and guy-centric all around. (Also, it looks like a cheap Disney channel musical.)\n\nLet Monica Roberts explain why this is some bullshit:\n\nUmm, naw boo boo kitty, that’s not how it went down, and as long as Miss Major is alive, I’m not letting that fictionalized whitewashed trans free Stonewall narrative even gain a foothold because it’s a crime against history.\n\nThe reality coming from multiple witnesses to the original event say that it was Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, butch lesbians and other persons of color who jumped off the riot in 1969 while the Fire Island gays were still cowering in their closets.\n\nEven Ray Hill, who is one of our Houston human rights icons and was one of the early Big Four Gay leaders along with Harvey Milk, Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings, has told me that Stonewall was a trans and gender variant POC led uprising.\n\nAs I expected, the trailer starts the project of historicizing Stonewall as the beginning of the movement that culminated in “winning full equality” ie same sex marriage. Forget about the movement for liberation started by the very people who’ve been left behind as the mainstream gay rights establishment focused all its energy on marriage.\n\nThere are two POC characters featured in the trailer, and in 2 minutes and 22 seconds they manage to come off as tokens who are there to teach our white dude hero about how hard things are by being tragic figures. In one scene, white guy Danny tells a character – who seems to be a trans woman of color (in today’s parlance) – “I can’t love you.” OK, this is a film that’s got trans woman of color Marsha P. Johnson, whose 25th birthday was being celebrated at Stonewall that night, listed way down in the credits on the IMDB page, looking like a glorified extra and played by a cis man. Trans woman of color Sylvia Rivera, who’s credited with throwing the first bottle, isn’t listed on the IMDB page anywhere. Neither is trans woman of color and living legend Miss Major. And this film’s trailer includes the most on-the-nose version of the “trans women of color are unlovable” trope possible?\n\nFuck this movie.\n\nGet ready to boycott and protest Emmerich’s Stonewall. Remember, Stonewall was a riot the first time around.\n\nHere’s the trailer if you feel the need to hate watch:"
