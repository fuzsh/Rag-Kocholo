        "text": "Analysis of Juthith Butler´s Besides Oneself: On the Limits of Sexual Autonomy\n\n818 Words | 2 Pages\n\nIn certain countries such as the U.S, people discriminate against others to a certain extent based off their gender, race, and sexuality. Butler states that “to be a body is to be given over to others even as a body is “one own,” which we must claim right of autonomy” (242). Gays and Lesbians have to be exposed to the world because some of them try to hide their identity of who they truly are because they are afraid of how others are going to look at them. There are some who just let their sexuality out in the open because they feel comfortable with whom they are as human beings and they don’t feel any different than the next person. The gender or sexuality of a human being doesn’t matter because our bodies’ will never be autonomous because it is affected by others around us. This is where humans are vulnerability to violence and aggression. In countries across the globe, violence and attack are drawn towards tran...\n\nRhetorical Analysis Of Logos By Roxane Gay\n\n231 Words | 1 Pages\n\nAlong with ethos and small touch of logos, the author Roxane Gay uses a strength appeal of pathos to persuade her audience onto her argument. “White people will never know the dangers of being black in America, systemic, unequal opportunity, racial profiling, and the constant threat of police violence. Men will never know the dangers of being a woman in America, harassment, sexual violence, legislated bodies. Heterosexuals will never know what it means to experience homophobia.” (Gay). In this paragraph, the author is identify the inequality between racial barriers, genders and sexual orientation which an emotionally involved topic to bring up. How people are treated differently how the way they look, where they come from.

It’s used more often as a checklist than a place of analysis or resistance. However, the use of intersectionality as just an apolitical tool, rather than a theory born from the knowledge of Black women experiencing a “triple jeopardy” of oppression and seeking liberation by deconstructing the institutions that bind them, is reductionist at best. In “Intersectionality is Not Neutral”May communicates that intersectionality pushes us to question and challenge the relatively mundane or acceptable norms in society that lend themselves to a continuous legacy of systemic inequality.\n\nStonewall Riots Research Paper\n\n1479 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe stonewall riots happened june 28, 1969. It took place in the the Stonewall inn which is located in Greenwich Village which is a neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. “The stonewall inn is widely known as the birthplace of the modern LGBT rights movement and holds a truly iconic place in history” (gaycitynews). This means that the Stonewall riots was the event that started the gay rights movement. This is saying that The Stonewall is where the gay rights movement started for gay people to have same rights has anyone else. It all started with A number of incidents that were happening simultaneously. “There was no one thing that happened or one person, there was just… a flash of group, of mass anger”(Wright). This means that everything was happening at once and a bunch of people were angry. People in the crowd started shouting “Gay Power!” “And as the word started to spread through Greenwich Village and across the city, hundreds of gay men and lesbians, black, white, Hispanic, and predominantly working class, converged on the Christopher Street area around the Stonewall Inn to join the fray”(Wright). So many gay and lesbian people were chanting “gay power” . “The street outside the bar where the rebellion lasted for several day and night in june”(gaycitynews). so the stonewall riot lasted many days and\n\nCritical Review Of Che Gossett's Silhouettes Of Defiance\n\n1386 Words | 3 Pages\n\nRivera and Johnson were both transgender women of color who also lived on the streets, forced to engage in survival sex work, due to transphobia, homophobia, and racist employment discrimination. This discrimination was not only apparent throughout their lives, but in the record and memory of their lives as well. In “Silhouettes of Defiance” Che Gossett argues that the historical erasure of individuals such as Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson is called “archival violence”. This type of violence “imposes a structuring law and order upon memory, domesticating and institutionalizing history, while also homogenizing and flattening its topography of difference and heterogeneity”. Despite the fact that Rivera and Johnson were both present and actively engaged in the resistance against the police on that hot summer night of 1969, their stories were ignored while others were privileged as archival evidence. The privileging of certain narratives imposes a whitewashed version of queer resistance and deprives history, and those who created that history, a full and honest record. This not only harms the memory of important actors,\n\nThe Stonewall Riots\n\n1224 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe media considers the1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City the spark of the modern gay rights movement. This occurred after the police raided the Stonewall bar, a popular gay bar in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village. Allyn argues that the new energy and militancy generated by the riot played a crucial role in creating the gay liberation movement. Arguably, the Stonewall Riots have come to resemble the pivotal moment in gay rights history largely because it provided ways for the gay community to resist the social norms. In fact, the riots increased public awareness of gay rights activism (Allyn 157). Gay life after the Stonewall riots, however, was just as varied and complex as it was before. In the following era, ho...\n\nThe Resistance Movement of Queer People of Color\n\n2878 Words | 6 Pages\n\n...n). LGBTQ individuals of African and Latino descent have especially had to face youth homelessness, unemployment, social discrimination, and lack of healthcare. However, in order to combat this, the QPOC communities have begun to fight back by standing up for themselves. Support groups covering all forms of identity have been established nationwide, and continue to grow. In addition, media projects and political organizations are working to set QPOC apart from the dominant white queer community, thus giving them a voice to speak out against the issues they currently encounter. Although they continue to face multiple forms of oppression today, through the acknowledgment of LGBTQ communities of color and advocacy for their rights, the resistance efforts of QPOC can help in the movement to ultimately eliminate intersectional discrimination from our society altogether.\n\nOn Being Young-A Woman-And Colored By Marita Bonner Summary\n\n1137 Words | 3 Pages\n\nOn Being Young-A Woman-and Colored an essay by Marita Bonner addresses what it means to be black women in a world of white privilege. Bonner reflects about a time when she was younger, how simple her life was, but as she grows older she is forced to work hard to live a life better than those around her. Ultimately, she is a woman living with the roles that women of all colors have been constrained to. Critics, within the last 20 years, believe that Marita Bonners’ essay primarily focuses on the double consciousness ; while others believe that she is focusing on gender , class , “economic hardships, and discrimination” . I argue that Bonner is writing her essay about the historical context of oppression forcing women into intersectional oppression by explaining the naturality of racial discrimination between black and white, how time and money equate to the American Dream, and lastly how gender discrimination silences women, specifically black women.\n\nEssay On The Laramie Project\n\n1758 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe Laramie Project considerably contributes to the national dialogue” on the issue of hate and hate crimes against members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community (LGBTQ). “The Laramie Project is a gripping tour through the actual spoken words of Laramie people drawn from hundreds of hours of interviews to show the outrage, the sense of being unfairly singled out, the quiet hope for change among gay and lesbian residents and the sometimes callous behavior of journalists (Marsden).” The Laramie Project somehow contributed in addressing the national issue pertaining to the rights of LGBTQ community.\n\nThe Laramie Project\n\n2028 Words | 5 Pages\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the story of the heinous hate crime of Matthew Shepard spiraled throughout many news outlets and eventually became world wide news. Hate crimes have become one of the most known violent acts towards the LGBTQ community. Ranging in actions such as vandalism, beatings, and even in some cases, death Although many cases as such have occurred, the realistic theatrical portrayal of Matthew Shepard in The Laramie Project, Matt Shepard is a Friend of Mine, and From Hate Crimes to Human Rights: A Tribute to Matthew Shepard, display evidence and an oath to Matthew and his life.\n\nThe Causes Of The Stonewall Riots\n\n1014 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe Stonewall Riots marked the start of the gay rights movement, and inspired members of the gay community to fight for their rights instead of being condemned for their sexuality. Even today, gay people in the US use the incident at Stonewall to educate younger members of the gay community. \"The younger generation should know about Stonewall so that they will realize it is possible to make change. It is possible to overcome entrenched, institutionalized prejudice, discrimination, and bigotry. And that they can live full equal lives.\" (Frank Kameny, aarp.org) This is the message that many members of the gay community continue to spread after the incident at the Stonewall Inn.\n\nGwen Araujo\n\n372 Words | 1 Pages\n\nGwen’s community was not tolerable towards transexuals as she paid with her own life the ignorance of individuals, which resulted in transgender activist coming together from the nation to demonstrate support to Gwen’s visibility in the transgender community.

Due to the color of her skin, she did not get media attention, until the LGBT community enforced the legitimacy of her case as important as a white transgender victim. Heidenreich states, “Why did the death of this young blond man [Matthew Shepard] garner so much\n\nAnalysis Of Three Things I Know For Sure\n\n1206 Words | 3 Pages\n\nOften identity is only thought of as a collection of individual characteristics that are independent such as sex, gender, race, class, sexuality, etc. Intersectionality is when these characteristics are transformed by one another and “tend to collapse into one another in the context of everyday life”. Dorothy Allison wrote Two of Three Things I Know for Sure where she explains aspects of her life through chronological stories revealing details and providing the reader with lessons she learned throughout her experiences. This book can be read with an intersectionality lens focusing on the moments or stories where gendered poverty shapes people’s experience of sex and sexuality as well as how gender, sexuality, and class transforms whiteness into a stigmatizing attribute rather than it’s usual power given attribute. Allison’s scene with her Aunt Maudy and the scene with her girlfriend both show intersectionality in different aspects and times of Allison’s life.\n\nLGBT Community and Discrimination.\n\n1284 Words | 3 Pages\n\nWhen one hears the words “LGBT” and “Homosexuality” it often conjures up a mental picture of people fighting for their rights, which were unjustly taken away or even the social emergence of gay culture in the world in the1980s and the discovery of AIDS. However, many people do not know that the history of LGBT people stretches as far back in humanity’s history, and continues in this day and age. Nevertheless, the LGBT community today faces much discrimination and adversity. Many think the problem lies within society itself, and often enough that may be the case. Society holds preconceptions and prejudice of the LGBT community, though not always due to actual hatred of the LGBT community, but rather through lack of knowledge and poor media portrayal."
