        "text": "By Alex Church\n\nDRAMATURG’S NOTE: The history outlined below is incomplete, flawed, and compiled by someone who is not an expert in neither history nor queer history. While I hope it is exciting and engaging, I also hope you read it as a starting place. There’s plenty I omitted from this article, either intentionally or unintentionally. Any one of these moments in time could have dozens of books or films written about them (and some do), so please follow your curiosity and feel free to prove me wrong.\n\nQueerness and Gender\n\nGay, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people have existed throughout time. Every culture in the world has mythologies of gender transitions and homosexual relationships rich in love, drama, and even religious power. Throughout time, these traditions thrived despite repeated campaigns of persecution and subjugation. Despite the best efforts of bad actors, queer people are evergreen, existing across history above and below the view of society.\n\nPart of why we know queer people of all persuasions have existed throughout time is the unfortunate side effect of hatred. Because fear of discovery often kept queer life underground or deeply coded, much of the records of queer history exist in the form of police reports, executions, and sensationalized media stories that took nations by storm. The phrase sometimes used to explain this idea is something along the lines of, “If gay people didn’t exist in biblical times, the Bible wouldn’t have needed to ban them.”\n\nThe resulting hatred created a reactionary cycle, where hatred created violence and persecution which generated condemnation and outrage by the public. In turn, that reaction led to more awareness of queer existence, giving more people the language to understand and name their innate feelings. As more people come out and/or are outed/discovered, more prejudice ensues, more outrage, more discovery, and on and on and on.\n\nThis reactionary cycle has led to both a bleaching of queer life from much of history, but also a separation in some senses of groups that have often walked in lockstep. For years the gay liberation movement existed separate from the trans rights movement. Even as trans, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming people fought on the front lines of some of the biggest battles in queer history, many have been removed or overlooked in favor of the stories of cisgender queers.\n\nPre-Modernity\n\nThe Island of Britain was conquered by the Romans in the first century, bringing with them a society full of open sexual activity amongst men. Homosexuality was commonplace until 312, when Emperor Constantine began a conversion to Christianity that began shifting attitudes towards only explicitly heterosexual relationships. Archeological evidence from the fourth century has discovered skeletons that suggest gender transgender/gender non-conforming people existed during this time. There is evidence of homosexual behavior among rulers of several cultures, including kings.\n\nIn 597, Christianity formally arrives on the island thanks to missionaries who convert a majority of the populace, and with that conversion comes an express disdain for homosexuality. However for 500 years there are evidences of love poems amongst monks, queer subcultures, and queer harems amongst royalty. In the early 1300s, King Edward II and his male favorites caused such a fervor amongst the nobility of the time that wars broke out throughout his kingdom (Partially due to homophobia, partially for other reasons). Additionally, in the late 1300s the first documented case of gender non-conformity is documented when a male prostitute is arrested in women’s clothing.\n\nIn 1533, Parliament enacts the first version of the Buggery Law- the first law against sodomy in the Kingdom, placing severe penalties on the victim if charged including death. It is repealed, revised, and reinstated several times throughout the 1500s, but not used against King James VI/I who had a male favorite 24 years older than him. When he died, his heart was shipped back to James.\n\nIn the 1600s the first same-sex marriage is annulled after a musician discovered her husband was in fact a woman. Additionally, King William III had three male lovers all of whom he elevated to nobility.\n\n1700s to 1800s\n\nIn 1702 Queen Anne rises to power along with her female favorite, giving the basis for the movie The Favourite. Unrelated: lesbians begin to appear in psychological writings.\n\nIt’s here that historians start to get a clearer picture of queer culture and its thriving place in the London underground. This is partially due to court cases, but also growing literacy, methods of documentation, and a closer placement to a modern perspective. “It is believed that there were more gay pubs and clubs in London in the 1720s than in the 1950s and certainly more than today,” (SOURCE).\n\nMolly Houses were a slang term for places of congregation for particularly queer men to gather, have sex, and even stage early drag shows. Despite the presence of laws against sodomy, convictions were rare but not unheard of. Many queer men were executed and tortured throughout British history, and “even if allegations never made it to the courts, it’s clear that threats of “outing” were used to blackmail and extort victims.” (SOURCE).\n\nA trial in 1732 showcases one of England’s earliest known genderqueer people, Princess Seraphina. Read more of her story here.\n\nAs the 1800s arrived in England, attitudes towards censorship and decency transitioned away from overt descriptions of sodomy cases, preferring coded language and an intentional omission of details in order to align more with public opinion. This makes it harder to ascertain as clearly queer life in the 1800s, but extortion cases provide a bedrock understanding that homosexual sex was common in many all-male institutions.\n\nFemale homosexual life in England during this period is also more difficult to understand largely because it was not criminalized in the same way of sodomy. There are a few cases of women dressing as men mentioned in court cases.\n\nEarly 1900s\n\nAs society evolved into the 20th century and the horrors of the first two World Wars helped create a larger consciousness of human rights, groups of persecuted queers began organizing publicly and in secret.\n\nClusters of queer life that existed in the underbellies of major cities around the world began to solidify and emerge from the shadows as forward facing institutions. The “molly houses” in London and queer speakeasies in New York crystalized into gay bars and public queer hangout spaces. In 1921, Parliament considered criminalizing lesbian sex but it was defeated solely on the idea that it would inadvertently encourage more lesbians.\n\nAs the prohibition counterculture flourished and Vaudeville performances found a niche with glamor drag and female impersonators, queer acceptance began to inch out of the shadows into the larger public consciousness.\n\nSurgical care for transgender and intersex people has existed throughout history, but in the early 20th century surgeons began developing and experimenting with modern surgical care for trans people (then known as sex reassignment surgeries). A particularly prolific pioneer in the field was a gay jewish man named Magnus Hirschfield whose clinic in Germany was a safe space for trans people during pre-Nazi Germany.\n\nEarly surgeries were dangerous, highly experimental, and performed so rarely that they often became sensationalized in the press. One of the earliest surgeries attempted was on a painter named Lili Elbe (left), who unfortunately died in 1931 from the complications. A fictionalized version of her story is told in the film The Danish Girl, where she was portrayed by Eddie Redmayne, a cisgender man.\n\nWorld Wars throughout the first half of the century required huge numbers of people to join military service, particularly in Europe. Homosexual considerations that would’ve previously disqualified someone from service were ignored. Homosexual acts in the military and abroad were very commmon, and after each war ended veterans were thanked for their service via court marshalls for their “crimes” and crackdowns by police when they returned home.\n\nAttacks against homosexuals ramped up in the 1950s partially thanks to the McCarthy trials in the US and a crackdown from the UK Interior Minister, both of which targeted real and suspected communists in government and pop culture, but also homosexuals (the latter in particular was known as the Lavender Scare). Dozens of celebrities and prominent officials were outed, forcing the public to reconcile what it means for previously trusted community members and public figures to be “exposed” as homosexuals. In England, hundreds of men were imprisoned.\n\nSimultaneously, a number of published medical studies challenged the accepted idea of homosexuality as a mental illness needing to be cured. This understanding within the legal/medical communities meant an individual’s sexual orientation could be used against them as a cudgel in court proceedings to revoke parental rights, force sterilization, send someone to an institution, and dozens of other consequences sanctioned under the law.\n\nAdvocacy groups blossomed around the world helping to shift public opinion towards equality and acceptance. As a result of their efforts, homosexuality was partially decriminalized in 1967 for men over 21 years of age. Sex had to be private, between two people only, and could only happen in the home.\n\nStonewall\n\nThe Stonewall rebellion on June 28, 1969 formed the turning point for queer liberation around the world. Bars and clubs tailored toward queer clientele were frequently raided throughout the 50s-70s under the guise of illegal liquor sales, prostitution claim, underage drinking, etc. The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village was no exception, and frequently experienced assaults by police throughout its operation. Police would arrive and separate patrons by gender, with those suspected of gender queerness taken to a separate room to verify sex via genitalia and arrested if found cross-dressing.\n\nDuring the raid on June 28th, all patrons refused to comply with officers and were told all would be arrested. Some reports say officers assaulted the women via inappropriate touches and beatings with nightsticks. As they were forced out the building, patrons began fighting back and were cheered by onlookers and those who had escaped custody. They were spurred to action by a lesbian woman being forced into a squad car who shouted to the crowd “Why don’t you guys do something!”\n\nSuddenly the crowd began pelting the police with trash, bricks, bottles, anything within reach, and police responded with more violence, escalating the situation. The protests grew and riot police were dispatched until it was a massive demonstration that lasted through the night. The following evening, an even larger crowd formed along with a strong police presence, resulting in more violence. The crowd was filled with an open expression of both queerness and queer power.\n\nWhile many within the gay community applauded the uprising, others were less than enthused. The Mattachine Society, a moderate gay men's liberation organization, graffitied the burned front of Stonewall with a call for peace. Leaflets were distributed on a number of perspectives about how to seize the moment. For the first time, the gay community had the attention of the mass media, and public displays of affection and resistance were captured and digested by the populace. This meant a litany of homophobic press coverage, as well as widespread exposure to the size and strength of a queer community that had otherwise been operating underground.\n\nPost Stonewall\n\nFollowing Stonewall and its fallout with the public at large, a number of more radical activist queer organizations formed, each rejecting the more incremental approach of their predecessors. As these organizations formed, floundered, and gained strength, so too did their membership. Stronger activist communities formed, leading to more exposure to queer existence and ideas. The movement began to build upon itself, eventually forming what would become the first gay pride parade on June 28, 1970 to commemorate the first anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising in eight US cities.\n\nThe resulting exposure and building political power led to endorsements of the gay liberation movement by some civil rights leaders, including the head of the Black Panther at the time, Huey Newton. The first openly gay priest was ordained by the United Church of Christ in 1972, and throughout the 1970s, openly gay candidates began appearing and winning political offices.\n\nYear by year, as the movement grew and more pride marches appeared in cities around the world, the face of gay life transformed from the seedy underbelly of society to people that lived increasingly out in the open. It became more and more likely to know someone who was gay, and while legal and political rights did not increase, public empathy did. Ever so slowly, opinions began to shift away from prejudice and towards tolerance.\n\nIn England, queer activists were inspired by the Stonewall Riots and formed the British Gay Liberation Front in 1970. They protested police brutality against queers, demanded a seat at the table at civil rights conferences, even storming the stages of some anti-queer activist events. In 1971, Parliament expressly banned for the first time same-sex marriage, partially a response to a number of marriages being annulled throughout the last 100 years after discovering one partner was transgender. The first Pride parade was held in June of 1972. Throughout the 70s and 80s the number of queer advocacy organizations increased dramatically, as did the number of high profile politicians, celebrities, and journalists coming out as queer and transgender to dramatic consequences for their personal and professional lives. In 1980 Scotland decriminalized homosexual sex, following the limitations of the Brits.\n\nArrival of HIV/AIDS\n\nThen, in June of 1981, the first cases of what would become known as HIV/AIDS were reported in the US. The first case was reported in England later that year. Initial reports noted that sufferers seemed to be exclusively gay men, beginning a mythos that the burgeoning epidemic was a “gay disease.” Throughout 1981, it became clear that there was an epidemic in progress in America as more and more cases appeared throughout the country. In 1982, major American press organizations took notice and published articles naming the disease Gay Related Immune Deficiency (GRID), furthering stigma against gay men. Support networks and organizations begin forming to provide resources and lobby for medical research as a resolution for funding is killed in congress.\n\nIn England, cases rose steadily throughout the 80s along with incredible stigma that included laws passed to forcibly confine patients to hospitals. Margaret Thatcher in 1987 says “Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay,” beginning a trend in government towards suppression of queer life in the media and education system. Parts of the bill responsible for this shift were introduced by the MP from Birmingham, a neighboring county of Northamptonshire. Also in 1987, Princess Diana was first photographed touching, hugging, and holding hands with AIDS patients, challenging public perception that AIDS could be transmitted skin to skin. She was an influential patron of AIDS research and helped to greatly reduce stigma of the disease around the world.\n\nIn the 1990s, more pop culture icons around the world announced they were testing positive for HIV/AIDS and queer media began popping up on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1996, the European Court of Justice rules that trans discrimination in the workplace is illegal, the first case of its kind in the world. For the first time, homosexual politicians are elected to Parliament in 1999 as a string of bombings occurred against black, muslim, and queer spaces in London.\n\n2000s to 2014\n\nWith the dawn of the new millennium came a surge in legal protections for and recognition by governments of queer people in English society. Legal disputes around the age of consent for homosexual sex (which had been different from heterosexual sex for decades) rattled through Parliament, until finally in 2001 homosexual sex was viewed legally equal to heterosexual. In 2003 queer people were granted protection from discrimination in the workplace and the law banning schools from “promoting” homosexuality as equal to heterosexuality was repealed.\n\nIn 2004, homosexual couples are legally allowed to form civil partnerships with all the legal rights of marriage under English law (not Ireland). That same year, law was changed so transgender people were allowed to legally change their gender identity and receive all legal rights of their chosen gender, including marriage. Throughout the 2000s, queer visibility escalated dramatically as thousands of civil partnerships took place, more queer people came out to significantly less consequences, and openly queer MPs were elected and formed civil partnerships while in office with increasing frequency. At the same time, a number of homophobic attacks and murders occurred, sparking outrage and increased sympathy for queer people.\n\nThe 2010s arrived with Pope Benedict XVI decrying England’s growing acceptance of queer people, saying it ran contrary to “natural law”. Simultaneously, anti-discrimination protections for homosexuals and transgender people increased, and in 2013 same-sex marriage is legalized in England, Wales, and Scotland. That same year MP Nikki Sinclair comes out as transgender. By the mid-2010s, Queen Elizabeth II also began transitioning towards acceptance of queer people, at least publicly. In 2013, she granted Alan Turning a pardon for his conviction of “gross indecency” in 1952. Turing chose “chemical castration” over imprisonment and underwent forced hormone treatments.\n\nDrag and Ballroom Specifically\n\nPerforming Gender\n\nFor a large chunk of society, women were not allowed a place in the theater. While plays from the ancient Greeks to Shakespeare all had female roles (and some pretty darn good ones too), they were always played by men. This was for several reasons, mostly connecting back to religious ideas about women’s roles in society, the temptations of performance, and the danger of feminine sexuality.\n\nWhen the new genre of opera took off in the 17th century women began officially joining the ranks of performers, leading Pope Clement XI to say, “A beautiful woman who sings on stage and keeps her chastity is like a man who leaps into the Tiber and keeps his feet dry.” (SOURCE)\n\nAfter the Restoration in England, performance of gender by either sex was common, as was women onstage. This led to a convergence of previous cultural attitudes and the new reality. Men paying women drifted towards comedic performances as a way to disarm the potent power of womanhood via the irony of it being claimed by a man. Women playing men, but particularly boys, meant the role came with a degree of charm, vulnerability, and depth beyond their years.\n\nOrigins of Ballroom\n\nWhen the 1920s arrived and sound was added to motion pictures, a “Pansy Craze” erupted within the jazz age. Drag queens appeared in nightclub acts, films, and speakeasies in most major cities in the US. Their performances were beloved by straight audiences and some performers were famous the world over, including Jean Malin and Julian Eltinge (Left), who at one point was the highest paid actor in the world.\n\nThe Depression era found an upsurge in more puritanical, sex-negative attitudes among the American people, leading to the establishment of the Hays Code in 1934: an ethics agreement amongst motion picture studios banning scandalous subjects from the silver screen including homosexuals, swearing, nudity, interracial marriage, and toilets. Around the same time, a political crackdown on “downtown crime” pushed many queer art forms underground once more.\n\nWith the Lavender Scare in England and America keeping many queers silent and underground, still a few were able to burst in the public eye at large. One of Britain’s highest paid entertainers of the mid-1900s was Danny La Rue, a comedian and drag performer who was awarded the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth in 2002.\n\nIn America, the drag subculture of the mid-century led to black and latine drag performers to create their own spaces known as balls. Anti-black bias from largely white judges meant brown queens were not taken seriously at competitions. See this documentary clip from the 1967 film The Queen.\n\nIn 1990, the documentary Paris is Burning was released and introduced the world at large to the ballroom scene.
