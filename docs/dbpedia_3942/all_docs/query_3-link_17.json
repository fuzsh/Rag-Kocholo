        "text": "The event was revolutionary in more ways than one. As Stonewall veteran Mark Segal points out, LGBTQ groups across the country rose “from the ashes of the Stonewall riots.” Organizations like the Gay Liberation Front, Gay Youth and Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) stepped forward to create a community that mirrored the collective action and righteous demands of that night.\n\n“Pre-Stonewall, you have homophile organizations existing in a small number of cities, mostly underground people meeting in secret in people’s houses or church basements,” Beemyn explains. “And then post-Stonewall, you have this explosion of community and campus gay liberation fronts.”\n\nUnfortunately, this very real effect of the uprising often feeds the most prevailing myth that surrounds Stonewall: that June 28, 1969, marks the beginning of LGBTQ activism as we know it. Even the Obama administration’s announcement about the dedication of the Stonewall National Monument in 2016 said that the uprising “sparked the modern LGBT civil rights movement.”\n\nThat dedication came two days short of a year after Obergefell v. Hodges made marriage equality the law of the land. To many, these late June anniversaries felt like two bookends to a clean narrative of LGBTQ activism. That narrative largely centered the activism of cisgender, white, gay men who became the face of a Supreme Court case and a retrofitted film about Stonewall.\n\nBut that narrative is false. The story of revolutionary LGBTQ activism begins well before Stonewall, and its cast of key characters includes people of color, gender-nonconforming people and women. As we mark the uprising’s 50th anniversary this June, the legacy of that intersectional movement lives on. Queer people of color continue to organize around the mistreatment of trans people by law enforcement; they advocate for homeless queer youth and those detained while seeking asylum; they recognize that even still, in New York City, their right to exist with pride is often hindered by businesses and police—so why cooperate?\n\nAnd that story of Stonewall—not past or prologue, but an uprising informed by its predecessors and relevant to its descendants—belongs in the classroom.\n\nCorrecting a False Narrative: It Didn’t Start at Stonewall\n\nA year after the Stonewall Uprising, demonstrations across the country set the stage for events we now know as Pride. Part protest, part celebration, these events often take place in June and declare out loud the existence of LGBTQ people. The tactics used during the uprising partly inspired a new wave of activist groups.\n\nThat’s why it’s easy to fall into the narrative that Stonewall was a first step. But educators can counter this myth by teaching that the fight for LGBTQ rights began well before Stonewall―and continues to this day. Stonewall wasn’t a beginning. It was a culmination.\n\n“That’s one of the things I want people to come away with knowing,” Baumann says.\n\nUnderstanding the Stonewall Uprising, Baumann explains, hinges on knowing what preceded it: a growing demand for civil rights. He suggests that the fight for LGBTQ civil rights is best framed within the context of other civil rights movements of the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s. Stonewall coincides with those movements growing more revolutionary—and more popular.\n\nBefore, during and after Stonewall, activists in New York City were fighting against a system that criminalized their love lives and outward expression.\n\nAs early as the 1950s, groups like the Mattachine Society and Daughters of Bilitis were opposing job discrimination. Queer people at San Francisco’s Compton’s Cafeteria, Philadelphia’s Dewey’s Restaurant and Los Angeles’ Black Cat tavern all protested to demand access to public accommodations and freedom from police harassment.\n\nThese earlier organizing efforts are what allowed Stonewall to be effective, Baumann says. Educators can’t tell the true story of Stonewall without them. Partly because of them, “the political community in New York was developed enough that they could seize upon that moment and turn it into a political event with historical and political consequences.”\n\nThose consequences are visible 50 years later. In contemporary fights for free expression at work, access to public facilities and bathrooms, and better treatment in detention facilities, the spirit of Stonewall and its predecessors lingers.\n\nThis is especially true if you take a closer look at the movement’s oft-forgotten activists—and those who look like them today.\n\nCorrecting a False Narrative: Seeing Beyond the Cis, White Lens\n\nWhether it’s the story of Stonewall or the fight for marriage equality, the popular narrative of LGBTQ liberation often centers a familiar protagonist: the polished, “respectable,” gay, cis, white man. There’s a reason for this.\n\nShortly after the summer of ’69, some of the Stonewall Uprising’s veterans were unceremoniously pushed aside. Activists with privilege and power—often white, cis, gay men and lesbians—centered their role in the movement, while a trans woman of color like Rivera had to fight for stage time at the 1973 Christopher Street Liberation Day Rally.\n\nBut trans activists and activists of color shouldn’t have to fight for time in classroom retellings of history. Trans and gender-nonconforming people played vital roles in these early fights for social justice. Educators can help correct narratives that exclude them by recognizing the intersectional history of the fight for LGBTQ liberation, including Stonewall.\n\nMany of the era’s queer activists, including unsung heroes such as Kiyoshi Kuromiya, were on the front lines of several liberation movements. Trans activist Sylvia Rivera said that, prior to LGBTQ activism, she was involved in anti-war and Black liberation movements. “My revolutionary blood was going,” she said. And she wasn’t alone.\n\n“Trans people didn’t just suddenly emerge at Stonewall or didn’t suddenly emerge out of whole cloth on college campuses this century,” Beemyn says. “You can’t understand the visibility of trans people today without recognizing that there was a history built on that.”\n\nIt’s critical that educators get this history right. According to the national school climate survey released by the LGBTQ education organization GLSEN in 2018, only 19.8 percent of students had been taught a positive representation of LGBTQ people or history in the past year. More than 60 percent didn’t hear about LGBTQ issues at all. “I think you need to know you have a history in order to feel that you have a community,” Beemyn says.\n\n“I think having that—knowing that history—helps people to better appreciate themselves and see themselves as tied to the world and having a place.”\n\nWhile this history of activism predates Stonewall, the role of trans activists and people of color in the uprising can’t be denied. “It’s very clear,” Jason Baumann says, “that transgender, gender-nonconforming and also people of color were on the forefront of that conflict.”\n\n“What I hope doesn’t get lost is the importance played by trans people, particularly trans people of color in the movement,” Genny Beemyn says, “because they got shut out of it. They got pushed out. By the early ’70s, the movement had become much more mainstreamed and whitened. ... It’s important to recognize that heritage.”\n\nBut recognizing this also means confronting an uncomfortable truth: Much of the gay rights movement would abandon the needs and demands of queer people of color and trans people.\n\nJoanna Williams—a campaign manager for the software company GetThru who has also worked with progressive initiatives—points out that Stonewall veterans like Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson still experienced homelessness and food insecurity after the uprising.\n\n“You have this huge monumental riot in the U.S. and afterwards, you still don’t have a home, you still don’t have a commission,” Williams says. “Your role is essentially forgotten.”\n\nIt’s a contradiction Williams recognizes today.\n\nA Black millennial who identifies as lesbian, she remembers the way white, gay people talked about the Supreme Court’s wisdom in 2013, when it ruled that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional. Just the day before, the court had gutted the Voting Rights Act. But many white members of the LGBTQ community celebrated the court while people of color—including queer people of color—mourned the loss of hard-won rights.\n\n“In the U.S., there’s always this balancing act that you’re navigating,” Williams says. “You’re walking this legal battle as a Black person or a person of color, and you’re also fighting this legal battle as a queer person.”\n\nBut she believes teaching through an intersectional lens can help students better understand and critically evaluate this balancing act.\n\n“If teachers are truly trying to be intersectional in their teaching about these folks and this movement, they have to get into discussions around erasure,” Williams says. “If they are able to teach that and give students that kind of background, I think students are going to walk out of the classroom with a richer understanding.”\n\nAnd it’s not just understanding that students take away. Teaching this intersectional history also helps students see themselves as changemakers.\n\n“That is obviously something that can inspire a lot of resilience and fortitude within them,” Williams explains. “When they’re taking on causes of their own, they’re moving with the spirit of the people who came before them. It’s hard to channel that energy and that spirit if you think you’re the first one or the only one.”\n\nFifty years ago, that spirit moved through a crowd on Christopher Street. Those who felt it knew they weren’t the first to resist injustice. And they knew they weren’t alone. Connecting to that story is a rare gift that educators can offer students who rarely see themselves in their history books. Correcting the narrative offers even more students a community, predecessors and purpose.\n\nTelling the more inclusive story of Stonewall and the LGBTQ rights movement offers queer students of color and trans students a chance to see people like themselves demand the recognition of their humanity and their right to live. To see their strength, their resolve and their resistance. To see their hand in creating change.\n\nAnd to see that for the first time—as Sylvia Rivera once said—is so beautiful."
