        "text": "“Stonewall,” Roland Emmerich’s would-be epic film about a turning point in the gay liberation movement in 1969, is far from the first historical movie to choke on its own noble intentions. For its two-hour-plus duration, the movie struggles to fuse incompatible concepts.\n\nOn one level, “Stonewall” is a sweeping social allegory whose central character, Danny Winters (Jeremy Irvine of “War Horse”), is an all-American boy from the provinces (Indiana) thrown out of the house by his father (David Cubitt), a high school football coach, for being gay. Arriving in New York with little money and no fixed abode, Danny is radicalized by observing, then experiencing, police brutality.\n\nOn another level, the movie wants to be as specific as possible in its reconstruction of chaotic events that took place 46 years ago and have acquired a mythic dimension that demands heroic enlargement. In hindsight, the Stonewall riots are rather like the Woodstock music festival later that summer. More people claim to have been present than could possibly have been there. But except for its identification of actual police officers, “Stonewall” doesn’t bother to distinguish among facts, fiction and urban legend.\n\nEarly scenes jump between Danny’s final days in Indiana, before he is observed having sex in a car with a high school quarterback, and his new life in New York. Exiled from his biological family, he bonds with a group of outsiders, homeless drag queens and hustlers who live on the streets or pile, as many as a dozen at time, into a shabby apartment. The neighborhood center of gravity is the seedy mob-owned Stonewall Inn, which is subject to periodic police raids."
