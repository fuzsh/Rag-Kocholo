        "text": "Today, GLAAD released Stonewall 50: A Journalist’s Guide to Reporting on the 50th Anniversary of Stonewall and the Legacy of Pride. Stonewall 50 seeks to inform journalists about the history of the Stonewall Uprising and its impact on the LGBTQ movement into the modern day.\n\nThe guidebook covers several topics: story ideas when covering Stonewall 50, a history of the Stonewall Inn, an overview of significant events in the modern LGBTQ movement, and a focused discussion on the issues the LGBTQ movement faces today– both in the USA and around the world.\n\nWhile the Stonewall Uprising was not the first incident of LGBTQ people resisting police brutality and fighting for fair treatment, it did rouse many to action. After the Stonewall Uprising, leaders such as Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera (among others) started groups such as the Gay Liberation Front and STAR, leading to substantially more visibility for the LGBTQ community and movement.\n\nNow, the LGBTQ movement is facing new struggles. While progress has been made in some areas, such as the “Rainbow Wave” in the 2018 midterms, and continuing inclusion of LGBTQ storylines in entertainment, there are also aggressive attacks on the LGBTQ community coming from the highest levels of the United States government– over 106 attacks, and counting.\n\nGlobally, the worldwide LGBTQ movement is facing similar incidences of progress and regression. Just today, Taiwan legalized same sex marriage; at the same time, however, leaders like Jair Bolsinaro in Brazil are rolling back LGBTQ equality and acceptance.\n\nThis year, for Stonewall 50, World Pride is being held in New York City– the first time New York City is hosting this event. WorldPride is a culturally-diverse expression of the quest for equality and liberty of LGBTQ people worldwide. It exists to rally the LGBTQ communities on a global level, thereby promoting our universal quest for freedom and human rights. GLAAD is partnering with World Pride on a couple of major events, including Game Changers, the Human Rights Conference, and will be marching in the New York City Pride March."
