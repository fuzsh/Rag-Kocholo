        "text": "LGBTQ Literature is aReaders and Book Lovers series dedicated to discussing literature that has made an impact on the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people. From fiction to contemporary nonfiction to history and everything in between, any literature that touches on LGBTQ themes is welcome in this series. LGBTQ Literature posts on the last Sunday of every month at 7:30 PM EST. If you are interested in writing for the series,please send a kosmail toChrislove.\n\nOver the past five years, three out of five June LGBTQ Literature diaries have been devoted to the Stonewall Riots of 1969. See here and here for previous Stonewall diaries (one of which is a “reprint” of an earlier year). Considering that this month’s LGBTQ Literature falls on June 28, which is the day the rebellion started, I thought it would almost be inappropriate not to devote the space to Stonewall this year, too.\n\nLast year, I reviewed Edmund White’s The Stonewall Reader, which is a new anthology of primary sources from the pre-Stonewall and post-Stonewall periods that attempts to situate the rebellion in a larger historical context. Similarly, I would like to cover another fairly new primary source reader this time: Marc Stein’s The Stonewall Riots: A Documentary History. This won’t really be a “review.” In fact, I’ll freely admit that I’ve only read a few of the actual sources. Think of this more as a “you-should-check-this-out” kind of diary tipping you off to the book’s existence. In this diary—which will probably be pretty short (but I often falsely say that)—I am going to focus more on the book’s introduction, which I think will be of interest to many readers here. I will also talk a bit about the kinds of sources Stein chooses to include in the anthology. Anything beyond that, I’ll leave to to find on your own if you are so inclined. The book, by the way, is currently on sale for $1.99 if you’re a Kindle reader (this is part of the reason I’m writing about this book instead of “reprinting” my older Stonewall diary).\n\nStein begins his introduction to the book by recounting President Barack Obama’s historic reference to stonewall in his second inaugural address. You might remember the line (I know I do):\n\nWe, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths—that all of us are created equal—is the star that guides us still, just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall.\n\nIt is safe to say that Stonewall has entered the American public consciousness. Aside from being mentioned alongside other historic civil rights moments in a presidential inaugural speech, anybody who knows anything about LGBTQ history knows about Stonewall. If you crack open even the worst history textbooks (and as a textbook committee person at my college, I did just that several times over), it will probably mention Stonewall. If a teacher or professor in a U.S. history class covers LGBTQ history, you can almost bet that Stonewall will be the focus. When I first developed an interest in my own history, Stonewall was the first thing I learned about. To many people, Stonewall is the beginning of LGBTQ history—and indeed, perhaps the only LGBTQ history they’ll ever learn. And yet, for all the public awareness of Stonewall, this statement in Stein’s introduction is also undoubtedly true:\n\nDespite the widely recognized significance of the riots, most people know little or nothing about what happened at the Stonewall Inn in 1969.\n\nMuch of Stein’s introduction is a thoughtful examination of what we know about Stonewall. Which is surprisingly little, actually. And that shouldn’t be a surprise, given the nature of historical memory (not to mention, human memory in general). Stein notes the difficulty of knowing the granular details of this kind of event:\n\nEven if we could travel back in time and transport ourselves to the Stonewall Inn in the early morning hours of 28 June 1969, our experiences and accounts would likely differ based on our cultural identities (including our age, class, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, nationality, race, religion, and sexual orientation), social roles (as police officers, bar owners, club managers, bartenders, bouncers, patrons, neighbors, tourists, or passersby), communication networks, and physical absence or presence over the next several days. Our experiences and accounts would also be influenced by our abilities and disabilities (related, for example, to health, language, mobility, sight, and hearing); our consumption of food, water, alcohol, and drugs; and countless other factors. In addition, our narratives would vary if we were asked in the midst of the uprising, the days and weeks that followed, or the months and years that came later.\n\nAnybody who spends any amount of time in LGBTQ spaces knows that Stonewall is still hotly contested. I have witnessed more than one fight over the question of who “threw the first brick” (either literally or figuratively). The truth is that we don’t really know for sure how many things happened at Stonewall, because we have conflicting accounts. Stein does, however, use some space in the introduction to sketch out what we know about how the rebellion unfolded, in addition to covering some of the myths and questions that remain about the events at the Stonewall Inn. I’m not going to cover that part of the introduction, however—if you are interested in reading that yourself, you can.\n\nMuch of the rest of Stein’s introduction—and, for me, the most interesting part—is devoted to the historiography of Stonewall (that is, how Stonewall has been treated by historians over the years). For such a major event in LGBTQ history, there are not that many full-length historical examinations of Stonewall. Two of the main historical accounts (which I cover in one of the LGBTQ Literature diaries I linked above) are Martin Duberman’s Stonewall (1993) and David Carter’s Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution (2004)—both of these are must-reads for anybody interested in this history. Enough has been written that we can identify major historical questions and schools of thought, however. One question, quite simply, is: Why did Stonewall happen when it did?\n\nOne of the most popular interpretations—often criticized as a myth by historians—is that the rebellion was a spontaneous eruption of anger and an unprecedented explosion of resistance. Furious that the police were yet again raiding a popular gay club and targeting the most vulnerable members of their communities, the Stonewall’s patrons and their allies on the streets fought back and started a revolution. Those who claim that the gay movement began at Stonewall—an assertion made by gay liberationists in the aftermath of the riots, repeated subsequently during pride marches, and now invoked commonly in the mainstream media—typically view the rebellion as unprecedented. They sometimes go so far as to claim that the riots were the first time that LGBT people fought back against oppression. From this perspective, the dark and dreary world of homosexuality in the pre-Stonewall era suddenly disappeared in June 1969 and was replaced by the light and bright universe of gay liberation. A campy version of this interpretation places emphasis on the fact that the funeral of Judy Garland—the actress and singer whose triumphs and tragedies had been followed by many LGBT fans and whose rendition of “Somewhere over the Rainbow” had inspired queer hopes for better futures—took place just hours before the riots began and contributed to their emotional intensity.\n\nThis is an idea that LGBTQ historians have pushed back on quite hard, and rightfully so. I suspect that this is part of the reason so much of early gay historiography is devoted to what happened before Stonewall, starting especially with John D’Emilio’s Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities: The Making of a Homosexual Minority in the United States, 1940-1970 (1983), which I covered for LGBTQ Literature.\n\nAccording to D’Emilio, developments in the 1940s and 1950s—principally national mobilization during World War II and political repression during the McCarthy era—led to the emergence of an organized “homophile” movement in the 1950s and 1960s. Founded by Los Angeles leftists in 1950–51, the Mattachine Society was soon joined by ONE, Incorporated, in Los Angeles (founded in 1952), the Daughters of Bilitis in San Francisco (founded in 1955), and other homophile groups elsewhere. These organizations lobbied and litigated for reform, supported research and education, and achieved important successes in the pre-Stonewall era, including a 1958 U.S. Supreme Court victory that established the constitutional rights of these groups to publish their periodicals. While they sometimes criticized gay bars and presented themselves as respectable alternatives, homophile groups also published informative bar guides, challenged discriminatory police raids, rejected unfair liquor control practices, provided valuable legal advice, and supported courageous litigation by bar patrons, workers, and owners. More generally, they laid the foundations for the riots by changing the consciousness of the community and country, challenging the gender and sexual oppression of U.S. society, and promoting the notion that LGBT people were entitled to freedom, equality, and justice.\n\nOf course, as Stein notes, this school has its critics:\n\nCritics of this framework, however, argue that the pre-Stonewall homophiles of the 1950s and 1960s had limited success in attracting large numbers of participants, garnering significant public attention, and achieving major social reforms. They point out that much of the homophile movement—even in the second half of the 1960s—was ambivalent about gay bars and critical of disreputable clubs like the Stonewall. Most homophile activists supported the constitutional rights of gay people to gather in bars and were critical of discriminatory police raids and liquor control practices, but many embraced the politics of respectability. This led them to criticize gender and sexual practices that they commonly associated with gay bars, including casual sex, sexual promiscuity, sex work, public sex, erotic expression, and gender transgression.\n\nStein notes that a third interpretative framework has been developed for understanding Stonewall—one that explains Stonewall as a kind of natural outgrowth of decades of bar-based resistance practices among LGBTQ people. But that kind of interpretation doesn’t say much about the gay liberation movement that sprung up after the rebellion.\n\nAnd then there is the idea—one that I find persuasive (in combination with the others)—that you can situate Stonewall in the context of general political radicalization in the late 1960s:\n\nThe limitations of the interpretations presented thus far have led to the development of another framework, one that situates the riots in relation to the general radicalization of political activism in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This explanation, that the riots were inspired and influenced by other social movements, was favored by many post-Stonewall gay liberationists, who saw themselves as part of a broad-based social justice coalition, and it has been mentioned or emphasized by many historians who have written about Stonewall.15 Perhaps the greatest inspiration was the African American movement, which increasingly adopted a “black power” orientation in the mid-1960s. We see this influence in the pre-Stonewall use of slogans like “Gay Is Good” and “Gay Power,” which were adaptations or appropriations of “Black Is Beautiful” and “Black Power,” and in the LGBT movement’s adoption of direct action tactics, including demonstrations, sit-ins, and riots. The 1965 Watts Rebellion in Los Angeles, when African Americans rioted in response to police racism and economic impoverishment, and subsequent riots against racism in 1966, 1967, and 1968 directly inspired the Stonewall rebellion.\n\nAnother important question tackled by historians and non-historians alike has to do with the effects of Stonewall. How directly did Stonewall change the already existing gay movement? How direct a line can you draw from Stonewall to the important legal and cultural changes that happened in the years that followed? Stein notes that one way to approach this question is to argue that Stonewall represented a major break in LGBTQ history, so much so that you can divide LGBTQ history into “pre-Stonewall” and “post-Stonewall” (indeed, that is a popular approach). Stein delves into some of the other approaches to this question:\n\nAnother approach—typically embraced by liberal reformers rather than radical revolutionaries—sees the Stonewall era as leading to slow, steady, and linear progress toward universally shared goals. Those who use this framework tend to see the major reforms of the post-Stonewall era—declassification of homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder, LGBT inclusion in the military, decriminalization of sodomy, legalization of cross-dressing, recognition of same-sex marriage, legitimization of LGBT families, and LGBT visibility in mainstream media—as direct outgrowths of the riots. Supporters of this approach often focus on the mass mobilization triggered by the rebellion, which led to the proliferation of LGBT organizations and their engagement in multiple forms of political activism. Critics respond that progress has not been linear; reforms have been partial, limited, qualified, and incomplete; the changes that have occurred should not necessarily be characterized as progress; and the goals that have been achieved are not universally celebrated. Many of the people who participated in the Stonewall Riots and many who joined the LGBT movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, for example, rejected liberal inclusion in U.S. society, favoring revolutionary transformation instead.\n\nWhen discussing post-Stonewall history, many radicals offer narratives of declension (decline) rather than progress. Those who favor this framework commonly see the Stonewall moment (often conceptualized as lasting from 1969 to 1973) as one of radical potential that was lost as the LGBT movement moderated, mainstreamed, bureaucratized, and institutionalized. For example, many in the Stonewall generation were opposed to the Vietnam War, critiqued organized religion, challenged corporate capitalism, and attacked the nuclear family, whereas the mainstream LGBT movement of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries celebrates military inclusion, religious acceptance, business support, marriage equality, and LGBT reproduction. Many in the Stonewall generation favored grassroots local organizing and direct-action protests; the mainstream LGBT movement of today is led by powerful national groups that focus on electoral politics, legislative lobbying, and court-based litigation. From these perspectives, the LGBT movement, after taming and tempering the radical politics of 1969–73, picked up where pre-Stonewall homophile activism left off, meaning that the riots only briefly interrupted a movement that generally has been defined by liberal rather than radical politics. Much of this exaggerates the radicalism of the Stonewall generation and minimizes the complexities of pre-1969 and post-1973 LGBT politics, but there are compelling reasons to adopt and accept narratives of post-Stonewall declension.\n\nOh, and then there is the question of “who”? Or, as Stein puts it, “Whose riots?” This is where you’ll especially find quite a bit of controversy today among people to whom the riots are important.\n\nLGBT people have long staked their claims to Stonewall, but they often have done so in contested and contentious ways. On the historical questions, most accounts of the riots emphasize the participation of gay men; many highlight the roles played by trans resisters and gender queers; some note that lesbians were among the first to fight back; others mention bisexuals and people who identified as neither gay nor straight or as both gay and straight. There have been particularly intense debates about the presence, participation, and prominence of three individuals: Sylvia Rivera, commonly identified as Puerto Rican, gay, and trans; Marsha P. Johnson, commonly identified as African American, gay, and trans; and Stormé DeLarverie, commonly identified as African American, mixed race, butch, lesbian, and trans. Multiple sources on the riots reference these and other individuals, but many accounts are incomplete, inconsistent, and in conflict about key details. Some argue that it is important that credit be given where credit is due; others complain that many of these discussions are ahistorical and say more about the identity politics of later moments than they do about the Stonewall Riots; still others argue that in historicizing the riots we should place more emphasis on social and structural factors rather than individual actions and activities. In these discussions, there are justifiable concerns about the class, gender, and race politics of questioning some sources more than others. In these contexts, it is challenging to avoid both minimization and exaggeration.\n\nIf you’re looking for definitive answers to any of these questions, you’re not going to find them—in Stein’s book or anywhere else, for that matter. And that’s not the purpose of the book. Rather, the purpose is exploration of the primary sources themselves, as Stein notes early in the introduction:\n\nBy providing an introductory essay, transcripts of two hundred primary sources, and a selection of maps and photographs, The Stonewall Riots: A Documentary History hopes to promote new interpretations, innovative analyses, and original explorations by everyone who examines these materials.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I have barely scratched the surface of these primary sources. For historians and anybody else interested in Stonewall or LGBTQ history, this book appears to be a treasure trove. There are three parts (which seem quite logical): “Before Stonewall,” “Stonewall,” and “After Stonewall.” Unlike previous anthologies, Stein chose a pretty narrow time period: 1965 to 1973. And this is a good move, I think, especially since the focus is Stonewall—it allows for much more depth than other primary source readers have been able to accomplish. Sources come from six major cities: New York (of course), Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. All of the sources are LGBTQ, except for Supreme Court cases. Something to appreciate about this collection is that Stein made a deliberate effort to include more sources that pertain to race, African Americans, and other people of color—this is so often missing (or poorly done) in these primary source collections.\n\nLike I said, this is less a “review” than it is a tip that this book exists. Do look into it if your interest is sparked. As I prep my courses for the summer and fall, I know I’ll be spending quite a bit of time going through the sources Stein has assembled in this collection.\n\nUpcoming LGBTQ Literature Schedule:\n\nJuly 26: OPEN\n\nAugust 30: OPEN\n\nSeptember 27: OPEN\n\nOctober 25: OPEN\n\nNovember 29: Kalisiin\n\nDecember 27: OPEN\n\nPlease comment below or send me a message if you want to take an open date.
