        "text": "Students in U.S. high schools can get free digital access to The New York Times until Sept. 1, 2021.\n\nNext month is the 52nd anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. On June 28, 1969, police officers raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City, with the stated purpose of reprimanding unlicensed bars that were illegally selling alcohol. Police raids on gay bars at the time were routine; the raid on that evening in 1969, however, incited a protest that galvanized the modern gay rights movement.\n\nIn June 2019, The New York Times published a series of articles and videos commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. We have gathered some of the videos and essays that were published as part of that series, along with additional archival material from The Times, to provide you with six different ways to learn about Stonewall and its legacy.\n\nComplete this K/W/L chart or make your own with three columns: What I Know, What I Want to Know and What I Learned. Fill out the first column with the information you already know about Stonewall and continue to add to the “W” and “L” columns throughout this lesson.\n\nPart 2: Watch a short film.\n\nThe 10-minute film below includes interviews with people who were involved in the Stonewall uprising, as well as conversations with contemporary activists who reflect on the meaning and significance of Stonewall five decades later. As you watch, add to your chart and then discuss more using the questions below.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
