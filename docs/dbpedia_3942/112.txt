In June 1969, New York City police raided a popular Mafia-run gay bar in Greenwich Village called the Stonewall Inn. At the time, such raids were hardly uncommon. But the reaction to this one was.

Incensed at the constant harassment and repression, the men and women in the bar fought back, bringing six days of protests and demonstrations to the streets. The event, which came to be known as the Stonewall rebellion, sparked the modern gay-rights movement in America.

The summer of 2019 marks its 50th anniversary, and celebrations are planned around the world. The event is being recognized in the app world too. To learn moreâor start learningâabout a turning point in American history, read on.

Before Stonewall and After Stonewall

These two documentariesâreleased in 1984 and 1999, respectivelyâcover the history of the gay-rights movement before and after the rebellion.
