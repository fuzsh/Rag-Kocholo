        "text": "British actor, writer, and director born as John Theobald Clarke in Stratford, London on 22 July 1926. He is one of the most important names in the British film industry. He studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art but dropped out before graduating because they wouldn't let him act professionally and he needed the income. The first films he co-wrote were The Black Knight (1954), and The Cockleshell Heroes (1955). In 1959, he co-founded a production company with his lifelong friend Richard Attenborough. His directorial debut was Whistle Down the Wind (1961). In 1965, he headed to Hollywood, and wrote and directed several films including King Rat (1965), The Wrong Box (1966), and Dead Fall (1968). He went to the UK and worked there then returned to Hollywood to direct The Stepford Wives (1975), and three years later International Velvet (1978), which he wrote and produced. His last film as a writer was Chaplin (1992). He was married twice and had 2 children. He passed away on 8 May 2013 in Surrey, UK."
