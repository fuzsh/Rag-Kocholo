This is the case with actress Sandra Bullock, who is now open to dating and reemerging back into public life two years after taking an indefinite break from acting.\n\nThe actress, who was absent from the spotlight following her longtime partner's death from ALS in August 2023, is gradually making her way back into the entertainment industry and seems ready to explore dating life once again. “Sandra’s gradually reemerging into public life,” a source told Us Weekly.\n\n“She’s excited about what the future holds. She’s ready to get back in the game.”\n\nBullock has reportedly she spent time reflecting on her accomplishments, which included a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2005 and about 50 incredible movies under her belt. However, in March 2022, the star announced she would be taking a break from the entertainment industry following the release of her latest romantic comedy film, The Lost City. When asked how long her Hollywood hiatus would be, Sandra responded, \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I don't know... until I don't feel like I feel now when I'm in front of a camera,\" she added. Since then, her only cameo has been in the 2022 action comedy Bullet Train, alongside her Lost City co-star Brad Pitt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComing to the death of her longtime partner and the love of her life of eight years, photographer Bryan Randall was diagnosed with ALS in 2020. There is no known cure for ALS, which happens to be a fatal motor neuron disease that causes nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain to progressively deteriorate.\n\nOn August 6, 2023, Bryan died after a three-year battle with the disease. A source from her family, after his passing, told PEOPLE that Randall's death has been quite hard on the actress and she leaned on loved ones for support. She also shifted her focus to raising her kids.\n\nAs of 2024, she is set to return to the screens. The actress is all set to star alongside Nicole Kidman in a sequel to their 1998 popular romantic fantasy film, Practical Magic.\n\nWhile HBO Max had explored doing a spinoff series in 2019 named Rules of Magic based on Hoffman’s prequel novel, nothing ever came out of that project. We are super excited to witness the return of Sandra Bullock in the movies soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nALSO READ: Sandra Bullock is 'Very Happy to Be a Mom' as She Turns 60; Source Reveals Everyone Helped 'Life Her Up' After Her Partner's Death"
