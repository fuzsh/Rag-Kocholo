        "text": "Steams Like Old Times\n\nKaren (Megan Mullally) is finally forced to come to terms with her feelings for her presumed-dead husband when Jack (Sean Hayes) surprisingly tells her he thinks she belongs with Stanley, not Malcolm (guest star Alec Baldwin). Karen is adamant that she will never forgive Stan and wants nothing to do with him-until Malcolm informs her that Stan has given her to him without a fight. Meanwhile, the new, charitable Will (Eric McCormack) begins doting on the elderly Clyde (guest star Richard Chamberlain) and invites him to the Tenth Anniversary Game Night Spectacular, much to Graceâs (Debra Messing) dislike. He is worried that he will end up like Clyde one day-a lonely old gay, but it turns out that the old man and Will donât have as much in common as originally thought.\n\nChuck Versus the Fear of Death\n\nAfraid that his latest setback is driving a wedge between him and Sarah, Chuck resolves to prove himself by going on a dangerous mission with the overeager Agent Rye. Meanwhile, Morgan and Casey scramble as the \"Buy Morons\" attempt to uncover the true identity of Greta."
