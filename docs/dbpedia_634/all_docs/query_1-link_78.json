        "text": "On 1 February 1951, Limerick born actress Constance Smith married Bryan Forbes, an English film director, actor and writer. Constance had known Forbes for three years.\n\nForbes was best known for directing the 1961 film Whistle Down the Wind and the 1975 film The Stepford Wives. He won a BAFTA award, and was nominated for an Oscar for his 1960 screenplay, The Angry Silence.\n\nThey married in Caxton Hall, London, when Forbes was 24 years old. Sadly, the newly weds were never able to go on honeymoon as Forbes had to report immediately to his play, The Holly and the Ivy, and she to Tyrone Power for her film, The House in the Square.\n\nTheir marriage was short lived. In June 1955 Constance divorced Forbes upon charges of desertion. Forbes went on to marry fellow British actress, Nanette Newman, the same year. He remained married to Newman until his death in 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, Constance married twice more. First to the son of an Italian politician and finally to Paul Rotha, a film producer who was over twenty years her senior. Rotha passed away in 1984 and Constance remained unmarried until her death in 2003."
