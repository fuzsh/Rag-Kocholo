        "text": "This film was distributed under the Lauder Gilliat logo; produced by Leslie Gilliat and directed by Sidney Gilliat. It was adapted from the Kingsley Amis novel, That Uncertain Feeling, by Bryan Forbes. The Boulting Brothers had had a success with an earlier Amis adaptation, Lucky Jim (1957), which was presumably a factor in this production. Amis was given to satirical comedies. At this time he was living in Swansea and the book mocks Welsh culture and its attempts to distinguish it from the dominant English culture. This carries over into the film; it does have a tone of English mean-mindedness.\n\nThe protagonist John Lewis (Peter Sellers) is a librarian in a small Welsh seaside town. He is knowledgeable on books but shows little interest in indigenous Welsh culture. His wife Jean (Virginia Maskell) is tied to the home and their two children. John has a roving eye; he does suggest a little of the lecher. This is in contrast to his colleague Ieuan Jenkins (Kenneth Griffith); both are thinking of applying for a promotion. John meets Liz (Mai Zetterling), the wife of a local councillor who also chairs the library committee. Liz is an obvious ‘man-eater’ and makes a set at John; flouting her affluence and standing out from the crowd. He is happy to get involved but their attempts to have sex are always frustrated. The drama comes to a head when John and Liz slip out of a Welsh play and thus miss the fire that burns down the hall. Thus Jean discovers John’s dalliance; her complaint suggests that this is not the first. However, thanks to Liz, John is offered the promotion but he turns it down because he realises it will put him under the thumb of the controlling Liz. We last see him with Jean running a mobile library.\n\nApart from the tone of the satire the other problem with the film is its treatment of sex. Basically, John and Liz never consummate, so he can return to marital life still ‘pure’. This was a typical approach of the 1950s films and it carries on into the 1960s. John Hill in his second chapter on ‘Working Class Realism’ discusses how this limitation affects a number of the British New Wave films. Even the fact that Jean has an attempted dalliance with the local poet and playwright Probert (Richard Attenborough) fits into this repression.\n\nSellers, in one his better acting roles, is convincing and has a proper Welsh accent. His turnabout at the film’s climax is less convincing, down to the script not preparing this. Virginia Maskell is excellent as the taken-for-granted wife. Apparently Sellers wanted her replaced with a Welsh actor; whilst her accent is slightly inconsistent, this does not justify Sellers’ demand, a sign of his growing egotism.\n\nMai Zetterling is excellent as the sexy and controlling Liz. In one of the bizarre aspects of the production she was shadowed by MI5 operatives for supposed communistic leanings! Also bizarre is the X Certificate awarded by the British Board of Film Censors. The ending is moral and the closest the audience get to anything sexy is a naked Liz seen by John in a mirror. Previous X Certificates had been for serious dramas and horror.\n\nAttenborough is adequate but he only has three brief scenes and is clearly only there for the satire and a couple of weak jokes. The film is not that funny for a satire and my memory of first seeing it is that I found that the case in the early 1960s. The film does use locations effectively. And the supporting cast, especially Kenneth Griffith are good. The cinematography and editing work fine but are not that distinctive. But the score by Richard Rodney Bennett is fine.\n\nBlack and white, 1.66:1, running time 106 minutes"
