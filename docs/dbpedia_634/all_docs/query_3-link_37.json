        "text": "Dean John Griffin Presents the FASC Spring/Summer 2024 Newsletter\n\nPrior to the busyness that will accompany the beginning of the new academic year, I look back on the Spring 2024 semester, which served as a remarkable conclusion to the 2023-2024 academic year. Commencement was a joyful occasion, where we graduated 537 undergraduate students and 175 graduate students, of which eight earned their doctoral degrees. Honored speakers included Assemblyman Lou Greenwald and Brian Bridges, Secretary of Higher Education.\n\nOur growth was evident in the number of staff welcomed this semester, including new administrative assistants for several departments and programs. Faculty received awards that recognized both their teaching and research – Dr. Benedetto Piccoli, Distinguished Professor of Mathematical Science, received the W.T. and Idalia Reid Prize from the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and Dr. Emily Marker, Associate Professor of History, was named the recipient of the George Louis Beer Prize from the American Historical Association, just to name a few.\n\nThrough the leadership of Dr. Kwangwon Lee, Professor of Biology, and Dr. Nathan Fried, Associate Teaching Professor of Biology, the Department of Biology received grant funding to continue to grow the number of students of underrepresented backgrounds who are pursuing a STEM degree, and to offer them support. Faculty such as Dr. Tyler Hoffman, Professor of English, were invited to give keynote addresses at seminal events such as the 150th anniversary of the poet Robert Frost’s birth, a testimony to their prominence in the field.\n\nOur students continue to impress with their achievements. Paul Boyd, a philosophy major, was named a 2024 Harry S. Truman Scholar, the first Rutgers–Camden student and only the sixteenth Rutgers University student to ever receive this prestigious honor. What an accomplishment, indeed!\n\nWith such incredible achievements, I am eager to see what great things our faculty, staff, and students accomplish in the 2024-2025 academic year. I hope you will join us on what is sure to be an exciting journey.\n\nI hope the rest of your summer is one of health and happiness. See you in September!\n\nJohn Griffin\n\nDean, Faculty of Arts and Sciences–Camden\n\nDepartment Highlights\n\nDonations\n\nForensic Science Program\n\nThe Forensic Science Program received a generous donation from the late Dr. Richard and Mrs. Gail Saferstein.
