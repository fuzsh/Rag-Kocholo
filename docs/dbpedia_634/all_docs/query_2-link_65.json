        "text": "London Cabbie: The sign says \"no smoking.\"\n\nGiles De’ Ath: No, the sign says \"thank you for not smoking.\" As I am smoking, I don't expect to be thanked.\n\nSometimes, now and again, a terrific film comes along which, for whatever reason, slips the net despite the enthusiasm of the critics. This, alas, might be the case with Love and Death on Long Island (1997), based on Gilbert Adair’s novel of 1990, and starring John Hurt as Giles De’ Ath, a curmudgeonly, academic, oh-so-English man of letters, obsessed with a young American actor, teen heartthrob, twenty-something Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley), star of Skid Marks (“you’re nothing but a skidmark on the underpants of life”), Tex Mex and Hotpants College II.\n\nJohn Hurt is one of those subtle film actors, like Anthony Hopkins or Ian Holm, who can do no wrong by my book. Somehow, you know their films— however good, bad or indifferent, will always be worth a gander. For their performances. Witness Anthony Hopkins in Bryan Forbes’ International Velvet (1978), all the glamour of the gymkhana, a film for horsy little girls— and a guilty pleasure, or Ian Holm as the appalling Corporal Himmelstoss in the made-for-television remake of All Quiet on the Western Front (1979).\n\nLeave a comment"
