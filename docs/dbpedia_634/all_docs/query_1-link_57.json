        "text": "Kevin Hart stars in Netflix’s action-packed, heist movie Lift, directed by F. Gary Gray and produced by Hart and Bryan Smiley through their production company, Hartbeat.\n\nThe actor portrays Cyrus, the leader of a kick-ass team of thieves. Freshly back from Venice, where they just successfully operated their latest robbery, Cyrus and his team are requisitioned by Interpol’s agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) for a dangerous mission, involving millions of dollars in gold, and an eco-terrorist named Lars Jorgensen, played by Jean Reno.\n\nWith a budget of $100 million dollar, Lift allows Hart to dive into a more serious role, which suits him as much as the comedy roles. This is not a first for the actor: we have already witnessed his range in some of his previous movies, such as Fatherhood (2021), in which Hart portrayed a father raising his daughter on his own after his wife’s death. But even if Hart’s impeccable comedic timing led him to star in great comedies in the past, I asked the actor what he had discovered about himself as an actor, taking on this thrilling, more serious role: ‘’The biggest discovery is that I enjoy being serious just as much as I enjoy the space and place of funny’’ tells me Kevin Hart over Zoom.\n\nHe continued: “Also having fun at the job, when you can show up at work and be excited, that means that you’re gonna get out of it what you’re putting into it. The more serious role, the leading man, the guy being the mastermind, putting the pieces together, and letting the team around feed of that energy, that was a new space to play in and it is a space I don’t think I‘m gonna stop playing in anytime soon. I now have some more lead way to do more, so we will see what the world brings after, but I think Lift is definitely the start of what will be more. ‘’\n\n‘’Kevin and the company have done films like Fatherhood, very dramatic in nature” added Bryan Smiley. ‘’ I could see the wide range of what the can do as an actor and producer, so that wasn’t that different, but it was a very exciting movie to do because of the scale of it, and the action and our amazing creative partners. ‘’\n\nWhile every member of this team has very specific skills, like flying planes and hacking highly-secured system, Cyrus is the one elaborating the plans. In order to do so, Cyrus needs a safe-cracker by his side, and a funny one at that, here played by Billy Magnusson. I asked the actor which other member of the team he would have liked to portray, and which skill he was the most jealous of: ‘’It’s always gonna be comedy. Watching Billy in this movie was a lot of fun. He is an amazingly talented guy, extremely funny, very very funny. It‘s always on the back of my head, like ‘oh that was good, I wish I did that or that I could have ping pong out of that more‘. But in this case, you gotta hold it back, and really just stay on the lane of seriousness and leader, and let the other one score, as much as they possibly can. That’s what the movie requires and that’s what is gonna make the movie better.’’\n\nPortraying Cyrus was also very physical, involving badass stunts and action sequences. However, while preparing to fight a bunch of eco-terrorists 40,000 feet in the air might sound kind of intense, this wasn’t actually the most troubling part for he actor: ‘’The most complicated actually wasn’t the action or the fighting. That boat, you know that water in Venice, we had some choppy water on some of those days. That’s what I am gonna say, not the action, not the fighting, that boat kicked my ass. ‘’\n\nHart added : “The plane was built, and there were rotating machines to create the atmosphere of being in the air, although they can get a little rocky, that water, because it was hot, we were wearing full suits, just going around Venice in circle, doing this chase, that’s where it got a little tough.‘’\n\nNetflix and Hartbeat could very well team up again for a sequel of Lift. But what really makes the spectators care about a heist movie, is the relationship between each member of the team, which we can clearly witness in Lift. However, seeing how they all met, and even watching them operate their first robbery together, might just be the next step for Hart: ‘’When you have those conversations, you’re having them based on what the level of engagement and reception is, from the fanbase, we wanna see people show up, fall in love with the characters and story, if done correctly, then you’re looking at a future where were talking about Lift 2. In success, I definitely think we will be seeing more go that but I don’t like to speak prematurely”'.\n\nSo would Lift 2 be a sequel, or more of a prequel ? “'I think that’s where part 2 turns into. Part 2 is not about the next one, it is about the first one.” said Hart. “It is the one that got them to this, that dives a little deeper, that tells you who they are, so you understand why the Feds were like ’Ok, we wanna go to Cyrus’, what was the things they were close to catching, and the things that they didn’t catch. You go backwards.‘’\n\nBelfast, London, Venice: Lift was filmed in incredible places. But a movie set can also bring a lot to an actor’s performance, either by giving more context to a character‘s background, or yet again helping the heroes achieve their conquest, Hart explained: ‘’ There was a backdrop we created when we were in London, that acted as Cyrus apartment, that really added a lot of color and to the character and to the performance. His apartment is basically a fake visual of the things he has, and the only person that would know that is Abby, because she knows the art that he has stolen in the past. So, her coming in, and questioning certain things, and Cyrus‘ response, it tells a nice little story about their world before. And I wanna say that working that apartment, doing the things on that balcony, that was the best set piece for me, because it just told more about who Cyrus actually was. You didn’t have to go through flashbacks, you did it through Abby’s dialogue, which was great. ‘’"
