        "text": "It’s no secret that a film or television distribution company will typically spend at least three times the actual production cost on marketing and distribution fees. In a world of billions of eyeballs being barraged by competing media, the only way an entertainment project can succeed is with highly creative, economically efficient, strategic promotional marketing and well-placed publicity. Brian has been a leader in the field of highly creative promotional marketing for the largest motion picture and television production and distribution companies in the Western World.\n\nLess common are the days when motion pictures projects are fully financed and then distribute by major studios and distribution companies. This has lead to a variety of creative financing and the producer may find it necessary to gather a patchwork of financing to realize a project. We can help guide production financing through the maze of options from private investors; grants; tax credits and non-profit sponsorship; crowd funding; territorial or subsidiary distribution rights and presales; gap funding; negative pickup deals and completion bonds.\n\nWe can also help negotiate distribution choices which include theatrical; direct to video or DVD; streaming; digital sales. And we can help with foreign rights sales to other markets."
