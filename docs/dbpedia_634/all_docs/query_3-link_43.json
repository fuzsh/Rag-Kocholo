Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.\n\nRegularly hitting the gym during winter (or any time of year, really) is tough. Bad weather, busy schedules and travel time can easily derail a well-intentioned fitness plan. It’s easy to see the allure of a home gym because its convenience is hard to beat. Simply roll out of bed and show up. If you don’t have an extra unused room to dedicate to a home gym, the garage is a good alternative (especially if your garage has the right flooring for a home gym).\n\nGetting the layout and setup right, however, can be a challenge, especially if you’re planning to use the garage for other purposes like parking a car or storage. Thankfully some design-forward garage gym setups provide ideas and inspiration. Here are a few garage gym before-and-after projects that make working up a sweat convenient.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Get help from a local expert today through Angi.\n\nExplore Options\n\n1. Creating Activity Zones\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nWhen planning your space, think about creating zones for specific activities. Interior Designer Jessica Preteroti cleverly uses green-painted arches to designate each area of her garage, including weight training and ballet barre spaces. “The garage gym was a fun, one-week project that challenged me to think vertically to create stylish and functional storage solutions which allow this garage space to double as a parking space when hosting guests,” she told Forbes Home.\n\nVertical shelves installed inside each arch store equipment like straps, free weights and yoga blocks. Resilient vinyl plank flooring in the barre area is water-proof, ideal in a garage that’s exposed to the outdoors when the door is open. Thanks to three side windows, natural light is plentiful and bright. Little details also make this space functional and inviting, like shelves installed below the windows for devices, a water bottle and a towel.\n\n2. Space Constraints\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nWhen a client approached Gavin Smith of ScotHome about using his tandem garage for a personal training business, he knew he would have to get creative. The long and skinny dimensions required a layout with enough space between equipment. Lighting was also a consideration to address deep dark corners when the garage door was closed.\n\n“He [client] asked us to install LED lighting, power and heating, as well as boxing in and concealing services such as heating boiler and gas pipes,” Smith said. A wall-mounted TV, painted walls and custom flooring give the space that classic edgy gym feel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Elevated Storage\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nIf you have a three-car garage and don’t own three cars, consider using that extra space for a home gym. Rusty Halm and his team at Garage Living transformed a builder-grade unfinished garage into a multi-functional space. “The homeowner wanted the garage to be an extension of their home, with closed storage and a space to work out,” Halm told Forbes Home.\n\nHalm said he installed wall slats to hide exposed plumbing and create stylish off-ground storage for most items. Custom flooring offers a safer no-slip surface, and foldable gym equipment lays flat against the wall when not in use to maintain an open, clutter-free look.\n\n4. Function First\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nRedditor Tyson800 told Forbes Home that he had several different types of home gyms over the years and decided to build out his garage as he invested in a high-quality rack: “I wanted to start buying good equipment that will last. I also wanted my gym to look nice, to be functional and not cluttered.\n\nWith the power rack as the primary focal point, he arranged his other equipment around it for space and good flow while training. Gray paint and interlocking floor tiles anchor the minimal and clean look. Framed movie prints and potted plants cozy it up and round out the design. “I wanted it to feel inviting and comfortable. It’s my favorite room in my house,” he said.\n\n5. Statement Lighting\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nUnless the garage door is open to natural light during workout sessions, adequate lighting in a garage gym is essential. And why not make it an interesting design feature? LED ceiling lighting became the main event in this garage-to-gym conversion, also by Gavin Smith’s ScotHome.\n\n“We suggested high-end 6000k dimmable LED tape in profile as we have been using a lot of these products lately with huge success,” Smith said. It provides a large and consistent source of ambient light and brightens up the monochrome matte black look. Smith also improved the organization of the client’s equipment to create more space for other storage.\n\n6. Weekend Warrior\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nRedditor zPolaris43 said that when he was house-hunting last year, one of his must-haves was a garage large enough for the home gym he’d envisioned. He did most of the work himself, working around several space and layout constraints to accommodate his equipment: “That meant utilizing the walls and posts as much as possible and using stacked storage options.”\n\nIt took him six months to complete the gym’s drywall installation, painting, electrical wiring and light fixture installation. Sourcing high-quality equipment was also a priority, so he told Forbes Home that he allowed plenty of time to research options before purchasing: “It was a really fun learning process and I picked up valuable skills that come in handy as a homeowner.”\n\n7. Work in Progress\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nFitness Instagrammer Kat Sanqui turned a disorganized garage into a great-looking space that’s comfortable for her and her family’s exercise needs. While it’s still a work in progress, Sanqui says the Rogue rack, plates and dumbbells get them off to a good start: “From there, I have been slowly adding pieces for cardio, weights and machines.”\n\nRearranging the larger equipment onto gym mats improves safety and creates space-saving storage opportunities. An awkward alcove houses hanging straps and a rack for free weights and kettlebells. Chalkboard paint creates a convenient spot to write out workout plans (and keeps kids busy while the parents squeeze in a workout).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Multipurpose Design\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nConcealed storage is the star of the show in this multi-functional garage home gym, also by Garage Living’s Rusty Halm. He credits the popularity of home organization systems and homeowners’ desire for everything to have its proper place: “It goes hand in hand with the garage becoming more and more a part of the home and not a forgotten room.”\n\nLarge cabinet and drawer systems allow the garage to serve various purposes, including a home gym, dry sauna, wine cooling and everyday storage."
