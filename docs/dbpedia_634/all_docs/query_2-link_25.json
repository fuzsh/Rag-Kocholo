        "text": "He soon ventured into screenwriting, with The Cockleshell Heroes released in 1955, before forming the production company Beaver Films with his good friend Richard Attenborough. Their film Séance on a Wet Afternoon (1964) won a best actor BAFTA for Attenborough.\n\nA year later in 1961 Forbes directed his first feature, Whistle Down the Wind, which would become one of his best known works. After many more credits as writer and director, he took the helm of The Stepford Wives in 1975, based on the satirical thriller by Ira Levin. The film was an international hit.\n\nForbes continued to make popular films such as International Velvet (1978), on which he was writer, producer and director, and in 1992 wrote the screenplay for the Academy Award-nominated Chaplin.\n\nFilm critic Mark Kermode said on Twitter: “He was charming and self effacing. A great loss.”"
