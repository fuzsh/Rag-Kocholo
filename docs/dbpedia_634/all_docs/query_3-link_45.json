        "text": "Awards Session recognizes outstanding Knights and councils and includes performance by award-winning Canadian folk band Leahy\n\nQUÉBEC CITY, Aug. 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Knights of Columbus welcomed more than 2,500 Knights and their families, members of the Catholic hierarchy and special guests from 10 countries to its 142nd Supreme Convention in Québec City, Québec at the Supreme Knight's Award Session. The awards session annually recognizes individual Knights, councils, assemblies and jurisdictions throughout the world who have faithfully carried out the mission of the Order's Founder, Blessed Michael McGivney. These honorees exemplify how Knights live their faith in service to their family, parish, community and country through charitable outreach, fraternal leadership, membership growth and retention, and insurance sales and service.\n\nGuests at the Supreme Knight's Awards Session also enjoyed a performance by award-winning Canadian folk band Leahy. Over the course of their notable career, Leahy has received several Juno Awards, which recognize outstanding achievements in Canada's music industry, including Best New Group, Best Instrumental Artist, and Best Country Group or Duo.\n\nIn addition, Supreme Knight Patrick Kelly presented the annual International Program Awards. The Annual International Program Awards competition recognizes councils that conduct an outstanding program in each of the Faith in Action program categories: faith, family, community and life. The first-place winners and a brief description of their activity can be found below:\n\nFaith Programs\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas Council 15294\n\nSoutheast Missouri State University\n\nCape Girardeau, Missouri\n\nAnima Christi '24\n\nIn March of this year, 50 members of St. Thomas Aquinas Council 15294 hosted a week-long Eucharistic Pilgrimage with the goal of fostering greater devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. More than 600 pilgrims participated, and the pilgrimage spanned the entire length of the Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau in Southern Missouri.\n\nThe pilgrimage made stops at 22 parishes in the diocese and included all-night Eucharistic Adoration, Holy Hours, and 13 Eucharistic Processions. On the last day of the pilgrimage, Mass was celebrated by Most Rev. Edward Rice, the bishop of the Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, followed by the final Eucharistic Procession of the week. This procession included Fourth Degree Knights as well as other Knights from across the state. Through social media, the procession received 80,000 views from people across the world, making an impact far beyond Missouri.\n\nFamily Programs\n\nMason Council 9182\n\nMason, Michigan\n\nTragic Farm Accident\n\nAfter a tragic farm accident killed Jason McMahon of Council 9182, his brother Knights came to his family's aid, providing help on their farm and funds for immediate expenses. Desiring to do more, the council held a pig roast to raise money for the children's education fund. More than 500 people attended the event, which began with Mass, and also included a band, games, rides, a raffle, a silent auction, and more. Thanks to its efforts, the council presented the family with a check for $30,000. The event brought together the entire community in a time of disaster and grief.\n\nOur Lady of Guadalupe Council 17913\n\nLviv, Ukraine\n\nSupport of a Family-Type Orphanage\n\nCouncil 17913 launched a program to support a foster home in the village of Bortnyki, Stryi district, Lviv region. The program's main goal was material, spiritual, and psychological support for the children in the home. As part of this program, the council set itself the following tasks: provide all children with winter jackets, multi-season shoes, sweets, and other food products. An important part of this program was joint participation in the Eucharist, prayer activities, and fellowship.\n\nCommunity Programs\n\nPope Pius XII Council 5295\n\nNarragansett, Rhode Island\n\nJacob's Ladder, Men on a Mission\n\nCouncil 5295 established a partnership with Jacob's Ladder, an orphanage in Jamaica, to help care for children and adults with developmental and physical disabilities. Council members take annual mission trips to the facility, helping with construction and repair projects, participating in spiritual activities, such as Mass and daily prayer, and organizing recreational activities for residents.\n\nThe council organized the shipment of seven 40-foot shipping containers to the facility, containing adult diapers, clothing and other goods, valued at over $200,000. The council has also helped to replace the roof, paint the facility, and provide plumbing services. Additionally, with support from other donors, the council provided water heaters, washing machines, golf carts for transportation around the grounds, and an aquaponics system to the facility. Overall, the value of support from the council is nearly $500,000, and their service to the facility's residents continues today, with planning for new projects already underway.\n\nLife Programs\n\nPope St. John XXIII Council 15968\n\nSpokane, WA, USA\n\nRecovery Program for Newborns\n\nCouncil 15968 contributed 450 volunteer hours and $6,500 to constructing shelf storage and assembling 24 backpacks filled with baby supplies for a local clinic called Maddie's Place. Maddie's Place is 1 of 3 clinics in the U.S. that provide a recovery nursery for babies experiencing withdrawal due to prenatal substance abuse. The clinic also provides non-judgmental care and housing for their mothers.\n\nThe council received the shelving units from a local grocery store and installed them for the clinic. To collect donations for the backpacks, the council introduced Maddie's Place staff to parishioners during six Lenten fish dinners that followed the Stations of the Cross. The backpacks were filled with necessities purchased by the council, such as baby bottles, baby wash, diaper rash ointment, a baby grooming kit and more. The council also donated funds collected during the dinners to the center through the Orders' ASAP (Aid and Support After Pregnancy) program.\n\nInternational Family of the Year\n\nThe Ampe family – Joseph, his wife Tiffany, and their 11 children, Kelsey (22), Evan (20), Lucielle (18), Abigail (15), Sean (13), Ryan (11), Blaise (8), Mella Margaret (7), Cazimir (6), Henrik (5), and Isadora (4) – serve as a tremendous model of a faithful Catholic family.\n\nJoseph is a member of Council 689 in Marquette, MI, and he has been a Knight for 6 years. He and his family are very active in their parish and community. Tiffany aids in faith formation, prayer groups, and ministries to the sick and needy, and the children are also involved in many of these functions.\n\nThe Ampe children are homeschooled, and their family lives a homestead lifestyle where they grow their own produce and raise their own farm animals. They also have a consistent family prayer life, praying the rosary together every evening.\n\nIn 2018, Joseph and Tiffany adopted two children with Down Syndrome from Ukraine while Tiffany was pregnant with Isadora. Initially, they had planned to only adopt one child from Ukraine, but after praying and discerning when they arrived in the country, they decided to adopt a second child. In 2023, the Ampe family adopted a third child from Ukraine, Zygmunt, and a year later they adopted a fourth son with special needs from Texas, named Quintis. The Ampe family's decision to adopt Zygmunt, Cazimir, Henrik and Quintis is a testament to their incredible generosity and selflessness.\n\nSince the war in Ukraine began in 2022, the Ampe family has taken several trips to Ukraine and Poland to deliver over $200,000 worth of medical supplies, clothing, toys, religious items, and money to Ukrainian hospitals struggling to serve victims of war.\n\nThe Ampe family's actions demonstrate that everything they do is rooted in faith and charity. Their family life serves as inspiration for every Catholic family.\n\nBlessed Michael McGivney Medal\n\nThis award is given annually to a Knights of Columbus chaplain whose priestly zeal and exemplary service are in the finest traditions of our Founder.
