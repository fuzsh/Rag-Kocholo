        "text": "Had a bad relationship with writer William Goldman on Die Frauen von Stepford (1975), claiming he found Goldman arrogant and reluctant to rewrite his first-draft screenplay. Goldman in turn claimed that Forbes ruined the film by casting his wife Nanette Newman in a key role and that Forbes did all the rewriting himself at nights during filming. Despite this antagonism, Goldman got on well with Forbes' closest friend, Richard Attenborough, when they worked together soon after on both Die Brücke von Arnheim (1977) and Magic - Die Puppe des Grauens (1978). Many years later Attenborough hired Forbes to write the screenplay for Chaplin - Das Leben der unsterblichen Filmlegende (1992), but his draft was subsequently rewritten by . . . William Goldman (and others). As he made clear on Sir Richard Attenborough (1992), Forbes was very upset by this; he had no screenplay credits since then.\n\nHe met Nanette Newman after she turned up at a late night shoot at Marylebone shunting yards in the hope of getting a small part in Wheel of Fate (1953) but it turned out that that was the last night of filming. She told him she'd traveled all the way from Streatham, and he said he'd drive her home and that she'd be safe with him. That resulted in them being together for 50 years.\n\nHis salary as Head of Production/Managing Director of EMI-MGM Elstree was reported by The Times (March 26th 1971) as £35,000 p.a., although there were also several fringe benefits, including a percentage of the profits of all films produced under his aegis. The same article reported that, at this time, he could have been earning up to £150,000 per film, had he continued his own successful career as actor/screenwriter/producer/director. People were surprised, in fact, that Forbes should have taken the job, and when he do so, in 1969, he implied that he was doing it to \"save the British film industry\", as American investment in British cinema (which had been so useful throughout the 1960s) was now being severely curtailed. It is worth noting that almost all the films Forbes had made as director during the decade had been financial failures, so his motives may not have been entirely altruistic. As it turned out, Forbes was forced out of his position within two years, with most of the films he initiated being flops."
