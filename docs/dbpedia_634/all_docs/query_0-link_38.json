        "text": "British filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who directed the popular The Stepford Wives movie and founded The Writer’s Guild of Great Britain, has died.\n\nHe died in his house in Surrey, with all his family present, after a long illness. He was 86.\n\nKnown for his sharp, and oftentimes dry wit, Forbes (born John Theobald Clarke) once described himself as \"a writer who became an actor who became a screenwriter who became a director.\"\n\nAlthough he got into showbiz with supporting roles in British and Hollywood fare, Forbes’ big break came in 1960. He had started a new independent production company with his friend Richard Attenborough, and their first movie, The Angry Silence, got some Oscar buzz. Forbes was nominated for best original screenplay in 1961 for that film.\n\nAfter the success of The Angry Silence, Forbes experimented with directing, and in 1962 earned a BAFTA nomination for his first film, Whistle Down the Wind, about a young vagabond who poses as Jesus Christ.\n\nHe picked up more awards with British productions such as The L-Shaped Room and Séance on a Wet Afternoon, and then got lured to Hollywood to direct King Rat in 1965, about a rebellious and flamboyant American POW. The film got two more Oscar nods and attracted the attention of theatre impresario Bernard Delfont, who was then in charge of EMI.\n\nDelfont wanted Forbes to run Elstree Films, a British studio and Forbes took up the offer, but struggled to balance his artistic desires and business responsibilities. During this period, he made The Raging Moon (1971), starring his wife Nanette Newman as a woman paralyzed from the waist down who finds love. He left the studio two years later.\n\nForbes continued to make largely successful American movies, including 1975’s The Stepford Wives, the film for which he is best known. The film, starring Katharine Ross, was a satire of American suburbia, and its picture of brainwashed women behaving as automatons became a cultural touchpoint.\n\nUp until the early ‘90s, Forbes remained prolific in film, but also embarked on a writing career, penning darkly humorous depictions of showbiz. The Distant Laughter and Rewrite Man both draw on Forbes’ creative tribulations overseas, while his later work, 1995’s Partly Cloudy fully embraced comedy.\n\nForbes was a founder of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain and with Attenborough he helped form Capital Radio, a London station launched in 1973.\n\nHe was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2004 for his contribution to the arts. He is survived by his wife, Nanette Newman, and their two daughters, Emma and Sarah."
