        "text": "Film director Bryan Forbes has died at the age of 86.\n\nThe filmmaker is best known for shooting the 1975 movie The Stepford Wives.\n\nHe passed away after a long illness at his home in Virginia Water in Surrey.\n\nFamily friend Matthew D'Ancona told BBC News: \"Bryan Forbes was a titan of cinema, known and loved by people around the world in the film and theatre industries and known in other fields including politics.\n\n\"He is simply irreplaceable and it is wholly apt that he died surrounded by his family.\"\n\nForbes made his directorial debut with Whistle Down the Wind in 1961, and directed the likes of Sir Michael Caine (Deadfall), Malcolm McDowell (The Raging Moon) and Sir Roger Moore (The Naked Face).\n\nHe was born in Stratford, London and formed the production company Beaver Films with long-time collaborator Richard Attenborough.\n\nHe was married to Irish actress Constance Smith for four years, before divorcing her and marrying Stepford Wives star Nanette Newman.\n\nForbes and Newman had two daughters together - TV presenter Emma Forbes and journalist Sarah Standing.\n\nWatch a clip from The Stepford Wives below:"
