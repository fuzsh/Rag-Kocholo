It was based on the novel of the same name by John Boland.\n\nJack Hawkins played a disgruntled ex-army colonel who recruits a group of disheartened, money-hungry former servicemen to carry out an audacious bank heist. Each of the seven men left the army under unfortunate circumstances and has since fallen on hard times. The skills and discipline that they learned in the line of duty are now needed to pull off the highly complicated, rigidly choreographed robbery.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
