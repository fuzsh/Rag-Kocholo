        "text": "Heartbreaking study of loneliness in old age, grounded by a simply fantastic performance from Edith Evans. Gerry Turpin's stark monochrome photography captures the grim vistas of a Northern city (filmed in Oldham, Lancashire) remorselessly cleansing itself of its old buildings in a push for the new and modern. With incisive subtlety writer/director Bryan Forbes depicts Evans as similarly out of time, the wrecking balls of greed and indifference buffeting her security and her sanity.\n\nAmong the many who mistreat or neglect her, estranged husband Eric Portman's eyes display a coldness that has atrophied his empathy, unlike the kind eyes of social assistance administrator Gerald Sim, one of the few benign characters she encounters. Forbes extracts strong performances from the entire…\n\nI'm not sure the thriller elements were necessary; the movie might have been stronger if it had held less plot and fewer characters. As it is, it seems structureless and disorganized, in a \"well, we've exhausted that -- let's bring something else in\" way.\n\nBut Edith Evans, throughout, is an astonishingly powerful performer; this dotty old woman, barely coping, barely able to negotiate consensus reality, is one of the most complete screen performances I've ever seen, and the shabby, bedraggled (Manchester) settings show post-imperial England on the edge of falling down. Kitchen sink squared, this is the veriest squalor.\n\n\"Are you there?\"\n\nI have to thank Trolleyfreak and his review of this to convince me to finally check it out on YouTube and I'm glad I did although I must admit to finding it incredibly heartbreaking.\n\nThe 78 year old Edith Evans delivers a tour de force performance in the central role of Mrs Ross, a lonely old and impoverished woman with delusions of grandeur and paranoia. For much of the film's running time it is undoubtedly her movie, but the ever reliable Eric Portman arrives in the film's latter half, paying against type as an ageing working class northern drifter and estranged hubby of Evans, and is equally impressive - although the story does seem in danger of…\n\nI tend to skim over short synopses so I often have at least a slightly off idea going in of whatever I’m watching. So when I added this to my watchlist years ago I pictured it as a Wait Until Dark type film, but this is more Seller’s The Father stripped down to the kitchen sink. I wasn’t expecting to be so devastated in such a brutally painful way. Forbes has some great expressive camerawork and framing here and the score is haunting. So many pitch perfect performances, from the leads to the ancillary characters. A great film about loneliness, old age, mental illnesses, broken systems and the broken people with in them. It tends to move too slowly for it’s own good and for whatever reason I’ve always liked Forbes’ films for the most part though he has never taken me to great heights.\n\nEdith Evans' performance in The Whisperers is truly astounding. The kind of performance where you don't know whether you should be concerned for the character, for the actress, or for both. Just look at all the emotions she runs through in the scene she discovers the money - this is not the kind of acting you expect from one of the grandes dames of the British stage.\n\nBryan Forbes films ranked\n\nCaught somewhere in the hinterland between commercial and art cinema - and once more between what cinema could be and television definitely was. This quietly observed piece swells on the micro performance of Edith Evans but sags when she’s offscreen (a subplot for an enlarged role for a perfectly decent Eric Portman creating much of this sidelining).\n\nA near-exclusive focus on Mrs Ross’s situation probably wouldn’t have gained funding, and was a style of cinema a few years away (Evans and Chantal Ackerman would have been an interesting crossover), but when it works it’s a powerful piece of smoothly bleak cinema.\n\nEdith Evans brings extraordinary delicacy to an otherwise blunt instrument of a movie. It’s bleak even by the standards of kitchen-sink realism. With young protagonists, the movement’s films had a built-in glimmer of hope, but that’s painfully absent as 76-year-old Margaret hears voices, staves off loneliness, and gets mercilessly exploited by strangers and family.\n\nThat the film breathes at all is due to Evans. She brings no vanity or judgement to Margaret’s haughty delusions, numbing routine, and dubious fears. Given her situation, her lucid moments are even sadder.\n\nThe final stretch sags without her; the focus shifts to a one-dimensional supporting character in a thin crime subplot. Margaret returns just in time to crush your heart before the credits role. …\n\nWhat really is “post-apocalyptic?”\n\nMost of us assume the post-apocalyptic refers to a future time, someplace later than now.\n\nHowever, the greatest post-apocalyptic films see the post-apocalyptic in the present.\n\nThe Whisperers is a film about the implosion of the technocratic, institutionalized, social democratic state of England in the 60s. Its a film about living in the ruins of modernity, alone, in a society that has displaced community with systems, a culture always already caught up and ensnarled within a control network of inhuman welfare, psychiatric and health institutions. Its a film where there is little work but much crime. Its not just that the old are alienated—all humans flow without much purpose across a decaying landscape dotted with stray animals, lava lamps, useless hipster teens, false memory and nostalgia.\n\nIn this place, where rationality has destroyed love, dementia is the last territory of pleasure."
