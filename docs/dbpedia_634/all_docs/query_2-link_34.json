        "text": "Her son Charlie (Ronald Fraser) is an unsuccessful criminal who visits her only when he wants something, which in the film is to stash some money he has stolen. His mother finds it and thinks it is intended for her: but a particularly vile woman spots she has it, lures her back to her new council estate, fills her with drink and robs her. She is then dumped, insensible, in an alley, nearly dies of pneumonia, then is restored to health by sympathetic doctors and nurses. Her husband is forced by a National Assistance agent to return to her, which he does reluctantly, before swindling a bookmaker, and fleeing before the bookie’s heavies can catch up with him. His wife, alone once more, sits talking to her empty room, while the wrecking balls move in.\n\nNot all the old industrial landscape was swept away in Oldham: some of its Victorian heritage remains, while, perhaps predictably, the 1950s council estate where Mrs Ross’s abductor lives has been demolished. For all its grimness, The Whisperers is a stunning film, a memorial to a moment of decline, but also to its immensely gifted writer and director."
