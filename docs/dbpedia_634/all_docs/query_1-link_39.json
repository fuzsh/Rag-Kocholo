As director, Forbes represents \"a more romantic, wistful type of realism\" than that of Tony Richardson or Lindsay Anderson.[7]\n\nCaron's performance earned her the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for best actress, as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.[8][9][10]\n\nCicely Courtneidge gave what she considered her finest film performance, in a role wholly unlike her usual parts; she played an elderly lesbian, living in a drab London flat with her cat, recalling her career as an actress and forlornly trying to keep in touch with former friends.[11] The Times described her performance as a triumph.[12] For Bell, the film marked his breakthrough as a leading actor in film and television.[13]\n\nSynopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nA 27-year-old French woman, Jane Fosset (Caron), arrives alone at a run down boarding house in Notting Hill, London, moving into an L-shaped room in the attic. Beautiful but withdrawn, she encounters the residents of her house, each a social outsider in his or her own way, including a gay, black trumpeter.[2]\n\nJane is pregnant and has no desire to marry the father. On her first visit to a doctor, she wants to find out if she really is pregnant and consider her options. The doctor's assumption that she must want either marriage or an abortion annoys her to the extent that Jane determines to have the child. She and Toby (Bell) start a romance which is disrupted when he learns that she is pregnant by a previous lover. They try to work things out but he is also unhappy with his lack of income or success as a writer.\n\nJane befriends the other residents and they help her when she goes into labour. Toby visits her in hospital and gives her a copy of his new story, called The L-Shaped Room. After leaving hospital, Jane journeys home to her parents in France, saying goodbye to the room where she has lived for seven months.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLeslie Caron as Jane Fosset\n\nTom Bell as Toby\n\nBrock Peters as Johnny\n\nCicely Courtneidge as Mavis\n\nBernard Lee as Charlie\n\nPatricia Phoenix as Sonia\n\nEmlyn Williams as Dr Weaver\n\nAvis Bunnage as Doris\n\nGerry Duggan as Bert\n\nMark Eden as Terry\n\nAnthony Booth as youth in street\n\nHarry Locke as newsagent\n\nGerald Sim as doctor in hospital\n\nNanette Newman as girl at end\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nPeter Katin's recording of Johannes Brahms's Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor, Op. 15 with orchestra conducted by Muir Mathieson is used as the background music, and excerpts occur frequently throughout the film.[4] The original film score for the jazz club scene was composed by John Barry.[14]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nIn The New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote \"[Leslie Caron] pours into this role so much powerful feeling, so much heart and understanding, that she imbues a basically threadbare little story with tremendous compassion and charm. The credit, however, is not all Miss Caron's. She must share it with an excellent cast, including Tom Bell, a new actor who plays the writer on a par with her. Particularly she must share it with the remarkable young director Bryan Forbes, who also wrote the screenplay from a novel by Lynne Reid Banks. Mr Forbes is a sometime actor whose first directorial job was last year's beautiful and sensitive Whistle Down the Wind. In this little picture, he has achieved much the same human quality, with shadings of spiritual devotion, as in that.\"[6]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nNominee, Best Actress – Academy Awards (Leslie Caron)\n\nWinner, Best Actress – Golden Globes (Leslie Caron)\n\nWinner, Best Actress – BAFTA (Leslie Caron)\n\nNominee, Best Picture – BAFTA (Richard Attenborough, Jack Rix, John and James Woolf)\n\nSelected, Top Ten Films of Year – National Board of Review\n\nNominee, Best Actress – New York Film Critics Circle (Leslie Caron)\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was restored and issued on DVD and blu-ray in 2017; extras include later interviews with Caron and Reid Banks.\n\nPopular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nA recording of the song \"Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty\" sung in the film was sampled at the beginning of the title track of the album The Queen Is Dead by The Smiths.[15]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
