After a brief chat I was offered a test drive, I thought this would be at a later date but in fact was organised within 10mins (just paperwork for insurance).

I would like to thank Ben Wyatt (salesperson) as he answered & double checked things for me... now I just need to take my wife to have a quick once over and I will very very likely be going for the Enyaq via Ben & Sinclair Skoda Swansea.

Everyone was so friendly and approachable. Ryan Davies helped us buy the new car and was friendly, knowledgeable and patient. He did not force us into making any decision but advised and answered our many questions readily and happily at all times. We are very happy with the car and know that we can call into the dealer not only for service and maintenance but if we have any queries in the future. Thank you all\"\n\nMartyn Jarvis\n\n2 days ago"
