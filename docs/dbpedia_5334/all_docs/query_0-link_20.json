        "text": "Lotus Cars is a British manufacturer of sports and racing cars based at the former site of RAF Hethel, a World War II airfield in Norfolk. The company designs and builds race and production automobiles of light weight and fine handling characteristics.\n\nLotus is owned by Proton who took over after the bankruptcy of former owner Romano Artioli in 1994.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe company was formed as Lotus Engineering Ltd. by engineer Colin Chapman, a graduate of University College, London, in 1952. The first factory was in old stables behind the Railway Hotel in Hornsey, North London. Team Lotus, which was split off from Lotus Engineering in 1954, was active and competitive in Formula One racing from 1958 to 1994. The Lotus Group of Companies was formed in 1959. This was made up of Lotus Cars Limited and Lotus Components Limited which focused on road cars and customer competition car production respectively. Lotus Components Limited became Lotus Racing Limited in 1971 but the newly renamed entity ceased operation in the same year.[1]\n\nThe company moved to a purpose built factory at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire in 1959[2] and since 1966 the company has occupied a modern factory and road test facility at Hethel, near Wymondham, in Norfolk. This site is the former \"RAF Hethel\" base and the test track uses sections of the old runway.\n\nChapman died of a heart attack in 1982 at the age of 54, having begun life an innkeeper's son and ended a multi-millionaire industrialist in post-war Britain. The car maker built tens of thousands of successful racing and road cars and won the Formula One World Championship seven times. At the time of his death he was linked with the DeLorean scandal over the use of government subsidies for the production of the DeLorean DMC-12 for which Lotus had designed the chassis.\n\nIn 1986, the company was bought by General Motors. On 27 August 1993, GM sold the company, for £30 million, to A.C.B.N. Holdings S.A. of Luxembourg, a company controlled by Italian businessman Romano Artioli, who also owned Bugatti Automobili SpA. In 1996, a majority share in Lotus was sold to Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton), a Malaysian car company listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.\n\nThe company also acts as an engineering consultancy, providing engineering development—particularly of suspension—for other car manufacturers. The lesser known Powertrain department is responsible for the design and development of the 4-cylinder Ecotec engine found in many of GM's Vauxhall, Opel, Saab, Chevrolet and Saturn cars. Today, the current Lotus Elise and Exige models use the 1.8L VVTL-i I4 from Toyota's late Celica GT-S and the Matrix XRS.\n\nThe company is organised as Group Lotus, which is divided into Lotus Cars and Lotus Engineering.\n\nMichael Kimberley took over as Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company and its Group from May 2006. He currently chairs the Executive Committee of Lotus Group International Limited (\"LGIL\") established in February 2006, with Syed Zainal Abidin (Managing Director of Proton Holdings Berhad) and Badrul Feisal (non-executive director of Proton Holdings Berhad). LGIL is the holding company of Lotus Group Plc.\n\nKimberley retired as CEO on 17 July 2009[3] and was replaced as CEO by Dany T Bahar on 1 October 2009. Bahar was formerly Senior Vice President, Commercial & Brand for Ferrari SpA where he was responsible for worldwide road car sales and after sales business, overall road car and F1 marketing activities, licensing, and merchandising business.\n\nThe four letters in the middle of the logo stand for the initials of Anthony Colin Bruce Chapman.\n\nFormula One[]\n\nMain article: Team Lotus\n\nThe company encouraged its customers to race its cars, and entered Formula One through its sister company Team Lotus in 1958. A Lotus Formula One car driven by Stirling Moss won the marque's first Grand Prix in 1960 at Monaco in a Lotus 18 entered by privateer Rob Walker. Major success came in 1963 with the Lotus 25, which — with Jim Clark driving — won Lotus its first F1 World Constructors Championship. Clark's untimely death — he crashed a Formula Two Lotus 48 in April 1968 after his rear tyre failed in a turn in Hockenheim — was a severe blow to the team and to Formula One. He was the dominant driver in the dominant car and remains an inseparable part of Lotus' early years. That year's championship was won by Clark's teammate, Graham Hill.\n\nLotus is credited with making the mid-engined layout popular for IndyCars, developing the first monocoque Formula One chassis, and the integration of the engine and transaxle as chassis components. Lotus was also among the pioneers in Formula One in adding wings and shaping the undersurface of the car to create downforce, as well as the first to move radiators to the sides in the car to aid in aerodynamic performance, and inventing active suspension.\n\nEven after Chapman's death, until the late 1980s, Lotus continued to be a major player in Formula One. Ayrton Senna drove for the team from 1985 to 1987, winning twice in each year and achieving 17 pole positions. However, by the company's last Formula One race in 1994, the cars were no longer competitive. Lotus won a total of 79 Grand Prix races. During his lifetime Chapman saw Lotus beat Ferrari as the first team to achieve 50 Grand Prix victories, despite Ferrari having won their first nine years sooner.\n\nFormula One Constructors' Championships (Drivers' Championship winner for Lotus)\n\n1963 (Jim Clark)\n\n1965 (Jim Clark)\n\n1968 (Graham Hill)\n\n1970 (Jochen Rindt)\n\n1972 (Emerson Fittipaldi)\n\n1973[4]\n\n1978 (Mario Andretti)\n\nTeam Lotus established Classic Team Lotus in 1992, as the Works historic motorsport activity. Classic Team Lotus continues to maintain Lotus F1 cars and run them in the FIA Historic Formula One Championship and it preserves the Team Lotus archive and Works Collection of cars, under the management of Colin Chapman’s son, Clive.\n\nTeam Lotus' participation in Formula One ended at the end of the 1994 season.\n\nThe Lotus name returned to Formula One for the 2010 season, when a new Malaysian team called Lotus Racing, using the Lotus name on licence from Group Lotus, was awarded an entry. The new team was unrelated to the previous incarnation of Team Lotus when it was first founded, although it was funded by a Malaysian Consortium including Proton (the owner of Lotus Cars). After a dispute between the two parties (Lotus Racing and Proton), Group Lotus, with agreement from their parent company Proton, terminated the licence for future seasons as a result of what it called \"flagrant and persistent breaches of the licence by the team\". Lotus Racing then announced that they had acquired Team Lotus Ventures Ltd, the company led by David Hunt since 1994, during which Team Lotus had stopped competing in Formula One, and with it full ownership of the rights of the Team Lotus brand and heritage. The team confirmed that they would be known as Team Lotus from 2011 onwards.\n\nIn December 2010 Group Lotus (Proton) announced the creation of 'Lotus Renault GP', the successor to the Renault F1 Team that will contest the 2011 FIA Formula One World Championship, having purchased a title sponsorship deal with the team with the option to buy shares in the future. The team's cars will continue to be called 'Renaults', up against the Team Lotus cars which will be known as 'Lotus'.\n\nLotus car models[]\n\nCurrent Lotus models comprise:\n\nLotus Elise: The Elise started in 1996 and weighed 725 kg. The current model starts at 901 kg and incorporates some engineering innovations, such as an aluminum extrusion frame and a composite body shell. The Elise has also spawned several racing variants, including a limited series called the 340R, which has an open-body design echoing the old Seven. The Elise was introduced into the U.S., with a Toyota engine, in order to pass strict U.S. emissions laws. The 1ZZ & 2ZZ Toyota engines used have a Lotus ECU with their own fuel mapping. The supercharged Lotus SC and limited edition Jim Clark Type 25 Elise editions add a new performance dimension to the Elise range. 0–60 mph acceleration is in 4.3 seconds and 0–100 km/h in 4.6 seconds.\n\nLotus Exige: A version of the Elise with a redesigned body to provide additional downforce (100 lb at 100 mph).[5] Additionally, the following Elise Sport Pack and Hardtop options are standard on the Exige. The car is street legal and the base 2006 model was available in the USA for $50,990.[6] Lotus updated the Exige with the supercharged Exige S in 2007.\n\nLotus Exige S: An Exige with a supercharged engine providing 220 hp.[7] The non-S Exige[8] and Elise[9] have 190 hp (140 kW).\n\nLotus Evora Launched 22 July 2008. Code named Project Eagle during development. A 2+2 sports car with a mid mounted, transverse 3.5 litre V6 engine.\n\nLotus 2-Eleven Weighing just 670 kg (1,500 lb) and with 252 bhp (188 kW) the Lotus 2-Eleven can sprint from 0–60 in 3.8 seconds and has a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h). Intended as a track day car it costs £39,995 but for an additional £1,100 Lotus will make the car fully road legal.\n\nLotus T125 Exos Track-only Formula 1 inspired car. 3.5l Cosworth V8, 640 bhp; 25 will be built at $1 million each. To run in the 'Exos Experience by Lotus', a club, initiated and operated by Lotus Motorsport, in which a limited number of owner drivers can refine their driving skills and challenge themselves with expert one-to-one advice from former Grand Prix drivers and trainers.\n\nPrevious[]\n\nLotus Mark I (1948): Austin 7 based car\n\nLotus Mark II (1949–1950): Ford-powered trials car\n\nLotus Mark III (1951): 750 cc formula car\n\nLotus Mark IV (1952): Trials car\n\nLotus Mark V (1952 2): 750 cc formula car—never built\n\nLotus Mark VI (1953–1955): The first \"production\" racer—about 100 built\n\nLotus Seven (1957–1970): Classic open sports car, a minimalist machine designed to manoeuvre a racing circuit and nothing else.

It was styled by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro. The Esprit started with a light, 4-cylinder design, which went through several iterations of turbo-charging and electronic upgrades, before finally being replaced by a highly advanced V8. The last Lotus Esprit rolled off the production line on 20 February 2004, after 28 years in production. A total of 10,675 Esprits were built since production began in 1976.\n\nLotus M250 (2000): Concept car that never reached production\n\nLotus Europa S: The Grand Tourer (GT)-inspired two-seater is claimed to offer a more upmarket sportscar experience, although it is based on the same chassis as the Elise and Exige, limiting accommodation and practicality. Power comes from a Lotus-tuned variant of the turbocharged four-cylinder engine which powers the VX220. The Europa has been criticised in the motoring press for being expensive and for lacking equipment and practicality compared to rivals like the Porsche Cayman.\n\nAnnouncements[]\n\nAt the 2010 Paris Motorshow, Lotus announced five new models to be introduced over the next five years:[11]\n\nNew Lotus Esprit. Due to be released in 2013, the Esprit will be powered by a 5.0 litre Lexus V8 pressure charged engine delivering up to 620 PS, capable of 0–100 km/h in approximately 3.4 seconds.\n\nNew Lotus Elan. Set for release during the second half of 2013, the Elan will feature a 4.0 litre V6 pressure charged engine capable of delivering up to 450 PS with a weight of 1,295 kg.\n\nNew Lotus Elite. A 2+2 GT with a front-mid positioned 5.0 litre V8 engine delivering up to 620 PS, capable of 0–100 km/h in approximately 3.7 seconds. Set for release in spring 2014,\n\nNew Lotus Elise. The replacement for the Lotus Elise is due in 2015 with a 2.0 litre inline 4 pressure charged engine delivering up to 320 PS, the Elise 2015 is stated to be capable of 0–100 km/h in under 4.5 seconds.\n\nNew Lotus Eterne. A four door, four seater sports GT. With a 5.0 litre pressure charged V8. Designed as a competitor to the Porsche Panamera and the Aston Martin Rapide.\n\nLotus engines[]\n\nLotus-Ford Twin Cam\n\nLotus 900 series\n\nLotus 907\n\nLotus 910\n\nLotus 911\n\nLotus 912\n\nLotus 918 V8\n\nRange Extender Engine. This all aluminium, monoblock, 1200cc, four-stroke, engine is specifically designed to turn only a directly driven from the crank-shaft alternator for electricity generation for series-hybrid cars. The engine is small and light at 56 kg, having three cylinders and no detachable cylinder head. The cylinder head and engine block are all one casting to reduce size, weight and production costs. As the engine does not turn belt driven ancillaries such as an: alternator, power steering pump or an air conditioning compressor, the block requires no strong points to accommodate ancillaries, giving a simple and light block. The engine has a reduced parts count for lightness and cheaper production.[12][13]\n\nLotus Engineering[]\n\nLotus Engineering Limited, is an offshoot of Lotus Cars, which provides engineering consultancy third party companies primarily in the automotive industry. As well as Hethel in the United Kingdom Lotus has engineering centres in Ann Arbor, USA, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Shanghai, China. In 2000, Lotus Engineering, Inc. was established with an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[14]\n\nEngineering demonstrators[]\n\nLotus Eco Elise is an engineering demonstrator of its classic sports car that incorporates solar panels into a roof made from hemp, while also employing natural materials in the body and interior of the car.\n\nLotus Exige 265E Bio-fuel\n\nLotus Exige 270E Tri-fuel\n\nLotus Evora 414E Hybrid. Shown at the 2010 Geneva Motor show\n\nLotus Concept City Car. Shown at the 2010 Paris motor show.\n\nAPX and VVA[]\n\nMain article: Lotus APX\n\nThe APX (also known as the \"Aluminium Performance Crossover\") is an aluminium concept vehicle revealed at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show built on Lotus Engineering's Versatile Vehicle Architecture (VVA).\n\nWhereas the VVA technology will be used in the creation of a new mid-engined sportscar for Lotus cars, the APX is in fact a high performance 7 seat MPV with four-wheel drive and a front mounted V6 engine from Lotus Engineering's Powertrain division. The engine was designed and developed to be available as a 2.2 litre N/A and 3.0 litre supercharged. A number of prototypes of both engines exist in full working order in a number of mule cars.\n\nVersatile Vehicle Architecture (VVA) is an effort by the Lotus car manufacturing company to reduce the investment needed for producing unique, niche-market cars by sharing a number of common components.\n\nCars produced using VVA:\n\nLotus APX\n\nProjects undertaken by Lotus Engineering[]\n\nExamples of work undertaken by Lotus Engineering include:\n\nLotus Talbot Sunbeam—Talbot's hot-hatch rally car of the early '80s.\n\nDeLorean DMC-12. Changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures. The car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer Colin Chapman, founder of Lotus. Lotus replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus in the Lotus Esprit.\n\nVauxhall Lotus Carlton (also Opel Lotus Omega, internal name Lotus Type 104) - At the time (early 1990s) this was the fastest saloon car available, with a top speed of over 175 mph (280 km/h).\n\nThe 1991 Dodge Spirit R/T with a version of the 2.2 L K-car engine with a 16-valve DOHC head designed by Lotus with over 220 hp (160 kW).\n\nVauxhall VX220 (also Opel Speedster) - Lotus produced and based upon the same aluminium chassis design as the Lotus Elise. Production of these models ended in 2005.\n\nLotus styled and assisted with the engineering of the Tesla Roadster, an electric sports car based on the Elise, as well as licensing some technologies to Tesla Motors and constructing the Roadster at their plant in Hethel.[15]\n\nThe Aston Martin DB9 chassis was developed with the help of Lotus Engineering.\n\nLotus was responsible for most of the design, development, and testing, of the LT5 DOHC V8 powerplant for the Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1.\n\nLotus designed, developed and tested the GM Ecotec engine and its variants.\n\nLotus was responsible for various aspects of the Sinclair C5 electric tricycle.\n\nLotus was responsible for the suspension calibration of the Toyota MR2 Mk. I, the Toyota Supra Mk. II and Mk. III, the Isuzu Piazza, the Isuzu Impulse as well as newer Proton models.\n\nLotus was responsible for the development of the Campro engine together with Proton,[16] as well as its variable valve timing system, the Cam Profile Switching (CPS). Currently available in the 1.6-litre and 1.3-litre variants, the Campro engine now powers most of Proton's newer models.\n\nLotus has worked on the suspension of the Mahindra Scorpio to make it more stable at high speeds.\n\nLotus produced the revised Chassis of the Isuzu Piazza\n\nThe Dodge EV concept electric vehicle from Chrysler is based on a Lotus Europa S.\n\nLotus has worked on the suspension and handling of the Nissan GT-R\n\nThe Hennessey Venom GT a soon to be released hypercar is to be based on the Lotus Exige.\n\n2009: Range Extender engine. This all aluminium, monoblock, 1200cc, four-stroke engine is specifically designed to turn an alternator for series-hybrid cars. The engine is small and light having three cylinders and no detachable cylinder head.[17]\n\n2010: Limo-Green project with Jaguar Cars. Lotus provided the Range Extender engine for a prototype XJ series-hybrid car. The car returned 58 mpg (imperial) running off the range extender alone.[18]\n\nElectric vehicles[]\n\nLotus Engineering has established a group dedicated to hybrid and electric vehicles.[19]\n\nLotus plans to enter the electric vehicle race, CEO Michael Kimberley told the Financial Times . \"Don’t be surprised to see an electric Lotus shortly,” he said, adding that a concept version could debut as early as March 2009, at Geneva Motor Show.[20][21] Lotus is now front and center in the electric-car arena.[22]\n\nLotus did not reveal details about the car or the engine but discloses that it will go for 300 to 400 miles (640 km) and it will really live up to the expectations of being one of the best electric cars in the world.[21]\n\nLotus joined Jaguar Cars, MIRA Ltd and Caparo on a luxury hybrid executive sedan project called \"Limo-Green\"--funded by the UK Government Technology Strategy Board. The vehicle will be a series plug-in hybrid.[22][23]\n\nTesla Motors, a likely rival for Lotus if its plans go through, has also turned to contractors for parts of the all-electric Roadster.[20] Of note however, is the fact that Tesla currently obtains the chassis for their Roadster from Lotus as do Dodge for their EV because of the heavy weight of the batteries in an EV and Lotus's widely known low weight and sharp handling characteristics. While only 10% of the parts of the Tesla Roadster are shared with the Lotus Elise, Lotus is responsible for approximately 40% of the overall content of the car.[20]\n\nQueen's Award for Enterprise[]\n\nLotus Cars were awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise for contribution to International Trade, one of 85 companies receiving the recognition in that category in 2002. Lotus cars wore the badge of the award for a number of years.[24]\n\nSee also[]\n\nColin Chapman\n\nRAF Hethel\n\nProton Holdings Berhad\n\nReferences / sources[]\n\nNotes[]\n\nThe Rinspeed sQuba amphibious roadster is based on an Elise.\n\nFurther reading[]\n\nGérard ('Jabby') Crombac, Colin Chapman: The Man and His Cars (Patrick Stephens, Wellingborough, 1986)\n\nMike Lawrence, Colin Chapman: The Wayward Genius (Breedon Books, Derby, 2002)\n\nIan H.
