        "text": "Category: EIM Spotlight\n\nEIM Spotlight: Cindy Friedemann (Moore Norman Tech)\n\nMeet Cindy Friedemann, director of strategic partnerships at Moore Norman Technology Center in Oklahoma. Friedemann’s spotlight interview appears as part of a spotlight series on ACTE’s educational institution members (EIMs).\n\nEstablished in 1972, MNTC is viewed as one of the nation’s premier educational and training institutions. MNTC is one of 29 technology centers within Oklahoma’s globally recognized CareerTech System. With two campuses in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, metropolitan area, MNTC places an emphasis on experiential learning and hands-on training. Adult and high school students gain meaningful career and technical skills that, in most cases, lead to state and national certifications and employment.\n\nStudents at Moore Norman may enroll in more than 30 career programs and more than 600 short-term courses. Recent areas of focus include state-of-the art public service and aviation programs. These programs are attracting industry and community interest and support.\n\nCindy Friedemann, Moore Norman Tech, EIM\n\nWhat is your job title and what do you do?\n\nAs director of strategic partnerships at MNTC, I engage in state and national relationships to support and provide meaningful connections for our educators. Relationships with industry are crucial to successful and relevant career programs. I serve on state, local and national boards to bring additional awareness to CTE.\n\nFurther, I am currently the president of the National Council of Local Administrators (NCLA), which is a great resource for current and aspiring CTE leaders nationwide.\n\nI have been a proud member of ACTE for 30 years, and NCLA is a great partner with ACTE, working together to produce a highly rated annual conference in September. This year, ACTE’s and NCLA’s Best Practices and Innovations in CTE Conference meets in Cape Cod! And it should be one of the best conferences yet!\n\nWhat was your education experience like? What did you study?\n\nMy brother and I both were career and technical education (CTE) students all through our high school years at Eau Gallie High School in Melbourne, Florida. Go Commodores! Our family valued the ability to work with our hands. In fact, our parents repeatedly reminded us, “That’s fine if you want to attend college. But you are going to have a skill to support yourself first.”\n\nMy brother studied construction trades, served in the military, and went on to become a general contractor in Florida building for Walt Disney World, SeaWorld, the Ritz Carlton; taking on specialized large construction projects in Orlando, Florida. CTE provided a great foundation for his success.\n\nOn the other hand, my dream was to design women’s clothing. So, I studied family and consumer sciences. And my teacher, Mrs. Butler, was a stickler for teaching us to use all the machines. In addition to commercial and at-home garment construction machines, I learned to use and repair industrial sewing machines. This training prepared me to later help my college professors fix our classroom equipment! Then, later, when I held my dream job as a head designer in Atlanta, my CTE training helped me teach and coach the staff who manufactured my designs.\n\nBut that career ended when our family moved to Oklahoma. I achieved my master’s and was hired as a program planner for the state Department of Career and Technical Education in Oklahoma and have never looked back. It has been wonderful to translate seasonal fashion forecasting to forecasting industry needs. The skills I learned in my FCS education now help me support the development of new CTE programs.\n\nWhat barriers did you (or you family) face in pursuit of higher learning?\n\nI wanted to attend college and knew it would help me achieve my career goals and provide education to support me throughout my life. However, I knew I would have to pay for college on my own. I found a way to take 21 to 24 credit hours in a semester, and I worked in the library where there were opportunities to study and work. I set a goal to graduate in three years. It was a lot of work, but it was worth it. Nowadays, I would probably attend a community college first. That is another great way to achieve your goals and avoid student loan debt.\n\nWhat led you to your current role at Moore Norman Technology Center?\n\nA positive and longstanding relationship with the superintendent, Brian Ruttman, led to my current role. Ruttman and I worked closely together to create Centers of Excellence as colleagues and executives at our former employer, Metro Tech. I am delighted to have an opportunity to work with him again. He is a visionary leader who cultivates a positive culture and encourages industry engagement throughout our entire organization.\n\nHow do you like working in CTE?\n\nI love the positive impact we make as CTE leaders, providing opportunities for individuals to pursue their passions and to thrive along with their families. I love seeing how our students can enjoy their lives with financial security.\n\nWhen we in CTE work with intention, opening the doors to career options, our adult and high school students can find pathways they truly enjoy. Maybe we can all strive to reach that blissful state: to “never work another day in our lives,” because our jobs are fulfilling and financially rewarding.\n\nDo you have any advice that you would offer to students who intend to pursue postsecondary education in CTE?\n\nIt is sometimes hard to know your gifts, and to know how to apply those gifts to a career. Everyone (students of all ages) should invest in themselves by taking the available, and often free, career assessments through local school and college counseling services. Don’t ignore the opportunity to take the ASVAB as well. The answers you find from these assessments can help you find career success. My other advice is to prepare yourself for challenging days. Do not give up when you face obstacles but become tenacious and resourceful, and you can succeed.\n\nIs there anything else you’d like to share?\n\nI have learned from many of the superintendents and state directors that I’ve worked for. My husband, Tom Friedemann, Ph.D., former superintendent of Francis Tuttle, has been an especially wonderful sounding board and personal resource. I have learned a lot from his leadership.\n\nLearn more about educational institution membership with ACTE.\n\nEIM Spotlight: Eryn Ruder (Great Oaks Career Campuses)\n\nMeet Eryn Ruder, instructor of environmental science and anatomy and physiology at the Scarlet Oaks Campus of Great Oaks Career Campuses in Cincinnati, Ohio. Ruder’s spotlight interview is the first in a new feature on ACTE’s educational institution members (EIMs).\n\nGreat Oaks is a public career and technical education (CTE) school district serving 36 school districts in southwest Ohio. Each year, thousands of area students prepare for college and career at a Great Oaks Career Campus.\n\nProfessional certification is available in a wide range of career fields. These include health care, high-tech manufacturing, biotechnology, construction trades, culinary arts, agriculture, cosmetology and more. Great Oaks offers more than 30 different programs on four campuses as well as satellite programs in 28 of the district’s 36 affiliated school districts. Each year, more than 22,000 area students take Great Oaks classes. Career training and personal enrichment programs are also available for adults.\n\nGreat Oaks has a tradition of providing career programs to meet community needs. Partnerships with local business, education and community agencies help shape the programs offered.\n\nEryn Ruder, Great Oaks Career Campuses, EIM\n\nTell me a little about your upbringing. What led you to your field?\n\nI grew up with my younger sister and brother in Butler County, Ohio, in an area called Overpeck. We had a five-way intersection and a post office. Overpeck is known for large aggregate deposits/gravel pits. It was also the birthplace of seismologist Charles Richter. My parents just celebrated 50 years of marriage; they live in the same house where I grew up.\n\nMy love of science comes from family time spent outdoors. I love camping, picnicking, hiking, fishing, “creek tromping,” and hunting for fossils, salamanders, turtles and snakes.\n\nI come from a long line of educators. My great aunt began her career as a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in Rockcastle County, Kentucky. She retired as an elementary teacher from Ohio’s Hamilton City schools. My mother as a job coach, teaching and training clients with developmental disabilities throughout Butler County. While working toward a zoology degree, I volunteered to tutor elementary and middle school science students. This is when I fell in love with teaching.\n\nYou mentioned you have a degree in zoology. Where did you attend school?\n\nI graduated from New Miami Local Schools. I earned my bachelor’s degree in zoology from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and a master of education from Mount Saint Joseph University.\n\nWhat barriers did you face in pursuit of postsecondary education? How did you overcome those obstacles?\n\nNeither of my parents have college degrees but they always made it clear that my siblings and I could go to college and earn degrees. We all three completed advanced degrees. My brother and I both teach with master’s degrees in education and my sister earned a doctor of nursing practice and teaches at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.\n\nI became a nontraditional college student when I got married at 20. I took time off my senior year when I gave birth to my daughter. She was 18 months old when I received my bachelor’s degree in 1996.\n\nHow did you come to the position you’re in now at Great Oaks?\n\nI took an alternative pathway to the classroom. I was never an education major. In the final year of coursework for my zoology degree, I realized that I wanted to pursue education as a career. I obtained an Ohio substitute teaching license and worked as a substitute teacher throughout Butler County, then as a building sub at New Miami. I went in every day. If all the staff members were present, I would tutor in math and science classrooms.\n\nI started working on my graduate degree at Mount Saint Joseph in 2006. I completed the testing required to teach life sciences and upgraded my licensure. Northwest Local School District hired me to teach biology at Northwest High School and I entered my own classroom in 2007, where I taught until June 2015. I began teaching science at Scarlet Oaks in August 2015.\n\nHow do you like working on campus?\n\nI absolutely love teaching at Scarlet Oaks. I appreciate the diverse student population and the amazing experiences our campus has to offer. Great Oaks Career Campuses leverage technology to support students — great during a normal school year and even more so while remote learning. The district offered encouragement as I transitioned to deliver course content using the Grid Method of instruction for mastery learning. A team of Grid Method teachers, across all campuses, promotes collaboration. The transition to remote learning was smooth for those of us using it. Great Oaks finished the year by hosting a virtual workshop with Chad Ostrowski, creator of the Grid Method, to provide further support and to train more instructors.\n\nIs there anything else about your life that you’d like to share?\n\nWe lost our youngest son, Alec, to suicide on Oct. 1, 2018, and it changed my life in so many unpredictable ways. Someone recommended a book by Iris Bolton (1983), My Son… My Son: A Guide to Healing After a Suicide in the Family. In it was this quote,\n\n“There is a gift for you in your son’s death. You may not believe it at this bitter moment, but it is authentic, and it can be yours if you are willing to search for it. To other eyes, it may remain hidden. The gift is real and precious, and you can find it if you choose.”\n\nI have always been very open and accepting of my students in regard to mental health but even more so in the wake of losing Alec. I completely changed the way I teach.\n\nDuring this rapid change to remote learning, I was able to help other teachers use the tools that made the transition easy for my students and me. Tools I never would have had without Alec.\n\nMy daughter, Mackenzie, is a Columbus College of Art and Design graduate and works as an educator at the Innovation Pointe Makerspace, within the MidPointe Library System. She is also an illustrator and graphic novelist.\n\nMy surviving son, Conner, is a Great Oaks graduate. He completed the computer science technician and networking program at Live Oaks and has recently been hired by the West Clermont School District (a Great Oaks feeder school) as a computer technician. We are very excited to add another family member working in education!​\n\nDo you have any advice about the higher learning experience that you would offer to students who intend to pursue postsecondary education in CTE?\n\nMy educational journey did not lead to the career I thought it would when I started. But while the path was winding and sometimes very difficult, it was worth it.\n\nIt is never too late to shift gears to pursue a career that you find fulfilling.\n\neducational institution membership with ACTE.\n\nEIM Spotlight: Khaaliq Salim (Francis Tuttle Technology Center)\n\nMeet Khaaliq Salim, director of the Danforth Campus at Francis Tuttle Technology Center. Salim’s interview appears as part of a spotlight series on ACTE’s educational institution members (EIMs).\n\nFrancis Tuttle Technology Center provides professional and career advancement training opportunities at various levels. High school students who attend our partner schools and home school students who live within the district — and who meet the requirements — attend classes at no cost other than those that come with specific courses.\n\nThe school is named in honor of Dr. Francis Tuttle, a former public school superintendent whose visionary leadership led to the formation of the entire CareerTech system. Now, as one of Oklahoma’s 29 technology center districts providing CareerTech training for high school students and adult learners, as well as services for business and industry customers, Francis Tuttle remains a vital component of the economic development arm of Oklahoma’s education system.\n\nKhaaliq Salim, Francis Tuttle Technology Center, EIM\n\nTell me a little about your job on campus. What’s your job title and what do you do?\n\nI am the director of our Danforth Campus, opening in August 2021 with an entrepreneurial theme. Career-training programs on the campus will include cosmetology, automotive service, interactive media and pre-nursing. In addition, the campus will house four college prep academies for high school students: computer science, engineering, bio-sciences >amp; medicine, and entrepreneurship.\n\nFrancis Tuttle’s business incubator, Launch Pad FT — as well as a pre-accelerator — will also be on campus, working work with early stage businesses owners to ensure they have the necessary resources, guidance and mentorship to thrive in the new economy.\n\nCan you tell me a little about your upbringing?\n\nI grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with my parents and four siblings. My mom is retired from education; she worked as an elementary school teacher and a counselor. My dad retired from the county health department. Although my parents did not have much money, we were fortunate to go to private school and magnet schools through high school. My parents instilled in us the value of getting a good education, as they both have college degrees. Currently, four of the five Salim children work in the field of education.\n\nWhat was your education experience like? What did you study?\n\nI went to Langston University (Langston, Oklahoma) for my undergraduate studies. I majored in mathematics and industrial technology, and I thought I wanted to be an engineer. Then I received my master’s degree in teaching, learning >amp; leadership from Oklahoma State University. Later, I went back to get my secondary principal and superintendent certifications.\n\nAfter getting the opportunity to teach my senior year in college, I was bitten by the teaching bug immediately. I found my passion when I was able to witness students’ “a-ha!” moment.\n\nWhat led you to your field?\n\nI taught math and electronics at Langston University for eight years. After leaving Langston, I took 18 months off from teaching and ventured into the corporate world. To put it bluntly, I hated it. Cubicle work life was not for me. I made a decision and took an alternative certification route in order to teach at the secondary level. That is when the opportunity at Francis Tuttle Technology Center became available.\n\nHow do you like working at Francis Tuttle Technology Center?\n\nThis is my thirteenth year at Francis Tuttle. I have served in a variety of roles on several of our campuses including infusion instructor, career transitions instructor and assistant instructional director. In 2019, I was promoted to instructional director. I love working with instructors and students every day.\n\nFrancis Tuttle’s mission is “preparing our customers for success in the workplace.” It is extremely rewarding to see the satisfaction a student has when they pass a certification test or get a job offer. Knowing we played a small part in their success lets us know we are doing the right thing. Our leadership team, instructors and staff are the very best at helping students succeed.\n\nDo you have any advice that you would offer to students who intend to pursue postsecondary education in CTE?\n\nI have learned that not everyone should follow a traditional four-year college pathway. A technical education provides specific, hands-on training our graduates need to earn rewarding, well-paying careers. Career and technical education has been a well-kept secret for too long. It is time for us to get the word out regarding the many advantages it provides.\n\nLearn more about educational institution membership with ACTE.\n\nEIM Spotlight: David Campbell (Butler Tech)\n\nMeet David Campbell, a mechatronics instructor at Butler Tech. Campbell’s interview appears as part of a spotlight series on ACTE’s educational institution members (EIM).\n\nHigh school students, juniors and seniors, in Butler Tech’s two-year programs receive career training in one of dozens of programs, alongside completion of their academic courses for graduation. Additionally, more than 50 industry credentials and free college credit are made available for students to earn during their Butler Tech high school experience. From health care and the arts to construction, manufacturing and transportation, Butler Tech provides a purpose for every passion.\n\nStudents in the mechatronics program can earn up to 60 semester hours of college credit through Ohio’s dual enrollment program, College Credit Plus. Students who successfully complete all of the coursework earn an associate degree in electro-mechanical engineering technology from Sinclair College.\n\nDavid Campbell, Butler Tech, EIM\n\nWhat do you do at a mechatronics instructor at Butler Tech?\n\nI guide students through both secondary and postsecondary skill attainment. I like to think of myself as an extreme geek. My students learn skills in design; additive and subtractive manufacturing; building electro-mechanical devices; programming; and automation. We are fortunate to work in a 5,000 square-foot lab we refer to as the G.Y.M. (Grow Your Mind), a moniker we borrowed from a local industry partner.\n\nCan you tell me a little about your upbringing?\n\nI was always tinkering with electronics and mechanical gadgets — like VCRs or lawn mowers. More often than not, I was able to fix or modify the item. Of course, there were some awful failures as well.\n\nBoth of my parents were teachers. They always encouraged me to work as much as I wanted, and to learn as much as I could.\n\nWhat was your education experience like? What did you study?\n\nI attended a military-based, private high school in Indiana. After graduating from high school, I enlisted as a radar technician in the Ohio Air National Guard, where I served for 10 years. Working on a long-range radar really drove my curiosity into electro-mechanical systems.\n\nI earned a bachelor of science in electro-mechanical engineering technology from Miami University. I haven’t pursued any additional degrees — only continuing education courses in Educational Leadership.\n\nMy education was vastly different than the public career and technical education system in which I teach, but there are a few aspects that remain perfectly aligned: a passion for learning and curiosity-driven education. I was a curious student who became somewhat complacent in school when I wasn’t challenged. But I had a few fabulous teachers who were very motivational — charismatic people to influence my work. My mother was also a great advocate and supporter for me during my education.\n\nWhat barriers did you face in pursuit of higher learning?\n\nI joined the military specifically for a tuition reimbursement program as my parents couldn’t afford to send me to university without borrowing student loans.\n\nWhat led you to your field?\n\nI found out about a CTE teaching position from a military advisor. He served on the program’s advisory committee and suggested I look into the opportunity. Both of my parents were teachers and the idea of becoming a teacher was very interesting to me. I earned my credentials in a 36-hour vocational education teacher educator program at Wright State University. Learning electronics and mechanics through the Air Force were instrumental in my progression.\n\nHow do you like working at Butler Tech?\n\nI spent 22 of my 24 years in education at a satellite program or a comprehensive high school. These past two years at the Butler Tech Fairfield Township campus have been amazing. Every student is here by choice; they applied and interviewed and were admitted into their respective program. The students and staff have tremendous passion and focus on their career field.\n\nIs there anything else about your life that you’d like to share?\n\nI like to take risks, but I fail often — one of the best ways to learn!\n\nDo you have any advice that you would offer to students who intend to pursue postsecondary education in CTE?\n\nFind a program in which you are interested and dig as deeply into the content as you can. The connections and professional networks CTE programs offer will give each student a great start to an amazing career.\n\nLearn more about educational institution membership with ACTE.\n\nEIM Spotlight: Danna Goss (High Plains Technology Center)\n\nMeet Danna Goss, Technical Applications Program instructor at High Plains Technology Center in Woodward, Oklahoma. Goss’s interview appears as part of a spotlight series on ACTE’s educational institution members (EIM).\n\nHigh Plains Technology Center High Plains Technology Center operates as part of a network of 29 career technology centers across the state of Oklahoma. High Plains trains individuals for success in the workplace. A wide variety of course offerings make career education possible for students from all walks of life: career training, professional and personal interest, online classes and business solutions.\n\nDanna Goss, High Plains Technology Center, EIM\n\nWhat is your job title and what do you do?\n\nI am the Technical Applications Program’s (TAP) freshman instructor and also lead teacher of TAP. TAP focuses on creating a learning environment that promotes higher-level thinking about real world situations and increases student collaboration. Our goal is to use the technology in TAP to allow career exploration in trades and industry, emphasizing science, math and engineering components. TAP, offered in grades six through nine, introduces and exposes students to all career opportunities offered at High Plains Technology Center. By identifying students’ needs at an early age, setting goals, providing individualized career plans, and teaching skills, student success will increase.\n\nCan you tell me a little about your upbringing?\n\nI grew up on a family farm near Empire, Oklahoma, and then moved to El Paso, Illinois — and I was always involved in agriculture. Our family raised show pigs. We were actively involved in 4-H and the National FFA Organization, showing pigs and judging livestock. My parents always focused on teaching me to do my best; they encouraged me to be a hard worker and dedicated to a given job and/or assignment.\n\nWhat was your education experience like?\n\nI was fortunate to have some amazing teachers that allowed my free spirit to roam, and to think outside the box. I was able to be creative in my approach, within reason, in order to meet their end goals. I also had some very rigid teachers who taught in a very structured and organized manner. I respected the rules and their authority but would tend to get distracted and cause mischief.\n\nI attended Northeastern Oklahoma A>amp;M College and Oklahoma State University, where I was as a member of the livestock judging teams. I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in animal science and agricultural business. While working with young students at livestock judging camps, I became interested in teaching. I obtained a master’s degree in education from Southwestern Oklahoma State University and later pursued a second master’s in educational leadership.\n\nSchool was a place for me to learn but also to make connections with others. I enjoyed school. Involvement in extracurricular activities (4-H, FFA, and athletics) allowed me to find the “why” in learning. I found that nontraditional education — applying skills in a hands-on learning environment — taught me the most. I believe that is why teaching TAP for High Plains Technology Center is great fit for me.\n\nWhat led you to your current role in CTE?\n\nThis is my 26th year to teach. I began my teaching career in 1995 in Elk City, Oklahoma. I taught fifth, sixth and eighth grade science, I then taught seventh and eighth grade in Canute, Oklahoma. In 2010, I began teaching in the Biomedical Science Academy at Western Technology Center in Burns Flat, Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2016, I went to work for High Plains Technology Center to start a new program for middle school students. Together with my teaching partner Lisa Steadman, we created and built the Technical Applications Program for students in grades six through nine.\n\nHow do you like working at High Plains Technology Center?\n\nHigh Plains Technology Center is an amazing place to work with a family atmosphere. The administrative team is creative, unique and grounded in their approach to student learning.\n\nIs there anything else about your life that you’d like to share?\n\nI enjoy living on the farm and being actively involved in the agriculture industry. We raise show pigs, show cattle and Australian Shepherd dogs. My husband and I have five children and seven grandchildren to enjoy. I believe that my background and experiences bring life and application to my classroom each day.\n\nDo you have any advice that you would offer to students who intend to pursue postsecondary education in CTE?\n\nChase your dreams! Set high standards and expectations for yourself. When you find your “why” in learning, your purpose will become clear and vivid. The opportunities in career and technical education are tremendous; the skill development and training one can obtain will lay a strong foundation for college and career success.\n\nLearn more about educational institution membership with ACTE.\n\nEIM Spotlight: Jack Day (High Plains Technology Center)\n\nMeet Jack Day, wind technology instructor at High Plains Technology Center in Woodward, Oklahoma. Day’s interview appears as part of a spotlight series on ACTE’s educational institution members (EIM).\n\nHigh Plains Technology Center High Plains Technology Center operates as part of a network of 29 career technology centers across the state of Oklahoma. High Plains trains individuals for success in the workplace. A wide variety of course offerings make career education possible for students from all walks of life: career training, professional and personal interest, online classes and business solutions.\n\nJack Day, High Plains Technology Center, EIM\n\nTell me a little about your job on campus. What’s your job title and what do you do?\n\nI work as wind technology instructor. I instruct adult students of varying ages and backgrounds in the exciting and expanding field of renewable energy. Specifically, my experience involves wind turbine generator maintenance, repair, troubleshooting and operation.\n\nCan you tell me a little about your upbringing?\n\nMy upbringing was a bit nontraditional in the fact I was adopted and raised by my paternal grandparents. I was born in Pawnee, Oklahoma, and we frequently moved between there >amp; Cleveland, Oklahoma. Once, we moved to Berryhill, Oklahoma. My grandfather owned and operated a semi-truck. My grandmother mainly worked kitchen or janitorial positions.\n\nFrom an early age, I spent weekends doing farm chores and helping with truck maintenance. During the summer months, on weekdays, I rode along with my grandfather to load >amp; offload materials.\n\nWhat was your education experience like?\n\nMoney was tight. I knew the probability of my grandparents paying for college was slim to none. Honestly, I wasn’t interested in that route anyway. During my eighth grade year, we moved to a small town north of Wichita, Kansas, named Valley Center. It was there, in high school, I pursued career and technical education (CTE) programs offered on campus.\n\nI excelled in every one of my CTE classes. I knew my pathway would find me in a technical, hands-on environment. Upon graduation I enlisted in the United States Navy, where I made a 20-year career.\n\nWhile enlisted I took advantage of every school offered. My military vocational training was categorized by the level of complexity. More complex training courses counted as credit toward a college degree. The U.S. Navy’s Program Afloat College Education invites college professors to join a deployed crew, for Sailors like myself to take classes. Further, I pursued my associate degree in electrical mechanical technologies from Coastline Community College located in Fountain Valley, California.\n\nWhat barriers did you face in pursuit of higher learning?\n\nMy grandparents focused heavily on developing a strong work ethic. A higher education beyond high school wasn’t a topic in our home. Not that they didn’t want that for me… In truthfulness, I was a bit intimidated by the idea of going to college. I recognized my strength was not in academics, but as a hands-on, vocational learner. The Navy provided both confidence >amp; the financial ability to overcome any >amp; all obstacles.\n\nWhat led you to your field in CTE?\n\nThe Navy really set me up for success. The skills I gained during my military career opened up an opportunity with Siemens Wind Power. That experience combined with being a trained Navy instructor and recruiter — leading young people — made the transition to my current position a breeze.\n\nHow do you like working on campus?\n\nI LOVE IT!!! I’m closing out my eighth year with High Plains Technology Center >amp; it feels as if it were just yesterday that I joined the family.\n\nDo you have any advice that you would offer to students who intend to pursue postsecondary education in CTE?\n\nDon’t allow fear of the unknown or what appears to be an unsurmountable obstacle to stand in your way. For every problem there is a solution. Are you motivated to find the answer?\n\nLearn more about educational institution membership with ACTE.\n\nEIM Spotlight: Rick Smith (Warren County Career Center)\n\nMeet Rick Smith, superintendent of the Warren County Career Center in Lebanon, Ohio. Smith’s interview appears as part of a spotlight series on ACTE’s educational institution members (EIM).\n\nWarren County Career Center prepares youths and adults to make informed career choices. Warren County Career Center provides quality career and technical (CTE) education for adults and high school students in two campus locations and through 35 satellite programs at six feeder high schools. High school students may jump-start their postsecondary education to enter the workforce sooner. Adult students choose from full- and part-time programs that offer customized training.\n\nThe school educates students for success in health care, manufacturing, cosmetology and many other. Warren County Career Center fuels the local business industry by providing a pipeline of and talented and knowledgeable workers.\n\nRick Smith, Warren County Career Center, EIM\n\nTell me a little about your job on campus. What’s your job title and what do you do?\n\nI have been the superintendent of Warren County Career Center since June 1, 2017. I am blessed to lead our district, where I work with a wonderful board of education, staff, community, and some of the best students in Warren County, Ohio.\n\nCan you tell me a little about your upbringing?\n\nI grew up with a speech impediment. And, so, if someone told me back in elementary school that I would grow up to be a teacher and eventually a superintendent, I would not have believed them. I think that obstacle led me to a career in education. To tell students that they can overcome whatever they think might hold them back. We all have challenges to overcome to find success. Your challenges might be economic, might be physical, and so on, but you have to overcome it.\n\nWhat was your education experience like? What did you study?\n\nI think it was typical. I went to high school in a small Midwestern town here in Ohio — Upper Sandusky. A great place to grow up. Teachers there are the reason I work in education now. I had some great role models there!\n\nI followed a traditional college preparatory route until I graduated high school in 1980. But today’s students have so many more and better options than I had. CTE students in Warren County may enter college better prepared than I was. They can take the skill training we provide and go right into a rewarding, well-paying career. Whatever career path they choose, CTE students possess valuable life skills.\n\nI attended college at Minnesota State University. A great place to learn about the education field! I then completed my master’s work through Concordia University, St. Paul. After moving back to Ohio to be near my family, I took administrative classes through the University of Findlay. I earned my superintendent licensure through Ashland University.\n\nWhat barriers did you face in pursuit of postsecondary education? How did you overcome those obstacles?\n\nMy dad was a 30-plus year blue collar worker and my mom mostly worked from home. They pushed me, my twin brother Randy, and my other three brothers toward furthering our education. My brothers entered the workforce after high school and then obtained additional education to further their careers. I think my brothers and I are great examples of how education can work — no matter what direction you go.\n\nHow do you like working on campus?\n\nI love the day-to-day interaction with students. The pandemic has shown me that the relationships we build with our students are so important. We recently resumed limited face-to-face instruction on our campus. Students and staff alike were so happy to have the opportunity to interact again (with masks on, physical distancing, etc). I love to visit our career tech labs, to see students and staff doing those hands-on things they love so much.\n\nIs there anything else about your life that you’d like to share?\n\nThe coronavirus affected education in a major way. At the career center, we try to look at it as an opportunity to do things differently, and even better.\n\nDo you have any advice that you would offer to students who intend to pursue postsecondary education in CTE?\n\nCTE is a win-win for all students. Our students are not just culinary arts or auto technology students, who know only how to make a great meal or fix a broken car. They leave our career center as well-rounded, educated students who are ready for the world. I am confident they will find success and happiness, and they will make the most of the opportunities coming their way.\n\nLearn more about educational institution membership with ACTE.\n\nEIM Spotlight: Laura Jaime (West-MEC)\n\nMeet Laura Jaime, director of curriculum, instruction >amp; assessment at Western Maricopa Education Center (West-MEC). Jaime’s interview appears as part of a spotlight series on ACTE’s educational institution members (EIM).\n\nWest-MEC is a public school district dedicated to providing innovative career and technical education (CTE) programs that prepare students to enter the workforce and pursue continuing education. West-MEC CTE programs offer students opportunities to earn college credit and industry credentials.\n\nLaura Jaime, West-MEC, EIM\n\nWhat is your job title and what do you do?\n\nAs the director of curriculum, instruction >amp; assessment, I oversee the teaching and learning for the district. At West-MEC, we believe that all students can learn; teachers make the difference. Success leads to success, and high expectations lead to student success. We design all of our curriculum around the CTE delivery model:\n\nClassroom instruction\n\nHands-on instruction\n\nWork-based learning\n\nLeadership development\n\nWe have also developed a three-tier system of support, our Teacher Induction Academy, to help all instructors succeed. We provide them with top-notch professional development, instructional coaching and support, along with networking and mentorship opportunities.\n\nCan you tell me a little about your upbringing?\n\nI am from a small rural farming community in Illinois. My mom was a schoolteacher for over 36 years. Like most children, I told myself that I would never have the same career as my parents. I wanted to be a marine biologist. I wanted to train orca whales at SeaWorld. Then I had a phenomenal science teacher, Mr. Johnson, who inspired me to pursue my passion for biology and also to inspire others. I followed in his footsteps and became a middle school science teacher.\n\nWhat was your education experience like? What did you study?\n\nI earned a bachelor of science, with a dual major in biology and secondary education from Eastern Illinois University.\n\nAfter eight years, I left my teaching position and took a job working as a career counselor for a career and technical education district (CTED). I realized that I enjoyed community outreach, program management, and curriculum and instruction. I initially thought that I would like to be a middle school or high school principal, so I went back to school to get a master of education administration from the University of Phoenix.\n\nLife has a funny way of making a full circle. While I was student teaching, my cooperating teacher told me that I should be a curriculum writer instead of a teacher, because I was extremely organized and had fantastic lesson plans. Now, as I look back, she was right. Curriculum and instruction was where I am supposed to be. I rounded out my education with a doctoral degree in organizational leadership — with an emphasis in K–12 leadership — from Grand Canyon University.\n\nSchool was something that I always had to work at. My brother is four years older than I am, and I always felt that I had to meet his standards. He was valedictorian of his high school and went on to be an orthopedic surgeon. It was a great accomplishment for me to finish my doctoral degree, and to have him there to watch me graduate. Over the years, I learned how to accomplish my goals.\n\nWhat barriers did you (or you family) face in pursuit of higher learning?\n\nMy stepchildren were first-generation students. Both of their biological parents have high school diplomas, but my older stepdaughter was the first one in the family to go to college. She has her bachelor’s degree in education and teaches seventh grade language arts. My son is a product of CTE; he’s a barber. My youngest will be a senior in high school and is looking into another CTE field: dentistry.\n\nI believe that I have had an impact on their choices to pursue postsecondary opportunities that can improve their lives and make them economically independent.\n\nWhat led to your current role at West-MEC?\n\nI have been with West-MEC for three years now. When I initially came to West-MEC, I was the program quality manager; I oversaw all of the West-MEC programs to ensure quality and compliance with the department of education and CTED legislation. I enjoyed this position. It allowed me to network with other member district personnel, and to make several connections within the community.\n\nIn fall 2019, the position I hold now — director of curriculum, instruction and assessment — opened up. This presented an excellent opportunity for me to step up in the organization and continue the great work with program development.\n\nHow do you like working on campus?\n\nMy role allows me to visit all of our campuses and to work with all of our instructors. West-MEC currently has four central campuses, where students travel from 49 high schools in northern and western parts of the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area. I love being part of a school district that puts students first and provides them with career opportunities that they might not have known were possible.\n\nDo you have any advice that you would offer to students who intend to pursue postsecondary education in CTE?\n\nCTE allows students the opportunity to learn transferable skills. The industry credentials earned within a chosen career field provide students with a springboard into industry. CTE is not a place to stop learning, but a pathway to future learning. We can all learn something new every day; CTE allows us to network within our communities and develop the employability skills needed to be successful in any field.\n\nLearn more about educational institution membership with ACTE."
