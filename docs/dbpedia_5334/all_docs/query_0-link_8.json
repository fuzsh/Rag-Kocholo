        "text": "This chapter is a step towards the US history of media-in-cars. Its primary argument is that the introduction and steady integration of media into the automobile interior transformed drivers’ and passengers’ experience of automobility. This change, which involved design, marketing and popular culture, constitutes the mediatization of the automobile. Periodizing this history into pre- and post-Second World War and the turn of the last century leads to a second argument. Media in cars proliferated and became more sophisticated and were increasingly presented as an essential component of the desirable contemporary automobile. This process accelerated as the operation of cars grew more dependent on computer technology. Together, these developments pushed the car’s mediatization into the more radical stage of digitalization—GPS, mobile hot spots, touch screens and voice recognition, along with various driver-assistance technologies—whose next, even more revolutionary change in automobility is the autonomous automobile. This will be a multiply networked vehicle piloted by powerful artificial intelligence, perhaps allowing more efficient traffic flows and promoting greater travel safety. Crucially, the self-driving car, as currently conceived, will be a site of intense media consumption, a place where digital media are both operational infrastructure and means of infotainment.\n\nThe demise of 12 American automobile brands over the past century is discussed. Companies can respond to various difficulties by making decisions on their automobile offerings. These decisions are central to relationships between companies and consumers. These decisions included broadening their offerings to address a larger portion of the automobile market, narrowing their offerings to address the company’s financial situation, focusing on current offerings to keep them successful, or switching to other offerings to achieve greater profits. A case-based approach is used to explore the detailed nature of this range of attempts to change. Due to a variety of factors characterized in terms of four levels of explanation, these brands failed. Consequently, these companies’ attempts to transform via offering-related decisions failed. These failures reflect, to a great extent, inabilities to balance the tension between differentiated offerings and economies of scale or market demands.\n\nW eb 2.0 provides gathering places for Internet users in blogs, forums, and chat rooms. These gathering places leave footprints in the form of colossal amounts of data regarding consumers' thoughts, beliefs, experiences , and even interactions. In this paper, we propose an approach for firms to explore online user-generated content and \" listen \" to what customers write about their and their competitors' products. Our objective is to convert the user-generated content to market structures and competitive landscape insights. The difficulty in obtaining such market-structure insights from online user-generated content is that consumers' postings are often not easy to syndicate. To address these issues, we employ a text-mining approach and combine it with semantic network analysis tools. We demonstrate this approach using two cases—sedan cars and diabetes drugs—generating market-structure perceptual maps and meaningful insights without interviewing a single consumer. We compare a market structure based on user-generated content data with a market structure derived from more traditional sales and survey-based data to establish validity and highlight meaningful differences.\n\nby Karl E.
