        "text": "Why we talk about 'Performance You'll Notice'\n\nAs OEM’s change engine designs, increase fuel mileage, and reduce emissions, new challenges emerge for lubricants.\n\nSinclair has kept pace with those changes and has developed powerful new formulations, including technology that manage friction through a thin oil film that helps prevent wear and tear due to metal-to-metal contact between rotating parts and reduces deposits and oxidation.\n\nWhile you may have to be a scientist to understand exactly how it all works, seeing – and feeling – Sinclair performance for yourself is as easy as using any of our quality oils and lubricants.\n\nWhen it comes to lubrication technology, however, Sinclair is no dinosaur. They’ve stayed on the cutting edge, readily adapting to changes in engine design, improved fuel economy, power density demands, and others. Sinclair wrote the book on lubrication – literally, with the publication of The Law of Lubrication in the 1920’s. Since that time, they’ve continuously updated and improved their family of products while still holding true to the belief that, ‘for every machine, of every degree of wear, there’s a scientific Sinclair oil to suit its speed and seal its power.’\n\nToday, as always, Sinclair remains an American-owned and operated company, built on integrity and loyalty, and dedicated to treating our customers and co-workers the way we would like to be treated – like family.\n\nInnovation and Technology at Work in Sinclair Lubricants\n\nTechnology changes everything. That’s especially true when it comes to Sinclair oils and lubricants. Actually, it’s technology and chemistry that uses heat to change everything. Because when engines trigger high heats, our lubricants also trigger a chemical reaction that actually changes the molecular structure of Sinclair oil.\n\nOur lubricants are formulated to create a friction-fighting film. This film creates multiple contact points in engine surfaces where it helps prevent the friction caused by metal-to-metal contact between rotating parts.\n\nThe result? Performance you’ll notice."
