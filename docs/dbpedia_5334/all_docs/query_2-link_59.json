        "text": "What did you expect? \"We have all contractor cars tagged. Except Jim's car, he's afraid that the tags damage his paint so we let him\"\n\nIt is not upon to you or your boss to dictate the client his own security rules. Imho it sounds reasonable that contractor cars become tagged, I also think that your fears are unfounded. Should one of my coworkers come to me with such wishes I would not have him fired but will place him on the list of \"difficult\" persons, as he wants to bend reasonable rules because of unreasonable fears.\n\nIn my place it is ok to \"bend\" certain rules if the reason justifies it. For something as client security rules the mark is quite high. To even begin discussion, one must have a very well founded reason.\n\nAn example for \"bendable\" rules is the requirement to only use company issued work boots: It is fine when somebody uses other shoes, as long as they have the needed safety certificates (to please both insurance and lawyer), cover the ankles (see before) and the exterior is not too different from the company issued ones (so somebody in the upper floors can still boast about the fancy uniform work dress the company uses to project their image).\n\nHowever I'd like to present you some viable ways\n\nEvasion\n\nPark your untagged car somewhere else (Will have detriments for you: \"It takes so long for him to come, just because he thinks that the tags will damage his paint\")\n\nUse a taxi. Detriments: See above.\n\nMinimizing impact\n\nCover the magnets with adhesive tape to avoid scratching.\n\nWhile I don't share your fear of sunbleaching, I'd suggest to alternate the location of the tag to avoid it.\n\nAlternative\n\nAffix the tag on the windows, place some soft fridge magnets on the inside, so that the tag magnets have something to grab on (Pay attention to be outside of the airbag radius should you drive around with a tagged car).\n\nVerify it\n\nQuestion your fears of the damage. Wait until damage happens, then have your boss compensate you.\n\nYou have your concerns... and I want to try to reassure you that most of what you are worried about in your post are mostly minor.\n\nThe modern printable vehicle magnets are soft and very flexible and come to the manufacturer on huge rolls instead of rigid sheets. I am familiar with companies using magnets for partial and full vehicle wraps (temporary or seasonal) and they actually protect the vehicle better than a custom paint job.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that they would directly cause any damage to your vehicle. If you are still concerned, ask for a design that includes rounded corners instead of a straight rectangle cut and there will not be any sharp edges on the magnet sign to begin with. Think of the flexible magnets that go on fridges, and imaging how difficult it would be to cause any damage to your paint with one of those.\n\nAs far as damage from uneven sun wear, you can easily remove it once you leave the job site. They are easy to attach and detach with no more effort than peeling a banana. If you travel to this job site 3 times a week for a few hours at a time... 10 hours of sun exposure during 77 hours (winter) or 90+ hours (summer) per week will make very little difference.\n\nAlso does the contract require that you have a magnet sign on both front doors of the car, or is it something that you only need to have on the driver side? (Requiring on both doors makes it more of an effort for you, and its possible you get distracted and forget to add/remove the opposite driver side sign).\n\nIs it something that you would be able to first park and then affix the sign to the door, or does the sign need to be in place before driving onto the property?\n\nFor me the bigger concern would be if the sign is stolen, vandalized or falls off.\n\nAs an employee are you responsible for the damage/loss?\n\nWhen you requisition the signs from the boss, recommend that you get 4 copies of the sign even if you are only required to put on one on the drivers side door. Explain that because they are easily removable, they could be lost or stolen and that it is better to have extras in the trunk then to show up on the job site and be refused access because the sign falls off during transit with no backup available. Explain that you think that 4 should be sufficient to last the entire year. (What you want to do is set the expectation that these are \"disposable\" and not valuable company assets that you need to be held 100% accountable).\n\nAlso, it is not really all that much more to order 4 custom signs than it is to order just the 1.\n\nIn fact the cost to get custom signs is less about the material and square footage cost to print and more about the setup and custom art. In printing, the cost per item always goes down the more you order... but if you order fewer than what you actually need then you end up spending considerably more in the long run."
