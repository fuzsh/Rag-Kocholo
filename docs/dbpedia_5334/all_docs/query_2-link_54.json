        "text": "Vehicle Brands in the Mafia Series.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Mafia series contains over 45 different vehicle brands, with more than 200 vehicles appearing within the series, spanning from 1930-2016. Some brands have as few as one vehicle, while others have over 20.\n\nMafia\n\nMafia included 16 vehicle brands, most prominenly Bolt, which represented the Ford Motor Company, and Schubert, which represented Chevrolet. The game also includes Lassiter, Wright, Falconer, and Ulver, among others.\n\nMafia II\n\nMafia II features over 20 vehicle brands. Most of the previously established brands were changed, but the brands were still based on a real world counterpart. Bolt became Smith, which represented Ford, and Schubert changed its spelling to Shubert, still representing Chevrolet. The only other brand to return was Lassiter, while many new brands were added, like Potomac, Walter, Houston, and Berkley, all representing a real world brand.\n\nMafia III\n\nMafia III includes over 15 vehicle brands, and it was the first game in the series to include boats. It introduced many new ones, like Bulworth, De'Leo, Eckhart, and Samson, while returning others, like Berkley, Lassiter, Potomac, and Smith. Along with this, the game went with a more varied approach, dispensing with each brand representing a real world counterpart and incorporating multiple brands into each manufacturers line-up.\n\nMany vehicles from the previous game returned with changes to their names. The Smith Thunderbolt became the Smith Moray, and the Potomac Indian became the Potomac Indiana. In others both manufacturer and model names changed, as in the case of the Shubert Beverly, which became the Berkley Altamont. Many manufacturers also include a rather eclectic range of vehicles, offering everything from sports cars to semi-trucks, and even boats in their lineup.\n\nMafia: DE\n\nMafia: Definitive Edition stays somewhat true to the original Mafia with its vehicle brands, Bolt returns, as does Lassiter. Shubert returns with the changed spelling adopted in Mafia II, however the game includes brands established in other games, like Smith.
