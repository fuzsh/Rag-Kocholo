Most of what I was going to say has been said already but I'll just say some of it again. That trigger switch with all of the wires and transistors is a variable speed, reversing speed control from a cordless drill. I've thought of using one for a similar project but I've never been able to acquire everything necessary to even begin to build any of the electric vehicles I have in mind (everything is so expensive and for a disabled parasite like myself who can barely survive there's just not much chance I ever will), but I would certainly do it better than that (wiring and layout wise and what not) if I could do it at all. Also that chassis appeared to be in really bad condition (from what little I could see on the small video), and if I had the kind of resources you do I would try to get it de-rusted in an acid bath and then repaired and then electrolytically plated (so it would get inside and out) with another metal such as nickel or tin or zinc or any number of things and then have it powder coated and then dipped in the best paint you can find (again to cover the inside also). And I also don't think a front hub motor is a very good choice (especially on hills). I'm not a fan of hub motors at all but if you have to use them I think you should put it/them on the rear. I think the most efficient design would be a very high RPM permanent magnet (preferably rare earth) brushless motor mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission. Did I mention I want to build my own electric vehicles?\n\n« Last Edit: April 18, 2014, 07:38:07 am by ToughBookMikey »\n\n\"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.\"\n\n\"The only people made safer by gun control are criminals and tyrants.\"\n\n\"One of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation.\"\n\ndigital\n\nContributor\n\nPosts: 47\n\nCountry:\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #27 on: April 18, 2014, 09:34:38 am »\n\nDave most of the work to be done in restoration could be done by the average handyman,the motor will have to conform to the Australian regulations in regard to power output in Watts.The biggest obstacle will be time and not losing interest in the project\n\nWytnucls\n\nSuper Contributor\n\nPosts: 3045\n\nCountry:\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #28 on: April 18, 2014, 10:05:04 am »\n\nDave doesn't strike me as a consummate handyman.\n\nTake the wreck to someone competent who can take care of the mechanical side in a short time and concentrate on what you really enjoy, its electrical systems.\n\nErikTheNorwegian\n\nFrequent Contributor\n\nPosts: 494\n\nCountry:\n\nAsberger, aspi, HIGH function, nerd...\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #29 on: April 18, 2014, 04:22:53 pm »\n\nSome take their C5 a little further than gearing it up.. way further...and some further away from pedals to the spaceage.\n\nThis is awsome...\n\nhttp://www.jetpower.co.uk/c5_media.htm\n\nhttp://www.jetpower.co.uk/c5/media/avon_c5.wmv\n\n« Last Edit: April 18, 2014, 04:25:59 pm by ErikTheNorwegian »\n\n/Erik\n\nGoooood karma is flowing..\n\nRefrigerator\n\nSuper Contributor\n\nPosts: 1573\n\nCountry:\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #30 on: April 18, 2014, 05:25:41 pm »\n\nCan't wait to see some big ass brushless outrunners with some huge LiPo packs and an enormous electronic speed controller in it.\n\nPs: that rust will come off pretty easily with some sandpaper and you can fill that crack with a welder, after all that you can sand and repaint it for some more longevity.\n\n« Last Edit: April 18, 2014, 05:30:52 pm by Refrigerator »\n\nI have a blog at http://brimmingideas.blogspot.com/ .

I restore old cars and most of them are far worse than this...\n\nMost of what you see is dirt, get some Simple Green and a bunch of rags - most of it will come off. For the plastics, do some research on how people clean C5's - there's probably a standard set of chemicals & tools.\n\nAs for the chassis, as others said:\n\nSand blast\n\nRe-weld broken areas, might need some extra metal, but a decent fabricator will figure that out...\n\nPowder coat - don't bother with paint, makes a mess\n\nBUT, you don't want to do any of this yourself. Find a good local metal fabricator, take the chassis to them and ask for it to be repaired & powder coated. They will have the equipment and/or contacts to get it all done.\n\nAs for the rusted bolts, after cleaning, spray them with bolt loosener (we use PB Blaster here in the US, make sure what you use is specifically for loosening rusted bolts) and let it sit for a few days.

Only thing bad about aluminium is that it corrodes with salt water easily, you can conform coat it or just move away from the coast.\n\nAlthough it's off topic, you can actually design much stronger, stiffer and lighter car chassis using modern high-strength steels. One of the main issues with aluminum is that it cracks when formed, which is why the chassis in your picture is made up of basically straight edges, flat planes and extruded pieces. In general, this design limitation can cause real issues, particularly when trying to design deformation zones for crash protection. Most of the Tesla Model S is steel for this very reason.\n\nI would note that this was not true when that chassis (a Lotus Exige, I'm guessing) was designed more than 15 years ago. You would not design a car like this today, the cost of production would be excessive except in very, very small numbers.\n\nBesides, the Lotus Elan chassis is a better example of something similar to the C5, it's steel and it's even lighter than the Exige:\n\n« Last Edit: April 18, 2014, 10:45:22 pm by ckm »\n\nToughBookMikey\n\nNewbie\n\nPosts: 5\n\nCountry:\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #35 on: April 19, 2014, 01:54:12 am »\n\nAs for the rusted bolts, after cleaning, spray them with bolt loosener (we use PB Blaster here in the US, make sure what you use is specifically for loosening rusted bolts) and let it sit for a few days.

Howes is hard to find, I finally got my local Napa (auto parts store) to get it and it's less expensive than just about anything else. I've even tried what must be the most expensive stuff (which I got from a free trial) which is Kroil and it was useless, it didn't meet any of their claims. So if you can possibly get Howes lubricator I would highly recommend it (and no I don't get paid for saying that, but as often as I recommend it to people I wish I would get paid for it). Also they used to have the worlds best cap design, it had a straw holder on the side of the cap so the straw was oriented with the side of the can and you could hold the can and straw in one hand, pull the cap off and snap it on the bottom of the can then mount the straw and use. But for some stupid reason they got rid of that design and went with the stupid design of having a straw slot across the top of the lid where if you try to store it that way it takes up a lot more space and your almost guaranteed to lose the straw.\n\n\"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.\"\n\n\"The only people made safer by gun control are criminals and tyrants.\"\n\n\"One of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation.\"\n\nCorporate666\n\nSupporter\n\nPosts: 2010\n\nCountry:\n\nRemember, you are unique, just like everybody else\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #36 on: April 19, 2014, 02:31:51 am »\n\nAluminum is generally bad for frames because it won't bend and flex like steel will... the aluminum just fatigues and cracks.

You can overbuild the hell out of it and likely be safe - but that kills the weight advantage. And at the end of the day, I don't think the frame Dave shows on his C5 is very heavy, certainly not worth the cost of designing something in aluminum when that one can so easily be welded and fixed.\n\nIt's not always the most popular person who gets the job done.\n\nCorporate666\n\nSupporter\n\nPosts: 2010\n\nCountry:\n\nRemember, you are unique, just like everybody else\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #37 on: April 19, 2014, 02:42:36 am »\n\nOr you can just use 6000 series aluminium alloy, wich is the one they use to make yachts and boats.

Fatigue cracking of aluminum happens due to loading/unloading of stress. There is no limit that you can stay below such that it won't happen. There is a threshold for steel/iron and titanium... they have a fatigue limit which, if you stay below it, you can apply those forces and have unlimited loading/unloading without failure. Not so with aluminum - it will eventually always fail even with small loads applied. It simply doesn't have the \"springiness\" that steel and titanium have.\n\nYou can engineer a stressed aluminum part such that the stresses involved are so far below what the part can take that the time to failure is far beyond the lifetime of your part, but with steel, if you are below the limit, the lifetime is essentially \"forever\".\n\nI agree - this is going way off topic, but I think for Dave's C5.. the only way to work in aluminum is either to do some serious engineering, or overbuild the shit out of it so the lifetime of the frame would be way beyond the lifetime of Dave... but that eliminates the weight savings partly or wholly, and costs metric craploads of $$.\n\nIt's not always the most popular person who gets the job done.\n\nToughBookMikey\n\nNewbie\n\nPosts: 5\n\nCountry:\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #38 on: April 19, 2014, 04:24:24 am »\n\nWell if he were to change the frame (which I think he said he didn't want to do), I would recommend Titanium.

Are you telling me that airplane wings have a stress-life-span ? ... or maybe the inside of the wings are a steel structure covered by aluminium panels ?... or in aerospace industry they use a kind of aluminum that has a stress-safe threshold ? Don't scare me man...\n\nSeanB\n\nSuper Contributor\n\nPosts: 16362\n\nCountry:\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #40 on: April 19, 2014, 10:42:14 am »\n\nAircraft wings have a definite fatigue life, and will need replacing of the main spars at a defined number of flight cycles so as not to exceed the fatigue limit. As well they are inspected regularly on minor services to ensure there are no cracks that will grow into a break. Typically they have the panels covering the root as a removeable part so that inspection is simple, but at a major service the whole wing will be ultrasonically or dye tested to check for fatigue. As well many aircraft have a G meter to measure stress loads during flight, and if the highest limits have been exceeded x number of times it will go in for fatigue crack detection irrespective of flight cycles or hours.\n\nIt takes a while to prep the metal for inspection, starting with cleaning it with detergent, stripping down to bare metal with paint remover ( and no sanding of the surface allowed or sand blasting as this may cover cracks) and then using either penetrant dye or an ultrasonic tester to check all through the surface and the inside. Sometimes the parts are X rayed as well to see internal flaws.\n\nThe fatigue inspection is also applied to the engines, as they also suffer from fatigue.\n\nThat is why you see many aircraft scrapped and why Jay Leno has so many jet powered cars, as the airframes cost more to check than the plane is worth, and the engines are in need of crack checking which can cost more than a new one, even if it may run for hundreds of hours more before it breaks. You do not want an engine to fail at max power, as you typically are in a takeoff and will crash as you have V1 and not V2 or are too low to abort around. in either case you make a big hole and burn in it.\n\nWytnucls\n\nSuper Contributor\n\nPosts: 3045\n\nCountry:\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #41 on: April 19, 2014, 11:23:12 am »\n\nMost aircraft with spar corrosion get scrapped, as they're too expensive to fix.\n\nWings do fail on old aircraft, so proper inspections are essential.\n\nEngines are less critical, as on twins or quads at least, a safe take-off or an abort are possible after engine failure.\n\ntwotires\n\nNewbie\n\nPosts: 1\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #42 on: April 19, 2014, 08:36:48 pm »\n\nHi Dave,\n\nMy first post, so, thank you for the EEVBLOG!

Because the frame itself is made of thin sheet stamped and formed into a frame, I'd be hesitant to electrolytically clean it anyway, since hydrogen embrittlement tends to be more of an issue with thin materials than it would be with say a frame made from tubular steel stock.\n\nThe fumes from electrolysis cleaning are also hazardous, and this isn't a process you can do indoors without special ventilation (and certainly not in Dave's lab). To electrolytically clean the frame, Dave would likely have to outsource the work to a third party, which could be cost prohibitive for a small project such as this.\n\nIf the steel alloy used for the frame contains lead (as suggested by others), that too would preclude the use of electrolytic cleaning, since the same process used to remove the rust would tend to leach the lead out of the steel alloy, weakening it.\n\nalecw35\n\nNewbie\n\nPosts: 3\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #45 on: April 23, 2014, 10:27:24 am »\n\nhello folks. My first post on here. Ive been watching most of the videos. Ive been interested in electronics, bikes and machines for years. Used to get the electronics magazines in the late 80s, they had loads of adverts. Some of the electronics surplus shops had Sinclair C5 parts for sale. Wheels, tyres and electric motors. I got some wheels and tyres and used them on weird chopper bikes I was building.\n\nThe tyres had a ribbed tread pattern, for lower rolling resistance, smoother ride so more efficient use of power, and more comfortable. Think the tyres were Sinclair branded V rubber brand. Small wheels and sitting in the \"recumbent\" position can be a bit of a pain after a while, in parts of the body, you dont want to be painfull.\n\nWheel/tyre sizes were 12\" and 16\". think they were 2\" wide. Those sizes are common on kids bikes, folding bikes, kids scooters, and those 3 wheel baby cart things. think the front wheel on Daves C5 is from a kids bike or cheap baby cart. Better getting an alloy rimmed wheel on there. Probably from a baby cart. As rusty steel rims will just eat through brake pads, with little stopping power. Also cheap steel rims from little bikes are often badly made, not terribly round, and not a constant width. Wheel rims are made by rolling up an extruded U section, then theres a join. On steel wheels this is welded. On cheap rims its badly ground down. So making it narrower for a little bit. So that is felt thru the brakes, hurts your hand, might cause noise or wheel lock up.\n\nHeres a video of, Chris Barrie Britain's Greatest Machines - S01E04: 1980s - The Future Has landed\n\nChris has a try in a C5. Shows the bare frame and some other parts. He also has a go in a Delorean, a Lotus, tanks and helicopters. Lots of things that any bloke would love to play with. Chris Barrie was in the Red Dwarf sci fi show. He was also Angelina Jolies butler on the Tomb Raider movies. As Ive said, lots of things that any bloke would love to play with.....meaning the big robot and cars and gadgets.\n\n« Last Edit: April 23, 2014, 11:57:55 am by alecw35 »\n\nelectrolux\n\nRegular Contributor\n\nPosts: 244\n\nCountry:\n\nRe: EEVblog #604 - Sinclair C5 Restoration - Part 1\n\n« Reply #46 on: April 24, 2014, 01:17:31 pm »\n\nHi Dave,\n\nMy first post, so, thank you for the EEVBLOG!
