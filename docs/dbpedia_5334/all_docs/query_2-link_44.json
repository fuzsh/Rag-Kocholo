        "text": "Jaguar I-Pace Electric Review – Range, Price, & Features\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace has made its mark in electric cars through its brilliant and rare reviews, awards, and performance.\n\nPrice of the Jaguar I-Pace\n\nThe I-Pace awards\n\nThe interior and exterior of the I-Pace\n\nThe driving range\n\nThe I-Pace charging requirements and properties\n\nInsurance\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace ticks most, if not all, boxes in what to expect in an electric car. The design, appearance, performance, and accessories are pretty unique and up-to-standard to have the perfect cruise. The reviews, praises, and awards by people who have used it and the entire motor vehicle community show more to its perfection. With electric car manufacturing currently taking centre stage in every production line, the competition to produce the most efficient and brilliant vehicle has gone up a notch.

It is among the top vehicles in numerous categories, thus elaborating its worthiness in motor vehicle performance and environmentally friendly machines. It has even broken the record by winning an unprecedented treble in the 2019 automotive awards. The perse nature of the awards is a tribute to the designers and manufacturers for a job well done.\n\nBeing the first of its kind in the Jaguar family, the reception and awards made it a big brand in the system, so much that it was known as the most decorated vehicle among the electric cars. Moreover, its international and regional awards in various countries like Germany, Scotland, United Kingdom, Canada, and Europe are not a compliment that you can overlook. From the best designed and eco-friendly vehicle of the year, the best SUV of the year, and the world car of the year, these accolades cannot get any bigger. Additionally, various programs and boards have given this fully electric vehicle five stars in safety, performance, design, eco-friendliness, comfort, and drive, which further stamps its impression in the market as one of the best all-electric SUVs.\n\nA sample of these other awards include:\n\nAuto Express Awards: Innovation Award\n\nAuto Express Driver Power Award for Best Electric Car\n\nAutobest's ECOBEST Award\n\nAutocar Awards Design Winner\n\nBBC Top Gear magazine EV of the Year\n\nCarbuyer Best Electric SUV\n\nChina Green Car of the Year\n\nDrivingElectric Reader Award for Car of the Year\n\nElectrifying.com Best Large Electric SUV\n\nEuropean Car of the Year\n\nGerman Car of the Year\n\nGreen Apple Awards Product Car Design Award\n\nUK Car of the Year Award\n\nWhat Car? Electric Car of the Year\n\nWhat Car? Green SUV of the Year\n\nWorld Car Design of the Year\n\nWorld Car of the Year\n\nWorld Green Car\n\nThe Interior of the I-Pace\n\nThe exterior design of this piece of beauty will always give you a reason to fall in love with it. The interior is no different; it follows through with exquisiteness and classiness. There are many features in the cabin that promotes your sense of comfortability before and during your ride. These standard features ensure that you can enjoy your drive from the balance, seat comfortability, space, additional navigation, and infotainment features in the vehicle.\n\nThe Jaguar SUV’s designer, Ian Callum, seems like he had all these features planned to give the driver a smooth yet entertaining cruise. The touch pro duo ensures you have control of most of the elements at the touch of the button. Though it can take you a while to get going and grasp its hang, it is a beneficial tool in ensuring you have a smooth drive. It also has an additional informative panel where you can set it to display different pieces of information as per your choice.\n\nThe cabin is generally spacious. The careful yet witty positioning of the battery packs at the base centre of the vehicle contributes to the car's weight balance. It provides a reasonable amount of space in the interior. You will get many standard tools and controls within the driver's reach, which will help maintain the temperature with the four one climate control and purification and filtration controls.\n\nBesides the standard tools and equipment that enhance the comfortability of the I-Pace, you can also have additional features like cabin pre-conditioning to ensure you achieve the desired temperature in the cabin. This feature manages the amount of energy used in temperature controls before you can start your drive. The good news is it does not utilise battery power. And to think you can achieve all these while using your remote app, quite a valuable piece of technology, right?\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace Driving Range\n\nThere is no hiding the speeds in which electric cars can achieve in general; the Jaguar I-Pace is no exception. Its acceleration that clocks approximately 4.5 sec from 0-60mph makes it stand out from other electric cars. You can quickly achieve a motorway speed of up to 70mph, where you can enjoy your quiet and undisturbed ride.\n\nThe interference in urban drives due to many activities in the area makes it difficult to achieve maximum speed. Therefore, you will most likely have a slower pace in these areas. However, with additional features Jaguar features in the updates and upgrades, the urban drive will be much easier and have a more comprehensive range.\n\nIt is important to note that the Jaguar I-Pace gives a combined total range of approximately 253 miles depending on the variant. You will probably do fewer miles in an urban drive due to the multiple stopovers for reasons like site seeing or photography. On the other hand, since the motorway drive is more straightforward, you will likely get more mileage from the charged batteries.\n\nIs the Jaguar I-Pace 4x4\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace is four-wheel drive. The all-electric SUV offers an excellent driving experience and has off roading capabilities. Additionally, the I-Pace can perform well in the snow and ice.\n\nThe I-Pace Charging Requirements and Properties\n\nThe battery packs and the charging properties of electric cars are the heart of the systems. So it is the most important specification of the Jaguar. The I-Pace has a Lithium-ion 90 kWh battery pack fitted at the vehicle's centre, and its power is distributed equally to both axels. As is expected, the battery capacity can last the car up to 292 miles, where you will need to replenish your batteries. The Jaguar has an onboard charger that is 11.0 kW and allows for fast charging. It can achieve at least 80% of its charge within 40mins with the DC fast-charging port. Without this provision, you will have to wait for at least 8 hours to charge the batteries fully. The older version with the 7kW charger can take up to 13 hours to fully charge the batteries.\n\nThere are numerous charging points across different countries. You only need to identify the electric cars I-Pace charging points using your google maps or the Jaguar's navigation maps, like in gas refill stations. With people embracing the electric cars technology, more charging points spread across different countries of different models that might be compatible with the I-Pace. Some Tesla destination charging stations are consistent with the Jaguar I-Pace.\n\nOnce at the charging station, you will have to turn off the vehicle, connect the charging cable to the charging point port, and start charging using Charge point car or your preferred mode of payment. The Jaguar I-Pace comes with two different charging cable types, which you can charge with: the DC level 3 or AC level 2. You will have different options when paying for your charging services. Generally, the Jaguar remote app will guide you into the different modes of payment, including Google pay or Apple pay.\n\nYou can also choose to install a home wall charger in your home, which will ease your charging process and usage. To get your wall home charger, you can contact your Jaguar dealer and have them install the charger. However, you need to note that you will have to call the dealer back to disconnect and dismantle for reconnection in your new home while shifting. The home charger usually uses a Level 1 or 2 cable, where the former uses the standard three-pin socket.\n\nJaguar I-Pace Insurance\n\nWith its high buying price and maintenance costs, you will have to pay high insurance premiums for this fully electric vehicle. Therefore, brace yourself accordingly. The beauty of the Jaguar I-Pace is inconceivable. With whatever it has achieved since its launch, it suffices to say that it raised the standards in electric cars. Fortunately, there is still much more to come with this car.\n\nIs the Jaguar I-Pace Safe & Reliable?\n\nThe I-Pace received a full 5 stars from Euro NCAP crash testing in 2018. The I-Pace scored well in al 4 categories, with 91% adult occupant protection, 81% child occupant protection, 73% vulnerable road users and 81% safety assist. Additionally the I-Pace comes with multiple safety features and assurances as standard, including lane keep assist, emergency braking and more. You can have peace of mind when travelling in the I-Pace that you and your passengers are safe."
