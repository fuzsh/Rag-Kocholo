In 1982 the company had their biggest success with the release of the ZX Spectrum, the biggest selling computer in the UK. Later on they released the ZX Spectrum+, which was the 48K Spectrum repackaged in a different form factor with a somewhat better keyboard and a reset button on the side.\n\nIn January 1984 Sinclair announced the infamous Sinclair QL, a 16-bit computer with looked much like the ZX Spectrum+ but was based on a 68008 CPU. Development however was behind schedule and the product only won the company bad press; production was suspended in 1985 and the price was slashed by 50% by the end of the year.\n\nIn 1985 the company released in Spain the ZX Spectrum 128K in collaboration with Spanish distributor Investr√≥nica, with Sinclair withholding release in UK until January 1986 due to local retailers stocking large amounts of unsold units of the Spectrum+.\n\nSinclair had released the iconic Sinclair C5 in January 1985 but sales weren't as good as expected, causing purposedly-created Sinclair Vehicles Ltd. to enter liquidation the same year. This disaster, combined with the failure of the QL and other products eventually resulted in the Sinclair brand name and assets being sold to Amstrad in 1986.\n\nProducts"
