        "text": "Can BYD compete with Toyota on its home turf? According to the latest sales data, #BYD accounted for nearly 3% of Japan‚Äôs EV market in the first half of 2024. And that‚Äôs after launching its first EV in the region just last year. According to the Japan Automobile Importers Association (JAIA), Japan‚Äôs imports fell 7% YOY (113,887) in the first half of 2024. As always, luxury automakers like Mercedes, BMW, and Audi held the biggest share of imports. However, imports of electric vehicles are on the rise. The data shows EV imports were up 17% and accounted for nearly 10% (10,785) of car imports in the first half of the year. BYD plans to launch at least one car every year in Japan. By the end of 2024, BYD plans to nearly double the number of sales outlets in Japan. It wants 90 showrooms in the region, up from around 55. By 2025, BYD aims to sell 30,000 vehicles in Japan to cut into Toyota‚Äôs home market. üìñ Source https://lnkd.in/g8ANbYKi #IONAS #CleanMobility #eMobility #ElectricCars #FutureMobility #Batteries #Automotive #ElectricVehicles #AutonomousVehicles #EV #Lithium #Innovation #Sustainability #Recycling #Future #Energy #Efficiency #Technology #AVEVAI #TomTsogt üîîüëç\n\n‚ÄúBYD Co., China‚Äôs top-selling car brand, reported a record quarterly profit Monday, rounding out its best period ever for electric vehicle sales despite a sectorwide slowdown. Net income grew 82% from the same time last year to 10.4 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in the three months through September, in line with the company‚Äôs preliminary guidance earlier in October. Revenue rose 38% to 162 billion yuan.‚Äù ‚ÄúNet income for the first nine months of the year jumped to 21.4 billion yuan, already higher than its full-year figure of 16.6 billion yuan in 2022. Shenzhen-based BYD‚Äôs best-selling car models include the Song sport utility vehicle and Dolphin hatchback. BYD sold almost as many fully electric vehicles as Tesla in the third quarter, falling just 3,456 short. Including hybrids, BYD sold a total 822,094 vehicles in the three-month period. BYD‚Äôs strength comes despite sales growth of new-energy cars in China broadly slowing.‚Äù ‚ÄúShipments are expected to rise less than 1% month-on-month in October, according to the Passenger Car Association. Analysts‚Äô improving profit outlook for BYD has helped make its stock more attractive, driving its forward earnings multiple down to about 18 times, compared with over 50 times for Tesla. BYD‚Äôs shares are up 40% in Hong Kong over the past 12 months and 28% year-to-date.‚Äù\n\nAttention Automotive Enthusiasts and Industry Experts: üöóüîå Exciting times ahead for the UK's electric vehicle landscape! Chinese EV powerhouse BYD (Build Your Dreams) is steering towards a major market shift with their eyes set on the UK! üåü BYD has recently achieved a significant milestone by becoming the official E-mobility partner for the Euro 24 championships. This strategic move is designed to accelerate their brand presence and introduce British drivers to an innovative range of electric vehicles. With ambitious plans to conquer the UK market, BYD is gearing up for rapid expansion. They're targeting every vehicle segment by mid-2025 and are on track to launch up to 60 retail locations throughout the UK within this year. ü§ù Collaboration is key to their strategy, as they seek to forge partnerships with established UK retailers. Leveraging local market knowledge and expertise, BYD aims to integrate seamlessly into the automotive landscape, providing consumers with more sustainable, cutting-edge EVs. üîç Curious about this electrifying development? https://lnkd.in/esBUq4Kg #BYD #ElectricVehicles #UKAutomotive #EcoMobility #Innovation #SustainableTransport #BYDUKLaunch #AutomotiveIndustry #Euro24 #EVRevolution\n\nLast year, one of the larger #EV manufacturers from #China started expanding into the #Thailand market with the introduction of an #electricSUV, the Aion Y Plus. At that time, one hundred of these EVs in right-hand-drive configuration boarded a vehicle transporter ship at Guangzhou‚Äôs Nansha Port and shipped across to Thailand. Now, the brand has announced another key right-hand-drive market with this time announcing #HongKong as the next market it aims to enter. Like Thailand, the brand has launched the Aion Y Plus SUV with plans to build 6 stores in the country in 2024 according to a report by cnevpost. No details on the pricing in the Hong Kong market were announced but its likely to be released in the coming weeks. The Aion Y is offered in multiple variants in China with a starting price of $A25,700, making it one of the more affordable EVs. For comparison, the #BYD Atto 3 has a starting price of just shy of $A30,000. This model‚Äôs variants range from battery sizes of 51.9 kWh going all the way up to 70 kWh for the top-spec model. Depending on the battery size, the base model delivers up to 430 km on the generous CLTC cycle while the top-spec variants with the larger battery can bump that range up to 610 km of CLTC range. The company has also announced that it will be launching multiple new EV models in the Hong Kong market in 2024. According to the latest industry data and covered in the latest report, GAC Aion has sold nearly 500,000 EVs in 2023 with plans for international expansion in full swing. As part of this expansion, GAC Aion closed 2023 off by announcing a new factory in Thailand that will be manufacturing up to 50,000 new EVs a year once it‚Äôs up and running. At that time, the reports stated that this factory will be up and running in the first phase of production kicking off by July 2024. This is good news for other markets outside of Thailand as this plant will be producing cars for local and export markets. With markets like Thailand and Hong Kong turning into a launch pad for many EV manufacturers, it‚Äôs likely that GAC Aion will also be exploring other right-hand-drive markets like ours in #Australia."
