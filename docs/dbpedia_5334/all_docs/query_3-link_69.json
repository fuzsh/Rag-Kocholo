        "text": "Sir Clive Marles Sinclair was an English entrepreneur and inventor, best known for being a pioneer in the computing industry, and as the founder of several companies that developed consumer electronics in the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nProject Summary\n\nThe Sinclair C5 was the brainchild of Sir Clive Sinclair. Sinclair was a visionary entrepreneur of his time, and, with his recent death, the estate has been tasked with solving the problems of the original C5 and launching a prototype that will serve the needs of a modern-day commuter. This project is set forth to re-design the C using modern technology and launch a prototype to be called the Sinclair C6.\n\nSir Clive Sinclair – Vision for the Sinclair C\n\nRefer to the original marketing brochure located here: wearethemutants/2017/08/07/sinclair-c5- sales-brochure-1985/\n\nQuite simply, the moto-car is not ideal to provide the intimate, personal transport we need as individuals. Which is where the Sinclair C5 comes in. Sinclair’s reputation is built on cutting giants down to size, turning impersonal tyrants into personal servants. Sinclair took a desk-top calculator and put it in your pocket&amp; took the big-business computer and tucked it into your living room&amp; took the television set and made it smaller than a paperback. Now, with the C5 Sinclair Vehicles puts personal, private transport back where it belongs – in the hand of the individual. Electric vehicles are the vehicles of the future. The Sinclair C5 represents the state of the art now – and for some time to come. But the C5 is just the beginning&amp; by the early 1990s, Sinclair will have on the roads a range of fast, quiet, astonishingly economical family vehicles. And you can drive the first of the many – today!\n\nIssues with the original Sinclair C5:\n\nThe original C5 faced serious problems with public perception from a botched marketing launch and negative reviews from the press.\n\nCommon concerns:\n\nToo vulnerable in traffic because of its low profile,\n\nA sharp turn easily lifts a rear wheel,\n\nIt is hazardously silent,\n\nDisappears below a car driver&#039;s sight-line when pulling up alongside\n\nSlow speeds would cause traffic jams,\n\nMiniscule front and rear lights,\n\nExposure to the elements.\n\nLocation of the handlebars received a mixed review, some felt it was easy to master with the semi-recumbent driving position, some felt it was awkward and difficult to maneuver.\n\nProject goals:\n\nHonor the vision of the original C5,\n\nModernize the vehicle for today’s commuter,\n\nCreate a prototype Sinclair C6.\n\nPreliminary requirements:\n\nVehicle must be safe,\n\nDurable for multiple users,\n\nBattery life and power must be maximized,\n\nVehicle dimensions should not exceed 200 cm in length by 120 cm wide,\n\nVehicle should be powerful enough to maintain speed on an 8% road grade while carrying 180 pounds,\n\nTolerant to various weather conditions,\n\nModern or futuristic design,\n\nElectric powered,\n\nTarget speed should be around 40 MPH,\n\nMobile app with the following features: o GPS vehicle locator, o Connection to payment processing services including Bitcoin, o Rental start and stop services, o Maintenance notifications, o User manual and vehicle guides, o Mileage indicator, o Social opportunity to connect with other Sinclair C6 enthusiasts, o Reminders, o Others?\n\nRequirements for consideration:\n\nThe C6 should be accessible for individuals with mobility issues,\n\nThere should be one model with all options,\n\nDriverless feature,\n\nDashcam or other video devices.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nThe enhanced vision for the Sinclair C6 is a low-cost, small, commuter vehicle designed to be a shared service like urban scooter and bicycle rentals. A user should be able to use the mobile app to locate the nearest C6 and rent the vehicle for a period of time.\n\nIt is assumed, based on preliminary market research, that the Sinclair C6 may appeal to bicycle enthusiasts and an eclectic population of innovative and creative individuals in a dense urban setting. Portland Oregon has a large bicyclist population, has been rated one of the world’s best cities for cycling, and has a dense urban commuter population. Additionally, Portland has a culture of entrepreneurship, individual expression, and creativity. As such, Portland has been selected as the target market to launch the C6, and the design and feature set should align with the Portland demographic."
