Mind you, most of these startups fail or stall for many years at a time. But as Scorpio pointed out, you've still got the problem of how to secure anything like that at either end of the journey. A folding format would be great, but it'll take a lengthy consultation with an origami master (black belt)\n\n... to design the lightweight but safe in an impact folding bodywork. Or a generative AI algorithm.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a two seater where both can pedal. Need bucket style seats.

It's often only shaped compressed wood under the sponge, which could be replaced with a shape more useful for your needs, and reupholstered. The wood could be steamed into shape.

She wants to pedal too, not just be a passenger.\n\nAnother possibility is to obtain a bucket seat intended for a recumbent and shape the front for cyling on an upright tandem, then attach it to the seatpost. I'd worry about the extra weight and leverage that a larger higher seat would have on the seatpost, but you could brace it from inside using a short steel bar welded in. You could also weld a piece of steel tube onto the top of the frame where it meets the seatpost, to stop that becoming damaged. Of course the bucket seat for a recumbent would be for a more reclined cycling posture, but you could glue a wedge shaped hard foam cushion to the back. Then add a seatbelt. Yes it's all a bodge.\n\nHow about a roll-your-own-to-roll using \"Old bike parts\"?

That's achievable, maybe 20 inch sprung forks on the front for comfort and an electric motor, I've seen front hub motors promoted on here for such a beast. Or I could swap my Bbs01b 250w over, would that need a differently configured motor though, rpm etc? Currently on my hybrid with 700c rims, I'd put a 26 on the back of the Tandem.\n\nI have a 17ah hailong battery, just need a carrier for the frame.\n\nHave I seen a freewheel bottom bracket gubbins mentioned here, I know there is such a thing, so the Stoker doesn't have to shovel coal on the fire all the time?\n\nThanks for the other suggestions, even the BamBuk, especially if you are offering to pay for it, nigh on £10k.\n\nI've spotted a 5 point harness on fleabay for my sleepy stoker, she wouldn't be able to flop sideways. It's also possible to fit high rise bars over the seat on the vision, instead of the under seat steering. This would give leverage to control the bike when stationary.\n\nHow about this? There's a \"motor kit\" available too, can't see how much the bike weighs, store vertically against a wall:\n\nNot a serious suggestion: Weld two mountain bikes together? FF video to the end:"
