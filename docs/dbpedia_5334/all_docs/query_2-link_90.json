        "text": "The driver accused of hitting a Tesla with a Jeep on a mountain outside of Las Vegas and driving away has been identified, according to a Nevada State Police traffic crash report obtained by News 3.\n\nThe suspected hit-and-run driver is 38-year-old Asya Hovhannisyan, who lives in Las Vegas, according to the documents. She faces two civil infractions and a misdemeanor citation, according to court records. The traffic violations are failing to decrease speed or use care under certain circumstances and unsafe turn using improper position or method at intersection. The criminal complaint charge is duty to stop at scene of accident involving damage to vehicle or other property which is driven/attended.\n\nHovhannisyan is accused of hitting the Tesla at the Lee Canyon Road and Deer Creek Road intersection on Mt. Charleston on July 7. The Tesla dash camera recorded the impact. The Tesla stopped at the intersection around 1:10 p.m. when the Jeep Rubicon appeared to take a right turn too wide and crashed head-on into it.\n\nThe Tesla, driven by Radu Stefan, reversed and rammed into the Jeep. The car continued accelerating forward as it turned left onto Lee Canyon Road, and swerved into the mountain as well as across the road before coming to a stop. When the Tesla reversed back to the intersection, the Jeep was gone.\n\nNews 3 on July 12 and shared the dash cam video, which circulated online with more than 13 million impressions onCristen Drummond's X page.\n\nThe traffic report stated a lead came in on the same day the story aired. More tips were reported in the following days, including on July 15 where a lead helped the investigator obtain the license plate number of the Jeep. The trooper visited the registered owner's address and met a woman who stated to the trooper that the person police were looking for \"was her son. She called him,\" and the trooper \"arranged to meet him at his office.\"\n\nAt the office, police met a man and woman who, \"were clearly the two individuals in V1 (the jeep) based on the video footage.\" The investigator asked the duo, \"if they would like to view the dash camera footage from the Tesla of the collision, they stated no they already seen it.\" However, they were still shown the video.\n\nThe report stated that \"appropriate enforcement action was taken,\" and at the end of the report, it said, \"Case closed.\"\n\n\"Our story, I think, will prove that things can be fixed,\" Stefan said. \"Thanks to you and the local television News 3 we were able to get some information from people with a good heart, and based on those information, we submitted to the police, and they were like, in two days, three days, I think they were able to identify the driver.\"\n\nStefan said he and his wife, Angela, were relieved when a driver was identified, but they continue to recover physically and emotionally from the crash.\n\n\"We were on a roller coaster,\" Stefan said. \"Dealing with insurances and a lot of uncertainty regarding what happened to the car, what happened to us.\"\n\nNews 3's Cristen Drummond asked about the car accelerating forward after the crash, \"Do you think your foot hit the pedal? Or was it a possible malfunction on the car when it was hit?\" Stefan said, \"So, at that moment, I just cannot recall what happened. I know my foot was on the floor of the car. So, because of the very hard impact, my wife said maybe I was trying to step on the brake, and it slipped and touched the acceleration. I just, I just don't know.\"\n\nStefan does not plan to recover the Event Data Recorder from the car. The states, \"The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an airbag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data to help analyze the vehicle status and driving data at the time of an accident and to be used for post-accident cause analysis and responsibility determination.\"\n\nStefan said the Tesla is now in possession of his insurance company. Stefan did not have full coverage, liability-only. However, he said his insurance was able to file a claim with Hovhannisyan's insurance once she was identified.\n\n\"The car was considered a total loss,\" Stefan said. \"The cost of repairs was very high, so the insurance company decided to take it and compensated us. We just received the money today to get the car, a similar car.\"\n\nStefan said he is grateful for the community's help.\n\nNews 3 attempted to contact Hovhannisyan but did not receive a response. However, Victor Balian, who identified himself as the passenger and owner of the Jeep, called Cristen Drummond.\n\nBalian said Hovhannisyan drove away because she was scared when the Tesla hit the Jeep after the initial impact. When asked why they didn't call 911 after leaving the intersection, Balian said, \"We didn't know what's going on. We were so confused from the hit.\"\n\nBalian said they were questioning if Stefan was trying to kill them."
