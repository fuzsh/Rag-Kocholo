        "text": "Sinclair C5. Grey and black with yellow trim. No. '2250'. Serial number 'V 100051003366'.\n\nLaunched in January 1985 and made in Merthyr Tydfil, the C5 electric vehicle was intended to be the first of a generation of quiet, economical and pollution-free vehicles which would become widespread in the 1990s. Although many thousands were sold, overall sales fell far short of expectations and production had ceased by the end of 1985. Technically the vehicle is an 'electrically-assisted pedal cycle'. Its final development was influenced by government legislation in 1983 which allowed such vehicles to require no licence, insurance or helmets to be worn, provided that the maximum weight did not exceed 60kg (132Ibs) and the maximum speed 15 m.p.h. The other great advantage was that the minimum age to drive the vehicle was 14 years. The C5 was designed primarily for urban use with a maximum range of 30 miles before the battery had to be recharged. The running costs worked out at five miles for one penny. The attractions of the vehicle were not, however, sufficient to generate the hoped-for sales with a production line capable of assembling 56 vehicles an hour. The C5 has thus passed into the history of motoring and the age of the electric vehicle for widespread personal transport has yet to arrive."
