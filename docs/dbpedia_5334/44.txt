When mechanic Bill Sinclair returned from the war in 1945 to be reunited with his family and open a garage in Port Talbot, he cannot possibly have imagined the bright future that lay ahead for his fledging venture.

Seventy five years after his vehicle repair business began, the Sinclair Group is now recognised as the largest motor group in Wales from where 15,000 cars are sold and 50,000 customers are looked after every year by our 1,000-strong workforce. Nine prestigious brands are represented in 22 state-of-the-art retail outlets – all of which are a far cry from the site of the former sawmill where our success story started.

Today this thriving organisation is still family-owned and as steadfastly committed to providing professional and personal service to its many customers across Wales and the whole of the UK.

FAMILY VALUES REMAIN VERY MUCH AT THE HEART OF THE COMPANY AND SO DOES VOLKSWAGEN.

Since 1974 when the Volkswagen franchise was awarded, the Group has forged a strong and successful association with the famous marque. Car sales commenced in the same location in Dan-y-Bryn Road, Port Talbot, where the Company was founded almost three decades previously and still continue to this day.

Over the years, the relationship with Volkswagen has gone from strength-to-strength and the passenger car brand is now the most represented in our portfolio with six retail locations in operation. Port Talbot was joined by sister dealerships that were opened in Bridgend (1981), Neyland (2003), Cardiff and Newport (both 2008), whilst in Swansea, the retailer that originally began trading in Gorseinon moved to brand new, purpose-built premises on the city’s SA1 development in 2013.

But it’s not only Volkswagen car drivers who we have been honoured to serve. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles was added to the fold in 1998 and has also become an integral part of the Group with dedicated van centres in Cardiff and Swansea.

" I AM IMMENSELY PROUD OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BY THIS COMPANY. THE BUSINESS COULD NEVER BE WHERE IT IS TODAY WITHOUT THE HARD WORK, COMMITMENT AND ENTHUSIASM OF THE TEAMS IN EACH OF OUR RETAIL OUTLETS AS WELL AS THE INCREDIBLE LOYALTY OF THE CUSTOMERS WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE ARE HONOURED TO SERVE."

We are a Company that is proud of its heritage and the many years of Volkswagen brand experience behind us, which have resulted in generations of motorists making us their first port-of-call for new and used vehicles as well as maintenance, servicing, parts and repairs.

We’ve certainly come a long way from our humble beginnings but we’re very much here to stay.
