About Lompoc

Local Area Info: Lompoc, California

Lompoc (/?l?mpo?k/, LOM-poke) (Purisimeño: Lompo', "Stagnant Water" ; Spanish: Lumpoco) is a city in Santa Barbara County, California, on the west coast of the United States. The city was incorporated on August 13, 1888. The population was 42,434 at the 2010 census, up from 41,103 at the 2000 census.

Before European settlers arrived, the area around Lompoc was inhabited by the Chumash people. The name of the city is derived from a Purisimeño term, "Lum Poc", which means "stagnant waters" or "lagoon". The Spanish called it "Lumpoco". In 1837, the Mexican government sold the area as the Rancho Lompoc land grant. After the United States gained control of California in the Mexican–American War (1846–48), the valley was acquired by Thomas Dibblee, Albert Dibblee and William Welles Hollister. Hollister sold his share to the Lompoc Valley Land Company, and it was on that portion of the land that the present-day Lompoc was established as a temperance colony.

Lompoc was originally intended to be named New Vineland, after the temperance colony in New Jersey. It then became a military town with the completion of nearby Camp Cooke (now Vandenberg Air Force Base). The city is known as the flower seed capital of the world.

Lompoc Employee Drug Testing

Businesses that utilize an employee drug testing program are commonly referred to as a Drug Free Workplace. However, many times companies do not fully qualify as a Drug Free Workplace because the drug testing program which they use does not have all of the components which make up a true Drug Free Workplace.

The benefits of being a true Drug Free Workplace can include but are not limited to:

Enhanced Employee Performance

Reduced Job-Related Accidents

Reduced Employee Absenteeism

Lower Workers Compensation Rates

Improved Employee Moral

Customer Satisfaction

In addition, many companies regardless of size report that being a Drug Free Workplace has increased the quality of job applicants and improved the overall workplace environment.

Also many states such as Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina, Virginia, Wyoming, Ohio, Alabama, Arkansas, Washington provide by law a discount on workers compensation insurance rates provided a business qualifies as a Drug Free Workplace in accordance with state law.

States Which Provide Workers Compensation Discounts for Drug Free Workplace Programs

Alabama 5% Arkansas 5% Florida 5% Kentucky 5% Misissippi 5% Ohio 5% Tennessee 5% Virginia 5% Washington 5%

Accredited Drug Testing Inc will work with your insurance agent to ensure that any available discounts are provided for implementing and properly maintaining a drug free workplace.

Any company can benefit by being a Drug Free Workplace regardless of the number of employees, but it is crucially important that any business that wishes to be a Drug Free Workplace maintain the program properly.

A properly maintained Drug Free Workplace should include the following:

A written Drug Free Workplace Policy

Employee Drug Testing

Employee Education

Supervisor Training

Employee Assistance Program(EAP)

Drug Free Workplace Signage

Studies have shown that substance abuse among employees has serious repercussions for both the working environment and the economic success of the business.
