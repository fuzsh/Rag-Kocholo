        "text": "Last Updated on:\n\nLooking to start up a new home along the stunning California Central Coast? Look no further than Santa Barbara County, California, home to stunning weather, great agricultural land, and some of the finest wineries in the whole country. Whether you‚Äôre looking for excitement or a quiet life in wine country, each of the cities in Santa Barbara County has something to offer.\n\nMoving anywhere is a huge undertaking, and there‚Äôs always a ton of information you‚Äôll want to find out before you make the big decision. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve put together this article on everything you‚Äôll want to know about the county and the cities around Santa Barbara, including census-designated places.\n\nThe County of Santa Barbara\n\nThe history of Santa Barbara County can be traced back to settlements from the Paleo-Indian period 13,000 years ago. It was one of the original 27 California counties that were formed with California‚Äôs statehood in 1850, and today is California‚Äôs 20th biggest county in terms of population.\n\nThe Northern Channel Islands Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel are all part of Santa Barbara County too, along with Southern Channel Island Santa Barbara. The remaining four (Anacapa, San Nicolas, San Clemente, and Santa Catalina) are part of neighboring Ventura and Los Angeles Counties, respectively.\n\nWhere is Santa Barbara? Santa Barbara County can be found nestled along the California Central Coast, between San Luis Obispo and Ventura and right on the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThere are 8 cities in total that make up Santa Barbara County in addition to 18 census-designated places and an American Indian and Alaska Natives area (Santa Ynez Reservation). Santa Maria is the most populous city in Santa Barbara town, while Santa Barbara city owns the largest area. It‚Äôs also the county seat of Santa Barbara County, and lovingly promoted by locals as the ‚ÄúAmerican Riviera‚Äù.\n\nBetween the 2010 and 2020 censuses, Santa Barbara County has experienced a population increase of around 25,000 people, going from 423,895 residents in 2010 to 448,995 in 2020.\n\nSanta Barbara County, California Demographics\n\nPopulation: 448,229\n\nMedian Age: 39 years\n\nMedian household income: $74,624\n\nMedian price of housing $772,500\n\nArea: 163,696 sq mi\n\nDensity: 146 people per square mile\n\nEducational attainment: 80.9% high school grad or higher\n\nThe Santa Barbara County population is one of the 20th highest in the state of California, with Los Angeles County (population 10,014,009), San Diego County (population 3,298,634) and Orange County (population 3,186,989) the top 3.\n\n#1. Santa Maria\n\nSanta Maria population: 109,707\n\nPopulation growth: 6.99% between 2010 and 2020\n\nArea: 23.42 sq mi\n\nMedian age: 29.3 years\n\nSanta Maria median household income: $63,341\n\nSanta Maria median house price: $520,500\n\nEducational attainment: 60.2% high school grad or higher; 13.8% bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher\n\nSanta Maria, CA map\n\nSanta Maria the most populous of the Santa Barbara County cities, with the population continuing to grow steadily over the past 100 years. The most recent growth rate of 6.99% between 2010 and 2020 is by far the smallest increase yet, however.\n\nThere are a few things Santa Maria can be noted for, but perhaps most prominently, along with neighboring Los Alamos, Lompoc, and Santa Ynez Valleys, is its place right in the heart of the Santa Barbara Wine Country. This is one of the largest wine-producing regions in the whole country, with Santa Maria Valley grapes even making their way to wineries in other parts of the US!\n\nMake sure you check out our COMPLETE guide to living in Santa Maria to see what makes this Santa Barbara city so special.\n\n#2. Santa Barbara\n\nSanta Barbara population: 88,665\n\nPopulation growth: 0.02%\n\nArea: 42 sq mi\n\nMedian age: 39\n\nSanta Barbara median household income $76,606\n\nSanta Barbara median house price: $1,585,000\n\nEducational attainment: 85.9% high school grad or higher; 49.2% bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher\n\nSanta Barbara, CA map\n\nSanta Maria may be the most populous city in the Santa Barbara area, but Santa Barbara city is the county‚Äôs largest when it comes to land mass.\n\nIn the early days of the 20th Century, Santa Barbara was responsible for the world‚Äôs first ever offshore oil development, and oil still plays a huge part in the city‚Äôs economy to this day.\n\nSanta Barbara was also home to the largest movie studio of the silent era ‚Äî Flying A Studios. Around 1,200 pictures were made by the studio between 1910 and 1922, before they outgrew the area and moved down the coast to Hollywood. Around 100 of these films survive today.\n\nOne of the most popular things to do in Santa Barbara is the yearly Santa Barbara Fiesta, Old Spanish Days. The event kicks off every August, and is a huge celebration of Santa Barbara‚Äôs history, culture and heritage. It‚Äôs definitely not something to be missed!\n\nLearn even more about this gorgeous city with our guide to moving to Santa Barbara, CA!\n\n#3.

This is likely due to the city being next door to Isla Vista, home to UCSB ‚Äì the Santa Barbara campus of the University of California.\n\nUntil 2002, Goleta was Santa Barbara County‚Äôs largest unincorporated populated area, when it was then incorporated as a city. By the time the 2010 census rolled around, some 25,000 residents had left the city, seeing a 45.9% decrease in the population that bought it from 55,204 in 2000 to 29,888 in 2010.
