        "text": "The Neighbors\n\nHow wealthy a neighborhood is, from very wealthy, to middle income, to low income is very formative with regard to the personality and character of a neighborhood. Equally important is the rate of people, particularly children, who live below the federal poverty line. In some wealthy gated communities, the areas immediately surrounding can have high rates of childhood poverty, which indicates other social issues. NeighborhoodScout's analysis reveals both aspects of income and poverty for this neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors in the Downtown Lompoc neighborhood in Lompoc are lower-middle income, making it a below average income neighborhood. NeighborhoodScout's research shows that this neighborhood has an income lower than 61.4% of U.S. neighborhoods. With 24.6% of the children here below the federal poverty line, this neighborhood has a higher rate of childhood poverty than 75.1% of U.S. neighborhoods.\n\nA neighborhood is far different if it is dominated by enlisted military personnel rather than people who earn their living by farming. It is also different if most of the neighbors are clerical support or managers. What is wonderful is the sheer diversity of neighborhoods, allowing you to find the type that fits your lifestyle and aspirations.\n\nIn the Downtown Lompoc neighborhood, 37.9% of the working population is employed in manufacturing and laborer occupations. The second most important occupational group in this neighborhood is sales and service jobs, from major sales accounts, to working in fast food restaurants, with 35.5% of the residents employed. Other residents here are employed in clerical, assistant, and tech support occupations (12.9%), and 8.4% in farming, forestry, or commercial fishing.\n\nEthnicity / Ancestry\n\nCulture is the shared learned behavior of peoples. Undeniably, different ethnicities and ancestries have different cultural traditions, and as a result, neighborhoods with concentrations of residents of one or another ethnicities or ancestries will express those cultures. It is what makes the North End in Boston so fun to visit for the Italian restaurants, bakeries, culture, and charm, and similarly, why people enjoy visiting Chinatown in San Francisco.\n\nIn the Downtown Lompoc neighborhood in Lompoc, CA, residents most commonly identify their ethnicity or ancestry as Mexican (81.5%). There are also a number of people of English ancestry (3.0%), and residents who report Irish roots (2.0%), and some of the residents are also of Scottish ancestry (1.9%), along with some German ancestry residents (1.9%), among others. In addition, 32.2% of the residents of this neighborhood were born in another country.\n\nGetting to Work\n\nEven if your neighborhood is walkable, you may still have to drive to your place of work. Some neighborhoods are located where many can get to work in just a few minutes, while others are located such that most residents have a long and arduous commute. The greatest number of commuters in Downtown Lompoc neighborhood spend under 15 minutes commuting one-way to work (39.8% of working residents), one of the shortest commutes across America.\n\nHere most residents (68.6%) drive alone in a private automobile to get to work. In addition, quite a number also carpool with coworkers, friends, or neighbors to get to work (17.9%) and 7.0% of residents also ride the bus for their daily commute. In a neighborhood like this, as in most of the nation, many residents find owning a car useful for getting to work."
