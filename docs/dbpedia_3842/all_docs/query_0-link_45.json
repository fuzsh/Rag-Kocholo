        "text": "The urban population of the United States is now 249 million, according to the 2010 Census, 81 percent of the total. This is impressive, and not all surprising for a large developed economy. Yet the urban population --- meaning cities, suburbs and exurbs --- is not everything. And in many ways for everything from food, resources and recreation, the urban areas still depend on the nearly sixty million who live in rural America\n\nIt is fascinating to review how American demography has changed over the last decade. So I will briefly look at some obvious points, such as the largest, most important, places, those that grew the most absolutely and relatively, and those that, on the contrary, declined.\n\nOur Giant Metropolises\n\nThe Census is very generous, probably way too generous, in their defining the outer limits of our urbanized areas (agglomerations with over 50,000 people). They tend to respect the independence of historically separate places, which from a satellite view would appear to be part of a united larger agglomeration. For example, New York, as defined, is huge enough but dense settlement goes far beyond its census limits. (I’ll take a look at conurbations, like Megalopolis, in a separate discussion). The 30 giants are shown in Table 1. The top three, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago have kept their positions for decades, but story of more recent times has been the upsurge of Southern giants of Houston, Dallas, Miami, Atlanta, and of course, Washington, DC. Detroit is still in the top 15, but its position has fallen to 11th, while other historic places like Cleveland, St. Louis and Pittsburgh have dropped into the second set of 15.\n\nTable 1: Largest US Urbanized Areas Urbanized Area Name 2010 Population 2000 Population Change % Change 1 New York--Newark, NY--NJ--CT 18,351,295 17,799,861 551,434 3.10 2 Los Angeles--Long Beach--Anaheim, CA 12,150,996 11,789,487 361,509 3.07 3 Chicago, IL--IN 8,608,208 8,307,904 300,304 3.61 4 Miami, FL 5,502,379 4,919,036 583,343 11.86 5 Philadelphia, PA--NJ--DE--MD 5,441,567 5,149,079 292,488 5.68 6 Dallas--Fort Worth--Arlington, TX 5,121,892 4,145,659 976,233 23.55 7 Houston, TX 4,944,332 3,822,509 1,121,823 29.35 8 Washington, DC--VA--MD 4,586,770 3,933,920 652,850 16.60 9 Atlanta, GA 4,515,419 3,499,840 1,015,579 29.02 10 Boston, MA--NH--RI 4,181,019 4,032,484 148,535 3.68 11 Detroit, MI 3,734,090 3,903,377 -169,287 -4.34 12 Phoenix--Mesa, AZ 3,629,114 2,907,049 722,065 24.84 13 San Francisco--Oakland, CA 3,281,212 3,228,605 52,607 1.63 14 Seattle, WA 3,059,393 2,712,205 347,188 12.80 15 San Diego, CA 2,956,746 2,674,436 282,310 10.56 90,064,432 82,825,451 16 Minneapolis--St. Paul, MN--WI 2,650,890 2,388,593 262,297 10.98 17 Tampa--St. Petersburg, FL 2,441,770 2,062,339 379,431 18.40 18 Denver--Aurora, CO 2,374,203 1,984,889 389,314 19.61 19 Baltimore, MD 2,203,663 2,076,354 127,309 6.13 20 St. Louis, MO--IL 2,150,706 2,077,662 73,044 3.52 21 San Juan, PR 2,148,346 2,216,616 -68,270 -3.08 22 Riverside--San Bernardino, CA 1,932,666 1,506,816 425,850 28.26 23 Las Vegas--Henderson, NV 1,886,011 1,314,357 571,654 43.49 24 Portland, OR--WA 1,849,898 1,583,138 266,760 16.85 25 Cleveland, OH 1,780,673 1,786,647 -5,974 -0.33 26 San Antonio, TX 1,758,210 1,327,554 430,656 32.44 27 Pittsburgh, PA 1,733,853 1,753,136 -19,283 -1.10 28 Sacramento, CA 1,723,634 1,393,498 330,136 23.69 29 San Jose, CA 1,664,496 1,538,312 126,184 8.20 30 Cincinnati, OH--KY--IN 1,624,827 1,503,262 121,565 8.09 29,923,846 26,513,173\n\nCities with the Largest Gains\n\nUrbanized areas which gained the most population over the last decade are listed in Table 2. These numbers are truly large; these are clear leaders in “population power”. I’ll first draw our attention to the five cities which are in the top 35 in both absolute growth and in percent growth. These include Temecula-Murrieta, CA (most folks will never have even heard of it: think inland sunshine of Riverside county); Charlotte and Raleigh, NC; Cape Coral, FL (again, huh?); and Austin, TX (you were thinking Dallas or Houston? See below).\n\nTemecula-Murietta : 25th absolute growth, 6th % growth\n\nCharlotte : 9th and 19th\n\nRaleigh : 18th and 21st\n\nCape Coral : 30th and 27th\n\nAustin : 10th and 34th\n\nNorth Carolina wins the race for the fastest growing areas. But in sheer growth in people, the winners are (Table 2) Houston, Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Washington, Miami, Las Vegas (despite the recession), New York, Charlotte and Austin. Giant New York is the only non-sunbelt place in the elite, and it had a quite slow rate of growth (3%). The next places outside the southern tier are Denver (13th) and Seattle (18th). The total absolute growth in these top 15 cities was a phenomenal 7.24 million, a rate of growth of 8.7 %. For the top 30 urbanized areas, the growth was 10.3 million, with a percent growth of 9.7 – the same as the rate of growth of the nation. This includes slow growing but still very big places like Los Angeles (growth displaced to its satellites), Philadelphia, Chicago, Indianapolis, Portland and Minneapolis.\n\nTable 2: Largest Absolute Change in US Urbanized Areas Urbanized Area Name 2010 Population 2000 Population Change % Change 1 Houston, TX 4,944,332 3,822,509 1,121,823 29.35 2 Atlanta, GA 4,515,419 3,499,840 1,015,579 29.02 3 Dallas--Fort Worth--Arlington, TX 5,121,892 4,145,659 976,233 23.55 4 Phoenix--Mesa, AZ 3,629,114 2,907,049 722,065 24.84 5 Washington, DC--VA--MD 4,586,770 3,933,920 652,850 16.60 6 Miami, FL 5,502,379 4,919,036 583,343 11.86 7 Las Vegas--Henderson, NV 1,886,011 1,314,357 571,654 43.49 8 New York--Newark, NY--NJ--CT 18,351,295 17,799,861 551,434 3.10 9 Charlotte, NC--SC 1,249,442 758,927 490,515 64.63 10 Austin, TX 1,362,416 901,920 460,496 51.06 11 San Antonio, TX 1,758,210 1,327,554 430,656 32.44 12 Riverside--San Bernardino, CA 1,932,666 1,506,816 425,850 28.26 13 Denver--Aurora, CO 2,374,203 1,984,889 389,314 19.61 14 Tampa--St. Petersburg, FL 2,441,770 2,062,339 379,431 18.40 15 Los Angeles--Long Beach--Anaheim, CA 12,150,996 11,789,487 361,509 3.07 16 Orlando, FL 1,510,516 1,157,431 353,085 30.51 17 Seattle, WA 3,059,393 2,712,205 347,188 12.80 18 Raleigh, NC 884,891 541,527 343,364 63.41 19 Sacramento, CA 1,723,634 1,393,498 330,136 23.69 20 Chicago, IL--IN 8,608,208 8,307,904 300,304 3.61 21 Philadelphia, PA--NJ--DE--MD 5,441,567 5,149,079 292,488 5.68 22 San Diego, CA 2,956,746 2,674,436 282,310 10.56 23 Indianapolis, IN 1,487,483 1,218,919 268,564 22.03 24 Portland, OR--WA 1,849,898 1,583,138 266,760 16.85 25 Minneapolis--St. Paul, MN--WI 2,650,890 2,388,593 262,297 10.98 26 Columbus, OH 1,368,035 1,133,193 234,842 20.72 27 Nashville-Davidson, TN 969,587 749,935 219,652 29.29 28 Murrieta--Temecula--Menifee, CA 441,546 229,810 211,736 92.14 29 McAllen, TX 728,825 523,144 205,681 39.32 30 Cape Coral, FL 530,290 329,757 200,533 60.81\n\nRate of Population Growth\n\nThirty six cities had a growth rate of more than 50 percent between 2000 and 2010, a decade not that fabulous in economic growth!

With growth numbers and rates of 491000 (65%), 343000 (63%), and 460000 (51%)—clearly places on the move up.

What kinds of place lost population and why? See Table 4 for a list of larger absolute and percent losses. Despite the comeback of the automobile industry, Detroit experienced the greatest loss, arguably because much of the industry has moved to the non-union and lower wage South. New Orleans had the second biggest loss, with almost an 11 percent loss, recovering only gradually from hurricane Katrina. Partly race or perhaps more a legacy of poverty and inept governance? Other large numerical losses were in rust belt industrial and mining cities, such as Buffalo, Youngstown and Pittsburgh and Charleston, WV. At least one was quite different: Seaside-Monterey CA, with losses due to reduced military operations as well as a generally weak California economy.\n\nHigh rates of losses were mostly in the same places, but included several smaller industrial towns in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania.\n\nTable 4: Greatest Percent Losses and Greatest Absolute Losses Relative posses Urbanized Area Name 2010 Population 2000 Population Change % Change 1 Mansfield, OH 75,250 79,698 -4,448 -5.58 2 Lorain--Elyria, OH 180,956 193,586 -12,630 -6.52 3 Pascagoula, MS 50,428 54,190 -3,762 -6.94 4 Youngstown, OH--PA 387,550 417,437 -29,887 -7.16 5 Wheeling, WV--OH 81,249 87,613 -6,364 -7.26 6 Lompoc, CA 51,509 55,667 -4,158 -7.47 7 Mayagüez, PR 109,572 119,350 -9,778 -8.19 8 Hightstown, NJ 64,037 69,977 -5,940 -8.49 9 Pine Bluff, AR 53,495 58,584 -5,089 -8.69 10 Seaside--Monterey--Marina, CA 114,237 125,503 -11,266 -8.98 11 Anderson, IN 88,133 97,038 -8,905 -9.18 12 Johnstown, PA 69,014 76,113 -7,099 -9.33 13 Saginaw, MI 126,265 140,985 -14,720 -10.44 14 New Orleans, LA 899,703 1,009,283 -109,580 -10.86 15 Uniontown--Connellsville, PA 51,370 58,442 -7,072 -12.10 16 Yauco, PR 90,899 108,024 -17,125 -15.85 17 Charleston, WV 153,199 182,991 -29,792 -16.28 18 Lodi, CA 68,738 83,735 -14,997 -17.91 19 Parkersburg, WV--OH 67,229 85,605 -18,376 -21.47 20 Ponce, PR 149,539 195,037 -45,498 -23.33 Absolute Losses Urbanized Area Name 2010 Population 2000 Population Change % Change 1 Seaside--Monterey--Marina, CA 114,237 125,503 -11,266 -8.98 2 Lorain--Elyria, OH 180,956 193,586 -12,630 -6.52 3 Saginaw, MI 126,265 140,985 -14,720 -10.44 4 Lodi, CA 68,738 83,735 -14,997 -17.91 5 Yauco, PR 90,899 108,024 -17,125 -15.85 6 Parkersburg, WV--OH 67,229 85,605 -18,376 -21.47 7 Pittsburgh, PA 1,733,853 1,753,136 -19,283 -1.10 8 Charleston, WV 153,199 182,991 -29,792 -16.28 9 Youngstown, OH--PA 387,550 417,437 -29,887 -7.16 10 Buffalo, NY 935,906 976,703 -40,797 -4.18 11 Ponce, PR 149,539 195,037 -45,498 -23.33 12 San Juan, PR 2,148,346 2,216,616 -68,270 -3.08 13 New Orleans, LA 899,703 1,009,283 -109,580 -10.86 14 Detroit, MI 3,734,090 3,903,377 -169,287 -4.34\n\nThese statistics are also summarized in 5 maps – one showing the size and rate of growth of all urbanized areas, followed by maps of the largest 30 places, the 35 places with the highest absolute and highest relative growth, then a map of the largest absolute and percent losses.\n\nDensity, Size and Location\n\nPeople are often surprised by the fact that the highest urban densities are not in the historic eastern cities but in newer western cities. Los Angeles, often called the epitome of sprawl, is in fact the densest urbanized area in the US, for the third straight census! Table 5 lists the densest urbanized areas and the densities of the largest areas.\n\nTable 5: Highest and lowest urban densisties Highest urbanzed area densities Place State Population (Thousands) Density Los Angeles CA 12,151 6,999 San Francisco CA 3,281 6,266 San Jose CA 1,664 5,820 Delano CA 54 5,483 New York NY 18,351 5,319 Davis CA 73 5,157 Lompoc CA 52 4,816 Honolulu HI 802 4,716 Woodland CA 56 4,551 L:as Vegas NV 1,886 4,525 Densities of largest places (not on above list) Chicago IL 8,608 3,524 Miami FL 5,502 4,442 Philladelphia PA 5,442 2,746 Dallas TX 5,122 2,879 Houston TX 4,944 2,979 Washington DC DC 4,586 3,470 Atlanta GA 4,515 1,707 Boston MA 4,182 2,232 Detroit MI 3,734 2,793 Phoenix AZ 3,629 3,165 Seattle WA 3,059 3,028 Lowest density places Hickory NC 212 811 Hammond LA 68 883 Barnstable MA 247 890 Gadsden AL 64 892 Homosassa Spgs FL 81 895 Anniston AL 80 920 Los Lunas NM 64 921 Spartanburg SC 181 952 Hilton Head SC 69 1,020 Anderson SC 76 1,022\n\nThe remarkable story is that of the 10 densest areas, 9 are in the west, and 7 in the Golden State. Four of these are fairly small, another surprise. The only eastern city in the top 10 is New York, which is fairly sharply limited by the census. Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Jose are the three most densely settled areas. The main underlying reason is not just planning regulations, although these probably play a role, but the issue of providing water to developable land. Both are restricted. This is one reason why growth in the southwest tends to be relatively dense. These drier areas lack the local water supplies that enable the kind of low density sprawl typical of the historic eastern cities like, yes, Boston with a density of only 2231, less than one-third that of Los Angeles!! Other large urban areas with lower densities include Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Houston, Dallas and Atlanta, a mere 1707!\n\nThe winners for low density are an interesting mix of satellite places, such as Hammond, Barnstable, Los Lunas, and independent places like Hickory, Gadsden and Anniston, AL, and Spartanburg and Anderson, SC, many in hilly Appalachian environments, with settlement limited to valley floors. This is why the density could be below 1000 per square mile, the usual demarcation point of urban densities. Several are rather resort-like, e.g., Barnstable, Hilton Head and Homosassa Springs.\n\nEven if our urban definition is a little generous, 80 percent of the population or 250 million persons is an impressive total. Most of us cannot escape the city, where most jobs and opportunities are. We need to live in cities and perhaps most of us love the city. So the settlement issue in our lives becomes what city to live in and where to live within that place.\n\nRichard Morrill is Professor Emeritus of Geography and Environmental Studies, University of Washington.
