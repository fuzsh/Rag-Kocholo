        "text": "If Israelâs siege of Gaza after Hamas' terror attack gives way to a ground offensive and invasion, the more than 300,000 troops called into active duty will have to contend with a major obstacle in the hunt for Hamas fighters: the overcrowded Gaza Strip.\n\nThough small in size compared to Israel and the occupied West Bank, the Gaza Strip is densely packed, filled with urban areas and home to millions of people, including the Hamas fighters who know the area better.\n\nHereâs a look at the geography of one of the most densely populated places in the world.\n\nMovement into and out of the Gaza Strip is heavily controlled, as Israel and Egypt enforce a near complete land, sea and air blockade of the area since 2007. Nearly 40% of its population is under the age of 15, and the Gaza Strip has one of the highest birth rates in the world.\n\nThis means more and more children are being born into the same narrow space."
