        "text": "Looking for a quiet getaway? Leave the gridlock and 9 to 5 stress behind and travel to Lompoc, California. The city offers lots to do. From wine tasting to hillside hiking, you'll have a full itinerary as you enjoy all that this small city has to offer.\n\nNestled in a fertile valley, where scenic Highway 1 meets Route 246, just 155 miles northwest from Los Angeles, Lompoc entices visitors year-round with its mild Mediterranean climate, affordable hotel options, and variety of attractions and activities in the region.\n\nSpend the day at La Purisima Mission, an extensively restored California mission that dates back to 1787. During it heyday, the mission sprawled across 300,000 acres and was home to the Chumash people and Spanish settlers.\n\nToday, you can take a guided tour through several restored buildings and get a sense of what life was like back then. After a tour, spend some time hiking the 25 miles of trails; bring a lunch to enjoy the peace and quiet of the park.\n\nWhether you’re a wine connoisseur or just like a nice Pinot Noir from time to time, a stop to Lompoc’s Wine Ghetto is a must. Right off Pacific Coast Highway 1 and 12th Street you’ll find a collection of 20 wineries, tasting rooms and production facilities that are within walking distance of each other. Most of the Wine Ghetto tasting rooms are open Friday through Sunday, so plan accordingly. Nearby, in the Sta. Rita Hills, several local wineries and vineyards await, and are generally open 7 days a week for wine tasting and tours.\n\nOld Town Lompoc is known for its 30+ outdoor murals that decorate street corners, alleyways and buildings. Many of the murals represent a part of Lompoc’s history. These expansive murals have become quite a draw. Visitors are encouraged to take a self-guided mural tour of this outdoor art gallery and snap photos along the way.\n\nHop in the car for a country drive to Jalama Beach Park, located about 30 minutes from Lompoc. This quiet 23-acre beach is the perfect place to relax, fish, watch nature or stroll along the ocean. Plan to eat lunch or an early dinner at the famous Jalama Beach Grill, where the well-known Jalama Burger is the favored crowd-pleaser. Enjoy your burger with an ocean view.\n\nLompoc Valley is home to local flower growers with fields that stretch for acres and acres. Take a leisurely drive west of Old Town Lompoc to see vibrant patches of Delphinium or Queen Anne’s Lace. Several are located on Union Ave. While the flower fields are privately owned, you can snap some breath-taking photos from the side of the road. Generally fields are in bloom April thru September.\n\nPros and celebrities alike love La Purisima Golf Course for its challenging course, great design and untouched beauty. The 18-hole championship course -designed by world-renowned architect Robert Muir Graves – is full of rolling hills, giant oaks and valley vistas; there’s no commercial development in sight! It’s just you and the greens. Book a tee time to see it for yourself.\n\nForget kitschy tourist souvenirs and find some real gems to take home from your trip at one of the city’s antique and collectible shops. Vintage treasures, collectibles and artisan gifts can be found at T & T Sweet Repeats, and A Little Something Special and More, two popular locally owned co-ops in Old Town. For a mid-day pick me up, stop by South Side Coffee Co for a latte or mocha.\n\nGet your blood pumping at one of the city’s newest parks, River Bend Bike Park. This off-road bike park offers courses for every biker from the beginner to the more advanced. Bring your bikes – and your helmets, too. If street cycling is more your style, head to Santa Rosa Road for a wine country ambiance, or west of town to Ocean Beach Park & Estuary on the coast. Lompoc Valley is beautiful place to explore by bike, with rides and roads ranging from flat to hilly.\n\nGetting here is an easy – and lovely - hour drive north from Santa Barbara along Highway 1, Lompoc makes a great home base for your wine tasting weekend or mid-week escape on the California Central Coast.\n\nBut don’t take our word for it … Explore Lompoc, and Discover What’s Around the Bend"
