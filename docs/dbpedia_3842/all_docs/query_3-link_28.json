        "text": "About\n\nLompoc Valley Medical Center (LVMC), formerly known as Lompoc Healthcare District, is a healthcare district established in California and was created in 1946 by the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors.\n\nWhere We Come From\n\nIn 1945, the CA State Legislature enacted the \"Local Hospital Care District Law\" (California Health and Safety Code Sections 32000 et seq.) which authorized these districts to build and operate hospitals and other healthcare facilities in underserved areas and to recruit and support physicians. LVMC is subject to state policies and regulations as applied by each county. LVMC is governed by its five locally elected Board members who are answerable to the voters of the district.\n\nThe 463-square-mile district includes the city of Lompoc, Mission Hills, Mesa Oaks, Vandenberg Village, a portion of Vandenberg Space Force Base, and the area east toward Buellton.\n\nLVMC has always committed itself to improve and develop healthcare services throughout the Lompoc Valley. The healthcare needs of Lompoc's citizens have grown drastically over the years and LVMC has grown with it. Our facilities are regulated, inspected, and/or certified by a number of public and private agencies at the state and federal levels, including the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Licensing and Certification Program (L&C) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nLVMC is a founding member of The District Hospital Leadership Forum (DHLF) who represents California’s district and municipal hospital while providing expert leadership and advocacy in California and federal political realms.\n\nWhat We are About\n\nAs the Lompoc Valley’s primary provider of healthcare services since its inception, LVMC has long been committed to providing safe, high-quality, compassionate, and patient-centered healthcare services to our community in a non-discriminatory manner.\n\nIt is LVMC’s policy to make all decisions related to the provision of care, the employment of our staff, and the engagement of medical staff without regard to race, color, ancestry, religion, creed, national origin, physical disability, mental disability, medical/genetic condition, marital status, age military/veteran status, sex (including gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity).\n\nOur Core Values\n\nIntegrity – honesty and maintenance of strong moral principles\n\nRespect – acknowledging everyone’s abilities, qualities, and achievements\n\nTransparency – open and candid in all our activities\n\nExcellence – accepting nothing less than our very best\n\nCollaboration – working jointly and professionally in all our activities\n\nStewardship – responsible management of the resources entrusted to us\n\nOur Focus\n\nPatients. Excellence in healthcare starts with a foundation of inclusion, compassion, and respect for our patients and each other. We are committed to meeting the social, cultural, linguistic, and spiritual needs of our patients, their families, and the communities we serve. Our commitment to putting patients first means we recognize and affirm each individual's unique and intrinsic worth. This is the heart of equity of care.\n\nColleagues. LVMC is committed to ensuring equity from the inside out by strengthening our diversity and fostering a culture of inclusion. We recognize that each person has an area of expertise and that his or her contribution is critical to our success. Equity in this instance ensures fair and just treatment of and opportunities for coworkers."
