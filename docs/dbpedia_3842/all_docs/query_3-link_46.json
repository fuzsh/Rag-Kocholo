After the Spanish conquest of the area, Mission la Purisima was established in 1787. The original mission was destroyed in an earthquake in 1812 and rebuilt a few miles northeast.\n\nLike other cities in the region, Lompoc was part of a Mexican land grant.

Vandenberg Space Force Base is the city’s primary employer.\n\nReflecting on the beauty and experience, Lompoc offers, a local tourist website states,\n\n“Enjoy a scenic drive along country roads lined with vineyards and wildflowers that lead to the town of Lompoc. Hop aboard the Lompoc-Surf Amtrak train for a beautiful coastal ride into town. Or fly into the Santa Maria airport, just a short 30-minute drive away from downtown Lompoc.\n\nTake full advantage of the outdoors in this charming town, from the skies to the sea to land. Go skydiving for an unforgettable thrill experience where you’ll not only get your heart racing but also see incredible views of Santa Barbara County and the Channel Islands during the flight climb. Experienced surfers, get your thrills on Jalama’s renowned southeastern swells. And while you’re there, don’t miss your chance to grab a famous Jalama burger. As any local can tell you, there’s nothing better than feeding your appetite with a burger on the beach.”\n\nGeneral Pavement Management is proud to serve all of Lompoc, zip code 93436, and the surrounding areas!\n\nGive us a call today!"
