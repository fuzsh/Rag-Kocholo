        "text": "The Neighbors\n\nThere are two complementary measures for understanding the income of a neighborhood's residents: the average and the extremes. While a neighborhood may be relatively wealthy overall, it is equally important to understand the rate of people - particularly children - who are living at or below the federal poverty line, which is extremely low income. Some neighborhoods with a lower average income may actually have a lower childhood poverty rate than another with a higher average income, and this helps us understand the conditions and character of a neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors in the Lompoc North neighborhood in Lompoc are upper-middle income, making it an above average income neighborhood. NeighborhoodScout's exclusive analysis reveals that this neighborhood has a higher income than 66.6% of the neighborhoods in America. With 42.9% of the children here below the federal poverty line, this neighborhood has a higher rate of childhood poverty than 90.8% of U.S. neighborhoods.\n\nWhat we choose to do for a living reflects who we are. Each neighborhood has a different mix of occupations represented, and together these tell you about the neighborhood and help you understand if this neighborhood may fit your lifestyle.\n\nIn the Lompoc North neighborhood, 34.7% of the working population is employed in sales and service jobs, from major sales accounts, to working in fast food restaurants. The second most important occupational group in this neighborhood is executive, management, and professional occupations, with 29.3% of the residents employed. Other residents here are employed in clerical, assistant, and tech support occupations (20.1%), and 15.5% in manufacturing and laborer occupations.\n\nEthnicity / Ancestry\n\nBoston's Beacon Hill blue-blood streets, Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish enclaves, Los Angeles' Persian neighborhoods. Each has its own culture derived primarily from the ancestries and culture of the residents who call these neighborhoods home. Likewise, each neighborhood in America has its own culture – some more unique than others – based on lifestyle, occupations, the types of households – and importantly – on the ethnicities and ancestries of the people who live in the neighborhood. Understanding where people came from, who their grandparents or great-grandparents were, can help you understand how a neighborhood is today.\n\nIn the Lompoc North neighborhood in Lompoc, CA, residents most commonly identify their ethnicity or ancestry as Mexican (44.8%). There are also a number of people of English ancestry (7.7%), and residents who report German roots (6.3%), and some of the residents are also of Asian ancestry (5.4%), along with some Irish ancestry residents (5.1%), among others. In addition, 18.6% of the residents of this neighborhood were born in another country.\n\nGetting to Work\n\nEven if your neighborhood is walkable, you may still have to drive to your place of work. Some neighborhoods are located where many can get to work in just a few minutes, while others are located such that most residents have a long and arduous commute. The greatest number of commuters in Lompoc North neighborhood spend under 15 minutes commuting one-way to work (38.6% of working residents), one of the shortest commutes across America.\n\nHere most residents (71.9%) drive alone in a private automobile to get to work. In addition, quite a number also ride the bus to get to work (10.3%) and 8.6% of residents also carpool with coworkers, friends, or neighbors for their daily commute. In a neighborhood like this, as in most of the nation, many residents find owning a car useful for getting to work."
