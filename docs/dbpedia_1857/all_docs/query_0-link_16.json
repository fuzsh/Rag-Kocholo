It made international headlines on 6 April 1964, when it rammed the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge, causing two spans of it to collapse.[4]\n\nQuick Facts History, Venezuela ...\n\nHistory Venezuela Name\n\nEsso Maracaibo (1959–1976)\n\nLagoven Maracaibo (1976–1985)\n\nOwner\n\nCreole Petroleum Corp (1959–1976)\n\nLagoven S.A.

This was less than her maximum capacity of 296,000 barrels (47,100 m3), because the outer bar of the Lake Maracaibo channel only had a depth of 33.5 feet (10.2 m), before being dredged, while Esso Maracaibo had a summer draft of 36 feet (11 m), fully loaded.[1] In later years, the four big tankers of the Creole Petroleum Corporation moved 160,600,000 barrels (25,530,000 m3) of crude and other oil products to refineries on Aruba in a year.[11]\n\nOn 6 April 1964 Esso Maracaibo, carrying 236,000 barrels (37,500 m3) of crude oil, was on her way through the outlet of Lake Maracaibo when she lost her steering because of an electrical malfunction.[4] Unable to navigate, the ship first hit pier 31 of the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge and then also crushed pier 32. This led to the collapse of a 259-metre (849 ft 9 in) long section of the bridge. Four cars fell to the sea, resulting in seven deaths.[lower-alpha 1] Parts of the bridge came down on the bow of the tanker, short of the superstructure, and oil leaked out, but the ship stayed afloat. Nobody of the 42 crew members was injured.[3]\n\nDuring repairs, an additional section was added to Esso Maracaibo, bringing her length to 212.2 metres (696 ft 2 in) (203 m (666 ft) at the waterline) and increasing capacity to 40,925 DWT[10][7] (Fairplay magazine reported in 1985 27,695 GRT and 41,582 DWT).[12] She continued to transport crude for the Creole Petroleum Corporation, with a break in 1973, when she was in drydock and Greek tanker Dorias (94,000 DWT, 846 feet (258 m)) substituted for her.[13] In 1976, after Venezuela had nationalized the Venezuelan branch of the company, she was renamed Lagoven Maracaibo, but otherwise kept her service routine. In 1985, she was decommissioned, together with Dorias towed to Taiwan, and scrapped there.[14]"
