Undoubtedly Titanic was one of the most famous ships which met with quite a memorable trouble on its first journey. There are many other giant ships of which most of us are not aware. Here we have brought a list of top 10 biggest ships ever built in history.

Because of her gigantic proportions the usability of the Pierre Guillaumat was very limited. She couldn’t pass through either the Panama or Suez canals. Because of her draft, she could enter a minimal number of ports in the world, and was therefore moored on offshore rigs, and oil terminals like Antifer and after off-loading to reduce her draft, at Europoort.

However the wreckage was salvaged and repaired. After the repairs she was back in service as Happy Giant.\n\nThe vessel was sold to Indian ship breakers, and renamed Mont for her final journey in December 2009.
