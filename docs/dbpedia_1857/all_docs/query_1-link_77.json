        "text": "Dixie Arrow in dry-dock  U.S. Coast Guard photo from the collection of Mike McKay\n\nU-71's first torpedo struck the Dixie Arrow at the pilot house\n\nChaos reigned as oil poured from the ruptured bunkers turning the ship and the surrounding waters into a hellstorm of thick smoke and flames. Assisted by the wind, the flames raced from the bridge to the forecastle/bow, where a group of men were trapped with no alternatives but to be burned alive on the ship or jump from the moving ship and into the flaming sea. Fortunately able-bodied seaman, Oscar G. Chappell was severely injured but still alive and at his station in the wheelhouse. Chappell turned the ship hard to starboard and held the tanker into the wind driving the waterborne flames away from the trapped men on the bow, allowing them to jump clear of the sea of burning oil. The flames however came directly back on Chappell and the wheelhouse where he was soon engulfed in flames. His quick actions and sacrifice saved his shipmates. Chappell was posthumously awarded the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal for his actions and a liberty ship, the SS Oscar G. Chappell, was later named in his honor. Today, the Navy League annually awards the THE ABLE SEAMAN OSCAR CHAPPELL AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING MARITIME STEWARDSHIP to recognize \"selfless dedication to shipmates\".\n\nDixie Arrow (2/11/1942)  U.S. Coast Guard photo from the collection of Mike McKay\n\nThe President of the United States takes Pleasure in Presenting the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal to\n\nOscar Chappell*\n\nAble Seaman on SS Dixie Arrow 3/26/42\n\nFor heroism beyond the line of duty.\n\nHis ship, carrying a full cargo of crude oil, was torpedoed three times within one minute. The first torpedo struck directly below the forward deckhouse, and the other two slightly abaft this point causing the ship to buckle amidship. The explosions immediately ignited the combustible cargo; all amidship and astern sections of the ship were enveloped in flames, and the fire rapidly spread over the ocean surrounding the ship. Injured by the explosions, with blood covering his head and shoulders, Chappell stuck to his post at the helm though the wheelhouse was in flames. He saw seven of his shipmates trapped on the forecastle head. Driven by the wind, the fire was sweeping toward them over the deck, and all escape was cut off by water-borne flames surrounding the bow. Fully aware of his own desperate situation, Chappell put the helm hard right and held the ship into the wind deflecting the flames upon himself, but enabling his shipmates to jump overboard clear of the blazing sea of oil. Placing his own safety beyond all consideration, his last thought and act was to assure the survival of his imperiled shipmates.\n\nHis magnificent courage and selfless disregard of his own life constitute a degree of heroism which will be an enduring inspiration to seamen of the United States Merchant Marine everywhere.\n\nFor the President\n\nAdmiral Emory Scott Land Merchant Marine distinguished Service Medal and citation for Oscar Chappell (1)\n\nDixie Arrow (3/27/1942)  U.S. Coast Guard photo from the collection of Mike McKay\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the crew were trying their best to escape the burning ship. The #1 and #2 lifeboats were destroyed during the explosions and boat #3 was lost during the launch as the tanker was still underway. The fourth boat was cut away and successfully launched carrying 8 men to safety. This boat was unable to safely return to the ship to rescue the remaining shipmates who eventually escaped on a liferaft. In all 22 men were rescued and 11 were killed. No distress signal had been sent  the radioman was killed by the first torpedo, but the burning ship was soon spotted by the destroyer USS Tarbell (DD-142) which came to investigate. The Tarbell dropped lifeboats for the men in the water and proceeded to circle the tanker in search of the U-71. After a few unproductive depth charge attacks which did more harm to the Arrow crew in the water than the u-boat, the Tarbell came back to pick up the 22 survivors. They were taken to Morehead City, NC.\n\nThe U-71 escaped and was one of the few u-boats to survive until the end of the war. It was scuttled at Wihelmshaven on May 2, 1945.\n\nThe Dixie Arrow continued to burn and drift thru the next day. It was found inshore, near the Cape Hatteras minefields, with only its 3 masts sticking up from the ocean bottom. The buoy tender Orchid (WAGL-240) was sent out to the wreck and she placed a red buoy at the site as an aid to navigation. For the next year, the masts and wreck site were used for target practice by planes from the Cherry Point, NC Marine Air Station. The masts were gone by 1943 and the rest of the wreck was wire-dragged and demolished to a least depth of 43 feet in 1944.\n\nAfter drifting for several days, the Dixie Arrow was found with only her masts showing thru the surface. She was marked as a navigation hazard and later used for bombing practice.\n\nThe Dixie Arrow as she appeared on the bottom soon after sinking.\n\nDixie Arrow burning (Hoyt) U-71 being strafed on the surface a couple of months after sinking Dixie Arrow (Hoyt) DIVING NOTES: Diving Depths: 70-90 ft. Current: Slight to undiveable. The prevailing current direction seems to be across and down the wreck from the starboard/stern direction. Visibility: Usually good to outstanding; 40 ft to 100+ ft. Summer Temperature: mid to high 70s Points of Interest: Boilers, large engine, rudder, propeller; intact bow and foward tank sections Fish/Animal Life: Huge southern stingrays and cobia are common as are loggerhead turtles; barracuda, amberjack, spadefish; there also seems to be several large sandtigers cruising the higher profile sections and outside ends of the wreck Description: The Dixie Arrow is large wreck which lies on it keel. The wreck is contiguous from bow to stern. The stern/engine area is the most interesting, full huge, distinct features, while the bow and forwa rd tank area offers the most relief. The midsection is relatively flat and featureless. At times, the current can be quite stiff, making the trip up or back to the stern quite a swim. In bad viz, the wide, flat, section between the bow and the stern can be confusing if you wander away from the edges. As with most wrecks, the high points on the wreck seem to focus the marine life. The engine and boilers are a great place to ride the current coming across the wreck and wait for marine life to cruise by  it almost never fails. I have seen turtles, sharks, and sting rays swim by at the same time. The Dixie Arrow is one of those fall back wrecks out of Hatteras  if you can't get out to the shoals or the wrecks farther south, you can almost always get to the Arrow. Because of its generally good conditions, abundance of marine life and size, it can hold up to numerous visits and divers."
