This change complies with Wärtsilä’s strategy of being the majority owner in its global sales and service network companies.\n\nWärtsilä and Hitachi Zosen established Wärtsilä Diesel Japan Co Ltd in 1997 to manufacture Wärtsilä 20 and 32 engines and to sell both these and other Wärtsilä engines in the Japanese market.\n\nWärtsilä and Hitachi Zosen’s subsidiary Imex will continue to collaborate in gen set assembly. Mr Koji Ichikawa has been appointed President and Mr Akira Kanazawa Executive Vice President of the company.\n\nWärtsilä has another company in Japan, NSD Japan Ltd, which supports license manufacturing of the Group’s Sulzer engines. It is planned to merge Wärtsilä Diesel Japan and NSD Japan. The new company resulting from the merger will be called Wärtsilä Japan Co Ltd., with about 30 people.\n\nJapan is one of the biggest shipbuilding countries in the world and an important marine market for Wärtsilä. In the power plant business Wärtsilä has made openings in the market.\n\nWärtsilä Corporation is the leading global ship power supplier and a major provider of solutions for decentralized power generation and of supporting services.\n\nThe net sales of the Group in 2000 were EUR 2.7 billion and number of employees worldwide is 10,500."
