        "text": "In 1855, at the age of sixteen years, the American John D. Rockefeller moved into an office of commission brokers in Cleveland, Ohio, and soon after became a partner in his own firm, Clark & Rockefeller. In 1859, oil was discovered in Pennsylvania and the visionary Rockefeller took an early interest in these developments, travelling to Pennsylvania to see for himself what this new industry might have to offer. Although the industry was highly unstable in these early days, Rockefeller saw the great potential of oil. In 1863, in partnership with a British engineer named Samuel Andrews, Rockefeller invested $4,000 in the construction of a refinery in Cleveland, Ohio, and took the first steps to becoming one of the richest men in the world. Within two years, Rockefeller bought out his partner (Clark) and the firm became known as Rockefeller & Andrews. By 1870 the business had expanded rapidly and in June of that year all their interests were incorporated as the Standard Oil Company (Ohio). The business continued to grow rapidly and on 27 April 1888 acquired their first foreign affiliate which was named the Anglo-American Oil Company, destined to become one of the largest companies in Great Britain involved in the bulk transportation of oil products. The Company opened offices at 16 Great St. Helens, London, later moving to Dock House, Billiter Street, and later 22 Billiter Street.\n\nThe first ships of the Anglo-American Oil Company were both Clyde-built. The first was the 1889-built BAYONNE, from the yard of A. & J. Inglis Ltd., and the second was the 1889-built MANHATTAN, from the yard of D. J. Dunlop & Coy., each with a carrying capacity of 4,000 tons, equivalent to about 28,000 barrels of oil per vessel, arranged in nine pairs of tanks that could be pumped out in ten hours using the two ship’s own cargo pumps. These were followed over the next few years by the steamers WEEHAUKEN (1891- Armstrong Mitchell & Coy), DELAWARE (1893 – D. J. Dunlop), POTOMAC (1893 – A. & J. Inglis Ltd) LACKAWANNA (1894 – D. J. Dunlop & Coy) CHESAPEAKE (1895 – D. J. Dunlop & Coy)\n\nTo accommodate the growing fleet, Anglo-American Oil constructed the large storage wharf at Purfleet on the Thames from where smaller vessels transhipped the commodity to various ports around the British Isles and Dublin, Ireland. By the turn of the century, the ships were increasing in size, up to 8,400 DWT. In 1903 the Company took delivery of its largest ship until then, the 9,196 GRT NARRAGANSETT, at that time the largest oil tanker in the world and the largest vessel to be built in the lower reaches of the Clyde, from the Yard of Scott & Coy of Greenock. And you can also give your business a new address if you’d like using a service like this Virtual office in Bristol so that way you get a top Bristol address and added privacy for your business.\n\nOIL CARRIERS OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN OIL COMPANY OF LONDON : 1889-1914\n\nPurfleet oil terminal expanded over the years to become the largest unloading and storage depot in Great Britain, and remained in operation day and night throughout the First World War, by the end of which there were fifty-eight large storage tanks at the Site. Previously the facility had been in the ownership of the Purfleet Tank Storage Company but it was absorbed into the Anglo-American Oil Company who also went on to acquire the adjacent oil plant that had been owned by the Anglo-Russian Oil Company.\n\nThe Company’s fleet of oil carriers flew the Anglo-American houseflag portraying a black eagle astride a white ball, with navy blue and deep red diagonal sections as its background colours. During the Great War of 1914-1918, many of the Company’s vessels were taken over by the Government for war duties and during this war the Purfleet facility received the unwelcome attention of German Gotha bombers and Zeppelins, but no serious damage was sustained. The facility was enlarged again in 1938, to provide further storage capacity in preparation for the war that was foreseen as inevitable.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Purfleet terminal did not escape as lightly from enemy attention as was the case in the previous War. Twenty direct hits were recorded in 1940 and further hits during 1941 caused much devastation and destruction. Ships alongside were hit and caught fire, ashore there were many fires and resulting explosions, some of these fires burning for over a week. Inevitably some lives were lost during this difficult time.\n\nCOASTERS/RIVER CRAFT OF ANGLO-AMERICAN OIL COMPANY OF LONDON : 1856-1912\n\nVESSEL NAMES\n\nG.R.T.\n\nBUILDER IDENTITY\n\nL X B\n\nPROPULSION TYPE\n\nULTIMATE FATE\n\nOsceola\n\n393\n\nD.

Lines, a company involved in shipping since 1844, but also owning properties and oilfields in Mexico. The new British company was called A.G.W.I. Petroleum Corporation Limited and was incorporated in 1920. On its formation, the Company acquired 406 acres in Hampshire that was to become the new Fawley refinery and oil storage depot. The first of the Company’s vessels, the newly built S.S. Agwilake, landed the first oil at Fawley on 18 June 1921, discharging 1,398 tons of Mexican crude oil, 5,843 tons of fuel oil and 2,677 tons of gas oil. In 1921 the facility had storage capacity of 99,000 tons. In 1923, A.G.W.I. Petroleum Corporation was taken over by the British Mexican Petroleum Company. In 1925 the Anglo-American Oil Company acquired the British Mexican Petroleum Company and its fleet of eight oil tankers of 10,000 DWT.\n\nOCEAN TANKERS OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN OIL COMPANY IN THE 1920’s\n\nVESSEL NAME\n\nBUILT\n\nACQUIRED\n\nGRT\n\nPROPULSION\n\nULTIMATE FATE\n\nStrathearn\n\n1906\n\n1920\n\n4,419\n\nT/E Steam Recip.

From 1947, with the formation of the Esso Transportation Company Limited, formed by renaming the Lago Shipping Company Limited, a new funnel emblem was introduced in place of the red black-topped Anglo-American funnel. It took the form of the ESSO oval on a white band on a black funnel. The ‘oval’, edged in blue, had the word ‘Esso’ in red. Gradually the vessels from this time were renamed with the Esso prefix.\n\nVESSEL NAME\n\nYEAR\n\nGRT\n\nBUILDER NAME\n\nSUBSEQUENT NAMES\n\nULTIMATE FATE\n\nRobert E. Hand\n\n1933\n\n12,197\n\nFr.

In 1951, with the new refinery at Fawley about to begin production, the Anglo-American Oil Company became a major producer of petroleum products and its whole scope of activities changed. The transportation aspect also greatly increased at this time with increased distribution and requirements to feed the new refinery. Consequently it was decided to re-assume control of the tanker fleet and set up a Marine Department to take responsibility for the management and operation of the fleet, maintenance and repairs of the ships, new construction, and the chartering of vessels. With these changes came a change of Company name, from the Anglo-American Oil Company to the Esso Petroleum Company Limited. In a similar manner, the parent Company in the USA, the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), had been transferred to a new subsidiary Company in 1950, the Esso Shipping Company.\n\nCOASTAL, CANAL AND RIVER VESSELS IN THE 1950’s – 1960’s\n\nVESSEL NAME\n\nYEAR\n\nGRT\n\nBUILDER\n\nPROPULSION\n\nULTIMATE FATE\n\nEsso Abingdon\n\n1952\n\n446\n\nHenry Scarr Ltd Oil Engine B/U Kent in 1975 Esso Poole\n\n1955\n\n754\n\nHenry Scarr Ltd Oil Engine B/U Haulbowline in 1984 Esso Preston\n\n1956\n\n1,965\n\nHall, Russell & Coy T/E 3-Cyl Steam Recip B/U Aviles in 1975 Esso Brixham\n\n1957\n\n758\n\nPhilip & Son Ltd Oil Engine B/U Middlesbrough in 1980 Esso Tilbury\n\n1957\n\n15\n\nThames Launch Oil Engine Not Known (Tugboat) Esso Woolston\n\n1958\n\n856\n\nHenry Scarr Ltd Oil Engine B/U Santander in 1985 Esso Lyndhurst\n\n1958\n\n856\n\nHenry Scarr Ltd Oil Engine Sold in 1981 to Saudi Arabia Esso Hythe\n\n1959\n\n856\n\nHenry Scarr Ltd Oil Engine Sold in 1981 to Lebanon Esso Leeds\n\n1956\n\n170\n\nR.

Four of these vessels were transferred from the Panamanian flag to the British flag and Esso Petroleum Company in 1956. These were trunk-decked twin-screw triple expansion engine vessels of 5,500 DWT and on arrival in UK waters from Venezuela they were fitted out for UK coastal service by Brigham & Cowan Limited and Palmers of Hebburn. Their primary purpose was the carriage of oil between Fawley Refinery and the various power stations of the CEGB.

Subsequently refloated, she discharged her cargo at Purfleet then proceeded to Gravesend to undergo repairs. On 12 October 1965, whilst this work was in progress, there was a massive explosion on board and subsequent drydocking at Tilbury indicated that the vessel could not be economically repaired. In December of that year, she was delivered to Grays of Essex for scrapping.\n\nThe histories of the other six Maracaibo tankers are varied – as shown in the Table below :\n\nVESSEL NAMES\n\nYEAR\n\nRE-NAMED\n\nBUILDER\n\nULTIMATE FATE\n\nSan Joaquin\n\n1943\n\nEsso Joaquin Barnes-Duluth Sank in the Gulf of Campeche in January 1960 San Cristobal\n\n1943\n\nEsso San Cristobal Barnes-Duluth Broke in two, off Colon, in December 1968 Temblador\n\n1943\n\nNo name change Barnes-Duluth To Canadian owners in 1960 : Barge in 1978 Guiria\n\n1943\n\nEsso Guiria Barnes-Duluth Arrived Hamburg for scrapping – October 1961 Valera\n\n1943\n\nNo name change Barnes-Duluth Sunk in Caribbean, by U-518, in March 1944 Mara\n\n1945\n\nEsso Mara Bethlehem Arrived Valencia for scrapping – February 1965\n\nTHE ‘OXFORD’ CLASS OF 1953 – 1955\n\nA class of handy-sized tankers brought out in the early 1950’s. Constructed to a specially adapted American design of all-welded construction and thirty cargo tanks. With a crude oil capacity of 26,700 tons, a feature of that time was the unusually high rate of discharge at around 3,000 tons per hour. Two steam turbines geared to a single shaft provided a speed on about 17 knots. The vessels were 630 feet in length and breadth was 83 feet. GRT was about 17,500 tons.\n\nVESSEL NAME\n\nYEAR\n\nGRT\n\nBUILDER\n\nDISPOSAL\n\nULTIMATE FATE\n\nEsso Oxford\n\n1953\n\n17,539\n\nCammell Laird & Co Sold in 1972 B/U at Castellton in 1974 Esso Cambridge\n\n1954\n\n17,551\n\nCammell Laird & Co Sold in 1968 B/U at Piraeus in 1976 Esso Westminster\n\n1954\n\n17,554\n\nVickers-Armstrongs Sold in 1972 B/U at Santander in 1975 Esso Canterbury\n\n1954\n\n17,543\n\nVickers-Armstrongs Sold in 1968 Sank following an explosion in 1972 Esso York\n\n1955\n\n17,570\n\nVickers-Armstrongs Lighter 1969 B/U at Bombay in 1981 Esso Exeter\n\n1955\n\n17,554\n\nVickers-Armstrongs Sold in 1968 B/U at Kaohsiung in 1982\n\nThe 1954-built Esso Cambridge of the Esso Petroleum Company was one of the first oil tankers affected by the Suez crisis of 1956. At 21:30 hours on 31st October 1956 the Esso Cambridge was in a position 110 miles East of Gibraltar bound for Mena Al Ahmadi in the Persian Gulf via the Suez Canal, to load crude oil for the refinery at Fawley. A radio message came through to the Master from Esso instructing the vessel to proceed to the Gulf via the Cape of Good Hope calling in Cape Town for bunkers due to the expiry of the Anglo-French ultimatum to Egypt earlier that day without result. The impact of the non-navigable Suez Canal for over five months, until early April 1957, had a profound effect on the marine operations of Esso and all other oil majors.\n\nTHE ‘CITY’ CLASS OF 1957 – 1960\n\nThere were twelve vessels of this class built between 1957 and 1960. These vessels were of around 36,000 TDW and propulsion was by means of two steam turbines geared to a single shaft, providing a speed of around 16.5 knots. The vessels had an overall length of 696 feet and breadth of 90 feet. The vessels details are shown in the Table below :\n\nVESSEL NAME\n\nYEAR\n\nGRT\n\nBUILDER\n\nDISPOSAL\n\nULTIMATE FATE\n\nEsso Guildford\n\n1957\n\n23,960\n\nAG Weser of Bremen Sold in 1969 B/U Bilbao in 1976 Esso Winchester\n\n1958\n\n24,026\n\nAG Weser of Bremen Sold in 1969 B/U Kaohsiung in 1979 Esso Salisbury\n\n1957\n\n24,008\n\nHowaldtswerke AG Sold in 1972 B/U Kaohsiung in 1975 Esso Bristol\n\n1958\n\n23,972\n\nHowaldtswerke AG Esso Nicaragua in 1964 B/U Kaohsiung in 1977 Esso Norwich\n\n1959\n\n23,997\n\nArsenal de Brest Esso Balboa in 1962 B/U Kaohsiung in 1975 Esso Durham\n\n1958\n\n23,862\n\nVickers-Armstrongs Sold in 1967 B/U Kaohsiung in 1975 Esso Portsmouth\n\n1959\n\n24,125\n\nVickers-Armstrongs Sold in 1972 Foundered August 1975 Esso Southampton\n\n1958\n\n23,457\n\nCantieri Riuniti d’Ad Esso Jamaica in 1962 B/U Kaohsiung in 1977 Esso Coventry\n\n1959\n\n23,275\n\nCantieri Riuniti d’Ad Esso Trieste in 1963 B/U Masan in 1975 Esso Windsor\n\n1958\n\n23,581\n\nCantieri Riuniti d’Ad Esso Genova in 1963 B/U Kaohsiung in 1978 Esso Liverpool\n\n1959\n\n23,720\n\nCantieri Riuniti d’Ad Esso El Salvador in 1964 B/U Kaohsiung in 1977 Esso Dublin\n\n1960\n\n21,627\n\nCantieri Riuniti d’Ad Esso Honduras in 1964 B/U Kaohsiung in 1976\n\nThe Esso Portsmouth and Esso Durham both suffered major damage, in July 1960 and January 1961 respectively, due to serious explosions and fire. Both ships were subsequently salvaged and new mid-sections pieced in, together with other major modifications including modernisation to accommodation. The Esso Portsmouth, with an additional 4,000 tons of steel increasing her size to 40,300 DWT and length to 733 feet, was later sold to Winson Tankers Limited of Panama in 1972. On a voyage from Galveston to India in January 1975, carrying wheat, the vessel went aground on North Danger Reef in the South China Sea, remaining there until refloated on 6th August 1975. However, two days later she foundered in heavy weather whilst under tow.\n\nTHE ‘ESSO FAWLEY’ CLASS OF 1967 / 1968\n\nWhen built in Sweden, the ‘Esso Fawley’ class at just over 18,000 TDW were the largest vessels in Esso’s coastal fleet and were designed for distributing refined products from the Fawley and Milford Haven refineries. They became frequent users of the Dingle tanker buoy berth in the River Mersey, completed in August 1967, and connected to the onshore Dingle Bank Oil Storage Facility adjacent to the Herculaneum Branch Dock, where importation of oil first began in 1892. Two oil engines, geared to a single controllable-pitch propeller, giving the vessels a speed of 16.25 knots powered these ships. (A third vessel of the same class, the Esso Slagen, was completed by A/B Lindholmens, in October of 1968, for Esso Norske of Oslo).\n\nVESSEL NAME\n\nBUILT\n\nGRT\n\nBUILDERS NAME\n\nULTIMATE FATE Esso Fawley\n\nSep 1967\n\n11,064\n\nA/B Lindholmens Varv\n\nRenamed Petro Fawleyin 1994 Esso Milford Haven\n\nJan 1968\n\n10,902\n\nA/B Lindholmens Varv\n\nRenamed Petro Milford Havenin 1994\n\nCOASTAL SHIPS OF THE 1960’s\n\nVESSEL NAME\n\nBUILT\n\nGRT\n\nBUILDERS NAME\n\nPROPULSION\n\nULTIMATE FATE\n\nEsso Tynemouth\n\nFeb 1960\n\n525\n\nJ.

Sold to USA 1986.\n\nIn late 1972, the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) changed its name to the Exxon Corporation. One of the main reasons for the name change was the long-standing confusion there had been between Standard Oil (New Jersey) and other competing companies in the USA that used the ‘Standard Oil’ name. The decision to change came about following a court ruling that the Esso trademark could not be used nationwide.\n\nThe change in title was initially intended for use as a primary trademark in the United Staes only. Thus, it only affected the existing names on 26,000 petrol station outlets and countless road tankers of the domestic Humble Oil and Refining Company and the names of the ships of the Humble Transportation Company of Houston, Texas, which flew the flag of the USA and were registered in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nThe name of the Humble Transportation Company became the Exxon Transportation Company, Houston, and from around mid-1973 all the ships of the Company were renamed with the prefix ‘Exxon’ to their place names.\n\nAlthough the name ‘Esso’ offered no such problems to international affiliates, the new name, ‘Exxon’, was registered in virtually every country in the world where trademark registration is available in order to protect its possible future use worldwide. In May 1983, all ships of the Exxon Transportation Company were transferred to Exxon Shipping Company of Houston.\n\nAngus MacKinnon (deceased)"
