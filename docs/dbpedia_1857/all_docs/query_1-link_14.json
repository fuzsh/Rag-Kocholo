        "text": "To leave the United States again, here are some more three islanders:\n\nFrom the last post, B.A. Peerless (later Gulf Canada) had a fleet mate that ran from Venezuela to Montreal or Portland, ME with crude oil. B.A. Canada was built in 1953 by Uraga Dock in Yokosuka, Japan, 13,173 grt, 20, 949 dwt. According to one reader, when the ships met on the St.Lawrence, there was great saluting, both with whistles and flags, and it was a major event aboard both ships.\n\nAlmost the same size as its Canadian counterpart, B.A. Canada flew the Liberian flag except for a brief spell late in 1969 when it went to the British flag, then was sold to Liberian Oceanways Corp and went back under the Liberian flag, but with the very Greek sounding name Dimitrios D.M.\n\nThe old B/A logo is still visible on the bow, the hull is still grey, but the name has been plated over.\n\nOn August 30, 1975 it was stranded in the Panama Canal (details are sparse on what happened) on a voyage from Tampico to Manzanillo, MX. Damage was apparently fairly serious, because it was laid up in Jacksonville October 14, 1976, then on February 24, 1976 it was sold to ship breakers in Panama City, FL, where it was broken up starting March 10, 1976.\n\nMeanwhile, the USSR was turning out similar looking, but smaller tankers. The Liepaya class of 7.949 grt, 11,890 dwt, built from 1959 and 1960, were used as military suppliers, but also accompanied the USSR fishing fleet off eastern Canada, both for fueling and to supply fresh water for processing. The latter they picked up in Halifax, and Essentuki was a typical member of the class.\n\nSeen here at pier 20 after loading water, the ship had several un-tanker-like characteristics, including deadlights in the forecastle, guard rails along the deck, a rather sleek hull shape and some extra communications equipment. Built in 1959 by the Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad, it was reportedly broken up in 1991.\n\nRava Russkaya, built in 1960 by the Kherson shipyard, for the Latvian Steamship Co may have had less warlike characteristics. (However, in the background is Atlantic Cinderella. Its fleet mate Atlantic Conveyor was lost in the Falklands War.) Rava measured 7,652 grt, 11,770 dwt, and was deleted in 1991 after several years as a barge. It was also supplying fresh water to the Eastern Bloc fishing fleet when this photo was taken.\n\nFINALE\n\nWhen Fiona Jane arrived in Halifax in early 1977 she was a sad looking sight. Once the pride of Ampol Petroleum Ltd of the UK, she was built as Leslie J. Thompson by Cockerill-Ougree in Hoboken, Belgium. When built in 1959 she was considered to be quite a large ship at 16,206 grt, 24,600 dwt.\n\nIn 1970 she became the Fiona Jane under the Liberian flag and was sadly neglected by Nacional Neptunea SA. She had obviously suffered a funnel fire, but had never been repainted, and in fact she was only months away from the breakers. She arrived in Pusan July 25, 1977.\n\nBy the look of her she had ample quarters for officers (including a wireless operator) in the bridge structure, and large quarters aft for the large engine room crew. Perhaps not the epitome of the island bridge tanker, she was certainly typical of a type that will be seen no more. Present day handy size product tankers now have twice the carrying capacity and operate with one third the crew, all accommodated aft over a diesel engine. That's progress.\n\n."
