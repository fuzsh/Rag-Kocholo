        "text": "An oil tanker, also referred to as a petroleum tanker, is a vessel specifically constructed for the bulk shipment of oil and its derivatives.\n\nCrude tankers and product tankers are the two types of oil tankers available. Crude tankers transport vast amounts of unrefined crude oil from the extraction site to refineries.\n\nProduct tankers, which are usually much smaller, transport refined products from refineries to places near consumer markets.\n\nThe focus of this article, however, is not on the different types of oil tankers, but rather on the world’s longest oil tankers, which will be detailed in the following paragraphs.\n\n1. Seawise Giant\n\nFair use, Link\n\nThe Seawise Giant was the world’s largest oil tanker. It was the world’s longest self-propelled ship at the time.\n\nSeawise Giant was its initial name, although it was afterward renamed Happy Giant, Jahre Viking, Knock Nevis, and eventually Mont. This ship measured 458.46 meters in length (1,505.1 ft).\n\nSumitomo Heavy Industries in Kanagawa, Japan, built the Seawise Giant. Because of its draft, this oil tanker could not traverse the English Channel, the Panama Canal, or the Suez Canal while traveling across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, the Seawise Giant was sunk after being damaged by munitions. It was later recovered and converted into a floating storage vessel.\n\nIts final journey was in 2009 after which it was sent for scrapping.\n\n2. Pierre Guillaumat\n\nThe supertanker Pierre Guillaumat was built in 1977 for Compagnie Nationale de Navigation by Chantiers de l’Atlantique in Saint-Nazaire.\n\nIt was the third of the Batillus class supertankers (the other three were Batillus, Bellamya, and Prairial, all slightly smaller) and was notable for being the largest ship ever built (by gross tonnage).\n\nOnly Seawise Giant, which was originally smaller when built-in 1976 but was later stretched and enlarged, surpassed it in length, deadweight tonnage, and displacement.\n\nIt has a total length of 414.23 meters (1,359 ft)\n\n3. Prairial\n\nBy Jacques Girard Link\n\nPrairial was a ULCC oil tanker with four Stal-Laval steam turbines capable of producing up to 65,000 horsepower. Prairial was the longest-serving of her three sisters, serving from 1979 to 2003.\n\nThroughout her service, she was sold to new owners and renamed Sea Brilliance, Hellas Fos, and Sea Giant. She was retired from service in 2003 and scrapped the same year at Gadani, Pakistan.\n\nIts total length is 414.22 meters (1,359 feet), which is the same as that of its sister ships, Bellamya and Batillus.\n\n4. Esso Atlantic and Esso Pacific\n\nThe Esso Atlantic and Pacific were two of just seven ships in nautical history to exceed 500,000 tons deadweight. Between 1977 and 2002, they carried a gross tonnage of 235,000 tonnes and a deadweight tonnage of 508,628 tonnes.\n\nThese two Esso Atlantic class ships have a fully laden draft of 25.3 m (83 ft) when at sea, making it difficult for them to cross the English Channel, the Suez Canal, or the Panama Canal when fully loaded.\n\nThey were 406.57 meters (1,333.89 feet) long and 31.22 meters (102.43 feet) deep.\n\nWhen Esso Eastern Marine Ltd., Bermuda, sold them to Ceres Hellenic Shipping Ent. Ltd., Greece, in 2002, they were renamed Katepan Giannis. They were both scrapped in Gadani Beach, Pakistan, in August and September 2002.\n\n5. Nai Superba and Nai Genova\n\nIn 1978, the Nai Superba and her sister, the Nai Genova, were introduced as Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCC). They were built in Göteborg, Sweden, at Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad AB.\n\nThey were among the final ships built there until it closed in 1979 owing to financial problems that began when Japanese shipyards gained a foothold in the business.\n\nNai Superba and Nai Genova were steam-powered ships with a length of 381.81 meters (1,253 feet).\n\nThey transported chemicals to ports all over the world, despite their origins as oil tankers.\n\nThey were sold numerous times between 1985 and 1997, notwithstanding their adaptability.\n\nAfter three more years of economic hardship, the tragic decision was made to scrap them in 2000 (for Nai Genova) and 2001 (for Nai Superba).\n\n6. Berge Emperor and Berge Empress\n\nMitsui built the Berge Emperor and her twin sister Berge Empress supertankers in Japan in 1975.\n\nThey were both launched in the same year by Bergesen d.y. & Co. Berge Emperor lasted until 1986, and Berge Empress lasted another eight years before being demolished.\n\nThey were two of the largest oil tankers ever built, with a combined length of 381.82 m (1,252.7 ft).\n\n7. TI-Class Supertankers\n\nBy PA2 Dan Tremper, USCG. Link\n\nThe four TI class supertankers, TI Africa, TI Asia, TI Europe, and TI Oceania, were built by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering in Okpo, South Korea, for the shipping company Hellespont Group, and entered service between March 2002 and April 2003.\n\nThey are the first ULCCs to be constructed in 25 years.\n\nUnlike the other five, they are still in service and have a length of 380 meters (1,246 feet 9 inches), making them the world’s largest oil tankers currently.\n\n8. Fso Safer\n\nThe oil tanker Esso Japan was built by the Hitachi Zosen Corporation in Japan in 1976. She has a length of 362 meters (1,188 feet) and is propelled by a single steam turbine with a service speed of 15.5 knots (17.8 mph).\n\nSafer was captured by Houthi forces in March 2015, during the early days of the Yemeni Civil War, after they took control of the shoreline surrounding her mooring.\n\nHer structural state deteriorated substantially during the next few years, posing the threat of a catastrophic hull breach or an explosion of oil vapors that would normally be contained by inert gas generated on board."
