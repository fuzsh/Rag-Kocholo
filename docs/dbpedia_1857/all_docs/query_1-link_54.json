        "text": "Across the world’s expansive oceans, ships—remarkable feats of technology—navigate the waters, moving goods and passengers between continents. As we enter 2024, these enormous vessels have achieved record-breaking sizes and capacities. This article delves into the top 10 largest ships globally, highlighting the engineering achievements and maritime advancements that shape today’s maritime industry.\n\nWorld’s Biggest Ship 2024\n\nAs of 2024, the Seawise Giant stands as the largest ship in the world, holding records for length, displacement, and deadweight tonnage. Originally commissioned in 1979 as the Happy Giant oil tanker with a length of 458 meters, it gained worldwide recognition following an extensive jumboization process in 1988-1989, significantly expanding its dimensions. Today, the Seawise Giant remains an unparalleled maritime giant, symbolizing the extraordinary feats of engineering in the world of seafaring vessels.\n\nKey Facts About Seawise Giant, the World’s Largest Ship 2024\n\nHere are some of the key points related to the Seawise Giant, the largest ship of the world:\n\nThe Seawise Giant, world’s largest ship in 2024, underwent jumboization by cutting it in half and inserting a 5-meter block amidships.\n\nThis process expanded its length to an astonishing 458.45 meters, making it the longest moving man-made object in history.\n\nAs a very large crude carrier (VLCC), it boasted a record deadweight tonnage of 564,763 metric tons, capable of transporting over 4.5 million barrels of oil in a single voyage.\n\nThe colossal ship required a crew of over 60 personnel for safe operation.\n\nDespite its remarkable career spanning three decades, the Seawise Giant was sold for scrap in 2009 due to escalating operational costs.\n\nLargest Ship of the World – Historical Significance\n\nOriginally ordered in 1974 as an unnamed Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC) with a 418,611-ton capacity, the Seawise Giant faced delays in naming due to disputes between the Greek owner and Japanese builder. Hong Kong businessman C.Y. Tung acquired it, leading to its transformation into the largest ship globally through jumboization, adding 146,000 tons. Renamed Seawise Giant, it began operations in 1981 as the longest and largest ship ever built, measuring 458 meters with a deadweight capacity of 564,763 tons. Damaged in the 1988 Iran-Iraq war, it underwent repairs, changed ownership multiple times, and was eventually scrapped in 2010.\n\nTop-10 Largest Ships in the World as of August 2024\n\nAs of August 2024, Seawise Giant, constructed in 1979 stands as the largest ship in the world, with the total length of 458.46, followed by Batillus Class, Esso Pacific, and Valemax.\n\nHere is the list of top-10 largest ships in the world:\n\nLargest Ships in the World S. No. Ship Name Length (in m) Type Constructed 1. Seawise Giant 458.46 Oil tanker 1979 2. Batillus class 414.22 Oil tanker 1976-1978 3. Esso Atlantic/Esso Pacific 406.57 Oil tanker 1977 4. Valemax 360-362 Bulk carrier 2011 5. Oasis class 360-362 Passenger Ship 2009 6. Pioneering Spirit 382 Crane vessel 2013 7. Quantum class 347.06-348 Passenger ship 2014 8. Queen Mary 2 345.03 Passenger Ship 2003 9. Berge Stahl 342 Bulk carrier 1986 10. MOL Triumph Class 400 Container Ship 2017\n\nBiggest Ship in the World – Seawise Giant\n\nLength: 458.46\n\nType: Oil Tanker\n\nBuilt in: 1979\n\nThe Seawise Giant, a colossal oil tanker, initially constructed in 1979 as an unnamed vessel, achieved its status as the world’s largest ship through ‘jumboization’ in 1981. This process, involving the addition of a new mid-section, propelled its overall length to an astounding 458 meters and increased its capacity to a record-breaking 564,763 deadweight tons (DWT). Notably, the Seawise Giant holds the title as the largest ship ever built, surpassing all others in overall length, deadweight tonnage, and gross tonnage.\n\nSecond Largest Ship of the World – Batillus Class\n\nLength: 414.22\n\nType: Oil tanker\n\nBuilt in: 1976-78\n\nThe Batillus class, comprising four oil tankers built from 1976 to 1978, stands as the second-largest ships globally. Originally designed with a capacity exceeding 550,000 deadweight tons (DWT) each, these ultra-large crude carriers were considered the largest and longest vessels at the time of construction. Their record held until the conversion of the Seawise Giant, marking a significant era in maritime history.\n\nWorld’s Third Largest Ship – Esso Atlantic/Esso Pacific\n\nLength: 406.57\n\nType: Oil tanker\n\nBuilt in: 1977"
