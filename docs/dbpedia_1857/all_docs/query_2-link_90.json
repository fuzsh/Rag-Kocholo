        "text": "LIST OF WORLD'S LONGEST SHIPS\n\nSize comparison between five of the longest ships of their type\n\nThe world's longest ships are listed according to their overall length (LOA), which is the maximum length of the vessel measured between the extreme points in fore and aft. In addition the ships' deadweight tonnage (DWT) and gross tonnage (GT) are presented as they are often used to describe the size of a vessel.\n\nTo keep the size of the list reasonable only oil tankers and container ships over 370 metres (1,210 ft) in length and ships of other types with the maximum length over 350 metres (1,150 ft), with the exception of those in the comparison picture, are included in the list. Sister ships and ships of the same class are listed individually. Of ships under construction only vessels with given names and delivery dates in the near future are listed, excluding e.g. the 400-metre (1,300 ft) Maersk Triple E class.\n\nThis is an incomplete list, which may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries.\n\nName Type Length DWT GT/GRT In service Status Notes Ref\n\nSeawise Giant Oil tanker 458.46 m (1,504.1 ft) 564,650 DWT 260,851 GT 1979–2009 Broken up Seawise Giant became the longest and largest ship by deadweight tonnage after lengthening.
