        "text": "Esso Atlantic and sister ship Esso Pacific at 508.3 KDWT were the largest vessels ever built for Exxon entering service in 1977. This was to be short lived as the oil crisis and freight rates in the early 1980's forced Exxon to lay-up these vessels in Aalesund, Norway, where they remained for several years. Many other oil majors did likewise with their huge fleets of U/VLCC's. When re-activated in the mid 1980's both vessels were sold to Hellespont. I was fortunate to be C/O on the Esso Cardiff in 1977 when we carried-out 3 lighterings from the Esso Atlantic in Lyme Bay on her first voyage to Europe. An interesting huge vessel which made VLCC's appear small? I've got some photos of her somewher, will have to dig them out as they clearly show the size of pipelines and manifolf valves."
