        "text": "Imperial Oil Tankers - Part 3 - Imperial Bedford\n\nIn 1969 Imperial Oil took delivery of its second tanker built to the new pattern established by Imperial Acadia, but 40% larger. A product of the Davie Shipyard in Lauzon, QC, Imperial Bedford measured 9500 grt (later 8646 grt) and 13,980 dwt with a capacity of 112,500 bbls.\n\nImperial Bedford at number 4 oil dock at Imperoyal in Dartmouth.\n\nIt was also built for navigation in ice and in 1970 made two trips to Resolute to fuel Canada's most northerly installation, both times sailing from Montreal. It also visited Frobisher Bay (now Iqaluit) where it unloaded by means of a floating pipeline. The ship carried a spill containment boom on a large real on its after deck.\n\nThe ship's spill containment boom is stored on reel on the after deck. A knuckle boom crane is visible in this photo, loading stores at pier 31 in Halifax. Note the Esso logo applied to the funnel.\n\nDespite ice strengthening, it did receive severe ice damage in 1977, necessitating lengthy repairs at Halifax Shipyard.\n\nImperial Bedford worked out of Halifax, making scores of trips to Atlantic Canadian ports, but also traveling to the Great Lakes.\n\nThe ship was renamed Algofax but was not immediately repainted in Algoma colours. Here it nears the Angus L. Madonald bridge on its way to drydock for repainting.\n\nAlong with the rest of Imperial's fleet, it was sold to Algoma Central in 1998 and was renamed Algofax in Halifax. It entered drydock at Halifax Shipyard in March where it was repainted in Algoma colours.\n\nLoaded Algofax outbound from Halifax harbor.\n\nWith new ships on the way for Algoma Algofax was removed from service early in 2004. It was handed over at pier 31 in Halifax where it was renamed Halifax under the Georgian flag. Ownership was transferred to EnerChem Tankers, another tanker company that been absorbed by Algoma. It sailed August 14 but did not arrive in Alang until October 8, indicating that it may have worked its way east carrying some cargo. It was beached October 11, and broken up.\n\nHalifax leaving Halifax for the last time.\n\n.\n\nImperial Oil Tankers - Part 2 - Imperial Acadia\n\nThe previous post featured Imperial Quebec, which was considered quite up to date for 1957, but the next new ship for Imperial was truly modern and set the pattern for two subsequent ships.Imperial Acadia's design (as was Imperial Quebec's) came from Imperial's in-house naval architect and resulted from considerable operational feed back from the earlier ship.\n\nIt was also designed to work in ice, and had a heavy cast steel stem, extra stiffening and a wide ice belt of thicker steel. It also had the heavy fendering needed for working through the locks. Built at Port Weller Drydock the ship was named November 17, 1965 by Norah Robarts, wife of the Premier of Ontario John Robarts (himself a World War II naval officer), and entered service in the spring of 1966. The ship measured 7068 grt, 10,310 dwt and had a capacity of 80,000 bbls.\n\nImperial Acadia was based in Halifax, with some trips back to the Lakes, but generally worked in eastern Canada, with several northern forays, including one memorable trip to Resolute in 1970.\n\nImperial Acadia at the Imperoyal dock in Dartmouth.\n\nIt experienced the usual scrapes and bangs, including a grounding at Port aux Basques, June 25, 1982 resulting a major diesel oil spill. The ship was repaired in Halifax.\n\nAfter a \"dry tow\" from Marystown, the ship is ready to to be offloaded. The white marks on the hull below the bridge are part of the damage to the hull.\n\nThe most notable incident occurred in St-Pierre et Miquelon on January 30, 1990. Trapped in St-Pierre harbour by a fierce storm it ranged up and down against the pier causing severe hull damage. In view of the ship's age, it was thought that it would not be worth repairing. However after a survey in Marystown, NL, the ship was transported to Halifax aboard the semi-submersible heavy lift ship Mighty Servant 1 in March 1990 for rebuilding. While at Halifax Shipyard, a bilge fire May 23 caused even more damage, but the ship was back in service in June.\n\nApproaching the oil dock in Dartmouth, the rubber fendering is quite prominent.\n\nIn 1997 Imperial Oil, like its parent company Exxon Mobil and most oil majors, divested its tanker fleet. Algoma Central Marine formed Algoma Tankers Ltd and acquired all of Imperial's coastal tanker fleet.\n\nImperial Acadia often tied up on the Halifax side of the harbour for maintenance and hot work.\n\nAfter a brief layup in Halifax, Imperial Acadia became Algoscotia and was renamed in January 1998 after drydocking and repainting in Algoma colours. The ship continued to trade as before, on long term contract to Imperial Oil. As Algoma began a rebuilding program, the older ships were sold off.\n\nAlgoscotia's career with Algoma was brief, as newer ships were ordered.\n\nOn April 3, 2001 new owners McKeil Marine gave Algoscotia the name Ralph Tucker in Halifax, although this was changed to Capt. Ralph Tucker during the ship's first trip.\n\nCapt. Ralph Tucker, before its hull was repainted, tied up in Amherstburg, ON its new home port.\n\nNo longer licensed to carry petroleum, the ship was instead in dedicated service carrying calcium chloride (brine) used in the petroleum and chemical industries. It visited Halifax in that trade, but operated mostly between Manistee, MI and Amherstburg, ON for the Allied Chemical Co, working year round.\n\nIt had a few groundings while on the Lakes, one in 2002 necessitated major repairs, which again extended the ship's life by returning it to ice class 1A.\n\nTugs and barges took over the brine work in 2003 and the ship was sold for scrap in 2004. It sailed from Montreal September 12, 2004 as Ralph Tucker under the St.Vincent and Grenadines flag and upon arrival in Chittagong, Bangladesh and was broken up.\n\n.\n\nImperial Oil Tankers - Part 1 - Imperial Quebec\n\nOne of the effects of Imperial Oil's decision to stop refining activities in Dartmouth on the eastern side of Halifax harbour in 2013 is the decline in coastal tankers. Now as a storage facility, it distributes most of its product locally by truck. It does receive the odd domestic cargo from other refiners and still makes some deliveries to outports by ship, but the traffic is greatly reduced from the refinery's heyday.\n\nImperial Oil was founded in London,ON in 1880 and began operations in Sarnia, ON in 1899 and chartered its first tanker in 1902 for operation on the Great Lakes. Between 1914 and 1918 the company built refineries in Ioco BC, Regina SK, Montreal QC and starting in 1916 on a 400 acre site in South Woodside, NS which was renamed Imperoyal. (Over time the area was amalgamated into the City of Dartmouth, which itself amalgamated with Halifax.)\n\nDue to an increase in demand for gasoline and the needs of World War I, Imperial saw the need for a refinery on ice free tidewater. It also served as a transfer point for US oil, sold to the Allies before the US entered the conflict.\n\nAs the only refinery in Atlantic Canada it became a strategic asset in both World Wars. The Imperoyal refinery was essential to the operations of Allied navies and merchant ships in Halifax, but also to supply industries and bases remote from Halifax, and to supply Britain itself.\n\nIn 1921 the company expanded its shipping fleet beyond the Great Lakes to deep sea in order to import crude from its oil fields in South America and to distribute product. During World War II the international shipping operations expanded dramatically.\n\nIn 1945 the domestic fleet consisted of fourteen coastal tankers and five deep sea tankers. Replacement of older units on the Lakes, and both coasts began soon after.\n\nImperial Oil entered a new era in 1957 with construction of Imperial Quebec (50,000 bbl capacity) its first tanker with both wheelhouse and accommodation aft.It was confined to the Great Lakes for two years until the St.Lawrence Seaway opened, then traded all over the east coast. As buit it was also painted in Imperials black and red colour scheme. A new livery was introduced in 1968, with a blue hull and cream coloured superstructure.\n\nImperial Quebec tied up on the Halifax side of the harbor for routine maintenance, which could not be done at the oil docks for safety reasons.\n\nImperial Quebec could be a bit of a smoker at times, but it was all Imperial Oil.\n\nA product of Collingwood Shipyard, it measured 4680 grt, 5150 dwt and worked year round out of Halifax. It reached Frobisher Bay in 1970 and Venezuela in 1987. It was an early adopter of the bulbous bow, which was thought not to be effective in ice, but the ship seemed to be able to navigate year round without too much difficulty. It was also heavily fendered at the bow and sides for navigation in the Seaway locks. The grinding of steel ships along concrete walls generates sparks, which are to be avoided with tankers!\n\nImperial changed to a very un-nautical looking funnel with \"Esso\" in large letters, in line with its US parent which became Exxon. Imperial kept the Esso brand name.\n\nReaching the end of its economical life with Imperial Oil in 1987 it was purchased by the Woodward Group of Newfoundland and renamed Sibyl W., and carried on for another five years under the Canadian flag.\n\nIn 1992 it was sold to the opaquely named Panamanian company SSS Trading and renamed Panama Trader. It operated under that name until May 1996 when it was reported broken up in Guaymas, MX. The actual scrapping may have taken place before that.\n\n.\n\nNelvana - end of the road\n\nThe Panamax self-unloading bulker Nelvana arrived off Aliaga, Turkey April 24, and will be borken up in the very near future.\n\nThe tug Atlantic Willow assists Nelvana to her berth in Auld's Cove, with Cape Porcupine looming overhead. Nelvana alone is responsible for exporting several million tonnes of the mountain to the United States.\n\nA rare caller in Halifax, it was better known on the Strait of Canso where it loaded out aggregates from Cape Porcupine for many years. It was also in the coal, phosphate, sand and stone trade in the Caribbean and was a frequent visitor to Tampa.\n\nIn Tampa Nelvana extends her boom out to a hopper which is connected to a system of conveyors that transport the cargo of aggregate to a series of stockpiles. (This portion of the port is no longer accessible to civilians.)\n\nBuilt in 1983 by Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan (it was launched December 4, 1982) and came in at 44,340 grt and 74,973 dwt. It was notable for its big bluff bow, which must have caused a lot of impact as it butted into head seas. A prominent breakwater on the forecastle head protected the forward hatches from seas breaking over the bow.\n\nNelvana filled the Novadock floating drydock at Halifax shipyard, which was built for Panamax ships.\n\nIt did visit Halifax in November 1998 and again in November 2007 when it was drydocked at Halifax Shipyard. It was too large to take a full load at National Gypsum.\n\nBuilt for Marbulk Carriers, when Marbulk Shipping Ltd was owned by Upper Lakes Group, it wore the golden seahorse on its blue funnel, and may be the last ship to do so. It was intially registered in Liberia then 1987 switched to Vanuatu. When Marbulk was sold to Algoma and CSL the ship remained in the CSL pool and worked on both the Pacific and Atlantic Coasts and in Europe, once unloading 65,000 tonnes of granite in Liverpool, UK.\n\nNew ships were added to the CSL pool in recent years and now all the Marbulk ships (Ambassador and Pioneer were the other two) have now gone to the scrappers.\n\nIn 2012 Nelvana's registry was moved to Bermuda, and the ship was advertised on the Beltship Management Ltd website and worked along with Gypsum Centennial and Gypsum Integrity in the Sierra Leone iron shuttle which has ended. (The latter ship has now been sold to Algoma, see April 12 .)\n\nThe golden seahorse funnel mark can be traced back to the Upper Lakes ship Wheat King , which was flagged out for a time to Island Shipping, when ULS's owner Jack Leitch was fighting for the survival of his company with a convicted hoodlum union boss. Leitch eventually prevailed, the company survived and Marbulk was formed to operate ULS's deep sea fleet. The seahorse became emblematic of the company's determination to succeed.\n\nThe book Upper Lakes 1932-1982, actually titled The First 50 Years, by Wally Macht, privately published by the company, is well worth the read if you can lay hands on it.\n\nUpper Lakes is no more - the company sold off all its assets, and the significance of the golden seahorse is lost.\n\nSee some previous Shipfax references: http://shipfax.blogspot.ca/2012/02/ambassador-for-gypsum-only-ship-2-for.html\n\nR.I.P.\n\n.\n\nGrand Benelux - not your usual ACLer\n\nShipping lines adopt various colour schemes to distinguish their ships from their competitors. Various shades of the primary colours of red, blue and green seem to be as popular as greys and blacks, so subtle shadings are needed to further differentiate ships. Few lines chose yellow however, so Grimaldi Lines ships are distinguishable anywhere, even if the colours must be very difficult to maintain.\n\nGrand Benelux provides high visibility even in murky weather.\n\nToday's Autoport visitor Grand Benelux scores on both counts of instant recognition, but does point out the need for diligent maintenance. That would certainly be easier in the company's home turf of Italy, but today was no day for touchups in Halifax. The ship sailed during a break in what some were calling \"fat rain\"- a form of of precipitation halfway between rain and snow.\n\nThe ship was built in 2001 by the Uljanik shipyard in Pula, Croatia, and measures 37,212 grt, 12,594 dwt, making it one of the smaller carriers, nevertheless it has a capacity of 4500 cars.\n\nOne interesting aspect of the ship is that it actually owned by Atlantic Container Line and chartered to the parent company Grimaldi Group. ACL owns the five ConRos we see in Halifax ion a regular basis, but also has seven more ConRos and PCTCs (pure car and truck carriers) which it charters out for use by Grimaldi Group companies. ACL ships are painted in the more serviceable dark blue, but even it becomes battle scarred after a winter in the North Atlantic.\n\nA wide angle view of Atlantic Concert leaving Bedford Basin on Sunday, showing the wear and tear from winter work.\n\nACL has an enviable reputation on the North Atlantic. Read this interesting speech by the company's president and ceo: http://splash247.com/atlantic-container-line-carriers-obsessed-with-market-share-instead-of-profitability/\n\n.\n\nMore rails, this time it's Freya\n\nCN's insatiable need for rails means steady business for Halifax. A parade of ships manages to keep up with the demand, by bringing in and stockpiling cargo at pier 27. Today's arrival is typical of the type of ship that is used for this cumbersome commodity.\n\nFreya arrived with a bit of a list.\n\nFreya measures 7406 grt, 10,500 dwt and can carry a variety of bulk and breakbulk cargoes in its box shaped holds. With two 60 tonne cranes, it can unload most of what it would be expected to carry. Built to a Damen design by the Nikolyev Shipyard Okean in the Ukraine as Rebecca in 2001, it was acquired last year by Intersee of Haren (Ems), Germany and renamed. The ship flies the flag of Antigua and Barbuda, a common flag of convenience for German owned ships.\n\nThe ship has a travelling gantry that lifts off the hatch covers for stacking. The red structure beneath the gantry is for hold ventilation.\n\nThe ship has its cranes mounted on the starboard side (most ships seem to have them mounted port side) so the ship backed in to pier 27, to allow the cranes to offload most efficiently. It also arrived with a noticeable list, indicating that some of the cargo may have shifted en route from Poland..\n\nThe tug Atlantic Larch takes a line off the ship's bow to assist it in turning. It will then act a a brake when the ship backs in to pier 27.\n\n.\n\nSunlight Ace sees some sunshine, TransPine goes to anchor\n\nNot much activity in Halifax harbour today, but the autocarrier Sunlight Ace did see some sunshine for a time, after it arrived out of the fog at noon time.\n\nOnce inside Meagher's Beach, the ship was in the clear.\n\nSunlight Ace is operated by Mitsui OSK Lines, and measures 58,911 grt, but only 18,855 dwt, an indication of the great volume needed to carry cars (1 gross ton = 100 cubic feet). Builder Minami-Nippon located in Usuki, Japan, built the ship in 2009 and it flues the Bahamas flag..\n\nThe ship went to anchor for Asian gypsy moth inspection before being cleared to tie up at Autoport to unload its cargo.\n\nDipping its anchor a couple of times to clear it of Halifax harbour muck, the ship heads for Autoport late this afternoon.\n\nThere was lots of sun early this morning when the paper carrier TransPine left its berth at pier 27 at 0800 to anchor in Bedford Basin.\n\nThe ship had been tied up since Monday clearing its tanks of contaminated fuel. Pumper trucks were hard at work removing the offending diesel oil and cleaning the tanks. According to reports, the ship had fuel problems while crossing the Atlantic two months ago and had to put into St.John's, NL en route to US ports. However the problem was not solved, and after lying up at anchor off Jacksonville, FL for six weeks the ship was diverted to Halifax to try to fix the problem once and for all.\n\nI hear that it was supposed to take over the Corner Brook run from its sister TransFighter but that has been put off at least for a time. The ship is now awaiting orders.\n\nThe ship seems unable to make up its mind, but in fact it is warning tug operators not to push on the ship's side door, but to push on the bulkhead location where the ship's hull is strongest.\n\n.\n\nShamrock coming back (as Nolhanava)\n\nArriving in Halifax for the fist time January 20, 2001.\n\nA ship built specifically to run between Halifax and St-Pierre et Miquelon is arriving back in Halifax tomorrow and tying up at pier 34. Built in 2000 by Santierul Naval Constanta SA of Romania as Shamrock, it operated weekly from Halifax starting with its first arrival January 20, 2001.\n\nIt was was registered in the French offshore registry of the Kerguelan Islands (French Antarctic Territories) and is a RoRo cargo ship of 4,654 grt, 4,850 dwt and carries two 40 tonne cranes. It two MAN engines drive two cp props for a speed of 16 knots.\n\nBy 2004 the ship was operating a feeder service from Halifax to Portland, ME and Boston, having lost the St-Pierre route.\n\nIn July 2004 it was arrested in Portland. ME and was sold at auction to Clarke Inc's CIS Shipping International Inc and placed under the Barbados flag. It returned to Halifax in December 2004 for drydocking and repainting, and was placed under the management of Thien + Hyenga Bereederungs for service between Fort Lauderdale, FL and the Cayman Islands.\n\nOnce a large operator of ships in Canada, Clarke Inc and its antecedents also had an interest in the Halterm container pier and DART Container Line, but in recent years has divested its transportation interests. Last year it sold its trucking business to TransForce, although the Clarke name is still used.\n\nEarly this year St-Pierre interests acquired the Shamrock. The new owners are styled MG Management SAS with TMS-AV SARL as managers, and in March renamed the ship Nolhanava.\n\nIt appears that the ship is set to take over the St-Pierre et Miquelon service once again, from the current incumbent Fusion, that has been on a series of charters since 2007. Current owners of Fusion are listed as MD Shipping Co of Odessa, Ukraine, and the similarity of owners names suggest a connection, but there may not be one.\n\nFusion will be arriving at is usual berth at pier 36 tomorrow - maybe for the last time?\n\nAs recently as last week Fusion had mechanical problems and had to delay its arrival from anchor off Halifax until they were corrected. If it is indeed replaced, I will post more of its story.\n\nFusion looked good sailing from Halifax in late afternoon sun October 25, 2013.\n\n.\n\nNYK Diana rates a double escort\n\nWhen NYK Diana arrived this afternoon the fog outside the harbour was so thick that the ship had to be lead in part of the way by the pilot boat before the pilot could board. That is not unheard of, but is fairly rare. Once inside the harbour the fog had cleared and the sun was blazing brightly. Then came the next unsual thing.\n\nLarge ships transiting the Narrows are now required to have a stern tethered escort tug. (Or more than one depending on wind, but there was negligible wind today). That job is assigned to the Atlantic Oak, a 5,000 bhp ASD (azimuthing stern drive) tug. However when NYK Diana arrived, Atlantic Oak was occupied berthing the previous arrival, Oakland Express. The other two tugs, Atlantic Larch and Atlantic Willow while they are also ASD tugs, they rate 4,000 bhp. Each tug put a line up astern of NYK Diana and assisted the tug through the Narrows. This is the first time I have ever seen this, but it may have happened before.\n\nOddly, after Atlantic Oak completed its work with Oakland Express, and it had headed back to base, it was through the Narrows and almost at the Macdonald bridge, when it turned around and came back to Fairview Cove to assist the berthing. It wasn't possible to see why this was needed.\n\nNYK Diana was built in 2008 by Hyundai Heavy Industries, Ulsan and carries 4922 TEU on 55,534 grt, 65,976 dwt. It operates under the Panama flag for NYK Ship Management of Singapore, and calls in Halifax for the G6 Alliance.\n\n."
