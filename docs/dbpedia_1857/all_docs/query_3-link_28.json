        "text": "(Calgary, Canada, May 23, 2023) – Hexagon’s Autonomy & Positioning division and Hitachi Zosen Corporation (Hitachi Zosen) are proud to announce that they have signed an agreement to bring the TerraStar-X Enterprise correction service to Japan.\n\nAs a regional leader in the GNSS industry, Hitachi Zosen manages a nationwide network of 1,300 reference stations operated by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI). Nippon GPS Data Service (NGDS), a subsidiary of Hitachi Zosen, will provide Hexagon with GNSS data from this network. With this data, Hexagon can offer exceptional levels of redundancy and accuracy through the TerraStar-X Enterprise GNSS correction service, which is important for automotive applications. The service is now available for testing in the Tokyo area and will be expanded across Japan.\n\nHexagon currently has operational testbeds for TerraStar-X Enterprise in various locations throughout North America, Europe and China that provide reliable, lane-level accuracy in under a minute. With the addition of a testbed in Japan, vehicle manufacturers and technology providers can use the same design for all their correction service requirements.\n\n“Our collaboration with Hitachi Zosen and NGDS allows us the opportunity to expand our service offerings and better equip our automotive and consumer customers with access to TerraStar-X Enterprise across major markets,” said Sara Masterson, director of positioning services at Hexagon’s Autonomy & Positioning division. “Our testbed in Japan is available to technology partners wanting to experience the high performance from TerraStar-X in their advanced driver assistance systems, smartphone applications, micromobility or safety-critical applications.”\n\n“We are very pleased to be working with Hexagon to bring TerraStar-X Enterprise to Japan,” said Takeshi Nakamura, associate executive officer of the electronic control business unit at Hitachi Zosen and president at NGDS. “Our local technical and market expertise, combined with Hexagon’s 30+ years of positioning experience delivering global corrections across major markets, makes for an excellent partnership.”\n\nBy utilising data created from GSI network observations, Hexagon’s TerraStar-X Enterprise will ensure fast convergence to lane-level accuracy and is available to support large-scale programs with functional safety requirements in Japan.\n\nLearn more about TerraStar-X Enterprise corrections by visiting novatel.com/terrastar-x.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nAbout Hexagon\n\nHexagon is a global leader in digital reality solutions, combining sensor, software and autonomous technologies.
