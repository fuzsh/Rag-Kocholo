Hitachi Zosen Inova (HZI) is a global green tech company operating in Waste to Energy (WtE) and Renewable Gas. Our roots are in Switzerland, where we were established in 1933 as “L. von Roll Aktiengesellschaft”, later known as Von Roll Inova. Since 2010, we have been part of the Hitachi Zosen Corporation, one of Japan’s largest industrial and engineering firms and a longstanding partner and licensee of Von Roll Inova.

We have been building and maintaining environmental plants for over 90 years. We develop projects with our clients, drawing on our experience as a general engineering, procurement and construction contractor to deliver complex turnkey plants and system solutions for thermal and biological WtE recovery, gas upgrading and power to gas on their behalf. We also offer comprehensive, expert and reliable after-sales services for operators of existing plants. Quality is our greatest asset. Our unconditional endeavors to achieve this quality, together with our long experience and honest commitment, are what we pass on to clients.

The challenge of continually finding the best possible solutions for our clients is what drives us. We work closely with clients to find and develop integrated solutions tailored to their individual needs and requirements – solutions based on a blend of proven technologies and passionate innovation that meet the highest quality, efficiency and environmental protection standards. This is why we’re among the market leaders in our field; we love what we do.
