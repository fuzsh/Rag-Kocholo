        "text": "By Kane Wu\n\nHONG KONG–Another Chinese drugmaker is preparing to tap the Hong Kong stock market this year as China’s domestic markets slump.\n\nSimcere Pharmaceutical Group, a Chinese company that was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2013, is planning to raise as much as $1 billion in a Hong Kong IPO in the third quarter, adding to a wave of pharmaceutical companies tapping investor interest in China’s growing health-care industry, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nA tumultuous start to trading in Shanghai and Shenzhen this year could make Hong Kong more attractive to a number of Chinese companies that, like Simcere, have delisted from U.S. markets and are planning to come home to list. China’s domestic markets tend to offer higher valuations than Hong Kong, but regulators also assert greater control over the timing of IPOs onshore.\n\nSimcere’s planned return to the public markets could mean a big payday for its chairman and private-equity backers. The relisting comes after a roughly $500 million management buyout in 2013 by a consortium including Chairman Ren Jinsheng, Chinese private-equity firm Hony Capital and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co.\n\nThe company, based in southeastern China’s Jiangsu province, has tapped China Merchants Securities (HK) Co., Morgan Stanley and UBS Group AG to lead the IPO, the people familiar with the matter said. Once solely a distributor of drugs in China, Simcere has expanded into developing its own treatments and generics in China. The company has made an effort to expand its research-and-development spending and partner with international drug companies.\n\nThe 27 Chinese companies listed in the U.S. that announced plans to go private last year, with a total transaction value of $33.5 billion, will be closely watching Simcere’s relisting. Hong Kong’s markets have remained open while China shut its markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen to IPOs last year after the stock markets crashed in the summer. More than 700 companies are awaiting the Chinese securities regulator’s nod to restart IPO applications.\n\nSimcere will join a clutch of Chinese pharmaceutical companies lining up to raise more than $5 billion in Hong Kong IPOs this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nJiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Co., another drugmaker from the same province, is planning an up to $3 billion IPO around the same time as Simcere, in what could be the largest health-care IPO in Hong Kong ever, people familiar with that deal said earlier this week.\n\nChinese health-care companies, which are expected to benefit from rising wealth among the country’s middle-class as well as an aging population, were among the most active issuers of stock in Hong Kong last year. Fourteen companies raised a total of $2.6 billion in Hong Kong IPOs last year, the largest sum ever, and more than twice the $1.1 billion raised in 2014, Dealogic data show.\n\nInvestors have been eager to put money into China’s health-care sector, seeing more room for growth. Spending on drugs and medical treatment as a portion of income is smaller than in the U.S. and other developed countries. Chinese spending on pharmaceuticals topped $100 billion in 2014, up 14% from the prior year, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co.\n\nSimcere will also be the first company taken private from the U.S. to relist in Hong Kong since 3SBio Inc., a cell-based biopharmaceuticals producer, raised $818 million in its IPO in June last year. 3SBio’s shares are up about 17% since the listing. The company delisted from Nasdaq in 2013 in a buyout deal valued at about $340 million, and its market capitalization now stands at around $3.5 billion."
