        "text": "- Entered into Definitive Merger Agreement to be Acquired by Pharmacosmos; Transaction Expected to Close in Late Third Quarter 2024 -\n\n- Achieved $15.8 Million in Net Revenue from Sales of COSELA® (trilaciclib) -\n\n- Drove Double Digit Quarter-Over-Quarter Growth in COSELA Vial Volume and Net Revenue -\n\n- Reaffirmed 2024 Net COSELA Revenue Guidance of Between $60 and $70 Million -\n\n- Due to the Pending Transaction with Pharmacosmos, G1 will Not Host a Conference Call and Webcast to Discuss the Second Quarter Financial Results and Business Update -\n\nRESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Aug. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- G1 Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: GTHX), a commercial-stage oncology company, today provided a corporate and financial update for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n\"We are excited about what will be possible by the combined Pharmacosmos + G1 team as we meet the needs of more cancer patients. This transaction delivers a significant premium to our shareholders and better and broader access to COSELA for the cancer patients we seek to treat,” said Jack Bailey, Chief Executive Officer of G1 Therapeutics. “In the meantime, as we move toward closing, our focus remains on accelerating and expanding the growth of the COSELA business in extensive stage small cell lung cancer; the double-digit quarter-over-quarter growth we experienced in vial volume and net revenue represents continued progress in that regard. We also reaffirmed our 2024 net sales guidance of between $60 million and $70 million, which is indicative of our continued confidence in the business.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights\n\nPending Transaction with Pharmacosmos\n\nG1 to be Acquired by Pharmacosmos: G1 announced a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by Pharmacosmos for $7.15 per share. Specifically, on August 7, 2024, we and Pharmacosmos entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Pharmacosmos, through its U.S. subsidiary Pharmacosmos Therapeutics Inc., will cause a cash tender offer to be commenced to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, at a price per share of $7.15, net to the seller in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law. Following the consummation of the transaction, G1 will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Pharmacosmos. The transaction is expected to close late in the third quarter of 2024, subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. (See August 7, 2024 press release here)\n\nFinancial\n\nNet COSELA Revenue Grew 12% Over the Prior Quarter to $15.8 Million: Vial volume grew 10% in the second quarter over the first quarter of 2024.\n\nYear-Over-Year Reduction in Operating Expenses Expected in 2024: The Company now expects full year operational expense to be 25% to 30% below that of 2023.\n\nCurrent Cash Runway Extends to Profitability: G1 ended the second quarter of 2024 with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $60.7 million. G1 believes it has sufficient cash runway to achieve anticipated company profitability in the second half of 2025.\n\nCorporate\n\nAnnounced License Agreement for Lerociclib with Pepper Bio, Inc.: Pepper Bio will gain exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize lerociclib for all indications except for certain radioprotectant uses in the US, Europe, Japan, and all other global markets, excluding the Asia-Pacific region. Under the terms of the agreement, G1 expects to receive upfront payments totaling mid-single digit millions within 12 months and is eligible to receive a maximum of $135 million upon achievement of development and commercial milestones in up to three indications. Pepper Bio will pay G1 a low double-digit royalty on aggregate annual net sales of lerociclib. (see May 1, 2024 press release here)\n\nAnnounced License Agreement for Lerociclib with Deimos Biosciences: Deimos Biosciences has the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize lerociclib for certain radioprotective uses in the US, Europe, Japan, and all other global markets, excluding the Asia-Pacific region, which G1 has already licensed to Genor Biopharma. Under the terms of the agreement, G1 is expected to receive shares of Deimos Biosciences’ common stock representing 10% of Deimos Biosciences’ outstanding equity capitalization on a fully diluted basis, in addition to a 20% royalty on aggregate annual net sales of lerociclib. (See May 22, 2024 press release here)\n\nClinical\n\nPositive Efficacy Results from Phase 2 Trial of Trilaciclib in Combination with a TROP2 ADC Presented at the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting: In the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population, patients receiving trilaciclib prior to sacituzumab govitecan (SG) experienced a median overall survival (OS) of 15.9 months compared to the expected 12.1 months for SG alone based on historical data from the ASCENT trial. Twelve-month OS was 60%. Mature safety results show a clinically meaningful on-target effect of trilaciclib to reduce the rates of multiple treatment emergent adverse events associated with SG compared to the previously published SG single agent safety profile from the ASCENT trial, including measures of myelosuppression and diarrhea. (See May 28, 2024 press release here)\n\nFinal Analysis of the Phase 3 PRESERVE 2 Trial in 1L Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (mTNBC) Showed Continued Evidence of Myeloprotection But Did Not Achieve Primary OS Endpoint: Consistent with other trilaciclib studies, evidence of myeloprotection was observed, including a reduction in the occurrence of severe neutropenia, which occurred in 8% of patients who received trilaciclib compared to 29% of patients in the control arm. The trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect in the ITT population, with a Hazard Ratio of 0.91. The Company has discontinued all expenditures into the mTNBC indication and market. (See June 24, 2024 press release here)\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $60.7 million, compared to $82.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company believes that its current cash runway is sufficient to fund its operations into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nTotal revenues for the second quarter of 2024 were $16.5 million, including $15.8 million in net product sales of COSELA and license revenue of $0.7 million, primarily related to an upfront payment from Pepper Bio. This is compared to $42.4 million in total revenues in the second quarter of 2023, which included $11.1 million in net product sales of COSELA and license revenue of $31.3 million, primarily related to the one-time payment for the relief of future royalties from Simcere.\n\nOperating expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $20.1 million, compared to $30.9 million for the second quarter of 2023. GAAP operating expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $3.8 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nCost of goods sold expense for the second quarter of 2024 was $0.7 million, compared to $1.4 million for the second quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in personnel costs driven by headcount reductions, as well as a planned reduced weighted average cost of finished goods compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $5.7 million, compared to $12.0 million for the second quarter of 2023. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily due to a decrease in the Company's clinical program costs.\n\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $13.6 million, compared to $17.4 million for the second quarter of 2023. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to decreases in personnel costs, commercialization activities, and medical affairs.\n\nThe net loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $5.5 million, compared to net income of $8.7 million for the second quarter of 2023. The basic and diluted net loss per share for the second quarter of 2024 was $(0.10), compared to the basic and diluted net income per share for the second quarter of 2023 of $0.17 and $0.14, respectively.\n\n2024 Financial Guidance\n\nG1 today reaffirmed its full year 2024 revenue guidance. G1's guidance is based on current expectations for continued sales growth of COSELA in the U.S. and achievement of its forecasts. The Company expects to generate between $60 million and $70 million in COSELA net revenue in 2024. Additionally, G1 expects its full year 2024 operational expenses to be 25% to 30% below that of the prior year. As a result, G1 believes it has sufficient cash runway to achieve anticipated company profitability in the second half of 2025.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call\n\nDue to the pending transaction with Pharmacosmos, G1 will no longer be hosting conference to review our second quarter 2024 results at 8:30 am ET today, as originally planned.\n\nAbout COSELA® (trilaciclib) for Injection\n\nCOSELA (trilaciclib) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on February 12, 2021.\n\nIndication\n\nCOSELA® (trilaciclib) is indicated to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients when administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nCOSELA is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to trilaciclib.\n\nWarnings and precautions include injection-site reactions (including phlebitis and thrombophlebitis), acute drug hypersensitivity reactions, interstitial lung disease (pneumonitis), and embryo-fetal toxicity.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (>10%) were fatigue, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, aspartate aminotransferase increased, headache, and pneumonia.\n\nThis information is not comprehensive.
