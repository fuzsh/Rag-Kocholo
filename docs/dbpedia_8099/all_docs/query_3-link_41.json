        "text": "Net Income Increased 67.5% Year Over Year\n\nNANJING, China, May 6 /Xinhua-PRNewswire/ -- Simcere Pharmaceutical Group (NYSE: SCR), a leading manufacturer and supplier of branded generic pharmaceuticals and manufacturer of the patented anti-cancer biotech product Endu in China, today reported unaudited financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008.\n\nHighlights\n\n-- Total revenue increased to RMB394.6 million (US$56.3 million) for the\n\nfirst quarter of 2008 from RMB312.3 million in the first quarter of\n\n2007, representing a 26.4% year over year growth;\n\n-- Net income increased to RMB112.1 million (US$16.0 million) for the\n\nfirst quarter of 2008 from RMB66.9 million in the first quarter of 2007,\n\nrepresenting a 67.5% year over year growth;\n\n-- Basic and diluted earnings per ADS were RMB1.79 (US$0.26) and RMB1.76\n\n(US$0.25), respectively. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares; and\n\n-- Gross margin increased to 83.2% for the first quarter of 2008 compared\n\nto 81.7% in the first quarter of 2007.\n\n-- On April 18, 2008, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to\n\nacquire a 70.0% equity interest in Wuhu Zhong Ren Pharmaceutical Co.\n\nLtd.; Simcere’s third acquisition post IPO.\n\nMr. Jinsheng Ren, Chairman and CEO of Simcere Pharmaceutical Group, commented, “Simcere has achieved steady growth in the past quarter, with sales of our anti-cancer product Endu and stroke management products Bicun and Yidasheng continuing to improve year on year. The revenue from these three drugs contributed about 55% of our total product revenue in the first quarter, as our strategic emphasis shifts from branded generics to first-to-market branded generics and innovative drugs. In addition, our continuing efforts in merger and acquisition initiatives have led us to our third post-IPO acquisition: the acquisition of 70.0% equity interest in Wuhu Zhong Ren Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., a Chinese drug manufacturer specializing in the production of sustained release anti-tumor implants. We aim to find more exciting acquisition opportunities like this to expand our growing product portfolio.”\n\n2008 First Quarter Financial Results\n\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2008 was RMB394.6 million (US$56.3 million), representing a growth of 26.4% from RMB312.3 million for the same period in 2007.\n\nRevenue from Endu, the Company’s patented anti-cancer pharmaceutical, totaled RMB63.8 million (US$9.1 million), representing 16.2% of the Company’s product revenue for the quarter and a growth of 63.6% from RMB39.0 million for the same period in 2007.\n\nRevenue from Edavarone injection products, Bicun and Yidasheng, the Company’s first-to-market stroke management product, totaled RMB152.0 million (US$21.7 million) in the first quarter of 2008, representing 38.7% of the Company’s product revenue and a growth of 89.1% from RMB80.4 million for the same period in 2007.\n\nRevenue from other branded generic products for the first quarter of 2008 totaled RMB177.1 million (US$25.3 million), compared withRMB192.9 million for the same period in 2007.\n\nGross margin for the first quarter of 2008 increased to 83.2%, as compared to 81.7% in the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the optimization of the product portfolio, as increased sales of first-to-market branded generic Bicun and innovative drug Endu, both have higher gross margin compared to the Company’s other products.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the first quarter of 2008 totaled RMB17.8 million (US$2.5 million), an increase of 29.3% from RMB13.7 million for the corresponding period a year ago. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the ongoing Phase IV clinical study for Endu, continuing expansion of the Company’s research and development department and other ongoing research projects.\n\nSales, marketing and distribution expenses for the first quarter of 2008 were RMB164.5 million (US$23.5 million), an increase of 20.7% from RMB136.3 million for the corresponding period a year ago. As a percentage of total revenue, sales, marketing and distribution expenses were 41.7% compared to 43.6% for the same period in 2007. The decrease was partially due to fewer marketing activities during January and February 2008 when many parts of China were severely hit by the snow storm.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were RMB47.0 million (US$6.7 million) for the first quarter of 2008, representing an increase of 52.0% from RMB30.9 million for the first quarter of 2007. The increase was attributable to increases in professional fees and other administrative expenses since listing in April 2007 and the expenses incurred in the newly consolidated business entities.\n\nShare-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses, based on the nature of the work the Company’s employees were assigned to perform, totaled RMB7.0 million (US$1.0 million) for the first quarter of 2008.\n\nOperating income was RMB99.2 million (US$14.1 million) for the first quarter of 2008, representing an increase of 34.0% as compared to RMB74.0 million for the corresponding period of 2007.\n\nIncome tax expense for the first quarter of 2008 totaled RMB16.8 million (US$2.4 million) compared to RMB1.5 million for the corresponding period of 2007. The increase was primarily due to the expiration of tax holidays of two subsidiaries.\n\nNet income was RMB112.1 million (US$16.0 million) for the first quarter of 2008, compared to RMB66.9 million in the corresponding period a year ago and representing growth of 67.5%. The Company’s net margin was 28.4% for the first quarter of 2008 compared to 21.4% for the first quarter of 2007.\n\nThe basic earnings per American Depository Share (ADS) for the first quarter of 2008 increased to RMB1.79 (US$0.26) and the diluted earnings per ADS increased to RMB1.76 (US$0.25), compared to basic earnings per ADS of RMB1.34 and diluted earnings per ADS of RMB1.30 for the corresponding period a year ago. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares.\n\nAs of March 31, 2008, the Company had cash and cash equivalents (including pledged bank deposits), and short-term investments of RMB950.4 million (US$135.5 million) compared to RMB968.3 million as of December 31, 2007.\n\nOn April 18, 2008, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 70% equity interest in Wuhu Zhong Ren Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. for RMB64.8 million (US$9.2 million) in cash. The Company believes that this transaction, which expands its first-to-market product pipeline in oncology, reinforces the Company’s previously announced strategy of focusing on first-to-market brand generics and innovative drugs.\n\nFinancial Outlook\n\nBased on current operating and market conditions, Simcere maintains its target total revenue for the full year 2008 between RMB2.0 billion and RMB2.1 billion and target annual net income for the full year 2008 between RMB390.0 million and RMB400.0 million.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
