Over the years, Simcere has worked with many charitable organizations. We were among the first in response to several national crises, such as the Wenchuan Earthquake, Yushu Earthquake, Tornado and Hail Disaster in Yancheng City, and Simcere has actively donated funds and medicines for disaster relief efforts and the treatment of injured people.\n\nPublic Welfare\n\nSince 2010, we started a charity program for students in Yushu. This ongoing program has brought warm care from the outside world to more than 400 students. As well as providing study and living subsidies, we also have supported their growth through hosting a “World Expo Trip” and “Xi'an Trip”, employee-student sponsorships and other activities."
