        "text": "Probably not all offices have regular arguments about which states are the most literary. Or maybe they do. In any case, our office does, and it’s a never-ending discussion, not least because there are a hundred different metrics you could use to determine the “literariness” of a state—which is itself a made-up distinction, of course.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nStill, it’s fun to think about. So this week, I thought I’d figure out which states have produced the most literary masterpieces—”literary masterpiece” of course being determined by the most objective possible (read: not objective at all, but what we’ve got) criteria: those who have won one or more of the country’s three most prestigious literary prizes: the Pulitzer, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\nNB that I looked only at poetry and fiction, not because nonfiction isn’t (or can’t be) “literary,” but because it’s a huge field, and the many and varied categories proved too difficult to negotiate for this exercise. I credited each state with the works by authors born there (though they may or may not live there now), and eliminated recipients who were born in other countries, for obvious reasons. I counted a total of 421 prizes awarded. I was surprised to find that only 38 states and Washington D.C. have produced prizewinning authors. I was not surprised to see that the top states are the most populous ones (the law of averages wins again), or that Marilynne Robinson singlehandedly puts Idaho on the map, and ditto Robert Penn Warren with Kentucky.\n\nBut I’ll let you draw your own conclusions—without any further ado, I present the states with the most National Book Awards, Pulitzers, and National Book Critics Circle Awards to their names:\n\n*\n\nArticle continues below\n\nNew York – 71\n\n1921: Edith Wharton, The Age of Innocence, Pulitzer (Novel)\n\n1930: Oliver La Farge, Laughing Boy, Pulitzer (Novel)\n\n1935: Rachel Field, Time Out of Mind, National Book Award (Most Distinguished Novel)\n\n1942: William Rose Benét, The Dust Which is God, Pulitzer (Poetry)\n\n1949: Peter Viereck, Terror and Decorum, Pulitzer (Poetry)\n\n1952: Herman Wouk, The Caine Mutiny, Pulitzer (Fiction)\n\n1957: Richard Wilbur, Things of This World, Pulitzer (Poetry)\n\n1957: Richard Wilbur, Things of This World, National Book Award (Poetry)\n\n1959: Bernard Malamud, The Magic Barrel, National Book Award (Fiction)\n\n1962: Alan Dugan, Poems, Pulitzer (Poetry)\n\n1962: Alan Dugan, Poems, National Book Award (Poetry)\n\n1967: Bernard Malamud, The Fixer, Pulitzer (Fiction)\n\n1967: Bernard Malamud, The Fixer, National Book Award (Fiction)\n\n1967: James Merrill, Nights and Days, National Book Award (Poetry)\n\n1968: Anthony Hecht, The Hard Hours, Pulitzer (Poetry)\n\n1969: George Oppen, Of Being Numerous, Pulitzer (Poetry)\n\n1970: Joyce Carol Oates, them, National Book Award (Fiction)\n\n1971: William S.
