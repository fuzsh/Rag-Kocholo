        "text": "Karen L. Rollo has died September 13, 2023. Born October 31, 1947 in Seneca Falls, NY, she was the daughter of William Rollo and Virginia Minns Rollo Cosgrove. She was a graduate of Maryvale High School, Cheektowaga (Buffalo) NY; Freeman Business School, Geneva, NY; Corning Community College and was a Communications Arts Major at Cornell University, finally getting her Bachelor’s Degree in Media Technology, with “Academic Distinction” from Binghamton University, with additional studies towards a Master’s degree in Com Arts at Cornell University.\n\nDuring the 1970s, she was Communications Coordinator for Cornell Cooperative Extension of Tompkins County, responsible for writing three monthly newsletters, feature articles for the Ithaca Journal plus a weekly column; recording radio and television PSAs and co-hosting bi-weekly half-hour radio and television programs. She was also responsible for Extension’s Speaker’s Bureau and their Annual Income Tax Clinic. She worked closely with other nonprofit agencies and wrote a handbook on communications outreach for their use. In addition, she worked part-time for the tri-village newspapers covering local town and village board meetings. In 1980, she moved to Washington, DC where she worked for National Training Laboratories (affiliated with the National Education Association) as Marketing Associate and Manager of their seven day seminars. Upon returning to Sheldrake, she was hired as a Staff Writer at Cornell, where she spent the next 18 years—working mostly in the areas of energy and environmental conservation. During that time she was married to B. Jeffrey Price, an Extension Associate helping small business owners across New York State become more energy efficient, later he was an Energy Analyst for Cornell Facilities Management. After leaving Cornell, Karen worked part-time for Prevent Child Abuse NY as Training Coordinator for the Healthy Families NY program. She was a strong advocate for women’s rights and marched in support of the Equal Rights Amendment in Washington DC, which has still not been ratified more than 40 years later.\n\nShe traveled extensively, visiting most of the United States including Alaska but not Hawaii; large portions of Canada--Nova Scotia (including Rollo Bay), Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, Quebec, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Moosonee (and Moose Factory by water taxi!) She also spent some time in Mexico, exploring Acapulco and Isla Mujeres –the “Island of Women”. Her European travels included visits to England, France, Germany, Greece and Monaco. She loved their summer home in Sheldrake on Cayuga Lake enjoying swimming, sailing, motor boating, water skiing and jet skiing. Learning to swim at an early age led her to excel in water ballet throughout her junior and senior high school years.\n\nShe was predeceased by her Step-Father, Myles C. Cosgrove, her Father William Rollo, a half brother James Rollo and a cousin, Kathy Minns Bare. She is survived by her Mother, Virginia Cosgrove, cousins, Carol Lewis Brust (Chuck), Gwen Lewis Waller, Dale Minns Sandridge, David Minns, Susanne Minns Colangelo and their extended families; and lifelong friend, William H. Good.\n\nPer her request, there will be no services. Anyone wishing to make a contribution in her memory might consider the Beverly Martin Foundation or the Tompkins County SPCA."
