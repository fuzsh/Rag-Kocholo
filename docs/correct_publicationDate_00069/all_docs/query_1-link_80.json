        "text": "ROLLO Lord ROLLO.\n\nTHE sirname of Rollo is of very great antiquity, and appears to be originally from Denmark, from thence to France, and from France to Britain.\n\nFordun, that learned historian, mentions one Rello, a Dane, a man of rank and figure, in the reign of king Gregory the Great, who was crowned at Scoon in the year 875.\n\nThe same author afterwards says, that king Charles III. of France, son-in-law to Edward the elder, king of England, about the year 900 converted to the Christian faith one Rollo, a famous general of Normandy (afterwards called Robert Rollo.) To him he gave his daughter Gilla in ma••riage, and with her the whole dukedom of Normandy, to be held of the kings of France, according to the words of that celebrated author: Normaniam ei de∣dit cum Gilla filia sua, &c. afterwards, et i••se Rollo teneret Normaniam de rege Francorum sicut de domino suo, &c. and he was the first duke of Normandy.\n\nHe was succeeded in that dukedom by his eldest son William, who was father of Richard, father of a second Richard, father of the famous Robert duke of Normandy, whose natural son William conquered and became king of England, anno 1066.\n\nPuffendorf, in his introduction to the hi∣story of Europe, says,\n\n\"That William the Conqueror was son of Robert duke of Nor∣mandy, descended from Rollo, who was of Danish extraction, &c. &c.\"\n\nRobert Rollo, the first duke of Normandy, besides his successor William, had several o∣ther sons who settled in Normandy, and they and their posterity retained the sirname of Rollo.\n\nSome of their descendents came over to England with William the Conqueror, and being nearly related to that great prince, had considerable commands in his army.\n\nRichard de Rollo, a son or grand-son of one of these, came to Scotland in the reign of king David I. settled in Perth-shire, and was progenitor of all the Rollos in Scotland.\n\nIn a charter to Robert de Bruis, of the manor of Elwick, or Ailewick, Ricardus de Rollo, Walterus Espec, Petrus de Bruis, &c. are witnesses. The charter is without date; but must have been granted in or before 1141, in which year Robert de Bruis died.\n\nOf this Richard was lineally descended\n\nI. JOHN ROLLO, the undoubted ancestor of this noble family.\n\nHe flourished in the reign of king David II. who succeeded to the crown, anno 1329, and obtained a charter from that prince, di∣lecto et fideli suo, Johanni Rollo, &c. of a te∣nement in Edinburgh, dated 23d July 1369, to which William bishop of St. Andrews, Patrick bishop of Dunkeld, chancellor, Robert high steward of Scotland, earl of Strathearn, the king's nephew, William earl of Douglas, and many others, are witnesses.\n\nThis John de Rollo was clerk of council when the instrument was taken by king Ro∣bert II. in his first parliament, when John, his eldest son's title, as apparent heir to the crown, was ascertained, to which the seals of the bi∣shops and nobility are appended, anno 1371.\n\nIn a charter to Laurence de la Haya, dat∣ed in the year 1376, John de Rollo is a wit∣ness.\n\nHe died soon thereafter, leaving issue a son,\n\nII. JOHN ROLLO of Duncrub, who suc∣ceeded him. He is the first we have found so designed; and that hath ever since been one of the chief titles of the family.\n\nHe got a charter under the great seal from king Robert II. confirming to him the lands of Duncrub, Fyndony, Pitenclethy, Lidea∣thy, Pitmedie, &c. in the earldom of Strath∣earn, and shire of Perth,\n\n\"to the said John, and Duncan Rollo, his eldest son, and the heirs-male of his body, lawfully begotten; which failing, to the said John Rollo his nearest heirs whatsomever.\"\n\nThe confir∣mation is dated at Methven, the 13th day of February, the tenth year of the king's reign, 1381.\n\nThis John was clerk and secretary to king Robert III. from whom he got a grant of ten pounds sterling per annum, out of the customs of Innerkeithing, for his good and ••aithful services, dated 20th August 1400; to which the bishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow, Ro∣bert earl of Fife and Menteith, Archibald earl of Douglas, &c. are witnesses.\n\nHe died in the beginning of the reign of king James I. and was succeeded by his son,\n\nIII. DUNCAN ROLLO of Duncrub, design∣ed son and heir apparent of John, in the char∣ter 1381, above narrated.\n\nHe is witness in a charter by Robert duke of Albany, governor of Scotland, to John earl of Buchan, his son, anno 1413.\n\nHe died before the year 1437, leaving is∣sue a son,\n\nIV.
