        "text": "Lord Rollo, of Duncrub in the County of Perth, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created on 10 January 1651 for Sir Andrew Rollo, with remainder to his heirs male whatsoever.[1] His great-great-grandson, the fifth Lord, was a Brigadier-General in the Army and fought in North America during the Seven Years' War. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Lord. His grandson, the eighth Lord, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1841 to 1846. His son, the ninth Lord, was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1847 to 1852. His son, the tenth Lord, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1860 to 1868. On 29 June 1869 he was created Baron Dunning, of Dunning and Pitcairns in the County of Perth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with remainder to the heirs male of his body.[2] This title gave the Lords an automatic seat in the House of Lords until 1999. As of 2017 the titles are held by the tenth Lord's great-great-grandson, the fourteenth Lord, who succeeded his father in 1997. He is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Rollo.\n\nThe family seat was Duncrub Castle, near Dunning, Perthshire.[3]\n\nLords Rollo (1651)\n\n[edit]\n\nAndrew Rollo, 1st Lord Rollo (1577–1659)\n\nJames Rollo, 2nd Lord Rollo (1600–1669)\n\nAndrew Rollo, 3rd Lord Rollo (d. 1700)\n\nRobert Rollo, 4th Lord Rollo (c. 1680–1758)\n\nAndrew Rollo, 5th Lord Rollo (c. 1703–1765)\n\nJohn Rollo, Master of Rollo (d. 1762)\n\nJohn Rollo, 6th Lord Rollo (1708–1783)\n\nJames Rollo, 7th Lord Rollo (1738–1784)\n\nJohn Rollo, 8th Lord Rollo (1773–1846)\n\nWilliam Rollo, 9th Lord Rollo (1809–1852)\n\nJohn Rollo, 10th Lord Rollo, 1st Baron Dunning (1835–1916)\n\nWilliam Charles Wordsworth Rollo, 11th Lord Rollo, 2nd Baron Dunning (1860–1946)\n\nJohn Eric Henry Rollo, 12th Lord Rollo, 3rd Baron Dunning (1889–1947)\n\nEric John Stapylton Rollo, 13th Lord Rollo, 4th Baron Dunning (1915–1997)\n\nDavid Eric Howard Rollo, 14th Lord Rollo, 5th Baron Dunning (b. 1943)\n\nThe heir apparent is the present holder's eldest son, the Hon.
