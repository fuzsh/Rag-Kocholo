        "text": "May cherished literature for its profound psychological insights.\n\nKey points\n\nAs the founder of American existential psychology and existential psychotherapy, May was a major thinker of our time.\n\nHis books are filled with allusions to novels, plays, and classic myths for their timeless insights.\n\nMay particularly valued their depictions of our struggles with anxiety, creativity, love, and authenticity.\n\nRollo May was a towering figure in American social thought. Raised in small-town midwestern America, he was perhaps the most well-known psychological thinker in the world at the time of his death in 1994. Originating both existential psychology and existential psychotherapy in the United States, May is generally ranked with Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers as co-founding humanistic psychology.\n\nHis seminal ideas on the role of anxiety in human life, as well as the daimonic in all creative activity, have gained new importance—partly due to the effects of the global pandemic on mental health. Though the influence of May's mentors like Alfred Adler, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan, and theologian Paul Tillich has been well documented, the impact of novelists on May’s evolving outlook has received meager attention.\n\nThis scholarly neglect is surprising, particularly in view of May’s allusions to plays, novels, and classic myths throughout his books. Indeed, May explicitly stated in a mid-career essay, \"The Significance of Symbols,\" that “Many of us made the odd discovery in those college days that we learned a good deal more about psychology—that is [human] experience—from our literature courses than we did from (academic) psychology itself.”\n\nHaving graduated with a B.A. in English from Oberlin College, May regarded this intellectual focus as crucial for effective therapeutic work. “I advise students [wishing to become psychoanalysts] to major in literature and the humanities...” he stated, \" [to grasp] the symbols and myths in...present and historical literature.\" Otherwise, May later wrote, treatment becomes reduced to little more than petty \"gimmicks\" (his term).\n\nIn lectures and widely read books such as Love and Will and The Cry for Myth, May often presented his concepts by combining case studies with literary sources. Similarly, when I interviewed him at his home for my biography of Abraham Maslow, May expounded on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in differentiating existential psychology from the \"softer\" perspectives of Maslow and especially Rogers.\n\nThough many novelists contributed to May's worldview, the following seven seem most important in light of his published writings concerning their message. They're highlighted here alphabetically rather than by primacy in May's work.\n\nAlbert Camus. He was a vital existentialist thinker for May, especially in extolling compassion and empathy as essential traits to cultivate in a world beset by human suffering. Among Camus's literary achievements that May found most inspirational were The Plague (1947), an allegorical novel that attracted renewed interest when the COVID-19 pandemic arose, and the short story collection The Exile and the Kingdom (1956). Such statements by Camus that \"The truth is that everyone is bored\" and \"You can't understand. You're using the language of reason, not of the heart\" were central to May's worldview.\n\nFyodor Dostoevsky. Having briefly served as a First Congregational Church minister before shifting permanently to psychology as a career, May was drawn especially to The Brothers Karamazov (1879–1880), which he praised for its \"breathtakingly profound characterizations\" related to faith, atheism, morality, and organized religion in Czarist Russia. The Brothers Karamazov as a deeply philosophical novel must also have touched May due to his own conflict-ridden Christian upbringing and lonely childhood. Among its messages was: \"The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.\"\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald. It might be no exaggeration to say that The Great Gatsby (1925) was May's favorite novel—which he called \"incomparable\" and cited repeatedly as a key to understanding the American psyche in all its paradoxical complexities. For example, May wrote in his book Paulus that \"Most Americans...pride themselves on perpetually smiling, feeling 'great,' when they get up in the morning to 'live out their potentialities.' This masks in most of them an endemic depression...at the least, an emotionally dishonest way of encountering the world.\" And, yet, May also saw Fitzgerald's work as vividly presenting American optimism and desire for world betterment.\n\nFranz Kafka. In May's books beginning with The Meaning of Anxiety, he extolled Kakfa as among the great existential literary artists of the modern era—and saw his immense posthumous popularity as proof of societal changes in consciousness. Kirk Schneider, who co-authored May's final book, The Psychology of Existence, recently commented: \"May viewed Kafka's The Castle as an illustration of our estrangement, not just from other people, but also from our centuries-long estrangement from nature and existence. May was concerned that the turn toward Rationalism in the so-called Dark Ages had thrown the proverbial baby out with the bathwater—that is, our primal relationship to nature.\"\n\nThomas Mann. Reflecting a profound interest in the internal workings of creativity, Mann's novels greatly appealed to May, who undoubtedly knew of the German writer's friendship with Sigmund Freud. May often referred to the Northern European legend of Faust (who sold his soul to the devil for unlimited knowledge and sensual pleasures) and in The Cry for Myth, devoted an entire chapter to Mann's retelling in his novel Dr. Faustus (1947). It was both a critique of complacent life in modern Germany and an allegory of the Nazi rise to power. May commented, \"Mann believed that the best measure of the spiritual health or illness of a culture is its art. The chief symptom of (our time)...is the trivialization of art.\"\n\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn. May's mentors Adler and Tillich both stressed the importance of courage in living fully, and in May's book The Courage to Create, he lauded the Russian dissident Solzhenitsyn as an exemplar of moral courage for chronicling the inhumanity and cruelty of Soviet political repression. Alluding to such novels as A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, May wrote that such courage came not only from Solzhenitsyn's \"audaciousness, but also out of his compassion for the human suffering he saw about him during his own experience in the Soviet prison camp.\"\n\nLeo Tolstoy. As a moral and spiritual thinker, Tolstoy held major importance for May. He often referred to Tolstoy's two longest novels, War and Peace (1865–1869) and Anna Karenina (1875–1877) for their idealism, yet searing depictions of human emotions and virtues. In Love and Will, May cited Tolstoy's notion that all individuals are inescapably affected by their era, yet almost by a force of nature, some are \"hurled to greatness\" (May's phrase) by it. For May's existentialism, this was a major message of War and Peace: our sojourn through time as well as place.\n\nIn drawing upon these diverse writers for inspiration and insight, May clearly regarded their works as valuable for personal growth. He saw the creative process as inevitably mixed with anxiety—and struggle with one's inner daimonic as well as societal forces impelling conformity. Growing from this struggle requires allies, May always insisted, and he regarded literature as among the most helpful. For both May and Maslow, reading fiction was a way to find their muse. And, for many of us, it may also prove likewise.\n\nTwo years before May's death at age 85, he wrote, \"In the deepest levels of the human adventure, the sense of awe and wonder are present.\" Throughout his influential career spanning nearly six decades, he viewed literature as a valuable guide on that adventure.\n\nReferences\n\nAbzug, R.H.
