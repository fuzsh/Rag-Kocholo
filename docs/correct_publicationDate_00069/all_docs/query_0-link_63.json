        "text": "Before World War I, Rollo Dunford Wood tells me, the sight of vivid bow-top vardos trundling down Britain’s potholed lanes would have been fairly common. ‘It was the golden age of caravans,’ he says, pouring scorching coffee heated on an old-fangled enamel stove in his Oxfordshire workshop. ‘Until about 1920, when the motor car started making them look a bit passé, wagons were the best way of travelling round the country.’ Rollo, having hopped atop the base of a vast interwar farm cart, explains excitedly how, at the turn of the 20th century, the engineering skills of makers reached their peak – so much so that when trends in transport shifted, those that didn’t move sideways into carved fairground rides went on to design motorcars. They already had the vehicular know-how; the horsepower was just less equine.\n\nThe wagons Rollo restores in this barn were historically used by Roma families, farmers, showmen and circus folk, as well as the odd road mender or travelling labourer – anyone who needed a bed on the hoof. Rollo himself is a Gorga, or non-Roma (wagon makers and caravan builders weren’t traditionally from the community), but his knowledge of their vehicles is extensive, if not encyclopaedic. Past craftsmen trip off his tongue – Orton, Spooner, Wheeler, Tong – as do the differences between their vernaculars. Yet, he adds, ‘I’ve still got so much to learn.’\n\nRollo’s knowledge, he says, has been absorbed through his hands, which look strong and accustomed to manual labour. Having left school ‘ASAP’, Rollo was apprenticed at a local pottery and then with a cabinetmaker, who gave him his first job. When he started, he knew nothing about woodwork, but he soon learned. ‘It was fantastic. It taught my hands how to look,’ he explains, ‘and my eye what to look for.’ Rollo is the kind of person who pulls out every drawer, not to see what’s inside but to discover how it’s been made.\n\n‘Fitted furniture is a wonderful thing,’ he explains. ‘It’s brilliantly creative and it taught me my trade. But ultimately, there was something missing.’ Ten years ago, when his first marriage ended, Rollo moved to a static caravan on a friend’s farm. ‘I needed a reset,’ he says, ‘to live simply.’ It was a sensibility he shared with his now wife, the artist Freyja Lee, who introduced Rollo to mid-century showman’s wagons, with their straight sides like railway carriages. ‘I bought one and she bought one and we set them up together, side by side, with a fire pit and sofas in the middle and a wood-fired bathtub. It was proper stuff.’ He smiles.\n\nIn January 2018, Freyja was heavily pregnant with their first son, while Rollo, still in the furniture business, was scrambling about to build a barn they could move into. Having managed to finish the roof, ‘I started to feel a bit off,’ he says. A biopsy of a growth in his chest – done on the day Freyja gave birth to Brody – led to a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n‘Isn’t it interesting how pivotal points in life can bring on a different phase?’ Ever sanguine, Rollo is talking about how he came to work on wagons. ‘I hate doing nothing. I was terrible at being ill,’ he says. ‘So, to distract myself I bought a 33-foot showman’s wagon that needed doing up.’ He laughs. Despite having no real idea how, Rollo set about saving the badly damaged two-bedroom wagon. In return, I suggest, the wagon saved him in some ways. ‘Well, that and the brilliance of the NHS.’ As it was a personal project, he could work on it a few days a week when he was feeling up to it. ‘It’s a cliché, but I really did realise life is too short not to be doing the things that inspire you.’ He’s devoted himself to wagons ever since.\n\nWhat is it exactly that inspires him about them? The challenge, certainly. Rollo has recently bought an extremely rare, highly carved Reading-style Roma vardo, built after 1880 by Thomas Tong. Many parts are missing or present but in the wrong place. Among them are two exquisite porch brackets so intricately chiselled that talking about them leaves Rollo’s eyes as wide as, well, wagon wheels. There’s a cardboard box that, he hopes, contains all the original cut glass, ready to reinstate – ‘though it might not’. Either way, the wagon’s re-glorification will require not just Rollo’s focus and skills but those of the supremely talented blacksmiths, painters, wheelwrights and glassworkers in this realm that Rollo has come to know. Many of their professions are threatened; while the smithies can keep busy and decorative artists diversify into sign painting, the glass cutters, for instance, are something of a dying breed. It’s a privilege, Rollo says, ‘to champion people making with their hands’.\n\nReally, though, it’s the individual personalities of the vardos themselves that fire him up. Though reluctant to comment on Roma civilisation, Rollo’s enthusiasm for these handmade homes on wheels is straightforward and genuine. ‘I’m very conscious of encroaching on the culture of others. I’m not from that background. All I know is that these wagons evoke a sense of adventure in me,’ he says. ‘They’re beautiful, covered in such amazing examples of the country’s folk art. And they’re full of stories. They’ve been homes to people – and they carry that history in their fabric. I’m lucky enough to have the skills to keep them going for a bit longer.’\n\nGiven the rarity of vardos in Britain, finding restoration projects will only get tougher. That particular Thomas Tong wagon in Scotland has got Rollo Dunford Wood thinking. ‘While there are a few wagon makers still around, I’m not sure there’s anyone making them to that standard anymore. I’ve realised that that’s what I want to do.’ First on his list is a straight-sided Burton, beloved by showmen. It will be a challenge – though one senses that’s so much the point. ‘With every wagon I work on, I realise how much more there is to learn. Each one broadens my horizons and that’s pretty wonderful. Isn’t that what life’s really about?’\n\nRollo Dunford Wood.
