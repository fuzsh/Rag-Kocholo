        "text": "In this paper I propose that the Rolli-in the Thracian/Paeonian toponym Rolligeras quite certainly means \"hot\", from a root that meant \"hot, burning, pungent\", with additional semantics possible in the root and likely present in the root. In the putative anthroponym Rolisteneas (a Thracian/Paeonian or Greco-Thracian/Greco-Paeonian anthroponym), Roli-likely meant \"blood\", which would have developed from \"red\" and from \"hot\" (blood is red and warm, and full of a warm active energy), with \"red\" developing from \"burning\". For this Rolli-and Roli-, I propose a root *h₁rew-, \"burning, hot\", further back possibly/very likely meaning something like \"virile energy (the yang force, as the Chinese call it: the yang force is colored red and identified with the sun)\". The extended form of *h₁rew-is the well-known PIE *h₁rewdʰ-\"red\".\n\nIn two of his blogs, dated July 21, 2013 and April 20, 2014, the genetic genealogist Michael R. Maglio presented the results of a pooled DNA analysis of presently living descendants of some of the best known companions of William the Conqueror. His reasoning was based on the assumption that these companions were either cousins from the House of Normandy or that maybe William had slept with their wives, só that their descendants might all share the same genetic material. Since William the Conqueror was a fifth-generation descendant of Rollo, the author then extrapolated the results back to the founder of the House of Normandy. His conclusion was that Rollo was a Dane of Norwegian stock, probably pleasing both sides of the ongoing argument about his geographic origin.\n\nThe present chapter gathers under the heading “etymology” premodern texts from different ages and places that all had a tremendous and lasting impact on the intellectual life of the countless people who were brought up in the respective cultures. The common denominator of all those texts is that they deal with the subject of the origin and meaning of individual words. The scholarly practice of etymology seems to have been very widespread geographically and historically in earlier times, and it continues to remain an object of great interest for ordinary people throughout the world even today.1 The different kinds of spoken languages and writing systems that have been involved and the different roles and ambitions of scholars in their cultures have led to considerable variation in the nature of the practice. Moreover, in the past two centuries, as the historical study of language has developed into an academic discipline, at first in Europe but then also in those other parts of the world most influenced by European ideas, a new science of etymology has become established that differs radically in theory and method from all earlier practices.2 During the earlier period, plurilingualism played only sometimes, but not always, a decisive role in analyzing and understanding language diversity on the level of the individual word; but in later forms during that period plurilingualism tended to become much more prominent, and it has become an indispensable foundation of more recent scientific practice. The purpose of this introduction is to sketch out briefly a panoramic overview of the changing nature of etymology in the context of the reality of plurilingualism, considering its cultural and linguistic variations and its historical development, especially in premodern times, and thereby to set into a wider context the readings that are provided in this part …"
