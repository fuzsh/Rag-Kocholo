She received her undergraduate degree and master’s degree in history from the University of Nice, France.\n\nAfter moving to the United States, Professor Rollo-Koster enrolled at SUNY Binghamton where she studied with Richard C. Trexler, one of the founders of behaviorist history. Following her social science track, she earned her Ph.D. focusing on the social and demographic history of the papal city of Avignon, capital of Christianity between 1309-­‐1378. Her thesis, “The People of Curial Avignon: A Critical Edition of the Liber Divisionis and the lists of Matriculation of the Confraternity of Notre Dame la Majour,” analyzed three late medieval censuses where she collected data on some 8,000 individuals. This data framed her early research and publications.\n\nHaving studied total history, along with applied social scientific methodologies to text and documentation, Professor Rollo-Koster considers herself a social scientist, one who analyzes long-term effects, mentalities, demography, geography, economic conditions, etc.\n\nRECENT AWARDS and HONORS:\n\nChevalier des Palmes Académiques (2016)\n\nUniversity of Rhode Island Research and Scholarship Excellence Award: Advanced Career Faculty, in the Social Sciences, Arts, and Humanities (2017)\n\nEURIAS Fellow at the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study (2017-2018)\n\nURI Foundation Scholarly Excellence Award (2018)\n\nFellow, Medieval Academy of America (2024)\n\nNEWS:\n\n“Medieval Europe was far from democratic, but that didn’t mean tyrants got a free pass,” The Conversation, April 12, 2024.\n\n“Gifts that live on, from best bodices to money for bridge repairs: Women’s wills in medieval France give a glimpse into their surprising independence,” The Conversation, February 27, 2024.\n\nTEDEd – Why were there three popes at the same time?\n\nDigitizing the Vatican Library Brings the Past Back to Life (with Bill Lacey)\n\n“The Antipope of Mar-a-Lago.
