The work is the result of over twenty years research of our own and based on work carried out by the many Scottish clan and family socities based in Scotland and all around the world. Many clan histories have recently (2010-2016) been completely re-researched by the late Romilly Squire (co-author of the Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopaedia). They are currently and constantly under revision by leading academics in the field, Charles Edward Lynch MLitt. and Dr Miles Kerr-Peterson."
