        "text": "Two men caught in one of Scotland's biggest drug busts have been jailed for a total of 11-and-a-half years.\n\nWilliam Henderson, 47, and Stephen Rollo, 40, were arrested after police seized heroin worth Â£1.5m and cocaine worth Â£160,000 from an industrial unit in the city's Dalmarnock area.\n\nJudge Lady Clark told the pair their crime was a \"commercial operation\" which brought misery to others.\n\nSurveillance was initially set up on Henderson who was renting the unit.\n\nThe pair were later spotted travelling to Carlisle, where a black box was loaded into a white van.\n\nPolice in Lancashire stopped the van and the box was found to contain Â£125,000 in cash.\n\nRollo was later seen transferring items from the Glasgow unit into a van owned by Henderson.\n\nPolice raided the unit and Rollo tried to flee but was caught. Officers then recovered keys from the premises."
