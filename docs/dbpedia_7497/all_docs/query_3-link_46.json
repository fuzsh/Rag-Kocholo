Hitchcock cuts in to a close-up of Norman’s eye, a shot taken from the side; the tiny glint of light from the illuminated bathroom flickers in his pupil, an effect emphasized by the black-and-white photography. Bates watches a moment. Hitchcock briefly cuts in to his point of view, revealing Marion’s back, as seen by Norman, and us, through the peephole. Carrying forward the obsession with seeing that had long characterized his cinema,1 Hitchcock uses the camera to tell his audience where and when to look. In another universe, Hitchcock might have used a zoom lens to achieve this effect; it is not hard to imagine an alternative version of the point of view shot through the peephole,slowly zooming in closer on Marion’s back as she undresses. Perhaps the restrictions of the Motion Picture Production Code would have prevented him from indulging in such prurient, seductive use of the camera; indeed, he was already pushing it considerably. By the time of the explosion of giallo cinema a decade later in Italy,the zoom lens would become a ubiquitous hallmark of the genre, as inseparable from the films as its black-gloved killers, mysterious narratives, and depictions of erotically charged violence.Technological advancements in the usability of zoom lenses BRIAN BREMS 14 increased filmmakers’ interest in it as a tool (Hall 2018, 88).2 Hollywood filmmakers working in the 1970s, most notably Robert Altman, used the zoom lens to such a degree that it became an identifiable part of their visual styles. Though the zoom lens was controversial among cinematographers3 and critics alike (Hall 2018, 8, 136), the most expressive filmmakers found ways to integrate it into their work, using the zoom to create emotional or psychological effects; others simply admired its practicality, especially for shooting on location. Giallo filmmakers undoubtedly were attracted to all of these qualities. In Hollywood cinema,according to Nick Hall’s (2018) history of the zoom lens, “[t]wo main attitudes to the zoom can be detected in the films of the 1970s. Some directors used the zoom without hesitation,zooming as frequently and obviously as they wanted to. Others did their best to conceal its use—using zoom lenses as an alternative to a set of prime lenses, coordinating zoom moves to take place at the same time as pans, or simply zooming as little as possible”(137).The gialli directors certainly belong to the former camp,ostentatiously flaunting their uses of the zoom to such a flagrant degree that its visual presence is inextricable from the genre,a clear and identifiable marker of a giallo. In America,“there was no genre with which the zoom could be most closely associated” (Hall, 2018, 139), but in Italy, the giallo film relied on the zoom to create an intensely subjective experience for the viewer by subordinating the spectator’s gaze to absolute control.The zoom lens’s shifting focal point magnifies not only the objects it captures within the frame, but also the directorial hand behind the camera; it commands the spectator’s look while simultaneously alerting the spectator to its manipulative function . Unlike the “invisible style” of classic Hollywood continuity that seeks to hide the seams of editing and downplay camera movement, the giallo’s zoom shot announces itself loudly, opening the genre and its techniques up for parody and pastiche.4 In this analysis, I offer a survey of the use of the zoom lens in the giallo film in an effort to articulate its general meanings across a number of examples of the genre, while singling out one film in particular for close reading. While the zoom lens and the giallo have often both been fodder for contemptuous critics, the consistent presence of the zoom lens within a number of giallo films demonstrates a rather sophisticated use by multiple filmmakers of then-new technology to enact genre. According to Italian cinema historian Peter Bondanella (2009..."
