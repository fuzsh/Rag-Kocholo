We will study the development of the lurid motifs of the Gothic that works affiliated with this genre often deploy to invoke a sense of horror and dread, moral corruption, and psychological abjection, all seemingly meant to assimilate the South and its citizens to the category of a degenerate and menacing otherness. The imagery of dismal landscapes, dark swamps, decaying architecture, fanatical and occult religious practices, and the often grotesque or monstrous figures and cultural tropes that aspire to associate the South with an imaginary medieval past, will be examined mostly as marks of an ambivalent ideological struggle surrounding the self-identity of America. Thanks to this regime of gothic tropes and insignia, America, on the one hand, heralds its own self-identity as culturally rich and historically continuous, and yet, it is, at least partly thanks to this same regimen of gothic tropes (understood as figures of otherness), on the other hand, that America also typically (or stereotypically) deals with anxieties arising from its attempts to define its own modern identity, and its identity as modern and exceptional. Such anxieties give rise to instances of negative stereotyping, and practices of cultural exclusion that the course critically interrogates. We also study several important ways in which the Gothic serves as an important voice for the marginalized, while enabling critical reflections on the social and cultural practices of exclusion we have alluded to. The history of slavery, the civil war, and its aftermath, as well as literature produced by certain Southern writers (such as William Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Katherine Anne Porter, and others) since the late 19th century, will be identified as important defining contexts of emergence for the Southern gothic, and as the indispensable conditions that have made its deployment into 20th century film and television possible. Due attention will also be paid to the influence of French colonial adventures and interventions in shaping cultures and \"gothic\" mythologies of the American South, and the Caribbean, as well as the role played by America's own efforts to secure and maintain hegemonic influences on the region.\n\nThe course is conducted in English, and requires no prior knowledge of the field. All films are streamed to your computer from the UMass library on demand. Required readings are provided online, and no book purchases are necessary. (Gen. Ed.

An in-depth examination of Classical Hollywood cinema as a distinct mode of film practice, with its own cinematic style and industrial conditions, this course will concentrate on the period from 1917 to the early 1960s. We will look at aspects of the modes of production, the stylistic practices, and the technological developments that defined this period of the Hollywood studio system (as well as during its period of decline), paying special attention to the way this preeminent form of cinema established many of the norms of the immersive film experience. Among other subjects, we will consider the development of classical continuity during the silent era, the ascent of the “talkie,” the establishment of the vertically integrated studio system and the idea of “house style,” the formation of various narrative genres, such as film noir, as well as the effects of such historical phenomena as the Great Depression, World War II, and McCarthyism. We will watch one or two films each week and discuss them (19 films total).\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR CATEGORY: H1, E\n\nFILM-ST 353 – African Film\n\nInstructor: Patrick Mensah\n\nCredits: 4\n\nMeeting: Tuesday 4:00 pm-6:50 pm\n\nDiscussion: Thursday 2:30 pm-3:45 pm and Thursday 4:00 pm-5:15 pm\n\nThis course offers an introduction to African film as an aesthetic and cultural practice. Students should expect to be familiarized with the key ideas and objectives that have inspired and driven that practice since the early 1960s, and be furnished with the technical tools and methodological skills that would permit them to understand, analyze, and think critically about the artistic and thematic aspects of the films that are screened. They should also expect the course to provide\n\nthem with a critical peek into several cardinal issues of social and cultural relevance in contemporary Africa and its history. Issues of interest typically include, the nationstate and its declining status, imperatives of decolonization, economic dependency and structural adjustment programs, orality and changing traditional cultures, diasporic migrations, urbanization and its problems, gender relations, civil wars, child soldiers, gangs, and related themes. Filmmakers studied include, but are not limited to, Abderrahmane Sissako, Gillo Pontecorvo, Ousmane Sembene, Raoul Peck, Jean-Marie Teno, Dani Kouyate, Mweze Ngangura, Gavin Hood, Neill Blomkamp, Moufida Tlatli, Djibril Diop Mambety (please note that this list is subject to change, and shall be updated as future changes are made).

We will explore the historical, cultural, and political contexts in which these films were produced, and analyze how they reflect and shape the social and political realities of their respective countries. Through screenings, readings, and discussions, we will examine the unique aesthetic and narrative strategies employed by Latin American filmmakers, and consider the ways in which they challenge dominant cinematic conventions. The course will trace the emergence of cinema in Latin America in the early 20th century, by exploring the ways in which film was used as a tool for propaganda, education, and nation-building. It will examine the various movements and genres that have emerged throughout Latin America's cinematic history, including the New Latin American Cinema, the Third Cinema, and the contemporary Latin American film industry. Through the analysis of key films, we will consider how these movements have engaged with questions of identity, history, memory, and social justice.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY:\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR CATEGORY:\n\nFILM-ST 387 – The Western in Transnational Cinema\n\nInstructor: Barry Spence\n\nCredits: 4\n\nMeeting: Online\n\nThe Western is one of the oldest of film genres. Usually considered the first Western movie, The Great Train Robbery, released in 1903, is arguably the film that established cinema as a commercial industry of formidable potential. From its earliest instances the Western has been a key cultural expression of the American mythos and has played an integral role in the formation of American identity. We can look at the Western as a cultural form rich in themes concerning: the construction of gender identity; racial politics; the establishment of social order in conflict with the lure of frontier self-determination; the romance of the outlaw; narratives of redemption; vigilante retribution versus the rule of law; human resiliency in and conquest of the natural world; the subjugation (or extermination) of indigenous peoples' and this is to name only an obvious few. But the Western has also been a pivotal form in the history of storytelling media in a very diverse range of nations and cultural contexts, from Japan to India to Italy to Germany to Australia to South Africa to Brazil to Mexico.\n\nThis course will, on the one hand, examine the cultural history and legacy of the Western genre in the cinema of the United States. We will study iconic and revisionist examples, looking at both formal and thematic aspects of this cinema as well as its historical relationship to American identity and its social policies and politics. On the other hand, a large part of this course will focus on the Western in relation to a highly diverse range of cinema cultures throughout the world. In particular, we will study the genre's impact on, but also its inheritance from, the cinema traditions of Italy, Japan, China, India, South Korea, and nations of the Global South. This course is designed to challenge conventional understanding of the Western genre by exposing students to interdisciplinary theories oriented toward comprehending the diverse cultural, social, and political perspectives embodied by the transnational engagement with the Western.

Students will work on their own script projects using a series of steps which will guide them through plot and character development and provide a clear path to sound story and character development. Forums for online discussion will be dedicated to discussion of students’ ongoing writing project work and analysis of assigned readings.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR CATEGORY: E\n\nFILM-ST 411 – 16MM Filmmaking and Technology\n\nInstructor: David Bendiksen\n\nCredits: 3\n\nMeeting: Wednesday 1:00 pm - 3:45 pm\n\nThis course is an introductory workshop in 16mm single-camera filmmaking, linear editing, and film projection intended for students interested in pursuing further creative production and coursework in film, especially toward completion of the Major or Certificate in Film Studies. Because the skills utilized in analog filmmaking can build upon but are in part discrete from those learned in video production, most students will have prior experience with photography or videography, though this is not strictly required. Creative work is complemented by a rigorous selection of readings and screenings. Exploration of technological possibilities to broaden student creativity will be emphasized, and the development of personal vision and style will be stressed.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR CATEGORY: E\n\nFILM-ST 416 Untold Screenwriting\n\nInstructor: Daniel Pope\n\nCredits: 3\n\nMeeting: Thursday 3:00 pm - 5:30 pm\n\nThis is a course in writing unconventional screenplays, singular film scripts that not only take innovative forms but also tell stories not often found in established film and media production. We will read from an international selection of screenplays, examine clips from unconventional films, and address questions of representation, inclusion, and the work of writing underrepresented characters and untold narratives for the screen. \"Untold\" signifies in two ways: it can mean boundless or limitless, and it can refer to a narrative that is not yet recounted. We are witnessing the beginnings of a film and media renaissance, with new works emerging and evolving that tell stories not commonly told and take innovative forms that can surprise, edify, delight, and enrich us. We will write screenplays for such works, starting with an appreciation for established forms and conventions of screenwriting, and pushing to expand the boundaries of what stories films can tell, and how.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR CATEGORY: E\n\nFILM-ST 417 – Short documentary Filmmaking\n\nInstructor: David Casals Roma\n\nCredits: 3\n\nMeeting: Online\n\nIn the same way that fiction films are the mirror of our imagination, documentaries are the mirror of our surrounding reality. But making a documentary requires a creative point of view by the director and the knowledge of some filmmaking techniques. In this course, you will learn how to develop your ideas for documentary, how to write a script, how to plan the production, how to shoot interviews and how to structure your movie in the editing room. Moreover, you will write, shoot and edit a 5-minute documentary during the course. It is important that you can have access to a camera, a computer and editing software to edit your documentary.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR CATEGORY: E\n\nFILM-ST 446 – Film Documentary\n\nInstructor: Bruce Geisler\n\nCredits: 3\n\nMeeting: Tuesday 2:30 pm-4:30 pm\n\nWe will view, analyze, and discuss films by modern documentary masters such as Michael Moore (\"Sicko\"), Chris Paine, (\"Revenge of the Electric Car\"), Seth Gordon (\"The King of Kong - A Fistful of Quarters\"), Pamela Yates (\"Granito\") and many others to further the understanding of the documentary craft and art from a filmmaker's perspective. Students will also do pre production (research and treatment) for their own short documentary, along with shorter hands-on exercises in writing narration, interview techniques, etc.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR CATEGORY: D&G, E\n\nFILM-ST 490V – Visiting Filmmaker Series “VIDEOGRAPHIC TELEPHILIA”\n\nInstructor: Ariel Avissar\n\nCredits: 3\n\nMeeting: TBA\n\nThe course will introduce and offer practice in the videographic study of television, a relatively underdeveloped subfield within videographic film and moving image studies. The course will combine intensive hands-on practice with theoretical studies and written assignments, aiming to creatively integrate videographic creation with theoretical and analytical thought. Students will focus on works of television of their own choosing, experimenting with various aspects of videographic TV studies. Students should have rudimentary proficiency in the use of a digital editing platform, or a willingness to independently learn basic editing as they go along.\n\nCOURSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: Students will learn and practice basic videographic skills; become familiar with notable existing works of videographic television studies; apply videographic practices as a means of studying serialized television texts; and create videographic works that express their critical and analytical insights.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR CATEGORY: E\n\nFILM-ST 590N – New Directions in Videographic Scholarship\n\nInstructor: Daniel Pope with Ariel Avissar and Barbara Zecchi\n\nCredits: 3\n\nMeeting: Tuesday 4 pm-6:30 pm\n\nFilm criticism, film scholarship, filmmaking—from its inception at the turn of the millennium the video essay in its many forms offers an expanding array of creative, intellectual, and scholarly means of self-expression. In this graduate seminar, we will create videographic essays in film scholarship. What is possible when the mode of enquiry departs from the printed word and inhabits the form of the media it examines? Making a videographic essay is much like making a film, often with similarities to documentary and the essay film. As such, we will engage not only film analysis and film scholarship but also video editing, visual composition, sound design, and other aspects of moving image media. We will examine a wide array of videographic essays and explore the unique analytical and expressive opportunities the medium offers. With this foundation, we develop the critical, creative, and technical skills necessary for making effective video essays addressing films and film theory, directors, genres, national cinemas, and cultural and social issues. Open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR CATEGORY: E\n\nArt\n\nArt 230-01 - Image Capturing, Analog\n\nInstructor: Jenny Vogel\n\nCredits: 3\n\nMeeting: TuTh 1:00PM - 3:45PM\n\nIntroduction to photographic tools and methods.
