        "text": "Extreme Horror and Exploring the Margins of Culture\n\nHorror narratives operate by unsettling us with discomforting images and ideas. Fans generally approach this type of entertainment purposefully to be shocked, scared, and disgusted. Inventive gore and kills often provide the most direct ways to give a shock to one’s system and get the adrenaline flowing. As renowned horror special effects artist Tom Savini asserts, “That’s where the excitement comes from. How is the next one going to get it? You look forward to that” (Going To Pieces: The Rise & Fall of the Slasher Film, 2006, dir. Jeff McQueen). However, both horror creators and scholars highlight that fans seek out these stories because they provide a fictional and safe way to experience negative emotions that normally we want to avoid. Even if the special effects are realistic, people still know they are watching a fictional movie.\n\nAdditionally, well-crafted jump scares can also serve an adrenaline function, especially if the filmmakers have previously lulled audiences into a false sense of security. Horror director/producer Sean Cunningham (Friday the 13th, 1980) argues that the most successful horror films provide moments that tell audiences “We’re having fun, are you?” which gives audiences a thrill so they leave the theater “on a high”(Going to Pieces). In these cases, filmmakers manipulate audiences’ expectations to give them the jolt of fear they desire in a way that pleasantly surprises them.\n\nHorror director John Carpenter (Halloween, 1978) stresses this contract between filmmaker and audience is a delicate balance: “A horror film’s job is to scare you, is to get your pulse going…that becomes an enjoyable experience. Maybe not too scary, the audience says to you, ‘Don’t scare me too much. Just a little bit, I kinda like it a little bit’” (The American Nightmare, 2000; dir. Adam Simon). But what happens when a filmmaker goes a bit too far and violates our expectations of an enjoyable, safe scare? When filmmakers violate this contract, horror director John Landis (An American Werewolf in London, 1981) argues that audiences may feel “the people making the movie are untrustworthy” and that they are “in the hands of a maniac” (The American Nightmare).\n\nAudience “safety lines” are going to be different for each person, and they also shift over time culturally. Though many people still laud the terrifying power of the original The Exorcist (1973; dir. William Friedkin), we no longer hear stories in the news about people regularly vomiting or running out of theaters screaming while watching it (Woodward, 1974, Newsweek). The organized protests over films like Snuff (1975; originally titled Slaughter by filmmakers Michael and Roberta Findlay, later released with additional footage and marketed as a potentially “real” snuff film by producer/distributor Allan Shackleton) and Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984; dir. Charles E. Sellier, Jr.) have now become mere curiosities and documentary fodder for film historians and genre fans. Today, most people watch these films and find their violence and gore somewhat quaint compared to the more recent mainstream horror films such as the Hostel and Saw series (dubbed “torture porn” in 2006 by New York Magazine film critic David Edelstein). However, there are older films whose content still retains the power to shock contemporary audiences. Whether it be the graphically slow eye-gouging of Zombie (1979, dir. Lucio Fulci), the prolonged sadistic torture in The Last House on the Left (1972; dir. Wes Craven), or the cannibalistic violence in Cannibal Holocaust (1980; dir. Ruggero Deodato) and Eaten Alive (1980; dir. Umberto Lenzi), these moments still test the emotional fortitude of many horror viewers.\n\nSavvy horror filmmakers can inflict emotional cruelty on audiences in ways other than visceral gore and brutal violence. Certain ideas or concepts may also transgress audiences’ expectations for safe scares. Though many horror films put young children in danger, rarely do children die in these stories. People tend to see children as innocent, pure, and in need of protection. The failure of adults to protect these children from an undeserved and violent death transgresses these beliefs. Viewers may think that if an innocent child cannot be spared from the horrors of death and violence, then is anyone truly safe? If so, why watch a fictional film for such emotional discomfort when one can just watch the tragedies on the daily news? Films that have such content threaten a general sense that human existence has meaning and predictability, beliefs that people generally need to hold in some fashion to be psychologically healthy. Communication scholar Jonathan Lake Crane argues that such films are psychologically and culturally transgressive in that they provide us a glimpse into “what it feels like to live in an inordinately dangerous world” that “has also stopped making sense” (1994; Terror in Everyday Life). Film critic David Edelstein (2006) raised a similar issue with “torture porn” films when arguing the victims in these films “are neither interchangeable nor expendable” and are “decent people with recognizable human emotions” rather than victims in previous horror films that presumably are harder for audiences to empathize with and thus be less disturbed by their deaths.\n\nWhat about films that force audiences to share the perspective of murderers for prolonged periods of time? I am not talking about when directors use the occasional point-of-view shot to mask the identity of the killer while still showing audiences what they are seeing. Rather, some films center murders as the key protagonist for the entire film, such as Martin (1977; dir. George Romero), Beyond the Darkness (1979; dir. Joe D’Amato), and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986; dir. John McNaughton). Sometimes, these murderers can be sympathetic, such as those in Peeping Tom (1960; dir. Michael Powell) and Nightmare (1981; dir. Romano Scavolini), who are conflicted about their uncontrollable murderous desires which arise from a combination of childhood traumas and forced psychological experimentation. Are these individuals predators, victims, or both?\n\nGenerally, people have difficulty being in a state of moral ambiguity, whether because of their own actions or someone they are empathizing with. Thus, being forced to identity with characters mired in moral ambiguity likely taxes most viewers who presumably are watching the film to be entertained. Not everyone wants their entertainment to be emotionally and morally challenging, or at least they need to know beforehand what they are getting into and be in the right mindset for it. Thus, what happens when viewers see characters torturing people who we learn have engaged in even worse violence, such as in Mutilation Massacre (2017; dir. Derek Braasch) or the latter portion of The Last House on the Left (1972; dir. Wes Craven)? Does the punishment fit the crime? Who do we root for in this situation? Perhaps we find ourselves uncomfortable at the thought that we feel the violence is justified, even if only momentarily and in a fictional space. Maybe that provokes uncomfortable questions about one’s tolerance of (or even willingness to engage in) violence if perceived as justified.\n\nFamed horror directors such as Wes Craven (The Last House on the Left, 1972) and George Romero (Night of the Living Dead, 1968) have argued that they pushed the envelope in their early work to express their anger and frustration with the sociopolitical strife of the late 1960s and early 70s. As horror director George Romero argued, the emotional discomfort provoked by extreme violence and gore “puts you in a kind of mindset to accept the other ideas that are in the film…unless you run screaming from the theater” (The American Nightmare). Of course, not every extreme horror director endeavors to make political statements in their work. Sometimes they simply wish to see how far they can push audiences and give them something they’ve never experienced before. Regardless of the reason, extreme horror provides us with an opportunity to examine the emotional and moral boundaries for both ourselves and our cultures. Through their transgression, these films lay bare our assumptions, values, and vulnerabilities. Maybe they remind us that if we don’t feel shocked now and then, we are not paying attention.\n\nAdditional Readings\n\nAhmad, A. (2018).

Robin Hardy) – a 50-year-old film that defies categorization. The film’s writer Anthony Shaffer described it as “an intelligent horror film” (Brown, 2010, p. 7). A contemporary American reviewer described it as a “philosophical soft-core Scottish thriller musical” (Brown, 2010, p. xviii). It is all these things and more. The late veteran horror actor Sir Christopher Lee often claimed this was his finest and favorite film performance. Though initially the film did not garner much critical or commercial acclaim, over time the film has built a cult following among critics, scholars, and film buffs, such that people regularly make pilgrimages to filming locations with fervor that might not be that different from the characters who inhabit the film’s fictional island community of Summerisle (albeit without the tolerance for human sacrifice – should I have said ‘spoiler alert’?).\n\nThe story of the film’s production and longevity is almost as complex and gripping as the film’s plot itself. Author Allan Brown chronicled this amazing tale in the book Inside The Wicker Man: How Not to Make a Cult Classic (2010), so I will not rehash the details. A common theme throughout the cast and crew interviews involves the nature of belief and what people are willing to do in service of those beliefs. The late actor Edward Woodward, who played the main character Sergent Howie, argues “the subject matter, bizarre admittedly, was treated with dignity, the belief system of both men, Sergent Neil Howie and Lord Summerisle, were given equal weight…” (Brown, 2010, p. xii). This puts the viewer in a paradoxical position because Howie is the stand-in for the audience as the plot unfolds and we discover more about the pagan beliefs of the Summerisle citizens. Though Howie suspects the islanders of plotting the horrendous ritual sacrifice of a local girl, their views on sexuality and earthly pleasure likely seem more agreeable to audiences than Howie’s rigid and Puritanical morality, both in the 1970s and today. So, who are audiences supposed to root for? Are we meant to stand with Howie and view the Summerisle citizens as sinister villains who cling to antiquated beliefs, or instead to critique Howie as a prudish representative of Christian fundamentalist-oriented, paternalistic colonialism forcing their beliefs and laws on a new community? According to the interviews compiled in Allan Brown’s book on the film, probably a little of both.\n\nSeveral film scholars position The Wicker Man as a key film in the “folk horror” genre. Films in this genre tend to 1) place a key emphasis on the landscape as part of the narrative, 2) convey a sense of isolation for the characters, 3) have some type of supernatural activity rooted in folklore as a key plot point, and 4) involve characters that endorse “skewed moral beliefs” (at least from the perspective of the main character and/or the audience). Though this film fits all four of these criteria (except the supernatural part of the folklore), I will focus on the “skewed moral beliefs” aspect as this works on multiple levels. Certainly, Sergent Howie finds the beliefs of the Summerisle citizens skewed, as he scoffs when Lord Summerisle refers to his community as “a deeply religious people.” Howie also angrily calls Lord Summerisle a “pagan” and describes their children’s school lessons as “corruption” and “filth.” Though audiences likely will be more familiar with Howie’s religion than that of Summerisle, most viewers likely find the way Howie practices skewed also. Howie’s rigidity and certainty in his beliefs fit the worst stereotype of the uptight religious fundamentalist. Film scholar Stirling Smith argued Howie is “a man out of touch with his own world as well as the world of Summerisle” (Brown, 2010, p.136).\n\nWorld-view beliefs, whether religious or secular, can provide many psychological benefits. They help us navigate a morally complex world, as well as provide us with an overall sense of meaning and identity. Unfortunately, the more fervently we adhere to these beliefs the more we tend to respond to alternative perspectives (and those who hold them) as personal threats, which in turn make us increase our conviction in these beliefs. Also, the stronger our convictions in these beliefs, the more questionable actions we are willing to tolerate in service of safeguarding these cherished beliefs. In extreme contexts, people may be willing to kill or die for these beliefs. Again, this is not something unique to a particular belief system. So, are Sergent Howie and Lord Summerisle really that different, at least in terms of the psychology behind their belief systems?\n\nPerhaps herein lies a key source of horror in The Wicker Man: confronting audiences with a distorted mirror and asking them to examine ways in which they just as easily could become Howie or the citizens of Summerisle. Whom do we judge as immoral and why? Do we engage with our beliefs actively and critically or do we simply get carried away with the crowd? What ‘evil’ are we willing to tolerate in service of what we consider to be the ‘greater good’? These are all difficult questions that may make us face unpleasant truths about ourselves, but they also can provoke personal change (albeit with some growing pains). Anthony Shaffer argued that the film’s philosophical center also provides the key to the film’s longevity: “It’s about perhaps the deepest, most meaningful question man can ask himself; what do I believe and why do I believe it? This film survives because it invites you to think for yourself; it insists on it. And in doing so, it insists on living” (Brown, 2010, p. 190).\n\nAdditional Readings\n\nBartholomew, D. (1977).

A low-budget exploitation film director gets his start in the 1960s and makes over 30 films in various wild and crazy genres, maintaining a cult following to this day. One may question what documentaries on these two topics have in common. Surprisingly, quite a bit!\n\nBroadly, the documentaries highlight Gilead Media (A Wondering Path, 2023, dir. Michael Dimmitt) and director Al Adamson/Independent-International Pictures (Blood & Flesh: The Reel Life & Ghastly Death of Al Adamson, 2019, dir. David Gregory). The first thing that struck me while watching the documentaries was the core Do-It-Yourself (DIY) philosophy in both companies and the artists who are/were involved. Black Metal is a niche musical genre, unlikely recognized by most mainstream music fans. Adamson’s films were made outside of the Hollywood system and played predominantly in Drive-Ins, run-down Grindhouse theaters, and late-night Cable TV programs. His films now are pretty much only available through Blu-Ray/DVD releases by boutique film distribution companies like Severin Films. For most DIY companies, money is necessary for survival but not the primary motivation for the folks involved. Gilead Media label founder Adam Bartlett notes that there have been several times he has considered closing the label but continues to find stuff he wants to do with it. Similarly, Al Adamson’s friends note that he could have stopped making films and either found a less frustrating way to stay involved in films, worked within safer mainstream Hollywood fare, or simply relied on his other business ventures – but he had stories he wanted to tell.\n\nThe core of DIY efforts, especially in artistic endeavors, seems focused on safeguarding one’s sense of agency and staying true to one’s values and passions, even if it means the path may be wandering, steep, and overgrown with roots and other tripping hazards. Most DIY folks find money and notoriety as important, but to a lesser degree than being true and authentic to one’s worldview and having general control over one’s important goal pursuits. These psychological needs are something we all share to a degree, so even viewers unfamiliar with (or uninterested in) the specific artistic genres that Gilead Media and Independent-International Pictures worked in likely will find something they can appreciate, resonate with, or find inspirational in these companies’ stories. This likely will be true especially for people coming from individualistic cultures or other backgrounds that appreciate self-made, small business stories. Alternatively, for those viewers who are a bit iconoclastic, enjoy transgression, and whenever possible like to shake things up a bit, there is something endearing about individuals who eschew the mainstream and thumb their noses at (or extend their middle finger to) cultural expectations, deciding instead to find their own path through this crazy thing called life.\n\nThat said, few people can exist on their own outside of a community. Psychologists argue that a pancultural core human need is to find like-minded individuals, people who share our interests, passions, and worldviews. Individuals who provide us with a sense of belonging and that we are valued for who we are, not just for what we can do or the capital we can generate. Research on both music subcultures and fandom generally suggests that these communities help people strike an optimal balance between the competing goals to fit in and stand out. This certainly is true of both Gilead Media and Independent-International Pictures, because interviewees in both documentaries continually use terms like “family” and “community” to describe the people involved in these various bands and films (respectively).\n\nThe sense of community extends beyond the creative teams behind these two DIY companies and into their respective fan communities. For example, fans at the Gilead Media annual “Migration Fest” also use the terms “family” and “community” to discuss their experiences of being around like-minded individuals. Though Al Adamson has long since passed away and his film company dissolved, we can extend the community argument to modern-day fans of his films, and perhaps fans of B-movies and exploitation films broadly. Boutique film companies like Severin (who released the Adamson box set), Vinegar Syndrome, and Arrow Video are dedicated to creating lovingly restored versions of genre films usually ignored by the mainstream. Not only do these companies create high-resolution restorations of these films from the best elements possible, but they also create myriad bonus features that make film nerds like me swoon. The box sets and limited-edition releases from these companies often sell out quickly. Further, these companies have a legion of devoted followers on their main social media pages, as well as several home-grown fan groups where members can rejoice in their shared love of the cinematic margins. We know most people don’t ‘get it,’ so when we meet another person who does it feels like an immediate social connection. So, whether you like Black Metal, B-movies, or something more mainstream – find those folks who share or support your interests, letting you stand out as well as make you feel like you belong.\n\nBonus Readings:\n\nAbrams, D.

Lee’s poetic description is beautiful, though not entirely accurate. Scholars generally agree that this name emerged from the typical yellow covers for crime-related fiction in Italy and became a catch-all for various narrative and cinematic tropes. Experts differ in which tropes they believe are most important, and often have difficulty agreeing on a coherent body of films to classify as Gialli. Most agree that director Mario Bava established the general blueprint for these films and his pupil Dario Argento perfected it, citing the former’s Blood and Black Lace (6 Donne per L'assassino, 1964) and the latter’s Deep Red (Profondo Rosso, 1975) as canonical examples. These films, and others like them, are murder-mysteries that involve elaborately stylized murder sequences and incomprehensible plot twists. Film historian Fabio Melelli argues that most gialli utilize non-linear plots to give audiences the feeling that the killer can strike from anywhere and at any time, provoking “a constant feeling of unease, a constant feeling of helplessness…In an Italian giallo, you don’t feel safe even in your own home” (All the Colors of Giallo, 2019; dir. Federico Caddeo). Gialli defy narrative logic by nature, refusing audiences coherent meaning and satisfying closure. Thus, these films thwart basic psychological needs that everyone has to some degree. They partially function by attacking what horror author Stephen King calls psychological “pressure points” (Danse Macabre, 1981; p. 68).\n\nThese films also typically involve mundane villains, homicidal humans with nothing supernatural about them. Nothing to mark them as “monstrous” besides their horrible actions. Thus, these films suggest killers could be anyone: a lover or family member, a friend, a coworker, a neighbor, or the person two seats over on the bus. Quoting Christopher Lee again, “Hallucinations and paranoia are impossible to see objectively. We can never know the thoughts of others, only judge their words and actions. By then it is often too late” (100 Years of Horror, 1996, “Maniacs” episode). Stephen King further argues in his book Danse Macabre (p. 62) that horror stories “which are psychological – those which explore the terrain of the human heart – almost always revolve around the free-will concept” and meditate on the evil that originates from inside humans rather than malicious external forces like traditional monsters, aliens, etc. Giallo films certainly fit this mold. The films often provide their villains with a motive focused on childhood trauma, though many viewers (and critics) may find these explanations strain credibility. But Gialli critics and fans often argue that the plot is secondary to style, with the key viewing pleasure coming from the latter.\n\nSo why provide any reason or motive at all? Perhaps it is because humans generally look for causal explanations, whether they be natural or supernatural, to explain horrible events. The idea that evil or destructive forces are unpredictable and uncontrollable can be truly terrifying. As King suggests, “we must always believe that such perfect, motiveless evil is mad, for the sake of our own sanity” (p. 63). Even a half-hearted explanation provides a small measure of comfort. For example, though some critics disparage the psychologist’s final explanation for Norman Bates’s actions in Psycho (1960; dir. Alfred Hitchcock), the ending likely provided perceived closure for many contemporary viewers not used to that type of horror narrative. In similar fashion, the motives for the psychologically disturbed murderers in Don’t Torture a Duckling (Non Si Sevizia un Paperino, 1972; dir. Lucio Fulci) or Torso (I Corpi Presentano Tracce di Violenza Carnale, 1973; dir. Sergio Martino) may strain credibility but at least provide some explanation rather than keeping their crimes motiveless.\n\nI argue that many Giallo films, and perhaps other films involving King’s concept of “inside evil” (Danse Macabre, p. 62), can scare people at a level beyond simply fearing the potential threats hiding in plain sight. Gialli protagonists often find themselves doubted by friends, family, and ineffectual law enforcement. Sometimes they question their own perceptions and sanity. As veteran horror director/producer Roger Corman notes, “What frightens me is not so much the obvious monster. What frightens me is the unknown. The fear that my mind is not in control, that there is something out there that nobody knows about, that I don’t know about but that it is dangerous” (100 Years of Horror, 1996, “Maniacs” episode). What does it feel like to distrust one’s own thoughts, feelings, and experiences? Psychologists have labeled the fear of losing one’s sense of sanity phrenophobia (more recently anxiety sensitivity). Though researchers largely study this experience in clinical contexts, some studies suggest individuals without diagnosable mental health concerns also have such fears occasionally. Thus, “temporary phrenophobia” could represent another of King’s psychological pressure points poked, prodded, and stabbed by Gialli and other films that challenge protagonists’ sense of sanity.\n\nArt scholar Vicente Javier Pérez Valero argues that one of the Gialli’s key cinematic innovations involves using lights, camera angles, and editing tricks to unsettle their audiences with “extreme sensations,” “paranoia,” and a “sensation of unreality” (2019, pp. 319-328). The same effects might also be achieved narratively via having protagonists experience trippy, ambiguous events that could just as easily be a dream, hallucination, or reality. The story keeps both the character and the audience uncertain. For example, the late horror director Stuart Gordon describes watching Dario Argento’s films as “you feel almost like you are in a nightmare” (The Fearmakers, 1994, “Dario Argento” episode, dir. Wynn Winberg). Similarly, the Giallo film All the Colors of the Dark (Tutti I Colori Del Buio, 1972; dir. Sergio Martino) provides another great example of these films’ nightmarish potential. John Martin, editor of the magazine The Giallo Pages, highlights the eclectic, “phantasmagorical” nature of this film: “Is it a realistic thriller, is she mad, is somebody tricking her, or is all this…nightmare unfolding around her stuff, is it for real?” (“The Giallo Frames,” 2018; dir. David Flint; special feature on All the Colors of Giallo).\n\nIf audience members do experience acute cases of phrenophobia vicariously when watching All the Colors of the Dark (1972) or other notable Gialli, the experience likely is pleasurable in the same way that any horror entertainment provides pleasure. If we experienced such doubts in our daily lives, we likely would be paralyzed with existential dread. Horror entertainment provides a fictional space to explore these fears in relative safety. Famous Gialli director Dario Argento argued that he tells audiences upfront that when they watch his films they will be entering his nightmares, but he also assures them “they’ll like it” (All the Colors of Giallo, 2019; dir. Federico Caddeo). Christopher Lee made a similar comment, which I will leave as the final word: “For a brief time in the darkened cinema we can choose to visit the world of madness. Luckily our theater ticket assures us of a return trip.” (100 Years of Horror, 1996, “Maniacs” episode).\n\nAdditional Readings:\n\nBassett, M., Sperlinger, D., & Freeman, D. (2009).

No, this has nothing to do with films about masked maniacs wielding machetes, axes, or chainsaws that may be lying in wait for the unwary. There already are many films about the myriad things in natural environments to fear, such as nature itself. I’m not talking about films involving threats from popular cryptids such as Bigfoot (Night of the Demon [1980]) or other denizens of folklore like the Wendigo (The Retreat [2020]). There is plenty to fear from the creatures we know exist. We humans may fancy ourselves as the masters of our surroundings, with our guns, our shelters, and our ability to create and wield fire. However, one needs only to watch a nature documentary to realize how many non-human animals and insects could cut our life expectancy short if we do not possess those tools that otherwise give us a survival advantage (sometimes, even with them!). There are many creatures that are bigger, stronger, and faster than us – often with sharp teeth and a taste for meat (yes, that includes human meat). There are also smaller creatures that can evade our notice and inflict poisonous death on unwary travelers (Arachnophobia (1990), anyone?)\n\nSometimes these films dovetail with other fears, such as the fear of science (and human hubris) gone amok. Perhaps our experimentation with nuclear radiation, toxic chemicals, or gene splicing has led to nature striking back to take us down a peg. Themes that started in the 1950s sci-fi/horror films like Tarantula (1955) and Them! (1954) can be seen in more modern films Day of the Animals (1977), Piranha (1978), Alligator (1980), Killer Crocodile (1989), Eight Legged Freaks (2002), and the Birdemic series. Perhaps it is simply that animals are exposed to our illegal drugs that drives them homicidal, such as in The Wild Beast (1984) or Cocaine Bear (2023).\n\nWorse yet there may be no cause or explanation other than chaos inherent in nature; no matter how much we may wish otherwise some forces are beyond our control. Just as we are left wondering about the fate of the survivors at the end of Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds (1963), we also are denied a clear explanation for the avian assault. It would be atypical, though not completely out of character, for predatory birds to attack humans. But why would bird breeds that otherwise would avoid humans actively pursue and eat them? Without a clear explanation, how can we determine if this was a one-off phenomenon localized to Bogeda Bay, CA, or something that could happen again (and again) in other towns such as our own?\n\nSometimes the threat needs no other explanation than the killer instincts of an “apex predator,” a creature that preys on others but has no natural predators of its own to fear. Whether the beast is a holdover from an earlier evolutionary era like in Grizzly (1976), or simply a modern-day killing machine like Jaws (1975), it is terrifying simply because it lives to kill whatever, or whomever, crosses its path. Fear is a natural, adaptive response to any perceived threat – it focuses our attention, cognitive and physical resources in a fight-or-flight orientation, and when (if?) we survive we are likely to remember as much about the event as possible to survive any future encounters. Though some types of fears are learned, embedded in our specific cultural backgrounds, others seem to be pancultural and inherited from our shared evolutionary ancestors. Movies that probe these evolved “pressure points” have wide appeal as horror entertainment precisely because they speak to fears across time, place, and personal experience. I find the lions in The Ghost and the Darkness (1996) much more frightening than the zombies in any Romero film because the lions feasibly could (and did!) exist. As such it is good to have the occasional horror-comedy entry into this genre, such as Psycho Ape (2020), Birdemic: Shock & Terror (2010), Cocaine Bear (2023), or even a Sharknado (2013) (or six!), to use levity and take the edge off the predators’ claws/teeth and let us laugh a bit into the darkness.\n\nSome of these films have explicit pro-environmental messages, wrapping up the carnage as a cautionary tale about the damage humans are doing to the environment via pollution, deforestation, and the increased destruction of natural habitats in the name of ‘development.’ Often, these messages provide a convenient age-old exploitation film tactic for justifying 70+ minutes of bloody carnage to the censors. However, sometimes the filmmakers hope to use the laughs and screams to deliver a larger point to audiences. Cocaine Bear (2023) director Elizabeth Banks argued that humans’ prideful approach toward nature is illusory: “We’ve thought that now for a hundred years, and nature is fighting back, and we are not going to win. And ultimately, that was the big idea that I felt like our silly, crazy movie could elucidate for people a little bit” (Fangoria, vol. 2, #18, January 2023, p. 55).\n\nResearch demonstrates that exposure to nature, especially if it involves potential challenges or threats, can provoke a mixture of both fear and inspiration or awe. Awe, in turn, can expand people’s worldviews and their connection to the natural environment, reminding them that they are interconnected with nature and that ultimately they are not in control of it. In that way, these films can serve a social function in the same way that many cautionary folk tales did for people in previous centuries. Sometimes it is better not to stray from path into the deep dark woods or to avoid standing too close to the edge of the water. Or, as Elizabeth Banks quipped to Fangoria Magazine, “Maybe don’t pollute the natural world with crazy substances. That is not going to go well for humans” (p. 55).\n\nAdditional Readings\n\nAdolphs, R. (2013). The biology of fear. Current Biology, 23(2), R79-R93.\n\nClasen, M. (2012).

It should be banned!” Am I talking about the current crusade against “woke” textbooks in schools? Violent video games in the 2000s? Rap and heavy metal music in the early ‘90s? Dungeons & Dragons in the ‘80s? Comic books in the ‘50s? Movies in the ‘30s? How about pulp westerns from the late 1800s? All of the above! For better or worse, debates around media censorship and free speech are nothing new in the U.S. Indeed, these debates have occurred in countries across the world. One of the most intense struggles over these issues, at least in Western democracies, occurred in England in the 1980s and ‘90s: the so-called “Video Nasties” era.\n\nBrief history lesson: When home video devices became readily available in England, films were released on video uncut, containing material that would have otherwise been removed for theatrical releases by the British Board of Film Classification (similar to the Motion Picture Association in the U.S., albeit government sponsored). Without going into too much detail (many great books and documentaries cover the social and political dynamics of this period thoroughly, including Severin’s Video Nasties pt. 1 & pt. 2), parents, politicians, and other special interest groups became terrified that children, or other individuals perceived as impressionable, would have access to videos that depict graphic physical and sexual violence, which would then “deprave and corrupt” them. Thus, these self-proclaimed moral watchdogs lobbied for these films to be heavily restricted or even outright banned if possible. Film scholar Kate Egan described the legislation that resulted from this controversy – the 1984 Video Recordings Act – as “perhaps the most stringent form of regulation imposed on the media in a western country” (2007, pg. 1). Thus, videos classified as “nasties” became illegal to stock and distribute, making them inaccessible not just to minors but to anyone. Suddenly, the government was telling British adults what they could – and could not – see in the privacy of their homes. Though some of these films still remain banned to this day, the social and political fervor has since died down and the related moral panic largely is considered laughable in hindsight, even by some of the media outlets that originally championed the moral crusade for censorship.\n\nThus, one may ask why this period should be studied any more than as a cultural curiosity embedded within a specific national and historical context. Why should people outside of England care about a controversy that began over thirty years ago? Can we learn anything that may be relevant for current (and future) socio-political discourse, either in England, the U.S., or in other countries?\n\nAny historical event or cultural movement has complex socio-political and psychological explanations. One factor I want to highlight is the psychological dynamics of media censorship. Though many historical, cross-cultural examples of calls for censorship have been driven by conservative movements, there certainly are examples of liberal-oriented efforts against media (and media figures) too – see current debates about “cancel culture.” We see individuals of various political leanings advocating for free speech and individual liberties in some contexts, yet also calling for bans, or at least content revisions, on controversial media products in other contexts. Such assertions seem contradictory and we may be tempted to call these individuals hypocrites. However, such conflicting views can occur in many, if not most, people.\n\nFor example, I’m a strong proponent of free speech and generally anti-censorship, though even I have my lines. Ultimately, most (if not all) of us do. Some individuals just have lines that include more types of material than others. There are attitudes toward censorship generally, which seem to hinge on a benevolent, though often misguided, desire to protect people from being harmed by media. What people differ on is who they want to protect and the content they want to protect them from. Sometimes people are fine with violent content but want to heavily restrict or abolish sexual content (or at least specific types of sexual content; see Kirby Dick’s 2006 documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated). Other people generally are fine with sexual content but decry violence, especially sexual violence. Then there are those individuals who want anything even remotely controversial or potentially offensive restricted. Ultimately, this is where one’s moral values, political opinions, and personal biases come in to play. Individuals often find it laudable to restrict speech and media content when the content is something they disagree with, but view such efforts as a repellant violation of liberty when the content is something they agree with. I imagine that we can easily come up with examples of this biased reasoning from people we know, and if we think hard enough and are honest with ourselves we can probably find at least one example from our own past reasoning. For better or worse, people often are inconsistent.\n\nIn the U.S. we currently are seeing public calls for book banning – and sometimes burning! – from both politicians and parent groups. We are seeing educators being reprimanded or even fired simply for sharing information from public libraries about controversial (though still legal) material. Right now these calls are coming from the political right, but our history demonstrates these calls can also come from the political left. It may be tempting for us to minimize or even ignore these actions when they are in concert with our worldviews. However, we do well to be mindful that even if we agree with these initiatives now, there is always the chance that someday the focus will shift against us and our views will be on the receiving end. The late media scholar Martin Baker, one of the few academics to challenge pro-censorship figures directly during England’s Video Nasties era, argued \"I think the most interesting thing to me is just how little historical memory we have. The next time there’s a panic we won’t remember just how stupid the last one was and how people get away with things…Critical voices have to care about history. We have to care about the way in which things got controlled in the past because that's when the damage gets done and if we don't keep that historical memory we will allow them to do it again next time.\" (Video Nasties, 2010, dir. J. West).\n\nI will add this very modest addendum to Baker’s powerful clarion call: Those of us who value free speech should also challenge our own biases in these media debates, taking care that the draconian “them” doesn’t become “us” in a different context. If you find yourself thinking “I’d never support a ban” or “that could never happen here,” pause and think critically. One of the biggest lessons from over a half-century of social psychological research is that, depending on the context, it definitely could happen in certain circumstances. Don’t underestimate the power of our worldview-based biases.\n\nAdditional Readings\n\nBarker, M. (1984). The video nasties: Freedom and censorship in the media. London, UK: Pluto Press.\n\nEgan, K.

This is not surprising given that director Sam Raimi is a huge Three Stooges fan. Effective splatstick is a fine line indeed, and the filmmakers need to be mindful of which edge of that line they want to lean on. Whereas the first Evil Dead film leaned toward the gore/horror end (which may be one the reasons why it was labeled the ultimate “Video Nasty” in the U.K.), the second film (Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn) opted more for the comedy end. True, it has copious amount of blood, bodily dismemberments, and demon-possessed mayhem – just like the first film. This time, however, the blood gushes with the pressure of a fire hose, and the physical violence has all the tongue-in-cheek winks to the audience found in a well-choreographed professional wrestling match.\n\nI’ve watched this film an obscene number of times. When I first discovered it in high school, I dragged countless friends over to my parents’ basement and subjected them to the film. Some friends didn’t get it, but there were the hearty few who I successfully converted to the cinematic wonders that are Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. This film, perhaps more than any other, inspired me to make my own DIY movies in college. Most of my movies were shrines to Evil Dead 2, and the friends who helped me make them were wonderfully tolerant people.\n\nWhat seems to keep fans coming back to this film is the playful chaos, the cinematic winks and nods that keep the grim subject matter from ever being taken too seriously (by the audience at least). The characters in the film take the situation seriously enough, even if the audience realizes how absurd everything is. It is that absurdity that likely allows viewers to keep a safe distance psychologically.\n\nWhen I first watched The Evil Dead trilogy, I watched the films backwards, not purposefully, but because that was the way they became available to me via the local video store (yep, I watched them on VHS). So, I saw Army of Darkness – the third film in the trilogy and the one with little (if any) horror – first and ended on The Evil Dead. I loved all of them for different reasons, and I can honestly say the first one disturbed me (in that good “horror fan” sort of way) more than it made me laugh. It’s the second one I keep returning to, and the one that I start people on. The horror is just absurd enough that it provides the safe psychological distance to help me feel control over the idea that a character I’m being encouraged to empathize with is beset by evil Candarian demons who are ready to rend him asunder and swallow his soul (and not necessarily in that order). Further, it ends less bleakly than its predecessor. We know that even if Ash cannot rest after the dawn, he is still alive at least – and still has a chance to rage against the dying of the light.* As such, we share his chance. Horror theorists argue that the best horror films are the ones that afford us an opportunity to confront our fears in a safe, controlled environment. They become tangible, controllable, and much less scary than the uncontrollable, seemingly random threats that often surround us outside the theater.\n\nHorror, disgust, and humor: although they seem to be so different, many theorists have argued they share similarities. They all are visceral, knee-jerk emotions. Whether you feel your blood run cold, your stomach turn, or the uncontrollable sensation to guffaw, you are dealing with something that catches you off-guard. Psychologists who study emotions note that these high-arousal emotions, whether positive or negative, can often work in concert, the arousal from one bleeding over (yep, I went there) into the other. The mounting tension as you reach the top of the roller coaster makes the laughter going down that much more relieving. The jump-scare in the darkened theater makes your date feel that much safer (and attractive) when you grab hold of them.\n\nFear, excitement, and humor are contagious. That’s why watching a film like Evil Dead 2 in the theater is such a wonderful ride. We get tense together, eagerly awaiting the key splatter set-pieces and groovy catch phrases, and we cheer wildly when they are delivered. The lights come up and we leave the theater, knowing we’ve just been on a wild ride with people who ‘get it.’ We are not so alone anymore, and the dark is much less scary.\n\nJoin us.\n\n*apologies to Dylan Thomas\n\nAdditional Readings\n\nCantor, J.

The people inside huddle together desperately, struggling to overcome their own egos and prejudices to survive the onslaught. Am I talking about a horror movie, or an actual event of sociopolitical unrest? Did this event happen in the 1960s, or in 2020? Sometimes it’s hard to tell, and that was precisely the point director George Romero and screenwriter John Russo were making in their groundbreaking film Night of the Living Dead (1968). Romero argued that a good horror film is transgressive culturally, that “you do horror to upset the apple cart” (Nightmares in Red White and Blue, 2009, dir. A. Monument). Romero said in multiple interviews that he and his collaborators infused the film with a lot of their anger and frustration that the U.S. counter-culture movement was failing to change the status quo. They asked themselves what it would take to shake society out of its apathy. Maybe only the dead coming back to life – and eating the living – would get people to start working together for the good of all. Or maybe it would just hasten the demise of our society by pouring gasoline on the fires of human miscommunication and division.\n\nNight… is one of my all-time favorite horror films. Ironically, I did not see it until I was in my early 20s. By that point I had been a horror fan for most of my life and had seen a lot of modern horror: films that were gorier than this grainy, black-and-white film from the ‘60s. However, that did not diminish the film’s power to shock me. I was unsettled deeply by the ending and had trouble sleeping that night. Why did this film that was made about a decade before I was born hit me at such an existential level? The sociopolitical turmoil of the time was something I only had read about in history books; the privilege of my race, gender, and socioeconomic status protected me from the intergenerational trauma of those times. Horror films, like any work of art, are cultural products and reflect aspects of the time, place, and worldviews of their creators. However, they are timeless in that audience members also bring their own cultural backgrounds and personal experiences to bear on the narrative. Horror author Stephen King argues that the most effective horror stories are ones that hit audience members at two key levels: 1) attacking cultural taboos of the time and place of its creation, and 2) resonating with universal fears – things that would scare anyone regardless of their age, geographical location, or backgrounds. These stories transcend time to scare multiple generations.\n\nNight… succeeds on both levels, which is probably why King uses it regularly as a case study in his treatise on horror entertainment, Danse Macabre (1981). One of the most common ways people discuss this film is within the context of the Civil Rights Movement and race relations during the time of the film’s creation and release (see the documentary Birth of the Living Dead, 2013, dir. R. Kuhns). Indeed, it is hard not to see the physical and social conflicts between the main character Ben, played by the African American actor Duane Jones, and the middle-aged, curmudgeonly Mr. Cooper, played by the White actor Karl Hardman, as anything other than the embodied struggle of those in search of racial equality and social justice versus those who benefit from white patriarchal supremacy. This is a great example of how the artists’ intended meaning does not necessarily match audience members’ experiences. Romero and Russo did not intend for a race-based interpretation of these character dynamics. In the original script, no racial identity is mentioned for Ben. They cast Duane Jones simply because he was the best actor who auditioned for the part, and they thought they were being progressive by NOT re-writing the part to emphasize the actor’s race. But, given the film premiered shortly after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., they were aware that such an interpretation was likely despite their original intentions. They knew their film was going to bite down on a cultural nerve. Indeed, it did and still does during the continued struggle for social justice.\n\nStephen King notes that Night… also hits taboos that exist in multiple cultures, such as cannibalism, matricide/patricide, handling decaying remains, and dispensing with culturally valued rituals for honoring the dead. King also argues that, if nothing else, all horror films deal with the biggest universal concerns – the fear of death and the uncertainty of what happens after, both for our physical bodies and for our consciousness or soul (for those who are spiritually-oriented). Night… thumbs its decaying nose at these concerns. Not only do the ghouls (they are not referred to as “zombies” until the sequel Dawn of the Dead (1978) released a decade later) kill people, but they “have begun eating the flesh of the people they murder.” Indeed, though we do not directly see it in this first film, it is likely that some victims are eaten alive. Not a pleasant way to go. Further, the victims who escape having their remains decimated go on to become ghouls themselves. These ghouls do not communicate so it is unclear how much consciousness, if any, remains from their previous lives, but their use of tools and weapons suggest there may be some. That begs the audience to question: “Does that mean our loved ones are still in there somewhere? Does that mean we may be trapped in a rotting shell too?” These questions are reanimated and further developed in Romero’s later Dead films. Romero shatters any protective illusions that the ghouls/zombies became some external force different from the protagonists (and the audience): “We know we’re gonna die…we’re the living dead” (The American Nightmare, 2000, dir. A. Simon).\n\nBoth Romero and Russo argued that the main characters were not meant to be heroic or exceptional in any way. They were written simply to be normal people who were thrust into an absurd, life-threatening situation, acting how real people probably would. Perhaps the characters' normalcy makes it easy for audiences to empathize with them, taking their perspective and asking themselves “What would I do? How would I survive?” Heavily invested audience members may find themselves even yelling advice to the characters on the screen. A core tragedy of the film is that some characters make good decisions, and others make bad decisions (even if for the best of intentions), and at the end of the day (or night) none of it matter ultimately. In a world where the dead walk, can anyone truly escape?\n\nThis film’s nihilism shocked audiences then as it does now. Humans have psychological needs to feel some sense of control and to find existential meaning. They may take different paths to fulfilling these needs (even if their efforts may be illusory), but the motivation is universal. Night… refuses to provide any suggestion that these needs matter and that there is any hope for humanity. This is an effective tactic for pressing on what Stephen King calls audiences’ horror-focused “pressure points” (King, 1989, pg. 5). However, it does not bode well for creating a film franchise. Let’s be honest – the entertainment industry is a business, and a steady source of profit is paramount. Audiences may tolerate, and even enjoy, a single film with an ending that sounds the death knell for humanity. But would they support a series of films providing no hope at all? Indeed, Romero suggested in multiple interviews that the downbeat ending for Night… caused them difficulty finding distribution (Williams, 2011). Perhaps this is why Dawn… and the subsequent sequels ended with at least a modicum of hope, even if the characters had to go through hell to get there.\n\nOne theme Romero examined in many of his films, Dead-related and otherwise, was the breakdown in human communication and cooperation as key problems, perhaps even more so than any monstrous threat. This theme, beyond any other, may be the most applicable to audience members’ lives, whether they saw the film in 1968 or today. Humans are social by nature, an interdependent species that can only survive and flourish by cooperation. This was a lesson that Romero’s protagonists were beginning to learn in his last few Dead films. Though we will never know what specific thematic lessons Romero had in store for future installments, we can focus on the theme he left us. If we are to have any hope of escaping disasters in our own world, human-made and otherwise, we need to recognize our interdependence, overcome our egos and petty divisions, and start cooperating.\n\nAdditional Readings:\n\nBaumeister, R.

It is a pivotal moment for both the character and the overall narrative – one that puts Sarah in an ethical conundrum that audiences likely share. If you had the power to stop the slaughter of millions of people, and prevent the prolonged trauma of subsequent generations, by simply murdering one person before they made the fateful decision that would put humanity on a course to nuclear holocaust, would you do it? There is always the chance that the person might make a different decision, especially with your guidance. Can you justify becoming a killing machine, even if only for one victim, if it means potentially saving future generations? These questions might traditionally be discussion fodder in university-level philosophy courses, but they are also at the heart of director James Cameron’s Terminator series (at least the first two films).\n\nBoth films generally are classified as science fiction. Famous science fiction author Isaac Asimov defined the genre as stories focused on “human responses to changes in the level of science and technology” (Asimov, 1982; p. 22). These stories usually depict technology as opening vistas to utopian dreams or dystopian nightmares, or as sci-fi actor/fan Wil Wheaton noted “[stories] that tell us what we could be and warn us about where we’re going” (In Search of Tomorrow, 2022, dir. David Weiner). The two Cameron Terminator films, when viewed collectively, represent a mix of both story types. They are generic “hybrids,” much like the titular cybernetic organism. Cameron argues that a theme crosscutting his films is “our potential destruction and the potential salvation as human beings coming from technology and how we use it, how we master it and how we prevent it from mastering us” (Wootton, 2003; reprinted in Dunham, 2011).\n\nThe first Terminator film mixes in elements of Film Noir and even horror films, as Cameron described his first vision of the robotic antagonist as “a robot design that could be split in half and still pursue its victims in classic sort-of 70s slasher style…a knife-wielding robot, cut in half, crawling over the ground after some poor female victim” (Other Voices: Back Through Time documentary on the 2001 MGM “Special Edition” release). Cameron also noted the key theme of this first film was a philosophical conflict for the characters: “It’s fate vs. will” (Chute, 1985; reprinted in Dunham, 2011). Though the film ends ambiguously, Cameron originally filmed a scene demonstrating Sarah Connor’s growth from a victim of fate to a pro-active hero who demonstrates the proclivity to become a future leader; not just the one Kyle Reese keeps telling her she is pre-ordained to become but perhaps one who actively can shape the future in new directions (Deleted Scenes commentary track, 2001 MGM “Special Edition”).\n\nThe second Terminator film, Judgment Day, film builds upon the themes of the first. Though Cameron initially regretted having to cut the scene of Sarah’s growth in the first film because of pacing issues, he noted it was serendipitous because he was able to revisit and flesh out this idea in the sequel (The Terminator, Deleted Scenes commentary track, 2001 MGM “Special Edition”). Further, the film adopted more traditional action genre elements and even humor, which had to be played delicately so as not to undercut the general serious premise of the narrative. These new elements perhaps led to the film feeling more hopeful than the previous one, with Sarah narrating “The unknown future rolls toward us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope. Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.” The original (deleted) ending of the film was even more hopeful, with the nuclear holocaust completely averted. However, Cameron chose to make the ending more uncertain because “if the future is changeable, then the battle is something which has to be fought continuously and you can’t do it with a single stroke…the dynamic between good and evil is eternal” (T2: More Than Meets the Eye, 1997 Lionsgate “Ultimate Edition”).\n\nThe Terminator unexpectedly was a box office smash, and the highly anticipated sequel delighted both audiences and critics alike. Many folks argue that the sequel provides a rare instance where the latter exceeds the original film. Regardless of one’s preference, the two films tapped the cultural zeitgeist when they were released. Indeed, as sci-fi film writer/director Nicholas Meyer (film writer/director) notes, “Science fiction, certainly the best of science fiction is inevitably a reflection of what’s going on on Earth at the time it was written, all works of art are ineluctable products of the time in which they are created” (In Search of Tomorrow, 2022, dir. David Weiner).\n\nHowever, situating these two films in their sociopolitical climate does not account for the films continued popularity. Yes, one could argue that those individuals who saw them during their initial theatrical runs may simply be reacting nostalgically upon re-watching today. But that does not explain how new generations of fans continue to discover appreciation for the films. Indeed, there have been several subsequent films and even a TV series. For better or worse, Cameron’s Terminator stories are just as relevant today as they were in the 1980s and 90s. We are still facing the same threats of climate change, political terrorism (both global and domestic), wars and rumors of wars. The specter of nuclear annihilation has returned, rising much like Cameron’s initial fever-induced dream vision of a T-800 emerging from the flames (Chute, 1985; reprinted in Dunham, 2011). In some ways, we face even more existential uncertainty as we negotiate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, an emerging global health crisis with monkeypox, and political instability. Though The Terminator’s dark vision of an armed individual entering a public place and mechanically murdering innocent people en masse may have seemed like a fictional horror story then, tragically it is a nightmarish reality today.\n\nIt may be that these films help us work though our personal and cultural anxieties, as Cameron suggested the first film served as a way for him to wrestle with the omnipresent threat of nuclear Armageddon as he grew up during the Cold War (Wootton, 2003; reprinted in Dunham, 2011). Though grim, The Terminator was not meant to be nihilistic but rather “tried to say that you take responsibility for your own life, and for the life of society” (Chute, 1985; reprinted in Dunham, 2011). It was a call to personal reckoning and action. After all, what point is using a story as a warning or cautionary tale if there is no hope or chance to change course? Or, as the future John Connor passes back to Sarah via Reese, “the future is not set. You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.” This message is revisited in the sequel via Sarah’s table carving, elucidated by young John’s exclamation “There's no fate but what we make for ourselves.” The second film concludes with Sarah asserting her new-found hope.\n\nSuch a message likely is something that audiences resonate with, and perhaps may be one reason why many argue the second film surpasses the first. People generally have a psychological need to feel that they are in control of their destiny, or at least can have a significant impact on their immediate environment. People respond negatively to the idea that their lives simply may be at the mercy of uncontrollable forces, or worse yet randomness. When someone is told they cannot do something, a common impulse is to assert one’s agency and shout back “Yes, I can!”, whether it be at one’s caregiver, an authoritarian political system, or even the existential void. A sense of hope and optimism are important ingredients in inspiring people to action and change. Not only are they helpful in overcoming the stressors – and sometimes traumas – we experience in life, but in general hope and optimism contribute to overall psychological well-being.\n\nSo, whereas many science fiction films can depict dystopian warnings that, as Will Wheaton notes, can make “people feel very small and very out of control” (In Search of Tomorrow, 2022, dir. David Weiner), Cameron’s first two Terminator films instead provide an explicit call to action. Don’t go gentle into Armageddon. Take responsibility for what you can control and make a positive impact on your environment. Work for the future you want with the knowledge that, as Cameron said, “no matter how inconsequential you may seem to others or even to yourself, your individual existence may have great value in the future” (Other Voices: Back Through Time, 2001 MGM “Special Edition”). Make your own fate.\n\nAdditional Readings\n\nAsimov, I. (1982). Asimov on Science Fiction. New York: Doubleday.\n\nBailey, T. C., Eng, W., Frisch, M. B., & Snyder, C. R. (2007).

A type of horror film that is often maligned, even within a genre that is already culturally marginalized, but almost always a sure-fire bet to make money. They’ve come in and out of fashion over the past few decades, but much like their most popular antagonists the films are resurrected for a new sequel or remake every few years. As a “child of the ‘80s,” my first memories of horror films revolve around slasher films. Michael Myers (Halloween), Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th 2 onward) and Freddy Kruger (A Nightmare on Elm Street) were U.S. cultural icons, especially in October. There were even Atari, Commodore 64, and Nintendo games for these franchises! Additionally, at least one kid in my grade school Halloween parade dressed as one of these infamous icons every year.\n\nWhat made these films so popular? Horror films, like all films, are constructed media products that reflect the sociocultural forces they emerge from. Film scholars who approach horror films from this perspective argue that the most effective examples of the genre are those that find the vulnerable areas of culture and attack with their life-threatening weapon of choice: whatever will provoke the most fear and dread in us (within reason, of course; audiences are still meant to enjoy the ride). One major shift in horror starting in the 1960s (with Psycho) was to change the source of horror from external threats (e.g., countries outside the U.S. or outer space) to ones that were homegrown, and the closer the threat was to cherished institutions and the family unit, the scarier. By the late 1970s and early 80s, most popular horror films chose this approach, and the slasher genre exploited it for all it was worth.\n\nBoth Black Christmas (1974) and Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984) are model entries in the slasher genre. Black Christmas was most notable for both putting together some of the key elements that we now identify with slasher films (e.g., point-of-view shots used to indicate both the perspective of the killer and also keep up audience tension by keeping the killer’s identity a secret) and for making the young adult victims realistic and relatable. Director Bob Clark specifically wanted to inject social commentary on relevant gender issues (see bonus materials on the Shout Factory 2016 release of the film). These elements would be reinforced culturally in the critically and commercially successful Halloween (1978), a film directed by John Carpenter. These two films were soon followed by a hemorrhage of slasher films, many using various holidays to exploit viewers’ feelings of safety and nostalgia for the cultural practices surrounding these holidays by subverting them with danger and fear.\n\nThis subversion was perhaps too effective, with Silent Night, Deadly Night being the proverbial last straw. Upon its release, the film ignited a firestorm of moral outrage from concerned parents and various conservative activist groups. But why this film and not the previous entries? By the film’s release, 10 years after Black Christmas, the genre conventions were firmly established and this film delivered on the key aspects that both audiences and investors wanted from slasher films (i.e., sex and violence). Silent Night, Deadly Night‘s content could certainly be considered offensive, but did not differ significantly from other slasher films in the amount of violence and sex portrayed. Unlike most other contemporary slashers, however, this film focused on the killer’s backstory. Director Charles E. Sellier, Jr., viewed the film as a psychological study of the personal traumas and social pressures that might make someone a serial killer (see bonus materials on the Anchor Bay 2012 release of the film). Indeed, I found this portion of the film particularly disturbing as it depicts a young child experiencing repeated traumas of physical and psychological abuse.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t the focus on the killer’s traumatic past that protestors cited as the reason for their moral outrage. Rather, they were incensed that filmmakers would dare sully the sanctity of the Christmas season and its beloved cultural icon, Santa Claus. Yes, the disturbed killer dispatches his victims while wearing a Santa suit.\n\nIt did not seem to matter that the killer was only dressed as Santa, rather than having the killer be Santa. Further, this was not the first slasher film to have their killer dressed as Santa (e.g., Christmas Evil (1980) and To All A Goodnight (1980)). The primary concern focused on the wide-spread advertising campaign that prominently displayed images of the killer in Santa attire, especially the film poster that featured a Santa-esque arm emerging from a chimney holding an axe. A barrage of angry phone calls and letters to the production company, letters to newspaper editors, theater picketing, and news interviews with concerned parents followed suit. [Several of these letters are archived on the Anchor Bay 2012 release of the film.] After only a few weeks, the film distribution company recalled the film. They re-released it later with a radically different advertising campaign – one that removed all explicit references to the killer resembling Kris Kringle. Of course, the campaign made full use of the previous controversy to entice potential viewers (i.e., “They tried to ban it! They didn’t want you to see it!”).\n\nHow can we understand the psychological dynamics of this societal reaction? Many of the protestors did not just want the advertising stopped, they wanted the film completely banned. This certainly seems contrary to a society that has enshrined free speech in the First Amendment. Two highlighted editorials explicitly preface their complaint with being in favor of free speech but drew their line at using Christmas and Santa Claus in slasher films. Why? The psychological core of censorship is the desire for protecting society, especially its most vulnerable members, and its cherished morals. Of course, moral values can differ across members of a society and form the core of many controversies (e.g., the “Culture Wars”). Moral outrage and the desire for censorship cuts across the political aisle – both conservative and liberal groups have spearheaded campaigns to censor various types of media. Who is offended all depends on the specific context of the contested text.\n\nMany letters highlighted their motive to protect children, not just from seeing violent content but from having their view of Santa Claus tainted. One writer specifically referred to the film as “an invasion of children’s dreams and fantasies. It’s a form of child abuse.” This person’s complaint is perhaps a tad exaggerated but protecting children from harm has been a consistent thread throughout civil debates concerning media regulation and censorship. But some protestors’ concern went beyond children and extended to the holiday itself. One critic claimed the film “could kill the spirit of the season for good” and at least two other individuals argued this film violated an aspect of U.S. culture that was “sacred.”\n\nI want to focus on the use of the authors’ use of the word “sacred.” Christmas as a holiday certainly holds religious significance for Christians, but the killer was not dressed as a religious figure like Jesus. The cultural figure of Santa is technically a secular symbol. Yet still, these authors seem to imbue Santa with a cultural and moral significance that one usually finds in religious concepts. Ideas of sacredness and purity are important components of how many cultures define morality and are often instilled into cherished cultural symbols (e.g., flags, scripture or other documents key to one’s worldview). When someone behaves in a way that violates something perceived as sacred or pure, people often respond by being morally, and sometimes physically, disgusted. Interestingly, several letter writers and critics described the film using words like “sleazy,” “repulsive,” sick,” “garbage,” “rotten” and a product “of a diseased mind.” All these words have links to psychological research on the physical and emotional reactions people have when they are disgusted by something or afraid of somehow being “contaminated” physically or morally.\n\nEven though most people use concepts of purity and sacredness to some degree when judging moral issues, some focus more heavily on them than others. For individuals who do not imbue Santa Claus with these elements, or who are not particularly focused on purity as an aspect of morality, they likely are not bothered by Silent Night, Deadly Night, at least any more than they would be by the content found in most slasher films. So, if you dig slasher films, or horror more broadly, it’s worth your while to experience one or both iconic films. Also, you’ll never think of the name “Billy” in the same way again.\n\nAdditional Readings:\n\nFisher, R., Lilie, S., Evans, C., Hollon, G., Sands, M., Depaul, D., ... & Hultgren, T. (1999).

Further, the film boasts an industrial/noise soundtrack that is so good it paradoxically melts my face, punishes my ears, and makes me want to dance at the same time. I’m probably in the minority of audience members on this latter part; industrial and noise musical genres are acquired tastes and viewers who are unfamiliar with them may simply feel lost in the cacophony. This audiovisual artistic mix certainly is eclectic, and the narrative seems disjointed at times, though I suspect that at least some of my confusion is because I am not Japanese, nor was I raised in Japan. I’m sure there are cultural nuances lost on me. There are other scholars who have written on the cultural context of the film so I will defer to their expertise in that regard (see Bonus Materials).\n\nI respond predominately to the horror aspects of the film. Though understanding much of what scares us involves cultural analysis, horror theorists argue there are some core elements that humans share regardless of time and place. As famed U.S. horror/sci-fi director John Carpenter argues, “We are all afraid of the same things. That’s what makes these movies so universal…We’re all afraid of death, loss of identity, loss of a loved one, disfigurement, all the horrors of humanity, we all have them, we can all relate” (Halloween: A Cut Above the Rest; 2003, writer Steven C. Smith).\n\nHumans have an innate need to belong, and most people cannot survive long periods of isolation without experiencing both psychological and physical injury. Being alone can be scary and we often seek others for solace when we are afraid: fear and isolation seem intimately linked. Tetsuo only has a handful of actors (six according to IMDB.com), with the main character (named in the credits as “Man”) generally interacting with only one character at a time. Thus, the character seems oddly isolated from society. Additionally, the main character and his romantic partner (named in the credits as “Woman”) seem to cling to each other for fear of loneliness. This seems to be especially true for the main character as he is terrified as his body begins to transition from flesh to metal: “Never leave me, OK?” he asks her desperately (English translation in subtitles).\n\nThis brings me to the other themes common to horror: identity loss and bodily disfigurement via transformation. Three characters change into human/metal hybrids, often in bloody fashion. For the main character, this process is slow and painful, threatening not only his personal sense of self but also making him fear how his partner will react. Our most important relationships are built into our self-concept so when a relationship ends, we lose that part of our “self.” If his partner were to leave the relationship in horror, he would face several threats: damage to his identity at multiple levels in addition to facing the horror of loneliness.\n\nThe second half of the film involves a battle between the main character and the “Metal Fetishist.” The latter starts as the primary antagonist and foil to the main character, but eventually the two meld together into one techno-organic being. Film and cultural scholars have analyzed this outcome as a meditation on the nature of identity and ambivalent “love/hate” relationship humanity often has with technology. Tsukamoto has noted that the “combination of metal and flesh came in part of the wish to express eroticism…I felt I needed a metaphor to express that aspect, which became the invasion and erosion of the body by metal…to express eroticism through iron” (Mes, 2005, pg. 59).\n\nIn North American cinema, perhaps no filmmaker dwells on the themes and anxieties surrounding identity and the body more than director David Cronenberg. Though one could likely find threads that connect most (if not all) of Cronenberg’s films to Testuo, the ones that have the most direct focus on technological fetish/phobia, transformation, and identity are Videodrome (1983), eXistenZ (1999), his remake of The Fly (1986), and his adaptation of J.G. Ballard’s industrial culture classic Crash (1996). Several film scholars and critics have made these connections and perhaps this is unsurprising given Videodrome and The Fly (among other films) were released only a few years before Tetsuo. Both Videodrome and eXistenZ deal with a merging of one’s individual flesh and modern technology, and what that means for one’s self-concept and general sense of reality.\n\nThe Fly deals with the horror of one’s body decaying and changing into something unrecognizable, as well as the ambivalent reactions of one’s loved ones to the change. Phil Nobile, Jr., editor-in-chief of famous U.S. horror magazine Fangoria, argues that The Fly is an allegory “about death and dying and watching someone you love become a different person by degrees…whether that’s about disease and aging or whether that’s just about a relationship running its course” (In Search of Darkness, 2019, dir. David A. Weiner). Cronenberg has made similar assertions, pointing out Western society’s general aversion to the aging process: “Why not look at the processes of aging and dying, for example, as a transformation…It’s very hard to alter our aesthetic sense to accommodate aging, never mind disease” (Rodley, 1997, pg. 82). More broadly, Cronenberg argues that films focused on disease and decay are simply ways to provide “an examination of what is universal about human existence” (Rodley, 1997, pg. 127).\n\nMany viewers of Tetsuo could find elements of these ideas in the film, especially if they are familiar with Cronenberg’s portfolio. Most importantly, Tsukamoto also has acknowledged a creative debt to Cronenberg (Mes, 2005, pg. 63; see also Archival Interviews on Arrow 2021 Blu-ray release). Personally, I am struck by the parallel between the reactions both the romantic partner character in Tetsuo and Veronica, the female lead in The Fly, have to their lovers’ transformations. Both react with a mixture of horror, love, and compassion. Phil Nobile, Jr. argues “[Veronica] is essentially euthanizing her life partner at the end of the film. And her sobs at the end of that are maybe one of the most real moments of ‘80s horror I’ve ever seen.” (In Search of Darkness, 2019). One can finding similar heart-breaking elements in Tetsuo when the romantic partner watches the main character transform, and they fight to the death.\n\nBoth Tetsuo and many of Cronenberg’s films fall within the horror subgenre called “body horror,” which is usually characterized as any film that provokes fear, dread, and disgust via detailed focus on bodily injury and the corporeal nature of humans. There is a long history of psychological research on the emotion of disgust. Disgust generally is considered a “basic” emotion, one that is reflexive, cross-cultural, and exhibited even in young children and infants. This suggests that the emotion is hard-wired into our species and ubiquitous across time and space generally. At its core, disgust has a protective function – people experience it when confronted with situations that could involve pathogens, poisons, or other threats to one’s immediate survival. Biologically, when someone is “disgusted” they wrinkle their nose (effectively closing off their sense of smell to gross smells) and fight the urge to vomit, which would expel anything harmful from one’s body. Various sights, smells, and even sounds, can trigger this response. A common trigger involves bodily fluids, especially blood. Not only are there several scenes in Tetsuo that involve gore, but in a few situations the main character touches pieces of metal in his face that spray blood all over. Graphic bodily injuries also evoke disgust, such as when the main character peels portions of his skin off to expose the bloody, metallic viscera underneath, or when the Machine Fetishist shoves a metal pipe into a self-inflicted leg wound. The sight of insects like flies, cockroaches, and maggots – often associated with decay and disease – can disgust people. In Tetsuo, the Metal Fetishist freaks out when he notices maggots crawling on his leg wound. In short, there are no shortage of disgust-provoking moments in Tetsuo.\n\nTetsuo: The Iron Man is a great example of how films can move us. It is a multi-sensory experience of both pleasure and pain, often at the same time. Audiences are equally disgusted and intrigued. Regardless of our individual histories, personalities, or cultural backgrounds, we are affected by the film experience. We leave the theater transformed – we may not all come out the same way, but at least we know that we are not alone.\n\nBonus Materials\n\nBaumeister, R. F., & Leary, M. R. (1995).

No, this is not a report from the nightly news. This is a description of the world in Little Fish (2021), described by imdb.com as a drama/romance/sci-fi hybrid. The film is set in the fall of 2021 amid a global pandemic. The viral threat is not COVID-19, but rather a neuroinflammatory infection called NIA. This virus can affect anyone with no clear patterns in transmission, progression, or directions for treatment. Essentially, it is a viral version of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. While not directly fatal, the characters grapple with existential questions about what it means to forget their significant others, their shared past, and ultimately all memories of who they are. Further, how do you and your loved ones go forward with life after that? Or, as main character Emma puts it, “How do you build a future when you keep having to rebuild the past?”\n\nThis film does not intentionally reflect our current global anxieties, still struggling through a pandemic ourselves (albeit one with different medical concerns). True, sci-fi stories generally focus on providing audiences with social commentary on current issues, whether they are set in the 23rd century or simply a year or so in advance of our current date (Little Fish was supposed to premiere in 2020 and was in production during 2019). Film scholar Vivian Sobchack argued that sci-fi films focus on “the limits of knowledge and with the imaginative making, unmaking, and remaking of worlds and human identities (1996, p. 316).” That description certainly fits Little Fish, which asks these questions at three levels: individual, interpersonal, and societal. Further, it contrasts these levels, such as when Emma says, “When your disaster is everyone’s disaster, how do you grieve?” Many of us have had to re-define what we consider ‘normal’ since March 2020 and what our lives will be like after the pandemic is over. What aspects of our pre-COVID life can we get back and what will change indefinitely?\n\nLittle Fish certainly presents us with characters experiencing similar concerns, even if the health implications of NIA are different from COVID-19. But the specific threat that NIA presents is one that cuts to our existential core. Humans have a general need for a positive, co"
