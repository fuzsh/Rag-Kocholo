        "text": "Dear Reader:\n\n“Flesh Ripped clean to the Bone… And the Blood runs Red…” […] “When was the last time you were REALLY SCARED!!!?” PSYCHO? The EXORCIST? JAWS? Now there’s DEEP RED. You will NEVER forget it!!!” are the taglines that first catch my eye when combing through my research on Dario Argento’s Deep Red. Argento –the “Italian Hitchcock” – is one of the masters of 1970s and 1980s horror cinema. As Hollywood of that same decade –New Hollywood – produced the likes of Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, Brian De Palma, Steven Spielberg, etc., so did Italy (Argento, Bava, Fulci, Martino, Mattei, etc.). (DA) Please enjoy my analysis of what I believe to be Argento’s greatest masterpiece!\n\n“Italian horror films . . . have been separated from another closely related popular genre, the giallo by [the] criterion of the supernatural,” according to noted historian of Italian cinema Peter Bondanella, drawing the clear lines of mutual artistic inspiration between the two, from generic characters to settings (2009: Bondanella, 306). As a master in both the genres of Italian horror and giallo, filmmaker Dario Argento, exemplifies this creative connection in his seminal giallo Deep Red (1975). While exhibiting some of the genre’s most common devices and tropes, Argento also displays a specific auteur approach to the genre, creating a unique ambient of consuming suspense to convey the contemporary political and sexual anxieties of Italian modernity.\n\nReleased in 1975, Deep Red incorporates the essential narrative, character, and visual components of the giallo:\n\nEmerging in the late-1960s from the works of classical Italian horror auteur Mario Bava, the giallo endured through the 1970s, and Argento’s master giallo thoroughly fulfills the codified expectations of the genre.\n\nFollowing the story of Marcus Daly, a British musician living in Rome who accidentally witnesses the murder of a German medium, Deep Red features an amateur sleuth detective as the protagonist. While attempting to investigate a crime going otherwise unsolved, the humorously-inept police force spend most of their time sloppily eating, telling jokes at crime scenes, and getting comically enraged at burglarized soda machines. The film also utilizes an international cast of British (David Hemmings), French (Macha Méril), and of course, Italian, actors. The fugitive “serial killer” in question also possesses a tragic past, leading them to utilize grisly methods of death to exact a high body count, all while wearing black leather gloves (hands provided by Argento himself). While supernatural forces are usually absent from the world of the giallo, Argento’s “twist” on the identification of the killer is the incorporation of parapsychology (and folklore), in the form of German mind-reader Helga Ulmann and folklore historian Amanda Righetti, as the means of slowly discovering the “twisted” and “perverted mind” and traumatic past of the perpetrator.\n\nMoreover, the killer, throughout the film, appears to be omnipresent, omniscient, and impossibly fast, seeming to know every move in advance, further enhanced by the giallo-typical use of the “killer POV cam.” Prominently, the film also plays on the themes and motifs of vision, eyes, and memory, a very specific thread singular to the giallo. For example, the narrative begins with the mind-reader “seeing” the murderous thoughts of the killer, followed by Marcus “seeing” the murder while potentially “not seeing” the vital painting that seems to have disappeared. The camerawork features numerous close-ups of characters, that of the killer’s and victim’s, eyes, and emphasizes windows, which can be associated with the eyes as windows.\n\nSet in Rome (although shot in Turin), the film takes place in contemporary settings, captured by Argento’s compositions of modern cosmopolitan society, the members of which stand like statues (artificial and stony), not unlike the statue (and fountain) of the Po river (in Turin but supposedly set in Rome) that dominates the square outside Marcus’s apartment. Though Argento’s work highlights the aesthetic shift from Italian horror films of the classical period, which featured more of a “Romantic or Gothic atmosphere [of the German Expressionist-influenced period],” Deep Red utilizes a delicate visual and tonal balance of the Gothic and the contemporary – both grotesque (Bondanella 307). Furthermore, the “house of the screaming child,” an art nouveau villa, has certain gothic predispositions, with its dark and winding passages and its shadowy and cobwebby interior, which contrast the modern apartments, all symmetrical lines and streamlining.\n\nIn the creative transition from the generic codes of giallo to the unique qualities of the Argento giallo, the director’s creative influences play an indelible role. In his 2014 interview with Sight and Sound contributor Pasquale Iannone, Argento’s influences include those whom he worked with early in his career to the masters of suspense, horror, and expressionist cinema.\n\nFor example, at the age of twenty-eight Argento, a then-inexperienced screenwriter, was hired as a writer to contribute to Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). Leone’s creative inspiration is evident in the importance Argento puts on silence rather than dialogue, his employment of extreme close-ups on eyes, and his use of pre-composed scores to guide the production, further narrative, express characterization, and create tone. Argento further utilizes space and silence, like another one of his “major influences,” Michelangelo Antonioni, to “emphasize the sense of mystery, of ambiguity” (Iannone). Argento’s most perceptible creative influence is discernible in his nickname, the “Italian Hitchcock.” In his essential employment of color to construct mise-en-scene and direct emotion, Argento’s films have stylistic similarities with Hitchcock’s, who succeeded in “setting aside narrative logic to terrify audiences with their baroque mise-en-scene and brilliantly executed set pieces” (Iannone).\n\nFinally, Deep Red features many specific artistic and filmic references, from Alfred Hitchcock (in suspense devices, tone, presence of eerie bird sounds, and use of color themes), to Antonioni’s Blow-Up (in the casting of David Hemmings and the eyewitness-narrative), to the film noir-associated Nighthawks (Edward Hopper, 1942) alluded to in the composition of the diner scenes, and lastly, to the casting of Ossessione’s vamp/femme fatale Clara Calamai as the killer.\n\nIn consideration of his artistic influences, and beyond the filmic expectations of the genre, there are many characteristics in Deep Red specific to Argento, who, in addition to Bava, could be considered to have laid the foundations of the giallo.\n\nHis cinematographic virtuosity is on full display, with the smooth and fluid camera movements, interesting angles and POV shots, tracking shots, circular tracking shots, plentiful zoom shots, extreme close-ups (of eyes, faces, and inanimate objects), and prominent and intense use of color (especially red). Argento also focuses on the environment and production design to create an ambience and personality for each location, from the red theatre to Marcus’s bare, modern, and linear loft, to cross-dresser Ricci’s equally modern apartment (instead with warm earthy browns), to Helga’s Expressionist home (with its cragged hallways and expressionist paintings).\n\nThe U.S. trailer, kind of full of spoilers (per usual), but it gives a really good showcase of the film’s tone and the Argento style:\n\nAlso displayed is his specific inclusion of a love story and sense of humor, particularly in the extrications from Gianna’s car and the discussion of love and sex while walking in a cemetery. While explicit sexuality is typical of the giallo, the director places this component in the background, briefly exemplified by the Queer character of Carlo and his cross-dressing lover Ricci (played by actress Geraldine Hooper). Moreover, he chooses to foreground the violence, which is presented as simultaneously graphic, cleverly conceived, uniquely grounded, and understated.\n\nIn Argento’s most acknowledged stroke of genius, instead of using a classical score, he commissioned Italian progressive rock band Goblin to compose the films’ soundtracks, using synthesizers, organs, piano, and percussive instruments to create an interesting and dynamic labyrinth of suspense. PLEASE take a listen, the soundtrack is fantastic.\n\nCheck back here tomorrow for PART 2, when we take a look at what Deep Red was responding to and what the film was saying about contemporary Italy.\n\nWorks Cited"
