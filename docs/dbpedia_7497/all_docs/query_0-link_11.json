These are roughly separated into categories, but ones of personal interest, so I suggest using CTRL+F to search for specific titles/subjects/authors (I recommend searching for last names). Iâ€™m not from the US but this list is compiled from an American perspective mostly because a lot of the books available are from there. Most of these books are in pdf and can be read online, but some are in epub/mobi and can only be downloaded.
