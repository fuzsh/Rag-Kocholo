        "text": "The slasher genre has married gore and sexuality in an unholy bond that has remained strong since its inception.\n\nThe roots of the slasher film began in Italian giallo films of the 1960s and 1970s, well known for their innovative use of violence, gore, and sexuality in their murder mystery narratives.\n\nThese films reflected the freedom of expression in the realms of sex, including female sexuality and homosexuality, that were coming out of the closet and into the mainstream during the time.\n\nHowever, as the genre developed, notably with the release of Tobe Hooper’s iconic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 1974 and Mario Bava’s Bay Of Blood three years previous, we start to see very different codes and conventions forming.\n\nThese films, often cited as the foundations of the slasher genre, established the codes and conventions of near-indestructible serial killers, often driven by revenge, stalking attractive young girls guilty of actions they believe they must be punished for.\n\nThus began the influx of sex and violence within slasher films, often leading to the mutilation of women that became a common trope within the genre.\n\nLaura Mulvey’s theory of the male gaze rose to prominence, in which she speculated that female characters on screen were coded solely to be looked at by both the audience and the male characters on screen who were the bearers of the gaze, created by the cinematic experience that places the viewer in a masculine subject position.\n\nWhile the slasher genre, and horror as a whole, subverted the idea of societal norms though its representations, these same characters were punished for their transgressions such as challenging the idea of heterosexuality or pre-marital sex.\n\nIn terms of the representation of women, many slasher films arguably repressed female characters and condemned the idea of the ‘new woman’ in society at large, reinforcing traditional gender roles by showing female characters being punished by male antagonists.\n\nIn The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, we follow the journey of a group of teenagers on a road trip as they are tortured and killed one by one, apart from one female protagonist, Sally (Marilyn Burns), who survives.\n\nShe does this by refuting stereotypical femininity and sexuality to survive the retribution that her sexually active and feminine friends receive.\n\nUltimately, although Sally escapes antagonist Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) and the Sawyer family she is saved by a male driving a truck who allows her to escape, which further confirms the idea that women within the narrative are subjugated to men.\n\nFollowing this, the release of Halloween in 1978 propelled slasher films into the mainstream, becoming one of the highest-grossing independent films of all-time that led to a boom in the genre.\n\nIt further solidified the template for making a slasher film, consolidating the idea of the ‘final girl’, the last woman left alive to confront the killer at the end of the film.\n\nWhile this can be seen as positive female representation, many final girls of the 70s slasher era adopted masculine qualities in order to survive their ordeals, while other women who embraced their femininity and sexuality were gruesomely killed.\n\nLaurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) can be seen to be a strong female character as she defeats antagonist Michael Myers (Nick Castle), though she adopts masculine traits to achieve this via a masculine-coded costume and a unisex name, as well as being portrayed as virginal and innocent by abandoning her own sexuality and condemning the sexuality of other females in the narrative.\n\nWomen within Halloween, including Laurie, are objectified either through sexualisation or objectification.\n\nJudith (Sandy Johnson), Annie (Nancy Kyes) and Lynda (P.J. Soles) are punished for their sexual promiscuity, whereas Laurie is used as a toy by Michael to be tortured both mentally and physically.\n\nThe success of Halloween led to its conventions being repeated in films such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street among others, ultimately leading to a lull in the genre as audiences became bored.\n\nThen along came the slasher film that would turn the genre on its head.\n\nScream (1996) set out to pay tribute to slasher movies and take a retrospective look at the genre by both acknowledging the codes and conventions of the traditional slasher and subverting them.\n\nThrough its references to other films and their codes and conventions, Scream subverts them by directly addressing the inequality they bred while also giving female characters more autonomy, allowing them to become more resourceful, witty, and savvy than their predecessors.\n\nFrom the very opening scene of the film, we are thrown into a postmodern world that is self-referential and self-reflectional of the genre as a whole.\n\nProtagonist Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore), who is home alone, is called by an anonymous antagonist, who begins questioning her about her favourite ‘scary movies’.\n\nIn response, she expresses an interest in films, and names Halloween as her favourite.\n\nThese metatextual references continue when antagonist Ghostface begins to torment Casey as she shouts, ‘who is there?’ to determine his location.\n\nThey reply, ‘Never say \"who's there?\" Don't you watch scary movies? It's a death wish. You might as well come out to investigate a strange noise or something.’\n\nThe iconic scene reflects the societal change that we are now more accustomed to in the study of film.\n\nThough Casey is murdered by a male antagonist, the focus of her character is on her knowledge of films rather than her costume and body, and she is arguably not objectified within the scene by the viewer.\n\nHer boyfriend, however, is seen from a high angle shot before his murder as if he is being looked down on and he is subservient to the killer. The use of this shows that gender is not a focus when victims are attacked as both men and women are subjected to the same violence.\n\nScream most notably rewrites the notion of the final girl, exploring themes of subverting the gender binary and notions of female sexuality.\n\nProtagonist Sidney (Neve Campbell) can be seen to signify the stereotypical final girl of years gone by as she is not dressed in stereotypically feminine clothing, has a stereotypically masculine name akin to Laurie in Halloween, and obeys patriarchal law as she follows her father’s (Lawrence Hecht) rules regarding sexuality and remains virginal as the narrative begins.\n\nHowever, when she is faced with the danger of a male antagonist she subverts the common conventions of the Final Girl and repeatedly challenges the idea of patriarchal rule by overpowering and outsmarting men.\n\nA pivotal scene within the narrative in terms of conventions and representation occurs when Stu (Matthew Lillard) throws a house party in the wake of the murders committed by Ghostface after school has been closed to keep the students safe.\n\nWithin this scene Stu verbally addresses the codes and conventions of the slasher film and how to survive the narrative whilst watching Halloween by saying that: ‘Number one: you can never have sex. BIG NO NO! BIG NO NO! Sex equals death, okay? Number two: you can never drink or do drugs.’\n\nRandy (Jamie Kennedy) goes on to say: ‘The sin factor! It's a sin. It's an extension of number one. And number three: never, ever, ever under any circumstances say, \"I'll be right back.\" Because you won't be back’\n\nFollowing this self-reflexive quote, Sidney, and her boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich) engage in sexual intercourse at her instigation, and ultimately survives throughout the film and its subsequent sequels to face the killer each and every time.\n\nLikewise, protagonist Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), is depicted as a strong female character through her high-powered job in a male-dominated career path as a news anchor, and her cutthroat determination to get the information she needs from other characters, which also includes actively using her sexuality as a means to exert power over her male counterparts.\n\nBoth women maintain their femininity and exert power over patriarchy without having to adopt masculine traits or a phallic weapon when challenging their antagonists.\n\nIn the final scenes of the film, it is revealed that both Stu and Billy have been perpetrating the murders in order to both re-enact their favourite scary movies, and to avenge Billy’s parents as it was Sidney’s mother who had an affair with his father that destroyed his family life.\n\nThis can be seen as chastising female sexuality as the victims have been punished for the sexuality of a female, though it can also be seen that female characters dominate the narrative as the killings are triggered and controlled by female power.\n\nGender and power roles are further subverted when it is revealed that Sidney’s father has been captured by the pair and will be framed for their murders, so it is up to Sidney to save her father in the role as a damsel in distress.\n\nAs Billy and Stu stab each other to make their deception convincing it can be argued that gender norms are subverted as the repeated penetration of each other and pleasure they show has links to homosexuality and refutes the heterosexual norm that men had been stereotyped as within slasher films to this point.\n\nContrastingly, Sidney and Gale do not adopt the traditional knife to kill their antagonists; Stu is killed by a TV crushing his head and is metaphorically killed by his passion for slasher films as he forgets the conventions he has rigidly stuck to and allows himself to be overpowered by a female protagonist, and Gale shoots Billy as he attempts to kill Sidney.\n\nThe women stand over the bodies of their antagonists and are framed in a low angle shot which holds connotations of power and strength, further solidifying their status as postmodern heroes within the genre.\n\nFollowing the first film, Scream spawned an entire franchise that continued to revolutionise the representation of women within slasher films."
