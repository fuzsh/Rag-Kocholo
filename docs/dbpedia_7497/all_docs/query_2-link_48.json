        "text": "This year, female filmmakers like Australian newcomer\n\nJennifer Kent and Belgian director Hélène Cattet took us inside the tortured\n\nheadspaces of their films’ haunted protagonists. Their exceptional horror\n\nmovies—“The Babadook” and “The Strange Color of Your Body's Tears” (which\n\nCattet co-directed)—examine personal grief, familial trauma and sexual anxiety\n\nin new and compelling ways. These films are, in a sense, ghost stories about\n\nwomen who cling to their pasts, but can no longer hide within.\n\nPathological memory, ritualized madness, and the traumatized\n\nwoman ties Mona Fastvold’s “The Sleepwalker” to Kent’s tale about the\n\nunraveling of a single mother. “The Babadook’s” still-grieving widow, Essie\n\nDavis’ Amelia, mourns the loss of her husband, her career and her dreams for\n\nher family—now plagued with exasperation and resentment surrounding her\n\ntroubled child, Noah Wiseman’s Samuel. Amelia sinks into an insomniac haze\n\nwhile Samuel howls with emotional pain. He is the manifestation of her loss and\n\nthe only voice she has left—until the incantation uttered during a bedtime\n\nstorybook ritual invokes the monster within.\n\nThe physicality of pain and suffering, which replaces the\n\ntraditional genre cinema depiction of the (naked) female body, also appears in\n\n“The Sleepwalker.” We glimpse the nude frames of adult siblings Kaia (Gitte\n\nWitt) and Christine (Stephanie Ellis) within the first few minutes of the\n\nmovie, but their wan bodies—draped in the nightgowns of little girls—are\n\nvessels of childhood trauma. Kaia is waifish, frail. She, at turns, feels great\n\nshame about her physical afflictions, but also traipses across the forest\n\ngrounds of her secluded family estate dressed in the sheer tatters of a fairy\n\ntale nymph. Christine wanders the hallways, unconcerned with her nudity like a\n\nchild. She is hypersexual, impulsive. She returns to the family home to reopen\n\nthe wounds of the past, while Kaia continues to bury them. “She has a hard time\n\nseparating her fictions from reality,” Kaia says. And so Christine is the one\n\nwho sleepwalks—restless, caught in the uneasy shift between truth and an\n\n“unconscious” coping mechanism that may or may not be real. These female\n\nbodies—Amelia’s, Kaia’s, Christine’s—express fear. They are isolated\n\nbodies—costumed specters that float above the bed in a lucid dream and escape\n\ninto the woods like feral children.\n\nIn a genre that is a study in extremes, women often have\n\nlittle agency. Complicated, multifaceted and flawed female characters are still\n\nfew. Ana Lily Amirpour’s “A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night”—an Iranian vampire\n\nfilm with the posturing of a spaghetti western as told by ‘80s-era Jim Jarmusch\n\nand ‘90s-era Gregg Araki—opens with a lament from a sleazy television lawyer\n\nabout women slaving away for their husbands only to be replaced by a “younger\n\nmodel.” The pressures of female perfection and obedience pervades the film—from\n\nthe omnipresent chador worn by traditional Iranian women, to the phantom of a\n\nfamily matriarch whose departure is blamed for a grieving father’s devastating\n\ndrug addiction and depression. A local thug runs roughshod over “Bad City’s”\n\nresidents, threatening a woman he pimps out where it hurts her most: he can\n\nmake certain she will never become a mother if she doesn’t stay in line.\n\nAlthough the dial-a-lawyer warns of mayhem to women across the airwaves, Sheila\n\nVand’s fanged and cloaked titular “Girl” is the cruel city’s lone woman who\n\nviolently defies her role. She has romantic impulses that simmer to the\n\nsurface, remnants of her humanity, now gone. But her otherness makes it easy to\n\ntaunt the men who roam the streets at night begging for a freebie from the\n\nneighborhood sex workers and to terrorize a young boy beggar who isn’t so poor\n\nthat he owns a skateboard. “I’ll be watching you for the rest of your life,”\n\nshe hisses to him in reprimand. It is a twisted role reversal that subjugates\n\nthe men much as they do to women from the day they are born, and later, bred\n\nfor submission.\n\nIt’s essential to note that although the women of “A Girl\n\nWalks Home Alone at Night” are faced with an impossible ideal, they are\n\nfallible and never punished. The bandaged and newly button-nosed rich girl, who\n\nseeks only to make our wilted male protagonist, Arash (played by Arash\n\nMarandi), her plaything, is entitled to express her sexuality. “A Girl Walks\n\nHome Alone at Night” portrays women prostituting themselves, being unkind to\n\nmen, doing drugs, and, yes, killing, but unlike horror cinema’s most\n\nprovocative female characters, they are not slaughtered for their supposed\n\nsins.\n\nThis notion of the “good” and “troubled” woman is subverted\n\nin “The Babadook’s” portrayal of motherhood. It is still taboo to admit\n\ncomplex, ambivalent feelings about being a mother. Horror has a long history of\n\ncondemning mothers for going against the self-sacrificing type. Marge Thompson,\n\nmother of “A Nightmare on Elm Street’s” Nancy Thompson, is plagued by\n\nalcoholism and succumbs to child killer Freddy Krueger. She is guilty of\n\nhelping to murder the madman, who now stalks teens in their dreams from beyond\n\nthe grave, and her maternal missteps are too great to allow her to live.\n\nNancy’s father Don Thompson is also guilty of murdering Freddy, but survives\n\nthe ordeal for the next several films. The mother is essential, intrinsically\n\nlinked to her child’s survival. Amelia’s love for Samuel drives “The\n\nBabadook’s” story, but we are privy to the struggling mother’s neglect and\n\nhostility toward him—which later possesses her with murderous intent. “You\n\ndon’t have to be fine, you know?” a friend reassures Amelia as the cracks\n\nof her psyche start to show. It is the truest line spoken in “The Babadook”\n\nthat is especially resonant for a lot of women—and a point where the film\n\nsurpasses the trappings of the maternal horror subgenre. In perhaps the film’s\n\nmost novel plot twist, Amelia chooses to learn to live with the monster, to\n\nacknowledge it. It is never completely vanquished. None of us are granted such\n\nabsolutes.\n\nThe presence of women is similarly not intended to bring\n\nresolution to the male protagonists in “The Strange Color of Your Body’s\n\nTears.” Taking its visual cues from the “gialli,” the lurid and stylish Italian\n\nhorror thrillers from the ’60s and ‘70s, the film’s breathtaking mystery is set\n\ninside a labyrinthine apartment where the walls groan, heaving with every\n\nbreath. Dan (Klaus Tange) is drawn into the bowels of the building in search of\n\nhis missing wife (Ursula Bedena). But he’s a mere key in “Strange Color’s”\n\ndizzying premise, unlocking the dark memories of the movie’s women. A scene\n\nprecedes this discovery, in which one couple in the apartment ceremoniously\n\ncopulates, ostensibly summoning a strange noise in their bedroom. The man’s\n\nunexplainable entrance to the source through a peephole he drills into the\n\nceiling opens a door to the secrets contained within. He is, figuratively, a\n\nkey. In a self-aware moment in Dario Argento’s 1982 giallo “Tenebrae,” one\n\nfemale character ironically condemns the genre’s women as “victims, ciphers,”\n\nbefore becoming a victim herself. Like “A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,”\n\n“Strange Color” employs a bit of role reversal, making Dan, and the film’s\n\nother male protagonists, the cipher—interchangeable, disposable. As the\n\napartment yawns to life, women seemingly materializing from within the walls,\n\npast traumas and violent fantasies are explored. The women are given voice,\n\nremembered. This recalls Lucio Fulci’s 1977 giallo “Seven Notes in Black,” in\n\nwhich the eerie chime of Virginia’s wristwatch echoing behind the wall that\n\nholds her prisoner signals to us that even though she’s doomed, she will still\n\nbe heard."
