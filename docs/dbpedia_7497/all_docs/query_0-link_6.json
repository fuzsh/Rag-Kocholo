Songs of the sighs of a sorrowful widow, the heartfelt promises to a friend on their deathbed, the haunting whispers of a ghost to it’s murderer – music is one of the most profound ways we can express or respond to the end of life experience.\n\nThe following playlist is comprised of women who have constructed and composed aural memento mori in this regard. As humans, we occupy a unique place in the saga of mortality, and these women in particular offer illuminating perspectives on the subject as it relates to the afterlife, funerals & wakes, ancestral memories, etc.\n\nThere are, of course, songs not included here which you might have on your own personal “Death and the Maiden” playlist – there is so much fantastically beautiful, heartbreaking, music to choose from that taps into our experiences with death and dying, and so your results may vary! Music is intensely personal and so, this list reflects the author’s own experiences. Be sure to comment on the Death and the Maiden blog with your own suggestions or post a link to your personal playlist as well!\n\n(…and don’t forget about their launch giveaway for a copy of The Undertaker’s Daughter, by Kate Upton!)\n\nTrack List:\n\nO Death Jen Titus // Waiting Around to Die The Be Good Tanyas // Born To Die Lana Del Rey // Harmonica Anna von Hausswolff // Cross Bones Style Cat Power // Wakes Nina Nastasia // Sleeping Dead Emily Jane White // Caleb Meyer Gillian Welch // Fancy Funeral Lucinda Williams // Long Ride Home Patty Griffin //Family Dar Williams // Buried in Teeth Mariee Sioux // The Dirt Mirel Wagner // Into Dust Mazzy Star // Herb Girls Of Birkenau Rasputina // Eulogy La Vampires & Zola Jesus // Gallows Cocorosie // A Lily For The Spectre Stephanie Dosen // White Fire Angel Olsen // Graveyard Feist // Suzanne & I Anna Calvi // Many Funerals Eisley // Happy Phantom Tori Amos\n\n✥ comment\n\n13 Feb\n\n2015\n\nthis, that, and the other thing (viii)\n\ncategories: art, music, unquiet things\n\nLook at these sassy beelzebroads! Though the imagery might lead you to believe this is a film about Hell’s Elite “cackling diabolically over the latest batch of the damned”, it is but a story of common gold diggers and larceny. (h/t Cabinet of Curiosities)\n\nSpeaking of Sarah Troop over at Cabinet of Curiosities, do be sure to take a peek at her new project, Death and the Maiden, a blog exploring the relationship between women and death. The site launches today and there is a giveaway for Kate Mayfield’s The Undertaker’s Daughter!\n\nOne of my favorite instagram accounts lately is creepycomics, which is brimming with cheesy, pulpy horror goodness from yesteryear.\n\nOh my goodness. I cannot wait. Crimson Peak is going to be marvelous.\n\nOsmo, A beginners guide to constructing the cosmos from Loop.pH on Vimeo.\n\nOSMO is an experiment in totally transforming the experience of an awkward public space into something of wonder and tranquility.\n\nVIDEO LUST: moments of romantic obsession for video memories of the past. “…a plethora of horror, fantasy and sci-fi soundtracks that work magically together. This mix arrives right on time for Valentine’s Day and should be used to guide you in whatever direction your night takes on the 14th.” (via)\n\nAdult Wednesday Adams vs. Catcallers. I love you, Adult Wednesday Adams. (via Jon)\n\n“What Kind Of Man” the first video from Florence + The Machine’s new album, ‘How Big How Blue How Beautiful’. It is a heavy one; frighteningly intense and strangely cathartic, and brimming with that strange, dazzling energy unique to this lady. I think I love it.\n\nJohn Allison revisits university life in Giant Days. There are very few webcomics I read anymore, but I have been peeking in at John Allison’s work for over a decade. I even had the opportunity to interview him a few years ago! Most recently he has been collaborating on a short run print version featuring some much beloved characters.\n\nHorror’s scariest trend is the nonexistent black film maker.\n\nExplore the world’s most morbid tourist attractions.\n\nThe ANGRY MORON is back!\n\nJohn Coulthart’s psychedelic playlists\n\nSeven cocktails based on L’Atelier Givenchy fragrances\n\nComics and the Gothic (h/t David!)\n\nCathy CK: Cathy comics replaced with Louis C.K. quotes\n\n✥ 3 comments\n\n12 Feb\n\n2015\n\nFor Your Ears, again\n\ncategories: music, unquiet things\n\nI’ve a habit of constantly hunting down new music, new sounds, new treats for my ears. If I am not listening to something new, I feel like I am stagnating, suffocating. I suppose it’s not really fair to all the great old stuff I like (as in …older than last week) because I never listen to the same thing twice anymore! Oh well, there are worse problems to have.\n\nSo then: I don’t know about you, but I do love to share my obsessions with like-minded folks and kindred spirits, and as such I think I will regularly start to feature the new things on heavy rotation for me, in a once monthly (or whatever, don’t hold me to a schedule)\n\nFor Your Ears posting. Don’t expect lengthy reviews; I know what I like but it’s often difficult to articulate exactly why I like something, so you won’t find that here. Nonetheless, I hope that you will find something you enjoy!\n\nMore new stuff from The Twilight Sad, who sound like all the music I never listened to when I was younger.\n\nXunolm, Asleep in the Shattered Mirror. “…a perfect score for some rustbelt cyberpunk dystopia, or a futuristic zombie apocalypse. It’s both sterling shining chrome and crumbling decadence” (via forestpunk)\n\nDreamy folkstress Marissa Nadler covering Elliott Smith\n\nA new solo project featuring some live sets from Eric Quach, one of my favorite drone artists.\n\nNew music from Atlanta’s Royal Thunder, whose second album, Crooked Doors, will be out in April.\n\n“…briny doom-laden folktronica” from Snow Ghosts.\n\nTranscend, from Ahimsa, released inDecember of 2014. Not sure what to say about it. It falls under post-rock. I like post-rock.\n\nStephan Mathieu’s Nachtstücke is a “limitless sonic aura” which “forges eveningness as a tangible, sensible thing”.\n\nThe Unthanks’ latest album is “filled to the brim with the epic, the grandiose, and the fairytale-­esque.” (via forfolkssake)\n\n✥ 6 comments\n\n6 Feb\n\n2015\n\nthis, that, and the other thing (vii)\n\ncategories: art, music, unquiet things\n\nAfter another one of their pals posts a stolen baby pic on Faeriebook, Moth Catfrost and Feathers Peppershimmer wonder if they will ever kidnap a human baby and replace it with a changeling, or if they are destined to be alone and unhated forever. (via Carissa)\n\nHeilung is a new project between Kai Uwe Faust and Christopher Juul. Heilung is sounds from the northern european iron age and viking period, “using everything from running water, human bones, reconstructed swords and shields up to ancient frame drums and bronze rings in the songs.” The lyrics contain original texts from rune stones and preserved spear shafts, amulets and other artifacts. (via Jennifer)\n\nIf you enjoy the aesthetic appeal of animal antlers but hate the idea of taxidermy, Elkebana might be just the thing for you. The wall-mounted system relies on symmetrical sets of flowers or tree branches and gets its name from ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arrangement.\n\nHarper Lee to publish new novel, 55 years after To Kill a Mockingbird …which sounds fantastic, doesn’t it? Until you read this, which is troubling to say the least: Questions I Have About The Harper Lee Editor Interview\n\nIceland to build first temple to Norse gods since Viking age “I don’t believe anyone believes in a one-eyed man who is riding about on a horse with eight feet,” said Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, high priest of Ásatrúarfélagið, an association that promotes faith in the Norse gods. “We see the stories as poetic metaphors and a manifestation of the forces of nature and human psychology.” Well, that’s a bummer. But still, something else to visit on our next trip back!\n\nDead Dads and other Ugly Things. Ashley Tibbets talks about her dead dad and how we all have our “dead dads,” the things in our lives that are “decidedly unpretty, undesirable, imperfect, and that might make people feel uncomfortable. We all have our cross to bear and maybe life would be richer if we weren’t afraid to expose them, if we weren’t afraid to let others expose theirs.”\n\nJeff Bridges wants to help you fall asleep “The album is essentially Jeff Bridges, quietly, creakily musing on things like sleeping and waking, the irony of waking his wife up to record her for a tape that’s supposed to induce slumber, and whether or not people can meet in dreams.”\n\nMonsters of Grok: Fake band tee shirts for histories biggest thinkers. So cool!\n\nValentines Gift Guides? I suppose I could make one, but let’s face it, I am lazy and these ladies already did a fantastic job with it. Victoria at Eaumg has one focused on treating one’s self to life’s little luxuries, and as her taste is exquisite, I probably want all of it. Haute Macabre has another great one, and lastly, the Morbid Blonde over at The Chick and the Dead has put together a rather salty list. Also over at Renee Ruin there is a sort of anti-Valentines day gift, if you will: The ANTI necklace collection. I’ll take all three. But I guess I’ll have to buy them for myself.\n\n✥ 2 comments\n\n3 Feb\n\n2015\n\nthat fragment of ruin\n\ncategories: music, unquiet things\n\nI’ve decided that 2015 is the year for literary inspired mixes (primarily ghost stories and weird tales, I imagine.)

Their previous works (Wolf Notes, 2011; Succession, 2013) have expressed profound sadness at the ecological losses of the upland landscape of south-west Cumbria, where they have lived since 2011. They have observed the absence of deer, fell fox and wolf, whose names survive only in place-names. They have found the ghost forests of Furness in the buried pollen drifts of alder, birch and oak. The music, words and art they have created in response to these discoveries are forms of elegy, but they also offer glimmers of hope for a return…To play this music is to participate in its summoning – to become a node in a lattice of light.”\n\n“His most personal album to date, The Summoner is based around the 5 stages of mourning and is made after a year of losing several close friends. Hard enough material to work on, he decided to add a 6th stage, entitled The Summoning to be able to arrive at the finalé, Acceptance.”\n\n✥ 2 comments\n\n16 Jan\n\n2015\n\nthis, that, and the other thing (vi)\n\ncategories: art, music\n\nPrecious Australian weirdies The No Frills Twins have released their debut single, “God Bless The Internet”.

I believe it is a special edition for the 200th anniversary of Le Fanu’s birthday (published October, 2014).\n\nForever Doomed includes essays and comics by Tenebrous Kate that take a tongue-in-cheek but loving look at the theme of doom.

Here’s a hodge podge list of things I either stumbled across or that were recommended to me, in no particular order, that I ended up being pretty thrilled with this year.\n\n1. For some time now I have noticed my skin is acting in strange and unexpected ways. The nose and forehead that use to be an oil-slicked nightmare are now dry and tight, and the once plump, moony cheeks, well…they are still plump and moony, but they are now blotchy and flaky, as well. Wearing any sort of makeup became impossible; no matter how I exfoliated or how much I moisturized, my visage still resembled and felt like an awful, patchy mask. The final straw was when my sister glanced over at me, did a double take and demanded “what THE HELL is wrong with your face??”\n\nShortly after that, quite unprompted by me, I noticed a facebook friend waxing poetic regarding a natural line of skin care over on etsy, Naturallogic.\n\nTruly Natural, Organic Skin Care & Body Care, handmade FRESH from original recipes based on Nutrition, Holism, Plant Medicine & Ancient Practices, using Certified Organic & Wild Harvested, Food-Grade Super Foods, Phyto Nutrients, Clinically Proven Bioactives, Botanical Extracts, Enzymes & Pure Herb, Plant & Flower Oils.\n\nApologies for slipping into hyperbole but this stuff is nothing short of miraculous. Within a weekend my skin had completely turned around. I was beyond ecstatic. The proprietress of the shop was super helpful and helped me put together a regimen that would work for my skin type, and thoughtfully included a few extra samples as well. Note that I am *not* getting paid to say any of these things, nor am I getting any sort of free product. Don’t I wish! Because to be completely honest, it is not inexpensive. But it is absolutely worth it.\n\nI actually just placed a second order to replace all of my empty bottles – this is the first time I have ever been so happy with such things that I used them all up! Also note: I purchased the wrong toner the second time around. I don’t mind though, because it smells incredible.\n\nUnfortunately, despite my skin doing much better, I am still having a hard time with makeup.\n\nI can’t find a foundation or even a BB cream (forget about concealers or powder) that won’t eventually flake up and look awful on me a few hours after I apply it. What works for you? Any suggestions are appreciated!\n\n2. I don’t wear lipstick often. Maybe four times a year. I have a horrible fear that it will migrate to my teeth and no one will tell me and I’ll be walking around all day completely unawares, with a garish crayon-toothed smile. I also worry that with all the lip biting I do, I actually end up eating most of my lipstick, which is pretty gross if you think too long on it.\n\nI was intrigued though, when I saw several folks wearing Limecrime’s Velveteen lip color in ‘Salem’. (It is sold out on the site, but you can also find it at Urban Outfitters and a few other places if you poke around). It’s such a unique color and it reminds me of all of my favorite parts of the 90’s – dark floral babydoll dresses, velvet chokers, stompy boots. The formula too is really lovely; it looks like a gloss, but it goes on completely matte.\n\n3. Last year for the holidays my beau gifted me with Isa Chandra Moskowitz’s Isa Does It, which is a gorgeous book with a million wonderful vegan recipes (we are not vegan, nor even vegetarian, but we do like to experiment!) and hands down, the recipe that I have made the most is her Roasted Red Pepper Mac & “Cheese”. It is so, so good. Make it tonight. Seriously. You don’t even have to buy the book, here is the recipe:\n\nhttps://www.theppk.com/2013/10/roasted-red-pepper-mac-cheese-video/\n\n4, 5, and 6. (Music)\n\nYear end find: Tetrolugosi. I’ll admit, I was already in love when I read this described as Fabio Frizzi and Riz Ortolani by way of Gary Numan and Ladytron.\n\nPreviously mentioned: Dance With The Dead. These guys create the dark, 1980s sci-fi/horror soundtrack for your life that you didn’t know you needed.\n\nThe Bombay Royale: The Island of Dr. Electrico. “…from lonesome spaghetti to surf-rock, from psychedelia to spine-bending space disco, overlaid with the voices of our protagonists The Tiger and The Mysterious Lady”. Ah! How can you resist that description? I couldn’t.\n\n7, 8, 9 and 10. (Cinema)\n\nOnly Lovers Left Alive. You’d probably be hard pressed to find a year-end list that this did not make, eh? Somber, sad, wicked, clever, impossibly elegant. All of these things. A favorite for sure, and not just for now – perhaps all time.\n\nByzantium. Another brooding, elegant vampire film, but a bit of a peculiar take on familiar lore.\n\nThe Strange Color of Your Body’s Tears. A lush, surreal, deliberately disorienting neo-giallo. the sooner you abandon hope of following the story or figuring out the plot in favor of allowing your eyeballs to be dizzied and dazzled, the better you’ll be. The exquisite, labyrinthine apartment building made for a strange and wonderful character on it’s own.\n\nUnder The Skin. Moody and strange and mysterious. It’s difficult to say more about this one. Can you tell I am awful at reviews? That’s really all I can tell you. That, and don’t read the book – it’s utter rubbish.\n\n11, 12, 13, and 14. (Books and Literature)\n\nThe Goldfinch by Donna Tartt. I read this at the very beginning of 2014 so most of the details elude me, but what I took away from it mostly is that it is a beautiful love letter to great art. I found it an absolutely gripping, compelling read and with my attention span nowadays, that’s saying quite a bit.\n\nThrough The Woods by Emily Carroll. Beautifully designed, meticulously crafted tales of quiet, nightmarish horror. An equally disturbing and breathtaking creation.\n\nSex Criminals by Matt Fraction & Chip Zdarsky. Bizarre, bawdy, brazen. Ridiculously good fun.\n\nThe Children of Old Leech. A Laird Barron tribute anthology full of terrifying things. whispered of in darkened forests beyond the safe comfort of firelight. Standout stories for me were “Love Songs From The Hydrogen Jukebox”, “Notes For ‘Barn In The Wild'”, “Ymir”, and “Tenebrionidae”\n\nBonus round, television series category! True Detective, Penny Dreadful, Les Revenants, and Mirror Black.\n\nExtra super bonus round! Kimchi Furikake rice seasoning. This stuff is amazing.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite discoveries in 2014?
