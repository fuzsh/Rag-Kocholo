        "text": "Dear Reader:\n\n“I’m not bad. I’m just drawn that way.” –\n\nJessica Rabbit, Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Zemeckis, 1988)\n\nAs long as film noir has been critically recognized, whether as a movement, genre, or style, the tools and means of production have been predominantly in the hands of male directors, producers, and writers and its attributed meanings defined by the pens of male critics and historians. Consequently, the significance – both sociocultural and textual – of female representation is one largely dictated by the masculinist discourse, even as the criticism shifts from the classical period to neo-noir.\n\nWe’re going to talk genuine film theory today, so let’s go through some key terms first.\n\nPhenomenology is the study of lived experience, of the interactions between human consciousness and the world. During the 20th century, it was taken up by French and German philosophers (Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty) and expanded into varying disciplines and schools.\n\nFemale existentialist philosophers like Simone de Beauvoir, oft neglected in favor of her male contemporaries or fellow French existentialists (Sartre, Camus), was one of the earliest to apply phenomenological inquiries to a specifically female experience. What could be more powerful than turning a critical eye to the complexities of the female experience? The lived, embodied, sensory experience.\n\nLooking back to the consciousness-raising methods of second-wave feminism is a solid example. Women sharing their experiences in order to express themselves, find commonalities, and empower them towards change. This exercise is not without criticisms, especially in regards to inclusivity and intersectionality (i.e. women of color, trans or non-cis women, queer women, women with mental or physical disabilities, neurodivergent women, etc.) In film criticism, phenomenology (as well as the focus on affect) have emerged again in the discourse, shifting analyses to direct or sensory experience rather than say, semiotics or psychoanalysis.\n\nLifting the structure and methodology of Kate Ince’s (2007) application of feminist phenomenology to contemporary women’s cinema, I argue that female filmmakers working within neo-noir produce films which reflect on and rebel against those structures, especially with respect to construction and portrayal of female subjectivity. Furthermore, a close-textual analysis of Variety (Bette Gordon, 1983) and In the Cut (Jane Campion, 2003) exemplifies how the older form of genre study and contemporary trends towards phenomenology can intersect to rediscover a crucial piece missing in feminist critical history.\n\nTo approach this unique intersection, an interdisciplinary and dialogical understanding of the key texts – psychoanalytic, generic, and sociocultural – that undergird this fundamentally phenomenological argument is necessary.\n\nWalking the Streets of Female/Feminist Noir Criticism\n\nThe first female-authored, female-centered criticism on film noir was published in 1978, simply titled Women in Film Noir (with two subsequent editions published later). Although largely informed by the classical psychoanalytic theory that dominated feminist film theory (such that drove Laura Mulvey), three distinct contributions remain essential.\n\nFirst, Kaplan et al. looks to the means of production for the meanings of the product, specifically how “women occupy a tangential position in relation to production and culture . . . [and] are defined as constitutive functions in society rather than among its producers” (12). [Note: This preceded the reappraisal of films of Golden Age filmmaker Ida Lupino and subsequent scholarship in the 1990s, including a piece on this blog – LINK.]\n\nSecond, they recognize that women of the genre are oblique ‘subjects’ but fundamental ‘objects’ to its ideological queries. Lastly, the book unpacks how the femme is made fatale through her sexual objectification, nonconformity to expected gender roles (i.e. wife, mother), and interestingly, her absence of a family, friends, or past. In particular, a primary source of subjecthood denied women in classical noir is the power of voiceover and narration.\n\nIn Film Genre: Hollywood and Beyond (2005), Barry Langford extends these ideas to the area of genre study more generally. He asserts that while film noir is an elusive term applied retroactively to a set of films influenced directly by political and industrial factors, neo-noir is a genre that necessitates self-awareness, a knowledge of how noir has been critically defined and publicly understood. However, even as women are central to noir, it is the “pathologies of masculinity” (Thomas, qtd. in Langford: 218) that are at stake, and the revivalist form brings greater ambiguity to its gender politics even as it engages in greater sexual explicitness.\n\nFurthermore, cognizance of these filmic legacies that “constitute classic noir means that they can be venerated, payed homage to, manipulated, and developed,” or as Kate Stables (4) argues, “pillaged, adulterated, and reconstituted” (Lindhop, 9). Therefore, when filmmakers retread the same misogynistic pathways of their forefathers in uncritical imitation (*cough, cough Brian De Palma*), the alternative roads less taken (such as by female filmmakers) demand recognition and critical parity.\n\nIntegrating feminist analysis into reevaluation of the genre’s conventions and gendered characterizations, Julie Grossman’s Rethinking the Femme Fatale in Film Noir (2009) strikes an astounding blow to the establishment positions on the origin, classification, and significance of the femme fatale figure. She charges academia with discursive tunnel vision, narrowly focusing on a handful of female characters in noir, and effectively losing the forest for the trees, just as criticism has ignored female-directed noir in favor of an unquestioned male canon.\n\nDrawing from examples in classical noir as well as later genre revivals, Grossman incorporates the complex historical, social, and political structures and redraws the multiplicity of female experience within the genre. More often than not, the fatale ascribed to female noir characters proves ironic, she contends, as it is the violence and brutality of male characters and their masculine, patriarchal world that victimizes and destroys any that resist. This resistance, Grossman argues, manifests as desire, ambition, subversion, and occasionally, perceived madness. Although not addressing phenomenological theorists directly, she does ask a seemingly obvious question: What do the female noir figures have to say about female fantasy, desire, ambition and the lived experience of womanhood?\n\nFemale filmmakers like Annabel Jankel (D.O.A., 1988), Maggie Greenwald (The Kill-Off, 1990), Lili Fini Zanuck (Rush, 1991), Lizzie Borden (Love Crimes, 1992), Tamra Davis (Guncrazy, 1992), Lana and Lilly Wachowski (Bound, 1996), Mary Harron (American Psycho, 2000), and Karyn Kusama (Destroyer, 2018) who have engaged with neo-noir portray this reality of and resistance to sexual violence, toxic masculinity, and patriarchal segregation of private and public spheres.\n\nTextual analysis of Variety (Gordon, 1983) and In the Cut (Campion, 2003) reveals a pursuit of these same questions and concerns with potential answers sought through an emphasis on the female body and voice as well as expressions of desire and rebellion.\n\nCase Study: Body, Speech, and Desire in Variety and In the Cut\n\nVariety follows aspiring New York writer Christine (Sandy McLeod) who, desperate for work, gains employment as a ticket-seller at the eponymous adult theater and finds herself drawn to one of the criminal patrons.\n\nIn the Cut revolves around New York writing professor Frannie Avery (Meg Ryan) who finds herself attracted to a hard-boiled police detective investigating a serial killer case. Both are set in a sleazy urban milieu rife with criminality, small and grotesque, and where narrative events, tinged with paranoia and anxiety, go bump in the night. There are hard-boiled investigators, predators, desirous women, sex workers, and mysteries a foot – wholesale cornerstones of noir.\n\nPurposefully, each film skips over the typical noir protagonist – the determined journalist (Christine’s boyfriend, Mark – Will Patton) and the morally-ambiguous cop (Detective Malloy – Mark Ruffalo) – to instead center the lived female experience within the genre. However, both also focus on female protagonists whose literary voice goes unseen, have complex relationships with their mothers, other women, and romantic partners, and are physically driven by desire.\n\nVariety visualizes the contemporaneous feminist film criticism of theorists like Laura Mulvey (1975) while also refusing to fetishize the body of the female protagonist. Instead, she portrays the body as a vehicle for rebellion. Historically, Variety situates itself during the charged debates within the feminist movement of the 1970s and 1980s, anti-pornography feminists on one side and sex-positive feminists on the other (Ferguson, 2017). On a narrative level, Variety dramatizes the relationship between women, their bodies, the sex industry, and desire.\n\nWith a repetitive structure, Variety shifts between three key locations – Christine’s apartment, the Variety theater and other adult establishments, and the dark streets of New York – but always with her bodily and spatial experience at the center. Boxed within the frame of Variety’s ticket kiosk, Christine is on display for the would-be patrons of the adult theater, a potential she notices when describing the job to her boyfriend Mark: “Sometimes I think maybe they come there because they think I’m some kind of attraction.” Gordon portrays the work’s tediousness through Christine’s bodily discomfort, such as the stiffness of prolonged sitting, bathroom breaks, and the evasive eye contact between her and the customers.\n\nHer presence illustrates the acute paradox of both Mulvey’s “Visual Pleasure” and noir’s gender politics (the former mentions the genre by name): The male patrons attend to view pornographic images wherein female bodies are the center spectacle – cut and abstracted into fetishized anatomical parts – for a sexual narrative that maximizes “visual pleasure.”\n\nHowever, the habitation of an actual woman within that same space is provocative and threatening to the gendered delineation of public and domestic spheres, as Christine reflects, “but mostly I think they are just sort of embarrassed that I’m there.” This is extended further when Christine enters an adult store to browse the magazine section and video rooms; the male patrons respond with both confusion and revulsion, shunning her spatial violation of their centers of pleasure-fulfillment.\n\nChristine receives similar reactions in the places she frequents – the dark, unvarnished streets of Manhattan – where she too seeks fulfillment of her desires. The unlit city streets are rife in noir and neo-noir thrillers as a site of moody introspection and danger, and yet, Christine navigates them as though they were her own. Traversing the red-light hub of 42nd street, through alleys and construction sites, a woman alone at night is a bewildering sight for the men she passes.\n\nShe does so with no hesitation or fear, using the streets to follow a Variety patron (Louie – Richard Davidson), investigate his criminal activities all the way to Asbury Park (New Jersey), and interweave these adventures into her own sensual fantasies. Just as Ince (2017, pp. 60-61) notes the dynamism of walking in Agnes Varda’s Cléo from 5 to 7 (1962), Gordon utilizes this simple act consistently to visualize Christine’s rebellion against spaces she is not expected to engage with or even desire to encounter.\n\nIn contrast, the domestic sphere of Christine’s apartment serves as a liminal space between the stasis of her job and the movement of her people-watching sessions. Her primary activities are sleeping and checking her answering machine, therefore, her only alone time and connections to those outside the purview of her obsessions.\n\nBy the film’s conclusion, all three locations will overlap as sites of Christine’s desire. She finally enters the actual theatrical space of Variety and sits among the male viewers in order to project her own carnal fantasies onto the screen (involving the aforementioned patron). She purchases lingerie, teases her hair, and dons a full face of make-up, recreating the pornographic excess through her own body, but in the privacy of her apartment – for herself. Lastly, she directly contacts the man she’s been following to expose her knowledge of his criminal activities and arrange to meet in-the-flesh on a city street corner that very night.\n\nIn the Cut also foregrounds rebellion and desire in the female protagonist’s bodily expressions. Twenty-years after Variety, New York City is still dark and seedy, even as the porno theaters and adult shops that once populated its streets are considered a relic of the past. Furthermore, a serial killer of women is loose in the big city of Campion’s film, leaving women nude and disarticulated but for a mysterious engagement ring on their hands. Like Gordon’s utilization of pornography and the adult theater to visualize Mulvey’s criticism, Campion concretizes the process through the actual dismemberment of the female body by a male force who lures them through a courtship fantasy (Lindop, 2015, 155).\n\nThe film reinforces this imagery with black-and-white fantasy sequences depicting the romance between Frannie’s father and mother, resulting in numerous surreal amputations and a decapitation. Despite the danger of a wanted murderer and predatory men generally, Frannie walks the streets of Manhattan, from her apartment and the college she teaches at to the graffitied subways and the strip club her sister lives above.\n\nEarly on, she is assaulted by a masked man on the street, but she files a report and returns to work the next day. Like Christine, Frannie rejects the inhibited modality of feminine movement (Young 1980), taking all spaces in stride with no hesitation for patriarchally-delineated spatiality or question of capability.\n\nMuch to the chagrin of co-writer Kathy Acker, Variety is absent of simulated sex scenes (Ferguson, 2017, p. 68), whether solo or between characters, however, In the Cut returns them in full force. The three explicit scenarios envelope female pleasure within the body. First, Frannie imagines Detective Malloy watching her as she masturbates, but his physical presence is unnecessary for her fulfillment. Second, Frannie verbally consents to sexual activity with Malloy (as long as he wears a condom), enthusiastically receives cunnilingus and his general prioritization of her pleasure, and then asserts that his prowess could only originate from a knowledgeable female (it does).\n\nCampion chooses to depict full-frontal male nudity but not female genitals. Considering Langford’s contentions surrounding greater sexual explicitness in neo-noir, this is significant. [Note: One of the most famous canonical scenes in neo-noir was the exposure of Sharon Stone’s vagina in Basic Instinct (Verhoeven, 1992)]. The final sexual encounter places Malloy in the passive position of being handcuffed while a hung-over Frannie dons a short dress and red heels (the pornographic excess echoed by Christine’s costuming). Frannie proceeds to sit atop him and pleasure herself with his appendage, independent of Malloy’s physical presence (though he urges her to “fuck [her]self”).\n\nDespite its titular adult theater and the film’s location during the feminist pornography debates, Variety features no onscreen nudity or sex acts, beyond those briefly shown in incoherent fragments within the theater itself. Instead, Gordon uses speech and language to articulate carnal desires and subverts noir’s paradigmatic relationship to voiceover and narration. Specifically, she relocates the typically detached, omniscient act of male-dominated voiceover back to the physical borders of the female body.\n\nChristine has three substantial monologues, each articulating a graphic, erotic scenario to the confusion, attraction, and finally, repulsion of her boyfriend. Her relationship to desire, prior to entering the theater, is not visual but is no less bodily, using descriptive and profane language to relate anticipation, communication, sensation, and pleasure. Furthermore, she finds interest in the unintelligible sounds echoing from the Variety screening room as well as a graphic message left on her answering machine, which describes the grooming of a woman’s genitals.\n\nSimilarly, Campion employs a different subversion to the masculinist voiceover. Frannie frequently draws inspiration from surreal appearances of poetry excerpts on the subway, but the narration is neither voiced aloud nor totally removed from the body. Instead, her voice is given an echoing effect as though it is located inside her body/mind. Even the narration of how her mother and father ‘fell in love’ works as insightful contradiction to the romanticized image of passive feminine-active masculine courtship.\n\nAs an English professor, she teaches to an uninterested class the merits of Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse (1927) despite it only having “one old lady die.” Woolf’s own works, Lighthouse included, preoccupies itself with “consciousness and selfhood,” a potential literary extension of phenomenological thought (Najafi, 2017) – one which the students, mostly male, maintain is without value.\n\nFurthermore, Frannie is consistently placed in scenarios wherein the female body is discussed disparagingly (Detective Rodriguez – Nick Damici) and the female voice dismissed (one-night stand/stalker John Graham – Kevin Bacon). In defiance of these impositions, she channels her rebellion through bodily response: Frannie leaves her date with Malloy rather than tolerate Rodriguez and remains firm against John even when he violates her home. By the film’s conclusion, she single-handedly kills the serial murderer with Malloy’s gun, walks bloodily all the way home, and returns to the still-pacified detective.\n\nKaplan et al. (1980) argues a fundamental component to the dangerous noir female is the absence of family, friends, or past, what Ince alludes to (and Luce Irigaray examines) as exclusion of “female genealogies” (2017, pp. 42-43). Christine’s only conversational encounters that attain a level of reciprocity are those she has with her friend Nan and the sex workers who frequent Nan’s bar, and to a lesser extent, her own mother.\n\nReminiscent of the consciousness-raising activism of second-wave feminism, Christine listens attentively to and inquires about the unnamed women and their forays into topless dancing, solicitation, and pornographic films. Like her interactions with the men at Variety, Christine refrains from moralizing, instead engaging with genuine curiosity. Furthermore, it is her exchanges with Nan in the women’s gym locker room that notify her of the open job at the theater.\n\nTo a greater degree, Frannie’s relationship with her half-sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is intimate through both speech and body. They share clothes, beds, fantasies, and fears, emphasized by lingering shots of their physical closeness and the dreamy (almost cozy) quality of their scenes. This affectionate camaraderie extends to the dancers who work in the strip club below. Unlike the women of classical noir, Frannie and Christine have mothers, sisters, and friends – pasts and presents built upon affirming “horizontal” and “vertical” genealogies that disrupt and subvert the “fixed meanings” (Ferguson, 1991) of women in the genre.\n\nIn conclusion, the application of feminist phenomenology to contemporary women’s cinema and genre study spotlights the undeterred work of female filmmakers in the multi-faceted construction and portrayal of female subjectivity. Evidenced by the close-textual analysis of Variety (Bette Gordon, 1983) and In the Cut (Jane Campion, 2003), this vital piece of feminist critical history is populated by women who walk where they are told not to, talk about what they are not supposed to, look where they should not, and maintain powerful feminine connections – they are rebels of desire.\n\nReference List\n\nFarrimond, K (2013). “Postfeminist Noir: Brutality and Retro Aesthetics in The Black Dahlia.” Film & History 43(2) [online].\n\nFerguson, K.E.

THE MAGIC OF THE HUMAN LANGUAGE WILL BE CONJURED THROUGHOUT!\n\nI love swearing. No, really. It is among my top five favorite things to do, up there with sleeping, eating, watching movies and YouTube, and hanging out with my brother. So let’s break this down to seven chapters, shall we?\n\n#1 When Did I Start Swearing?\n\nI went to a private school the first eight or nine years of my education, so swearing was strictly forbidden. It was a language for adults, but in the sixth grade, a young girl transferred in from public school. She swore. Me and my group of friends were in awe, so started the slow evolution of my love for swearing in the present. First we only mouthed the first letter, perhaps only said damn or crap the whole way through. Then we said the first letter aloud, and moved onto mouthing the whole word. By eighth grade, I was saying the words in their entirety, but weighed down with the fear I’d be caught AND the extreme Catholic guilt that I’d go to hell for it anyway. I’d repent and swear (ironically) that I would never do it again. But I did. My parents might curse in the car, but outside, it was more rare at that age.\n\nBy the time I left private for public, I’d taken to swearing as tools of speech in my arsenal of words. Don’t worry, there’s no difference between the two educational realms, kids can pick it up anywhere. Over time, you get to know all kinds of words and the near infinite combinations of them, classic or new, an old-dependable or your word-of-the-week. Crap, damn, goddamn, shit, fuck, bitch, ass, asshole, dick, dickhead, prick, douche, douchebag, cock, cocksucker, motherfucker, etc. Oh, aren’t they wondrous and dynamic.\n\nNow, that doesn’t mean I have no boundaries. Nine out of ten times, I don’t use the words at work, in front of my family, in professional correspondence, or even most comment sections. In this blog you’re reading, I tend to refrain as well if the piece is academic or critical, and when I do, I may asterisk the word. But on my own or among trusted friends, I can work up a real frenzy whether I’m talking about politics, religion, or my depression, the latest arthouse film, the DCEU, or The Sound of Music.\n\nThen there are sexual slurs, which is what I plan on discussing today. Obviously, a majority of this is my opinion and experiences, so please, take it or leave it.\n\n#2 When Did I First Hear the Word Cunt In Media?\n\nThe first time I heard the word cunt in a film was some time around 2009 when I rented the movie P2 from a Blockbuster (cause I’m old). P2 is a thriller horror film, a genre already overblown with either deeply problematic or interestingly innovative perceptions of gender politics. Long story short, there’s a beautiful young woman who gets trapped in her office building over Christmas break with a psycho-obsessive parking garage attendant.\n\nBy the film’s conclusion, she stabs him in the eye and handcuffs him to a car. As she is making her escape, he starts pleading then calls her a cunt. Turning around, she sets a gasoline trail ablaze resulting in him being burned alive. The scene is clearly framed as cathartic and as the last straw/ultimate act of evil, despite him already stalking, drugging, kidnapping, molesting, slut-shaming, almost drowning, and setting a rottweiler on her, but calling her a cunt is just too far.\n\nGenerally, in the history of film, cunt has been used as a catch-all word to trigger female rage, resulting in its stature as the dirtiest swear word in the American English language. Seeing as swearing of mostly any kind was self-censored and absent from mainstream American cinema until the early 1970s, the word cunt wasn’t actually heard on silver screens until 1971 when Jack Nicholson in Carnal Knowledge uttered these immortal words: “Is this an ultimatum? Answer me, you ball-busting, castrating, son of a cunt bitch! Is this an ultimatum or not?” The 1970s welcomed cunt to the supreme lexicon of shock tactics that dominated mainstream, independent, and exploitation films for decades.\n\nThis brings us two very important observations and conclusions . . .\n\n#3 SWEAR WORDS ARE GENDERED . . . assholes\n\nOk, by gendered, this is what I mean –\n\nTherefore, when you really start thinking about it, gendered implications are within and beneath almost all commonly-used swear words. For example, when you use dick, dickhead, douche, douchebag, prick, or asshole, those words commonly connote a male receiver or a descriptive type of cis male/masculinity/manhood. Obviously, the terms dick, dickhead, and prick revolve around phallic appendages generally ascribed to cisgender males, but even words associated with feminine (although not exclusively feminine) hygiene like douche and douchebag are rarely associated with female characteristics.\n\nIn contrast, bitch is associated with a particular type of female/femininity/womanhood. Henceforth, when it is received by a male, it connotes a feminine man, reflecting the attitude that bitches (also a term for female dogs) are inferior, subordinate, naturally subjugated, weak, small, annoying, and always attempting to castrate their manhood. But when a woman is referred to as say an “alpha” bitch, her personality may possess dominating masculine characteristics.\n\nExamples:\n\nCome on bro, stop being a little bitch!\n\nHe takes it like a bitch!\n\nHe can’t stop bitching and complaining!\n\nFrom these snippets, it’s pretty clear that swearing is gendered, and more often than not, the words are gendered at the expense of women. Rarely in American English do you hear the word cunt aimed at a male, a scenario more commonly found in British English or European media (rewatch Edgar Wright’s Cornetto Trilogy to see the obvious).\n\nFurthermore, how often do we rework phallic words for female use, making them “masculinized”? A woman cannot possibly summon strength from her womanhood, instead she can only be brave and bold by having “balls” and a “ladydick,” and a woman cannot be aroused on her own, she has a “ladyboner.” Although, this is likely an extension of framing women as “strong” in terms of male performativity. Lastly, while motherfucker is not often leveled at females, the word shit (and its suffixes) are fairly gender neutral.\n\nFrom these cases, another potential revelation reveals itself. When using phallocentric words against men, the slurs do not singularly reflect their manhood but rather a specific behavior or personality, henceforth, only when faced with a word gendered feminine like bitch is their status as men called into question. In contrast, bitch and cunt is often aimed at females (in American culture) just for their status as females, in order to reduce them to a single body part and degrade them as lesser than for having bodily or personality traits seemingly “inherent” to their gender. Just look at the gender exclusivity of the “resting bitch face.”\n\n#4 THE ACT OF SWEARING IS ALSO GENDERED . . . fuckers\n\nPeople, this should seem pretty obvious, but even the acting of swearing is pretty gendered.\n\nWhen men swear, it’s considered boy’s talk, just talking like men do and using aggressive manly words. When women swear, the act is considered vulgar and unladylike, a complete surprise use of masculine language coming from the mouth of delicate female creatures. This is especially evident when seeing reception to female comedians, who swear just as much or less than their male counterparts, but are still criticized as relying on vulgar language or in general, being less capable at comedy or comedic swearing.\n\nA comparable equivalent is the kind of humor which stems from hearing children swear. You’ve got Deadpool 2 (2018), IT (2017), Stranger Things (2016-present), Bad Words (2013), Role Models (2008), and going back to raunchy teen sex comedies of the 80s and 70s and classics like Bad New Bears (1976).\n\nOne of the major sources of both comedy and derision is the onscreen depiction of children swearing, as it is both considered surprising and hilarious but also more uncomfortably realistic (kids talking like how kids talk). See, isn’t it hilarious when Russell talks about “making someone his bitch” in prison, and isn’t it adorable when Eleven innocently says “bitchin’?” But isn’t it profane and controversial when Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass (2010) confidently says cunt? Basically, the act of swearing for women is roughly on par with how people respond to cursing children. Isn’t it cute how she’s using those bad words? Or, isn’t that woman so vulgar, unladylike, uncouth, coarse, and harsh for using such bad language?\n\nThis prejudice, I would suggest, even enters the perceived physicality of swearing. With those words, you are expressing or emoting often very visible feelings – rage, hilarity, sorrow – and thus, the act defies expectations of female passivity in the contortion of a woman’s face and predicted bodily pleasantries. Essentially, once a woman opens up her vocabulary to swear words, she is to be mocked, criticized, or scorned for betraying “normal” female and feminine sensibilities that preclude such adult, masculine, mature, strong and commanding language to originate from the mouths of babes.\n\n#5 DON’T CALL ME A BITCH, BITCH: When Words Are Reclaimed\n\nTo reclaim means to recover, retrieve, redeem, or reform some property from a prior state. Henceforth, even a word can be reclaimed. Let’s look at some examples, shall we?\n\nQueer generally means something odd or peculiar, but somewhere in between the 19th and early-20th centuries, the word began to connote sexual deviance and became a pejorative (a slur, basically). Although referring usually to homosexuality, the more accepted self-identifying language was invert, which eventually evolved in the mid-20th century to the language we know today to describe non-heteronormative identities, like gay. However, beginning in the 1980s and continuing today, the word has been reclaimed as an identity, connoting pride and rebellion, and is of course, part of the LGBTQ+ initials (and is capitalized).\n\nAnother example (although with greater ambiguity), is the term Chicano/a. The word’s origin is largely inconclusive, finding remnants in Mexicano as well as indigenous and colonial usages, but up until the 1960s and 1970s, possessed a clear negative ethnic and class connotation. Many still find the word an excluding and simplistic misnomer with connotations of ethnic and class discrimination. However, the Chicano movement of the 1960s, similar to the Black Power movements, strived for social justice, equality, and empowerment for Mexican-Americans, reclaiming the word Chicano, which is evidenced today in Chicano literature and history courses and Chicano Studies majors. For many, it is a word of great ethnic pride, historical importance, and a self-identifying label.\n\nSexual slurs present interesting cases as well. Take bitch. Is it still used as a pejorative against women or “non-masculine” men (as mentioned in Ch. #3)? Yes. But bitch is also a word reclaimed by many women as a symbol of power and distinction. How many female performers and musical artists use the word bitch to connote agency and power, from Alanis Morissette to Beyonce, Nicki, and Rihanna. How many anthems and self-help books teach you how to be a bad bitch, a boss bitch, a lucky bitch, etc. There’s even the acclaimed feminist publication, Bitch Magazine, which responds to pop culture with poignant critique. Now, bitch isn’t just a word used to degrade identifying females but as a signifier of power, agency, ambition, ferocity, sharpness, and at times, a justified righteous rage that has long been societally suppressed. Even the word pussy, used as a derogatory term for female genitalia or non-masculine behavior, has been partially reclaimed in a post-2016 election world, with the proliferation of the “pussyhat”-wearing resistance.\n\nFinally, this leads us to cunt. Has that unholiest of words been reclaimed? At large, no. But in some places, yes. If you’re a huge fan of RuPaul’s Drag Race, you realize the words cunt, cunty, and C.U.N.T. are not negative terms. They are often expressions of sentiment, respect, and validation. While it can still be used as an insult or offensive term, it also describes queens who are fierce and beautiful, and embody the C.U.N.T. credo (Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, & Talent). Furthermore, if you listen, see, or read Queer romance and erotica, the word cunt is used A LOT by women, to women, and for women. (Names) Basically, instead of:\n\nfocusing on male genitalia as heterosexual romances do (i.e. manhood, his throbbing member);\n\nportraying female sexual pleasure as some abstract, detached, ethereal thing (usually compared to some sort of flower);\n\nOr, only utilizing words that justify its existence in relation to male pleasure (i.e. sheath, slit, hole, etc.)\n\nQueer fiction goes right for it by snatching female sexual pleasure and power from the abstract, and reifying her with the word cunt.\n\n#6 FAR WORSE THAN I FEARED: When Is a Woman a Cunt?\n\nNow, real world application. When have I found it appropriate to call another woman a cunt?\n\nTo someone’s face? Essentially, never. When referring to a real person? Rarely, but these days, more and more. To fictional people? On exactly THREE occasions. We’re going to discuss ONE, and hopefully, we can extrapolate what a more personal definition for cunt might be. If we turn to basic dictionary definitions (Oxford English and Merriam-Webster), the term is considered “obscene” or “vulgar slang” for a female’s or woman’s genital organs or genitalia, usually used in a “disparaging or obscene” manner, and can refer to “an unpleasant or stupid person.”\n\nCase Study: Dolores Umbridge\n\nThat’s right, the notoriously evil Dolores Umbridge of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter universe was the first person I ever deemed a cunt. To the best of my understanding, here’s why:\n\nUmbridge’s actions have no clear motive, meaning she isn’t bound to racist totalitarian ideology like Voldemort, loyalty like a Death Eater, status and reputation like the Malfoys, or even forced political ignorance like Minister Fudge.\n\nUmbridge engages in sadistic cruelty for the sheer sense of personal satisfaction, especially against those she considers weak or inferior, such as those not endowed magically or any children/students under her authority.\n\nUmbridge uses the trappings of hyperfemininity – predominant pink fashion, a high-pitched and soft voice, delicate and dainty manner, always “pleasant” demeanor, occupies a “typically”-female role of teacher and headmistress – but only as a guise for her truly grotesque behavior and compulsions.\n\nTherefore, from this case study, it can be extrapolated that a cunt resides in the juxtaposition of perverse toxic femininity and radicalized sadism. Is there a double standard for these qualities in men? Absolutely. You can see it in society’s and media’s obsession with and portrayal of mothers who murder their children, a notion our culture finds unfathomable and abominable but yet also possesses that key juxtaposition. While this is only one of three persons I’ve felt this way about, the other two share many similarities.\n\nNow, let me make this clear. Men can most definitely be cunts, as evidenced in the word’s place in British culture, where it’s generally gender-neutral but often levied at men. Furthermore, a woman who does not possess hyperfemine trappings can also be a cunt, obviously, no need to limit ourselves. However, in each and every situation I’ve encountered whereby a fictional person evokes this word from my lips, as well as some real-life persons to be discussed below, the definition is eerily apt. What that says about me, our culture, the patriarchy, womanhood, etc., think what you will.\n\n#7 A (B)EE BY ANY OTHER NAME: Let’s Talk About Ivan(C)a\n\nHome stretch, folks.\n\nTwo events initially inspired this article: 1) my vitriol towards a female character in a Korean show I was watching (evidenced in the article’s title) which forced me to re-examine my use of the word cunt, and 2) the now-infamous scandal involving political commentator/comedienne Samantha Bee referring to first daughter Ivanka Trump as a “feckless cunt.” The latter was in the context of Ivanka’s seeming indifference and insensitivity to her father and his administration’s mass detention of immigrant children as well as her general unwillingness to coalesce her public beliefs on the rights of women and children with that of any public actions a close presidential advisor (which she claims to be) could take to speak out on the national crisis. The fallout resulted in severe media and political backlash and Twitter cries from the president to have her fired, but Bee was also staunchly defended by fellow comedians and commentators, although she eventually apologized through social media and on her show. Unless, you’re Sally Field.\n\nThis raises the question, why did this upset people so much? From the discussions and observations above, the obvious factors include 1) the word’s explicitly “evil” and taboo place in the pantheon of swear words, 2) its use by a female and a female comedian at that, and 3) its presence on a public platform. Other conditions of course include its aim at another public female figure, that being the daughter of the president of the United States a.k.a. the public female/feminine face of the administration since DAY 1. Therefore, how does Ivanka Trump, Samantha Bee, and this occurrence fit into our larger conversation on the word cunt? First, readers, we must ask ourselves, regardless of whether Bee should’ve said it, does Ivanka Trump deserve to be called a “feckless cunt”?\n\nWell, if we look at her actions and her character, the simple yet unwanted answer is – YES. Furthermore, if you examine Ivanka’s public persona, you’ll notice the overlap with the more personalized definition of cunt we developed above, and she also shares this with many of the female power-players within the Trump administration, from Kellyanne Conway (Counselor to the President) to Kirstjen Nielsen (Secretary of Homeland Security) to Betsy DeVos (Secretary of Education).\n\n[Note: I’m not including Sarah Huckabee Sanders as she received a very different kind of criticism that is at least in part due to her appearance, which does not align with the rest of the feminine aesthetic of the administration.] Nonetheless, commonalities include:\n\nAlign with prevalent conservative aesthetic as blonde, white women (evidence: just take a look at the Fox News lineup);\n\nLargely unqualified or unprepared for their job;\n\nRhetorical master of circular logic that allows them to say a lot without actually knowing the topic or contributing anything;\n\nEither have actual power but choose to enact terrifying policies (DeVos and Nielsen) or are superficial figureheads with vaguely understood jobs but often engage with the media (Conway and Ivanka);\n\nIMPORTANTLY, many of these women utilize an overt hyperfeminine “performance” – much like Dolores Umbridge – they wear skirts, dresses, and high heels, speak in soft, delicate voices, and proclaim themselves as independent working women, wives, and mothers in stark contrast to the hypocritical policies and behaviors they ignore or support. As Maya Rudolph illuminated, Ivanka channels the persona of the worst kind of Victoria’s Secret employee – artificially sexy, hyperfeminine, and arrogantly, ignorantly condescending.\n\nIvanka Trump has:\n\nUsed her position within the administration to enrich her own family’s coffers (Vanity Fair, Guardian, Time, CNBC),\n\nRan a clothing brand that employed sweatshops (Guardian),\n\nStood by her father against women who credibly accused him of being a sexual predator (CNN, Vox), and\n\nContinues to claim a role as an advisor to the president (Washington Post) yet holds no sway or refuses to condemn her father’s destructive policies that wholly contradict her calculated image.\n\nHowever, what extensively earns Ivanka’s status as a cunt is her adopted facade to masquerade as the feminine, “post-feminist” face of the administration (New Yorker), her supposed allegiance to women and children while espousing insensitive and ignorant propaganda that denies her own privilege and complicity.\n\nNow, is there part of me that feels sympathy for Ivanka, occasionally, yes. She can’t choose her family, and any research into her teen years, during her parent’s divorce and the continued oversexualization of her relationship with her father (strongly encouraged by Donald J. himself), does evoke sympathy. And she is no Dolores Umbridge, as she does not seem to be doing this out of sadistic cruelty. But she is equally hypocritical, self-serving, privileged, and far worse, her actions and inaction have real-life, Voldemort-level consequences. In a word, she’s a Trump . . . and a cunt. Meaning, as a woman, she truly can have it all.\n\nNote: Upon Googling, the internet actually has already made photographic and ideological comparisons between Umbridge and many powerful politically-minded women: J.K. Rowling herself, Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May, Hillary Clinton, Dianne Feinstein, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Kavanaugh prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, and Laura Bush, as well as the president himself.\n\nC U Next Tuesday: Conclusions?\n\nWhat I want to conclude from this article, as it’s winding down, is swear words are gendered and swearing is gendered. Words are malleable; words have consequences; words can be reclaimed and reconfigured in empowering and pejorative ways; and, that the word cunt is still very polarizing, divisive, and fracturous. Women don’t have a hive mind, they don’t vote, think, speak the same or agree on everything. For some it’s the word they never use, even in their own minds. For some it’s what they use only at their fiercest enemies, or what is levied against them by disempowered and abusive men (like the president actually). For others, it’s a term of respect and sentiment and validation. For some, its a sign that they’re breaking the rules, pushing the boundaries and upsetting the status quo. As Laurie Penny says,\n\n“There are no other truly empowering words for the female genitalia. […] Cunt, meanwhile, is a word for the whole thing, a wholesome word, an earthy, dank and lusty word with the merest hint of horny threat. Cunt. It’s fantastically difficult to pronounce without baring the teeth. […] For me, ‘cunt’ is, and will always be, a word of power, whether it denotes my own genitals or any obstreperous comrades in the vicinity.” (New Statesman)\n\nAND as a biracial queer woman, if I’m choosing, I’d much rather be called a CUNT, because for me, that must mean I’m doing something powerfully right.\n\nDear Reader:\n\nAfter examining how Argento’s Deep Red is both a definitive and defining film of the giallo, the final question is – how does the film, and its coded genre construct, express Italian modernity, specifically negotiating contemporary political and sexual anxieties? When the giallo was emerging in the late-1960s and 1970s, two key historic movements were occurring contemporaneously – second-wave feminism and a period of political and social unrest, known as the Years of Lead (Bondanella 454).\n\nAs mentioned previously, the film is set in Rome (although shot in Turin), employing a very statue-like and artificial composition in order to create a time and space of alienation. All the dwellings are designed accordingly, with straight, symmetrical lines and in a bare, streamlined, and hollow aesthetic. The setting is neither lush and middle-class, as associated with the Italian economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s, but nor is it entirely impoverished, as found in the imagery of Neorealism. Instead, the streets are empty and still, and the skewed angles and odd behavior of the characters aligns more accurately with the worlds of alienation created by Antonioni. Argento pairs this detached modernity with explicit and grisly violence, but downplays the exploitative sexuality.\n\nThe Years of Lead, named for the amount of bullets fired amidst the chaos, was a period characterized by political activism, terrorism, violence, and an increase in crime (particularly from the Mafia), exacerbated by deep generational conflicts (Bondanella 454-5). Specializing in cult film studies, Xavier Mendik, the Director of Graduate Studies at Birmingham City University’s School of Media in Birmingham, England, discusses the giallo in “‘the various associations, networks, tensions and articulations of Italian cinema’s textual and industrial specificity in the post-war period” (391). Furthermore, he argues for the consideration of the cycle of giallo in the 1970s in “terms of both psychic trauma as well as wider tensions in Italy during the 1960s and 1970s . . . [which] reflect Italy’s changing status within the wider European sphere” (392).\n\nAfter the state-sponsored violence of fascism and World War II (Olney 106), the highly-personal nature of the violence in the following decades provides an undercurrent to Argento’s portrayal of violence. Neither too fantastical nor precisely realistic, the violence is grounded in deaths that stem from very fairly plausible scenarios or the “weapons” of everyday life (e.g. cleaver knife, scalding water, stabbing, accidental dragging by truck, and the elevator “incident”). Argento’s cinematographic choices are unflinching, showing most of the murders’ puncta without cutting away, such as Helga’s impalement through glass shards, the folklorist Amanda’s brutal, scalding drowning, or Carlo’s head completely squashed by a truck. The violence is found in the everyday accident made into a nightmare.\n\nOn the top row, you have a juxtaposition of Mussolini’s fascism and the murder of Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro (1916-1978), who had been kidnapped by the the Red Brigades, a left-wing paramilitary group. You may also notice the pervasive politicization of the color red: blood, the Italian flag, radicalism, the emblem of the fascist party, etc. In the second and third rows, we have images from Deep Red, of the young murdering the old and the graphic, bloody death of a young German woman. While Italian Neorealism addressed the minutiae and evils of fascism through stark realism, and young directors like Bernardo Bertolucci and Pier Paolo Pasolini (a victim of political assassination himself) violently explored the consequences abstractly and psychoanalytically (Pasolini’s infamous Salò was also released in 1975), Argento and the giallo remained always in the background, the trauma lying far below the surface.\n\nFurthermore, the generational conflicts are interwoven subtly into the narrative. Most of the characters in Deep Red are in their late-twenties or early-thirties, engaging in flirtatious and overtly sexual behavior, wearing their hair long and clothes tight – a steep contrast to the appearances and more conservative behavior of older Italians as well as the younger postwar generation. More importantly, Argento exemplifies this generational rift in the disturbing relationship between Carlos, a closeted gay man with a cross-dressing lover and a serious case of coping via alcoholism, and his mother, Martha, immaculately dressed in conservative colors, face pancaked with makeup, and flitting between overprotective mother and distressed female.\n\nMartha, portrayed by Clara Calamai, an actress of immense popularity in Italy during the 1930s and 1940s, acted most notably in the “first” Neorealist film, Luchino Visconti’s Ossessione (an illegal adaptation of James M. Cain’s The Postman Always Rings Twice). At the time of Argento’s giallo, second-wave feminism and political activism had resulted in massive social and legal developments, including new laws shifting national consensus on marriage, divorce, adultery, abortion, and gender equality within such institutions and actions (Bondanella 454), signalling a major reevaluation of gender roles and performativity in the presumably Catholic, conservative country. The striking similarities between Calamai’s vamp Giovanna (and precursor to the femme fatale) and her turn as Martha, Carlo’s mother, evoke the undercurrent of sexual politics of the later film.\n\nIn Deep Red, Martha was once a famous, beautiful actress, evidenced by a prodigious amount of glamour shots she has strewn about her home, as well as the mournful nostalgia in her voice when expositing to Marcus. After she is revealed as the killer, Martha’s background is visualized: After marrying Carlo’s father and leaving her career, she enters domesticity, through which or as a result of, she exhibits signs of or develops a mental illness. In a rage, she murders her husband in front of Carlos with a knife.\n\nAlthough presumed male due the killer’s strength, hands (Argento’s), choice of female victims, fetishization of phallic objects, and social expectations, the ambiguity of the murderer’s gender displays the severe sexual disassociation of the character. According to Mendik, this gender disassociation “allow[s] women to be unveiled as the ultimate culprits,” and moreover, “with its emphasis on a female killer masquerading as a male,” Argento foregrounds “perverse female aggression as a key narrative trope” (390-3). In his book, Euro Horror: Classic European Horror Cinema in Contemporary American Culture (2013), film scholar Ian Olney also considers how placing the central male figure (Marcus) in the role of amateur sleuth actually puts him in the role “traditionally reserved in murder mysteries for the female victim,” that of a “passive witness to events that are beyond his understanding or control” (132).\n\nFurthermore, Deep Red also examines the perceived potential consequences of a “male” mother figure, and presents a constant thread through his work of “perverse female aggression.” Through Carlos, a troubled and alcoholic gay man, the film implies that his behavior is a psychological repercussion of seeing his mother murder his father with a phallic object as well as the domineering presence of his mother throughout his life. Like Psycho’s Norman Bates, he is effeminate, associates with cross-dressing (Ricci), and goes to great lengths to serve and protect his mother, whom he knows is a murderer.\n\nMendik cites the “perverse terrain of the giallo” as a psychoanalytic space to negotiate “past primal trauma[s],” specifically to “replay past sexual traumas,” which are a “trigger for present transgressions” (390, 3). In addition, Olney, referring to a similar idea proposed by Mendik, gender disassociation, argues that the “gender trouble” caused by placing the male amateur sleuth in the role of a female victim, makes the “detective somewhat less than a man,” but also makes the “killer something more than a woman” (134). The ideas of Mendik and Olney, when taken with the breadth of Argento’s work, conjures a recognizable pattern.\n\nIn all three of his Italian horror “Three Mothers” trilogy, two of his giallo “Animal” trilogy, and Deep Red, the killers are women, distinctly, women wronged by men (a sexual assailant, husband, father, patriarchal society) who are pursuing a revenge fantasy or hope to spread evil through their magical matriarchy. The female killers in question are all foiled and punished by the film’s conclusion; Martha, by the end of Deep Red, is decapitated by a pearl necklace, the ultimate symbol of middle-class, domestic, conservative femininity. While “explor[ing] wider sexual and social tensions within the national psyche” (Mendik 400), the sexual politics of Deep Red, particularly that of gender roles, expectations and performativity, conveys the social, cultural, and political unease that pervaded the era.\n\nIn conclusion, whether Argento is immersed in forces beyond this world, found only in “broken dreams,” or the evil forces that lie within a “broken mind,” he distinctively forges a work all his own, incorporating the generic essentials – through cinematography, paced editing, mise-en-scene, and motifs of myth and vision – with his own organic narrative and aesthetic concoctions, expressing the contemporary political, cultural, and sexual anxieties of Italian modernity.\n\nCheck back here next week for my next post, whatever the hell that may be.
