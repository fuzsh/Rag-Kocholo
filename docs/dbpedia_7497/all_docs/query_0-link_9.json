        "text": "15 This volume explores a range of approaches to the built environment of the ancient Mediterranean world, with two main aims: first, to relate archaeological evidence to the wider cultural and historical context, and second, to bridge the conventional divide between prehistoric and Classical archaeology. It contains 40 papers by an international array of scholars, ranging from the Neolithic to Late Antiquity, and geographically from the Aegean to Italy, North Africa, Egypt and the Black Sea. Major themes include: • the theory and methodology of analysing and interpreting built space • the relationship of the built environment to social and political structures and the formation of states • the development of civic and religious space • the identification of households in the archaeological record • the formation and interpretation of domestic assemblages • problems in the identification of functional areas within the house • changing conceptions of public and private • space and gender • the function and significance of decoration in houses and palaces • the uses of ethnoarchaeology and virtual reality for understanding architectural remains • the effects of acculturation in the domestic sphere • the archaeology of the domestic economy • the problems of combining literary and archaeological evidence. The papers offer many new interpretations of a wide range of material and, taken together, give an exciting overview of the latest scholarship and ideas in this rich and developing field of study.\n\nAs a study of the human past, the primary method of archaeology is the placement of its subjects in space and time. Since the subjects are material, the remains of the built environment are obviously central to this task. In its analytical and interpretive mode archaeology focuses on how humans in the past produced space through building. In this sense, space and time are not universal abstracts but rather, as E. Casey states, \"contained in places\". Archaeological places, then, are the remnants of these institutions and practices located in a fragmentary spatio-temporal grid. How archaeologists make sense of such a fragmentary past is a question of general hermeneutics. Preeminent to this is architecture, which, as Connerton observes, is an \"incorporating practice\", that is, one that defines and is defined by the movements and actions of humans'. The trick for archaeologists is to try to discover something about the practices incorporated within architecture. These are, of course the practices of its occupants and the interpretations of its passersby, which are relative, continuous, and multiple'. The task therefore is further constrained by the limitations of our ability to understand the many intentions of creators, users,and viewers of architecture over a span of time we can usually only guess at.\n\nThis dissertation examines the replacement of domestic architecture in the Peloponnese from Early Helladic III (ca. 2200-2000 BC) to the early Mycenaean period (ca. 1700-1400 BC). Based on Tringham’s “continuous house” model and subsequent scholarship, I argue that many of these houses were cyclically destroyed and rebuilt, and explore methods for investigating this phenomenon in context using cross-cultural comparanda. I suggest a wide-spread experience of the house as a physical manifestation of the cycles of the living household—the house is rebuilt on the occasion of the death of the household head. This phenomenon is particularly visible in the Argolid. Elsewhere in the Peloponnese, the replacement of the house is very often divorced from natural generational cycles and instead works to create a link with older abandoned architecture and presumably the lineages represented by these material remains. The destruction/rebuilding cycle—regardless of whether it marked real familial patterns or fictive claims of descent—was often (if inconsistently) marked by other ritual action, including feasting/termination rites. Occasionally these rites included the burial or caching of feasting debris or offerings with the destroyed house architecture itself, parallel to the common practice of intramural burial in these settlements, itself acting further to create and maintain “place” for a kinship group within the community. House rebuilding, however, functioned beyond place-creation in the renewal and definition of the household itself. It is in this way both continuous with the past and actively breaking from it in order to (re)create a new social group. This idea corresponds to previous assessments of the treatment of settlements especially at the end of the period. At this time, settlements were abandoned, transformed into cemeteries, or totally reorganized, and new settlements were founded. These changes are likely to represent efforts to create more cohesive regional communities, capable of more effective interaction with other communities within an increasingly “global” Mediterranean network. I argue that the mechanism for creating these new communities was derived in part from the understanding of built space and the house in particular as an identifier of and actual means of defining a social group."
