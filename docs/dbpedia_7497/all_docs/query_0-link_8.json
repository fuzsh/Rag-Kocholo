        "text": "This chapter’s approach is fundamentally epigraphical and its aims are twofold. First, it provides a selective overview of past and recent scholarship on the tablet from Selinous, together with an attempt at outlining a probable context for the inscribing of the tablet. But it will also be underlined how, despite some attractive suggestions, the tablet continues to present more enigmas than one can hope to resolve in the absence of further evidence. Second, the chapter will propose a working hypothesis for reading one of the texts on the tablet, further differentiating side A from side B. By paying new attention to the distinctive but neglected punctuation of the text on side A, one can propose a somewhat revised text of this ‘calendrical’ section of text. One can also glean insights from this reading to help elucidate the rituals, notably with a small series of hitherto ignored comparanda, which can help to develop a more precise, interpretative translation. The outcome will be to raise additional questions about the content and function of the ritual tablet as a bipartite whole and to propose a few general hypotheses about the characteristics of side A of the tablet in particular.\n\nThe aim of this study is to map and analyse the extant Latin defixiones, whose production within the Roman Empire is attested from the second to early fifth century CE. Extant are altogether about five hundred Latin curse texts, most of which are inscribed on lead tablets. These were intended to affect the actions or health of people/animals against their will with the help of supernatural powers. As such, they provide the epigraphical evidence of magical practices which were widespread throughout the whole Mediterranean of antiquity. They are often aimed at rivals, e.g. in circus or in love, opponents in lawsuits, or enemies, in general. Additionally, there is a special category of so-called prayers for justice, which are traditionally classified among defixiones and share several characteristics with them. They are predominantly used against thieves, and are meant to harm or eliminate the culprit. At the same time, their aim is to achieve justice: returning the stolen property, a “just” punishment, or revenge for the damage suffered. This study examines the occurrences, development and expansion of Latin cursing tradition in the various provinces of the Roman Empire; determines the specific geographical and cultural peculiarities of the texts; explores the expansion of the types of curses and cursing formulae; and observes the tendencies in their development, their mutual interaction and the adaptation of the Mediterranean magical tradition especially in the more remote areas. The work is based on a corpus of 309 Latin curse texts, most of which are translated and commented. The study is accompanied by an appendix, consisting of a corpus of these texts.

Its text was published several times which showed differences in certain sections. On one hand it was due to the poor legibility of the text. On the other hand the reason of the discrepancies is that only some of the researchers could examine the tablet personally, the rest of them applied photographs or previous editors' sketches which they interpreted in their own way. Because of the divergent readings, even establishing the correct text order of the outer and the inner side of the tablet has given rise to much controversy. Despite these problems, the text of this curse tablet has become a standing exemplar of vulgar Latin features on the course of the past 100 years, handbooks and publications on the Latin of imperial times refer its well-known \"mistakes\". For obvious reasons, a new autopsy could not be delayed any longer. This paper aims to present a revised and interpreted reading of the Latin curse tablet from Siscia based on a recent autopsy."
