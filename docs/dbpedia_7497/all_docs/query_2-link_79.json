        "text": "Deadly Inheritance (L'Assassino ha le mane pulite aka Omicidio per Vocazione, 1968)\n\nWIDE-SCREEN PICTURE\n\nENGLISH LANGUAGE\n\nDirected by Vittorio Sindoni, Italy\n\nIn the French countryside an old man is run over by a train. It turns out that he has left a large inheritance for his youngest son to be received when the boy turns 20. Before that can happen he too is suspiciously killed in a railway accident! Before you know it the remaining competitors for the dough begin getting bumped off! Will the police be able to stop the killer before the village is painted crimson? With Femi Benussi and Jeanette Len (Giovanna Lenzi). Looks really nice! The Double (La Controfigura, 1971)\n\nENGLISH LANGUAGE\n\nWIDE-SCREEN PICTURE\n\nDirected by Romolo Guerrieri, Italy\n\nFrank (Jean Sorel) is gunned down in a parking garage. As he lay dying he remembers back to the events that lead up to him being here... It seems Frank was on a beach vacation with his girlfriend Eva (\"Candy\" star Ewa Aulin) when things start to go wrong. First she seems to become interested in a beach traveler named Roger, and Frank, just not sure how interested she is, becomes jealous. Then Eva's hot looking mother Nora (Lucia Bosé who played Countess Bathory in Legend of Blood Castle!) happens to show up. Frank has one wild romp with Nora who then blows him off (figuratively speaking). But it's not enough for Frank so he follows Nora to her home in Rome. He continues trying to see her and one day spots her in town with the same guy they met on the beach! Eventually he goes over to Nora's place only to find the man murdered! Thinking that Nora is the killer, he gets rid of the body to protect her, but it turns out that Nora was out of town at the time of the killing and had nothing to do with it! A really decent giallo! Recommended! Due maschi per Alexa (\"Two Men For Alexa\" aka Fieras sin jaula aka Alexa Between Two Males, 1971)\n\nWIDE-SCREEN PICTURE\n\nIN ITALIAN LANGUAGE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES\n\nDirected by Juan Logar, Spain / Italy\n\nAlexa (Rosalba Neri) is having an affair.

A must for Rosalba Neri fans! Includes 2 extra adult insert shots as used in the German export version. The groovy score by Pierro Piccioni has been featured on several Italian pop soundtrack compilations. The House of the Yellow Carpet (1982)\n\nENGLISH LANGUAGE\n\nDirected by Carlo Lizzani, Italy\n\nUntypical Giallo set mostly in an apartment where a young couple live. After placing a classified ad to sell an antique Persian rug, an odd man shows up and attacks the woman while she is alone. In defending herself the strange man is killed! But before help arrives the body seems to vanish! Many twists and turns in this unpredictable thriller! With Béatrice Romand and Vittorio Mezzo as the couple and featuring prolific actress Milena Vukotic who's been in a zillion Italian movies by now (such including Fellini's \"Juliet of the Spirits\" and \"Andy Warhol's Dracula\"). The Hunchback of Soho (Der Bucklige von Soho, 1966)\n\nWIDE-SCREEN PICTURE\n\nMOSTLY ENGLISH LANGUAGE\n\nDirected by Alfred Vohrer, West Germany / Denmark\n\nLater entry in the West German Edgar Wallace \"Krimi\" movie series!

Includes the original theatrical trailer plus a few other Edgar Wallace movie trailers! Please note: The nice looking wide-screen picture was taken fom the uncut German version of the movie. As such, there were several bits of dialogue here and there that were never recorded in the English language. These bits here are presented with silence on the soundtrack with the exception of 1 short scene that is presented in German language with English subtitles.

The couple seems happy but there is something lacking in her life. Meanwhile a hooded homicidal rapist is attacking women in a mountain area. One day Gabriella is attacked in the woods. The hooded maniac takes her to a cabin and rapes her... and she likes it! Despite the guilt, she eventually decides to leave her husband. A hard-to-find thriller with Antonio Ferrandis, Antonio Mayans and Pedro Mari Sánchez.

Her boyfriend has disappeared and people around her begin getting murdered! An ok giallo with a few nude scenes from the lovely miss Hills. With Silvia Solar and Orchidea de Santis. Please note that there is a small unobtrusive tv logo in the corner of the picture. Looks very nice overall.

Living alone at his mansion save for his 2 servents, one day Marta (Marisa Mell), a beauftiful woman who looks a good bit like his wife, shows up on the run. After Marta confesses to having killed a man, Don goes with her to help hide the body. An obscure Giallo with a gothic horror feel and very hard to find!

It is not wide-screen and the picture is fairly soft looking but still watchable. If you'd prefer this version please let me know otherwise we'll send the Italian languuage version. Psychout For Murder (Salvare la faccia, 1969)\n\nITALIAN LANGUAGE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES\n\nDirected by \"Edward Ross\" (Rossano Brazzi with additional footage by Ted Neeland), Argentina / Italy\n\nLicia (Adrienne LaRussa, star of Lucio Fulci's \"Beatrice Cenci\"), the daughter of a rich politician, was sent to an insane asylum to avoid a political family scandal. Upon her return home, she sets about to get her revenge on her father and sister for putting her through the months of hell that may have now actually turned her into a legitimate psychopath! Sultry, gorgeous LaRussa steals the show as Licia, prick-teasing her sister's husband relentlessly and turning the tables on everyone. With director Brazzi as \"Daddy\", Paola Pitagora as her jealous sister and \"Camille 2000\" star Nino Castelnuovo as her blackmailing boyfriend! An offbeat and obscure thriller! Includes the alternate US opening sequence. Recommended! Scenes from a Murder (LAssassino... è al telefono, 1972)\n\nITALIAN LANGUAGE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES\n\nWIDE-SCREEN PICTURE\n\nDirected by Alberto De Martino, Italy\n\nAnother obscure one that gets little respect but I thought it was a helluva lot cooler than most recent U.S. thrillers! Telly Savalas is an assassin out to kill an actress with amnesia (Anne Heywood). Not knowing who or why anyones after her, she must try to regain her memory and put the pieces together in time to save her life. Also available in our old 4:3 English language version. The Secret of Seagull Island (L'Isola del gabbiano, 1980)\n\nENGLISH LANGUAGE WITH GREEK SUBTITLES\n\nDirected by Nestore Ungaro, Italy\n\nBarbara Carey plays a woman who, while on a trip to Rome, learns that her sister is one of several blind girls who has turned up murdered recently! Following a lead to an island where an unusual family lives, she pretends to be blind in order to track down the culprit. Despite a bit of nudity and blood, this one does play a bit like a t.v. movie, albeit a decent one that gets pretty intense at times! The Student Connection (Un Par de zapatos del '32, 1973)\n\nENGLISH LANGUAGE WITH GREEK SUBTITLES\n\nDirected by Rafael Romero Marchent, Spain / Italy\n\nRay Milland is Dr. Mann, a doctor / caretaker at a boarding school for young boys. We learn that he has hired an assassin to kill a man so he can be with his beautiful wife Sonja (reservedly played by Sylva Koscina). The plot goes overboard, however, when the assassin blows up an entire jet airplane killing over 100 people just to get to the one guy. Enraged upon hearing this, Dr. Mann picks up a statue and bashes the assassin's head in. He then notices one of the young boys spying on the incident but doesn't see which one. Sonja convinces Mann thatthey can only do one thing to save their skins: Find out which boy it was and kill him! A fast paced movie with a decent performance by Milland, the film still lacks any kind of real style (which these films usually need) and comes off just okay. Also starring Ramiro Oliveros, Franco Giacobini, Charly Bravo and María Silva. To Kill A Stranger (Matar a un extraño, 1983)\n\nENGLISH LANGUAGE WITH GREEK SUBTITLES\n\nDirected by Juan Lopez Moctezuma, Mexico\n\nI was surprised to find this one from the director of \"Alucarda\", \"Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon\" and \"Mary, Mary, Bloody Mary\" (all available in our \"Horror\" section) as years ago I had thought those were his only 3 films. Not so! This obscure murder thriller is his 4th and second-to-last film. A pretty pop singer (believably portrayed by popular Mexican film and t.v. star Angelica Maria in one of her only English roles) is traveling across a Latin country to meet her news reporter husband (Dean Stockwell). Her car brakes down during a storm and she has the unfortunate luck of being picked up by Donald Pleasance, a rich local retired army man / war hero. Seemingly helpful at first, he turns out to be a homicidal rapist and, while defending herself, she ends up killing him! In a panic she hides the body in a well but must now deal with the police and iron-fisted local army officers who are trying to discover the whereabouts of this missing \"hero\"! Although competently made, this is probably Moctezuma's most mainstream film mainly due to it's lack of grue and the gawdawful performance by Aldo Ray as a police detective. The rest of the cast is very good but it's Pleasance who steals the show (naturally!) and as such the film really only kicks in during his scenes. Look for Mad Magazine cartoonist Sergio Aragones as the controlling army general! Trhauma (aka Il mistero della casa maledetta aka Thrauma, 1980)\n\nITALIAN LANGUAGE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES\n\nDirected by Gianni Martucci, Italy\n\nAfter falling out of a tree on a childhood dare, a young man ends up both physically and severly mentally scared. His mind becomes so twisted that his only joys in life seem to be playing with plastic toy blocks and murdering! The movie is a mix of a slasher film and a giallo (though those hints are more than easy to figure out)! Although it's not as bloody as one would hope and the ending is a bit of a letdown it's not a total loss either. I would probably recommend this one based on rarity alone. The scariest moment? That shockingly bad disco number at the beginning!! ~Melissa Kusia\n\nStarring Gaetano Russo (as Ronald Russo), Domitilla Cavazza (as Dafne Price) and Roberto Posse."
