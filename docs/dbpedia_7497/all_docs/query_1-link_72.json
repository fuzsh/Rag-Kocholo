        "text": "→ A versatile hybrid\n\nIn 2020 we started off Gialloʼs original design as non-proportional monospace font, which step by step grew into a fully packed Roman type text version. Its features reach out to 16th century Italian old style serif fonts such as works by Robert Granjon (Gros Cicero et al.). Giallo® combines this calligraphic warmth with a digital vector look and a modern approach to the letter construction as well as proportions. The wide range of weights shape different characteristics especially when contrasting between Gialloʼs Light and Black extremes and make the typeface pretty handy for representative display purposes as well as a workhorse for text based applications. The high grade of details in the letters really shine when used in big sizes. During the design process and due to Gialloʼs vector shaped look, there has been constant exploration of how to break traditional type design methods and to create characters that would normally not be possible or thought of, when using traditional tools in regular ways to design or cut a typeface. At the same time going this direction, care was taken to preserve the appearance of its Roman type roots as much as possible to make Giallo® a versatile and functional hybrid typeface.\n\n→ 7 Weights + Obliques\n\nDue to Gialloʼs design approach also to be a functional variable font (incl. in our »Full Family Bundle«), especially in the digital field of static and moving image use cases, we designed a »Oblique« axis, which is rather atypical in comparison to other Roman type fonts. This comes in handy for steplessly interpolation to Gialloʼs original straight cuts. Unlike sans-serif fonts, however, the difference in line width allowed us a slight hybridization into the italic style. Especially with certain (lower case) characters that donʼt deviate too much from regular styles to italics. Reducing the character width also enables a higher contrast to the straight cuts. Both, Giallo® Roman and Giallo® Roman Oblique, can be seamlessly adjusted as variable font in their weights (100 — 700) and their direct connection via the oblique axis (000 — 100). Use the sliders down below to check that out.\n\n→ Why that italian name? Why's that font named »Yellow«?\n\nWe already named some of Gialloʼs stylistic influences above and if youʼre able to understand or even speak Italian or youʼre just a smartass, you might already guessed it, why we somehow might came up with that name. But what you might not have known is that the term »Giallo« also refers to a literature genre, coming up in the first half of last century in Italy, as well as a movie genre, which first appeared in the 60ʼs right after the so called »Neorealismo« (Italian neorealism). Giallo movies can be described as mystery and crime fictions which shifted more and more into the psychological thriller and horror genre. During itʼs heydays in the 70s and 80s directors like Mario Bava or Dario Argento did unique movies, which heavily influenced later American slashers (take this as advice: Thereʼs still a lot of trash [also fun to watch] during that period, but if you wanna dig some, check out movies from that specific era). Most Giallo movies can be seen as cheap amusement, but there are some masterpieces like »Suspiria« (1977), which oscillate between that simple entertainment and an artistic, scenographically fetishizing type of film work, still being worth watched today.\n\n→ 803 characters\n\nRight now the Latin Extended Character Set of Giallo® contains plenty of punctuations, symbols, arrows as well as special ligatures beside the regular ones. Four alternative stylistic sets are included. Set 01 provides a single-storey lowercase »a«, Set 02 a single-storey lowercase »g«, Set 03 an alternative »7« for all kind of numerals and Set 04 an alternative »®«. Check down below for a complete listing of all Open Type features, which have been so far implemented to Giallo®. We are currently working on monospace and italic extensions, which will be added as soon as possible. Future updates of Giallo Roman are of course for free, if you already purchased a license."
