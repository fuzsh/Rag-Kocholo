        "text": "This course will focus on the horror film, one of the most longstanding film forms, but one for which there is no clear scholarly consensus on how it should be defined as a genre. We will undertake an overview of the horror film, giving careful study to thirteen landmark examples. How do we want to define this genre? What are the form?s salient characteristics? What stylistic and formal techniques, what visual aesthetics, what themes, character types, sound design strategies, and conventions of narrative structure typify the horror film, and what are the affective aspects of the horror film experience? These are some of the questions we will be exploring. In addition to examining some canonical examples of American horror, this study will include a range of international works of horror, especially those representative of subgenres less familiar to American audiences. A particular focus of the course will be on the representation, character roles, and treatment of women within this popular film form. The horror genre is often understood as centralizing the victimization of female characters, so this course proceeds on the conviction that to think closely about representations of women is to gain a deeper understanding of horror films, both in terms of how they are put together and in terms of their possible social functions. We will screen films from across the globe studying instances of such subgenres as Giallo (Italian genre mixing slasher horror with detective mysteries) and Fantastique (French genre mixing gothic horror with fantasy erotica). The intention of this course is to deepen our understanding of horror cinema and to expose students to a cultural diversity of this vital film genre beyond the conventional Hollywood fare.\n\nUWW class; $75/term reg. fee + $525/credit. Refunds differ from Univ. day classes; see www.umass.edu/uww/resources/refund-policy.\n\nMonsters, slashers, and legions of the undead have terrorized audiences and haunted Hollywood's silver screen for a hundred years. This course will focus on the horror film, one of the most longstanding film forms, but one for which there is no clear scholarly consensus as to its definition. We will undertake an overview of the horror film in American cinema, focusing on the period from 1930-1999. We will give careful study to twelve landmark examples. How do we define this genre? What are the form's salient characteristics? What stylistic and formal techniques, what visual aesthetics, what themes, character types, sound design strategies, and conventions of narrative structure typify the American horror film, and what are the affective aspects of the horror film experience? These are some of the horror-related questions this course will explore.\n\nFor complete and up-to-date class details, meeting times, and textbook information, search for this class in Spire.\" Select the class term \"Winter 2024 \" and subject \"Film Studies \" and enter the class number \"90275 \".\n\nIf the class is not open for enrollment, you may need to specify other search criteria."
