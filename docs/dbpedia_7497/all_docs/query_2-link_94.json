        "text": "ROME — For a man who has spent nearly 50 years scaring the pants off movie audiences, the Italian director Dario Argento does not come across as frightening at all.\n\nSoft-spoken, even a bit reserved, Argento was anxious to wrap up a recent interview so that he could see his grandchildren — the offspring of his daughter, the actress Asia Argento — before traveling the next day to New York, where “Beware of Dario Argento: A 20-film Retrospective” is running at Lincoln Center through June 29.\n\n“I won’t see them for a while,” he said of the children, before shooing his interviewer out the door. Hardly the modus operandi of a “master of horror.”\n\nHis most recent film, “Dark Glasses,” which premiered in February at the Berlin International Film Festival and had its North American debut in the Lincoln Center retrospective, delivers classic Argento moments: throbbing music that usually bodes badly; gruesome, blood-oozing murders; nail-biting chases (this time involving a blind protagonist); and plenty of plot twists. Yet the film is also surprisingly tender: At its heart is a relationship between a woman and a young boy whose lives intertwine through tragedy.\n\n“The film is different from others that I’ve made,” and the finale even has room “for a little tear,” Argento said in the antiques-stuffed living room of his home in an upscale Rome neighborhood. A bulging bookcase along one wall was littered with some of the many awards he has won during his long career.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
