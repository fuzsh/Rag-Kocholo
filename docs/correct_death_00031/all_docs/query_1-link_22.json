        "text": "A Republican, Coolidge entered politics as a city councilman in Northampton, Massachusetts, in 1898. In 1909 he was elected mayor of Northampton. He served as a Massachusetts state senator from 1911 to 1915 and as lieutenant governor from 1915 to 1918.\n\nCoolidge was elected governor of Massachusetts in 1918. During a 1919 strike (refusal to work) by the Boston police, riots broke out. Coolidge sent the state guard to restore order. He became famous for saying that police officers did not have the right to strike.\n\nIn 1920 Coolidge became Harding’s vice presidential running mate. They won the election with 60 percent of the popular vote.\n\nWhen Harding died suddenly in 1923, Coolidge became president. The public soon learned that Harding had allowed government officials to make illegal business deals. Coolidge quickly punished people involved in the deals. He restored people’s faith in the presidency. In 1924 Coolidge easily won the presidential election.\n\nCoolidge encouraged the expansion of industry. He also led Congress to reduce taxes. The economy grew significantly.\n\nCoolidge generally avoided international affairs. One exception was the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, which Coolidge’s secretary of state helped to create. In the pact, 62 nations agreed to end war as a way of solving conflicts."
