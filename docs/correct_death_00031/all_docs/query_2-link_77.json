        "text": "Calvin Coolidge Reynolds, Sr. transitioned to be with our Lord on January 11, 2024, four years after his beloved wife Ora passed away; they were married for 66 years. Calvin is known lovingly to his children as Dad, Daddy, and Coolidge. His grandchildren and great-grandchildren called him grandad, grandaddy, and granddaddy Bill. Family and friends knew him as Unk and Pops. Calvin passed peacefully at the age of 95 in the home of his caring/ giving daughter Karen, who took wonderful care of him for five years. Calvin was born August 12, 1928, to Jim and Mary Lucille Reynolds in Prospect, Tennessee. Calvin was named after the 30th president of the United States, Calvin Coolidge. He was the 5th child of 15.\n\nAt a young age, he attended Giles County Public School and professed his love for Jesus Christ. Growing up, he was a prankster among his siblings. He was always getting them in trouble, being the class clown, and keeping the family laughing. Calvin was 14 years old when he hopped a train to Indianapolis, where he eventually met Ora Belle Brown, the love of his life, from that union, Karen Sue, Constance Elaine, Calvin Coolidge Jr, and Keith Eugene were born. Calvin was a hard worker throughout his career, always working two jobs at a time; he retired from Indianapolis Public Works at 62. Even after retirement, he never stopped working and providing for his family. Years after retirement, he would still work construction and janitorial services jobs. Calvin loved playing cards, listening to the blues, watching westerns, and spending time with his family.\n\nCalvin Coolidge enjoyed cooking, gardening, and making homemade wines. Calvin loved to dance and host family events at the family house on weekends and holidays. Calvin enjoyed returning to Tennessee and spending time at the family reunions year after year. In later years, he visited local food pantries, where he would feed all his friends and family and offer food to anyone in need. He never wanted anyone to be without food. He became one of the favorites. They would anticipate him coming and would have his items ready to go. When he stopped driving, the Pastor and church members would call and check on him to see if he needed anything. Calvin carried on his funny antics until his last breath. He was a Richard Pryor/Mike Epps all in one. Being around him was not in your best interest if you had thin skin. He was the type of guy you either loved him or you didn't. Thankfully, he was well-loved and respected by all. The 1974 James Brown classic sums up Calvin Coolidge Reynolds Sr.'s personality to a tee, \"Papa didn't take no mess.\"\n\nCalvin Coolidge Reynolds, Sr. is preceded in death by his parents, Jim and Mary Lucille Reynolds, alongside his siblings Myrtle Payne, Ruth Arnold, Sarah Harney, Mamie Cosby, Eva Gilbreath, John Reynolds, Herbert Reynolds, Paul Reynolds, Albert Reynolds (Catherine Reynolds) Joe Reynolds (Shirley Reynolds), Bobby Reynolds, son Keith Reynolds and grandson Jamar A Reynolds, Sr. He is survived by his children Jacqueline (Donell) Franklin Yvonne Brown; Clarence Nelson; Karen (Billy) Edmond; Connie (Terrance) Simmons; Calvin (Vanessa) Reynolds Jr.; He is survived by his siblings Edna Reynolds, Jimmie Lou Russel, and Walter Reynolds. He is survived by his grandchildren (11), great-grandchildren (24), great-great, grandchildren (15), cousins, nieces, nephews, family, and friends."
