        "text": "Calvin Coolidge Shafer Jr., age 64, of Kalamazoo passed away March 18, 2024. He was born October 8, 1959, in Kalamazoo to the late Calvin Coolidge Sr. and Joyce Renae (Burns) Shafer.\n\nCalvin worked with the Laborersâ€™ Union Local 355 for most of his career, with his most recent work being in nuclear power plants, which he loved. He had the heart of a child and an innate ability to engage in conversation with anyone he met and put a smile on their faces. Calvin enjoyed bingo, trips to the casino, and Words with Friends. He loved sitting outside to watch the squirrels and chipmunks in the back yard and made sure they were never low on peanuts.\n\nCalvin was preceded in death by his parents and siblings, Phyllis Narlock and Bill Shafer.\n\nHe is survived by his fiancee, Donna Roberts; son, Calvin Coolidge Shafer III; granddaughter, Ellowyn Shafer; sisters, Di and Mary Shafer; nephew, Darren (Kim) Shafer; niece, Ashley Hubbard; great-nieces and nephews, Kylie, Kaitlyn, Carson, and Brianna; and his beloved dogs, Rita and Piper.\n\nA memorial gathering will be held Saturday, April 6, 2024 from 3-5:00pm at Langeland Family Funeral Homes Burial and Cremation Services, 3926 S 9th St, Kalamazoo, MI 49009."
