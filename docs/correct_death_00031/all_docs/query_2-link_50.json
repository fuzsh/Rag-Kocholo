        "text": "By the President of the United States of America\n\nA Proclamation\n\nTo the People of the United States:\n\nIn the inscrutable wisdom of Divine Providence, Warren Gamaliel Harding, twenty-ninth President of the United States, has been taken from us. The nation has lost a wise and enlightened statesman and the American people a true friend and counsellor whose whole public life was inspired with the desire to promote the best interests of the United States and the welfare of all its citizens. His private life was marked by gentleness and brotherly sympathy, and by the charm of his personality he made friends of all who came in contact with him.\n\nIt is meet that the deep grief which fills the hearts of the American people should find fitting expression.\n\nNow, therefore, I, Calvin Coolidge, President of the United States of America, do appoint Friday next, August tenth, the day on which the body of the dead President will be laid in its last earthly resting place, as a day of mourning and prayer throughout the United States. I earnestly recommend the people to assemble on that day in their respective places of divine worship, there to bow down in submission to the will of Almighty God, and to pay out of full hearts the homage of love and reverence to the memory of the great and good President, whose death has so sorely smitten the nation.\n\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.\n\nDone at the City of Washington, the fourth day of August, in the year of our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three, and of the independence of the United States the one hundred and forty-eighth.\n\nCALVIN COOLIDGE"
