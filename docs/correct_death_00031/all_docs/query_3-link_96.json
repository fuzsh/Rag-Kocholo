John Calvin Coolidge, Jr. the thirtieth president was born on that day in 1872.[1]\n\nHe became president unexpectedly after the sudden death of President Warren G. Harding \"At 2:30 on the morning of 03 August 1923, while visiting in Vermont, Calvin Coolidge received word that he was President. By the light of a kerosene lamp, his father, who was a notary public, administered the oath of office as Coolidge placed his hand on the family Bible.\"[2]\n\nWith a nickname of \"Silent Cal,\" President Coolidge was known for being a man of few words, a very dry sense of humor, and personal integrity. By politics he was a Republican, by religion, a Congregationalist.[1] He was a fiscal conservative and believed in small government, beliefs which many Republicans still share. The administration preceding his was known for extravagance and scandal. During the first part of term, he was able to restore public confidence in the federal government.[3][4]\n\nOn 07 July 1924 a defining event of his life occurred. On that day his son Calvin aged 16, died of blood poisoning.\n\nPresident Coolidge was not the same after that loss. He seemed to be suffering from depression and refused to run for a second term. He passed away on 05 January 1933 in Northampton, Massachusetts and was buried in Plymouth Notch Cemetery, Plymouth, Windsor, Vermont. The cause of death was heart failure.[4]\n\nTime Line\n\n1870\n\nJohn Calvin Coolidge and Victoria Josephine Moor married.\n\n[5]\n\n04 July 1872\n\nJohn Calvin Coolidge Jr. born.[3][2][5]\n\n15 April 1875\n\nAbigail Grace Coolidge, sister of John Calvin born.[3]\n\n1877 - 1886\n\nEducated in local schools.[3]\n\n14 March 1885\n\nVictoria Moor Coolidge, mother of John Calvin, Jr. died of tuberculosis.[3][6][5]\n\n1886 - 1890\n\nEnrolled at the Black River Academy in Ludlow, Vermont.[6]\n\n1890\n\nAbigail Grace Coolidge, sister of John Calvin died.[3][6]\n\n1891 - 1895\n\nAttended Amherst College and graduated with honors.[3][2][4][1][6]\n\n1897\n\nAdmitted to the bar, started practicing law in Northampton, Massachusetts and became active in local politics.[2][3][6]\n\n04 October 1905\n\nMarried Grace Anna Goodhue.[3][4][5]\n\n1906\n\nFirst son, John Coolidge born.[3][1]\n\n1907\n\nAfter his election in November, 1906, Coolidge serves as representative to the Massachusetts Legislature.[3][6]\n\n1908\n\nSecond son, Calvin Coolidge born.[3][1]\n\n1910 - 1911\n\nCoolidge is mayor of Northampton, Massachusetts.[3][2]\n\n1912 - 1915\n\nServes several terms as state senator, and as president of the Massachusetts senate 1913-1915.[3]\n\n1916 - 1918\n\nCoolidge is elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts and serves three terms.[3][6]\n\n06 April 1917\n\nUnited States enters World War I.[7]\n\n05 November 1918\n\nCalvin Coolidge is elected Governor of Massachusetts.[3][1][6]\n\n11 November 1918\n\nEnd of fighting in World War I.[8]\n\n1919\n\nPolice in Boston, Massachusetts attempt to unionize and strike, resulting in rioting and disorder. Coolidge called up the state guard.[3] \"Governor Coolidge comes to national attention because of his stand for law and order. In a telegram to Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor, Coolidge declares: 'There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, anytime.'\"[1]\n\n1920\n\nNominated and elected Vice President of the United States.[3][4][6]\n\nJanuary, 1920 - 02 August 1923\n\nCalvin Coolidge served as Vice President of the United States until the death of President Harding on August 2.[3]\n\n03 August 1923\n\nAfter President Warren Harding had died unexpectedly. Vice President Coolidge was sworn in as President by his father, as soon as the news reached him on August 3, 1923.[3][2]\n\nDecember, 1923\n\nPresident Coolidge's ...\" first message to Congress ... called for isolation in foreign policy, and for tax cuts, economy, and limited aid to farmers.\"[2]\n\n22 February 1924\n\n\"Calvin Coolidge became the first president to make a public radio address to the American people.\".[3]\n\n07 July 1924\n\n\"The President's youngest son, Calvin, dies tragically from blood poisoning. His remaining son, John, wrote that his father never fully overcame his grief for his younger son.\".[9]\n\n1924\n\nCalvin Coolidge was nominated at the Republican National Convention as the candidate for president, and was elected. His campaign slogan was “Keep Cool with Coolidge”.[3][10]\n\n18 March 1926\n\nThe President's father, John Calvin Coolidge, Sr. died.[5]\n\n02 August 1927\n\nPresident Coolidge announces that he is not going to run for another term as president.[3][4]\n\n1928\n\nPresident Coolidge issues the first Child Health Day Proclamation.[11]\n\n1929\n\nThe Coolidges move back to Northampton. He writes his autobiography, The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge.[1]\n\n29 October 1929\n\nThe stock market crashes, now known as the official start to the Great Depression that would last for 10 years. Possibly Coolidge was able to foresee this event and factored it into his decision not to run for president again. His wife implied it was true.[12]\n\n05 January 1933\n\nFormer President John Calvin Coolidge Jr. died of a coronary thrombosis (heart attack).[3][13]\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 President Coolidge biography at the Miller Center\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 Biography at White House.gov\n\n↑ 3.00 3.01 3.02 3.03 3.04 3.05 3.06 3.07 3.08 3.09 3.10 3.11 3.12 3.13 3.14 3.15 3.16 3.17 3.18 3.19 3.20 3.21 3.22 3.23 Wikipedia\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 Find A Grave: Memorial #6551998\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 Roberts, Gary Boyd, comp., Ancestors of American Presidents, Boston: New England Historic Genealogical Society (2009), 431-432, 435-436, 441, 445, 450, 462, 465-466, 469, 473, 478, 486, 494-501, 581\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5 6.6 6.7 6.8 http://americanhistory.about.com/od/calvincoolidge/p/pcoolidge.htm\n\n↑ Wikipedia-WWI\n\n↑ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_World_War_I Wikipedia-WWI\n\n↑ http://histclo.com/pres/Ind20/coolidge.html\n\n↑ http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/136173/Calvin-Coolidge/302332/Presidency\n\n↑ http://pediatrics.about.com/b/2012/10/01/child-health-day-2012.htm\n\n↑ Smith, Richard Norton.
