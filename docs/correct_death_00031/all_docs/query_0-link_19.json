        "text": "It was been over 80 years since Calvin Coolidge, 30th President of the United States, died at his home, \"The Beeches\", in Northampton, Massachusetts. While 80 years is a long time, it seems like Calvin Coolidge was of a time much further away from us than 80 years ago. That's because even in his time, Calvin Coolidge was a throwback -- a quiet country lawyer who spoke little and did less; a politician who believed that there was progress in inaction; a President whose famous quotes included:\n\n•\"Perhaps one of the most important accomplishments of my Administration has been minding my own business.\" •\"Four-fifths of all our troubles would disappear if we would only sit down and keep still.\" •\"If you don't say anything, you won't be called on to repeat it.\" •\"In the discharge of the duties of this office, there is one rule of action more important than all others. It consists in never doing anything that someone else can do for you.\"\n\nEven today, Coolidge is fondly remembered. Conservatives appreciate Coolidge's adherence to Jeffersonian principles about a government which \"governs least, governs best\", aims for lower taxes, encourages business, and limits the size of the federal government. Ronald Reagan idolized Coolidge, hung Coolidge's portrait in the Cabinet Room after he moved into the White House, and invoked one of Coolidge's most famous quotes when he fired striking air traffic controllers in 1981, repeating Coolidge's 1919 words to striking Boston police officers, \"There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.\" At another time, Reagan said, \"You hear a lot of jokes about 'Silent Cal Coolidge.' The joke is on the people who make the jokes. Look at his record. He cut the taxes four times. We had probably the greatest growth and prosperity that we've ever known. I have taken heed of that because if he did that by doing nothing, maybe that's the answer.\" Others enjoy Coolidge's famous taciturnity, laconic humor, and eccentric manner.\n\nCalvin Coolidge assumed the Presidency when President Warren G. Harding suddenly died in office in August 1923, was elected in his own right in 1924, and left office on his own terms in 1929 after giving reporters a characteristically terse statement the previous year which declared, \"I do not choose to run for President in 1928\" -- with no further explanation. After Herbert Hoover replaced him, Coolidge returned home to Massachusetts where he wrote his autobiography, magazine and newspaper articles, and served on several corporate boards of directors to earn some money, and working in his small law office in Northampton.\n\nCoolidge was a relatively young man upon leaving office, just 56 years old when he left the White House. Despite his famous tendency to not do much (and sleep often), however, the Presidency took quite a toll on Coolidge and he was never the same after his 16-year-old son tragically died from an infection which developed from a blister that he received while playing tennis at the White House. It was just a year into his Presidency when Coolidge's son died and the President was devastated, later saying that \"When he went, the power and the glory of the Presidency went with him.\" In retirement, the former President often complained of severe indigestion -- self-treated with soda water -- and just days before his death, Coolidge told a group of friends, \"I am too old for my years...I suppose the carrying of the responsibilities, as I have done, takes its toll. I'm afraid I'm all burned out, but I am comfortable.\"\n\nOn January 5, 1933, Coolidge spent the morning answering mail at his small office on the Main Street in quaint Northampton, Massachusetts, but another uncomfortable attack of indigestion led him to leave the office at about 10:00 AM, telling his secretary, \"Well, I guess we'll go up to the house.\" As he returned home to \"The Beeches\", his beautiful 16-room home in woods overlooking the Connecticut River, his beloved wife, Grace, was heading out to do some shopping. Coolidge asked if Grace wanted to use the car to go into town, but Grace wanted to take advantage of a rare day of pleasant weather during the New England winter and decided to walk.\n\nThe former President talked for a bit with his secretary, Harry Ross, and worked quietly for a time on a jigsaw puzzle of one of his predecessors, George Washington. At about noon, Ross left while Coolidge headed upstairs to shave and perhaps take a nap before lunch, or \"supper\" as the son of a Vermont farmer called his midday meal.\n\nIt was about an hour later -- approximately 1:00 PM -- when Grace Coolidge returned home and called her husband's name to summon him for lunch. When Coolidge didn't respond, she walked upstairs to his dressing room and found the 30th President of the United States. Sprawled on his back on the floor in his shirtsleeves, Coolidge had been dead for fifteen minutes, the apparent victim of a massive coronary thrombosis which had killed the 60-year-old former President instantly.\n\nWhen she learned of quiet, reserved \"Silent Cal's\" death, the writer Dorothy Parker sardonically asked, \"How can they tell?\". President Hoover was kinder, paying tribute from the White House, \"Any summation of Mr. Coolidge's services to the country must conclude that America is a better place for his living in it.\" Most regular Americans also mourned Coolidge's death, fondly remembering his Presidency as a simple, prosperous time in comparison to the Great Depression which they were now mired in.\n\nAs mourners streamed into Northampton for Coolidge's funeral, the Mayor of Coolidge's adopted hometown briefly considered asking the town's businesses to close their doors in Coolidge's honor before recalling the former President's declaration that \"The chief business of America is business.\" Honoring Coolidge's belief, the Mayor said, \"I'm not going to ask them to close because I don't think Calvin Coolidge would want that. He knew what they've been through. Every nickel counts with them. He wouldn't want them to lose a sale.\"\n\nAn simple bronze casket held the thin body of the 30th President, his face visible with the casket lid open as Northampton residents and powerful leaders from Washington filled the pews at Edwards Congregational Church just down Main Street from Coolidge's unassuming law office. Governors, Senators, friends, and neighbors sat in close proximity to Eleanor Roosevelt, Vice President Charles Curtis, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, and Coolidge's successor, President Herbert Hoover.\n\nTrue to Coolidge's life, the funeral service was short and simple. Presidential send-offs have always been grand, both then and now, but Coolidge's funeral -- even with the dignitaries in attendance and the outpouring of grief from the nation due to the former President's sudden and unexpected passing -- lasted 22 minutes. To Russell Owen of the New York Times, the simplicity of Coolidge's funeral was in stark contrast to the mesmerizing emotion of the current President, Herbert Hoover -- who served as Coolidge's Secretary of Commerce and was less than two weeks away from relinquishing the White House to Franklin D. Roosevelt:\n\n“The organ whispered soft throbbing notes which merely touched the silence of the church. The air was heavy with the scent of flowers. Dim light from the bulbs overhead played over the coffin. After that first glance the President did not look at it, but gazed down, his eyes closed. His whole figure seemed to droop a little in the emotional intensity of that meeting. How long he stood he probably did not know, but it seemed as if he were lost in his thoughts and possibly his prayers. People looked at him curiously, with sympathy and the shy consciousness which is evident in those contemplating another’s unhappiness. These emotions were reflected in their glances and the quick shifting of their bodies as the moments dragged. And then the President relaxed and sat down, turning his head for a moment to his wife. Not until well through the service did he again look toward the coffin, his eyes being apparently directed below it, and his head slightly bowed. Once Mrs. Hoover whispered to him, and he moved. Then he again resumed his slightly bowed position. Indeed, his head drooped so low as the moments passed that he did not need to move at the prayer.”\n\nAfter the short funeral service, another quiet and restrained ceremony took place 100 miles north of Northampton, in the small town Calvin Coolidge was born, Plymouth, Vermont. In a driving rainstorm with hail bouncing off of black umbrellas, the 30th President of the United States was committed to the soil that he knew so well. The burial service took only five minutes.\n\nCharacteristically, there is little that differentiates Calvin Coolidge's white headstone from the six generations of his family buried nearby. Like everyone else, Coolidge's name, date of birth, and date of death is all that is written on his headstone, but one might notice a subtle difference -- instead of an engraving of a wreath, Calvin Coolidge's grave features a small Presidential seal. It's barely noticeable, but it's not difficult to imagine that as the most reticent of Presidents, Calvin Coolidge would find it too demonstrative for his tastes."
