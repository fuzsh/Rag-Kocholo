He went on to be a Massachusetts state senator, lieutenant governor, and governor before becoming vice president and president from Aug. 1923 to March 1929.\n\nThe Vermont native attended Amherst College from 1891 to 1895. A few years later, Coolidge met his wife, Grace Anna Goodhue, who was a teacher at the Clarke School for the Deaf. They attended the same congregational church and reportedly met at a picnicking and boating function.\n\nAfter retiring from the U.S. presidency in 1929, Coolidge moved back to Northampton."
