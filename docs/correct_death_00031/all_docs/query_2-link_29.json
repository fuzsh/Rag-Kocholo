        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1872–1933). The sixth vice president to become president of the United States at the death of the chief executive was Calvin Coolidge. He took the oath of office as the 30th president at 2:47 am, on August 3, 1923, a few hours after President Warren G. Harding died.\n\nElected to a second term in 1924, Coolidge was a popular president. A Republican, he served in a time of speedy industrial and business growth, high profits, and rising stock market prices, called the period of “Coolidge prosperity.” In this day of quick riches and free spending Coolidge stood for the sound Yankee virtues of economy, caution, and self-respect.\n\nA Typical New England Childhood\n\nCalvin Coolidge was born on July 4, 1872, in Plymouth, Vermont, the son of John Calvin Coolidge and Victoria Moor Coolidge. He was named John Calvin for his father but dropped the John when he was graduated from college. His father was a farmer, storekeeper, and occasional political officeholder. As Calvin grew up he learned to do farm chores. He helped to fill the woodbox, drive the cattle to pasture, drop seed potatoes at planting time, and drive the horse-drawn mowing machine and rake at harvest. For winter fun there were coasting, skating, and hayrides. In summer he enjoyed fishing, swimming, and riding. His boyhood was saddened by the illness of his mother and her death when he was 12 years old.\n\nThe boy learned his politics along with other lessons from his father. During the Garfield-Hancock campaign of 1880, Calvin asked his father for a penny to buy candy. John Coolidge refused, explaining that if the Democrats should be elected hard times could be expected. After James A. Garfield won, the lad reminded his father that the Republicans had stayed in power. He got the penny.\n\nEducation, Career, and Marriage\n\nCoolidge attended Black River Academy in Ludlow, Vermont, before he entered Amherst College in Massachusetts. He was graduated cum laude from Amherst in 1895. He learned law in the old-fashioned way, studying in a law firm at Northampton, Massachusetts. He took his first steps in politics in these years by doing hard work on ward and city committees.\n\nCoolidge was the opposite of the popular picture of the back-slapping politician. He was quiet, sincere, and rather shy; but he was able to attract and hold the confidence of voters and political leaders alike. He was elected and reelected to one office after another. He served as state representative, mayor of Northampton, state senator and president of the state Senate, lieutenant governor, and governor of Massachusetts. Always he stood for economy, conservatism, and party regularity.\n\nIn 1905 Coolidge married Grace Anna Goodhue of Burlington, Vermont. They had two sons, John and Calvin.\n\nFrom Governor to President\n\nGovernor Coolidge came into nationwide prominence during the police strike in Boston in 1919. He let the mayor handle the problem until the police left their posts and disorders arose. Then he summoned the state guard to keep order. To a protest by a labor leader he replied: “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.” At the Republican Convention the next year he was nominated for the vice presidency on the first ballot.\n\nAs vice president, Coolidge was modest and silent. He presided over the Senate and sat in Cabinet meetings at President Warren G. Harding’s invitation. Harding’s death brought Coolidge into the presidency at a critical time. Scandals in the Harding administration were becoming public. Enormous graft in the Veterans’ Bureau and the Alien Property Custodian’s office had been revealed. The Senate opened an investigation of private leases on naval oil reserves at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, and Elk Hills, California. They had been granted by Albert B. Fall, Harding’s secretary of the interior. Following a resolution by Congress, Coolidge appointed lawyers to prosecute those involved in the oil scandal. Fall was convicted and imprisoned. Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby and Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty resigned under pressure.\n\nCoolidge was nominated for a second term in 1924, with Charles G. Dawes of Illinois as the vice presidential nominee. The Democrats nominated John W. Davis of West Virginia for the presidency and Governor Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska for the vice presidency. Insurgent Republicans put a Progressive Party ticket into the field, headed by Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin and Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana. Coolidge and Dawes won. They received 382 electoral votes to 136 for Davis and only 13 for La Follette.\n\nCoolidge Family in the White House\n\nIn the White House the Coolidges entertained frequently in a dignified and formal fashion. They had as house guests many of the nation’s leaders. They attended the Congregational church. Their two sons, who were attending Mercersburg Academy, spent school vacations at the White House.\n\nCoolidge was devoted to his sons and took pride in giving them a proper New England upbringing. Calvin, Jr., had a summer job working in a tobacco field when his father became president. A fellow worker commented that he would not be working if his father were president. Calvin, Jr., replied: “If my father were your father you would.” The youth died in July 1924 as a result of a foot infection.\n\nLegislative Program\n\nIn his messages to Congress Coolidge called for tax reduction, immigration restriction, extension of the civil service, reorganization of government departments, river improvements, and adherence to the World Court. Congress was frequently uncooperative. A farm-bloc minority of progressive Republicans held the balance of power. Coolidge vetoed their McNary-Haugen bill, which was designed to support farm prices by government subsidies. He also vetoed a bill for a bonus, in the form of insurance, for World War I veterans. Congress passed this bill over his veto.\n\nCoolidge and Andrew Mellon, secretary of the treasury, won the passage of economy measures. They reduced the national debt by about a billion dollars a year and cut taxes in all income brackets.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nThe administration’s chief international triumph dealt with the Kellogg-Briand multilateral treaty. Frank B. Kellogg, secretary of state, threw American influence behind the move to renounce war as an instrument of international policy. Representatives of 15 nations signed the Pact of Paris in Paris on August 27, 1928. Other nations signed later. Coolidge backed a naval limitation conference in Geneva in 1927, but it reached no agreement. The Senate voted to join the World Court in 1926. It added so many reservations, however, that the resolution was not accepted by the other members.\n\nCertain frictions with other countries arose. The immigration bill of 1924 caused ill feeling by including the Japanese with other Asian aliens whose entry was barred because they were ineligible for citizenship. Trouble with Mexico over oil and land laws was a threat to the property of Americans. The appointment of Dwight W. Morrow as ambassador to Mexico helped to restore harmony. Coolidge was criticized when U.S. Marines were killed and wounded after he sent them to Nicaragua to protect American interests during an uprising.\n\nCoolidge Prosperity\n\nBusiness rather than politics made the big news of the era. Industry was flourishing. Big business became bigger through both growth and consolidation. The 1920s saw 7,000 mergers in industry and mining and the same trend in utilities, merchandising, and banking. Advertising reached a new peak, helping to move the huge quantities of merchandise turned out by the factories. Chain stores, mail-order houses, and installment buying were expanding features of retail trade. Nearly every town had its real-estate boom.\n\nThe stock market rocketed upward, attracting investors and margin buyers from all ranks of society. Corporations found it easy to issue new securities. Credit was overexpanded. Cheap money flowed into foreign bond issues and a variety of domestic projects, including 4 million dollars’ worth of brokers’ loans. When conservative bankers and economists were concerned over the extent of these loans, Coolidge stated that their increase showed a natural expansion of business. He had great faith in the continued march of prosperity.\n\nThe so-called Coolidge prosperity did not reach everyone. Farmers continued to suffer from falling prices and the decline in foreign purchase of their products. Farm mortgage foreclosures increased.\n\nThe labor picture was uneven. Jobholders enjoyed a rising standard of living and a shorter work week. Some large firms offered workers such services as low-cost cafeterias, free medical care, profit-sharing plans, and vacations with pay. The number of unemployed, however, fluctuated between 1 1/2 and 2 million. Unions lost ground in numbers and influence.\n\nCoolidge’s popularity remained unshaken, but in 1927 he issued a historical statement: “I do not choose to run for president in 1928.” In March 1929 he was succeeded by Herbert Hoover and retired to Northampton where he wrote his autobiography and magazine and newspaper articles. He died suddenly on January 5, 1933, and was buried in Plymouth beside his son and father. His Autobiography included little personal reporting, thus perpetuating the image of the president who did not talk.\n\nAdditional Reading\n\nAllen, F.L.
