        "text": "30th President\n\nTerms: 1923-1929\n\nPolitical Party: Republican\n\nFirst Lady: Grace Anna Goodhue Coolidge\n\nVice President: None, Charles Gates Dawes\n\nOverview\n\nBorn: July 4, 1872 in Plymouth Notch, Vermont... His 1923 State of the Union address to Congress was the first ever to be broadcast via radio. He would continue to use the medium effectively, giving at least one radio address per month. As conservative with his words as he was with his politics, \"Silent Cal\" was the archetypal stern New Englander. Believing firmly that \"the business of America is business,\" Coolidge espoused a policy of keeping the government out of the way of big business and generally appeared to embrace the status quo... Died: January 5, 1933.\n\nThe Era\n\n1923: George Gershwin composes Rhapsody in Blue\n\n1923: Bessie Smith records her first jazz album\n\n1924: Soviet Union founder Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, dies\n\n1925: The Scops \"monkey\" trial takes place in Tennessee\n\n1927: Charles Lindbergh flies to Paris\n\n1928: Chiang Kai-shek becomes leader of China\n\nDomestic Policy\n\n\"Silent Cal\" did not feel it was his place to pressure Congress into passing legislation. He was generally content to ride the wave of relative post-war prosperity. Coolidge was a plain-speaking New Englander and a welcome relief from the scandal-ridden Harding administration. He cut taxes in order to put more money into the hands of consumers and investors. His secretary of commerce, Herbert Hover, forged a \"new era\" alliance between government and big business. Some said Coolidge's laissez-faire approach to financial markets encouraged the over-speculation that resulted in the stock market crash of 1929. Coolidge believed the nation needed fewer, not more, programs regardless of their purpose.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nCalvin Coolidge was not a forceful leader in matters of foreign affairs and often deferred to his secretary of state. His administration did, however, seek to improve the strained relations that existed between the United States and Mexico. It also tried to establish a dialogue with the emerging nations of Latin America. The Coolidge administration opposed the U.S. entry into the League of Nations. It did support the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, which naively outlawed war between nations."
