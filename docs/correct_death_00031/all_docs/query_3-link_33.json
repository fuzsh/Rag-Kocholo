The Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation and the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development State Historic Sites are cohosting a reenactment for the 100th anniversary of the event.\n\nThere will be a second reenactment later in the day at 2:47 pm. and a reenactment of President Warren Harding's memorial service and eulogy two days later on Aug. 5.\n\nWhat are the events at the Calvin Coolidge Homestead for the 100th anniversary\n\nAlthough nothing else will occur at 2:47 am on Aug. 3, a detailed itinerary of other events in the days leading up to and following the reenactment can be found on the Coolidge Foundation's website. Some highlights include:\n\nTours of the Coolidge Homestead and the surrounding buildings and grounds (10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily)\n\nA 100th Anniversary Gala (6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 2)\n\nA late-night group reading of the entire Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge, which will lead into the 2:27 a.m. inauguration\n\nA Naturalization Ceremony hosted by the Coolidge Foundation and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (11 a.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 3)\n\nA theatrical premiere of \"Coolidge: Rediscovering an American President\" at the Woodstock Town Hall, 31 The Green, Woodstock, Vermont.\n\nWhy Calvin Coolidge became president\n\nCoolidge became the 30th U.S. president, and one of two Vermont-born presidents, after his predecessor, Harding, died of a sudden cerebral hemorrhage in 1923.\n\nWhen was Calvin Coolidge sworn in as president?\n\nAt 2:47 a.m. on Aug. 3 of 1923, the then-vice president's vacation was interrupted by a telegram informing him of Harding's death. Coolidge was promptly sworn in at the family's homestead in Plymouth Notch.\n\nCoolidge's oath was administered by his father, John Coolidge. Following the brief and sudden event, Coolidge returned to bed before he traveled down to Washington, D.C., to begin the work of the president.\n\n“It's a very interesting part of Vermont and of American history, and certainly very indicative of Coolidge, who is known for being a very common sense, no-nonsense person,” said Matthew Denhart, president of the Coolidge Foundation.\n\nWhat was Calvin Coolidge's connection to Massachusetts\n\nCoolidge was born in Plymouth Notch, Vermont, on July 4, 1872. He grew up on his family's farm and attended Amherst College in Massachusetts. Coolidge served as mayor of Northampton from 1910 to 1911, and as governor of Massachusetts from 1919 to 1921 before being elected vice president under Harding in 1920.\n\nCoolidge served as president from 1923 to 1929. During his presidency, the United States experienced a period of economic prosperity known as the Roaring Twenties.\n\nAfter the end of his second term, Coolidge returned to his home in Vermont and died in 1933 at the age of 60.\n\nDaytrips around Vermont: Former presidents and 'The Sound of Music': 5 Vermont historical homes you should visit\n\nWhen are the reenactments of Coolidge's Oath of Office typically\n\nEvery year on Aug. 3 at 2:47 p.m., the Coolidge Foundation holds a celebratory reenactment. The last one that took place at 2:47 a.m. was back in 1998 for the 75th anniversary.\n\nMemories of 1920s Vermont: Remembering Coolidge's visit home as president and more\n\n'Best-preserved presidential birthplace': Why Plymouth, Vermont, is unique\n\nVisitors are encouraged to enjoy the other historical attractions in Plymouth, which is often referred to as the best-preserved presidential birthplace in America.\n\nThe entire surrounding village is historically preserved, allowing visitors to see what a lot of Vermont villages in the 1920s would have looked like. Everyone of all ages can enjoy the museums in the small town of Plymouth Notch and the surrounding 200 acres of parks.\n\nOne of those places is the cheese factory Calvin Coolidge's father started in 1890. The factory, open from 11-4 every day, is still in operation today. Visitors can go and sample the different types of cheeses.\n\nDenhart recommends bringing a picnic as Plymouth is very remote, and there aren’t a lot of restaurants nearby. The historic site and surrounding 200 acres of parks makes for the perfect place to have lunch.\n\nContact Free Press staff writer Isabella Infante at iinfante@gannett.com"
