Singer Sarah Vaughan, whose voice earned her the nickname "Divine One," was eulogized at her hometown church as a "giant that never got too big."

Vaughan traced her singing career to the small Baptist church where her mother coaxed her into joining the choir as a girl. On Monday, Vauhgan's mother brought her back to Mount Zion Baptist Church for her funeral and burial."A Newark girl comes home, having gone full circle," said the Rev. Granville E. Seward, pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church, "and what a circle that has been."

Vaughan died April 3 of lung cancer at her California home. She was 66.

She was remembered Monday as a person who never forgot her hometown of Newark or Arts High School, her alma mater.

"She was a giant that never got too big, a star we could reach out and touch," Newark Mayor Sharpe James said. "For 50 years because of Sarah, every boy and girl who attended Arts High School can dream of doing the impossible."

Vaughan wanted her funeral held at Mount Zion, the neighborhood church where, as an 11-year-old, she joined the choir at the urging of her mother, Ada Vaughan.

"A voice born in heaven is now singing in heaven again, with an angelic choir," Seward said.

The service was simple, but filled with music, from gospel to Vaughan's signature jazz and pop tunes, capped by "Bring In the Clowns," one of her favorites.

About 500 people jammed into the sanctuary of the 118-year-old brownstone church for the private funeral.

Among the mourners were Vaughan's 87-year-old mother and the singer's daughter, Deborah Paris Vaughan, both of Hidden Hills, Calif.; singer Anita Baker; and jazzman Billy Eckstine, who is credited with launching Vaughan's professional career.
