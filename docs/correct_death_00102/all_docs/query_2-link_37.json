During a run at New York's Blue Note Jazz Club in 1989, she was diagnosed with lung cancer and was too ill to finish the last day of what would turn out to be her final series of public performances. She had been a heavy smoker. Vaughan returned to her home in California to begin chemotherapy and spent her final months alternating stays in the hospital and at home. She grew weary of the struggle and demanded to be taken home, where at the age of 66 she died on the evening of April 3, 1990, while watching Laker Girls, a television movie featuring her adopted daughter, Paris Vaughan. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#blackhistorymonth #blackhistory #blacklivesmatter #blm #sarahvaughan #singer #jazzsinger #jazzmusic #jazz #grave #cemetery #gravestone #buried #burialplace #burial #burialground #rip #restinpeace #cemeteryphotography #celebritygraves #memorial #celebrity\".",
