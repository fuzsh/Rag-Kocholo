        "text": "Four special broadcasts to celebrate two great jazz musicians. DOT Radio wishes to pay tribute to singer Sarah Vaughan on the centenary of her birth on 4 and 11 April at 9 p.m. . Speaker Claudia Aliotta, sicilian singer and jazz historian, author of the book “Le voci di Mingus”, will recall the extraordinary voice and personality of “Sassy”, one of the greatest jazz singers. In her weekly broadcast “Open Space” Claudia Aliotta will mark another important event: half a century from Duke Ellington’s death. On 18 and 25 April she will commemorate the iconic jazz composer and pianist speaking about his career and through two playlists with the best of his music. These broadcasts are created by Claudia Aliotta, console director Marco Cocco."
