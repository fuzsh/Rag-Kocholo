        "text": "Sarah Vaughan (born March 27, 1924, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.—died April 3, 1990, Hidden Hills, California) was an American jazz vocalist and pianist known for her rich voice, with an unusually wide range, and for the inventiveness and virtuosity of her improvisations. She is regarded as one of the greatest of all jazz singers.\n\nVaughan was the daughter of amateur musicians. Her father, a carpenter by trade, played guitar. Her mother, who worked as a laundress, was a vocalist in the church choir. Vaughan began studying piano and organ at age seven and, like her mother, sang in the church choir. After winning an amateur contest at Harlem’s famed Apollo Theater in 1942, she was hired as a singer and second pianist by the Earl Hines Orchestra. A year later she joined the singer Billy Eckstine’s band, where she met trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and saxophonist Charlie Parker. Vaughan’s singing style was influenced by their instruments. “I always wanted to imitate the horns,” she explained. Gillespie, Parker, and Vaughan recorded “Lover Man” together in 1945.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWho Said It? Women Musicians, Artists, and Writers\n\nBy the mid-1940s Vaughan began singing with John Kirby and appearing on television variety shows. During the 1950s her audience grew as she toured both the United States and Europe, and she signed with Mercury Record Corporation and EmArcy, Mercury’s jazz label, in 1953 to sing both pop and jazz. She also appeared in three movies in that period: Jazz Festival (1956), Disc Jockey (1951), and Basin Street Revue (1956)."
