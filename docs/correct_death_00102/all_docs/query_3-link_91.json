        "text": "April 3, 1990 Sarah Lois Vaughan, jazz singer known as “The Divine One,” died.\n\nVaughan was born March 27, 1924 in Newark, New Jersey. She began piano lessons at the age of seven and sang in the church choir. By her mid-teens, she was singing in local nightclubs. In 1942, Vaughan sang “Body and Soul” at the Apollo Amateur Night contest and won. She was noticed by Earl Hines and spent 1943 and 1944 touring the country with his big band.\n\nVaughan began her solo career in 1945 and recorded a number of hit jazz singles, including “If You Could See Me Now” (1946), which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998 as a recording of “qualitative or historical significance,” “Black Coffee” (1949), “Make Yourself Comfortable” (1954), and “Broken Hearted Melody” (1959).\n\nIn 1947, she won Esquire Magazine’s New Star Award. Her 1977 album “I Love Brazil” garnered a Grammy nomination. In 1980, Vaughan performed a symphonic Gershwin program with the New Jersey symphony which was broadcast by PBS and it won the 1981 Emmy Award for Individual Achievement – Special Class. A slightly modified version titled “Gershwin Live!” was recorded and it won the 1983 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance – Female."
