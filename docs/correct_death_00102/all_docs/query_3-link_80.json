Hi, everyone.\n\nSteve Adubato with my colleague, Jacqui Tricarico.\n\nThis is \"Remember Them.\"\n\nWe'll also be seen on our nightly series, \"One-on-One.\"\n\nJacqui, first of all, how exciting is this particular program for you?\n\nBecause you also did one of the interviews featuring the late, great Sarah Vaughan.\n\nHow exciting is this for you?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nYeah, getting to just learn more about Sarah Vaughan and we'll talk about her for the next segment.\n\nAnd then up first also learning about Celia Cruz.\n\nYou know, just this legend, musical legends that we get to speak with.\n\nArturo O'Farrill, who is a Grammy nominated and Grammy winner himself for his artistic work.\n\nHe has this personal connection with Celia, which we get to hear about from him, but also, you know, just learning more about her and the fact that she came from Havana, from Cuba.\n\nShe was in the United States touring with her band after they got together in the late 1950s.\n\nAnd during that time, Fidel Castro took control of Cuba.\n\nCelia Cruz and her band were not allowed back into Cuba at the time.\n\nEven after her mother passed away.\n\n- They were exiled.\n\n- Exiled.\n\nDidn't let them back in.\n\n- They left and then they were exiled.\n\n- So she became a US citizen and has, you know, was here for the rest of her career and the rest of her life until her passing.\n\nHer and her husband settled down in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n\n- Yep.\n\n- And she passed away in 2003 actually, but ended up making New Jersey her home.\n\nAnd she is a New Jersey Hall of Fame inductee as well.\n\n- What year, Jacqui?\n\n- New Jersey Hall of Fame was 2013.\n\n- You are good.\n\nThat or you have great notes.\n\n- It's funny 'cause New Jersey Hall of Fame has been doing this initiative over the past couple years by renaming a lot of the rest stops on the Garden State Parkway, and other major highways in New Jersey, and one of them was named after Celia Cruz.\n\n- Yep.\n\n- And what Arturo touches upon she, this next year, is gonna be on the quarter, on the United States quarter.\n\nI think that's just incredible.\n\n- It's a huge deal.\n\n- Huge deal.\n\n- For Jacqui and myself, on the back end, she'll be talking to Dr. Elaine Hayes, right, about Sarah Vaughan.\n\nBut up next, we have Arturo O'Farrill who's a great Latin jazz musician himself talking about Celia Cruz.\n\nLet's check it out.\n\n♪ (salsa music) ♪ Oye cómo va ♪ Mi ritmo ♪ ♪ Bueno pa'’ gozar ♪ ♪ Mulata ♪ ♪ Oye cómo va ♪ ♪ Mi ritmo ♪ ♪ Bueno pa'’ gozar ♪ ♪ (salsa music) ♪ Fast Singing ♪ (latin folk rhythm) ♪ ♪ Guantanamera ♪ ♪ Guajira Guantanamera ♪ ♪ Guantanamera ♪ ♪ Guajira Guantanamera ♪ - We're now joined by Arturo O'Farrill, who is an eight-time Grammy winner, professor of Global Jazz Studies at UCLA.\n\nGood to see you, Arturo.\n\n- So good to be here today, I'm very, very grateful.\n\n- You know, right before we got on there, you said you're grateful to have a chance to talk about Celia Cruz, why?\n\n- Wow, I can't even begin to think about it.\n\nFirst of all, for a Cuban lady to have impacted world culture so incredibly strongly, to be such an unbelievable image of powerful womanhood, to have a coin, to have a stamp, to have a rest area, I mean, for her to have made an impact in, you know, and not just in Latin culture, but on a worldwide scale.\n\nI'm so proud of her, I have such 'orgullo' Latino, I have so much pride for my people that when I see one of us become an icon it just throws me, because, you know, we are not the dominant culture in the United States or in the world.\n\nAnd so for me, when I look at Celia Cruz, and I look at her various faces of her career, and how she ascended from Sonora Matancera to be this superstar she is, I just feel like somewhere there's a little Latina girl going, if she can do it, I could do it.\n\n- Arturo mentioned several things, and I'm gonna go back over Celia Cruz's iconic, and by the way, PS, 2013 New Jersey Hall of Fame inductee, But in 2024, she'’s gonna be on the quarter.\n\n- Yes, this is what I've just read, yeah.\n\n- That's a big deal.\n\n- It's amazing.\n\n- So let's do this.\n\n- It's huge.\n\n- Okay, 70 albums, a Grammy winning Afro-Cuban singer, settled in Fort Lee, New Jersey, if you're wondering what's the New Jersey connection.\n\nBeginning, let's do this, she unfortunately died of brain cancer at the age of 77 in '20, excuse me, 2003.\n\nPrejudice, racism, discrimination and Celia Cruz, talk about it Arturo.\n\n- Oh my God, it's not easy to admit sometimes, but as a nation, we have a fear of brown, black skinned people, and especially if their ethnicity is spoken through a different language than English.\n\nAnd so, it's really amazing to me, 'cause I've experienced some of that otherness.\n\nIn the beginning of my career, I couldn't figure out why I didn't fit into this circle, or that circle, I wasn't Latino enough, I'm certainly not black.\n\nAnd we all experience it as Latinos, this thing that we can't put our fingers on.\n\nAnd so, you know, we still see this diatribe against immigrants that I think is horrendous, and I wanna say this, Celia Cruz is an immigrant that changed the face of music, how much more powerful we can be to be able to say that.\n\nI mean, the face of popular music was changed by a \"guarachera\" from Santos Suarez in La Habana.\n\n- Hold on, go back for a second, 'cause Scarlyn, who's operating our camera knows exactly what you just said, I do not.\n\nPlease, stop, Scarlyn, let's see it.\n\nNow you're into this.\n\nGo ahead, please translate.\n\n- You want me to translate?\n\n- Yes, please.\n\n- Yeah, of course, of course, hold on.\n\n- I'm Italian, I'm not Hispanic, I don't pick it up, I'm not Cuban.\n\nGo ahead.\n\n- Wait a second.\n\nItalian and Spanish, we're closely related in very many ways.\n\n- Yes, you know what the word in Italian is?\n\nWhat?\n\n- Vicino, which means close, here.\n\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n- So go ahead, I'm sorry.\n\nPick it up.\n\n- And it's great, because \"guaracha\" is kind of catch-all word for a kind of groove music, there's a guaracha, when a Latino is said to be grooving, he's said to be 'guaracheando', or 'guarachando', depending on what part of the Latin America you come from.\n\nSo it's a word for groove, and kind of the beginning of Celia Cruz's career, she was known as a guarachera, which means that she sang this groove music, which is impeccable.\n\nI mean, I'm thinking about specifically her, and her work with Sonora Matancera, which was very, very popular.\n\nIn particular, her song \"Crocante Habanera\", which is- - Say it again.\n\n- \"Crocante Habanera\".\n\nAnd the thing about where she's from, I know Santos Suarez, in La Habana, this is one of the little sections of Havana, it's fairly foggy, but man, Havana is beautiful.\n\nAnd to think about this habanera coming from this very specific neighborhood and changed the face of history, it's just great pride to me.\n\nMy father was from Havana, and he also made a big impact in the world of Afro-Cuban Jazz and in the world of jazz, so I'm always proud to see this happening.\n\n- By the way, let's make sure we put Arturo's information so people can find out more about him and his work at UCLA as a professor of Global Jazz Studies.\n\nDo this for us, because over my left shoulder, that is the autobiography of Celia Cruz.\n\nShe talks about her husband Pedro, talk about Pedro and their relationship.\n\n- That Pedro was her guardian angel.\n\nI mean, Pedro attended to her musically, emotionally.\n\nI mean, she really had a spirit guide in Pedro, who immediately saw, very early on in her career, he saw her genius.\n\nAnd it's funny, because in a way, it's a really beautiful story, a person who did put aside their male masculine ego need to be able to be a source of assistance to a brilliant, incredible woman.\n\nAnd so, everywhere you saw Celia, Pedro was there.\n\nWe did a jingle for Colgáte, for Colgate.\n\n- Hold, go back, because you worked directly with them.\n\nPlease, put that in context for us.\n\nI'm sorry for interrupting, Arturo.\n\n- No, not at all, not at all.\n\nI was privileged to, my father ran a jingle house, just a place that makes music for commercials.\n\nAnd he was a pioneer, because he kind of put real Latin genres into the commercials, they were made for the Hispanic market.\n\nAnd one of his big clients was Colgáte, or Colgate, and we had the privilege of being able to record one of those commercial jingles with Celia Cruz.\n\nAnd I just remember, oh, just, okay, she came in, and she was so lovely and genuine, and Pedro was by her side every step of the way.\n\nBut I remember specifically how genuinely warm she made you feel, like you'd been her friend for decades.\n\nAnd having just met the woman, I was struck by how lovely she was.\n\nAnd also, you know, my mother's father had that same symbiotic love kind of thing that just was so, so special to see.\n\nYou see that periodically in couples, but in the case of Pedro and Celia, it was very moving, it was very moving to me.\n\n- I would be remiss if I didn't bring this up, Celia Cruz, Cuba, Castro, getting outta there.\n\n- Whoa.\n\n- Like countless others, put that in perspective.\n\n- Well, you know, in 2004, the Miami Herald released some classified information that Celia had beginnings in the Communist Party.\n\nBut like many Cubans, when Fidel came to power, she distanced herself from that.\n\nAnd she lived like my father, and like so many Cubans, in exile, with a broken heart.\n\nCuba is literally- - It was our home.\n\n- One of the most, it was her home.\n\nCuba's literally one of the most incredible places, one of those magic power centers, where Europe, Africa and the new world, the Americas meet.\n\nAnd also the indigeneity of the Americas, all come together in this place, like Brazil, it's the same magic, this is a place where so many worlds meet.\n\nAnd for her to have left, and I know exactly how it felt for her to have left Cuba, it must have been very difficult.\n\nAnd strangely enough, she returned to Cuba in 1990 to perform at Guantanamo, and she took soil from her native land, I find this so touching, she took soil from her native land and asked for her to be buried, when she died, with this soil from her native lead.\n\nAnd in fact, indeed, she was entombed with Cuban soil in a coffin, at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.\n\n- Arturo, thank you, because it's one thing to read about Celia Cruz, or to try to understand what an incredibly important impact she's had on music, on culture, on salsa, and so many artistic aspects of our life in this country, particularly those who come from a certain background, but listening to you has taught us a lot more.\n\nThank you, we look forward to having you on again.\n\nThank you, Arturo O'Farrill.\n\n- It's my pleasure.\n\n- Eight-time Grammy winner.\n\n- Thank you for the opportunity.\n\n- I was just plugging, don't interrupt me while I'm plugging you, okay?\n\n(Arturo laughs) Eight-time Grammy winner, professor of Global Jazz Studies at UCLA.\n\nArturo, I cannot thank you enough, thank you.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- You got it.\n\nStay with us, we'll be right back.\n\n- [Narrator] To watch more One on One with Steve Adubato find us online and follow us on Social media.\n\nNow \"Remember Them\" takes a look at Newark's own, Sarah Vaughan.\n\nJacqui, you talked to Dr. Elaine Hayes, correct?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nAll about Sarah Vaughan.\n\nAnd Elaine is a musical historian.\n\nHas this love and appreciation for Sarah Vaughan.\n\nCreated this beautiful book all about her, her legacy, who she was.\n\nAnd, you know, Sarah Vaughan her roots were in Newark, New Jersey when she, her family at the Mount Zion Baptist Church.\n\nHer parents were very religious.\n\nShe found this love for music, for jazz, for all types of music really in her young teen years.\n\nAll throughout Newark she would be sneaking out, her parents not knowing, 'cause they were very, very religious.\n\nAnd getting into these jazz clubs, and these other clubs, these African American owned clubs around \"The Hill,\" that's a section in Newark at the time.\n\nJust getting in there.\n\nAnd they put her up on stage.\n\nThey got her performing and that's where she gained her confidence - In Newark?\n\nIn \"Brick City?\"\n\n- Yep.\n\nIn \"Brick City.\"\n\nAnd her career really just blossomed from there and expanded from there.\n\nAnd she's known by a lot of names, \"Sassy,\" \"The Divine One.\"\n\nElaine's book is called the \"Queen of Bebop.\"\n\nBut she didn't actually really like titles.\n\nShe didn't want to be pigeonholed into anything specific.\n\nAnd she just said, \"You know what, I'm a singer.\n\nThat's what I am.\"\n\n- That's awesome.\n\nAnd also, I want to make it clear, talk about Newark Public Schools.\n\nNot only Mount Zion Baptist Church was Sarah Vaughan a part of, but she attended Arts High.\n\nSome of the greatest -

Joining us now is Elaine Hayes, who is a musical historian, and she wrote the beautiful book, \"Queen of Bebop: The Musical Lives of Sarah Vaughan.\"\n\nElaine, thanks so much for joining us today.\n\n- Thanks for having me.\n\n- So Elaine, your fascination with Sarah Vaughan started when you were in college, right?\n\nTalk about that time discovering Sarah, who she was, and why you wanted to really dive deeper into her story and the musical legend that is Sarah Vaughan.\n\n- Yeah, of course.\n\nLike you said, I didn't learn about Sarah Vaughan until I was in college.\n\nI was a classically trained pianist and really had no experience with jazz, until a roommate of mine, she played Sarah Vaughan all the time, and I found myself immediately drawn to her voice.\n\nThe voice itself is just beautiful.\n\nIt's sumptuous, elegant, agile, almost operatic.\n\nBut I was also really drawn to the musicianship that was clearly in everything that Sarah sang.\n\nShe could be at the bottom of her range, and then swoop up to the top, and then cascade back down again.\n\nAll without missing a beat.\n\nAnd as a classical musician, her ability to improvise just wowed me.\n\nFast forward a couple years, I'm in graduate school in Philadelphia.\n\nI'm taking a Women in Jazz course, and our professor schedules a trip to go up to Newark where there's this amazing jazz archive called the Institute of Jazz Studies, and we were tasked with doing a research project.\n\nOf course, I chose Sarah Vaughan and I dove right in.\n\nAnd that was the first time I really started to understand the woman behind the music, and I was simply fascinated.\n\n- There's that three-octave part of her voice, right.\n\nAnd it's funny, you talk about just listening to her and getting entrapped with her voice and just how it sounded.\n\nAnd I've been listening to a little bit of her in preparation of this interview too, just to...\n\nI felt that same way.\n\nYou're holding onto every note listening to this huge voice that she had.\n\nAnd like you mentioned, Newark, it really all started for her in Newark.\n\nThat's where she was born and raised, that's where her career really started, right?\n\nShe grew up in this world of jazz, and these clubs, and this lifestyle, and this environment.\n\nTalk a little bit about that and how important her Newark roots were.\n\n- Oh, I think they were crucial to who Sarah Vaughan became.\n\nI often say without Newark, there wouldn't have been a Sarah Vaughan, because like you say, that's where her musical foundation began.\n\nAnd it really began at her family's church, the Mount Zion Baptist Church.\n\nThat's where she had her first musical experiences.\n\nThere's these really wonderful stories of people talking about how she would hum along while her mom sang in the choir.\n\nOr how as a toddler, she'd kind of sneak up to the front of the church so that she can sit with the organist and watch everything that was going on.\n\nAnd when her family decided it was time for Sarah to take piano lessons, they enlisted the church organist to teach her, and then she became the pianist for her church choir and her school choirs.\n\nBut even though she was this amazing pianist, she basically would say later in life that, \"No, I really wanted to sing and they weren't letting me sing.\"\n\nSo even though she became a alto in the church choir, her education, like the creation of Sarah Vaughan, the jazz musician that we know now, began when she started expanding her musical horizons and started venturing out into the Hill neighborhood in Newark.\n\nThere were a lot of Black-owned bars and nightclubs and dance halls.\n\nAnd she started when she was 12, 13, 14 years old, sneaking- - Getting into the clubs.\n\nThey were letting her sing right up on stage.\n\nAnd wasn't the fact that she was sneaking out and making sure her parents didn't know about it, because it seems like they were very against this because of their religious beliefs too, correct?\n\n- That's right, yes.\n\nThey were not excited to have their preteen running around Newark singing.\n\n- Yes.\n\n(Jacqui laughs) Of course not, of course not.\n\nBut that's where she really started developing her sense of who she was as a singer, right, and really was able to get her feet grounded there and be seen by so many people throughout the jazz community, even outside of jazz, right?\n\n- Yes.\n\nYes.\n\n- So in your book, you talk about Sarah Vaughan as, right, she's not just a jazz singer, she's not just the Queen of Bebop, like the name of your book.\n\nThere were a lot of nicknames for her, but she didn't like to be pigeonholed.\n\nShe didn't like labels.\n\nTalk about that a little bit.\n\nEspecially as a singer, she just didn't like those labels, right?\n\n- Yeah, you're exactly right.\n\nIn interviews, she'd often say, \"I am not a jazz singer.\n\nI'm a singer.\"\n\nAnd like you say, she really hated labels.\n\nShe thought there were too many labels in the music world.\n\nThere are too many labels in life in general.\n\nI think she had a very instinctive understanding that labels, like you say, were a way to confine and contain her.\n\nAnd that if she allowed herself to be labeled, it would limit her artistic options and her freedom to create and to sing whatever she wanted.\n\nAnd over the course of her 50 so years as a jazz singer, I shouldn't even say jazz singer.\n\n- Right.\n\n- As vocalist- - She wouldn't like that, right?\n\n- She wouldn't like that.\n\nAs a vocalist, I mean, she was singing spirituals and religious music as a kid.\n\nShe was a classically trained pianist.\n\nOf course we have the jazz, the bebop.\n\nIn the '50s and '60s, she was a pop singer.\n\nIn the '60s and '70s, she really got good at Brazilian music.\n\nShe covered The Beatles.\n\nAnd then in the last decades of her career, she almost became like an operatic diva who would perform with symphony orchestras across the country.\n\nSo there's this huge scope of the way she would sing.\n\n- And huge crossovers into so many genres.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- So the \"Queen of Bebop,\" what does that really mean?\n\nWhat does that title mean to you?\n\nAnd what do you think... Or what would you want it to mean to Sarah Vaughan?\n\n- Well, for me, it was a way to acknowledge the contributions that she made very early in her career.\n\nWhen she was just starting out in 1942 and 1943, she was in two bands that we now consider legendary.\n\nOne was led by the pianist, Earl Hines, and another was led by a fellow vocalist, Billy Eckstine.\n\nAnd in both of these bands, you had some of the most creative, innovative musicians of the day.\n\nPeople like Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, Gene Ammons, Art Blakey.\n\nAnd together, all of these musicians were in the process of redefining what jazz, how it sounded, what it would become.\n\nAnd they're in the process of developing this new kind of jazz called bebop.\n\nSo unlike swing that had preceded it, that is danceable, has hummable rhythms, bebop is focusing on virtuosity, a very complex cerebral music with really, really fast musical lines, extensive harmonic explorations into dissonance.\n\nIt was not music you would dance to, it's music that you listen to.\n\nAnd so there was this moment when jazz is switching from a popular music to an art music.\n\nAnd while we've talked a lot about Dizzy Gillespie or Charlie Parker, we've talked a lot less about Sarah Vaughan's contributions.\n\nShe was an- - Why do you think that is?\n\nIs it because she was a woman during that time period?\n\n- I think that has definitely impacted that.\n\nAnd also there's a tendency not to take the musical contributions of vocalists quite as seriously.\n\nBut the reality is that she was the first person singing in a bebop style.\n\nShe was defining what Marlon vocal jazz would become.\n\nAnd that title, \"Queen of Bebop,\" is just an opportunity to honor that contribution.\n\n- And you talked about Dizzy Gillespie a little bit, but talk about the relationship.\n\nI know at one point he nicknamed her The Sailor, and you talk about that in your book, and just her on the road with this band, the only woman, and some of the hurdles she had to cross to get through those times on the road being the only woman in an all-man band.\n\n- Well, I think the way that she survived that was, yes, she was the only woman in the band, but she insisted upon being one of the guys.\n\nIf they are playing craps, if they're drinking, she's doing it right alongside them.\n\nSo there was that kind of lifestyle choice of, \"I'm gonna be one of the guys.\"\n\nBut also musically, she was right in the thick of it.\n\nShe was a musical equal to these guys.\n\nAnd when they're doing their brash musical exploration and experimentation, she was right there doing it too.\n\n- Yeah, she gained that respect really quickly, it seemed like.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- So, describe too her relationship with Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nThat is a name I feel like we hear more commonly or just as a more well-known name.\n\nBut there was a time when really Sarah broke through, people became to know her more after her performance on the Apollo, correct?\n\nAnd then shift over to the Ella Fitzgerald relationship as well.\n\n- Well, I think in the press, there's a tendency to want to pit them as rivals against one another and the idea that there's only space for one really big jazz star.\n\nBut the reality is that they both had great respect for one another.\n\nThey understood that they were both very talented women and they both thrived in the scene.\n\nWe do know Ella Fitzgerald a little bit better, or you could say a lot better.\n\nI think that's, in large part, because she had really good management and really good producers that knew how to market her for a wide mainstream audience, whereas Sarah often didn't have the best managers.\n\n- In your book, if people wanna pick up your book, you're gonna get more plethora of information about Sarah Vaughan and her life even later on in her career.\n\nBut for you, what do you think Sarah Vaughan would want her legacy to be?\n\n- I think she would want people to believe that, first of all, she was a very talented person who always sang the way that she wanted to.\n\nThat she had a very unique vision of her voice and what she could do with it.\n\nAnd she thoroughly enjoyed using her voice in this extremely virtuosic way.\n\nAnd I think when I think about her legacy for other musicians, it's that she...\n\nIn many ways, by listening to Sarah Vaughan, generations of vocalists have learned that you can be a creative equal and an ensemble, and that you can own your musical choices, and that you can be a serious musician, rather than just the chick singer off to the side.\n\nI believe that's what she would want people to appreciate in addition to her amazing recordings.\n\n- Of course.\n\nAnd Elaine, thank you so much.\n\nIf you wanna learn more about Sarah Vaughan, like I said, pick up Elaine's book, \"Queen of Bebop: The Musical Lives of Sarah Vaughan.\"\n\nThanks, Elaine, for joining us and thank you at home for joining us.\n\nWe'll see you next time on \"Remember Them.\"\n\n- [Narrator] One-on-One with Steve Adubato has been a production of the Caucus Educational Corporation.\n\nFunding has been provided by PSE&G, NJM Insurance Group.\n\nHackensack Meridian Health.\n\nThe New Jersey Education Association.\n\nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey.\n\nPrudential Financial.\n\nKean University.\n\nAnd by New Jersey Sharing Network.\n\nPromotional support provided by New Jersey Globe.\n\nAnd by New Jersey Monthly.\n\n- (Narrator) Life is full of changes.\n\nAt Hackensack Meridian Medical Group, we're ready for them.\n\nIf you have a cold or chronic illness, our five star doctors can treat any ailment.\n\nWhether you're starting recess or retiring, we're prepared with pediatric and adult specialists.\n\nAnd if you just moved here, we are in your neighborhood.\n\nYou now have access to a health team thousand strong.\n\nSo no matter what or when, we're ready."
