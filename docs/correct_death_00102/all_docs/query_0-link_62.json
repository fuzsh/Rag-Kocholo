        "text": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Panopticon-Review/342702882479366\n\nSARAH VAUGHAN\n\n(b. March 27, 1924--d. April 3, 1990)\n\nSarah Vaughan, Live at Mr. Kelly's, Chicago, 1957-- (full album):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q71a25C0yCM\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/…/episodes/sara…/about-sarah-vaughan/723/\n\nAMERICAN MASTERS\n\nOctober 8th, 2005\n\nSarah Vaughan\n\nAbout Sarah Vaughan\n\nPBS\n\nJazz critic Leonard Feather called her “the most important singer to emerge from the bop era.” Ella Fitzgerald called her the world’s “greatest singing talent.” During the course of a career that spanned nearly fifty years, she was the singer’s singer, influencing everyone from Mel Torme to Anita Baker. She was among the musical elite identified by their first names. She was Sarah, Sassy — the incomparable Sarah Vaughan.\n\nBorn in Newark, New Jersey, in 1924, Vaughan was immediately surrounded by music: her carpenter father was an amateur guitarist and her laundress mother was a church vocalist. Young Sarah studied piano from the age of seven, and before entering her teens had become an organist and choir soloist at the Mount Zion Baptist Church. When she was eighteen, friends dared her to enter the famed Wednesday Night Amateur Contest at Harlem’s Apollo Theater. She gave a sizzling rendition of “Body and Soul,” and won first prize. In the audience that night was the singer Billy Eckstine. Six months later, she had joined Eckstine in Earl Hines’s big band along with jazz legends Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker.\n\nWhen Eckstine formed his own band soon after, Vaughan went with him. Others including Miles Davis and Art Blakey, were eventually to join the band as well. Within a year, however, Vaughan wanted to give a solo career a try. By late 1947, she had topped the charts with “Tenderly,” and as the 1940s gave way to the 1950s, Vaughan expanded her jazz repertoire to include pop music. As a result, she enlarged her audience, gained increased attention for her formidable talent, and compiled additional hits, including the Broadway show tunes “Whatever Lola Wants” and “Mr. Wonderful.” While jazz purists balked at these efforts, no one could deny that in any genre, Vaughan had one of the greatest voices in the business.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Vaughan returned to jazz music, performing and making regular recordings. Throughout the 1970s and ’80s she recorded with such jazz notables as Oscar Peterson, Louie Bellson, Zoot Sims, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Don Cherry, and J.J. Johnson. Her recordings of the “Duke Ellington Song Book (1 and 2)” are considered some of the finest recordings of the time. While for many years her signature song had been “Misty,” by the mid-70’s, she was closing every show with Sondheim’s “Send In The Clowns.” In 1982, while in her late fifties, Vaughan won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocalist for her album, “Gershwin Live”!\n\nWhile she continued to work without the massive commercial success enjoyed by colleagues such as Peggy Lee, Rosemary Clooney, and Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan consistently retained a special place in the hearts of fellow musicians and audiences alike. She continually performed at top venues, playing to adoring sell-out crowds well into her sixties. Remarkably, unlike many singers, she lost none of her extraordinary talent as time went on. Her multi-octave range, with its swooping highs and sensual lows, and the youthful suppleness of her voice shaded by a luscious timbre and executed with fierce control, all remained intact. In 1990, at the age sixty-six, Sarah Vaughan passed away. Shortly after her death, Mel Torme summed up the feelings of all who had seen her, saying “She had the single best vocal instrument of any singer working in the popular field.”\n\nSassy: The Life Of Sarah Vaughan\n\nby Leslie Gourse\n\nPaperback, 320 pages\n\nPublished August 22nd 1994\n\nby Da Capo Press\n\n(First published by C. Scribner's Sons in hardcover in 1993)\n\nSarah Vaughan possessed the most spectacular voice in jazz history. In Sassy, Leslie Gourse, the acclaimed biographer of Nat King Cole and Joe Williams, defines and celebrates Vaughan’s vital musical legacy and offers a detailed portrait of the woman as well as the singer. Revealed here is ”The Divine One” as only her closest friends and musical associates knew her. By her early twenties Sarah Vaughan was singining with Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Billy Eckstine, helping them invent bebop. For forty-five years thereafter, she reigned supreme in both pop and jazz, with several million-selling hits (among them ”Broken Hearted Melody,” ”Make Yourself Comfortable,” and ”Misty”).But life offstage was never smooth for Sarah Vaughan. Her voluptuous voice was matched by her exuberant appetite for excess: three failed marriages, financial difficulties through many changes in management, late-night jam sessions, liquor, and cocaine. In Sassy, though, we also see the feisty and unpretentious woman who worked hard all her life to support her parents and adopted daughter, and who came to savor the hard-won independence and worldwide acclaim she achieved as the greatest jazz singer of her generation.\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/artists/15202481/sarah-vaughan\n\nSarah Vaughan \"Misty\" Live 1964:\n\nSarah Vaughan \"Tenderly\" Live 1958:\n\nCount Basie & Sarah Vaughan LIVE in Carnegie Hall 1981:\n\nSarah Vaughan - Live in '58 & '64:\n\nPerformers:\n\nSarah Vaughan (Vocal)\n\nRichard Davis (Bass)\n\nRonnell Bright (Piano)\n\nArt Morgan (Drums)\n\nSONGS:\n\nLive in Sweden 1958\n\nSometimes I’m Happy\n\nLover Man\n\nSeptember In The Rain\n\nMean To Me\n\nTenderly\n\nIf This Isn’t Love\n\nLive in Holland 1958\n\nOver The Rainbow\n\nThey All Laughed\n\nLover Man\n\nCherokee\n\nSometimes I’m Happy\n\nLive in Sweden 1964\n\nI Feel Pretty\n\nThe More I See You\n\nBaubles, Bangles And Beads\n\nI Got Rhythm\n\nMisty\n\nHoneysuckle Rose\n\nMaria\n\nBill Bailey, Won’t You Please Come Home\n\nEntertainment › Noah K.
