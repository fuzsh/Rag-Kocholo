        "text": "Historically speaking, did you know:\n\nSarah Lois Vaughan (1924-1990), the acclaimed Jazz singer and pianist, was born in Newark and grew up with music at home, at school, and at Newark clubs and theaters. Singer Billy Eckstine discovered her in 1942 at Harlem’s Apollo Theater. Bandleader Earl “Fatha” Hines hired her in 1942, and in 1945, she began barnstorming small towns and big city clubs.\n\nDubbed “Sassy” and “Divine One,” Vaughan sang at the Garden State Arts Center, the Hollywood Bowl, the Newport Jazz Festival, and other venues. She died of lung cancer in Hidden Hills, California and is buried in Glendale Cemetery in Bloomfield.\n\nIn colonial New Jersey, the franchise of voting was limited to white males who were property owners. The state’s 1776 Constitution gave the vote to “inhabitants” of full age and who have a property and residence requirement.\n\nThe Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor is a bi-state regulatory agency tasked with investigating, deterring, and combating criminal activity and influence in the Port of New York and New Jersey. Port Newark-Elizabeth and the Hudson County waterfront are including within the larger Port of NY and NJ, the region within approximately a 25-mile radius of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nWestinghouse Electric Corporation was organized by inventor and entrepreneur George Westinghouse in Pittsburgh in 1886."
