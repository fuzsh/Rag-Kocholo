        "text": "(1924–90). Jazz vocalist Sarah Vaughan was revered as the “Divine One” for her rich operatic voice which, with its instrumental three-octave range, and for helping to define bebop during the 1940s.\n\nSarah Lois Vaughan was born on March 27, 1924, in Newark, New Jersey, to Ada and Asbury Vaughan. Both parents were musical, and Sarah began her musical training at an early age. Vaughan was discovered in 1942 when, on a friend’s dare, she entered a jazz contest at Harlem’s Apollo Theatre in New York City. Billy Eckstine, the influential member of the Hines band, was impressed by her performance; she joined the Hines band as a vocalist and pianist shortly thereafter. When Eckstine left the band to form his own bop-oriented big band, Sarah joined him.\n\nVaughan scored her first hit, “It’s Magic,” in 1948. That hit was followed by such favorites as “Broken-Hearted Melody,” “If You Could See Me Now,” “Tenderly,”“ I’ll Remember April,” “Here’s That Rainy Day, ” “Misty,” and “Send in the Clowns,” which became her signature song. In the course of her singing career, she toured Europe in the 1950s, toured internationally in the 1960s, and performed on many television shows. Vaughan’s remarkable ability to improvise melodies, her octave-leaping interpretations, and her versatile voice with its rich contralto resonance and heavy vibrato made her an international jazz legend of near incomparable stature. Vaughan died on April 3, 1990, in Hidden Hills, California."
