Sarah Vaughan was an American jazz singer known as \"Sassy\" and \"The Divine One\". She was born in 1924 in Newark, New Jersey and began singing professionally in her late teens. She gained recognition after winning an amateur night contest at the Apollo Theater in 1942, which led to her joining the bands of Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine. In the mid-1940s she began a successful solo career, recording for several labels. Known for her wide vocal range and improvisational skills, she won multiple Grammys and was considered one of the greatest singers of the 20th century.",
