        "text": "On September 30, 1967, the 2nd Quaker City Jazz Festival became the first event hosted by the Spectrum.\n\nThe two-day festival was produced by Herb Spivak, co-owner of the legendary Showboat. According to Joe McAllister:\n\nSpivak went to Ed Snider and company (the Flyers were still in their infancy and the Sixers played at the Convention Center) and said he’d like to book a two-day jazz concert. Initially rebuffed because the Snider group didn’t believe a jazz bill would sell. Spivak replied, “That’s my problem.”\n\nSpivak booked 10 groups a day and once again sold out the concert in two days. Dizzy Gillespie opened up the Spectrum with “God Bless America” followed by performances by Stan Getz, Dave Brubeck, Sarah Vaughan and Flip Wilson among others.\n\nThe lineup also included Cannonball Adderley, Astrud Gilberto, Groove Holmes and Arthur Prysock.\n\nThe Spectrum formally closed on October 31, 2009. Demolition was completed in May 2011.\n\nOn March 29, 2016, at the Sarah Vaughan Concert Hall at Newark Symphony Hall, the United States Postal Service released the Sarah Vaughan Forever Stamp.\n\nDeputy Postmaster General Ronald Stroman dedicated the stamp:\n\nAs one of the most compelling vocalists in American history, Sarah Vaughan was renowned for her artistic eloquence. Her dynamic vocal range, iconic vibrato, and innovative phrasing helped to transform jazz and popular music. The Postal Service is proud to honor Sarah Vaughan. Let this stamp serve as a lasting tribute to her legacy.\n\nTrumpeter Wynton Marsalis, who played with Miss Vaughan when he was 21 years old, sent a video tribute:\n\nIt’s only fitting that Sarah Vaughan is being memorialized with a forever stamp. She was great on so many levels. In honoring her, we honor ourselves. And her talent is truly forever.\n\nThe Sarah Vaughan Forever stamp is available at local post offices or online.\n\nMarch is Women in Jazz Month. To mark the occasion, the U.S. Postal Service is issuing the Sarah Vaughan Forever stamp.\n\nNJ.com reports:\n\nJazz legend Sarah Vaughan is being honored with a U.S. Forever stamp, which will be released March 29 with a free concert at her hometown’s Newark Symphony Hall.\n\nVaughan, who sang in the Mt. Zion Baptist Church Choir and attended Arts High School, joins the ranks of Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Johnny Cash, all part of the Postal Service’s Music Icons stamp series. The stamp is an image of a Bart Forbes oil painting based on a 1955 photograph by Hugh Bell of Vaughan in performance.\n\nThe Grammy- and Emmy-winning singer nicknamed “The Divine One” and “Sassy” died of lung cancer in 1990 at 66. A member of the Jazz Hall of Fame and the New Jersey Hall of Fame, her hits include “Misty,” “Broken-Hearted Melody,” and “Send in the Clowns.”\n\nThe First-Day-of-Issue dedication ceremony will be held on March 29 at 11:00 a.m. at the Sarah Vaughan Concert Hall of Newark Symphony Hall. The gala event features a Proclamation from Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and remarks from Grammy Award-winning vocalist Dianne Reeves. The musical highlights include performances by actress and singer Melba Moore, the Mount Zion Baptist Church Choir and the NJPAC Jazz for Teens Ensemble with Jazzmeia Horn.\n\nInformation on how to obtain free tickets for the concert is available here.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service announced that the Sarah Vaughan forever stamp will be issued in 2016:\n\nJazz and pop singer Sarah Vaughan (1924-90) will be commemorated on a forever stamp in the Music Icons series, with 16 stamps in the full pane.\n\nThe Divine One will join fellow Union Local 274 members Count Basie, John Coltrane, Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald who also have been accorded this honor."
