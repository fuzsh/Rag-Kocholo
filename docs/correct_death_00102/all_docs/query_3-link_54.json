        "text": "Basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Abdul-Jabbar is unquestionably one of the greatest players to ever take the court, and has been honored with selections to numerous All-Star games and as well as being named Sports Illustrated \"Sportsman of the Year.\" (His pending selection to the Basketball Hall of Fame is a certainty). Abdul-Jababr put in 20 years in the NBA before retiring from the Los Angeles Lakers at the end of last season.\n\nClassical music critic Lloyd Schwartz reviews a new reissue featuring Czech conductor Vaclav Talich (VATZ-lahf TAH-litch). Talich led the Czech Philharmonic off and on from the 20s to 1961. Lloyd says this recording shows Talich's national flavor, a trait that's lost in this modern world of globe-hopping star conductors. This recording features performances of Dvorak's 8th Symphony, and Smetana's \"Moldau\" and \"From Bohemian Woods and Fields.\" (the recording is on Supraphon).\n\nComedian Imogene Coca. Coca is a television legend, co-starring with Sid Caeser on the groundbreaking comedy series, \"Your Show of Shows,\" in the 1950s. Since then, Coca's had numerous roles on TV, on stage, and in movies. Imogene Coca is teeming up with Sid Caesar once again, for a series of appearances at Michael's Pub in New York City, beginning April 17th.\n\nDivine: The Jazz Albums, 1954-1958 packs four CDs with Vaughan's music, recorded live or in the studio with bands big and small. Two live albums from Chicago nightclubs are standouts, partly when a performance threatens to slide off the rails.\n\nAuthor, jazz writer and musician, Stuart Nicholson. He is an expert on and biographer of late jazz great Ella Fitzgerald. Through interviews with those closest to her,. \"Ella Fitzgerald: A Biography of the First Lady of Jazz\" (1994, Charlse Scribner's Sons) shows the public and private side of the media-shy legend. In her career of over 60 years, she gained the admiration of her contemporaries in the business. At the age of 79 and after years of suffering from diabetes, Fitzgerald died Saturday (June 15) at her home in California."
