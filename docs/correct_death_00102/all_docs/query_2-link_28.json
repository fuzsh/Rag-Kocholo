While there is no mistake that Jelly Roll was in influential jazz pianist, his claim may be slightly exaggerated, but that would not be out of character for this vivacious entrepreneur.\n\nJelly Roll's career as a jazz musician in Washington, D.C. began in 1936 when he moved to the District and became manager of a nightclub above a U Street restaurant. Financial backing came from Cordelia, Jelly Roll's partner, whose business knowledge left something to be desired. Although Jelly Roll's nightclub had potential to flourish as a jazz hotspot, Cordelia often invited her friends to come for free, seldom asking the full price for anything. While Jelly Roll acted as manager, he also worked as a part-time bartender, bouncer, feature performer, and occasional chef. The name of the club changed frequently, originally 'The Music Box,' then \"The Blue Moon Inn,' and finally 'The Jungle Inn.' In 1937, Jelly Roll was joined in Washington, D.C. by his wife, Mabel, and the two soon came to the conclusion that Cordelia and her friends were not good for the club's business. The final straw came when one of Cordelia's friends stabbed Jelly Roll following a brief verbal altercation. After this incident, Mabel insited that she and Jelly Roll pack up, move on, and leave behind the turbulent nightclub business.\n\nAlthough Jelly Roll remained in Washington, D.C. for only a few years, he left behind a legacy of jazz for the U Street community. The proximity of the Library of Congress allowed Jelly Roll to meet with Alan Lomax, the director of the Archive of American Folklore, in 1938 before departing Washington, D.C. Lomax recorded hours of Jelly Roll's music and oral history, establishing Jelly Roll's influence on jazz.\n\n[ Performers | Venues | HR57 | White House | U Street Now ]"
