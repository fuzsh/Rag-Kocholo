Her debut studio album was issued in 1950 and was followed by her second self-titled studio recording was released on EmArcy Records in 1954. The later was a collaborative effort with Clifford Brown.[1] Vaughan's 1958 album titled Sarah Vaughan Sings George Gershwin later would chart in the top 50 of the Billboard Traditional Jazz Albums chart.[2] In 1959, No Count Sarah (a collaborative release with the Count Basie Orchestra) reached the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart.[3] Vaughan recorded three live records for Mercury Records during the 1950s, beginning with 1957's At Mister Kelly's.[4]\n\nIn the 1960s, Vaughan recorded a series of albums for Roulette Records, beginning with 1960's ballad-focused Dreamy.[5] She and the Count Basie Orchestra released a second studio album in 1961.[6] The decade was further highlighted by further Roulette projects, such as the Sarah Slightly Classical (1963) and Sarah Sings Soulfully (1965).[7] She later moved back to Mercury Records and released several albums beginning with the Latin-flavored ¡Viva! Vaughan.[8] Her final album releases for Mercury were issued in 1967.[7] Vaughan then recorded several albums for Mainstream Records between 1971 and 1974.[9] This included 1973's Live in Japan.[7] Additionally, an album with Michel Legrand reached the Billboard 200 chart during this time.[10] Vaughan then recorded for Pablo Records and released several albums through 1982, ending with Crazy and Mixed Up. Her final studio effort was 1987's Brazilian Romance.[7] In later years, her compilation albums would reach charting Billboard positions on the Jazz charts. This included Ken Burns Jazz (2000) and Sarah for Lovers (2003).[2]\n\nStudio albums[edit]\n\n1950s[edit]\n\nList of studio albums, with selected chart positions, showing other details Title Album details Peak chart\n\npositions US\n\nTrad.\n\nJazz\n\n[2] UK\n\n[3] Sarah Vaughan\n\n(with George Treadwell and his All Stars)\n\nReleased: 1950\n\nLabel: Columbia\n\nFormats: LP\n\n— — Sarah Vaughan\n\n(with Clifford Brown)\n\nReleased: 1954\n\nLabel: EmArcy\n\nFormats: LP\n\n— — In the Land of Hi-Fi\n\nReleased: 1955\n\nLabel: EmArcy\n\nFormats: LP\n\n— — Sassy\n\nReleased: 1956\n\nLabel: EmArcy\n\nFormats: LP\n\n— — Swingin' Easy\n\nReleased: 1957\n\nLabel: EmArcy\n\nFormats: LP\n\n— — Sarah Vaughan in a Romantic Mood\n\nReleased: 1957\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormats: LP\n\n— — Sarah Vaughan and Billy Eckstine Sing\n\nthe Best of Irving Berlin\n\n(with Billy Eckstine)\n\nReleased: 1957\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormats: LP\n\n— — Sarah Vaughan Sings Broadway: Great\n\nSongs from Hit Shows\n\nReleased: 1958\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormats: LP\n\n— — Sarah Vaughan Sings George Gershwin\n\n(with Hal Mooney & His Orchestra)\n\nReleased: 1958\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormats: LP\n\n44 — No Count Sarah\n\n(with Count Basie Orchestra)\n\nReleased: 1959\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormats: LP\n\n— 19 Vaughan and Violins\n\nReleased: 1959\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormats: LP\n\n— — The Magic of Sarah Vaughan\n\nReleased: 1959\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormats: LP\n\n— — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\n1960s[edit]\n\nList of studio albums, showing all relevant details Title Album details Close to You\n\nReleased: 1960\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormats: LP\n\nDreamy\n\nReleased: April 19, 1960\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nThe Divine One\n\nReleased: December 1960\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nMy Heart Sings\n\nReleased: 1961\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormats: LP\n\nCount Basie/Sarah Vaughan\n\n(with Count Base Orchestra)\n\nReleased: 1961\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nAfter Hours\n\nReleased: September 1, 1961\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nYou're Mine You\n\nReleased: March 1962\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nSarah + 2\n\nReleased: 1962\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nSarah Sings Soulfully\n\nReleased: 1963\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nSnowbound\n\nReleased: October 1962\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nThe Explosive Side of Sarah Vaughan\n\nReleased: 1963\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nSarah Slightly Classical\n\nReleased: 1963\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nStar Eyes\n\nReleased: September 1963\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nThe Lonely Hours\n\nReleased: March 1964\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\nVaughan with Voices\n\nReleased: July 1964\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormats: LP\n\nSweet 'n' Sassy\n\nReleased: October 1964\n\nLabel: Roulette\n\nFormats: LP\n\n¡Viva!
