        "text": "Name\n\nVaughan, Sarah Gender: F\n\nBirthname Sarah Lois Vaughan born on 27 March 1924 at 21:45 (= 9:45 PM ) Place Newark, New Jersey, 40n44, 74w10 Timezone EST h5w (is standard time) Data source\n\nQuoted BC/BR\n\nRodden Rating AA Collector: Rodden\n\nAstrology data 07°09' 10°35 Asc. 19°03'\n\nBiography\n\nAmerican singer who was known as, \"The Divine One,\" and recognized for her black jazz. As the owner of a controlled vibrato with a two-octave range and a four-octave contralto, she sang in nightclubs, on European tours, at concerts, on TV and did records. Throughout a recording career of 45 years she did dozens of incomparable masterpieces. In addition, she wore two faces, one of an ingenious jazz singer, and another of an exquisite pop diva.\n\nThe daughter of a carpenter who played guitar and a laundress who sang in the church choir, Sarah learned to love music from the time she was a kid, and played piano from age seven. She got a big break in October 1942, when, at the urging of her friends, she performed at an amateur night in Harlem's Apollo Theater. Her exquisite rendition of \"Body and Soul\" won first price, captivating the audience, among whom was singer Billy Ekstine. Six short months later she was singing with him and the Earl Hines band. She followed Eckstine when he left to form his own band but by the mid-1940s, her career on the rise, she went solo. Her range, her silky vocals, her wide repertoire and her jazzy, soulful and romantic renditions, appealed to an ever-widening audience over the next several decades.\n\nOn 18 September 1947 she was married to trumpeter George Treadwell; he became her manager and oversaw her transition to singing pop songs. However, the marriage ultimately ended in divorce, one of four ventures into matrimony with Clyde Atkins, football player, Marshall Fisher,restaurateur and Waymon Reed, trumpet player. She had one daughter, Deborah Paris Vaughan, who was adopted.\n\nVaughan died of lung cancer after a year of illness on 3 April 1990, Hidden Hills, CA\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nassociate relationship with Adderley, Cannonball (born 15 September 1928)\n\nassociate relationship with Basso, Gianni (born 24 May 1931)\n\nassociate relationship with Brown, Clifford (born 30 October 1930)\n\nassociate relationship with Croisille, Nicole (born 9 October 1936)\n\nassociate relationship with Dameron, Tadd (born 21 February 1917)\n\nassociate relationship with Davis, Miles (born 26 May 1926)\n\nassociate relationship with Davis, Richard (born 15 April 1930)\n\nassociate relationship with Haynes, Roy (born 13 March 1925)\n\nassociate relationship with Hendricks, Belford (born 11 June 1909)\n\nassociate relationship with Jones, Harold (born 27 February 1940)\n\nassociate relationship with Powell, Bud (born 27 September 1924)\n\nassociate relationship with Renaud, Henri (born 20 April 1925)\n\nassociate relationship with Roach, Max (born 10 January 1924)\n\nassociate relationship with Simpkins, Andy (born 29 April 1932).
