        "text": "Sarah Vaughan was born on March 27, 1924, Newark, N.J. She died April 3, 1990, in Hidden Hills, CA.\n\nVaughn was American jazz singer and pianist, lauded for her ability to command pitch and dynamics across three vocal octaves, whose singing style was informed by the harmony and improvisation of jazz horn sections.\n\nSarah Vaughan's parents, both of whom were musicians, cultivated and nurtured her early interest in music. She began taking piano lessons at age seven and organ lessons at eight. By the age of 12, she was playing the organ for the Mount Zion Baptist Church and singing in its choir. She later attended Arts High School in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1942, Vaughan entered and won an amateur night contest for which she sang \"Body and Soul.\" Her award was ten dollars and a week of performances at the Apollo, an engagement which led to her being hired as a vocalist and second pianist in Earl \"Fatha\" Hines's big-band. In 1944, she joined singer Billy Eckstine's band. She recorded the hit \"Lover Man\" (1945) with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, also members of Eckstine's ensemble, before launching her solo career in 1946 at the New York Cafe Society. In 1949, she landed a five-year recording contract with Columbia Records. Vaughan sustained her success as a singer through the early 1980s, recording on numerous labels, performing with a variety of jazz artists, and touring several countries."
