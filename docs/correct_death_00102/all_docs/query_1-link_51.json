        "text": "Sarah Vaughan had the voice of a century. Now it is her centennial birthday.\n\nWith Sarah Vaughan it is all about the voice. It is one of the best of any singer in any field. She was envied by colleagues like Frank Sinatra, critics fell over themselves to describe her brilliance, while musicologists marvelled at her vocal range.\n\nSarah Vaughn was born on March 27, 1924. She was singing and playing piano in the church from an early age. Still a teenager she began her career in 1943 with the band of singer Billy Eckstine. Soon Vaughan recorded music in her own name with musicians like Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Miles Davis.\n\nShe recorded popular songs from the great American songbook. Among her hits was “Tenderly,” “It’s Magic,” and “Black Coffee.” She recorded a lot of great jazz albums with musicians like trumpeter Clifford Brown, and drummer Roy Haynes. She also recorded a lot of pop albums with strings and big bands. Quincy Jones often produced her albums.\n\nBack to jazz\n\nVaughan continued to sing jazz as on Live in Japan (1973) where she performed with a quartet with Jimmy Cobb on drums singing jazz standards in her inimitable way. Her voice has deepened with age which gives the songs new nuances.\n\nWhen she signed with the jazz-oriented Pablo Records in 1977 it led to her recording two albums of songs by Duke Ellington, and performances with pianist Oscar Peterson and bassist Ray Brown.\n\nSarah Vaughan continued touring in the 1980s reprising her great hits from the American songbook. She died of lung cancer in 1990 and was survived by her adopted daughter Paris Vaughan who was an actress.\n\nListening to Sarah Vaughan\n\nSarah Vaughan recorded so many albums that it can be hard to know where to start listening to her. You probably wind up with a best of compilation which is a pity since she recorded so many good albums. Here are some of my favourites:\n\nSarah Vaughan in Hi-Fi (Columbia, 1955)\n\nSarah Vaughan with a nice ensemble including Miles Davis on trumpet sings a typical set of popular set of popular songs by Gershwin, Rogers and Hart, and Fats Waller. Recorded 1949-52.\n\nSarah Vaughan (EmArcy, 1955)\n\nSarah Vaughan with trumpeter Clifford Brown and drummer Roy Haynes is one of the great vocal jazz albums of all time.\n\nSwingin’ Easy (EmArcy, 1957)\n\nSarah Vaughan with two different quartets which both includes drummer Roy Haynes. Has some extraordinary singing by Vaughan.\n\nAt Mister Kelly’s (Mercury, 1958)\n\nVaughan with pianist Jimmy Jones, bassist Richard Davis, and drummer Roy Haynes recorded live in Chicago. Vaughan at her best with a highly sophisticated band.\n\nAfter Hours at the London House (Mercury, 1959)\n\nWhy change a winning concept? Vaughan live in Chicago with Davis and Haynes. This time with a horn section with trumpeter Thad Jones.\n\nSassy Swings the Tivoli (Mercury, 1963)\n\nA double album full of magical vocal moments recorded live in Copenhagen with a new rhythm section. Quincy Jones produced the album.\n\nSarah Vaughn Live in Japan (Mainstream, 1973)\n\nSarah Vaughan performing her hits with a quartet with drummer Jimmy Cobb, so you know it swings.\n\nDuke Ellington Songbook 1 (Pablo, 1979)\n\nSarah Vaughan and the late maestro Ellington is a wonderful combination. The band includes pianist Jimmy Rowles, drummer Grady Tate, and lots of famous horn player.\n\nGershwin Live (Columbia, 1982)\n\nIt was thought that Sarah Vaughan could have become a great opera singer if she had the training. This performance with The Los Angeles Philharmonic gives you an idea of how it might have sounded. It won Vaughan a Grammy.\n\nSarah Vaughan at 100 – A playlist\n\nSarah Vaughan with Miles Davis, Roy Haynes, Clifford Brown, Richard Davis, Oscar Peterson, and others."
