        "text": "By Elaine M. Hayes\n\n(Ecco, 419 pp, $27.99)\n\nSarah Vaughan had the sort of voice that compels you to listen.\n\nConsider how rare that is. We listen to music while driving, cooking or cleaning. We use it as motivation to exercise and background to work. But with the magic that was Sarah Vaughan, other activities fall by the wayside. Her honeyed voice commands all attention while it embraces your soul.\n\nIf that sounds hyperbolic, you may be unfamiliar with the extraordinary Vaughan, known as \"The Divine One.\" Go online and listen. It's not the best way to experience her amazing talent but the point is to listen because she had a voice like no other and could sing anything. In fact, she bristled at being pigeonholed as a jazz singer.\n\n\" 'I'm not a jazz singer. I'm a singer,' she insisted during an interview with the jazz publication Down Beat in 1982, reiterating a stance she first took in 1960. 'I don't know why people call me a jazz singer, though I guess people associate me with jazz because I was raised in it from way back. I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer.\"\n\nThis quote comes early in this exhaustive biography. It's clear that author Elaine M. Hayes is a huge fan and an extremely thorough researcher. By the end, readers will have a full understanding of Vaughan.\n\nBut making it through is neither fun nor easy. Though I love biographies and respect pure scholarship, much of this tome is wooden and dull.\n\nHayes does Vaughan justice in explaining her life. Vaughn's parents raised their only child with love on Brunswick Street in Newark. Mount Zion Baptist Church was the cornerstone of a warm family life, where music was central.\n\nThough Vaughan's promise wasn't as apparent in church, once that voice let loose in Newark nightclubs and later New York City hot spots, audiences were seduced. And her career was off. Making it as a singer, as a black woman, beginning in the 1940s was extraordinarily tough.\n\nHayes places Vaughan contextually, explaining how she was born in 1924, four years before Newark airport was built and when the city was a draw for Southern blacks. Between 1915 and 1930, she cites the city's black population nearly quadrupled. Hayes recounts the hideous racism black bands faced on the road.\n\nThough Vaughan spent much of her life on the road, she bought a house in Englewood with her second husband. That house and her finances took a walloping when he mismanaged her money.\n\nThe book shows a photo of the couple in front of their house, Vaughan pushing the stroller with their newly adopted baby girl. Even the photos are disappointing, considering how well her life was documented and how few pictures are reprinted here, some just a different shot from the same event.\n\nIf you're already a fan of Sassy Sarah Vaughan, there could be material in here that you were unaware of as it as it recounts various tours and traces her questionable taste in men. Much as some men took advantage of her, Vaughan was fiercely strong and lived life on her terms.\n\nThe best parts of the book are the liberal quotes from sources including President Lyndon Johnson, who danced with Vaughan after her 1965 White House performance.\n\nWith Down Beat as the source, Hayes quotes: \"When I danced with Mr. Johnson, I was so tense and stiff that he sort of shook me and asked what the matter was. I explained that I was nervous and he said, 'Put your head on my shoulder and forget about it.' I just about died.\"\n\nAnother great quote has Frank Sinatra offering to break the legs of one of her deadbeat husbands. So there are fun spots in this book and it's clear Hayes knows a lot about music, but tangents about the differences between the organ and the piano and explanations of Pygmalion don't add much to Vaughan's story."
