        "text": "Her style was formed by her early association with be-bop, singing with Billy Eckstine, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie in the Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine bands in the 1940s. With her deep, sultry voice and dramatic colorings, she was regarded as a distinguished jazz singer from the beginning of her career.\n\nBorn in Newark on March 27, 1924, Miss Vaughan studied piano from age 7 and was a church choir member and organist by 12. Her father, a carpenter, played guitar and her mother sang in the church choir.\n\nIn 1942, she accepted a dare -- trumpeter-trombonist Jabbo Smith claimed it was his idea -- and sang \"Body and Soul\" at an Apollo Theater amateur contest in Harlem. Eckstine heard her and recommended her to Hines as second pianist and co-vocalist with himself. She made her debut with the Hines band in 1943, at the Apollo.\n\nShe went with Eckstine after he left Hines a year later to form his own big band, then sang with John Kirby's group. By 1946 she had established herself as a solo artist. In 1949, she was paid $2,500 for a week at the Apollo.\n\nMiss Vaughan's voice, over which she had phenomenal control, had lovely tone, was flexible and true in pitch. And she had a mastery of scat singing, improvising, swinging and phrasing. She once told an interviewer that horns influenced her more than other singers, which was evident from her harmonic and rhythmic sense. A ceaseless innovator, she added that she never sang a song the same way twice.\n\nHer nicknames were \"The Divine One,\" \"The Divine Sarah\" and \"Sassy.\" Often, after she introduced the musicians accompanying her, she coyly introduced herself as \"Della Reese.\"\n\nDetractors were irked that some of her record hits, such as \"BrokenHearted Melody\" in 1958 and, much more recently, \"Send in the Clowns,\" were pop instead of jazz, and some said that she sacrificed emotional depth and textual meaning to aural gymnastics such as swoops through her register and embellishments. Lyrics were never as important to her as music.\n\nNearly all listeners felt that her voice improved with time. Her contralto register became richer, her middle register remained warm and lyrical, her top true and pure. Her range was two and a half to three octaves and sounded like more.\n\nCritics have said that her voice could have been trained for opera. John Wilson wrote in The New York Times in 1957, \"She has what may well be the finest voice ever applied to jazz.\"\n\nMiss Vaughan's first record was for Continental Records in 1944. By 1947, she had a number of popular tunes out. Her version of \"The Lord's Prayer\" on Musicraft in the 1940s was praised by Marian Anderson.\n\nSongs she recorded include \"You're Blase,\" \"If You Could See Me Now,\" \"I Cover the Waterfront,\" \"Body and Soul,\" \"Tenderly,\" \"Everything I Have Is Yours,\" \"I'll Remember April,\" \"Easy Living,\" \"I Remember Clifford,\" \"Here's That Rainy Day,\" \"Misty\" and \"Don't Blame Me.\" She recorded \"Lover Man\" in 1945 with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. \"Broken-Hearted Melody\" was in 1958. \"Perdido\" was with the Basie Band.\n\nHer first hit record was \"It's Magic\" in 1947.\n\nMiss Vaughan won Esquire's new star award in 1947 and the Down Beat poll as best female jazz vocalist from 1947 through 1952. She won one Grammy for best vocal jazz performance, female, for \"Gershwin, Live!\" in 1982.\n\nHer first husband was trumpeter George Treadwell. She also was married to professional football player Clyde Atkins, Las Vegas restaurateur Marshall Fisher and trumpeter Waymon Reed.\n\nShe is survived by a daughter, Paris Deborah."
