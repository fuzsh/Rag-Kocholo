        "text": "A week from today, on Wednesday, March 27, 2024, the music world will mark the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of legendary jazz vocalist, Sarah Vaughan. Nicknamed “Sassy” by pianist John Malachi and, later, “The Divine One,” Vaughan left us an artistic legacy that has reverberated throughout the history of jazz.\n\nFrom Newark, New Jersey to a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award\n\nBorn in Newark, New Jersey, Vaughan began her musical journey at the age of 7, taking piano lessons and singing in the church choir. Performing in her teens at The Piccadilly near Newark Airport, she soon dropped out of high school. Singing “Body and Soul” at Amateur Night at the Apollo Theater, she won that competition in 1942. By November of that year, she opened for Ella Fitzgerald at that same venue. In 1943, she began touring with the Earl Hines big band, which served as a springboard for the pioneers of bebop. Its personnel included such luminaries as vocalist Billy Eckstine, trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and saxophonist Charlie Parker. By 1945, Vaughan launched a solo career, frequenting jazz clubs on New York’s 52nd Street. Recording contracts followed, as did a few pop hits in 1947–1948, with such songs as “Tenderly,” “It’s Magic,” and “Nature Boy.”\n\nIn those early years, much like others of her generation, Vaughan faced the ugliness of prejudice. In a 1961 DownBeat magazine interview, Vaughan told Barbara Gardner: “I often wished I was a medium-brown skin color. … I imagined people that color were regarded more highly than I. To most persons who knew me, I thought, I was just another little black girl for whom the future was just as dark as it was for thousands of others like me.” She recalled that when she was introduced to a Chicago audience by disc jockey Dave Garroway in the early 1950s, she was greeted by tomatoes thrown at her head by a few young bigots sitting in the balcony. Her first thought was that she’d been shot, when she “saw red stains spreading down her white dress.” Frightened, confused, and humiliated, Vaughan huddled in the wings off-stage. Garroway was so incensed that he gave an impassioned speech against racism. Gardner writes:\n\nFrom the audience came thunderous applause for the singer, and a demand that she return. She went back to the microphone in tears, and looked out into what she felt was the last audience she would ever face. She tried to sing. She could not utter a sound. After several futile starts, she left the stage, positive she would never sing again. But so sympathetic was public response to the incident, and so immediate, that she was persuaded not to give up her career.\n\nIt was Dave Garroway who dubbed her “The Divine One.”\n\nIn the decades that followed, she engaged in nonstop touring and received critical recognition in magazines such as Esquire, DownBeat, and Metronome. She made banner recordings with her trio and with large ensembles arranged and conducted by the likes of Billy May, Don Costa, Quincy Jones, and Gerald Wilson. Her sublime 1972 recordings with composer and arranger Michel Legrand, who conducted a wondrous orchestra of a hundred musicians, is among my all-time favorites. Her exquisite Brazilian sessions in the late 1970s and 1980s were such standouts that Tom Moon declared her “arguably, the foremost interpreter of Brazilian music in jazz history.” And when she wasn’t vocally caressing the timeless classics of Antonio Carlos Jobim and Milton Nascimento, she continued to provide fresh takes on the Great American Songbook with the cream of the jazz crop on such albums as “How Long Has This Been Going On?” (1978), featuring pianist Oscar Peterson, guitarist Joe Pass, bassist Ray Brown, and drummer Louis Bellson. In the same year of that album’s release, Vaughan received an Honorary Doctorate in Music from Berklee College of Music. Throughout her storied career, she was the recipient of a Grammy Award (out of nine nominations) as well as a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nA Legacy of Musical Artistry\n\nDubbed the “Queen of Bebop” by Elaine Hayes, Vaughan’s stylings defied any such categorization. She had an incomparable 4-octave vocal range, which could be operatic at times, while providing a depth of texture, control, and flexible whimsy over which other musicians marveled. Jazz instrumentalists — from horn legend Dizzy Gillespie to the great pianist Chick Corea — respected her as one of their own. Way back in the 1940s, when she joined the Earl Hines big band, Gillespie was so impressed by her vocal prowess that he viewed her “as good a musician as anybody” in the group. And Corea, who led Vaughan’s trio for a year, said that “working with Sarah was like getting to work with Miles [Davis]. Her music was so beautiful … [she] was the ultimate solo singer, but she encouraged interaction between me and her. I really learned from her.”\n\nHer vocal contemporaries were second to none in their appreciation of her talent. Frank Sinatra said of her extraordinary artistry, “when I listen to her I want to cut my wrists with a dull razor.” Mel Torme praised her for having “the single best vocal instrument of any singer working in the popular field,” while Ella Fitzgerald called her the world’s “greatest singing talent.”\n\nAmong music critics, John S. Wilson believed she had “what may well be the finest voice ever applied to jazz.” And for Gary Giddins, Vaughan was\n\nas fine an interpreter of the standard pop-song repertory as we have had and almost certainly the most self-possessed. Her control of timbre, articulation, and dynamics were matched by infallible pitch; the rare ability to improvise harmonically, melodically, and rhythmically; and an unfettered imagination that made it all count for something. She was a full partner in the germination of modern jazz. But no matter how closely we dissect the particulars of her talent, marveling at her range and energy and intelligence, transcribing and analyzing her performances, tracing her development over time, we must inevitably end up contemplating in silent awe the most phenomenal of her attributes, the one she was handed at birth: a voice that happens once in a lifetime, perhaps once in several lifetimes.\n\nVaughan influenced a generation of singers from Anita Baker to Rickie Lee Jones. In the wake of her death at the age of 66 on April 3, 1990, two of her biggest fans, jazz vocalists Carmen McRae and Dianne Reeves, recorded poignant albums in tribute to her impact.\n\nMy YouTube Tribute to Sassy\n\nI have loved Sarah Vaughan for almost as many years as I have loved music. Since 2004, when “My Favorite Songs” series began, I have posted over 50 songs in which Sarah Vaughan was the featured vocalist. I never had the honor of seeing her in person, but I saw her in so many live performances on television and fell in love with her immense talent, staggering virtuosity, and creative playfulness, whether she was singing with the Boston Pops Orchestra or on the Merv Griffin Show with Mel Torme [YouTube links]. When I was 14 years old, I made an audio cassette recording of her on the PBS show, “In Performance at Wolf Trap.” That concert, which aired on October 28, 1974, has only been seen in various snippets on YouTube (H/T The Jazz Archives). It hasn’t been seen or heard in its entirety in nearly fifty years. From her effortless modulations in “Someone to Watch Over Me” to her scintillating scatting in “Scattin’ the Blues,” Vaughan provides us with a treasure trove of material here, delivered with charming musicality. Though I do not have the video of this performance, I have created a collage of Vaughan memorabilia to accent the audio recording of this wonderful concert. In honor of The Sassy Centennial, that video debuts on my YouTube channel here."
