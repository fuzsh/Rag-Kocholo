The double album now emphatically draws attention to the two concerts of the same day and joins Ella Fitzgerald's \"Lost Berlin Tapes\", which we presented in JP 11/2020, almost sensationally. Truly a find!\n\nJazzpodium , 28-9-2021\n\ngreat vocal display of power\n\nJazzism, 12-9-2021\n\n... Her interpretations of a classical program with some borrowings from the taste of the day are convincing due to the sovereignty with which the singer appropriated the material, as if it had been written on her body...\n\nJazz' n More CD Tipp, 01-9-2021\n\n... Unforgettable... where she dives into the songs of the Great American Songbook with the whole variety of her voice...\n\nMedienhaus Bauer, 25-6-2021\n\n... Surrounded by the elegance of her stirring trio, without mannerisms, still as virtuosic as ever, developing her vocal technique at the highest level throughout her incredible range, between naturalness and sophistication, simplicity and refinement...\n\nsk.jazz.sk, 10-6-2021\n\n... If Billie Holiday was a whiskey that makes the tongue heavy, and Ella Fitzgerald a sparkling champagne, then the third in the alliance of the greatest jazz voices on November 9, 1969 was an extremely exquisite red wine: aged darkened, full of aromas and with a long reverberating finish...\n\nRondo, 22-5-2021\n\n... She succeeded particularly impressively in the interpretations of wonderful ballads, but also the up - tempo pieces of the concert performance convinced the audience...\n\nRadio Dreyeckland, 16-5-2021\n\n... Goosebumps are such songs as \"My Funny Valentine\", where the vocal range plays an essential role in the drama of the song. Such moments are equally found on the recordings of the second CD, for example, the interpretation of \"Fly Me To The Moon\" is incredibly touching. Ultimately, this release has what it takes to be mentioned in the same breath as such live classics as \"At Mister Kelly's\" (1957) or \"Sassy Swings the Tivoli\" (1963).\n\nMusikansich, 30-4-2021\n\n... The clarity of the high notes, her wonderful, always appropriate vocal shadings, the refined stretching of the melodic arches, her soulful sense of time (with her it would be better to write of a sense of swing) - there seems to be nothing vocally that she does not master. And yet one never has the feeling that her vocal virtuosity, her vocal possibilities, become an end in themselves. Her individual devotion, her obvious passion is much too present for that...\n\nkultkomplott, 26-4-2021"
