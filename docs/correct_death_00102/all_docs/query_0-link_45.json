        "text": "One of the most asked questions I hear from my Podetize clients is, “How do you create money-making opportunities through your podcast?” Everyone wants to know how to monetize without first breaking the bank. And I don’t blame them. Every time I launch something new, my goal is to spend the least amount possible until I see, without a doubt, there is long-term potential and sustainability in what I’m building.\n\nWith all the time Chuck Cramer had on his hands during the pandemic, as businesses everywhere slowed down, he started thinking about launching a podcast. Chuck, a California native living in London, knew if he were to launch a show, he would want to make money for his time spent — and we all know how much time podcasting can actually eat up — so he set his sights on having fun while getting paid.\n\nThe show, aptly titled, takes you On The Road, on a wine journey no less and covers the hottest topics in California and makes you wish you were right alongside the host in his adventures into California wine and business.\n\nShow, Don’t Tell\n\nIf you want to host a show that makes money, you have to be really engaging and your show has to create an experience. California has a vibe to it and you really fall into that when you listen to Chuck’s episodes. I get the sense that he’s in a convertible, driving up the coast, watching for a hillside winery where he’ll undoubtedly talk to someone really cool and include me in the conversation.\n\nChuck is amazing at painting a picture, the sights, the sounds, the weather, the wine… and it is subversive in the sense that you easily forget where you are as you listen. What I see (and hear) from plenty of hosts is this fear to really dig into a story and get into it, but that is necessary to the success of a show, and the differentiator between making money or pod-fading.\n\n“Businesses slowed down over here in Europe and the UK. I thought, “What can I do with my time?” I sell California wine and I was really taken by the idea of starting a show. I love talking about California and was doing that anytime I could with anyone that would listen so it made sense. I think that passion lends to a great business model. I am staying connected to my network, giving them visibility, supporting and empowering my business, and having so much fun doing it.”\n\nNever Stop Growing Your Network\n\nThe saying, “It’s all about who you know, not what you know” exists for a reason. An expansive network, that is relevant to your industry, work or show is the best way to monetize anything you are trying to do. The more you know, the more you grow.\n\nTips from Chuck: Lean on your current network. After each interview, I email with a recap and ask for an introduction if they mentioned someone during the show. I’ll ask them to set it up for me, I ask them for references, I ask them if there’s anyone they know that I should know. These asks are very valuable because I’m gaining access to people and audiences I didn’t have access to until that moment.\n\nChuck’s Best Binge Factor Advice:\n\n“Do your homework. The Binge Factor and Feed Your Brand were so helpful during my startup. Pat Flynn was very helpful in terms of which equipment to buy and how to put together a timeline to set this up. My podcast is very narrow. It’s talking about California wine. I’m not talking about wine from all over the world. Find something you’re passionate about and do it. Invest a little money in the right audio equipment, try and find a quiet time or place to do it. Don’t hesitate. You’re going to make mistakes, but you get better like anything else as you keep doing it.”\n\nBingeability Increase\n\nWhenever I have a guest on my show, one thing I love to offer is advice on how they can improve what they’re doing and grow as a host. For Chuck, every time I listen to an episode, I want to see where he is and who he is talking to. Because I find myself Googling those exact details when my curiosity gets the best of me. I want to see what it looks like and experience what he is. I encourage hosts to do the most with their content by recording audio and video at the same time and then they’ve got so much to work with and so much to offer to their audience.\n\nFor my wine lovers: “We’ve got some great winemakers that I work with. If you can walk into your local grocer and grab a bottle of The Federalist, you won’t be disappointed. It has great imaging, great packaging, and great storytelling. It’s all about the United States but the quality is wonderful too.”\n\nChuck did something very smart — he’s got a large audience, he’s got plenty of distributors and small businesses to highlight, there is no shortage of product, the quality of the show is fantastic, and the opportunities to monetize seem endless. Whether he gets large sponsors, tourism board support, partnerships with wineries, featuring his own wines, offering paid spots… every host should be thinking about how they can expand into these alternative monetization opportunities.\n\nBinge Factor: He’s set the tone for the show, there’s a ton of excitement, the audio quality is top-notch, the storytelling brings you right into the experience and you feel like you’re there or you really want to be. Bingeability is about creating an experience."
