        "text": "\"There is a lot to like in this show. A few classics are superbly arranged and performed - Shake Down Street, US Blues, Rider (maybe best version I’ve heard this crew perform). There is an excellent opportunity to hear John’s bluesy approach to the Dead in Brown Eyed Women and Don’t Ease Me In. For me the stand out is Warf Rat. Generally I’m not a big fan of this song, but John’s feel in combo with Wier is near perfect. Mayer really shines here and his live sound will be missed when they hang it up. We all need to offer our thanks to his relentless focus to maintain and deliver the essence of The GD during his years touring with them. It’s both a testament to Jerry and to the songs that even the most strident fans have come to love Mayer in the Jerry’s impossible to fill role. Many have tried, only one has succeeded. Mayer! \"\n\n\"I've seen the Grateful Dead hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times!!! I have been truly blessed!!! The Arizona show and the three San Francisco shows were spectacular!!! Right up there, with the very best, of any Dead show I have ever seen!!! I could feel Jerry there all 3 nights in San Francisco!!! All I can say, is WOW!!! I am Forever Grateful and Totally Deadicated!!! Always have been!!! \"Thank You, for a Real Good Time!!!\" (~);} The 1st persons description of the Final Shows was spot on!!! I couldn't have said it better myself, so thank you for that!!! ??????????????????????\"\n\n\"All three shows are ridiculously good individually and as a whole weekend. I was fortunate to see all three shows in person and it was the best live music experience I have had and I had some great ones. This first night felt like it should have been the last night because it was highly aware of this being the final stop The tribute to members of the band that we lost over the years during Knocking on Heavens Door gave folks all the feels. . It was almost like they wanted to get past the obvious emotion behind this last tour so we can let go and simply celebrate and boogie. . I want to say that I was moved by the Drums/Space time with the tribute to the Golden Gate Bridge. The Dead has such a spiritual connection to San Francisco and Marin and the Bridge has just celebrated its 75th Birthday (Mickey participated in the celebration) . I was very aware of the sense of place and how it is connected to the history of the Dead. Oracle Park has a deep relationship with the Dead. Everywhere else in the American West seemed to be in a heat wave, but somehow the San Francisco fog kept things cool in the stadium. When the sun set we got our jackets on. It was as if the tendrils of fog were welcoming the boys home and was celebrating with us. While it might be the slower and more contemplative of the three shows, there was/is plenty to rock, dance, and groove to. It was magical singing along with 41k deadheads. Having been to previous concerts in 22 and 19 it is clear this band was on fire and tight. I remember thinking they were at this entirely new level and the next two nights were going to be epic. (Spoiler: They were absolutely epic) \"\n\n\"This show was a beauty from start to finish, they were having a blast playing this one. John was on fire all night, Bobby was dialed and Oteil has quickly become one of my favorites, Fire ?? on the mtn was to die for. SO MANY of the classic hoppin ones. A China--->Rider & a Scarlet--->Fire. I caught 2 in the Gorge and the 3 in SF / this was my favorite. To end with knockin on heaven's Door while flashin all those members who have passed to soon..... with a teer in my eye, put a pin in me - I couldn't have asked for anything more from an ensemble that is hanging it up at their peak of groove!\"\n\n\"First time I ever heard them open up with Not Fade Away, (well, Grateful Dead, anyway)! All us Deadheads knew how the shows were going to end! A Smoken' Shakedown! Jammin' Cold Rain and Snow, into a Beautiful Ramble on Rose, that definitely took us to the Leader of the Band! I can always listen to the Dead (either of them) Dominate the Rap Jack!!! I don't think (but, who am I?),that the Magical Wharf Rat should be in the 1st set...??. Don't Ease Me In was so good and so appropriate (I won't bore you with the details...?? Then!!! The second set opens with, one of the best, rocking China Cat Sunflowers I've ever heard (and I've heard quite a few!), that led into a Magnificent, tear jerking, I know You Rider! Then, they slide in a heart wrenching He's Gone, nonetheless, wonderful! Thanks guys, for the Smoking Scarlet/Fire!!! Drums and Space have never been better!!! I was hoping Dark Star was coming, but the D S/Big River, was well done!!! Standing On The Moon reminds me so much of Jerry, however, Bobby seams to be the Master of it!!! (Sorry Jer)?? Casey Jones and U.S. Blues rocked out, as expected!!! The clincher was Knockin' on Heaven's Door! Not only was it sung and played to perfection, but when they started showing pictures of the family members who have departed this earth, starting with the crew, to Bill Graham (where I started) to Pig Pen, Keith, Vince, Brent and of course the creme de la creme, Jerry, there wasn't a dry eye in the house! I won't even try to explain the PHENOMENAL light show!!! Words wouldn't do it Justice!!! Amazing!!! (~);} ??????????????????????????\"\n\n\"Wow, I saw the band less than a year ago, and I am really shocked at how much Bobby has slipped.. Thank the stars that John, Otiel and Jeff were there to help him when he forgot the lyrics, started going off key, (we all know he was never a strong vocalist anyway), I know we are getting older and slower, but this just showed me that maybe it's time Bobby retired and spend time with his family, spend some of the money he has made over the decades. I realize people are gonna hate me for this. But I can't be the only one thinking this.\""
