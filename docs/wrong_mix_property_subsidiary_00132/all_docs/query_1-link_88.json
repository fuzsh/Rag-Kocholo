        "text": "A tribute to Mary Wollstonecraft\n\nMary Wollstonecraft is widely considered to be one of the pioneers of modern feminism.\n\nIn November 2020 ‘A Sculpture for Mary Wollstonecraft’ was unveiled on Newington Green, north London, opposite the Unitarian Church that she attended. It’s fair to say that the design, by artist Maggi Hambling, caused a certain amount of discussion and controversy.\n\nAt LMA we have records of her baptism (20 May 1759 at St Botolph, Bishopsgate), her (‘unconventional’) marriage to 'the father of anarchism' William Godwin (29 March 1797 at St Pancras), and her burial (15 September 1797 at St Pancras).\n\nShe died days after the birth of her second daughter Mary, who is probably best known now as the writer of ‘Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus’ published in 1818. We have her marriage to the great poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (at St Mildred Bread Street on 30 December 1816).\n\nWestminster Bridge Road – where the modern British circus was born\n\nOn his discharge from the army in 1766, cavalryman Philip Astley moved to London where he presented feats on horseback on a roped-off piece of land near Westminster Bridge. With large numbers of cavalrymen returning to England, Astley had his pick of skilled performers, and he saw an opportunity to create something unique. The secret to Astley's success was bringing a wide array of professional performers - clowns, acrobats and jugglers found in fairs and marketplaces - within a circular ring. In doing so, he laid the foundations for the circus as we know it today.\n\nTwo years after his first performance, Astley swapped his roped-off piece of land for a 42-foot arena, housed in an increasingly elaborate amphitheatre on a triangle of ground between Westminster Bridge Road, Lambeth Palace Road and Stangate. Numerous amphitheatres were opened across Europe, all with horse acts as their driving force, but incorporating other types of entertainment, including dog acts, rope walking, juggling and acrobatics, all with musical accompaniment. Edward Brayley described the amphitheatre in his 1826 work “Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Theatres of London”: ‘The stage, which is probably the largest and most convenient in London, is provided with immense platforms, or floors, rising above each other.’ Nothing now remains of Astley's London amphitheatre, which was demolished in the 1890s.\n\nProfessor Leith Davis at Simon Fraser University, British Colombia, Canada has created a searchable database of newspaper advertisements listing the featured acts at Astley’s from 1768-1833 held at the British Library. Visit the project website for more information.\n\nLouisa Aldrich-Blake pioneer\n\nDame Louisa Brandreth Aldrich-Blake was born in 1865, the daughter of the rector of Chingford, Essex. From an early age, she showed a natural gift for healing; when eight years old she organised an animal hospital and friends brought their sick and wounded pets for Louisa's attention. Her family was well-connected, and she need not have worked for a living, but she decided to enter the demanding world of medicine.\n\nGraduating from the London School of Medicine for Women in 1893, she went on to take the University of London's higher degrees in Medicine and Surgery, becoming the first woman to obtain the degree of Master of Surgery. Throughout her career, Louisa Aldrich-Blake was associated with the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, becoming a surgeon in 1910. At the Royal Free Hospital, she was the first woman to hold the post of surgical registrar and also acted as an anaesthetist. During the years of the First World War, many of the male surgical staff of the Royal Free went on foreign active service and Louisa took increased responsibility for the surgery, becoming consulting surgeon to the hospital. Louisa was a bold, meticulous and very successful surgeon, with great management and diagnostic skill. She was the first in Britain to perform operations for cancer of the cervix and rectum. Louisa Aldrich-Blake became Dean of the London (Royal Free Hospital) School of Medicine for Women in 1914, and exercised an important influence on generations of women medical students. The climax of her career came in 1924 when, in the jubilee year of the medical school, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She died in 1925 and is remembered as a brilliant surgeon and wise administrator.\n\nWe hold some records relating to her under collection reference H72/LAB. The records consist of photographs of Aldrich-Blake, mostly from her time as Dean, and material relating to her funeral and memorial statue in Tavistock Square Gardens, London. Under reference H71/RF/B/02/02 we also hold some records described as \"Miss Louisa Aldrich Blake's Patient Case Note Books\" covering 1917-20.\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E. at LMA\n\nACC/3816/04/02/215 at LMA is an album of photographs from the Hampstead Garden Suburb Play and Pageant Union. It includes two photographs of David McCallum, known as Keith here, in the role of Oberon, King of the Fairies in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” in 1950 when he was just 17 years old. He later starred as Ilya Kuryakin in the TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E."
