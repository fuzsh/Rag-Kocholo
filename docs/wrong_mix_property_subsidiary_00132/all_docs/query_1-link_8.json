        "text": "Oracle CEO Mark Hurd has died. He was 62.\n\nThe company on Friday confirmed his death. Hurd was on medical leave, and the company did not disclose a cause of death.\n\nHurd led two high-profile Silicon Valley companies - Oracle and computer maker Hewlett-Packard.\n\nHe took a leave of absence from Oracle a month ago for health reasons. Larry Ellison, Oracle's founder and chairman, said at the time that he and co-CEO Safra Catz would take over his responsibilities.\n\nEllison says he will miss his close and irreplaceable friend.\n\nHurd joined Oracle as co-president in 2010 a month after leaving HP. He resigned from HP after accusations of sexual harassment by a female contract worker and findings of inaccurate expense reports connected to outings with the contractor.\n\nRead Ellison's full announcement below:"
