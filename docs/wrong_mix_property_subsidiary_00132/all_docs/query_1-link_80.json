        "text": "Transcript\n\nDelphi in central Greece - this was the ancient world's most famous place of prophecies and home of the Oracle of Delphi. For centuries, people made pilgrimages here, in the hopes of finding out what the future had in store. Even emperors and kings would send their delegates. Those who came here believed that oracle Pythia spoke the exact words of the god Apollo himself. Indeed, the prophecies of the priestess were highly influential, deciding the fate of war and peace, and of life and death.\n\nThe oracle's temple gradually wasted away over the course of many centuries. But the ancient artifacts found here give us an idea of just how large the site once was. The archaeological site of Delphi slopes down across an altitude difference of 300 meters. This breathtaking landscape setting is one of the reasons it is so attractive to tourists. The Temple of Apollo is where the prophecies were spoken. Some of the original 38 Doric columns now stand vertically once again. The excavated ruins at Delphi are a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
