Total quarterly revenues were up 7% year-over-year in both USD and constant currency to $13.3 billion. Cloud services and license support revenues were up 12% in USD and up 11% in constant currency to $10.0 billion. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues were down 3% in both USD and constant currency to $1.3 billion.\n\nQ3 GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.8 billion, up 12% in both USD and constant currency. GAAP operating margin was 28%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 44%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion. Non-GAAP net income was $4.0 billion, up 18% in both USD and constant currency. Q3 GAAP earnings per share was $0.85 while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.41, up 16% in both USD and constant currency.\n\nShort-term deferred revenues were $8.9 billion. Over the last twelve months, operating cash flow was $18.2 billion and free cash flow was $12.3 billion.\n\n\"Large new cloud infrastructure contracts signed in Q3 drove Oracle's total Remaining Performance Obligations up 29% to over $80 billion—an all-time record,\" said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. \"We expect to continue receiving large contracts reserving cloud infrastructure capacity because the demand for our Gen2 AI infrastructure substantially exceeds supply—despite the fact we are opening new and expanding existing cloud datacenters very, very rapidly. We expect that 43% of our current $80 billion of Remaining Performance Obligations will be recognized as revenue over the next four quarters, and that our Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure business will remain in a hypergrowth phase—up 53% in Q3—for the foreseeable future.\"\n\n\"In Q3, Oracle finished moving the majority of Cerner customers to Oracle's Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure,\" said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. \"In Q4, Oracle will start delivering its completely new Ambulatory Clinic Cloud Application Suite to these same customers. This new AI-driven system features an integrated voice interface called the Clinical Digital Assistant that automatically generates doctors' notes and updates Electronic Health Records—saving precious time and improving health data accuracy. The delivery of this revolutionary new healthcare technology will enable the rapid modernization of our customers' health systems over the coming year, and transform Cerner and Oracle Health into a high-growth business for years to come.\"\n\nThe board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 10, 2024, with a payment date of April 24, 2024.\n\nA sample list of customers which purchased Oracle Cloud services during the quarter will be available at www.oracle.com/customers/earnings/.\n\nA list of recent technical innovations and announcements is available at www.oracle.com/news/.\n\nTo learn what industry analysts have been saying about Oracle's products and services see www.oracle.com/corporate/analyst-reports/.\n\nEarnings Conference Call and Webcast\n\nOracle will hold a conference call and webcast today to discuss these results at 4:00 p.m. Central.

Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:\n\nStock-based compensation expenses: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.\n\nAmortization of intangible assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.\n\nAcquisition related and other expenses; and restructuring expenses: We have excluded the effect of acquisition related and other expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. We incurred expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition related and other expenses consisted of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net. Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance and other exit costs. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. Although acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses may diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives, we generally will incur certain of these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives.\n\nSOURCE Oracle Corporation"
