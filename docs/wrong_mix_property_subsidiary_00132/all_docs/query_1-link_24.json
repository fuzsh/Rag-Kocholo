        "text": "Oracle CEO Mark Hurd has died, the technology company said Friday. He was 62.\n\nHurd was on medical leave, and the company did not disclose a cause of death in an announcement by Oracle founder and chairman Larry Ellison.\n\nHurd led two high-profile Silicon Valley companies, Oracle and computer maker Hewlett-Packard. He took a leave of absence from Oracle a month ago for health reasons. Ellison said at the time that he and co-CEO Safra Catz would take over his responsibilities.\n\nEllison said he will miss his \"close and irreplaceable friend.\"\n\nHurd joined Oracle as co-president in 2010 a month after leaving HP."
