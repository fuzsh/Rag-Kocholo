Oracle CEO Mark Hurd has died, the technology company said Friday. He was 62.

Hurd was on medical leave, and the company did not disclose a cause of death in an announcement by Oracle founder and chairman Larry Ellison.

Hurd led two high-profile Silicon Valley companies, Oracle and computer maker Hewlett-Packard. He took a leave of absence from Oracle a month ago for health reasons. Ellison said at the time that he and co-CEO Safra Catz would take over his responsibilities.

Ellison said he will miss his "close and irreplaceable friend."

Hurd joined Oracle as co-president in 2010 a month after leaving HP.
