Parallel Conglomerate was a subsidiary company of Rand Meachum Corporation,[3][verification needed] involved in oil business.[1]

After finding a treasure chest of valuables from an old Spanish brigantine, Namor informed Carrie Alexander that he would use the wealth to buy Parallel,[2] turning it into Oracle Incorporated[4][1] (sometimes described as Oracle buying out Parallel).[5][3] Namor intended the company to benefit Earth's environment and inform its surface dwellers of the consequences of their actions. amor granted the establishment to Caleb and Carrie Alexander, who later resigned.[citation needed]

Jim Hammond became Head of Security for the firm,[6] before rising to the rank of CEO and using the corporation to fund a new iteration of the Heroes for Hire, to fill the void left after Onslaught killed the Avengers.[7] In this role, Hammond briefly fell under the sway of the villain known as the Master before being rescued. However, when Oracle, Inc. was bought out by Stark-Fujikawa, Jim Hammond and the Heroes quit on moral grounds.[8]

The role of CEO fell to the cryptoantiquarian Nestor Zoltan, who used the company to sell arms to U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M., as part of a larger scheme.[9]

After the events of Secret Wars, the group known as Squadron Supreme killed Namor, and Nighthawk (Kyle Richmond) bought the company.
