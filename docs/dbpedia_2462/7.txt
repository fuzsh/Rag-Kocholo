HUNDREDS of Defence Force personnel who served in Afghanistan and the Middle East were saluted with a welcome home march through Perth and a commemorative service in Supreme Court Gardens

Simultaneous events were held in Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, Darwin, Townsville, Adelaide and in Canberra, where Prime Minister Tony Abbott laid a wreath and saluted troops and support staff involved in the effort, codenamed Operation Slipper.

The operation is Australia’s longest-running military engagement, launched in 2001 as a response to the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.

More than 34,500 Australian Defence Force personnel, Australian Federal Police and support staff were deployed to the Middle East.

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told the crowd of hundreds gathered in the Supreme Court Gardens that those who served in the operation were the “true heirs to the ANZAC legacy”.

He paid tribute to the 41 ADF personnel who died and 262 who suffered serious physical wounds.

“Operation Slipper has ended not with victory, not with defeat, but with the future of Afghanistan in the hands of its own people,” Senator Cormann said.

“Your mission is over, but our mission to stand with you and support you continues.”

Premier Colin Barnett said it was wonderful to see so many people line the Hay Street Mall.

“You should feel proud as servicemen and women for the way in which the people of this state and Australia have thanked and honoured you,” he said.

Navy Aircraft Controller and mother-of-two Narelle Stebhens completed two tours of Afghanistan and Iraq between 2001-2003.

Ms Stebhens said she was “floored” by the turnout at the service.

“We go over there and we say, ‘It’s our job and it’s what we have to do,’ but it’s nice when people come out and say well done,” she said.

“It does make a difference and it does matter to people.”
