It is not clear whether the troops were stalking a Taliban force or if they just pulled up by chance in the middle of a hornets’ nest. What is certain is that Darwin-based Sapper Jamie Larcombe and an Afghan interpreter, who were both on foot, were shot dead in the opening volleys of a contact with a determined enemy force that assaulted the Australian position with machineguns and rifles.\n\nAustralian soldier killed in Afghanistan, Media Release, MECC 76/11 , Department of Defence, 20 February 2011\n\nAn Australian Army combat engineer serving with Mentoring Task Force – Two (MTF-2), Sapper Jamie Larcombe, was killed in action during an engagement with insurgents in the Mirabad Valley region of Uruzgan Province overnight (Australia time). An Afghan local national employed as an interpreter was also killed in the exchange of fire. The Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, said Sapper Larcombe was 21 years old and from the Darwin-based 1st Combat Engineer Regiment. “Sapper Larcombe had just passed the third anniversary of his enlistment into the Army, which was on the 18th of February. In that time, Jamie had served on Operation Padang Assist and this was his first tour to Afghanistan,” Air Chief Marshal Houston said.Air Chief Marshal Houston said the soldiers were patrolling in area to the South East of Patrol Base Wali when they were engaged by an insurgent group. “Unfortunately both our soldier and his interpreter comrade were struck by gunshots in that engagement and despite immediate first aid were unable to be saved,” Air Chief Marshal Houston said. “A coalition helicopter was launched to evacuate the two men but on arrival at the Multinational Base – Tarin Kot medical facility they were declared deceased.\n\nCorporal Richard Atkinson, 2 February 2011\n\nYoung Digger Richard Edward Atkinson killed by bomb in Afghanistan, James Massol, Australian, 3 February 2011\n\nYoung Digger Richard Edward Atkinson killed by bomb in Afghanistan, James Massola, Australian, 3 February 2011\n\nAn Australian soldier serving with the mentoring taskforce in Afghanistan has been killed by an improvised explosive device that wounded one of his mates. West Australian Corporal Richard Edward Atkinson, 22, was killed by the blast in an area of Afghanistan that military chiefs today conceded had become “difficult” for Australian troops. The Darwin-based soldier, who was engaged to be married, was on his first tour in Afghanistan. His death brings to 22 the number of Australian soldiers killed there.\n\nActing Chief of the Defence Force David Hurley said the families of both men had been informed of the incident, and the family of the wounded soldier had asked that his name not be released. Lieutenant-General Hurley said both soldiers were flown by a US military team within an hour to the medical base at Tarin Kowt under difficult weather conditions, including rain, low cloud and a dust storm. “Both men are member of the Darwin-based first combat engineer regiment and were conducting a dismounted, partnered security patrol with the Afghan national army,” he said. The incident occurred at about 9.30am Afghan time yesterday in the Tangi Valley, the same area that 28-year-old Lance-Corporal Jared MacKinney was killed on August 24 last year while conducting a dismounted patrol in the area. Lieutenant-General Hurley said it was unclear whether the blast had been remotely detonated, but he conceded the area had become a “hot spot’’ for Australian soldiers.\n\nLance-Corporal Jared MacKinney, 24 August 2010\n\nDeath creates new doubt over Afghan mission, Dan Oakes and Tom Hyland, SMH, 2010-08-26\n\nLance-Corporal Jared MacKinney became the 21st Australian soldier to be killed in Afghanistan when a firefight broke out while he was on patrol with Afghan troops in the southern province of Oruzgan.\n\nAustralian soldier killed in Taliban firefight, Defence News, Department of Defence, 25 August 2010\n\nA 28-year-old Lance Corporal serving with the Mentoring Task Force in Afghanistan has been killed in action following an intense firefight with Taliban insurgents.

The soldier leaves behind a wife and young family. The soldier, a member of the 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, was conducting a dismounted partner patrol with the Afghan National Army in the green zone of the Deh Rawud region when the engagement took place. He was an experienced soldier on his fourth operational deployment and his second tour of Afghanistan. The patrol remained in contact with the Taliban insurgents for almost three hours before withdrawing from the area. An International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) AH-64 Apache helicopter used its 30mm cannon while additional help was called from a precision-guided weapon to provide support during the engagement. No other Australian or Afghan soldiers were wounded in the firefight.\n\nPrivate Grant Walter Kirby, 20 August 2010\n\nVale Private Grant Walter Kirby, 20 August 2010\n\nPrivate Tomas James Dale, 20 August 2010\n\nVale Private Tomas James Dale, Department of Defence\n\nTwo more Australians killed in Afghanistan, 21 August 2010\n\nTwo Australian soldiers from the Brisbane-based 6th Battalion have tragically lost their lives when they were struck by an Improvised Explosive Device in Afghanistan.

Lieutenant General Hurley said the attack had taken the soldiers “by surprise”.??Defence Minister John Faulkner, speaking in Canberra, said the incident occurred yesterday when the “two fine” soldiers were lost. They are the 19th and 20th Australian soldiers to die in Afghanistan. Senator Faulkner described improvised explosive devices as “awful weapons that kill indiscriminantly soliders and civilians alike”. The weapons and tactics of the Taliban insurgency are vicious and insidious, said Senator Faulkner.\n\nTrooper Jason Thomas Brown, 13 August 2010\n\nPersonal details of Australian soldier killed in Afghanistan: Trooper Jason Thomas Brown, Media Release, Department of Defence, MSPA 350/10, 14 August 2010\n\n18th soldier killed in Afghanistan, Max Blenkin and Cathy Alexander, SMH, 14 August 2010\n\nTrooper Jason Thomas Brown, 29, a member of the Perth-based Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), died from multiple gunshot wounds when insurgents opened fire on his patrol.

The Australian Defence Force said he was killed in a gunfight in northern Kandahar, adjacent to Oruzgan and the focus of a major US-led operation. Trooper Brown is the fourth member of the special forces to die in Kandahar, where they have been operating since at least early June. Three commandos were killed in a helicopter crash in northern Kandahar on June 21. Days earlier, they had taken part in intense fighting, inflicting what the ADF said were heavy losses on the insurgents. The ADF said Trooper Brown, like the troops involved in the June fighting, was engaged in ‘‘disruption’’ operations.\n\n10 July 2010 – Private Nathan Bewes\n\nAustralian soldier killed in Afghanistan, Defence News, Department of Defence, 10 July 2010\n\nOne Australian soldier has been killed and another wounded following an Improvised Explosive Device attack in Afghanistan’s Chora Valley region. ??Private Nathan Bewes was 23 years old and leaves behind his loving parents, sister and partner, who are currently receiving support from Private Bewes’ unit 6RAR, and from the Defence Community Organisation.

One of the things that we’re doing, as part of the Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team activities, is patrolling in the areas that the Afghan National Army are holding. So we go out and we do patrolling. As they were patrolling they were engaged by the insurgents, and they returned fire, and that’s when the casualty occurred.\n\nAs the weather improves there will be more fighting.
