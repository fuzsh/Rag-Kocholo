        "text": "Mr Gary Oakley, national president of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Veterans and Services Association and Memorial Director Dr Brendan Nelson attend the unveiling of the newly-acquired Rover Thomas painting, Ruby Plains Massacre 1.\n\nInscribed with the words of John McRae’s famous poem In Flanders fields it is constructed from Portland stone, the same material used at the Menin Gate in Belgium. The garden contains soils from five key battle sites in Flanders and 20 sites of significant military heritage from each Australian state and territory, and features symbolic flowers such as the Flanders poppy.\n\nOther major commemorative events to occur this year include plaque dedications for the Dominion Yachtsmen Scheme, the Australian Army Training Team – Iraq, Z Special, the 50th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan and Vietnam Veterans Day: Stand-to service, and the 75th anniversary of Bomber Command.\n\nBeyond these major ceremonies, many visitors make the pilgrimage to the Memorial, often travelling to Canberra for the primary purpose of doing so. In the financial year 2016–17 some 1.1 million visitors made that trip and a further 5,614,989 visited our website to plan their trip, learn about our military history, or research the service of family members.\n\nThe Memorial’s volunteer education and visitor services teams continued to provide outstanding service to this ever-increasing audience. Our education program continued to engage with our younger generation, with 118,338 students attending on-site programs and a further 45,000 participating in our outreach programs.\n\nOur front of house staff also supported our other key activities including new and temporary exhibitions. Amongst the latter this financial year has been The deceiving eye which shows how Australian troops were educated in the use of camouflage in the Second World War. The exhibit features one of the most generous Cultural Gifts Programs donations given to the Memorial in a number of years – the eX de Medici work Cure for pain donated by Erika Krebs-Woodward.\n\nIn addition to sharing stories of service, it is also the responsibility of the Australian War Memorial to stimulate and challenge visitors, Australian and international, to see the world through the eyes of others. To this effect we proudly opened the Witnesses and survivors permanent exhibition on 30 November 2016 in our Second World War gallery.\n\nThrough the work of war artist Alan Moore and using the words, images, and artefacts of some of the survivors who later emigrated to Australia, this important exhibition tells the story of Australia’s connections to the Holocaust. Known as the Shoah to the Jewish community it was the worst genocide of the 20th century in which some six million people, mostly Jews, Roma, gypsies, the disabled and political prisoners, were ruthlessly exterminated by Nazi Germany, and it is time this story was told here where our national soul is revealed.\n\nThis year also saw the Memorial’s Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience (SACE) complete the final year of its threeand-a-half-year program. Over that time SACE, serving as the flagship of national commemoration and generously supported by the Federal Government, Commonwealth Bank, and Telstra, visited 23 locations, from capital cities to regional centres, and was experienced by 368,016 visitors. I wish to thank Brian Dawson, the SACE Project Executive Manager, and his team of Memorial staff for their outstanding efforts over this time. The success of this exhibition is largely due to their dedication and hard work.\n\nThe Memorial also produced a number of notable works in other mediums from Dr Karl James’s latest book, Double diamonds, a history of Australian commandos in the Pacific, to the documentary Afghanistan: the Australian story on DVD.\n\nOriginal research of this nature, based on rigorous historical study and conducted by leading experts on Australian military history, informs all of the Memorial’s public engagement programs and is an important part of how we engage with the community in its own right.\n\nOur National Collections branch has had another strong year, in addition to the acquisition of high profile artworks by artists such as Rover Thomas and eX de Medici, the branch has continued our highly successful Victoria Cross Centenary Project. Under this project the Memorial has been able to display 82 of the 100 Victoria Cross medals awarded to Australians in the Hall of Valour. We are grateful to the families, associations, museums, and other groups who have generously loaned medals to the Memorial for display during this period and enabled millions of Australians to see these important national icons.\n\nBehind the scenes our conservators and Military Heraldry and Technology teams have also accomplished some amazing feats this financial year, particularly in completing the four year restoration of the Memorial’s Lockheed Hudson Mark IV bomber.\n\nThe Hudson, one of the RAAF’s workhorse aircraft in the Second World War, performing roles as diverse as bomber, transport, and trainer, has been fully restored to wartime configuration and is on display at Canberra Airport until 2018. The support of Canberra Airport and Virgin Australia has been invaluable in making this possible and we are grateful to them for their generosity.\n\nMay 2017 saw the Memorial take a major step forward with a completely revamped website. The new site is much more accessible, especially on mobile devices, easier to use, and the systems behind it will support our long-term strategy of digitising our collections, including future projects such as 3D scanning of artefacts that we don’t have the space to display in the galleries. The website is supported by the excellent work of our social media team, who have connected and engaged with millions of people throughout the world through platforms such as Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter, enabling us to share stories of service and have stories shared with us in return.\n\nI would also like to highlight the Memorial’s new brand campaign – …for we are young and free. This campaign, produced by our Communications and Marketing team, acknowledges that we are still a young country, and one that is free in large part due to the sacrifice of the men and women honoured here.\n\nThe Memorial has carefully sought to manage its operations under sound financial management principles and practices, and to conduct its activities within the available funding. We continue to seek support from government and nongovernment sources and are grateful to those companies and individuals who have invested in the Memorial’s vision over this financial year.\n\nWe are particularly grateful to our generous supporters and partners, including BHP Billiton Sustainable Communities, Mr Kerry Stokes AC, Seven Group Holdings, the Seven Network, Boeing Australia, Qantas, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Thales Australia, Kingold, RSL Victoria, RSL Queensland, RSL New South Wales and Services Clubs, Virgin Australia, Canberra Airport and individual generous support from Steve and Ruth Lambert. I also thank the Commonwealth Government, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, and the Honourable Dan Tehan MP, Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, for their ongoing support.\n\nMy deep appreciation goes to Mr Kerry Stokes AC in his role as Chair of the Australian War Memorial Council. Mr Stokes has been very active in Memorial events and ceremonies, and his leadership and support to management is deeply appreciated. I thank him and all members of Council for their leadership, oversight, strategic direction, and guidance. I am also grateful to the partners and families of our Council who have supported them, including attending many Memorial events themselves, over this past year.\n\nAll that has been achieved this year would have been impossible without the hard work, enthusiasm, skills, and knowledge of the Memorial’s volunteers and staff. Their dedication in delivering higher numbers and a higher standard of service to our community this past year has been outstanding, and I thank them for their professionalism and personal engagement with the Memorial’s mission.\n\nThe leadership and support of my Assistant Directors – Leanne Patterson in Corporate Services, Tim Sullivan heading the National Collection branch, and Anne Bennie overseeing Public Programs – has been the final ingredient in making 2016–17 such a success. Their hard work and expertise has delivered extraordinary results this year and prepared us well for financial year 2017–18.\n\nWe have well-developed plans for the final period of the centenary of Anzac and for the Memorial’s long-term future, and hope to develop both throughout the next financial year.\n\nBrendan Nelson\n\nDirector\n\nCorporate Summary\n\nPURPOSE\n\nThe purpose of the Australian War Memorial is to commemorate the sacrifice of those Australians who have died in war or on operational service.\n\nMISSION\n\nThe mission of the Australian War Memorial is to assist Australians to remember, interpret, and understand the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on Australian society.\n\nVISION\n\nOur vision is for the Memorial to:\n\nplay the leading role in the nation’s commemoration of the Australian experience of war\n\nengage with people and communities to achieve our purpose\n\ncollaborate with a wide range of stakeholders and partners to create mutual long-term value\n\nbe a workplace that inspires integrity and excellence.\n\nVALUES\n\nThe Memorial is committed to the Australian Public Service (APS) values:\n\nImpartial\n\nThe APS is apolitical and provides the government with advice that is frank, honest, timely, and based on the best available evidence.\n\nCommitted to service\n\nThe APS is professional, objective, innovative, and efficient, and works collaboratively to achieve the best results for the Australian community and the government.\n\nAccountable\n\nThe APS is open and accountable to the Australian community under the law and within the framework of ministerial responsibility.\n\nRespectful\n\nThe APS respects all people, including their rights and their heritage.\n\nEthical\n\nThe APS demonstrates leadership, is trustworthy, and acts with integrity in all that it does.\n\nPLANNING AND REPORTING FRAMEWORK\n\nThe Memorial is a statutory authority within the Department of Veterans’ Affairs portfolio, and is responsible for functions in accordance with the requirements of the Australian War Memorial Act 1980, the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, and other applicable acts. The Memorial’s strategic direction and policies are set by its Council.\n\nManagement and implementation of strategies and policies are the responsibility of the Director, who is a statutory appointee under the Australian War Memorial Act 1980.\n\nThe strategic direction for the Memorial over 2016–17 is articulated in the Memorial’s Corporate Plan. The plan includes, among other things, the outcomes to be achieved by the Memorial, as well as its vision, corporate priorities, and values. The Corporate Plan, approved and regularly reviewed by Council, provides the framework for developing the annual Business Plan and its related budget. All Memorial activities are linked directly to the corporate priorities and associated performance targets. Performance information related to these outputs is contained in Part 4 of this report.\n\nThe Memorial has a number of other plans that focus on particular activities including collection development; collection documentation; collection conservation; gallery and site development; audit; business risk; business continuity; budget; fraud control; information technology; workplace diversity; and security of physical assets, people, and information.\n\nFurther details of applicable legislation, functions, and powers can be found in Part 5.\n\nLOCATION\n\nThe Memorial’s main site is located at the northern end of Anzac Parade, in Campbell in the Australian Capital Territory, with storage and collection facilities approximately nine kilometres away in the northern Canberra suburb of Mitchell.\n\nPictured here with his Australian War Memorial Long Service Medallion, Mr Peter Burness joined the Memorial as a curator in 1973, and until his retirement in December 2016 was its longest-serving employee. In recognition of his outstanding service, he was appointed a Fellow of the Australian War Memorial in 2015. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 2017, and continues to work with the Australian War Memorial in a volunteer role.\n\nHigh-quality building, garden, and grounds presentation remains a top priority for the Memorial. The ongoing maintenance program ensures that the grounds and buildings are presented to the highest possible standard. Replacement of trees and other plantings was undertaken as required, as was maintenance of all sculptures and memorials, buildings, and the Pool of Reflection\n\nA major refurbishment of the Commemorative Area has been completed. The original, badly weathered sandstone stringcourse and carved figures have been replaced to preserve the appearance and heritage value of the site. The project was generously supported by the Department of Environment through a $1 million grant from the Protecting National Historic Sites program. The works also included replacement and waterproofing of the Commemorative Area garden beds and re-grouting of the Christmas Bush granite flooring and the Pool of Reflection.\n\nAs part of the Commemorative Area reconstruction project, new drainage and planter boxes have been installed. This will reduce the risk of damage to the building due to failing waterproofing and inadequate drainage.\n\nDetailed garden maintenance of the Commemorative Area and the Memorial courtyard on a weekly basis continues to keep these high-profile formal gardens at their best. The maintenance regime for the Pool of Reflection in the Commemorative Area and for the National Service Memorial Fountain in the courtyard continues at a high standard and has reduced conservation requirements.\n\nPORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS\n\nPERFORMANCE TARGET\n\nAccess to the Memorial and visitor facilities of the highest standards.\n\nRESULT Met\n\nThe implementation of the Campbell Site Development Plan continued this year, along with various minor new site developments for visitor amenities. A full width access platform was installed in the Commemorative Area entrance, using Christmas Bush granite sourced from the original quarry to ensure the works were sympathetic to the heritage aesthetic of the area. The work was designed in line with heritage and building code requirements.\n\nDesign and documentation has commenced on the southern commemorative area stairs to upgrade the handrails, improve lighting for evening and night events, and meet safety and legislated requirements.\n\nSixteen additional light poles have been installed across the Campbell Site, providing increased security and safety for the public, as well as many being fitted with power and data outlets to improve facilities for events.\n\nPORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS\n\nPERFORMANCE TARGET\n\nBuilding works that comply with relevant standards, codes, and regulations.\n\nRESULT Met\n\nAll building works undertaken at the Memorial are in accordance with relevant standards, codes, and regulations.\n\nPORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS\n\nPERFORMANCE TARGET\n\nManagement and conservation of heritage elements using the Australia ICOMOS Burra Charter\n\nRESULT Met\n\nMemorial staff continue to liaise with heritage specialists as required to seek advice for building works in heritagesensitive areas.\n\nAn ongoing maintenance and conservation regime is in place to protect and repair the stonework in the Memorial building. Over the course of this year, this work included the removal of algal deposits from the sandstone; conservation and repair of chipped and damaged stone behind the Merchant Navy Sculpture; ceiling repairs above Airman and Sailor sculptures; rejuvenation of the grout in the Hall of Memory; and conservation and re-grouting of sandstone in the Hall of Valour.\n\nA regular maintenance regime ensures the longevity of the Lone Pine tree (Pinus halepensis). A replacement Pinus halepensis, derived from a seed taken from the original Lone Pine, was planted by Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Anzac Day 2014. It is anticipated that this tree will have grown to a suitable size when the original Lone Pine reaches senescence. The new pine is in a very healthy state, assisted by the fence and bird netting which will be expanded in the coming year.\n\nPORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS\n\nPERFORMANCE TARGET\n\nTimely completion of works to minimise impact on visitors.\n\nRESULT Met\n\nAll minor works at the Memorial, including regular maintenance, cleaning, and conservation of the main building, are scheduled out of hours where possible and in consideration of significant public events. Any major works that may be disruptive are scoped and planned to ensure that intrusive elements of the work are scheduled at the most appropriate times, that alternative arrangements for visitors are made, and that the public is informed.\n\nAs noted above, the two-year Commemorative Area Reconstruction Project has been completed. The area’s significance and values have been preserved by removing deteriorating portions of sandstone, especially the string course and sculptural elements of the east and west walls, and reconstructing them with matching sandstone. Improving the drainage of the cloisters and gardens preserves their functionality as well as protecting the reconstructed stonework and the Memorial’s lower galleries from water damage.\n\nPLAQUE DEDICATION PROGRAM\n\nFour commemorative plaques were installed during the year.\n\nROLL OF HONOUR\n\nThe Memorial’s bronze Roll of Honour panels were updated for accuracy, with two in situ amendments made.\n\nCORPORATE PLAN\n\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITY:\n\nCreating and sharing knowledge, expertise and the National Collection.\n\nPORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS\n\nPROGRAM COMPONENT 1.3\n\nTHE NATIONAL COLLECTION\n\nassists Australians remember the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on society.\n\nA national collection of historical material related to Australia’s military history that is developed, managed, preserved, and interpreted to make it accessible.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe centenary of the First World War and the associated theme of commemorating a century of service has generated an unprecedented level of engagement with the National Collection. As well as supporting Australians at home and overseas to understand the significance of milestones in the story of Australia in the First World War, National Collection staff have supported public engagement with the stories of significant anniversaries for the Second World War, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and peacekeeping operations.\n\nNational Collection staff are also focused on ensuring the stories and artefacts of service of current and recent conflicts and operations around the world are collected. We are grateful for the support of the ADF in enabling National Collection staff to be deployed with colleagues in the ADF’s history and heritage units into areas where Australians are serving. In the tradition of Charles Bean and John Treloar, staff are engaged in the field identifying and collecting objects and stories that relate to those operations, the people engaged in them, and their reflections on their experiences.\n\nThe Memorial is grateful for collaboration with the ADF through the Collections Coordination Group, which facilitates the liaison between the Memorial and the ADF’s branch history and heritage units. The Defence Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG) provides technical expertise and project management in supporting the transfer of assets to the National Collection.\n\nWe have been able to regularly commission Official War Artists to travel into operational areas, which is particularly significant in the centenary of the Official War Art program, created through the efforts of Charles Bean in 1917.\n\nPlanning for a new 5,000 square metre storage facility at Mitchell is well advanced, with completion expected in December 2018. The new facility will accommodate the large technology collections, including aircraft and a number of new acquisitions relevant to contemporary and recent operations: two naval helicopters (a Seahawk and a Squirrel), an army Blackhawk, an FA18, and a P3C Orion will be acquired between 2018 and 2021. A number of land capability vehiclesfrom operations in the Solomon Islands, East Timor, Iraq, and Afghanistan have been received. The new facility will enable a review of storage of large technology at Mitchell to make the best use of available space.\n\nThe new textiles store has been operating successfully with new compactus, environmental and security controls, and new procedures to maintain its status as a clean store. Refurbishments of space in the Treloar A building and armoury have improved security and the general storage environment, and significantly reduced the risk of overcrowding.\n\nThe project to clear an accumulation of undocumented items in transit and temporary stores has been completed. New procedures for managing donations of historical material are in place to ensure timely turnaround of documentation for donors, introduction of conservation assessments to better manage risk to the collection, centralisation of documentation on the collection management system, and a significant gain in efficiency from providing guidance to potential donors before material is delivered to the Memorial. These procedures will now be extended to include all acquisitions to ensure systematic documentation, risk management, and financial compliance. The project also led to new procedures for managing radiation hazards in items such as luminous dials and watches, certain kinds of lenses and metal hardeners, and electronic equipment.\n\nThe movement of the Menin Gate Lions to their original home at the Menin Gate Memorial in Ieper was a major undertaking of conservation and logistics. The lions will stand at the Menin Gate through the centenary of the battles in Flanders in which Australians suffered so heavily in 1917. The Memorial thanks the Royal Australian Air Force, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the Government of Flanders, and the City of Ieper for their support in this major international collaboration.\n\nThere was a significant increase in the number of loan requests and items on loan with communities around Australia, and to overseas museums, galleries, and diplomatic posts commemorating events relating to the century of service and the First World War.\n\nThe Victoria Cross Project has sought to display as many of the 100 Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians as possible in the Hall of Valour during the Centenary. So far, with the support of private owners and other cultural institutions for loans of the medal, a total of 82 Australian Victoria Crosses are on display at the Memorial.\n\nLinked to that project was the acquisition – courtesy of the generosity of the Department of Defence – of the weapons used by Corporals Mark Donaldson VC and Dan Keighran VC in the actions for which they were awarded the VC in Afghanistan. The Memorial already holds the weapons used by Corporals Ben Roberts-Smith VC MG and Cameron Baird VC MG, both of which are on display in the Hall of Valour. We were privileged to conduct oral histories with Keith Payne VC AM and his wife Florence Payne OAM on their careers and lives working to support veterans.\n\nA partnership with the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Art Collective has produced a major new work for the National Collection exploring the theme of “defence of country” from an Aboriginal Australian perspective. The work is the product of a collaboration by more than 20 of the most senior artists from communities across the APY lands.\n\nEight commissions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists for the For Country, for Nation exhibition added significant new bodies of work to the Memorial’s collection relating to the service of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in or supporting the Australian Defence Force. Two major acquisitions were subsequently included in the exhibition: Ruby Plains Massacre 1 by Rover Thomas, and Horso Creek Killings by Queenie McKenzie which tell stories of the violence against Aboriginal people that occurred even as they were enlisting in the armed forces.\n\nThe first of a series of international engagements began with a reciprocal artist in residence program with the National Museum of Singapore (NMS). Australian artist Angela Tiatia and Singaporean artist Debbie Ding spent a month working together in Singapore and at the Memorial researching the collections to make new work interpreting the shared history of our countries in the Second World War to mark the 75th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore and all that it meant for our two nations. The Memorial is grateful for the support of the Anzac Centenary Arts and Culture Fund for its support of this program.\n\nBen Quilty was commissioned to create a new series of works on the emotional impact of war. Called The longest war, the series depicts three women directly affected by the loss or injury of a loved one in Afghanistan.\n\nRenowned singer/songwriter, John Schumann, and his long-time friend and collaborator, the late Hugh McDonald, performed I was only 19 to Vietnam veterans in the Hall of Memory on Vietnam Veterans Day on the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. Cinematographer Rhys Graham was commissioned to capture the performance and record video portraits with the veterans.\n\nCharles Bean’s unfulfilled ambition to create an art gallery of the Official War Art Scheme is being brought to life –virtually. An online exhibition entitled Art of nation, is under development which will enable visitors to encounter the First World War art collection as Bean intended it to be displayed, view the paintings, click through to map views and historical images to compare landscapes and locations with their appearance today, and to track the journeys of featured artists through the theatres of the First World War.\n\nCreated in November 2015, the Operational Records Working Group (ORWG) is the principal liaison point between the Department of Defence and the National Archives of Australia, and the Memorial in managing the transfer of relevant official records to the National Collection. Digitisation of official records progresses on the basis of conservation need, demand and availability. New releases included Royal Australian Navy reports of proceedings, and army vehicle registration books containing details for tanks, assault vehicles, armoured vehicles, machine-gun carriers, 15 cwt trucks, scout cars, and jeeps between 1938 and 1993.\n\nOfficial War Artist files relating to Ivor Hele, Frank Norton, Bruce Fletcher, Ken McFadyen, and Will Dyson were digitised and published online.\n\nWork is underway to create a nominal roll for the Malayan Emergency and Indonesian Confrontation from authoritative archival sources. This will be digitised, indexed, transcribed, and published online in a searchable format.\n\nThe Anzac connections program to digitise the diaries and letters of Australians who served with the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War continued with newly digitised collections relating to doctors and musical performances, military bands and musicians. Collections related to the Battle of Hamel are being digitised and will be progressively released to the website leading up to the centenary of the battle in July 2018.\n\nWar, two gas masks, and a range of helmets and goggles related to post-1945 conflicts and peacekeeping operations.\n\nThe helmets demonstrate the evolution of combat helmet design over more than a century. Like de Medici’s moth studies at the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and her ongoing series portraying weapons, these helmets have the appearance of specimens. De Medici’s meticulously drawn helmets reflect her key observations that the helmet is both a mask and a metaphor for a skull, and that it serves as a contemporary vanitas representing death, violence, and commemoration.\n\nCure for pain was generously donated to the Memorial – through the Australian Government’s Cultural Gifts Program – by Erika Krebs-Woodward in 2016 and is on display as partof the exhibition The deceiving eye, located on the Mezzanine Gallery of Anzac Hall until 11 September 2017.\n\neX de Medici, Cure for pain, 2010–2011, watercolour on paper, 114 x 415 cm, ART96843\n\nAWM Licensed copyright\n\nPORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS\n\nPERFORMANCE TARGET\n\nThe number of new items acquired, in accordance with the Collection Development Plan.\n\nRESULT Met\n\nA total of 5,366 new items were acquired in accordance with the Collection Development Plan\n\nMemorial Integrated Collection Access (MICA)\n\nThe Memorial Integrated Collection Access (MICA) system is the collection management system used for the recording of all items accessioned to the National Collection, as well as other items such as the education collection, plaques, etc. Other Memorial systems such, as the Memorial website and the Digital Asset Management System (DAMS), rely on information from MICA to complete business functions.\n\nAn “object record” within MICA can contain numerous individual items. For example, the Memorial’s iconic “G for George” Lancaster bomber, while being a single “record” within MICA, contains many individual items, each detailing a different component of the aircraft such as its fuselage, wings, propellers, engine, etc.\n\n2,396 object records (12,301 items) were added to MICA, and to the National Collection, in the 2016–17 financial year.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nThroughout the year, the Memorial continued its work in growing the National Collection and gathering artefacts and historically important items to tell the story of Australia’sexperience in war. Many interesting and unique pieces were accessioned during the year, including:\n\nSandakan letter\n\nA letter written to Sandakan prisoner of war Herman “Algie” Reither by his mother in late June 1943. The letter came into the care of Sandakan death camp survivor Bill Sticpewich when Algie died after the two escaped from Ranau together. The letter was preserved in a New Testament and describes the comings and goings of different people from his extended family. It tells of his mother’s declining health, farming difficulties, and news from home.\n\neX de Medici artwork\n\nThe artwork entitled Cure for pain was donated through the Australian Government’s Cultural Gifts Program by Erika Krebs-Woodward.\n\nRestored Royal Enfield\n\nA restored Royal Enfield motorcycle originally issued to Lark Force at Rabaul was donated under the Cultural Gifts program. The motorbike is thought to have returned to Australia just weeks before the Japanese invasion.\n\nWorld Trade Centre images\n\nTwo photographs of the World Trade Centre attacks on 11 September 2001 which have rarely been available on the commercial market, come from a series captured by Associated Press Photographer Richard Drew and are some of the most important images captured on that awful and portentous day. The images depict the collapse of the south tower and people falling through the air, having jumped to escape the heat from one of the burning World Trade Centre towers.\n\nPhillip Schuler portrait\n\nThis significant portrait of Melbourne Age war correspondent and great friend of Charles Bean, Philip Schuler (1889–1917), was acquired from a private seller. As war correspondent for the Melbourne Age, Schuler enlisted following his time as a war correspondent and was commissioned as a lieutenant. Wounded in action at the battle of Messines, he died of wounds on 23 June 1917.\n\n“G for George” log books\n\nLog book owned by Sergeant Len Dorricott 460 Squadron, detailing flights of “G for George”.\n\nDioramas\n\nIn 2016, contemporary artist Richard Lewer was invited to produce a new body of work in response to the Australian War Memorial’s collection for the Art Gallery of South Australia’s exhibition Sappers and shrapnel: contemporary art and the art of the trenches. Lewer’s dioramas serve a different purpose to those initially commissioned by the Australian War Memorial in the 1920s: they focus closely on individuals or groups of soldiers, suspending moments in time to capture the daily routine of troops and their surroundings. These six dioramas serve as small sites of empathic re-enactment and present an engaging contemporary response to the topic of remembrance and how we remember Australia’s involvement in the First World War.\n\nSculptures\n\nTwo early sculptures by renowned sculpture and former RAAF officer Robert Klippel, No. 11 Grief and No. 9 Anguish, were made in 1944 as Klippel was transitioning from being a model maker for the RAAF to a professional artist. They represent his experience of serving in the Second World War and losing his brother in combat.\n\nSidney Nolan painting\n\nThe remarkable work by renowned artist Sidney Nolan depicts Simpson and his donkey. Nolan completed this work as part of a large series of paintings on the subject of Gallipoli, most of which depicted soldiers and landscapes. While other wellknown depictions of Simpson picture the soldier astride or alongside his donkey, Nolan’s work features Simpson carrying the donkey across his shoulders. This painting was generously donated to the Memorial by Margaret Favilla.\n\nEscape map\n\nThis Belgian map was used by Lance Corporal Frederick Peachey during his escape from German captivity in 1917, during the First World War. The escape route used by Peachey is drawn onto the map and there are more annotations on the reverse side. Also included are postcards sent by the Australian Red Cross Prisoner of War Department to Peachey after his capture at Bullecourt on 11 April 1917. The postcards never reached Peachey as he escaped before internment in Germany.\n\nPORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS\n\nPERFORMANCE TARGET\n\nThe number of items disposed of, in accordance with the Collection Development Plan.\n\nRESULT Met\n\nPORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS\n\nPERFORMANCE TARGET\n\nGrow the number of items for which documentation has been enhanced or corrected.\n\nRESULT Met\n\nPORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS\n\nPERFORMANCE TARGET\n\nAt least 80 per cent of the collection in storage that meets conservation standards for environmental conditions.\n\nRESULT Met\n\nCORPORATE PLAN\n\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITY:\n\nCreating and sharing knowledge, expertise and the National Collection.\n\nPORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS\n\nPROGRAM COMPONENT 1.4\n\nEXHIBITIONS\n\nassist Australians remember the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on society.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe project to update the Conflicts 1945 to today galleries was completed in early October 2016, as planned. The new permanent exhibition significantly enhances the Memorial’s coverage of Australian involvement in the Middle East, including: the First Gulf War; Operation Habitat; Maritime Interception Force; United Nations’ weapons inspections; and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In response to stakeholder feedback, changes to the First Gulf War section of the new displays were implemented. Soon after the launch of the revamped galleries, three major works by Artist Ben Quilty were installed at the entrance to the Conflicts 1945 to today galleries. The works were completed in 2016 and portray family members of Australian soldiers who were killed or suffer post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of their service.\n\nAFGHANISTAN: THE AUSTRALIAN STORY\n\nIn October 2016, the Memorial launched the Afghanistan: the Australian story DVD. Directed and narrated by leading Australian journalist Chris Masters, the two-disc DVD includes a 50-minute feature documentary and extracts of the 38 interviews conducted with current and former Australian Defence Force personnel and their families. It also contains film and photographs drawn from the Memorial’s Afghanistan: the Australian story exhibition. The Memorial took the opportunity to include new material that has become available since the exhibition was developed in 2013, particularly through the Department of Defence. Eleven new interviews were conducted by Chris Masters, focusing on the role of Special Forces in Afghanistan, an under-represented aspect of the current exhibition. New content collected and interviews conducted during the development of the DVD are currently being used to update the gallery experience. The updated version of the audio visual experience is due for completion in July 2017.\n\nGALLERY UPDATES\n\nSecond World War galleries\n\nCompleted at the end of 2016, recent work in the Second World War galleries includes the rearrangement of large objects to address visitor circulation issues and to reposition the LePkw Type 82 Kubelwagen and BMW motorcycle which have been subject to damage due to their open display. A new low-level two-section plinth with glass barriers for the display of large objects (the tankette; the BMW motorcycle; the Kubelwagen; the German Flak 38 anti-aircraft gun; and the Chevrolet lorry and Breda anti-aircraft gun) will be part of the changes to the galleries.\n\nThe Holocaust exhibit\n\nA new permanent display titled The Holocaust: witnesses and survivors opened to the public in the Second World War galleries in November 2016. The exhibition tells the story of the Holocaust through the experiences of several survivors who made lives in post-war Australia. The exhibition has been developed by the Australian War Memorial with the support of the Jewish Holocaust Centre and includes over 85 collection items from both institutions. Many of these items are original documentation from Jewish men, women, and children who survived ghettos, and concentration and extermination camps.\n\nHall of Valour\n\nThe Victoria Cross Project has sought to display as many of the 100 Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians as possible in the Hall of Valour during the Centenary. So far, with the support of private owners and other cultural institutions, 82 Australian Victoria Crosses are on display at the Memorial. During the course of this project, the Memorial has acquired nine Australian Victoria or George Crosses for the National Collection:\n\nCorporal Lawrence Carthage Weathers VC\n\nLieutenant Chalmers Borella VC MM\n\nSergeant Samuel George Pearse VC MM\n\nWarrant Officer Class II Keith Payne VC AM\n\nSergeant James Rogers VC\n\nSergeant John Woods Whittle VC DCM\n\nPrivate Horace William Madden GC\n\nLieutenant Arthur Gerald Bagot GC DSC\n\nCaptain Lionel Colin Matthews GC MC\n\nThe Victoria Cross and medal group awarded to Private Reginald Roy Inwood VC (First World War) was demounted and returned during this period. Other changes to the space include the inclusion of the Order of Australia awarded to Keith Payne VC, and the display of the pistol belonging to Second Lieutenant Frederick Birks VC MM.\n\nA new display featuring the uniform items and weapon of Corporal Cameron Baird VC MG alongside the uniform and weapon of Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith VC MG was unveiled in the Hall of Valour on 14 September 2016. Corporal Baird was killed in the final moments of an assault in the Afghan village of Ghawchak on 22 June 2013. The new display features items of his uniform and the damaged M4 carbine he was using during the operation. The VC for Baird’s action was the first awarded to a member of an Australian commando unit and has been on display in the Hall of Valour in 2014.\n\nAnzac Hall\n\nA project to update two new permanent displays in Anzac Hall commenced in early 2017. The first exhibition is centred on the Mark IV tank and focuses on the evolution of tanks during theFirst World War. The exhibition is due for completion in July 2017.\n\nThe second exhibition is related to the battle of Milne Bay. Fought between 25 August and 7 September 1942, the battle is often described as the first decisive Allied victory over Japanese forces in the Pacific. The new permanent exhibition focuses on this significant battle and will include key objects including the captured Japanese Ha Go tank and battle relics. The launch of the display is scheduled to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the battle in August 2017.\n\nOTHER GALLERIES\n\nEight displays of works on paper were completed, featuring in each of the permanent galleries. Four displays were changed over in the Reading Room, one focusing on Vietnam Veterans Day, and three focused on the 75th anniversary of the Memorial. Minor works to the display infrastructure\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING\n\nFraud risk\n\nThe Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework outlines the Australian Government’s requirements for fraud control, including that government entities put in place a comprehensive fraud control program that covers prevention, detection, investigation, and reporting strategies. In January 2017 the Memorial undertook its triennial re-assessment of its fraud control framework. The resulting report and plan identified:\n\nno risks above moderate\n\nseven moderate risks\n\nseven low risks\n\nfive very low risks\n\nRisks rated moderate to very low are managed within existing resources and are monitored and reported as part of the Memorials existing quarterly risk management framework.\n\nBusiness risk\n\nIn October 2016 the Memorial undertook its triennial Business Risk Assessment. Senior management, with the assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers, undertook a comprehensive analysis of the threats to the Memorial’s ability to meet its objectives, and identified appropriate controls and mitigation strategies.\n\nManagement of these key business risks have been incorporated into corporate and annual business planning processes. Progress against the proposed actions to address the high and significant risks are monitored by senior management and reported quarterly to Council.\n\nRisk benchmarking\n\nEach year the Memorial participates in Comcover’s annual risk management benchmarking survey, which provides a basis to measure our performance against similar government agencies and identifies areas for possible improvement.\n\nIn the March 2016 survey, the Memorial achieved an overall risk maturity rating of “integrated”, which aligned with the results of the majority of Commonwealth agencies. The report also highlighted areas of potential improvement in the Memorial’s overall risk management framework.\n\nIn response, the existing risk management framework was reviewed and enhanced to incorporate current best-practice and risk management methodologies. A revised Director’s Instruction was developed to consolidate various risk-related policies and documentation, and to inform staff of the organisation’s underpinning appetite and tolerance in relation to the range of business risks.\n\nThe results from the March 2017 survey, shows significant improvement in the Memorial’s overall rating, moving from “integrated” to “advanced” as a result of the work undertaken since the 2016 survey.\n\nEvaluation and visitor research\n\nThis year Evaluation and Visitor Research section completed a revision of the Memorial’s domestic audience segmentation profile. Last undertaken in 2003, the psychographic study examines the existing and potential general public audience according to values, attitudes, and motivations. It provides an integrating framework for demographic and qualitative information collection in-house by the Memorial. Roy Morgan Research was engaged to perform this year’s study. The study utilised focus groups, on-site exit surveying, a large online national survey, and current and retrospective profiling of the Memorial’s exit surveys according to their proprietary profiling systems. The updated audience profile will be used to ensure that varying audience types are considered and targeted effectively through the variety of programs provided by the Memorial.\n\nThe General Visitor Survey was conducted again in 2017. This year 725 respondents completed the survey as they exited the Memorial. The results set the benchmarking information used throughout this report.\n\nThe section maintained its standard audience research priorities relating to café catering customer service survey; Big things in store; and exhibition evaluations. Summative surveys were concluded for the Mephisto: the devil’s chariottemporary display and Reality in flames: modern Australian art and the Second World War special exhibition. A concept exploration survey was conducted for an exhibition on the consequences of war to inform the project team of visitor understanding and interests. The For Country, for Nation special exhibition exit survey commenced and is in progress for the duration of the exhibition.\n\nThe combination of in-house studies and the external segmentation profile will help the Memorial to build on its strengths and overcome barriers to visitor engagement in the post centenary period.\n\nINTERNAL OUTPUT\n\nPROGRAM COMPONENT 1.11\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT\n\nManagement of the Memorial’s buildings and grounds, and its financial, human, and general service resources to the best advantage of external outputs.\n\nBUILDINGS AND SERVICES\n\nBuildings\n\nEnergy management continues to be a priority for the Memorial, and technical initiatives have maintained efficient energy consumption on the site. The refinement of strategy for building climate control continues, with an emphasis on managing temperature and humidity parameters to meet the needs of collection material and energy efficiency. The Memorial partnered with ACTEW to conduct monitoring of the Building Management Control Systems in all buildings, with monthly performance reports on performance providing focus on maintenance and repair work for critical systems that are not operating as efficiently as their design and specifications allow. This project saw improved controls and collection storage conditions and highlighted several capital control upgrades required to provide ongoing energy savings. Replacement of fluorescent and conventional lighting with energy efficient bulbs and LED technologies was undertaken in the Campbell and Mitchell precincts, including a full upgrade to the Treloar C workshop high bay lighting, which is expected to produce additional savings and increased lighting levels.\n\nThe next stage of the Mitchell Site Development Plan to determine long-term site development and corporate storage priorities for the Memorial’s future growth and acquisitions has progressed. The concept design for the first stage large technology object storage building is well underway. The Memorial’s Mitchell properties comprise land belonging to both the Australian Capital Territory and the Commonwealth, and discussions are underway to resolve any potential titleissues which may impact the long-term redevelopment plans of the site.\n\nMajor accommodation projects have been undertaken in Campbell and Mitchell. The design and construction of new secure office space to accommodate the official histories project was completed on the Campbell site, with staff relocated into the new accommodation from early December 2016.\n\nSeveral other projects were completed, including a new concrete path adjacent bus drop off on the east road, installation of a platform in the Commemorative Area to allow disabled access, and the upgrade to current standards of the Administration Building lift.\n\nGrounds\n\nGrounds maintenance contracts are managed to ensure outstanding grounds presentation at all times. Detailed grounds maintenance and horticulture contracts are managed separately to ensure professional services are delivered. A specialist gardener is contracted for garden maintenance of the Commemorative Area, Eastern Precinct, and memorials and sculptures throughout the Western Precinct, to ensure these locations are presented at a high standard.\n\nAdditional underground electrical infrastructure for Anzac Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies was installed to improve the Memorial’s ability to support audio-visual presentations and broadcast media involvement in on-site events. This work has reduced the potential risk to staff and visitors from accidents due to cables across roads and pathways.\n\nA regular maintenance regime for the Lone Pine tree (Pinus halepensis) continues to assist with its longevity, a replacement pine, grown from a seed taken from the original Lone Pine tree, was planted by Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Anzac Day 2014. It is anticipated that this tree will have grown to a suitable size when the original Lone Pine reaches senescence. The new tree is in a healthy state, and this is assisted by the fence and bird netting.\n\nThe official opening and dedication of the Flanders Memorial Garden occurred in May and a new bronze dog water bowl was added to the explosive detection dogs’ memorial, Elevation of the senses, in the Eastern Precinct.\n\nA major upgrade of the plantings around the Memorial’s Administration Building was completed in early 2017, including rabbit-proofing of the garden bed and the rectification of concrete plinths around the building’s façade.\n\nPlanning for additional footpath behind Anzac Hall is underway to assist school group access, reduce slip hazards, and decrease the red gravel wash-off onto roads and into drains during heavy rain.\n\nSecurity\n\nRegular security risk reviews are undertaken to ensure a strengthened focus on Memorial security arrangements\n\nLiaison with the Australian Federal Police (AFP) occurs for all high-profile visits and events. There is a particularly positive relationship with AFP (ACT Policing) for liaison, coordination, and the AFP’s role in the Memorial’s high-profile events and ceremonies such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day\n\nSite vehicle access mitigation strategies and planning is underway in line with the Site Development Plan to include controls such as vehicle bollards and boulders.\n\nThe upgrade of electronic security infrastructure continues. This includes closed circuit television (CCTV) and site lighting enhancements throughout the Memorial grounds. Proliferation of CCTV throughout the galleries and Memorial buildings continues.\n\nNew baggage inspection and cloaking arrangements were introduced in May 2016. Inspections are conducted by security staff with a focus on the Main Building public entry points. The Emergency Planning Committee (EPC) met four times during 2016–17. Planning and conducting emergency evacuation drills for all Memorial buildings has continued, with improvements identified and implemented.\n\nWorkshop services\n\nThe Memorial’s workshop supports a wide range of Memorial activities. Work this year included trades support for the For Country, for Nation, Home on a southern hill and The deceiving eye exhibits. Workshop staff were also responsible for the design and creation of the ceremonial soil boxes used in the dedication ceremony of the Flanders Memorial Garden, with the soil box for each state and territory of Australia made from timbers indigenous to that area. Each soil box was hand-crafted by our highly-skilled team of tradesmen. The Memorial’s Workshop provides technical trades-based support and advice to all sections of the Memorial. The Workshop is also responsible for a wide range of building works, preparations for ceremonies, gallery maintenance, furniture construction, the installation of commemorative plaques and signage, and general building and grounds maintenance works.\n\nRecords management\n\nMail Room duties include records management, retrieval and rehousing of physical paper files, and the scanning of incoming mail.\n\nA review of records management processes and security risks has identified an opportunity to further centralise scanning of incoming mail.\n\nMailroom and loading dock security is an ongoing focus, particularly in relation to potential security threats arising from incoming mail and deliveries. Development and review of mailroom policies and procedures ensures best practice mail tracking and receipt, while addressing security requirements.Mailroom and loading dock security is an ongoing focus, particularly in relation to potential security threats arising from incoming mail and deliveries. Development and review of mailroom policies and procedures ensures best practice mail tracking and receipt, while addressing security requirements.\n\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\n\nCorporate systems\n\nThe Information Technology (IT) section supports a broad range of information and communication technology-based systems underpinning operations such as administration; collection management; public access; gallery information and experience; retail; and online services. There is an excellent record of systems availability, achieved through dedicated attention to systems monitoring and timely, well-planned upgrades.\n\nSignificant application and database changes were implemented for the Memorial website redevelopment project. This included a re-architecture of media storage to improve accessibility and maintenance, and a significant increase in data to improve search functionality.\n\nContinued support was provided for a number of initiatives associated with the centenary of the First World War, particularly in relation to the Last Post Ceremony, the Roll of Honour name projections, and Roll of Honour soundscapes.\n\nThe year saw the conclusion of a project to upgrade the Digital Asset Management System (DAMS). The DAMS solution is a centralised repository for archival quality storage of digitised collection materials. The upgrade included the implementation of an out-of-the-box web client which reduced reliance on complex system customisations. Subsequent work has expanded the capability of the DAMS and introduced additional automated workflows to share information with the collection management system.\n\nThe SharePoint-based electronic documents management system continues to support corporate information management and recordkeeping requirements. The system was further enhanced with additional workflows to transform paper-based approvals to digital processes to achieve organisational efficiencies and meet the implementation targets identified in the government’s “Digital Continuity2020 Plan”.\n\nThe retail system used by the Memorial’s shop was upgraded. This included enhancements to the portable till, stocktake tools, and an upgrade of shop computers.\n\nThe IT service management application was upgraded in order to maintain vendor support, technical currency, and integration compatibility. The upgrade enabled better system performance, reliability, and scalability.\n\nThe section continues the upgrade and development of solutions to support management of the National Collection. These solutions support information management and enhance preservation, conservation and curatorial tasks, which enables the Memorial to make the collection and information accessible to the public.\n\nIT infrastructure\n\nThe Information Technology section develops and maintains an in-house IT platform which supports its systems, including those referred to above. In addition to meeting the workload generated by the implementation or upgrade of system application projects, the infrastructure team also achieved the following:\n\nEstablishment of a security certified network and solution to support the IT requirements for the writing of the official history volumes relating to Australia’s involvement in the conflicts of Iraq, Afghanistan, and East Timor.\n\nUpgrade of hardware for recording and live streaming of the daily Last Post Ceremony. The new hardware provides a simplified solution with increased resilience.\n\nExpansion of storage infrastructure to support the increasing needs of the Digital Asset Management System. The infrastructure provides scalability, simplicity, efficiency, and security.\n\nReplacement of corporate printers and multi-function devices. The new equipment includes advanced functions to enable secure printing, help people work more efficiently, and reduce paper waste.\n\nThe fleet of old laptop computers were replaced and included a Windows 10-based system, delivering performance improvements, increased security, and resource efficiencies.\n\nAn upgrade to the desk phone system and backend servers, and implementation of a disaster recovery procedure.\n\nImplementation of a diverse path for internet connectivity and upgraded to a high-availability infrastructure. This was following a review of our current internet infrastructure, and possible supply route changes for the Light Rail Project.\n\nStrategic planning and governance\n\nImplementation of a diverse path for internet connectivity and upgraded to a high-availability infrastructure.

Many new projects and activities related to the centenary of the First World War were funded from an internal reserve, with potential allocations forecast over several years to ensure adequate resourcing during the centenary period 2014–18.\n\nFunding strategies were also developed for a range of capital projects planned over the next ten years, including National Collection storage, gallery refurbishments, building works, site development, software upgrades, and IT hardware replacement.\n\nRegular financial reporting to senior management, Council, and the Department of Finance throughout the year included Memorial-wide financial results, budget review and analysis, cash balance reporting, capital management planning, and commercial operations.\n\nFinancial policy\n\nThe Head of Finance and the Chief Finance Officer (CFO) continued to participate in the development of wholeof-government reforms through developing input to key discussion papers and consultation processes, including review of valuation methodology for heritage and cultural assets.\n\nThe CFO was also involved in activities to ensure that funding strategies for major projects and programs are achieved, including resource planning and forecasting for projects associated with collection development and long-term accommodation and storage needs.\n\nHUMAN RESOURCES\n\nStrategic people management/workforce planning\n\nThe Memorial has identified the following strategic workforce priorities:\n\nalignment of people and our business through positive performance culture\n\nThe fleet of old laptop computers were replaced and included a Windows 10-based system, delivering performance improvements, increased security, and resource efficiencies.\n\nbuilding leadership and management capability\n\nattracting and retaining the right people\n\nencouraging innovation and agility\n\nWorkforce planning continues to evolve within the Memorial to build and sustain a diverse workforce. This will deliver current and future business objectives and provide greater opportunity to attract, develop, and retain skilled, engaged, and committed employees. Critical capability gaps are being identified to enable the development of tailored strategies to assist in mitigating future workforce risk. This will lead to greater linkages and alignment with business to achieve the Memorial’s strategic objectives.\n\nWorkforce development\n\nThe Memorial fosters a culture of professional development and continuous learning in building capability, capacity, and bench strength for the future.\n\nInitiatives for 2017 included the continuation of:\n\na Leadership Development Program for leaders at the APS5–EL1 levels. The program provides leaders with a common language and understanding in fostering a culture of high performance and of staff being more fully engaged. The cohort structure of representatives from each business section supports networking and cross collaboration.\n\n“Learnhub”, the Memorial’s online e-learning program where all staff can participate in a diverse range of training by participating in or registering to attend in-house face-toface training.\n\nspecialist training programs, conferences and seminars continue to be a hallmark of the annual Learning and Development Plan in supporting the development of the range of expertise required within the Memorial.\n\naccreditations provide currency in licensing and skills required for the job.\n\nthe Memorial’s Studies Assistance Scheme continues to provide support to staff enabling them to undertake formal qualifications relevant to their expertise and career progression.\n\nPeople management and services\n\nWork is currently underway on improving and simplifying the annual performance assessment process, with focus on embedding regular feedback between staff and managers.\n\nThe Workplace Relations Committee met regularly throughout the year and continues to be an important forum for staff consultation and policy development.\n\nEnterprise bargaining concluded in May 2017 with the majority of staff supporting a new agreement for approval by the Fair Work Commission in June 2017.\n\nThe Memorial Security Team was presented with certificates in Government Security by senior members of the Attorney General's Department.\n\nStatement of Comprehensive Income\n\nfor the period ended 30 June 2017\n\n2017 2016 Original\n\nBudget Notes $'000 Ref $'000 NET COST OF SERVICES Expenses Employee Benefits 1.1A 24,680 22,673 23,397 Suppliers 1.1B 29,435 21,461 i 22,004 Depreciation and amortisation 2.2A 21,701 20,066 ii 28,616 Write-Down and Impairment of Assets 1.1C 19 12 -

Independent valuers conducted revaluations of heritage and cultural assets and property, plant and equipment, effective 30 June 2017.\n\nContractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe Memorial has entered into net future commitments for the acquisition of buildings, heritage and cultural, plant and equipment, exhibition and intangible assets of $4,735,496 (2015-16; $3,438,000). Significant individual commitments relate to the National Collection, with commitments for fees, until 2063, for a cold storage facility to stabilise nitrate film ($1,521,000), sculpture commissions ($690,000) and commitments associated with the writing of the independent history of the medical legacies of the Vietnam War which will be accessioned into the National Collection when completed ($485,100).\n\nAccounting Policy\n\nAssets are recorded at cost on acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Non-financial assets are initially measured at their fair value plus transaction costs where appropriate.\n\nAssets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets and income at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Significant donated Heritage and Cultural (Collection) assets are recognised at the time of acquisition, and other donated collection items are brought to account at the time of revaluation.\n\nAsset Recognition Threshold\n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the statement of financial position, except for purchases costing less than $2,000, which are expensed in the year of acquisition (other than where they form part of a group of similar items which are significant in total).\n\nThe initial cost of an asset includes an estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located.\n\nRevaluations\n\nFollowing initial recognition at cost, property, plant and equipment are carried at fair value less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets did not differ materially from the assets fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depended upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets.\n\nRevaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of asset revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class that was previously recognised in the surplus/deficit.\n\nRevaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly in the surplus/deficit except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the revalued amount.\n\nDepreciation\n\nDepreciable property, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives to the entity using, in all cases, the straight-line method of depreciation.\n\nDepreciation rates (useful lives), residual values and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate.\n\nDepreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives:\n\n2017\n\nYears 2016\n\nYears Buildings and building improvements 1 to 162 1 to 162 Plant and equipment 1 to 50 1 to 48 Exhibitions 1 to 20 2 to 20\n\nImpairment\n\nAll assets were assessed for impairment at 30 June 2017. Where indications of impairment exist, the assets's recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment made if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset's ability to generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the entity were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost.\n\nDerecognition\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.\n\nSignificant accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe fair value of land and buildings is considered to be the market value of similar assets, taking into account the heritage aspects of the buildings where appropriate, and using depreciated replacement cost if no active market is identified.\n\nHeritage and Cultural (Collection) assets\n\nThe Memorial's collection of heritage and cultural assets comprises a wide range of objects relating to Australia's military history, including but not limited to:\n\nWorks of art (various media) - Film\n\nLarge technology objects - Audio\n\nMilitary heraldry and technology items - Photographs\n\nOfficial and private records - Ephemera\n\nPursuant to section 8 of the Australian War Memorial Act 1980, the Memorial has the authority to dispose of heritage and cultural items which are not required as part of the National Collection, or are unfit for inclusion. Section 8 of the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 dictates the appropriate approvals to dispose of National Collection assets.\n\nThe decision whether or not to acquire or retain an item for the National Collection is based on two criteria:\n\n1. Assessment to establish that the item is of significance to Australian military history.\n\n2. Assessment that the benefit and resource implications of acquiring or retaining the item are acceptable.\n\nThe evaluation process ensures that the history and provenance of objects is recorded at the time of acquisition and records the significance of the item to the Australian community, provides a systematic assessment of the values of objects against the existing collection and other collecting institutions, and assists in settling priorities for collection management and conservation resources.\n\nThe Memorial's Collection Development Plan for heritage and cultural assets can be found at: https://www.awm.gov.au/sites/default/files/collection_development_plan.pdf\n\nThe Memorial's preservation and curatorial policies for heritage and cultural assets can be found at: https://www.awm.gov.au/about/our-work/projects/conservation\n\nRevaluations\n\nHeritage and Cultural (Collection) Assets are carried at fair value, which is measured at depreciated replacement cost or market selling price (for items where a market exists).\n\nFollowing initial recognition at cost, Heritage and Cultural (Collection) Assets are carried at fair value less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency such that the carrying amounts of assets do not differ materially from the assets' fair values at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets.\n\nDepreciation\n\nAll Heritage and Cultural (Collection) Assets are written off over their estimated useful life to the Memorial using the straight-line method of depreciation.\n\nDepreciation rates (useful lives) have been estimated based on the condition and physical composition of items in each sub-class, and range from 5 to 600 years. Rates and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate.\n\nSignificant accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe fair value of Heritage and Cultural (Collection) Assets is considered to be market selling price (where such a market exists), or depreciated replacement cost, taking into consideration the intrinsic value of historically significant objects.\n\nOwing to the size of the National Collection, a representative sample of major categories is selected and valued, and the results are used to determine a total fair value.\n\nIntangibles\n\nThe Memorial's intangibles comprise purchased software, which are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nSoftware is amortised on a straight-line basis over its anticipated useful life. The useful lives range from 1 to 11 years (2016: 2 to 10 years).\n\nAll software assets were assessed for indications of impairment as at 30 June 2017.\n\n2017 2016 $'000 $'000 2.2B: Inventories Inventories held for sale Work in progress - 82 Finished goods 794 817 Total inventories held for sale 794 899\n\nAccounting Policy\n\nThe Memorial holds inventory for sale only, and this is reported at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing each item of inventory to its present location and condition are assigned as follows:\n\nstores average purchase cost; and\n\nfinished goods and work-in-progress cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable costs that are capable of being allocated on a reasonable basis.\n\nInventories acquired at no cost or at nominal consideration are initially measured at current replacement cost at the date of acquisition.\n\n2.3 Payables\n\n2.3A: Suppliers\n\nTrade creditors and accruals 1,065 1,015 Total suppliers 1,065 1,015\n\nSettlement was usually made within 30 days (2016: 30 days).\n\n2.3B: Other Payables\n\nSalaries and wages 254 103 Prepayments received/unearned income 99 283 Paid Parental Leave 254 103 Total suppliers 4 2 Total other payables 357 388\n\n3.1 Net Cash Appropriation Arrangements\n\nTotal comprehensive income less depreciation/amortisation expenses previously\n\nfunded through revenue appropriations 115,726 46,744 Plus: depreciation/amortisation expenses previously funded through revenue appropriation 11,644 10,491 Total comprehensive income - as per the Statement of\n\nComprehensive Income 104,082 36,253\n\nFrom 2010-11 the Government introduced net cash appropriation arrangements where revenue appropriations for the National Collection depreciation expenses ceased. The Memorial now receives a separate capital budget provided through equity appropriations.\n\nPeople and relationships\n\nThis section describes a range of employment and post employment benefits provided to our people and our relationships with other key people.\n\n4.1 Employee Provisions\n\n2017 2016 $'000 $'000 4.1A: Employee Provisions Leave 8,978 8,217 Total employee provisions 8,978 8,217\n\nAccounting policy\n\nLiabilities for short-term employee benefits and termination benefits expected within twelve months of the end of reporting period are measured at their nominal amounts.\n\nLeave\n\nThe liability for employee benefits includes provision for annual leave and long service leave. No provision has been made for sick leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future years by employees of the Memorial is estimated to be less than the annual entitlement for sick leave.\n\nThe leave liablilities are calculated on the basis of employees remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will be applied at the time the leave is taken, including the Memorial's employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination.\n\nThe liability for long service leave is recognised and measured at the net present value of the estimated future cash flows to be made in respect of all employees at reporting date. In determining the present value of the liability, including related on-costs, attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation have been taken into account.\n\nSeparation and Redundancy\n\nSeparation and RedundancyProvision is made for separation and redundancy benefit payments. The Memorial recognises a provision for termination when it has developed a detailed formal plan for the terminations and has informed those employees affected that it will carry out the terminations.\n\nSuperannuation\n\nThe Memorial's staff are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), or the PSS accumulation plan (PSSap), or other superannuation funds held outside the Australian Government.\n\nThe CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap is a defined contribution scheme.\n\nThe liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported in the Department of Finance's adminstered schedules and notes\n\nThe Memorial makes employer contributions to the employees' defined benefit superannuation scheme at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government. The Memorial accounts for the contributions as if they were contributions to defined contribution plans.\n\nThe liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June represents outstanding contributions for the final fortnight of the quarter.\n\nIn line with the government's 'Stronger Super' reforms, the Memorial has completed a software upgrade to meet compliance obligations under SuperStream.\n\nAccounting judgements and estimates\n\nEmployee provisions includes an estimation component in respect of long-term employee benefits measured as the present value of estimated future cash outflows.\n\nThis accounting estimate has been identified to have minimal risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the provision in the next accounting period.\n\n4.2 Key Management Personnel Remuneration\n\nKey management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Memorial, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise). The Memorial has determined the key management personnel to be the Director, Chairman, Council Members and Assistant Directors. Key management personnel remuneration is reported in the table below:\n\n2017 2016 $'000 $'000 Short-term employee benefits 1,536 1,429 Post-employment benefits 213 224 Other long-term employee benefits 213 224 Total employee provisions 508 (19) Termination benefits - 23 Total key management personnel remuneration expenses1 2,257 1,657\n\nThe total number of key management personnel that are included in the above table is 19. They include the Chairman and members of Council and senior executive personnel. (2016: 19). When senior executives are on extended leave, or act for the Director, their positions are back-filled. The above figures include payments made to staff acting in senior executive positions\n\n1. The above key management personnel remuneration excludes the remuneration and other benefits of the Portfolio Minister. The Portfolio Minister's remuneration and other benefits are set by the Remuneration Tribunal and are not paid by the Memorial.\n\n4.3 Related Party Disclosures\n\nRelated party relationships:\n\nThe Memorial is an Australian Government controlled entity. Related parties to this entity are Directors, Key Management Personnel and other Australian Government entities.\n\nTransactions with related parties:\n\nGiven the breadth of Government activities, related parties may transact with the government sector in the same capacity as ordinary citizens. Such transactions include the payment or refund of taxes, receipt of a Medicare rebate or higher education loans. These transactions have not been separately disclosed in this note.\n\nSignificant transactions with related parties can include:\n\npurchases of goods and services;\n\nGiving consideration to relationships with related entities, and transactions entered into during the reporting period by the Memorial, it has been determined that there are no related party transactions to be separately disclosed.\n\nManaging uncertainties\n\nThis section analyses how the Memorial manages financial risks within its operating environment\n\n5.1 Contingent Assets and Liabilities\n\nContingent assets and liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position but contingent assets are disclosed when settlement is probable but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are disclosed when settlement is greater than remote.\n\nThe Memorial has one quantifiable contingent asset in respect of a bequest $18,500 (2016: $113,300). This amount represents a distribution after the sale of shares and other assets. There were no contingent liabilities in the current reporting period (2016: nil).\n\n5.2 Financial Instruments\n\n2017 2016 $'000 $'000 5.2A: Categories of Financial Instruments Financial Assets Held-to-maturity investments Deposits on short-term investments 71,000 71,000 Total held-to-maturity investments 71,000 71,000 Loans and receivables Cash at bank 1,811 2,935 Trade and other receivables 846 756 Accrued interest revenue 930 727 Total loans and receivables 3,587 4,418 Total financial assets 74,587 75,418 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Trade creditors 1,065 1,015 Total financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 1,065 1,015 Total financial liabilities 1,065 1,015\n\nAccounting Policy\n\nFinancial"
