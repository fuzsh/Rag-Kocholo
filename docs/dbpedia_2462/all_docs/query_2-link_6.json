        "text": "Australian forces have been active in Afghanistan in various roles since the war's inception in 2001.\n\nThe war has cost the lives of 40 Australian soldiers, and more than $7.5 billion.\n\nNow, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced that the last Australian troops have left Uruzgan Province.\n\nTake a look back at Australia's involvement in Afghanistan.\n\nOctober 2001\n\nThe invasion of Afghanistan begins in response to the deadly September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.\n\nLate 2001: Phase one\n\nThe Australian contribution to the war, dubbed Operation Slipper, begins with the deployment of troops in an initial offensive against the Taliban.\n\nThe deployment includes a Special Forces Task Group and two Air Force aircraft, which provide support for coalition operations.\n\nThe Special Forces troops are involved in the establishment of the Coalition's first Forward Operating Base (Camp Rhino), south-west of Kandahar.\n\nThey are also involved in the capture of Kandahar International Airport in December 2001.\n\nDecember 2002\n\nAustralia's initial commitment in Afghanistan concludes and the Special Forces Task Group is withdrawn.\n\nSeptember 2005: Phase two\n\nA Special Forces Task Group is re-deployed to Afghanistan. The group consists of crew from the Special Air Services Regiment, the 4th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, the Incident Response Regiment and logistic support personnel.\n\nThe group is equipped with heavily-modified land rovers, as well as Bushmaster mobility vehicles.\n\nTwo Chinook helicopters are also deployed to support the taskforce.\n\nSeptember 2006: Phase three\n\nThe Special Forces Task Group is withdrawn from Afghanistan and the first of four reconstruction task forces is deployed to Uruzgan Province.\n\nThe Australians work as part of the Dutch-led Provincial Reconstruction Team.\n\nThose on the ground include protective elements from the 5th/7th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment.\n\nThey are based at Forward Operating Base Ripley, outside of Tarin Kot.\n\nApril 2007\n\nA 200-strong Special Operations Task Group is deployed to support the Reconstruction Task Force. The new group includes a Commando company-group, elements of the Special Air Services Regiment and a combat services support team.\n\nIn addition to radar crews, logistics and intelligence officers, and security personnel, it brings the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to 950 by mid-2007.\n\nThere are further small increases to 1,000 in mid-2008, 1,100 in early 2009 and 1,550 in mid-2009.\n\nEarly 2009\n\nAs part of the Australian mission to mentor and train Afghan troops, a number of Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams are embedded into Afghan National Army battalions in Uruzgan.\n\nConsequently, the Reconstruction Task Force was renamed the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force.\n\nThe task force's numbers get a boost in May 2009.\n\nJanuary 2009\n\nTrooper Mark Donaldson becomes the first Australian in 40 years to be presented with the Victoria Cross, the nation's highest gallantry medal.\n\nTrooper Donaldson had exposed himself to enemy fire to protect injured Australian troops during an ambush in 2008, and also saved the life of an Afghan interpreter.\n\nFebruary 2010\n\nA modest Australian force remains in Afghanistan, involved in counter-insurgency operations in Uruzgan in conjunction with Dutch and other coalition forces.\n\nThe Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force is again renamed, this time to the Mentoring Task Force.\n\nThe group's numbers are boosted, and included infantry and cavalry elements, as well as engineers and aviators.\n\nA further 800 Australian logistic personnel are also based in the Middle East in support of Operation Slipper, but are located outside of Afghanistan.\n\nAugust 2010\n\nCommand of the Provincial Reconstruction Team is passed to Australian and US forces after Dutch troops withdraw from the country.\n\nMay 2011\n\nTwo Australian soldiers die in what Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston describes as a \"very bad day\" in Aghanistan.\n\nOne is killed when an Australian Army Chinook helicopter crashes during a resupply operation in Zabul Province.\n\nThe other died after being shot by an Afghan National Army soldier with whom he was serving on guard duty at a patrol base in the Chora Valley.\n\nOctober 2011\n\nThree Australians are killed and seven injured after an Afghan ally turns his gun against the Australians. An Afghan interpreter is also killed.\n\nAugust 2012\n\nFive Australian soldiers are killed in two separate incidents in Afghanistan, our worst day in combat since the Vietnam War.\n\nThree Australian soldiers were killed by a man in an Afghan army uniform in a 'green on blue' attack at a base in Uruzgan Province, and two others were killed in a helicopter crash.\n\nPrime Minister Julia Gillard rejects calls to respond to the deaths by bringing troops home early.\n\nNovember 2012\n\nThe Australian military withdraws from operating bases in Uruzgan Province and hands control to the Afghan military.\n\nJanuary 2013\n\nDefence Minister Stephen Smith announces that Australia is planning an earlier handover of security in Uruzgan Province to Afghan forces.\n\nMarch 2013\n\nDefence Force Minister Stephen Smith announces the base at Tarin Kot will close at end of the year.\n\nDecember 2013\n\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott announces that the last Australian troops have now left Uruzgan Province.\n\nAround 400 military personnel will remain in Afghanistan in training and support roles mostly in the capital Kabul and Kandahar.\n\nThe Australian Government will also provide $100 million a year to help fund Afghanistan's defence forces."
