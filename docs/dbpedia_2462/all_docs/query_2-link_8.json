The table below identifies the number of reported civilian casualties since 2007, with 2012 being the first full year to show a decline.\n\nTable 2: Civilian deaths in Afghanistan[7]\n\n2007 1523 2008 2118 2009 2412 2010 2790 2011 3131 2012 2754 2013 (up to June) 1319\n\nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) troop–contributing nations\n\nAs of 1 October 2013, the total indicative strength of ISAF troop–contributing countries was 86,834 military personnel. Collectively, these countries have had 3,397 of their personnel killed while on operations in Afghanistan.[8]\n\nThe year 2010 remains the most deadly year for coalition forces in Afghanistan. The ‘fighting season’ in the Afghan summer of that year witnessed one of the worst months with 103 ISAF military personnel killed in June (five of whom were Australian).[9] However in the following two years, the number of fatalities decreased by 43 per cent, probably due to Afghan forces having a stronger presence in operations as coalition forces transitioned to more of a support role.\n\nTable 3: Coalition deaths by year[10]\n\nThe majority of ISAF troop–contributing countries have commenced phased withdrawals of military forces in preparation for the 2014 deadline when full security responsibility is expected to be transferred to the ANSF.\n\nTable 4: ISAF country contributions and combat deaths[11]\n\nContributing country Indicative authorised strength Fatalities Albania 91 1 Armenia 131 0 Australia 1029 40 Austria 3 0 Azerbaijan 94 0 Belgium 193 1 Bosnia and Herzegovina 79 0 Bulgaria 416 0 Canada 950 158 Croatia 187 0 Czech Republic 213 5 Denmark 249 43 El Salvador 24 0 Estonia 160 9 Finland 100 2 France 235 86 Georgia 1560 27 Germany 4400 54 Greece 8 0 Hungary 151 7 Iceland 3 0 Ireland 7 0 Italy 2826 48 Jordan 0 2 Latvia 141 3 Lithuania 96 1 Luxembourg 10 0 Malaysia 2 0 Mongolia 40 0 Montenegro 25 0 Netherlands 400 25 New Zealand 11 11 Norway 111 10 Poland 1553 38 Portugal 154 2 Republic of Korea 50 1 Romania 1022 21 Slovakia 199 1 Slovenia 35 0 Spain 414 34 Sweden 259 5 FYRO Macedonia 158 0 Tonga 55 0 Turkey 1041 14 Ukraine 14 0 United Arab Emirates 35 0 United Kingdom 7900 446 United States 60000 2292 Total 86834 3397 (includes 10 fatalities recorded as NATO personnel)\n\nThe continued prevalence of IEDs\n\nAlthough insider attacks have received significant media attention, IED attacks remain the largest cause of ISAF casualties in Afghanistan. As with ISAF casualties generally, casualties from IED attacks have declined since 2010—in that year they were responsible for more than 50 per cent of ISAF fatalities.[12] ISAF’s Monthly Trend report noted that ‘insurgents continue to rely on IEDs as a principle means to execute their campaign’ and that ‘more than 60 per cent of civilian casualties caused by insurgents result from IED explosions’.[13]\n\nAccording to the iCasaulties website, the proportion of ISAF fatalities as a result of IED attacks has fallen to 46 per cent in 2013, down from a peak of almost 60 per cent in 2009.[14] The following graph, produced by ISAF, demonstrates the number of executed IED attacks between January 2008 and December 2012:\n\nChart 1: IED attacks in Afghanistan (January 2008–December 2012)[15]\n\nAustralian aid to Afghanistan\n\nAccording to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website, ‘the objective of Australia’s aid to Afghanistan is to build the capacity of the Afghan Government to deliver basic services and provide its people with opportunities to earn a livelihood’.[16] Including the current financial year, Australia has provided over $1.2 billion in official development assistance (ODA) to Afghanistan since 2001.\n\nTable 5: Australia’s ODA to Afghanistan 2001–02 to 2013–14[17]\n\nYear ODA (A$ millions) 2001–02 $26.5 2002–03 $21.5 2003–04 $23.7 2004–05 $22.8 2005–06 $20.7 2006–07 $77.2 2007–08 $137.9 2008–09 $155.9 2009–10 $113.3 2010–11 $111.3 2011–12 $198.4 2012–13 (estimated outcome) $182.8 2013-14 (budget estimate) $180.4 Total $1272.4\n\nOn 8 July 2012 Foreign Minister Carr signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on development cooperation with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal.[18] The MoU sets out mutual ‘partnership priorities’ for Australian ODA to Afghanistan:\n\nsecurity: ‘achieve nationwide stabilisation, strengthen law enforcement, and improve personal security for every Afghan’\n\ngovernance, rule of law and human rights: ‘strengthen democratic processes and institutions, human rights, the rule of law, delivery of public services and government accountability’ and\n\neconomic and social development: ‘reduce poverty, ensure sustainable development through a private-sector-led market economy, improve human development indicators, and make significant progress towards the [Millennium Development Goals]’.[19]\n\nKey Government statements on Australia’s military commitment to Afghanistan, September 2001–June 2013\n\nTable 6: Key Australian Government statements\n\nDate Key points Sources 14 September 2001 Prime Minister John Howard announced that the Government was invoking Article IV of the Australia, New Zealand and the United States (ANZUS) Treaty in response to the terrorist attacks against the US.

S Smith (Minister for Defence), Interview with Michael Rowland, ABC News Breakfast, transcript, media release, 3 February 2012. 9 February 2012 Defence Minister Smith emphasised that the international community needed to be making decisions about their post-2014 commitment to Afghanistan.
