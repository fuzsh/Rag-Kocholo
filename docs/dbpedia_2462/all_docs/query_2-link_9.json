        "text": "Leaked US diplomatic cables expose friction between Australia and its allies, undermining the public veneer of coalition solidarity. We did not trust the Dutch, our key partner in Afghanistan. The US State Department cables, released exclusively by WikiLeaks to The Sunday Age, include reports from the US embassy in Canberra that reveal deep distrust between Australian and Dutch forces in Oruzgan province, where Australia was part of a Netherlands-led force. In February 2007, Australian officers, concerned the Taliban were preparing a do-or-die offensive, started planning to send special forces back to Oruzgan. This was just five months after the Howard government pulled them out, in September 2006, when it argued Oruzgan was ”relatively stable” and that Australian reconstruction troops remaining in the province were well protected by their own forces and Dutch troops. But the claims of stability and the stated faith in the Dutch were undermined when intelligence reports warned of a Taliban resurgence. While the army planned another special forces deployment, officials in Canberra briefed journalists that the troops would be under Australian – not Dutch – command. But privately, Australia actually wanted them under US command.\n\nIn February and March 2007, Australian officers briefed US diplomats in Canberra, expressing ”frustration” that the Dutch were more focused on reconstruction than military operations. This is odd, as Australian troops then in Oruzgan were also focused on reconstruction. They also complained the Dutch were ”not responding aggressively enough to the expected offensive”, US ambassador Robert McCallum reported on February 22. At the time the Dutch were the lead nation in Oruzgan, as part of NATO’s International Security Assistance Force. Australian officers believed ISAF’s rules on when troops could open fire were too restrictive. They told the US embassy that if the special forces were under US command, they ”would be able to take a more aggressive posture against the Taliban”.\n\nThe Dutch opposed the plan, arguing it would divide the chain of command and that ISAF’s rules were sufficiently ”robust”. Dutch diplomats took their concerns to the Americans, the Dutch foreign minister called then Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer, and Defence chief Angus Houston was sent to The Hague to try to resolve the dispute.\n\nOn March 6, 2007, the US ambassador in Kabul sent a terse cable to the US embassy in Canberra, dismissing Australia’s concerns, and complaining Australia had not taken the issue to the US commander in Afghanistan, General Dan McNeill."
