        "text": "1947\n\nMoyers Corners\n\nThe northeast corner was a house owned by Mr. Philip Brand. On the southeast corner sat an open field(which became Suburban Propane). Carl’s Tavern was located on the southwest corner, while Mr. Lewis’ snack bar and garage sat on the nothwest corner. Open fields all belonging to Philip Brand.\n\nElaine Lewis recalled many conversations by the locals visiting the snack bar. A lot of comments revolved around the need of a fire department, because their only protection was an old fire truck stationed in Clay. There were many unscheduled meetings held in the snack bar, where Ken Brand, Sr., Mr. Haney, Mr. Lewis and others would meet for coffee. But unfortunately, nothing came out of these particular conversations. “You know men, they have good ideas, but it takes a push to get some action. It is either a wife behind a man, or something that gets them fired up before they move”, recalls Eileen.\n\nA gentleman named Ken Brand, Sr. got the ball rolling on November 9, 1947, the day Lyman Melvin’s garage burned down. On that cold and damp November day, Ken found himself standing helplessly watching his friend’s garage burn to the ground. He waited for the Clay and Liverpool Fire Department to arrive. The Liverpool Fire Department stopped at the town line, telling Ken that they could not cross because they did not have the insurance coverage. The Clay Fire Department arrived with their old truck, but when they arrived, the men were practically carrying the fire truck instead of the fire truck carrying them. It just wouldn’t run and they had to push it to the fire. Ken threw his hat that crookedly sat atop his head on the ground as hard as he could and proclaimed, “By God, we’re gonna get a fire department here!”. And they did, that very day.\n\nKen went from house to house looking for men interested in becoming members. The first five members (Ken Brand, Ed Harke, Sr., Paul Marshall, Ed Melvin, and Lymon Melvin) formed the nucleus. They were shortly joined by another half-dozen eager men, who all paid twenty dollar dues. Their first meeting was held in a cow barn with fifteen new members in attendance. For several months the only function of the new department was to meet occasionally and hold a ‘public hearing’ with the Town of Clay. They now had to figure out how and where to obtain a fire truck.\n\n1948\n\nMarch 12th, 1948\n\nAs their search for a fire engine progressed, fate stepped in and lent a friendly hand. On March 12, Ken was helping out at his friend Tony Louis’s gas station when a man pulled in with car trouble. During the course of conversation it developed that the man was in a hurry to get to Canton, NY to make an appointment with some prospective buyers of a fire engine he was selling.\n\n“A what?” said Ken. “A fire engine,“ said the stranger.\n\n“What year?” asked Ken. “A 1922 American LaFrance“, proclaimed the stranger.\n\n“Will you sell it to us?” “I’ll sell it to anybody”\n\n“Mister, I think you just found your buyers.\n\nDon’t go away, I’ll be right back!” With those words, Ken hurried home and called four other members. They unanimously agreed to purchase the truck. There was no contract with the Town of Clay; no means of support except the money which they would raise for themselves. They had a carnival, dances at the community hall and had ice cream socials to raise money to buy they truck.\n\nA crew drove to Batavia to take possession of their first piece of firefighting equipment. It was an extremely cold day. The men took turns driving the truck back from Batavia, all wrapped up in blankets. The open cab was not offering any protection from the elements that day, which made for an extremely long and cold ride home. Their excitement kept them warm.\n\nThe 1922 American LaFrance was purchased for five hundred dollars. The engine could hardly be called new, but the price was right. All of this happened so fast that no preparation had been made to house the “new truck”. For the next few months it was kept in Louis’ gas station. Phil Brand kept the ball rolling by donating the land for a building to house the truck. It was decided that the fire department would consist of forty active firemen.\n\nPlans for the firehouse followed. Construction started in May of 1948. All of the members volunteered their time. Some of the men, such as Ken, Earl McWithey, Fred Harke, Paul Marshall, Buck Shader, and Ed Melvin even worked through half of the night. In addition, the men worked every weekend and every spare hour they had. The building was soon completed in the fall of 1948, and the ‘new’ fire truck now had a home. By this time, Ken Brand Sr. built a new house next door to the firehouse. Ken’s wife Betty started on her own mission\n\nApril 5th, 1948\n\nThe fire department was incorporated. See Appedix A\n\nMay 25th, 1948\n\nBetty (Brand) Hanlon invited the wives of the Moyers Corners Fire Department to her home for the purpose of forming an auxiliary. There were eighteen ladies present. Acting as chairperson, Betty opened the meeting by explaining the purpose of the auxiliary. It was explained the purpose of the auxiliary is to help our firemen in any way they needed. There was some comment on whether they were ready yet to form one, so a vote was taken. Everyone voted “yes”. “The Women’s Auxiliary of the Moyers Corners Volunteer Fire Department” was decided as the name. Next it was decided on how many members of the firemen’s family should be allowed to join. A vote was teken and the result was “one member from each firemen’s famile; they could either be wife, mother, sister, or daughter, but they must reside in the district.” By-laws from the Liverpool Fire Department Auxiliary were then read and discussed. A discussion was made about the possible meeting places for future meetings. It was decided to use Lyman Melvin’s barn. The majority agreed upon the last Wednesday of every month, the time to be at 8:00pm. Dues were set at 25 cents per month, to be paid every month at the meetings. After some deliberation, the majority decided officers should be elected at the first meeting. An election took place with acting chairman, Betty Brand, accepting nominations for President first.\n\nThose nominated for President were:\n\nBetty Brand – nominated by Helen Mackey, second by Grace Melvin\n\nMarie Carter – nominated by Elaine Lewis, second by Louise Gillespy\n\nBallots were cast and the results were Betty Brand – 10, Marie Carter -8.\n\nNominations were then open for Vice President:\n\nJennie Dahl – nominated by Alice Haney, second by Grace Melvin\n\nCaroline Samuels – nominated by Helen Mackey, second by Doris Bowley\n\nHelen McWithey – nominated by Elaine Lewis, second by Betty Brand\n\nBallots were cast and the results were: Caroline Samuels – 8, Jennie Dahl – 5, Helen McWithey – 5\n\nNominations were open for Secretary:\n\nElaine Lewis – nominated by Jean Plummer, second by Helen McWithey\n\nDoris Bowley – nominated by Jennie Dahl, second by Grace Melvin\n\nBallots were cast and the results were Doris Bowley – 12, Elaine Lewis -6\n\nNominations were open for Treasurer:\n\nGeraldine Harke, nominated by Grace Melvin, second by Louise Gillespy\n\nMargery Arnold, nominated by Helen Mackey, second by Elaine Lewis\n\nMarie Carter, nominated by Helen Mackey, second by Betty Brand\n\nAlice Haney, nominated by Elaine Lewis, second by Jennie Dahl\n\nMabel Yorman, nominated by Jean Plummer, second by Helen McWithey\n\nMary Mackey, nominated by Marie Carter, second by Helen Mackey\n\nBallots were casts and the results were Margery Arnold – 5, Marie Carter – 3,\n\nGeraldine Harke – 3, Mabel Yorman – 3, Mary Mackey – 2, Alice Haney – 2\n\nIt was agreed that they would have light refreshments following each meeting. Refreshments should consist of a beverage and not more than two foods. These are to prepared by a committee which will be appointed at each meeting. The committee for refreshements for the June meeting were appointed: Doris Buck, Caroline Samuels, and Grace Melvin. The President appointed a delegate to accompany her to the Association meeting held in North Syracuse in June. Mrs. Helen Mackey was the delegate appointed. This ended the first meeting. Alice Haney made the motion to adjourn the meeting at 11:45 p.m. Grace Melvin seconded the motion.\n\nAuxiliary Charter Members:\n\nMargery Arnold, Doris Bowley, Betty Brand (Hanlon), Doris Buck, Marie Carter (Hand), Jennie Dahl, Louise Gillespy, Alice Haney, Geraldine Harke, Betty Jensen, Elaine Lewis, Helen Mackey, Mary Mackey, Helen McWithey, Grace Melvin, Caroline Samuels, Mebel Yorman (Younglove)\n\nJune 30th, 1948\n\nAt the second meeting of the auxiliary, by-laws were formed . Through the years, by –laws were changed many times, including the dropping of the word Ladies from the organization The auxiliary also joined the Onondaga County Auxiliary at North Syracuse, and joined the State Auxiliary in 1949. Delegates were appointed to the County and State. At this time, all members attended monthly county meetings, which were held at different firehouses\n\nJuly 28th, 1948\n\nAt the third meeting of the auxiliary, it was decided that the Vice President would send out get well cards. While the firemen worked on building the firehouse, the auxiliary helped by feeding the men, using the Brand’s house to do so. On Sundays, when the men would work on the firehouse all day, they were given their Sunday dinner. The meetings were held in their homes while the firehouse was constructed. The Auxiliary held card parties, white elephant sales, sold chances for a raffle, sold candy, held Dutch Maid and Stanley parties, and participated in many other fund raisers. During their first year, the auxiliary was able to purchase badges, raincoats, helmets and gloves for the firemen, as well as donating $100.00 through their various fund raising events. They had a good turn out no matter what the time or weather; if they were needed at the fire, they would be there as well.\n\nSeptember 10th, 1948\n\nHerald Journal Night Edition\n\nTruck knocks NYC Train off tracks\n\nA NEW YORK CENTRAL conductor is in St. Joseph’s Hospital following a spectacular crossing collision at Moyers Corners during a heavy thunderstorm yesterday afternoon. C.W. Wetmore, 63, who is reported in very good condition, was the only victim of the accident in which a tractor-trailer was demolished after toppling an engine and caboose and derailing four freight cars. Wesley L. Warren, 21, of Chicago, truck driver, escaped without injury, an outcome which state police describe as “miraculous”. Wetmore, who walked to the ambulance, suffered only bruises and possibly a fractured rib. THE ROUTE 31 crossing was cleared soon after the accident. Two cranes are in operation today as the railroad works to right the freight cars and engine and repair 200 feet of track. As an aftermath of: the accident two Baldwinsville youths were fined $25 each for looting. Warren told state police he was driving about 40 miles an hour west and did not see the engine because of the heavy rain. When he heard it, he applied his brakes which locked as he .slid along the road. The trailer jack-knifed striking the caboose behind the engine as the tractor struck the engine.\n\nNovember 23rd, 1948\n\nHerald Journal\n\nMoyers Corners New Fire House Is Near Completion\n\nThe Moyers Corners fire house, volunteer built and volunteer manned, is expected to be finished in time to keep the early snows off the department’s one pumper. Started two months ago and constructed in the spare time of community artisans, the two-story cinderblock building is no ready for roofing. The volunteers have worked mostly and night under floodlights. Carpenters, masons and other workers have donated what time they could to the project, and materials have been purchased at cost.\n\nThe land itself was a gift of Philip Brand, father of Kenneth Brand, fire chief. The story of the communal project goes back to last February (1947), when a fire burned a barn to the ground about a mile south of Moyers Corners. There was no fire department near enough to check the blaze. In the absence of an engine, all neighbors could do was form a bucket brigade. The loss of the barn started Kenneth Brand, Harold Lewis, the present assistant chief, and Paul McWithey, now treasurer planning a fire department of their own.\n\nThey launched a busy fund campaign, holding dances, field days and other events to raise the price of a pumper. They finally collected $600 bought the engine and housed it in a barn at the corners. Last May, they obtained from the Town of Clay, a one-year firefighting license which is expected to be renewed. Then Brand, Lewis McWithey, Chief Engineer Paul Marshall, Assistant Engineer Sewel Haney and Secretary Robert Buck got to work on a permanent house. The barn-like building will have a kitchen and meeting hall behind the engine space and a dance floor and stage upstairs for community gatherings. The main function of course will be to fight fires. There will be no more lost barns form lack of equipment, the volunteers assert.\n\n1949\n\nThe Moyers Corners Fire Department was tested early in their existence. On February 3, the snack shop and gas station that once held the dreams and frustrations of the locals caught fire. The building was owned by Harold Lewis who helped start the fire department in 1948. The fireman had to use gas masks, fight burning oil and alcohol, and encountered countless dangerous obstacles. It was a cold day and it last from nine in the morning until three in the afternoon. The women were serving coffee to the chilled firemen, and for a week after the fire, these women came to help clean up debris and salvage anything they could. Damage was estimated at $3,500 and was confined to the garage on the back of the service station. Philip Brand and Ken Brand Sr. were in charge of the operation.\n\nFebruary 3rd, 1949\n\nSyracuse Herald Journal\n\nOne Hurt In Blaze At Moyers\n\nA volunteer fireman suffered minor burns and a number of others escaped injury fighting a fire in a combined garage, gasoline filling station, restaurant, bus station and home at Moyers Corners this evening. Explosion of anti-freeze solution and cans of oil added to the confusion. Fireman Edward Karker of the Moyers Corners department, suffered burns on the hands when he was struck by a blazing timber. He was treated at the scene and refused to leave until the fire was out. The place is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Harold Lewis. They were in the restaurant section when a neighbor ran in to tell them the rear of the building was burning. Chief Kenneth Brand and his volunteers responded. Additional help came from Phoenix, Liverpool, and the New York Ordnance Works. Chief Brand said Lewis had recently received a 55 gallon drum of alcohol and the intense heat expanded the drum until it exploded and spilled its contents about the flooring to add fuel to the already rapidly spreading fire. This was followed by a series of firecracker explosions as cans of automobile engine oil exploded. Chief Brand said that for a time it appeared as though the building was doomed but the volunteers quickly brought the fire under control. The ordnance works sent one of its giant water tank trucks. Moyers Corners apparatus carried some 1,300 gallons and the volunteers from neighboring villages brought their own supplies. The fire wrecked the garage and living section of the building. Shortly before noon Lewis reported a cigar box containing money he had left in the bedroom was missing and fireman began searching through the debris for the money.\n\nIn the spring of 1949 the fire department received another call, but in a roundabout way. A grass fire got out of control within the area to be served by the department, but the new fire barn had no phone to call an emergency into. The call was made to the Clay Fire Department, who rushed over to Moyers Corners to tell them they had a fire. A far cry from the enhanced 911 system used today, through which each volunteer is notified instantaneously by pager and cell phone as a fire call goes out.\n\nTwenty fire calls were answered in their first year of service to the Town of Clay. It was discovered very shortly that the old 1922 American LaFrance couldn’t carry enough water to battle anything bigger than a small grass fire.\n\nOn April 14th, 1949 a second truck was purchased; this, a 1938 GMC oil tanker, 1500 gallon tank, was converted to hold water, and thereafter accompanied the American LaFrance on all its calls. The tanker was purchased by Tony Lewis. Total cost was $600.\n\nAuxiliary\n\nIn the Summer of 1949, under a tent that stood across from where Station 1 is today, the auxiliary held their first Field Days. In September of 1949, they held their first meeting at the new firehouse. The auxiliary joined the Onondaga County Auxiliary of North Syracuse, and later joined the New York State Auxiliary in May 1949.\n\nAugust 19th, 1949\n\nFlames Destroy Hay Baler Near Moyers Corners\n\nThe Post-Standard\n\nA fire which broke out in a straw bailer on the farm of Ernest Hlggs In the Moyers-Corners- Euclid road last week Tuesday afternoon destroyed the bailer and burned thru a straw stack and a cut field. Damage was estimated at more than $1,000 which reportedly was covered by Insurance. The fire was started by sparks from the balling machine, fire fighters said, and spread to the direction of the Higgs farm buildings. Approximately 30 firemen and neighbors brought the field fire under control before it reached the building area. They dug trenches around the field to control the spread of the fire. The fire In the stack and the bailer then was extinguished with the Moyers Corners volunteer fire department truck pump and hand pumps. The bailer was pulled from the straw stack by two tractors. The Moyers Corners truck was moved to the scene by N. E. Dahl who operates a garage and truck stop at Moyers Corners and his assistant, Walter Pientka. Later a tank truck was taken to the fire scene. From eight to 10 tons of straw were destroyed and the balling machine was damaged badly.\n\n1950\n\nNew Apparatus: Squad Car\n\nAuxiliary\n\nThey held the field days under tents on Elmcrest Road. They bought uniforms and accessories to start marching. The won first prize at Baldwinsville. All members marched with 2 girl scouts carrying the auxiliary banner. Barb Brand and Joanne Donohue used to carry the auxiliary banner for the marchers when they were girl scouts. In 1950, the Auxiliary gave the firemen $100.00 to purchase a 1.5” nozzle and new coats. Shortly after, they held a kitchen shower to stock their kitchen.\n\nJanuary 28th, 1950\n\nMoyers Corners responded mutual aid to Phoenix to the Phoenix Paper Mill. Vernon Thompson called it in to the Dahl’s Garage at 7 p.m. Moyers Corners arrived first. They laid 500 feet of 2.5” hose and 500 feet of 1.5” line and pumped from the river. Twenty five men responded under the direction of Chief Brand.\n\nMarch 16th, 1950\n\nLetter from William Arnold\n\nSecretary of the Moyers Corners Fire Department\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Philip Brand\n\nDear Sir and Madam,\n\nAs Secretary of the above named Fire Department, I have been designated to send you the official token of thanks and appreciation. The whole membership unites in expressing their gratitude for this additional gift of land. In case you never received an acknowledgement of the original gift that helped so much to make possible our present position, please accept this as it. We hope that it will always be remembered that Mr. and Mrs. Philip Brand gave us our building site and helped in every way possible to make the Moyers Corners Fire Department the success it is today.\n\nMay 9th, 1950\n\nThe Post-Standard\n\nMoyer’s Corners Blaze Is Quelled\n\nVolunteer firemen from two departments vainly fought a blaze which destroyed a carage and tool shed on the Veron Gaylord farm about one mile east of Moyers Corners on Route 31, for an hour and a half yesterday afternoon. However, the 4O men from the Moyers Corners and Clay departments saved a milk house, within a foot of the garage, and prevented spread of the fire to the cow barn and Gaylord home, which were threatened. The farm owner estimated tha fire loss at $1,900 and told it was covered partly by Insurance. Summoned to the scene about 2.45 p. m., the Moyers Corners firemen under Chief Kenneth Brand had to call for mutual aid from Clay for water. The combined departments worked one and a half hours bringing the fire under control. Cause of the fire was not known.\n\nJuly 5th, 1950\n\nPaul Dudley, son of charter member Willard Dudley was burned by hot water. First and second degree burns were encountered. He was rushed to the hospital by Cecil Gillespy.\n\n1951\n\nStrike It Rich!\n\nThe auxiliary now set out to purchase an ambulance. Always creative and ambitious, the ladies wrote to Warren Hull, informing him that they needed to raise money for this worthy cause. Mr. Hull invited them to be on his television program “Strike it Rich” in New York City.\n\nStrike It Rich was a controversial game show that aired on American radio and television from 1947 to 1958 on CBS and NBC. People in need of money (such as for medical treatment or a destitute family) appeared and told their tale of woe, then tried to win money by answering some relatively easy questions. If the contestant didn’t win any money, the emcee opened the “Heart Line”, which was a phone line to viewers who wished to donate to the contestant’s family. On May 1, 1950 the show moved to NBC where it aired on weekdays, sponsored by Colgate, until December 27, 1957. While a simple format, the show was controversial during the 11 years it aired. While some applauded Strike It Rich for helping out some less-fortunate people (as well as showcasing the sincere charity and good-will of viewers who donated through the Heart Line), others found it a sickening spectacle that exploited the less-fortunate contestants for the vicarious thrills of the viewers and the selfish gain of the sponsors. Part of the criticism was it promised more than it could deliver. Though the show received between 3,000 and 5,000 letters per week from needy people wishing to win what would be (to them) life-changing sums of money, only a small fraction of those could be selected; although this was partly due to the limits of television production (that the series, although ambitious in its goals, could not reasonably assist every person needing help at the same time), critics stated that the show picked mostly those thought to have the most interesting tales of woe.\n\nNine ladies went down to the big apple and were on the TV program, however they did not come back with the $500 prize they hoped for.\n\nSeptember 13th, 1951\n\nThe Post-Standard\n\nAuxiliary loses in radio quiz, but gifts up ambulance fund\n\nMoyers Corners Fire Department Auxiliary has added $105 to its ambulance fund as a result of its appearance on the “Strike It Rich” television program. Mrs. Budd Carter wrote a letter to the producer of the program, Walt Framer, telling him that the Auxiliary was engaged in a drive for money for an ambulance for the department, and an invitation to appear on the program was extended to her. Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Betty Brand, Mrs. Grace Melvin, Mrs. Helen Schmidt, Mrs. Norma Rosenberger, Mrs. Jennie Dahl, Mrs. Elaine Lewis, Mrs. Hazel VanDeusen, and Mrs. Arlene Merrihew appeared on the show sponsored by the Colgate-Palmolive Peet Co. Tuesday. The women gambled all their winning on their last question and lost. After the program Warren Hull, the master of ceremonies, informed Mrs. Carter that a call had come thru and an anonymous donor had contributed $105 to the $129.29 fund the women had already established. The question the women missed was “Was was Secretary of Defense before Marshall?”\n\nBy the way, the correct answer was Louis Arthur Johnson.\n\nWith the ever present hard work and fundraising, they raised the entire $500 needed to buy the ambulance. The auxiliary also helped to furnish the ambulance, and took over payments of the insurance. The auxiliary continued to pay for the insurance on the next three ambulances purchased by the department.\n\nJanuary 14th, 1951\n\nHerald Journal\n\nMoyers Corners Girl Crushed in Auto Crash\n\nKATHLEEN DAHL, 9, of Moyers Corners, died in St. Joseph’s Hospital last night after she was crushed between her father’s tow truck and a car on Route 31 about a mile east of Baldwinsville. Sheriff’s deputies said the child was searching for a flashlight between the two vehicles when the tow truck was hit by a skidding tractor-trailer. Newell Dahl, father of the youngster, and owner of Dahl’s Garage and Truck Slop in Moyers Corners, received a call at 10 P. M. to tow a car out of a ditch, according to the deputies. He took his daughter with turn, Dahl attached a chain to a car registered in the name of Mrs. Alice M. Soulo of Culvert St., Phoenix, and hauled it onto the shoulder of Route 31, off the highway deputies said. The vehicles were below the crest of a hill, alongside an ice covered patch on the road. Dahl’s daughter slipped in between the truck and the car to look for a flashlight. Deputies said a tractor-trailer, driven by John E. Hawkins, 49, of SI. Louis, Mo., came over 1he hill and saw Dahl waving another light as a warning. HAWKINS TOLD the deputies he hit his brakes and suddenly skidded out of control. The tractor-trailer jack-knifed and the trailer smashed into the front of the tow truck, pinning Dahl’s daughter between the truck and car. She was hurried by the Gates & Carier ambulance of Baldwinsville to St. Joseph’s Hospital at 10:40 P.M. She died five minutes later.\n\nJanuary 24th, 1951\n\nThe Post-Standard\n\nMoyers Corners Home Swept by Night Fire\n\nWind-lashed flames last night swept thru the bungalow home of Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Bogard in Wetzel Rd, about two and half miles outh of Moyers Corners. No one was injured. Fire Chief Kenneth Brand of the Moyers Corners Volunteer Fire Department said an oil stove explosion set off the blaze about 9:30 p.m. He said about 20 members of his own department responded to the alarm. When firemen arrived at the scene flames were pouring from all the windows of the five-room frame house. Mutual Aid was contacted and about 20 members of the Liverpool Fire Department responded with two pieces of apparatus. Bogart said the stove was in the dining room. When it exploded he threw a blanket over it and kicked out a window in an attempt to throw it out of the hosue. However, the heat forced him to abandon the plan. Flames spread instantly to the living room and kitchen and broke thru the ceiling into the sub-attic. Firemen prevented the blaze from going thru the roof. A house trailer about 10 feet from the building was only scorched. It had been used as a home for the Bogarts while they built their new home, which was still unfinished.\n\nMay 17th, 1951\n\nNeighbors Form Planting Party to Help Stricken Moyers Corners Farmer\n\nThe Post-Standard\n\nFarmers in the Moyers Corners section turned out yesterday to help Earl E. McWithey past planting time on his Route 57 farm after illness last Friday put him out of action. Eleven farmers were counted at one time on the farm north of Liverpool and two other men lent equipment to be used in preparing land for oats and corn. McWithey, who operates a general dairy farm, has been in bed since Friday. Lyman Melvin, a Moyers Corners area farmer, has been doing the milking and other farm chores and Tuesday night decided he would take over the planting operation. Other members of the Moyers Corners Volunteer Fire Department in which both McWithey and Melin are members decided they hould have a part. Working tractors on a back lot of the McWithey farm yesterday were lelvin, his son,. Edwin, and his brother, Howard; Robert Samuels, Hubert Schmidt and his son, Gustave Schmidt, Frederick Hoover, Valter Rosenberger, Harvey Bettiner, Frank Young, Jr. and Clifford ‘lumber. Some brought their own ractors and others had equipment borrowed from Henry Melvin of Baldwinsville and James Melvin. The work crew had help from the fire department auxiliary, including Mrs. Norma Kosenberger, Mrs. Grace Melvin, Mrs. Betty Brand, Mrs. Betty Jensen and Mrs. McWithey. The five women prepared dinner in the fire department and Mrs. Rosenberger and Mrs. Melvin assisted the men in the field hauling supplies and water in a pickup truck.\n\nDecember 10th, 1951\n\nThere was an ambulance call at Three Rivers Inn. It was called in by Tony Lewis at 10:10 pm. The ambulance arrived at the Fulton Hospital at 10:25 pm. They transported two patients. Driver of the ambulance was Ken Brand, attendants were Cecil Gillespy and Elaine Lewis. Female patient died after admittance.\n\n1952\n\nNew Apparatus:\n\nGMS/Sanford, ID 396, Assigned to Station 2\n\nFirst Ambulance 1942 Buick\n\nThe fire department continued to operate with the 1922 American LaFrance and the acquired 1942 oil tanker that was converted into a water truck. In 1952, Moyers Corners purchased their first brand new truck, a 1952 GMC/Sanford pumper, a “Jimmy” engine with a 500 gallon per minute pump and a 500 gallon tank. It manned two in the cab and four on the tailboard.\n\nTwenty five fire calls and thirty ambulance calls were answered in 1952.\n\nLater that year, the GMC was moved to Melvin’s barn on Rt 57, eventually to become Moyers Corners Station 2, located where the Wegman’s is today ) from 1960-1971. The GMC was the first Station Two engine company, and it serviced the Station Two response area up until 1981.\n\nThe auxiliary purchased the first ambulance for five hundred dollars. It was a 1942 Buick Ambulance. They took full responsibility for the ambulance including insurance and supplies for several years. . The first ambulance was used basically to pick up injured people and quickly transport them to the nearest hospital. There were emergency medical technicians or paramedics, no advanced equipment. Most treatment was done at the hospital. Ken Brand Sr., Bill Arnold and Cecil Gillespy were a few of the regular crew for the first ambulance.\n\nAs time progressed, advanced equipment was purchased.

C. J. (Pat) Rooney, Onondaga County sheriffs department, encountered last night when Louis Lutche, 53, Pennellville RD, suffered a serious heart attack near Carl’s Diner, Moyers Corners. Someone at the diner called the sheriff’s department for assistance, A doctor and an ambulance was needed immediately.\n\nRooney couldn’t fill the request, through no fault of his. He called Onondaga General Hospital. There was an ambulance there, but no doctor. That possibility was out, University and Grouse-Irving Hospital ambulances were out on other calls. He had no ambulance to send on the call. Trying to get help to the man as quickly as possible. Sgt. Rooney called the Moyers fire department ambulance and asked them to pick up the man and start for the city. He called sheriff’s prowl cars to hurry to the scene and give the ambulance an escort into the city. City police, monitoring the sheriffs calls arranged to have a motorcycle pick up the mercy cavalcade at the city limits. But Rooney’s job was only half done. He still didn’t have a doctor to attend the man, nor a hospital\n\nwhere he could be taken. He started calling hospitals. He called four hospitals before he could find a bed for the man. Finally he found Crouse-Irving Hospital had a bed for the heart attack victim, and a doctor available to administer to his needs. In the meantime the ambulance was picking up the man and heading for Syracuse, with the sheriff’s escort. The sheriffs department had lost no time in responding to the call, but encountered what deputy sheriffs say is a frequent block—no doctor, no ambulance available when it is urgently need.\n\nAt Crouse-Irving Hospital last night, Lutche was reported in critical condition. Sheriffs deputies and policemen of all echelons have heard much about the propsed new ambulance service which will make an emergency vehicle available at an. instant’s notice any time of the day or night. They would like to see it become a reality, and they would like to know that when “they risk their necks to respond to an emergency call to help someone, that they can also get u doctor in a reasonably short, time to give medical assistance if that in needed.\n\nNovember 10, 1953\n\nHerald Journal\n\nA FAMILY of eight was left homeless Sunday when fire destroyed their home at Horseshoe Island, Town of Clay.

Red Cross officials and Chief Kenneth Brand exchanged mutual documents of agreement. Now Red Cross has become the official administrator of the first aid station, a responsibility which entails the re-supplying of first aid equipment whenever necessary, and full cooperation with the volunteers who man the station.

It was described as the “biggest and best practice drill’ ever; staged by the county’s volunteer firemen.” The “fire” was discovered at 7-p.m. on the rool by s. member of the company fire team. At 7:03 the Lyncourt Department, in whose district the plant lies, got the alarm.\n\nSix minutes later Lyncourt firemen, under Chief Cliff Grunder, arrived.

Within two minutes he alerted the 14 other departments and got them rolling towards the plant. Twenty-one pieces of equipment, including pumpers, light trucks, ladder trucks and ambulances, sped to the scene. The firemen worked as if the plant was actually afire.

Automatic mutual aid for school fires, major or slight, is in effect at Liverpool, Lyncourt, Mattydale, North Syracuse, Baldwinsville, Moyers Corners, Phoenix and Fabius, Onondaga County Fire Coordinator Ernest Holmes of Liverpool said chiefs of the departments involved have worked out the plans among themselves. He added that the idea has “considerable merit, especially when schools are in session.” Although communities now having the mutual aid school protection all have fire departments in the northern section of Onondaga County, Holmes said he understands various communities in the western and southern portions have it under consideration. Should a fire break out in one of Liverpool’s schools, that village’s department would speed all of its apparatus to the scene. Mutual aid would be dispatched immediately from North Mattydale. In case of a school emergency in Lyncourt, aid would come from Mattydale, Hinsdale and North Syracuse. A school fire In Mattydale would bring additional help from North Syracuse, Hinsdale and Lyncourt. In North Syracuse, Mattydale, Cicero and Lyncourt would aid that village’s volunteer department. Baldwinsville would be aided by Liverpool and Phoenix; Moyers Corners would get help from Belgium-Cold Springs and Clay; Phoenix would be reinforced by firemen and apparatus from Baldwinsville and Liverpool.\n\nNovember 5th, 1955\n\nHerald Journal\n\nA delivery truck driver suffered cuts and bruises early today when his vehicle crashed into a ditch in the Town of Clay.

Mr. Brand received a plaque for the Moyers Corners Fire Department in recognition and appreciation for ambulance service for the Rescue Squad by their help in relaying patients from one point to another throughout New York State.\n\nNovember 3rd, 1960\n\nBaldwinsville Messenger\n\nMoyers Corners Vol. Fire Department Indignant Over False Statements\n\nChief Brand states that the Moyers Corners Vol. Fire Department, is not and never been affiliated with any political party, and never will. The Vol. Firemen of Moyers Corners Vol. Fire Dept. take issue with the completely false statements made by candidate for Town of Clay Councilman Richard M. White. First: Mr. White states that for a period of time there were areas in the Town of Clay without fire protection. This statement is completely false as anyone who attended the Fire contract meetings can testify Moyers Corners had a truck in temporary quarters near Bay berry on Route. 57 on Jan. 1 1960 on,” and the equipment at Moyers Corners was ready to and did respond to alarms in the south portion of the town. It is stated at these meetings that Moyers Corners would answer a call for any emergency in this section of the town under question as well their regular Fire District. Second: Mr. White claims that the Town Board action threatened the existence of the entire Mutual Add system, is completely false as only threat to the Mutual Aid system came from the Chief of the Liverpool Fire Department, who refused to answer Mutual Aid calls in the Town of Clay, unless Liverpool had had a fire contract with a certain area in the Town of Clay.\n\nThis act stunned many of the surrounding departments who immediately reassured Moyers Corners that they would be available if needed on mutual aid calls. Thirdly: Mr. White claims that because of changes made to the Town Board that two fire departments within the Town of are near Bankruptcy. This can only be meant as a slur on the integrity of the whole of Moyers Corners Fire Dept. as we are one of the only two Depts in the Town of Clay. This statement alone provokes us to refute the statements made by Richard White by which he has attempted to undermine and destroy the faith of our Dept. in the minds of the residents and people we are happy to serve and protect in the Town of Clay. Far from being near bankruptcy, our Dept. is proud of having one of the highest credit ratings in the County, Why do we have one of the best credit ratings? Because the membership of our Dept. not only volunteers time for fire, ambulance and emergency calls, but has since the organization of our Dept. until the year 1960, has by their own initiative and fund raising activities supplied well over half the annual budget of the Dept. The year 1960 we received $8,000.00 from the Town under our new five year contract which guarantees an annual increase and so only had to raise $6,500 by our own activities. We are proud of the fact that last spring when we had a brand new 1000 gal. tanker pumper, 750 gal. per hr. delivered that we were completely solvent, by not owing a cent to anybody. Our equipment at that time included one of the most fully equipped ambulances (only two years old) in the County, one 500 gal. pumper and one 1000 gal. tanker. Besides our large strategically located firehouse at Moyers Corners.\n\nWe feel that by trying to involve the Vol. Fire Depts in Politics, that Richard White has done a great disservice to all Vol. Firemen in the County, but specifically in the Town of Clay. Chief Brand again wants to make it clear that we do not intend to be affiliated with any political party, but cannot sit idly by and allow the above act of slurs or slander go un-refuted.

Also at that time, Onondaga County started Fire Dispatch Service allowing for radios to be placed in Ken Brand’s car and the GMC pumper. The members could be dispatched through Fire Control to their Plectrons.

In a letter to the village, the DPW requested that the village raise the level of all manholes and water shutoff boxes in the street by 2inches to accommodate an asphalt surface of the same thickness. The state said it would install stabilized shoulders on the outer reaches of E. Genesee St. as part of the project. It was also reported by letter at last (Wednesday) night’s meeting of the board that Gates Funeral Home has as of March 1 discontinued its emergency ambulance service. The letter from, Ralph Gates advised the board that the Moyers Corners fire department ambulance is available, as well as Eastern Ambulance.\n\nWIN TROPHY\n\nMoyers Comers Ladies Auxiliary push ball team was awarded the county trophy at the county meeting at Belgium – Cold Spring fire house on Tuesday evening. This trophy is awarded to the team with the most points at the end of the field days season. Memphis, Liverpool, and Moyers Corners, tied for points. On Thursday evening of last week the three teams had a playoff at Fairmount with Moyers Corners, winning.\n\n1962 Grass Fire Engine 1\n\nAlso, at the time, Onondaga County was starting a Fire Dispatch service. Ken Brand was one of the first Fire Chiefs to have a new radio in his car. The GMC Engine at Station Two had a radio installed as well. The members could now be dispatched through Fire Control to their home receivers called Plectrons. This increased the response rate a great deal. At some point, calls are starting to be dialed in through fire control using 454-3211 or 652-6111. Fire Control then alerts the MCFD by radio KQP 681 Station one or KQP 680 Station 2. Each member has a plectron receiver in their home on which a tone is set off.\n\nAs additional growth occurred in the Station Two response area, and commercial development impacted the Oswego Road/ Route 57 corridor, the need for a new fire station increased. In 1962, Station Two was relocated to a double bay station on Morgan Road, near the intersection of Buckley Road. With the development of the Bayberry residential section, it was realized that fire protection for this area was inadequate. One of the members owned a barn near the corner of 57/John Glenn, and donated its use as a fire station.\n\nSeptember 3rd, 1962\n\nThe Post-Standard\n\nFlames engulf Morgan Road Barn\n\nFlames lick the fiamewOrk of a bain on Moigan Road, noith ol Liverpool, as Moyers Corners and Clay firemen stiuggle lo save the structure.

Owner Henry Tutor of 815 Oswego Blvd. estimated the damage at more than $100,000. The first alarm was turned in to the Moyers Corners Volunteer Fire Department by neighbors at 5:45 a.m. The Liverpool Fire Department was called upon their arrival at the blaze, which was raging out of control. Moyers Corners Fire Chief Kenneth Brand estimated that the fire had started about an hour prior to the first alarm. The origin of the fire, according to Brand, is unknown. The Belgium Cold Springs volunteers were called about 6:15 a.m. When the Liverpool volunteers arrived, they were forced to wait about 20 minutes, Liverpool Fire Chief Robert Heid said, while the water authority boosted the pressure for the hydrant. The restaurant was housed in a converted barn. Chief Brand said the fire was out of control and had made its way through the roof of the structure by the time he was called. The three fire depart-ments could not get the inferno under control and it lit up the skies until shortly after 7 a.m. The last person , apparently, who was in the building, said Brand, was Tutor, who allegedly left for home shortly after 3 a.m. The Moyers Corners Fire Department called the Liverpool and Cold Springs firemen under the mutual aid pact. Under this agreement, one fire company may call another to the scene when, at the discretion of the fire chief, the one department can not handle the blaze by itself. In this case, Moyers Corners supplied three trucks, Liverpool responded with another three f pumpers, and Cold Springs one, The Cold Springs and Liverpool volunteers left the scene soon a f t e r the fire had b e e n brought under control. The Moyers Comers firemen remained until 9:30 a.m. to completely extinguish the smoldering remains of the building.\n\n1964\n\nApril 10th, 1964\n\nThe Post – Standard\n\nBrand Names Moyers Chief\n\nThe Moyers Corners Volunteer Fire Department has elected Kenneth Brand as its chief.

Daniel Kirk of 257 Oswego Road was injured by falling glass and was taken to a doctor. He received 10 stitches to close a wound in his arm. Kirk was reaching through a broken window when the glass fell and cut him. The fire, which began in a closet, probably had burned several hours before a passerby saw the flames and turned in the alarm during the afternoon, according to Moyers Corners Fire Chief Kenneth J. Brand. Mrs. Esther Mecca who lives at the house was not home at the time. The closet and clothing were destroyed, Brand said. Smoke damage to the house was considerable. No estimate of damage was available. Brand said the fire was confined to the house, one of a series of townhouses on Candlelight Lane. He said firefighters extinguished the blaze within 45 minutes after arriving at the scene. The Cold Springs Fire Department stood by as Moyers Corners firemen answered the call.\n\nSeptember 29th, 1967\n\nLetter to the Town of Clay\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAs the community has grown rapidly in the past few years, we also have to plan and grow with it. We will try to explain as best and quickly as possible several of the items on our attached proposed five year budget. We now have on order a new 80’ Snorkel, which we expect to receive about February of 1969. This is a 71k item plus equipment. Also out for bid is a 1500 GPM pumper. This truck will cost around 40k, which we will receive around September 1968. Both of the above mentioned will need about 5k worth of equipment, such as hose, coats, boots, etc.\n\nOur #2 firehouse in the past has been made available to us through the generosity of Mr. Ed Melvin. We understand this has or soon will be sold. Looking to the future, to assure the public of continued reliable protection, may be required to purchase land and erect a new firehouse.\n\nOur new Rescue Truck was purchased by 5,100 from the General Account (Taxpayer money), and the balance 16,300 from our hard earned Bingo money (not taxpayer money), We now have on order a new ambulance, which also helps give the Town citizens some of the finest protection available. This with no cost to the taxpayer except whatever they feel they can afford, or through their own generosity.\n\nSeptember 1967\n\nAnnual Fund Drive Letter\n\nThe annual fund drive of the Moyers Corners Volunteer Fire Department will be conducted on the above listed dates. This is your opportunity to say “thank you” for the many house the volunteers have given for the protection of you, your friend and neighbors. All contributions are used to provide free ambulance service for you and all residents in the area serviced by the department; which emergency apparatus responds to approximately 450 calls per year. An annual budget of $5,000 is necessary to maintain, operate and provide for replacement of this equipment, none of which can be raised through taxes.\n\nWe would like to point out at the time, WE ARE A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION AND ARE DEPENDENT UPON YOU FOR THE SUPPORT OF THIS MUCH NEEDED SERVICE. Your cooperation in this project will be sincerely appreciated by contributing as generously as possible when your volunteer calls on you; anything you may contribute is tax deductible.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nKen Brand, Chief\n\n1968\n\nApril 11, 1968\n\nHerald Journal\n\nFiremen tap Brand Again\n\nThe Moyers Corners Volunteer Fire Department has elected officers for 1968.

Two 1969 members of the Post later became members of the fire department, Fred Harke III (the third generation of Harke dedication to the fire department) and Bob Michelson. In November of 1969, several members of the Post assisted in a search for a lost hunter in a dense spruce swamp area between Utica and Old Forge. In the early 70’s several members of the Post participated in the search in the Adirondacks for Douglas Legg, the young son of Liverpool High School science teacher William Legg. Unfortunately neither of these individuals was ever found.\n\nJanuary 30th, 1969\n\nThe Post-Standard\n\nMysterious Oven Fire Investigated\n\nHouse Fire Burns Woman Trying to Turn off Stove\n\nBy Robert Andrews\n\nMoyers Corners Fire Chief Kenneth Brand, left, and his assistant, Sy Bart, look over remain;; of an oven which caught fire at the home of Mr. and Mi’s. Martin TDwusond, The fire, which, started -when some food on the stove caught fire, caused more than $4,0*0 worth of damage to the two-story frame dwelling. Chief Brand said his office was unable to determine at the time whether the fire was caused by an electrical failure in the oven or by spattering grease. Mrs. Barbara Townsend was burned in the fire.\n\nARTICLE\n\nA Moyers Corners woman was badLy burned last night when she dashed into the middle of her fire-engulfed kitchen to turn off a stove. Mrs. Barbara Townsend was observed by witnesses running from her smoke-filled home on Oswego Road, Moyers Corners, covering her face with her hands. She was transported by Moyers Corners Ambulance to St. Joseph’s Hospital where she was treated for first degree burns and released.\n\n“I don’t know what she thought she was trying to do by going back In there,” commented Moyers Corners Fire Chief Kenneth Brand. Quick action by members of the Moyers Corners Volunteer Fire Department prevented the fire from spreading outside the kitchen. More than 30 members of the fire department responded to the fire, which was reported at 7 p.m. Most of the volunteer firemen were supervising a bingo game at the fire barn when the fire was reported. Chief Brand said most of the damage was done to the walls, calling and cupboards In the kitchen. The fire started, according to Chief Brand, when Mrs. Townsend left her stove to go . jnto the living room and watch television. While she was watching television, the food on the stove burst Into flames. Her husband immediately called the fire department and helped evacuate three other persons from the home. None of the other parsons in the home were injured. Owner of ihe home is Dr. John Trapanil, who presently lives in Downey, Calif.

The station eventually housed the GMC Jimmy Engine Company, the 1963 and 1976 Hahn Engines, and the 1969 ALF Aerial Truck. In 1976, the 1963 Hahhn was replaced by one of the two 1976 Hahns. As the run volume increased, and as Fire Station Two membership expanded, so did the need for a modern emergency response quarters. In early 1971 Moyers Corners was one of the first departments in the county to purchase a new, innovative, high powered, hydraulic extrication tool called a Hurst Tool. This was later to be nicknamed “The Jaws of Life”. Because of this equipment, MCFD’s Rescue was called to many auto accidents in surrounding fire districts to effect more rapid extrication of accident victims.\n\n1972\n\nChief Edwin Viel\n\nFirst Assistant Chief: Cecil Gillespy\n\nSecond Assistant Chief Robert French\n\n*Lieutenants (First Year for Lieutenants at MCFD): 1st Lieutenant Art Bump, 2nd Lieutenant Robert Casler, 3rd Lieutenant Phil Guinta, 4th Lieutenant Dave Dirk, 5th Lieutenant Fred Liebi, 6th Lieutenant Ken Brand Jr.\n\nExecutive Board\n\nPresident Royal Mosher\n\nVice President Roy Smith\n\nSecretary Leo Pachek, Assistant Secretary Steve Rubacky\n\nTreasurer Don Gates\n\nFire Police: Captain Company 1 Leo McWithey, Company 2 Will Michelson\n\nNew Apparatus: 1972 Ambulance, Cadillac, Pre-1975 ID 399.\n\nChet Fritz: Heritage Fire: I have a photo of the late Phil Guinta and I receiving the Onondaga County Judges medal for a fire rescue made at a Heritage Park apartment fire some years ago.

Phil and I dragged him down stairs and out into the street where we both gave him mouth-to-mouth until he regained consciousness and was transported to a hospital. The thing that made this somewhat challenging was that Mike stood 6’5″ and weighed in excess of 300 pounds.\n\nIn 1972, The Moyers Corners Fire Department was the first department in the county to have a cardiac ambulance. By 1979, the ambulance had some of the latest advances in cardiac equipment. With this equipment came many hours of training.

Mr. Fichter, his wife Beatrice and their son Thomas were released from St. Joseph’s Hospital after treatment. Fichter had arm and head cuts and his son third degree hand burns and minor cuts. Mrs. Fichter was treated for shock. Firefighters from the Moyers Corners Volunteer Fire Department said that when they arrived the blaze had a big start due to a delay before the alarm was called in. Neighbors who first noticed the fire said it spread so quickly they elected to help the Fichters out of the house immediately, rather than take the time to call firemen first. A neighbor, Mrs. Harry Honan, said that she and her daughter were looking out their front window about 7am waiting for a car which was supposed to take the girl to a swim meet in Ithaca. Mrs. Honan said that smoke suddenly began coming from the house and, within seconds, “was all over the place, so black and thick you couldn’t believe it.” She saw Thomas Fichter leap from a second story window, and quickly ran across the street to assist him, while her daughter called neighbors living adjacent to the Fichter home to warn them that there was a fire that might spread. Harry Honan and several other neighbors were at the Fichter house within moments, and put up a ladder to help the family out of the burning home. Mr. Honan turned in the fire alarm before running across the street, his wife said. The Ficthers made their way to their garage roof, and from there hurried down the ladder. Two daughters, 16 and 11 years old, and a nine-year-old son escaped uninjured, firemen said. Damage was estimated at $28,000. Firemen are investigating the origin of the blaze.\n\nApril 26th, 1972\n\nBaldwinsville Messenger\n\nKathy Kelsey, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Richard Kelsey, suffered minor burns to her face and neck last week.

Has Colorful History\n\nPlans are currently underway up the road a piece for a rather special celebration: the 25th Anniversary of the Moyers Corners Volunteer Fire Department. A gentleman named Ken Brand, Sr. got the ball rolling on November 9, 1947, the day his garage burned down. You see, it never would have burned all the way, if all the fire companies in the area hadn’t been so late showing up. The story has it that Ken threw his hat on the ground as hard as he could and proclaimed that, “By God, we’re gonna get a fire department here!”. And they did, that very day. Of course, it wasn’t much of a fire department. The first five members (Ken Brand, Ed Harke, Sr., Paul Marshall, Ed Melvin, and Lymon Melvin) formed the nucleus, and shortly were joined by another half-dozen concerned men. For several months the only function of the new department was to meet occasionally and try to figure out how and where to obtain a fire truck.\n\nThen, along about March of 1948, Fate stepped in and lent a friendly hand. On March 12, Ken was helping out at his friend Tony Louis’s gas station, when a man pulled in with car trouble. During the course of conversation it developed that the man was in a hurry to get to Canton, NY to make an appointment with some prospective buyers of a fire engine he was selling.\n\n“A what?” said Ken.\n\n“A fire engine, “ said the stranger.\n\n“Mister, I think you just found your buyers. Don’t go away, I’ll be right back!” and with those words, Ken took off to round up the rest of the volunteers.\n\nWell, to make a long story short, they bought the fire engine. It wasn’t a new one..a 1922 American LaFrance could hardly be called ‘new’ when it was 26 years old..but the price was right. The next day a crew drove to Buffalo to take possession of their first piece of firefighting equipment. All of this happened so fast that no preparation had been made to house the new truck, so for the next few months it was kept in Louis’s gas station. In May, construction was started on a fire barn. All of the work was done by the firemen, mostly at night, after their regular jobs, and by that winter the new truck had a permanent home. In the spring of ’49, the fire department got its first call, but in kind of a roundabout way. A grass fire got out of control within the area to be served by the department, but the new fire barn had no phone to call an emergency into. So the call was made to the Clay Fire Department, who rushed over to Moyers Corners to tell them they had a fire. A far cry from the Fire control system used today, thru which each volunteer is notified instantaneously at home as soon as a fire call goes out.\n\nThat first year about 20 fire calls were answered (compared to an average of 175 a year now!). It was discovered very shortly that the old LaFrance couldn’t carry enough water to battle anything bigger than a small grass fire, so in 1949 a second truck was purchased; this, a 1942 oil tanker, was converted to hold water, and thereafter accompanied the LaFrance on all its calls. The department continued to grow. A ladies auxiliary was formed, which took on the job of procuring an ambulance. Rather than go the raffle and bake sale route, the ladies decided to make an all-out effort, and arranged to appear on the then-popular N.Y. quiz show, “Strike It Rich”. They build the prize money up to $1000, but managed to answer only four of the five questions necessary to win it all. They returned with a meager $100. Undaunted, they scraped up $400 more, and shortly thereafter, a third piece of equipment joined the ranks: a 1942 Buick ambulance, which responded to about 30 calls its first year of operation (compared to over 600 last year). The first new fire truck was purchased two years later, in 1953. This was a GMC pumper, and still functions today, though primarily as a backup unit.\n\nA community grows, and with it, the number of potential emergencies. Many communities, as they grow, fall behind in their ability to deal with these emergencies. Not so Moyers Corners. They proudly boast of having one of the best-equipped fire departments in the county, and well they should: from a humble beginning of a used pumper operating out of a gas station, they now have grown to 7 fire trucks (an eighth is soon to be purchased) including a 80-foot Snorkel unit, plus an ambulance, housed in two fire barns (the original one at Moyers Corners and a second one on Morgan Road in Bayberry). With this equipment (and the 90 men who man it), they cover emergency calls north as far as the county line, south to the Liverpool line, east to Euclid, and west to the Seneca River. And they do it fast and they do it well. Happy 25th, firemen.\n\nJuly 14th, 1972\n\nJudge Ormand N.

Gary A. Rohrmann, 22, of 7844 Glenwood Dr., Liverpool, was alone in his car, heading south on Rte. 57 about 11:15 p.m. when the car left the road, Clay police said. The vehicle uprooted one tree, sideswiped another, and rammed into a third, police said. Rohrmann was pronounced dead at the scene. The car was demolished, and the Moyers Corners Rescue Squad had to use blow torches and cutting tools to free the victim. According to Policeman Paul Carlson, Rohrmann was wearing a seat belt. The accident occurred about one mile south of Moyers Corners. It brings the county 1972 traffic death toll to 65, and is the first fatality in the Official Christmas weekend traffic tally in the county, which began 6 p. m, last night. Rohrmann was employed as a sprinkler installer by the Hoffman & Walker Co. A native of Hastings, he resided in Liverpool for the past two years. He was a Sergeant in the Air National Guard’s 174th Tactical Squadron at Hancock Field.\n\n1973\n\nAuxiliary: President Alice Haney, Vice President Joanne Donohue, Secretary Clara Marshall, Correspondence Secretary Betty Hanlon, Treasurer Joyce Bressette\n\nNew Apparatus: 1973 Haun, designated 394.

Clary Patrolman Richard L. Worden said a fire truck owned by Moyers Corners Fire Department and drivin by Charles DeVaul of Liverpool was answering a fire alarm on Avon Path when the accident occurred. DeVaul told police he was heading south on Morgan Road with the truck’s flashing lights and siren in operation. He said he signaled to make a right onto Grampian road when the collision occurred with a car operated by Leonard Bottorff of 68 Cheshire Road, Liverpool. Injured were Donna Maria Bottorff, 19, and Krista Bottorff, 9 months. Both were taken to Memorial for treatment. DeVaul suffered chest and rib injuries, and Richard Spiess of 227 Buckley Road, a passenger on the fire truck, was treated for chest pain. Both were taken to St. Joseph’s Hospital. Worden issued Bottorff tickets on charges of following an emergency vehicle too closely and failure to yield the right of way to an emergency vehicle.\n\nPictures\n\nJanuary 21st, 1973\n\nInvalid In Trailer Fire Saved\n\nUnknown Publication/Author\n\nAn invalid a was carried by firemen and neighbors to safety from his burning trailer park home yesterday, police said.
