Strength: Approximately 280 ADF personnel including, 96 RAAF personnel with the UNMOGIP Air Unit with an RAAF DHC-4 Caribou (1975 â 79) provided from 38 Squadron. Area of Operations (AO): India, Pakistan and Kashmir. Purpose: The first group of United Nations military observers arrived in the mission area on 24 January of 1949 to supervise the ceasefire between India and Pakistan in the State of Jammu and Kashmir. These observers, under the command of the Military Adviser appointed by the UN Secretary-General, formed the nucleus of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). Following renewed hostilities of 1971, UNMOGIP has remained in the area to observe developments pertaining to the strict observance of the ceasefire of 17 December 1971 and report thereon to the Secretary-General. Australia provided 6 man Observer teams serving one or two year tours of duty. During the Vietnam War, Army reservists were used to man the contingent, as the armyâs resources were stretched fighting in the Vietnam War. Comments: Of note, the first and longest serving commander of UNMOGIP was Australian Major General (later Lieutenant General), R.H. Nimmo CBE, who was appointed the Chief Military Observer (CMO) UNMOGIP in October 1950, and he remained in command until his death on 4 January 1966. His 15 year command is a UN record and one unlikely to ever be broken. In March 1975 to January 1979, an RAAF DHC-4 Caribou from the 38th Squadron, comprising 12 men, conducted operations in support of UNMOGIP on 6-month rotations. In 1985 the contingent was withdrawn because the government considered Australia was overcommitted to the UN at that time.

Deployment included one Aircraft Carrier (HMAS Sydney), two destroyers, two Infantry Battalions with supporting arms and services, and a RAAF Fighter Squadron with supporting services. Area of Operations (AO): Korea and in some cases Japan. Purpose: UNC-K was the UNâs first peace restoration (peacemaking) operation. The operation was in response to the North Korean invasion of South Korea in an attempt to force re-unification of the peninsula. An armistice was concluded in 1953. Comments: Australiaâs largest combined service operation since the Second World War.

The men were murdered by guerrillas of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP), an outgrowth of the anti-Japanese guerrilla movement which had emerged during the Second World War. Australiaâs involvement in the Emergency began in 1950 with the arrival of RAAF aircraft and personnel in Singapore. Dakotas from 38 Squadron were deployed on cargo runs, troop movements, and paratroop and leaflet drops in Malaya, while six Lincoln bombers of1 Squadron provided the backbone of air operations. By October 1955, when the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian 6 Version 4 â 3 May 2020\n\nP:08\n\nRegiment (2RAR), arrived in Penang, the outcome of the Emergency was no longer in doubt, although a lengthy âmopping upâ stage followed, largely undertaken by Australian troops. Over the next 20 months, as part of 28 Commonwealth Brigade, 2RAR participated in a variety of operations, mainly in Perak, one of the main areas of communist activity. Their work consisted of extensive patrolling, watching for contacts in the rubber plantations, and mounting a perimeter guard on the New Villages, settlements which the government had established to provide infrastructure and services in outlying areas in the hope of denying the guerrillas access to their support base. Contacts were rare, however, and the battalion had a mixed record, killing two communists in an ambush on 25 June 1956 but losing three of its own troops. Lasting 13 years, the Malayan Emergency was the longest continuous military commitment in Australiaâs history until recent times. Thirty-nine Australian servicemen were killed in Malaya, although only 15 of these deaths occurred as a result of operations, and 27 were wounded, most of whom were in the army.

Deployment Dates: 1956 to ongoing. Strength: Total estimated to be 700. 12 personnel at any given time. Continual 12 month tours. Area of Operations (AO): Syria (including the Golan Heights) Amman â Jordan, Beirut â Lebanon, Cairo and Ismalia â Arab Republic of Egypt (ARE), Gaza, Damascus, Tiberius â Israel, Naquoura, Nahariya, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Purpose: In April 1948, a Truce Commission was established to supervise the various armistices and truces after the first Arab-Israeli War. In mid-June 1948 military observers were added to the Commission and UNTSO was formed, becoming an independent observer mission in mid-August 1949. UNTSO has continued to supervise subsequent ceasefires after the 1956, 1967, 1973 and 1982 Arab- Israeli Wars. UNTSOâs area of operations covers Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Jordan and Egypt. Australiaâs involvement in the mission commenced in 1956. Comments: Commanded by Australian Major General Tim Ford from 1998 to 2000. Australians serving with the Observer Group Lebanon have been kidnapped and maltreated by irregular militias. UNTSO remains as the UNâs (and Australiaâs), longest ever peacekeeping mission. Died: 1 â On 12 January 1988, Captain Peter McCarthy, Royal Australian Corps of Transport, became the twenty-second UNTSO soldier to die on deployment when his jeep was blown up by a landmine during a patrol in southern Lebanon.

This deployment lasted from 1950 â 1963. 13 Version 4 â 3 May 2020\n\nP:15\n\nA year before the last force toured Malaya, marked the first involvement of Australia in the Vietnamese War, when the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) arrived in South Vietnam in July 1962. It would begin what was at the time Australia's longest involvement in conflict, with over 60,000 Australians serving, 521 killed and more than 3,000 wounded. Not only was the guerrilla warfare new to the Australian personnel (who were relatively well trained in jungle warfare compared with the US), but the involvement in the war was both socially and politically different than what had been experienced by their predecessors in the first two World Wars, with a rise in draft resistance, conscientious objection and protesting taking place back home. Many veterans met a hostile reception with the Australian public due to the questioning of their involvement in the conflict, which was driven by fear of communism spreading in south-east Asia. Australia's support of South Vietnam was aligned with the policies of the US, which was also concerned with the spread of communism, and at the request of the US in 1965, Australia committed more troops to the cause. The 1st Battalion RAR was deployed in June of that year to serve alongside the US 173rd Airborne Brigade in Bien Hoa, and then boosted in 1966 by a taskforce of conscripts from the National Service Scheme, which had been introduced a few years before. Between 1965 and 1971, all nine RAR battalions would serve in the taskforce, and in 1966, a company from 6RAR was involved in Australia's most well known battle of the war, in Long Tan. In that skirmish, a group of 108 from 6RAR held off an estimated group of over 2,000 Viet Cong, which indefinitely stalled an imminent movement against Australia's base of operations at Nui Dat. The battle resulted in nearly 250 dead for the Viet Cong, compared with 17 Australians killed in action and 25 wounded. By the end of 1970, Australia's involvement in Vietnam started to de-escalate due to a number of reasons, including the apparent difficulty of claiming a significant victory due to the nature of guerrilla warfare, as well as the rising opposition of Australia's involvement from the Australian public. Australia's participation in the Vietnam War was formally declared over when then governor-general Paul Hasluck issued a proclamation in January 1973, with the last remaining combat infantry remaining to guard the Australian embassy in Saigon until June of that year.

Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) The Mission was established in March 1964 in an attempt to prevent the recurrence of fighting between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots and, as necessary, to contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return to normal conditions. Since the hostilities of 1974, the mandate has included supervising the cease-fire and maintaining a buffer zone between the lines of the Cyprus National Guard and of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot forces to prevent further fighting between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots on the island. Primarily a police deployment, the AFP provides 15 officers on yearly rotation to the 20-nation force which serves in policing, military and civilian roles. The policing contingent oversees law enforcement within the buffer zone between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. AFP officers also support the civil affairs branch of the mission to deliver humanitarian services and assist the military branch maintain the integrity of the buffer zone. Comments: From 1964 to 1976 all Australian Police Forces contributed volunteer personnel to the UN Force in Cyprus. From 1976 the Commonwealth Police took over the role until 1979 when the duty passed to the newly created AFP.UNFICYP was originally set up by the Security Council in 1964 to prevent further fighting between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. After the hostilities of 1974, the Council has mandated the Force to perform certain additional functions. In the absence of a political settlement to the Cyprus problem, UNFICYP has remained on the island to supervise ceasefire lines, maintain a buffer zone, undertake humanitarian activities and support the good offices mission of the Secretary-General. In November 2018, Australian Major General Cheryl Pearce was appointed as Force Commander on the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. Last Name First Names Pearce (McDonald) Cheryl Commonwealth Monitoring Force Rhodesia (CMFR) Operation AGILA Australian Deployment Dates: 1 December 1979 to 2 March 1980. Strength: Australian Army contingent of 152 all ranks. Area of Operations (AO): Rhodesia / Zimbabwe. Purpose: In December 1979, the CMFR was established by the Commonwealth to supervise the implementation of the Lancaster House Agreement between the government of Southern Rhodesia and the guerrilla forces of the Patriotic Front. Under the agreement, UK authority was restored over its rebellious colony and a ceasefire 27 Version 4 â 3 May 2020\n\nP:29\n\nimplemented. A general election followed and independence was achieved by the new Republic of Zimbabwe. The role of the multi-national force was to keep the peace between 22,000 guerrillas and the Rhodesian forces during the cease-fire run-up to the 1980 elections. The CMFR was tasked with monitoring the agreement and resembled a UN observer mission except that its duties were more extensive, it enjoyed municipal backing. Comments: The Australians were largely spread throughout the force, which consisted of a HQ and 3 Groups. The CMFR were armed as well as conducting the monitoring of the ceasefire and elections.

Strength: 1,152 personnel (1982-1986) consisting 8 UH-1H helicopters with 144 personnel on six-month tours. 5 Army and 2 RAAF officers worked at HQ MFO. Approximately 676 personnel (1993 to present) 26 -strong contingent at HQ MFO. Area of Operations (AO): The Arab Republic of Egypt (ARE), and Israel. Purpose: Operation Mazurka is Australiaâs contribution to the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) in the Sinai. The MFO was established in 1981 to oversee the Camp David Accords of 1978 and the Egypt/Israel Peace Treaty of 1979. Under the Accords, Israel withdrew from the Egyptian territory it had occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. The MFO was created outside the framework of the UN because the Soviet Union was opposed to UN involvement. The MFO is governed by the US State Department and is headquartered in Rome. Comments: Australia and New Zealand contributed to the MFO at the outset by providing the Forceâs Rotary Wing Aviation Unit (RWAU). The ADF provided a joint RAN/Army/RAAF detachment, comprising 8 UH-1H helicopters. The Contingent was withdrawn in April 1986 as the government sought to reduce Australiaâs peacekeeping commitments. 28 Version 4 â 3 May 2020\n\nP:30\n\nOn 8 January 1993, the ADF returned to the Sinai again. A 26 strong contingent of HQ staff and MPâs initially on 12 month tours, then reduced to 6 â 9 month tours, re-joined the MFO following a review of the governmentâs position. Primarily the Australians assist in the peace process by monitoring the border and preparing daily operational briefings, and support to the Headquarters. In addition to these staff functions, they undertake an important force training function that includes physical training.

Strength: 60. Area of Operations (AO): Iran. Purpose: In early August 1988 the UN established UNIIMOG to supervise the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq at the end of their eight year long war, known as the First Gulf War. Australiaâs involvement began with the temporary secondment of an observer from UNTSO, followed by a fifteen-man contingent from Australia four days later, on 16 August. All the Australians served on the Iranian side of the ceasefire line because Iraq vetoed an Australian presence in Iraqi held territory. This was because an Australian government scientist, Dr Peter Dunn, was a member of the UN team that had proved Iraqi use of chemical weapons during three inspections in the 1984-87 period. Comments: UNIIMOG service was particularly arduous due to a combination of a volatile ceasefire, climatic extremes, harsh terrain, primitive operational conditions, and the stress and social deprivation experienced by Westerners in a fundamentalist Islamic society. The Australian contingent were unarmed United Nations Military Observers (UNMO).

Strength: 613 total comprising two rotations. Contingents consisted of Royal Australian Engineers from 17 Construction Squadron, one RAAF officer, 5 Military Police, and a 3 person Royal Australian Signals Detachment. Area of Operations (AO): Namibia. Purpose: In April 1989, the UN established UNTAG in Namibia, South Western Africa, and to a limited extent in neighbouring countries. This was to supervise the return of refugees, the holding of a general election, the withdrawal of South African forces and Namibiaâs transition to independence. The Australians were armed only with personal weapons during the entire mission. Comments: The Australian Contingent mainly consisted of Army Engineers. From 26 October to 20 November 1989, the Australian Electoral Commission provided an electoral organisation expert and 27 electoral supervisors. The Australian Federal Police contributed a fingerprint expert in order to assist in the conduct of the general election which was held in early November, 1989. The Australians were vital to the success of the mission as the Australian engineer and British signals advance parties were the only troops on the ground when the ceasefire collapsed in early April 1989. They were hurriedly redeployed to bolster a renegotiated ceasefire by supervising the withdrawal of SWAPO guerrillas from Namibia. The Second contingentâs engineering and local security activities were also instrumental in the successful return of thousands of refugees and the conduct of the general election. Contingent members were originally awarded the Australian Service Medal however this decision was reversed and, on 26 July 2001 the award was upgraded to the Australian Active Service Medal.

Clearance Diving Team 3, Medical teams on board US navy Hospital ships in the area, plus a further composition of 18 ADF personnel who served with US and British Land, Sea and Air forces, and a 10 person Army / RAAF intelligence detachment attached to the HQ US Central Command. Area of Operations (AO): Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), The Persian Gulf, Kuwait, and Iraq. Purpose: On 29 November 1990 UN Resolution 678 gave Iraq six weeks to withdraw from Kuwait and authorised UN members to âuse all necessary meansâ if Iraq failed to comply. The UN sanctioned operation to liberate Kuwait commenced with air and maritime campaigns in the early morning of 17 January 1991 followed by a massive ground offensive. Comments: Australia with its pre-positioned ships operating in the Gulf and Red Sea areas were included into the operation. Further additions of Clearance Diving Teams, Intelligence and Medical and Surgical support were also involved. 18 ADF personnel who were on exchange postings to various British and US units deployed with their foreign unit to the Gulf. There were a number of foreign medals awarded to personnel who participated in what is known as âDesert Stormâ. These included the Liberation of Kuwait medal, the Saudi Arabia Gulf War Commemorative Medal, and the US Achievement Medal (JSAM). Although they were awarded to many Australians, the Federal Government has not given approval for them to be worn officially.

Purpose: Following the cease fire between Coalition military forces and Iraq, Resolution 688 authorised humanitarian assistance to Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq. The Kurds had for many decades been persecuted by the regime of Saddam Hussein and required urgent humanitarian assistance. Comments: 72 Army and 3 RAAF medical, dental, engineering and logistics personnel were deployed to Turkey and Iraq to assist Kurdish refugees. Although this was a humanitarian mission, elements of the ADF were engaged by Iraqi Republican Guard units which had retreated from the border of Saudi Arabia soon after the commencement of the Gulf War. 33 Version 4 â 3 May 2020\n\nP:35\n\nLast Name First Names Ashton Alan Lynn Dempsey Harry Graham United Nations Advanced Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC) United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) Operation GOODWILL & Operation GEMINI Australian Deployment Dates: 1991-1993 Strength: 1279 ADF personnel â 65 Personnel of the UNAMIC Contingent on 12-month tour of duty, New Zealand communications staff (45 personnel on 6 month tours) collectively forming the Force Communications Unit (FCU UNTAC comprised 545 personnel from 1992-1993). Movement Control Group of 30 ADF Personnel. One Blackhawk Helicopter Squadron accompanied by an Infantry Protection Platoon (2/4 RAR). Area of Operations: Cambodia, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. In October 1991, prior to UNTAC being formally established, Australia contributed a 65-strong communications unit to its precursor, the UN Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC). On UNTACâs establishment, the ADF Contingent increased to 502 personnel, comprising 488 Force Communications Unit (FCU) and 14 staff on HQ UNTAC. The FCU was originally based on the 2nd Signal Regiment but reinforced from many other units, including 20 personnel each from the RAN and the RAAF. 45 New Zealand personnel also bolstered the FCU. The FCU was spread across 56 locations throughout Cambodia and saw more action than any other UN unit. UNTAC was established under the 1991 Paris Agreements to supervise a ceasefire and a general election in Cambodia. UNTACâs Military component consisted of 16,000 personnel from 32 countries. The Force Commander of this highly demanding and complex operation was Lieutenant General J.M. Sanderson AC.

Strength: Total of 219 personnel consisting of 5 contingents of 45. Area of Operations (AO): Western Sahara, south-west Algeria and Morocco. Purpose: Since Spainâs unilateral withdrawal from the Western Sahara territory in 1976, the Frente POLISARIO (POLISARIO Front), the politico-military organization who represent the Saharawi people, have fiercely resisted annexation by neighbouring Morocco. A guerrilla war continued until 1991 when the UN brokered a cease-fire. Following this, in September 1991, MINURSO was established to: monitor the ceasefire; monitor the confinement of Moroccan and POLISARIO Front troops to designated locations; ensure the release of all Western Saharan political prisoners or detainees; verify the reduction of Moroccan troops in the Territory; oversee the exchange of prisoners of war; implement the repatriation programme (UNHCR); identify and register qualified voters; and to organize and ensure a free and fair referendum and proclaim the results. Australia provided the missionâs 45-strong Force Communications Unit from 1991 until mid 1994. The Australian Contingent primarily provided combat net radio, messaging and higher command link communications from Force HQ in LaÃ¢youne to each sector HQ and further to team site level within the sectors as required. In addition, the Contingent performed driving tasks including fuel tanker and flat-bed fuel (44 gal drums) and propane (canister) resupply to team sites widely dispersed on both sides of the âbermâ â an approximately 2,700 km-long defensive wall which stretches along the entire length of the disputed territory through Western Sahara and the southeastern portion of Morocco and separates the Moroccan-administered portion (west) from the area that is controlled by the POLISARIO Front (east). History: Western Sahara, a Territory on the north-west coast of Africa bordered by Morocco, Mauritania and Algeria, was administered by Spain until 1976. The Frente Popular para la LiberaciÃ³n 35 Version 4 â 3 May 2020\n\nP:37\n\nde Saguia el-Hamra y de RÃ­o de Oro (POLISARIO Front) began in May 1973 as an insurgency (based in neighbouring Mauritania) against Spanish control of Western Sahara. After Spain withdrew and Morocco and Mauritania partitioned Western Sahara between themselves in 1976, the POLISARIO Front relocated to Algeria, which henceforth provided the organization with bases and military aid. Mauritania made peace with the POLISARIO Front in 1979, but Morocco then unilaterally annexed Mauritaniaâs portion of Western Sahara. During the 1980s POLISARIO Front guerrillas, numbering some 15,000 motorized and well-armed troops, harassed and raided Moroccan outposts and defences in Western Sahara. Morocco responded by constructing a berm, or earthen barrier, some 1,240 miles (2,000 km) long, which was completed by 1987. Although Algerian diplomatic support continued, military support was reduced during the 1990s. A guerrilla war with the POLISARIO Front contesting Moroccoâs sovereignty ended in a 1991 UN- brokered cease-fire. Since then a UN-organized referendum on the territoryâs final status has been repeatedly postponed. The UN since 2007 has sponsored intermittent talks between representatives of the Government of Morocco and the POLISARIO Front to negotiate the status of Western Sahara. Morocco has put forward an autonomy proposal for the territory, which would allow for some local administration while maintaining Moroccan sovereignty. The POLISARIO Front, with Algeriaâs support, demands a popular referendum that includes the option of independence. The natural hazards synonymous with the Sahara have been compounded by the man-made hazards of an area that has been a battlefield for more than 80 years. The mine hazards, isolation and the exceptionally harsh conditions of the Sahara were a part of every day living on MINURSO. Killed: 1 â On 21 June 1993, Army Doctor Major Susan Felsche, Royal Australian Army Medical Corps, was killed in a Medical Unit aircraft crash. The Pilatus Porter, in which she was a passenger, crashed on take-off at Awsard airfield, Southern Sector, Western Sahara. She was the first Australian female soldier to die in a multinational peacekeeping operation and the first Australian servicewoman to die in an overseas military operation since World War 2.

Strength: Total contribution 96 personnel. Between 2 and 6 ADF personnel deployed on 3 â 6 month rotations. Area of Operations (AO): Iraq. Purpose: In April 1991 Resolution 687 imposed a peace agreement and disarmament provisions on Iraq and established a UN Special Commission. UNSCOM was tasked with locating and supervising the destruction of Iraqi nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction capabilities. Comments: Australia deployed between 2 and 6 ADF personnel and scientific experts to UNSCOM on three to six month tours. The Commission wound up operations in 1999, due to Iraqi accusations that the British and US used spying methods to detect the Iraqi Weapons of mass destruction. At the centre of the controversy, was UNSCOMâs Commissioner â Australian Richard Butler.

As 1992 progressed the civil war worsened, and the country effectively ceased to function as an organised nation state. Mass starvation and anarchy followed. Beginning tentatively in September 1992, the UN stepped in to protect the delivery of humanitarian assistance and to reconstitute Somalia as a functioning political, social and economic entity. On 15 December 1992, the Government agreed to the deployment of a contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel to Somalia as part of the United Nations peacekeeping efforts in the region. The Government also decided that, for the period of Australiaâs contribution to the United Nations operations, Somalia would be designated as an operational area for the purposes of the Veteransâ Entitlements Act and that operational service in Somalia would also be designated as âqualifying serviceâ. The significance of declaring the area as an operational area is that it will provide for entitlement in respect of incapacity or death arising out of that service to be determined on the more 37 Version 4 â 3 May 2020\n\nP:39\n\ngenerous standard of proof. âQualifying serviceâ gives rise to entitlement to service pension, provided all the other conditions relating to the payment of service pension are met. On 20 October 1992, the ADF MovCon Unit (MCU) arrived in Somalia to assist UNOSOM I cope with the influx of assigned forces. The original 36 members of MovCon and the advance party of 5 pers transitioned to UNOSOM II. The 36 MovCon pers were repatriated to Australia on 8 Jul 1993 and replaced by ASC 2. UNOSOM I was not replaced by UNITAF (Op SOLACE). They were parallel operations. Deployed: 36 â Movement Control Unit (MovCon) from the three services.

(end date is when last member departed AO). AO: SOMALIA Background: By late 1992, the catastrophic situation in Somalia had outstripped the UNâs ability to quickly restore peace and stability, mainly because the UN was hamstrung by insufficient forces and UN peacekeeping principles and methods could not cope with the need to sue force in such complex situations. On 3 December 1992, UN Security Council Resolution 794 authorised a coalition of UN members, under US command, to form UNITAF and intervene to protect the delivery of humanitarian assistance and restore peace. UNITAF was used as an interim force until UNOSOM II came into being. Australia deployed an Infantry Battalion plus supporting elements, including a Squadron of Armoured Personnel Carriers, HQ Staff, Engineers, Communications and Electronic Warfare Detachments, and Administrative elements; and HMAS Tobruk. The RAAF were also used to move the Australian Forces to and from the Area of Operations from Australia and conducted regular resupply missions. The Battalion group operated the 17,000 square kilometre Baidoa Humanitarian Relief Sector in southwestern Somalia. The Battalion group was very successful at fostering and protecting humanitarian relief efforts and won widespread international praise for its efforts in restoring law and order and re-establishing functional legal, social and economic systems. 38 Version 4 â 3 May 2020\n\nP:40\n\nDeployed: Approximately 1,500. 1 RAR Group +, HQ Australian Forces Somalia (UNITAF), HMAS Tobruk, HMAS Jervis Bay, RAN Clearance Diving Team 1, RAAF elements.

AO: Rwanda and the areas in Uganda, Zaire (now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Burundi and Tanzania that are not more than 50 kilometres from the border with Rwanda. Background: Fighting between the Armed Forces of the mainly Hutu Government of Rwanda and the Tutsi-led Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) first broke out in October 1990 across the border between Rwanda and its northern neighbour, Uganda. A number of ceasefire agreements followed but hostilities resumed in the northern part of the country in early February 1993. The United Nations active involvement in Rwanda started in 1993, when Rwanda and Uganda requested the deployment of military observers along the common border to prevent the military use of the area by RPF. In October 1993, the Security Council established another international force, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), to help the parties implement the agreement, monitor its implementation and support the transitional Government. UNAMIRâs demilitarized zone sector headquarters was established upon the arrival of the advance party and became operational on 1 November 1993. Deployment of the UNAMIR battalion in Kigali, composed of contingents from Belgium and Bangladesh, was completed in the first part of December 1993, and the Kigali weapons-secure area was established on 24 December. The United Nations solicited troop contributions, but initially only Belgium with a half a battalion of 400 troops, and Bangladesh with a logistical element of 400 troops, offered personnel. It took five months to reach the authorized strength of 2,548. But because of many unresolved issues between the parties, implementation of the agreement was delayed. Consequently, the inauguration of the transitional Government never took place. Within a background of distrust and revenge, in April 1994, the Presidents of Rwanda and of Burundi were killed while returning from peace talks in Tanzania, when the Rwandese plane crashed, in circumstances that are still to be determined, as it was landing in Kigali, Rwandaâs capital. This set off a tidal wave of political and ethnic killings: the Prime Minister, cabinet ministers and UNAMIR peacekeepers were among the first victims. The killings, targeting Tutsi and moderate Hutus, were mainly carried out by the armed forces, the presidential guard and the ruling partyâs youth militia. The RPF resumed its advance from the north and the east of Rwanda, and government authority disintegrated. An interim Government was formed but failed to stop the massacres. With the RPFâs southward push, the number of displaced persons and refugees increased tremendously. On 28 April alone, 280,000 people fled to Tanzania to escape the violence. Another wave of refugees went to Zaire. The United Nations and other agencies provided emergency assistance on an unprecedented scale. UNAMIR sought to arrange a ceasefire, without success, and its personnel came increasingly under attack. However, US pressure mounted in New York to reduce the UN involvement. After some countries unilaterally withdrew their contingents, the Security Council on 21 April 1994, reduced UNAMIRâs strength from 2,548 to 270. Despite its reduced presence, UNAMIR troops managed to protect thousands of Rwandese who took shelter at sites under UNAMIR control. UNAMIR could do little to stop the genocide. As the situation worsened, Belgium withdrew its UN personnel and it was debated if all of UNAMIR should be withdrawn. However, on 17 May 1994, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo against Rwanda, and called for urgent international 40 Version 4 â 3 May 2020\n\nP:42\n\naction and increased UNAMIRâs strength to up to 5,500 troops. Known as UNAMIR II, its task was to âcontribute to the security and protection of displaced persons, refugees and civilians at risk in Rwandaâ, including, where possible, the establishment of âsecure humanitarian areasâ. Australia agreed to send a medical team to provide support for UNAMIR II personnel and, as a secondary role, to provide humanitarian relief to the Rwandans. To contribute to the security of civilians, the Council authorized a multi-national humanitarian operation. French-led multinational forces carried out âOperation Turquoiseâ, which established a humanitarian protection zone in south-western Rwanda. The operation ended in August 1994 and UNAMIR took over in the zone. In July, RPF forces took control of Rwanda, ending the civil war, and established a broad-based Government. The new Government declared its commitment to the 1993 peace agreement and assured UNAMIR that it would cooperate on the return of refugees. By October 1994, estimates suggested that out of a population of 7.9 million, at least half a million people had been killed. Some 2 million had fled to other countries and as many as 2 million people were internally displaced. A United Nations humanitarian appeal launched in July raised $762 million, making it possible to respond to the enormous humanitarian challenge. A Commission of Experts established by the Security Council reported in September that âoverwhelming evidenceâ proved that Hutu elements had perpetrated acts of genocide against the Tutsi group in a âconcerted, planned, systematic and methodical way.â The final report of the Commission was presented to the Council in December 1994. ADF: July 1994 â March 1996. Australia agreed to send a medical team to provide support for UNAMIR II personnel and, as a secondary role, to provide humanitarian relief to the Rwandans. Australia sent two contingents to Rwanda, each one serving for six months. The first Australian contingent, comprising 308 members, mostly arrived in the country in late August. Later known as AUSMED, the Australian Medical Support Force provided UNAMIRâs medical support and was made up of a medical company, an infantry company group from 2/4 RAR, four Armoured Personnel Carriers, Signals and a logistic support company. The medical company included two specialist surgical teams, a preventative medical section, a medical support platoon (providing pathology and pharmacy functions), and a dental capacity. The medical unit was not based on an established medical unit but instead drew its members from the three services â 17 from the RAAF, seven from the RAN, and the rest from the army. Twenty-six members of the medical team were women. Flying into Kigali, the Australians based themselves at the Kigali Central Hospital, which had been badly damaged during the fighting. They set up an operating theatre in the only room without holes in the roof from mortar shells. The Australians also had the only working X-ray centre in Rwanda, the only blood bank, the only intensive care unit, and the only air-conditioned operating theatre. Although the contingent was tasked to provide medical assistance to UNAMIR II, most cases treated by the Australians were Rwandans. The contingent also trained local hospital staff and sent small groups to provincial towns to provide medical aid. Infantry soldiers accompanied the medical teams and gave them protection. The second contingent that took over from the first during the last weeks of February 1995 included B Company 2 RAR, engineers from the 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment, and armoured personnel carriers from B Squadron 3rd/4th Cavalry Regiment. Surgeons and other medical specialists, mainly from the Army Reserve, as well as the RAN and RAAF Reserve, were rotated through the force on a six-week basis. On 19 April 1995 a group of 32 Australian soldiers and medical personnel were sent to the Kibeho refugee camp to assist refugees and UNAMIR activities. The situation within the camp was desperate. 41 Version 4 â 3 May 2020\n\nP:43\n\nThere was little food or water and the refugees, mostly Hutu who may have taken part in the earlier genocide, were harassed by the RPF. From 20 to 23 April the RPF began to close down and empty the camp. The already tense situation descended into a violent massacre, with the RPF killing around 4,000 people and injuring 600. Under fire and often under the threat of the RPF, the Australians managed to set up a Casualty Evacuation station and conduct triage and treatment for the wounded Hutus. The medical team struggled to cope with the sheer volume of wounded, many of whom were evacuated to Kigali hospital. In addition to the Australian troops, a company of Zambian peacekeepers was also in Kibeho when the massacre began. Restricted by the UN Mandate and the Rules of Engagement, the Australian soldiers could only look on in horror as to what had unfolded in front of them. It was later argued that UN presence at Kibeho stopped the RPF from killing everyone in the camp and creating an even worse outcome. After the Kibeho massacre the Australians concentrated on training the Rwandans to whom they handed over some hospital duties. In August the Australians were replaced by a team of 30 civilians from Norway. The MSF was awarded the RSL ANZAC Peace Prize in 1995, for outstanding restoration of peace in the strife-torn central African nation. Deployed: 652 (Total with ASC1 & ASC2 rotations).

Operation Bel-ISI is the Pacific Nations Truce and Peace Monitoring between the Bougainvillean Guerrillas (BRA) and the PNG Defence Force in the disputed territory of Bougainville. The force comprised of Fiji, Vanuatu (âNi Vansâ), Tongan, Australian, New Zealand, and Solomon Islander Defence Forces. April 30 1998, marked the transition from the New Zealand led Truce Monitoring Group (TMG), OP BEL ISI (I), to the Australian led Peace Monitoring Group (PMG) and the beginning of OP BEL ISI (II). The transition occurred following the signing of the Ceasefire Agreement in the Arawa Township earlier that day. The PMG currently consists of about 100 people from Australia, NZ, Fiji and Vanuatu. The operation consisted of approximately 70 ADF logistical staff, including the HQ Peace Monitoring Group. Australian Defence Civilians have also deployed in the capacity of Observers. Electoral Commission personnel also deployed. The PMG successfully brokered an agreement between the PNG and Bougainville in which Bougainvilleans control their public service, courts, police, correctional institutions, taxation and foreign aid initiatives. 43 Version 4 â 3 May 2020\n\nP:45\n\nDeployed: 250 Logistics, communications, HQ Staff and Monitors.
