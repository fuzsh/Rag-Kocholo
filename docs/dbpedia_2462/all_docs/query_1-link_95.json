        "text": "THE WIZARD\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nJeff Mills, The Wizard. He started it all. He encouraged the whole of Detroit. I was listening to Jeff Mills since â83.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nJeff Mills was totally amazing. I used to go to the Nectarine Ballroom to check him out in Ann Arbor every Sunday.\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nI heard this guy on the radio and Iâm like, âMan, it sounds like he has eight turntables or something!â\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nEvery time we got a record from [local store] Buy-Rite, weâd take it home and it wasnât the same tempo as Jeff was doing. I said, âJeff, whatâs going on?â He said, âMan, open up the Technics turntable. Thereâs a blue button in there that says âpitch,â thereâs a plus and a minus â go all the way to the plus.â\n\nDJ Dick\n\nHe was an absolute master at using tape machines and editing and splicing.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nLetâs say the record naturally is 128 to 130 beats per minute. Detroit DJs will make it 150, 155. They would have to edit the turntable to get it to go that fast.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nHis radio show was only half an hour. So he had to play stuff a little bit fast, the stuff that he wanted to get through. But youâve got to look at it this way: He wanted to be different than everybody else. Everybody had 1200s. Everybody had this stuff. Itâs the way you play it.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nI came up listening to The Wizard and The Wizard would cut your ass into another room. Back in my day, if you wanted respect, you had to be just as good if not better than The Wizard for people to even respect you.\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nI remember seeing The Wizard play at a club, and somebody was running to the dancefloor to dance to the song, and by the time they got to the dancefloor he had changed the song.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nNobody had ever witnessed that kind of energy. The way he was cutting up the records was like the atom being split or something. It caused problems all over. He had a residency in Ann Arbor, where I eventually went to school, and they had this racist law â because of how his nights had gone â that I called âThe Wizard Law,â where if there was X amount of black people together after 1 AM, they were going to be there and break it up.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nThe Wizard used to go to the record store. He didnât have to shop for records like us. Guess what Cliff [Thomas, Buy-Rite owner] had for him? A secret box. They give him secret boxes. Heâd come in there, get the boxes and leave. He never had to stay in there. People didnât know what Jeff looked like, except the people that knew him. If I came in Buy-Rite, Iâd speak to him, âWhatâs up?â and keep it moving, because you donât want nobody to mess with him, talk him to death and all that. Nobody knew Jeff. Jeff, he got the secret boxes. It took a long time before we could get the secret boxes. Thanks, Cliff.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nI didnât play a lot of Miami bass. I think those guys heard [Jeff Mills] playing it, and then all of a sudden, [Detroit DJs] started speeding everything up. Even DJ Stingray, I think he was one of the guys who, early on, was doing that before anybody else. He was playing the songs on 45 RPMs. I remember going to Buy-Rite and seeing them do that.\n\nORIGINS\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nMy grandmother taught piano for [the department of] Parks and Recreation here in Detroit. I trained classically until I was about 12. I could play most anything by that time. I would mime whatever I heard on the radio. Then I heard Kraftwerk and the disco, when disco started getting drum machines in it. I couldnât play that so much with the instruments that I had, so I asked my mother, âWhat made that sound?â She said, âA synthesizer.â I said, âI need a synthesizer.â\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nWhen I was 15, I had two really shitty belt-driven turntables. I had a bullshit Radio Shack mixer. I didnât know anything about DJing. When I met DJ Dick, he was an on-air mixer for 96.3 FM. He was playing Miami bass music on the weekends. He said, âNo, you need to get Technic turntables.â\n\nDJ Dick\n\nHe bought a set of turntables from me that I had purchased from Jeff Mills.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI was trying to do [the tricks] on the cheap turntables. The first guy I saw with [Technics] 1200s in Detroit was a guy named Leon Purse. He was a good friend of Jesse The Body, who did The Scene. Then it was renamed The New Dance Show.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nThe New Dance Show is an extension of Soul Train, but in a Detroit way. Anybody whoâs been to Detroit â even when you talk to people from another state who used to live in Detroit â you say techno or whatever, and they say, âI know what you talking about.â The only thing that was played was the music that was playing here in Detroit, what people really danced to.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nYou couldnât have DJ Assault if you didnât have The New Dance Show. You just couldnât. We wouldnât have existed. It cemented the sound to average, everyday people. Like this club thing, totally underground. If you didnât go out, if you didnât get high, you wouldnât have known about it. But The New Dance Show, little kids knew about it.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI still remember [the intro]: âItâs six oâclock and itâs time to rock, we rock non-stop till seven oâclock. We donât stop, we wonât stop.â\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nThey showed [ads] on The Scene and The New Dance Show. Watts Club Mozambique. The highlight of watching the show was when these commercials would come on. Only in Detroit. Itâd be guys in these crazy satin outfits, with [dance groups named] Black Cobra, Tokyo, Sexual Healing.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nJuan Atkins was a big influence for me personally, just his basslines and the way his mixes sound. I wanted my records to sound like Juan Atkins.\n\nAnthony Shakir\n\nJuan Atkins is the only guy who can stand on the street corner [in Detroit] and hear his music in somebody elseâs car. The rest of us canât do that.\n\nTommy Hamilton\n\nBack when we were RX7, we started playing cover tunes. Back then we didnât have a sequencer. All we had was a drum machine and two keyboards. Basically I had to learn how to play [Model 500 and Cybotron] songs, basslines, and I played them live while we did the show. Thatâs how I had to learn. We just so intrigued by the sounds and the basslines. I think thatâs what really I gravitated towards more was the bass sounds and the way the bass was being played, the funk behind it.\n\nRick Wade\n\nA lot of people, including myself, would either sample or emulate a lot of Juanâs old records. Like âClearâ or âAlleys Of Your Mindâ or whatever. It was like that specific sound that he used in those, that was the sound everybody was looking for at that time.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nWe listened to a lot [of techno], Derrick May, Mayday. Mayday for attitude, for intensity and attitude. Because when we made more techno foolish tracks, which ended up as our B-sides, it had to be dark! It had to sound like the end of the world. It canât be friendly. Because when things got friendly, it felt more European.\n\nRick Wade\n\nGhettotech DJs are all incredible DJs. Even if theyâve never played outside of Detroit, or even if theyâve never even played in a club, just in their bedroom, these cats can DJ. In the old days [as Big Daddy Rick], I could do all that stuff, because thatâs what you had to do. But nowadays, Iâd look like some kind of clown next to these cats. Next to Gary Chandler, or Godfather, or somebody â no. Iâll stick with my house and my disco.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nGodfatherâs such an amazing DJ that anybody who ever had him somewhere wants to have him back, because his skills on the decks were ludicrous.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nHonestly, I try to embarrass people when I play. I try to tear the club down every time.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nAssault was good as well, but he was a different thing. Itâs like, give Assault a mic because heâs going to come up with some rhyme on the spot. Heâs another experience. Itâs closer to pure comedy because of his insane delivery, his sense of humor.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nItâs just reckless. Catching the beat, catching the rhythm. Itâs just reckless. Thatâs why Mike Banks likes to see DJ Godfather and DJ Funk DJ, because when they play itâs reckless. Itâs like, yeah, you going to hear a couple mistakes, but they throwinâ down, because itâs not planned. Itâs like, âLet me see, that mix with that. Let me go ahead and grab this. Let me go ahead and grab this.â Youâll never do the same thing twice.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nTo properly create that [ghettotech] sound, thereâs a lot of fast mixing and a lot of scratching and tricks and beat juggles and stuff like that.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nIâm saying this absolutely with no ego or nothing. The bigger booking agencies, when they put you in the lineup with some of their crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me, top notch, super-duper headliners, Iâll do them. Itâs several people I know that donât want to play a show with me. I do it for real. Youâre going to have a hard time outperforming me.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nMost DJs out of Detroit, they play everything. A lot of guys donât do that anymore. âIâm a minimal DJ, I only play minimal.â; âIâm a jungle DJâ â when jungle was hot â âI only played jungle.â The true DJs in Detroit play a little bit of everything. That shit sounds so good. If youâre playing a 4/4 beat, and then you throw in electro, then you go from electro to a 4/4 beat, it changes up the whole mood.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nWhen I met DJ Dick, I was always into Miami bass, too. I just didnât think of it from a DJ aspect because at that time 2 Live Crew came out and it was, like, the first ever songs with cussing. Of course, as a young kid I loved it. He was playing a lot of Miami bass on the radio. I was hanging out in teen clubs, then I started playing at them. I knew I had to play more different kind of stuff, more of the party stuff. I couldnât just scratch the whole time.\n\nRADIO\n\nHobey Echlin\n\nIn the â90s, you could drive around on a Friday or Saturday night and on any radio station, you could hear Godfather or Gary Chandler live from a warehouse or Legends [nightclub] playing just hour after hour of straight ghettotech mixing. It was beautiful because they would throw in electro, they would throw in Cybotron, they would even throw in jungle. The fact that you were hearing jungle from people like Aphrodite on urban contemporary radio, let alone in Detroitâ¦ it was unheard of.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nYou have to be from Detroit to know this. When I used to club back in the day â I donât do it anymore â what was cool about radio was when you were getting ready to go to the club you could get yourself hype if you turned the radio on. They started playing the music [from the club] before you get to the party so youâre already like, âOh, weâre on our way to the club!â\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nI used to listen to these live broadcasts on WGPR of [Gary Chandler and DJ Fingers] playing at the Dancery, in â93 while cruising down Jefferson and Belle Isle with DBX, absolutely insane. Reinforced picture discs and Metalheadz with Carl Craigâs âFrom Beyondâ into current Miami bass or a pitched up âNo Way Back.â The genre on record never matched those moments.\n\nBrian Gillespie\n\nGary Chandler dominated airwaves â he was a god. He was the Jeff Mills of the â90s when Jeff got off of the airwaves.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nAfter The Wizard [on WJLB] I was playing a lot of rap music, but I wanted to play all the Miami music that was out at that time. Thatâs when you had the Splack Pack, you had Gigolo Tony, and Sir Mix-A-Lot was putting them on the glass, you know what Iâm saying, so you had a lot of Miami. Of course Luke [Skyywalker] was like so, so big. He was taking his thing on the road, with the bus tours, and the girls and the chicks. But I wanted to do something a little bit different.\n\nHobey Echlin\n\nGary Chandler was like a rap king, he was a local hero.\n\nAnthony Shakir\n\nGary Chandler was always a great DJ â he was a very tight, very neat, very skilled DJ.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nOur whole thing was, get the white labels, get it to Gary, get it to Fingers, get it to Zap. When these guys would play it all over the mix shows, everyone wanted it.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nBack then, the radio programmers trusted their DJs. The DJs that you brought from the streets, when you brought them to the radio, that made your ratings better. You got the hottest of the hot street dudes on your radio station; you got to trust them. Why the fuck did you bring them on the radio if youâre not going to trust their judgment? I had the freedom to do me, so I made a choice: Iâm going to do my city. I got to rep my city. âIâm not going to keep playing all these records from Miami when Miami got 30 artists. I got 22 here. Why not play all Detroit music and make it about my city, make my show about my city?â\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nYou almost had to play them off each other. If I gave Gary a record and Fingers didnât have it, Fingers needed it. If I gave Fingers a record and he was playing on the radio, Gary would be like, âI canât believe you gave Chris that record, how come I didnât get it? What the fuck!?â I would almost â in a nice way! â do it on purpose.\n\nRick Wade\n\nThose guys would be ripping it up every weekend, and back then, ghettotech ruled the airwaves.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nGary Chandler. Waxtax-N-Dre. DJ Fingers. Those guys, they made it instrumental.\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\n105.9 WCHB was a new radio station that just came about [in 1996]. Heâs like, âIâm going to ask the guy to get you on.â The owner of the club told me to come down and play some records at a party. The club was live on the radio. I didnât hear from him for a few days. I called my buddy to say, âHey, you know, what did the guy think?â He called him on the three-way and said, âHey, what do you think about the DJ Wax when he played?â And the owner was like, âYou donât listen to our radio station? Turn the radio station on right now.â So we turned the radio station on and it hit a commercial and it said, âOur newest DJ Waxtax-N-Dre is going to be at the skating party on such and such.â I was like, âWow. I got hired and I didnât even know!â\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nThe Four Horsemen were me, DJ Zap, DJ Niko [Marks] and Rick Hines. We had a club called The Dancery. It opened every Saturday from 10 PM to 4 AM.\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nI looked up to DJ Zap. Then me and DJ Fingers got to be really good friends. Niko and Rick Hines were the other DJs [in the Four Horsemen]. They were instrumental in the booty music game.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI would listen to DJ Fingers and DJ Zap and all of that on the live broadcast from the clubs and hear different rap stuff that they would put on 45 and I was like âHuh, Iâm gonna flip that to a dance record.â\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nMe, Gary [Chandler], Fingers â and I say our three names because weâve been friends as well. Weâve been on the radio for years and weâve never played any festivals. I think weâve definitely been overlooked and we play just as good as Godfather and Assault do.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nA lot of the ghetto stuff that Godfather really got from us was from parties that we DJed. We just be playing instrumental, we just be talking on the mic, and then heâd just come up with stupid stuff. Next thing you know, two weeks later heâs coming out with it.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nThe people that was in the streets, they were mad at me. But Iâm an entrepreneur man, you should have pressed the record. That was my game plan. âHow can I be as big as the DJs in Detroit on the radio?â\n\nDJ Dick\n\nâDrive That Thingâ was an uptempo bass song like Quad City DJs, very much in that vein. It had an Earth, Wind & Fire sample in it â âLetâs Grooveâ â and we literally designed the song from the ground-up to be a radio hit.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nWhile doing this record [âDrive That Thingâ], I started learning. I was picking up things in the studio. I was also asking him to show me. I was like, âHey, how do you use this sampler? And how do you take this sample and put it on this drum pad?â I was asking all the right questions. When he told me, âHere, you got to do this, this and this.â I wrote it step-by-step in a notepad so Iâd never have to ask him again.\n\nDJ Dick\n\nIt seemed like everyone around us started as a rapper. I was in a little rap group and we were working on uptempo hip-hop tracks, but they didnât sound like any hip-hop tracks that were out [at the time]. We really didnât know at the age of 16, 17 years old if anybody was going to accept us. Weâd go over to Jeff Millsâs and heâd encourage us to rap over our records, but he was also introducing us to the whole techno scene.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nGodfather was trying to get all the guys together, and he had it in his mind, âIâm going to make my label, and have artists, just like the Chicago guys do.â He could have made records just for himself, but to have a label, that means you need labelmates, and you want to put guys down, and you want to expand the music and expand the brand. He was young and saw that.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nThe first [Bass Association] single actually made it to radio rotation on three different stations here. Now, Iâm a month out of high school. I have a song on the radio, so Iâm, like, the shit. Iâm not even 18 yet. It got so much recognition in the city that Bellmark Records â the label that put out Tag Team, âWhoomp! (There It Is)â â wanted to sign it.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\n[Godfatherâs] drums are some of the most imitated drums in this whole thing. He changed the rhythm. I donât think he gets credit for that. Usually, when you see him, heâs such a flashy DJ â youâre just going to talk about his DJing.\n\nDJ Dick\n\nHe started taking drum sounds from just about everywhere, but the thing that he really, really loved to do â after he eventually got an MPC3000 â was he started to layer his drum sounds and create his own drum sound. He would layer two, three snares together and make his own snare out of it. Some of them were samples, some of them were 808, 909 samples, some of them were samples from other records. Thatâs how he got his unique drum sound. He started making his own drum kits after that.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nAfter we did the Bass Association album, I was playing a lot more techno and early ghetto and Miami bass shit. We were mixing it all together. A lot of DJs in Detroit were doing that. When I was producing records, Iâm like, âI want to take this little Miami bass vocal and loop it and put a beat behind it.â Thereâs old stuff like Frank Ski, âThereâs some whores in this house,â remember that? That old record. It was literally a vocal hook that was looping to more of a house beat. I started playing some of these records and I want to do this more but in a Detroit style â Kraftwerk, all of the old Cybotron stuff. All the old Splack Pack, which is more a Miami bass record. The early 2 Live Crew stuff. The early DJ Uncle Al stuff. Thatâs how I started producing the records. Instead of making a record and structuring it so thereâs raps and choruses, I made it more of a DJ tool. That evolved into ghettotech.\n\nMR. DEâ AND DJ ASSAULT\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nSo I was working for this producer RJ Rice, primarily producing whatever he told me to do. He made âShackles.â This is from 1991 to â93 or â94. We were producing â all kinds of major stuff â but the money wasnât coming in right. I made that clear. Cliff [Thomas from Buy-Rite] was making thousands of dollars a day. He had the most money on him at all times, than any other person Iâve ever met before. He would reach in his pocket and be like $17,000. So Iâm like, I need to follow you! So Iâm working for him and Iâm learning the ropes. It was like a music school. I learned how to sell records there. Wholesale, retail, you name it. I met all the DJs there. And DJ Assault was a part of a group called Assault N Battery. They were a rap group and I couldnât stand them.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI quit my other job at the end of â94 to work for Cliff in â95. The Assault N Battery stuff, it never came out, but in the process, we had dance records that did come out. 12\" dance records, and it was basically me producing them, and thatâs when Mr. Deâ came into the scene, from some of the technical aspects of the music he was helping with, because he worked at Buy-Rite already.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\n[Cliff] called me and said, âWell, Ade, what you think?â I said, âThey suck.â I said, âDo not sign them.â Of course, he signed it, and of course I get stuck in the basement with Assault N Battery.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nHe helped me a lot with playing notes, chords, for the most part, to some degree. He helped a lot with that. He redid all of my rap records. The ideas we had for Assault N Battery, he made the ideas better because he was like a real musician.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nHe had an idea, I would technically do it. I would help him learn how to technically do it until he could technically do it.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nAdeâs name gets lost a lot in this. Ade is a musician. When [DJ Assault and Mr. Deâ] were together, I thought that was a very cool combination.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nWhen the rap stuff didnât work out, I was seeing how it was four 12\" records [on Supply & Demand and D-Bass] that we had put out just in the store, and I saw each one of them sell like over 400 copies, and I was like, âWow. OK, so I see this sells. This is just one store.â\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nWe got in a shipment of Dance Mania records one day. Craig [Adams, AKA DJ Assault] said, âI have that record.â I said, âWhat do you mean you have that record? Youâre a rapper. What do you have this record for?â He said, âI DJ.â I said, âWhat do you mean you DJ?â He said, like âYeah, Iâm DJ Assault.â He was DJ Assassinator. Assault was when he rapped. Assassinator was when he DJed.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nFrom those four 12\" records, I was DJing the biggest high school party in the city, on Friday night, like at Grand Quarter. On a bad night, it was like 700 people.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nWhat made DJ Assault famous, he was making mixtapes of his own music and selling them for $3. He did that to promote himself to make it where he is now.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nPeople laughed at me for those mixtapes, to be honest. I got teased by Detroit DJs. What they donât understand, it wasnât really for the street. It was for the clientele that I was playing in front of at the time, which was the high school party. When it was capacity, it was 1,200 people. Iâm like, âTheyâre at high school.â It would be silly to try to sell something for $10. I was like, âIf I sell the tape for less and still make money, it would sell more.â The tape only cost $1 and my time, an hour. I was like, âIâll do a new mix every week.â It will be different, so I could get people buying every week. Iâm still making 200% profit at only $3 a tape, but they clowned it. âYou canât sell your tapes that cheap.â What they didnât realize was that in a year I was selling 10,000 tapes at $3. It got to the point where the promoter didnât really want to pay me so much. He was saying, âYouâre making all that money selling tapes.â Detroit is a trip, man. Iâm telling you. Iâm like, âWhat does that have to do with DJing?â\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nSo [Assault] gave me a tape. I hated dance music, except for to make money with it. I thought it was a lower life form, but listening to the way [Assault] played it, Iâm like, âMan, youâre great at it.â Heâd introduce me to it and it was him who taught me about all this Mayday stuff and all that. It was an exchange between us. I taught him how to work the equipment and he taught me, âOh, this is what we do with the equipment.â Thatâs how we got really tight there.\n\nDJ Assault\n\n[Cliff Thomas] tried to pretty much just play everybody against each other. He liked a bunch of confusion and a bunch of drama between employees. Ade was [at Buy-Rite] long before me. I was from a different background. Thatâs why it didnât work on me. I was raised in the suburbs. My family had a certain amount of money. I was used to stuff. I canât take somebodyâs crumbs.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nCliff Thomas has a weird reputation within the Detroit techno industry. All those Express and Incognito [records] â maybe they blew up and people didnât get what they expected out of it.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nI just donât like change. Itâs just something in my nature. I believed in Cliff. I believed everything he said. He was another father to me. It was an emotional thing. I think from Craigâs point of view, it was just simple business. From a simple business perspective, it was the thing to do.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nSo, I was going to quit [Buy-Rite] and just do that because we werenât getting paid off the records. But when I quit, I had to drag Mr. Deâ with me. It took forever to convince him to quit. I had to pull him, like I was a dentist or orthodontist pulling teeth. It was so hard, man, to get him to quit. He didnât have an income the way I did from DJing and making mixtapes, so to get him to quit, I was splitting all of my money with him just to quit and do records. I was like, âHey man, come with me,â out of the kindness of my heart, âcause I felt sorry. He was being used. I wasnât about to be used by Cliff for five dollars an hour.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nTupac was about to release this album, All Eyez On Me. Cliff had a contact at Death Row Records. He was getting Death Row records early. I asked Cliff, âCan I get this at cost, I want to make some money off this.â He said, âNo problem Deâ, whatever you want. You want cassette or CD?â I said, âGive me a box of each, whatever I donât sell Iâll bring back.â I couldâve took ten boxes of each because I sold out in two minutes at the [party venue] Light Guard Armory. Three months later, I donât get a paycheck. Cliff takes all of my money for All Eyez On Me that he didnât tell me what he was going to charge me for and gave me a pay stub. I ended up paying retail, not cost. That pissed me off. Thatâs when I left Buy-Rite. Thatâs the story.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nEvery day, we worked. Thatâs hard to find. Thatâs why things got accomplished.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nWe split everything like a married couple. If I made a stack for a dope dealer, I gave Craig half of it. If he DJed for a bar mitzvah, he gave me half of it.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nHim and Assault made one of the best tag teams next to Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI think itâs them words. Once you got the hook, almost anybody can jump on the record with some verses. Thatâs the important thing. Itâs hard for people to come by that hook. Thatâs really the thing that Iâm particularly good at. They like those records because the words stay so... Itâs like weaving a basket. The words and the music have to weave together to make it melodic. Thatâs how people remember it or wonder why they canât get it out of their head.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nThey had records like, âEverywhere I go / I see the same hoe.â Then he had another one that was, âEvery night / I like to let them hoes fight / At the club / Saying now, whatâs up, whatâs up / Iâm a mack / I like to hit it from the back / Everywhere I go / I see the same hoe, shaking that thingâ and that was called âAsses Wiggling and Titties Jiggling.â\n\nDJ GODFATHER, PT. 2\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nThe main ones that were really killing the market were Godfather, Assault and Ade. DJ Omega teamed up with Godfather, so of course Godfather was going to put his stuff out first, then DJ Omega. You get what Iâm saying? All of them, they really teamed up with everybody. I did a couple of tracks with Godfather. But Godfather had the money to do that. Other DJs didnât.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nHe had to make a choice in his life. He was going to be a professional athlete. He was on the minor league version of the Detroit Red Wings. He was a [hockey] goalie. I remember when I went over to his house and saw a photo of him dressed as a goalie in front of the goal in a Red Wings outfit and Iâm like, âWhat are you doing in that?â He explained his whole history. He basically had to make a choice between being a DJ â because heâs putting all his time into it â or doing hockey. Itâs obvious what the choice was, but that athletic aspect of it, that competitiveness...\n\nGary Chandler\n\nBrian [Jeffries, AKA DJ Godfather] said, âI want you to come over and check out some of my music.â I go over to his house â he was staying with his parents back then â and I met his mom, met his dad. Godfatherâs the coolest Italian dude youâd meet. Meet his parents, his parents are like, âYou ready to eat?â He said, âCome on, Gary. Letâs eat.â The first time Iâm over this guyâs house, weâre eating. Iâm like, âYeah, this guy is all right.â His people are real nice, so sweet, such nice people. We go downstairs and we go down the stairs, make a left, make another left. Dude, it is equipment lined up from wall to the wall to the wall. I see seven or eight keyboards, three or four drum machines, compressors, limiters, amps, speakers. He say, âI want you to listen to some of the stuff that Iâm working on.â Now, Iâm going in this basement and, no exaggeration, this 18-year-old kid had about $60,000âs worth of equipment in his basement. He got the studio seats in there, too. The swivel boys where you sit down and do a spin and you just keep spinning.\n\nDJ Dick\n\nI was a mix show DJ on 96.3 FM somewhere around â90, â91. I was DJing at a teen club, and this kid came up to me. I was selling mixtapes back then. He said, âIf you give me 20 mixtapes, Iâll sell them all and Iâll give you all the money next week.â Iâm like, âReally?â So, I gave him ten or 20 tapes, and sure enough, he came back the next week, and he paid me for them. I gave him a couple of bucks per tape. And then, he did it again and again and I realized, man, this kidâs awesome!\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nI used to help [DJ Dick] sell his mixtapes to my high school friends. I think thatâs how me and him got tight because I was the guy bringing him $200 every week, selling $5, $10 tapes. I had the mixtape hustle on lock by the time I was 17. I used to sell tapes I made at different independent record shops and tanning salons. I was literally making $500 to $1,000 a week at 17 years old.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nHe pumped out a couple records. Iâm like the music is loud, loud as hell. Iâm like, âMan, you should turn that down, your parents ainât going to trip?â Heâs like, âMan, my parents are cool with this.â The music is on club level, with 350 watt amps running through these speakers and itâs about six or seven speakers in the basement, plus monitors. Crystal clear, banging. Iâm like, this boyâs sweet. He played some stuff that he was working on and some of the stuff that you guys eventually heard I heard for the first time. He played about ten tracks and all of them, I was like, âWow. This kid is talented.â You could tell heâd been putting the work in, and with that much equipment, you could tell that his parents were behind him.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nA lot of the DJs were buying two copies for the beat juggling. That helped, but there were that many DJs and that many record stores here. I mean, weâre selling out of ten, 12 record shops. We were literally making records for Detroit. Letâs make another one, next month weâll have another one. My mentality was, OK, if I could sell a thousand records a month, thatâd be great. It wasnât until the third and fourth record coming out, we started realizing other distributors from around the world were ordering our stuff through the distribution at Record Time. Record Time was the biggest record store in Detroit for years, and they had a distribution. They were exporting to overseas, so when we found that out, we started reaching out to distributors and we were giving them our first few releases because they [had never] heard them before and it was only a Detroit thing. We were treating them like they were brand new records.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nYou know what people may not know about Godfather? Heâs one of the smartest businessmen, too. DJ Godfather has the rights to all the Chicago music that was coming out back then. He bought everything so he can rerelease, redo those tracks.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nA lot of people donât even know this story and how the whole juke scene that blew up. That came from us. Ray Barney [of Dance Mania] stopped releasing records. There were so many good records coming out of Chicago, and none of these guys knew how to release them anymore, because the only ghetto label, really, was Dance Mania.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nGodfather, fucking brilliant, buying up the catalogs of the Dance Mania artists after they left Dance Mania. He owns more Chicago anthems than youâd believe.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nIâve always wanted to release more artists, and I was looking for more artists outside of Detroit. A lot of people got left behind because they were only DJs in local clubs and radio stations, and, to me, I saw this music being a lot bigger than that.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nTo be real with you, Godfatherâs a good friend of mine, but they didnât really like [him] because of his color. How in the hell you coming up with all this ghettotech? Heâs not our color. So itâs a race issue, but we accepted him because he was a cool guy.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nWhen people found out Godfather was white, that was... a big deal.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nOther people that made records or whatever, they probably didnât like him. They were probably like, âHow in the hell he coming up with all this?â Had to be somebody helping him â which there was â but Godfather had a business mind. He was smart about it. Heâd pay you to get on his label. He putting out all the stuff on his label. âDJ Godfather presents DJ Omega,â You get what Iâm saying?\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nThereâs a lot of haters. Back then, I was probably considered the Eminem of DJing. I was the white guy that had to prove himself, you know? Back then I was dealing with a lot of that kind of shit. âWell, who the fuck is this white guy and blah, blah, blah,â you know? Then I would have vocalists doing little four- to eight-bar raps and they would use the n-word and theyâre like, âOh, why does this white guy have the n-word on it?â You know, and like, no it wasnât me, so I had to deal with all that shit.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nI know DJ Godfather the best. Because he always supported us. Heâs always been the same. I will say that about him. He never changed at all. No matter how popular he got, he was always the same cat.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nAssault and Ade, before they split up, only wanted to release their own music, which is fine â thereâs nothing wrong with that. They had a vision and they were just worried about themselves. I had a vision where if you have more artists doing this music, the genreâs going to get bigger. I had people submitting demos from France, Belgium, Australia. I wanted to get other artists excited to do this music because then they would create a scene in their city.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nGodfather had a lot of other ideas, business ventures. Eventually, heâs like, âYou know about this footwork shit?â Iâm like, âNope, donât know nothing about it.â Heâs like, âCheck this out. Hereâs a bunch of guys playing acid at 150 beats per minute. If you slow it down, you can play it in one of your sets.â Heâs like, âI know what you like, here it is!â He was really cutting edge on all the Chicago stuff.\n\nDJ Slugo\n\nGodfather is definitely the person [that] brought a lot of the newer Chicago producers and DJs to Detroit.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nI started reaching out to the artists [in Chicago] and saying, âLook, Iâll take over and Iâll release your records.â I started doing that with Deeon and Waxmaster and â god, there were tons of guys, DJ Clent. Clent is how I met [DJ] Rashad and [DJ] Spinn. They were the younger guys coming up. Clent used to drive to Detroit. Heâs like, âHey, Iâve got some guys, can they come over with me?â Iâm like, âYeah, come on, letâs go.â Next thing you know, the second and third time they come out, they had CDs of tracks. I started releasing some of it, but there was so much music that we started [the label] Juke Trax. This is before anyone knew what juke music was. They just called it the new version of ghetto house. Next thing you know, you have all these other labels from England wanting to put out Rashad and Spinn. I guarantee they probably would have never even heard of that music if it wasnât for Databass and Juke Trax.\n\nVENUES\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nOh yeah, [ghettotechâs] an east side thing. But Godfather took it and broadened it. Godfather was from the suburbs. He used to sell tapes around the schools. Thatâs how it started spreading around in the suburbs, but it was more or less an east side, west side, grimy club [scene]. Any kind of grimy club or what we call after-hour joints and cabarets.\n\nTom Hamilton\n\nCabarets are just people throwing parties. Theyâll rent a hall and theyâll throw a party from like nine to two. You sell tickets for this cabaret. Thatâs where this music was really popular. The cabarets.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nThere might be some teenagers there. There might be some 20-year-olds. There might even be some 40-year-olds in there. A cabaret is derived from the old Cotton Club days in New York. They used to have cabarets. Itâs the same thing because they would tell you to bring BYOB, bring your own alcohol. People would come in there with bags, they dressed to the nines, set their stuff up on the table and the DJ [would be] reckless.\n\nTom Hamilton\n\nEverybody showed up around 12 AM. Theyâd play hip-hop, then theyâd go into some R&B. Some old stuff so people can ballroom. Then theyâd play the harder hip-hop stuff. Then theyâd go into the techno dance stuff. Then theyâd go into the booty stuff. They close it out with the booty stuff. Thatâs when the teenagers go nuts.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nWe played a lot of [ghettotech] at The Dancery. The Dancery was all red. You walked in: red stools, red carpet. A mirror, long around the dancefloor, so people watched themselves dance, stuff like that. We even played a lot of it at this club called Maxies.\n\nRick Wade\n\nLegends was a big ghettotech club, too. I would play down there a lot with Godfather.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nThe Ritz, on the east side, on a street called Gratiot and 9 Mile. It was every Sunday, me and Leon Purse. And a guy named DJ Fila. That was every Sunday, and there were a thousand people.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nThe Outcast was, to me, the number one spot. That was the number one spot you heard everything. You had a DJ there named DJ Scott. He played it. Waxtax-N-Dre was there. I was there. Thatâs all they wanted.\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nThe Outcast was a motorcycle club that was popular for spinning ghettotech. You would hear âWhores in This Houseâ â that was the number one record. Moodymann would DJ on Saturday and I would DJ on Friday. His name was DJ House back then. He was playing more house, house and ghetto house at the same time.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nThe Outcast was a very interesting and fun place to be. It stayed open from 2 AM to 7 AM. The Outcast building was so big it held at least about 2,500 people. Best believe there were about 3,000 people in there.\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nThis was Luke Skyywalkerâs favorite club. He came here recently, he was still asking about The Outcast. When he comes to The Outcast, they would lay it out for him â there would be girls just lined up for him.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nHe was in Detroit a lot. He partied in Detroit. He hung out in Detroit. He sold a lot of records in Detroit.\n\nTom Hamilton\n\nSometimes theyâd lock the doors, too. You had to have the special knock.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nThey had the loudest soundsystem ever. It was 50,000 watts. Believe me, when you walked out, you couldnât hear nobody. It was that loud.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nKenny Dixon [Jr.] told me stories about playing at Outcast. Theyâd shoot the ceiling, which meant that he had to start the record over â that was their rewind selector command. Bang!\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nThere would be a lot of debauchery going on in the club. There were female dancers and they would have contests â they would have dick-sucking contests. In The Outcast there was anything goes â it wasnât no problem. If you were in the corner having sex, oh well! But you have to be respectful to the members. Now, if you disrespect the members, you would probably be beaten up, and thrown out, and probably chased. Iâm serious, man. They would beat you up to your car, you get in your car, then they would chase you away.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nReally, Outcast was Detroitâs most dangerous motorcycle club, ever. They still hold that to this day, but theyâre all over now. Just like the Hellâs Angels. Same thing, but the black [version]. They didnât bother nobody unless you bothered them. They just want somewhere to party. Just like everybody else, so everybody that came there respected everybody. If you came in there and started some stuff, they gonna get with you.\n\nJohn Collins\n\nIt was everywhere. It was in backyards, in house parties. Listen, I DJed a wedding reception with two young people, and they said, âAll we want is booty music for our reception.â Iâm like, âAre you serious?â Usually, at a wedding reception, you get the first dance with the bride and groom, or the father dances with the daughter. I said, âWhat about the first dance!?â âBooty music â the whole night.â\n\nJITTING\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nThe time I first saw the jit was at one of our club nights, and I used to think it was gonna be a fight. They were acting like they were about to fight each other and I was saying, âSecurity, weâve got a problem.â Next thing you know, they started dancing against each other, and it looked like theyâre having an epileptic seizure. Iâm like, âWhat the hell are they doing?â âOh, theyâre jitting. Thatâs such and such. And thatâs so and so.â Iâm like, âOh, wow. OK, itâs like break dancing. Got it.â Break dancing, but seizure-like.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\n[The difference between ghettotech and jit music] is just the tempo.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\n[Ghettotech is] anywhere between 140 BPM and 150 BPM. Some of the guys play a lot faster, which I donât personally like. There are a lot of records that are fast. When you play too fast, it just takes the funk out of it. Some of the guys play it for strictly jit parties, where itâs an hour of just boom boom boom boom boom.\n\nTom Hamilton\n\nJitting is arm movements and a bunch of leg movements. The music has to be fast to actually dance to it. It canât be slow, it doesnât look right.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nThereâs jitting and then thereâs pop-lockinâ.\n\nTom Hamilton\n\nPop-lockinâ is what my [dance] group Devo used to do. Itâs more like weâre stepping to the beat and itâs synchronized. Jitting you canât really synchronize because thereâs so much movement, itâs hard to do a routine with that. Pop-lockinâ, thereâs like five of us and weâre all doing the same thing at the same time.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nTick movements. Strong tick movements.\n\nTom Hamilton\n\n[With the jit, there are] a lot of movements with the foot when you cross over. You take the leg and cross over to the knee. You just go back and forth. Thatâs like the jit signature move. If youâre not really doing that, youâre not really jitting.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nIt just kept getting more and more popular. I guess, you know, from the â80s, whatever dance music was new in Detroit, they would jit to the newest dance music. Once my stuff got popular in the mid-â90s, they would jit to that. But it was so fast. Thatâs why I kept speeding up and speeding up. I donât know if I like that part of the history. I think it got too fast. Like, records at 150 [BPM] â¦\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nSay Iâve been DJing a party and a couple of [jit dancers] guys there. They form a circle or whatever, let them do they thing. Itâs still happening right now.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nIâve never seen any women do it though. Oh, thatâs untrue ... Iâve seen one girl do it, and she was getting it. One female. Mostly guys, and I thought they were going to fight each other. They take jittinâ seriously.\n\nTom Hamilton\n\nLet me tell you â if you get on the floor with a classy chick, dance at a party, she will walk away. She will look at you like, âMan, what are you doing?â And she will walk away. If you go to a party or cabaret, youâll see that but still you wouldnât see a person actually jitting dancing with a woman. They would be by themselves. You may see a crowd around him dancing.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI like the jit thing. I mean, I donât really jit or whatever, but it was good. Itâs another part of Detroit dance music. But I was into the girls. I wasnât making music for guys to dance to.\n\nSTRIP CLUBS\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nLeon Purse played at the strip club and he played on the television, on The New Dance Show. He played both places. So I could catch up with him at the strip club. Then he would take the record to the TV show and we would hit two birds with one stone.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nWe were looking for people on the street, thatâs really deep in the street, that we could get the records to. And the DJ in the strip club was one of those people. The rap labels at the time and those street promoters, I donât think they even hit the strip clubs to service the DJs. So they felt kind of special.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nBack in the day when techno was hot, women in titty bars danced to that stuff, and they wanted it faster than what we played it. We would put it on 45 [RPM] and the beat was like 160 BPM. They loved it that way. Thatâs where most of the fast stuff came from. You go to the titty bar, they would play that stuff fast.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nA lot of times, I never sped things up too fast, personally speaking. A lot of records are also played that fast for some of the strip clubs in the city. Thereâs girls shaking it that fast. It was crazy, but I never really played a lot in strip clubs.\n\nK-HAND\n\nWhether itâs 120 beats per minute or 150, I think it sounds great both ways. It depends on what clubs youâre playing at.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nThe faster the music got in Detroit, it just localized it more and more.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nSome of the guys I would run into, theyâd say, âHey man, I like yâall stuff but could yâall make the next tracks... all yâall tracks should be at tempo 135.â What!?\n\nTom Hamilton\n\nSo theyâd be easier to mix.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nDrunken Master was one of the strip club DJs. DJ Flex was another. DJ Hen House was another. Basically that was it. Oh, DJ Mark G.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nOne of the DJs that used to play a lot of these records in the strip club was DJ Hardbody. Hardbody was at the Black Orchid. You know whatâs so funny? He was one of the first DJs with CDJs. He was just a T&A DJ. [Ghettotech] was universal through the strip clubs. Hardbody played a lot of it. He took a chance on it. Big Can played a lot of it [too].\n\nK-HAND\n\nThe residency I had [at Club Zippers, in â92, â93], it eventually turned into â just about â a strip club. The manager there wanted me to play more of that [ghetto house] style of music. I didnât really want to fully, 100%, play that style all night. So then they got somebody else, or I ended up leaving. âI donât want to play this 24-7.â People stripping in the club. That was just my thought at the time, like, âOK, I donât want to do this 24-7 in the club. I just want to play a few of these records.â But they wanted to hear it all night.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nTitty bar DJs didnât do tricks. They played the records. They played the records fast. They mixed other records in, but they didnât do tricks and stuff like we did. They could, but [the girls] didnât like that.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nMale strippers broke a lot of records for us, too. For me, personally, [ghettotech [records] broke, I think, in the male strip clubs before the female strip clubs.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nIf you get the people on the street playing the record, everybody else would have to play the record. Thatâs how I got on the radio.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nI could go to a topless bar at 1 PM and work a record, whereas in the club, I have to wait till nighttime.\n\nRECORD STORES\n\nRick Wade\n\nI graduated from college in â91. I started off working in the cash register and in the tape section at Record Time. Shortly after that, Mike Huckaby was the manager of the dance room, I was the assistant manager, and Huckaby was in charge of all the techno, the house music â all that kind of stuff â and I was in charge of the R&B, the ghettotech, bass and hip-hop, so I would order the ghettotech records that came into the store. Jeff Mills wasnât on the air doing mixes any more. He was with Underground Resistance [in â93, â94].\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nI shopped at a few different record stores. I shopped pretty much at all of them. Professional Records, Buy-Rite Records, Memories and Melodies. Iâm leaving out one. Whoâs the other one? Record Time.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nYou had about four or five places where you bought records. You bought records at Damonâs, Damonâs was on Plymouth and Evergreen. You had Buy-Rite, you had Memories and Melodies back then. Of course, you had Record Time. You had The Music Stop, which was the DJ store part of Kendrickâs.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nWe were selling the Straight Up Detroit Shit CDs and I was going to Shantique Records, who I love. Nobody ever mentions them âcause they didnât sell vinyl. Shantique sold thousands of mix CDs.\n\nRick Wade\n\nGhettotech tracks were always the bigger sellers, flat out. Now, every so often, there would be the odd house track that would get really big, too. There was a time when everything was ghettotech.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nI worked at Record Time with Rick Wade, Mike Huckaby, Dan Bell, Claude Young for a period, Will Webb, Brian Gillespie, all these people. The music that sold the most from the room was stuff that worked for bass jocks.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nAt the time, we were only making music for Detroit and I think thatâs why [ghettotech] got successful. We didnât really care about the records hitting anywhere else. If you had a successful record in Detroit, you could sell over 2,000 copies of that record in Detroit alone. If you had a great record, you could sell it out of seven or eight record stores.\n\nDJ Nasty\n\nRecord Time would have a Top 25 wall and weâd be selling more records than LL Cool J and Eminem there. 1-15 was all the Databass, Assault records â we owned that.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI shopped [at Buy-Rite] since I was nine or ten. I knew [Buy-Rite owner] Cliff Thomas from shopping there so much.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nCliff was very cool. If he saw something in you, he wanted to help you. He was also a money machine. If you see something, heâll have you do your own stuff. If he like it, all right, letâs press it out.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nHe was everything to us. He had the hottest record store in the city. He gave us all opportunity. If you needed some money, he would put money in your pocket. He would put clothes on your back. He would give you gym shoes for your feet. Cliff was it for us. We were all 18, 19, 20. We were all young kids.\n\nK-HAND\n\nThey were getting all the classic Chicago stuff, all the classic New York stuff. Actually, that was one of the primary locations that [late Detroit DJ] Ken Collier used to shop at.\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nThere would be so much stuff at Buy-Rite. They would play a record and they had the music so loud you could feel it. You asked them what it is and they just point at it, ârow 42, two down.â It was a nice scene. And then if you knew the people, and you got in good with the people, they would hold the records for you.\n\nRick Wade\n\nWe had a lot of jungle stuff [at Record Time]. We basically couldnât sell it. I remember me and Huck talking and Huck was like, âWe got to move these jungle records. We got to figure out a way to move them.â\n\nDJ Assault\n\nA lot of Metalheadz, definitely that. Some Roni Size, but we loved the picture discs with the Reinforcers. Those were the main ones. It was several of them that was popular. It was a blue one. And a pink one.\n\nRick Wade\n\nWe had a DJ set-up in the store and thatâs what we would do was DJ in the store. Weâd have contests, âno headphones mixingâ is what weâd call it. I was doing that and there was some bass stuff and I grabbed a couple of the jungle tracks. It was a Reinforced picture disc, I remember. It had like a big pink [three] on it or something like that. I mixed that in. A lot of the jungle stuff you couldnât play, just because of the drums. It was the right tempo, but it didnât have the right feel. It was sort of this really old school drum feel and sound â Motown-ish drums, almost. This had the same sort of breakbeat pattern, but the drums were rougher, thicker. When I mixed that, one of the Four Horsemen, Niko, was like, âMan, whatâs that? Whatâs that? Gimme that!â After that, I donât know, a few days later, everybody was in there buying those jungle records. Thatâs how jungle got fit into the whole ghettotech family.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nWe used to take a trip to Chicago once a week to get records. We never knew about Buy-Rite. That was way back. When we found out Buy-Rite had the same stuff, we started going there.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nAt first, Buy-Rite was the only store that got the Dance Mania records. I played a lot of Dance Mania and Chicago records, because it was different.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nYou never referred to it as Chicago. They just called it Dance Mania. I used to laugh because I would be like, âThatâs ghettotech. What are you talking about?â To me, it was always hard to tell who was from Chicago [and who was from Detroit] unless you knew the artist because it sounded exactly the same. I didnât find out that Slugo and people like that were from Chicago until I read about it. Everything that was coming off of Godfatherâs label, I always assume it was somebody here because there were always some guys in the street making some quick little beat and they knew Godfather would put the track out.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI think Chicago was on its own thing. Theyâre really about their own stuff. I think we play more Chicago than they play of our records.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nDetroit was the only city that would play Chicago, Miami bass and Detroit records. Chicago wasnât doing that. Miami wasnât doing that. They didnât even know our sound. Actually, when I played in Miami a few times, they were looking at me like I was crazy at first. Chicago didnât understand. They were only playing their ghetto house records.\n\nDJ Slugo\n\nChicago is a very finicky city. Itâs like, they donât like nobody. Chicago doesnât like anyone. Thatâs why you donât see a lot of artists breaking out of Chicago, because itâs real hard. You got to really be a superhero musically in order for them to adapt to you, you know what I mean? Thereâs a lot of Chicago artists who donât get love in Chicago.\n\nRick Wade\n\nThe Chicago stuff was influencing the Detroit stuff, but I donât really think the Detroit stuff was influencing the Chicago stuff so much, because of how fast Detroit was playing the records; that was something exclusive to Detroit.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI loved the DJ Funk records. I liked DJ Deeon. I liked DJ Slugo. I think that was the main three. Even Paul Johnson. What was the other guy? Maybe Gant-Man.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nâDik-N-Ballz.â I couldnât believe that they was really doing that shit, you know? It was like comedy. DJ Deeon. It was funny, like a Miami bass lyric, you know? It was full of machismo. âThis is the baddest motherfucker. He can get all the women,â you know. He does what he want to do. It just came off on the record, and they were so simple.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nI used to work at Record Time. I was working in a record room and thereâd be a lot of times where [DJ Assault] felt like his records werenât on the wall and mine were because I was working there, but you know, I felt the same about Buy-Rite. All that little shit turned into more dumb shit and then more dumb shit. I honestly couldnât tell you to this day, âHey, I was mad at you for this reason and you fucked me and this,â I still couldnât even tell you why. It was just a lot of dumb shit and a lot of built-up hype amongst other DJs that werenât producing records. Itâs just a lot of people stirring up the pot, too, I think.\n\nDJ Assault\n\n[Godfatherâs] not a rival, because itâs hard to copy personality. Thatâs something you cannot duplicate, my personality. I didnât see that, plus he only made beats. It was my voice on the record. Itâs not Godfatherâs voice on records. I guess if it was any rival, it could only be as DJs or something. I donât see it as competitive. People get it twisted, even rappers. Sports is competitive, you compete. When you compete in music, what does anybody gain? Thatâs not a competitive arena for anything. Is it a prize, is it a Super Bowl, a rap Super Bowl? DJ Super Bowl? Whoâs really the best? I guess itâs the DMC, if youâre interested in a battle DJ. I never cared about that. Battle DJs donât even make people dance, you cannot dance to a bunch of scratching.\n\nRick Wade\n\nThe Top 25 wall was based on the sales in store of the records. That was how you earned your position on the wall. A lot of people didnât understand that. A lot of people thought that Top 25 was just [Mike] Huckabyâs personal preference, but it wasnât like that at all. It was strictly based on the sales. People would be upset thinking their record isnât up there because we just donât want to put it up there. Or we made a deal with some other artist to put their record up there. Something along those lines. Conspiracy theory type of things. I told many a cat, look man, you stuff isnât up there because itâs not selling.\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nThere would be some politics over that. Definitely. I didnât really think too much of it then, but I was like, âWhy is this record up here? This record is not even that good.â\n\nMr Deâ\n\nWe had unfriendly rivalry [with Record Time]. It wasnât no friendly rivalry at all. The rivalry didnât become friendly until I left Buy-Rite and started Electrofunk. When I was at Buy-Rite Records, we hated them motherfuckers and we made no fuckinâ bones about it. We called them everything but the style of God on a regular basis. I couldnât stand Rick Wadeâs ass until years later. I love him to death now.\n\nRick Wade\n\nThere were a lot of those Billboard people trying to bully their way into the Top 25. They had reps in the area who would come into the store and try to pressure us to put something in the Top 25. I always would think about it: you are in here hounding us to put something up there â at least offer us some money or something if itâs that big of a deal. If itâs that stressful for you that you have to make a special trip, a couple times a week to the store to question us about it. At least try to make it worth our while!\n\nTHE NAME\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nItâs the bastard son of Detroit techno that Detroit techno would like to pretend never happened.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nThe basis of the sound is the ghetto side of techno â records that could be played in the inner city. Shakeâs records, some of Mayday, some Carl Craig, some Mike Banks. Anything that didnât sound too harsh, too European. It could be played in the hood. Then I think the layer on top of that would be Miami bass. Then hard, hard house records. Then the gel putting it together would be hip-hop.\n\nTom Hamilton\n\nI didnât hear the term ghettotech âtill maybe â96 or something. At first, they were calling it just booty. It was just booty music. That was coming from the Luke Skyywalker stuff from 2 Live Crew. Ghettotech, that name came later on.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nI think it was like â98 when I first heard it, âghettotech,â you know. I donât know. Itâs somewhere around there that the sound started cementing. I think Godfather was better than us in seasoning a particular sound. He would get a particular sound he produced for, and he would produce it over and over and over again. We were more all over the place. We wanted to make these records that we could mix together, and we didnât want it to all to sound alike, so we were more of a mosaic in that way.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nWhen you start saying âghettotech,â we didnât really have a name for it like that because we played it all together. It wasnât separated. Itâd be like, we know the differences, but we called it booty.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nTo me, techno is techno. Thereâs no such thing as ghettotech and just regular techno.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nAde didnât call it [ghettotech]. Ade called it electro funk. Thatâs what he called it, thatâs why he created the label [Electrofunk].\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nThe style that was later coined as ghettotech was more of a feeling. That included Miami bass records, techno records, house records, hip-hop records. It was a hodge-podge of different kinds of records. Records like [Playskule, 12 Tech Mob, K.O.T.] were very important because they got played right along with all that other stuff. âPick it Up, Pick it Upâ by Home Team, that record got played a lot. They started here in Detroit. It was recorded on 8 Mile and Myers and ended up getting picked up by Luke [Skyywalker].\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nTo my best knowledge, a writer named Hobey Echlin [helped coin the term âghettotechâ]. At the time he was writing for Urb Magazine and the Metro Times. He was the first journalist that supported it. Probably because he was from Detroit and understood it. For years, people never understood the music. Theyâre like, this isnât straight techno. This is not Derrick May. This is not Juan. We donât get this. It was just different from the norm because it was techno-meets-house-party style. It was creating this big buzz and Hobey started writing about it and he came up with the name because it didnât have a name.\n\nHobey Echlin\n\nDisco D [David Shayman] and I had this idea to call it ghettotechno, shortened to ghettotech. It made it sound a little less regional and more like something you could export.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nDisco D is who came up with the [term] ghettotech. He was in my basement one day and we were talking. He said, âMan, what do you call this music that you play?â I said, âMe and my boy call it tech shit. We call it tech shit.â He said, âBut itâs so funky. The only place this music is playing is in the ghetto.â I said, âWell, what are we gonna call it? You gonna call it ghettotech?â He said, âThis is what it is. Itâs ghettotech. Itâs hood. Itâs good. Weâre gonna call it ghettotech,â and thatâs where it came from, right in my basement.\n\nThat was one of his first records, but he told me that, âGary, I got this other record that Iâm working on. I want you to hear it and Iâm going to finish it so you can play it on the radio.â He usually let me hear everything he works on, but this time he was like the secret squirrel hiding its nut. Finally he calls me about 3:30 in the afternoon. He was at my house in about 25 minutes. He was like, âBring your ass outside, boy,â so I say, âOK.â I come outside and I jump in the car and I hear: [beatboxes] âWhen itâs hot / Do you need another drink? / What you think?â Iâm sitting in here like, âOh my God, this record is so sweet.â We sat in the car and listened to it three times and we just went out and celebrated. I said, âYeah, man. Youâve got a banger.â\n\nWaxtax-N-Dre\n\nHe just pretty much took off. Then he started going toward another direction toward hip-hop, I guess.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nI thought he was an absolute poser. When I met him, he was with Aaron-Carl. He was just kind of a sleazeball â kinda want to take something from you kind of shit, you know what I mean? A guy that was coming into a studio to see what equipment you using. He was one of those types. He would come here and I would instruct my people to leave him in the fucking lobby. I didnât want him to see or hear what I was working on.\n\nGary Chandler\n\n[Disco D] did way more than ghettotech. Trust me when I tell you. If you guys pull up 50 Cent and listen to âSki Mask,â you can tell what type of music he could do. He was the next wave that would have took us from ghettotech to like... Disco D was talented enough to produce for Jay Z. Thatâs why he moved to New York, because he was ready for that next level.\n\nBrian Gillespie\n\nHe wanted to become big; he didnât want to be some local guy making records. He was young and he wanted to be on top.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nHe did a record with Twista in Chicago. I mixed that record, and I distributed that record. I probably got about 700 of those motherfuckers right here. I did an interview with Hobey Echlin and he said, âWell, you hold on to âem, because Disco D was great, and youâre going to sell every single last one of those copies.â Like he was fucking Elvis or something.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nHe could have did it. It would have been a Detroit producer producing mainstream music, which would have been crazy. Imagine Disco D doing an Usher record. Thatâs where he was going with it, it was going that way.\n\nBrian Gillespie\n\nWhen he passed away [in 2007], it was really hard on us.\n\nDJ Slugo\n\nI didnât even know he was sick. From us hanging I never knew that he had issues, I had no clue. He hung out with me, went to all the dangerous neighborhoods and heâs just walking around like, âYeah, Iâm cool, everythingâs cool, I donât care.â Iâm like, âWow.â Wasnât afraid or anything. Very good guy. Nothing but positive things to say about that brother.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nHe was loved. Everybody loved him. You could tell he was on his way, you know what Iâm saying? You never know what people are going through. He was going through it, obviously. I was shocked. It shocked me to no end. Itâs still a little hard to deal with because that was my partner. When you meet a person and their spirit touches you, itâs way beyond music. He was a great person, man. He cared more about other people than he definitely did his self, you know? If you were close to him, that was it. Thereâs nothing that he wouldnât have looked out there for you. He was never selfish. He went to Europe one time and he sent me a bottle of liquor. I still have it, to this day, corked.\n\nGODZILLA\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nâGodzilla.â\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nThe theme from Godzilla was another [anthem].\n\nDJ Slugo\n\nThere ended up being a big hoopla about that record.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\n[Slugo] didnât even make that record. From what I understand â and I kind of understood this later â a guy named RP Boo made that record. It never got released because Dance Mania went out of business. It was an old record. It was a B-side. It was on a DJ Slugo record. Finally, I called him. I go, âLook it. I think this record could be big. Do you want to release it? I think this will definitely be a big thing in Detroit.â Heâs like, âYeah, we could release it.â\n\nRP Boo\n\nMe and Slugo, we was real good friends. Even with âBaby Come On,â âThe Ice Cream Truckâ and the other tracks, he was the type of person who would always try his best to look out for people. Dance Mania had just collapsed. We wanted to push this to get it out on other labels and give other labels an opportunity. What had happened was that... We didnât know that it took off, because I was at work. I didnât go to Detroit. I didnât go nowhere.\n\nDJ Slugo\n\nWhen I first started out, I was one of the ones in Chicago who had all the equipment before any of the other DJs. At the time, RP Boo was one of the people I was teaching how to produce, on a [Roland] R-70. I end up getting two of them. I loaned him one and let him use it to make beats. [Then] I needed it back because I sold the other one. So when he brought it back, it had the samples to the Godzilla record. When I heard it, I felt like he didnât chop them up right. It was too muddy, and the samples wasnât clean enough.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\n[Slugo and I] worked out a deal and then after itâs released he kind of told me that RP Boo made it. Iâm like, âWait a second. Is there an issue here? Whatâs going on?â Heâs like, âOh no, he owed me a favor.â He owed him money or a favor or something. I donât know. Slugo was owed something from RP Boo, so Slugo released some tracks. Or he gave Slugo the tracks. I donât know the exact story.\n\nDJ Slugo\n\nI went to the record store and asked them for [the original record], because I wanted to sample it from the record itself. So when I played them what I wanted, one of the guys that worked in the store was like, âOh, thatâs Pharoahe Monch, thatâs off of the Pharoahe Monch album.â So I chopped it up, did it the way that I want to do it. I actually never released it â I released it on a mixtape one time, and that was basically it. So then I meet Godfather, and then he asked me for a song. But the song he wanted was the âWhere The Rats?â record. So we released that and then we needed a record to be an album filler, because I didnât have enough records that I thought were strong enough to give to him at the time. So I had [âGodzillaâ] in the archive and I just threw it on there.\n\nRP Boo\n\nWord got back, it was, âHey, Slugo, heâs taking credit for your track that you did.â I already knew that because Slugo asked me, could he do a remix. âFine, no problem.â I actually gave him my record so he could do it, chop his samples up. I was like, âYeah, I know Slugo has a remix.â Word got back like, âNo, itâs not the remix that heâs claiming. Itâs the one that you actually did.â When I saw the label, and I saw the print. It was DJ Slugoâs remixes, but that wasnât the remix. It was the actual track. He was able to put out what he want because I had no access to Godfather. Thatâs when it just went, âNo, I canât do this no more.â Slugo was not the only person that I had these problems with. I had problems with this with other people.\n\nDJ Slugo\n\nThe reason I felt like I didnât care [about the track] was because of the samples. Weâd never cleared the samples. So I was like, âI donât care, I donât want no problem from this record, you can do whatever you want to do with it.â [Godfather] was cool with that, and the record took off. Then the big old thing came out where people thought I sampled RP Booâs record. I was like, âWell, all you gotta do is listen to the record, and listen to the record that Iâve done and you will hear that the production is the production I done.â And then if you look at the record, I even gave Boo credit. I gave him credit for the original concept, because the idea was his. I heard it from him first. I was like, âOh, I like that but you did it wrong. So Iâma do my version. And I asked permission when I didnât even have to.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nThe record started doing good but then I thought it could do better, so we did a remix record. I did a remix and a few other people did remixes. Then the remix I did was the one that got the most popular. Yeah. Story of my life: that had a sample in it and it could only go so far, because we got offered a lot of money to put it in a car commercial for an international commercial and we tried to clear the sample from the Godzilla people and they wouldnât clear it.\n\nSAMPLING\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nWeâd, say, bootleg [a] record and do our own thing with it. It was still strictly speaking illegal. It was a sample, so you were liable. But nobody ever bothered and if you did, you would just sample something of theirs. You would have this kind of gentlemanâs exchange. I know we did it back and forth with Chicago all day long. Because [Dance Mania owner] Ray Barney and Cliff were good friends.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\n[Ghettotech producers] used to sample a lot of the Drexciya stuff and our stuff. A lot of the Detroit DJs who were trying to learn how to do the music â when the samples got popular and those first DJ mixes had the samples on âem â thatâs what they used to do. They would sample Drexciya, or especially Dopplereffekt once Gerald [Donald] went solo. I didnât really dog it. I thought it was good, because I thought Assault and Adeâ really did some stuff that was unique. You could see they had musicianship.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nWith samples, thereâs no publishing. That was why the samples [in my tracks] decreased, when I saw how much money there was in publishing that I knew nothing about in the â90s.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nIâve run into people who tried to sample our stuff. How are you going to put that out without coming to us? That was what I was really mad about. I liked that people like Moodymann and Mike Banks put a stop to that, and the Burden brothers. Because they used to have these mix CDs that they put together. And theyâre out there in Belle Isle Park, selling them all, with all our tracks on there. Thatâs what I didnât like about ghettotech. I canât blame all those guys, but a lot of them did that, and they were making a lot of money. They put a stop to that. People in Detroit are cold. Mike Banks has got power. Mike was like, âMan, yâall canât be doing this shit.â\n\nTom Hamilton\n\nYou all need to take this record off. âBut man, if I take these records off, itâs not going to sell.â âThatâs not our problem, youâve got to pay us.â\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nAnd they stopped. Thatâs the power of some of the people here in Detroit.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nIâve had numerous artists sample me. I contact them, âOh, well itâs just on SoundCloud, so Iâm not making any money off of it.â âYeah, you are.â âWell, how do you figure that? If SoundCloudâs for free?â âBecause you took this record, it made you more popular, and you got gigs off of it. Thatâs how you made money.â The game has turned into giving out songs and getting gigs off of it. Thatâs why thereâs so much grey area right now in music and sampling stuff.\n\nOVERSATURATION\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nYou had a lot of other people came up, like B. Calloway, DJ Omega, all these guys out of Chicago and stuff. But their stuff always had the same sound to it. At least Godfather could always pick a track that was kind of commercial. Him and Assault and Ade, they made songs that you could actually remember. Some of these other guys were just making stuff, whatever the phrase of the week was, that was the record. If I said to you, âHey, you a bitchâ â next week, that song was âHey, you a bitch / hey, you a bitch.â You know what I mean? âThatâs just my baby daddy,â or...\n\nTom Hamilton\n\nâ...Let me see your check stubâ; âBeat that bitch with a bat.â\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nYeah. âUgly girls be quiet,â it was all kind of just ... it got silly. Theyâd be like, âDid you get this one?â Iâm like, âMan, itâs the same beat, just a different phrase on the top.â We kind of liked that because it was like, thatâs not going to last too long. I used to get so many, thatâs why I still like Ade and Assault, because they didnât just oversaturate everything.\n\nTommy Hamilton\n\nSome of the same artists were putting out, I kid you not, two or three records at the same time. Which is actually killing yourself. Record labels have a system for how they release records. Techno followed the mainstream industry template. Weâre going to release this and weâre not going to release another release until four months down the line. Weâre going to work this for four months. Now you have people that donât know that system, theyâre dropping a record, and theyâre dropping another record next week. Which actually killed the previous record.\n\nDJ Assault\n\n[There were] other little labels that were saying, âDo something that sound like Electrofunk stuff.â I know this. I hear from people.\n\nRick Wade\n\nI would say thereâs two parts to the ghettotech [era]. Thereâs the golden era, where every mix show was ghettotech. It was on the TV, on The New Dance Show, every club was playing it. Tons of guys in Detroit were making it, bringing it into the store every time they had a new release. Then, things started to change. It was during that change when Godfather and Databass started to come up.\n\nDJ Dick\n\nSometimes, when youâre in the middle of doing something, you really donât realize how big it is. It was DJ Godfather, Brian Gillespie and myself. So it was the three of us. Paul Martindale had run the label for us for a few years. At that point, we had to start a distribution company, which I started running. Godfather was just pushing out product. We were distributing Keith Tucker, Erik Travis. We had distributed a whole bunch of labels, a whole bunch of records from a lot of great artists. We got the reputation that we could sell records and we would pay people on them. We had a little tiny office. It was a six foot-wide office by about 40 feet long. One whole wall was just full of records and product. A fax machine and two computers, and two people worked non-stop, 40 hours, just distributing records and pushing records out.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nIt was getting confusing with the distributors because they were like, âIs this an electro record? Is this one of these ghetto records that youâre trying do?â We had to create a side label, Databass Records, because we were doing a lot of electro as well. We were like, âLetâs have Databass Records to be the more ghetto sounding stuff, and Twilight 76 would be strictly electro.â Everything â Databass and Twilight â was myself, DJ Dick and Brian Gillespie. To us, it was all Detroit music. It was all mix music to us. Thatâs what we called it. We had to separate it for distribution purposes. Otherwise, I would have just put it all on one label and said it is what it is and if you donât like this record, youâll like the next one or whatever. Certain people are very particular to different sounds.\n\nKeith Tucker\n\nThat was the thing about Twilight 76: the roster. It was like 30, 40 different artists on there. He was picking up DJ Deeon. Every week it was something different. I was amazed that I would get, like, this many records in a pile. It would be like, Erik Travis on there. Ade was on there once. Assault, Deeon, Omega, Slugo, B. Calloway was on there. DJ Diâjital was on there. I did an EP on there called When Metroplex Was Metroplex.\n\nDJ Dick\n\nThere were four radio stations on the weekends that would play this music [in the mid-â90s]. It was extremely common for me to go from one radio station to the next, right after the other, in the same ten seconds, and we had either produced the record or it was on our label or we distributed it. It was an amazing time, because we had completely controlled the airwaves at that point.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nAssaultâs getting bigger, Godfatherâs getting bigger. They slowed down on the music and they were traveling, going overseas. Especially Aux 88, they were doing shows, too.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nPeople in San Francisco know records. People in London know records. Iâm shipping records in Australia. Iâm shipping records to Austria.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nI remember the first time I DJed in Brazil, it was like a Copacabana beach. They had never seen a battle DJ play dance music, and thatâs what kept our scene separate from techno. You were either a hip-hop battle DJ or you were a club DJ; there was nothing in the middle. And thatâs what ghettotech was â it was fierce DJing. Jaws would drop. People wouldnât even dance because they couldnât stop watching.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nIn 1998, when Jon Layne, the Intuit Solar guy, was involved in this stuff, he organized a show for all of us â Ectomorph, DJ Godfather and DJ Assault â in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We did this event on a boat. It was really close to canneries, where they were canning tuna or something. The smell was disgusting. We played on the helicopter pad.\n\nDJ Rap, the junglist, had come over because Intuit Solar was releasing her as well. Watching the competition between Assault and Godfather for her â priceless. Thereâs this jet ski moment, where Godfather almost flipped his jet ski trying to impress her. Eventually, Assault tried to woo her with rhymes â he made up sexual rhymes for her. Godfather was one of those guys who would do that weird game, âOh, I caught you looking at this circle, Iâm going to punch you.â Youâre like, âDude, Iâm over 20 years old. Why the fuck are you doing this game?â Assault was a little bit older and a little bit more mature, and he would just make up a rhyme about how stupid Brian was being. It was priceless. I have never been more entertained while travelling, ever.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nMe, Aux 88 and DJ Godfather were all booked by John Collins first, to go overseas. The very first place we played was at Mayday, for [techno and house producer] Westbam in Germany. Thatâs the very first time that we took that sound overseas. That was in â98. It was huge. They had drum & bass. I didnât know what the hell a drum & bass was. I brought some of them drum & bass influences back. You heard them on my records after that.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nAll the guys that were making music for the last six, seven years are now artists that are traveling. Thatâs when Erik Travis and these other guys were getting bigger, because they had time to stay in the city and make music.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI played the Erik Travis records because it wasnât trying to be a DJ Assault record. I like that stuff.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nErik Travis was such a creative Detroit artist. Heâs such a good dude. He had a different sound and he had a different air. His music was very quick-paced, very fast, but had more drums and snares than the usual Detroit records and a different pitch on the drum line. One of his best records to me was âRollinâ Through Time.â âRollinâ Through Timeâ is probably his biggest Detroit record.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nThereâs a Starski & Clutch record that was too futuristic to get released that is one of the strangest, most amazing records Iâve ever heard. I wonder what wouldâve happened had they released it. It was super fast, and Todd [Osborne] was trying a new technique of pitching things up where he was making music for the super-fast thing. Some of the stuff that he chose to pitch up was super strange and super cool.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI kind of took it for granted. I donât really know how to process it all. It was good â people were interested overseas, like Europe, Australia, even South America. I would go to those places, but I donât know what I was thinking. I donât think I really capitalized on people wanting you to go to all those places and play all those places. I really had no plan. You know, just going to play, come home. There must be a lot more to it â and to those particular markets â if people are flying you all over the world. But Iâm just looking at it like, âOh, this is fun.â\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nI recorded Electronicfunkyshit in 1999, and released it in 2000. A portion of it would have been a part of me and Assaultâs next album, so it wouldâve probably been a DJ Assault album, at least half of it. But we broke up, and Iâm like âOh shit, I donât have an artist!â At the same time, it allowed me to have this freedom, this creative freedom. I said, âOK, I donât have to produce this, so it doesnât have to be as hip-hop, because heâs a hip-hop performer.â\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI didnât want it to end the way it did, to be honest. Iâm not that type of guy âtill you push me. I never wanted lawyers or any of that stuff.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nI would have to talk to my lawyer to see how much of that I can even talk about, in terms of our split. Iâm legally bound to only say that we split because of creative differences. I canât get into the details of that.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nAt some points in time, I wish we couldâve kept going. I talked to him in 2012, but I donât know. I think we just passed the time. I donât think that it could ever go back to that. I think we missed it, although we agreed on a lot of things. I donât know. Some things just outgrow the situation. Itâs unfortunate. He taught me a lot, even from that. A partnership is similar to a marriage. I canât even imagine a man and a woman thatâs been married and then had kids and separated. The songs are kind of like kids. I think it matured me, man.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nI mean, we talk. We havenât spoken in about two years. We didnât speak at all for over ten. Then we started going back and forth a little bit, on Facebook. I miss being friends with him. We had a lot of history. A lot of stories.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI honestly think I lost people with some of the [Jefferson Ave] stuff that I tried to pull off. Not everything, but some of the things that I tried to pull off, it was just too far from the core audience. Itâs a business and you have to be very careful what you do as an artist, because I donât really think you can be something different once you have a fan base.\n\nTHE END\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nWhat was exciting about ghettotech is that it was outlaw. What, eventually, was boring about it was it was kind of hard to watch 90 minutes of it.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nTechno was good till 2000, 2001. After that, people started doing hip-hop. Hip-hop took over the whole nation. We couldnât go to no party without playing any Jay Z, any Biggie, any 2Pac. None of that type of stuff. But you could go to a club, and you could play ghettotech and theyâd look at you like youâre crazy. âWe donât do that stuff no more.â\n\nDJ Nasty\n\nInstead of slowing it down, we were making the music faster and faster. We started making music at 140 BPM, then 150, 160, 170 â it became too fast. Youâd have a couple tracks here and there that could cross over, like âAss N Titties,â but for the most part, we didnât evolve what was going on.\n\nDJ Dick\n\n[The music is] very stagnant right now, Iâm just being honest. Youâre talking to somebody who saw the sales numbers and what was happening. I would never say anything is dead, but the release schedule has been a lot slower than it was back in the day when we were doing eight records a month.\n\nHobey Echlin\n\nWhat was so perfect about ghettotech, but also doomed it, was how much of a Detroit phenomenon it was and how popular it was locally. It couldnât diversify.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nThatâs why it kind of only went so far, because itâs at its own unique tempo. Thereâs only a handful of people doing it in Detroit, Chicago and around the world. I kind of want to take certain elements and slow it down. I have a lot of new stuff coming out thatâs 125 BPM. Picture kind of slowed down ghettotech stuff. Iâm doing it to where it could cross over now more. Iâm not just making the music for Detroit only anymore, because that eraâs kind of gone.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nThe downfall of ghettotech, in my opinion, was that none of them were satisfied with making incredibly catchy, brilliant, short attention-span music. They wanted to switch to making formal hip-hop. They were like, âThis is stupid, this is easy.â What was so easy for them was hard for other people.\n\nRick Wade\n\nClear Channel started to come into town.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nClear Channel, what they did, they Xed out... Honestly, Clear Channel really didnât do anything, if you really think about it. Itâs the people that did it. They didnât want to hear it no more; it was done.\n\nRick Wade\n\nFormats on the radio station started changing, from house and ghettotech to more R&B and hip hop. People werenât hearing house on the radio anymore, except for late night Saturday night. You could still hear ghettotech because they would still play that mixed in with the hip-hop and stuff, but not like it was before where it was just all ghettotech. Now it was 70, 80% R&B, hip-hop, 30% ghettotech, less than that. The ghettotech sales werenât doing like they used to do. This was early 2000s. By the mid-â00s it was a done deal. It was almost like Godfather and the Databass crew were the sole champions of ghettotech at that point. There was still a couple of guys still doing stuff, but in Detroit they were the ones really pushing it.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nAfter the radio stations hired all the DJs â Gary always had a radio job, but Waxtax-N-Dre didnât and Fingers didnât â they started bringing in this Atlanta-style program. It stopped being a Detroit thing and it started turning into an Atlanta thing. You started seeing less independent promotion in the clubs. It was mostly all radio stations, all corporate. At the same time, digital downloading came in. Napster and all that stuff that killed record stores. So the radio stations killed the DJs, killed the independent promoters. Downloading killed the record stores â and those were the two pillars of the time.\n\nGary Chandler\n\nThe music slowed down tremendously because we didnât have any artists. All our artists that were doing the music were now traveling, so they didnât have time to do the music. They might have did one record here or there, but for the most part they were traveling and the music scene for ghettotech took a major, major hit between 2003 and 2005, 2006. That hit so bad that the only resurrection that you can do with it is to play the stuff that was out before.\n\nRick Wade\n\nThatâs why, if you hear somebody do a ghettotech set today, 90% of their stuff is going to be from the early â90s, mid-â90s.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nâAss N Tittiesâ is licensed by Sony. I just became smarter, and I concentrated on the publishing aspect â thatâs what gains the catalog kind of invisible value. 22 Jump Street, a lot of people really didnât know about that deal.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nIâve been licensing a lot of it to television and TV commercials. Iâm on the newest Adidas commercials in South Korea.\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI do a lot of stuff behind the scenes where people donât really see the value of it. Maybe I donât DJ all the time anymore. Maybe I donât even care about that because Iâm more into, âHow do you make money off of music?â DJing is good, but you have to be... itâs kind of like diversifying.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nThe single reason why I stopped putting out a lot of artists is because of the artists. They donât understand the business. They think if they hear a record in a mix show on the radio theyâre owed $1,000. They donât understand that. They think because you sell 1,000 records at $3.50 a piece that thereâs $3,500 to be made. Did you forget we had to master it? Did you forget we had to press the record? Did you forget we had to ship it?\n\nLEGACY\n\nDJ Assault\n\nI think most people in Detroit â some of the older house and techno type of producers â hated what we were doing, to be honest. They might not say it, but they was like, âWhy would you do this?â It didnât conform to anything, so it pissed some people off. It was on the side of the raunchy, ignorant type of stuff, but it was all for fun. People think, âYouâre like that in real life,â but I just like to have fun, and house got ... I donât know. Nothing was exciting about it anymore.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nI always thought the Detroit dance music community always looked at us as the dumb, illiterate uncle. We never got the respect, man.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nWhat people eventually called ghettotech is a more blue collar music form. Detroit techno had been much more for middle class, upper-middle class people. Carl Craig, Derrick May, they werenât trying to appeal to the blue collar workers of Detroit â they wanted to elevate Detroit to this utopia.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nAlan Oldham was a big critic. He would call our records unintelligent and base. He thought Detroit was stupid for even listening to our stuff. We gave [techno] legs in a lot of ways. I think we gave records like Juanâs catalogue life. We gave people like Aux 88 a place to be heard by their own people. If it were not for ghettotech, our own people â black, inner city Detroit people â wouldnât know our records, a lot of the techno artists.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nI took Sal Principato, from Liquid Liquid, to see [2 Live Crew]. I was in Miami with DJ Godfather, and weâre like, âWe just really want to go see 2 Live Crew do a performance.â Weâre like, âWeâre going to do this! Sal, you got to come along, weâre going to do this before we go see Larry Heard.â âOK!â We go.\n\nWhen we leave, he told me the five kinds of West African music that it was a fusion of. Thereâs this spiritual dance of the ass. The woman has on a skirt that goes all the way to the ground, but the way she moves her ass, itâs like a spiritual thing. It was deeper than what people said it was. Hereâs a guy who has actually spent a lot of time working with Caribbean music and African music directly, which gave me a totally different perspective on it. To me, it was all just naughty, or a strip club or something. Itâs like, you wouldnât play it in polite company.\n\nDJ Fingers\n\nMissy Elliot used âClearâ in âLose Control.â Sir Mix-A-Lot used âTechnicolorâ on âBaby Got Back.â I was like, âHey, wait a minute â whatâs going on here?â Perfect example are these years right now: Drake and Nicki Minaj, âTruffle Butterâ â thatâs a house track, a lot of people donât know that. You see how hip-hop artists trying to come to the techno and house side? The new songs out now with Kanye West [âFadeâ], he used Mr Fingers.\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nYou know âPlayer haters in this house / if you see âem point âem outâ? Ends up on a Timbaland record.\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nYou know what ghettotech is now? Dirtybird. Someone like Claude [VonStroke]. Iâve known Claude before he was even a DJ. Claude grew up on techno and ghettotech, and he put his spin on it. A lot of the Dirtybird stuff has a ghettotech influence.\n\nMr. Deâ\n\nThe only time they would know my R&B records was if it became a hit. They didnât know all the work Iâve done, but they know âAss N Titties.â They know âSex on the Beach.â They know âMy A.U.X. Mind.â\n\nBrendan Gillen\n\nIt was the indigenous music of Detroit. The indigenous music of Detroit was not âStrings Of Life.â It wasnât even âShades Of Jae.â It would be like [Mike Banksâs] âXÂ²,â âIâll see you there in the night.â\n\nDJ Godfather\n\nThereâs no other genre that created different dance moves. Thereâs no other genre that created their own style of turntablist. When it was playing on three different radio stations and you could hear it for three or four hours straight at one time, that says something. Thatâs a movement."
