        "text": "It’s quiet. My son recently headed to Michigan for his senior year, and my husband and I took our daughter to Texas to begin her freshman year. And now … there’s a little less energy and excitement in our house. They always say the days are long and the years are short, and Jonathan and I feel it now. But silence isn’t always such a bad thing. Silence lets you think. Reflect. Process. It gives you space. Obviously, I love and miss both my kids. But I’m also taking advantage of the quiet. Because silence is what allows you to consider and embrace change. It helps you think about your status quo and navigate how to change it. At Challenger, we embrace a skill known as Constructive Tension, in which a seller compels a customer to change their status quo by asking Powerful Questions, investigating assumptions, and strategically employing silence. I don’t know how our status quo will shake out. But this week, I’m embracing this unusual quiet to ask some Powerful Questions and investigate some assumptions about how our life might change. What can I do now that I couldn’t do when we had both kids at home? How do I make sure that they feel connected to us, even when they’re not here? What can I learn about myself that I don’t know yet, with the space I have now? This strategic silence and Constructive Tension may feel a little uncomfortable — but I know it’s a force that works. And I can’t wait to see the results. #emptynesters\n\nI’ve been glued to my TV, absorbing leadership lessons from my favorite influencers: the Olympians of 2024. Sure, their speed, athleticism, and jaw-dropping ability is inspiring. But the real awe from Paris 2024 is what we can learn from these athletes’ strategy and behavior. Here are my five biggest takeaways. Celebrate the little wins, as much as the big ones. Suni Lee suffered through not one but two serious kidney diseases in 2023. She didn’t think she would even make it to competition, much less return with three medals. So when she fell in the beam finals, she took it in stride and said that getting to the beam finals was a bonus; just being in Paris was enough. Surround yourself with people who help you achieve your stretch goals. Mondo Duplantis set the world record for pole vault eight times before the Olympics. He secured the gold medal, but had one jump left. He didn’t have to take it to medal — so he consulted his coach (his dad) and his trainer (his mom). They encouraged him to go for the 9th. He hyped the crowd into clapping for him and confidently cleared the new world record. Embrace passion, authenticity, and resilience. There are so many 2024 Olympic heroes who embody this — Stephen Nedoroscik (his job is pommel horse), Kristen Faulkner, Noah Lyles, Snoop Dogg. But I think my favorite might be Yared Nuguse, a surprise 1500m bronze medalist, who says he’ll quit running when it’s not fun so he can fulfill his dream of being an orthodontist. Focus on your goals, even when they feel impossible. Maggie Steffens, who captains the U.S. water polo team, asked for financial help last May, noting that many of her teammates took two or three jobs to afford to compete. Flava Flav became their financial sponsor and hype man — and now they’re in the semi-finals and enjoying a bigger profile than ever. And I can’t stop choking up whenever I see athletes from Ukraine, Israel, South Sudan, or other countries in crisis, setting aside the pain to give all to their sport. Tune out the noise, focus on your strengths, and filter out the haters. You can’t talk about the 2024 Olympics without talking about Simone Biles. You can be the best of all time, and people are still going to criticize you. Simone meditated, told her critics exactly what she thought of their nonsense (I would go after anyone who insulted my hair, whether I won a gold medal or not), and then soared (literally) to become the most decorated gymnast in history. The Olympics bring out the best in the world’s athletes, but I think they bring out the best in humanity too — what we have in common is stronger than what splits us apart. So what were your favorite moments and what lessons did you learn? Tell me in the comments!\n\nSpeaking and listening. Two important parts of life, deeply connected, and with the possibility to be wildly at odds with one another. In one of my favorite podcasts — The Life Coach School with Brooke Castillo — she notes that the things you say to yourself, particularly in moments of disappointment, are not merely venting, but what you hear about yourself and internalize. What you're telling yourself about your actions. Your self worth. Your abilities. Is what you’re telling yourself really what you want to hear? And is it squared with reality? It made me think of one of my favorite frameworks, aptly called The Work, by another coach with a great podcast, Byron Katie. She recommends you ask yourself four questions and answer honestly when confronting a challenging situation: • Is it true? • Can you absolutely know that it’s true? • How do you act when you believe that thought? • Who would you be without that thought? Both Katie and Castillo approach these questions from a place of introspection, but it reminded me that we can apply this style of thinking when we’re out selling. Dan Flood, who leads sales for me at Challenger, talks about the growing chasm between what buyers say and what buyers do, from the easily observable (a signature) to the harder to see (the buying committee ranks your solution ahead of other vendors). What a buyer says may not be what you hear. And what a buyer says is often not what a buyer does. The important thing is to always validate what someone says, whether that’s yourself or a buyer. Don’t let happy ears — or sad ears — get in the way of personal or professional growth. So the next time you’re meeting with a stakeholder and they tell you that they absolutely need your solution and they’re ready to sign, take a beat and go back to those questions. • Is your buyer telling you what’s going to happen or just what you want to hear? • Can you validate what they said? • What steps will you take to ensure you reach the outcome you want? Pressure test and validate. Poke those thoughts. And truly listen to the answers that come back.\n\nYou’ve heard that great power comes with great responsibility. As someone passionate about developing leaders and entrepreneurs, I couldn’t agree more. The power you’ve worked for your whole life doesn’t just change how you see yourself — but how other people see you. That’s why I loved this recent article in Harvard Business Review from Julie Diamond, Lisa Zigarmi, and Lesli Mones. Every leader grapples with responsibly managing power. The key to preventing any of these traps from diminishing your leadership is self-awareness, a mindset that allows you to “wield power so it works for you — not against you,” the three write. Of the five traps — Savior, Complacency, Avoidance, Friend, and Stress — I struggle the most with the Friend Trap, in which leaders rely too much on their ability to build and sustain relationships because they want to be liked. As I read the article, I found myself nodding. I’m a recovering Relationship Builder, in Challenger terms, which means my strengths include cultivating relationships, building networks, and going the extra mile for others, traits present in the Friend Trap. When I became a CEO, I discovered that it’s a very lonely job. You can’t be friends with everyone. You need to be the one who makes tough decisions or calls that not everyone likes, including the people in your network who helped get you where you are. It’s critical as a leader that you set boundaries. As a recovering Relationship Builder, I can also tell you that it’s very hard. Relationship Builders have a hard time saying no or doing anything that creates Constructive Tension, just like leaders who fall into the Friend Trap. Avoiding tension is also ineffective. When you don’t harness your authority, it creates unconstructive tension. It compromises a team’s ability to get things done or move clients forward. But fear not. Just like we tell people you may be a natural-born Relationship Builder, you can commit yourself to a better way forward. Look at effective leaders and sellers. What do they do differently? Emulate them. Leverage your strengths to connect with people, but build up your ability to hold them accountable — and make peace with occasionally making them unhappy. It’s not easy. But you’ve got to do it. Because embracing your power and wielding it responsibly is what leads to greatness.\n\nHere’s something I wish more successful people acknowledged: No matter how much you’ve accomplished, you’re never done learning. This is something we preach at Challenger — your job as a seller is to teach your customer something new, that they hadn’t thought of before. Help them uncover problems they didn’t anticipate and see that they need to change how they do business if they want to continue to succeed. But what works for complex sales can work for individuals too — and the most powerful way I’ve found to do this is through mentorship. This month, I’m kicking off my first executive coaching program with TALAS, led by my friend Derek Blidy. It’s not because I wanted to talk about how great I am or impart wisdom to others. (That’s bragging, not mentorship.) True mentorship is a reciprocal commitment to growth. It’s about what you learn and the relationships that develop. People often misinterpret mentorship as a seasoned leader inspiring a room full of younger people or, worse, a transactional relationship wherein a more experienced person opens up their contacts list when a less experienced person they know needs a job. It’s about help and support. It’s about having those people who will tell you no or help reframe your view to change the way you do something, especially when you need to — like my #PowerCoven. (You know who you are.) It’s learning from the next generation, like the students who went through my class at Kellogg Executive MBA Global Network, as they pursue their newest venture. They have a lot to offer, and I’m grateful that they keep in touch so I can learn from them! And that's why I’m excited to begin working with these professionals through Talas as they move toward what’s next in their journey, but more importantly, I’m excited about what they’ll teach me in return. Because bursting the status quo is how you create effective change — and it’s what Challengers do best.\n\nHappy Pride Month! It’s a time for us to celebrate the contributions and joy of our LGBTQIA+ colleagues and community. At Challenger, we like to lead with our values, and we believe in creating a culture that is open and safe for everyone. We’re debuting a special version of our logo and an updated LinkedIn banner, plus an email signature for our employees to use throughout the month. Symbols like these matter. But what matters more is going beyond artwork to listen, reflect, and take action. That’s why we’ll also be sharing stories from our Challenger community, reflecting on what Pride means to them, on our website throughout this month and at events in our offices, like our trip to the Chicago Cubs’ Pride Night on June 17. Society today is deeply polarized, and many members of the queer community feel less safe than they did a few years ago, as they face harassment, rhetoric, and increasingly, legislation that limits their rights and access to health care and support. Some companies engage in rainbow-washing or choose not to acknowledge Pride because they’re afraid of criticism, boycotts, and in some extreme cases, violence. I understand that fear, but giving into it doesn’t lead to anything positive. We don’t always get it right, but we’re willing to listen and learn. It’s important to embrace vulnerability as leaders, welcome authenticity, and focus on listening and building spaces where people feel comfortable and can bring their whole selves to work. That’s the culture we want to foster here, and one that allows our LGBTQIA+ colleagues to feel like they belong not just in June, but every day. Tell me how you honor Pride at your organization in the comments!\n\nThe days are long, but the years are short. This week, I thought about how fast those years truly went by as my youngest child graduated from high school. I’m so proud of her, the accomplishments she’s had, and the exciting future she begins now. Change is everywhere around her, as she completes this milestone and heads to Texas in the fall. But change is here for me too. For the first time in more than 20 years, my husband Jonathan Harris and I won’t have kids in the house with us. Our status quo is firmly disrupted. We’ll miss them both — our daughter as she begins her new adventure and our son, who will start his senior year at Michigan. But ... we’re maybe just a little excited about the time and flexibility we’re going to have with both our children out of the house. How do we make the most of this new world and honor the bittersweet elements of it? At Challenger, we reference John Kotter’s 8 Steps for Leading Change to support our clients in understanding what they need to do to ensure that their transformational efforts succeed. I’m not worried about failing empty nesting, per se, but I’m struck by how applicable many of his steps are to my life (although not all! We certainly don’t lack a sense of urgency): Form a strategic vision: what do we want with our additional time and flexibility? Enable action by removing barriers: what’s keeping us from fulfilling that vision? Generate short-term wins: we can celebrate how our family supported our daughter and son through these transitions and while trying out a few things we’ve thought about, like working from a new location for a month. Sustain acceleration: we want to ensure our kids know we’re there for them through the ups and downs they’ll face while out of the house — without losing sight of our own goals. I’m embracing this period of change. Sure it’s different, and it can be uncomfortable. But it’s also important. The days now feel short. I know the years are too. And I want to make the most of them. What are your tips for navigating empty nester life?\n\nHow hard is it for you to ask for what you need? For a lot of women — myself included — that feels like an impossible task. Pitchbook found that startups founded exclusively by women accounted for just 2% of all VC-backed startup capital last year. I can’t fix that systemic problem by myself, but I can help. It's part of what made me gravitate toward angel investing and helping women build stronger networks, along with my partner in crime Jessica G. Malkin. We recently gathered at the lovely home of my friend Kat Cole, who created a warm and intimate space for us to ask each other honestly: What do we need? And how can everyone in this group empower each other to ask for it? Every single woman in that space raised their hand. We believe we can close a gap for women with great ideas who lack capital. But even amongst ourselves, we realized the gaps women face can be more than financial. I recently took an assessment to understand the traits and patterns that can lead to self-sabotage, known as Saboteurs. My Saboteur? The Pleaser — I was the top of the list. I struggle to ask for what I need and to create boundaries. (Sound familiar?) I thought of this at Kat’s home, feeling the warmth and support of the women around me, and set an intention. I am going to ask for what I need. I’m not going to feel bad about it. And neither should you.\n\nEach year, at work, I celebrate Mother’s Day by sending a gift to the working moms of Challenger. It’s not easy to juggle work and home, to give your kids everything and then put 100% into your job too. There is so much that goes unseen. And it’s a little thing, but I do this because I want all of you moms to know: I see you. I see you showing up to an all-staff with a sick toddler on your lap. I see you logging back on after bedtime to put the finishing touches on a pitch deck. I see you scheduling your travel to get back in time to coach tee ball, attend Senior Night, or babysit your grandkids. I see you missing your kid, who just headed off to college. Or starting late on a Tuesday so you can have one last coffee with your daughter before she heads back home to her job and life in another city. And I see more than the struggle. I see your efficiency. Your flexibility. Your care and commitment. I see you setting boundaries and getting stuff done. I see your capacity for joy and your vulnerability. I see that you don’t just belong on our team — you make it better. And I see that the person you don’t always make time for is yourself. Each year, I pick a different theme. Last year, after all the upheaval of the pandemic, it was resilience. This year, it’s self-care. Because I see that you deserve a moment to relax and rejuvenate. And I see that Challenger — and all of our companies — are stronger because of you. Because you get it done, at work or at home. I am so grateful for all you do as a mom and a professional. Happy Mother’s Day!"
