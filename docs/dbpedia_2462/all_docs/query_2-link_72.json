        "text": "A generation of Taliban leadership was \"wiped out\" in Australia's longest war, Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared today, while acknowledging many Australian soldiers who served in that conflict are frustrated over what was now happening in Afghanistan.\n\nMr Morrison said the sacrifices of the 26,000 Australian soldiers who served in Afghanistan on Operation Slipper, from 2001-2014, were not in vain and will always be honoured.\n\n\"It was a mission that was about stopping a murderous ideology being exported around the world,\" Mr Morrison said, describing the US-led war on terror after the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\"For two decades that ideology has been contained, as have the mass casualty attacks of those times.\n\n\"A generation of Taliban leadership was wiped out because of that violence and time will tell if the lesson of that history has been learned.\"\n\nThe prime minister acknowledged many ADF veterans of the conflict might now be \"questioning\" their efforts, as the Taliban rapidly surged across the country since May, when the US, Australia and other allies announced a full withdrawal, and seized Kabul on the weekend.\n\nMr Morrison said he understood those frustrations.\n\n\"There is no more decent and good purpose than being willing to serve the country that you love,\" he said.\n\n\"It doesn't mean history's currents always run our way. I wish it did. But, sadly, it doesn't.\"\n\nIn more than a decade of operations - which included four Victoria Crosses for Australians - 41 soldiers died in Afghanistan, with many more wounded, some physically and others mentally.\n\nMr Morrison said the Australian government remained committed to helping Afghans who had assisted the ADF and other agencies to secure visas for a new life in Australia, but he admitted \"support won't reach all that it should\".\n\n\"On the ground events have overtaken many efforts. We wish it were different.\"\n\nOvernight chaotic scenes emerged from the international airport in Kabul.\n\nApache helicopters tried to move swarming crowds away from planes that were trying to take-off.\n\nIn desperation, some Afghans even clung on to the wheels of a US plane, only to fall and die as it climbed into the sky above the capital.\n\nAustralian troops have been deployed to help with the evacuation but are stranded in Dubai until they can enter Kabul after the recent unrest at the airport.\n\nSince April, more than 430 Afghans have arrived in Australia under the Locally Engaged Employee (LEE) visa scheme.\n\nMore than 1800 LEE visas had been awarded since 2013, Mr Morrison said.\n\nThere are fears that those still waiting for visas will be found and potentially killed by the Taliban.\n\nMr Morrison said the government was working hard on visa queues and the security clearance of those still waiting.\n\n\"Australia has exerted every effort to help the people of Afghanistan over these last 20 years.\"\n\nImmigration Minister Alex Hawke today confirmed no Afghan visa holder currently in Australia would be asked to return to Afghanistan \"while the security situation there remains dire\".\n\n\"Afghan citizens currently in Australia on temporary visas will be supported by the Australian government,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked by reporters exactly what that meant for Afghans in Australia, Mr Morrison said: \"We have no plans to be returning people back to those places.\"\n\n\"Where there is such terrible unrest ... they'll be able to remain here under those circumstances under the visas they're currently on.\""
