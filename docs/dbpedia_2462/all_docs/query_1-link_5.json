        "text": "Post by corsair67 on\n\nA couple more items from The Australian.\n\nNew top brass for military\n\nMark Dodd | March 20, 2008.\n\nKEVIN Rudd has ordered sweeping changes to the command of the Australian Defence Force, replacing the heads of the army, navy and air force and demanding the new team fix a growing recruitment and skills crisis.\n\nBut the current Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, will keep his job for another three years in a strong vote of support from the Prime Minister.\n\nIn a sign that the Government expects results from its new defence team, the replacements have been ordered to make progress reports on efforts to lift personnel recruitment every three months.\n\nIn the biggest shake-up of the defence force in decades, the chiefs of the three services were issued their retirement orders yesterday after distinguished careers during a period when defence was working at a peak operational tempo.\n\nLieutenant General Peter Leahy hands over command of the army to his deputy and former land commander, Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie, 55.\n\nGeneral Gillespie becomes the first army chief to have risen right through the ranks. He enlisted as an apprentice in 1968.\n\nAs a former member of the national counter-terrorism committee, established after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in the US, he has extensive administrative experience across state and federal bodies.\n\nNavy chief Russ Shalders and his air force counterpart Geoff Shepherd will be replaced by their respective deputies, Rear Admiral Russell Crane, 53, and Air Vice-Marshal Mark Binskin, 48. The three commanders are expected to retire from military life.\n\nIn other moves, Lieutenant General David Hurley, 53, the chief of joint operations, is elevated to vice-chief of the 71,000-strong (including reservists) defence force.\n\n\"This team has strong credentials and experience in leadership and management in a joint operational environment,\" Mr Rudd said in announcing the changes. \"They are well placed to assist the Australian Government to meet our security policy challenges into the future.\"\n\nMr Rudd announced the changes as he said Australia remained committed to Afghanistan for the long haul. But he called on NATO to produce an agreed strategy for success against the Taliban.\n\nWhen Mr Rudd becomes the first Australian prime minister to attend a NATO summit meeting - in Romania next month - the 26-member body will try to agree on a road map for military operations and civil reconstruction in Afghanistan. \"The reason I am going to Bucharest to attend the summit is very clear-cut: I want to be confident that NATO collectively and the European contributors to it have embarked on a long-term strategy to secure success in Afghanistan and against fixed benchmarks,\" Mr Rudd said yesterday.\n\nThe command shake-up comes at a time of heavy overseas engagement from the defence force. About 3900 defence personnel are expected to be overseas at any time this year on nine operations. About 12,000 members of the defence force will be involved in deployments over the next year.\n\nThe Rudd Government has vowed to pull Australia's combat troops out of Iraq this year. But the nation has about 1000 troops in Afghanistan and others throughout the Pacific region, including East Timor.\n\nAustralia is reluctant to commit more troops to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan when NATO countries are not increasing their effort. But with the 1650-strong Dutch deployment to Oruzgan province due to be phased down from 2010, Australia will come under pressure from the US and other allies to lift its military effort in the province.\n\nDefence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon immediately put the new chiefs on notice that the Government expected a timely turnaround in patchy defence recruitment numbers.\n\nThe Australian has learned that the Government has capped recruitment of civilians into the ADF as it seeks to cut expenses. Hiring of uniformed staff remains unaffected, but the ADF has been restricted to recruiting within the federal public service to fill its civilian vacancies.\n\nThe call from Mr Fitzgibbon to improve recruitment will be particularly felt in the recruit-starved navy, which depends on technically skilled personnel.\n\nThe Australian revealed this month that the navy was suffering a 37 per cent shortage of submariners, which was restricting the ability to put the Collins Class submarine to sea.\n\nThe Howard government last year announced an $11.5billion 10-year program to increase army personnel by 3000. The army's numbers have slipped from a peak of 33,072 in 1982-83 to about 26,000.\n\n\"The single biggest challenge facing the Australian Defence Force in the future is our people and skills shortage,\" Mr Fitzgibbon said. \"On that basis, I've asked the new leadership team to make this a particular focus.\n\n\"Every three months, or more (frequently) if required, the service chiefs will spell out ... progress they have made in meeting the exacting requirements of their services for skilled trades and professions.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Fitzgibbon warned of defence belt-tightening amid concerns the military budget was short $6billion over the next decade.\n\n\"It is a tough challenge in the face of almost full employment and a booming mining industry,\" he said.\n\n\"However, there is no choice but to succeed. The best available military equipment is of little use without sufficient high-quality personnel.\"\n\nMore pay was not the only answer to attracting staff, he said: \"The reality is that we can never hope to compete with other industries, in particular the mining industry, on the remuneration front alone. That's why we need to find new and innovative ways to encourage personnel to stay, rather than to leave.\"\n\nExtending free medical and dental services to all defence families was an example of an innovation that \"might just make the difference when defence families are trying to make this difficult decision\", he said.\n\nBrendan Nelson, a former defence minister, welcomed the reshuffle.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Houston, 60, said he was deeply honoured and humbled to be reappointed.\n\n- Additional reporting: Patrick Walters\n\nDecisions deliver experience mix\n\nCOMMENT: Patrick Walters | March 20, 2008.\n\nAS he always does, Angus Houston was out running yesterday morning long before sunrise.\n\nThe super-lean Houston, 60, is not just the fittest but by far the most experienced defence chief of his generation, having already served four years as air force chief and nearly three years as chief of the defence forces.\n\nHis reappointment yesterday as CDF came as no surprise to anyone on Russell Hill.\n\nThe only speculation was whether the Government would reappoint him for a full three-year term or opt for a shorter period.\n\nIf he serves six years as CDF, Houston's tenure will equal that of general Peter Gration, who served as CDF from 1987 to 1993.\n\nWith defence facing its most serious strategic challenges in decades, the Government has opted for the experienced Houston to steer the establishment. He starts his second term in July as defence faces a funding crunch, as well as a shortage of skilled personnel, just as it is gearing up for a series of major equipment acquisitions, including the $16billion Joint Strike Fighter.\n\nHe must oversee the creation of a defence white paper this year to form a blueprint for a defence force structure that can support concurrent operations in Afghanistan, East Timor and Iraq.\n\nGiven all of these challenges, retaining Houston as CDF was a sensible move. He has proved a highly popular leader with rank-and-file defence force members, taking a close interest in personnel issues.\n\nOf the three service chiefs, the man with the biggest job is new new Royal Australian Navy chief Russ Crane.\n\nCompared with the army and the RAAF, the RAN is in the doldrums, suffering severe shortages of skilled personnel, notably in the submarine arm. The Government is looking to Crane to reinvigorate the senior service.\n\nHouston's most likely successor as CDF remains Lieutenant General David Hurley, 53, who becomes Vice-Chief of the Defence Force. Hurley has performed well in recent posts including a stint as chief of capability development.\n\nLieutenant General Ken Gillespie, 55, succeeds Peter Leahy as army chief, bringing to the job operational experience in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan as well as strategic policy-making.\n\nFor Leahy, it marks the end of a distinguished army career, in which he served a record six-year term as chief of army.\n\nPerhaps the only surprise yesterday was the appointment of Mark Binskin, who turns 48 today, as air force chief. Binskin, a fighter pilot with extensive experience in joint operations covering Iraq and Afghanistan, vaulted ahead of more senior air vice-marshals John Blackburn, John Quaife and Greg Evans.\n\nIt will now be up to Binskin to sort out a host of complex issues surrounding Australia's future air combat capability, including the transition to the F/A-18 Super Hornet and the stalled introduction of the RAAF's vital early-warning aircraft."
