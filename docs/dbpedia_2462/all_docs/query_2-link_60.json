        "text": "With those who deployed on Operation Slipper – Australia’s longest military operation – preparing to march in Welcome Home parades across the country this Saturday, defence-linked industries are being called on to help recognise the families of more than 34,500 ADF, AFP and public servants who served in the areas of operation.\n\nAs part of an Op Slipper commemorative product range endorsed by Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, a special lapel pin has been created exclusively for the families of those who served.\n\nThe collection is raising funds for defence charities Soldier On, Legacy, Keeping Watch (Navy), Army Relief Trust and the RAAF Welfare Trust.\n\nThis simple pin and message card recognises the personal sacrifices families made to support those who served in the war.\n\nIndustry sponsorship of the pin will allow each family to receive at least one pin while still helping raise funds for the charities.\n\nIan Paterson from Military Shop, which is coordinating the collection with CDF’s office, says Sikorsky Helitech and the Australian Defence Credit Union jumped on board immediately and said he expected many more will join over coming weeks.\n\n“Most anyone associated with the military appreciates that our service men and women need the support of those at home. This simple pin lets us acknowledge the incredible sacrifices and courage it takes to have your loved ones serving in a war zone,“ he said."
