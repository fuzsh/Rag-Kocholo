Traer Scott traveled to Puerto Rico and Mexico to capture these remarkable and soulful photographs of dogs living alone or in packs on city streets. Since many street dogs were formerly pets, they are often friendly, approachable and eager to be adopted into new homes. As Scott documents in her introduction, she witnessed and assisted in the rescue of many of the dogs she photographed for this book; thanks to the collaborative efforts of Puerto Rican, Latin American and US organizations, these dogs have now been adopted into new homes both in the United States and Mexico. It features 90 irresistible, soulful portraits and outdoor photographs of street dogs. It is accompanied by a beautifully written, illustrated introduction by Traer Scott on her experience of photographing and rescuing street dogs. It includes a mini biography of many dogs featured, with details about their rescue and journey to a new home, and contact. (2007 Merrell Publishers)
