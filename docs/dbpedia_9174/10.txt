Krasava, a street dog, was left behind by her owners when war broke out in her hometown. Along with her mother, she was left alone to fend for herself on the streets. However, Krasava’s kind nature made it impossible for her to survive without the care of humans. Luckily, a local homeless lady took them in, but due to complaints from neighbors, she had to seek help from a volunteer organization.

Our organization promised to find Krasava and her mother, two street dogs, a loving and safe home. We are committed to providing the care and attention that they need to thrive. However, the journey to their new family in the United States is long, complicated, and expensive. We are appealing to you for help to make their dreams a reality.

At present, we have over 140 animals in our care, including many street dogs, and many are sick and require ongoing medical treatment. Our mission is to ensure that every animal under our care, including street dogs like Krasava, receives the necessary medical attention and care they deserve. With your help, we can continue to provide the necessary care to our animals and still make it possible for Krasava and other street dogs to reach their new homes.

Krasava’s journey represents hope for many other street dogs in the war-torn areas. Your donation today can help us achieve this goal and give a chance to other street dogs to live a life full of love and care. Please consider donating via our Facebook page, website, PayPal, Venmo, Wise, JustGiving, or GoFundMe. Every donation counts and will make a difference in the lives of these innocent street dogs.

Join us in giving Krasava and other street dogs a chance at a better life. Thank you for your support!
