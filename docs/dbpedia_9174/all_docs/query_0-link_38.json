If you want free dog service from your local county animal services, do a Google search for your local city or town animal control services, or local SPCA, or local humane society, or call your local sheriff's office.\n\nStray dogs, also known as free roaming dogs, are dogs that you see out on the street that are not contained. However, the term âfree roaming dogsâ can refer to village dogs, street dogs, wild dogs, stray dogs and feral dogs or canine dogs that freely roam villages and small communities, unfettered, without a real home or permanent residence. It has been estimated that worldwide over 200 million stray dogs roam the streets. The pariah, which is also considered a free roaming feral dog, has been found in many areas of the United States and is used to create a mix of stray breeds. While in a social sense they can be outcasts, there are times when you'll find them running with packs of other stray dogs. They are very common in Asia and Africa and are often kept by slum households as pets. They rely on garbage as their main source of food and you will often find that humans in the rural and urban parts of India contribute to their increasing population by feeding them. With over 500 tons of garbage in these areas that go uncollected every day, the stray dog population is very much supported.\n\nNeed stray dog removal in your hometown? If you want free dog service from your local county animal services, do a Google search for your local city or town animal control services, or local SPCA, or local humane society, or call your local sheriff's office.\n\nStray Dog Diseases\n\nStray dogs can carry internal and external diseases such as fleas, ticks, ear mites, Cheyletiella Dermatitis, Scarcoptic mange, Whipworm, Hookworm, Roundworm, Coccidia and Tapeworm. They are also high at risk for passing viral infections through feces which can be extremely fatal to other wildlife animals. Some of these infections include rabies, parainfluenza, Leptospirosis and distemper which can be lethal to humans as well.\n\nStray Dog Nuisances\n\nStray dogs often bite during the mating season as a way to fight off other dogs or even humans. Humans can get bit in the process and encounter various diseases or infections. Not to mention, they can ruin your yard, garden and garbage in search of food. A stray dog's barking and howling can be annoying for homeowners and the strays themselves can be very dangerous to your small pets and children. They will leave their urine as a way of marking their territory which can smell horrible and they are known to attack people if they feel threatened.\n\nAdditional Articles About Stray Dogs\n\nHow to protect yourself against dangerous stray dogs\n\nHow to catch a stray dog to bring it to the shelter\n\nWhat to do when your neighbor's dog won't stop barking\n\nWhat will the county animal services do with a stray dog?\n\nHow to Get Rid of Them\n\nThere have been many methods used for removal of stray dogs such as killing them and removing them from the home by setting traps. However, none of them are effective. When it comes to developing countries, their slum areas and exposed garbage supports the stray community. This means that removed strays are only replaced by more strays. Due to the fact that they have high breeding rates, it's almost impossible to control the increasing population and the spread of rabies. Within three years two dogs can turn into 300. Here's what you can expect when stray dogs are removed. Other strays from other areas consider this new territory and move in to occupy. The strays that occupy the new territory multiplies. Dog fights increase over territory and mating and then humans get bitten accidently. This causes humans to contract rabies and possibly die. In fact, between 1980 and 1990, there were at least 50-55 rabies related human deaths every year. Today, there are at least 35, 000 deaths a year due to rabies contracted from unvaccinated strays.\n\nRemove their Food Sources\n\nOne of the best things you can do to keep away stray dogs is to remove their food sources. If you have other pets, do not leave their food bowls outside or in areas where the stray dogs can get to the pet food. Make sure you have secured and sturdy fences around any chicken coups or other small animals that the stray dogs may be tempted to catch for food. Make sure your garbage cans are in a secured place or at least are sturdy with a lid that secures tightly so that the dogs cannot knock over the cans to get to the garbage.\n\nFences/Traps\n\nWhile you cannot solve the worldwide stray dog problem, you can certainly keep them off or remove them from your lawn or yard by using traps and fences. A humane trap can be obtained from your local veterinarian hospital or animal shelter for a fee. These traps are normally wire cages that consist of doors loaded with springs. The trap is placed in your yard where the stray spends the most time with food inside as the bait. When the stray enters the cage, the door closes and traps the stray inside. Then you can safely transport the stray to an animal shelter or rescue group. After removing the stray, you can then have a fence installed around the perimeter of your yard so that his buddies don't come back to take over the territory. Even though traps and fences can be effective in keeping strays out, the task is best left to a professional so that you can avoid the mishap of a trap not being securely closed and causes you to be bitten by the stray.\n\nHow to Get Rid of a Stray Dog By Catching It - Techniques\n\nStray dogs roam streets all over the world. They may be abandoned, lost, or have been born in the wild. It is very difficult, nearly impossible to tell a lost pet from a stray dog or a feral dog. If you want to capture a stray, there are definite rules about what you should or should not do.\n\nA Lost Pet or a Stray?\n\nYou may not be able to get too close to the dog at first, or at all. If you get close enough to see that it has a collar you are either dealing with a lost pet or a stray. You may have seen lost dog notices around your neighborhood or town; if the dog looks like the picture or description, try to catch him right away so he does not become lost forever. A stray dog will not usually have a collar and will possibly look malnourished and dirty. You may see it rooting through trash or eating any scraps it can find.\n\nCatching a Stray Dog\n\nThere are a few ways to catch a stray dog. If you do not have any experience you may want to call the local shelter or animal services. If you feel confident in your ability to catch the stray dog, then try to. First, find out its patterns by watching where it goes during the day and night. Set up a humane dog trap and try to lure it in there. Stray dogs will not respond to a person calling them and looking them straight in the eye. Luring a dog into a trap is a big challenge. Stray dogs are skittish and suspicious of anything new or different. They may not be willing to step into a new area even if their favorite food in the world is in there. Gain trust by tying the trap door so it will not snap down. Make the trap comfortable by putting a blanket or old towels in the bottom and put the bait in the back. Good bait for a dog can be any meat without bones. Hotdogs retain their shape if it rains so that is a good option. Have you ever seen a dog refuse to eat a hotdog? Do not put anything with bones in the trap. Chicken or turkey bones can choke the dog or cause problems internally. After a few days, untie the door and wait for the dog to feed. The trap door will come down and you can take it to a local shelter to be examined and possibly adopted.\n\nUrban Stray Dog Concerns and Rabies\n\nPhilip J. Nichols\n\nEarly summer was already hot in the city. Classical music lovers were getting ready for an evening concert at the Dell in the park. People were filing through the gate with their blankets and snacks, an hour ahead of starting time. The grounds had been manicured and the scent of freshly mown grass, honeysuckle and flower blooms wafted in the air on a gentle cool breeze coming from the adjoining lake.\n\nAn extra large specimen of feral dog heard the murmur of the people in the park. Even though the sun was down he still felt thirsty and hot. Something was wrong and without knowing why, he staggered his way toward the lake. He was a five year old pit bull mix, scarred from fights with rivals, sixty five pounds of muscle, tooth and claw. As he was drawn forward, his malfunctioning brain took hold and the monster emerged.\n\nThe concert goers reclining on blankets were, in the terms of the terrorist, âsoft targets.â Rabies is a viral terrorist. In the grip of the virus, he suddenly transformed into the âfuriousâ mode, attacking whatever moved in front of him. People panicked as he bit and clawed his way through the crowd. Even more people were injured falling and being trampled, trying to escape. An alert policeman ended it with his sidearm.\n\nA fiction yes, but it is only a matter of time. People in cities commonly dump unwanted dogs in hard times. These abandoned dogs eventually form packs, become feral and breed. Within a generation, none of the pack members are vaccinated, nor have they experienced living as human companions. They are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on garbage, road kill, handouts, abundant deer (mostly fawns,) and vegetable matter both wild and cultivated. They find shelter in abandoned buildings, parks, dry culverts, anywhere on the fringes, quiet and safe. If a hungry pack on the prowl sees a child running, the âchaseâ instinct kicks in. The outcome in such a case is not good.\n\nFeral cats are another consequence of human neglect. Although not as physically threatening as dogs, they can and do get rabies. In some areas there are people who tend for feral cats. These good hearted cat lovers not only feed them, but also capture them to have the cats neutered and vaccinated. The problem is they are then released where they were captured. These cats quickly adjust to being fed and form a âcolony.â This is not a solution to the problem of a domestic animal that causes property damage, preys on wild birds and animals, and is a general nuisance.\n\nRaccoons are another beneficiary of urban blight. In every decaying urban center, the abandoned homes and crumbling factories are simply voids that raccoons find attractive. Chop down all the den trees for a nice suburban development, no problem. Momma raccoon has adapted and is perfectly fine in the city, where safety along with an abundance of food awaits exploitation. There are no raccoon hunters to chase them with dogs, no trappers to harvest them for pelts and meat, in short, no population control except for mother nature. When raccoon numbers reach a tipping point (1) rabies and distemper rages through and wipes them out locally. This cycle repeats every four years or so. The rabies virus in raccoons is a variant of the rabies virus specific to raccoons.\n\nSo how does all this figure into the NWCOâs future? Given that urban centers are mostly run by âprogressiveâ politicians, leadership may be forced to deal with ferals, rabid raccoons, bad publicity, and the host of other things that are not good for creatures, human beings or politicians. A NWCO prepared with facts and a plan can be poised to provide problem resolution both short and long term, giving the mayors, committees and planners a âno brainerâ way out of a mess. It was bad policy that caused urban blight, but creates opportunity for problem solvers who can walk the walk.\n\nTaking on a long term contract of this kind requires a commitment that may be difficult for the sole proprietor of a NWCO business. It may work in small towns but larger population areas you will need employees to handle calls coming in at all hours, maybe multiple problems in places that are far from each other.\n\nOther contract considerations are the add on services that might be required, such as waste/carcass disposal and a Veterinarian willing to deal with ferals and wildlife (for a price.) A relationship, and coordination with local and state law enforcement, along with area dispatch (911) is absolutely essential. The initial contract term would best be made yearly to allow for unknowns that can be factored into subsequent contracts. Finally, any contract should be gone over by a lawyer who understands contract law, and is familiar with local political realities."
