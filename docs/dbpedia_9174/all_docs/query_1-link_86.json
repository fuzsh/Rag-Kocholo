        "text": "Variety of mammal\n\n\"Coatimundi\" redirects here. For the musician, see Coati Mundi (musician). For the North American species, see White-nosed coati. For other uses, see Coati Mundi (disambiguation).\n\nCoati White-nosed coati (Nasua narica) Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Family: Procyonidae Subfamily: Procyoninae Tribe: Procyonini Subtribe: Nasuina Genera\n\nNasua\n\nNasuella\n\nRange map\n\nCoatis (from Tupí),[1] also known as coatimundis ( ),[2][3] are members of the family Procyonidae in the genera Nasua and Nasuella (comprising the subtribe Nasuina). They are diurnal mammals native to South America, Central America, Mexico, and the Southwestern United States. The name \"coatimundi\" comes from the Tupian languages of Brazil, where it means \"lone coati\".[4][5] Locally in Belize, the coati is known as \"quash\".[6]\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\n[edit]\n\nAdult coatis measure 33 to 69 cm (13 to 27 in) from head to the base of the tail, which can be as long as their bodies. Coatis are about 30 cm (12 in) tall at the shoulder and weigh between 2 and 8 kg (4.4 and 17.6 lb), about the size of a large house cat. Males can become almost twice as large as females and have large, sharp canine teeth. The measurements above relate to the white-nosed and South America coatis. The two species of mountain coati are smaller.[7]\n\nAll coatis share a slender head with an elongated, flexible, slightly upturned nose, small ears, dark feet, and a long non-prehensile tail used for balance and signaling.\n\nRing-tailed coatis have either a light brown or black coat, with a lighter underpart and a white-ringed tail in most cases. Coatis have a long brown tail with rings on it which are anywhere from starkly defined like a raccoon's to very faint. As in raccoons but not ring-tailed cats and cacomistles, the rings go completely around the tail. Coatis often hold the tail erect; it is used as such to keep troops of coatis together in tall vegetation. The tip of the tail can be moved slightly on its own, as is the case with cats, but it is not prehensile as is that of the kinkajou, another procyonid.\n\nCoatis have bear- and raccoon-like paws and walk plantigrade like raccoons and bears (on the soles of the feet, as do humans). Coatis have nonretractable claws. Coatis also are able to rotate their ankles beyond 180°, in common with raccoons and other procyonids (and others in the order Carnivora and rare cases among other mammals); they are therefore able to descend trees head first. (Other animals living in forests have acquired some or all of these properties through convergent evolution, including members of the mongoose, civet, weasel, cat, and bear families.)\n\nThe coati snout is long and somewhat pig-like – part of the reason for its nickname, the \"hog-nosed raccoon\". It is also extremely flexible and can rotate up to 60° in any direction. They use their noses to push objects and rub parts of their body. The facial markings include white markings around the eyes and on the ears and snout.\n\nCoatis have strong limbs to climb and dig and have a reputation for intelligence, like their fellow procyonid, the raccoon. Unlike the nocturnal raccoons, however, most coatis are diurnal, although some may exhibit cathemeral behavior.[8] They prefer to sleep or rest in elevated places and niches, like the rainforest canopy, in crudely built sleeping nests.\n\nHabitat and range\n\n[edit]\n\nOverall, coatis are widespread, occupying habitats ranging from hot and arid areas to humid Amazonian rainforests or even cold Andean mountain slopes, including grasslands and bushy areas. Their geographical range extends from the southwestern U.S. (southern Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) through northern Uruguay.[9] Around 10 coatis are thought to have formed a breeding population in Cumbria, UK.[10]\n\nTaxonomy\n\n[edit]\n\nCoatis\n\nNasua narica\n\nNasuella meridensis\n\nNasuella olivacea\n\nNasua nasua\n\nThe following species are recognised:[7][11][12]\n\nGenus Nasua\n\nNasua narica (Linnaeus, 1766) – white-nosed coati (Southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, and Colombia)\n\nNasua nasua (Linnaeus, 1766) – South American coati (South America)\n\nGenus Nasuella\n\nNasuella meridensis (Thomas, 1901) – eastern mountain coati (Venezuela)\n\nNasuella olivacea (Gray, 1865) – western mountain coati (Colombia and Ecuador)\n\nThe Cozumel Island coati was formerly recognised as a species, but the vast majority of recent authorities treat it as a subspecies, N. narica nelsoni, of the white-nosed coati.[2][11][13][14][15]\n\nGenetic evidence (cytochrome b sequences) has suggested that the genus Nasuella should be merged into Nasua, as the latter is otherwise paraphyletic.[7] Other genetic studies have shown that the closest relatives of the coatis are the olingos (genus Bassaricyon);[16][17][18] the two lineages are thought to have diverged about 10.2 million years ago.[18]\n\nLifespan\n\n[edit]\n\nCoatis can live up to seven years in the wild. In captivity, their average lifespan is about 14 years, and some coatis can live into their late teens.[19]\n\nFeeding habits\n\n[edit]\n\nCoatis are omnivores; their diet consists mainly of ground litter, invertebrates, such as tarantula, and fruit (Alves-Costa et al., 2004, 2007; Hirsch 2007). They also eat small vertebrate prey, such as lizards, rodents, small birds, birds' eggs, and crocodile eggs. The snout, with an acute sense of smell, assists the paws in a hog-like manner to unearth invertebrates.\n\nBehaviour\n\n[edit]\n\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the mountain coatis,[7] and the following is almost entirely about the coatis of the genus Nasua. Unlike most members of the raccoon family (Procyonidae), coatis are primarily diurnal. Nasua coati females and young males up to two years of age are gregarious and travel through their territories in noisy, loosely organised bands made up of four to 25 individuals, foraging with their offspring on the ground or in the forest canopy. Males over two years become solitary due to behavioural disposition and collective aggression from the females and will join the female groups only during the breeding season.\n\nWhen provoked, or for defence, coatis can be fierce fighters; their strong jaws, sharp canine teeth, and fast scratching paws, along with a tough hide sturdily attached to the underlying muscles, make it very difficult for potential predators (e.g., dogs or jaguars) to seize the smaller mammal.\n\nCoatis communicate their intentions or moods with chirping, snorting, or grunting sounds. Different chirping sounds are used to express joy during social grooming, appeasement after fights, or to convey irritation or anger. Snorting while digging, along with an erect tail, states territorial or food claims during foraging. Coatis additionally use special postures or moves to convey simple messages; for example, hiding the nose between the front paws as a sign for submission; lowering the head, baring teeth, and jumping at an enemy signal an aggressive disposition. Individuals recognise other coatis by their looks, voices, and smells, the individual smell is intensified by special musk-glands on their necks and bellies.\n\nCoatis from Panama are known to rub their own fur and that of other troop members with resin from Trattinnickia aspera (Burseraceae) trees, but its purpose is unclear. Some proposed possibilities are it serves as an insect repellent, a fungicide, or as a form of scent-marking.[20]\n\nReproduction\n\n[edit]\n\nCoati breeding season mainly corresponds with the start of the rainy season to coincide with maximum availability of food, especially fruits: between January and March in some areas, and between October and February in others. Female and young coatis commonly live in bands of 5 to 40 and travel together. The males are solitary and join the bands only during the short mating season.\n\nFor this period, an adult male is accepted into the band of females and juveniles near the beginning of the breeding season, leading to a polygynous mating system.\n\nThe pregnant females separate from the group, build a nest on a tree or in a rocky niche and, after a gestation period of about 11 weeks, give birth to litters of three to seven kits. About six weeks after birth, the females and their young will rejoin the band. Females become sexually mature at two years of age, while males will acquire sexual maturity at three years of age.\n\nNatural predators\n\n[edit]\n\nCoati predators include jaguarundis, anacondas, pumas,[21] maned wolves, boa constrictors, foxes, dogs, tayras, ocelots, and jaguars. Large raptors, such as ornate hawk-eagles, black-and-chestnut eagles, and harpy eagles, also are known to hunt them.[22] White-headed capuchin monkeys hunt their pups.[23]\n\nStatus\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Central and South America, coatis are threatened by environmental destruction and unregulated hunting. A lack of scientifically sound population studies could be leading to an underestimation of the coati population and other ecological problems affecting the species.[citation needed]\n\nIn captivity\n\n[edit]\n\nCoatis are one of five groups of procyonids commonly kept as pets in various parts of North, Central and South America, the others being the raccoons (common and crab-eating), the kinkajou, the ring-tailed cat and cacomistle. However, while both the white-nosed and South America coatis are common in captivity, mountain coatis are extremely rare in captivity.[24][25]\n\nCoatis are small creatures that can be wild, somewhat difficult to control or train in some cases, and generally behave in a manner radically different from that of a pet dog.[26] Optimally, they should have a spacious outdoor enclosure and a coati-proofed room in the house and/or other climate-controlled place, as well. They can be given the run of the house but need careful watching, more careful in some cases than others.\n\nIt is possible to litter or toilet train coatis;[27] if one cannot be trained as such, it is still possible to lessen problems in that they tend to designate a latrine area, which can have a litter pan placed in it as is done with many ferrets, pet skunks, rabbits, and rodents.[27] Coatis generally need both dog and cat vaccines for distemper and many other diseases and an inactivated rabies vaccine. They can be spayed or neutered for the same reason as cats and dogs and other pets.\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nWhite-nosed coati at Tikal, Guatemala\n\nSouth American coati, Nasua nasua, in an English zoo\n\nWhite-nosed coati in Rincón de la Vieja National Park, Costa Rica\n\nSouth American coati near Iguaçu Falls, Brazil\n\nWhite-nosed coati on Mt.
