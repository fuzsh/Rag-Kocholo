        "text": "US Dog Coalition & Rescue rescues, feeds, and assists in the spaying and neutering of street dogs living in the Copper Canyon region of Mexico. They are actively working on building the first-ever shelter in Creel, Chihuahua Mexico, a region where the closest veterinarian is more than 2 hours away.\n\nThe communities in which US Dog Coalition & Rescue operates are incredibly poor and filled with people who do not have the means to assist the animals in need. The thousands of street dogs in the region depend on the team at US Dog Coalition & Rescue to survive. Without they would have no access to essential resources such as food or basic medical care.\n\nUS Dog Coalition & Rescue want to utilize the shelter they are constructing to not only serve to save the lives of many more street dogs but to educate the public and perform community outreach. Currently, much of the community sees stray dogs as nuisances, US Dog Coalition is hopeful that with education, they can change the way much of the community views these stray animals.\n\nSPCA International is proud to support US Dog Coalition & Rescue in their efforts to improve the lives of stray animals in Mexico."
