        "text": "State Symbols\n\nOrigins of the Seal of the State of Rhode Island\n\nThere is no official documentation from the time when Rhode Island first adopted the word \"Hope\" on its Seal and flag that explains why this word was chosen. The Rhode Island General Assembly first adopted a Seal for the colony containing an anchor with the word \"Hope\" above it on May 4, 1664. The most coherent explanation as to the use of \"Hope\" comes from the historical notes of Howard M. Chapin published in Illustrations Of The Seals, Arms And Flags Of Rhode Island, printed by the Rhode Island Historical Society in 1930. On pages 4 and 5, Mr. Chapin wrote that the words and emblems on the Seal were probably inspired by the biblical phrase \"hope we have as an anchor of the soul\", contained in Hebrews, Chapter 6, verses 18 and 19.\n\nState Symbol of American Folk Art: Charles I.D. Looff Carousel\n\nAdopted on May 28, 1985.\n\nThe Charles I.D. Looff Carousel (also known as the Crescent Park Carousel) is the state symbol of American folk art. The Crescent Park Carousel is all that remains of a large Victorian-era amusement park, which gave way to suburban development in the 1970s. Today, the carousel is a park by itself, as it still attracts visitors throughout a good part of the year. The Looff Carousel at Crescent Park in East Providence, Rhode Island, is one of the few handmade carousels still in use. It was designed and built in 1895 by Charles I.D. Looff, a native of Denmark, who was one of the earliest and most important manufacturers of carousels. Still functioning on its original site more than 100 years later, the Looff Carousel is one of the surviving examples of a once common American folk art. Because of its cultural significance, the Crescent Park Carousel, nationally recognized as a true masterpiece of wood sculpture, was rescued in the 1970's by a handful of East Providence residents. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Sites and Places in April 21, 1976. In 1985 the Rhode Island General Assembly proclaimed the carousel as the \"State Jewel of American Folk Art\". In 1987, the Department of the Interior's National Park Service designated the carousel as a National Historic Landmark. A $1 million restoration effort was completed in 1995.\n\nThe carousel features 56 hand carved wood jumping horses, 6 stationary horses, 4 chariots, a camel, a Wurlitzer military band organ, decorative panels, beveled mirrors, faceted glass jewels, electric lights, and colored sandwich glass windows.\n\nPicture and description courtesy of:\n\nLooff Carousel at Crescent Park\n\nBullock's Point Ave.\n\nEast Providence, Rhode Island\n\nUnited States\n\nPhone: 401/435-7518 or 401/433-2828.\n\nArms of the State\n\nAdopted in 1882\n\nThe arms of the state are a golden anchor on a blue field, and the motto thereof is the word \"Hope\".\n\nState Bird: Rhode Island Red\n\nIn 1954, a state bird election was sponsored by the Audubon Society of Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Federation of Garden Clubs, and the Providence Journal Company. The Rhode Island Red beat out its closest competitors, the osprey and ruby-throated hummingbird, and became Rhode Island's official state bird at noon on May 3, 1954. \"The Rhode Island Red,\" Governor Dennis J. Roberts said, upon signing the bill into law, \"has become a symbol of Rhode Islanders all over the world.\"\n\nAdopted on May 3, 1954\n\nState Drink: Coffee Milk\n\nAdopted on July 29, 1993\n\nCoffee Milk is similar to chocolate milk but is made with coffee syrup. A coffee “cabinet” is coffee milk with ice cream (a coffee flavored milk shake). The main ingredient of this shake is \"coffee milk,\" first introduced to Rhode Islanders in the early 1920's. Coffee milk became so popular in Rhode Island that in 1993 the Rhode Island state legislature voted coffee milk as the official state drink. It's called a “cabinet” because its originator kept his blender in a “kitchen cabinet.” Autocrat Coffee Syrup is the preferred syrup in Rhode Island. Autocrat of Rhode Island is a leading provider of premium coffee, syrup, and coffee extract since 1895.\n\nState Fish: Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis)\n\nAdopted on July 13, 2000\n\nThe fish commonly known as the \"Striped Bass\" (morone saxatilis) is designated as the official state fish.\n\nState Flag\n\nAdopted in 1877\n\nThe flag of the state shall be white, five feet and six inches fly and four feet and ten inches deep on the pike, bearing on each side in the center a gold anchor, twenty-two inches high, and underneath it a blue ribbon twenty-four inches long and five inches wide, or in these proportions, with the motto \"Hope\" in golden letters thereon, the whole surrounded by thirteen golden stars in a circle. The flag shall be edged with yellow fringe. The pike shall be surmounted by a spearhead and the length of the pike shall be nine feet, not including the spearhead.\n\nState Flower: Violet (viola sororia)\n\nAdopted on March 11, 1968\n\nThe violet was voted as the state flower by school children and announced on Arbor Day in 1897. But it wasn't until March 11, 1968 that the flower was officially adopted as the state flower. Rhode Island was the last state to adopt an official state flower.\n\nState Tree: Red Maple (acer rubrum)\n\nAdopted on March 6, 1964\n\nThe Red Maple was voted as the state tree by school children in the 1890's. But it wasn't officially adopted as the state tree until 1964. In the fall, the leaves turn gold, purple, and scarlet, adding to the beauty of Rhode Island’s forests.\n\nState Fruit: Rhode Island Greening Apple\n\nAdopted on June 20, 1991\n\nDeveloped in Rhode Island around 1796, greening apples retain their sharp taste in cooking. Their flesh is crisp and colored yellow-green.\n\nState Mineral: Bowenite\n\nAdopted on May 26, 1966\n\nThe state mineral, Bowenite, is a close relative of jade and can be considered a semi-precious gem stone. It is found in northern Rhode Island and was first discovered in the early 1800's by geologist George Bowen.\n\nState Rock: Cumberlandite\n\nAdopted on May 26, 1966\n\nThe State Rock is Cumberlandite. It is a heavy black or dark brown rock with white markings. It is found South of the Town of Cumberland on both sides of Narragansett Bay. It will attract a magnet, and is estimated to be between 1 and 1.5 billion years old.\n\nState Shell: Quahaug (mercenaria mercenaria)\n\nAdopted on June 30, 1987\n\nThe word quahog comes from the Narragansett Indian name: poquauhock. The quahog's scientific name, Mercenaria mercenaria, is derived from a Latin word meaning \"wages.\" The Native Americans used quahog shells to make beads that they used as money (wampum).\n\nState License Plate: Official License Plate Nickname is “Ocean State\"\n\nAdopted July 8, 1971\n\nThe state of Rhode Island first started licensing vehicles in 1904. The first license plates were issued in 1904, were made of porcelain and featured black and white numbers with “Registered in RI.” The current standard issue plates feature the light blue wave on white background with dark blue numbers with the official plate nickname “Ocean State.”\n\nState Quarter Design\n\nReleased May 21, 2001\n\nSelection of the design began when Governor Lincoln Almond issued an order authorizing the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts to organize a Coin Concept Advisory Panel. More than 500 design concepts were submitted to the panel, and three finalists were chosen. Rhode Island residents were invited to vote for their favorite design at area libraries, the Statehouse and via the Internet. The sailboat design was declared the winner, earning 57 percent of the 34,566 votes cast.\n\nThe release of the Rhode Island quarter completes the release of all of the commemorative quarters for the 13 Original Colonies and states.\n\nState Yacht: Courageous, US-12/26\n\nAdopted on July 13, 2000\n\nThe Courageous, one of the world's most distinguished yachts, raced in more America's Cup campaigns than any other yacht in history.
