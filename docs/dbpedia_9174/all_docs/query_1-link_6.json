The data were sampled, weighted, and screened to eliminate potential sources of bias and provide accurate estimates and insights. A total of 2,011 respondents completed the online survey and were included in the final analysis reported here; the margin of error is 2.2% within a 95% confidence level. Both demographic and behavioral characteristics of respondents were compared to the general population for weighting and estimations. Logistic regression and difference in means test were performed to see which characteristics influence whether a household adopted a pet, how likely they were to see a veterinarian, and how likely they were to delay seeing the veterinarian."
