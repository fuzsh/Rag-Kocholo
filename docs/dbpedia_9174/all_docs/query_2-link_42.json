        "text": "Beginnings\n\nSoi Dog Foundation (Soi Dog) was established in 2003 in Phuket, Thailand, to help the street dogs and cats who had no-one else to care for them. Over 70,000 strays roamed the island, with the numbers growing alarmingly due to a lack of spay and neuter programmes to control the population. Soi Dog was created to provide a humane and sustainable solution to managing the stray population and to address their medical needs. Funding then, as it does now, came entirely from individuals who shared, and continue to share, the vision of our founders.\n\nOur Work\n\nSoi Dog Foundation is fighting the Asian dog and cat meat trade and thanks to overwhelming support from people like you, the trade has been almost completely wiped out in Thailand. We continue to campaign for an end to the trade in other Southeast Asian countries where it is prevalent.\n\nMission Statement\n\n'To improve the welfare of dogs and cats in Asia, resulting in better lives for both the animal and human communities, to create a society without homeless animals, and to ultimately end animal cruelty'.\n\nTo find out more about Soi Dog’s mission and our work, you can view our “Little Orange Book” by clicking here.\n\nNonprofit Registration\n\nSoi Dog Foundation is a not-for-profit, legally registered charitable organisation in: Thailand: Phor.Gor. 39/2548; USA: 27-1600444; Australia: 58982568831; Holland: 37120202; France: W332011412; United Kingdom: 1176305; Canada: 981179-6; Switzerland: CHE-393.768.679\n\nSoi Dog Foundation has a Platinum Seal of Transparency from GuideStar, the world's largest source of nonprofit information, and a maximum 4-star rating with Charity Navigator."
