Of those, an estimated five million to seven million and animals wind up in one of the nation’s 3,500 shelters.\n\nSome shelters have resulted to waving adoption fees due to the increase of stray animals.\n\nLogan Hoskinson, Assistant Manager for the Central Pennsylvania Humane Society said, the increase in stray animals comes from an increase of at home breeding, people no longer wanting the responsibility of caring for an animal and not wanting to deal with the problems or veterinary expenses that taking care of a life may bring.\n\n“I’ve been working at this shelter for eight years just about and I’ve never seen it so full in the dog areas. Cats are a constant problem,” Hoskinson said. “Fills up every year, at least for a time, if not throughout the whole year. But the dogs, I’d say, have definitely seen an uptick that I’ve never experienced working at the shelter.”\n\nHe also said because of the increase in stray animals, shelters are overwelmed, animals are packed closely together, and aren’t able to get the best treatment because of the conditions.\n\nStray animals are usually exposed to all kinds of illnesses and can become emotional or physically traumatized.\n\nHoskinson said in order to resolve this issue lawmakers could place more restrictions on how people are allowed to breed animals and, with more funding, shelters can hire more staff and get bigger facilities to care for animals, which would avoid any cross-contamination or a spread of illness.\n\nHe also encouraged people to adopt an animal in need of a home and support their local shelter to make a difference.\n\n“We at the shelter always have to say, we can’t recommend you pick up the animal and take it in your cell but that’s just in a liability sense. Personally, I always stop and help whatever animal I can. Maybe it just comes with the job,” Hoskinson said. “But shelters are always going to want to help, even when they’re overwhelmed… And it doesn’t hurt to just try. Even if the shelters can’t take them, we always want to help.”"
