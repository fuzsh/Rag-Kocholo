        "text": "3.2. Aspects Regarding the Ethology of Stray Dogs in the Analysed Area\n\nBy analysing the modes of the spread of stray dogs based on multiple observations, which took place within approximately the same timeframe, certain areas frequented by the stray dogs were identified. These areas are shown in and . Through both the all-terrain vehicles and the outline of the patrolling areas, the movement routes of the stray dogs were identified. Two large categories of stray dogs could be observed, which followed these trails.\n\nThe first category is composed of specimens that moved from towns to agricultural areas and to the forest. This first category includes both urban stray dogs with owners disinterested in the fate of the dogs but also semi-feral stray dogs that live on the outskirts of towns and have no owners. Stray/semi-feral dogs from the inner city and in rural areas occupy abandoned houses left in disrepair for various reasons.\n\nThe second category includes completely feral roaming dogs that live only in the countryside.\n\nDepending on the topography of the terrain, the dogs in the first category almost strictly kept to certain routes, most often where the terrain benefits them, where the trails follow streams, creeks or ravines of various categories, or areas with shelter belts, fences or tree lines, similar to wild canids (foxes, jackals). Such routes were observed in the “slag pit” area near the Suceava Municipality, along the left bank of the Suceava River, leading to the agricultural lands belonging to the towns of Salcea, Plopeni and Prelipca. Other routes were observed from Salcea to the Fetești forest, from the Burdujeni neighbourhood to the Adâncata forest, from the Ițcani neighbourhood to the Rusciori forest, from Mitocași to the Romanoia forest and from Hânțești–Adâncata to the Siretului river and to the Pleșa forest ( ). These main routes are supplemented by shorter routes, which are less frequented but compose the network of travel paths in the analysed territory.\n\nThe nuclei of the completely feral stray dogs was in the Dumbrava–Rusciori forest, situated on the ruins of a former ammunition depot, an area later taken over by the former AVICOLA Suceava. In this area, the dogs use all the bumps and the former cellars of the warehouse, as well as the technical channels of the former water, sewage and fire installations, etc. The dogs in this area have a clear wild behaviour; they cannot tolerate proximity to people, and if they are in a pack, they may even attack people who are passing by.\n\nAnother important nucleus occupied by the former CET Suceava (Electro-Thermal Power Plant) comprised the tunnels positioned along the railway in the Văratec–Salcea area. Two other areas that harbour feral stray dogs are in the Plopeni area, along the Mereni stream. This stream is ravined with very steep banks (slopes of over 45%), on which a very dense shrubby and sub-shrubby vegetation has developed, consisting of hawthorn, species of willow, rosehip, elder, willow, sea buckthorn, dovecot, etc. There are also exclusively wild stray dogs in the area of the sewage settling basins in the former pig breeding complex, the former ISCIP Verești ( ).\n\nIn other areas, especially in the central and southern parts of the analysed area, where the terrain is almost flat and there are no conditions for trails on which dogs can move unnoticed, tracks can be observed in the agricultural land or pastures.\n\nThese paths/trails were easily identified during the winter, when there was a layer of snow. Later, these travel paths were also checked in other seasons, after rainy periods, when the tracks were visible, and the age, as well as the number and size, of the specimens could be approximated. Additionally, during the winter, it was found that the movements of the stray dogs took place on the tracks of other animals and on the tracks of carts or vehicles, which was obviously due to the need to conserve energy. In the winter, the travel paths became almost flat due to the high frequency of travel.\n\nFeeding behaviour of stray dogs. Circadian movements are mainly carried out in the search for food. Stray dogs have opportunistic feeding behaviour. First of all, this behaviour focuses on all the points where UATs or citizens legally or illegally store various types of household waste. These warehouses are located at variable distances of 2–3 km from the town limits.\n\nIn the activity of searching for food in large territories, individuals or groups form skills for movement on certain routes that ensure minimum energy consumption and maximum protection.\n\nBoth semi-feral and feral dogs have access to these food sources. The main deposits are on the banks of the Suceava River, the CET area, the Verești ballast area, the Dumbrăveni slaughterhouse area, the Siminicea ballast yard, the Țigăncii ravine of Hănțești, the Odăi Adâncata clearing and the exit from Fetești ( ). In addition to these points, much debris can be found along the watercourses and in the forest, where citizens illegally deposit garbage bags and household waste.\n\nApart from this somewhat easy feeding pattern induced by the adaptability of the stray dogs, the hunting instinct is also manifested for feeding. It is clear that one cannot compare the nutritional quality of household scraps with the properties of meat. For this reason, feral dogs mainly hunt wild but also domestic animals ( , and ). Their menu includes wild animals, including small rodents such as water shrew (Neomys fodiens), vole (Microtus arvalis), ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus), hamster (Cricetus cricetus) and hares, as well as young and adult roebuck and young wild boar.\n\nIt was observed that the hunting of the wild specimens was carried out, as is typical of canids, by stalking and flanking the prey ( ). Most often, they preyed on juveniles and animals injured for various reasons, or those with certain ailments. For example, the area being humanized, many deer or juvenile wild boars become injured in wire fences or are hit by agricultural machinery or vehicles on the roads.\n\nThese specimens clearly became victims of wild dogs, since there is no other predator in the area. Additionally, hare predation is based on hares’ low endurance over long distances compared to the physical endurance of dogs. However, most of the time, the dogs abandon the chase. The same cannot be said of young animals, the predation having the greatest impact on young hares.\n\nThe meat of domestic animals mainly includes sheep, both those discarded by the owners as a result of death due to disease and isolated or stray animals, which are hunted in the wild or even left in unguarded pens ( ).\n\nTechnical staff were on site during a stray dog attack that resulted in over 30 sheep being killed or injured by a pack of 7 stray dogs. It was evidently the same mode of behaviour as that of the wolf, which instinctively kills more than it needs to consume. Unfortunately, the owner did not want to make a complaint, nor did he want to countersign the report prepared by the technical staff. Similar incidents also took place in Mitocași, with 5 dogs killing 13 sheep. In this case, the shepherd was firmly convinced that the attack was caused by jackals, being “white with black spots” (sic!). Damage was also caused to three juvenile bulls in the area of the slaughterhouse in the town of Dumbrăveni. Additionally, more examples could be mentioned.\n\nOver time, we were informed many times by various citizens, including sheep owners, that they have suffered significant damage, ranging from 1–2 sheep to over 30 sheep in one night. Unfortunately, these numbers have not been quantified in official reports or minutes at town halls or by the police department, because in most cases, citizens avoid filing or refuse to file a complaint.\n\nThe gregarious (social), reproductive and territorial behaviours of stray dogs are manifested through the social relations that take place at the level of the respective group. Similar to other gregarious canid species (jackals, wolves), semi-feral and feral dogs communicate in a complex way through visual, auditory or olfactory signals. As a rule, it has been observed that the hierarchy in the group/pack is dictated by size and age, respectively, and by the experience of the component specimens among whom subordinate relations are established.\n\nBasically, in the same group, short conflicts take place as a result of which the weakest dog recognises the dominance of the others but shows its authority over others who are weaker than it. This method of communication, which is typical of canids, takes the form of barking, growling, a certain positioning of the tail and ears or baring of the teeth. Ears laid back and the baring of canines indicate hostility. This sum of attitudes provide cues to other group members about aggression or submission. As a rule, direct conflicts are relatively rare between members of the same group and occur only when individuals are close in size.\n\nMore intense conflicts arise when an individual from outside the group appears, and in this case, the phenomenon of tolerance can appear, with the intruder adopting a defensive attitude from the beginning and approaching the other dogs very cautiously, presenting itself with its tail between its legs, with its head down in an obvious attitude of submission. In other cases, upon a signal given by a member of the pack, the whole group rushes upon the newcomer and puts it to flight. In such situations, harsh conflicts can take place, from which the intruder can incur serious injuries. Another type of attitude has also been observed, when the roaming specimen is a female and in oestrus. Thus, the female can arouse the interest of the males, and the behaviours change. The manifestations of friendship are obvious; the dogs wag their tails left and right, do not reveal their teeth, and have a visibly playful behaviour.\n\nSexual behaviour is primarily related to the manifestations of partners during the reproduction (mating) period, though not exclusively, as mating has been observed to be triggered by the time when females enter oestrus. Most “wedding processions” and the most common behaviours are observed from the end of February to March but also in autumn. However, mating in stray dogs can occur year-round due to the domestication of the species.\n\nDue to the fact that they have access to food and shelter year-round, the breeding period is no longer restrictive, limited to a certain interval in a certain season. Practically, there is no longer a distinct mating period as there is in wild species. The timing of the onset of oestrus in females is dictated by the cessation of lactation of the last generation. If, for one reason or another, all the cubs die, the female can mate again. This phenomenon can also be observed in cats and in some species bred in captivity, amongst which the mating period has undergone changes compared to wild species.\n\nIn the case of stray dogs, territorialism is very obvious, intruders being repelled up to a certain distance, usually 150–300 m, more often in open spaces and less often in the forest. The phenomenon of territorialism also manifests as directed towards people, and in this case, feral and semi-feral dogs become very aggressive, and most of the time, the pack waits for a leader’s signal in order to initiate an attack.\n\nDuring the course of the observations, violent tendencies were observed very rarely within the larger or smaller groups. However, the unity of the packs was noted, whether it was expressed against some foreign stray dogs or against citizens on foot, on bicycles or in cars.\n\nStray dogs have predominantly diurnal behaviour, with a maximum intensity of activities in the morning and evening. However, nocturnal movements were also identified, albeit to a lesser extent. During the day, dogs retreat to more sheltered areas, under the protection of vegetation and under the banks of ravines or streams. In winter, they seek shelter “under the wind” on portions of land without snow, but on sunny days, they resume their activities at noon. In summer, they seek shady areas around forest edges, isolated trees or tall vegetation ( ).\n\nIn the periods preceding or following feeding, stray dogs tend to their fur through specific behavioural manifestations of hygiene, including licking or rolling in the snow, and in general, the behaviour of feral dogs is common to all canids, with certain peculiarities exposed previously.\n\n3.3. Food for Stray Dogs\n\nThe analysis of the stomach contents was performed rigorously and had a qualitative character. According to the nature of the identified ingestions, the number of dogs was determined for each category of food ( , and ).\n\nTable 4\n\nFood Type0cc,dc,pc,p,vc,sc,vdd,pd,p,vd,sd,s,vd,vpp,vss,vvTotalTotal3711321111314131111140816183\n\nFor an easier demonstration of the types of food, it can be noted that 103 dogs (56.3%) ingested meat, either from wild animals or from domestic animals ( , ). One can note the relatively high number of specimens, with 37 dogs (20%) having empty stomachs, which proves that they were seeking food.\n\nAdditionally, in total, it was observed that 71 dogs consumed only food of animal origin, and 40 of them only consumed game meat.\n\nOn the other hand, wild animal meat was identified in 53 dogs, respectively, amounting to 29%, and domestic animal meat was found in 54 specimens, respectively, amounting to 30% of all the captured dogs.\n\nOnly 25.7% of the specimens (47 specimens) showed other different combinations of stomach contents: meat, household materials, vegetables and plastics. It should be noted that the foods of animal origin also appeared in other specimens, in the combinations mentioned above. In this sense, specimens in which several types of ingested foods were identified had animal food/meat in their stomach contents. The number of stray dogs in which the same types of ingested components were found in different combinations is presented in based on the total surface area.\n\nFood of domestic origin was found in 18% of the specimens. It is interesting to note that a high percentage of 25% of wild dogs feed on plant-based foods.\n\nA small percentage presented traces or elements of plastic, ingested along with food scraps from households and food thrown into pits/landfills (about 5.46%).\n\nThe spatial distribution of the 183 stray dogs by the types of food identified was processed with the ArcGis computer platform as the kernel distribution ( ).\n\nNext, an analysis of the numerical distribution of the dogs by type of food and by season was carried out on the total analysed area. As we can see from and , domestic-type meat was present in the spring in 12 dogs, i.e., 24% of the total of those who ate in this season, and in the autumn, it was present in 9 dogs, i.e., 18.8% of the total of those who ate in that season.\n\nTable 5\n\nFood Type0cc,dc,pc,p,vc,sc,vdd,pd,p,vd,sd,s,vd,vpp,vss,vvGrand TotalW154----451-16--16-961Sp63-2-14121-112-113249S9------52-1---1-6-125A743-1-39-1--3-175448Grand total3711321111314131111140816183\n\nIn the case of domestic animals (in brown colour), a lower percentage was noted in winter and a higher one was noted in spring.\n\nNext, the calculation of the percentage of stray dogs was performed depending on the size of meat identified, either from a domestic animal or from a wild animal. A small size is considered to include specimens weighing less than 9 kg, a medium size is between 9 and 23 kg, and a large size is more than 23 kg [51].\n\nFrom , one can firstly observe a disproportion of the number of stray dogs captured in different seasons. Thus, most feral dogs were identified in winter (30%).\n\nTable 6\n\nFood0cc,dc,pc,p,vc,sc,vdd,pd,p,vd,sd,s,vd,vpp,vss,vvTotalW24.66.6--- - 6.68.21.6- 1.6- 9.8- -26.2- 14.8100.0Sp12.26.1-4.1-2.08.224.52.0- 2.02.04.1- -22.46.14.1100.0S36.0-- - - - - 20.08.0- 4.0- -4.0- 24.00.04.0100.0A14.68.36.3- 2.1- 6.318.8-2.1-- 6.3- 2.114.610.48.3100.0Total20.26.01.61.10.50.56.016.92.20.51.60.56.00.50.521.94.48.7100.0\n\nFrom a percentage point of view ( , ), it can be noted that game (in red colour) are part of the diet of stray dogs at a high percentage in winter, summer and spring.\n\nDue to the large number of medium-sized dogs, the percentage of dogs who consumed meat in this category is obviously the highest. However, if we compare meat-eating dogs of the same size, it can be observed that the large dogs have an indisputable preference for this type of food ( ).\n\nOverall, we can observe, as expected, the predilection of stray dogs for meat, regardless of its origin, a fact demonstrated by the share of this type of food, amounting to over 56%. Game meat was identified in 29% of the specimens and in 22% of the total dogs feeding only on game meat."
