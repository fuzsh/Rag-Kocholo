        "text": "Once female blue whales reach sexual maturity around 5 to 15 years old, they can give birth every two to three years. Blue whale pregnancies last about one year with calves typically born in December to February in low latitudes. Newborn blue whales are big babies! They can reach about 23 feet in length and can weigh 5,000 to 6,000 pounds at birth.\n\nA nursing blue whale mother produces over 50 gallons of milk a day. The milk is about 35 to 50 percent milk fat, which allows the calf to gain weight at a rate of up to 10 pounds an hour, which amounts to over 250 pounds a day!\n\nCalves stay with their mothers for about six to seven months. At 6 months old, calves have just about doubled in length, reaching on average over 52 feet long.\n\nThe life expectancy of blue whales is unknown, but it’s estimated to be between 80 to 90 years.\n\nThe favorite food of these gentle giants is krill, or small shrimp-like animals. Blue whales can eat up to 12,000 pounds of krill a day during the feeding season. They concentrate on feeding during the polar summers primarily around the Channel Islands, Monterey Bay and the Farallon Islands/Cordell Bank off of California. During the winter months, they migrate to warmer waters in Mexico and Central America."
