        "text": "by Molly Gabler-Smith\n\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like if dogs were able to roam the streets freely without restrictions or a designated owner? To many of us, this idea seems pretty absurd, but for many other countries, this is the norm.\n\nOne particular example of this is shown in the documentary Stray by producer Elizabeth Lo. In the film, she follows three stray dogs throughout the streets of Turkey, documenting their day-to-day lives. The more than 100,000 strays, or street dogs as they are sometimes referred to, have a very special relationship with the human residents of Istanbul. Turkey is the only country that allows dogs to roam the city streets freely because it is illegal to euthanize or hold captive any stray animal.\n\nThroughout the film, Lo documents these dogs politely waiting to cross at street lights, sun-bathing in the middle of the busy city streets, marching with protesters and sometimes having some fun chasing stray cats. I found the documentary particularly interesting because I never really considered what the life of a truly stray dog living in a highly developed city might entail. This is mostly because most cities I have visited do not allow dogs to freely roam the streets, as they are usually picked up by animal control and taken to a shelter or rescue.\n\nStray provides the dog’s-eye view of what city life is like. The three canine stars of the film, Zeytin, Nazar and Kartal, show the viewer an entirely different city experience. Zeytin (shown above) shows us his daily “routine” of making his rounds around the city, playing with other stray dogs and lingering patiently outside of restaurants for scraps of food. People in the city clearly see these dogs as fellow citizens who belong on the streets and in the communities. They appear to see these dogs as dignified individuals rather than a nuisance.\n\nIstanbul isn’t the only place where dogs are allowed to roam freely. Scientist Jeremy Koster (who presented at SICB’s 2021 virtual conference in the Symposium s11 “Biology’s best friend: Bridging disciplinary gaps to advance canine science”) is an anthropologist who studies dogs in the Mayangna community of Nicaragua. Unlike Istanbul’s street dogs, Mayangna dogs typically have owners, who give them names, provide food and water and allow them to sleep in their homes. Koster (2021) provides ample evidence to suggest that Mayangna dogs present a unique opportunity to study the evolution of dogs in environments that have similar characteristics in which dogs have evolved.\n\nMost pet dogs in the United States and Great Britain are what Koster coins NATIVE, that is they are neutered, alimented, trained, isolated, vaccinated and engineered. Consequently, these are usually the dogs that are used in most canine science studies. But the lives of NATIVE dogs are unusual, especially when considering the evolutionary history of canines. Recent molecular evidence suggests that dogs descended from the gray wolf, which was domesticated about 130,000 years ago. However, years of artificial selection have produced many different types or breeds of dogs that have many different purposes. In contrast to these modern domesticated canine breeds, the Mayangna, and arguably the dogs of Istanbul, provide populations that could be used for holistic perspectives on the evolution of domestic dogs.\n\nA Mayangna dog accompanying a man on a hunting trip.

In Istanbul, however, street dogs are currently being neutered by the government. Dogs in both communities lack access to commercial dog food. It is common for Mayangna owners to provide food from their household, such as bananas and rice to their dogs: dogs in Istanbul are also fed whatever scraps are leftover from restaurants and will sometimes be tossed bones with meat from trash collectors.\n\nKoster (2021) further suggests that it is likely that domestic dogs relied heavily on table scraps and scavenging, similar to these dog populations, for much of their time. Additionally, training in the sense of formal obedience school is very uncommon among Mayangna dogs and the dogs of Istanbul. However, both populations form bonds with human counterparts. In Stray, Zeytin was continually observed following around and often sleeping with a small group of men living on the streets. Though the bond observed is considerably different than that of a pet dog who has a designated owner with whom they are trained to listen to, it is clear the street dogs of Istanbul form companionships with some of the people of the community.\n\nBoth the film Stray and Koster’s review paper provide evidence of current populations of dogs that are substantially different from NATIVE dogs.\n\n“Koster suggests that it is important for canine scientists to consider studying and sampling diverse populations of dogs, as their varied environments may result in morphologically and behaviorally different phenotypes than those of NATIVE populations.”\n\nRegardless of whether or not you live with a NATIVE or nonNATIVE dog, it is clear from the Symposium’s title that dogs truly are “biology’s best friends”. Even my dog Silas was interested in learning about the lives of the dogs from Stray, as you can see below, he was very captivated by the film! I’ll end with a provocative quote that was presented in the film and I think really sums up the research from the Symposium,\n\n“Human beings live artificially and hypocritically and would do well to study the dog”,\n\nDiogenes of Sinope, 360 B.C.\n\nYou can rent or purchase Stray on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nAdditionally, you can read about the diversity of canine science happening all over the United States and beyond by accessing the Symposium’s publications here.\n\n&\n\nJeremy Koster’s\n\nMost Dogs Are Not NATIVE Dogs\n\naccess the full scientific paper (in advanced) “Most dogs are not NATIVE dogs” here.\n\nAbstract:\n\nStudies of dogs have proliferated among canine scientists, aided in part by the logistical convenience of working with owned animals whose care is handled by others. These pet dogs are unlike most dogs that have lived in contemporary or prehistoric settings. In particular, many of the dogs studied by canine scientists are NATIVE dogs: (1) neutered, (2) alimented, (3) trained, (4) isolated, (5) vaccinated, and (6) engineered. The distinct genotypes and unusual environments of NATIVE dogs stand in contrast to the characteristics of dogs who have adapted to lives in other human communities and settings. For a holistic perspective on the evolution of dogs, it is helpful to study dogs in environments that share features of the settings in which dogs evolved.\n\nLook for issue 1 in early August"
