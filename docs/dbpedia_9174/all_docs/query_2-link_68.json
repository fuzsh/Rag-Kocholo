Most of the information is based on estimates derived from two periodic surveys, and the various survey takers do not agree. Data reflecting shelter/rescue animal populations is spotty due to a lack of reporting requirements, which leaders in animal welfare are aiming to address with the Shelter Animals Count project.\n\nThere are two main sources of pet demographics in the United States: the biennial APPA National Pet Owners Survey by the American Pet Products Association, and the U.S. Pet Ownership & Demographics Sourcebook by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) which is published every five years. These surveys provide data about trends in pet ownership and produce estimates of the total number of dogs and cats.\n\nThe following is select data from the APPA and the AVMA. For additional information—including questions about how to interpret this data—please reach out directly to the APPA and/or AVMA.\n\nThe Numbers\n\nU.S. Pet Ownership Estimates Fact 2017-2018 AVMA Sourcebook 2021-2022 APPA Survey Total number of U.S. households 125.819M 128.451M Number of households with a pet 74.4M (59%)\n\n90.5M* (70%)\n\n*In 1988, the APPA estimated 56% of U.S. households owned a pet.\n\nPercentage of households that foster pets 8% Percentage of pet owners who foster pets 11% Percentage of pet-owners who consider their pets to be family members 80% Percentage of pet-owners who consider their pets to be pets or companions 17% Percentage of pet-owners who consider their pets to be property 3%\n\nDogs Fact 2017-2018 AVMA Sourcebook 2021-2022 APPA Survey Households that own at least one dog 48.3M (38%) 69M (54%) Percentage of U.S. population that owns a dog 7% Dog-owning households with small (< 25 lbs) dogs 47% Dog-owning households with medium (25-40 lbs) dogs 31% Dog-owning households with large (> 40 lbs) dogs 36% Percentage of dog owners who consider their dogs to be family members 85% Percentage of dog owners who consider their dogs to be pets or companions 14% Percentage of dog owners who consider their dogs to be property 1% Average amount spent on veterinary visits per year, per household $495 $1,344 Percentage of owned dogs who are spayed or neutered 69.1% 78% Percentage of dogs who are \"pure breed\" 48.7% 56% Percentage of dogs who are mixed breed/\"mutts\" 51.3% 54%\n\nCats Fact 2017-2018 AVMA Sourcebook 2021-2022 APPA Survey Households that own at least one cat 31.9M (25%) 45.4M (35%) Percentage of U.S. households that foster cats 5% Percentage of new cat owners whose decision to acquire a cat was influenced by COVID-19 40% overall. 49% male, 33% female. 56% millennial, 40% Gen Z, 27% Baby Boomer and 19% Gen X.

We have found startling differences in pet ownership. People living in underserved communities love their pets as much as pet owners anywhere else in the nation. However, there is extreme inequity in access to veterinary care, spay/neuter providers and other services most Americans take for granted, and this difference is reflected in the data:\n\nPets living in underserved communities in the U.S.: 22 million\n\nPercentage of pets living in underserved communities who are not spayed or neutered: 88%\n\nPercentage of pets living in underserved communities who have never seen a veterinarian: 69%\n\nLearn more about our Pets for Life program\n\nCommunity Cat Estimates\n\nCats can be divided into three populations—those who are personal pets, those being cared for by shelters and rescues and those who live their lives out in our communities. Community cats are friendly stray or abandoned cats as well as feral (unsocialized) cats and cats who fall somewhere in between. These cats are unowned, but may be provided with food, water and/or shelter by caring individuals. The HSUS advocates for a trap-neuter-return approach to humanely managing community cats.\n\nEstimated number of community cats in the U.S.: 30 to 40 million [1]\n\nPercentage of community cats who are spayed/neutered: Unknown (this will vary by community based on implementation of community cat management strategies)\n\nAverage number of litters produced by an intact female community cat: 1.4 litters/year [2]\n\nMean number of kittens in each litter produced by intact community cats: 3 kittens/litter [2]\n\nEstimated survivorship of community kittens, 0-6 months: 25% [2]\n\nEstimated annual survivorship of adult community cats: 70% [3]\n\nPercentage of people who believe leaving a community cat outdoors is preferable to having him or her caught and euthanized: 81% [4]\n\nPercentage of people in the U.S. providing food for community cats: 10% of the general public and 17% of pet owners feed free-roaming cats.

The Humane Society of the United States is working with a wide variety of stakeholders to change this through Shelter Animals Count, an initiative formed in 2011 to create and share a national database of sheltered animal statistics, providing facts and enabling insights that will save lives and keep more pets with their families. In the meantime, here are the best estimates we've found:\n\nCats and Dogs\n\n*Sources:\n\nASPCA Pet Statistics\n\nBest Friends Animal Shelter Statistics and Animal Welfare Statistics\n\nIn some regions of the United States, 50-75% of the shelter population is cats, and cats and kittens are overwhelmingly more at risk for euthanasia.\n\nThe number of cats and dogs entering shelters annually is down significantly from 20+ million in 1973. (Source: Dr. Andrew Rowan, Jan. 2019)\n\nThe euthanasia of healthy, adoptable cats and dogs in U.S. shelters is down to its lowest point in history. While difficult to pinpoint an exact figure, best estimates are that fewer than 750,000 healthy and safe cats and dogs are euthanized annually. The remaining cats and dogs who are euthanized experience untreatable medical illnesses or are unsafe to place in the community.Estimated amount spent by humane organizations annually: $3 billion (about $10 per capita) (Source: Dr. Andrew Rowan, Jan. 2019)\n\nEstimated amount spent by animal control organizations annually: $800 million to $1 billion (about $34 per capita) (Dr. Andrew Rowan, Jan. 2019)\n\nEstimated number of brick-and-mortar animal shelters in the US: 4,404 (Source: Best Friends Animal Society)\n\nDocument"
