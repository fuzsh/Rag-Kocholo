A service animal means an animal that is trained for the purposes of assisting or accommodating the sensory, mental, or physical disability of a disabled person. Under the law, the provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship does not constitute the work or tasks of a service animal; and\n\n\"Whereas, no vest, other marking, or documentation is required for an animal to qualify as a service animal, nor are such vests, markings, or documentation a reliable indication of whether an animal is, by law, a service animal. People sometimes erroneously think that a therapy animal, an emotional support animal, or any animal wearing a vest or having any other type of marking is a service animal as defined by law; and\n\n\"Whereas, there is an increasing number of occurrences in which people exploit the confusion related to service animals and attempt to bring an animal into a place that it would otherwise not be allowed to enter by passing off the pet, therapy animal, or emotional support animal as a service animal, either by oral misrepresentation, placement of a vest or other marking on the animal, or presentation of a \"certificate\", despite knowing that it is not a service animal; and\n\n\"Whereas, some companies mislead individuals into believing that they will be entitled to the rights or privileges for individuals with disabilities with service animals if they buy the company's vests or obtain some type of certificate. These misrepresentations, in some cases, are unlawful deceptive trade practices and compound the confusion around service animals; and\n\n\"Whereas, commendably, federal and state laws require places of public accommodation, including airports, restaurants, theaters, stores, hospitals, and more, to allow any animal that is presented as a service animal into the place of public accommodation. These same places of public accommodation face a dilemma if someone enters the premises and intentionally misrepresents his animal as a service animal; and\n\n\"Whereas, when people try to falsely represent a nonservice animal as a service animal, business owners and other places of public accommodation become increasingly distrustful that the animals being represented to them as service animals are, in fact, service animals. Misrepresentation of service animals delegitimizes the program and makes it harder for persons with disabilities to gain unquestioned acceptance of their legitimate, properly trained, and essential service animals.

Restitution.\n\n(A) A defendant convicted of a violation of Sections 47-3-930, 47-3-940, 47-3-950, or 47-3-960 may be ordered to make full restitution for damages including incidental and consequential expenses incurred by the guide dog or service animal and its user, which arise out of or are related to the criminal offense.\n\n(B) Restitution ordered pursuant to this section includes, but is not limited to:\n\n(1) the value of the replacement of an incapacitated or deceased guide dog or service animal, the training of a replacement guide dog or service animal, or retraining of the affected guide dog or service animal and related veterinary and care expenses; and\n\n(2) medical expenses of the guide dog or service animal user, training of the guide dog or service animal user, and compensation for wages or earned income lost by the guide dog or service animal user.\n\n(C) This article does not affect civil remedies available for conduct punishable under this article. Restitution paid pursuant to this article must be set off against damages awarded in a civil action arising out of the same conduct that resulted in the restitution payment.\n\nHISTORY: 2003 Act No. 37, Section 1, eff June 2, 2003; 2019 Act No. 44 (S.281), Section 5, eff May 16, 2019.\n\nEditor's Note\n\n2019 Act No. 44, preamble, provides as follows:\n\n\"Whereas, service animals that are properly trained to assist persons with disabilities play a vital role in establishing independence for such persons; and\n\n\"Whereas, the term \"service animal\" has a distinct meaning in the law. A service animal means an animal that is trained for the purposes of assisting or accommodating the sensory, mental, or physical disability of a disabled person. Under the law, the provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship does not constitute the work or tasks of a service animal; and\n\n\"Whereas, no vest, other marking, or documentation is required for an animal to qualify as a service animal, nor are such vests, markings, or documentation a reliable indication of whether an animal is, by law, a service animal.

Now, therefore, [Text of Act].\"\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\n2019 Act No. 44, Section 5, in (A), substituted \"Sections 47-3-930, 47-3-940, 47-3-950, or 47-3-960\" for \"this article\"; and in (B), substituted \"ordered pursuant to this section\" for \"for a conviction under this article\".\n\nSECTION 47-3-980. Intentional misrepresentation of animal as service animal; penalties.\n\n(A) It is unlawful for a person to intentionally misrepresent an animal in his possession as a service animal or service animal-in-training for the purpose of obtaining any right or privilege provided to a disabled person if the person knows that the animal in his possession is not a service animal or service animal-in-training.\n\n(B) A person who is adjudicated to be in violation of the provisions of subsection (A) must be fined:\n\n(1) for a first offense, an amount not more than two hundred fifty dollars;\n\n(2) for a second offense, an amount not more than five hundred dollars; and\n\n(3) for a third or subsequent offense, an amount not more than one thousand dollars.\n\n(C) Inquiries made in order to investigate and enforce the provisions of this section are limited to those inquiries allowed by the Department of Justice pursuant to 28 C.F.R. Section 36.302.\n\n(D) A custodial arrest for a violation of subsection (A) must not be made, except upon a warrant issued for failure to appear in court when summoned or for failure to pay an imposed fine. A violation of subsection (A) does not constitute a criminal offense.\n\nHISTORY: 2019 Act No. 44 (S.281), Section 1, eff May 16, 2019.\n\nEditor's Note\n\n2019 Act No. 44, preamble, provides as follows:\n\n\"Whereas, service animals that are properly trained to assist persons with disabilities play a vital role in establishing independence for such persons; and\n\n\"Whereas, the term \"service animal\" has a distinct meaning in the law.

Rules and regulations related to access of places of public accommodation by nonservice animals.\n\nPlaces of public accommodation may establish rules and regulations related to access to such facilities by nonservice animals, including emotional support animals.\n\nHISTORY: 2019 Act No. 44 (S.281), Section 1, eff May 16, 2019.\n\nEditor's Note\n\n2019 Act No. 44, preamble, provides as follows:\n\n\"Whereas, service animals that are properly trained to assist persons with disabilities play a vital role in establishing independence for such persons; and\n\n\"Whereas, the term \"service animal\" has a distinct meaning in the law.
