        "text": "Story and photos by K. Krombie\n\nA writer's visit to the birthplace of Stalin comes accompanied by a constant stream of Georgian street dogs that vary in temperament from one location to the next.\n\nMy reason for being in Georgia was as the sidekick tag-along of a London-based journalist friend who specializes in former Soviet Union regions of the world. Prior to my arrival from New York, my friend had spent a week acclimatizing to the Caucasus time zone and to the toxic tailing dams of Armenia, Georgia's neighboring country to the south.\n\nOur maladies upon meeting in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi were—in my friend's case, a mild case of arsenic and cyanide poisoning—and in mine, sleep deprivation and dissatisfaction with the inadequate guidebook I'd read on the plane. Its contents could be summed up by a cautionary piece of advice, which was not to smile at Georgians because they probably won't smile back.\n\nThe premise of the original trip—to explore the Russian-occupied state of Abkhazia, formerly the Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic—had fallen through due to Ukraine War-related complications slamming shut the borders. Instead, further on in the trip, we made do with indulging in the Abkhazian custom (at least, according to a bartender at the Old Galeon, a cavernous punk-oriented dive bar in the city of Kutaisi) of drinking shots of chacha, a popular Georgian brandy, before swallowing lemon slices topped with sugar and coffee grounds.\n\nIn Tbilisi, Old Silk Road sulfur bathhouses, roadside inns, and ancient wine cellars mingle with Soviet-era brutalism, broken Lego apartments, grand 19th-century Rococo and Moorish Revival-style performance venues and techno clubs. The most famous techno club, Bassiani, was once a Soviet stadium swimming pool. The proud and persevering Georgian identity has survived centuries of invading empires. The country's present-day desire to be recognized as a proactive part of a forward-looking Europe is the dominant feature of self-expression in art and conversation.\n\nThe Dog Days of Georgia's Capital\n\nDuring my first few days in Tbilisi, the customary sightseeing pastime of people watching was swiftly replaced by a fervent dog watch. Having lived on four continents, witnessing stray animals was nothing new, but in Georgia, I was spellbound by the sheer volume of street dogs and the ways in which they interacted with the landscape and people in the transcontinental space between the East and the West.\n\nFor the most part, the dogs were friendly and wolf-like with thick, dusty coats, a mix of hard graft breeds modified over centuries to guard or pull. On sunny days in the capital, sleeping dogs lay along the Kura river bridges and the Soviet military vintage stalls at the Dry Bridge Flea Market, on the fortress of Narikala, or in the narrow twists of Old Town. Others lounged under the graffitied underpasses, the doorways of medieval cathedrals, and the courtyards outside Fabrika—an old Soviet sewing factory-turned hip hostel—and the former address of Stalin's mass-murdering secret police chief Lavrentiy Beria.\n\nAt dusk, a multitude of loner dogs shook themselves awake and paid marginally more attention to the buzz of human activity. Wandering into the outside seating areas of bars and restaurants, they searched for new positions to sit in, that much closer to feeding opportunities. As night descended, gathering tourists and locals at Vakhtang Gorgasali Square listened to buskers and watched the circus sideshow of invigorated dogs running rings around the human throng. From underneath the teal-colored stools at the nearby Cafe Accent, at which off the menu items included homemade cognac and coffee readings, street cats boxed with human attempts to pet them and snatched any food that they could get at.\n\nGoing to the Dogs in Gori and Chiatura\n\nOn one particular night, the aforementioned cognac led us on a brandy quest to corner shops with diminishing returns. My dog-shunning friend, haunted by the vicious canine street toughs of Armenia, nevertheless fell for a mousy-coated feral hound whom he petted outside of a brandy-stop-shop. After waiting for us outside, the dog ambled behind us on the cobbles. Throughout the night, further outings resulted in repeat interactions with the same winsome animal and a chance meeting with Gabrielle Rites, a techno star of Tbilisi's post-\"rave revolution.\"\n\nThe only people on the street at the witching hour, we were surrounded by a sea of dogs, going about their business as if on a morning commute. Dismissive of the pack mentality, the detached dogs of Tbilisi seldom interact with one another, but at night they run their own kind of city within a city.\n\nThe city of Gori in eastern Georgia, our next stop after Tbilisi, is the birthplace of Stalin. It has a tumbleweed atmosphere despite the museums and cafes that serve \"Mexican fries.\" The Memorial of Georgian Warrior Heroes, a gathering of statues reminiscent of Monty Python's Black Knight due to their deliberately missing pieces, sits below the medieval Gori Fortress. Tbilisi had it on display for a few years, then after changing their minds, regifted it to Gori. Three large dogs stalked us to the warriors, their ears taut and angled back. It would have been a mistake to offer a peace-making hand to any of them. The leader of the pack, a strapping German Shepherd, locked eyes with me and tilted its head. It had probably followed countless others to the peculiar statues and observed the same perplexity.\n\nGori's Joseph Stalin Museum elicited a similar response. Stalin's curated biography had apparently become a little less biased over time, quite possibly due to the ever-decreasing generation that remembered him. By and large, Georgia doesn't miss the shackles of Communism but its relationship with \"Soso\"—a diminutive of Stalin's birth name \"Ioseb\" and his affectionate nickname—is more complex. At the entrance to the museum, close to the lifted and shifted shack where Stalin lived for some of his childhood, scattered dogs monitored the ins and outs of visitors. Upon leaving the museum's \"fun feature,\" Stalin's personal train carriage, a small dog hugged my leg and then followed us through Gori to our car. Numerous logistical circumstances prevented me from allowing it to hop on in.\n\nWe drove to the sparsely populated Chiatura, a mining city in Western Georgia. After manganese was discovered by a Georgian poet in 1879, the mining and distribution of the mineral went on to supply fifty percent of its industrial global demand. During the Russian Revolution and under Stalin's protection, the Chiatura miners backed the Bolsheviks, an anomaly in Menshevik Georgia. In the 1920s, western investment came via New York businessman and politician W. Averell Harriman (son of railroad tycoon Edward Harriman, after whom New York's Harriman State Park is named).\n\nIn 1954, a cable car system was introduced to transport the miners to and from work and the rest of Chiatura to and from their mountain homes. The Soviet-era cable cars, known as flying coffins or Stalin cars, were discontinued in 2021 due to safety concerns and replaced with new French-made cars. Today, only a few of the Chiatura mines—owned by a Georgian subsidiary of a British steel company—are in use. On the city's outskirts, protesting locals have sewn their lips shut after sinkholes, caused by the mines, destroyed their homes and roads.\n\nOn Chiatura's main street, not long after dusk, sooty stray dogs appeared less frequently than the suspiciously high number of pharmacies. Less inclined to take food, they nevertheless had less fat on their bodies than the dogs of Tbilisi. Ten minutes after entering an empty bar-restaurant, we summoned a surprised looking woman from a back room who then led us down a corridor into a large, shockingly bright venue. A gathering of birthday party revelers—the only other people there—eyed us with disdain before delivering a mountain of food including birthday cake to our table. They spent the rest of the evening making toasts, dancing, and ignoring us.\n\nBack at our rented apartment above a blacked-out lobby, sleep was hard to come by. The street dogs of Chiatura, inhabiting over a century of hard history, barked and howled relentlessly until dawn. They had multiplied in the night and thrown their own rowdy party. At Tkibuli, another mining city that we stopped at—known, incidentally, for its collapsing mines—resting dogs had to be stepped over in order to access places of business.\n\nCanines in Kutaisi\n\nKutaisi, an ancient city on the Rioni River, is an increasingly popular tourist destination owing to the budget airline Wizz Air connecting the city to the rest of Europe. It is also a sought-after, cheaper alternative to Tbilisi for Georgian residents. Since the war in Ukraine and the emergence of Russian draft-dodgers, rents in Tbilisi have tripled. Set into motion by warm days and chilly evenings, once again I observed the street dogs make connections with humans for alfresco leftovers and transient interspecies friendships. At a restaurant called Papavero, a Southern European-style dining experience included the weight of a sleeping dog on my foot under the table. In spite of the cooling temperatures, we mostly ate outside in the evenings on account of the Georgian restaurant preference for bright hospital lighting. Dinner with dogs became routine.\n\nAt another Kutaisi restaurant, where the smiling waitress decided to remove our food-filled plates because she'd had enough, a medium-sized black mutt trotted over and rolled coquettishly onto her back. Later that night, she sniffed me out at a couple more venues and greeted me upon each of my exits. This was the kind of acknowledgement I believed I deserved. I'd put the work in by setting aside any rogue canine fear in this unfamiliar country. I'd given these creatures my attention and my food. While I petted her, an observer informed me that \"This is what she does, everyone here knows her, the dog meets a lot of people.\"\n\nNot to be deterred by this accusation of indiscriminate selection, I made non-committal plans to adopt her. She followed me and a group of new friends into the night, then joined a random pack who chased and barked at passing traffic as if forming a protective barrier alongside us. One of our group, a Kutaisi-based Russian, told us that the gentlemanly umbrella he carried was a permanent accessory that doubled as a weapon in the event of any canine aggression. He was speaking from experience, he said.\n\nThe Ruins of a Communist-era Spa Town\n\nTskaltubo is a radon-carbonate mineral spring spa town not far from Kutaisi. Present-day spa visitors total just over half a percent of the annual Soviet-era number. Meanwhile, husks of former Soviet sanatoriums provide unofficial tourist attractions. Getting into these places can be tricky due to the assault course of barking dogs patrolling the entrances. I spotted the worst of them through the window of the Metallurgy sanatorium, a vague canine outline that matched an unending loop of audible hostility, wedged into a staircase step inside the building. Even though the barking persisted, once we were inside, treading broken glass and buckling staircases, somehow the belligerent dog never found us.\n\nThe various sanatoriums were once divided among professions for Communist-dictated holidays. Some of them—with limited electricity and little or no maintenance in over thirty years—are currently occupied by Abkhazian refugees. Through the windows of ascending sanatorium floors, scattered cows, sleeping in the overgrown grounds and oblivious to the bellicose barking, came into view.\n\nIn the more remote areas of Georgia, where there are less people to provide food, the canine bonds are stronger. The closer a person is to the Russian border, the more likely they are to be tackled to the ground, as I was, by a pack of street huskies. Luckily, the street dogs of Oni, in the highland area of Racha, just wanted to play, but unlike the bigger city dogs, they chase, nip, and shove. Their rough and tumble curiosity stood at odds with the silent side glances from dubious human locals. Nika, the son of our Oni hosts, an artistic family who make garden art from what they proclaim to be and what genuinely looks like dinosaur eggs, told me that the locals aren't exactly hostile, it's just that they don't understand why anyone would want to visit Oni.\n\nI asked him if the locals participate in the seasonal skiing and hiking excursions that he organizes. He laughed and shook his head. To the residents of Oni, the lush forests and mountain ranges are all they have ever known. Such leisure pursuits are strictly for tourists.\n\nNika's family, whose property is decorated with wolf and bear skins, own a German Shepherd called Bomboro, who, according to Nika, had two million views on YouTube carrying out household chores. With a clean coat, her own little house with installed heating, and a habit of carrying her food bowl around so that someone will fill it, Bomboro belongs to an elite class. Compared with every other dog I'd encountered in Georgia she was a pampered canine queen.\n\nSoon after getting a foot over the border of the Russian-occupied state of South Ossetia and then retreating along an icy Road Runner-style cliff, the drive back to Tbilisi was a long one. En route, we found a small, rusty-colored dog on the roadside next to the crystal-clear Shaori Reservoir. Its slightly protruding rib cage indicated the obvious. There was no one around for miles. We gave him the lobiani that had been in the back of the car since the Chiatura birthday party and watched him swallow it up in seconds.\n\nHaving driven for hundreds of miles through Georgia, sometimes upon roads that seemed to have given up in width, length, and surface at very abrupt points, among traffic that moved according to mysterious mood swings, the noticeably low roadkill was a remarkable detail. Though plentiful, the homeless dogs of Georgia are fed and cared for to varying degrees by nationwide communities. Tags in their ears signify that they have been caught, neutered, given a rabies shot, and released. Contrary to much of the sanitized Western world, people live alongside them rather than \"rescuing\" or exterminating them, although a growing number of shelters do exist. Similarly, cows and pigs roam Georgia's roads and mountains and fall asleep in random residential gardens. Presumably, the farming network is laissez-faire, and the animals are returned when their ultimate function is called upon.\n\nIn much of the world, coexisting with—rather than controlling the various species that belong to the categories of pets or pests—is the norm. Dogs that haven't been rendered piteous by cruel or freakish breeding are impressively self-sufficient in spite of concerns regarding population and sanitation. Unlike many of the coiffured dogs in my adopted city of New York, the Central Park segment of which can often be seen wobbling on designer shoes courtesy of their dirt-averse humans, the street dogs of Georgia appear largely unfazed by their own species or any other. As opposed to the canine behavior in pet-centric leash-tugging parts of the world, it is conceivable that the Georgian dog hobos enjoy their freedom too much to be making frenzied contact with their own kind.\n\nIt is impossible to absorb Georgia without including the canine factor. At the very start of my trip, the street dogs registered as problematic, but after adjusting to the country's makeshift rhythms, they came to represent an idiosyncratic and agreeable component of Georgia's national character.\n\nK.
