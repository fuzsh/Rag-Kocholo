        "text": "According to the World Health Organisation, around 200 million stray dogs worldwide. Impressively, not one of them lives in the Netherlands. It’sthe first country in the world without any stray dogs! 👏\n\nPuppies are whisked around the city in bike baskets, most cafés and restaurants are dog-friendly, and small pets can ride on public transport for a reduced price.\n\nREAD MORE | Having a pet in the Netherlands: all you need to know\n\nThis dog-loving atmosphere evidently pays off — but how did the Dutchies do it?\n\nThe history of stray dogs in the Netherlands\n\nOwning dogs used to be a sign of status in the Netherlands. Upper-class people owned dogs as pets for sporting purposes, and the poorer masses owned mongrels (mutts) for working purposes.\n\nMany Dutch paintings depict the dogs of ye olden times, such as this one by Joseph Stevens:\n\nGiven its intrinsic link to social status, there was a massive dog population in the Netherlands in the 19th century.\n\nHowever, an outbreak of rabies caused widespread fear of contamination — leading to many owners abandoning their (possibly) disease-ridden pets.\n\nAs a result, society’s perspective on the human-dog relationship shifted. The health of a dog came to be seen as a reflection of the well-being of the owner. 🧍🐕\n\nREAD MORE | Best dog breeds to consider if you live in the Netherlands\n\nDuring this time, the Dutch government also created a dog tax (hondenbelasting) in an attempt to regulate the number of stray dogs in the Netherlands.\n\nUnfortunately, it had the opposite effect: there were even more stray dogs, as many people could no longer afford (or didn’t want to pay) to keep their pet dogs.\n\nThe Animal Protection Act\n\nThe Dutch Society for the Protection of Animals — the country’s first animal protection agency — was founded in 1864 in The Hague. A century later, the Animal Protection Act came into effect.\n\nThe act stated that it’s forbidden for an owner to abuse any animal. Doing so is even punishable, with a prison sentence of up to three years and a fine of €16,750. 😱\n\nREAD MORE | Sharp rise in the number of cats and dogs used for animal testing in the Netherlands\n\n“What do we mean by””no stray dogs”?”What do we mean by “no stray dogs”?\n\n“The term”“stray dog” can mean many different things:”The term “stray dog” can mean many different things:\n\nFree-roaming dogs with an owner: they have an owner, but the owner lets the dog run partially free throughout the day\n\nFree-roaming dogs without an owner: dogs that are abandoned by their owner\n\nCommunity dogs: dogs that don’t have one owner but are cared for by a community\n\nFeral dogs: dogs that are not cared for by anyone and survive on their own\n\nStray dogs are commonly unwanted, as they tend to spread disease and fleas, and mess with human garbage (among other things). Nowadays, there are hardly any stray dogs in the Netherlands, so the country is hailed for having eradicated the issue. 🙌\n\nHow did the Netherlands manage to eradicate its stray dog problem?\n\nNot through euthanasia! Hurray! 🎉\n\nThe Dutch achieved it through the CNVR programme (Collect, Neuter, Vaccinate, and Return), a nationwide, government-funded sterilisation programme. The World Animal Protection Agency believes it’s the most effective way to combat a stray dog population.\n\nAdditionally, many municipalities spike taxes for store-bought dogs to incentivise people to adopt homeless dogs from shelters instead. 💖\n\nFurther, the Netherlands set up an animal police force monitoring crimes against animals. Moreover, the force also rescues animals in trouble.\n\n“Marianne Thieme, the leader of the Dutch political Party for the Animals (PvdD), thinks there is a correlation between how society treats its animals with how it treats its civilians. She says, “There is a direct link between violence against animals and violence against humans.”\n\nThese days, about one in five Dutchies owns a dog after taking a million of them off the streets. 💖"
