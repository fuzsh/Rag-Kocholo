“The BOBS!”

Bob Stroger

Blues legend Bob Stroger, born on December 27, 1930, is considered one of Chicago’s top blues bassists. This Blues Music Award winner is respected and internationally well-known. A blues artist of this caliber is truly a rarity, and at almost the age of a century, he’s still performing over 200 performances a year.

Bob was presented a proclamation award and the key to the city of Chicago, as a cherished, living legend. Bob has toured and performed with many prominent blues musicians in his lifetime, such as Sunnyland Slim, known for being one of the pioneers of Chicago blues, and Honey Boy Edwards, who performed with the legendary Robert Johnson.

Bob has also had the honor of playing with Otis Rush, Eddie King, Rufus Forman, Koko Taylor, Pinetop Perkins, and Willie “Big Eyes” Smith, to name a few. With all the achievements that Bob has received throughout his life, he still feels that his fans are his biggest reward and his love for music is what keeps him going each day. As he famously says, “I’m Bob Stroger and I am the Blues!”
