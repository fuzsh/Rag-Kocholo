        "text": "The Memorial Day Weekend in the United States serves as the official start of summer and many people will be making road trips and having backyard barbeques with family and friends to celebrate the season and remember those who gave their lives for all of us! For the sixth year in a row, I have compiled my Roadhouse 66 Best Blues Songs list to help with the festivities and hopefully enliven road trips!\n\nThis year’s list is drawn from the over 800 albums and singles that I received from record companies, publicists, and through my association with Blues Music Fan Radio. During 2022, I listened to or sampled 9,419 new songs! Approximately 1,000 of them made it onto playlists for my shows on BMFR and my sets on the Second Life grid. And from among those songs, after over a month of research and review, I have finalized the list.\n\nMy 2022 Roadhouse 66 Best Blues Song list is not “the list”. But it is a representative view of the types of music that I love to spin and listen to: contemporary blues, blues rock, classic R&B, and roots music. And whether it is the first song or lhe last on the listing, these are all simply badass Roadhouse Bluzin’ tunes! My hope is that you will listen to the Youtube playlist of these songs (that really helps me to build my channel) and, as the ultimate tribute to the artists, buy the single or album from your favorite download service!\n\nThe listing includes artists from the United States, Canada, Europe, and both Australia and New Zealand. Almost a third of the list are female artists. And the range of blues on the playlist runs from traditional Chicago Blues to window shaking blues rock! Outside of the Top Twelve, the songs are listed in reverse alphabetical order because number position doesn’t matter: Every artist on this list produced a memorable song that will be remembered as one of the very very best of 2022! I hope you enjoy the songs as much as I have!\n\nThe Roadhouse Top 12 Best Blues Songs of 2022\n\nBuddy Guy – Blues Don’t Lie\n\nHe is on his final tour at the age of 86 and going out in style!!\n\nShawn James – Lead The Way\n\nThe first time I heard his voice I was stunned!! He is from the southside of Chicago and an indie artist with a bright future.\n\nBywater Call – Remain\n\nThis Canadian group features lead vocalist Meghan Parnell who has one of those once in a generation voices.\n\nRobert Jon & the Wreck – Rescue Train\n\nBased in southern California, this group has taken the world by storm over the last five years or so. The music is vibrant and can dang sure rattle the window panes!\n\nSugaray Rayford – In Too Deep\n\nSugaray is simply a badass and one of my favorite singers. AND he spins tunes too which makes him a double badass!! And he loves cigars which makes him a TRIPLE Badass!!!\n\nJaniva Magness – Strong As Steel\n\nShe has overcome a lot in her life and continues to inspire and motivate blues listeners with her songs. A multiple time winner of major Blues Awards, Janiva is one of the great voices of her generation.\n\nKeb’ Mo’ – ’62 Chevy\n\nKeb is just cool. Always has been and always will be.\n\nTedeschi Trucks Band – Playing With My Emotions\n\nSusan’s voice and Derek’s slide guitar…enough said. They simply make musical magic with a huge talented band!\n\nEric Gales – Too Close to the Fire\n\nEric has been rockin’ the blues for 30 years. Finally, with the production assistance of Joe Bonamassa, they bottled the magic for both this song and the overall album!!!\n\nAlbert Castiglia – What’s Wrong With You\n\nI got to interview Albert and Mike Zito on tour as the Blood Brothers during April. He was sincere, honest, and forthcoming talking about the blues. He is one badass Roadhouse bluesman!!\n\nMike Zito – Blues for the Southside\n\nMike Zito is the Renaissance man of the blues. He writes, sings, produces, and is co-owner of a great blues label Gulf Coast Records. This instrumental is not only of the great recordings of 2022 but one of the greatest blues rock instrumentals of all time!!\n\nWalter Trout – Ride\n\nWalter started out playin’ juke joints in New Jersey sharing stages with Bruce Springsteen in the late 60’s. He honed his craft with John Mayall and the BluesBreakers in the 80’s. And since 1991 has tirelessly toured promoting a brand of the blues that I call the Roadhouse Blues. Now in in his seventies, he is producing some of his finest work!\n\nThe Roadhouse 66 Best Blues Songs of 2022 Complete List\n\n#blues #bluesmusic #bluesrock #benveeroadhouseblues #bluesnews\n\nBen Vee started out spinning songs on terrestrial radio and at nightclubs back in the 1970’s in his home state of Louisiana. After a career in the construction business, he returned to DJing in 2011. He now hosts two shows each week on http://www.bluesmusicfan.com and writes about the blues at http://www.benveeblues.com from his home in Connecticut. He also has a personal 24 hour stream devoted to the Roadhouse Blues… WRHB as well as a Youtube channel.\n\nBuddy Guy Farewell Tour begins February 11\n\nAt the age of 86 and still at the top of his form, Buddy Guy will be doing his farewell tour during 2023. He starts it in Mumbai, India on February 11, begins the North American leg on February 17th in Rockford, Illinois, and literally crisscrosses the country into the fall. He will also fit in appearances in Australia and a number of places in Europe as he does his final live performances in a career that has spanned over 60 years. Buddy is equally at home with Muddy Waters and Jimi Hendrix and puts on a show that includes playing in the crowd, playing the guitar with his teeth and behind his back, and regaling the audience with little stories about the songs he performs and the life he has lived. I have seen him three times and they were incredible shows. If you haven’t heard him live, check the tour dates on his website and make plans now. I don’t think the tickets will be available for long! AND I have a feeling that a lot of well known blues artists will be popping up on stage with him to say their final farewells to the reigning King of the Blues.\n\nNew Roadhouse Blues Releases Out Now\n\nRyan Foret & Foret Tradition – That’s What’s Happening Here : Vibrant blues and R&B sound out of New Orleans!\n\nEddie 9V – Capricorn : May be the reincarnation of Lowell George, Leon Russell, & Duane Allman!! He is only 27!\n\nTeresa James – With a Little Help From Her Friends : Teresa bluzin’ the Beatles…well worth a ticket to ride!!\n\nThe 2:19 – We Will Get Through This : From Ireland, they kick out some badass rockin’ blues!\n\nPlanned Roadhouse Blues Releases in February 2023\n\nSavoy Brown – Blues All Around (Feb 17th) : Kim Simmonds knew he had cancer and just kept recording right up to his death late in 2022..RIP\n\nThe Gayle Harrod Band – Temptation (Feb 24th) : Awesome voice and blues from this talent out of Baltimore!\n\nPlanned Releases in March 2023\n\nMike Zito & Albert Castiglia – Blood Brothers (March 17th)\n\nAlly Venable – Real Gone (March 24th)\n\nEric Bibb – Ridin’ (March 24th)\n\n#blues #bluesmusic #bluesrock #benveeroadhouseblues"
