A spectacular festival lineup was intricately set up with top bands, special guests and many revue sets that treated the audience to the a non-stop blues ride. That this festival has come into its own was apparent from the many blues organizations and publications who came from far-away places to attend. I am personally appreciative of being included on the Muddy Waters Tribute set which was a symbolic career highpoint for me. It was great to see the amazing reaction that Mud Morganfield received, as he summoned the spirit of his father in a breathtaking way. Thanks to festival organizers Randy Chortkoff and Delta Groove Productions for a job well done. To see the festival posters click here, and here.
