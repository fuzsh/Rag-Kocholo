        "text": "J. Ervin Bates, aka ‘Jim Ervin’ has spent more than 10 years in broadcasting as an on-air personality. He began his career in Bay City and Flint before landing in the Greater Lansing area. During his tenure on the local radio dial, his voice could be heard on Oldies 94.1 (WIBM), Country 102 (WILS), Lite Rock 99 (WFMK), and Country 100.7 (WITL). Erv’s passion for music was fostered and developed throughout his formative years, where he was exposed to every music genre from Big Band to Swing, via his maternal grandparents, to Oldies, Classic Rock and Blues, via his late mother. Erv added the 80’s and gospel to his collection on his own, and then via the influence of his three children, he was exposed and learned to appreciate music of the 90’s, 00’s and beyond. Erv has often said, he finds music to appreciate in all genres, and he allows himself to do just that.\n\nCapital Area Blues Society: Capital Area Blues Society exists for the preservation of, promotion of, education about the uniquely American music called the Blues.\n\nConnections"
