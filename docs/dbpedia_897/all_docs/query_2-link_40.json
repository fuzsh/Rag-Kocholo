        "text": "American singer and guitarist (born 1945)\n\nMusical artist\n\nJohn Primer (born March 5, 1945, Camden, Mississippi, United States) is an American Chicago blues and electric blues singer and guitarist who played behind Junior Wells in the house band at Theresa's Lounge and as a member of the bands of Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters and Magic Slim before launching an award-winning career as a front man, carrying forward the traditional Windy City sound into the 21st century.[2][1][3]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nChildhood\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn into a family of Mississippi sharecroppers, Primer grew up imbued with a strong work ethic from his forebears and in a farming community that was deeply involved in the blues tradition, singing work songs in the field during the week and spirituals in church on Sundays. Living on the Mansell Plantation in rural Madison County, he lived in a shack with no running water and a leaking roof with his large, extended family. He shared a bed with cousins, and lost his father at age 22 after a truck accident when he was four years old.[4]\n\nHe fell in love with the blues in infancy when his father and an elder cousin played guitar and sang at night after a hard day in the fields. His mother subsequently moved to Chicago in order to secure a job and support her family. She promised to bring John and his sister to the big city when they reached age 18, leaving them with family. Depressed and lonely, young Primer frequently went into the neighboring woods, where he cried his troubles away and began singing the blues in solitude. He eventually built himself a diddley bow on the side of his grandmother's house out of broom wire, two nails and a brick and began accompanying himself as he sang, eventually playing for dimes and quarters in his schoolyard. After listening Jimmy Reed, Little Milton, B.B. King, Albert King and Muddy Waters on his grandmother's record player, his biggest dream was to play alongside Muddy Waters one day.[4][5]\n\nEarly years in Chicago\n\n[edit]\n\nSetting his sights on his dream and with a Harmony guitar in hand, Primer relocated to Chicago in 1963 when he reached 18, just as his mother had promised. He eventually started learning his trade by playing for tips at the legendary Maxwell Street market alongside blues superstars and raw beginners like himself.[6] He eventually landed his first regular gig, joining with Pat Rushing—one of the most iconic performers in the neighborhood—to form The Maintainers and play on Sundays. The band eventually started booking gigs in small bars and clubs on the city's West Side, most prominently The Bow Tie, Lover's Lounge and The Place. In 1968, he left Rushing to join the soul/R&B group, The Brotherhood Band, where he served as front man and began developing the unique singing style he is known for today.[4][7]\n\nSideman with the greats\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1974, he started playing seven nights a week as a member of the house band at Theresa's, the South Side club, learning how to play slide guitar from bandmate and former Muddy sideman Sammy Lawhorn and backing harmonica player Junior Wells, who regularly fronted the unit when off the road, as well as Magic Sam, James Cotton, Magic Slim and others. After seeing him in action at Theresa's, Willie Dixon invited Primer to join his Chicago Blues All-Stars in 1979, touring with him internationally for a year, during which he honed his skills as a slide guitarist, vocalist and songwriter.[4]\n\nPrimer's childhood dream came true in 1980, when Muddy Waters formed a new band after the departure of his old unit, which rebranded themselves as the Legendary Blues Band. In addition to serving as Waters' guitarist, he immediately assumed responsibilities as Muddy's bandleader and opening act. Primer held the position until Waters' passing in 1983, during which he received additional training on the six-string and Muddy instilled in him the importance of maintaining the old-school blues tradition.[8] His lengthy recording career as a sideman began as a member of the Waters band in 1980 with Blues Deluxe, a compilation recorded live by radio station WXRT-FM at Navy Pier.[9] He recorded with Muddy and the Rolling Stones at Buddy Guy's Checkerboard Lounge in 1981, a concert that was eventually released as an award-winning DVD.[10] He began sitting in at jams at the Checkerboard in that era, eventually spent two decades as the band leader for Monday night jams, where he began passing on his skills to a younger group of musicians. He maintained the position until 2001, when the original nightclub closed its doors for the final time.[4]\n\nFollowing Waters' death, Primer also joined Magic Slim's band, The Teardrops, eventually becoming its band leader and teaming on rhythm guitar with Slim's bassist brother, Nick Holt, to create what became as known as the \"lump de lump\" cadence pattern that became dominant in the Chicago blues sound. During the 13 years Primer spent at Slim's side, the band won contemporary album of the year honors in the Blues Music Awards on three occasions and received two nominations as band of the year.[4][11]\n\nSolo career\n\n[edit]\n\nPrimer made his recording debut as front man with Poor Man's Blues for Wolf Records, the Austria-based label that was also Magic Slim's longtime home. Stuff You Got to Watch on Earwig Records followed in 1991 with a lineup that included Holt on bass and Mervyn \"Harmonica\" Hinds on harmonica[12] and The Real Deal on Code Blue/Atlantic four years later with backing from harp player Billy Branch, bassist Johnny B. Gayden and keyboard player David Maxwell, among others.[13] The CD earned him a 1997 W.C. Handy Award nomination for traditional album of the year. He has subsequently enjoyed an enduring relationship with Wolf Records as well as his own Blues House Productions imprint, which was founded in 2008. One of the most honored blues artists of his generation, he is a 2017 inductee into the Chicago Blues Hall of Fame, a lifetime achievement award nominee from the Mississippi Valley Blues Society and the Pennsylvania Blues Society. His musicianship and recordings have earned two Grammy Award nominations and dozens of awards and nominations from Blues Music Awards, Blues Blast Music Awards and Living Blues magazine.[4][14][15]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbum title Record label Accreditation Year of release Poor Man's Blues Wolf Records John Primer 1991 Stuff You Got to Watch Earwig John Primer 1991 The Real Deal Code Blue/Eastwest John Primer 1995 Code Blue Sampler Code Blue Various Artists 1996 Cold Blooded Blues Man Wolf Records John Primer 1997 Keep on Lovin’ the Blues Code Blue John Primer 1997 Essential Chicago Blues House of Blues Various Artists 1997 Livin’ in the House of Blues: Roadhouse Blues House of Blues Various Artists 1997 Blues Behind Closed Doors Wolf Records John Primer 1998 It’s a Blues Life Wolf Records John Primer 1998 A Chicago Blues Tour Big Chicago Records Various Artists 1998 From West Helena to Chicago: Chicago Blues Session Vol. 8 Wolf Records Various Artists 1998 Hound Dog Taylor: A Tribute Alligator Records Various Artists 1998 Teardrops Blues Jam: Chicago Blues Session Vol. 9 Wolf Records Magic Slim & the Teardrops 1998 The Best of Slide Guitar Wolf Records Various Artists 1998 Easy Baby Wolf Records John Primer & the Teardrops 1999 Earwig 20th Anniversary Collection Earwig Various Artists 1999 Knockin’ at Your Door Telarc John Primer 2000 Blues for a Rotten Afternoon Telarc Various Artists 2000 Lucerne Blues Festival 2000 Lucerne Blues Festival Various Artists 2000 Mile by Blues Mile Lakeshore Records Various Artists 2000 Telarc's Got More Blues Telarc Various Artists 2000 Blues Is a Feeling Delmark Records Jesse Thomas with John Primer & Jodie Christian 2001 Hooked on Blues: I Have to Stop Wolf Records Various Artists 2001 All Right Blues Special Records John Primer 2002 Blue Steel: A Tribute to Elmore James Wolf Records John Primer 2003 Wolf Records 20th Anniversary Collection Wolf Records Various Artists 2003 44 Blues Guitar Killers Wolf Records Various Artists 2006 All Original Blues House Productions John Primer 2008 Chicago Blues a Living History Raisin' Music Billy Boy Arnold, Billy Branch, Carlos Johnson, John Primer, Lurrie Bell 2011 Chicago Blues a Living History: The (R)evolution Continues Raisin' Music Billy Boy Arnold, Billy Branch, Carlos Johnson, John Primer, Lurrie Bell 2011 Blues on Solid Ground Blues House Productions John Primer 2012 Knockin’ Around These Blues Delta Groove John Primer and Bob Corritore 2013 You Can Make It If You Try Wolf Records John Primer & the Teardrops 2014 Muddy Waters 100 Raisin' Music Multiple Artists 2015 Classic Chicago Blues: Live & Unreleased Wolf Records Bonnie Lee, Nick Holt, Earl Howell & John Primer 2015 That Will Never Do Wolf Records John Primer 2016 Chicago Blues a Living History: Live at Aulnay All Blues Raisin' Music Billy Boy Arnold, Billy Branch, Carlos Johnson, John Primer, Lurrie Bell 2017 Ain't Nothing You Can Do!
