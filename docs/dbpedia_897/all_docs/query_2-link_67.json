        "text": "BORN IN THE HONEY “The Pinetop Perkins Story”\n\nDVD with Bonus CD\n\nTHE ONLY AUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY OF NONAGENERIAN PINETOP PERKINS PRODUCED BY PETER CARLSON, SAGEBRUSH PRODUCTIONS 60-MINUTE DVD\n\n\"Born in the Honey - The Pinetop Perkins Story\" is a DVD/CD package that is not only a wonderful story about Pinetop's long life, but also a fascinating microcosm of The Great Migration. Born In The Honey also tells of the incident that ended his career as a guitar player, how he taught Ike Turner to play the piano, the explosion that affected his hearing, his days as a car mechanic and his nights as a ladies man. Included on this hour-long DVD is historic film footage and stills of cotton picking, African-American participation in World War II, Tutweiler and Clarksdale, MS, Helena, AR, Memphis, TN, St. Louis, MO and Cairo and Chicago, IL. Additional features include interviews with Kim Wilson, Bobby Rush, Ike Turner and performances of Pinetop with Bob Margolin, Mookie Brill, Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith, Curtis Salgado and Calvin \"Fuzz\" Jones.\n\nBONUS CD WITH 10 TRACKS – PINETOP PERKINS ON THE 88’s: LIVE IN CHICAGO\n\nTracks 1-9 (LIVE) Pinetop Perkins-Piano, Willie “Big Eyes” Smith-Drums, Robert “Bob” Stroger-Bass, “Little” Frank Krokowski-Guitar, Recorded in Chicago by Peter Carlson, Engineered by Chuck Dodson\n\nTrack 10 (Previously unreleased studio recording) Pinetop Perkins-Piano, Harp-Bob Corritore, Johnny Rapp-Guitar, Paul Thomas-Bass, Chico Chism-Drums, Produced by Bob Corritore, Engineered by Clarke Rigsby, Tempest Recordings, Tempe, AZ 1997\n\nChicken Shack\n\nHow Long Blues\n\nDown in Mississippi\n\nGrinder Man Blues\n\nLittle Bit of Your Love\n\nPerkins Boogie The Park\n\nIda B\n\nKansas City\n\nMojo\n\nRather Quit Her Than Hit Her\n\nThe Review:\n\nThis package is a real treat for the blues historian and fan of Pinetop Perkins. The DVD includes both musical and personal insight to the life of Pinetop Perkins. I enjoyed the many cool interviews with blues legends sharing stories about Pinetop over the years. The delightful bonus CD contains a few blues standards as well as some great Pinetop classics. At age 93, Pinetop continues to delight audiences across the globe with his talent, his endless energy and his enthusiasm for the blues. A few years ago I had the pleasure of meeting and sharing stories with Pinetop at the Arkansas Blues and Heritage Festival in Helena.\n\nThe thing that struck me the most was when he said this to me: “Oh, I feel blessed and lucky to have every day that the good Lord gives me and to be able to keep playing the blues”. Pinetop might not be the fanciest piano player. He might not be the best blues singer or performer. Pinetop Perkins is a living blues legend, one who has paid his dues and has paved the way for others in this profession. For all that and more, in my opinion, he deserves all the respect, all those Handy Awards and a lifetime of memories to cherish forever."
