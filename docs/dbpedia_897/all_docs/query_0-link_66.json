Buon Appetito!\n\nBlues On Deck\n\nWhether taking in a blues show for a few hours on a river steamboat or sunset cruise, or embarking on a multi-day all-in-one floating festival, adding some water to your blues will elevate your blues experience.\n\nShredding the Glass Ceiling By Irene Johnson\n\nIn blues, a genre steeped in tradition, the presence of women electric lead guitarists is a testament to the evolving landscape of music. Today’s guitar women are reshaping the narrative of what it means to be a lead blues guitarist.\n\nBlues From the Bluegrass State By Keith Clements and Natalie Carter\n\nKentucky has not only produced many seminal artists of the blues, but continues to cultivate, preserve, and promote a rich blues scene.

The two will do a set in honor of Bob’s longtime associate, Baton Rouge native, the late Henry Gray. Bob has arranged for a number of Henry Gray‘s friends to join the celebration, with each contributing a song in honor of Henry. Jimi “Primetime” Smith remembers Henry coming over to visit his mother Johnnie Mae Dunson in Chicago when Jimi was still a young boy.\n\nBaton Rouge’s Advocate newspaper says, “This year's Baton Rouge Blues Festival has a powerful lineup, with plenty of leading lights from around town and further afield. The performer list is so strong that no matter who you end up catching you can't go wrong: Still, in the interests of mixing it up, we decided to highlight four non-headliner acts that are worth checking out.”\n\nAmong their short list they feature Jimi “Primetime” Smith and Bob Corritore’s tribute to Henry Gray who was the former band leader for Howlin' Wolf and indisputably one of Louisiana's blues greats.\n\n“One of Gray's greatest proponents was Bob Corritore,” the Advocate continues. “Based in Arizona, harmonica player Corritore is one of the busiest guys in show business, regularly touring, pumping out excellent albums, maintaining an active social media presence and running both a radio show and his Rhythm Room venue all at the same time.\n\nCorritore has been to the blues festival before, once playing alongside Gray. Now, with frequent collaborator Jimi \"Primetime\" Smith, he's performing a tribute to his old friend.\n\nThe guitar-slinging Smith is no slouch himself, having played with everyone from Etta James to Albert King. Count on some blues at its most passionate.”\n\nFind more details at the festival webpage.\n\nAPRIL:\n\n• April 22, Earth Day\n\n• International Guitar Month\n\n• National Literature & Poetry Month\n\n• National Humor Month\n\nBirthdays: April 18 Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown (1924-2005), Alexis Korner (1928–1984), Alastair Greene (1971); April 21-Clara Ward (1924-1973); April 22-George \"Harmonica\" Smith (1924-1983), Bullmoose Jackson (1919-1989); April 23-Charles \"Cow Cow\" Davenport (1894-1955); April 25-Albert King (1923-1992); April 26-Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey (1886-1939), Johnny\" Shines (1915-1992), J. B. Hutto (1926-1983), Mike Finnegan (1945-2022); April 27-Ann Peebles (1947), Michael Ledbetter (1985-2019); April 29-Big Jay McNeely (1927-2018), Otis Rush (1934-2018), Frankie Lee (1941-2015), April 30-Rev. Gary Davis (1896-1972), Mabel Scott (1915-2000), Frankie Lee Sims (1917-1970), Jimmie Lee Robinson (1931-2002)\n\nJust in case: April 23 is \"Movie Theater Day.\" Think of all the great movies you've seen on the big screen in a theater. No matter the signs of the times these days, there still seems something magical about going to the movie theater.\n\nAs far as Blues-type movies, did anyone see Who Do You Love in 2008 which was about the Chess records saga? Born To Be Blue (2015), is a semi-biographical drama about Chet Baker — a jazzy film streaked with blues. Honeydripper (2007) is about an elusive blind guitarist (played by Keb' Mo') shrouded in mystery. Ray (2004), about the most famous blind bluesman Ray Charles, bagged Jamie Foxx an Oscar.\n\nCrossroads (1986), is the Robert Johnson-inspired movie starring Ralph Macchio. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020) is about the \"Mother of the Blues\" starring Viola Davis. Cadillac Records (2008) apparently stole thunder from Who Do You Love since it came out the same year and was about the same topic. I suppose great minds think alike?\n\nThe eye-opening movie Leadbelly came out in 1976. Of course The Blues Brothers (1980) was a big hit. The short, Jammin' the Blues (1944), was basically the first-ever blues movie and a crucial part of the genre's cinematic history.\n\nThere are countless other films about blues and roots... get out of your living room when one comes around and see it in a theater... yep, before theaters themselves slip into obscurity.\n\nApril 25 is \"National Telephone Day.\" Did you know in 1876 Inventor Elisha Gray filed a patent for the telephone within hours of Alexander Graham Bell, but Bell's patent gets approved first. We've come a long, long way from a tin can and a string! HA! What would we have done without the telephone? Now we have \"Smart\" phones and barely use them to talk on!\n\nBack in 1946 Louis Jordan declared, \"Buzz me , buzz me baby, I'll be waiting for your call. If you forgot the number... come on over, you won't have to call at all.\"\n\nIn 1951 Lightnin' Hopkins sounded a bit frustrated when he exclaimed...\n\n\"Hello Central, will you please give me 209, yes, you know I wanna talk to my baby, oh Lord, she is way down the line.\"\n\nIn 1956 Peewee Crayton worried, \"The telephone is ringin', lord, and baby's on the line... I'm afraid to even answer, 'cause I know what's on her mind.\"\n\nJohn Lee Hooker cried, \"I ain't got nobody now people, just me and my telephone.\"\n\nIn 1960 Elmore James sounded pretty stoked when he sang, \"I just talked to my baby, on the telephone, she said 'stop what you're doing and come on home... I can't hold out!'\"\n\nIndeed... these days we can barely holdout for the next new phone model!\n\n___________________________________________________"
