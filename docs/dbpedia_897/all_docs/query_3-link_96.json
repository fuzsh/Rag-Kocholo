        "text": "Tahoe OnStage\n\nby Jon Siembieda\n\nSeptember 2019\n\nMississippi’s own Zac Harmon has released his debut album on Catfood Records, “Mississippi Bar BQ.” It has been No. 1 on Root’s Music Reports Soul Blues Album Chart for eight weeks in a row.\n\nI’ve been a fan of Harmon’s from afar for years. He used to play regularly in Los Angeles and built a long-standing reputation as a blazing blues guitar player, capped by winning the International Blues Challenge in Memphis in 2004 for best unsigned band. This newest record is produced by Grammy-winner Jim Gaines (Santana, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Journey), and was recorded at Sonic Ranch in Tornillo, Texas.\n\nLeadoff track “Gypsy Love” comes out of the gates with midtempo energy. “Smoke and Mirrors” has a Stevie Wonder-esque groove, tasteful background vocals, and of course, smoking blues guitar licks. “So Cold” has a Three Dog Night-kinda feel to it. Zac isn’t playing by the typical blues numbers, which I like. The production is solid. Harmon is throwing strikes.\n\nYou have to love a blues album that has a song titled “Make A Dollar Out of Fifteen Cents!” “Sunday Morning After Saturday Night” is straight outta the B.B. King playbook shuffle. The record ends with a unique cover of Bob Dylan’s “Knocking On Heaven’s Door.” Better than Clapton’s version, in my opinion.\n\nSide note – when you take the CD out of the case, there’s a recipe for Mississippi-style BBQ. Nice touch. This is a solid blues album. Really killer guitar playing. Pick it up if you’re looking for some contemporary blues, and if you’re trying to find a new spice rub for your ribs.\n\nLiving Blues\n\nby David Whiteis\n\nAugust 2019\n\nHis label may be based in El Paso, but Zac Harmon puts his Mississippi roots front and center. This disc's inside sleeve even includes a recipe for Mississippi barbequed ribs (which of course would be pork ribs, not the beef usually preferred in Texas). That said, though, the music spans an agreeably broad stylistic/regional spectrum. The title song, instead of what might be the expected juke-joint raver, is a breezy, urbane, pop-soul celebration of family, community and heritage, along with the savory soul food that exemplifies it, that recalls R. Kelly's 2015 hit Backyard Party. Elsewhere, Harmon digs in to more aggressive sounds such as the spikey, blues-funk, hard-times anthem Make a Dollar Out of Fifteen Cents (on which his voice, unfortunately, can't match the rough-hewn grit of the sound and storyline). He sounds vocally more at ease with Lord Save Me From L.A., the lament of a formerly idealistic migrant who finds himself ground down by that city's relentless soul-crushing, high-tech, high-speed Silicon Valley culture. Harmon's guitar work ranges from in-the-pocket blues sparseness to power-pop grandiosity, but it's always tasteful and musically on point-no self-indulgent noodlings or pyrotechnics.\n\nHarmon and his band don't wear their influences on their sleeves, but they're subtly evident throughout. The undulating bassline, piano/harmonica interplay (along with Bob Corritore's Cotton-esque harp solo), and lurching cadence of Honey Pleeze recall Muddy Waters' 1981 version of King Bee; Dan Ferguson's burbling keyboard line in Smoke and Mirrors sounds based on Stevie Wonder's Superstition; Sunday Morning After Saturday Night swings with unforced hipness that invokes Latimore's classic 1973 take on Stormy Monday (which itself arose in the wake of Lou Rawls and Les McCain's early 60's version).\n\nAs noted, Zac Harmon isn't the world's most expressive vocalist, and when the occasion calls for grit, anguish, or erotic intensity, he can sometimes sound strained or out of his element. Nonetheless, on a purely musical basis, he and his studio crew here deliver a tasteful, soulful, and winningly diverse set of contemporary blues and blues-based offerings.\n\nBluesBytes\n\nby Graham Clarke\n\nDecember 2019\n\nMississippian blues singer and guitarist Zac Harmon brings it all back home with his latest release, and first for Catfood Records, Mississippi BarBQ. At first glance, the marriage between Harmon and Bob Tranchard’s label would be a heaven-made one, and upon further viewing it certainly proves to be. Harmon has always been most adept at blending contemporary blues with soul blues and he’s certainly in his element here, collaborating with Trenchard and others on eight dynamite originals, with contributions from other gifted songwriters on three other tracks.\n\nHarmon is backed by Trenchard (bass) and the Catfood House Band --- the Rays (Richy Puga – drums, Johnny McGhee – guitar, Dan Ferguson – keys, Mike Middleton – trumpet, Andy Roman – alto sax, Nick Flood – tenor/baritone sax, and Drake Dominigue – trombone/tuba) --- on the 11 tracks, which touch on blues, soul, funk, and R&B. “Gypsy Road,” the catchy opener, touches on rock and funk, and the horn-fueled soul-blues burner “So Cold” would be a good fit on the radio.\n\nMeanwhile, “Smoke and Mirrors” ventures into blues-rock territory with a funky backdrop, and the delightful “Mississippi BarBQ” is a gentle, laidback R&B/soul confection that captures perfectly the feel of a downhome family BarBQ, down to the smell of ribs and chicken on the grill.\n\nHarmon narrates a story of a brief encounter on the contemporary blues tale, “Desperate Love,” gets down and dirty with guest harmonica master Bob Corritore on the rollicking “Honey Pleez,” and gets funky with “A Dollar Out of 15 Cents” (the latter two tracks with backing from his own band --- Corey Carmichael – keys, Chris Gipson – bass, Ralph Forrest – drums, and Texas Slim – rhythm guitar). “Sunday Morning After Saturday Night” is a smooth urban blues track with Texas Slim adding B.B.-esque guitar work.\n\nOn “Lord Save Me From L.A.,” Harmon tells the tale of a recent arrival to the City of Angels, who laments being thrown into the crush of people, technology, and the relentless fast pace of the city. Though not written by Harmon, it sounds a bit autobiographical. “Since You Been Gone” is a mid-tempo R&B track that finds Harmon backed by his regular band and backing vocalists Janelle Thompson, Shakara Weston, and SueAnn Carwell, who, along with Carmichael, provide splendid backing throughout. The album closes with a cover of Bob Dylan’s “Knocking On Heaven’s Door,” an outstanding version of the oft-covered classic that gives it a gospel/soul feel.\n\nMississippi BarBQ is an excellent kickoff for Zac Harmon on the Catfood Records label. Hopefully, it is just the beginning of a beautiful relationship that will last a long time.\n\nBlues Magazine (Netherlands - Translated by Google)\n\nby Peter Marinus\n\nJuly 2019\n\nIf you become interested in the blues as a young person, chances are that you will be totally devastated by it. That happened to singer-guitarist Zac Harmon from Jackson, Mississippi. At the age of 16 he was already part of the band of Sam Myers and later also in the bands of Dorothy Moore and ZZ Hill. Zac was even approached by Michael Jackson to become a \"staff writer\" for his ATV Music and also wrote songs for soul artists such as The O'Jays, The Whispers and Karyn White. A very versatile artist, who has now released his seventh album.\n\nAnd it is not surprising that it is full of soulful blues. Blues that may be parked in the Robert Cray / Joe Louis Walker department.\n\nA good example is the opening track, Gypsy Road . A song with a very pleasant warm groove and corrosive guitar work. So Cold is more on the soul side. Melodic a la Al Green or ZZ Hill with yet more corrosive guitar work and warm wind instruments.\n\nSmoke And Mirrors has the same drive as \"Standing On Shakey Ground\" and might just catch on with Delbert McClinton fans. Mississippi BarBQ sounds very relaxed. Soulblues a la Bobby Bland's \"Members Only\". This song sounds like a barbecue, where the participants are already bulging before only one bite is eaten.\n\nAfter that, the spirited-banging soul blues from Desperate Love used with excellent flaming guitar work. It keeps swinging with the pumping blues shuffle Honey Pleez with a leading role for the rolling piano by Dan Ferguson.\n\nA funky clavinet opens Make A Dollar Out Of Fifteen Cents , a boldly functioning song with a lot of influences from Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson's repertoire. Sunday Morning After Saturday Night is a languid shuffling, somewhat jazzy, shuffle in which the hard-biting Albert Collins-like guitar playing is central.\n\nAfter the lazy funky soul blues of Lord Save Me From LA , the light-hearted soul song Since You Been Gone soundsa little too polished for me. A song that belongs more to a \"neat\" soul formation like The Whispers, despite the great powerful bluesy guitar work.\n\nZac's version of the Bob Dylan classic Knocking On Heaven's Door sounds bluer than the original but at the same time a bit superfluous.\n\nThis seventh album from Zac Harmon is full of very pleasant soul blues and is definitely recommended for fans of that genre!\n\nAfter composing some blues for a movie score Harmon recorded his first blues album, “Live at Babe & Ricky’s Inn”, and introduced himself as a torchbearer for future generations. Zac Harmon and the Mid-South Revue took first place in the band competition at the 2004 International Blues Challenge. In 2005 Harmon released “The Blues According To Zacariah” and won the Blues Music Award for “Best New Artist Debut”. As an actor Harmon starred in the independent feature film “Black and Blue” in 2010. He released his last album “Right Man Right Now” in 2016 on Blind Pig Records.\n\n“Mississippi BarBQ” is Harmon’s seventh album overall and first for Catfood Records. The album is produced by Jim Gaines and recorded at the Sonic Ranch Studios, in Tornillo, Texas; thirty miles east of El Paso International Airport. Eight of the eleven songs were written or co-written by Harmon, five with Catfood Records owner and Executive Producer Bob Trenchard.\n\nHarmon, is both vocalist and lead guitarist on all tracks, recorded with two completely different bands; Trenchard’s “Rays” (formerly known as Kay, Kay and The Rays) on seven tracks, and The Zac Harmon Band on four. The Rays include bassist Trenchard, Richie Puga, drums; Johnny McGhee, guitar; Dan Ferguson, keyboards; and the horn section of trumpeter Mike Middleton, alto saxophonist Andy Roman, tenor and baritone saxophonist Nick Flood, and Drake Dominigue, trombone and tuba. The horn arrangements are by Rudy Torres.\n\n“How’d you get So Cold” is the first of five tunes from the songwriting team of Harmon and Trenchard with some fine guitar from Harmon. The funky “Smoke and Mirrors” features the background singers Janelle Thompson, Shakara Weston, and SueAnn Carwell. The background singers are featured again on the fabulous title track, a soon to be Southern Soul classic, with Corey Carmichael on keyboards. “Desperate Love” is another well produced track with the horns and the background singers, and another nice solo from Harmon. The fifth song from them is “Sunday Morning After Saturday Night”.\n\nLinda “Kay Kay” Greenwade passed in 2012 one of her songs “Lord Save Me From L.A.” is reprised here, co-written with Trenchard, it also appears on Catfood Records “The Best of Kay Kay and The Rays”. “Son you gotta’ go down, down, down, down that Gypsy Road”, is from Trey Hardin and Sandy Carroll.\n\nFour more songs are performed with Harmon’s regular touring band, included are keyboardist Carmichael and the rhythm section of Chris Gipson, bass; and Ralph Forrest, drums. Harmon’s “Honey Pleez” features Bob Corritore on harmonica. “Make A Dollar Out of 15 Cents” is from Harmon and co-writer John Hahn. The lone cover is an outstanding version of the Bob Dylan classic “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door”.\n\nHarmon states “For the first time in my career, I have had the opportunity to just be the best artist I can be at the guidance of a master producer…I got a chance to work with The Rays, which is a group of studio musicians headed up by Bob Trenchard. The Rays are incredible, and they bring the best out of every song. I also got a chance to collaborate in the writing with Trenchard…my favorite is the title song “Mississippi BarBQ” …my other favorite is “A Dollar Out of 15 Cents” which I wrote with John Hahn.”\n\nHarmon has surrounded himself with the best in the business resulting in this truly great recording. Vocally he sounds more relaxed than ever before. This is an award winning effort.\n\nby Brenda Nelson-Strauss\n\nAugust 2019\n\nA native of Jackson, Mississippi, Zac Harmon knows barbecue like he knows the blues: intimately! No wonder the award-winning blues singer and guitarist has chosen to celebrate grill season in the South on his latest album, Mississippi BarBQ. Like many young folk, Harmon was beckoned by the bright lights of Tinseltown and spent many years in L.A. as a studio musician, songwriter and producer—including a stint at Michael Jackson’s publishing company, ATV Music. After writing songs for R&B artists such as The Whispers, The O’Jays, and Karyn White, Harmon decided to return to his roots and released his first blues album in 2003. What is immediately apparent on his latest effort are the dual strands of his musical influences, or in more colloquial terms, the soul seeps into his blues like barbecue sauce into pork.\n\nThe title track brings local culture to life as everyone from the “cousins to the Johnson twins” are invited to come on over for “chicken and ribs on the grill, two kinds of pie on the windowsill, pickles and onions and collard greens, corn bread and a big pot of beans.” There are two additional tracks that seem to speak to Harmon’s lived experience: the funky “Make a Dollar Out of Fifteen Cents” and the pleading strains of “Lord Save Me From L.A.” to which Harmon promises, “I’ll never go astray.” Other songs hew more closely to blues rock such as the opener “Gypsy Road” and “Smoke and Mirrors,” both highlighting Harmon’s prowess on vocals and lead guitar. On the track “Desperate Love” the horns come out to play, while on “Sunday Morning After Saturday Night” organ riffs remind sinners they are in the house of the Lord, which all goes up in flames as special guest Texas Slim leaps in with a blazing guitar solo. The album closes with a heartfelt rendition of the Bob Dylan classic, “Knocking on Heaven’s Door,” and a spoken dedication to “all of our country’s service people.”\n\nMississippi BarBQ offers a variety of musical styles and messages, ranging from lighthearted celebratory songs to the blues of love gone cold, with a few life lessons for good measure. Top that off with an excellent crew of musicians, including The Rays and the Zac Harmon Band, and you have a recipe that brings the heat to a whole new level.\n\nKeys and Chords (Netherlands - translated by Google)\n\nby Philip Verhaege\n\nAugust 2019\n\nThe release 'Mississippi BarBQ' is the debut album of singer, guitarist and songwriter Zac Harmon for the label Catfood Records. Zac Harmon grew up in Jackson, Mississippi. His mother played the piano while his father, the first city-registered black pharmacist, played harmonica and took care of the needs of artists such as Muddy Waters, BB King, Ike and Tina Turner, Albert King and Little Milton when they were around. Zac started his professional career at the age of 16 and played the guitar with Sam Myers, a friend of his father's. Two years later he played with Dorothy Moore, ZZ Hill and other famous blues artists who were in transit with their regional tours. In the early eighties, at the age of 21, he moved to LA and went through life as a studio musician, writer and producer. He first worked as a studio musician and finally achieved a very successful career as a songwriter and producer. Zac has worked on major films, TV shows and well-known national commercials. At a certain point, he was even hired by Michael Jackson as a staff writer for his publishing house, ATV Music. Harmon wrote songs for Troop, Karyn White, Evelyn 'Champagne' King, Freddie Jackson, The Whispers and The O'Jays, among others. He also produced songs for the Mystical Truth album by the reggae band Black Uhuru, which received a Grammy nomination in 1994.\n\nNow he has settled in Dallas, Texas. His solo career went steadily and in 2003 was 'Live at Babe & Ricky's Inn', an exciting testimony to his Mississippi blues. His next release was in 2005 with 'The Blues According to Zacariah'. In 2006 he won the coveted Blues Music Award as \"Best New Artist Debut\". In 2008 he released 'Shot In The Kill Zone' in Europe, which was recorded live in the Lionel Hampton Room in Paris. He then signed with the Northern Blues label for his third and highly anticipated American album 'From The Root', which was released in April 2009. Zac was also successful with the record 'Music Is Medicine' from 2012 and 'Right Man Right Now' from 2016.\n\nNow there is 'Mississippi BarBQ'. Zac (guitar, vocals) found backing in the eight-piece studio rhythm section, The Rays, with Bob Trenchard (bass), drummer Richy Puga, Johnny McGhee (guitar), Dan Ferguson (keys), Mike Middleton (trumpet), Andy Roman (alto sax) ), Nick Flood (tenor and baritone sax) and Drake Dominigue with his trombone and tuba. Besides all these musicians there is also his great touring band, with Chris Gipson (bass), Ralph Forrest (drums), Texas Slim (guitar) and keyboard player Corey Carmichael. The ten songs were produced by Grammy winner Jim Gaines (Santana, Steve Ray Vaughan and Journey) and recorded at the Sonic Ranch in Tornillo, Texas. The soulful 'Gypsy Road' immediately kicks in an open door. Zac's sultry soul voice almost immediately agrees with some handsome guitar riffs. The keyboard intro from 'So Cold' immediately gives the track a funky swing. And that also supports the deep guitar groove from 'Smoke and Mirrors'. The soul blues ballad 'Mississippi BarBQ' is in pleasant contrast. The swinging soul chapiter 'Desperate Love' has been colored by an exciting wind section. Just like the piano boogie 'Honey Pleez' and the funky nailing 'Make A Dollar Out Of Fifteen Cents', which reminds us strongly of Johnny Guitar Watson. The song 'Sunday Morning After Saturday Night' is enthralled with BB King guitar licks. And then Zac starts to sound funky in the autobiographical 'Lord Save Me From LA' and the soul-inspired 'Since You Been Gone'. Bob Dylan's classic 'Knocking On Heaven's Door' is the only cover. Besides Dylan's version, perhaps the best cover version ever! Beautiful ...!\n\nZac Harmon brings his blues sound to another level. Soul enthusiastic songs nail very easily between some funky songs. There are no superlatives enough for this great sound. Album of the year 2019? It will certainly not be far off. Highly recommended!\n\nRock and Blues Muse with Maritine Ehrenclou\n\nby Mike O'Cull\n\nJuly 2019\n\nAward-winning blues vocalist and guitarist Zac Harmon recently became part of the Catfood Records family and his debut effort, Mississippi Bar BQ on the El Paso, Texas-based label, comes out July 19th, 2019. Produced by Grammy-winner Jim Gaines (Santana, Steve Ray Vaughan) Mississippi Bar BQ gives the world ten new original songs and a killer cover of Bob Dylan’s “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door.” The record is the most progressive release of Harmon’s career and he revels in the opportunity to take his Bobby “Blue” Bland-meets-Freddie King style anywhere he wants go under the watchful ears of a master producer.\n\nBorn and raised in Jackson, Mississippi, Zac Harmon is a true descendant of the music that poured out of the city’s historic Farish Street district, home of blues legend Elmore James. He started his professional career at age 16, playing guitar with Sam Myers, a friend of his father. A short two years later, he was playing with Dorothy Moore, Z.Z. Hill, and other well-known blues artists. He has since gone on to have a long and illustrious life in the blues, and Mississippi Bar BQ is the beginning of an exciting new chapter in his story.\n\nHarmon works with two distinct bands on these sessions and both outfits put down admirable performances. Seven tracks were cut with The Rays, an extra-solid bunch of studio veterans who fit Harmon’s songs like a second skin. The other four cuts were done with Harmon’s top-flight road band, who also know how to do it right when the red light comes on. This blended effort resulted in a supremely listenable record that showcases every bit of Harmon’s talent and remains captivating from beginning to end.\n\n“Gypsy Road” opens the album with a mid-speed funk/rock vibe that’s instantly alluring. Zac lays down some extremely toneful guitar parts throughout the main groove and then demonstrates his deft lead phrasing during a solo bridge. His voice is warm, expressive, and smooth, with an uptown quality that allows him to stand apart from more rough-hewn blues singers. “Smoke and Mirrors” takes the funk deeper and tells the all-too-common tale of love gone wrong. Dan Ferguson of The Rays turns in a shark-toothed clavinet groove on this one that really propels the pocket while Harmon laments that “It wasn’t love, just a hustler’s con.” If this doesn’t make you dance, nothing will.\n\nThe title track, “Mississippi Bar BQ,” is the kind of soulful R&B song most artists write about love gone right but Harmon uses these lush chords to sing about food, fun, family, and friends. It’s a feel-good song that’s right on target for Summer partying and makes the idea of ribs, beers, and blues at Zac’s place sound like one heck of a good time. Harmon puts down some mellow and melodic lead guitar that goes well with the mood of the moment and makes all seem right with the world.\n\nHarmon’s take on “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” is heavily gospel and R&B-influenced and he breathes much freshness into a song that so many others have sung before him. He ups the intensity in the middle with some energetic blues/rock soloing and ample support from his Zac Harmon Band. Harmon finds something new in this familiar song and it’s one of his best moments on the entire set.\n\nMississippi Bar BQ is a mighty first release on his new label and Harmon sounds ready and able to keep reaching for these type of heights. The writing, playing, and singing here all happen at a high level and Harmon sounds like he has another dozen albums of music inside him ready to burst out. If you’re not already hip to him, you should be. You will absolutely love this record!\n\nReflections In Blue\n\nby Bill Wilson\n\nAugust 2019\n\nZac Harmon lays out a great spread for his Mississippi BarBQ. While many bands are essentially “meat and potatoes,” Harmon delivers all that…with all the trimmings. This is a full-blown soul/blues extravaganza. The album enlists the talents two bands, Bob Trenchard’s “Rays” and Zac’s touring band. While the two units bring different strengths to the table, Harmon’s soulful guitar style and vocals bring it together beautifully. I generally approach this type of album with extreme caution. All too often the recordings are overproduced; making for a sound that is far too homogenized. Thank God for the talents and ears of Jim Gaines, who did an incredible job here. Eight of the eleven tunes on the album were written or co-written by Harmon. Both the Rays & Harmon’s touring band are in top form. A full horn section and angelic background vocals give this one a tone that will sit well with young and old alike. The title track has been at number one on the Soul Blues chart for the past five weeks. I am not at all surprised. This album is funky, soulful and one of those things that could be put in the player and set to play for the day. I left this CD hungering not only for more music but for a plate of ribs and collards. As an added bonus, a recipe for BarBQ ribs is included as a part of the package. This one might just be worth the price for the recipe alone. I’d say this one’s a keeper.\n\nSoundGuardian (from Croatia translated by Google)\n\nby Mladen Lončar - Mike\n\nJuly 2019\n\nWith truly unquenchable joy I've been writing a text related to the inaugural album \"Mississippi BarBQ\" for Catfood Records. The owner of this album is the famous blues musician Zac Harmon. Exclusively thanks to Blind Raccoon, the Blues Corner Music Web Portal, SoundGuardian has the exclusive opportunity to present this great project of the great Zac Harmon.\n\n\"Mississippi BarBQ\" was produced by Jim Gaines, who received Grammy for his work with Stevie Ray Vaughan, Santana and Journey. While Zac is supporting the eight-band, \"background\" is made by The Rays and his \"touring\" band with which he plays four songs. It can be reliably confirmed that this is his most extensive, best-in-class study done so far.\n\nHe grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, Zac, as a teenager, performing with blues artists such as ZZ Hill, Sam Myers and Dorothy Moore, before moving to LA where he really devotes his career to a studio musician, composer and producer. Today, Zac lives in Dallas, and for several years now lives and works as a solo artist with great and visited international tours in Europe, Africa, Iraq and even performing at the \"Great Pyramids\". Zac Harmon was named one of the ten artists that \"Blues Revue\" represents as the future of blues.\n\n“Mississippi BarBQ” is not a typical blues album, it's actually an eclectic blend of soul, funk and blues with an electric guitar with well-written poems by Zac and composers who wrote for Johnny Rawls, Otis Clay and Shemekia Copeland. Accordingly, the offered and recorded content is actually a strong confirmation of his extreme quality and musical ingenuity.\n\nThrough the album, there is a flash of soul-colored vocals, incredible artwork in guitar play, a solid and definite \"sound,\" which further outlines each song in particular, and of course, there are also fantastic accompanying musicians. All in all this is a winning formula and, of course, the result could not be missed, just the opposite! And this is confirmed by the following statement:\n\n\"Harman's stage show is like a blues symphony.\" - Blues Bytes\n\nThe album offers us ten author tracks and Zac's Dylan's \"Knockin 'on Heaven's Door.\" In most of the songs we are listening to Zac’s accompanied by The Rays: Bob Trenchard (bass), Richy Puga (drums), Johnny McGhee (guitar), Dan Ferguson (keyboards), Mike Middleton (trumpet), Andy Roman (alt saxophone), Nick Flood tenor and baritone saxophone) and Drake Dominigue (trombone and tubes). On several other tracks, Zac follows his already mentioned accompanying \"touring\" band. There is no doubt that from about 2003 until now Zac Harmon has been heading for the lead, he is baptized for \"the next generation of blues musicians, but also the musical style itself. Believe it is not without any connection, because Zac and his musicians associate their music with a lot of energy, with a strong sense of blues presentation. The compositions combine the sensuous and powerful vocals of Zac Harmon with a pulsating instrumentalist background. Therefore, and in the future, this winning combination or formula should not be ignored, anyway! It should be well received and remembered.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n\nFor this musician, Lucky Peterson said, \"Zac Harmon is pure blues power that hits ya in your soul.\"\n\nThe fact is that from the song in the song Zac and the band change the styles, the atmosphere, the rhythm so that at one point we are not bored. Anyway, 48 minutes shuts in a moment and when it comes to the end, we just go from scratch.\n\nAfter all, I think that Zac Harmon's whole story is still overwhelming, as the album \"Mississippi BarBQ\" carries an emphasized positive charge and there is an inevitable optimism that is so much needed for everyone.\n\nIn the end, Zac and the society about their future do not have to be afraid, such albums will open each door. So do not worry about buying this album anyway. Zac Harmon will have fun having fun, filling you with a free night or you will be spending your days enjoying your own album. And so once more without fear, enjoy it! Personally, I already do this for weeks.\n\nPBS 106.7 Melbourne, Australia\n\nJuly 2019\n\nby Peter Merrett\n\nI have to say when l saw that Zac Harmon was releasing a new album \"Mississippi BarBQ\" l was extremely excited. Then l received my copy and found myself somewhat intrigued as to how it was going to sound with the combination of The Rays on seven tracks and The Zac Harmon Band on the remaining four tracks. Both bands in themselves are different and as such give a very different feel to Harmon's work. This is not a bad thing but rather a perplexing mystery that would reveal all the moment l pressed play! I don't think l had any preconceived ideas but rather an open mind and man l was rewarded time and time again with each track. By having the two different bands the light and shade of the mix and the obvious style changes were deliciously tangible.\n\nDo l like this album? Simple answer to that is \"hell yeah l do\"! Do l think you will love it? \"Hell yeah I do\"! Don't hesitate in getting your copy as this is the album you need in your collection right now. Any delay will have you unable to sleep at night until you do.\n\nRead the full review HERE\n\nBlues Blast\n\nby Mark Thompson\n\nNovember 2019\n\nBorn and raised in Mississippi, Zac Harmon got an early start on his music career when he played guitar for singer and noted harp blower Sam Myers. That lead to more work with touring blues and R&B artists including Dorothy Moore and Z.Z. Hill. But eventually Harmon fell under the spell of the bright lights, big city, leading to a move to Los Angeles, where he wrote songs for a variety of artists as well as working on films and television shows. At one point, he was a staff writer for Michael Jackson’s team. He received a Grammy nomination for his writing and production with the reggae band Black Uhuru.\n\nAfter the turn of the century, Harmon felt his roots calling him home, so he made the decision to play blues music. That move paid immediate dividends when he was named the top blues band at the 2004 International Blues Challenge, the annual event in Memphis sponsored by the Blues Foundation. More recognition came when his 2005 release, The Blues For Zacariah, won the Blues Music Award in the Best New Artist Debut category.\n\nOn his seventh release, Harmon showcases all of the aspects of his artistry. His songwriting is featured with two originals and another five co-written with Executive Producer and label owner Bob Trenchard. You know that the music will sound fine with noted producer Jim Gaines behind the recording console. Seven tracks feature the Catfood house band, the Rays, featuring Trenchard on bass, Richy Puga on drums, Johnny McGhee on guitar, Dan Ferguson on keyboards, Mike Middleton on trumpet, Andy Roman on alto saxophone, Nick Flood on tenor and baritone sax, and Drake Dominigue on trombone and tuba. Harmon’s own band appears on four tracks, with Corey Carmichael on keyboards, Chris Gipson an bass, Ralph Forrest on drums, and Texas Slim on rhythm guitar. Harmon handles the lead vocals and guitar parts throughout the disc.\n\nThe opening number, “Gypsy Road,” finds Harmon”s strong voice soaring over the Rays’ solid rhythm, with the leader’s searing guitar work making a lasting impression. The horns are prominently featured on “So Cold,” as Harmon bares his soul over a dying relationship. The mood isn’t much better on “Smoke And Mirrors,” a funky elegy to a trickster femme fatale with more tightly drawn guitar work. On “Make A Dollar Out Of Fifteen Cents,” Harmon and his band establish a groove reminiscent of the later stages of Johnny “Guitar” Watson’s career on a song that finds Harmon strapped for cash, stating “I was so hungry, I’d fight a dog for a bone”.\n\nThe title cut flows along like a cool summer breeze with visions of friends gathering for BBQ chicken, ribs, collard greens, and cold beer. Harmon adds another righteous guitar interlude while getting vocal support from Janelle Thompson, Shakara Weston, SueAnn Carwell, and Carmichael. “Sunday Morning After Saturday Night” is a tight shuffle with Texas Slim’s biting guitar answered by blasts from the horns. Another highlight is the tale of a brief entanglement told on “Desperate Love,” once again told by Harmon in convincing fashion. Carmichael’s rolling piano licks spark “Honey Pleez,” another straight-ahead blues with guest Bob Corritore blowing a brief harp solo. Harmon provides a unflinching recounting of his past on “Lord Save Me From LA,” a song that won’t win the hearts of folks at the local Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\nOne of Harmon’s originals, “Since You Been Gone,” finds him doing fine after a break-up, unwilling to consider reviving the love affair. Munyungo Jackson adds additional percussion to the track, one of four cuts he appears on. The disc ends with a cover of Bob Dylan’s oft-covered “Knocking On Heaven’s Door”. Harmon leads with a biting guitar intro, then gives an uplifting vocal turn that pushes his voice to the edge before ending with a beautifully crafted guitar solo.\n\nAs good as Harmon’s previous releases were, this one just might be the best yet. If you haven’t heard him before, grab a copy and become of a fan. A fine release from start to finish!"
