Lee has worked himself into the upper echelons of first-rate Blues entertainers through years of perseverance and sincerity, but mainly, sincerity. This latest CD is among his best and contains the elements that have that endeared him to audiences: instant-party songs, expert guitar work, soulful vocals, and Lees rhythmic, vocal calls directing and encouraging the band (even in the studio).\n\nBlind since age 8 and originally from Wisconsin, 62 year old Bryan Lee had made his career playing Blues nightly in New Orleans for 20 plus years. Like so many musicians playing in a city dedicated to music, Bryan was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Lifes test is to move on, and Bryan has done that very successfully. He has an approaching marriage, this sixth studio recording, and he teamed with protégé Kenny Wayne Shepherd on the hit song, Tina Marie, for Shepherds CD and DVD, 10 Days Out. Bryan then made an appearance on Jay Lenos Tonight Show with Kenny Wayne and Hubert Sumlin. You can see the video of his Leno appearance at www.braillebluesdaddy.com\n\nFor this album, Bryan kept road partners: guitar ace Brent Johnson and drummer John Perkins. Producer Duke Robillard brought to the studio Bruce Katz on keyboards, bassists Marty Ballou, Jim Mitchell, and John Packer, and Sax Gordon Beadle and Doug James on saxophones. Robillard also brings a touch of Swing to numbers like Willie Dixons 29 Ways and Chick Willis Take It Like A Man.\n\nMostly, though, the CD parties-on with rocking numbers like Robert Parkers Barefootin, Flat Foot Sam, and Kim Wilsons Dont Bite The Hand That Feeds You. The hottest track is Luther Allisons Lowdown and Dirty which features Brent Johnson on slide guitar. The deepest blues are found in the slower, extended workout of Jimmy Witherspoons Aint Nobodys Business.\n\nBryans four original contributions include the title track as emotionally devastating as Katrina was physically. There are also Bryans tribute to his new love, Bethany Jane and the song Blues Singer in which Lee reveals some early personal history in the blues genre.\n\nThank the stars that after the Louisianas hurricanes are gone, there is still national treasure Bryan Lee!\n\nTo purchase this CD CLICK HERE\n\nClick HERE for More reviews and interviews\n\nChicago Blues Update\n\nLive Blues reviews by Chicago Blues editor Lordy\n\nBlues Beat: Chicago, Saturday August 18, 2007 (Photos by August Lord)\n\nThe Chicago Kingsnakes w/ Deb Seitz at Harlem Avenue Lounge\n\nI have probably seen the Chicago Kingsnakes more than any other Chicago area blues band.\n\nThat is by design, not assignment. After all, this is not a job for me. I am not a critic, nor am I a photographer. I am a blues fan with a camera.\n\nThe king snake here is Jim Ang Anderson. He hails from Blue Island (Chicago South) and has named one of their CDs Blues Island. For all the times I have seen Ang play, he has only played a Telecaster. Unlike Albert Collins, he doesnt use a capo, and has a rounder tone, and a nice vibrato, but is capable of stinging the strings as well. I dont think I ever see him with stomp boxes either. On my circuit, Ang is the Telemaster.\n\nIt has been fun to see this band develop over the years. The addition of harp man Nelson Keaton several years back brought a new dimension to the Kingsnakes. Another talent the band has developed is evident on the song My Babe. Ang plays this one sans plectrum, and you can hear call and response in four part harmony. The three voices helping Ang out are Gus Gotsis on drums, Ron Berry on bass and Nelson. The first lady of Chicago Blues,\n\nDeb Seitz frequently joins the Kingsnakes as she did on this night (my lucky night). The first time I ever saw (I mean heard) Deb was sitting in with Ang and crew, and I have been a groupie ever since. Deb is from a place just Northwest of Chicago known as Montana. She is a songwriter and bandleader in her own right, and delivers a Joplinesque vocal except with better range.\n\nWithin the next few weeks of this gig, The Kingsnakes would back Deb Seitz up for a festival gig in Indiana, and Deb would return the favor by beautifying the Kingsnakes gig at The Slippery Noodle in Indy.\n\nCLICK HERE to visit Lordy's website at ChicagoBluesBeat.com\n\nTo see a Chicago Area list of upcoming events CLICK HERE\n\nIf you know of a Chicago Blues event or news, please send it to\n\nFeatured Blues Advertisers\n\nBlues Society News\n\nThe Blues Blowtorch Society FREE Membership Thank You Event\n\nBryan Lee, a New Orleans Blues Institution will perform Thursday September 20, 2007 at the NV Ultra Lounge 107 E Beaufort St, Normal, IL 61761 309-454-9357 from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM\n\nAll members of The Blues Blowtorch Society are invited and will be admitted FREE OF CHARGE in thanks for all the support shown at our events.

While this writer was able to see the live show right from the open Blues Blast, anyone who used either Yahoo mail or Hotmail only saw a link to click which would allow them to hear the event live. We did say it was an experiment!
