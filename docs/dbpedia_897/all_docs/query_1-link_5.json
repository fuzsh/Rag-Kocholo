I'm playing the Windy City Blues Society stage on the festival grounds on Saturday the 12th from 2:45 to 3:45. (I'll be in one-man-band guise in both venues.) I'm planning on driving over to Rosa's to check out Sugar Blue's show (and ask Sugar to come to Hill Country Harmonica 2011) on Friday evening.\n\nSugar and Billy Branch will both be playing Chi Blues Fest this year, as will my Mississippi friends Bill \"Howl-N-Madd\" Perry and Terry \"Harmonica\" Bean.
