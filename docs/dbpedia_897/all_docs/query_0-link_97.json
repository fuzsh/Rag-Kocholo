        "text": "Big Walter Horton was one of the greatest harmonica stylists of all time, and a true master of Chicago blues. He possessed an unbelievable sound that stood out above all other players, that incorporated a chilling vibrato, combined with swooping phrases and a bell-like tonality. Though a fine singer, his role on many recordings was that of an accompanist. Many of the recordings that included his harmonica are true classics, such as Jimmy Rogers’ Walkin’ By Myself, Muddy Waters’ She’s All Right, Johnny Shines’ Evening Sun, and Tommy Brown’s Southern Woman. Growing up in Chicago, Bob was blessed to know Big Walter Horton and to see hundreds of his performances. Please enjoy this collection of rare photos of a true champion of blues harmonica.\n\nBig Walter Horton Performing at Free Trade Hall in Manchester for the 3rd American Folk Blues Festival – 1964 (Photo by Brian Smith)\n\nL-R: Mississippi Fred McDowell, John Lee Hooker, Doctor Ross, J.B.
