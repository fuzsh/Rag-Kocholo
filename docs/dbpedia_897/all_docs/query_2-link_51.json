        "text": "A Bromley Blues Club production\n\nThe Bromley Blues Club present the very best of Chicago Blues, direct from the USA.\n\nJimi ‘Prime Time’ Smith was born in Chicago in 1959. His mother worked alongside blues legend Jimmy Reed, as his song writer, drummer and manager. Jimi began playing guitar at 12 under the teachings of Jimmy Reed, Hubert Sumlin and Eddie Taylor, and spent his teenage years playing with Big Walter Horton, Floyd Jones, Playboy Vinson, Sunnyland Slim, Jimmy Johnson, Queen Sylvia and other Chicagoland blues legends.\n\nOscar Wilson grew up on the south side of Chicago on 43rd Street in a six-room apartment split by two families. He is the highly acclaimed frontman of ‘The Cashbox Kings’, whose albums have showcased Oscar’s knack for powerful and humorous song-writing.\n\nBob Corritore would regularly see Howlin’ Wolf, Muddy Waters, Billy Boy Arnold, Sunnyland Slim and other blues legends in action. Corritore worked with Tail Dragger, Big Moose Walker, Willie Buck, Louis and Dave Myers in the late 70’s and early 80’s. He produced classic debut albums for harmonica greats such as Little Willie Anderson and Big Leon Brooks.\n\nAccompanying the Chicago Trio will be harmonica player Giles Robson, and UK Blues Awards Winner, Mississippi MacDonald."
