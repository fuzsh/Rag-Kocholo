        "text": "Rev. Freakchild — “Bare Bones” — Treated and Released Records\n\nThe most Reverend Freakchild opens his latest and 18th album, “Bare Bones,” by offering the philosophical track “All I Got Is Now,” with a lyric that sets the tone for the musical thoughts that follow – an exercise in bluesy Buddhism and other mystical delights:\n\n“Yesterdays are history / Tomorrows are a mystery / All I got is now / But I keep forgetting that somehow.”\n\nBut that’s just a fraction of the lyrical output on “Bare Bones,” all of which springs from the fertile Freakchild mind, which seems unceasingly occupied by erudite elucidations of the mysteries of life through music. The magical mystery tours of his lyrics easily flow from the delicate to the desolate, but never fail to fascinate.\n\nThe Rev has said that he’s a Buddhist, but considers music his religion. Both the blues and Buddhism, he says, can be seen as ways of confronting reality and the truth of human suffering: “I seek transcendence through song.” If you add that the blues is a healer, you might have just the right medicine for the hole in your soul.\n\nFor this “Bare Bones” transcendence, the Rev has reprised the nine tracks on his 2023 album, “Songs Of Beauty For Ashes Of Realization,” and pared back its more experimental musical vibe to a solo acoustic effort. The session was recorded live with no edits at the Chattanooga Public Library Studios, making it as close as possible to a musical stream of consciousness.\n\nFollowing the opening track, “Dial It In” takes us on the road, humming with song: “Gonna drive ’til I get lost and found again / Gonna turn on the radio and dial it in.” The Rev’s raspy vocals add a world-weary elegance here and everywhere, fueled by his sharp acoustic work, all nicely flavored with the blues.\n\nThe introspective “All Across America” asks: “Is that me in the mirror, oh lord, what have I become / Yes I do believe that’s the dude that I’ve been running from.” The shuffling whimsy of “Hippy Bluesman Blues” laments a bad Frisco trip: “There ain’t no problems only solutions / I think I’m gonna join the revolution / I got the Hippie Bluesman Blues.”\n\n“Amsterdam Blues” is twice reprised, having first appeared on the Rev’s 2001 debut album, “Blues & Spirituals.” He makes a spiritual journey for secular pleasures: “Just grooving there in Amsterdam, trying to get my senses satisfied / Sex and smoke everywhere, think you went to heaven and died.” The guitar work could easily just have arrived from the Delta.\n\n“Tears Of Fire” offers a melancholy message to rhythmic guitar: “She got words in her hand / Well it seems like she’s always got her tongue wrapped around the name of another man.” “Skyflower” is as delicate as its name: “Now I’m secretly sending magic mettā with my mind / The wind blows around the edges of the wise and the kind.”\n\nFor Freakchild fans and would-be aficionados, there’s a second album in this package, aptly titled “Odds, Ends & Interviews,” filled precisely with odds, ends and interviews that may help expand your awareness of the consciousness of the Reverend Freakchild.\n\nAnd by the way: Just who is the Reverend Freakchild? Just ask him:\n\n“When folks ask me if I’m a real reverend I often say that the Reverend Freakchild character is really a philosophical investigation of the American experience through the music of the blues and spirituals.”\n\nSay amen, somebody.\n\n“All I Got Is Now” from the album:\n\nCD 1 (The music)\n\n01.

Those greats have disappeared, leaving only the echoes of their soulful essence.\n\nBut there’s one soul stirrer whose voice still caresses a lyric like a lover should – Chicago’s Gerald McClendon. He’s a shamefully unheralded classic R&B stylist with a voice so smooth and a feeling so deep that he’s known as the soul keeper. And best of all, he’s got a new album to showcase his rich vocal style. Plus, it’s got very cool cover art.\n\nMcClendon’s latest, “Down at the Juke Joint,” on Delta Roots Records, overflows with throbbing old-school soul, songs created by songwriter, drummer and producer Twist Turner, and brought to life by the soul keeper’s passionate pipes. The dozen songs here offer a heartfelt selection of lover’s laments and smooth ballads meant for late nights filled with languorous glances and slow dancing.\n\nThe opener, “Back Where You Belong,” sets the mood with a sensual sax wrapped around remorsefully smooth vocals: “She didn’t leave a card or a letter, not even a see you later / Come on home, back where you belong.”\n\nThe regrets flow on with the tearful “It’s Too Late, She’s Gone” – “I tried to apologize, teardrops in my eyes / But it’s too late, too late, she’s gone”\n\nThe mood shifts with the upbeat “Down at the Juke Joint,” a rhythmic ode to good times: “You can come as you are, check your attitude at the bar / sit down and have a taste, don’t let the whiskey go to waste.” Then the mournful “House Ain’t a Home” opens the door to more love lost: “You see a house ain’t a home / When your baby pack up and gone.”\n\nOn the melodic “So Long,” McClendon smoothly turns the tables on a lover as he’s the one to say it’s over – “I can’t take it no more, think I’ll walk out the door / I said so long, baby I’m gone, so goodbye.” There’s a funky feeling to open “Talkin Smack,” with another strong vocal turn – “Tryin to play me, for a fool, you see / But your only foolin’ yourself, it don’t matter to me.”\n\n“Only Time Will Tell” is a gorgeous love song, built atop a towering vocal effort and subtle sax work: “Our love grows stronger, every day / deeper and deeper, in every way.” The whimsical “She’s Tryin’ to Drive Me Crazy” takes a lighthearted approach to an over-eager suitor: “Well she’s tryin’ to drive me crazy, but I just won’t give her the key.”\n\nIn the melancholy of “Cryin’ Time Again,” McClendon weaves a tapestry of despair: “Darkness is all around me, I wonder will I ever see the light.” Somehow the unspoken joy in his voice suggests that he will. As if to answer “Cryin’ Time,” the lilting lyricism of “You Make Me Happy” promises a love-filled life: “More precious than diamonds, shine just like gold / Our love grows stronger, it never grows old.”\n\nThe promise of undying love sparks “I’ll Be In Your Corner” with the vow that “I’m the one who’ll treat you right.” All of which leads into the closer, “You’re So Fine,” where he makes a poignant request: “if you’d only give me a chance, to make you smile to make you laugh.”\n\n“Down at the Juke Joint” is a soulful journey of deeply rich vocals and luxurious musical arrangements, all elegantly wrapped around the many shades of love by the soul keeper – Gerald McClendon. Sweet soul music, indeed.\n\n“Down at the Juke Joint” trailer video:\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Back Where You Belong (3:36)\n\n2. It’s Too Late, She’s Gone (4:49)\n\n3. Down At The Juke Joint (3:38)\n\n4.

That combination makes for a passionate package of modern blues firmly planted in its primal roots.\n\nThe 12-song session, co-produced by Cannon and Alligator president Bruce Iglauer, features a crackling crew of Cannon on guitars, vocals, and percussion; Brian Quinn on electric and upright bass; Cole DeGenova on keyboards and clavinet; Jason Edwards on drums; Phillip “Dante” Burgess, Jr. on drums on “Him” and “Had To Go Through It” and Matthew Skoller on harmonica on “My Woman Loves Me Too Much.”\n\nEverything kicks off with screaming guitar and tough vocals lamenting the sentiment of “Can’t Fix the World.” The scorching “I Hate Love” adds more ferocious guitar solos behind a painful lyric. “Him” shuffles funkily into view, dipping into relationship issues by a former rival.\n\n“Had to Go Through It to Get to It” describes racial barricades to success in a rousing bit of hand-clapping gospel. “Something to Do Man” rocks hard to describe a late-night call from a woman who knows him as her “something to do man” with something on her mind. “Message to My Daughter,” turns lyrically gentle with a promise to sstick with his daughter despite a broken home. “Unlovable” opens with high-quality blues licks acknowledged by Cannon, who uses the shuffling rhythms and gutty vocals to support his woman though hard times.\n\n“Guilty” is a lilting statement about the role of responsibility in life — “everybody knows they’re guilty; guilty for what they say and do.” The slyly salacious “Got Me by the Short Hairs” documents the perils of a one-night stand with a surprise twist at the end. Nothing says deep blues like a down-home, back-porch acoustic gem. With Cannon’s guitar, Quinn’s upright bass and Skoller’s elegant harp licks, “My Woman Loves Me Too Much” grins with sexy humor. Tasty keyboards lead into “If I’m Always Wrong,” with Cannon admonishing, “If I’m always wrong, then leave me alone.”\n\nThe musically psychedelic aura of the title track brings the album full circle from the philosophic opener, with Cannon’s biting response to the idea that he should forego activism and just “Shut Up and Play.”\n\nThis is how Cannon explains the personal nature of songs: “I write what I know, what I feel,” he says, “I like to put myself in the shoes of the subjects of my songs. This record is about the things going on in my life since 2019—it’s a document of what I’ve seen and been through, but the stories are universal. And it’s my way to get past negative things and keep my own sanity. Listen to the lyrics. I am a black man in America. These are NOT protest songs. I try to create honest, common-sense understanding with my songs.”\n\nAnd the music that accompanies that honest, common-sense understanding is pretty darn good, too.\n\n“Can’t Fix the World”\n\n1.

Being a native Pittsburgher myself (it was New Jersey native Price’s adopted hometown), I’ve had the good fortune to know him and listen to his soulful music for much of the half-century-plus that he’s been a Pittsburgh institution.\n\nI’ve seen him perform with the Keystone Rhythm Band, the Billy Price Band, and in small groups with just a keyboard or combo behind him. I’ve seen how he packed venues around Pittsburgh with appreciative fans. I’ve watched him perform tough, rocking shows with the Nighthawks. I’ve enjoyed seeing him joyously paired with his greatest musical influence, legendary soul man Otis Clay. I remember when he had hair!\n\nIn addition to his performing, Price is a knowledgeable fan and articulate advocate for the music he loves, with its deep, wide roots in American music. He has always paid tribute to those roots by performing and recording covers of songs by his favorite — always soulful — artists.\n\nWhat makes “Person of Interest” more interesting, besides all the great music, is that: “This is the first time I tried to do an album with exclusively my own material, and I think it holds up very well.” Very well, indeed. This West Coast session with a group of crackling bandmates shows off Price’s still vigorous pipes that have ripened with age (he’s 74), displaying a smooth depth and richness.\n\nThe album opens in a funky vein with “Inside the Box” punctuated by a horn section that stomps relentlessly through the session. “Song I Never Heard Before” has an upbeat R&B flair with a lyric that pleads for music that does more than revisit its own past. “She Checks All the Boxes” is full-throated praise for a woman who, yes, checks all the boxes for a meaningful relationship.\n\nThe slow-burning “Mercy” is an emotional highlight, a throwback to an ’80s Price song that never made it past live shows onto an album, with its testifying vocals and passionate tenor solo by Eric Spaulding, a member of Price’s regular band. The title track follows, a funky soul/blues take on that crime-show phrase turned into a watchful eye on a cheating lover.\n\n“Can’t Get Enough” is another pulsating dance track with an obvious theme: “I can’t get enough of my woman, she’s a hungry man’s dream.” Guitarist Joe Bonamassa guests on “Change Your Mind,” a tribute to Roy Buchanan, with whom Price recorded in the 1970s. Bonamassa captures the flavor of Buchanan’s stinging guitar style on this dramatice rendering.\n\n“They Knew” is a sturdy vintage Price song, reworked for this album, “A Certain Something” has an easy-going Latin feel. “The Gift” is a smoothly turned-out soul-blues ballad about a painful financial relationship, with a striking guitar solo by Shane Theriot: “I’m the gift that keeps on giving but all you ever do is take.”\n\n“Crying at the Stoplight” romps through Price’s musings about why a woman in the car next to his at a stoplight appeared to be so unhappy. “I Lose It (When I’m In Love)” is a gentle, rhythmic ballad – sweet soul music at its best. The strong closer adds punchy horns to a funkified “Damage Control” with Price stepping out on vocals and another sensuous sax solo from Spaulding.\n\nThe entire session benefits greatly from the expert musical cast assembled by Little Village. Musicians include: bass – Larry Fulcher, James Fulch and Reggie McBride, guitar – Josh Sklair and Shane Theriot, lead guitar – Joe Bonamassa, keyboards – Jim Pugh, drums – Tony Braunagel (who also produced), tenor and baritone sax – Ron Dziubla, tenor solo – Eric Spaulding, trumpet – Mark Pender and percussion – Lenny Castro. Background vocals are by Maxayn Lewis, Fred White and Will Weaton (full credits for each song on the track list below).\n\n“Person of Interest” is Billy Price at his soulful best, creating original heartfelt stories from his own life. If you’ve never experienced this Pittsburgh musical treasure and soul survivor, you owe it to yourself to give him a try. If you’re already a fan, you know what I’m talking about. Either way, enjoy it soon. And often.\n\nHere’s a very thorough and interesting interview with Billy Brice by Michael Limnios at Blues.gr.\n\nHere’s another informative interview with music writer Scott Mervis at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n\nHere’s “She Checks All the Boxes” from the album:\n\nTracklist and credits:\n\nBilly Price, Person of Interest\n\nTracks recorded 10/17/23–10/20/23 at Ultratone Studios, Studio City, California\n\nProduced by Tony Braunagel\n\nEngineered and Mixed by Johnny Lee Schell\n\n1.

He’s also one heckuva songwriter, casting an often-sardonic eye at the world around him and turning what he sees into lyrical delights.\n\nOn this session, George has hooked up with West Coast Kid Andersen’s Greaseland production studios and added some of Andersen’s backing band members. The core band of guitarist Andersen includes drummer Derrick D’Mar Martin, keyboardist Chris Burns, trombonist Mike Rinta, saxophonist Michael Peloquin, baritone saxophonist Doug Rowan, and bassist Joe Kyle Jr. The Sons of the Soul Revivers (James, Dwayne, and Walter Morgan) sing enthusiastic background on all but three tracks. That group, plus a handful of extras on selected tracks, make for a rousing album filled with both lyrical and musical delights.\n\nThe title track is the fast-paced opener, as “Cooking With Gas” burns brightly with Burns turning up the heat on piano. “Cellphone Hater 2.0” dials up a satirical lyric plus swinging jazz on the chromatic, all kicked along by crackling horns. “Doom Loop,” is filled with more horns and Latin rhythms.\n\n“Wine Is My Friend” is sparkling fine old-fashioned R&B with a smooth doo-wop vintage. The funky instrumental “Maceosity” is a tribute to James Brown’s musical director Maceo Parker, with George flexing his harp in yet another style. “Awkward Me” features a smooth band sound with an elegant sax solo behind an amusing self-deprecating lyric. “What the Missus Misses” swings hard behind the Big Harp with more lyrical delights.\n\nThe instrumental “June’s Tune” is for drummer June Core, from Charlie Musselwhite’s West Coast bands. Andersen takes a notable retro turn on upright bass. “DIY Mama” is a slyly salacious take on a woman who prefers to take her satisfaction alone. “Paradise Is Burning” takes a more serious, slow-burning turn with an apocalyptic bent.\n\nGeorge takes some philosophical digs at his own self and others who are getting along in years on “The Older We Get” — “The older we get, the better we was” — with an easy big-band feel. Bluesy chromatic swing polishes off the session with the lovely instrumental ballad, “When I First Held Valerie.”\n\nBig Harp George has stepped up his game in a swinging way on “Cooking With Gas.” It’s more than just an easy pun to say that he’s cooking better than ever here, with his clever lyrics, easy singing style, and the power of his big chromatic harp.\n\nHere’s the official video of “Cooking With Gas”:\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Cooking with Gas (3:52)\n\n02. Cellphone Hater 2.0 (3:34)\n\n03. Doom Loop (4:35)\n\n04. Wine Is My Friend (3:46)\n\n05. Maceosity (5:28)\n\n06. Awkward Me (3:43)\n\n07. What the Missus Misses (3:46)\n\n08. June’s Tune (3:55)\n\n09. DIY Mama (4:10)\n\n10. Paradise Is Burning (3:47)\n\n11. The Older We Get (3:22)\n\n12. When I First Held Valerie (3:42)\n\nJeff Pitchell — “Brown Eyed Blues” — Deguello Records\n\nJeff Pitchell is, among other things, a talented singer/songwriter from Connecticut whose eclectic musical style revolves around the blues, in all of its myriad shapes and sizes.\n\nWhen he was just 15, Pitchell won a Best Guitarist contest in his home state. In the four decades since, he’s been making the kind of music that fills his latest album, “Brown Eyed Blues.”\n\nPitchell, with his band Texas Flood, is talented enough to hold his own here, but a stellar musical cast adds considerable punch to these sixteen tracks (yes, that’s sixteen, a few more than your average album these days.) That lineup includes the criminally talented Tom Hambridge (co-composer, co-producer and drummer), Reese Wynans, Duane Betts, Rick Derringer, and Charles Neville.\n\nThe tough, rocking opener, “Now You Know,” emphasizes Pitchell’s robust vocals surrounded by fierce guitar lines, leading into the driving rhythms of the title track, “Brown Eyed Blues,” ridden hard by honky-tonk roadhouse piano from Dan Fontanella. “Wait” steps it up next with jitterbug dance-floor rhythms fueled by Pitchell’s hot lead guitar.\n\nRock-steady drumming from Hambridge kicks in with the call and response behind the strong vocal on “Caught Up In The Wave,” followed by the smooth R&B groove of the philosophically optimistic “Every Day.”\n\nMore highlights include:\n\nThe sweetly sung shuffle “Do Right Girl,” co-written by Hambridge, the pulsating B3 by Bruce Feiner on “Beg, Steal And Rob,” the first of two tracks featuring Charles Neville on sax on the blues chestnut, “Meet Me (With Your Black Drawers On)” by Jim and Jeannie Cheatham.\n\nThe mournful harp of the great James Cotton opens a funky trip down an easy-rolling “Whiskey River,” the Willie Nelson classic. “When It All Comes Down” is another sturdy shuffle, then the torchy ballad “Soulshine” features Michael Allman on vocals. The closer and bonus track is the Latin-flavored “Welcome To The Beat,” a Tex-Mex styling that adds its own seasoning to this fine collection.\n\nEvery track here is crisp and clean, with the backers razor sharp. “Brown Eyed Blues” is a joyous, full-throated exploration of blues themes from a veteran singer/songwriter/guitarman whose talents deserve a much wider audience. Treat yourself to a listen. Then repeat.\n\nHere’s a live performance of “Brown Eyed Blues”\n\nTrack list & credits from the album cover:\n\nAnthony Geraci — “Tears in My Eyes” — Blue Heart Records\n\nAnthony Geraci has been playing blues piano gigs since the mid-1970s, when he opened for a week of Muddy Waters’ shows in Boston.\n\nThat’s about half a century of music-making experience that’s available for Geraci to pour into his latest album, his second for Blue Heart Records, “Tears in My Eyes.” The result is a session filled to overflowing with fine piano-centric blues from this veteran musician and his guests.\n\nGeraci and his band, the Boston Blues All-Stars, are joined on his ninth album by violinist Anne Harris and old friend and former Bluetones bandmate, Sugar Ray Norcia on vocals. The All-Stars are their usual sparkling selves for these eleven original cuts: guitarist/vocalist Barrett Anderson, drummers Marty Richards and Kurt Kalker, and bassist Paul Loranger. The album was recorded in two sessions, the first four tracks in the Boston area, and the others in Prague, capturing the band at its performing peak during a European tour.\n\nNorcia does the vocal honors on the pulsating opening cut, the down-home “Broken Mirror, Broken Mirror,” a tough blues lament. The swinging, rhythmic “Owl’s Nest” is the first of five instrumentals, sparked by a spicy sax solo from guest Drew Davies. Guitarist Anderson’s vocal leads the way through the title track.\n\nAnother instrumental, the lyrical “Blues for Willie J,” is dedicated to the late Willie J. Campbell, who was Geraci’s bandmate in the Proven Ones blues-rock group. Norcia returns with a world-weary vocal on the slow-drag blues, “Judge Oh Judge.” The horns add power to the jazzy blues instrumental “Oh No,” followed by Geraci add vocals to his keyboard on the romping “Ooeee,” featuring a classic honking sax solo.\n\nHarris adds elegant violin lines to the gentle instrumental caress of “Memphis Mist,” followed by the powerful southern rock riffs of “Witchy Ways” behind gritty Anderson vocals. Norcia returns with another mournful slow blues, “Now What,” and Geraci closes the set with a deliciously sweet instrumental, “Lonely Country Road Blues.”\n\n“Tears in My Eyes” is another excellent original album from piano man Anthony Geraci, filled with a variety of expressive blues styles from sweet to sassy, all finely crafted by these talented veteran musicians.\n\nHere’s the title track from “Tears in My Eyes”\n\nHere’s a video of “Tears in My Eyes”\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Broken Mirror, Broken Mirror (6:14)\n\n2. Owl’s Nest (3:06)\n\n3. Tears in My Eyes (4:28)\n\n4. Blues for WillieJ. (4:06)\n\n5. Judge Oh Judge (5:44)\n\n6. Oh No (4:32)\n\n7. Ooeee (4:29)\n\n8. Memphis Mist (3:41)\n\n9. Witchy Ways (4:02)\n\n10. Now What (5:36)\n\n11. Lonely Country Road Blues (3:07)"
