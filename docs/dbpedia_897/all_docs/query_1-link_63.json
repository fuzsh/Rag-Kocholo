        "text": "Jazz, Gypsy, and Klezmer\n\nEuropean Classical\n\nGospel\n\nThe Blues\n\nJAZZ, GYPSY, AND KLEZMER\n\nJazz clarinetist Benny Goodman, born in 1909, grew up in the Maxwell Street area. His father was a tailor, and enrolled his children in a synagogue music program. Soon Benny joined the Hull House Band, and began a music career as a swing band leader.\n\nKlezmer music is based on Jewish folk tunes and the lively Romani (Gypsy) styles. Horns and violins are prominent. In America, the music has evolved to include elements of jazz and Broadway show tunes, in a melting pot just like Maxwell Street. Maxwell Street Klezmer Band of Skokie, IL formed in 1983 and carries on at Chicago area Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and tours in festivals.\n\nhttp://klezmerband.com/aboutus/history.html\n\nHere’s a sample of their sound.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUQeSsf9Sec\n\nRomani (Gypsy) music, with its lively, plaintive fiddles and a kind of hammered dulcimer known as a cimbalom, is loved all over the world. The Romani originated in India and began migrating between 500 and 1000 AD. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people\n\nhttp://www.newstips.org/category/maxwell-street/\n\nMaxwell Street preservationist Steve Balkin, a Roosevelt University professor, has compiled more information on the Romani people in Chicago: http://sites.roosevelt.edu/sbalkin/roma/\n\nBack To Top\n\nEUROPEAN CLASSICAL\n\n“In 1988 my son was ten years old; we went to Maxwell Street looking for baseball cards. It was a perfect summer day. We were struck by the variety of music blaring from various sellers’ tables; gospel, rap, the blues, Broadway musicals, ranchero, you name it, it was there. At one point in the distance I heard what sounded like Italian opera. Following the sound we found an old man sitting behind a card table with a few old tools, a broken flashlight, and assorted other items he appeared to be selling. His hands were folded in front of him. He looked half asleep. The sound I heard was coming from an old, beat-up looking boom box. I was once a music major; my curiosity piqued, I had to ask him about the music. I got his attention. “That sounds like Robert Merrill the Metropolitan Opera baritone. Is that aria he’s singing from the second act of La Traviata?” He hardly moved. But he spoke. “Robert Merrill, Robert Merrill. His mother wanted him to be a cantor. He wanted to be a professional baseball player. They compromised. Robert Merrill.” And then the “second verse”: “Robert Merrill, Robert Merrill. He married Roberta Peters (another opera star). It did not work out. She was a bitch. Robert Merrill. ” He continued in this way for several extra verses, more biography on the great late baritone. Never did his eyes meet mine. I asked him another question. He said nothing. Long pause. And we were on our way.”\n\n—Michael Boruch, DePaul University professor, Maxwell Street Foundation board member\n\nBack To Top\n\nGOSPEL\n\nOn Maxwell Street, preachers of all races and faiths appealed to the crowds, as Michael Shea’s documentary shows in And This is Free. One of the most faithful gospel singers was Carrie Robinson, who sang and danced in the spirit on Maxwell Street from the 1940s through the 1970s. Her “holy dance” for the song “Power” from this video was adapted, in a more secular fashion, on stage by the British rock group, the Rolling Stones.\n\nThomas A. Dorsey, a Georgia piano player who came to Chicago. He struggled his whole life over his role in secular vs. sacred music. He played the blues as “Georgia Tom,” often recording with guitarist Tampa Red for Bluebird Records in Chicago. Tragedies in his family led him to play sacred music, and he saw a need to connect gospel hymns with the feelings and rhythms people were expressing in their everyday music, the blues. But for a long time churches rejected his connection, because many people interpreted the blues as “the devil’s music.”\n\nSome people associated blues with voodoo because of the music’s strong power. The music was, in fact, played in juke joints accompanied by alcohol, dancing and other “forbidden fruit.” Many bluesmen, however, view their talents as a gift from God which helped them survive the worst and still enjoy life. Honeyboy Edwards said, in his autobiography The World Don’t Owe Me Nothing, “God learned me music. He gave me that gift. He looks down on me. I go out and play my guitar, travel all over the world.”\n\nThomas A. Dorsey, known as the father of African American gospel music, went through nervous breakdowns and the tragic deaths of his wife and son in childbirth. He survived to write the magnificent gospel hymn “Precious Lord,” which is still sung at many funerals. After many years, his ideas were accepted. Dorsey co-founded the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses in 1933, and teamed musically with the powerfully inspired Chicago South Side singer Mahalia Jackson six years later to popularize the gospel form.\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/thisfarbyfaith/people/thomas_dorsey.html\n\nOn Maxwell Street, Blind Jim Brewer and his wife Fannie were among musicians playing both blues and gospel.\n\nBack To Top\n\nThe BLUES\n\nA. What is the Blues?\n\nB. Maxwell Street Sounds through the years\n\nC. Blues Musician Index\n\nA. What is the Blues?\n\nThe African American traditions of blues and gospel grew from the same roots in the south: spirituals, work songs, and “field hollers”. Just as in Africa, music—singing and rhythm— kept the community together, since slave times, as they coped with backbreaking labor, cruelty and injustice. The music could be about praising or pleading with God. It could also be stories about the problems, joys and sorrows of people’s daily lives—what Chicago blues master Willie Dixon called “blues: the facts of life.”\n\n….a master musician’s view:\n\n“The whole of life itself expresses the blues. That’s why I always say the blues are the true facts of life expressed in words and song, inspiration, feeling and understanding…All of these songs came from the original tom-toms of Africa, the rhythms of Africa. They were doing code systems with rhythm long before America, and these code systems were the talking drums all over Africa delivering messages. Music today is nothing but the old original beat, only they’re making it with musical instruments instead of the drum. And the African people did always tell stories. That’s where most of the Biblical stories come from.”\n\n—Chicago blues songwriter, arranger, bass player and producer Willie Dixon, in his autobiography I Am the Blues\n\n….a poet’s view: Maxwell Street: “…Confluence of blood and heart: One Beat”\n\nPoet Sterling Plumpp and guitarist Jimmie Lee Robinson break it down in rhythm:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZVyOiUypQs\n\nWhat is the Maxwell Street Sound?\n\n….a critic’s view:\n\n“Maxwell Street is significant to the history of blues not just because music was performed there, but because music was created there. Beginning in the 1920’s, Maxwell Street was the first stopping place for thousands of African-Americans newly arrived from the Mississippi Delta. There, the newcomers could hear established city musicians, and vice versa. This continuous interaction over the course of several decades following the Second World War produced what is typically called “Chicago Blues”, but which could just as easily be called “The Maxwell Street Blues.” Where in previous decades, recorded Delta Blues had been modified to fit the popular song styles of the day, on Maxwell Street it was left raw and simply amplified, both in volume and dramatic intensity. When recorded, the result became not only the dominant form of blues, but a vehicle that radically changed the emerging sound of rock and roll. The sound of bands like the Rolling Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin and many others came about when English teenagers tried to duplicate the music of Maxwell Street bluesmen.”\n\n—Chuck Cowdery, author of Blues Legends featuring photos by Raeburn Flerlage, Gibbs-Smith, 1995\n\n….a videographer’s view:\n\nA 1981 documentary trailer sums up the sights and the musical soundtrack of Maxwell Street’s history, from scenes of early 20th century Jewish stores to 1930s “hokum” songs, to the popular recorded rockin’ blues of the 1950s, to the street musicians using their van as a stage backdrop, to the “Happy Bus” driver who sings “Count Your Blessings” while taking passengers along Roosevelt Road to Halsted.\n\nhttp://www.wbez.org/blogs/lee-bey/2013-06/old-maxwell-street-remembered-film-107720\n\nBack To Top\n\nB. Maxwell Street Sounds through the Years\n\nWe present some of the artists and promoters who influenced and helped develop the Maxwell Street sound; the musicians of the golden age of Chicago blues; the rock music that branched off from it; and the musicians who have continued to play it well into the 21st century. Although music has no boundaries, we’ve outlined five historical eras.\n\n1. Southern Roots, Northern Fruits 1920-1945\n\n2. Postwar Chicago Blues 1945-1970\n\n3. Influence on Rock n Roll 1960s-70s\n\n4. Urban Blues 1970-2000\n\n5. 21st Century Blues 2001-\n\n1. Southern Roots, Northern Fruits 1920-1945\n\nWhen gospel Composer Thomas A. Dorsey, who recorded blues as Georgia Tom, arrived in Chicago in 1919, “There wasn’t much blues then. It was ragtime. Ragtime.” Dorsey explained to Living Blues Magazine, “See, you didn’t’t have the blues singers. The blues wasn’t recognized much until the blues singers got a break, till they got a chance [to record], see. And then the blues began to spread.” Coming up from the south, musicians were used to the natural sounds of stringed instruments, horns, drums, fiddles, banjos, washtubs and voices played on the street, in the church or on people’s front porches. The city was faster, louder; their music speeded up and they looked for ways to amplify the sound. Metal resonator guitars like the Dobro and National Steel helped; but when electric guitars were invented, the musicians quickly adopted the new amplifiers. Jewtown store owners were only too glad to let them plug in their electric cords, for the music drew a crowd in front of each store.\n\nLearning from blood relatives and musical mentors, bluesmen and women have passed the music and stagecraft, since the early 19th century minstrel shows through the early 20th century revues featuring singers like Bessie Smith, to the present day. Recordings have preserved some of the sound and the history, but the thread of connection, through friendships, marriages, and kinships, is best known among the musicians themselves. By the early 20th century, music began to be recorded and sold, and bluesmen and blueswomen learned and copied tunes and styles from musicians across the country. The Maxwell Street “sound” was created, beginning in the 1920s.\n\n2. Postwar Chicago Blues 1945-1970\n\n“The guys that played [there] in the 1940s, [myself], Moody Jones, Floyd Jones, Little Walter – we built the road for the blues in Chicago for Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf and all the rest. We were the pioneers of the blues.”\n\n—Jimmie Lee Robinson, Chicago blues musician, quoted in Lori Grove and Laura Kamedulski’s book Chicago’s Maxwell Street\n\nToday’s favored Chicago blues songs date back to this era, when the blues hit its heyday on the R& B charts. Electric guitar, bass and drums held down each small band, accompanied by piano, harmonica and sometimes a saxophone. Willie Dixon, bass player, arranger and producer, wrote many of these hits, working with musicians at Chess Records (Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Little Walter, and Koko Taylor) and Cobra (Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, and Magic Sam). VeeJay, a Black-owned record company founded in Gary, Indiana, reached an even larger potential audience with blues acts like Jimmy Reed, plus R&B and pop stars like Gene Chandler (“Duke of Earl”) and even an early Beatle album, before folding in 1966.\n\nMost of the recording artists, like Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters, were signed to a circuit of clubs and tours, so they didn’t much play on Maxwell Street. Little Walter Jacobs was an exception; he played the street until he died. A photo by Ray Flerlage shows him outdoors playing guitar, avoiding trouble with the musicians’ union which had registered him as a harmonica player.\n\nMany other blues people would visit the Market and sit-in with performers, or come to recruit musicians to play in their bands. While working as a producer for the short-lived West Side label Cobra Records, Willie Dixon would take Buddy Guy over to Jewtown every Sunday to practice his showmanship. In his autobiography I Am the Blues, Dixon wrote that he would tell Buddy, “Man, put some show into the guitar. Throw it up, catch it!” Buddy practiced and became well known for his guitar tricks.\n\nCRITIC CHUCK COWDERY’S RECOMMENDED BOOKS, RECORDS, AND VIDEOS\n\nVIDEOS and CD RECORDINGS\n\nAnd this is Maxwell Street (CD, Rooster Blues)\n\nRecorded on Maxwell Street in 1964 for the documentary film And This Is Free, the original master tapes were discovered a few years ago and have now (October, 2000) been released as a three CD set. Two of the CDs contain music, the third is an interview with Robert Nighthawk conducted by Mike Bloomfield. Featured on the music disks are Maxwell Street regulars such as Nighthawk, Johnny Young, Carey Bell, Blind Arvella Gray, Jim and Fanny Brewer, and Robert Whitehead. Living Blues, the distinguished blues periodical, named this collection Best Historical Album of the Year for 2001. It also was nominated for the 2001 W. C. Handy Award for Best Historical Blues Album by the Blues Foundation. This is a tremendously enjoyable recording and as real as it gets. Highly recommended.\n\nMasters of Modern Blues (CD Testament records)\n\nFloyd Jones & Eddie Taylor Although recorded in 1966, the tracks here—especially the ones featuring Floyd Jones—are very much what you would have heard Floyd and his cousin, Moody Jones, playing on Maxwell Street in the 40s and 50s. The first rate band here includes Big Walter Horton on harp, Otis Spann on piano and Fred Below on drums. Pete Welding was the producer and Norm Dayron was the engineer.\n\nModern Chicago Blues (CD Testament)\n\nA terrific collection of 21 songs recorded between 1962 and 1966 by the team of Pete Welding and Norm Dayron, it features Johnny Young, Wilbert Jenkins, Maxwell Street Jimmy, Big Walter Horton, Robert Nighthawk, John Lee Granderson, John Wrencher and William Mack, with Otis Spann and other notables in the band on various cuts. Recording locations are not identified, but Welding and Dayron typically recorded in clubs, homes and on Maxwell Street, rather than in studios, so this is about as real as it gets.\n\nHouse of Blues “Blues Masters Vol. 2: Postwar Chicago Blues (CD Rhino)\n\nA terrific collection of 18 songs recorded in Chicago between 1950 and 1962, with an appropriate picture of Maxwell Street on the cover. The artists include Baby Face Leroy, Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson (aka Rice Miller), Johnny Shines, Howlin’ Wolf, Bo Diddley, Eddie Boyd, Robert Lockwood, J.B. Lenoir, Jimmy Reed, Jody Williams, Otis Rush, Magic Sam, Buddy Guy, Earl Hooker and Junior Wells.\n\nChess 50th Anniversary Little Walter: his Best (CD MCA)\n\n“These are the recordings that changed the sound and style of blues harmonica forever, and everyone who came after him was as influenced by him as jazz saxophonists were by Charlie Parker,” writes Cub Koda in All Music Guide.\n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/his-best-mw0000023808\n\nBig Joe Williams, Shake Your Boogie (CD Arhoolie) 1990, combines two Arhoolie albums, “Tough Times” from 1960 and “Thinking of What They Did” from 1969.\n\nBig Joe Williams, The Complete Recorded Works Vol 1 (1935-1941) (CD Document Records)\n\nA collection of his early recordings for the Bluebird label. Of all the artists produced by Lester Melrose during that period, Big Joe remained closest to his Delta roots. Although he traveled continuously for most of his career, until his death in 1982 at the age of 79, he spent a lot of time in Chicago. Some of these tracks feature the original Sonny Boy Williamson on harp, creating a sound many believe was a preview of what Muddy Waters and Little Walter would do later.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000000JI3/charlekcowder\n\nSonny Boy Williamson, Sugar Mama, The Essential Recordings of Sonny Boy Williamson (CD Indigo)\n\nA collection of tracks recorded between 1937 and 1942 in Chicago and nearby Aurora, Illinois. Accompanying him on some of the 24 tracks here are Big Joe Williams, Robert Lee McCoy, Henry Townsend, Yank Rachell, Walter Davis, Big Bill Broonzy, Blind John Davis, Washboard Sam and Charlie McCoy.\n\nChicago Blues Today (Vanguard 3 disc CD set)\n\nThe original set of 3 LPs was recorded and released in 1965. Sam Charters was the producer. This re-issue combines all three albums into a 3-disc set. Featured are Junior Wells, J. B. Hutto, Otis Spann, Jimmy Cotton, Otis Rush, Homesick James, Johnny Young, Johnny Shines and Big Walter Horton. Includes a 47-page booklet, with Sam Charters’ original liner notes. The music is terrific, a prime example of classic Chicago Blues.\n\nAmerican Folk Blues Festival (AFB) Vol 1, 1962-66: video (Universal Distribution)\n\nWhy it took 40 years for these tapes to be released has not been adequately explained, but this much I know: European tours by American blues artists began in the late 50s, with Big Bill Broonzy. In 1962, two German promoters, Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau, launched the American Folk Blues Festival, an annual fall tour of major European cities by a troupe of blues artists, mostly from Chicago, and mostly selected by Willie Dixon. Horst Lippmann also directed a show on a television station in Baden Baden, West Germany, and each year during the tour he featured the troupe on his show. The programs were recorded on first generation video tape equipment. They are in black and white. The fact that these performances of people such as Son House and Lonnie Johnson, not to mention Howlin’ Wolf, Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker, exist at all is incredible. The fact that the video and audio quality is superb, is nothing less than a miracle.\n\nThe AFB DVDs are compilations of performances from multiple years. This is how the music spawned on Maxwell Street reached the rest of the world. They were introduced to it by these tours and things like the television broadcast that occurred in conjunction with them. This is why Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, Cream and the rest of the British blues bands happened. Direct Maxwell Street connections include Little Walter, Hound Dog Taylor, and even a young Jimmie Lee Robinson playing behind Big Mama Thornton on “Hound Dog.” See also The American Folk Blues Festival Volume Two (1962-1966) and The American Folk Blues Festival Volume Three (1962-1969)\n\nBOOKS\n\nChicago Blues: The City and the Music, book by Mike Rowe (DeCapo Press, 1973, paperback, 226 pages. Still the definitive book on the development of Chicago Blues up through the 1960s. Naturally, there is a lot about Maxwell Street. —Chuck Cowdery\n\nUrban Blues, book by Charles Keil, (University of Chicago Press, 1964, reissued 1992, 225 page paperback). The other definitive book on the development of urban blues, including Chicago Blues. More analytical than Rowe’s book, but Rowe’s is better if you’re primarily interested in the Chicago scene. —Chuck Cowdery\n\nA FURTHER NOTE: Keil, a musicologist, was acquainted with Malcolm X and with some leaders in the Black Arts movement of the 1960s. Keil broke ranks with other White critics of the day, who thought electric blues was somehow inauthentic compared to acoustic country blues. Instead, he said the urban bluesmen’s louder, more aggressive performance was a legitimate way of declaring the Black community’s identity and claiming their place in American society. —Bonni McKeown\n\nBlues Legends, by Chuck Cowdery (Gibbs Smith, Publisher, 1995). This book by Maxwell Street Foundation’s former president summarizes the biographies of 20 blues artists who powerfully influenced later developments in popular music. Most worked out of Chicago and many performed on Maxwell Street. The book comes with a 10-song CD and striking, black and white shots by the late photographer Raeburn Flerlage.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Blues-Legends-Charles-K-Cowdery/dp/0879056886\n\nBack To Top\n\n3. Influence on Rock ‘n’ roll\n\nJust as Elvis Presley copied African American rock n roll creators like Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and Fats Domino promoted by Sam Phillips at Sun Records in the 1950s, British rock’n’roll bands copied and built upon American blues. In the 1960s, Chess Records producer and bass man Willie Dixon took many of his songs to the British bands. Brit rockers came over, hung out on Maxwell Street and followed Chicago’s blues stars around clubs on the North, West and South Sides.\n\nThe Rolling Stones took special note of Maxwell Street. Mick Jagger’s loose-shouldered stage routine imitates Carrie Robinson’s “holy dance” on the street as she sings the gospel song “Power!” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm_C36n76VA Carrie’s dance is recorded in Mike Shea’s 1964 documentary “And This is Free.” (The documentary is included on the DVD in the box set And This is Free sold on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/And-This-Is-Free-Legendary/dp/B0015FQZCQ )\n\nAmerican rock bands also looked to Chicago and Maxwell Street for song ideas. Sometimes they were fairly compensated, as in Van Halen paying royalties to blues guitarist John Brim for “Ice Cream Man.” But other times the bluesmen had to fight to get paid, as when Floyd Jones contested the rock group Canned Heat’s use of his lyrics “On the Road Again.” Jones told Living Blues Magazine (LB 59, Spring 1984) that Canned Heat band members Bob Hite, Henry Vestine and Alan Wilson were blues record collectors and very likely bought a 78 rpm record of Jones’ 1953 JOB Records version of “On the Road Again” at Bernard Abrams’ Maxwell Radio Shop. Jones said he eventually won a settlement.\n\nCRITIC CHUCK COWDERY’s ROCK ALBUM AND DVD REVIEWS\n\nThis sampling shows the musical relationship between Chicago blues and 1960s-70s rock:\n\nLed Zeppelin, Early Days; The Best of Led Zeppelin, Volume 1 (WEA/Atlantic). There are many Zeppelin box sets and all of the original albums are available as CDs, as Zep has been one of the most enduring bands from the 70s. They also never strayed far from their roots. Except for the Middle-Eastern stuff, most of their music was based on the style of blues pioneered on Maxwell Street. This collection of early hits is a cheap way to get a taste. The CD also includes a video of a very early performance of “Communication Breakdown.” Another good choice would be their self-titled 1969 debut, which featured songs originally performed by Howlin’ Wolf and Otis Rush that aren’t on the “Early Days” compilation.\n\nCream, The Very Best of Cream (Uni/A&M). They only made four albums, so this 20-song compilation tells you most of what you need to know. Although Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker were always more jazz-oriented, Eric Clapton was and remains a devotee of blues in all its forms. Along with Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones, Cream made the Maxwell Street sound the world’s sound.\n\nRolling Stones The Rolling Stones, 12 x 5 (Uni/ABKCO). On their first few albums, the Rolling Stones were essentially trying to duplicate the Chess sound of Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Willie Dixon and Little Walter. This is probably the best of them and includes their homage to Chess, “2120 South Michigan Avenue.”\n\nBack To Top\n\n4. Urban Blues 1970-2000\n\nWhile the rock boys rocked on, the blues, soul and R&B musicians held forth at neighborhood clubs on the West and South Sides, as well as tourist clubs on the North Side and at the annual Chicago Blues Festival.\n\nMaxwell Street, despite its rough condition, was a magnet for young U.S. and international musicians who respected the blues and wanted to learn and practice on the street. Tom Swain of Oklahoma came to Chicago and worked part time at Maxwell Music Center, 18th and Halsted. He played harmonica with bass player John Henry Davis (age 38, from Clarksdale, MS) and drummer Porkchop Hines at Newberry and Maxwell, just west of Blind Arvella Gray’s spot. Swain mapped out the street’s favorite blues spots and wrote an article for Living Blues magazine July-Aug. 1975. Next to Mrs. Cousins’ soul food place on Peoria Street, Swain reported, fiery young Melvin Taylor had just set up a new band, after learning guitar from another Maxwell Street regular, Li’l Pat Rushing. On 14th and Newberry Streets were spots for Big John Wrencher and Blind Jim Brewer.\n\nHelp Us Identify the Musicians in this 1979 video.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYRBH4wXa1s\n\nContact us at\n\nNearly a decade later, in the Chicago Reader, October 13, 1988, West Side blues critic David Whiteis wrote: “Every Sunday morning, the energy of the Maxwell Street market area rises phoenix-like from the rubble. The crowds, the hustlers, the musicians, and the entire cavalcade of sights, sounds, and smells still combine to transform the desolate wasteland into a once-a-week carnival.” http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/maxwell-street-blues/Content?oid=872877\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, blues musicians led by Johnnie Mae Dunson, Frank “Sonny” Scott, and Jimmie Lee Robinson actively protested the destruction of their heritage and home. When the street was wiped out, a part of them died too. Jimmie Lee went on a hunger strike: http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-07-10/news/0207100252_1_american-folk-blues-festival-blues-aficionados-maxwell-street\n\nChicago Blues on Maxwell Street\n\n(Identified left to right, beginning in front row}\n\nPiano C.

Despite the lack of promotion on the radio, scant coverage in the Chicago mainstream and urban media, and lack of recognition in the music industry (only one category of “Blues” remains in the Grammy award field), the musicians and fans refuse to let the music die. Maxwell Street musicians have come to the market after it was moved to Canal Street and then to DesPlaines. They’ve continued playing in bands around the city and suburbs. They also have gathered at the annual Chicago Blues Festival, often at street performance areas rather than being featured on the main stages.\n\nMaxwell Street blues reunion on small stage at 2008 Chicago Blues Fest:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIZ5tW-6E0M Featuring Robert “Dancin'” Perkins on bass, his long-time guitarist Riler “Ice Man” Robinson on guitar, “Smilin’ Bobby” Smith on guitar, Frank “Little Sonny” Scott on percussion, and Dancin’ Perkins’ son Chris (who began playing drums in his dad’s band on Maxwell Street at the age of 8) on drums.\n\nRECOMMENDED 21st CENTURY BLUES BOOKS, WEB LINKS:\n\nCritic David Whiteis has a chapter, “Maxwell Street: Last Dance at the Carnival of the Soul,” and chapters on blues singer Clarence Scott (Little Scotty) and guitarist Lurie Bell, in his book, Chicago Blues: Portraits and Stories, U. of Illinois Press, 2006 http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/85epd5hc9780252030680.html\n\nBlues and Soul singer/drummer Larry Hill Taylor, growing up on the West Side of Chicago with blues musicians for parents, visited Maxwell Street often as a youngster.

In his early teens, he learned how to play guitar from a South Side neighbor. He also played drums, piano and just about any other instrument put in front of him, but singing was what he relished most, said Sectoria “Peaches” Madison, the mother of his daughter.\n\nBeginning in the 7th grade, Harris played throughout the Chicago area. He also worked as a forklift operator in steel mills, family said. On Maxwell Street, he could be found regularly in the backyard of Nate’s Delicatessen, an institution that made a cameo in the film “The Blues Brothers” as the Soul Food Cafe. There, in front of a five-piece band, Harris would show off his mellow baritone. http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/al-harris/Content?oid=907463 He put a heartfelt, funky West Side spin on soul favorites like Al Green’s “Love and Happiness” and Sam Cooke’s “Change Gonna Come.” Harris performed in the Chicago Blues fest in 2008, his last major appearance before he died in January 2009. http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-02-01/news/0901310141_1_mr-harris-maxwell-street-singing\n\nAlex “Easy Baby” Randle, 1934-2009\n\nAlex “Easy Baby” Randle, singer, drummer and harmonica player, was born in Memphis. He took after his mother and uncle, who both played harmonica. Playing in the juke joints and gambling houses in Memphis, he befriended Howlin’ Wolf, James Cotton, Joe Hill Louis, and other blues men. In 1956, Easy Baby moved to Chicago, playing all over town and working as a mechanic. He led a raucous house band in the 1970s at the Rat Trap at Cermak and Keeler. He’s recorded on Barrelhouse and Rooster Blues, the Austrian label Wolf, and on the Random Records Harmonica Orgy anthology. He played at the Chicago Blues Festival in 1998, 2000, and 2003. http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/alex-easy-baby-randle/Content?oid=907503\n\nArvella (Blind Arvella ) Gray, 1906-1980\n\nBorn James Dixon in Somerville, TX, Gray was a farmer, laborer and roustabout for the Ringling Bros. circus. In addition to his lack of sight, he lost a thumb and a finger in a shotgun incident in 1930, but learned to play guitar in spite of the handicap. He’d wander, singing, through the crowds of Maxwell Street from the early 1930s through 1970s, a National resonator steel guitar hung around his neck and a cup pinned to his lapel to collect tips. He recorded in 1964, his own version of the railroad ballad “John Henry” which mentioned buying a dress on Maxwell Street. All Music Guide says Gray may have had a hand in writing the Bob Dylan song “He was a Friend of Mine.” Ira Berkow interviewed Arvella for his book Maxwell Street: Survival in a Bazaar. http://www.allmusic.com/artist/blind-arvella-gray-mn0000861374/biography\n\nBlind Arvella plays his Maxwell Street version of the ballad “John Henry”, c. 1964, on the And This Is Free: The Life and Times of Chicago’s Legendary Maxwell Street CD. Also see his live performance of this song on the Street in Mike Shea’s film, And This Is Free.\n\nArthur (Little Arthur) Duncan, 1934-2008\n\nBorn in Indianola, MS, raised on the same Woodburn Plantation as B.B. King, Little Arthur Duncan migrated to Chicago with most of his family. He taught himself harmonica hearing his upstairs Chicago neighbor, Little Walter Jacobs, practicing. He played harmonica “upside down” with bass notes on the right, according to Komara’s Blues Encyclopedia. Arthur settled on the West Side and played with Maxwell Street/West Side musicians like Earl Hooker, Little Willie Foster, Floyd Jones and Jimmy Reed, who greatly influenced his style. Larry Taylor recalls playing drums in the late 1970s-early 80s with Arthur’s group, named the Backscratchers after the favorite Slim Harpo song: Willie Charles Burns on bass, Hip Linkchain guitar. In 1989 he cut Bad Reputation for the Blues King label, and that year was documented alongside Robert Plunkett and Emery “Detroit Junior” Williams on Cannonball’s “Blues Across America—The Chicago Scene.” Arthur managed businesses including his club Artesia at Hamlin and Lake Streets, which by 1991 had moved to Madison and LaVerne. http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/little-arthur-duncan/Content?oid=878530 He recorded in 1999-2000 for Delmark (“Singing with the Sun”) and Random Chance. Arthur kept playing around Chicago til his final illness and death.\n\nLittle Arthur Duncan plays harmonica on “And This is Free: Live on Maxwell Street.”\n\nBaby Face Leroy Foster, 1923-1958\n\nA drummer and guitar player born 1923 in Algoma, MS, Foster worked for tips on Maxwell Street before graduating to the clubs playing with men like Sunnyland Slim, Sonny Boy Williamson and Lee Brown. Known as a goodtime party guy, in 1947 he joined with the fabled “Headhunters,” including Muddy Waters and Jimmy Rogers, who would musically “cut the heads” of any players foolish enough to challenge them on stage. Foster accompanied Little Johnny Jones recording “Big Town Playboy” in 1949; J.B. Lenoir in 1950, Little Walter in 1948 and 1950, Floyd Jones in 1948, playing drums on “Hard Times.” Beset by alcoholism, he died at age 35.\n\nLeroy plays the hypnotic train-rhythm blues “Rollin’ and Tumblin,'” a with the Baby Face Trio, Muddy Waters and Little Walter, on the And This Is Free CD.\n\nBernard Abrams, 1918-1997: Ora Nelle Records\n\nOne of Chicago’s very first record companies to record blues was Ora-Nelle Records, owned and operated by Bernard Abrams and his wife Idel at their Radio and Records store at 831 W. Maxwell Street. Ora Nelle launched the career of harmonica master Little Walter Jacobs, and Abrams’ store was a friendly place for musicians and blues record collectors for years.\n\nAccording to British writer Mike Rowe’s book Chicago Blues: The City and the Music, Ora Nelle issued only two records: one by the mandolin-guitar duo Johnny Young and Johnny Williams. The other was little Walter’s “I Just Keep Loving Her” with Othum Brown, backed by Walter’s harp on the other side, singing “Ora Nelle Blues.” The Abrams must have named the record company for Othum’s lady friend Ora Nelle. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E7z56E0DwI Another Maxwell Street musician, Jimmy Rogers, used the song’s key phrase “that’s all right” in his hit song several years later.\n\nBill (Big Bill) Broonzy, 1893-1958\n\nBroonzy first played fiddle with Papa Charlie Jackson, learned guitar, got a foothold in Chicago nightclubs and in turn mentored other musicians. Through the 1930s he helped originate the small band sound (singer, guitar, piano, bass drums) typical of Chicago blues. On Dec. 23, 1938, Big Bill played solo in the first “Spirituals to Swing” concert at the Carnegie Hall in New York City—a stand-in for Robert Johnson who had been murdered that year. Bill toured Europe and lived in Amsterdam. He became a folk audience favorite and a founding faculty member of the Old Town School of Folk Music. In the benediction at the 2009 inauguration of President Barack Obama, the civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Joseph Lowery referred to the phrase “If you’re black, get back!” from Broonzy’s song “Black, Brown and White Blues.” http://www.broonzy.com\n\nBlind Percy (Robinson?) ?? – ??\n\nBlind Percy is the name of a musician who Jimmie Lee Robinson said helped teach him to play on Maxwell Street. http://paramountshome.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=95:mercy-mr-percy-that-is-surely-him&catid=45:new-york-recording-laboratoriesartist&Itemid=54\n\nPercy may have had other stage names as well. He’s said to be one of the few harmonica players who used a rack around his neck to free up his hands to play guitar or other instrument at the same time, like Jimmy Reed and Bob Dylan. http://www.allmusic.com/artist/blind-percy-his-blind-band-mn0002300503/biography\n\nBlind Percy and His Blind Band play “14th St Blues” c 1927 on the And This Is Free CD\n\nBobby Too Tuff, 1932-\n\nAnother Maxwell Street veteran, Bobby sings as a street performer, summer, 2006 (is this the later Canal St. Maxwell Market?) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yStDAOj2GPQ\n\nBobby Top Hat Davis, 1932-\n\nBorn in Dallas, TX, Bobby “Top Hat” Davis was already entertaining people at age nine, shining shoes and tap dancing outside the Dallas State Movie Theater. He collaborated with Texas bluesman Little Son Jackson in 1947, and taught himself to play drums and organ. http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-davis-mn0001952769/biography Moving to Chicago in 1957, with Roscoe Gordon and Baby Face Willette, Davis got a longtime gig at the Crown Propeller Club. He played with Otis Rush, Eddie Boyd, and Matt “Guitar” Murphy, and occasionally drummed for Muddy Waters and accompanied Ray Charles in the 1980 film Blues Brothers. On Maxwell Street, From 1959 til 1967, Davis played organ by the service station at 14th and Halsted with drummer Rosie Davis and guitarist Eric Davis. Bobby had a blues show on public access TV Bobby’s own son Eric Davis, a promising 40 year old guitarist with a family of his own, was cruelly shot to death in his car before Christmas 2013 on the South Side after a night of playing music at the Kingston Mines. http://illinoisentertainer.com/2014/01/january-2014-sweet-home/\n\nCoot “Tenor” “Playboy” Venson, ?? – ??\n\nVenson was a drummer and harmonica player who accompanied Big Joe Williams in the late 1950s-early 60s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4pL4d7EW9E Larry Taylor remembers his mother, around 1960, taking him to Maxwell Street when he was five years old, seeing a drum set for the first time and Coot playing it, wearing a top hat and a long overcoat summer and winter.\n\n“Daddy Stovepipe” Johnny Watson, 1867-1963\n\nA jug band style musician born in Alabama in 1867 right after the Civil War, Watson was among the earliest recorded bluesmen, making a record in Richmond Indiana 1924. He had begun playing in Mexico on 12-string guitar with mariachi bands in 1900, then with the traveling Rabbit Foot minstrels. His wife, known as Mississippi Sarah, sang and played the jug. The couple moved to Mississippi where Sarah died unexpectedly in 1937. Johnny traveled and played the southwest, then moved back to Chicago where he played as a one-man band on Maxwell Street til he died in 1963—a classy, sometimes lonely figure in his top hat and waistcoat. His statue keeps a vigil on the gentrified 21st century Maxwell Street. http://www.thebluestrail.com/artists/dstove.htm\n\n“Daddy Stovepipe” Watson with his wife Mississippi Sarah, trade insults in a classic jug band tune on the And This Is Free CD, 1936 “The Spasm”\n\nDancin’ (Robert) Perkins, 1931-\n\nPerkins, a bass player, was born in 1931 outside Baltimore, MD. His parents moved to the near South Side of Chicago; they took him to visit Maxwell Street when he was eight years old. He soon took up guitar and then bass. He played with John Davis (the “Mayor of Maxwell Street”), Maxwell Street Jimmy Davis, Pat Rushing, Willie James, and John Embrey, whom he credits “with keepin’ me going to play the Blues by finding me jobs at the clubs.”\n\nHe got the nickname, Dancin’, from his dance stepping while playing his bass. He is also known as Mr. Pitiful, from his former band with the late Magic Slim. Perkins kept the name Mr. Pitiful and Magic Slim kept the name Teardrops. Perkins played on Maxwell street from 1965 on, even at the new market at Canal Street after the old market was moved in 1994. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdeRc5vsoS4\n\nDave Lindsey, 195— to 200—?\n\nBorn in Chicago, son of West Side guitarist Big Bad Ben Murphy, Dave Lindsey led a band that held down the blues during the 1990s at Maxwell and Halsted before the market was moved to Canal Street. His hard-hitting, emotion-filled guitar playing drew praise from Chicago Tribune critic Howard Reich and poet Sterling Plumpp: http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-04-13/features/9404130169_1_chicago-blues-real-blues-urban-blues Lindsey, a well organized band leader, stocked all kinds of musical instruments in his basement and rented them out reasonably to fellow musicians who lacked instruments or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMoo371JKiE David Lindsey backing Al Harris at the 1993 Taste of Chicago.\n\nEddie C. Campbell, 1939-\n\nEddie C’s shimmering West Side-styled guitar playing and introspective songwriting had their roots in Duncan Mississippi, where he left for the bright lights of Chicago at age ten, sneaking a peek at Muddy Waters and jamming with his idol when he was only 12. He fell in with some West Side young bloods—Luther Allison and Magic Sam—and played for Howlin Wolf, Little Walter, Little Johnny Taylor and Jimmy Reed. Koko Taylor recommended him to Willie Dixon, who hired him as a Chicago Blues All-Star in 1976. Eddie C. cut a few sides for local labels in the 60s, and in 1977 released the LP King of the Jungle (Mr. Blues). In 1984 he moved to Europe, then recorded CDs in 1994 for Blind Pig and in 2009 for Delmark. http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-c-campbell-mn0000169690/biography In 2013, on tour in Germany, he was paralyzed by a stroke and heart attack. By the end of the year he’d recovered enough to play harmonica, but not yet guitar.\n\nEddie Taylor, 1923-1985\n\nBorn in Benoit, MS, guitarist Eddie Taylor started music early in life. His babysitter was Memphis Minnie, an extraordinary singer, songwriter and guitar player who moved, like many of the musicians of the time, from the Delta to Memphis to Chicago. As a young boy learning to play along with his friend Jimmy Reed, he followed guitar heroes Robert Johnson, Charley Patton and Son House. Arriving Chicago in 1949, Taylor played on Maxwell Street and in the clubs on the West and South Side, first with guitarist Jimmie Lee Robinson, then with harpist Snooky Pryor and guitarist Floyd Jones. He’s best known for laying down the boogie behind his old homey Reed. Taylor toured Europe and Japan, recording for VeeJay, Testament, Advent, Big Bear, and L&R Records. http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-taylor-mn0000176673/biography Eddie and his wife Vera, a singer recorded on Wolf Records, raised a brood of Chicago blues musicians: Eddie Jr., blues guitarist and singer; Tim, a drummer; Larry, blues and soul singer and drummer Demetria, blues vocalist; Brenda, hiphop vocalist.\n\nHere’s Eddie singing Peach Tree Blues (original by Yank Rachell) on the Testament Modern Blues Masters album featuring Floyd Jones on bass, Big Walter Horton harmonica, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jV-SL4ggtY\n\nFloyd Jones, 1917-1989\n\nA thoughtful guitarist from Marianna, Arkansas, guitarist Floyd Jones grew up with Howlin’ Wolf. In Chicago, he wrote memorable poor-man’s tunes such as “Hard Times” and “Stockyard Blues” as well as the haunting “Dark Road” about his mother’s death “when I was quite young.” He played with his cousin Moody Jones on Maxwell Street, as well as Johnny Shines, Big Walter Horton, Eddie Taylor. http://www.allmusic.com/artist/floyd-jones-mn0000194122/biography\n\nHe switched to bass as that electric instrument became popular. Floyd had his own hard times recovering royalties in court when the rock band Canned Heat “borrowed” the words to his “On the Road Again.” (see Living Blues magazine issues 58, 59, winter and spring 1984).\n\nFloyd Jones plays “Dark Road,” c. 1952, on the And This is Free CD.\n\nFrank “Little Sonny” Scott, 1927-\n\nFrank Scott was born in Montgomery, TX, and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Moving to the Maxwell Street area in Chicago, he played harmonica and drums and sang blues on the street. Later he created his own folk art items such as Maxwell Street crosses and, around 2000, built a wooden Juketown Bandstand at the northeast corner of Maxwell and Halsted, to protest the demolition of 2001. Even after his bandstand and the stores were torn down, Sonny Scott continued to show up on various streets and at the Maxwell Street Foundation booth at the Chicago Blues Fest during the 2000’s. http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/blues-plate-special/Content?oid=908489\n\nFrank appears along with Jimmie Lee Robinson, Sleepy Otis Hunt, Willie Hudson and Bill Warren on a CD produced in 1995 by photographer Jim Fraher, Lost American Bluesman: http://www.amazon.com/Lost-American-Bluesmen/dp/B000005BNA/ref=ntt_mus_dp_dpt_1\n\nGood Rockin’ Charles, 1933-1989\n\nInspired by both Sonny Boy Williamsons and Little Walter Jacobs, Charles Edwards, born in 1933 in Tuscaloosa AL, began playing harp shortly after hitting Chicago in 1949. Suffering studio fright, he ducked out of playing on guitarist Jimmy Rogers’ 1956 Chess recording of “Walking by Myself” — leaving the door wide-open for Big Walter Horton to step in with afine solo. Steve Wisner’s short-lived Mr. Blues label recorded Charles in 1975, later re-issued by P-Vine. He’s best known for playing with Johnny Young, Lee Jackson, Arthur Spires, and Otis “Big Smokey” Smothers. Through the late 1970s and 1980s he showed up to play at the Delta Fish Market.\n\nMr. H.\n\nMr. H. (Baron of the Blues), played harmonica for 50 years with Bobby Top Hat Davis. Mr. H was raised in the Pilsen neighborhood next door to Maxwell Street , where he began to listen and play with the musicians in the 1960s. In the early 1990s he played often with Piano C Red’s group at the makeshift Blues stage in front of the Johnny Dollar Thrift Shop. He helped protest the street’s demolition through 2000.\n\nHoneyboy Edwards, 1915-2011\n\nBorn in Shaw, MS, David “Honey” Edwards was one of the last Delta guitar players to travel and perform professionally. http://www.davidhoneyboyedwards.com He hoboed (v.t.) and played music around the south with Robert Johnson, Sunnyland Slim, Eddie Taylor and both Big and Little Walter. Hearing of prosperity on Maxwell Street, Honey migrated to Chicago in 1945 with harmonica player Little Walter. They found the street thronged with people of all kinds. He and Walter made their money. “The best sound,” he said in his autobiography, “got the best crowd.” Honey continued to play, tour and share his life stories, most recently on the Earwig label with Michael Frank, til his death at age 96. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7UV0JKEfVQ\n\nHomesick James Williamson, 1910-2006\n\nHomesick (as most of his colleagues and fans called him) was born in Somerville, Tennessee, some 25 miles east of Memphis. Connecting with other musicians, he moved to Chicago during the late 1930s or 40s and worked a day job in a steel mill.During the 1950s he played in the city’s clubs, often with the harmonica player Snooky Pryor or with pianist Lazy Bill Lucas, who accompanied him on his first recordings for the Chance label. He recorded with, and emulated slide guitar master Elmore James, who may have been his cousin, and continued to record into the 1990s. http://www.allmusic.com/artist/homesick-james-williamson-mn0000825544/biography\n\nHorst Lippman, 1927-1997\n\nThis German promoter helped the music spawned on Maxwell Street to reach the rest of the world. He offered the legendary Howlin’ Wolf guitarist, Hubert Sumlin, the then princely sum of 10,000 German marks to make a clandestine LP (on the Amiga label) in East Berlin in 1964, when such “decadent” music was verboten on the airwaves. He also had an ear for East Coast blues, recording Washington, D.C.-based Piedmont guitar wizard Archie Edwards in Archie’s landmark barbershop. On his own label, L&R (Lippman and Rau), into the 1980s, he recorded many artists in his annual American Folk Blues Festival in Frankfurt, including Chicago blues giants Willie Dixon, Earl Hooker, and Eddie Taylor. http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/horst_lippman\n\nHound Dog Taylor, 1915-1975\n\nTheodore Roosevelt “Hound Dog” Taylor took his guitar and slide to Maxwell Street in 1940 when he first arrived in Chicago from Natchez, Mississippi at age 23. A band could make $120 on a Sunday morning, he told Ira Berkow, author of Maxwell Street: Survival in a Bazaar. He was happy to have left the south where people made only 75 cents a day picking cotton. Once north in the big city, musicians flocked to Jewtown, he said—Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf, Little Walter, Jimmy Rogers. He quit music to work other jobs til the mid-1950s, but then he formed a band, the House Rockers, with drummer Ted Harvey and Brewer Phillips on second guitar. They tore up West and South Side clubs for awhile with some raucous rocking blues, then obtained promotion from the brand new Alligator Records label in 1971. http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hound-dog-taylor-mn0000225754/biography\n\nJ.B. Hutto, 1926-1983\n\nBorn in Blackville, SC, J.B. Hutto’s gospel-singing family moved to Chicago’s West Side in 1949. He took up first drums, piano, then settled on guitar, putting together a powerful ensemble with drummer Porkchop Hines on Maxwell Street and harp player George Maywether.

He played all over Tennessee and Arkansas before a 1958 car crash left him with only one arm.

Moody told writer Mike Rowe they’d stroll through the crowds up to 12th Street from Maxwell (14th Street) and back down, earning $40 to $50 each—a fortune in the 1940s. Little Walter, a harmonica master, came to Moody asking for guitar-playing pointers. The track “Snooky and Moody’s Boogie” may have inspired Little Walter’s 1953 hit “Juke.” Jones made further recordings for the JOB label in the early 1950s, backing musicians such as Snooky Pryor and Johnny Shines. By 1955, according to Mike Rowe’s book Chicago Blues, Moody gave up blues for gospel music and became a pastor.\n\nOthum Brown ( ??- ??)\n\nOne of only two records issued by Bernard Abrams’ OraNelle Records, according to Mike Rowe’s Chicago Blues, was Little Walter’s “I Just Keep Loving Her” with Othum Brown, backed by Walter’s harp on the other side, as Othum sang “Ora Nelle Blues.” The Abrams named the record company for Othum’s lady friend Ora Nelle. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E7z56E0DwI\n\nPapa Charlie Jackson, 1885-1938\n\nJackson was known as the first commercially successful male blues singer.

I play with my guitar, and my foot percussion thing and I have my racked harmonica like Jimmy Reed played. It takes a lot of stamina to play and sing out there on the street 6 hours a day. I run 3-5 miles three times a week and play basketball. I try to eat right, I’m a vegetarian.”\n\nLefty plays on the sidewalks at Chicago Blues Festival and neighborhood events, and at the Maxwell Street outdoor market Sundays which the city moved to DesPlaines Ave. He likes meeting younger people and educating them about the blues.\n\nBonni McKeown interviewed him in December 2017 for Austin Weekly News: http://www.austinweeklynews.com/News/Articles/1-8-2018/Vince-Johnson-masters-computers-and-guitars-/\n\nVince is also featured in an oral interview elsewhere on the Maxwell Street Foundation site.\n\nWalter (Big Walter “Shakey”) Horton, 1918-1981\n\nBorn in Horn Lake MS, according to Edward Komara’s Blues Encyclopedia, Horton played with musicians in Memphis and recorded on sessions with Sun Records.He"
