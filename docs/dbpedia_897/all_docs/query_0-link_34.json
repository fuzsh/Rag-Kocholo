        "text": "Welcome to the 2018 version of Daveâs Top Ten List of Top Ten Lists.\n\nHere as part of our annual âbest ofâ¦â edition of BLUES JUNCTION, we continue our tradition of bringing you the top ten albums of the year, as submitted by ten highly respected individuals who have been part of the blues scene for many years.\n\nThis feature remains one of my favorite projects I work on each year. In pulling together this annual celebration of achievement in the blues recording field, I get a chance to interact with other like-minded individuals who share my love and passion for this music. Regardless of any of these individualâs involvement with this music, the one thing each has in common is that they are true listeners, connoisseurï»¿s and lovers of the music.\n\nAs many of our readers are keenly aware, some of the best blues music being produced today is coming from abroad. So, these top ten lists also come from blues lovers from all over world. We have participants coming from four separate continents and as many countries. In the U.S. we have folks from all over including Texas, the Midwest, Florida and three people representing three distinct regions of my home state of California.\n\nMy question to them was simple: âWhat are your ten favorite blues albums of 2018?â\n\nHow we do things around here is pretty simple. The only criteria for these recordings was that they must be made up of all or mostly all new material which was released in the calendar year of 2018. No re-issues, multi-artist compilations or âbest ofâ¦â packages were to be taken into consideration. They also must be available in a physical format.Â\n\nNow the fun part is hearing from you, our readers and your thoughts on any or all of this. What is your favorite blues album(s) of 2018?\n\nï»¿Chico Blues - Sao Paulo, Brazil\n\nChico is the founder and president ofÂ Chico Blues RecordsÂ out of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

This record is a true return to form for Nulisch who, by my ears and those attached to the heads of our participants, made one of the best blues albums of his long career. Like last yearâs winner Kim Wilsonâs Blues and Boogie Vol. 1 this CD has the prints of Big John Atkinson all over the recording. This release also follows a career path where both Wilson and now Nulisch have stepped away from the pre-processed, overly produced, soul-blues house sound of the Severn Records label and returned to their true strengthâ¦the straight ahead, natural blues played the right way.\n\nAs far as the rest of the 2018 field is concerned, 49 separate artists made it onto at least one of these lists. Of those 24 made it on two or more lists. Twelve of these were listed at least three times. Here is the breakdown. The number of lists in which these artists appear is in parenthesis.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ\n\nDarrell Nulisch - The Big Tone Sessions Vol. 1 (8)Â Â Â Â\n\nJames Harman - fineprint (6)\n\nDoug Deming & the Jewel Tones - Complicated Mess (4)\n\nAnthony Gerraci - Why Did You Have To Go (4)\n\nBig Creek Slim & Rodrigo Mantovani - First Born (4)\n\nNick Moss featuring Dennis Gruenling -Â The High Cost of Low Living (4)\n\nWest Weston -Â West Street (4)\n\nLurrie Bell & The Bell Dynasty - A Tribute To Carey Bell (3)\n\nBob Corritore & Friends -Â Donât Let The Devil Ride (3)\n\nBuddy Guy - The Blues Is Alive And Well (3)Â Â Â\n\nKnock-Out Greg & the Jukes - It's a Good Thing (3)\n\nLittle Victor - Deluxe Lo-Fi (3)Â Â Â\n\nRJ Mischo - I Hope Youâre Satisfied (3)\n\nCurtis Salgado & Alan Hager - Rough Cut Â (3)\n\nWhitney Shay - A Woman Rules The World (3)Â\n\nPaul Barry - Blow Your Cool (2)\n\nPaul Oscher - Cool Cat (2)\n\nShawn Pittman and Jay Moeller - Everybody Wants To Know (2)\n\nSam Rocket & His Blues Prisoners - Caught In The Groove (2)\n\nKid Ramos - Old School Â (2)"
