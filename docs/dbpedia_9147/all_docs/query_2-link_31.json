        "text": "Heartland Events Center\n\nSet in the center of Nebraska, the Heartlands Events Center is part of the Fonner Park Complex and is a popular venue for conferences, fairs, shows, and even sports events. Most of the happenings and celebrations in Grand Island and the nearby Fonner Park are held in the facility. The Eihusen Arena, which was inaugurated in 2006, is an addition to the Heartland Events Center. Featuring a 7,500 seating capacity, it is the ideal venue for concerts and sports including football. For meetings and conferences, the building next to Eihusen Arena, the Bosselman Conference Center, is often the venue for such activities. Every year, the Nebraska State Fair is held in the Heartland Events Center.\n\nWith easy access to Aurora via US-34 route and just minutes from York, the Heartland Events Center has unlimited access to many fun opportunities in and around the area. Hotels are abundant nearby allowing days of total enjoyment when exploring Grand Islandâ€™s vast outdoors. Just a short drive from the Heartland Events Center and the Fonner View Golf Course, Island Inn offers non-smoking rooms with Wi-Fi and free parking and breakfast rolls. The Stuhr Museum of the Prairie Pioneer, which houses remembrances of the pioneers in the 19th century, is also nearby. Ramada by Wyndham Midtown Grand Island is a good choice when it comes to comfort, location and value for money. Only 10 minutes from the Stuhr Museum and Oasis Island Waterpark, the modern hotel features an atrium equipped with a swimming pool, mine golf, billiards, and hot tub."
