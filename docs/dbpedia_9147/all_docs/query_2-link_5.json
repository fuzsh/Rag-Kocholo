The team was founded in 2011 by Charlie Bosselman as an expansion member of the IFL. The Danger played their home games at Eihusen Arena.[1]\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, the Nebraska Danger was selected as having the IFL's Best Fans. In 2013, the Danger were named IFL Franchise of the Year. Former general manager Mike McCoy was named 2013 IFL Executive of the Year and quarterback Jameel Sewell was named the 2013 IFL Most Valuable Player and Offensive Player of the Year.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOn October 4, 2010, Bosselman Entertainment LLC announced the formation of Nebraska Danger as an expansion member of the Indoor Football League (IFL) for the 2011 season.[2] At the press conference, team owner Charlie Bosselman announced that Sean Ponder would be the team's inaugural head coach,[3] however after just two months on the job, Ponder left the Danger for personal reasons, and Mike Davis was named head coach.[4] On March 7, 2011, the Danger defeated the Wichita Wild 70–59, in the team's first game.[5]\n\nOn June 28, 2014, the Danger traveled to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for a second-straight year looking to defeat the Storm for the United Bowl. The Danger came up short again, falling 46–63.[6][7]\n\nOn September 7, 2016, Hurtis Chinn was promoted to head coach after Mike Davis announced he was taking a role with the Saskatchewan Roughriders.[8]\n\nAfter the 2019 season, the Bosselman family announced they were looking to sell the team.[9] No owner was found before the deadline for participating in the 2020 season.\n\nStatistics and records\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason-by-season results\n\n[edit]\n\nLeague Champions Conference Champions Division Champions Playoff berth League leader\n\nSeason Team League Conference Division Regular season Postseason results Finish Wins Losses Ties 2011 2011 IFL United Great Plains 4th 3 11 2012 2012 IFL Intense 6th 5 9 2013 2013 IFL Intense 1st 10 4 Won Intense Conference Championship (Colorado) 55–50\n\nLost 2013 United Bowl (Sioux Falls) 40–43 2014 2014 IFL Intense 2nd 10 4 Won Intense Conference Championship (Colorado) 45–15\n\nLost 2014 United Bowl (Sioux Falls) 46–63 2015 2015 IFL Intense 1st 10 4 Won Intense Conference Championship (Fever) 86–43\n\nLost 2015 United Bowl (Storm) 27–62 2016 2016 IFL Intense 3rd 6 10 Won Intense Conference Wild Card (Billings) 64–52\n\nLost Intense Conference Championship (Spokane) 44–55 2017 2017 IFL Intense 2nd 9 7 Lost Intense Conference Championship (Arizona) 36–62 2018 2018 IFL 4th 4 10 Lost Semifinal (Iowa) 17–48 2019 2019 IFL 5th 7 7 Won First Round (Green Bay) 45–40\n\nLost Semifinal (Arizona) 45–62 Totals 64 66 0 All-time regular season record (2011–2019) 5 7 — All-time postseason record (2011–2019) 69 73 0 All-time regular season and postseason record (2011–2019)\n\nHead coach records\n\n[edit]\n\nName Term Regular Season Playoffs Awards W L T Win% W L Mike Davis 2011–2016 44 42 0 .512 4 4 Hurtis Chinn 2017 9 7 0 .563 0 1 Mark Stoute 2018 4 7 0 .364 — — Adam Shackleford / Pig Brown\n\n(interim co-coaches)[10] 2018 0 3 0 .000 0 1 Pig Brown[11] 2019 7 7 0 .500 1 1\n\nPlayers\n\n[edit]\n\nFinal roster\n\n[edit]\n\nNebraska Danger roster Quarterbacks\n\n8 Tommy Armstrong Jr.\n\n6 Javonte Seard\n\nRunning backs\n\n24 Davonte Sapp-Lynch\n\nWide receivers\n\n5 Gregory Dent Jr.\n\n7 Johnny Jackson IV\n\n85 Tevaris McCormick\n\n4 Eric Thomas\n\n20 Quincy Walden\n\nOffensive linemen\n\n65 Sean Brown\n\n56 Adolphus Barnes\n\n71 Taylor Werner\n\n76 Dominique Harris\n\nDefensive linemen\n\n55 D'vonn Brown\n\n91 Courtel Jenkins\n\n93 Sevyon Lowry\n\n43 Chris Martin\n\nLinebackers\n\n21 Luke Stice\n\nDefensive backs\n\n26\n\n17 Steffon Herd\n\n11 Levarious Varnado\n\n9 De'Andre Coley\n\n15 Brandon Roe\n\n26 Thaddeus Philyaw III\n\nSpecial teams\n\n88 Diego Marquez K\n\nReserve lists\n\nRoster updated June 15, 2019\n\n24 Active, 6 Inactive\n\n→ More rosters\n\nAll-League selections\n\n[edit]\n\nQB Jameel Sewell (2)\n\nRB Waymon James (1)\n\nWR Kayne Farquharson (3), O.
