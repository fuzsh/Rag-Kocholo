The report analyzes the feasibility of a proposed events center in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. It finds that the population and economic activity in Rocky Mount is growing, and identifies several existing facilities in the region that could be competition. Interviews with local stakeholders suggest support for an events center. The report recommends a facility design and operating assumptions, and projects annual event demand, attendance, and operating revenues and expenses. It also models potential construction costs and funding scenarios. An economic impact analysis finds that the center would generate new spending in the local economy and support additional jobs during both construction and ongoing operations.",
