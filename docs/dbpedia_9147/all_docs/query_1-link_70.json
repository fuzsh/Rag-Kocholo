That’s just about\n\nwhat Charlie’s grandfather, Fred Bosselman, did back in 1948.\n\nFred, a farmer and half-time trucker, hauled loads between\n\nNebraska and Colorado and he personally experienced\n\nthe demand for fuel and food along the way. So, he\n\nopened Bosselman & Eaton Truck Stop along\n\nHwy 30 in Grand Island. Then, in 1965, he built\n\nBosselman Truck Plaza along I-80 and Hwy 281,\n\nalso in Grand Island. This became known as the\n\n“Truckstop of Tomorrow” and Charlie and his team\n\nare still keeping it that way even though the industry\n\nand culture have shifted significantly over the years.\n\nCharlie knows about those shifts. “We’ve seen\n\nthe ups and downs, the ins and outs and lived through\n\nall the good and bad times. The industry has changed\n\na lot – it used to be that anyone could be in the business,\n\nbut the days of independent truck stops are numbered.” It\n\nwould be easy to simply lament the reality of ‘conglomerate\n\ncreep’ – large companies moving in and stealing the customer\n\nbase through low prices. Instead, Charlie and his family do two\n\nimportant things to ensure they not only maintain their business,\n\nbut strengthen it. First, they work with, rather than against, the\n\nlarge corporations by building meaningful connections with them\n\nthat serve both Bosselman Enterprises and the conglomerates.\n\nAnd, second, they keep their eyes focused on what is coming\n\ndown the pike, in order to be ready to react in a way that\n\nwill keep them targeted for growth rather than failure.\n\nnebtrucking.com\n\nRecognizing that a fuel pump and candy bars just aren’t enough Charlie emphasizes they have had to aggressively go after\n\nanymore, Bosselman Travel Center now flies under the Pilot/ these new relationships and opportunities. From a truck stop\n\nFlying J banner, having worked out a mutually beneficial contract perspective, the migration is toward the larger chains because\n\nwith Pilot. One strategy Bosselman Travel Center has employed of fleets and fuel contracts. “Fuel,” said Charlie “has become\n\nto adapt to a difficult changing landscape in the industry has been a commodity.” Consequently, Bosselman is taking a stronger\n\nto diversify the company. This has made it possible to bob and role in renewable fuels. For example, they have the most\n\nweave with the new needs of the transportation industry, as well blender sites in the state of Nebraska; blending ethanol in\n\nas maintain a fairly consistent balance sheet in years when one their convenience stores. At the truck stop, they’re also very\n\ndepartment may not be as successful as another. Consequently, the active with bio-diesel, and have even installed a Tesla Charging\n\nflagship Bosselman Travel Center still proudly operates on I-80 Station. “What’s coming down the pike is renewable energy,\n\nand Hwy 281, but Bosselman also serves the industry through and we’re focusing on that.” Charlie said emphatically.\n\nan impressive number of convenience stores, hotels, restaurants,\n\nand their 43 Boss Shops specializing in truck service and repair. It’s not easy for ‘mom and pop’ establishments to survive in\n\nan environment that is dominated by big business. Charlie seems\n\nThe development of meaningful connections with the chains to have found a winning formula with his attention to building\n\nand large corporations has been crucial. “We realized pretty early relationships and keeping a broad vision for what’s ‘coming down\n\non,” said Charlie, “that as a family-owned independent business, we the pike.’ Still, without one last component, Bosselman might\n\ncould not compete with the large corporations, but we could survive find themselves in the same place as many other family-owned\n\na long time on the crumbs that came our way.” Those crumbs have businesses that have found themselves pushed out of existence.\n\nincluded several truck service locations that became opportunities That component is the ability to be nimble in the changing\n\nfor Bosselman precisely because they had built and maintained environment. Being nimble makes it possible to capitalize on\n\nrelationships with Pilot. When Pilot bought out Flying J, they got vision and relationships. Charlie Bosselman and his team have\n\n16 truck service shops in the deal. Servicing trucks, however, wasn’t figured that out. As Charlie remarked, “We’re not so big that we\n\none of their company’s core competencies. They went straight to have to turn around the Titanic when we need to change.

We can think and react quickly.” When larger companies\n\nportfolio of 10 truck service shops grew to 26, and now stands at 43. are still in committee meetings, Charlie and his team are carefully\n\nThat was one of Charlie’s ‘crumbs’ – dropped his way – just because making new decisions to take them into the future alongside the\n\nhe had taken the initiative to develop partnerships and connections. large conglomerates.\n\nEven the truck service side of the business, however, has had to In their own way, they’ve become a conglomerate themselves\n\nendure re-shaping and change. Years ago, trucks needed frequent with their ability to service trucks on the road with Boss Shops,\n\noil changes. Those oil changes kept truckers moving on down the to provide care for travelers through their convenience stores,\n\nhighway, and it kept money in the coffers of Bosselman. Technology to offer Drivers and the motoring public hotels and food as they\n\nhas changed all that. Technology has extended the intervals between move along the nation’s highways. This diversity is what Charlie\n\noil changes, and that has had a significant impact on the truck most cares about. “People think we’re just one truck stop, but\n\nservice side of the business. “We’ve had to re-focus,” said Charlie. we take care of a large customer base; over-the-road truckers,\n\n“We’ve actively taken on the challenge to help Drivers through grandma and grandpa at the restaurant, Drivers and travelers at\n\nour on-the-road services.
