Irrigation brought with it the ability to weather droughts. Agriculture income remains the primary base of the community. Downtown Elwood was and still is the hub of the community. From the cooperative grocery store, banks, and gas stations, to the medical clinic and insurance businesses, there is always something going on. Elwood\n\nhomes and businesses. Soon, a clamor rose to move the Gosper County seat away from the âcurrentâ community of Homerville, an inland town that had been by-passed by the railroad, to the up-and-coming village of Elwood. Ultimately, Elwood was selected as the Gosper County seat. The buildings and homes in Homerville were moved nine miles north, across the hills to Elwood. The population of Elwood steadily rose, and then took a jump in 1940 when the town was filled with construction workers\n\nThe town of Elwood, the Gosper County seat and home to Johnson Lake and the Elwood Reservoir, is surrounded by lush pastures filled with cattle and table-like irrigated fields full of grain. It is hard to imagine how the area appeared in May 1885 when the railroad and land company decided to start a town at this location. Elwood became a terminal for the railroad when a roundhouse was built on the west edge of the town. People flocked to the area and began to build\n\nWE MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR YOU!

A.C. Tilley, who succeeded Johnson as Centralâs general manager in 1947, said the lake also serves as a secondary source of water in case of a âcalamityâ along the Supply Canal that might interrupt the flow of water to the hydroplants as well as a ready source of irrigation water for almost 50,000 acres of farmland along the Phelps Canal when irrigation demand suddenly increases. Tilley added that the lake can also serve as a âcatch basinâ for flows in the Supply Canal when rain storms temporarily halt demand for irrigation water. Development of that potential started slowly. The large body of water that gradually appeared in the lake turned the minds of many in neighboring towns to the possibility of recreational development. A number of area sportsmen, including Neil Shreck of Bertrand, Claude Smith and Judge J.S. Fitzsimmons of Elwood (Smith and Fitzsimmons were original members of Centralâs board of directors) and a Mr. Bracken from Lexington, formed a wildlife preservation committee to make Johnson Lake âa spot to be enjoyed\n\nside of the basin began in 1939 and was completed in 1940. Soon after, water from Lake McConaughy was diverted from the Platte River below the city of North Platte into Centralâs 75.6-mile- long Supply Canal and the process of filling Johnson Lake for the first time began. When full, the lake covered 2,230 surface acres within 13 miles of shoreline and held almost 50,000 acre- feet of water (enough water to cover 50,000 acres with 12 inches of water). In places, the water reached depths of more than 50 feet. The lake was named for George E. Johnson, Centralâs chief engineer. Johnson played a vital role in the promotion and design of the project from 1915 until its approval in 1935. He then became chief engineer and general manager of the project during its construction and subsequent operation. The lake that bears his name is an important component of Centralâs project. As a regulating reservoir for the Johnson No. 1 and Johnson No. 2 (J-1 and J-2) Hydroplants, the lake converts the uniform flow in the canal above the reservoir into the variable flow\n\nAn Abridged History of Johnson Lake by Jeff Buettner, Government & Public Relations Manager, The Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District The area now covered by Johnson Lake was once a low-lying basin surrounded by gently sloping hills. The land, used mostly for pasturing livestock, was dotted with a few structures, including a rural school house (known as the Antelope School) and a couple farmsteads. The construction of The Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation Districtâs huge irrigation and hydroelectric project -- anchored by Kingsley Dam and Lake McConaughy and spanning Nebraska from Keith County to Adams County-- began in 1936 and would change the landscape in the area. During the surveying process that preceded construction, Centralâs engineers determined that a site southeast of Lexington was ideally suited for construction of a regulating reservoir and two hydroplants. Construction of the dam on the south\n\nCall for Tee Times â¢ 308.785.2818 Visitors & new members are always welcome! 74839 Highway 283 â¢ Elwood, NE 68937 www.playlakeside.com\n\n7\n\nJohnson Lakeâs History\n\nG.V. Reynolds of Overton claimed in a 1965 newspaper article to have placed the second permanent structure at the lake in the early 1940âs. The home was moved from Overton to a site adjacent to what is now Crappie Corner. âA mighty deserted-looking area then,â according to Dr. Reynolds. âNo trees, no water, no plumbing, just a simple cabin on a sandy knoll.â More cabins soon followed, their owners coming from longer distances despite the difficulties posed by gasoline rationing. After the war ended and resources again became available, the pace of development increased. The boom in cabin-building was said to have started in about 1950 and a cabin sprung up on almost every available and suitable lot. By 1964 there were 548 cabins on the lakeâs shore, ranging from one-room structures to more elaborate homes costing as much as $15,000. The number of cabins surpassed 600 by 1966 and another 36 lots in the North Cove, North Shore and Perch Bay areas were ready for development in 1969. Interest was unabated as more than 400 applications were entered into a\n\nas Medoâs Resort. Butch and Ellen Stevens later acquired the lease and operated Stevens Cabins until selling it to Allen and Naomi Hudson in 1957. The Hudsons operated the business as Johnson Lake Resort until 1963 when Harry and Reba Collins acquired and operated the facility as Collins Resort. The Collins in turn sold the resort to Clinton and Roesetha Mutchie in 1968. Ownership then passed to Elmer Bergman (Bergmanâs Resort), Greg Medo, and then Shannon and Stafford Thompson, before returning to Medo in 2002. The Nebraska State Game, Forestation and Parks Commission (now known as the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission) first stocked the lake with game fish in 1941, although fishing was prohibited for the first year to allow the fish to grow and reproduce. Fishing became instantly popular when it was first permitted on July 1, 1942. The first true âcabinâ on the lake was reportedly constructed by S.E. Salisbury in 1942. It was described as a one-room, wood-frame building on Sandy Point. Cliff Hurliss and Dr.\n\nby everyone who desires to use it.â Included in the committeeâs plans were a public boat dock and beautification plans for the shoreline that would include tree and shrub planting. By 1950, boats were common on the lake, but almost all were small wooden or aluminum fishing boats powered by five- and ten-horsepower motors. By the early â60âs, larger crafts constructed of fiberglass with 50- and 60-hp motors were seen much more frequently on the lake. The experience of owning a cabin at the lake was simply not complete without a boat, and the number of boats swelled rapidly during the 1960âs. As evidence, a group of cabin- owners from Grand Island cooperated on construction of a boat dock that extended two blocks out into the lake and could accommodate as many as 32 boats. During the first several years of the lakeâs existence, Central permitted only one âconcession standâ at the lake, an establishment operated by a Mr. Remmenga from Elwood. The business was located on the east side of the lake on the site of what is now known\n\nSERVING DAWSON COUNTY\n\nSINCE 1960\n\nLevanderâs of Lexington 2809 Heartland Road, Lexington, NE 68850 Office: 308-217-0695\n\nDanâs Sanitation 324-6693 â¢ Lexington\n\n8\n\nJohnson Lakeâs History\n\ndestination of many fishermen, campers, boaters, swimmers and picnickers seeking relief from their cares. In 1945, Central leased 50 acres of land to the Nebraska Game, Forestations and Parks Commission for what would become the Johnson Lake State Recreation Area. The treeless landscape became the site of one of the state agencyâs first endeavors into tree-planting and the construction of its first recreation access road. A second camping area was added on the west side of the lake in the 1950âs. Water sports, particularly water skiing, began to become popular in the late 1950s and continued through the next three decades. Lake residents reported that it seemed like everyone at the lake was learning to ski in the 1960âs. A project to create additional lakefront property began in 1970 with a dredging operation in the northwest corner of the lake. The result was the Lakeview Acres sub- division surrounding Mahaffie Bay. Developers led by Virgil Eihusen of Grand Island created 169 residential and six commercial lots in the area. Subsequently, George and Delores Harder of Grand Island opened the Lakeview Marina in 1971, offering groceries, bait and tackle, as well as a cafe, laundromat, boat slips and boat rental. During the same time period, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission was also improving its facilities. The NGPC added three modern restrooms, six shelter houses and two change rooms to its campground on the east side of the lake in 1969 at a cost of $25,000. Also that year, the lake was\n\ncompletely encircled with a paved road for the first time when 4.3 miles of asphalt was laid. Several other stretches of road around the lake had previously been paved, mostly by cabin- owners who agreed to fund construction through paving assessments. A couple of other noteworthy events in the early 1960âs included the opening of a nine-hole golf course -- then known as the Lexington Golf Club -- below the dam in 1963. The owners of the Lexington golf course sold the land on which the course was situated because of construction of Interstate 80. With the money from the sale, they purchased land at Johnson Lake and built a new course. Nine more holes were added to the course in 1990. Over the years, cabin-owners and thousands upon thousands of campers and daily visitors have enjoyed their leisure time at Johnson Lake. From the earliest days, newspapers ran photos of fishermen with their stringers straining under the weight of the dayâs catch. The stories that accompanied the photos either told of the fight to land the huge catch, or recounted the inevitable story of âthe big one that got away.â Other photos showed sailboat regattas, water skiers, campers, picnickers, swimmers and sunbathers, all brought together by the lure of the water. Johnson Lake continues to be one of the most popular destinations for recreation in Nebraska and a key component in the operation of Centralâs hydro-irrigation project. Its construction and development are a testament not only to the men who designed and built the project, but to those who realized and cultivated its potential for recreation.\n\nlottery for the three dozen lots. By 1971 the number of cabins exceeded 700 and many cabin-owners had taken up year-round residence at the lake. Today homes and cabins entirely encircle the lake and number above 900. Development of the cabin areas was overseen by the Johnson Lake Development, Inc., which was formed in 1941. Central -- its agenda dominated by the task of operating its fledgling power and irrigation project, facing an exploding demand for irrigation water and electricity, and hampered by a shortage of manpower and recreational expertise -- leased Johnson, Plum Creek and Gallagher Canyon lakes for development of recreational assets. The aim of the group was to appoint directors from every city in the area that might be interested in the water recreation available at the lakes. Johnson Lake soon became the\n\nDawson County Historical Museum\n\nExcellence in Rehabilitation\n\n805 N.

In the summer of 1962, the idea of a church to service the people who come to the lake to enjoy its many recreational activities was discussed among several cabin owners. Fourteen persons gathered at a cabin on Sandy Point one Sunday morning for an informal service with a Methodist minister preaching from a rocking chair. As others heard of the services the interest and enthusiasm grew. For the remainder of\n\nthat summer, services were held in the former Camp Fire Girls cabin on Mallard Beach with between 80 and 85 attending. Realizing the need for a permanent meeting place, a committee was formed. They purchased the original chapel building from the Latter Day Saints in Eustis. It was moved to the present location in 1963. The bell, pews and reed organ were also added that year. The first service in the little chapel at its present location was on June 2, 1963 and was attended by\n\n83 persons. Since that day, services have been held every summer beginning Memorial Day weekend and continuing through the Labor Day weekend. To date, the total attendance for 59 years has reached 143,919 worshipers representing many denominations. Worshipers come from all over Nebraska, numerous states and occasionally from countries outside the United States. Visitors are asked to register once each season and share where they reside. Services begin at 8:30\n\na.m. Sunday with a guest minister bringing the message each week. In addition to the regular Sunday morning services, the Chapel is used for weddings and funerals plus numerous lake related meetings from mid-May through mid-September. The Chapel of the Lake is supervised by the Chapel Committee whose members have included volunteers from both permanent and summer residents of the lake. Anyone wishing to use the Chapel can contact the present chairman at 308-785- 2287 to discuss any rent fees and availability of the chapel. The Chapel is self-supporting through generous weekly collections, donations and memorials. The Chapel Committee wishes to thank all persons who have given of their gifts, time and talents to this ministry through the years. A special THANKS goes to the ushers, the presiding laymen, the organists and those providing special music each Sunday. Come to a service and return again to worship and enjoy the fellowship at the beautiful lake setting. After attending you will leave with a prayer in your heart thanking God for the many blessings he has bestowed upon us.\n\n#41 BEST COURSE YOU CAN PLAY 2022 Golf Week\n\nHere for all your HVAC and Electrical needs!\n\nfrae68850@gmail.com (308) 324-4018 https://www.facebook.com/FRAE68850/\n\n40950R d . 768 â¢ P.O.

The House on the Hill Bed & Breakfast & Catering holds classes\n\nranging from crafting to cooking to gardening.

Lighthouses at Johnson Lake Johnson Lake is fortunate to have two Lighthouses: One at the Mallard Beach jetty and one at the Lakeview Acres jetty. The Lakeview Acres Lighthouse was dedicated on July 4th, 2021 at a special ribbon-cutting ceremony. A dedication speech was written and delivered by Cinde Wendell, who was instrumental in organizing and collecting funds for the lighthouse. âOur Lighthouse began by forming a committee at the Lakeview Acres annual meeting in 2019 and grew to be an entire Johnson Lake project. All the planning, fundraising and installation happened during the\n\nwhile playing games with family or friends. Come join in the FUN by boat or vehicle, located next to Lakeshore Marina.

Our black and white lighthouse is the second lighthouse at Johnson Lake with the first red and white one on Mallard Beach. The Mallard Beach Lighthouse is a replica of Montauk Lighthouse in New York . The Mallard Bay light house organizers where extremely helpful with blazing a trail for this lighthouse as well as their unending support. The Lighthouse Digest, a national publication, plans to do a story on the Johnson Lake lighthouses. Thank you to Johnson Lake Chamber of Commerce, Central Nebraska Irrigation\n\nFoundation, the Mallard Bay Lighthouse Committee, JLDI, Lakeshore Marina & Nautical Rose for allowing access, Lakeview Acres, and all the support from all around the lake with donations, letters and encouragement. This lighthouse quote seems fitting for todayâ¦ âDonât forget that maybe you are the lighthouse in someoneâs storm.â --Unknown author Finally, this project has turned out to be a positive beacon during a dark, pandemic time. May the lighthouse always serve as a shining example of hope for all of us.

The Johnson Lake Chamber of Commerce has been busy organizing the\n\nBoat Parade.\n\ndecorated boats gather at the Marina Bay. The parade then makes its way around the lake for all to see as the crowd on shore clap and wave their flags with appreciation. Every year decorated boats are over the top with creative and clever themes. At the conclusion of the parade prizes are awarded by the Johnson Lake Chamber. As the day continues, you can see many boats anchor in the shallow water by the\n\nisland as people enjoy music, wading, swimming and merriment! The aroma of hamburgers\n\nAs darkness falls on the evening of the 3rd of July, people gather from surrounding areas, campgrounds and\n\non the grills, sounds of firecrackers, laughter,\n\nneighborhoods and watch as hundreds of boats make their way to the dam area where the fireworks are displayed. The beautiful fireworks and their reflection in the lake is a sight to behold. Mid-morning on the 4th, the creativity of many boat owners comes to life as the\n\nspeeding watercraft and splashing of the wakes on the shoreline combine to make yet another year of 4th of July cherished memories with family and friends.
