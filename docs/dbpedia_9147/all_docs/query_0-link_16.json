That would be a criticism for me, but I really like that every team plays every other team twice. The bye weeks are weird in that there are three weeks where six teams are off. Honestly though, I'm starting to get excited about the season!\n\nPost by afrats on\n\nThe only thing that 't like about the schedule is that Colorado is no longer on it.\n\nPost by Nevadanut on\n\nWhich teams are SCtoC covering this year?\n\nWe're still working on that. Ideally, all of them.\n\nPost by Nevadanut on\n\nI would also say that I am looking forward to week 4 when Bloomington and West Michigan play each other. I think that'll be fun to follow."
