        "text": "Mike McCarthy - McCarthy Capital, Omaha\n\nMike McCarthy is the founder of McCarthy Capital, a private equity firm headquartered in Omaha since its founding in 1986. After graduating from St. John’s University (Minnesota) in 1973, McCarthy returned to his hometown in western Iowa to start a small construction firm, eventually expanding into developing real estate and investing in operating businesses. After moving to Omaha with his wife, Nancy, and four children, he and his co-founder, Rich Jarvis, opened an investment bank focused on funding small businesses.\n\nMcCarthy also began a long career of community involvement, serving on boards like the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, the Omaha Community Foundation, United Way of the Midlands, the Omaha Zoological Society, Creighton University and other nonprofit organizations. He serves as a board member of Lasting Hope Recovery Center and chair of the Heritage Services board of directors. He continues as an active chairman of Bridges Trust while serving on the boards of Peter Kiewit Sons’, Inc., Union Pacific Corporation, Election Systems & Software and McCarthy Group, LLC.\n\nMike and Nancy were honored as 2012 United Way Citizens of the Year, and he was inducted into the Omaha Business Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nJohn Sampson - Sampson Construction, Lincoln\n\nJohn Sampson was born in Hastings, Nebraska, and moved to Lincoln with his parents and five siblings at an early age. A Lincoln High School graduate, he earned his bachelor's degree in construction management from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1972. After graduation, he married his high school sweetheart, April Crossgrove and began working in the family business with his parents and brothers. At that time, Sampson Construction built custom homes and a few small commercial projects, and business was conducted on the dining room table of the Sampson home.\n\nIn 1995, Sampson became president of the business and the company began to grow rapidly under his leadership, a result of the risk he took on larger, more complicated projects. He incorporated innovative technologies and practices to grow and provide leading-edge services to clients while preserving the Nebraska value that “business is done with a handshake and a promise” instilled in him by his parents. In his time as president, Sampson Construction’s portfolio of work has been comprised of large commercial projects including hospitals, schools, retail stores, worship spaces, manufacturing facilities, sporting venues and commercial office buildings. The company has five offices in Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado, projects in 16 states and proudly employs more than 350 full-time employees.\n\nSampson received the 2013 Burnham Yates Citizenship Award from the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce. He generously supports higher education and healthcare organizations, among many others. In 2010, he donated labor and materials to the City of Lincoln to modernize Sherman Field to ensure kids across the city could have top-tier facilities in which to play baseball and softball. He also donated more than 28 acres of land to Bryan Health to build the April Sampson Cancer Center, a world-class cancer treatment center.\n\nAs Sampson Construction celebrates 70 years of business, he remains a visionary leader and mentor to his family’s business and an avid champion and supporter of his employees. A big proponent of family first, the company has employed numerous families and their relatives under his leadership. He and his late wife have one daughter, Cori Vokoun, and her husband, Dan Vokoun. Sampson and his wife Toni Thorson live in Lincoln.\n\nGloria Thesenvitz - Nova-Tech, Inc., Grand Island\n\nGloria Thesenvitz is founder and chairman of the board of Nova-Tech, Inc., a nationally recognized company providing custom aseptic fill manufacturing services and private label IV fluids to the animal health industry throughout the United States and Canada.\n\nGrounded in her rural Nebraska roots and following her graduation from Wood River High School, Thesenvitz achieved her dream of being a wife, mother and farmer. Throughout the next 18 years, she farmed and spent those early formative years with her four children. When that relationship and career choice dissolved, she utilized her knowledge of growing and marketing cattle to examine alternative agriculture crops.\n\nUtilizing tenacity and entrepreneurship, she founded Nova-Tech in 1988. The first product line, animal serums, are nutritional elements for the growth of cells invitro. Applying a pragmatic philosophy, she surrounded herself with knowledgeable people. Maintaining Nova-Tech CGMP Compliance in the manufacture of injectable fluid therapy products provided Nova-Tech the pathway to be where it is today. Under her leadership, the company focused on staying current with technological advancements and marketplace trends which set the stage for Nova-Tech to be an integrated asset to their customer.\n\nIn 2011, the site transfer of manufacturing into a new plant located in the Platte Valley Industrial Tract in Grand Island laid the foundation for three additions and brought significant growth through increased production and technical capabilities.

The instruments Bill Biggs and his university colleagues developed would eventually revolutionize the technology used for plant science research worldwide.\n\nBiggs earned his master’s degree in 1969 and spent two years at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico. His work on imaging systems for satellites fueled a desire to start a scientific instrument company incorporating optics with electronics.\n\nIn 1971, Bill and Elaine Biggs and his colleagues from the original university project formally launched the company that would become LI-COR Biosciences. They started with two products, 400 square feet of borrowed workspace and the help of a part-time employee.\n\nWhile launching a new company was not easy, he believes the best thing that happened to him was a total “burnout” he experienced in 1976 after years of working seven days a week. The burnout led to a nine-year bout with depression. During that time, he became a born-again Christian and focusing seriously on his faith led to his recovery.\n\nUntil 1981, Elaine worked full time doing everything from keeping the books to helping assemble and ship products. Today, she remains on the board serving as corporate secretary.\n\nLI-COR is a leading provider of technology for measuring global climate change and an innovator in the areas of genetic and cancer research. The majority of the company’s 300 employees work on LI-COR’s 24-acre campus in Lincoln, Nebraska. There are also offices in Germany and the United Kingdom with representatives worldwide.\n\nThe success of the company reflects Bill’s philosophy of applying solid engineering and science with innovative thinking to create groundbreaking technology. LI-COR products are in use on every continent and on the International Space Station.\n\nBill’s deep Christian foundation led him to pray with some LI-COR team members for company direction. Through prayer, LI-COR went into new fields such as DNA sequencing and protein analysis leading to the development of near-infrared fluorescent dyes that have medical applications. One product has shown in clinical trials to kill cancer cells when illuminated with near-infrared light.\n\nBill and Elaine were married in 1960. They have two children, Greg (June) Biggs, and Lori (Pat) Humphrey, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n\nHoward L. Hawks - Tenaska, Omaha\n\nHoward L. Hawks\n\nWatch Video on Howard L.
