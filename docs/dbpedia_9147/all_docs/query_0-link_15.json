For the upcoming 2011 season the league has 22 teams in 14 different U.S. states, it is currently the world's largest professional indoor football league. Its two largest competitors are the Arena Football League and the American Indoor Football Association.\n\nHistory[]\n\nFormation of the league[]\n\nThe merger which formed the new IFL was announced the day before the 2008 National Indoor Bowl Championship, a game which pitted the champions of the two leagues against each other. The Sioux Falls Storm (United) defeated the Louisiana Swashbucklers (Intense) 54 to 42.\n\n2009 Season[]\n\nOf the 17 teams involved in the two previous leagues, 14 carried over to the new organization's 2009 season. An additional 3 teams came over from the CIFL and two expansion teams began their life in the new IFL. In the 2009 IFL United Bowl, the Billings Outlaws (Intense Conference) took the league championship by defeating the River City Rage (United Conference) by a score of 71 to 62.\n\n2010 Season[]\n\nAfter losing two teams to attrition after the end of the 2009 season, and a third in January 2010, the IFL then added an additional nine franchises to boost its membership to twenty-five for the 2010 season. Three of the new teams were expansion franchises. Two moved over from the Southern Indoor Football League and Continental Indoor Football League. Four teams were members of the now defunct AF2 that chose to join the IFL instead of aligning with the newly formed AF1. After playing 9 games of the 2010 season the Alaska Wild suspended operations, leaving only 24 teams to finish the year.\n\nIn the 2010 IFL United Bowl, the Billings Outlaws (Intense Conference) took the league championship by defeating the Sioux Falls Storm (United Conference) by a score of 43 to 34.\n\n2011 Season[]\n\nSeven new teams were added to the IFL for the 2011 season. Some of these were new expansion teams, and others moved to the IFL from the AIFA. The IFL also lost nine teams during the offseason, bringing the total number to twenty-two for 2011.\n\nCurrent Teams[]\n\nUnited Conference[]\n\nAtlantic Division[]\n\nTeam Location Arena (Capacity) *Lehigh Valley Steelhawks Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Stabler Arena (6,000) *Reading Express Reading, Pennsylvania Sovereign Center (7,083) Richmond Revolution Richmond, Virginia Arthur Ashe Athletic Center (3,312)\n\nGreat Lakes Division[]\n\nTeam Location Arena (Capacity) Bloomington Extreme Bloomington, Illinois U.S. Cellular Coliseum (7,000) Chicago Slaughter Hoffman Estates, Illinois Sears Centre (9,500) Green Bay Blizzard Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin Resch Center (8,621) La Crosse Spartans La Crosse, Wisconsin La Crosse Center (5,083)\n\nGreat Plains Division[]\n\nTeam Location Arena (Capacity) *Nebraska Danger Grand Island, Nebraska Eihusen Arena (7,500) Omaha Beef Omaha, Nebraska Omaha Civic Auditorium (9,300) Sioux Falls Storm Sioux Falls, South Dakota Sioux Falls Arena (4,700) Wichita Wild Park City, Kansas Hartman Arena (5,000)\n\nIntense Conference[]\n\nLonestar Division[]\n\nTeam Location Arena (Capacity) *Allen Wranglers Allen, Texas Allen Event Center (6,275) Amarillo Venom Amarillo, Texas Amarillo Civic Center (5,000) *Oklahoma City Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Cox Convention Center (13,231) West Texas Roughnecks Odessa, Texas Ector County Coliseum (5,131)\n\nMountain West Division[]\n\nTeam Location Arena (Capacity) *Arizona Adrenaline Prescott Valley, Arizona Tim's Toyota Center (5,100) Colorado Ice Loveland, Colorado Budweiser Events Center (7,200) *Wyoming Cavalry Casper, Wyoming Casper Events Center (8,395)\n\nPacific Division[]\n\nTeam Location Arena (Capacity) Fairbanks Grizzlies Fairbanks, Alaska Carlson Center (4,595) Kent Predators Kent, Washington ShoWare Center (6,500) Tri-Cities Fever Kennewick, Washington Toyota Center (5,970) *Wenatchee Valley Venom Wenatchee, Washington Town Toyota Center (4,300)\n\n* = New team/city for IFL in 2011.\n\nFormer Teams[]\n\nLeft for another league[]\n\nAbilene Ruff Riders - Left IFL after 2010 season, now a member of the Southern Indoor Football League\n\nCorpus Christi Hammerheads - Left IFL after 2010 season, now a member of the Southern Indoor Football League [1]\n\nLouisiana Swashbucklers - Left IFL prior to inaugural season, now a member of the Southern Indoor Football League [2]\n\nSaginaw Sting - Left for the Ultimate Indoor Football League after sitting out the 2010 season.

[8]\n\nIFL United Bowl Championship[]\n\nThe IFL continues to use the \"United Bowl\" name originally used by United Indoor Football. The UIF used this name before they merged with Intense Football League to form the Indoor Football League. The UIF held United Bowl I, II, III, and IV in 2005 through 2008, with all four being won by the Sioux Falls Storm.\n\nAnother piece of history about the United Bowl name is that the United Football League, an outdoor league founded in 2009, was planning on using the name for its championship game, but the IFL retained the trademark to the name so that the UFL couldn't use it. The IFL had to continue using the name in some form, and though the name \"National Indoor Bowl Championship\" was used for the 2008 contest between the UIF and the Intense Football League, the \"United Bowl\" name continues to be used for the combined league's championship instead.\n\n2009 United Bowl Championship[]\n\nThe 2009 IFL United Bowl featured the Intense Conference champs, the Billings Outlaws, against the upset-minded United Conference River City Rage. The game became a scoring onslaught at the start of the 1st quarter with each team scoring touchdowns. The Outlaw defense snagged a pick in the 2nd quarter which led to another offensive touchdown and a commanding two score lead by halftime. The Rage fought back though, recovering an onside kick at the beginning of the 3rd quarter and driving the ball the length of the field for a touchdown. That would be the closest the game would get for the Rage. The Outlaws would put up just enough points to keep a comfortable lead throughout the fourth and after recovering an onside kick in the last minute of the game, the Outlaws kneeled the ball and took home the crown with a score of 71-62 in a loud, sold out Rimrock Auto Arena.\n\n2010 United Bowl Championship[]\n\nIn the 2010 IFL United Bowl, the Billings Outlaws (Intense Conference) took the league championship by defeating the Sioux Falls Storm (United Conference) by a score of 43 to 34.\n\nYear-By-Year[]\n\nYear Home Team Away Team Winner Score 2009 Billings Outlaws RiverCity Rage Outlaws 71-62 2010 Billings Outlaws Sioux Falls Storm Outlaws 43-34\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial website\n\nAnnouncement of new league's formation\n\nIFL Merger media guide"
