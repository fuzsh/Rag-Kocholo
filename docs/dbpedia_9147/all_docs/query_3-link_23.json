The One Hundred Ninth Annual Report. With gratitude to the great Head of the Church for signal fav- ors during the year the Board of Home Missions presents to the General Assembly its one hundred ninth Annual Report. The Board sorrowfully records the death during the year of three of its members : Mr. T. H. Perrin, who died July twenty-fifth, 1910; Mr. H. Edwards Rowland, who died January ninth, 191 1 ; Mr. Calvin B. Orcutt, who died January thirtieth, 191 1. Mr. Perrin was one of the Cumberland representatives on this Board ; living in the West he was seldom able to be present, but always manifested a deep interest in our work. Mr. Rowland was for many years a member of the House Committee and chairman of the Auditing Committee. Mr. Orcutt was a member of the Finance Committee and chair- man of the Committee on Church and Labor. They were faithful and beloved, and the Board records its grateful appreciation of the services they rendered. Also during the year the following missionaries have been called to their reward : — Rev. A. S. Blackwood Stephenville, Texas. Rev. L. J. Braswell ... Dyer, Tennessee. Rev. John Cairns Cram St. Thomas, North Dakota. Rev. Joseph S. Gibb Waltham. Massachusetts. Rev. Angus McKenzie Vancouver, Washington. Rev. Tomas V. Martinez Toa Alta, Porto Rico. Rev. Andrew N. Moore Purcell, North Dakota. Rev. Jedidiah S. Onion Minnewaukon, North Dakota. FINANCES. The total receipts of the year were $1,192,859.59. There has not been much increase in the income from the churches and socie- ties, due in large measure, perhaps entirely, to the urgent calls for local work made necessary by the tides of immigration that have invaded so many of our eastern communities. Our income from legacies, aside from the great Kennedy gift, has been $180,- 101.88. During the year the Board received two million ninety-nine thousand dollars of the munificent legacy from Mr. Kennedy, announced in our last Report. The Church has the 4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [I9II« right to know the use to which the Board will put this fund. It has adopted the following paper expressive of its purpose, which we hope will meet the commendation of the Church at large. THE KENNEDY FUND. The Board of Home Missions has given much serious thought to the wisest and most efficient use of the large bequest made to it by the late Mr. John S. Kennedy. Upon the recommendation of the Finance Committee at the meeting of the Board held in May, 1910, certain general principles as to the handling and use of the bequest were adopted by the Board. As the Board has just been put in receipt of the larger portion of this bequest it is proper that it should consider more in detail a plan for the con- serving and use of this large amount of money. With great heartiness and devout gratitude the Board again puts on record its deepest appreciation not only of the largeness of the gift which Mr. Kennedy has made to the Board of Home Missions, but also of the true-hearted spirit of stewardship which influenced Mr. Kennedy in disposing of his estate. The Board would also make mention of its deep appreciation of the fact that Mr. Kennedy saw fit to give his money to the Board not for an endowment nor in any way conditioned. Undoubtedly this broad-mindedness was due to the fact that Mr. Kennedy was for many years a member of this Board and learned by experi- ence the wisdom of committing even large sums of money to the Board without condition, in the fullest confidence that the Board and the Church would make the best use of it according to the time and need. The Board of Home Missions would endeavor fully to merit this confidence and desires the needed wisdom to enable it adequately to meet the great expectations which Mr. Kennedy so warmly cherished. Care is to be taken in the handling of this large bequest so as to stimulate the Church to a similar vision of duty and opportun- ity which Mr. Kennedy had to so marked a degree. The Board should avoid such an administration of it as would encourage on the part of needy churches an undue dependence upon the aid of the Board ; rather should such churches be persuaded to do larger things for themselves. Since the wiping out of the heavy debt a dozen years ago, un- der which the Board struggled so long, it has followed a policy of economy which has compelled it to pay salaries wholly insufficient for the missionaries to live upon. The Board has also been compelled to decline entering upon many new and promising fields lest either the salaries of missionaries now employed should be further reduced, or a heavy and cumbersome debt incurred which would not be approved by the Church. The following facts have claimed attention. An amount of I9I I.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 5 work has recently come on the Board far in excess of its normal income. It appears in four principal directions : — 1. The inflow of immigrants, imposing an instant and large obligation upon the Church of Christ, an obligation which must be promptly met. The budget for this item for 1911-1912 is six- ty-five thousand dollars. This is a wholly inadequate provision. It may properly be increased, however, indefinitely as competent ministers are secured for this particular work. 2. The rapid extension of western work. The last census shows marvelous increase in population in the far West, in three of the states exceeding one hundred per cent. Conditions for weal or woe are crystallizing with a rapidity never known before in nearly all the West, the Northwest and the Southwest. Calls for help this year far surpass those of any preceding year, being one hundred forty thousand dollars in excess of a year ago. The old rate of missionary advance, therefore, will not match the new conditions. Religious destitution in many sections is alarming. In Colorado there are a hundred villages and settlements of from one hundred fifty to a thousand population without any Christian ministrations — Protestant or Catholic. In greater or less meas- ure this doubtless holds in a dozen other states. 3. The city problem must be faced. It involves large expendi- ture. The scope and methods of past missionary enterprise must be succeeded by a comprehensive scientific study of the problem, and an outlay of money and a use of men commensurate with the grave issues at stake. It is said that in San Francisco in a population of one-half million there are only twelve thousand Protestant church members. In New York City, where a positive proportionate decrease of Protestant church members in the past decade is revealed, the present percentage of church members is 8.55 in a population of 4,447,883. Other departments of the Board's activity not included in the above schedule, such as that of Church and Labor, Church and Country Life and the Indian Department, also call for greatly in- creased expenditure. 4. The present salaries of missionaries are a discredit to the Church and a hindrance to the increase of the ministry. There are four hundred forty-three home missionaries whose total sal- ary does not exceed eight hundred dollars per annum. If these salaries were at once raised to eight hundred dollars it would be necessary for the Board of Home Missions to grant $185,844.00 in addition to the amount raised on the field. Missionary ser- vice calls for the best men. We cannot hope to call or hold them on salaries below the plainest living. Therefore the Board proposes as one line of advance to seek such increase of salaries as present business conditions demand, as the dignity of the min- istry and the honor of the Church require, and the ability of the Board may permit. 6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [I911- With these main ends in view the Board will need for several years to come an annual income of at least three hundred thirty thousand dollars in excess of the average of the past five years. The Board therefore proposes as follows : — We have received two million two hundred fifty thousand dollars and further payments will increase the total sum by an amount not now known, but probably less than a quarter of a mil- lion. The income from this total will be something over one hundred thousand dollars a year. The Board has decided to use in current work ; first, the inter- est income from the legacy; and, second, in a series of years so much of the principal as the meeting of this important responsi- bility of our Church may require. It is the purpose of the Board to devote this money in the fol- lowing directions indicated above, subject to such changes of proportion as circumstances may in the judgment of the Board require, as follows : — 1. It is likely one hundred thousand dollars may be required an- nually for advance work in the newer regions of the country and in the cities. 2. An indefinite sum annually for the increase of missionaries' salaries. As it is proposed to increase salaries only as the presby- teries and churches concerned shall cooperate, the churches as- suming a proportion of the additional amount, this sum cannot be definitely determined. It will be a process of education. Less will be called for during the first years ; more afterward, as the need for it and the feasibility of it shall come to be realized by the churches. 3. A further sum is to be used in hospital, school and church equipment, as the judgment of the Board may from time to time determine. There is an increasing call for such build- ings largely in excess of the Home Board's and the Woman's Board's treasuries to provide, and these Boards have not been able to keep in proper repair the buildings now owned be- cause the current funds were more than exhausted before the item of repairs was adequately provided for. In no case, however, would the Board think of making a bulk appropri- ation for any new property. Its policy is to get the largest local subscriptions possible; then to make general and special ap- peals to the Church, and after that to make a grant out of its funds. But fifty thousand dollars per year for new buildings and for repairs would be a moderate estimate of need. The Board is deeply sensible of the increased responsibility it assumes in the administration of this sacred fund ; but it humbly believes that the Providence which has enabled it thus to provide for an expansion of work forced upon it by an almost sudden convergence of opportunities will guide it to the best ways of I9I I.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 7 discharging its duty to the Church and to the memory of the man who had vision to see what Israel ought to do. This partial meeting of immediate issues is rendered possible by the insight and devotion of one man. These issues are only enlarged and rendered more definite by his munificence. The foundations thus laid must be built upon by those with similar devotion. KANSAS CITY CONFERENCE. In February the secretaries of the Board with the field secre- taries, synodical missionaries and pastor-evangelists held a two days' conference in Kansas City, Missouri, in the consideration of home mission problems, and especially of the plan of pastor- evangelists inaugurated a few years ago. Varying opinions from different parts of the field made it necessary that there should be a careful induction of facts, study of conditions and formulation of such policy as facts and conditions should indicate. The con- clusions reached by the conference may be summarized as fol- lows : — The plan of pastor-evangelists has developed so much success and gives such definite promise that it will be wise to continue it as a policy of the Board. The general field administration by large districts and secre- taries in charge of them directly responsible to the Board is also increasingly justified. A general demand for synodical organization appeared justified and required by the increasing volume and variety of home mis- sion work throughout the country. In view of the policy thus announced the Board is this year continuing, and in somewhat stronger force, its work and service of pastor-evangelists. In some parts of the field they are presby- terial — recommended by the presbyteries and commissioned by the Home Board for presbyterial service under the direction of the home mission committee. In other synods where a synodical organization has become effective they are synodical officers un- der the direction of the synodical home mission committee. The plan has now been in operation long enough and sufficient- ly well organized to justify the expectation that it will result in the quickening of churches, in the ingathering of people, and in more effective organization of the entire missionary work of presbyteries and synods. HOME MISSIONS COUNCIL. The Home Missions Council now in the third year of its his- tory represents the fifteen principal denominations of the coun- try. It is trying to make a careful and systematic study of church 8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [iCjH- conditions throughout all the missionary field with a view to re- ducing waste and friction and securing cooperation in missionary efforts and federation in social and moral reforms. It cooperates thus with the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in Amer- ica in advancing on missionary ground the large ends for which that Council was organized. One of the fields of operation of the Council during the year has been its cooperation with many other religious bodies in pro- jecting or carrying out plans for a great missionary exhibit in Boston under the title, \"The World in Boston,\" different denom- inations to take different objects of the home mission propagan- da for their exhibit. That given to the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions was the Indian work of all the Protestant bodies. The Rev. Thomas C. Moffett, D. D., Superintendent of our In- dian Department, with the assistance of the Rev. W. B. Hum- phrey, has prepared an exhibit of Indian curios, life and mission work, which it is believed will constitute one of the most attract- ive features of the great exhibition. THE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON CHURCH EXTENSION. The interest of the Board of Home Missions in the Assembly's Advisory Council on Church Extension continues peculiarly strong. The Council held its annual meeting of 1910 in Novem- ber, the sessions convening in the offices of the Home Board. A full report of the action taken by the Council is presented directly to the General Assembly through the president, the Rev. W. T. Jaquess, D. D., of Michigan. The question of immigration, af- fecting particularly the Board's special Department of Immigra- tion, is always live in the discussions of the Council. Special at- tention is called to the action of the Council under this head as given in their report. The question of a more adequate salary standard was earnestly discussed. The Council put on record its hope that the system of supplementing salaries through missionary boxes may be dis- continued as speedily as possible, the salaries being brought to a proper standard independent of this method of supplement. A committee was appointed to consider the whole question of vacan- cy and supply with the hope that through a thorough study of the question some plan might be evolved by which the great shortage of adequately equipped men on the home mission field might be made up. THE DISTRICT OF THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST. For this section the Rev. B. P. Fullerton, D. D., LL. D., pre- sents the following statement : — The District of the South and Southwest covers that section of the country in which the Presbyterian Church in the United States is located. Immediately succeeding the union of the Presbyterian 191 1.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 9 Church in the United States of America, and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, there were those in the Presbyterian Church in the United States who felt that there was serious over- lapping and that the territory properly belonged to them. It is noticeable that this position is being abandoned and a better un- derstanding with the latter Church has been reached. An effort is being made to come to an agreement upon a comity basis where- by we can work side by side in Christian fellowship. The sincere efforts of the best men in both Churches are di- rected first of all toward the prevention of overlapping in new territory, and in the second place to exchanges of churches when possible in places where there are two churches and one is sufficient. Two presbyteries in the two Churches in Texas have come to an understanding and some exchanges have already been made, and there has been as a result a saving to both Churches in the expenditure of money and in the economy of men. In Florida, which is now a part of the Synod of Alabama, there is no place where the two Churches exist side by side. This is the result of an agreement made some years ago between the two Churches in Florida. If there has been a feeling in the Church at large that discredit has been brought upon our common Presbyterianism by the over- lapping of the two Churches in some places in the South, that same feeling is just as justifiable with respect to the North and East. But if there is overlapping in the South which cannot be prevented, much as it may be deplored, our Church, if it be true to its attitude on the subject of union, cannot leave these weaker churches in this section to shift for themselves or go into another denomination. They did not hold positive views on the subject of union, but when the courts of the Church decided in favor of it they were obedient to those in authority, and because of their loyalty have in some sections suffered not only social and ecclesi- astical ostracism, but the loss of thousands in property ; and to treat them now with scant attention simply because there is some over- lapping is to break a bruised reed and to open an already deep wound. Gifts from the district for home mission evangelization are not so large nor so widely distributed as is desirable or as they should be, but almost the entire district has been under heavy ex- pense, created in part by the readjustment incident to the union of the two Churches. Then these past few years have been a time of reorganization and it has been difficult for the people to find themselves and their strength and to give direction thereto. It is manifest, however, by the desire on the part of the people in this district to know the latest and best methods in the organ- ization and life of the church, that a better day is not far in the future. IO ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [I911- ALABAMA. The Rev. William B. Witherspoon, D. D., has been continued as the pastor-evangelist for three presbyteries of this synod. In addition the synod indorsed the Rev. W. M. Crawford as an evangelist, commended him to the churches within the synod and agreed to supplement the amount received from his evangelistic efforts by a specific amount to provide an adequate salary for him during the year ending April first, 191 1. The results of his work have not yet been tabulated and cannot be presented in this re- port. The uncertainty arising from litigation has been removed by the decision of the Supreme Court of the state favorable to the union, and work upon church buildings and manses, which has been delayed by reason of this, is now going forward. The churches in this synod are mostly in rural communities and organizations for aggressive work are difficult to form. How- ever, these have gone forward slowly and apparently with a good degree of hope. At the last meeting of the synod a plan of synodical organiza- tion was adopted by which it has become the duty of the synod's committee to review all presbyterial estimates before they are sent to the Board. This has brought the presbyteries into closer relationship and the chairmen of these presbyterial committees have been led to see the need of a closer oversight of the work in each presbytery and a larger sympathy between the presby- teries of the synod. Pastors have become more contented and settled in their work. During the latter part of January and the first part of Febru- ary a visit was made to the Presbytery of Florida, which in- cludes the entire state and is affiliated with the Synod of Ala- bama. This visit revealed the fact that in Florida there is an open door for our branch of the Presbyterian Church. The Presbytery has referred all home mission matters to its executive commission, which has been diligently at work upon the problem and hopes to present a better showing of the work in that state. ARKANSAS. The Rev. Jesse W. Hudiburg, pastor-evangelist for the Synod of Arkansas, resigned his work the first of January, 191 1, to become pastor at Mayfield, Kentucky. Mr. Hudiburg's work was eminently stimulating and helpful to the churches in that synod. The synod's committee has elected and the Board has commis- sioned the Rev. Charles E. Hayes, D. D., as successor to Mr. Hudiburg. Dr. Hayes comes to this work with ten years of ex- perience in the same work in the Synod of Illinois. He entered upon his work March first and the committee is greatly encour- aged at the prospect with him as its leader. I9I I.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. II The presbyterial boundaries have been rearranged and four presbyteries have been erected out of the seven heretofore within the synod. Strong men have taken important pastorates within the synod. Better system has been introduced in church life. By action of the last synod the home mission committee was made a home missions commission, and a plan for compact synodical organization was adopted, which puts a large part of the admin- istration of home mission work within the synod in the hands of this commission, respecting of course the rightful authority of presbyteries. All presbyterial estimates will be carefully re- viewed by the commission before being presented to the Board. The pastor-evangelist for the four presbyteries will be under the direction of the commission, to which reports will be made, and which, in cooperation with the field secretary, will take charge of home mission affairs within the state. The Supreme Court of this state decided the litigation growing out of the union favorable to union and that has removed one of the greatest obstacles in the way of progress within the synod. Repairs on church buildings have been halted ; new buildings have been waiting for this decision. Now that it has come a new spirit has taken hold of the men in the state and new plans are being adopted for a larger and more aggressive work in behalf of the cause. KANSAS. The Synod of Kansas, while self-supporting under the Board, requests that the relationship between it and the field secretary be not disturbed. At the last meeting of that synod the synodical home mission committee was made a synodical home mission commission. This commission has met with some difficulty in providing for the expense of the home mission enterprise within the synod, and while there is now a small deficit, it is hoped that it may be over- come and the work not be crippled. The report from that synod will be made to the Board by its own commission. KENTUCKY. In this state we have an executive committee appointed by the synod whose work it is to raise special funds to supple- ment the amounts granted by the Board so as to make adequate the salaries of home missionaries. During the past year the Board's work and this splendid organization have been uni- fied so as to make this committee the organized agency of the Board within the synod for promoting all home missionary work, and henceforth all home missionary work in the synod will be conducted as in other dependent synods. The Rev. Francis J. Cheek, D. D.. succeeded Mr. Murdock as 12 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE l^11- synodical superintendent and hereafter the two pastor-evangel- ists are to report to this committee and be under its direction, sub- ject to call for work in any part of the synod as the executive committee may direct, and always in the closest cooperation with the synodical superintendent. For efficiency and splendid organ- ization the Kentucky Executive Committee presents a good model. MISSISSIPPI. The Rev. R. L. Phelps continues as pastor-evangelist for the three presbyteries of this synod. This is one of our weakest synods and presents some of the most difficult problems in the district. We have very few self-supporting and strong churches. The population of the state increased 15.8 per cent, during the last decade. Factories are being started and new industries are growing over the state which promise yet larger commercial de- velopment. Our work has been crippled in this state by litigation, the issue of which has not yet been announced, and until the Supreme Court of the state renders a decision in the case at law it will be difficult to do much aggressive work. In the Presbytery of New Hope a Laymen's Evangelistic Committee has been organized and already approved evangelists have been secured. It is hoped that simultaneous evangelistic meetings may be conducted in the three presbyteries during the year. At the last meeting of the synod the synodical committee was organized more compactly and instructed to take into account all the home mission work within the synod ; give direction to the pastor-evangelist ; review presbyterial estimates of need ; introduce improved financial methods within the presbyteries and stimulate all churches to make the largest possible offerings to this cause. MISSOURI. By action of the last synod the Rev. John B. Hill, D. D., was continued as synodical missionary up to November first, 191 1. The Rev. W. C. Hicks resigned as pastor-evangelist of the Pres- bytery of Ozark and the Rev. C. H. Mitchelmore was elected as his successor. The Rev. W. H. Wilson was elected pastor- evangelist for the Presbytery of Salt River. In this state litigation and a decision adverse to the union have crippled our work very much but in sections of the state there has been a manifest deepening of interest. In the City of St. Louis an Emergency Fund of thirty-five thousand dollars is be- ing provided for the completion of our home mission churches and for adequately equipping them for work. There has also been a large development of work among the foreigners in the cities of St. Louis, Kansas City and St. Joseph. In August a 191 1.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 13 conference of home missionaries, chairmen of presbyterial home mission committees and pastor-evangelists was held in connection with the Presbyterian Assembly of the Southwest at Hollister, Missouri. Two days were given to the earnest consideration of the problems confronting the Church, especially in that section of the state. The last synod adopted a plan for compact synodical organiza- tion by which greater responsibility has been put on the synod and its home mission committee in the administration of home mission affairs within the state. At a late meeting of the synod's committee the estimates of need for the ensuing year were carefully reviewed. Blanks were provided missionaries and field workers that they might make suitable reports to the synod's committee. The committee deter- mined to undertake the raising of twenty-seven thousand dollars for home mission evangelization within the state and has con- ducted a campaign of inspiration in securing subscriptions for this amount. Apportionments have been made to the presby- teries covering this sum. Evangelistic meetings have been held by pastor-evangelists and others throughout the state, which have resulted in stimulating the work, gathering people into the Church and strengthening those already in it. OKLAHOMA. In this synod there is still a large opportunity for pioneer work. In the Southwest, known as the \"big pasture,\" there has been a rapid development. The population of the entire state increased 109.7 Per cent- during the last decade. Sections of the state have suffered very severely from the long continued drought and the work has been greatly crippled on account of it. The Rev. F. L. Benedict, pastor-evangelist for the Presbytery of Cimarron, resigned his position after years of faithful ser- vice and returned to the pastorate. At its fall meeting the synod adopted a plan for compact synodi- cal organization which should become operative at once. Acting under this plan the synod's committee met immediately and divided the work of the Presbyteries of Hobart, El Reno and Cimarron be- tween the Rev. G. P. Howard and the Rev. E. B. Teis as pastor- evangelists. The Rev. M. F. Cowden was made pastor-evangel- ist for the Presbyteries of Ardmore and McAlester ; the Rev. Ralph J. Lamb for the Presbyteries of Oklahoma and Tulsa ; and the Rev. J. A. McDonald, D. D., for the Presbytery of Muskogee, the presbytery providing one-half his salary, the other half fur- nished by the Board. The synod's committee has reviewed with great care the esti- mates of need as presented by the various presbyteries and reduced these estimates wherever possible. Hereafter reports of field work- 14 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [I9II» ers will be made to this committee, to the field secretary and chairmen of the presbyterial home mission committees, which will mean a closer cooperation between all the forces employed for the upbuilding of the Church within the synod. Special evangelistic meetings have been held in many of the churches within the various presbyteries and large gatherings have been the result. In the City of Oklahoma at least two missions have been es- tablished and three others are in prospect. There has been per- haps the largest development of our work in this city during the past year that has ever characterized it in a single year. TENNESSEE. The Rev. Calvin A. Duncan, D. D., synodical missionary for this synod, gave two months during the fall to the special work of assisting in providing the balance of the Tennessee Building Fund ordered by the General Assembly. The Rev. James H. Miller, D. D., has been continued as pas- tor-evangelist for five presbyteries in the western part of the state. In this section of the state fifty churches have been com- pleted or are in process of construction in places where we lost all of our property by the decision of the Supreme Court. Churches have been combined and new buildings have been erected for the combined churches where that has been thought best. The churches in this state have been so disturbed by litigation and their attention so given to church building that very few evan- gelistic meetings have been held. Under the direction of Dr. Miller the Rev. Warren H. Wilson, Ph.D., of the Department of Church and Country life, has conducted with great profit to the churches in this district a number of conferences upon \"The Country Church\" in connection with the spring meetings of pres- byteries. At the Bible Conference held last August in Lebanon, Tennessee, conferences were held by home missionaries, pastor- evangelists, synodical missionaries and chairmen of home mis- sion committees in the interest of home missions. At its meeting in the fall the synod adopted a plan for compact synodical organization which makes the synod responsible for a large part of the home mission administration within its bounds. Presbyterial estimates of need have been reviewed by the synod's committee before they have been forwarded to the Board. Hence- forth reports of field workers will be made to the synod's commit- tee, to the field secretary and presbyterial committees. TEXAS. In this synod there has been a readjustment of boundaries in the case of certain presbyteries. The Presbyteries of Austin and San Antonio have been combined under the name of the former. I9I I.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 15 The Presbytery of El Paso has been erected out of parts of the Presbyteries of Brownwood and San Antonio. Therefore, while a new presbytery has been erected, the number of presbyteries remains twelve as heretofore. The Rev. M. P. Elder has served as pastor-evangelist for the Presbyteries of Waco and Austin, succeeding the Rev. T. W. Davidson. The Rev. J. Gilmore Smith, Ph. D., has served as pastor-evangelist of the Presbytery of Brownwood. The Pres- byteries of Denton, Fort Worth and Paris have been put under the supervision of two pastor-evangelists, the Rev. F. E. Leech and the Rev. L. C. Collier. A drought, which is pronounced the severest in many years, has prevailed in the Panhandle and in West Texas. Many peo- ple were forced out of West Texas and our churches have suf- fered great loss on this account, which may necessitate their ask- ing larger aid from the Board of Home Missions this year than last. Although our ministers have received less from the churches in the drought smitten district than was expected at the beginning of the year, yet they have remained at their posts and have dlone a splendid work. The gifts to the Home Board from these dis- tricts will not be so large as the brethren themselves hoped. In the Presbytery of Abilene, where the drought has been most se- vere, a campaign of home mission education and inspiration was conducted by the home mission committee; but for the drought this would have resulted in a large increase in the work of that presbytery. The population of the state has increased 27.4 per cent, during the last ten years. There are at least eighty thousand Bohemians in the western part of the state, especially in the Presbyteries of Brownwood and Waco, and at least twenty thousand of these are Presbyterians and welcome the work of the Presbyterian Church. In this state the comity relations between the Presbyterian Church in the United States and our Church have had a practi- cal demonstration, which shows a practical application of these relations is possible in a larger degree in other sections of the South and Southwest. The progress of the work in this growing empire state has been limited by the amount of money at the disposal of the committees and the number of men available for the growing fields. At its meeting last fall the synod adopted a plan for compact synodical organization and submitted it to the presbyteries; it is to become operative when two-thirds of the presbyteries ap- prove it and notify the stated clerk of the synod of their action. By this plan the synod's committee will be responsible for a larger share in the administration of home mission work in the synod ; will review presbyterial estimates of need before they are forwarded to the Board ; will have a general supervision of l6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [I9H- all field workers within the synod and receive monthly reports from them, and at all times be in close touch with all parts of the field. Evangelistic services have been held in many parts of the synod with good results. The number of additions to the churches has so far not been reported to me. A general review of the work done and the organizations ef- fected is encouraging and gives promise of a larger develop- ment in the future. DISTRICT OF THE NORTHWEST. For this section the Rev. Robert N. Adams, D. D., presents the following statement : — The District of the Northwest is composed of four synods, North and South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota, containing twenty-six presbyteries, and eight hundred thirty-two churches. Less than one-third of these churches are self-supporting. Many of the aid-receiving churches can do little more than hold their own and so come to the Board each year asking for about the same amount. It is believed that the Home Mission Board can work in cooperation with the Brotherhood to very great ad- vantage. Better organization in the churches is a fundamental factor in the development of the home mission work. Something has been done during the past year in organizing Brotherhoods in the churches of this district and the encouragement in this work has been beyond expectation. Three of the states, namely, the Dakotas and a part of Minnesota, have suffered very much from drought during the past year ; therefore in many regions of the states named, especially in North Dakota, the crop failure has affected church work very seriously. If we are to maintain our work in this region larger grants on the part of the Board will be called for. The pastor-evangelists located men in vacant fields to the number of over one hundred and used students from vari- ous seminaries to the number of about fifty. They also report having organized fifty-one churches. We have one synodical evangelist and twenty-two pastor-evangelists, and the latter have each served a presbytery, and in two cases two presbyteries. The work done by these men with very few exceptions is to be highly commended. The monthly reports made by the Board as to the money re- ceived from each of these men have served as a stimulus to the entire force, and will bring in an increasing amount each year. Ten of these pastor-evangelists serve in the double capacity of pastor-evangelist and Sabbath-school missionary. Those who are filling the combined office have made a good showing in both features of the work during the past year. I9I I.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. IJ BETTER ORGANIZATION. Better organization is the most important thing demanded in all the synods of this district. Consolidation of committees which has been effected already in presbyteries in Nebraska must appeal strongly to all the synods and presbyteries in the district. Such consolidation makes for economy and insures to an extent never before reached efficiency in the administration of both presbyterial and synodical affairs. EVANGELISM. One hundred twenty-six evangelistic meetings are reported by pastor-evangelists which resulted in six hundred twenty-five ad- ditions on profession of faith. It is encouraging to note that these pastor-evangelists are giving more attention to evangel- istic work proper each year. BUDGET. Many of our presbyteries in this district have adopted the bud- get plan as recommended by the General Assembly, and all who have tried it are well pleased with the results. The sentiment in the various presbyteries of this district is very strongly in fav- or of the budget for the benevolences of the Church and a grow- ing number are in favor of the one-budget plan pure and simple. SELF-SUPPORT. Fewer churches will reach self-support this year than in any of the past four years. The question of self-support, however, is being agitated in many of our churches, and when a better financial system has been adopted there will be an increasing num- ber reaching self-support year after year. It is encouraging, however, to note that twenty-one churches so far as reported are asking less than last year. \"home mission evangel/' For the past six months we have been publishing a paper, known as the \"Home Mission Evangel,\" which though not yet self- supporting has had a constantly increasing circulation. It is be- lieved that such a publication will add much to the success and interest in the mission work of the district. MISSIONARY WORK IN LOGGING CAMPS. The Rev. Frank E. Higgins presents the following account of his work among the logging camps, which are included in the District of the Northwest : — l8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [IO/II. At the close of my fifteenth winter of missionary work in the woods of northern Minnesota I feel it is but right to the work, and to those who have so kindly helped me and to myself to make the following statement. I commenced the work while in charge of a small missionary field in Barnum in the spring of 1895. I had gone with some friends to the Kettle River to see the \"drive\" — floating the logs down stream that had been cut the winter before. Much to my surprise as we sat around the fire on the bank of the river after the evening meal several of the men asked me to preach to them. As I looked at that crowd of men I would have said, \"This is the last crowd of men on the face of the earth who would ask a preacher to preach.\" Notice, they did not say, \"We want you to talk, or to tell us a story,\" but they used the word \"preach,\" indicating to me by that word that they wanted to hear the gospel. After some hesitancy I decided to do the best I could. So taking a big log for my platform, the men gathering near, we sang songs, offered prayer, read the Scriptures, and, as best I could, I gave the men a gospel talk. I will never forget that first meeting that beautiful evening on the bank of Kettle River. It seemed as though all nature had joined in the service as I talked to those men of home, and mother, and better days. Many of them took me by the hand and thanked me for the service, and made me promise that I would come and visit them again. Many of them told me how they had been in the woods all winter long, year after year; how some of them had even remained over the period from the time the winter camp broke until the \"drive\" commenced; how they had been on the \"drive\" about thirty days, and that it would be thirty days longer before they would reach civilization. They said if I would come out again and hold another meeting it would do them so much good. So on week days during that spring I went over the trail to that part of the river where the men were working. I always found them ready to give me a welcome and each meeting was more interesting than the one be- fore. That summer when the men came to Barnum, where many of them made their headquarters, I was much pleased to find them ready to attend my church. My congregation doubled in numbers, proving that my visits on the \"drive\" were not a failure. The following fall when the men commenced going to the winter camps I received many invitations to come and preach for them. It was a great pleasure for me to go to the logging camps, for, while I had been brought up in the woods, I had never seen logging done on such a large scale as it is done in the West. I found the logging camps even better for holding gospel meetings than the \"drive.\" Here the men are away from civilization for months. They spend the long winter evenings in 191 1.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 19 the bunk house with but little to occupy their minds. I found that few, if any, had even a paper to read. A letter was a lux- ury ; and, as many of these men are wanderers, they seldom hear from loved ones, if they have such. I saw that it was possible to get their confidence, and soon many of them were telling me the little secrets of their lives. At the close of my first winter's work the men remembered me with a liberal collection, and that spring as I visited one of their number in the hospital in the closing hours of his life, he begged me to continue my work among the men. I made a study of the conditions of the men in the forest and was amazed to find that every winter there were thousands of men, not only in the woods of Minnesota, but also in those of northern Wis- consin and northern Michigan, and even larger numbers farther West. It is a conservative estimate to say that there are over thirty thousand men working in Minnesota, and living in log- ging camps ; not less than ten thousand in northern Wisconsin ; and as many, if not more, in northern Michigan ; in western Mon- tana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and California there are not less than twenty thousand and in most of these states as many as fifty thousand men live in the woods. In all my travels I have not found a missionary or a religious society doing a regu- larly organized work among this great army of men ; in fact, I do not know of any other class of men who have been so neg- lected as these sturdy sons of the forest. For over forty years these men have been going up our rivers to spend the winters, and they have seldom seen the face or heard the voice of the missionary. All these years they have been left to the mercy of the saloon, the brothel, the gambling hell ; and the saddest part of it all is — conditions have grown worse instead of better. During the last fifteen years there have been many more men in the woods than formerly. The old time lumber jack is fast passing away and in his place we have an army of mere boys from our farms who come to the woods for a few months to earn a winter \"stake,\" little realizing the many temptations put in their way. The old timer went far away up the river where he remained all winter away from civilization, and, thank God, away from the temptations of civilization. But these days the timber is controlled by large companies that build logging rail- roads so that they may get out the timber they cut in one sea- son. As soon as these roads are surveyed through the forest small towns spring up often composed of only tar-papered shacks or log buildings, saloons, gambling halls and other places of sin, until to-day you can in many cases stand at the camp door and see the saloon. Many of the men are too easily tempt- ed, and, after years of neglect on the part of Christian people, have given up in discouragement ; many are now tramps and bums. I have known almost a hundred saloons, besides many 20 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [I9II« gambling places and brothels, in the short distance of twenty- five miles along one of these logging roads, all running wide open night and day. In the majority of these places Sunday is the biggest day of all. I have counted over twenty quarts of whiskey, besides several jugs full, in one car as the men were going to camp. I have stood for hours trying to keep the men from fighting; and have helped to unload them in their drunken condition at the various camps. It has been a common thing to see from ten to fifty of these men lying in the \"snake\" room and on the sawdust floors of the saloons, sleeping off their debauch. In a single night the wages of an entire winter's work were gone ; the lumber jack was then either thrown into the lockup or told to take a \"tie pass\" out of town. And as many of them turned their faces again to the forest they could be heard saying, \"It is no use trying any more.\" The saloon has been and is yet in the majority of places the most inviting place for the lumber jack; if he wants to eat he goes to a saloon ; if he wants to sleep he goes to a saloon ; if he wants a shave or a haircut he goes to the saloon; and I know from experience that when it is twenty below zero a saloon is better than a snow drift.' Some will ask, \"Do the lumber com- panies take any interest in their men?\" Yes, they care well for them while in camp, but few of them find it practical to do much for them while in town ; many of the companies are so out of patience with the way the men tramp from camp to camp and from town to town, which is the result of the wide open policy, that they feel that little if anything can be done for them. In the beginning of my work as I commenced launching out into fields where I was not so well known I found there were deep seated prejudices for me to overcome. Some of the men thought it was a scheme to get money, and I was not surprised when I began to look into the way the men had been treated in the camps, for every one that ever came to the camp seemed to have but one purpose in view, — to get the lumber jack's money ; the tailor to sell clothes; the jeweler to sell watches or other jew- elry; the cripple to ask for a collection to buy himself a cork limb, which he seldom ever bought, else the next winter he would not get a collection ; the Sister of Charity, and occasion- ally what I call a \"tramp preacher,\" visiting a camp but once and always asking for a collection. The prejudices growing out of these varied and constant appeals for money had to be over- come, and this could only be accomplished by years of hard work, which proved to these men and to the companies that I had but one object in view — the welfare of the men. But to-day I am thankful to God to have lived to see that prejudice over- come and to find such a call and such a desire on the part of the men and the companies that there is an open door and a wel- come on every hand. Only once in these fifteen years has a 191 1.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 21 company refused me admittance to its camps ; and I feel sure to-day if that company had known the truth it would never have closed its doors. During the first seven years that I visited the camps in Minne- sota I had charge of a home mission field under the care of Duluth Presbytery, and during this time was fitting myself for ordina- tion as it was not my privilege to graduate from any college or theological seminary. Each year my acquaintance among these men grew, for the hundred men reached in a camp one winter may be scattered over fifty camps another winter ; so each year invitations from new camps increased. I soon found I had either to give up the work in the camps or give up my mis- sionary pastorate. As soon as I received ordination I turned my attention to this work, but I soon realized how little one man could do in such a vast field. Invitations were already coming to me, even from the Pacific Coast where many of the men I had become acquainted with had gone. I saw I must have help ; and this meant more men and more means. If I should be able to get the means, where would I be able to find men willing to take up this work? The men would have to be the right sort. More than once this work was started by men who were not adapted to it. Some hearing about it were anxious to try it, but when they found they must travel day after day, reaching a new camp every night, and two or three on Sunday, sleeping in a bunk or under the canopy of heaven, they soon grew weary and would again seek work in the towns. But God in a marvel- ous way showed me how this problem could be solved. One day while reading in the camp I came across an article telling how General Booth, addressing an audience in London years ago, while describing his plans for the organization of the army in every town, city and country was interrupted by the question, \"Where will you get- the workers?\" In a flash he answered, \"From among those who are converted.\" I dropped the paper that day, saying, \"It is a vision. I see it. If God can raise up such splendid workers from the gutter for the Salvation Army, why can't men be raised up in the camps to do this work?\" And, thank God, they have. This past winter four of the best workers we have had are converted lumber jacks. And I believe the time is coming when many such men will be raised up not only for the camps, but for the frontier towns and waste places. During the past year we have had nine missionaries in Minne- sota. We have reached over ten thousand men with regular gospel services, distributed over five tons of reading matter, magazines and church papers, and helped many unfortunates. While in town it is the duty of the missionaries to round up these poor fellows and put them to bed, oftentimes nursing them through their debauchery, as many of them are on the verge of delirium tremens, and helping them back to the camps. 22 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [I9II« Another department of the work is visiting the various hos- pitals where these men are taken while sick. The Roman Cath- olic Church has a splendid system of hospitals all through the lumber districts. Shame on the Protestant Church that this has been left almost entirely to the Catholic Church. When the workers are in these towns they go to these various hos- pitals doing what little they can for those in need. Our plan for the future is as follows : — Put a missionary over a circuit of from twelve to twenty of these camps, as the number may be conveniently located. The missionary travels among these continually, doing the work mentioned above. Our experience has proven that two hun- dred dollars, with what the men give in camp, will support one of these missionaries for the winter months; in many places, however, there is work for the entire year. Many small set- tlements are springing up that later will be permanent towns; here we must organize Sunday schools and churches, laying the foundations for future generations. Let us pray and believe that the Church will rise more nobly than ever to this great work. ROCKY MOUNTAIN DISTRICT. For this section the Rev. Robert M. Donaldson, D. D., presents the following statement: — The Rocky Mountain District covers an area of seven hun- dred thousand square miles and is larger than the entire area of the United States east of the Mississippi, exclusive of the four smaller states on the Gulf. It is a region packed with undevel- oped resources, yet is contributing vast sums to the wealth of the nation. It includes all the precious ores, while the deposits of coal, iron, marble and asbestos will stand the world's drain for centuries. In at least two mountain states the agricultural output exceeds the mineral. The Federal Government is ex- pending millions in each of these states to increase the acre- age available for cultivation and habitation. These sovereign states have been molded from regions long abandoned to wilder- ness and desert. The builders of empires constructed the mir- ages— the dream cities — into real towns and cities of brick and granite and marble. Prior to 1870 there was no organized Presbyterian church in Montana, Idaho, Utah, Arizona or New Mexico. Three churches in Wyoming had a membership of six each. Ten churches in Colo- rado had an average membership of twelve. This \"handful of corn in the top of the mountains\" has yielded marvelous in- crease. Five synods and twenty-two presbyteries with approxi- mately four hundred churches and thirty-six thousand members are on this territory today. During the first decade of the twen- I9I I.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 23 tieth century we have organized one hundred seventy-five church- es which have a present membership of six thousand two hundred seventy-two. Since the date of their organization we have re- ceived into them a total membership of seven thousand five hun- dred thirty-six by examination and certificate. More than sixty new houses of worship have been erected within the last four years. Many of these are the only sanctuary in their respective communities. Irrigation systems and \"dry farming\" communities account for fully one-fourth of our present fields. One-third of the en- tire number of our churches stand at an altitude of five thou- sand feet or more above sea level. Altitude promotes long vi- sion; for three of our five synods are among the few which give larger amounts for foreign missions than for home mis- sions. It is a generosity that courts critical scrutiny. The churches of this district last year contributed for all causes a general average of $17.41 per member. The general average of eight of the strongest synods in the East is only $17.62. It is doubtful, however, if either section has lived up to its full privi- lege. This region is in the limelight as well as in the sunlight. Un- employed capital seeks undeveloped fields for investment. Un- employed labor from our own and other lands crowds the trail to every new opportunity for required toil. The very soil of the desert burdens itself with cereals and fruits as if in sympa- thetic response to the world's hunger. Here is the govern- ment's field of conservation and exploitation. Geologist and anthropologist uncover records and ruins that belong to anti- quity. Students of statecraft, of political and social economy are trying their hands at state-building. While this is an inland region, touching no ocean, yet inter- nationalism is no dead issue. We have Mexico on the south, and Canadian provinces on the north. The separating line in each case is only imaginary. We are in physical and human touch with each. Without regard to future political relations we have much in common with them. What we make of our own country will go a long way toward determining the spirit of their Government and the character of their people. The immigration phase of internationalism is also present. Human tides have followed our great streams to their very sources. If the glut of our cities is to be relieved we must make these trails the main-traveled roads. Ethically consid- ered, the immigrant is raw material out of which the Republic must construct the finished product of its civilization. Wherever these abide, the Church has a Macedonian call. Each state has its own peculiar characteristics and is to be considered by itself in this report. 24 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE I10*11- ARIZONA. The population of this new state includes some forty thou- sand Spanish-Americans with about an equal number of Indians. Our work includes churches, missions and schools among each of these. Owing to the sparse population and the weakness of our churches Arizona has but two presbyteries and is still a part of the Synod of New Mexico. However, the increase of population during the last decade was sixty-six per cent. Most of the newcomers are prosperous Americans, and the outlook for our work is encouraging. The completion of one of the great government irrigation systems assures a larger population in the near future as well as larger returns financially for the present population. The field work is done by a synodical evangelist. COLORADO. With about two hundred thousand foreign population in the state there is a special field for work of this nature. With an increased population of forty-eight per cent, during the decade just closed Colorado has added both to her field and her force. Americans who have opened up new agricultural regions came desiring the ministrations of the church. They have asked for it and have assisted promptly in supporting and developing new fields. In this they differ widely from the old type of frontiers- man. A score of new organizations during the year represent the response of these newcomers to our mission workers. One pastor-evangelist serves the Presbyteries of Boulder and Den- ver, and one serves Pueblo Presbytery. The Presbytery of Gunnison is without a field worker. With all the other states of the district Colorado shares the discouragement incident to a dry summer and short crops. This has seriously interfered with advance toward self-support in many fields. In win- ning new territory a section as large as New Jersey in which there was no Presbyterian church has been opened to us during the year, and in another part of the state a section as large as Massachusetts. There is prospect that other points in these new regions may soon be occupied. IDAHO. The State of Idaho had the phenomenal record of adding to its population during the decade more than one hundred one per cent. Most of these are Americans or English-speaking peo- ple and are developing that part of the state embraced in our new synod. It is transforming the nature of the work in this region. The original settlers within the bounds of Ken- dall Presbytery were mostly foreign born. The non-Mor- 191 1.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 25 mon populations greatly simplify the problems of religious work- ers. This difference puts the work in Twin Falls Presbytery in sharp contrast with its neighbor on the east. Both presbyteries are in local-option territory. Boise Presbytery has opened many new fields consequent upon the completed irrigation systems that have brought a large tract of land under water privileges. This state is being developed for us by a synodical superintend- ent. MONTANA. In the northwestern part of the state a new presbytery has been born and is asking permission of the Assembly to live and serve. Its erection is necessary for the proper development of our work in that isolated region. It will promote economy in ad- ministration and larger fruitage in service. It is set apart from a presbytery which extends from one end of this great state to another and includes an area about twice that of Ohio. Last year the Synod of Montana made an advance in membership exceed- ing fifteen per cent. This was the result of the work of our reg- ular field force and pastors. It is a successful attempt on the part of our leaders to keep pace with the increase in population, which the last census designates as fifty-four per cent, since 1900. In Helena Presbytery four churches withdraw from the aid of the Board this year, and one in Great Falls Presbytery. More than a score of the organizations in this state are not on rail- road lines and are reached with difficulty and expense. A comity agreement long in force has during the last year been interfered with more frequently than for a quarter century. It is due to more aggressiveness on the part of other denominations than they have shown heretofore. Notwithstanding this fact, prac- tically all of our new organizations were effected where there was no other denomination at work. All of northern and east- ern Montana suffered from drought last summer to such an ex- tent that the legislature planned for their relief. From necessity this will interfere with large support from these regions until they recover. Three pastor-evangelists serve our four presby- teries. NEW MEXICO. Fifty years of struggle for statehood has given the migrating world a larger acquaintance with the material resources of this region. It is a reasonable expectation that the sixty-seven per cent, increase of population during the decade just passed is but the advance guard of multitudes that will follow. Their charac- ter will determine whether the resources of the state are to be devoted to Mammon or to God. The pernicious activity of the Roman Catholic Church to gain large concessions in lands and 26 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [IO<II' legislative favors is \"good politics,\" from their point of view. Yet it is an attempt to perpetuate the same form of religion that for three hundred fifty years has kept the civilization of this region as barren as its unwatered deserts. The Protestant church can be too deliberate and cautious in its movements. If it were as seriously attempting to give the truth to this region as it should be, it could hold in check the partisan attempts to win advantage by trickery and by the cunning which has so long contributed to the poverty of the people and the wealth of the ecclesiastic. All the world has learned that the old Santa Fe trail is a trail of hope and health for the invalid. On every hand you see men and women from every clime whose faces bear the dread brand of the white plague. They seek the dry climate where they can bathe in the healing light of God's unvarying sun. The Synod of New Mexico has founded a hospital in which Arizona shares re- sponsibility. It is located at Albuquerque and is filled with pa- tients. This ministry is as essential and as Christly as any line of church work, and was forced upon our people by conditions that were not of their own choosing. The field work of our three presbyteries in New Mexico is confined to one synodical evangelist. UTAH. Utah is still on the map. During the recent year it has been rediscovered — by the magazines. It has finally dawned upon pub- lishers and general readers that Mormonism is to be reckoned with. Whether you call it a menace, or an octopus, or a viper, matters little. Its nature and influence are unchanged save in degree. It has ever been a bitter fountain out of which no pure stream can issue. Increased Gentile populations pushing into the state, together with the wide-spread information concerning the real spirit and work of the Mormon Church, make it possi- ble to work in the light as never before. This field demands and deserves the study of specialists in applied Christianity. To leave all experimenting to the pastor or missionary whose routine is sufficient to consume his time, and whose experiences are dis- couraging enough to sap his vitality is not a wise procedure. The tent work is still one of the most encouraging features in Utah. It is proposed to extend this line of effort and the cooperation of seminary professors and successful pastors in other regions is prayerfully sought. A synodical superintendent, is the sole field worker. WYOMING. There is a marked awakening in the material and spiritual in- terests of Wyoming. It has been in an almost dormant state for many years. Its resources were either unknown or inaccessible. I9I I.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 27 New lines of railroad are reaching its fertile basins and plains. The population was increased fifty-seven per cent, during the last ten years. It is estimated that eighty per cent, of the citizens are Americans. We have but two presbyteries in the state and two self-supporting churches. All the active work in northern Wyom- ing has been instituted within the last five years. Not an active church in Sheridan Presbytery possessed a house of worship one year ago. Since that time four have dedicated sanctuaries and two others are nearly ready for dedication. These new condi- tions are in striking contrast with the older regions, where two churches organized by Sheldon Jackson forty years ago are still receiving aid from the Board. Within a month a neat new church has been dedicated in a new town where two years previ- ously ten thousand cattle were grazing. No residence or place of business is as complete and commodious. They have given their best to God. It is the only church for English speaking people in a territory forty miles square. Four or five other communities are stimulated to activity by this church. While progress seems slow as the record is read year by year, yet enough has been accomplished in the Rocky Mountain Dis- trict to enable us to look hopefully to the future. Better organi- zation, men adapted to new conditions, and continued fidelity to the Head of the Church on the part of pastors and people will insure larger spiritual harvests than we have yet known. PACIFIC COAST DISTRICT. SYNOD OF CALIFORNIA. ORGANIZATION. For this section the Rev. William Sylvester Holt, D. D., pre- sents the following statement : — Up to the present time the synod does not see that any good purpose will be served by special synodical organization or synod- ical control of the home mission work done within its bounds. The direct responsibility of the individual presbytery with review by the Board seems to the synod to meet all the requirements for the control of the home mission interests without the intervention of the synod. For this reason no steps have been taken looking toward synodical organization. But at the meeting of the synod held last autumn in Fresno the reorganization of synod's home mission committee was made, looking toward greater efficiency in the work of that com- mittee. Heretofore the chairman of the committee has automatically changed each year, rotating in regular order among the mem- bers. One result of this has been that all recommendations 28 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [l^H- touching home missions, adopted by the syriod under one chair- man, have met with two obstacles : First, they are adopted af- ter the church year is half gone; second, a new chairman has been charged with seeing that they are carried out during the half year left. Under the new plan the chairman is elected for three years, but is not allowed to succeed himself. PLANS. Looking toward self-support as a synod, the following action was taken at the annual meeting : \"That the Synod keep stead- ily in view the goal set before it by the General Assembly's Ad- visory Council on Church Extension, and seek to contribute as much money as received for the work of evangelization, and to secure that end that : (a) Those Presbyteries which last year gave over 50 cents per capita, shall this year increase to 80 cents. (b) Those which last year gave over 25 cents and under 50 cents shall this year increase to 60 cents. (c) Those which last year gave less than 30 cents, shall this year increase to 50 cents. That unless otherwise ordered, the above recommendations shall be effective from the beginning of the next ecclesiastical year.\" The intent of these plans and this date for their becoming ef- fective is to obviate the difficulty formerly experienced from the fact that presbyteries have received the recommendations of the synod too late to follow them, and the synod's committee has not been in position to give its own recommendations per- sonal attention. It is understood that to make the above effective the synod's committee is preparing to submit plans to the spring meeting of the presbyteries next April. PRESBYTERIAL SELF-SUPPORT. This has been maintained by Los Angeles Presbytery as before, the presbytery both collecting and administering its own funds. The Board receives the benefit of any excess in the treasury of the presbytery. After April first, 191 1, San Jose Presbytery will follow the plan of presbyterial control. It has also voted to send the Board the surplus after paying its own bills. Riverside and Santa Barbara Presbyteries have continued their former plans. Thus four of the presbyteries in the syno^ are self-supporting. DEVELOPMENT. The completion of the Western Pacific Railroad through the northern part of the synod is opening up new territory hitherto not readily accessible. The proposed pushing of the railroad 191 1 •] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 29 from Reno, Nevada, to Lake County, Oregon, while not rapidly going forward, will bring new sections to view. Government and private irrigation plans are moving steadily forward, bringing in new settlers and developing new towns. Nevada, Sacramento and San Joaquin Presbyteries are most affected by the irrigation plans. LUMBER CAMP WORK. Nothing special has been attempted along this line during the past year outside of what has been done by the home mission- aries and pastors of the fields contiguous to the vast timber belts of California. But the work is not lost sight of by the presby- teries within whose bounds the timber is located. EVANGELISM. Benicia, Nevada, Oakland, San Francisco and San Joaquin Presbyteries have had the services of pastor-evangelists commis- sioned by the Board. They have done a vast amount of work of all sorts according to the needs of the different presbyteries and the plans of the home mission committees. A study of that work as reported shows that up to February twenty-eighth these faith- ful men have made visits to 190 churches ; preached 462 sermons ; made 1668 pastoral visits ; held 137 evangelistic services ; in which 127 have professed conversion and 189 have been gathered into the churches ; they have secured $4,729.00 for the churches, of which a considerable part was for the salaries of the ministers ; and have sent the Home Board $401.95. If we could also tabulate the amount of money saved to the Board by the care of vacant churches it would amount to a large sum. SYNOD OF OREGON. ORGANIZATION. One year ago last October the synod prepared and adopted a complete plan of organization involving synodical control in the home mission work. But the time was not ripe to enter upon the plan. However the synod is committed to the policy and will adopt it and work it as soon as the way is clear. FORWARD MOVEMENT. The last meeting of synod at Pendleton adopted a plan for a forward movement in all the missionary departments — home, for- eign and Sabbath-school. It looked toward a general educational effort which should reach all the churches in the synod, to be under the care of a special committee elected for the specific pur- pose. The first half of December and such portion of February 30 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE t10/11- as should be necessary were set apart for the work. The pro- gram included visits to each church of experts to spend part of two days. Conferences on the \"School and the Church,\" fol- lowing the action of the last Assembly ; on the \"Budget Plan for Church Finance\" ; meetings with church officers for discussion of local problems ; a supper with all the men of the congregation at the regular supper time when the business end of the Church at large should receive attention, and then popular meetings in the evening in which home and foreign missions should be the main topics. It has been carried out with great thoroughness. No church has been omitted because it was small or remote. Only where the plan has interfered with evangelistic meetings has any inter- ruption been permitted. The services of the home and foreign field secretaries, the synodical Sunday-school superintendent, the pastor-evangelists, the Sunday-school missionaries and such mem- bers of the committees concerned as could be secured were used. The conferences in general were well attended and the results all that could be hoped for. A follow up policy will make the results certain. SELF-SUPPORT. The Presbytery of Portland has maintained its own work on the same policy with which it was begun, and has raised more money for home missions than ever before. Five per cent, of the actual receipts, excepting only special funds designated by the donors for specific use, has been sent to the Home Board. There is no other presbytery in Oregon to which self-support is even possible at present. If for no other reason the rapid in- crease of population which must be dependent for religious priv- ileges during the first years of settlement makes the home mission demands imperative and beyond the ability of the people to meet. When land must be cleared — in West Oregon at very large ex- pense, in East Oregon with compulsory preparation for irriga- tion— a home erected even of the most humble sort, land con- quered to the crop raising point and taxes to be paid, the religious side of life has a new and pressing appeal that can be met only by the Board of Home Missions. But each presbytery is press- ing for it by urging self-support in the individual church, and by increasing the gifts to the Board. While writing this word has come from one of our very frontier churches, away off the rail- road, that it will assume self-support after April first. This too without any urging outside of its own desires. DEVELOPMENT. Oregon is beginning to feel the impulse of new life. Up to the present time the whole of the eastern part of the state has been left with no means of transportation except wagons for I9I I.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 31 freight and stages for human beings. It is too late in the his- tory of the world for the American to be content with such transportation. Mr. J. J. Hill says that Eastern Oregon has as good a country as Eastern Washington. He has shown his confidence in his judgment by building a railroad from the Co- lumbia River up the now famous Des Chutes River into Central Oregon. The first trains began to run in March, 191 1. Then the Harriman system has built into that section and has plans for continuance that are not well known outside of their own of- ficials. But it is certain that great development will come to that whole region. We are alert to the whole situation and will see that our Church does its full part. In addition to the rail- road irrigation is entering into the district. The Carey act and the government plans and private plans are all conspiring to give an increasing population. The last census shows that the population of Oregon has grown from 413,536 in 1900 to 673,775 in 1910. Of this in- crease but thirty-seven thousand is credited to East Oregon, which has two-thirds of the area of the state. This shows that the transportation facilities necessary to carry people into that region have not been provided. WORK FOR ITALIANS. Under the authorization of the General Assembly and at the request of the Presbytery of Portland it was proposed early in the year that work be undertaken among the Italian population, which amounts to about ten thousand. After some examination of the conditions the presbytery found that the Baptist Church had already begun such work and therefore abandoned its own plans. At present the work done by the Baptists seems to be meeting the needs so far as Protestants are concerned. EVANGELISM. Grande Ronde, Pendleton, Portland, Southern Oregon and Willamette Presbyteries all enjoy the services of pastor-evangel- ists. Portland provides for its own, combining the office of pas- tor-evangelist with that of Sabbath-school missionary. The men in the other presbyteries are under the commission of the Board. Grande Ronde and Pendleton share the labors of one man. In those two presbyteries the pastor-evangelist has done the work of pastor-at-large as well as of evangelist. The same is true in Southern Oregon ; but in Willamette he has devoted his whole time to evangelism. Their work so far as it can be tabulated has shown the following results : — Visits to churches 119; sermons preached 450; pastoral visits made 972 ; evangelistic meetings held 278 ; professions of faith 32 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [I911- 179; added to the churches 136; money raised for the churches $605.00; sent the Home Board $204.92. Again the amounts saved by caring for vacant churches will swell the total. This report covers the work of the three men under the commission of the Board and not the work done by the men in Portland Presbytery. In addition to the work done by these commissioned men evangelistic work has been done in many churches by the aid of workers who have been brought into the synod expressly to aid the self-supporting churches. The evan- gelistic spirit is abroad throughout the entire synod. FEDERATION. Very little is being done in Oregon for this. Comity is in force with the Congregationalists, but with no other Church. Of course it is impossible with the liturgical denominations. It is before the Church, and we will try to practice it so far as we may. SYNOD OF WASHINGTON. ORGANIZATION. At the last meeting of the synod the whole subject of closer organization for the work of home missions was fully discussed and it was decided that at present it is not wise to make any changes in this respect. SYNODICAL MISSIONARY. The synod unanimously adopted a recommendation \"that the Board continue the office of Synodical Missionary until May, 191 1 ; that the Presbyteries, singly or in groups, make provision for pastor-evangelists in their Spring Schedules, and that the Synod apply to the Board for an evangelist whose term of ser- vice shall begin September, 191 1, or sooner, at a salary sufficient to secure the services of a man fitted to do acceptable work in any of our average fields.\" PLANS. At the same meeting the synod inaugurated a home mission campaign in each presbytery to reach every church if possible for the purpose of encouraging improved methods of finance for lo- cal support and for benevolences. This campaign was carried out during the month of November. In the meetings with the men finance was carefully discussed, and the budget plan with weekly subscriptions was urged ,as the only method for meeting 191 1.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 33 the full responsibility of the churches. The budget sent out by the Executive Commission of the General Assembly was set for- ward as a minimum only, and as providing the least sum with which the work now in hand can be accomplished. So far as heard from the campaign was a success in that the whole work of the Church was clearly set forth and the home mission re- sponsibility properly emphasized as it needs to be in this great dependent synod. The synod is awake to the need of keeping its work well before its presbyteries and through them before the churches. SELF-SUPPORT. This is a live question in the Synod of Washington. There is a real interest in it, and it always receives attention ; but thus far no presbytery has attained the goal. In the meeting of the synod reference was made to the notable fact that the Congregational Church in Washington has assumed the self-support of its home mission work, involving a cost of one dollar and a half per capita to do it. This was used to stimu- late the gifts of the synod, and the call was made to try to reach fifty cents per capita for the current year. LUMBER CAMP WORK. Two of the presbyteries, Olympia and Seattle, have asked for men for the lumber camps and this work will be pushed during the coming year. EVANGELISM. The synod took formal action on this subject. In general the plans of the Evangelistic Committee were favored : namely, to devote the month of February to personal work and the month of March to special evangelistic effort where at all possible. Each church making this special effort is to report the results to the chairman of the committee on home missions and evangelism. Following up this action of the synod the Presbytery of Belling- ham sent out to all the churches a circular letter outlining an evangelistic campaign to be carried on by the aid of the pastors or by special evangelists when they could be secured. Then to make sure of the work the committee assigned the pastors to give help in definite churches so that each church might be ready for the work. This was done through the months of February and March. Of course it is not possible to know what the result of the meetings has been or will be. In addition to this pastor-evangelists commissioned by the Board have been at work in the Presbyteries of Seattle and Spo- kane. Both these presbyteries share their worker with the Sab- 34 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [I9H- bath-school Board, so but half time has been given to evangelism. Other presbyteries desire the offices of a pastor-evangelist but have not been supplied, except that Bellingham and Wenatchee secured a man for March, from whom no report could be received so early. From the other reports it is learned that 70 visits have been made to churches ; 201 sermons preached ; 908 pastoral visits made ; 73 evangelistic services have been held ; 80 have professed conversion; 100 have been added to churches; $1,083.00 have been secured for churches; $51.19 have been sent to the Board. DEVELOPMENT. According to the census of 1910, the population of Washington is 1,141,990, which is a gain of one hundred per cent, during the decade. New railroads have been constructed across the state, and vast irrigation plans by the Government are to-day opening up valuable tracts to the settlers. The wonderful productiveness of the soil, the mild climate and the certainty of the crops are at- tracting the attention of the world. What is being done in the apple country is almost incredible. At one place in the state five acres of apple orchards sold last year for fifteen thousand dollars and actually paid ten per cent, on that price ; and this year orchards of one acre have yielded one thousand dollars worth of fruit. As such facts become known it is certain that more people will throng into the state. But it is while they are waiting for the yield of fruit — about five years — that the home mission work has to be done. Later the churches will become self-supporting and contribute to others. The home mission demand is imperative and pressing, and the Church will be wise which meets its full obligation to this nascent West. COMITY. Our own Church stands for absolute comity. We have it with our Congregational brethren and will welcome it with all. The synod is committed to the principle and will abide by it and urge it until it is a fact among all the churches. OUTLOOK. The outlook for the entire Pacific Coast District is most hopeful. We are trying to realize our relations to the United States and also to get a vision of our world relations. The absolute necessity of pressing the work of home missions for ourselves we already appreciate. But God has given us a world vision also, and we are praying the words of the Sixty-seventh Psalm with all their latter day meaning pressed into them : \"God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us; that thy tj I9I I.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 35 way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all na- tions.\" DEPARTMENT OF CHURCH AND LABOR. This department continues under the care of the Rev. Charles Stelzle who is assisted in the survey work by Mr. G. B. St. John. The problem of the city has been given the most prominent place during the past year in the work of the department. For eight years it has been advocating certain methods of work through which the alienated workingman might be brought with- in the church door. Usually when these methods have been per- sistently and aggressively followed the ministers and churches adopting them have been more or less successful. It was felt, however, that the department should itself work out the plans which were being presented to the workers in the Church. The most difficult field in New York and perhaps in the entire coun- try was, therefore, selected and on a prominent corner on the lower east side of New York, where a church building became available because the congregation had united with another church, a demonstration is being made with regard to the practi- cability of securing the attendance of workingmen. The Labor Temple, by which name it has become known, has attracted much attention from the very outset. The main auditorium is open every night for popular meetings, although thirty-three meet- ings are held each week. Frequently people are turned away, especially at the Sunday night meeting which is distinctively evangelical. Nine-tenths of the audiences consist of men and fifty per cent, are Jews. There is probably no church in Amer- ica which has a larger attendance of Hebrews. The interest aroused in this enterprise of the Board has been nation-wide and it is being watched not only by the leaders in the Pres- byterian Church but by those of other denominations. During the month of February the department conducted in eight different cities a series of \"One-day Conferences on the Downtown Church.\" These meetings were held in Schenectady, Buffalo, Cleveland, Columbus, Chicago, St. Louis, Louisville and Pittsburgh. In Chicago, Louisville and Pittsburgh the afternoon meetings were held in the theological seminaries and were at- tended by practically the entire student body and faculty. Mass meetings were held in almost all of the cities at night. It is felt that this was the beginning of constructive work with reference to the downtown city problem which will be of value particularly in industrial communities. A series of leaflets on the city have been issued by the department presenting illustrations of condi- tions and suggesting methods whereby these conditions may be met. Another important feature of the department's work during the 2,6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [I911- past year has been the surveys made of various communities and cities. Among others two typical surveys were made: one of Sag Harbor, Long Island, with a population of about thirty-five hundred; and the other of Elizabeth, New Jersey, a typical in- dustrial community with a population of approximately seventy- five thousand. In each case maps, charts and diagrams were pre- pared and statistics were gathered which served as the basis of some definite recommendations to the churches and other agen- cies engaged in the securing of better social and moral conditions among the people. Practically all of the older features of the Department of Church and Labor have been maintained during the year, includ- ing the Correspondence Course in Applied Christianity, the rep- resentation of ministers at meetings of central labor unions, the holding of mass meetings of workingmen on Sunday afternoons, the writing of weekly and monthly articles for the labor press of the United States and the observance of Labor Sunday. While the temperance movement inaugurated among working- men a year ago has not been pushed as aggressively in a public manner as in the previous year, efforts have been made in a quiet way to so influence the labor leaders of the country as to restrain any attempt on the part of the liquor interests represented in trades-union conventions to commit these conventions to the saloon. DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION. In the spring of 1908 the Rev. Charles Stelzle, in addition to the superintendency of the Department of Church and Labor, was appointed superintendent of the Department of Immigration. By reason of the growth of the work of both these departments it was deemed best to divide them and on November first, 1910, the Rev. William Payne Shriver, who had served for ten months as assistant in the Department of Immigration, was made super- intendent. The steadily extending interest of the Board of Home Mis- sions in the recent immigrant population in this country is ex- pressed through its Department of Immigration. (The Board's cooperation with the German churches, and its very large in- terest among the Spanish-speaking people of the Southwest and the Islands of Cuba and Porto Rico are not included in this de- partment.) Forty important centers in immigrant communities are now oc- cupied by the Department of Immigration in cooperation with twenty presbyteries. The major part of the present work is in the metropolitan district (New York and vicinity) in the Presby- teries of New York, Brooklyn, Westchester and Nassau. With a population of over five millions, largely foreign born or of for- I9I I.] BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS. 37 eign parentage, this district not only presents a home mission field of tremendous proportions and of insistent needs, but fur- nishes the Department of Immigration an opportunity to carry on its study, observation and practical testing of methods at close range. By special arrangement the superintendent of the depart- ment also serves as superintendent for the Home Mission Com- mittee of the Presbytery of New York with direct supervision over the seventeen centers now occupied in this presbytery among Italians, Hungarians, Bohemians, Ruthenians and a densely con- congested Jewish neighborhood. Regular conferences for the discussion of practical methods and for the deepening of the spiritual life and Christian purpose of all the missionaries and visitors in the metropolitan district have been of fine personal helpfulness, and have developed an esprit de corps in the form of twenty-five workers. A model church building and neigh- borhood house is now being erected according to designs made by the department for an Italian community of twenty thousand in the Borough of the Bronx; a leaflet describing this typical building has been issued. During the year another important center on the upper East Side of Manhattan has been taken over where a ministry is maintained in the Swedish, Italian, Hungarian and English languages. A careful survey and house to house canvass has been made of the community surround- ing Hope Chapel on the lower East Side, and plans are being carefully matured for a ministry to this almost solidly Jewish community with a population of from two to three thousand to a city block. Much has already been done to promote friendly relations and mutual understanding. During the year the department has .entered into cooperation with the Presbytery of Baltimore in the inauguration of a most promising work for a community of thirty thousand poles under the pastorate of the Rev. Paul Fox ; a second center has been opened for the Italians. Ample and useful buildings have been provided in both cases. Cooperation has also been ex- tended to the Austrian Immigrant Home, a notable type of so- cial ministry to the arriving immigrant. This spring the depart- ment will direct a survey of the foreign communities of East Bal- timore, together with a study of social and religious agencies now in these communities. The erection on September twelfth, 1910, of the Bohemian Presbytery of the Central West, opens a new and highly promis- ing field of cooperation for the Department of Immigration. During the year just beginning, three churches will receive aid and five other points will be developed through student work in the summer months. The needs of this new presbytery will be carefully studied. Among other new centers occupied the past year mention may be made of a work among the Poles and other Slavic peo- 38 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE [ tu- ples in St. Joseph, Missouri. Also a second Slavic work in Kan- sas City. Kansas, which is receiving careful local conservation. With the close of the year, March, 1910, Rev. Jaroslav Dobias, a missionary under the Home Board, has been dispatched to Texas on an evangelistic mission and tour of exploration and survey among the Bohemian communities of Texas in cooperation with the Home Mission Committee of the Synod of Texas. Mr. Dobias will not only visit centers already occupied by the Pres- byterian Church, but in a fraternal spirit will visit other Bo- hemian congregations and the congregations of the Evangelical Unity of Bohemian and Moravian Brethren. It is planned that this careful study of the conditions among the more than twenty thousand Bohemians in Texas will be made the basis of a largely extended ministry. The department has worked in cordial and mutually helpful relations with the Permanent Committee of the Synod of New York. Trips of investigation have been made with a repre- sentative of the synod's committee, including a tour of labor camps along the line of the new State Barge Canal from Buffalo to the Hudson River. Following this tour a survey of the Ital- ian community of eighteen thousand in Utica, New York, was made with recommendations for setting up a work. An immi- gration exhibit was arranged for the meeting of the New York Synod in October, a service the department will be glad to render any other synod. The synodical committee has just ap- pointed the Rev. Arthur H. Allen as an associate secretary to have special charge of work among immigrant communities. Under the direction of the Department of Immigration Mr. Al- len spent three months in New York and environs working to increase his experience in survey work, methods et cetera. The department is ready at any time to furnish facilities and personal direction to any one desiring to make special studies of immi- grant populations, or to prepare for similar positions in pres- byteries or synods. The work among the Ruthenians in New York and Newark has been somewhat arrested by the return to Canada of the Rev. John Bodrug who has specially fostered this movement. The commodious church building for the congregation in Newark, New Jersey, erected at a cost of thirty-two thousand dollar^ in- cluding the lots, was dedicated April ninth, when Mr. Bodrug returned for a month's special evangelistic services in both New- ark and New York. As one result of the work thus far nine Ruthenian students are enrolled in Bloomfield Theological Sem- inary. In their restiveness and egress from the Greek Catholic Church the Ruthenians present a problem of peculiar difficulty, and yet one from which we may not turn and to which the Church must lend itself with patience and sympathy despite dangers of mistake or of being misunderstood.
