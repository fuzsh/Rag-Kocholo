        "text": "Pro soccer could be returning to Omaha.\n\nOmaha Storm Chasers owner Gary Green has tentatively agreed to lead an ownership group to bring a United Soccer League team to Omaha and eventually build a soccer stadium.\n\n“I think there’s a pumped-up demand for soccer in the city,” Green said.\n\nThe USL, the American soccer equivalent of Triple-A baseball, has been trying to launch an expansion team in Omaha for more than a year. The 30-team league plays a 32-game schedule from March through October.\n\nGreen said the venture is “in the exploratory stages.” He has not signed any paperwork, and numerous challenges remain, such as lining up more investors and finding a place to play.\n\nBut he said the ownership group is proceeding with the aim of launching a USL team in 2019 or later and building a soccer-specific stadium. The team would play at an existing venue in town until a stadium could be built.\n\nThe investors have not yet identified a location, a timeline or a price for such a stadium. The USL is asking all of its teams to play in a soccer-specific stadium or have plans to do so by 2020.\n\nFacilities capable of hosting pro soccer in the interim include TD Ameritrade Park, Creighton University’s Morrison Stadium, the Storm Chasers’ Werner Park and a few other sites.\n\nGreen’s interest comes after at least two brokers and one league official visited multiple times in the past year to try to recruit investors and secure a stadium deal.\n\nUSL spokesman Leonardo Santiago said there are several reasons the league is interested in Omaha:\n\n» The Omaha-Council Bluffs metro area has nearly 1 million people, with a growing community of millennials. (More than half of the pro soccer fan base is between the ages of 18 and 34.)\n\n» The city has four Fortune 500 companies, indicating that the business community is robust enough to sponsor a team or form other partnerships.\n\n» Omaha is close to other Midwest USL clubs.\n\nGreen also cited the city’s growing Hispanic population. Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses, Omaha’s Hispanic or Latino population rose from 7.5 percent to 13.1 percent.\n\nThe USL has been asking prospective investors for a $5 million expansion fee, plus $1 million to $1.5 million in staffing and other startup costs, according to those with knowledge of the expansion process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. An owner would then be expected to cover financial losses for the first few seasons.\n\nGreen said other investors are involved, but he declined to name them.\n\nThe USL wouldn’t be the first to bring the sport to the city, but previous ventures have struggled. Omaha had two prior soccer teams that played at lower levels — one amateur and one indoor team. Each folded within a few years because of poor attendance or profitability.\n\nThe amateur Omaha Flames (1996-98) and the professional Omaha Vipers (2010-11) both played in significantly lower levels of U.S. Soccer than the USL, and both played at least half of their season indoors. The Flames drew more than 3,000 fans per game to the Ak-Sar-Ben Coliseum over two seasons, and the Vipers drew about 2,700 per game during its lone season at the Civic Auditorium.\n\nBut the USL hopes that a higher quality of play and more star power would help a team succeed here.\n\nAnd there is already a soccer fan base. Creighton University’s men’s soccer team regularly ranks in the top five nationally in attendance, averaging about 3,300 fans in 2015, the NCAA’s most recent count. Down the road in Lincoln, the country’s largest U.S. National Soccer Teams’ supporters group, the American Outlaws, was founded and has an active Omaha chapter.\n\nWhen Green was first approached by a broker about investing in a USL team, he was hesitant to commit. He didn’t know much about soccer.\n\nHe has been trying to bring another pro sports team to Omaha for years. Green said he had an agreement with the NBA D-League for a team in Omaha, but he couldn’t agree to terms with an NBA partner.\n\n“We tried to negotiate an affiliate deal with the Denver Nuggets,” Green said. “It’s not happening.”\n\nThis spring, Green told Brent Lawrence, an independent broker and CEO of Accelerate Sports, that he would be willing to invest in a soccer team as a minority owner. Over the past few weeks, Lawrence urged him to reconsider a majority stake.\n\n“They gave me a pretty convincing story of how it could work,” Green said. “I was able to gauge the soccer community and dive into it and see the demand.”\n\nGreen said he thinks there’s enough hunger for soccer in Omaha. But he also said his group would invest in a local team only if it could be affiliated with a nearby Major League Soccer franchise.\n\nPeter Wilt, a former Major League Soccer general manager who has launched soccer teams in five American leagues, said he believes Omaha is ready. Wilt ranked Omaha the No. 1 available midsize market (750,000 to 1 million population) in the country in an article he wrote for quarterly soccer publication Howler magazine in October.\n\n“Omaha not only can absolutely support (a team), but can be a huge success,” Wilt said in an interview. “It could be something comparable to Cincinnati or Sacramento or Indianapolis,” cities that have drawn more than 10,000 fans per game in soccer’s minor leagues.\n\nNot everybody has jumped at the chance.\n\nThe country’s other Division II league below Major League Soccer, the North American Soccer League, looked at the city in 2011 but never seriously pursued a franchise here. The NASL’s interim commissioner, Rishi Sehgal, said he’d like to visit Omaha but has no concrete plans to do so.\n\nIf added to the 30-team USL, Omaha would rank in the league’s bottom quarter of cities in population.\n\nIn similar-size Midwestern cities where the only pro sport in town is minor league baseball, soccer clubs have done well. The Tulsa Roughnecks averaged 3,950 fans per game in 2016 — above the league average — in a metro area with a population roughly comparable to Omaha’s. Louisville City FC drew 7,218 fans per game in a metro area of 1.3 million. Both teams ranked in the top quarter in attendance last year.\n\nThe USL is in a period of rapid expansion, growing from 11 teams in 2012 to 30 teams this season. It was elevated from Division III in U.S. Soccer to Division II in January.\n\nUSL Commissioner Jake Edwards has said the league intends to shift from a two-conference system — Western and Eastern — into a three-conference system, adding a Central conference. Omaha is a key market in that plan.\n\nCurrently USL teams play a schedule made up almost exclusively of in-conference foes, to keep travel expenses low. An Omaha team might play existing USL teams in Kansas City; Tulsa; Oklahoma City; St. Louis; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati; San Antonio and Edinburg, Texas.\n\nAt this stage, Green said, all he and the league are doing is exchanging financial figures. He said he has not held discussions with any of the city’s stadium operators to finalize an agreement regarding a place to play in the short term.\n\nHowever, before the league reached an agreement with Green, a different broker met with the operators of TD Ameritrade Park and Morrison Stadium.\n\nRoger Dixon, president and CEO of the Metropolitan Entertainment and Convention Authority, which runs TD Ameritrade Park, said he wants to host soccer. However, he said a team can’t play there until after the College World Series concludes in late June, because of scheduling conflicts with Creighton baseball, wear on the field and the effort to transition between soccer and baseball fields.\n\nThe USL could try to work around the ballpark’s schedule by having very few home games for Omaha until after the College World Series. Elsewhere, four USL teams coexist with baseball teams. Even the New York Yankees share their stadium with a soccer team, Major League Soccer’s New York City FC.\n\nStill, if TD Ameritrade Park doesn’t work in the spring, there’s another option: Creighton’s 7,500-capacity Morrison Stadium. The stadium is limited from a premium ticket sales standpoint for the league, as it has only 2,000 actual seats, with berm seating accounting for the remainder of its capacity.\n\nCreighton’s director of athletics, Bruce Rasmussen, said the university would be interested in letting a pro team play a few spring games on Creighton’s field as long as it wouldn’t jeopardize the stadium’s tax-exempt status.\n\n“We have what we consider a great soccer facility and it’s probably underused,” Rasmussen said. “We would like to find more ways to use it to raise more money for Creighton athletics and Creighton University, so we are not averse to using it.”\n\nAny plan to build a stadium will come in the future, Green said.\n\nWhile he has agreed to lead the effort to bring soccer to Omaha, Green emphasized that it’s not a done deal.\n\nThe minor league baseball owner put it in American football terms: The project is still a long way from the end zone. “I would say we’re at our own 20 (yard line).”\n\nchris.peters@owh.com, 402-444-1734, twitter.com/_ChrisPeters\n\nIf a team comes to Omaha, the United Soccer League would also seek to build a pro soccer stadium.
