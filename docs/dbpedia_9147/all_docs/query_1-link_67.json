What's a gym without cheering fans and a heart-pumping, adrenaline rushing volleyball or basketball game taking place? Not quite ready for the fans or the games, the gym barely got finished in time to show it off during the school tours. Ghost Town... Most likely one of the only times the hallways of Southwest were quiet or without people. The second floor commons area hosted many students between classes and before school. For many it was the perfect place to study on the benches or hang out with friends. Hard Hat Area...For many months, the people of Lincoln could only drive by and get a frontal view of Southwest. We could only imagine what the building could look like on the inside. Finally, in late Ju ly, the doors were opened for all of Lincoln to see what we had anxiously awaited.2 Opening\n\nP:06\n\nFrom the fire t ground Freaking inthe fall of Where Should We Sit?...T h e commons area was home to Southwest dances, and, of course, lunch.1 0 0 0 to the first- day of echool, students from allj The open-air commons was a new concept foriround contemplated th e Important decision to many people, and took a little time for some tomake the switch\\\" to Lincoln Southwest. warm up to.

The Lincoln Stars announcer introduces coaches and the homecoming nominees. The first pep rally had a large turnout where both students and staff and even parents attended. The pep rally introduced the school's new fight song which was adapted from the University of Iowa's. S ch ool's Out...The days were long for both students and staff, and the dismissal bell was often welcomed by all. Many felt the 3:17 P.M. dismissal was a late time to get out of school. Som e working students found it difficult to make it to their jobs on time. To make a long day longer, the clocks were often running behind at the beginning of the year. Some days the dismissal bell didn't ring until after 3:20. Heading Home... Many students wait outside for awhile before heading home. While students are waiting for their ride or for the line of cars to die down, they kill time by talking with friends, playing hacky sack, or even playing catch. The parking lot quickly fills up and it can take quite some time before it's your turn to leave.4 Opening\n\nP:08\n\n=rom Blueprint#... / ...to Footprints Although 1,152 otudonts represented Un- B oogie Night...

Some seniors knew exactly w hat they were doing next year, as in what school they were going to and what they would major in. Other seniors had no idea. Another big decision to think about was if they wanted to leave home.

A question that seniors got asked a lot is w hy they did change schools their senior year. Seniors changed schools for various reasons. Some were as simple as the location of the school or the student population. Others came in hopes of having more ties and being more involved. Many seniors saw greater opportunities in sports and classes. For others, they saw the chance to start new traditions and to be a part of the m any firsts at Southwest. \\\"I didn't like the politics at my old school, and I wanted to start something new for some of the sports teams here,\\\" Dayna Waechter said.

Growing up in the 80's and 90's opened our eyes to m any unique trends that wewill remember forever. \\\"I remember w hen I would carry my Bart Simpson lunchbox to school/' Trent Blackwell said. Many of the things that we remember from our childhood aren't around today. Remember when theMcDonald's Happy Meals came in boxes or w hen you spent more time decorating your bike with pom-pomsand noisemakers than you spent riding it. \\\"I always would carry around a Miss Piggy doll that I was obsessed with,\\\" Dayna Waechter said. We also had our very own way of dressing w hen we were young. Anything from the shoes we hador the way we wore our hair we can look back and laugh at. We w ould see girls dressed in spandex pantswith a long sweatshirt or a tee-shirt tied at the side. Their hair would be in a pony tail on the side just likeMichelle Tanner from the television show \\\"Full House.\\\" The guys were obsessed with tennis shoes andjerseys, acid washed jeans and baseball caps. \\\"I would always wear leggings and shoulder pads. Also, I remember crimped hair and big puffybangs,\\\" Kerie Kvassey said. \\\"I remember wearing sweatpants and wind pants a lot. I loved w hen the Nike Air pum p shoes werein,\\\" Tyler Raasch said. No matter how goofy we looked, at the time, we thought we were the coolest kids around. Lucky forus, our parents took a lot of pictures. This way, w hen we are parents our kids can look at them and laugh athow dumb we really looked. You probably knew that looking back at the tears will make you laugh. I betyou never knew looking back at the laugh will make you cry.

Freshman A. k b I-ootbaLL High hopes... Punting the football with âhighâ hopes is Nic Moore as the Reserve football team Go, Fight, Win! plays Lincoln East. The final score was 0-69. The reserve and freshman football teams didnât have experience together as teams, butthey didnât let that show on the field. Each of the teams worked together to form the firstreserve, freshman A, and freshman B football teams at Lincoln Southwest. As head freshman football coach, Dan Carpenterâs ultimate goal for the freshman teamwas to prepare his young athletes for the next level. Some players will go on to junior varsityor even varsity. He wanted to make sure he has helped them to better learn the fundamenÂ­tals of football so that when they step on the field as a sophomore, they do not have to becoached on those fundamentals. Confidence, speed, and size benefited the Freshman A Football Team as they battledfor their own wanning record. Reserve coach Jim Danson expected the team would play their best, play together as ateam, and would get better at every game. Danson envisioned that the end of the season theteam would play hard and learn important life lessons such as howto overcome adversity andcooperate with each other. âTo have unity and mental discipline and to stay in the program (football) next year,âis what Adam Turner of the freshman B football team said was what the teamâs expectationswere. The teams played with pride and sportsmanship. Determination and teamwork on thefield aided these players in times of victory or defeat. Spread by Heather BentleyITngoinâ in...

The lasting lucky charm swere the green rocks the players received from their parents before the season began.The girls kept the rocks with them during every game. They tried m any things to bringluck to th e team , but ultim ately they relied on th eir skill an d te am unity to be successÂ­ful. âWe played a tough schedule against m any rate d team s, b u t we learned a lot,âCoach Mary Schropfer said. âT he te a m m ay not have h a d a winning season, b u t we gave 110% in everypractice and game and held a good attitude throughout the season,â said junior GenaRomano. âWe improved on every aspect of the game.
