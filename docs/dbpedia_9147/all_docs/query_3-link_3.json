        "text": "The Nebraska State Fair Planning Committee gave the green light to the Fonner Park master plan proposal at their meeting on Monday.\n\nA press release sent to NTV News Friday morning said the committee is serving as sponsor acting on behalf of entities that utilize and support the Fonner Park Campus including Fonner Park, Nebraska State Fair, Heartland Events Center, Grand Island Livestock Complex Authority (GILCA), Grand Island Area Chamber of Commerce, Grand Island & Hall County Convention and Visitors Bureau, Hall County Agricultural Society, Grow Grand Island, Hall County, the City of Grand Island and the new to be built Grand Island Casino Resort.\n\nOrganizers said this blue print for the next chapter for the fairgrounds will retain the distinctive characteristics of Fonner Park while enhancing the beauty and identifying facilities needed to accommodate future generations.\n\n“This is the perfect moment for the Campus Stakeholders to plan for its future,” said Terry Galloway, chairman of the Board for the Nebraska State Fair 1868 Foundation. “We look forward to working with the team at Populous to create the blueprint for our exciting next chapter. In doing so, we want to retain the distinctive characteristics of the Fonner Park Campus while at the same time enhancing the beauty of the campus and identifying facilities needed to accommodate future generations.”\n\nThe Master Planning Process is set to begin in early August with existing venue and market assessment followed by Stakeholder and Public Engagement Meetings. Site and venue planning will determine the overall cost structure and feasibility of the campus-wide plan which will be presented to the members of the Master Planning Committee in December of 2021.\n\n“Our Populous led team of national subject matter experts and local design and construction professionals are full of excitement and anticipation for the opportunity to partner with the 1868 Foundation and its many stakeholders for this strategic master plan,” said Charlie Kolarik, Principal-in-Charge, Populous, Inc.\n\nKolarik also said, \"Fonner Park is known locally as an economic engine and hub for community events and entertainment while nationally recognized as a premiere agricultural event venue and race course. Our team is honored to have the opportunity to help craft a strategic vision that will enhance this reputation and identify exciting new opportunities for years to come.\"\n\nBill Ogg, Nebraska State Fair executive director said, \"Populous is one of the premier public events venue planners with uniquely strong experience in equine and racing facilities. They partnered with an outstanding team of economic consultants, local and regional engineering and architectural expertise to present the best choice for leading this long range planning exercise.\"\n\nKolarik said they will explore the culture and character of Fonner Park and remain true to the values of Gus and Emma Fonner, their peers and the many leaders who have shaped the campus as a community gathering place."
