You'll have to trade in your backpack or purse for a clear bag if you plan on going to events at the Heartland Events Center.

The HEC began a clear bag policy Monday for ticketed events at the Eihusen Arena.

It's similar to what you might see at a Husker game and other major events in Nebraska. Fans can bring clear plastic bags no larger than a one-gallon Ziploc bag, however small clutches about the size of a hand are allowed. Exceptions will be made for approved medical bags and equipment.

"We see it at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, and it's just essentially the same rules that you will see here in Nebraska at the Heartland Events Center that you might see at Madison Square Garden in New York or Wrigley Field in Chicago," said Chris Kotulak, chief operating officer at Fonner Park.

The new policy doesn't apply to events where people don't buy tickets, or to races at Fonner Park.

Heartland Events Center will also sell approved bags for $8 per bag, which you can buy at the Box Office during events or Fonner Park General Offices.

"The idea behind the clear bag policy is primarily for the convenience and safety for not only our guests, but for our employees here at the Heartland Events Center in keeping with what has been seen across the nation as far as security measures," Kotulak said.

They'll be implementing the policy for the first time at this weekend's Nebraska Danger Football Game. It'll be applicable for all ticketed events from here on out.
