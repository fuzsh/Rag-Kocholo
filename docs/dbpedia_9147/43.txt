Fonner Park Review

Update, Dec 2022: Grand Island Casino Resort temporary facility opened on Dec. 27, 2022, and is located in the concourse of Fonner Park adjacent to the Van Berg Racing Collection

and the Nebraska Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame display, and features about 300 slot machines, horse betting kiosks, simulcasting, a snack bar and Elite Casino's Resort Club. Table games including blackjack and craps will reportedly be added later in 2023. The new $100 million casino at Grand Island Casino Resort is slated to open in the first quarter of 2025.

----------------------------------

Located just off Interstate 80 in Grand Island, Nebraska, Fonner Park dates back to the 1950s when it was farmland property set on the outskirts of Grand Island owned and operated by Gus and Emma Fonner. In 1953 the Fonner's sold their land that became known as Fonner Park to the Hall County Livestock Improvement Association and became the permanent home of the Hall County Fair. In 1954, the first year of live thoroughbred horse racing was held at the track, with thirteen days of racing. Fast forward to May 27, 2020, and Fonner Park adapted a standard 11-week racing season into a 15-week season, totaling 40 days of live racing.

In addition to live horse racing and live streaming and replays, the 220-acre Fonner Park Complex hosts national livestock shows, the Hall County Fair, the Nebraska State Fair and is the home of the ASKARBEN 4-H Stock Show and Nebraska State 4-H Horse Show, event and conference facilities, a restaurant and keno area, an RV & campground, and the coming Grand Island Casino Resort.
