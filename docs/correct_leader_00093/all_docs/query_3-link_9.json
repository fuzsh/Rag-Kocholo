        "text": "THE EUROPEAN UNION is at heart an economic and trade project built on its foundation as a customs union. The 1980s saw the addition of the single market, the world’s most deeply integrated economic union, followed a decade later by the launch of the single currency. But beyond finance and economics, the EU has traditionally had few pretensions. In 1991 Mark Eyskens, then Belgium’s foreign minister, summed it up as an economic giant, a political dwarf and a military worm.\n\nThe focus on economics worked fine so long as European countries could rely for their security on NATO and the protection of the United States. This arrangement continued to function through the break-up of the Soviet empire and the expansion of both NATO and, later, the EU itself. But with Russia led by a newly belligerent Vladimir Putin, Turkey under an increasingly distant Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Middle East a more violent mess than ever, Britain preparing to leave the EU and an apparently more isolationist America, it is no longer enough. The union clearly needs to focus more on strengthening its common foreign and security policy (CFSP)."
