The treaty, which includes a preamble\n\nand 23 articles, is based on the boundary situation existing at the time of\n\nthe cessation of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1991). The\n\ntreaty has not yet entered into force, but is provisionally applied from the date of\n\nits signature (article 22, para. 1).\n\nThe main purpose of the treaty is the delimitation of the land boundary, which\n\nis drawn on 86 sheets of maps (scale 1 :25,000) annexed to the treaty. It is however\n\nprovided that the expert bodies of the two countries shall elaborate a detailed\n\ndescription of the land and maritime boundary and a list of coordinates.\n\nOne provision (article 4, para. 3) relates to the maritime boundary, stating as\n\nfollows: \"The state boundary at sea is a median line betwel~n the land territories\n\nof Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in accordance with the 1982 United Nations\n\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. The boundary at sea is shown on the topographical\n\nmap 1:25,000 and on the navigational charts and maps\" (unofficial translation\n\nfrom the original Serb-Croatian language). This is the first maritime boundary agreed\n\nupon by two of the successor States of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nI.I. Charney and R. W. Smith (eds.), Intt!rnational Maritime Boundaries, 2887-2900.\n\n© 2002, The American Society of International Law. Printed in the Netherlands.\n\n2888 Report Number 8-14\n\nThe maritime delimitation is to be understood in the light of the very particular\n\ngeographic situation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Adriatic Sea. This country\n\nexercises sovereignty over a narrow strip of about 20 kilometers (kIn.) of coastline,\n\nthe Neum corridor (called from the name of a small city located there), which is\n\nenclosed between two parts of the Croatian coastline. More precisely, the maritime\n\nareas adjacent to the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina are composed of the waters\n\nof the Bay of Klek-Neum, a deep indentation closed by the small peninsula of Klek\n\n(belonging to Bosnia-Herzegovina), and part of the waters located between the\n\npeninsula of Klek and the much bigger and longer peninsula of Peljesac (belonging\n\nto Croatia). The width of the waters located between the two peninsulas ranges from\n\n1.5 to 2 kIn.\n\nThe waters adjacent to the peninsula of Peljesac, both on the landward and the\n\nseaward side of it, fall within the straight baselines system established by the former\n\nYugoslavia in 1948 and confIrmed, with some modifIcations, by the successor State\n\nof Croatia (article 19 of the Maritime Code of 27 January 1994).1 It follows that\n\nthe maritime boundary established by the 1999 treaty possibly delimits two distinct\n\nlegal regimes: the internal waters of Croatia from the territorial sea of BosniaHerzegovina.\n\n2\n\nIn regard to the method of delimitation, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, which\n\nare both parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),\n\nrely on equidistance. Article 4, paragraph 3, of the bilateral treaty expIicity recalls\n\nthe \"median line\" as a method which is \"in accordance\" with the UNCLOS. In fact,\n\nthere is no provision in the UNCLOS dealing with the very peculiar case of a\n\ndelimitation involving internal waters. However, article 15 of the UNCLOS (Delimitation\n\nof the territorial sea between States with opposite or adjacent coasts),\n\nwhich could be applied by analogy, is based on the rule of equidistance combined\n\nwith the exception of historic title or other special circumstances.\n\nNo bilateral agreement has so far been concluded with regard to the access to\n\nand from the waters of Bosnia-Herzegovina through the surrounding Croatian internal\n\nwaters. However, under another bilateral agreement Croatia has granted to Bosnia-\n\n42 LOS BULL. 31 (2000).\n\n2 However, it seems that Bosnia-Herzegovina bas so far made no official enactment or statement with\n\nregard to the legal status of the waters adjacent to its tenitory.

It begins at Boundary Pillar 0 on the seashore\n\nand follows a stra ight line for 2.84 kilometers where it meets the equidistant line and\n\nproceeds seaward on that line. The agreement calls for the establishment of a Joint\n\nTeam of Experts (JTE) to delimit the maritime boundary by geographic coordinates.\n\nAt the time this report was written the JTE had not issued its report. Furthermore, the\n\nexact coordinates of Boundary Pillar 0 are not known. Thus, the location, direction\n\nand nature of the straight 2.84 kilometer line cannot be ascertained at this time.I\n\nThe delimitation was expected to be completed by the end of 1996. Until the\n\nlocation of Boundary Pillar 0 and the delimitation by the JTE are known it is difficult\n\nto make a detailed analysis ofthe agreement. In fact, the short agreem ent is more\n\nin the nature of an agreement to agree. The land boundary between Israel and Jordan\n\nat the shore is located at the northern end ofthe Gulf. From this point the Gulf is long\n\nand narrow running south to the Red Sea. Based upon the limited information available\n\nand the geographical circumstances it appears that due to the generally even\n\nshoreline and the sharp curvature in the vicinity of the Israel-Jordan boundary; an\n\nequidistant line would not have any unusual characteristics. The straight line from\n\nBoundary Pillar 0 for the relatively short distance probably was designed to make\n\nthe boundary easy to locate in the near shore area and to avoid any irregularities that\n\nmight be created by minor variations in the shoreline .\n\nEgypt and Saudi Arabia also have coastlines on the Gulf of Aqaba and a maritime\n\ndelimitation between Israel as well as Jordan will also be necessary to complete\n\nthe maritime boundaries in this water body. The Egypt-Israel land boundary also is\n\nlocated in the northern part of the Gulf. Israel has the shortest coastline among these\n\nLetter to Jonathan I.

Jordan's is somewhat longer with the coastlines of Egypt and\n\nSaudi Arabia comprising most of the coastline along the western and eastern shores,\n\nrespectively. A tri-junction of the Egyptian-Israeli-Jordanian maritime boundaries\n\nmay very well be located in the northern sector, if and when the maritime boundary\n\nbetween Egypt and Israel is established. Thus, it would appear that Israel's maritime\n\nzone in this water body will not be as substantial as the others if the Egyptian-Israeli\n\nmaritime boundary also is an equidistant line.\n\nInterestingly, the Israeli shoreline is located on a concave coast and is flanked by\n\nJordan on one side and Egypt on another. Thus, the situation is much like that of the\n\nshoreline Federal Republic ofGermany in its relation to those ofthe Netherlands and\n\nDenmark on the North Sea that was addressed in the judgment of the International\n\nCourt of Justice in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases (FRG v. Den., FRG v.\n\nNeth.), 1969 LC.J. Rep. 3 (29 February) . That judgment called for a maritime boundary\n\ndelimitation that is more generous to the state in the middle (Israel in this situation)\n\nthan equidistance. It is notable that Israel has here accepted an equidistant line. On\n\nthe other hand, recognition of such an Israeli maritime zone in the Gulfhas polit ical\n\nconnections to the current peace process and Israel's insistence on navigational and\n\nother rights in the Gulf.\n\nRELATED LAW IN FORCE\n\nLaw ofthe Sea Conventions\n\nIsrael:\n\nJordan:\n\nneither a signatory nor party to the 1982 LOS Convention\n\nparty to the 1982 LOS Convention, 27 November 1995.\n\nPrepared by Jonathan I.

The boundary extends for total distances of\n\napproximately 15 nautical miles (n.m.) through the territorial sea and approximately\n\n28 n.m. across the continental shelf, making a total length of about 43 n.m. The\n\nboundary runs generally north-westwards from the terminus of the land frontier to\n\nan endpoint situated on the agreed boundary between the British and Dutch continental\n\nshelves (Netherlands-United Kingdom (1965 and 1971) No. 9-13). The territorial\n\nsea boundary is based on the principle of equidistance between the normal baselines\n\nof the two states. Its course was simplified on an area-compensated basis. Certain\n\nhistoric claims made in the past by the Netherlands appear to have been tacitly\n\nrenounced by the agreement. The continental shelf boundary is a single line drawn\n\non a similar basis, but with the difference that a Dutch basepoint, situated on a lowtide\n\nelevation, was accorded only one quarter weight vis-a-vis the Belgian basepoint\n\n(harbor works on the coast) in order to achieve an equitable result. An informal\n\nadministrative accord, which had been observed in practice for some time, albeit\n\nwithout removing all differences between the two governments, was replaced by\n\ni.I.

Printed in the Netherlands.\n\n2922 Report Number 9-21\n\ntwo new boundaries defined in two treaties. Special arrangements were made for\n\nthe continuation of some sand and gravel concessions previously granted by the\n\nNetherlands in areas lying on the Belgian side of the new boundaries. The two\n\nagreements appear to have resolved some long-standing maritime differences between\n\nBelgium and the Netherlands going back to the creation of Belgium in 1830, differences\n\nwhich had prevented the reaching of agreement during the 1960s.\n\nII CONSIDERATIONS\n\n1 Political, Strategic, and Historical Considerations\n\nBelgium and the Netherlands are closely bound politically and economically in\n\ngroupings such as the Benelux, the European Union (of which they were founding\n\nmembers), and NATO. These close relations no doubt facilitated the conclusion\n\nof the two agreements, which finally put an end to long-standing differences which\n\nhad existed for as long as the Kingdom of Belgium.\n\nA political factor on the side of Belgium was its constitution. In recent years,\n\nBelgium became a federal state and the entire coast lies in the Region of Flanders.\n\nThe authorities in that Region have competence over certain activities in the territorial\n\nsea and on the continental shelf and they were, no doubt, especially interested\n\nin achieving a favorable outcome to the outstanding boundary questions. For the\n\nKingdom of Belgium, the negotiations with The Hague were conducted by the\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, but in view of the constitutional aspects, representatives\n\nof the Region of Flanders were associated with the talks. There was no comparable\n\nsituation on the part of the Netherlands.\n\nThe waters off the coasts of the two states are used extensively by international\n\nshipping in transit to and from Northern Europe or calling at major ports such as\n\nAntwerp and Rotterdam. Sea lanes have been agreed within the International Maritime\n\nOrganization in these waters, but the sea lanes were not taken into account\n\nin drawing the boundaries.\n\nTwo historical issues were considered during the negotiations between the two\n\ngovernments, one relating to the territorial sea and the other to the continental shelf.\n\nThe first such issue arose from the fact that the land frontier between Belgium and\n\nthe Netherlands reaches the sea near the mouth of a wide river known as the Western\n\nScheidt, a waterway at this point under the sovereignty of the Netherlands. The\n\nNetherlands had for many years asserted historic rights to a channel of deeper water\n\nrunning out seawards from the Western Scheidt and in a sense representing a natural\n\nBelgium-Netherlands 2923\n\ncontinuation or marine extension of the Western Scheldt.1 This channel, known\n\nas the Wielingen, ran within 3 n.m. of the Belgian coast. The channel had strategic\n\nsignificance in former times and is still used by shipping entering the Western\n\nScheIdt in order to reach points in the Netherlands, as well as Antwerp. If Belgium\n\nhad accepted the asserted Dutch historic rights over the Wielingen, the result would\n\nhave been a boundary running much closer to the Belgian coast than an equidistant\n\nline. These rights were asserted by the Netherlands on two main grounds. First,\n\nthe terms of the Treaty of Munster of 1648 had closed the ScheIdt to the Belgian\n\nprovinces to the benefit of the Netherlands. When, following pressure from France\n\nand England, the waterway was later opened to shipping, it was nevertheless agreed\n\nin the Treaty of London of 1839 that the Netherlands and Belgium would supervise\n\nnavigation jointly, thereby accepting some Dutch interest in the waterway. 2 Second,\n\nthe Netherlands contended that the Wielingen formed part, that is to say, a seaward\n\nextension of the Western ScheIdt waterway and was thus under Dutch sovereignty.\n\nAt the end of the maritime boundary negotiations, the historic claim of the Netherlands\n\nhad been renounced, according to a report presented to the Belgian Senate\n\nduring its consideration of the agreement.3 The agreed boundary appears to be\n\nclearly inconsistent with the continuance of Dutch claims to historic rights or title.\n\nThe second historical issue concerned an informal understanding reached in 1965\n\nbetween officials of the two Governments. Following the entry into force of the\n\nConvention on the Continental Shelf in 1964, the Netherlands held bilateral talks\n\nwith all its neighbors about the delimitation of the Dutch continental shelf. The\n\ncontacts with Belgium, an adjacent state, related to both the continental shelf and\n\nthe territorial sea in view of the linkage between the two boundaries. These contacts\n\nresulted in an understanding upon a line of delimitation across the continental shelf\n\nstarting at the limit of the territorial sea, which at that time was 3 n.m. for both\n\nstates. This understanding did not represent a treaty or international agreement in\n\nthe formal sense. Nonetheless, a text was agreed at official, as opposed to Minister-\n\nSee, for example, the response of the Netherlands to the circular inquiry from the League of Nations\n\nin preparation for the Codification Conference held at The Hague in 1930, in Bases de discussion,\n\nVol. II: Eaux territoriales, League of Nations doc. C.74.M.39 (1929). The Dutch reply argued that\n\nthe rights of a coastal state over the belt of sea in front of its coast could be limited or excluded by\n\nspecial rights of a neighbor, giving the example of the Wielingen on the twin grounds of historic rights\n\nand navigational interests, whilst noting that Belgium contested them.

Furthermore, a draft text was\n\ndrawn up for the delimitation of the territorial sea, but this text was expressly subject\n\nto Dutch reservations concerning historic rights. No texts were presented to the\n\nrespective Legislatures for approval. On the side of Belgium, this was because the\n\nNetherlands maintained the claim to the Wielingen, a claim which Belgium continued\n\nto contest. In other words, in 1965 there was still some disagreement over the\n\ndelimitation of the territorial sea.\n\nThe line of delimitation was a technical elaboration of the principle of\n\nequidistance accepted by both sides. Over many years, this informally agreed line\n\nacross the continental shelf was generally (but not uniformly) followed in practice\n\nby both governments in several important ways. Thus, the leader of the Belgian\n\ndelegation for the delimitation of the continental shelf between Belgium and the\n\nNetherlands had sent a diplomatic letter in 1967 to the leader of the Netherlands\n\ndelegation for use by the latter in the International Court of Justice in connection\n\nwith the North Sea Continental Shelf cases which were then pending before the\n\nCourt.4 This letter, dated 8 December 1967, asserted the principle of the 'median\n\nline' (la ligne mediane) between the nearest points on the baselines for measuring\n\nthe breadth of the territorial sea and specified the coordinates of eight points to be\n\njoined by arcs of great circles in order to constitute the delimitation between Belgium\n\nand the Netherlands, all subject to the approval of the Belgian Parliament.s In\n\nsubsequent years, Belgium twice enacted legislation based on that position: first\n\nin 1969 relating to the continental shelf, and then in 1978 relating to fisheries. The\n\nLaw of 1969 referred expressly to Belgium's three outstanding delimitations of the\n\ncontinental shelf with France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and indicated\n\nthat the principle of equidistance would be determinative in each case.6 The Law\n\nof 1978 employed the equidistant line to define limits towards Belgium's three\n\nneighbors7 and a Parliamentary Report set out as the boundary with the Netherlands\n\nthe same eight points which had been informally listed in the understanding relating\n\nto the continental shelf.8\n\n4 North Sea Continental Shelf (FRGlDen.; FRGlNeth.), 1969 ICJ REP. 3 (20 February).\n\nS See North Sea Continental Shelf (FRGlDen.; FRGlNeth.), ICJ PLEADINGS, vol.

ParI. Charnbre No. 263-2, at 3 (1977-1978).\n\nBelgium-Netherlands 2925\n\nFor its part, the Netherlands also acted on the basis of the understanding with\n\nBelgian officials. Thus, the Netherlands granted certain concessions for the taking\n\nof sand and gravel which extended towards the line of delimitation drawn up by\n\nthe officials and across the more northerly line eventually agreed between the two\n\ngovernments.9 The Netherlands also concluded the agreement with the United\n\nKingdom on the delimitation of the continental shelf of 1965 which defined a\n\nboundary extending to a tripoint which was equidistant between the nearest points\n\nin Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Article 2(1) of this agreement\n\nexpressly describes the southern termination point as \"The point of intersection of\n\nthe dividing lines between the Continental Shelves of the United Kingdom ... ,\n\nthe Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Belgium.\" ((1965) No 9-13,\n\nat 1867).\n\nIn 1987, Belgium extended the breadth of its territorial sea from 3 n.m. to 12\n\nn.m., following a similar extension by the Netherlands two years earlier. At some\n\nstage prior to the opening of negotiations with The Hague, the Belgian government\n\nconcluded that the administrative accord on delimitation reached with the Netherlands\n\nin 1965 was no longer acceptable. In 1991, Belgium formally notified the United\n\nKingdom, upon signing their bilateral agreement delimiting their continental shelves\n\n«1991) No. 9-17, letter of 29 May 1991 from Mark Eyskens, Belgian Minister of\n\nForeign Affairs, to British Ambassador Robert James O'Neill), of its intention to\n\nclaim north-eastwards of the tripoint where the Belgian, British and Dutch continental\n\nshelves met according to the above-cited agreement of 1965 (No. 9-13). In other\n\nwords, Belgium did not regard itself as bound, as a third state, by the Anglo-Dutch\n\ntreaty.\n\nDuring the new rounds of negotiations instigated by Belgium with the Netherlands\n\nin 1994, Belgium asserted in the alternative, first, that there had been no\n\nagreement on the delimitation in 1965 and, second, that the informal line should\n\nnot be followed because of the evolution of international law after that date towards\n\nacceptance of considerations of equity. In this context, Belgium cited article 83 of\n\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, which had entered\n\ninto force on 16 November 1994, the day preceding the opening of the first round\n\nof talks. (At that stage both Belgium and the Netherlands were moving towards\n\nratification of the Convention and the related Implementation Agreement of July\n\n1994.)\n\n9 These concessions fonned the subject of an exchange of letters at the time of signature of the agreements,\n\naccording to which Belgium in effect took over the concessions. See Erik Francn, loc.cit.\n\nfootnote I, 387-92.\n\n2926 Report Number 9-21\n\nFor its part, the Netherlands was at first disinclined to open talks, since the Dutch\n\nauthorities regarded the delimitation of 1965 as final. When talks did begin, the\n\nNetherlands argued that the delimitation had subsisted for many years and could\n\nnot be put in question, having regard to the principle of estoppel. Accordingly, the\n\nNetherlands considered that the negotiations should be confined to two matters:\n\nfirst, the delimitation of the territorial sea and second, the repercussions for the\n\nstarting point of the continental shelf delimitation of 1965 arising from the extensions\n\nin 1985 and 1987, respectively, of the breadth of the territorial sea from 3 to 12\n\nn.m.1O During the course of the ensuing talks, the Netherlands did not insist on\n\nthe point of view and, on this second historical point, Belgium's approach also\n\nprevailed. As a result, the agreed line for the continental shelf is different from that\n\ndefined in 1965.\n\n2 Legal Regime Considerations\n\nSeparate agreements were concluded for the territorial sea and for the continental\n\nshelf. Different solutions were adopted in the two agreements and slightly different\n\nmethods were used. This approach of dealing separately with the territorial sea and\n\nthe continental shelf was also adopted by Belgium in its agreements with France\n\n«(1990) No. 9-16) and by the Netherlands in those with Germany «(1962, 1964,\n\n1967, and 1971) No. 9-11).\n\nThe agreement relating to the continental shelf provides that if one of the parties\n\ndecides to establish an exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the coordinates of the agreed\n\ncontinental shelf boundary shall be used for the lateral delimitation of the zone\n\n(article 2). Prior to the opening of negotiations in 1994, both states had created\n\nfishery zones extending beyond the territorial sea to the greatest possible extent,\n\nbut no fisheries boundary had been agreed. Both states had participated in the\n\nadoption of the Paris Declaration of 1992 on Coordinated Extension of Jurisdiction\n\nin the North Seall and during the period of the talks they were committed in principle\n\nto creating EEZs in the North Sea. In the event, both Belgium and the Netherlands\n\ncreated EEZs in 1999 and the effect of article 2 of the continental shelf\n\nagreement is that the agreed line serves also as the boundary between the two EEZs.\n\n10 This summary of the argumenlS is taken from the Expose des Motifs submitted by Ministers to the\n\nBelgian Senate. See document 1-843/1(Session of 1997-1998) of 15 January 1998.\n\n11 Report No.9-20, III INTERNATIONAL MARITIME BOUNDARIES 2527, at 2529. Northern and Western\n\nEurope Update, Principal Events in the Region, Sec. 4 Use oj Agreed Boundaries for Additional\n\nPurposes. (1998)\n\nBelgium-Netherlands 2927\n\n3 Economic and Environmental Considerations\n\nThe area of this delimitation is important from the economic point of view in the\n\nsense that it is a busy area for merchant shipping. There is also fishing, including\n\nshrimping, and dredging for sand and gravel. From the environmental point of view,\n\non the Belgian and southern Dutch coasts there are extensive sandy beaches which\n\nare much used by tourists and wildlife, especially sea birds. The water is shallow,\n\nmaking the coastal area especially vulnerable to oil spills. In 1993, a joint counterpollution\n\nexercise in the off-shore areas of the two states showed that the absence\n\nof a precise boundary constituted a serious obstacle to effective intervention by\n\nrescue and safety services. None of those considerations, however, affected the actual\n\ncourse of the negotiations or the agreed boundaries. The area is not important for\n\naccess to oil or gas resources. However, at the time of the negotiations, there was\n\nactive exploitation of continental shelf sand and gravel, by both parties, for the\n\nbuilding and construction industries in Belgium and the Netherlands. In particular,\n\nthe Netherlands had granted a concession to a Belgian company for the dredging\n\nof sand and gravel in an area close to the line agreed informally by officials of the\n\ntwo governments in 1965. This area became Belgian as a result of the agreement\n\non the delimitation of the continental shelf and the concession formed the object\n\nof an exchange of letters attached to the agreement. According to these letters,\n\nBelgium was committed to respecting the concession for five years after the entry\n\ninto force of the agreement and then to grant a concession to the same company\n\nunder similar conditions under Belgian law. Clearly, the existence of these specific\n\neconomic interests did not affect the course of the actual line agreed in the negotiations,\n\nbeing the subject of a type of 'grandfathering' provision. Such arrangements\n\nare not always easy to achieve and in this instance they testify to the close, friendly\n\nrelations existing between the two governments.\n\n4 Geographic Considerations\n\nA relevant factor in the negotiations was the overall geographical situation of\n\nBelgium, which has relatively short and generally straight and featureless coasts\n\nfacing the southern North Sea. Its boundaries with France and the United Kingdom\n\nhad been agreed «(1990) No. 9-16 and (1991) No. 9-17, respectively) and it was\n\napparent from a glance at the map that Belgium's continental shelf was hemmed\n\nin on all sides. To the north-east of the terminus of the land frontier between\n\nBelgium and the Netherlands, the peninsula of WaIcheren produces something of\n\na change in the general direction of the two coasts. This change in direction gave\n\n2928 Report Number 9-21\n\nthe impression that the Belgian coasts, lying between those of France to the southwest\n\nand the Netherlands to the north-east, were slightly concave.\n\n5 Islands, Rocks, Reefs, and Low-Tide Elevations Considerations\n\nWhilst there are no islands, rocks, or reefs in the relevant area, an important feature\n\nin the negotiations was the sandbank, constituting a low-tide elevation, known as\n\nRassen. This feature, lying approximately three kilometers (less than two n.m.) off\n\nthe westernmost point of the peninsula of Walcheren, is a legitimate basepoint for\n\nmeasuring the breadth of the territorial sea of the Netherlands. According to the\n\nlatest charts published in Belgium at the time of the negotiations, Rassen was about\n\n600 meters from east to west at low water. (Its extent at low water could have been\n\naffected by sand and gravel dredging.) Despite its not having been marked on some\n\nolder charts as a low-tide elevation, Belgium accepted Rassen as a valid low-tide\n\nelevation at the time of the negotiations, so long as the basepoint was on the actual\n\nlow water line and not on the 2 meter isobath which lay 1.8 n.m. further west.\n\nRassen's position is such that it represents the Dutch basepoint for constructing a\n\nstrict equidistant line with Belgium across the outer part of the territorial sea, as\n\nwell as the entire continental shelf. In other words, it is the principal Dutch basepoint\n\nfor constructing the greater part of the entire boundary.\n\nRassen is mentioned expressly in article 2 of the Agreement on the Delimitation\n\nof the Territorial Sea, but not in the Continental Shelf Agreement. Rassen was given\n\nfull weight in the Territorial Sea Agreement and one quarter weight in the Continental\n\nShelf Agreement.\n\nIt may be recalled that low-tide elevations had also been significant in Belgium's\n\nearlier negotiations with both France and the United Kingdom «(1990) No. 9-16\n\nand (1991) No. 9-17). In particular, Belgium had taken the initial position in the\n\nnegotiations with France that low-tide elevations, being relevant to the measurement\n\nof the territorial sea, should not be used as basepoints in delimiting the continental\n\nshelf, but had reached a compromise «(1990) No. 9-16, at sec. 5 Islands, Rocks,\n\nReefs, and Low-Tide Elevations Considerations). It would appear that Belgium made\n\na similar compromise over Rassen in regard to the continental shelf.\n\n6 Baseline Considerations\n\nThe relevance of baselines is shown by article 2 of the Territorial Sea Agreement\n\nwhich includes the following: \"The boundary ... is based on principle of equidistance\n\nBelgium-Netherlands 2929\n\nfrom the normal baseline, that is to say, the low water line along the coast\" (translation).\n\nBoth states have adopted for the normal baseline the line of mean lower\n\nlow water springs. However, two baseline issues arose during the negotiations. First,\n\nthe Netherlands had adopted legislation in 1985 whereby a line was drawn across\n\nthe mouth of the Western ScheIdt between Westkappelle on Walcheren and Zwin\n\nclose to the point where the land frontier reaches the sea. In drawing this line, the\n\nNetherlands invoked the rule in article 13 of the Convention on the Territorial Sea\n\nand the Contiguous Zone of 1958 and article 9 of the UN Convention on the Law\n\nof the Sea (regarding the closing mouths of rivers), although some commentators\n\nhave expressed the view that the river does not flow directly into the sea since it\n\nforms an estuary. Belgium considered that this baseline should not be taken into\n\naccount in delimiting the territorial sea since it deviated from the general direction\n\nof the Dutch coasts and the terminus of the land frontier was used as the end-point\n\nof the baseline, rather than the southern bank of the river. It is apparent that the\n\nbaseline was not used in any way in the agreement on the delimitation of the\n\nterritorial sea.\n\nThe second issue concerned the permanent harbor works on the Belgian coast\n\nat the port of Zeebrugge. Article 11 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea\n\nprovides that such works are to be regarded as forming part of the coast for the\n\npurpose of measuring the breadth of the territorial sea. In 1965, harbor works had\n\nbeen accepted by the officials of the two states as forming an integral part of the\n\ncoast for the purpose of drawing the equidistant line. Sometime between that year\n\nand 1994, the works had been extended seawards by the construction of new breakwaters\n\nmore than 1.6 n.m. from the coast. In the agreement of 1996, the Netherlands\n\naccepted that the new western breakwater should be used as a Belgian basepoint\n\nin drawing an equidistant line. Indeed, that point and the low water line on Rassen\n\nform the basepoints for constructing the greater part of the boundary in the territorial\n\nsea and the whole of the continental shelf boundary. Somewhat unusually, the\n\nmethod of delimitation and the key basepoints are mentioned in the terms of the\n\nagreement. Thus, article 2 of the Territorial Sea Agreement reads: \"Account has\n\nbeen taken of the seaward extension of the port of Zeebrugge in Belgium and the\n\nlow-tide elevation of 'Rassen' off the Netherlands coast.\" No comparable statement\n\nwas included in the continental shelf agreement.\n\n7 Geological and Geomorphological Considerations\n\nThere is no geological break in the area under consideration. A geomorphological\n\nfeature does exist, the channel known as the Wielingen representing the seaward\n\n2930 Report Number 9-21\n\nextension of the River ScheIdt; but this feature was not used in constructing the\n\nboundary. Further offshore are many elongated sandbanks running approximately\n\nsouth-west to north-east and thus, approximately, parallel to the general direction\n\nof the Dutch and Belgian coasts or at right angles to the agreed boundaries. In other\n\nwords, geological considerations were not used at all in drawing the boundaries.\n\n8 Method of Delimitation Considerations\n\nIn constructing both the territorial sea boundary and that for the continental shelf,\n\nthe method of equidistance was used in a modified form, albeit in different ways\n\nand with different results. The method was specified in the territorial sea agreement\n\n(article 2), but not in that on the continental shelf.\n\nThe territorial sea boundary was created by first drawing a strict equidistant\n\nline between the basepoints of the two states and then by simplifying it on an areacompensated\n\nbasis. The resulting line can be characterized as a simplified equidistant\n\nline. The initial exact equidistant line had two terminal points and 10 turning points,\n\nsome of which were very close together, especially in the area situated about five\n\nto seven n.m. from the coast where Rassen and the harbor works at Zeebrugge first\n\nbecome the respective basepoints. The line was simplified so that there were just\n\nthree turning points plus the start and end points, making five points in all.\n\nIn the case of the continental shelf boundary, the method of equidistance was\n\nused; but, in this instance, it was simply a first step in a process which continued\n\nwith the application of equitable principles. Belgium invoked the decision of the\n\nInternational Court of Justice in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases to the effect\n\nthat the method of equidistance was not a rule of international lawY Belgium\n\nargued that its geographical situation between France and the Netherlands was akin\n\nto Germany's concave coast lying between the Netherlands and Denmark. Belgium\n\nalso pointed to article 83 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and argued\n\nthat equitable principles should be taken into account in order to reach an equitable\n\nresult.\n\nIn a spirit of compromise and good neighborliness, the Netherlands agreed to\n\nan adjustment of the equidistant line. Throughout its length, this line was based\n\non the low water lines on the western breakwater at Zeebrugge and on Rassen. The\n\nadjustment was made by according Rassen one quarter weight and full weight to\n\nthe Belgian basepoint. For this purpose, two points were identified on the agreed\n\n12 North Sea Continental Shelf (FRGlDen.; FRGlNeth.), 1%9 leI REp. 3, at 36, 45·46, paras. 56,82\n\n(20 Feb.).\n\nBelgium-Netherlands 2931\n\nboundary between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the ftrst giving full\n\nweight to the western breakwater and Rassen and the second full weight to the\n\nbreakwater and the westernmost point on Walcheren (and thus zero weight to\n\nRassen). The agreed endpoint lies one quarter of the distance between the two points,\n\nstarting from the point generated by Walcheren. The change in the bearing of the\n\nline, as compared with the delimitation of 1965, is about 4 degrees.\n\nOverall, the Netherlands relinquished areas in both the territorial sea and the\n\ncontinental shelf which had been treated as Dutch after 1965. Together, these areas\n\ntotal about 386 square kilometers.\n\n9 Technical Considerations\n\nThe boundary line in the territorial sea boundary is deftned by reference to ftve\n\npoints:\n\nfrom 1 to 2, the distance is 0.53 n.m.;\n\nfrom 2 to 3, the distance is 4.76 n.m.;\n\nfrom 3 to 4, the distance is 3.79 n.m.; and\n\nfrom 4 to 5, the distance is 6.34 n.m.\n\nThe total length exceeds 12 n.m. because the line is not straight. The boundary line\n\nfor the continental shelf is a single arc from point 5 to point 6 which is 28.1 n.m.\n\nin length. The lines joining the agreed turning points are stated to be arcs of great\n\ncircles. The points are deftned by coordinates of latitude and longitude on European\n\nDatum (First Adjustment, 1950). This is made clear by article 1 of both agreements.\n\nThe boundary lines were depicted, but simply by way of illustration, on charts\n\nannexed to the two agreements.\n\nAlthough Belgium and the Netherlands both use the chart datum of Mean Lower\n\nLow Water Springs, they use slightly different deftnitions of that datum, producing\n\nslightly different results. However, the differences were successfully resolved\n\nbetween hydrographic experts.\n\n10 Other Considerations\n\nAt the time of its negotiations with Belgium, the Netherlands was also engaged\n\nin negotiations with Germany about their territorial sea boundary in the North Sea\n\nin which Germany was maintaining certain historic claims of relevance to that\n\ndelimitation.\n\n2932 Report Number 9-21\n\nThe delimitation of the continental shelf ends at a point on the boundary line\n\nagreed between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in 1965, but not at the\n\nsouthern terminal point. As a result, small adjustments to two existing boundaries\n\nare required. These are the boundaries between Belgium and the United Kingdom\n\n(an adjustment expressly foreshadowed in the Belgian Minister's letter addressed\n\nto the British Ambassador at the time of signature of the agreement) and between\n\nthe Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The former boundary will grow in length\n\nand the latter will shorten.\n\nill CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese two connected agreements illustrate two different roles for the method of\n\nequidistance: first, in providing the actual solution for the delimitation of the territorial\n\nsea (subject only to simplification of the resulting line for the sake of practical\n\nconvenience) and, second, as constituting the first stage of drawing a line in a twostage\n\nprocess prior to the adjustment of the line in order to achieve an equitable\n\nresult. Thus, for the purposes of delimiting the territorial sea, the two key basepoints\n\n(the harbor works at Zeebrugge and Rassen) can be seen as being roughly in balance,\n\nin that they were both situated about the same distance (1.6 n.m.) away from the\n\nprincipal coast. Then, in the delimitation of the continental shelf, the adjustment\n\nof the initial equidistant line partially discounted the low-tide elevation of Rassen\n\nin order to take account of the overall situation of Belgium on the southern shores\n\nof the North Sea.\n\nFrom a wider perspective, this delimitation was the last major boundary outstanding\n\nfor the entire North Sea continental shelf. All the other boundaries had previously\n\nbeen settled. However, the terms of the settlement for the continental shelf required\n\nsmall adjustments to be made to two existing agreements and, these adjustments\n\nnot having been made at the time of writing (August 2000), the major task of\n\nboundary-making for the North Sea continental shelf which began in the mid-1960s\n\nremains, technically, incomplete. At the same time, the agreement of 1996, by\n\nanticipating the creation of EEZs by the parties, defined an EEZ boundary which\n\ntook effect in the summer of 1999 as one of the first such boundaries in Northern\n\nand Western Europe.\n\nBelgium-Netherlands 2933\n\nIV RELATED LAW IN FORCE\n\nA.

The latter concerns a treaty, concluded on the same day between the same\n\nparties on the delimitation of the state boundary. A small part of that agreement\n\ndefines the territorial sea.2 Both agreements have much in common, especially\n\nregarding the delimitation of the maritime zones. Many matters, developed in the\n\nfirst report consequently apply to the second report.\n\nThis is the fourth agreement concluded during the second half of the 1990s in\n\nthe southeastern Baltic Sea that is directly related to the disintegration of the former\n\nUnofficial translation to be found in Erik Franckx, Two More Maritime BowuJary Agreements Concluded\n\nin the Eastern Baltic Sea in 1997, 13 INT'L 1. MAR. & COASTAL L. 274, at 282-83 (1998).\n\n2 In the Lithuanian official gazette this treaty on the state border, of which the territorial sea forms part,\n\nis of course, given its importance, treated in first order before the treaty on the exclusive economic\n\nzone (EEZ) and the continental shelf. In a study on maritime boundaries, however, a reversed order\n\nis to be preferred.\n\n1.1. Charney and R. W.

Printed in the Netherlands.\n\n3058 Report Number 10-18 (1)\n\nSoviet Union.3 It establishes a maritime boundary in the southeastern Baltic Sea\n\nwhere none had existed before and therefore very much resembles on this point\n\nthe agreement concluded between Estonia and Latvia (Estonia-Latvia (1996), No.\n\n10-15, Part I). Together with the 1996 Estonia-Finland Agreement (No. 10-16) and\n\nthe 1997 Estonia-Latvia-Sweden Agreement (No. 10-17), these four agreements\n\njust referred to introduce a new, fourth chronological group in the over-all Baltic\n\nSea delimitation effort,4 which is in substance clearly distinguishable from the\n\nprevious ones.5\n\nThe agreement establishes a single maritime boundary, dividing the EEZ and\n\nthe continental shelf. The boundary extends over a distance of about 62.5 nautical\n\nmiles (n.m.) and consists of two segments involving three turning points. The\n\nwestern terminal point remains undetermined, awaiting trilateral negotiations.\n\nThe geographical configuration of the coasts in the boundary area is complicated\n\nby the small Kursiu promontory6 that screens the mainland coast of the two parties\n\nand encloses the Kursiu lagoon.7 The lagoon has only one natural outlet to the sea\n\nat the north in front of the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda. Otherwise, the coasts are\n\nconcave.\n\nTreaty between the Republic of Lithuania and the Russian Federation on the Delimitation of the\n\nExclusive Economic Zone and the Continental Shelf in the Baltic Sea, 24 October 1997, STATE NEWS,\n\nNo. 100-2892 (1999); Franckx, supra note 1.

The choice of Lithuania is\n\nespecially noteworthyl0 since this country was selected by the former Union of\n\nSoviet Socialist Republic in January 1991 to serve as an example to undercut\n\nseparatist tendencies by others through an attack on the Vilnius television station.11\n\nBy signing an agreement on the bases of their interstate relations in 1991, a\n\nfew months after this incident, the parties established that they would respect the\n\ninviolability of the new state and its boundaries.12 It is therefore not surprising\n\nthat the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation in its decree on the ratification\n\nof this agreements instructed the Russian government to give first and foremost\n\nattention, inter alia, the concrete questions of the delimitation and demarcation of\n\nthe interstate boundaries and their regime.13 Even though little guidance can be\n\nderived from the 1991 agreement, its provisions, nevertheless, were explicitly taken\n\nas point of departure for the present delimitation treaty. 14\n\nNegotiations started in July 1993 and met with success on 24 October 1997, at the occasion of a meeting\n\nof President A. Brazauskas and B. El'tsin in Moscow. For a detailed overview of these protracted\n\nnegotiations, see Erik Franckx & Ann Pauwels, Lithuanian-Russian Boundary Agreement of October\n\n1997: To Be or Not To Be? in LmER AMICORUM GONTHER JAENICKE - ZUM 85. GEBURTSTAG 63,\n\n65-75 (Volkmar Gtstz, Peter Selmer & RUdiger Wolfrum eds., 1998) and further references to be found\n\nthere (see especially note 4).\n\n9 Or as stated by the Russian newspaper 1ZVEsTnA, 24 October 1997, at 3, col. 2: Both sides settled\n\nthe land border rather quickly, but got stuck on the water boundaries.\n\n10 As stressed by id., at 3, col. 1. No bilateral agreements of any significance had moreover been concluded\n\nduring the four preceding years between Lithuania and Russia. As remarked in IzVESTI1A, 21 October\n\n1997, at I, col. 1.\n\n11 Leaving 14 people dead and 110 injured. See THE CAMBRIDGE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF RUSSIA AND THE\n\nFORMER SOVIET UNION 139 (Archie Brown, Michael Kaser & Gerald S. Smith eds., 1994).\n\n12 Agreement on the Bases of the Interstate Relations between the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist\n\nRepublic and the Lithuanian Republic, 29 July 1991, art. 1. This agreement entered into force on 4 May\n\n1992.\n\n13 Decree No. 2201-1 of 17 January 1992, On the Ratification of the Agreement on the Bases of the\n\nInterstate Relations between the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Lithuanian\n\nRepublic, sub 3.\n\n14 Lithuania-Russia Treaty, Preamble.\n\n3060 Report Number 10-18 (1)\n\nThe legal status of Klaipeda was of particular political importance. 15 When\n\nit became clear that a high level meeting would take place in Moscow between A.\n\nBrazauskas and B. El'tsin during the month of October 1997, with as main agenda\n\nitem the signing of the border agreement (see infra Economic and Environmental\n\nConsiderations, in fine), the lower house of the Russian Federal Assembly adopted\n\na decree in which a direct appeal was made to the President indicating the danger\n\nof a possible loss of Russian territorial rights to the Klaipeda, or Memel territory,\n\nby entry into force of the agreement.16 The Appeal contained a clear threat to the\n\nPresident. In that case the members of the Duma would certainly take these circumstances\n\ninto consideration if the agreement were to be presented to them for ratification.\n\n17 Since the President did sign the two treaties a month later, that threat became\n\npart of reality and apparently remains an obstacle to Russian ratification, preventing\n\nentry into force,18 even though the Lithuanian Parliament, the Seimas, ratified the\n\nboundary treaties in October 1999.19\n\n15 This is only part of the territorial disputes in this area. These include the Russian claims to the Memel\n\nterritory, and lithuanian claims to Kaliningrad (Ktmigsberg). See Erik Franckx, Baltic Sea Update\n\n(Report Number 10-14), at 2560.\n\n16 Decree on the Appeal of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation \"to the\n\nPresident of the Russian Federation concerning the intended signature of the treaty on the state boundary\n\nbetween the Russian Federation and the Republic of Lithuania,\" CODE OF LAws OF THE RUSSIAN\n\nFEDERATION, 20 October 1997, No. 42, item 4736. The text of the Appeal itself was appended to this\n\ndecree. For an unofficial English translation by the present author of the decree as well as the appended\n\nAppeal, see Franckx & Pauwels, supra note 8, at 92 and 93-95 respectively.\n\n17 The decree was supported by a rare occasion of quasi-unanimity in the State Duma, with 299 deputies,\n\nall blocs voted in favor with the exception of Iabloko. BALTIC NEWS SERVICE, 24 November 1997,\n\navailable at <gopher:lljods.latnet.lv> (15 December 1997).\n\n18 For a more in depth evaluation of this appeal and its influence on the present boundary agreement,\n\nsee Franckx & Pauwels, supra note 8, at 75-85. On 18-21 March 2001, Russian Duma's inter-parliamentary\n\ngroup for contacts with lithuania led by Alexander Chuyev visited lithuania. On that occasion\n\nthe latter stated that he believed a majority of Russian members of parliament favored ratification and\n\nhe expected that the ratification process would move forward after the official visit of the lithuanian\n\npresident to Moscow later that month.

At that occasion ajoint statement by both presidents was issued\n\non 30 March 2001, which contained the following passage: \"The Parties note the great significance\n\nof the Treaty between the Republic of Lithuania and the Russian Federation Concerning the State Border\n\nbetween lithuania and Russia and the Treaty Concerning Delimitation of the Exclusive Economic\n\nZone and the Continental Shelf in the Baltic Sea, which were"
