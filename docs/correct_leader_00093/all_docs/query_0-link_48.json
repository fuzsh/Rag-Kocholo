        "text": "On 7-8 February the European Seniors’ Union (ESU) held its Presidium meeting and General Assembly in Brussels. The delegates enjoyed the speeches of MEP Heinz Becker on social policy and of the Belgian Minister of State Mark Eyskens presenting his quirky reflections on today’s ever changing world.\n\nIn the evening of 8 February delegates enjoyed the Dinner Debate organized by the European Office of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAS) and the ESU. Mr. José Maria Gil-Robles, former President of the European Parliament brought a convincing speech in favor of the Social Market Economy and outlined the current problems in a broad historical context. “Also today we will overcome the difficulties and together in the EPP we play a decisive role in Europe”, said MEP Antonio Lopez, general secretary of the EPP."
