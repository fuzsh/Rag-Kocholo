        "text": "Hi,\n\nFirstly, go to:\n\nhttp://www.rtlinfo.be/info/belgique/elections2010/716123/elections-tous-les-discours-des-presidents-de-parti-%28video%29#vids\n\nNow, look about the first video, the first picture. This is NVA and yes, we are in belgium. Search for the belgium flag on the internet and try to find it, you won’t. Are we really in belgium?\n\nLet’s clear the situation, which is not seen correctly around the world. What do you think about those stuff that they want:\n\n– French speaking cannot vote anymore for french parties or french politics in brussel\n\n– Brussel becomes totally flemish (there’s 80% of french people living there)\n\n– French people cannot speak or live in the flemish part of the belgium if they don’t speak fluently dutch (and actually it’s already the case for some part)\n\n– French people pay taxes to pay their unemployment, plus the pension of the flemish (but not the same for flemish)\n\n– You cannot speak french in the flemish in this part of the country (this is already the case in some part)\n\nNow, I encourage you to read history about those two facts in belgium:\n\n– Leuven (wallen buiten)\n\n(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLjgB8he8ac)\n\n(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92hChBJ-bw4)\n\n– Voeren\n\n–> Watch stuff about that and how they really kicked french people, I mean with violence.\n\n–> Look about their opinion about strangers (blacks, arabs, etc.).\n\nI am sure you will get it: yes, it is something that has to be stopped and yes they have extremist ideas! This is not because you say “i love europe” that you really consider it! Would you really politically incorrect if you want to get something that is not? No, you would say: “This is to make something better for both french and dutch… and for Europe”. If you don’t believe me, watch a speaking of some big dictator just before they took the power: it was always about making a better country with smaller taxes, more work and … there’s always some bad people responsible for everything.\n\nActually, the real question is: “how french people in this country are living this fucking mess???? –> do they really feel better?”. For this, I am not sure, really. And moreover, I can afford that belgian french people are afraid about going in the north of their country, because they can get troubles.\n\nDo you really think a french speaking and dutch speaking is equal in this country? Actually not. Most of jobs with a high influence are already reserved for flemish and even if you have a better score at an exam, be sure you won’t be selected… because you NEVER speak enough dutch. And they’re always clear, it’s only because of that. Moreover, you won’t get the same salary for the same job and never get the same opportunities.\n\nActually, my own opinion is that dividing a country by saying “some are taking too much benefits from us” is never something good. The only thing that could be nice for this country is only ONE government and the right to vote for who you want: dutch or french. I mean a REAL country with people working together and not a pseudo politic country with economic competition, racism and discrimination. Do you really need to speak dutch or french to communicate when both know english? Actually, no : it’s just a question of respect.\n\nNow, please consider this:\n\n– How can you say on one hand “I think about Europe” and on the other hand “I want to build a new country of 100km out of one which is 300km” ?\n\n– Can you say “we’re a unity” and “let’s seperate” in the same time?\n\n– Can you say “we want something better for both” when 45% of the population doesn’t agree and really feel bad about that?\n\nI really hope some people in this world will get that this is one of the first big problems in the Europe: there’s no unity, just a politic one… and even you don’t vote for them to lead the Europe!!!!!\n\nBart de Wever (leader of the N-VA) is sometimes compared to Berlusconi, which makes him perhaps a bit different to Plaid and the SNP. He has come from virtually nothing to a position of strength by a campaign that involved him in a Flemish game show. I am not at all sure that such a political formation fits the classic civic nationalist mould – it seems more like a populist party.\n\nOn La PremiÃ¨re (the main Francophone information radio) this morning there was extensive discussion of the N-VA’s economic policies. These include cutting the civil servive (making it ‘more efficient’) and ending the practice of giving gradual wage rises based on the length of time you stay in the job (that is the system we have in England for soem employment, such as in local government). Without going further into the detail the N-VA backs a ‘market state’ not a social one.\n\nThis, as a spokesperson for the Parti Socialiste pointed out, would/will make it hard to negotiate a coalition with them.\n\nGoing futher into the nationalist issue Gibi may be exaggerating but not completely. There are well-known cases in communes around Brussels where Francophone electoral lists are effectively excluded. There are countless examples of petty muncipal acts going back some time – such as bus timetables only available in Flemish. As a French-speaker I first discovered how this clash is not abstract but real about twenty years ago when visiting Bruge – and not realising it was Flemish speaking. There is a great deal of resentment – not actual hatred – flying around. One factor not mentioned so far here is that people from a North African background are usually francophone – a factor spreading French around Brussels which is not met with delight by some Flemish nationalists.\n\nOne could say the same from the Flemish side. The usual tale goes back to the 19th century and the Walloon bourgeoisie, and a fair number of stories about Francophone officers in the 1st World War issuing unintelligible commands to their Dutch speaking troops. The truth us that the French (or Wallons) did have cultural political and economic hegemony, and plenty of unfeeling sense of superiority with that.\n\nIt is unfortunate but Dutch and French are pretty far away from another – unlike, say, Catalan and Castillion. This makes co-existence harder as well. On France-Info yesterday I heard the absurd case of a Flemish interviewee using English to communicate to the French reporter.\n\nModern English vocabulary and syntax are closer to French than to Dutch.\n\nThe Flemish can be intensely irritating to English people in that they assume that we are automatically ‘more like’ them, and somehow ‘on their side’.\n\nI can assure you that this is not my case.\n\n@Gibi 06.14.10 at 7:08 pm\n\nI am awfully sorry, but as a Flemish socialist (so someone who is the furthest from the more separatist factions in Flanders) I must intervene here. You epitomize the kind of French speaking inhabitant of Belgium that ticks of Flemish voters and causes them to vote NV-A, using arguments that you got from god knows where. Let’s go over what you claim are “stuff that they [Flemish] want”:\n\nQuote 1: “French speaking cannot vote anymore for french parties or french politics in brussel”. This is wrong. Inhabitants of Brussels will still be able to vote for French parties. You are confusing it with their demand that the inhabitants of *neighbouring* communities Halle and Vilvoorde would only be allowed to vote on Flemish parties. (Personally, I find people should be allowed to vote for whatever party they feel like al over Belgium, but that’s my opinion. My point is that you are distorting the demands of the Flemish nationalists).\n\nQuote 2: “Brussel becomes totally flemish (thereâ€™s 80% of french people living there)”. Wrong. Noone, not even the extreme right-wing Vlaams Belang, claims to want to “make” Brussels totally Flemish. Noone has a solution for Brussels, true, seeing that indeed +80% speaks French, but what you claim to be their solution of Brussels I have never seen anyone claim.\n\nQuote 3: “French people cannot speak or live in the flemish part of the belgium if they donâ€™t speak fluently dutch (and actually itâ€™s already the case for some part)”. Fantasy. As a rule, if French people speak French in Flanders they are responded to in French. Worse is, I *know* you know this. True, there are some individuals who will refuse to respond to you, but they can not be generalized to the Flemish as a whole. Second, French speaking people can live in Flanders if they don’t speak a word of Dutch. How do I know this: Thousands upon thousands do! True, they will receive their official communication (from for example their city council) in Dutch, just as Flemish friends of mine who bought a house in Wallonia receive their official letters in French. What you are –knowingly– smuggling into the discussion is the fact that ‘social housing’ (paid for with tax money for low income families) give priority to Dutch speaking people “with a historical connection to the city” over other people, and this only in a few frontier villages next to the Walloon border. The European Union looked into it, and they agreed, because *Dutch* speaking people who wanted to buy a ‘social house’ in these specific cities were *also* turned down for these houses because they have no “historical link with that city” (meaning: none of their parents grew up there). (Personally, I find that all Belgians should be able to apply for these houses anywhere in Belgium, but your description of this measure is a distortion.)\n\nQuote 4: “French people pay taxes to pay their unemployment, plus the pension of the flemish (but not the same for flemish)”. Are you claiming the French people’s taxes pay for their own unemployment benefits, AND for all the pensions of the Flemish? I am all for solidarity between the French and Dutch speaking part of the country, but if you start making vague claims like these (implying the broad assertion that the Walloons are paying for all the Flemish pensions, while in reality there are–indeed– slightly more people on pension in Flanders than in Wallonie) you lose all credit.\n\nQuote 5: “You cannot speak french in the flemish in this part of the country (this is already the case in some part)”. Sure you can. And you do. And you are and will be allowed to, just as you are and will be allowed to speak English, or whatever. Most people will help you in French (or English etc…) if you should ask a question to Flemish people in Flanders. You are not and will not be able to receive *official* communication in the language of your choosing, but only in the official language of the region you live in. I apologize if you should have had a negative experience with Flemish individuals who didn’t want to talk to you, but you know all too well that your claim is a lie. (Personally, I am from the very unpopular opinion that citizens should be able to receive official letters in any of the mainstream languages of Europe, unregarding of where they live in the EU, but again this is my personal opinion.)\n\n@Mark\n\nQuote 1: I am sorry, but those “communes” are full of french living there, so you agree with me; even if you don’t know.\n\nQuote 2: NVA speaks about making brusell a city (it is a independant region with its own politics now), so it would be in flanders – automatically and we won’t discuss it because it’s territory based ; flemish know it better than noone. I am sorry if you don’t assume it, but it’s true.\n\nQuote 3: Yes, it was about social houses; but anyway it was with belgian people. Moreover, you’re wrong about french people:\n\n– Voeren (read history please) is full of flemish\n\n– All the east of the belgium has a lot of flemish and noone is asking them anything to have a social house or a house ; assume it please: they don’t have to speak french and they’ll get it as quick as a french speaking. I am convinced this is normal and I hope it will continue because it makes everyone happier.\n\nQuote 4: It’s not about paying everything, of course. It’s only about each region paying taxes for themselves, but not for pension that should stay national because flanders will get trouble with it (this not implies that wallonia will pay everything, I am sure you got it the first time).\n\nMy own opinion: EVERY country in this world have richer region or older population, etc… and it changes ; this is history and economy (I am sorry for you if you don’t believe it, but flanders will be someday poorer than wallonia and then it will be the opposite ; on the other hand, young from wallonia will become old) …. and yes, when you pay taxes you prefer to give it to your familly. Anyway, you HAVE to pay for EVERYONE in your country ; this is what a country is. So, just try to live with people and to show them the example ; that’s the best thing to do because, believe me: “every one wants to be usefull and to have a nice look in the mirror”.\n\n@Andrew Coates\n\nThanks for your constructive opinion. I would like to add something: in the 19th (not the 20th), the language of the wallonia was… wallon, not french and it’s not same, so actually french and flemish was equal at this point. If you don’t believe me, just talk with a 80 years old person in wallonia (not with the “bourgeoisie”), you will see they speak a lot wallon, even if they speak also french; but anyway, we’re talking about their parents and their grand parents.\n\n——————————————————————————————————\n\nNow, I guess some precisions must be made about what I said:\n\nI would like to say I was not speaking about all flemish: I was speaking about what NVA wants and the extreme right does too. I don’t want to make any amalgam/asumptions, or to say that flemish are bad people: THIS IS NOT TRUE AND I HOPE NOONE THINKS IT!\n\nThe big problem is that many people speaks about a reality which is real now, but not a part of the future sold by the NVA. When you think about something, you always have to think about the history and then the future. Don’t think that humans change: it’s false. So, every one must be aware about the troubles from the past in order not to reproduce it.\n\nNow, to be clear: I love cultures and I speak with many different people in the world. I am part of the people convinced that only the difference can make you richer ; I am part of the person that think that immigration is something nice for a country. I am sorry if some people don’t believe it, but it will be always better to do something WITH someone than WITHOUT him (I mean creating a conflict and putting him apart).\n\nI would also like to say to flemish ; and please repeat it to all your friends and familly : “french people likes flemish and this is not for their money only. They want to live in peace with them, without discrimination, racism and to build a real country.”\n\nIn addition, I want to say “please, don’t listen to any kind of populism/nationalism/extremism” because those persons will manipulate you; in every cases. Actually, most of people think that when someone is mean, you see it. Actually, no, I am sorry. This person will speak about strong values and making the world a better place:\n\n– Low taxes\n\n– Make work\n\n– Make a good familly\n\n– Like every one\n\n– AND …….. a part the population is stealing you (your culture, your money, your land or both; it doesn’t matter how many criterias you fill, it’s the principle) so that you will stigmatize them.\n\nI encourage people to read studies about violence, manipulation and authority; I think the experience of Milgram is a good starting point. Maybe, you will got that people making bad things try to:\n\n– Help someone (their nation, their home, their familly and their friends)\n\n– Defend values (honour, familly, liberty, etc.)\n\n– Follow the leader\n\nThe big problem is that I think this is happening with NVA… and if I am wrong, it would be great. Anyway, if you would see a parti in wallonia called: “national alliance of wallonia”, what would you think???? That they want to be happy with you and to make your life better? NO!\n\nMaybe there’s a problem between flemish and wallonia, but sorry, I didn’t noticed it when I spoke with both. The only problem is from the politics, not from people, so ignore them. And if you don’t think so, say it clearly, don’t hide.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nJust a few points to clarify a few points seldomly mentioned but relevant to the above discussion:\n\n– The population of Brussels was until the first world war largely Dutch-speaking (up to 70%), that is only a century ago. The group consisted mainly of workers and small craftsmen and merchants, with no democratic representation (voting rights were tied to income and social status until 1918). This socio-linguistic situation changed rapidly because of 1) the desire for social migration into the Frenchspeaking ruling class, 2) the effective (ab)use of the newly founded public education system which was – evidently – French only, and 3) the effective (ab)use of linguistic census which was organised until 1963 (campaigns to make the “right” choice).\n\n– The city of Brussels has been extremely important in the history of “de Zuidelijke Nederlanden” (Southern Low Countries; the major part of present day Belgium and the Northern part of France) politically and culturally, to he extend that the present city authorities are embarrased to do something serious with the incredibly rich city archives, because the historical identity of the city jumps them into the face (this link is also clear for painting, architecture.., but there the plainly linguistic connotation is absent, so that’s OK – we want tourism, don’t we?).\n\n– Of the present population of Brussels, more than 50% does not have French as their mothertongue, but one of the 250 registered languages which are spoken in the capital right now. Often they are poor immegrants, and the reason they seek to identitfy with the French majority has very simple sociological reasons,- in fact exactly the same as those that transformed its original Flemish working class.\n\n– Nobody with a brain in his head (there are some Flemish who do :)) would claim that Brussels is to-day a Flemish city. But is is certainly not a Walloon city either. It is not by some magical trick that it is geographically situated in the Flemish part of the country. And the Flemish are right not to give up their historical links with it. These facts should be reckoned, whatever the institutional solution that will be elaborated in the future, whether this future will be Belgian or not.\n\n– In 1932 the Flemish proposed to introduce bilingualism in the whole country; this was refused by the French. Biligualism had to be restricted to the Flemish part of the country only. This was the reason why the French (!) demanded and obtained the “linguistic frontier” that now divides the country. Personal linguistic rights in the North and territorial linguistic rights in the South have been up to to-day a key part of the Frenchspeaking political agenda. The whole “BHV”-issue (and the breakdown of the last governement) hinges on the fact that constitutional court ruled the remaining legislation based on this discrimination of the Flemish unconstitutional. This did not bother the French political parties at all. The result is what we saw in the recent elections; it is all very very logical, whether one likes it or not.\n\n– The Walloon socialists that won the last elections in the South of the country are much less tied to the interests of the Frenchspeaking bourgeoisie in the capital than the “libÃ©rales” of MR, so it is not only the higher level of political intelligence of the two winning party leaders (De Wever and Di Rupo) that makes one hope and expect that this time a real and good institutional “deal” might be found…"
