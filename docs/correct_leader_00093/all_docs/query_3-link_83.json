        "text": "Breaking down conventional barriers and bringing inclusivity and diversity into the fashion world is what drives Morgane Gielen. The Belgian photographer has combined her love of photography with a passion for calling out unrealistic beauty ideals in the fashion industry.\n\n\"To me as a young woman, it made me think I wasn't good enough. I met so many other minority groups that had it much worse,\" she says. \"I love fashion, but I just wanted to show my own world in fashion, and how it can be different. It can still be very close-minded, so this is my form of activism and rebellion in between the lines of society.\"\n\nAfter picking up a camera aged 14, Morgane began experimenting, photographing herself and her friends, and uploading her images to social media. \"My uncle is a photographer and he gave me a little Canon PowerShot – I can't remember the exact model – and it all grew from there,\" Morgane explains. \"I moved on to photographing amateur models, and when I was 16, I set up a business page on Facebook. I was motivated to continue because of the response I was getting.\"\n\nToday, Morgane is renowned for her work championing diversity across lifestyle and fashion photography. But she had to battle back from a serious illness to get to where she is. \"I got sick in my first year of college with glandular fever. I was almost dead at that point; I was so unwell in hospital. It was years of recovery, but I still took pictures on my own and did a workshop here and there,\" she says.\n\nAfter enrolling on a course organised by the Belgian Government, which supported people wishing to set up their own businesses, Morgane added to her ever-growing skillset. \"They supported me with coaching workshops and bookkeeping – I couldn't start a business without those skills. It's stuff you aren't taught in school.\"\n\nMorgane officially started her photography business in January 2018, specialising in lifestyle and fashion photography, and has since gone on to launch the No Babes Agency, which represents models, make-up artists and stylists who share her vision. And what began as a photography project on Instagram is now the first inclusive model agency in Belgium.\n\n\"No Babes came at a time when I'd been depressed after being sick for years. I thought, I don't want to be alone with this,\" she explains. \"Everyone has a story. I started asking people for their stories, translated them into images and decided to make a photobook out of it. I then started the first inclusive model agency in Belgium, so it's all very interlinked. But it began with me searching for self-acceptance and dealing with my own trauma, and I then met like-minded people.\"\n\nThe success of the No Babes photobook and exhibition continued to grow, and Morgane has seen her photography featured on television. \"I invited some journalists to the No Babes photobook launch and they then followed me photographing 10 stories for the #NoFilter segment in the TV programme Iedereen Beroemd [Everybody's Famous]. I now get invited by organisations to talk about inclusivity in panel discussions or at workshops.\"\n\nMorgane's career highlight? Achieving an ambition she has held since first picking up a camera. \"Ever since I was 14 years old I've wanted to be a Canon Ambassador. I manifested like crazy and now I can call myself one! That's the biggest shock of my bucket list.\"\n\nWhat's been the most memorable project you've worked on so far?\n\n\"My first book, No Babes. There are so many concepts in there. I did a project around gender fluidity in children, as well as quarantine kids, which focused on children who have been quarantined due to serious illness. The kids in general made such an impact. The gender fluid project was shot in a hotel in Ghent and the children just had a cuddly toy to show if they were a boy or a girl. It really stood out to me and I remember every story from that book.\"\n\nHow would you describe your photographic style?\n\n\"I like portraits, especially when people look directly into the lens and make it confrontational – 'Here I am and you're going to accept me just as I am'. In general, I had a dark period but I'm more colourful now – I like the entire picture to make a statement.\"\n\nHow do you process the stories you capture emotionally?\n\n\"In some ways I can take it in and turn it into something positive, even though someone in front of my lens might be dying in a month. I think, 'I'm so happy we can share your story and create awareness,' so I don't really need processing time. For me, I just want to get the work out there.\"\n\nWhat advice do you have for photographers wishing to follow your path?\n\n\"People should realise that it's not all about taking pictures – you need a sense of entrepreneurship, and you need to enjoy it. About 10% of the time I'm taking pictures and 90% I'm doing other stuff to keep my business running – emails, admin, marketing. Also, don't be afraid to immediately show what you're about, even if you're not sure yourself yet.\""
