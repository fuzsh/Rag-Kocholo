        "text": "Author: Catalin Rolea 1 In 1991, Belgium’s then-Foreign Minister, Mark Eyskens, said that ‘Europe is an economic giant, a political dwarf, and a military worm.’ Is this statement still valid in 2014? If we succeed, […], Europe’s role in the world […] will be respected and listened to, not only as the economic it already is, but as a political power which will talk on equal terms to the greatest powers on our planet. (Giscard d’Estaing, 2002) Introduction After EU’s failure to properly respond to the Gulf Crisis, Belgium’ s then-Foreign Affairs Minister, Mark Eyskens, harshly criticized the EU’s incapability of going beyond a trade area calling it an economic giant, a political dwarf and a military worm. However, as this essay will argue, since the statement was made in 1991, the EU has gradually developed its economic, political and military capabilities. The European Union has greatly increased its ‘actorness’ capability especially in the latter 2 areas, partially using its economic giant status. The paper will be divided into three sections each looking at the inter-connected dimensions of the EU, drawing on main and sub-strands of realism, liberalism and constructivism in analysing the EU’s role in international relations. As this paper is not concerned with what the EU is but rather its role and scope in the international arena, realism, liberalism and constructivism will be used complementarily to conduct the analysis, which will not go thoroughly into theoretical debates. Instead, a large body of empirical evidence will be drawn while main theoretical approaches will be used to reinforce presented arguments. EU and theoretical approaches While definitions of the European Union can vary depending on the angle and perspective it is approached from, no single theory can fully account or explain for the complexity of the European Union. Former Commission President, Jackques Delors, suggested that the EU represented an UPO, and unidentified political object 1 , while Michael Burgess that while it works in practice it does not in theory. 2 Federal, con-federal, quasi-federal, multi-level governance amongst other have attempted to explain what type of actor the European Union is while realist, liberalist, constructivist etc. have looked at its role and impact in the international arena. Nevertheless, instead of offering a clear picture of the EU, the debates have instead led to further debate. As a result, such approaches should not be used exclusively but rather complementary in understanding the role of the European Union. Therefore, in this analysis, the EU will be analysed as both an actor and a collection of states working along same principles in an attempt to assess its status economically, politically and militarily. While classic realists such as Mearshimer 3 would only see the EU as a counter-balance to the US and focus on its lack of deploying coercive force as an actor, inter-governmentalists would only see cooperation possible when member states’ foreign interests converge. As Moravcsick argues, key decisions will always be taken by the states as foreign security and defence policy cannot be coordinated let alone integrated. 4 Neoliberalism, on the other hand, emphasizing the role trade and economics in deploying soft power and promoting interdependence focuses specifically on EU’s civilian role. 5 Complementarily, constructivism has brought ideas of normative power and on many occasions has argued along similar lines with liberalism. 6 As specified above, this paper is not concerned with refuting or choosing the best theoretical approach but rather, by borrowing from each theory and drawing on a large body of empirical evidence, EU’s scope as an economic, political and military power will be analysed. The Economic Giant The EU remains the world’s biggest trading power as well as its wealthiest marketplace. It accounts for 28% of the world’s GDP, more than the U.S and for bigger shares of trade in merchandise (17% of merchandise shares) and commercial services (25%) than either the US or 1 Delors, J. (1985) ‘Speech by Jacques Delors’ , retrieved from http://www.cvce.eu/content/publication/2001/10/19/423d6913- b4e2-4395-9157-fe70b3ca8521/publishable_en.pdf 2 As quoted in McCormick, J.

The EU is now the source of two thirds of all investment coming from OECD member states and more than three times as much as the US. 9 The EU27 trade deficit for goods and services in 2011 was equivalent to - 0.2% of GDP in 2011, a smaller deficit than the US (-3.7%) or Japan (-0.7%). 10 While the Eurozone crisis has posed a challenge for policies on currency, the EU’s giant status in the economic field remains indisputable. In the Eurozone, the 17 member states act and work collectively and the Euro is the only substantial competitor with the US dollar in terms of credibility and influence. Had it not been for the problems that commenced in 2010, it has been suggested by Chinn and Frankel that it might had eventually become the primary international reserve currency due to the US increase of national debt that questioned its economic leadership. 11 (see appendix 1) The EU has developed an extensive network of both bilateral and multilateral trading networks and treaties based on proximity (Eastern Europe, The Mediterranean), colonial ties (parts of Africa and Asia especially) and of expediency (the US and Japan). As it is a giant trading bloc with an unparalleled power of influence on procedures in international commerce it has the ability to shape and reshape both the flow and the composition of international trade, most evident in the influence it has on the World Trade Organizations. 12 During WTO negotiations, EU negotiates as an actor and is represented by the European commissioner for trade. 13 While the European Union’s political and military capacities have been bitterly and easily criticized along the years, its economic weight has been hardly disputed. Such weight comes from its internal and external capacity, as it works as both an actor in itself but also as a congregation of states. First of all the EU has the necessary resources to respond to internal crises. It has in place financial capacity to help member states ‘bounce back’ during the long aftermath of large-scale disasters. The EU solidarity fund can be mobilized up to a maximum amount of one billion Euro and it can be used for restoration of critical infrastructures such as water, energy, telecommunications, transport, health and education but also for rescue services, preventive infrastructure and immediate protection of cultural heritage and cleaning up of the stricken areas. 14 Secondly, the EU has displayed its economic power in terms of foreign assistance. It has been the most important source of aid to the south by having institutionalized relations with 90 of the world’s poorest countries. According to the OECD website, it is the largest source of official development assistance in the world, jointly accounting for 56% the total of 120 billion dollars given in 2009 by the 24 members of the development assistance committee of the OECD compared to the 22 % from the US and 8% from Japan. 15 It is also the largest second provider of food aid after the US supplying food worth 500 million euro per year. 16 (Appendix 1) In 2011, the EU signed a 5 million Euro contract with IMF to enhance their cooperation in capacity building under the Managing Natural Resources Wealth Tropical Fund Trust, to which, the EU, with a total contribution of 49 million dollars becomes the largest donor amongst Australia, Netherlands, Switzerland, Kuwait and Oman on the Steering Committee of the Trust. 17 In addition, it has committed 20 million dollars to support IMF’s Africa Regional Technical Assistance Centre for Eastern and Southern African and the Indian Ocean region.
