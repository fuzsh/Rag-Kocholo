        "text": "What makes a professor happy? For me, supporting my students' academic journey, witness their growth at university and beyond, and certainly receive positive feedback ðŸ˜Š This letter means a lot. Thank you! \"Dr. Aydiner, Words cannot express how thankful I am of your time and support in this process. I really owe you a debt of gratitude. It truly means so much to me. Not only am I thankful for you drafting this letter for me, but in general, I am also extremely thankful to have had you as a professor at my time here at Embry-Riddle. Coming from a past university where the professors seemingly were not very student-oriented, having a professor like you has meant lots to me. You certainly enhanced my experience as a student by excelling in your role as a professor in ways such as providing meaningful feedback, guidance, and valuable learning experiences that go beyond just a textbook, some articles, or lecture slides. You have gone above and beyond by creating professional and personal relationships with many of us as students, and that absolutely is commendable. Also, alongside those things, you have always been very fair and impartial to your student's views, which has been especially important to me in the midst of taking a class on a rather sensitive, yet necessary topic to discuss such as immigration, as well as discussing national security-related matters that coincide with the current (and rough) political climate in this country. It is also very meaningful to me that you told me that I am one of your top three students ever. I don't think I have had a distinction such as that from any of my teachers or professors in my academic career, so that is a very special designation to me. It provides me with the motivation that I will be able to succeed in any career path of my choosing, with the special focus of the one I am seeking out right now. Also, that brings me to thank you for your pledged support in guiding my career. Aside from this career pathway in which I requested the letter of recommendation for, you also told me in one of our classes together that I am a great writer and to consult with you if I were to ever want to pursue something like that. That yet again exemplifies your tremendous support, and I cannot thank you enough for that. In the event I were to require such support in a security-related field, I would be sure to consult you about it! I want to provide you with this message since I am nearing the completion of my Bachelor's Degree and it seems as if we will have no future courses together, unfortunately. You have been tremendously impactful on my educational career, so it is my duty to recognize you for that. In the meantime, I wish you continued success in your journey as an instructor and chair in the Homeland Security Department at Embry-Riddle, or wherever else you may find yourself in the future. I hope to speak again soon!\""
