But even after, the deepening of European integration, the situation has not changed. In 1991, prominent Belgian politician Mark Eyskens regretted the role of Europe in the Gulf War, stating that Europe is an economic giant, a political dwarf, and a military worm. The statement was meant as an exaggeration, but it fairly accurately describes the long-standing state of the European defense. Similarly, American historian and renowned expert on international relations, Robert Kagan, expressed this difference at the beginning of this century in his book “Americans Are from Mars, Europeans Are from Venus.” Unlike the United States, Europe embarked on a path of massive disarmament and reduction of defense spending after 1989. It had a long-standing tendency to choose a more cautious or even unwilling approach to military solutions, believing that diplomacy or international law are more suitable for asserting influence. This European approach can be partly understood from the experiences of the war horrors that the continent endured during the 20th century in both World Wars. It can also be seen as a way of setting oneself apart from the other side of the Atlantic. https://lnkd.in/eB7bd82W"
