        "meta_description": "How to find a way out of Belgium’s linguistic stalemate? How to guarantee the respect of democratic principles in the use of languages?These two questions, especially crucial to Brussels and its surrounding area, are at the heart of the latest paper that Henry Tulkens, professor emeritus of political economy and public finances at UCL (Université catholique de Louvain), has published in Brussels Studies (“Double vision” collection).According to Prof. Tulkens, prospects to appease linguistic conflicts lie in determining the use of languages at the local level, abandoning the principle of jus soli and embracing the democratic and pragmatic values of bilingualism – rather than unilingualism – in the communes where a sufficient majority so wishes. This will restore a win-win situation – a positive sum game – among the communities where they would no longer be competitors, but partners with an interest in seeing the other language flourish. Brussels is cited as example, where bilingualism and firm guarantees for the Dutch-speaking minority have preserved the importance of this language, where the linguistic debate is less strident than in the city’s outskirts, and where linguistic opening has been an advantage to all, as demonstrated during the recent Citizens Forum of Brussels.As with all topics in the “Double vision” collection, the text published is an invitation for a reflection and dialogue on the many sides of an issue. In this context, we also publish comments by Victor Ginsburgh, professor emeritus of political economy at ULB (Université libre de Bruxelles), in a reply to Henry Tulkens.Prof. Ginsburgh calls on the French-speakers to be realistic and grasp the national scope of the Flemish project. He rejects the idea that part of the population, at a local level, would be able to change the official language applied in the area. Instead he proposes that the minority simply learn the language of the majority, not in view of assimilation but in the interest of developing bilingualism. Lastly, he agrees with the proposal for a win-win situation: each linguistic community has much to gain when the other’s culture thrives, even in “its own territory”. Nonetheless, he feels that bilingualism perhaps must make some headway before such an attitude can truly be envisaged.",

        "text": "Institutional design for the Brussels area and values for the Belgian community (by Henry Tulkens)\n\nUnlocking the majority rule vs. democracy quandary in Belgium’s overlapping constituencies\n\n2Democracy is one of these values. “One person, one vote” is a summative description, however a fuller description is gained from viewing democracy as an institution of collective choice that aims to achieve the best adequacy of social outcomes vis-à-vis the people’s preferences. Condorcet’s paradox and Arrow’s theorem notwithstanding, majority rule remains the most common way of implementing democratic values, and my intention is not to question this. However, majority rule is not without its flaws, mainly because when a majority exists, there is also a minority whose preferences are not retained in the collective decision that a majority vote leads to. Majority rule is thus a quite imperfect way of implementing democracy.\n\n3My point here is that this flaw is exacerbated within a multi-layered governmental structure, such as in a federation, where constituencies overlap each other or, more precisely, where larger constituencies encompass smaller constituencies. The exacerbation I have in mind occurs in the following way: when, in a larger constituency, a minority is at the same time a majority in a smaller sub-constituency, blinkered use of the majority rule within the encompassing constituency, on issues that are of concern to the majority in the smaller, encompassed constituency, appears to seriously go against the democratic principle of adequacy vis-à-vis the people’s preferences. When a majority on one smaller level can only be a minority on another larger level, institutions that impose the will of the larger constituency’s majority upon the smaller constituency’s majority serves to induce an inescapable feeling of dictatorship.\n\n4In fact, there are two conflicting majorities at stake in this case; each being an expression of preferences, but both being flawed. Reference to the B.H.V. imbroglio should be clear here. The way out of this quandary is, I believe, to call upon the subsidiarity principle, which essentially consists of recognising “local” preferences as being primary ones, and establishing constituencies so as to allow expression of these preferences, and to make decisions accordingly.\n\nUnlocking the rigidities of the “unilinguistic” territoriality principle\n\n8But when institutions are established at some point in time (admittedly by democratic use of the majority rule) for the purpose of enforcing the territoriality principle in a unilinguistic way, regardless of the linguistic heterogeneity of the local population, is it not evident that the country is bound at some time to run head-on into the democracy quandary that I have just discussed? Many of our fellow citizens have sincerely considered that fixing a linguistic border for good would be a reasonable solution to our institutional problems. We are today learning that the problem lies in the “for good” terms. This is because life causes people and societies to change over time, and institutions should follow life. I believe that the temporal rigidity of the unilinguistic territoriality principle goes against democratic values.\n\n10Other examples abound: Singapore, with its four official languages of Chinese, Malay, Tamil and English; and, what a surprise, the Brussels Region itself, which is officially bilingual; consider also Luxembourg, where three languages are spoken, and all survive. All of these examples, and many others reveal the multilingual territoriality principle in action! By contrast, wherever droit du sol/grondrecht is invoked – be it for linguistic or other reasons – endless conflicts prevail.\n\nUnlocking the zero-sum game quandary generated by our outdated 1962 linguistic laws\n\n13The zero-sum game component comes from the close connection established between the territory of a constituency and the people of only one of the linguistic communities that live within it. Hence, if a minority emerges (not to mention a majority!) and asks for public support for some legitimate aspects of its social life, granting such support or recognition is perceived as a loss by those who consider themselves to be owners of the ground and who have a (democratically flawed) institution at their disposal that makes them feel entitled to regulate social life entirely according to their own will.\n\n17Finally, this is surely the place to note that the main linguistic problems that plague the political life of our country are NOT within the officially bilingual 19 communes of the Brussels Region. They are concentrated in the Brussels vicinity where locally enforced unilingualism only results from an outside majority imposing its will on the local majorities, thereby inducing conflict. Instead, and as we learn from the experience of the 19 communes, a bilingual status induces peaceful coexistence, opening the door for voluntary cooperation that is based on tolerance and mutual respect rather than on discrimination and exclusion.\n\nSummary and conclusion: abandon the “droit du sol/grondrecht”\n\n18In response to Paul De Grauwe and Philippe Van Parijs who have asked us “to spell out values and objectives which prospective reforms are meant to serve”, I propose that the following hierarchy of values be considered: (1) subsidiarity to resolve the situation when the multi-layer majority rule leads to an impasse; (2) democratic multilingualism instead of defensive unilinguistic protection; (3) cooperative non territory-grabbing institutions instead of conflicting zero-sum game territorial organisation.\n\nA few comments on the text “Institutional design for the Brussels area and values for the Belgian community” (by Victor Ginsburgh)\n\nReimbursements will call for careful calculations.\n\n“Paying back the interpreter’s fees, that’s going a bit too far…”\n\nJean-Claude Van Cauwenberghe, returning from a mission by Walloon MPs to California, RTBF, 16 April 2009\n\n“No nation possesses an ethnic base naturally, but as social formations are nationalized, the populations included within them… are ethnicized… as if they formed a natural community, possessing of itself an identity of origins, culture and interests which transcends individuals and social conditions.”\n\nIf Balibar is right, then the notion of ethnicity does not exist; both jus soli and jus sanguinis are to be rejected, and all nations invent themselves.\n\n21The best example is the United States. Yet, yet… I lived there for a year in 1975. My son, who was six at the time, could not utter a word of English when we arrived. After his first few days at school, he came home and explained that each morning he had to recite the Pledge of Allegiance: “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands: one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.” Now I do not like too much the useless invoking of God, I am anything but nationalist, I am allergic to flags and national anthems, but yet I had no problem accepting that my son recite the Pledge of Allegiance and was delighted that after three months in school he wanted to speak only English. Americans (despite the G.W. interlude) do form a natural community – a bit late, undoubtedly, since African-Americans and Native Americans were long excluded – and in a way my son, like myself, felt this need to be integrated there and share their language and their culture.\n\n22The true question is why does Flanders lack this quality (and I use the term quality – not will – intentionally – for it is definitely a matter of quality and not will) to integrate other social formations and/or why do the French speakers, and undoubtedly even more so those who live in Flanders (often through opportunism), have no desire to integrate there nor speak the language. I am not someone who thinks that integration can be organised by laws, decrees, rules and strolls along the IJzer. Or even less so by evicting those who do not integrate or turning away those deemed unable to. But those who take up residence there must make the effort to integrate and speak the language of the area.\n\n26(a) In the Flemish communes that surround Brussels, the use of languages should be put to a majority vote by the population of each commune.\n\n28(b) Philippe Van Parijs suggests that a community should “grab a territory”, and turn it into a unilingual entity if it holds the majority and than hang on to it “forever”. Henry Tulkens proposes to abandon the principle of unilingual territory when the linguistic majority changes. I propose that those who belong to the linguistic minority learn the language of the majority, even if they do not speak it at home (because quite reasonably they want their children to be bilingual). And matters will be arranged consensually, even if, eventually they become the linguistic majority.\n\n29(c) Marc Eyskens and Henry Tulkens suggest that the nature of the linguistic “game” played by the Flemish in the communes with French-speaking residents, through lack of coordination, leads to a zero-sum quandary. They feel it would benefit both communities if the French-speaking culture were allowed to flourish in the Flemish region, and even supported on the same footing as the Flemish culture. I agree wholeheartedly with this idea, and suggest accepting the principle. The final adoption, however, should be delayed for a few years (or more…) to see if the French-speakers not only agree to proposals (a) and (b), but act on them as well.\n\nResponse to the comments made by Victor Ginsburgh (by Henry Tulkens)\n\n30My colleague Victor Ginsburgh has made some worthy comments. He has added a historical and geographical dimension to my efforts, which broadens the perspective. My personal experience at the KULeuven Faculty of Law attests to the realism of the ideas he brings to mind.\n\n31Nonetheless, I do not share the pessimism he expresses in his fifth paragraph. Surely the situation has changed somewhat. Although the figures he cites reflect a clear difference between Wallonia and Brussels – only 19% of the Walloons know Dutch, while “59% [of Brussels residents] speak Flemish”. This latter figure, reflecting the current situation, is certainly higher than it was in 1960, as I stated in my text. An example of this evolution, which suggests just the opposite of my colleague’s views on young people, is the impressive number of French-speaking students enrolled by their parents in the Flemish schools of Brussels (to the point of filling them up!). Bilingualism in these families, and throughout the city, I feel is a value that is making headway, clearly on the rise.\n\n32Of course, I am referring to bilingualism in Brussels not Belgium overall. But is not Brussels where this is most necessary, and thus in most need of institutional support? For we are speaking here of institutions.\n\n33Unrealistic? Failing to speak of Flemish style jus soli gives the impression that it is accepted. In the face of this gradual shift, my first motivation in this analysis was to highlight what can happen when democracy, non-discrimination and the justice they imply are abandoned. Does “being realistic” justify setting aside these values? In the reflection on new and lasting institutions, this would indeed provide them with a tenuous foundation. Over the years these values have been eclipsed through the unilateral interpretation, based on jus soli, of the 1962 laws. For this reason I feel that returning to values is a realistic way to denounce a false notion that has been overly tolerated.\n\n34Let us return to the three proposals discussed by my commentator:\n\n“In the Flemish communes that surround Brussels, the use of languages should be put to a majority vote by the population of each commune.”\n\n35No, this is not what I propose. More precisely I propose submitting to the majority vote by the population in each commune the alternative for a commune to belong either to a unilingual linguistic region or to a bilingual linguistic region, as these regions are specified in article 4 of the Constitution. Although the linguistic implication is obviously the same, the purpose of the vote is not, for in this case it is an institution that is in question, which considerably expands the purpose of the vote. For the Poles in Chicago, no institutional alternative is proposed. In any case, they do not need one because speaking their language is not subject to ukases, prohibitions and many forms of discriminations experienced by the French-speakers living in the zones surrounding Brussels. The Chicago Pole example is picturesque, but institutionally irrelevant. On the other hand, linguistically speaking, it is consistent with bilingualism, a point on which we obviously concur.\n\n36What Victor Ginsburgh proposes instead of abandoning jus soli is actually inspired by the same idea that motivates me as well: making citizens bilingual regardless the language they speak at home. But if this idea is to take shape in a commune on the outskirts of Brussels, is it not better for it to belong to a bilingual, rather than a unilingual, region? In this realm my distinguished colleague’s own comments provide me with the decisive argument: in a region that is officially bilingual, institutionally speaking there is no longer a majority or a minority. By law, both languages are on strictly equal footing (as is the case in the Brussels Capital Region). This appears to be the ideal framework for the consensual arrangements he would like to see, rather than the present framework which is forced unilingualism.\n\n37As for Mr Ginsburgh’s final comment, I agree, as long as points (a) and (b) are rethought along the lines suggested in this reply."
