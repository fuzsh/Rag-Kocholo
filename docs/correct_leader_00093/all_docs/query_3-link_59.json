The report that gave rise to a draft opinion had been prepared by Rene Le Guen (the general secretary to the CGT staff). The repc~rt was preceded by work - done in the industrial section. The president of that sec- tion, Jacques Ferry, comments here, personally and for VAL- EURS ACTUELLES, on the national debate proposed by the gov- ernment. It appears to be a simple question: how can France's energy needs be met in the ~iext 20 or 30 years; and how can it be done so that at the same time she will ac- quire total energy independence? - But that question brings up two others: what criteria are to be used to determine the needs that will have to be met by 1990 or 2000? How should we define national energy independence? Energy consumption is naturalty a function of the gross domestic product (PIB). But it does not vary in proportion to the PIB. It is the result of the type of growth and specific savings that are realized. In the 1960's, which were years of great expansion and cheap energy, what was called the elastacity coefficient, that is the relationship between the respective growth rates of energy consumption and the PIB, was in the neighhorhood of 1. It has been around 0.8 for several years. How low can it be made to go? ~ The answer depends both on the extent of realizabl~ energy conservation and the ex- pected growth rate of the PIB. In this regard voluntari~m is of course indispen- sable; nevertheless it does not remove all the uncertainties. Does anyone really believe, to take just one example, that the most voluntarist pol- icies, leaving aside their cost, wi~l lead to less than 0.4 in 8 years, as indicated by the electoral program of the PS, the elasticity coefficient? - ~1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007142/09: CIA-RDP82-40854R040400070011-8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY It is aiso necessary to agree on the idea of energy independence. To understand it as a possible way for France to meet all of its energy needs without resorting to importation comes under the heading of utopia. 4t least for a very long tim~. Althougn it has increased slightly since 1973, the part played by national resources in the total consumption of energy comes to barely 30%. With a deadline of a quarter of a century, self-sufficiency for our cour_try is an inaccessible objective, as spectacular as the results to be obtained by exploiting new energy sources may be, including nuclear sources, or by increasing coal production. Tn reality, energy independence means only as strong as possible a diminution, in relative value, of importations, accompanied by greater security of supply, whatever its origin. To put it plainly, this means that priority must be given to oil, which is i.mported in its totality at almost 2 or 3 percent, as much to save foreign currency as to better diversify sources and quality. Currently, the oil we are importing still comes, up to at least 70 percent, from the Middle East, Saudi Arabia alone accouslt- ing for half of our total supply. It is not necessary to emphasize the ~isks of all kinds that accompany such a purchase struczure. Among the primary energy sources that can be substituted for oil, basically for the production of electricity (the most significant share of the final energy delivered for consumption), is nuclear e~srgy, which must be given priority. For all kinds of reasons: the mastery of its technology that we have acquired; the existence of important reserves of natural uranium in the national subsoil, which are maximized by the superregeneration technique; its storage facilities; its utili- zation cost, which is very much lower than the cost of coal and even farther below the cost of oil and even farther than that below the cost of the new types of ener- gy, whose marginal cost is becoming prohibitive. ror all that, the nuclear choice does not rule the others out. In the first place is coal, provided that sufficiently diversified importation channels are maintained _ and that national production is resumed under technically and commercially accep- table conditions. The sun and the biomass, among other things, can also contribute significantly to our energy supply. There as elsewhere the field for discoveries is immense. This is no reason to surrender too quickly to the promises of a scarcely-explored future; one part of public opiniQn, moreover, is deceiving itself, or being misled, when it characterizes the French energy program as \"all nuclear.\" In 8 to 10 years nuclear energy will represe~nt at the maximum 30 percent of our total energy re- sources. It is still necessary that there be no additional delay in starting certain pro- jects. Otherwise, neither energy conservation, which is probably already overesti- mated, nor new energy sources will make up the difference. The difference will be made up by imported oil and coal. Our \"energy independence\" will be diminished ac- - cordingly.

This device was developed by Aerospatiale'~ Aallistic and Space Systems Division from the magnetic-bearing reaction wheels it has developed for stabilization of satellitea (Spot, etc.). It is the world's first such device. The kinetic energy storage unit is installed in an underground tank nearï¿½the telephone exchan~e. It consists mainly of a ateel wheel 40 centimeters in diameter and 50 centimeters in height. The wheel weighs approximately 400 kilograms and _ ror_atea at 12,000 rpm in a frictionle~~ mrr.ner, thanks ta its magnetic-bearing suspension. In addition, the flywheel is housed in r~ small vacuun case. As thus installed, the device can supply 3 KW for 20 minutes. This kinetic energy storag~. device's advantages over chemical batteries are as follows, according to Aerosp~tial~: pollution-free, m~re flexible and quicker recharge, instant determinatiun of ~mount of energy actually stored, relatively compact, no special maintenancc ï¿½required, ~a~d a service Iife of 10 to 20 years. Aerospatiale now intends to expand its line of .such devices with units capable of storing 1 to 2 KW for 10-15 minutes as emer~ency power sources for electronic data processing centers. More powerful storage ue~its of 5 to 10 KW are also under study. These kinetic energy storage devicea are be{ng marketed in France by Thomsan-Auxilex, the supplier of the system'e electronics.

We will hardly weep for it. In 5 months, it had offered us only resignations and retreats, hesitations and widespread ossifica- tion, with, as a final climax, a scandalous budget, completely riddled with accommodations and lack of imaginatian, but also inspired by a tax-minded, sterilizing spirit with a bureaucratic, socialist tint. Implicitly: an end to freedom of enterprise and all social . assistance. - The hostility to the budgetary monster was surprising in its extent, which drove the PSCVP[Social Christian Party] to revise the bad 3oke. To its great surprise, the PS LSocialist Party~ did not succeed in imposing its wishes, and from that time on, it tried to slip away. A debate on the issues, in fact, would have brought to light its deep conservatism, especially with regard to the well known production costs and index reform, as well as its complete and voluntary aliena- tion from the needs ~f the FGTB LGeneral Rederation of Labor of Belgium1, _ Always cold and realistic, Mr Spitaels has wanted to look for a more sensational point of fall: the steel industry in an autonomist and community setting. Following his upward dream, he chose to become the first in the single Walloon. Which Walloon, moreover? The future, in any event, will judge what was essentially a tactical, personal step. TheSe days Mr Spitaels is claiming to have act~d in perfect agreement with his party. Tp be sure, nobody at the Office dared complain either Monday or Tuesday, but how can one explain the curious fluctuations of the Kernkabinet on Thursday, when a solution for the steel industry was accepted by the Socialist vice-premier, Mr Mathot and by the miniater of justice, Philippe Moureaux? 4 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Later, and after having been blasted by the president of the party, they backed out without false pride. After all, it was just a ruestion of habit for them. To Mr Martens IV's anguish, the vice premiers, one of them the same Mr Mathot, had accepted a relative modification in price-indexing. The Spitaelian ax took away all his illusions on this subject. Thus, we repeat, the desire for a split wa~, again this time, Guy ~pitael's prerogative. In truth, the president of the PS seems to have caleulated perfectly the risk of the undertaking. How could he not know that in the case of a split, he would be isolated from the PSC LChristian Social Party/ and the CVP LSo~ial Christian Party~, and also frcm the Flemish socialists? i~o matter, Mr Spitaels has now many other winning cards on his side. Is he not comforted by the support of the Walloon uni~ons who wish to cross swords, a question of stirring up a demoralized rank-and-file? The Walleon Festivals will take a curious turn - And then, he will have the satisfaction of also being supported by self-administrating RW LWalloon Rally/ of Henri Mordant So what: Since Monday, and with the political po~iticking, the Belgians scarcely know what has happened, other than noting that the gap between the two communities is widening more and more, thus - making the task even harder for those who, like those in the PSC or the Flemish socialists, are still trying to put up some ridiculous - footbridge. Having said this, the major turn taken by Mr Spitaels could perhaps have the advantage of clarifying things definitiv~ly. A last question, finally: what will happen tomorrow? What formula can we think of in order to save the little we still have left? A non-traditional government such as Henri Simonet wish?d for in POURQUOI PAS? of 10 September? It is too early, and everyone does not yet see clearly the extent of the wreck. Elections, then? To be realistic, this solution would be no less dangerous. Public opinion, in fact, is fed up to the teeth with politicians' politics, their schemes, ~nd their settlements of account~ The anonymity of the polling booth could permit it to avenge itself cruelly on the puppets of the Rue de la Loi by favoring to the hilt the makeshift . and chance parties. After all, would that not be justice? How can one accept without _ revolt t.hese \"partycratic\" jokes, these demagogic defiances of which all are capable and which have left this poor country in a complete structur.al, economic, and social crisis, without even a coherent plan f4r the 1982 budget?

For these men, no lesson is ever profitable. Nevertheless, it would be in their interest to read the following pages, w~ere Paul Colson describes the financial mechanism of the steel crisis. For his past, Jacques Schepmans is concerned with _ another mechanism. The one that is stirring up Guy Spitaels '~For 15 years I visited Ar Jek~ll. Today at noon I met Mr Hyde.\" This is how an impudent socialist, one quite close to Mr Spitaels, however, summarized the Sunday debate between the president of the F~S and Leo Tindemans. And, in fact, tense, fascinated by himself, dry as a stick, Mr S~itaels presented the extraordinary picture of a cold demagogue. To be sure, he was not wrong in letting the CVP know that the time for compromise had long since passed, but behind his ~avonarde and destroying angel act, it was easy to perceive other intentions. Having arrived at a summit meeting of his \"marketing\" personnel, Mr Spitaels was already preparing for a new leve~ in his frictional ascent. This confrontation was a most haunting experience. On the right, a Tindemans still not calmed down from his million European votes, opposite a Spitaels, fascinated by the results of the \"Political ' Barometer\"* and persuaded that, this time, he could take the liberty ' of doing anything. ï¿½ A marvelous performance of a\"political show\" with these two men who _ have or had evil advisers who led them into these demagogic excesses , to which their basic personalities already made them so vulnerable. On this Sunday, Mr Spitaels did not do things in a small way. Full of the Apocalypse and hellfire, alternating with threats and sub- ' nationalistic chauvinism, he was exemplary. He left nothing to chance. Not even blackmail. The community aggressiveness was there, for the use of the voter, but also to impress the Palais, where he has tried for so long to be thought of as the highest recourse. This was very clever insofar as Lasken, by definition, is somewhat traumatized by this kind of outlook. Finally: Mr Spitaels took refuge in the old and always effective trick, street blackmail. This style of threat has always been part of the socialist weaponry. ï¿½ In 1950, in 1960, 121 short, each time that the socialists were dismissed to obscurity, they caused strikes and demonstrations with *See POURQUOI PAS? of 17 September, where our Barometer designated Mr Spitaels as ~lister Wa~lonia. 6 Fl1R (1F~'T~'T~T iTCF (1NT V APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00854R004400070011-8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY the temperament of a band of rioters who; having been assembled from nothing, are even more formidable. Today, with the gravity of a licentious sexton, Mr Spitaels is doing the same thing. By pretending, of course, to ~3eplore it, and by giving numerous warnings, he is succeeding in raising those specters which will cause the socialists to be persua~ed to impose their law: a community escalade descending immediately upon the followers of separatism, and, as a bonus, the violence of social disturbances. At least we are warned: Let's be accurate. If, behind all this, this socialist condottiere Lcaptain of a band of adventurer~ had no underhand~d, ulterior motives, we would be quite satisfied to see the CVP, and particularly Leo Tindemans, made fun of in this way. It is true that today's Flanders is domineering, sure of itself, brutal, and arrogant. It is true that for a long time the political, as well as the financial, power has wanted to impose on Wallonia an unbearable economic dependence. But is the extreme radicalism of Mr Spitaels the solution? And how can we not doubt his disinterestedness? Everything, in fact, proves to us that the president of the PS wants to stir up, then exploit, the steel crisis, in order to strengthen both his own and his party's identification, which, moreover, have become confused in h~s eyes. Let us analyze the tactics of this senator-mayor of Ath: Mr Spitaels is now raging about the lack of respect for the promises _ made regarding agplying the Financial Plan for the steel industry. Correct: But why does he maintain a similar silence as soon as it comes to applying the Social Plan? Among the conditions for rectifying the steel industry, there were, in fact, provisions for a release for 5,000 jobs and a decrease in the total wages of 10 percent. Between 1 January and 1 June 1981, personnel increased in Lieges by - 73, and decreased only by 354 in Charleroi. As for the total wage figure, it has not decreased but increased by 9 percent. Thus, we bet that Mr Spitaels, while staying firm on his positions and holding a sacred cow in addition, ought not to be unhappy to lay today's failure at the door of the Flemish, the ~SC, the bankers It will permit him to gloss over the troubling Social Plan and above all not to have to confront Jean Gayetot or the happy Gillon, the bridges of Walloon trade unionism over this slippery ground. From this point on, the purety of socialist intentions, and also their desire to succeed, leave us somewhat skeptical. Other examples? 7 , APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407/02109: CIA-RDP82-00854R000400070011-8 FOR OFFICIAL U~SE ONLY Whereas it had been agreed that the proceedings of the management committee of Cockerill-Sambre would remai~ strictl~ confidential, so - as to separate the purely economic factors from the political concerns, the PS leadership was informed of these proceedings a~d called a secret (sic) meeting on Thuraday, 10 Sept~mber of all the socialist leaders. It was then--and under pressure from the \"boss\" of the Lieges metalworkers, Mr. Gillon, wha kn~ows that if the steel industry slows down, he will lose his power--that the PS made its decision to demand that the produ~tion level be maintained at 8.5 million tons, exactly as--it must be admitted--the gouernment plan specified. From this point on, with ab5olw,te duplicity, the socialists pretended to confuse production capacity and produetion level. To be sure, everyone agreed that, for Cockerill-Sambre, it was necessary to maintain the po~sibiTity of producing 8.5 milZion tons of raw steel, in order to be ab,le to meet all requests, in case of a cyclical revival. Un the other hand, as a purely administrative matter, it was neGessary to organize production in such a way that the industrial entity lost the least amount of money possible, while still taking into account the economic and social concerns. To lose the least amount of money possible? When the socialists hear the words stabilization or reduc- tion of finances, they brirng out their Spitaels. Which did not fail ~ to happen. It was from then on a flight forward. Wanting to leave no stone - unturned, the socialists pulled out all the stops. Attacking . Mr Davignon, who looks at the problem on a European level, tombing the European People's Party for being guilty of wanting to r.ationalize the steel idnustry, calling upon the excited Anne--Marie Lizin to do this, blaming the government for the deciaion of the Swiss banks not to bring in the money to breath a little life into Cockerill-Sambre until the end of October, these men from the Boulevard de 1'Empereur are indulging in a frenzied mixture of conditioning public o~inion. In truth, if it had not been the steel industry, Mr Spitaels would have found something else. Let us simply say that today, these circumstances seemed to him nnore favorable. He is convinced, first of all, that his all-rï¿½ound radicalism and his _ constant ultimatums have a bearing on tn~ Walloon public. Our Political Barometer has no doubt been able to reassure him on this subject. By causing a crisis that could lead to ea.ections, h~ thinks he has - found the best combat ground. Thus he will do everythin~ ~o stir up a community passion among the crowd. By hiding behind the ~teel question, he will avoid taking r~sponsibil- ity in the economic and social areas regard~ng the necessary 8 FOR OFFT~TpT USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00854R000400070011-8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY financial s~abilization, government expenses, or production costs. By making the debate into a passionate issue, he hopes to succeed in erasing all those real problems to which the PS, in the spirit o~ one-upmanship which it has now made its own, cannot give a satisfactory answer. Thus, this identifying image of an uncompromising Walloon nationalist, of a Sainte-Genevieve facing the Flemish barbari~ns, and of an unwavering protector of the trade unions can only, according to him, strengthen his position as head of the PS and later (at least he hopes so) as head of a Walloon state. But wait: Would not an autonomous Wallonia, in the hands of an unshared government, run the risk from then on of becoming totally subject to these favorite fantasies of ttie socialists? When Ni~ Spitaels attacks the bankers, he does indeed take the pre- caution of rejecting the outright nationalization of credit, but . It is now permissible to imagine a Wallonia that would humor the Rosenkavalier undcr the pretext of autonomism. Therefore, Wallonia must seek out a desper- ' ately fragile balance. = If we must wish it to be resolute, strong, aware of itself and its destiny, and resolved not to yield to certain Flemish demands, as a tho~oughly-understood regionalism would require, will it also be able to spurn this intense adventure into which it is in danger of being led by the confused ambition of one mar~ and one dominerring party? Mr Spitaels' spectacular offensive will, in any event, have had the - advantage oï¿½ opening the eyes of some people as to the future of this surprising, Spitaelian regional-socialism. And for that reason, at least, it will not have been useless.

After several hours of discussion and by a vote of 36 in favor and 13 against with one abstention, the communists decided to aak the patriots of the EIA for a stint of negotiations with the firm resolve of helping create a new political group \"out of this party which we seek, one that will be an independent party, of a fully sovereign Basque character, in order to establish the neceasary links with like- minded political .forces in the whole of Spain and Europe.\" This surprising document was sent urgently to the capital of Guipuacoa Province where the EIA's executive met a few hours later. In the face of the communist re- quest, it decided to postpone its Constituent Congress to a new date. In its reply - the executive explained to the Basque communists that it did so in the face of \"the need to bring other forcea into the Constituent Congress of the Basque Left [EE] for the creation of a clase party.that would be broad, of the massea and nondogmatic, that would overcome in theory and practice ~he historic division between Socialists - and communists in the working calss.\" Even though it was executed in ite nea.rly final phase hurriedly, this agreement is nevertheless the result of a long procesa of reflection within which both the ~IA and the PC~-EPK have strived to overcome the historic division between nationalists and communists. Following the elections to the Basque parliament in 1980 where the unquestionable hegemony of the Basque right was brought out and, especially, the large electoral abstention of immigrant woricers--potentially leftist voters--some 10 FOR UFFCC[AL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/49: CIA-RDP82-00850R040400070011-8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONI.Y of these organizations, together with intellectuals and independent professionals brought up the possibility of creating a new dynamic to face this division and fragmentation of the left in the Basque Country. Accordingly, in their respective congresses held last spring, both the PCE-EPK and the EIA alraady suggested the need to strive in this direction, as Mario Onaindia, the head of the EIA, confirmed recently. \"In this pro~ess the hiatoric divisions between nationalists and non-nationalists and between Socialists an~ communists must be overcome to endow this possible unity with a new dimansion that may be transformed into the revised platform of a nondogmatic left.\" On its part, ir. the Basque Communist Party congress, a faction dubbed \"natio~.alist\" and headed by Roberk~o Lerxchundi achieved significant success in receiving a comfort- able majority vis-a-vis the \"working class\" faction represented by thE veteran leader Ramon Ormazabal and the head of the Workers Committees [G~C.00.], 'Comas Tuero~, who follows the line of Santiago Carrillo. It is with the two congresses that the rapprochement was initiated between t~ze :wo parties which considered that the overlapping pointa in their political strategy for the Basque Country were more important than the divergences. This overlap is understood,\" Lerxchundi told CAMBIO 16, \"in the sense that Basaue national fre~~dom itself is linked to the emancipation of the workers.\" Differences With the Adherents of Eurocommunism and the Workers Committees However, in the parallel paths covered by the two political organizations these pFist few months and now with the merger plan, there ia no agreement on everything. Thus, the theme of Eurocomreunism and the labor union problem can become the ma~or issues+ of the forthcoming discussions. For Mario Unaindia, Eurocommunism has failed to the extent that it has strived to - struggle for democratic sc~cialism with a party tied to \"Leninist or Stalinist defects\" even though he recognized later that the Basque Communist Party has recently evolved considerably in this field, moving closer to the EIA's 1ine. Neither does it escape anyone's notice that this process af unity or, fusion can have important consequences in the labor union policy which both parties are promoting now, one of them backing the Workers Committees and the other the STV [Solid~rity of Basque Workers]. Both Onaindia and Lerxchundi avoided at this time coming out clearly on the issue even though the secretary general of the PCE-EPK noted that \"no one will neglect. the securing of instrumentalities which the working class has acquired. In every way, we shall avoid a break in the labor union movement and shall aim at defending those means that would make it possible to secure unity without conï¿½erting symbols into patriotism.\" No matter what the final result, the agreement between the two leftist parties has generated for now an enormous degree of expectation in the Basque political world. - Its impact has become evident,among all the other political groupings which, with interest or concern, are very mindful of the progress in the negotiationa. 11 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400470011-8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY In UCD [Democratic Center Union] circles, both in Madrid and in the Basque County, the fact is viewed with interest and positi~~ely despite ideological differences. For the Basque members of the UCD this convergence.can allow a significant explica~ tion of the Basque political process, a clarification. But above all, it is an important advance in the pacification of the Basque Country. In this respect a UCD parliamentarian from Vizcaya Province, on recalling the words of the minister of interior, Juan Jose Roson, on his recent trip to Bilbao, told this periodical: \"For the minister and for the UCD here, a stabls Basque left is fundamental and the key to peace. Both the truce af the police and militia and the recent and constant charges or denunciations by the Basque Left against violence are a major effort for the narmalization of life in the Basque Country. - This plan for the merger of the PCE-EPK and the EIA nevertheless preoccupied other important sectors of Basque political life, such as the Socialist sector and the nationalist majoritq of the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party]. While the Socialists refused to make declarations and went into a profound silence, thereby demonstrating their surprise and fear before this new leftist pact which can deny them electoral strength, the nationalists of the PNV, also preoccupied, stressed the Marxist - character of the convergence and started to maneuver to prevent a sizable loss of influence in the ELA (STV) [Solidarity of Basque Workers] trade union. I, A place where this process is being followed with genuine interest is among parties of the Basque left such a~ ANV [Basque Nationalist Action], ESEI [Basque Socialist ~ Coordinating Force], and others which, despite their scant electoral success, continue to have influence 3n the cultural and intellectual life of the Basque Country. These are typical parties that could see themselves become integrated in this aggregating process spearheaded for the time being only by the Basque Communist Party and the EIA. ` How~ver, this minieuphoria of some groups of the Basque left is not shared by all the c~mmunists of the Basque Country. The challenge in the party was not long in coming. The minority faction, called \"unionist,\" loyal to the veteran of the apparatus, Ramon Ormazabal, targeted its initial arrows at RobeYto Lerxchundi and t~is allies . While this f action, which en,joys no more than about 30 percent of the votes in the party, does not represQnt the ma~ority, its influence continues to be aignificant among the leftist fringe of the Estuary of Bilbao where Tomas Tueros and his colleagues cont:ol the Workers Committees and where many former activitst have always maintained a critical posture vis-a-vis anything 'that was redolent of the Basque mavement. For Ramon Ormazabal the decision and ti:~ document of his party's central committee represent a flagrant infringe~nent of the a~reements o.f the Fourth Congress and \"a - deceit of the party's grassroots.\" Visibly disple~sed and pained by what he called haste, the old communist leader no:ed that \"in the preceding congress no one was auth~rized to anticipate or promote the separation of the Basque Commui,ist Party from its Spanish counterpart. In this respect the critics in this faction have been nua~erous, strongly represented among the left in Alava Province and in a group from Guipuzcoa Province headed by Ignacio Latierro. ~ 12 FOR OF~ICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 HOR OFFICIAL USF: ONI,Y Disciplinary Measures War was declared between the two factions, and while the pro-Santiago Carrillo faction of the EPK proposes the urgent need for a special congress with the purpose of clarifying the positions in the party and seeing to what extent the steps taken by the central committee for a convergence with the Basque Left or the EIA en~oy support among the grassroots, the individuals connected with Roberto Lerxchundi have announced that they will not tolerate lack of discipline and that they will make the appropriate decisions when they summon the provincial committees. On reasserting its posture, the central committee of the Basque communists plans to move the process forward \"no matter what.\" In this purpose it has been encouraged by the historic Basque leader, Juan de Astigarrabia, who lives in Cuba today. Minister of government of the Basque region in 1936, Astigarrabia was expelled from the communist party at the beginning of the war because of his \"nationalist sympathies\" even though he was subsequently reinstated. Today, according to PCE- EPK sources, he would be prepared to return to the Basque Country and confront his old party adversary, Ramon Ormazabal.

Givcri this internal. situation, and the offensive by the opposition in the first ï¿½ parliamen~ary ~ebates, the hea d of the government has been forced to delay, the press conference that he had p u~licly announced on 31 August for when he returned ' fr.om vacation. Amid the parliamentary debates on such key issues as colza and NATO, and as the kickoff of the electoral campa ign in Galicia approaches, the president is con- ' fronted with two immediate problems which will have a decisive impact not only on his own future, but also on the collective political life of the country. The problems are the government crisis, and the dilemma of whether Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo will receive Eull UCD sup p o'rt when it comes time to take the reins of govern- \" ment and prepare for the upcoming general elections. The members of the cabinet have begun a feverish race to present their respective - r.eports on their activities, which is interpreted as an unequivocal sign of an impendin~ cabinet shake-up. Ministers such as Rodolfo Martin Villa, minister of territorial administration, Educ~i~i~n Minister Juan Antonio Ortega, and Minister of Culture Inigo Cavero (the latter bearing \"Guernica\") have done so in recent days; Minister of Public Works ~nd Urbanism Luis Ortiz will attain his principal objective this 21 September with the signin~ ~f the Eramewor.k agreement on construction. lt was Ortiz himself, in a conv ersation with CAMBIO 16, who interpreted the words of the chief of gover.nment as m eaning a postponement of the shake-up to \"sometime soon.\" 'I'his crisis will undoubtedly be influenced (with the resultant tossing around of names, which has already begun) by the inter.nal conflicts of Lhe UCD, and clearly 14 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/42/09: CIA-RDP82-40854R040400070011-8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY by the resistance and opposition Calvo Sotelo has encountered among Suarez' follow- ers and some men with Social Democratic leanings. ' Tt~e Duke Suarez emerged f.rom the shadows this week to state publicly his position of continui.ty with respect to the tack that triumphed in the centrist congresses, and witf~ respect to [.he pressure for change emanating from the president's office and those surrounding him. This is a struggle for change in the UCD, between the pragmatic elements who set the pace for th~ transition of power, and the id~ological currents that are rising up out of the ashes. Liberals and Christian Democrats support a plan devised by Calvo Sotelo to place the center in a liberal, r.ightist position. This support implies access to some positions of power within the ~arty and the government, and the pragmatic elements - such as former President Adolfo Suarez and other leaders in his area, who hold the principal offices of the party, are reluctant to give up that power. This confrontation, in view of the prospect of a Sociaiist victory predicted by the latest opinion polls, has gone beyond the UCD's sphere of i.nfluence and has sparked a strong reacti~n by an economic power within the business sector. 'fllus, usin~ the platform provided by his r.eelection as president of the employers' association CEOE [expansion unknown], Carlos Ferrer Salat did not hesitate to make a serious and severe warning to the government, its president and his party, assert- ing among other things that if the centrist leader~s do not succeed in overcoming \"the illogical concept of the center as a mixture of disparate and sometimes oppos- ing ideologies, we foresee an inevitable and quick electoral defeat.\" Ferer Solat, who has no doubt that \"many, many Spanish businessmen and their fami- - lies, using their undeniable social influence, brought many of the voters to the polls to hand (the UCD) its victory on two occasions,\" dialectically excoriated the centrist leaders who \"are trying to fill Socialist or Communist positions.\" The attack by the CEOE president on those of the center-left has two targets: Adolfo Suarez and Fr.ancisco Fernar~dez Ordonez, - Thus no one was surprised at Adolfo Suarez' response to Ferrer Salat's idea of a possible Socialist victory and the need for a swing to the right in the government party. The CEOE has the option, according to its top leader, of pursuing a liberal-con- ~ serv~ative political objectiv~. At the same time, Ferrer Salat is trying to uproot the middle-of-the-road Socialists by accusing them of false moderation. Bur_ Ferrer Salat's political rally is just the beginning of a formal offensive for the reorganization of the right by party members and the business sector \"in view of the upcoming aueonomy and legislative elections.\" Hours later, after hearing - this analysis in more measured tones, as befits the atmosphere of the Palace of Moncloa, President Calvo Sotelo received repeated assurances of support from 15 FOR OFF[CIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/49: CIA-RDP82-00850R040400070011-8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Ferrer Salat. At the same time, within the UCD a strategy was devised with two objectives: to fence in Adolfo Suarez and his men, anel to strengthen the positian of the chief executive as the undisputed leader of the center. To bring together liberals, Social Democrats, Martin Villa followers, men who have moved in Social Democratic circles, groups such as the so-called \"young Turks\" and other. independents, and get them to back Calvo Sotelo, is one of the schemes afoot to limit Suarez' influence on the executive committee and the party leadership. It is within this context that one should consider, for example, the meetings held recently between Marcelino Oreja, the government's current delegate to the Basque Country and a prominent member of the Christian Democrat family, and the \"young Turks,\" a group which includes about 30 parliamentarians. This operation involves drawing in relevant independent centrists through the gov- ernment, a change in the distribution of government posts to provide incentives for supporting Calvo Sotelo, and guar.anteeing at least neutrality on the part of Agustin Rodriguez Sahagun and Rafael Calvo, party president and secretary general, respectively. Either they have come under Suarist influence, or they have not had enough authority to ensure rotal party support for the president of the government. Martin Villa, a man who appears to be a key figure in tipping the centrist scales, ' has maintained a subtle position on the inclusion of independents in the govern- ment, as a function of their names; he has a sort of wait-and-see attitude. - The mechanisms being considered by Calvo Sotelo to ~urn the terms of influence toward the groups that support the chief executive, involve achieving a consensus among the centrist \"barons\" or, in a bolder move, holding a special congress. Distinguished members of what was termed the \"critical sector\" at last January's congress in Palma de Mallorca, made up oi Christian Democrats and liberals, are betting on the latter alternative. i Christian Democrats such as Jose Luis Alvarez, Oscar Alzaga, Marcelino Oreja. ' (some of them have expressly confirmed this to CAMBIO 16) do not believe the commit- ~ tees of prominent figures provide a viable solution, and are opting for a special congress to be held before the general elections. Three Keys Nevertheless, during recent weeks the centrist \"barons\" have held intense negotia- tions to achieve some points of agreement among the differ.ent tendencies. They have ~~ot reached a definitive consensus, although in the words of a minister close to Calvo Sotelo, there are promising signs. But the Cinal soluti.on to the crisis in the upper echelons of the government party will not be confirmed objectively until the results are in on the three key tests that Calvo Sotelo will have to take during the next 30 days. After the meeting of the political council of 18 September, the date selected for the o(ficial r.elease of the results of negotiations among the centrist leaders, 16 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY according to party President Agustin Rodriguez Sahagun, the regional elections for the Galician parliament will be at hand, and sooner or la[er (depending on when the NATO debate in Cor.tes ends) there will be a cabinet shake-up. These events will determine the outcome of the centrist crisis, which i~ anxiously awaited by all politicians because of its impact on democratic stability and on all other forces. Even the opposition 1~::~der, Felipe Gonzalez (see interview on page 34), recognizes the political importance of solving the centrist crisis. After the most recent meering of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) federal committee, that party's secretary general reiterated the Soc:.alists' decision not ro force the fall of the government and to maintain the pacts to cover the legislature until the end, in 1983. This promise not ta harass the government until the ultimate consequences (with the exception of the dialectical confrontations from the benches in Parliament) is really a margin of confidence which Calvo Sotelo can rely on to give him an opportunity to turn to his party and repair [he cracks in the system created by attempted coups and terrorist acts. However, in the long range, the Socialist strategy is designed to undermine the government. It is with~n this context that they have harassed sev~en ministers in the colza and NATO debates, while trying to prevent changes in the cabinet.

He did meet with Calvo Sotelo this week in another effort to reconcile their positions. ~ Adolfo Suarez, who will turn 49 this week (on 9-25-81), has political aspirations ! Eor the 1987 elections.

He -i wants to make sure tl-~at the current president does not deviate from the center , left, where the decisive votes will be in the 1983 elections. Suarez, who has ~ gotten progressively further away from Calvo Sotelo, although the two maintain appearances, is certain that the key to the political future lies in his hands. ~ With the control of a large part of the Executive Branch; with the support of Party President Agustin Rodriguez Sahagun a nd Secretary General Rafael Calvo I Ortega (known in political circles as the \"Dynamic Duo\"); with decisive influence I in the majority of local and provincial committees in the party, Adolfo Suarez is j r.onvinced that if the current structure of the party is maintained he will once = agai.n become the key man in Spanish politics in 1983. According to a basic I~ nnaly5is, rhe Spanish Sociali5t Warkers Party (PSOE) will not be able to obtain an I ,~bse~lute m~~jority in the comin~; elections, and will have to govern with a sector of the Democratic CenLer Union (UCD). That sector will be the one headed by ~ Si~arez, wirh 60 or 70 indispensable deputies who are loyal to the duke and not to Calvo Sotelo. Tt~e people of Arlaban, headquarters of the government party in Madrid, where the leaclers of the UCD and what has become known as \"the machine\" can be found, are convinced that the center is populist. And they are convinced that populism is embo died in Adolfo Suarez, now a duke, honorary president of the UCD and, for the past S years, executor of the transition policy i.n the Palace of Moncloa. Populism is not a definite ideol.ogy, but one which stems from the charismatic figure of a leader. 18 FOR OF~'[C[AL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400074411-8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Today, between visits to Latin America and rest periods at his home in Avila, - Suarez is ensconced in his law office on Calle Antonio Maura in Madrid, around the corner from the historic Ritz Hotel and 200 meters from the Congress of Deputies. With bodyguards situated in the cars parked by the kiosk on the street, and two National Police officers g~arding the entrance at the front door, the former presi- dent's office is on the first floor, decorated with modern furniture in light hues and predominantly abstract paintings on the walls. His personality, which embodies centrist populism, places Suarez at the service of a political sector known as the center-left. According to Party President Agustin Rodriguez Sahagun, he is assured of 20 percent of the vote, a figure which could account for 50 deputies, one-third of the number r_he UCD currently has in the lower. house. ~ The offensive by the rightist sectors of recent weeks, however, demanding that the UCD and the gavernment take a step to rhe right to pl.ace the party in' a center-right position and even form an alliance with the \"great right,\" with Manuel Fraga's party, has forced Suarez' men to define their situation at this point in tt~e Spanish political spectrum known as the center-center. It is quite undecipherable now. Center-Center _ Rodriguez Sahagun, at his press conference last week, stated that another result of~ the scores of surveys conducted recently was that 23.5 peresnt of the electorate would vote in favor of the center-center. Suarez and his most loyal followers, such as former Vice-Presider~t Fernando Abril and former Minister Rafael Arias, as well as the party \"machine,\" have a majority on the party's executive bodies (the executive committ~2e and the political council) and thus control them. They defend that leftist area of ~the center which barders on socialism and could at [imes be confused with it. The fact that a recent survey indicated that the highest number of UCD voters were between the lower.-middle and lower classes (see CAMBIO 16 No. 509), below the Socialis~s, explains these intrusions into the left. How~vcr, ir is generally a~;reed that Suarez was responsible for the UCD's victory in the last electi~ns of 1979, thanks to his appearance on television a few hours beforï¿½e the polls opened with a message of terror in view of the threat posed to the country by the possibility of the Socia3ist and Marxist \"reds\" reaching power. So what is populism? How is populism applied in political practice? Can populism represent the Spanish right in democratic institutions? Along with the charismatic figure of Suarez, the self-made man, the brave man with hard lines in his face, we have the voter who is over 30, low-income, Catholic and very Catholic in more than 80 percent of all cases, and the party activist placed in some job or professional post because of his loyalty to the party apparat. There is a whole network of interests that in most cases stem from the administra- tion and the old mac_hine of the movement, from top to bottom. 19 FOR OFF[C[AL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/49: CIA-RDP82-00850R040400070011-8 FOR OF~FICIAL USE ONLY = This political-social spectrum is equivalent to that of the Argentine Justicialist movement led by Juan Domingo Peron until his death; ~r that of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of Mexico. There is no equivalent in Western Europe. The present UCD is not the modern, advanced right of classical lines that exists in Western European countries. ~kctually, it is a far cry from the Labourites and Conservatives of England, or Lhe German Social Democrats, much less the Christian Democrats of the land of beer and sausages. It is even distant from the French farmer who votes for Mitterrand and the Renault executive who goes for Giscard or Chirac. When the issue of the UCD joining an ideological International, whether liberal or Chri_stian uemocrat. has been brought up on a European level, Suarez has rejected the idea, despite internal and external pressures. The current president of the European Commission of the EEC, liberal Gaston Thorn, laments that the then chief of the Spanish Government tried to convince him that the trend in Europe in the coming years would be toward the center. Spanish populism not only lacks a definite ideology, but it also manifests a certain repugnance for all ideologies,.whether because of low levels of education among most people, or due to other factors inherent in the social structure and the environment, as well as the historical context. Thus we have the paradox that the Spanish democratic right, which is included in the two classical ideologies of Christian Democracy and liberalism, supported a party and a leader that are in another orbit; a leader, Suarez, whom they later abandoned and pressured fr.om all sides until he had to step down. Some of the centrist \"barons\" who know Suarez best and who have worked with him in his governments, say that one of his principal qualities is that \"he knows his job like no one else.\" To know one's job means, in Suarez' case9 to k,now the workings of the administra- tion inside and out, to spend more hours than anyone else studying political adversaries, planning strategies, winning people with personal charm, and buying loyalry. Audacity is one of his essential traits, which ~.xplains his surprise move to legalize the Communist Party to set an example during the transition period. His lack of commitment to a set ideology gives him greater room to maneuver with his adversaries, which has sometimes provoked scorn and dis~ain among them; such has been the case with people ranging from Felipe Gonzalez to Oscar Alzaga. _ Knowing his job led him to plan his departure from government while maintaining control of the party, takin~ advantage of one of the maneuvers of his party adver- saries, who were then known as the \"critical sector.\" They advocated the separation of the party presidency from the government presidency, trying to isolate Suarez in Moncloa and control him from t.he party machine. Indeed, that is what Suarez has done ~o Calvo Sotelo in trying to divert him from the center which embodies populism. 20 FOR OFF[C[AL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY f3ut it is obvious that Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo, because of his personality, education, background and ties, is alienated from Suarez-style populism, despite [he union that has kept them working together in the gov~ernment and the party in the past few years. Those who know Calvo Sotelo in real life say that not orily is he alienated from populism, but he feels a basic scorn for it. Calvo Satelo is the person who today embodies the interests of the more or less pr.ogressive right which treads the line between liberal and conservative. I:. is - obliged to be more reformist than progressive in a country like Spain, which remains aloof from the progress of the European powers. On the extremes, liberals and Christian Democrats who support Calvo Sotelo launc.hed a genuine oEfensive against Suarez nearï¿½ly a year ago, when the \"critical sector\" began its operation and managed to defeat Suarez. Suarez and his men, allied sometimes with the Social Democrats, have not given an inch in control of the party, and have not been afraid to tell the Christian Democrats to leave the party if they don't like it. Two Spains In the middle of all this, Calvo Sotelo is faced with the dilemma of having to pre~are and lead a cohesive electoral campaign for 1983, with progressive rightist features (rejectin~ the \"great right\"), and caming to grips with the possibility nf a successful and forceful Socialist Party, as indicated by the polls. A right witi~out Francoist complexes, 4!ith an unequivocally democratic image, economically effective, and socially progr.essive, modern and imaginative. An ideological right, not obscured by Suar.ez' populism. At the same time, however, it is certain that a division of che party would mean the crashing defeat of the right. Reconciling a11 those interests is the challenge that faces Calvo Sotelo in his struggle with Suarez. This confrontation holds the key to the centrist crisis, and sooner or later will force the current president to enter the political arena and put his cards on the tabie. Suarez is an avid player of poker and \"mus\" (Socialist Maria lzquierdo jokingly calls him the \"Mississippi Gambler\"), and those who have sat at the table with him assert that he plays hard and takes high risks. Suarez applies this practice to politics, especially in pursuit operations. This reporter has heard firs[-hand Suarez' ideas about the need to keep the current political spectr.um, with Cwo large national parties and two other extremist minorities, also on a national scale, such as the Popular Alliance and the Communist Party. For Suarez, Co move these pieces toward a more accentuated aip.irtisanism is to create tensions that are hard to contain, anci to return to the _ two Spains. Iiased on this analysis, and with the conviction that r.either Christian Democrats nor liberals have the remotest possihilit~ of winning general elections on their own, Suarez and his men feel they can be inflexible in many situations. 21 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070011-8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407/02109: CIA-RDP82-00854R000400070011-8 N'OR O~FICIAL USE Oh`LY He is also certain that in a minority system such as the present one, in which he could without too much trouble garner that figure which represents over 50 depu- ties, he could control the most valuable votes in Parliament. In de facto terms, and from within, this party can become the linchpin that can tip the scales cine way or another. The PSOE would need his suppQrt for a coalition government, as , would the rightist parties. Hoco will Calvo Sotelo react [o this situation? Will the backing of the Church, capital, the Christian Democrats, the liberals, some converted Social Democrats and the independents won over by the promise of a new plan or the guarantee of power, in addition to the political capital he has built up during his time in office, be sufficient? _ The weakness of Spanish democracy and the threats posed by possible coups and ter- rorism, demand that political leaders have a sense of responsiblity, which trans- lates into avoiding radical stands that could become destabilizing factors. This assumes some unity ~=ithin the UCD, and limits the risks of a falling out. Calvo Sutelo's strategy for making a pact with Suarez involves reversing the present terms of force, based on the support he has, and opening up the UCD to a system of ideological currents (where he has greater support), bringing into the party men of his ilk, from the economy, from the university. ..f who would protect him before, during and after the elections. The middlemen, possibly Rodolfo Martin Villa, Landelino Lavilla or Francisco Fernan- dez Ordonez, can form alliances wiCh Suare2 if they do not receive the trust and compensation they demand from Moncloa. This is particularly true of the present minister of territorial administration, judging by the stance he took when he was excluded from the president's intimate circle during tY,e crisis that led to the resignation cf Fernandez Ordonez. - This is a dramatic duel between two personalities, one of whom (Suarez) recalls that he has won two elections and engineered the transition, and that his party has ridden in his saddle and then named another successor. Thus, Calvo Sotelo must use what he has in the present to play in the future. In view of events such as the colza and NATO debates, the Galician elections of 20 October, and the general. state budgets, Calvo Sotelo will have to prove his abil.ity to place his own men and set forth guidelines in three key tests in the coming months: the election oE the centrist parliamentary spokesman, the cabinet shake-up and the p"
