The move, pending NARM's board approval, was made at NARM's mid-year meeting here last week. It dramatically un- derscores the association's sud- den and full-scale recognition of the burgeoning cartridge in- dustry. The fact that NARM is now out to embrace the tape busi- ness on so grand a scale was re- vealed in the form of a presen- tation made by Jim Tiedjens (Midwestern Tape Distributing, Milwaukee) who called on NARM's members to urge their board to approve the association expansion into tape. Tiedjens, one of NARM's founding fath- ers and the association's first president, outlined the plan with the help of a carefully produced slide-film and taped- sound presentation. Tiedjens was a key record rack jobber as owner of Musical Isle (Milwau- kee), which he sold more than a year ago when he entered the tape business on an exclusive basis.

These units are the first to be marketed by the company and will carry the Decca trade name. According to Leonard W. Schneider, Decca's move was motivated by the tremendous success the company has en- joyed since its entry into the pre-recorded tape cartridge market a while back. The two new Decca units, iConlinued on page 70) Singles Swing Toppling Reign of EP in France By MIKE HENNESSEY PARIS — France, the last stronghold of the extended play record, is capitulating in its long-fought battle to prevent the single from taking a domi- nant spot in the record market. Despite resistance from rec- ord retailers and a move last year to unite Pathe-Marconi, Vogue, Barclay and Philips in a stand against singles, more and more two-track disks are being released here and are compet- ing strongly at 6 francs ($1.30) with the 10 franc (S2) EP. At present, single releases consist largely of foreign prod- uct, although CBS has led the swing to singles in France with its Gemini series. One reason for the spread of singles on the French market is the greater speed with which British and American hits are now making an impact here. With radio disk jockeys compet- ing fiercely to be the first to play the latest Stateside and British hits, record companies are obliged to get these records on the market as rapidly as pos- sible. It is no secret that several enterprising record stores have been meeting the increasing de- mand for singles by buying direct from wholesalers, which are supposedly reserved ... for jukeboxes only. Such disks are normally stamped \"Not for sale (Continued on page 66) Cap Cuts Customer Mono $ 20% in Plan to Spur Sales By ELIOT TIEGEL LOS ANGELES — Capitol Records Distribut- inp Corp. is offering its customers a 20 per cent reduction on its monaural LP stock. The new price policy was announced last week by com- pany salesmen calling on accounts. This, in ef- fect, returns the price of the mono disk at whole- sale, to the level it had been before the industry's mono-stereo price equalization move two months ago. The act by the major is designed to stimulate movement of its mono LP's at a time when some segments of the industry have been tolling the death knoll for single channel recordings. How- ever, in the words of one local dealer, the new price reduction will probably cause more stores to return merchandise — under a new return policy — rather than add mono to their shelves. The new Capitol return program allows a dollar for dollar exchange, so that a dealer may return (Continued on page 10) Bootleg Suit Hits Dealers By PALL ACKERMAN and HANK FOX NEW YORK — The battle against bootlegging is flaring into the open.

Groups-Writers Make Tunes Hard to Get, Col/s Gold Says LOS ANGELES — Dot's new management team of president Arnold D. Burk and Dick Peirce, vice-president and gen- eral manager, have begun eval- uating the label's functions and services. Facing them arc: the re-es- tablishment of an international distribution network; the future of the Dot Record Club; the continuation of company-owned and independent distribution, including outside lines; (he re- tention of such prestige artists as Lawrence Welk and Billy Vaughn, whose contract re- newals have not been com- pleted; infusing a feeling of optimistic excitement among company employees and gear- ing the company to react to a number of singles which show signs of breaking wide open at a time when the top manage- ment switchover from Randy Wood to the new Paramount team is still fresh in everyone's minds. Taking Hard Look \"We are taking a long hard look at the way Dot's doing business,\" Burk said. Burk, who has had no prior record in- dustry experience, admits that Peirce carries the predominant administrative load. \"Dick's strength in the business pre- dominates the situation,\" Burk says. With Paramount three years in various business af- fairs roles, Burk will lean on his contacts with the fi'm com- pany to obtain fresh approaches to problems facing the com- pany. Concerning the Paramount- Gulf & Western structure, Burk says: \"We don't want to be an arm of anything. We want to be pjrt of the industry.\" The president says current Dot employees are being re- tained, although he admits that Chris Kamilton, Randy Wood's long-time associate and execu- tive vice-president, has con- sidered resigning but that they hope she stays with the com- pany. The Burk-Peirce top level team has been bolstered with the addition of a former Litton Industries business tech- nology expert, David C. Watts, as controller-treasurer. Forty- three-year-old Watts, who will initiate modern business tech- niques throughout the com- pany, fills the post previously held by Bob Vartan, who left before the new management team arrived. Ken Revercomb, formerly general manager of Imperial Records, who was let go in a re- cent Liberty personnel switch- over, has been hired for his \"acute knowledge of independ- ent and branch operations\" ac- cording to Peirce. Revercomb, as yet untitled, will trouble- shoot in all areas. To Move Swiftly Burk says the new Dot op- eration will move swiftly within the year. A broader scope of musical activities will be sought, with all independent production and distribtuion deals remaining intact. Dot will shoot for closer liaiion with Paramount for film soundtracks and TV eries mu- sic. Paramount has five series presently on the air, with such TV names as Barbara Eden and Leonard Nimoy (of \"Star Trek\") backing the power of Lwrence Welk. The executives say there is no rclationsh'p between the re- cent consolidation of all Para- mont's music-publishing activ- ities under one corporate roof headed by Bill Stinson and the entry at Dot of the n^w man- agement team. The tightened music concept was in the works over one year, according to Burk. Stinson, as vice-president- general manger of all the pub- lishing companies, co-ordinates the development of music for all Paramount film projects. Internationally, Dot has to re- solve its overseas licensing. It has gone from British Decca to independent pacts with various firms plus representation with Pye for several nations. The Pye pact has not been renewed. Dot's ties with Cosdel in the Far East remain intact. iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiuiiiiiniiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii HOTELMEN TO HOLD PARLEY CHICAGO — The Interna- tional Hotel and Nightclub Association holds its Midwest meeting Monday to Wednesday (11-13) at the Sherman House, with topics ranging from de- veloping greater relations with personal managers, talent agents and musicians unions. David Branower, vice-presi- dent of the association, is arrang- ing talent auditions and a screen- ing program. A successful fea- ture of the group's meetings is the open audition sessions which allow club owners from around the country to observe artists and then select those groups which appeal to them. Accord- ing to president Bob Stane, who runs the Ice House in Pasadena, Calif., the organization seeks to develop discussion groups to help solve mutual problems in the live talent presentation field. Lawrence, Eydie, Hackett to Aid Parkinson Cause NEW YORK — Steve Uw- rence and Eydie Gorme, and comedian Buddy Hackett will perform at the Sept. 24 Amer- ican Parkinson Disease Associa- tion dinner honoring WNEW air personality William B.

David Kapp, president of Kapp Records, is chairman of the dinner, which win be held at the New York Hilton Hotel. LOS ANGELES— The move- ment toward self-contained groups whereby they write their own songs, is aff\"Kting the supply of potent material, be- lieves Jack Gold, Columbia's Coast a&r chief. \"During the past year, I've found that many of my best sources of material can't be counted upon any more because they're keeping songs for their own productions.\" In California six months, Gold has recorded the majority of Columbia's Coast artists once. A former singles special- ist at United Artists, he is in- volved now with album product for such artists as Barbra Streisand Giving here while filming \"Funny Girl\"), Percy Faith, Ray Conniff, Jim Nabors, John Davidson, Patti Page, O. C. Smith, Mel Torme, Eddie Albert and such recent addi- tions to the roster as Debbie Reynolds, Tommy Leonetti and Karen Rondell. Gold is also now screening CLUB REVIEW NEW YORK — Ed Ames packed a lengthy program with variety, taste, a fine voice and charm in his New York club debut at the Persian Room on Wednesday (6). The result was a success on all counts for the RCA Victor artist. Whether overpowering a song or spinning out soft phrases, Ames was at his best. Possibly his most effective number was 'Try to Remember,\" which he sang to piano accompaniment without microphone, llie light- ing and vocal fadeout at the conclusion capped a memorable effort. But he also had the power when called for, and his acting experience helped make \"John Henry\" a standout. In fact, man^ numbers were standouts, but in different ways. \"Cabaret\" was lilting; \"The Impossible Dream\" was straightforward as in the show \"Man of La Man- cha.\" And the Polish-Yiddish folk song \"Belz,\" on which he accompanied himself with a guitar, was tender and idiomatic with a cantoral ending. Strobe lighting at the beginning helped make \"Clang, Clang, Clang Went the Trolley\" vibrant. He introduced Richard Rodg- ers' \"Strangers\" from the forth- songs for Andy Williams, the label's top male vocalist, al- though Nick DeCaro remains the outside producer. Cold is talking ot New York publishers about sendng out teams ot write for him for a number of weeks. He will then schedule re- cording dates and will us^ some of these newly created tunes on the dates. Gold feels their time won't be wasted because he won't let them finish a tune he doesn't Uke. \"More than likely their tunes will be used on several of the dates,\" he says. With Gold in the non-rock field, the label's beat acts are handled by Gary Usher (Byrds, Chad and Jeremy, Peanut But- ter Conspiracy and Hondells); Jerry Fuller (Jack Bediant and the Chessmen, the Rooney Brothers (actor Mickey Roon- eys sons), the Union Cap and Surprise Package, and outside producer Terry Melcher (Paul Revere and the Raiders and the Buckinghams). coming NBC-TV version of \"An- drocles and the Lion\" in which he will appear, an affecting number which Ames told the audience he would record for Victor. Medleys also were good, especially one of modem pop music. His recent big hit \"My Cup Runneth Over\" added to the list of high spots, which in- cluded a plaintive \"Ballad of the Sad Young Men,\" which came before his final number, a powerful, spirited \"They Call the Wind Maria,\" a fine end- ing to a fine evening. FKED KIRBY Arel-ha Franklin 3d Gold Strike NEW YORK— Aretha Frank- lin has received her third con- secutive gold record, for an At- lantic Records single, \"Baby I Love You.\" The one million sell- er followed similar success for \"I Never Love a Man the Way I Love You\" and \"Respect.\" She also received RIAA gold record certification for her At- lantic LP, \"I Never Loved a Man the Way I Loved You.\" JACK JONES, Kapp Records artist, recently visited Montreal to take in Expo 67, visit stores and talk with local disk jockeys.

Mil- lions of dollars are being lost. Reports are that some illegal duplica- tors have been able to turn out product even before the original is on the market. Yet manufacturers, for the most part, have chosen to remain silent. Suits have been filed against bootleggers but generally by the song publishers. Bootlegging harms not only the record manufacturer, it under- mines everyone from manufacturer to the customer. Let's face it — bad product alienates the consumer from (he label and the artist. Suf- ficient laws have been enacted both on the local and national levels. What is needed is a concerted effort on the part of the industry, preferably through the RIAA, to curb bootlegging once and for all. liiiiiiiiiiiiiitiiinniiiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiuiiiniuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim Ames Puts Taste, Top Form Into a Winning Package 6 SEPTEMBER 16, 1967, BILLBOARD Copyiig:' Market Quotatbns As of Noon Thursclay, S«pt«mb*r 7, 1967 HARM Seminars Put On Ways to Improve Spotlight Business NAME Wnk'i Vel.

DETROIT — Handleman Co. sales increased 24.6 per cent for quarter ending July 31, from $10,465,091 to $13,- 038,445.

Paradise Distrib Set by Doraine NEW YORK— Peter Doraine has formed Paradise Distribut- ing Co. to service the New York metropolitan area. The first disk being distributed by the com- pany is \"Casanova\" by Rudy Andrews on Zodiac. Other lines to be carried include J & S, Celtex, Expo, Criss Cross, NIki, Sprout, Gold Tone, and Heart & Soul. Doraine was the founder of Abbey Records and Banner Rec- ords. His associates in the new distributorship are Bob Turn- bull and George Ewing. They are located at 718 10th Avenue. LANCASTER, Pa. — The four-day NARM midyear meet- ing was sprinkled with a smat- tering of seminars, each dealing with business improvement. The meetings were well attended but drew modest reaction. The meetings were held on three of the mornings, with afternoons and evenings left open for lei- sure activities. The first of the seminars dealt with the rack merchan- diser in relation to the nation's total economy. Amos Heilicher, president of J. L. Marsh, Min- neapolis, chaired this panel in which Jim Shipley, of Main Line. Cleveland, and Fred Traub of Disco in Boston, addressed the gathering of some 250 rack merchandisers, distributors and manufacturer executives. \"Go vertical,\" Heilicher stressed as he spoke of the rack merchandiser being squeezed by pressure for survival and profit. \"The manufacturers have an- swered the pressures with di- versification,\" he said, \"and so have the retailers, with mark- ups on other lines of merchan- dise. But the rack merchan- diser — he hasn't answered the pressures.\" Heilicher called for rack merchandisers to introduce new lines of product. \"We must in- troduce more profitable cata- gories of merchandise and fea- ture them,\" he said. \"We must stock low volume merchandise with high mark-ups.\" Answering stockholders' ques- tions, board chairman Paul Handleman said Handleman family had disposed of 300,- 000 shares in August \"because we wanted to get our estates in order.\" Handlemans still hold about 700,000 shares, or 44 per cent of stock, worth more than $20 million at current prices. Record sales, now accounting for about 75 per cent of business, have increased 186 per cent in five years. David Handleman said, \"Record volume is going ahead. Our number of accounts is increasing as well. We are filling in areas we are now in.\" Company now operates in all continental States except Mon- tana. \"We think 8-track will win, but 4-track is doing very well,\" David Handleman said, stressing adoption of 8-track by major aulo companies as an important influence. SG-Col. Music Inks Pomus as Lyricist NEW YORK — Doc Pomus has signed with Screen Gems- Columbia Music as lyricist. Pomus has written for Elvis Presley, Andy Williams, Ray Charles, Fabian and Damila Jo and for such groups as the Bel- monts and the Coasters. Jim Shipley, Main Line, Cleveland, advised a \"system of weight reduction.\" He said: \"We're all a little overweight ... we added overhead, people, Inventory . . . and now every- thing . . . will advise us on re- duction.\" He urged that this be done in a proper manner and that the distributor should ask himself what it costs to turn the key in the door. Shipley urged: \"We must put controls in where we can keep them there . . . and prices must move accord- ingly . . . the services that must be performed must be paid for.\" Shipley told his audience to analyze their goals. He added that the economy is solid; that he preferred the going \"If It Is a Little Rough\"; but that if a shakeout occurred he did not wish to pay for it. He cautioned his listeners not to attempt to build their businesses on a \"home run syndrome.\" Shipley analyzed the relation between volume, profits and rising costs. He spoke of the population explosion's effect on the record industry and of the need to plan ahead in order to survive. He concluded: \"Real- istically . . . know what it costs to turn that key in that door . . . and the chances are it can re- main your key . . . perhaps your gold key in your door.\" Fred Traub, of Disco, Inc., Boston, told the conference of the vastly increased opportuni- ties in the sale of folios and Rosen Sets Up Tape & Film Distributor Arm in Philly PHILADELPHIA — With a pronounced and steady increase in sales interest for tapes, films and players, David Rosen, presi- dent of David Rosen, Inc., dis- tributor of records, music, amusement and vending ma- chines, announced the setting up of a Tape and Film Center. The new department, which will be separate and distinct from the records and machines departments, will handle the distribution of tapes, films and player equipment for the East- ern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey and Delaware areas. It will mark the fourth separate distributing arm of David Rosen, Inc.. which already includes coin-operated machines, the au- dio-visual Cinejukebox machine, phonograph records; with all four departments under the same roof at the building ex- Syd Foley, Veteran Music Man, Is Dead NEW YORK — Syd Foley, veteran music man, died Sept. 7. Funeral services are being held at the Riverside Memorial Chapel on Monday (U). Foley, who was in his 50's, was contact man with Redd Evans' music firm. Before that he was partner in the Smith- Foley publishing firm. He was also a songwriter. His brother, Norman Foley, is with Sam Fox Music. tending from 855 North Broad Street. Lewis Rosen, son of David Rosen, who has been active with the firm for a number of years, has been named vice- president in charge of the Film and Tape Center. Distributor franchises already include the full line of Norelco and Craig tape recorder products. Tape franchises include ABC Para- mount and all its subsidiaries, Warner Brothers - Reprise, and International Tape Car- tridge Corp. In addition, the new depart- ment will handle sales on both store and consumer levels for a vast library of color-sound 16- mm films for coin-operated mov- ie machines, home and school use. The Rosen firm is the exclu- sive United States distributor for coin-operated movie machines, home and school use. The Rosen firm is the exclusive United States distributor for Cinejuke- box, the only audio-visual ma- chine which combines movies and jukebox in a single unit. David Rosen, Inc., is also a pioneer among independent rec- ord distributors and now han- dles over 30 major record la- bels. Tape and film sales, said Lewis Rosen, will be backed by \"aggressive dealer promotion which will be geared to stimu- late maximum store traffic and store sales.\" Jet Set Is Formed Da*e Buys Thing' SANTA BARBARA, Calif.— Jet Set Records and Publishing has been formed here to spe- cialize in rock and rhythms and blues material. Doug McGuire is president. Debut release is \"Exit Sticky Icky\" by the Planned Obsolescence. NEW YORK — Date Rec- ords has purchased the master for \"Ain't No Big Thing,\" by the Electrons. The disk is stepping out in the Pittsburgh area, and Date will release the song nationally this month. musical instruments. He but- tressed this with statistics on the growth of the piano and gui- tar fields. Handling \"Wnng' Traub stated he felt the rec- ord manufacturers were correct in changing the price of mono LP's to the stereo price. What was wrong, he said, \"was the way the distributors, rack job- bers and retailers handled this changeover. Not enough thought went into the reaction of the consumer and how this person (the consumer) should have been slowly educated to this change. We failed to realize that the record customer will accept a change, but only if done in a proper manner. . . . We have found in the area we service that the situation of diminishing LP's has not affected sales, and in fact has increased sales. . . . The reason we enjoyed a favorable transition is that we gave much thought to this change.\" The need for computeriza- tion was stressed by Cecil Steen, president of Record- wagon. \"The company's data processing system is basically concerned with two separate, but related areas,\" Steen said, \"the three warehouses and Recordwagon's 400 accounts, which are serviced with records, tapes, musical instruments and accessories by these three out- lets. \"Steen then displayed and explained the feed cards and red out sheets used by the com- pany in the computer's opera- tion. The process basically used tickets which are returned by the stores as records are sold. - The tickets are accumulated for each store on a weekly basis. D'Lisa Formed; Jordan at Helm ' NEW YORK — David Lucas, composer, has formed D'Lisa Music, a BMI affiliate. Roy Jor- dan, also a composer, will oper- ate the firm. In a move to stimulate young writers, D'Lisa has formed a Concept Development Work- - shop Laboratory in the firm's New York headquarters. This workshop will be headed by Jordan and Lucas, with groups of young writers meeting to create and test and develop new concepts in lyrics and music. D'Lisa has already acquired songs from Lucas and Jordan, as well as from Mike Abene, George Grant and Hank Hoff- man. Farrell Pub Issues Folio by Lardens NEW YORK — PocketfuU of Tunes, Wes Farrell's pub- lishing arm, has released a folio of songs written by Larry and Dennis Larden, two of the lead singers in Every Mothers' Son. One of the songs, \"Brandy,\" has recently been cut by Dave Just- in for Polydor, which Farrell said was part of the big Eng- lish response to the material. Farrell noted that about a dozen English groups had cut songs from Every Mothers' Son's debut album on MGM. The group's single hit \"Come on Down to My Boat,\" co-written by Farrell, has been covered several times. The songbook con- tains 28 pages. SEPTEMBER 16, 1967, BILLBOARD Cap Cuts Customer Mono $$ 20% Philco-Ford's Product Mild • Continued from page I $1,000 worth of mono records in exchange for $3,000 worth of stereo product. Capitol's pre- vious return policy during the period when mono and stereo were equal was a straight mono for mono stereo for stereo situation. It's also under- stood that Capitol will begin releasing its classical product in stereo only. The label is in no way suggesting to its custom- ers that they decrease the mono price. In fact, the company hopes this price edge will allow store owners an added margin of profit on mono material and hopefully will spur the sales of catalog and standard titles in mono. HARM Shifts to High —Cartridge Wing Set Stan Gortikov, president of the firm's distribut- ing corporation, is still enthusiastic for the \"ulti- mate conversion to a one class inventory.\" At Liberty Records, Lee Mendell, corporate sales vice-president, reports rumblings of sup- port for mono from his field staff. \"In our area, as a contemporary sounds of today record com- pany, we have found some resurgence for mono product. Its death is greatly exaggerated.\" Reports from around the country offer varied dealer reactions to the purported de-emphasis for mono recordings. There is a total backing for mono, a compromise attitude, plus a total belief in exclusive stereo representation. • Continued from page 1 Tiedjen's presentation treated the growth of NARM and the share-of-record market its mem- bers enjoyed through the years, and paralleled this with the mushrooming tape market. Ticdjcns said the tape market is far too big today and its po- tential too promising to con- tinue being ignored by the asso- ciation. He said he is no longer interested in the record business excent so far as it is \"The mother indi'stry of the business I am now in.\" He explained that he had a nostalgic regard for the association which he had served as founding presi- dent and, therefore, felt he .sho\"ld urge NARM to make its cartridce move now. The pre- sentation was impressive and convincing and apparently was aimed at creatine a groundswell amone members to favor the move. Several members, speakine from the floor, pointed out that NARM already covers the mer- chandising of recorded music and quest'oned the need for set- ting up a tape wing. Art Tal- madge, Musicor Records presi- dent, cautioned members that the tape business perhaps was overblown with ballyhoo, and indicated that the association should not go overboard for tape at this time. Larrv Finley, International Tape Cartridge Corp. president, answered by pointing out that most cartridge product sold to- day is moved bv non-music out- lets, and that if the record mer- chant wants to hold on to a share of the business, he should wake up to the importance of tape before it's too late. As it now stands, Finley said, auto- motive outlets dominate the carlridcc business. Amos Heilicher, Minneapolis distributor and racker and ' a NARM officer, told the as.sem- bly that his cartridge business was growing at a fast rate, and rack jobbers who are not mov- ing into this field are losing a creditable share of profits. The NARM board is ex- pected to approve the Tape Division proposal. Indications are that the Tape Division's sessions will replace NARM's sagging mid - year meetings which have been drawing half- hearted attendance. The meet- ings have gradually turned into affairs more social than business in content, according to many. The pallid nature of this year's meeting spurred grumbling among many who attended. Target of most complaints was this year's absence of person-to- person sessions between manu- facturers and rack jobbers. It is no secret that the sum- mer sessions have been a prob- lem for Jules Malamud. NARM's executive director, who has been pondering ways and means to attract healthier par- ticipation for these sessions. The proposed Tape Division's sessions can help fill the grow- ing mid-year void. NARM's eagerness at this time to grant equal status to tape cartridges on a par with records was seen by some as a radical turnabout in the asso- ciation's unofficial attitude to- ward the new industry. Some members of the cartridge field had been miffed during recent months by what they detected as an anti-tape posture taken by NARM's executive director and some of its officers. A number of cartridge men are still smarting from the sting of NARM's keynote address during its spring sessions which they felt threw cold water on their hot industry. They believed this talk mirrored NARM's cartridge attitude. In speaking for approval for a NARM Tape Division, several mentioned the mutual gain which could be derived from this move: NARM's members would benefit from exposure and guidance in a fast-growing industry, and NARM itself could bolster its 101 member- ship ranks by an estimated 200 members. Tiedjens' presentation, com- ing as the last order of business during N A R M's Thursday morning tape meeting, sparked what many felt was an other- wise lackluster session. Al- though the speaker panel con- sisted of notable and respected members of the industry, those who attended found that the PHILCO-FORD'S NEW Hip-Pocket disk Is not much larger than the label of a regular 45 rpm single. The company claims it does not scratch. session offered them little that was new. Jack Geldbart (L&F Record Service, Atlanta), who served as panel chairman, reported that tape cartridge sales were growing in his area. In addition to Tiedjens, other speakers in- cluded Stanley Jaffe (Consoli- dated Distributing, Seattle), Merritt Kirk (Calectron, Inc., Daly City, Calif.), and Jim Lev- itus (Car Tapes, Inc., Chicago). Some of the points covered include such oft-repeated issues as marketplace confusion over multiple configuration, need for standardization in packag- ing, and the problems of pilfer- age. Noteworthy comments by panelists included Jaffe's advice to merchandisers to avoid in- ventory confusion by restricting the number of sources of car- tridge supply, Kirk's report that 90 per cent of Calectron's car- tridge sales were to non-music outlets, and Levitus' call for source marking of cartridge product. General consensus of the tape session — which also seemed to reflect NARM's new attitude — is that the tap« cartridge busi- ness represents no mere evolu- tion, but is, in fact, a revolution, and one which NARM must join.

Each recording selected for release in mini-disk consists of a coupling of two top 10 sides by the same artist. Thus an art- ist has to have two sides which reach the top 10 before he can be released in the Philco-Ford series. The company is using Billboard's Hot 100 Chart to qualify artists for releases. Phil- co-Ford leases rights for the masters from labels on a master- by-master basis. The Hip Pocket disk release consists of 14 selections. The firm expects to issue 24 during the first year. Armin E. Allen, vice-president and general man- ager of Philco-Ford's Consumer Electronics Division, said the company would invest $ I million in advertising during the first year to get the system launched. Vincent P. Novak, new prod- ucts planning manager of the Consumer Electronics Division, said Philco-Ford was aiming its new disk concept at the \"8 to 18-year-old market.\" He pre- dicted the playback system will appeal to the same user as the transistor radio. Since 25 mini- disks fit into a pocket, Novak .said, the record will find a new area of use. Wholesalers and manufactur- ers here looked and listened to Philco-Ford's presentation but sparked little enthusiasm for the new concept. Some believed its weakness was the use of record- Bootleg Suit • Continued from page 1 ident. Each action seeks $50,- 000 in compensatory damages and $100,000 in punitive damages.

Novak's answer to thii was that the mini-disk was aimed at the youngster who al- ready owns the regular 45 sin- gle, but wants a mini-disk for portable use. Some wholesalers shrugged off the Hip Pocket disk idea, claiming they do not want to handle another disk form, and that the record business is al- ready burdened with multiple speeds and disk sizes. A number of record manufa> turers here indicated a reluc- tance to share their hit record- ings with another company. Most said it was against poUcy to turn their product over to an outside firm for marketing. Ford's own marketing organiza- tion will handle the disks and phonos, selling direct to rack jobbers and dealers via Philco- Ford's franchised distribution. Several industry leaders here said they saw in Philco-Ford's move an exploratory probe at the record mdustry and if it succeeded, more could be ex- pected. The first wave of product in- cludes such hits as \"Respect\" and \"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\" by Aretha Franklin of Atlantic Records, the Doors of Elektra Records with \"Light My Fire\" and \"Break Through,\" plus art- ists like Neil Diamond, Mitch Ryder, Tommy James and the Shondells. Sam the Sham Re- vue, McCoys, Young Rascals, Buckinghams, Otis Redding, Sonny and Cher. Wilson Pickett, Percy Sledge, Lovin' Spoonful and Arthur Conley. Hits Dealers ging in key markets east of the Mississippi, and millions of dol- lars weekly are being dissipated. Prices for bootleg goods range from 18 to 23 cents, as compared with the normaf- wholesale price of 64 cents. \"As a result of these illegal opera- tions, we were hurt badly on such merchandise as the Hap- penings' disk of 'Mammy' and 'I Got Rhythm.' But other la- bels suffered too — all the hits on both singles and albums are targets.\" Barash said, \"When bootleg- ging is unchecked all legitimate facets of the record and music business are the losers. An in- ferior product is foisted on the consumer; the artists lose in popularity; the labels lose sales and its image deteriorates; the copyright owners lose out in mcchantca] royatlics, and the total industry loss is tre- mendous.\" Pubs Soe Historically, the bnmt of liti- gation against bootlegging has been borne by music publishers, who have sought to protect their copyrights against in- fringements. It has been rela- tively rare for manufacturers to institute suit; and it has been even rarer to aim the litigation at retailers and distributors. In January 1967, the New York Legislature enacted a law mak- ing the dealer responsible for any bootlegging product mov- ing through his hands. The law states that it is a misdemeanor to manufacture or sell any rec- ord or tape with the knowledge that the product is counter- feited. In recent weeks, as reported exclusively in Billboard, ramp- ant bootlegging activities have prompted a number of manu- facturers including Atlantic, B. T. Puppy. Roulette and others to redesign their labels in order to pose tougher obsta- cles for the counterfeiter. Executive Turntable • Continued from page 3 Albuquerque, N. M.

C. PARIS — Despite the general slump in record sales registered by most French companies this year, Philips sales for the first eight months of 1967 are 2 per cent up on the same period last year. This was reported at the annual Philips congress (Aug. 31, Sept. I) which was presided over by S. P. Philips president Georges Meyerstein-Maigret and at- tended by Philips executives from the U. S., U. K., Germany, Holland, Belgium, Canada, Spain, Finland, Morocco, Lebanon, Switzerland and Italy, including Philips International Director General C. Solleveld. Meyerstein-Maigret said that the record industry in France was going through a difficult period and the one French company quoted on the stock exchange (Pathe-Marconi) had sales figures 19.3 per cent down on 1966. \"However,\" said Meyerstein-Maigret, \"thanks to a By MIKE HENNESSEY fantastic August period in which our LP sales were double the figure for August 1966, we are now 2 per cent up on last year.\" Vigorous Growth C. Solleveld, who said he was celebrating his 2Sth year with Philips, told representatives that Philips in France had shown vigorous growth and was often quoted as an example to other Philips companies. The record market was far from lively at the present time and Philips, under Meyerstein-Maigret, had done ex- tremely well, not only in the matter of turnover but also in the matter of creativity. The various Philips department chiefs presented their program of new releases to the congress, aided by film clips, slides and excerpts from selected records, and laid particular emphasis on records for children. Philips now leads the French market in children's records and has sold 10 million in 10 years. Plans for the 1967-1968 season include a special record-color- ing book offer with a. 10-inch LP and a 12-page coloring book featuring the adventures of the popular children's character Colargol the Bear, will sell for 23francs 90 ($4.78) and is aimed primarily at the Christmas market. Said Meyerstein-Maigret: \"There is great potential in the children's market and we must set out to in- terest children in records when they are two years old, not wait until they are five years old.\" New Series In this \"get 'em while they're young\" spirit.

On the creative front locally, KS's major \"push artist\" Tony Bruno has been set for his Las Vegas debut Sept. 20 at the Frontier Hotel with an 18-piece band, for $10,000 per week.

Most of the calls, according to dealers and jobbers, are com- ing from instrumentalists in teen rock groups. They're looking for material to broaden repertoire. Though they learn most of their new material by listening to rec- ords and other groups, much of the old blues material they can- not find on record. Though there are reports that old blues is in short supply on sheet music, jobbers deny this. Jobber executive Dennis DeCor- Al Calola's newest United Artists album, \"King Guitar\" (3586/ 6586), sets the stage for a red- carpet celebration of King Guitar Month. \"King Guitar\" tops the list of 15 superb Caiola albums. This exciting album may be Caiola's best yet. Its range of tunes and moods — from a melodic \"Something Stupid\" to the tender \"Man & a Women\" to the vitality of \"Kansas City\" and \"A Few Dollars More\"creafe an unmatched stage for Caiola's commanding musicianship. It takes an outstanding instrument to keep up with the range and in- tensity of his performance: only an Epiphone Guitar will do.

Calif. 92626 1« dova of Music Dealers Music Service, Inc., New York, said, \"I feel there is enough tradi- tional blues material out. There's an excellent Leadbelly songbook available from Oak and a good Leadbelly method available from the publishing arm of The Richmond Organiza- tion. And there's a Leadbelly 12-string method that may be called a bestseller.\" Jobete DeCordova also said that sheet music for current r&b hits is in good supply. \"Respect,\" he said, is out on sheet music from Hanson Publications, for ex- ample. And he said Big Three handles material from Jobete, the Motown publishing wing. This assures that hot material from Motown and Gordy will be available. Charles Dumont, of the Phil- adelphia jobbing firm, Charles Dumont & Son, suggested that the young musicians looking for blues sheet music \"inflate\" the number of calls for an item be- cause in their determination they go from store to store. \"Blues sheet music is in short supply,\" he said, \"chiefly because we get few calls for it. We do get isolated calls for soul music, but not enough to indicate a grow- ing demand. The big sheet-mu- sic sellers today have an adult buyer at the other end.\" Celeste Jennings sheet music buyer for Lyon & Healy, Chi- cago, reports that the big mu- sic chain is getting more re- quests for current teen and tra- ditional blues material on sheet music. \"And we have a problem,\" she said. 'There are so many subsidiary publishing companies today that it's difficult to track them down. If it weren't for the publisher's list under Billboard's hot 100 I don't know how we would locate this music.\" Miss Jennings keeps an ex- haustive cross-reference file on music publishers and looks con- sistently to Big 3, Sonway Serv- ice and Hanson in New York for her supply. \"We're getting more calls now for the newer blues things, but for a while we were really hav- ing a run on material like 'Soul Time'.\" Despite three-month guaran- tee sale policies from most pub- lishers. Miss Jennings watches the charts closely when order- ing. She only orders in large quantity those that show rapid progress on the chart. 'Those that have been on the chart several weeks don't warrant as much quantity,\" she said. Resourceful producers, such as Dunwich here, have found their own sources of notated blues and other material. \"We've had no trouble getting old blues material,\" said Bill Traut of Dunwich, \"because Ark Music, a subsidiary of Chess Produc- ing Corp., has a series of great books out on the real folk blues material of men like Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. Oak has some excellent material, too. \"But most groups are still getting their ideas from records. The kids are the greatest copiers in the world. They copy records and they copy each other. In the blues field they copy every- thing Paul Butterfield does, which is really copying a copy. For Butterfield copied several old blues bands he heard when he used to hang around on Max- well Street in Chicago.\" W/iot tAakes a Good Guitar? CHICAGO — What do gui- tar lovers look for when buying a new instrument? Every dealer handling this popular instru- ment should know these basics, outlined by the American Mu- sic Conference: The first important must is good fingerboard action — the ease with which the strings can be depressed to the fingerboard. A musician should be able to achieve clear chords without too much effort. Established brand name prod- ucts are an eye catcher of guitar shoppers. A beginner can become thoroughly discouraged if his instrument cannot produce good sound no matter how adept he becomes with the fingering. This may make him give up playing instead of go- ing back a year later for a more expensive instrument Tabia on TV NEW YORK — Well-known sitar and tabIa player Colin Walcott was seen on the East- ern Educational Network's \"Summer Sampler\" TV pro- gram Sept. 3. The program, taped in the Museum of Mod- ern Art here, featured the Tony Scott jazz quartet and folk singers Steve Addis and Bill Crofut. Crofut provided clari- net accompaniment to one of Walcott's sitar solos. Warpage in the neck and fingerboard should be checked on all models. Without excep- tion, no type of guitar can be played if the neck and finger- board are out of line. The qual- ity guitars have a steel rod for neck support. Electrical guitars with steel strings especially need a lot of neck support, whereas some classical and flat top mod- els have nylon strings which cause less tension. Ebony Most good guitars are made of different ratios of maple, spruce and mahogany. The best models feature ebony finger- boards. A guarantee from the manufacturer is about the best testimony a buyer can have concerning the quality of his instrument. Used guitars, especially the more expensive models, are also an excellent market for dealers because there is very little de- preciation in price. A good used guitar has nearly the same value as a comparable new model. If you arc handling used models, here are the pitfalls to look for: warpage in the neck and fingerboard; holes or splits in the body; a loose neck; cracked or loose ribs in the body (these will make chords buzz), good action and musical accuracy. THE EASYBEATS have just signed a product endorsement contract with Beverly Drums. Latest recording for the group is \"Falling Off the Edge of the World\" on United Artists. Harris-Teller Inc. of Chicago is the exclusive distributor for Beverly Drums in United States. $78 Million West German Musical Instrument Export COLOGNE— West Germany has become one of the world's biggest producers and exporters of fme musical instruments. Sales are increasing year by year. For 1966, they totaled $73,500,000, and for 1967 are expected to exceed $78 million. The Federal Guild of German Instrument Makers reported that German musical instru- ments are withstanding compe- tition on tfie world market better than almost any other German specialty product. The dilemma facing the Ger- man industry, however, is whether or not to mechanize. Those opposing mechanization contend that the strong compet- itive position enjoyed by Ger- man musical instruments at present is due to their hand- crafted production. Although mechanization has doubled production since 1959, many instruments are still com- pletely or partly hand-made. There are 300 instrument fac- tories in Germany, but a large part of production comes from some 1,300 small workshops of artisans. Pratige It is these small workshops which give German musical in- struments their great prestige. Almost all hand-made instru- ments in Germany are made on order, and are tailored to the specifications of the musi- cian. The most famous German- made musical instruments are probably Steinway pianos (made in Hamburg) and violins made in Mittenwald and Bubetu-euth- Erlangen. At Lake Constance, the Lothar Gaertner factory makes Lyres straight out of antiquity. The ancient Greek lyre was symmetrical, with seven to nine strings. Gaertner has created new forms for the lyre and given it new range. His lyres are asym- metrical, made of maple and have a two and one-half to three octave range.
