        "text": "Here is my top five albums from the Golden Age of Christmas (1950's to the 1960's and perhaps a little beyond if you so like. I will include an additional top five list as I found it too hard to pick just five from the greatest Christmas album period in the history of popular music. So make it a top five or top ten list as you please. No criteria police hear so wade in as you please. My list will not be in any particular order as I also find that too hard to do, but I will begin with one of my top two or three holiday albums of all time, John Klein's A Christmas Sound Spectacular, that I had a hand in getting remastered and released by Real Gone Music this year on CD for the very first time in its original Living Stereo version. It was my honor to write the liner notes for this historic twofer CD, which also includes John Klein's very splendid second holiday album, All Around The Christmas Tree. So here we go with the first top five from the Golden Age:\n\n1) John Klein's A Christmas Sound Spectacular (Living Stereo version) 1959\n\n2) Johnny Mathis Merry Christmas 1958\n\n3) Percy Faith Music Of Christmas (Stereo version) 1959\n\n4) Percy Faith Hallelujah 1958\n\n5) Nat King Cole The Christmas Song 1963\n\nHere is my additional top five, really making it a top ten countdown:\n\n6) Andy Williams The Andy Williams Christmas Album 1963\n\n7) John Gary The John Gary Christmas Album 1963\n\n8) Jack Jones The Jack Jones Christmas Album 1964\n\n9) Frank DeVol The Old Sweet Songs Of Christmas 1960\n\n10) The Hollyridge Strings Christmas Favorites (Arranged and Conducted by Stu Phillips) 1965\n\nI have over 300 Christmas albums in my collection, so I know I have left off a lot of great ones for sure from the Golden Age of Christmas music, but I am hoping that you great people will fill in the gaps with your great selections.\n\nI love your choices! Especially Percy Faith, Nat King Cole and Andy Williams. Those two artists are also among my annual favorites this time of year.\n\nOkay, I left off a major favorite Christmas album that should have definitely been in my top five list. This is what happens when you start a new thread before you have had enough coffee in the morning.\n\nMantovani's Christmas Carols from 1958 has to be in my top five somewhere. Monty, as his friends and fans called him, was known for his cascading strings and this great holiday album was fantastically engineered when it was recorded back in the day on the London Records label. A rather glaring omission from my top ten list! Real Gone Music did on stupendous release a couple of years ago on CD of this truly iconic Christmas album and I cannot recommend this version enough.\n\nA very great and eclectic list of holiday albums from the Golden Age of Christmas. I think that the June Christy This Time Of The Year album, with the very talented Pete Rugolo doing the great brass and string arrangements, might very well be the greatest Christmas album ever to feature all original material, especially written for this historic album. She had a stupendous voice as well. I wish someone like Real Gone Music would remaster and release on CD that Esquivel album as well as that is definitely a kick in the pants and deserves a new release. So many great choices here on your splendid list. The Ella album is a must have as well.\n\nThank you. I cheated and listed way more than five, but I could have gone on.\n\nWhen we host Christmas parties at our place, we start out with the more traditional Jo Stafford/Jack Jones/Johnny Mathis kind of stuff.\n\nAfter everyone has a good buzz, I put on the Herb Alpert album - LOUD - to signal that the party is in full swing.\n\nThe Moog albums come after that.\n\nIf you don't already have it, treat yourself to the Jo Stafford CD that contains all the tracks from both Ski Trails and Happy Holiday. I posted a clip above.\n\nI would surely love to be at one of those parties as you obviously have superior taste in your Christmas music. I absolutely love Jo Stafford as her pitch perfect voice was made for this type of music. My oldest daughter will not let us open up Christmas presents until Johnny Mathis's Merry Christmas album is playing on the CD player.\n\nI am having a listening party for the John Klein CD release, since I did the liner notes and was somewhat instrumental in getting Real Gone Music to remaster and release it on CD in its original Living Stereo incarnation for the first time. Johnny Mathis, Jack Jones and Percy Faith will all be on standby, after we wear them out with the John Klein CD twofer.\n\nNot to take the thread off-topic, and not exactly Christmas music, but during that time of the year, I love that mid-century production music featuring brisk tempos and pizzicato strings. \"Holiday for Strings\" by David Rose is the most famous example of this kind of thing. It is hard to find full albums like this, but over the years, I have made compilation CDs using individual tracks from various albums.\n\nScamp's first volume of Music for TV Dinners had about 8 or 9 tracks in this mode. The score from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia uses this stuff too. There are also a lot of KPM library albums available from Amazon on mp3 featuring this kind of stuff.\n\nI do an elaborate HO train layout under the tree at the holidays. I go to a big train show every December, and it is a ritual for me to play this kind of stuff in the car on the trip there and back.\n\nThis music has an upbeat, moderne sound, suggesting happy shoppers in the bustling metropolis. Here is an example:\n\nOh I am sure that the overwhelming majority of people on this great forum have no idea who he is, but I have got to tell you that RCA Victor was pumped enough about this release in 1959 that they wrapped a banner around the stereo version with a written \"money-back\" guarantee that said that if you did not believe this was the most splendid sound on record, you could get all your money back. I wrote about this whole \"money-back\" guarantee in the liner notes.\n\nJohn Klein was an absolute musical genius of sorts and could build music instruments and wrote a book on how to play the Carillon. The one he played on this truly stupendous album was the largest one in the world and featured almost 1500 bells ringing in perfect tonal fashion. He also had a fantastic group of New York studio musicians and a full brass and string orchestra, with some Billy May inspired arrangements that featured changing tempos and jazzy big band like brass movements. There was nothing like the sound of this album then or since it came out in 1959."
