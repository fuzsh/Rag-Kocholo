        "text": "Les Aanderud & The Country Rock Shop \"Simple Lovin' Man\" (LEA Productions/Sundance Sounds, 1984) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Les Aanderud & Rick Foltz)\n\nOriginally from Minot, North Dakota, singer-guitarist Leslie Aanderud (d. 2012) and his wife Ethel were living in Southern California when they recorded this album, Mr. Aanderud having moved to Anaheim in the late '70s to work in the defense industry. Like many twangsters, Aanderud started out as a rocker: in his teens, he toured with a Texas-based garage band called the Tracers, which toured regionally and had considerable success in the late 'Sixties, notably with the local popularity of their single \"She Said Yeah.\" By the early 'Seventies, though, Aanderud was ready for some twang, and started a band called The Country Rock Shop after moving back to North Dakota in 1972. This album is mostly full of original material, with the exception of a few cover tunes, including Leroy Van Dyke's \"Auctioneer,\" \"Words\" by the Bee Gees, and Marty Robbins' weeper, \"You Gave Me A Mountain.\" Most of the SoCal sidemen are unfamiliar names, though pedal steel player Blackie Taylor rings a bell... Aanderud's originals include \"I Just Can't Stop Myself,\" \"Simple Lovin' Man,\" \"Lonely Eyes,\" and one called \"Country Boogie.\" As far as I know, this was his only album...\n\nAllen Abajian \"Forever And A Day\" (White Saddle Music, 1985) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Allen Abajian, Jay Lacy, Gary Rowles, Lawrence W. Wendelken)\n\nAn all-original set by the self-proclaimed \"Armenian Cowboy,\" Allen Abajian, of Sherman Oaks, California. All the songs were written or co-written by Abajian, some of 'em with his wife Alice Abajian and a few other collaborators. Originally from Chicago, Abajian played folk music as a kid, moved into country, and also moved out to LA, where he became friends with steel player Red Rhodes, who plays on this album and helped steer Abajian's musical career. Abajian later created the stage name \"J. D. Allen\" (because for some reason people had trouble pronouncing his real name, despite Armenian being a phonetical language) and also performed with his wife Alice using a few different names for their duo. Alice Abajian passed away in 2000, and J. D. Allen shifted gears away from secular country into singing strictly gospel material, albeit with plenty of twang. He's recorded several other albums under that name, including Windy City Cowboy, Out Of Our Hands, and Heaven Is My Home. The tracks on this album seem to have been recorded over the course of several years, at different studios between 1976 and 1985. In addition to Rhodes playing steel on several tracks, the backing musicians included producer Gary Rowles (who made some records of his own) and Herb Pedersen, who sings backup vocals on a track or two.\n\nAllen Adams \"The Better Life\" (Kay-Lou Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jacquline Adams, Manuel Alvarez & Gary Sloan)\n\nA really cool album with a very understated, stripped-down feel and some very interesting material, delivered in a unique, discursive style that kinda reminds me of Dick Feller. Although he born in Oklahoma, Allen R. Adams moved out to California when he was still quite young, along with his family, which included his brother Charles, who also played country music. The Allens settled down in Eureka and may have done some local shows, though I suspect just on an informal basis... This album was recorded in the Central Valley, at Manny Alvarez's studio in Visalia, with backing by drummer Rick Burr, Max Denning (fiddle), Paul Dobbs (steel guitar), Eddie Sartuche Jr. (guitar), and Ron Schendel on keyboards. These guys all seem to have been from the San Joaquin Valley, notably steel player Dobbs, a Fresno-based picker who did session work with folks like Dennis Payne as well as local gospel artists such as the Gospelaires. I'm not sure if Mr. Allen also lived in the Valley at the time, or if driving down to Visalia was just easier than looking for a studio closer to home... At any rate, there wasn't much info about Mr. Adams to be found online, though I think we was still living up in Eureka pretty recently, though this seems to have been his only recording. Honestly? I think this is a great record. Very personal, very guieless and sincere, and packing with distinctive material, the kind of tunes that tug at your mind just around the time the last chorus is about to fade away. If I had a label, this is one I would reissue.\n\nPappy Adams \"My Kind Of Country\" (Ropes Records, 1984) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gary Adams & Gary Denton)\n\nSouthern California songwriter Gary T. Adams penned all the songs on this album, with one (\"Johnny's Job\") co-written with Burton Carey and another (\"Final Touches\") with Elmer Garten. He's backed by a band that included pedal steel player Red Rhodes, along with a slew of more obscure SoCal players, with co-producer Gary Denton playing drums and guitar... This set was recorded in Van Nuys, California, though I couldn't find out much more about this guy.\n\nMistress Mary (Afton) \"Housewife\" (Afton Records, 1969) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Mary Afton)\n\nAn ambitious, wonderfully flawed outsider-art album apparently self-released in 1969 by Southern California musical indie auteur Mary Afton. It's not all country, although the opening track, \"And I Didn't Want You,\" is a great twangtune where a tremulous, angst-ridden Ms. Afton displays a striking vocal likeness to Lucinda Williams. Soon after, though, she starts to channel more pop-oriented contemporaries such as Nancy Sinatra and Margo Guryan, with maybe just a touch of the Shaggs in the mix as well. Admittedly, this album requires a bit of charity on the part of modern listeners, but I agree with others that Ms. Afton shouldn't be considered a joke artist -- more like she was few decades ahead of her time, but had limited resources when she DIY'd this highly unusual record. There's plenty of ear-bending accidental glory on here, notably on the second track, \"Dance Little Girl,\" a wildly warped take on the Carole King/Brill Building sound where the shrill backing music anticipates a lot of the lo-fi experimentation of the 1990s and beyond. The backing band is said to include country-rock luminaries such as steel player Carl Walden and guitarist Clarence White, who graft a Byrds-y style onto her kooky meanderings, while the satirical back cover liners portray Ms. Afton as an indolent, lingerie-clad stereotypical \"bored housewife\" of the era. Afton pressed a few hundred copies of this album and sent many of them out to radio stations and press, though after it (not surprisingly) tanked, she shifted gears and pursued a few feminist-oriented career paths (including self-defense instructor and auto mechanic/teacher) before finding her most profitable niche as an aerobic disco-dance teacher. Naturally, this album was reissued in 2016 -- with bonus tracks and informative liner notes -- and while it seems too good to be real, it is an amazing, authentic relic of the hippie era. Not that easy to listen to, but really kind of brilliant.\n\nDennis Agajanian/The Agajanians -- see artist profile\n\nSingin' Sam (Agins) \"Singin' Sam's Saddlebag Of Songs\" (Haywire Records, 1971-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Sam Agins)\n\nStraight-up cowboy music from a fella who grew up in Corona, California, in the hills up above Anaheim. Agins says he learned country and old-timey tunes from migrant workers who came to the area during the Dust Bowl when he was a kid, then devoted himself to cowboy culture, gathering and writing songs that he performed at various gatherings, including a 1971 folk festival in Montreal, Canada that was organized by the Smithsonian Institution. This album appears to have been completely self-produced; it's not clear if some of these songs were his own originals. It has to be said, Mr. Agins is kind of a rough hewn, even somewhat erratic vocalist, though perhaps this will translate favorably for listeners in search of unaffected, unpretentious \"real people\" artists. He certainly seems like he quite a character!\n\nSingin' Sam (Agins) \"Singin' Sam And Friends\" (Haywire Records, 1975-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Sam Agins)\n\nAnother set of eccentric acoustic oldies, with covers of chestnuts such as \"The Cat Came Back,\" \"Good Old Mountain Dew,\" \"Had But Fifty Cents,\" \"Philadelphia Lawyer\" and \"Silver Haired Daddy Of Mine,\" along with more obscure campfire songs like \"Cowboy Nick,\" \"Iron Pants Pete\" and \"Peon Named Pancho.\" Sam Agins sings and plays guitar on all tracks, accompanied by Len Bacon on guitar, Kirk Opyt (guitar) and Joe Wolverton (mandolin), as well as Californian banjo picker Jim Hawkins playing on one track. The most notable of these sidemen was Mr. Wolverton (1906-1994) a veteran hillbilly performer originally from Chicago who is said to have taught Les Paul how to play guitar(!) and who led his own cowboy trio out West in his later years. (It's possible that the other guys were part of Wolverton's California band, though I haven't confirmed that yet...) As far as I know this was Mr. Agins' last album...\n\nTony & Susan Alamo \"Mister DJ\" (Alamo Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dan Hoffman)\n\nHere's a weird one. The Alamos were Pentecostal evangelicals whose born-again ministry devolved over the years into a full-blown cult, part of which involved polygamy, and more disturbingly, Mr. Alamo \"marrying\" underage girls and imprisoning them in a compound in Arkansas. Starting out in Los Angeles as \"Jesus freaks\" in the late 'Sixties, the Alamos were only moderately weird up until Mrs. Alamo died in 1982, and then Mr. Alamo really went off the rails and his behavior became more extreme and more grotesque. He was eventually arrested in the early 1990s and eventually convicted for tax evasion and for child molestation, and died in federal prison in 2017. Despite this checkered history, though, this late-'70s album is actually fairly good in musical terms. The cover art shows them onstage with Porter Wagoner at the Opry, so that got my attention: he wrote a testimonial for them in the liner notes, and if Porter liked 'em and sang on their record, I figured I oughta check them out. The album is all Christian music, and the title track, \"Mister DJ,\" is sung by a guy who wants the local radio station to spin \"The Old Rugged Cross.\" Other tracks may have been recorded earlier in non-country versions -- anyone know for sure? Anyway, it's all Jesus-y but there's decent twang in there, too. Super-icky back-story, for sure, but it's up to you how or if those later events should color your perception of this old album.\n\nSusie Allanson -- see artist discography\n\nThe Allen Brothers Band \"Live From The Sail Inn Lounge\" (Arkay Custom Records, 1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rich Krueger)\n\nUltra-authentic bar-band/lounge act country from this clean-cut California combo... The Allen brothers, Jack and Russ, were originally from Decatur, Illinois, moving to California in the early 1960s and forming their first band in '68, although it was put on hold for a few years while Russ Allen served a tour of duty in Vietnam. Meanwhile, Jack Allen and his wife Linda came up with the cash to purchase the Sail Inn Lounge, a bar in Santa Cruz, CA, which is where this album was recorded. You can really hear the ambience of the room, with happy, tipsy customers chat-shouting during the set and whooping their applause... The band was amateurish but sincere, mainly a guitar-based lineup with some fairly haphazard pedal steel licks in the mix. (Steel player Ernie Hagar mainly played gigs around the central coast, though he had a brief, early 'Seventies gig with the Commander Cody band, and also recorded a couple of instrumental albums under his own name.) Here, the Allen Brothers played a few rock tunes -- Santana's \"Evil Ways,\" a couple of Creedence covers (\"Down On The Corner\" and \"Proud Mary,\" of course) and a semi-funky version of the Stones' \"Honky Tonk Woman.\" Mostly though, they seem to have been devoted to country stuff, with versions of \"Six Days On The Road,\" \"Night Life,\" \"Kiss An Angel Good Morning\" and a lively version of \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" where Russ Allen shows some real chops on the banjo. The Sail Inn Lounge changed hands (and names) several times before the property was eventually purchased by the county and converted into the Live Oak branch of the local public library... Although toddler storytime is probably the big show there now, I'm sure many a mellow night was spent at the old bar, back in the days.\n\nJohnny Allen & Norm Halsey \"I'm A Real Live Cowboy\" (Pamrae Records, 1981)\n\n(Produced by Drew Palmer & Ralph Stover)\n\nA fairly strained set of uptempo country novelty songs. Recorded in Stockton, California, this album starts out okay, with the title track, \"I'm A Real Live Cowboy,\" a frantic, twangy satirical jab similar to Chuck Wagon & The Wheel's \"Disco Sucks,\" but taking aim at the urban cowboy crowd instead of the pop-dance scene. As an opening number, it's an okay novelty song, but there are diminishing returns after that. The humor quickly starts sounding more and more desperate, the musicianship more hurried and frayed at the ends, and less and less country. There's a blaring, saxophone-led '50s rock-style number that literally made me get up and move the needle to another track, and the album eventually terminates with a couple of real stinkers -- a bizarre, bad, rock-flavored number called \"The Toll Troll,\" and its immediate reprise, \"Toll Troll Dance,\" which I guess they meant to sound like some kind of faux-electronica/industrial anti-song(?) The swift devolution of what started out as a \"Junk Food Junkie\"-level comedy record leaves you feeling disappointed, and with the distinct impression that these guys maybe should have just made a single, and left it at that. All local musicians, though, including guitarist Dave Azevedo, Jeff Baker (drums), Bobby Davis (banjo), Wes Jones (saxophone), Bobby Niemeyer (pedal steel), Tim O' Connor (fiddle) and Mike Wood on piano. Maybe worth having on your radar, but not a record you're likely to return to very often.\n\nReb Allen \"Country Hits\" (Alshire/Somerset Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nNot sure which of these Reb Allen album's came out first, though this one may have come later. In addition to a cover of \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" a lot of this looks like original material, though as with many of these cheapo discs, there are no songwriter credits, or musician credits. The album was released on a couple of different imprints, both associated with the Los Angeles-based Alshire label.\n\nReb Allen \"The Fightin' Side Of Me\" (Crown Records, 1970-?) (LP)\n\nA California-based also-ran, singer Reb Allen released several singles over a span of years, some of which are reprised here. Although he recorded a bit of uptempo twang in his time -- notably his own bouncy rocker called \"Go Back To Your Honky Tonk\" -- these tracks are mostly pretty languid and low-energy. Dunno much about this guy, though obviously he got into the orbit of the cheapie budget label scene... As with all these Crown LPs, it's not clear who the backing musicans may have been, or when the sessions were recorded.\n\nTerry Allen -- see artist profile\n\nDave Alvin -- see artist profile\n\nAmerican Flyer \"American Flyer\" (United Artists, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by George Martin)\n\nSongwriter Eric Kaz is well-known to fans of the early Bonnie Raitt canon as the composer of the epic weeper, \"Love Has No Pride,\" which he recorded himself while in this soft-rock ensemble formed with Craig Fuller (formerly the lead singer of Pure Prairie League) along with Doug Yule, who at the time had recently helmed the teetering, post-Lou Reed Velvet Underground... This falls more into ornate soft-rock territory than I'd prefer - very '70s, very slick, very LA. But then again, that may be exactly what you're looking for, right?\n\nAmerican Flyer \"Spirit Of A Woman\" (Columbia Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ken Friesen & American Flyer)\n\nAnita Anderson \"Busted Love\" (Dusspri Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by J'Sue LaRue)\n\nIndependently produced would-be Top Forty, early '80s style. Slick but still low-rent enough to be appealing. I couldn't find any info about this bright-voiced gal online... This disc was released on a label from Hollywood, California, with backing by guitar picker Al Bonhormme, Brad Felton on pedal steel, drummer Clay Lowder and Arnold Mitchum on bass. Not a usual-suspects crew by any means, but they were all competent, professional musicians and the songs were similarly workmanlike and commercially-oriented. Anderson's voice seems a bit too girlish and thin -- she sounds like she may actually have been a teenager -- but still you could imagine that with more robust production, she coulda been a contender. This doesn't really wow me, but it ain't bad.\n\nJim Anderson & The Cheyenne Bodie Band \"Dreams\" (Mom Records, 1987) (LP)\n\nNot a ton of info about these Northern California DIY-sters. I don't think vocalist Jim Anderson was a member of the Cheyenne Bodie Band, but rather had them backing him on this disc, although both Anderson and the Bodie Band were making music way up in Redding, CA dating at least back as far as the late 1970s. The group was named after Clint Walker's character in the 1960's TV show, Cheyenne; they stayed together as a local jam band well into the twenty-first century, with the members on this album including Rick Harter (bass), Tom Nash (drums), Barney Paul (lead guitar), Sam Sloan (fiddle) and Robert Lee Smith on guitar. Jim Anderson's background is a little harder to pin down; he recorded at least one single back in the 1970s(?) but it seems like that was more of a rock thing. Not sure how \"country\" to consider this disc, either, but it sure is local!\n\nLiz Anderson -- see artist discography\n\nLynn Anderson -- see artist discography\n\nPete Anderson -- see artist discography\n\nDarol Anger -- see artist profile\n\nAny Old Time String Band \"Any Old Time String Band\" (Bay Records, 1978, 1980)\n\nThis San Francisco Bay Area ensemble was one of the most charming -- and accomplished -- of the late -'70s string band revivalists. The 1996 CD reissue combines two LPs originally released in 1978 and 1980, and features their lovely version of the melodic oldie, \"I'll See You In C-U-B-A,\" originally a hit for vaudeville star Billy Murray way back in 1920. The lineup changed between albums, but Kate Brislin and Sue Draheim were core members of the band, along with Genny Haley on guitar... and their sense of \"old-time\" music, including old-time jazz and Tin Pan Alley material, was right on the button. Very sweet and highly recommended.\n\nAny Old Time \"Ladies' Choice\" (Bay Records, 1983) (LP)\n\nBilly Armstrong \"The World's Greatest Fiddle Player\" (Hillside Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dave Franer & Dean Kay)\n\nWest Coast fiddle whiz Billy Armstrong was originally from Illinois, but made his mark on the Southern California music scene playing in western groups such as the Frontiersmen that were associated with Hal Southern and his cowboy clique, and may have work with some of the Bakersfield bands of the early 1960s. He notably held down a stint as a member of The Sons Of The Pioneers, circa 1966-72, and recorded with the Sons on their albums, including a one-off record as The Country Hombres, which was basically several members of the Sons acting as a pickup band for producer Cliffie Stone. Armstrong seems to have been part of the SoCal nightclub scene, recording with several members of the Palomino Club's house band, including this solo album, which features steel guitarist Jay Dee Maness along with other Palomino alums such Larry Booth and Red Wooten, as well as hot-shot session guitarist Al Bruno. Billy Armstrong is perhaps best known for his thirteen-year run as the Country Music Association's fiddler of the year, a hot streak that earned him the nickname \"the world's greatest fiddle player,\" and is memorialized on these indie instrumental albums. (Note: he also toured in England, and this album was simultaneously released in the UK as Mister Fiddle, on Westwood Records.)\n\nBilly Armstrong \"Billy, Don't Sell Your Fiddle\" (Hillside Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dave Franer)\n\nAnother sweet set packed with vocal tunes as well as instrumental numbers galore. The backing band once again includes several Palomino Club alumni, such as Norm Cass on guitar, pedal steel master Jay Dee Maness, Cliff Stone's son, Curtis Stone on bass, and singer Ray Sanders. As with the album above, this was also released the same year on Westwood Records, using the same title.\n\nBilly Armstrong \"A Man And His Fiddle\" (Hillside Records, 1979) (LP)\n\nBilly Armstrong \"The Best Of Billy Armstrong, Volume One\" (Hillside Records, 1980) (LP)\n\nBilly Armstrong \"Melody Ranch Featuring Billy Armstrong\" (Polera Records, 1980-?) (LP)\n\nThough he completely dropped off the radar in the early 'Eighties, this album seems to suggest that for a while he was working at Gene Autry's Melody Ranch film studio/dude ranch. The trail grows cold on Armstrong after this, with a few folks who worked with him posting online queries about his whereabouts. The most recent mention I could find was a 1982 news clipping about Armstrong headlining a six-piece band for a gig at a PGA celebrity golf tournament... after that, nothing. Any addition info about his career is welcome!\n\nFrancis B. Ashby \"Ashby Country\" (High Sierra Records, 1975) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rich Price)\n\nI guess I'd file this one under the \"you never know, do you?\" department. When I first heard this record in the late '80s, I didn't think it was that great -- maybe I donated it to my radio station or something. But coming across it again years later, deep in the throes of my '70s hippiebilly mania, I could finally hear what a great record this is... Francis Ashby was a West Coast country fan who herded together a mix of old-timers and longhair pickers to back him on a dozen of his own original songs, many of which are quite good... The record opens with \"Welfare,\" a modern-day working-man's ballad that has a Merle Haggard feel, but slightly more liberal leanings -- the liner notes talk about Ashby's own bout with chronic unemployment, so while the song is gritty, it's also compassionate. Various heart songs, train songs and honkytonk numbers follow, with passionate, razor-sharp lyrics. This San Francisco session was helmed by local cowpoke Rich Price, who later recorded for the same label, but unlike Price -- who got a bunch of high-power Nashville superpickers to back him -- Ashby's band seems to have been little-known locals, and they really put a lot into their performance... This is one of the stronger hard-country indiebilly albums of the era, a little idiosyncratic and rough around the edges, but definitely worth checking out. An energetic, original off-the-radar '70s country album.\n\nAsleep At The Wheel -- see artist profile\n\nJim Austin \"Live In The Desert\" (Malea Records, 1973-?) (LP)\n\nLonghair country from... \"the desert\"? Which desert?? Where? When?? There's an awful lot that's sincerely cool about this album, especially its laid-back, low-rent, unpretentious vibe. The lanky, bearded, denim-clad Mr. Austin on the blurry front cover sure looks like some Waylonesque country outlaw, but in fact this is a simple, back-to-basics set with old-guy sounding vocals that evoke Hank Snow as much as Willie Nelson. The liner notes aren't completely forthcoming about where Mr. Austin was from, though the cover shows him hanging around outside the Branding Iron Steak House, which as it turns out was located in Indio, California, out near Palm Springs. In order to that find out, though, you have to listen to the whole album and to all of Mr. Austin's laconic stage patter, which is embedded within two album-side long tracks which, charmingly, have crude tape edits though no separate tracks. The more I listen to this record, the more I like it. Late in the set, the singer introduces the boys in the band -- by first name only -- with onstage shout-outs to bass player Russ, drummer Terry, and guitarist Tommy. He also lets the audience in on a little secret, that the band had barely rehearsed his original songs. This may help explain the loose-limbed feel throughout -- which, by the way, I think is an absolute strength. Nothing flashy, nothing dazzling, just a humble hired band doing their best to back up an ambitious amateur. There's mention on the back cover of Austin have worked with (or having been known by) folks like Jimmy Bryant, Randy Harris, and Doug McGinnis, though it's unclear where or when this might have happened. Doesn't really matter, though. The play's the thing, and for my money, this is a really great album. And if I ever get around to putting out an album of this kind of stuff, the closing track, \"Testing, 1-2-3\" is right at the top of my list.\n\nKay Austin \"The Hit Kit\" (Corrall Records, 1977) (LP)\n\nA country gal from Southern California, Kenne Jeanne Austin made a big splash in the early 'Seventies and worked with several pioneers of the West Coast country scene, notably Bakersfield-ians Fuzzy Owens and Red Simpson. She originally came from Long Beach and mostly worked the casinos in Nevada, making it onto the Opry stage in Nashville at least once (there's a picture on the back cover of her other album...) She led her own band for several years, touring mostly on the West Coast, but also nationally in the mid-1970s, after she hit the scene as a \"promising new artist\" in 1974. In addition to these two LPs, Ms. Austin also released several singles, including the 1976 novelty song, \"(This New) Woman's Lib,\" which doesn't appear on either of her albums. Austin also earned a footnote in the soul world as one of the handful of country and pop artists signed to Mike Curb's \"MC\" label, an ill-fated, country-oriented offshoot of Motown Records that seems to have pressed several records that were never actually released. Austin plugged away on the country scene for about a decade before switching gears to become a Southern Gospel artist in the early 'Eighties.\n\nKay Austin \"Only A Woman\" (EIO Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jack Boles, Ray Ruff & Don Lee)\n\nUnlike her first album, this one is less reliant on cover songs, packed instead with newer material, including -- interestingly enough -- a couple of songs by Linda Hargrove. This includes two tracks from her short-lived MC Records contract, as well as four songs that came out as singles on EIO. Two of the songs that were released as singles made it into the Billboard Back Forty, \"The Rest Of Your Life\" (which hit #86) and \"Two Hearts Beat (Better Than One)\" (which peaked at #75.)\n\nBack Pocket \"Buzzard Bait\" (Joyce Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Pat Robinson & Pat Maroshek)\n\nA one-off collaboration with various Southern California pickers, this band was led by songwriter Pat Robinson, who wrote all the material and sang lead in an amiable, lightly nasal twang that occasionally takes on a fragility that's suggestive of Neil Young. Also on board were the core members of the early '70s country-rock band, Swampwater -- guitarist John Beland, fiddler Gib Guilbeau and steel player Thad Maxwell -- as well as bluegrasser Larry McNeely picking banjo, and drummer Pat Maroshek, who I think was considered the band's co-leader with Robinson. The music is light, bouncy, bubblegummy country-rock material similar to some early Eagles recordings or the airier side of the Byrds -- kinda lightweight and lighthearted, but decent for the genre and a fine example of what the twangsters were up to at the time. This band never really went anywhere, but the album's worth checking out if you're a big fan of the late-vintage Burrito Brothers, or just SoCal country-rock in general. (And dig the so-very SoCal liner notes dedication to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard... groovy, man!!)\n\nThe Bakersfield Five \"Buckaroo\" (Alshire Records, 1969-?) (LP)\n\nOne of the more blatant rip-off records in the \"soundalike\" genre... even by the Alshire label's somewhat fungible standards. I mean, Buck Owens and his band were really a brand name, and Alshire really went out of their way to make this look like a Buckaroos album. Granted many of the (sadly) unidentified musicians on this exploito-album may have played in Buck's band at one time or another, and doubtless they were recruited from the longhair country-rock scene of the Palomino Club which fostered pickers such as Dennis Payne and Jerry Inman, although no one is identified by name on the jacket. There are a handful of Owens covers -- \"Act Naturally,\" \"Buckaroo,\" \"Crying Time,\" \"Tiger By The Tail\" and \"Together Again\" -- but as is often the case with these cheapo packages it's the original material that may be of more interest. This disc includes several tracks credited to Maverick Music-BMI, though, alas, no specific composer credits. This we get several tunes vaguely in the Don Rich style: \"Buckshot,\" \"Dodad,\" \"Someone,\" \"Tool Pusher\" and \"The Whizer.\" If you think the California Poppy Pickers were groovy, you might dig this disc, too.\n\nLuke Baldwin \"The Tattoo On My Chest\" (Flying Fish Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Luke Baldwin, Tom Mitchell, Tony Markellis & Michael Couture)\n\nA classic 'Seventies hippiebilly/outlaw album from a guy who was pals with latterday hobo-poets Utah Phillips and Bodie Wagner, and had David Bromberg and Jay Ungar jamming with him on this disc... Luke Baldwin was originally a Michigander, and like many folks of his era, he wound up heading West and was part of the mid-'70s SF Bay Area's music scene. Before that he was a politico and poet, doing draft counseling for college-age kids and other political work. He worked odd jobs during the '70s but eventually returned to school, getting a doctorate from Harvard and becoming an expert on literacy and childhood development issues. Folk fans may recognize Baldwin for having written the liner notes to Utah Phillips' Good Though album, and Mr. Phillips returns the favor here, lauding Baldwin as a hippie-era Renaissance man and kindred spirit. As far as I know, this was the only album he recorded... though I'd be pleased to hear about any other albums he played on.\n\nBanana & The Bunch \"Mid-Mountain Ranch\" (Raccoon Records, 1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Stuart Kutchins)\n\nA truly groovy solo album by keyboardist Lowell \"Banana\" Levinger, an original member of The Youngbloods... Here, he indulges a passion for old-time mountain music, ala The Carter Family, including a gorgeous version of \"Ocean Of Diamonds.\" The understated simplicity and sincere love of this old-time sound makes this a really special little record. Levinger also cut an album under the name Noggins, but I haven't heard that one yet...\n\nBandera \"Knights\" (MCA Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Leon Tsilis & Pat Higdon)\n\nA little-known Southern rock band formed by California-born jack-of-all-trades Lawrence Shoberg (aka Lore Orion) who started the band while struggling in late-'70s Nashville. These guys tried to go national but fell short, despite signing with MCA and recording their lone album, which is pretty much just a rock record. There isn't much country in their sound, which is mainly build around shrill vocals, a sludgy rhythm section and Allman-esque twin guitars that rarely show a glimmer of originality or a distinctive tone. Fans of .38 Special or Rossington/Collins, et. al., might enjoy this rather workmanlike album, but nothing here really moved me. One of the band's principal songwriters, Lore Orion, was also a visual artist who apparently designed album covers for the New Riders Of The Purple Sage (as well as the one for this album) and also wrote children's books before concentrating on music. He had modest success pitching songs in Nashville, initially with a Top Ten hit for Bill Anderson in 1976 (\"That's What Made Me Love You\") and again after Bandera broke up, when Chris Ledoux and Tim McGraw covered a few tunes (though nothing that wound up as a single...) One of these songs, \"Illegal,\" is on this album in its original form as a sort of clunky redneck reggae. All in all, a pretty negligible disc, but the iceberg-tip of a remarkable career. Footnote: although Orion wasn't actually from Bandera, TX, he did wind up moving there, following the \"outlaw\" trail to Austin and putting down roots nearby.\n\nRue Barclay & Johnny Davis \"The Wanderer\" (Rural Rhythm Records, 1968-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jim O'Neal)\n\nRue Barclay \"The Nashville Scene: Working Man Blues And Other Country and Western Favorites\" (Crown Records, 1969) (LP)\n\nThis is kind of a weird and wonderful record, one of the unique byproducts of the fly-by-night ethos of cheapo labels such as Crown Records which issued innumerable knockoff albums alongside odd offerings by little-known artists like Rue Barclay. Unlike many such albums, this one doesn't highlight sketchy of covers of hits of the day: other than a cover of Merle Haggard's \"Working Man Blues,\" the material seems to be mostly original, with kooky permutations of familiar country themes (boozing, losing, etc.) What makes this record really great, though, is its innate not-greatness: Barclay was best known as a bluegrass music producer, and was a dubious vocalist at best, his singing full of all kinds of tics and foibles. Consequently, the band behind him just kind of goes nuts, jamming and improving noodly rock'n'roll riffs like they scored this weird gig but they just didn't care how it turned out. Like many of these old LPs, the band was made up of unidentified, anonymous studio pickers and doubtless included some top country-rock talent - there's a definite hippie-rock undercurrent to a lot of their electrified twanging around. In short, this disc has a nice, so-bad-it's-good flavor to it, and it's definitely worth a spin, both for laughs and for genuine country twang. As seen below, Rue Barclay continued to perform and recorded at least one more album, although by that time he'd shifted to a less secular style.\n\nRue Barclay \"Country And Folk Gospel Songs\" (Christian Faith Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nAlvis Barnett -- see artist discography\n\nSkip Battin \"Skip\" (Signpost Records, 1972) (LP)\n\nBassist Clyde \"Skip\" Battin made his mark as a core member of several early-'70s lineups of the Byrds, and kept up his country-rock bona fides as a member of the equally fluid New Riders of the Purple Sage and Flying Burrito Brothers. This was Battin's solo debut, an oddball cosmic country-rock album, with contributions from guitarist Clarence White and Roger McGuinn of the Byrds. The musical end I like, though I can't say I'm a fan of Battin's vocals, which make it hard to really enjoy the record as such. Battin worked frequently with LA scenester and rock uber-weirdo Kim Fowley, and Fowley helped shape this album in his own unique way.\n\nSkip Battin \"Topanga Skyline\" (Floating World Records, 2012)\n\n(Produced by Kim Fowley)\n\nOriginally recorded in 1973, this would turn out to be Battin's great \"lost album,\" a session booked with the progressive bluegrass band Country Gazette, along with pedal steel player Al Perkins. The project was apparently ill-starred, as it was scheduled for just days after the tragic death of guitarist Clarence White, a friend and collaborator of Battin's as well as the brother of the Gazette's Roland White, who was injured in the same automobile accident that killed Clarence. Despite all the bad karma, they went ahead and recorded the album, but it stayed in the vaults for almost thirty years; the 2012 CD release also includes some bonus tracks from an album recorded years later with Kim Fowley...\n\nBaywood \"Baywood\" (Bison Records, 1981) (LP)\n\nThis 5-song EP showcased the early work of a short-lived but ambitious indiebilly band who I believe were from California.\n\nBaywood \"Live At The Palomino, '81\" (Little Wheel Music, 2008)\n\nIssued nearly 30 years after the fact, this fine live album captures an unusually accomplished indie-twang band playing their hearts out in one of LA's premier rock clubs. The band is pretty tight, executing some ambitious country-rock/AOR riffs and complex harmonies -- stuff that echoes the Southern California pop style of the mid-1970s, though perhaps a bit dated by '81. You could really almost imagine them making it big, except that, if the truth be told, the vocals hold them back. Their lead singer was clearly the driving force behind this band, but his gangly, unconventional vocal timbre makes this an un-commercial offering, even though it's also an excellent example of just how polished and skillful these local bands could become, while still hovering on the edge of success. Worth checking out, especially for the wealth of original material.\n\nThe Bear Spot \"At The Grist Mill Inn\" (Century Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nA real mystery disc from Northern California, this seems to be a celebration of the Grist Mill Inn, a restaurant in the tiny, secluded Sonoma County hamlet of Glen Ellen. The Grist Mill location was host to a long string of restaurants and night spots; this album's remarkably uninformative liner notes mention that the musicians were celebrating the tenure of owners Craig Murry and Judy Murray, who seem to have given up management of the Inn by the time this album was made. Anyway, it's an odd record. There is some canonically \"country\" material on here, such as a version of \"Mr. Bojangles,\" though also covers of pop tunes like \"Piano Man\" and \"If I Were A Rich Man,\" giving this a more deliberately lounge-scene orientation. I'll keep you posted. This seems to have come out around 1974-75, or thereabouts... The musicians are not identified, alas, although I do wonder if \"The Bear Spot\" band was a permutation of local Sonoma County band, Beargrease, led by Michael Hansen (1948-2016). It's a theory, though one which has not yet been verified.\n\nBeau Brummels \"Bradley's Barn\" (Warner Brothers, 1968)\n\n(Produced by Lenny Waronker)\n\nA groovy country-tinged set from one of San Francisco's great garage-pop bands of the mid-1960s... This was the last album the group recorded in the '60s, as their hitmaking days faded and the group began drifting apart. Singer Sal Valentino guitarist Ron Elliott were essentially the only original members left, and they headed to Nashville to see if the Music City way of doing things would work for them. The duo booked sessions at Owen Bradley's studio, hiring a crew that included usual suspect superpickers such as Kenny Buttrey and Norbert Putnam, as well as hot-shot guitarist Jerry Reed, who adds some of his trademark chicken-pickin' licks. With the exception of a lone Randy Newman song at album's end, the songs are all originals, including several written along with longtime collaborator Bob Durand... This was the band's -Sixties swansong, with Sal Valentino going off to join the bluesier Stoneground, and Elliott doing session work in LA. A nice early milestone in the evolution of mainstream country-rock.\n\nTerry Beck \"Live At Bogart's\" (TRB Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rick Woolsey, Jim Blasingame & Terry Beck)\n\nA rough and rugged live album from a club in Long Beach, California where singer Terry Beck seems to have had a long-term residency. The set includes covers of \"Aime,\" \"Long Haired Country Boy,\" \"Mr. Bojangles,\" \"Two Horsemen\" and \"The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald.\" Pretty darn Seventies, even if it was recorded a few years later!\n\nKathy Bee \"Stings\" (Erika Records, 1988) (LP)\n\n(Produced by James H. Benoit, Michael Coleman & Bob Dire)\n\nOff-brand, indie twang from Southern California's Kathy Bee, originally an Ohio gal who headed out West to make it big, and who gives off kind of a Loretta Haggers vibe on this album... This seems the very epitome of a private press vanity album (terrible title and all) although she summoned some legitimate twang, particularly on the album's uptempo single, \"Let's Go Party,\" which hit #100 on the Billboard charts in 1988. This set was recorded at some slick, modern, second-tier studio in Claremont, California, with what I assume was a studio crew of hired hands... The name that caught my eye was that of legendary bluegrass fiddler Byron Berline, who turns in a solid performance, along with Pete Cooper on guitar, Roy Durnal (bass), Jay Farnes (saxophone), Joel Ferguson (pedal steel), Bill Henrich (drums), and arranger Andre Mayeaux on synthesizer. This album was preceded by a 1985 single (a topical tune about child abuse, called \"Momma Don't You Love Me\" b/w \"Growin' Up Alone\") and though neither of those songs appear here, the single provides a clue to Ms. Bee's background, giving a songwriter credit to \"K. Benoit,\" which may have been her real name. Kathy Bee didn't stick with her music career, but went on to a long string of entrepreneurial projects which seem to fall mainly in the inspirational/motivational category (\"dream catching,\" etc.) and has had a persistent online presence right up through the 2020s.\n\nJohn Beland -- see artist discography\n\nThe Bend Fiddle Jammers \"Jam\" (Ashland Records, 1976-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rick Dugan)\n\nA large community ensemble from the tiny agricultural hamlet of Bend, California, located on the Sacramento River, north of Chico. With about two dozen members performing on this album, the group was mostly made up of kids (though the age range was from seven to 70) with most musicians playing the fiddle, guided by folks on guitar, bass and mandolin, with a washboard for percussion. The repertoire is packed with old-timey/bluegrass standards (\"Boil Them Cabbage Down,\" \"Old Joe Clark,\" et. al.) and a smidge of western swing. By the end of the decade, the project had run its course, though in 1980 a new group came together, eventually coalescing into a smaller band called Loosely Strung, which performed locally in Shasta and Tehama counties. Pretty sure this was the only Jammers album, recorded sometime in the mid-to-late 'Seventies.\n\nJohnny Bennett \"Two Cheeseburgers And A Chocolate Malt\" (Sierra Pacific Records, 1984) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Carl Walden & Johnny Bennett)\n\nThis album's got one of those \"hassled by the cops\" covers (a popular theme among country musicians) showing California cowboy Johnny Bennett getting pulled over on the front cover... and handcuffed next to his truck on the back! Bennett was living in Pomona, CA when he cut this album, and soon moved to Chino, where he sang on weekends at a joint called Joeyâs Bar-B-Q -- a gig held for over thirty years(!) Along with a slew of original tunes, Bennett covers some big hits (and assorted cool tunes) from the early '80s, like Johnny Lee's \"Looking For Love,\" Willie Nelson's \"On The Road Again,\" and Guy Clark's \"Heartbroke.\" The musicians seem to be SoCal locals, with major contributions from producer/multi-instrumentalist Carl Walden.\n\nJohnny Bennett \"Give Me Credit\" (Sierra Pacific Records, 1986) (LP)\n\nAbout half the songs on here are Bennett's own, framed by well-chosen, eclectic covers, with a tilt towards the croonier end of country -- Bob McDill's \"Amanda,\" \"Night Life,\" Ian Tyson's \"Someday Soon,\" \"Walk Through This World With Me.\" The originals include \"Carolina Fever,\" \"Give Me Credit,\" \"The Same Dream\" and one called \"Cotton Eyed Joe.\" Bennett recorded several other albums and singles -- I'm still looking for the one that has his song, \"If Youâve Got A Pickup, Then Youâve Got A Lot Of Friends,\" which seems like it'd be a classic.\n\nJohnny Bennett \"Face On The Barroom Floor\" (Sierra Pacific Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Johnny Bennett, Morgan Cavett & Carl Walden)\n\nOne of those funny, hah-hah album titles that's even more amusing when you find out that the \"face\" in question was actually an old painting (pictured on the cover) that was left a bazillion years ago on an old barroom in California's gold country, up above Sacramento. Four songs are Johnny Bennett originals, including the title track and four others, \"Ain't That Just Like A Memory,\" \"Face On The Barroom Floor,\" \"Secret To The Grave,\" and \"Summer Of '41.\" Among the musicians backing Bennett on this album are fiddler Side Page and multi-instrumentalist Carl Walden. Not sure of the exact year of release, or if Bennett recorded other stuff after this came out.\n\nRon Bernard \"Friends And Lovers\" (Bridgewire Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Hutcherson, DeWayne Orender & Ron Bernard)\n\n'80s indiebilly from the Fresno suburb of Clovis, California... Includes the locally-themed \"Raisin City Blues,\" as well as a bunch of weepers such as \"Why Can't Old Lovers Be Friends,\" \"Every Time I Fall In Love, It Falls Apart\" and \"Pickin' Up The Pieces Of Me.\" (An interesting aside: this album was partly recorded at the Fresno-based Trac Recordings studio -- the same label that recorded the \"Country Revolution\" band in 1974.)\n\nBob Bernstein \"Country Mobile Home Park\" (Bob Bernstein Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Bernstein)\n\nAn all-original set from a Southern California indie twangster living in Vista, CA, near San Diego... Bernstein started playing in a duet with John Moore, who also sings lead on this album. It's a family affair throughout, with Bernstein's daughter, Jaqueline Carol Gordon, singing harmony, as well as Moore's sister Julie on a tune or two, and some steel guitar by Richard Craig and Tim Cook, and banjo by Dennis Caplinger, and picking and singing by various SoCal locals. All the songs are Bob Bernstein originals...\n\nWayne Berry \"Home At Last\" (RCA Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Norbert Putman)\n\nI'm listing this one not so much because it really fits into the '70s country vibe I'm into, but because I keep seeing it mentioned as a lost country-rock gem, and I'm not so sure I agree. Apparently Berry was previously in a SoCal band called Timber and was pals with Tommy Talton, of the band Cowboy. Which all gives him country-rock cred, I guess, but a lot of this is just tepid, strained '70s soft rock. There are some pleasantly twangy tunes, though nothing I'd recommend you try too hard to track down: \"Black Magic Gun,\" \"Welcome Home\" and \"Gene's Tune (Blonde Guitar)\" are about it for me. This was apparently a big studiofest, with heavy hitters such as Barry Beckett, Johnny Gimble and Pete Carr sitting in, as well as several guys from the Area Code 615 band, and some pedal steel on a few tracks, courtesy of Weldon Myrick. Worth checking out, I guess, but it didn't really float my boat.\n\nBethlehem \"Bethlehem\" (Maranatha Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Al Perkins & Tom Stipe)\n\nAn exemplary \"Jesus freak\" country-rock gospel album, one of the more musically convincing releases on the Southern California-based Maranatha label... Indeed, this slick, melodic set sounds like something that could have been released by superstar contemporaries such as Poco or America, just with a persistent religious message, lots of smooth vocal harmonies and smooth, super-professional musical arrangements, multi-tracked to a fare-thee-well by country-rock sideman Al Perkins and his earnest crew. The band was led by singer Danny Daniels, who was a pastor in the hippie-adjacent Vineyard movement, and apparently a founder of the Maranatha label (according to Discogs.) The shaggy-looking bros on the album cover also included drummer Dan McCleery, Dom Franco (dobro and steel guitar), John Falcone (bass), Randy Rigby on keyboards and lead guitar. All but two of the songs were originals credited to \"Glenn Daniels\" (apparently an alias for lead singer Danny Daniels) while steel player Dominic Franco sings the other two, which were both his own compositions. Various and sundry Maranatha-ites also chime in: Al Perkins strums some guitar, Richie Furay sings harmony, Furay's keyboard player Tom Stipe is one of the album's producers, etc. This album cuts both ways -- on one hand, the confident professionalism of the production makes this one of the better and more musically satisfying Jesus Movement country albums, though more secular-minded twangfans might find the evangelical messaging a bit cloying and narrowly focussed. Potato, patato, I guess.\n\nJan Bird \"...Sings Down Home Sounds, With Ernie Hagar's Swingin' Steel\" (Meagher Electronics/High Hopes Incorporated, 1973) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jim Meagher & Paul Smith)\n\nSinger-guitarist Jan Bird was originally from Weed, California and she'd moved to Monterey and was playing gigs at the Highlands Inn, in Carmel at the time she cut this album. Local steel guitar whiz Ernie Hagar plays pedal steel and dobro on here, as well as arranging the album, with banjo by Bob Cameron and guitar and bass by Russ Allen. Bird balances a few folkie tracks like \"Last Thing On My Mind\" and \"Fire And Rain\" against a raft of country tunes -- stuff \"Heartaches By The Number,\" \"Cold Cold Heart\" and \"It's Such A Pretty World Today.\" Interesting song selection, and a cool cast of characters from California's Central Coast.\n\nDebi Blackwood \"Soulful Sounds\" (Vision Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Leon Harris)\n\nAn unusual offering from Vision Records, a fierce little indie label from Modesto, California that captured some of the twangier sounds of the Central Valley's country gospel scene. I was first drawn to this album wondering if Debi Blackwood was related to the southern gospel Blackwood Brothers (don't think so) but then delighted to find another Vision LP. My sense of triumph was slightly dimmed by the record itself, which is stylistically distant from other releases on the label -- no pedal steel or mandolin here, but rather a strong tilt towards contemporary black pop-gospel, with several covers of Andre Crouch songs, and the spirit of Aretha Franklin hovering not far over Ms. Blackwood's expansive though uneven vocals. She had a strong set of pipes and could hit some great notes, but her sense of phrasing could get a little slippery... Besides which, this isn't really the kind of gospel music I'm into. Hailing from Blythe, California, in the desert area bordering Arizona, Ms. Blackwood was backed by Harold Bell (lead guitar), Danny Burchett (piano), Jimmy Harris (drums) and Danny Well on bass -- not sure if these were Central Valley or desert musicians, though most likely they were recruited by producer Leon Harris for these sessions.\n\nRic Blake \"Something For Everyone\" (Fifth Lane Room Record Company, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ray Kunshier & John Anderson)\n\nThis one looks a little sketchy, perhaps, with Side One dominated by '70s soft pop covers, ranging from \"More Than A Woman\" and \"You Light Up My Life\" (yikes) to Jim Croce's \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,\" although B. J. Thomas's \"Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song\" is getting a little closer. But hey, flip the platter and Side Two is packed with honest-to-gosh country hits, stuff like \"For The Good Times,\" \"Luckenbach, Texas,\" and \"Long Tall Texan,\" so I guess we can give this guy a pass. A lounge performer, obviously, who played all the instruments himself. Not sure where Blake played live, though this album was recorded in LA, at the Annex Studios, in Hollywood, California.\n\nRic Blake & Karen \"Dancers\" (Trac Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Stan Anderson)\n\nI assume this is the same Ric Blake as above, this time accompanied by a gal simply called \"Karen,\" no last name given. They appear to be from California's Central Valley, recording this album at the legendary Trac studio, based in Fresno, though I couldn't find any information about either of them online. All the songs are Ric Blake originals, with one song co-written with Ed Leverette. The backing musicians aren't identified, other than lead guitar and pedal steel player Terry Christoffersen, who gets a credit on the back cover. No date on this album, or on the single (\"Overnight Sensation\") though this definitely looks like a mid-1980s effort, particularly Karen's big, mega-permed hair, which has a very Reba McEntire vibe. Ric Blake seems to have been active on the San Joaquin Valley roots music scene, with a thank-you mention on Ron Bernard's album, which was also produced by Stan Anderson. Anyone who has more info to offer, I'm all ears!\n\nJohnny Blankenship \"Hard On The Heart\" (OL Records, 1984) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Don Felts)\n\nA multi-instrumentalist who has had a longtime gig playing at Knott's Berry Farm in Southern California, Johnny Blankenship was also part of Johnny and Sharon Leighton's 1960s/'70s band(s). He cut this album for Overton Lee's ultra-obscuro label, recording a set that was mostly songs written by producer Don Felts, along with two by Blankenship, published through Lee's publishing company. Couldn't find much info about Blankenship (or this album) online, though I gather he's still holding down his day job at the Knott's Berry amusement park...\n\nLeroy Blankenship \"Call Him A Song\" (Gospel Heritage Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Wayne Walters)\n\nLeroy Blankenship \"Retirement Plan\" (Gospel Heritage Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Wayne Walters)\n\nA country gospel set recorded in Nashville, with some Music City heavyweights such as Hoot Hester, Willie Rainford and Bruce Watkins helping fill out the sound alongside West Coast pickers like Alvis Barnett, Leroy Blankenship, producer Wayne Walters and a few of his family members. A few of the songs are originals, including two by Mr. Blankenship and one from Wayne Walters.\n\nBlue Ridge Rangers \"Blue Ridge Rangers\" (Fantasy Records, 1973) (LP)\n\n(Produced by John Fogerty)\n\nAwesome!! After Creedence Clearwater Revival imploded, John Fogerty got so fed up with the fratricidal aspects of actually being in a band, that he promptly went off and recorded an album all by himself -- played all the instruments, picked all the tunes, multitracked the album, and totally rocked out. This is the result, a masterful set of country oldies, covering artists such as Jimmie Rodgers, Webb Pierce and Melvin Endsley, all with a jocular, rolling bounciness that can't help but win you over. He perfectly captures the wild tang and explosive bang of old-school, rock-meets-hillbilly blues of the 1950s and early '60s. This is a really fun record, the kind that makes you sing along every time you hear it. Fun stuff!!\n\nJimmy Boatright \"What's His Face\" (Rea Records, 1974-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Faron Young & Doug McDowell)\n\nA likeable presence, if not totally an A-list singer, Southern California's Jimmy Boatright had solid hard-country roots and a clear love of traditional honky-tonk country. For several decades, Boatright and his wife Rea owned a popular country bar in the Los Angeles suburb of Agoura Hills, near Simi Valley. They bought the Quarter Horse Inn in 1974, after Mr. Boatright had led the house band there for several years. They changed the bar's name to Casa Rea in 1976 for insurance purposes, after a drunken cop shot someone one night, running it as a combination nightclub and Mexican restaurant. Somewhere along the way, he met country star Faron Young, who produced this album, with strong backing by an unidentified studio crew that I suspect may actually have included members of Faron Young's band, the Deputies. (The graphics on this LP cover resemble those of some of the Deputies' \"solo\" records...) Other than a cover of Harlan Howard's \"Another Bridge To Burn,\" many of these songs are pretty obscure; a version of Billy Joe Shaver's \"Black Rose\" places this album sometime after 1973. The Boatrights sold their bar in 2001, and retired to Nevada.\n\nBobbi And Clyde \"...And The Seaweed Cowboys\" (BCS Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nThe Southern California duo of Bobbi McGavran and Clyde Lucas worked in a wide variety of venues, including a stint as the house band at Knott's Berry Farm, gigs with various country rockers and later, work in film and TV. This album was made with Bill Cunningham and J. Scott Hendrickson, who wrote about half the songs on the album. Not sure of the year on this one, but I think it's of late 1970s vintage.\n\nThe Bonner Family \"Finally\" (Records & Productions, Inc., 1985) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Russ Gary)\n\nA family album by a country harmonizing family band from Rancho Cucamonga, California. Their father, Jim Bonner, was originally from Buffalo, NY where as a kid he worked playing piano in local groups such as Guy McAdams band, but he moved out West in the early '70s and settled down in San Bernardino County. He taught his kids how to play country music and they were eventually discovered by independent producer Overton Lee who got them gigs at Southern California venues such as the Mule Lip Saloon and the Palomino Club in Hollywood, as well as at county fairs and other events. The Bonners were kind of on a roll when they made this album, doing TV shows and recording at least one album... It looks like there's a lot of original material on this album, with several songs credited to \"G. Davis.\"\n\nRob Bonner \"Start All Over Again\" (JVR Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rob Bonner)\n\nSongwriter Rob Bonner was part of the Sacramento, California folk/bluegrass/stringband scene, and has stalwarts such as Allan Hendricks and the South Loomis Quickstep band backing him, as well as Joe Craven playing mandolin on some songs. As far as I know this was his only album...\n\nThe Boogie Band \"Haulin' Ass Bluegrass\" (ECV Records, 1988)\n\n(Produced by Brian Hauck)\n\nThough they billed themselves as bluegrassers, this Northern California band enjoyed a pretty diverse palette, covering cowboy tunes and oldies such as \"Life Is Like A Mountain Railroad,\" \"Rocky Top,\" and the Stanley Brothers' \"How The Mountain Girls Can Love,\" along with country and outlaw classics like Chuck Wagon & The Wheel's \"My Girl Passed Out In Her Food,\" Rodney Crowell's \"California Earthquake,\" \"Ya'll Come Back Saloon\" by the Oak Ridge Boys, and \"London Homesick Blues\" (mislabeled \"Armadillo\" on this album, and credited to Jerry Jeff Walker, rather than Gary P. Nunn). Heck, they even played Loudon Wainwright's \"Dead Skunk\" -- so you can see why I had to pick this one up, right? The Boogie Band hung their Stetsons and straw hats just north of Sacramento, up around Chico, CA. Made up of Nick Becker on bass, Jim Brown (banjo), Kenny Falkenstrom (harmonica), Steve Hamm (mandolin), Jim Rutherford (guitar), Mack Whitley (guitar) and J. J. Yolton on guitar, the group first got together around 1974, and were playing together as recently as 2015(!) Several bandmembers lived in Paradise, the tiny mountain town that was razed by climate change-driven wildfires in 2018, which, if we're lucky, may lead to a good old-fashioned disaster ballad from these pickers someday.\n\nJohnny Booth \"Country '67\" (Uni Records, 1967) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Cliffie Stone & Hugh Davies)\n\nOne of the many alumni of LA's booming country-rock scene, Florida native \"Johnny\" Booth -- aka songwriter Tony Booth -- took over the Palomino Club's house band in the late 'Sixties, later passing the reins to his brother Larry after Bakersfield baron Buck Owens tapped him to become a Top Forty star in the early 'Seventies. He was still struggling to break through when he cut this album, mostly a set of cover tunes recorded semi-anonymously, although on a major label imprint. The set list is heavy on recent Bakersfield hits from the likes of Wynn Stewart and Bobby Austin, as well as pop tunes and country classics from the likes of George Jones Ned Miller, Ray Price and Wiley Walker. Perhaps most interesting is the involvement of arranger David Gates (later the leader of the '70s AOR juggernaut Bread) who also worked with Booth on some of his early recordings for Capitol Records. A pretty workmanlike album, but definitely worth a spin.\n\nTony Booth -- see artist profile\n\nPaul Bowman & The Country Showmen \"San Francisco's KUDO-TV Presents...\" (1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Paul Bowman Don Humphrey & Roy Bell)\n\nA Northern California native, born in Lodi, Paul Bowman moved up north to Redding, and then to Oregon where he became a country music radio broadcaster and later was recruited by hillbilly legend Rose Maddox to tour with her mid-'Sixties band. After a few years on the road with Maddox and other musicians, Bowman came back to the Golden State and scored a gig on KUDO-TV in San Francisco. The station gave him a weekly show, which is where he was working when he made this album. Alas, there's no info about the recording sessions, other than that it was at the Skinner Studios, in SF.\n\nPaul Bowman \"The Drifter\" (Mark Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Paul Bowman, Don Humphrey & Roy Bell)\n\nA Northern California indie-label twangfest, recorded in San Mateo, CA on a private label from Stockton... This album is packed with original material penned either by Paul Bowman or Don Humphrey... Some of it's kind of densely written, but backed with plenty of Merle Haggard-influenced West Coast twang -- at first I had a hard time getting into it, but Bowman and his crew slowly won me over. The band includes Howard Riley on guitar, with Ron Riley playing pedal steel (as well as Commander Cody's steel player Bobby Black on a tune or two...) Ron Riley also led his own band, Goldrush, and released a live album a couple of years after this one came out. Bowman's TV show was still going strong when this was recorded, and is mentioned in the liner notes, though I don't know when it ended...\n\nPaul Bowman \"The 20/20 Album: 20 Great Years, 20 Great Songs\" (Mark Records, 1986) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Paul Bowman, Jack Daniels & Russ Gary)\n\nJohn Braden \"John Braden\" (A&M Records, 1969) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Henry Lewy)\n\nSort of a folk-country outing, with backing on a few tracks from California-based hippiebilly luminaries such as Ry Cooder, Chris Ethridge, Sneaky Pete Kleinow and various acid rock musicians, as well as jazz musician Paul Horn. John Braden later went on to carve a very successful career as a children's music producer, recording numerous albums for the Kids Stuff label, notably working on game-related albums for Atari, as well as the Strawberry Shortcake and My Little Pony albums. Talk about a long, strange trip!\n\nDick Bray \"Talk With The Man\" (Hyland Records, 1972-?) (LP)\n\nThis is a major mystery record, with no where, when, who or how about it... The liner notes include the song titles and composer credits, and that's about it. I couldn't find anything out about this guy or who was backing him up online: there are a few Dick Brays to choose from but none of them seemed like a good match. Anyway, it's also an odd record, clearly a mega-private vanity release, though Bray seems to have had a confidence borne of some success singing in coffeehouses or somewhere like that. It kicks off with the title track, a folk-ish gospel song that makes you think, uh-oh, it's gonna be one of those albums, but soon shifts into an otherwise exclusively secular mode. Bray's vocal persona quickly gels into a strong similarity with Hoyt Axton and like Axton, he straddles country, folk and a tiny bit of mildly psychedelic pop-rock... On the surface, this seems to be the kind of record that could easily be mocked by the uber-hip, but after a couple of listens, it grew on me, particularly a couple of the odder, more personal-sounding songs. Side Two features the strongest of these, the evocative \"Goin' Goin' Gone\" and the weird, rambling \"He Packed His Guitar,\" a cluttered narrative about some guy who tries to make it in show business, moving to San Francisco in '69 and then down to LA, where he leads a \"comfortable\" life... It's a strange, naifish song, one of several credited to Mick Lloyd, and seems to have an axe or two to grind about the music business: if anyone's looking for songs so include on \"private press\" anthologies, this one's a great candidate. The record is filled with originals, but none were credited to Bray -- was he writing and recording under different names? Was this a song-poem album? Who can tell? But even though my rational mind screams against it, my heart has to accept this untraceable album as a guilty pleasure. Anyone with more info out there? I'm all ears.\n\nDick Bray \"Touch Of The West\" (Hyland Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nAn odd, somewhat forlorn album, with a smidge of \"western\" material, such as \"Ghost Riders In The Sky\" and the Marty Robbins chestnut, \"Big Iron,\" and an abundance of pop-folk stuff, tunes like \"Greenfields\" and \"It Was A Very Good Year.\" The album seems forlorn for a couple of reasons, first because of the barebones presentation -- just Dick Bray and one acoustic guitar -- mildly marred by flawed though not catastrophic recording quality, including a light background hum that's more noticeable on some tracks than on others. It's also forlorn, or perhaps a bit glum, given the unwavering solemnity of Bray's performance, which does not vary from track to track -- he's very serious about the project, but it's a bit downbeat, even on comedic numbers like \"The Persian Kitty.\" I'm not sure exactly when this album was made -- Bray was clearly trying to make a go of it in the coffeehouse folk scene, though he may have been a little late on the draw. He's pictured on the back cover looking half-beatnik/half-hippie with beard and mid-length hair... I'd guess early 'Seventies, but it's more likely it's a late 'Sixties set, maybe from '68 or thereabouts. One thing that falls into focus, though, is that the Hyland label was Bray's own imprint: he also released at least one 45 single on it as well these two albums. The label address on this album is for a place on Hyland Avenue, in Rapid City, South Dakota, which gives us one big clue about Bray's background...\n\nBrazil Country \"...Plays Something For Everyone!\" (Crown City Recording And Publishing Company, 1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Steve Szabo)\n\nOh, I had very high hopes for this one! I mean, just look at it: Brazil...? Country...? Oh baby! This was made for me! A closer inspection, though, revealed no twanged-up bossa nova songs, no samba renditions of Hank Williams oldies... Alas, the band was named for guitarist Tony Brazil, a Central California native whose band paired up country instruments such as pedal steel with trumpet and sax, a combination they applied to songs by Merle Haggard, Buddy Holly, and Bert Kaempfert, along with pop hits of the day such as \"Put Your Hand In The Hand\" and \"Tiny Bubbles,\" with the most recent song being Neil Diamond's \"Song Sung Blue,\" which was a hit in '72. According to the liner notes, the group won some kind of battle of the bands sponsored by radio station KLAC, Hollywood, and played gigs at venues such as the Squaw Valley ski resort... Anyway, this may not be the world-music twangfest I'd hoped for, but it's still an interesting souvenir of a Southern California county-fair covers band of yesteryear.\n\nJames Brolin \"...Sings\" (Artco Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tom Hartman & Jim Spence)\n\nYeesh. California-born actor James Brolin, father of Josh Thanos Brolin, was just hitting his stride as a '70s celebrity when he cut this country-oriented album. Split thematically between a \"City Side\" and a supposedly more rugged \"Country Side,\" this is, for the most part a pretty awful record. I mean, yeah, vocally he's vaguely in the same territory as Hoyt Axton, but his delivery is uniformly flat and monotonous, and a lot of the material sounds tired and uninvolving, despite contributions from writers such as Donnie Fritts, Red Lane, Troy Seals, and Tony Joe White. Side One -- the soft pop/countrypolitan side -- is just dreadful, although Side Two has some modest charms. There's a decent cover of Merle Haggard's \"If We Make Through December,\" and a barroom ballad called \"Bar Girl\" that's okay. These are balanced, however, by a couple of unctuous aw-gee, kids-are-cute duets with five-year-old Thanos chirping alongside his avuncular poppa -- on Shel Silverstein's nauseating \"Daddy What If\" (originally a hit for Conway Twitty and his daughter Joni) and \"Let's Go Fishing\" which, amazingly, is even worse. But if you ever want to embarrass Josh Brolin at a dinner party -- should the opportunity arise -- be sure to tuck a copy of this album under your arm and watch the look of horror spread across his face as you walk towards the stereo. Okay, okay... So, it was the countrypolitan era, and I suppose that given some of the real hits of the time, this album isn't really all that bad... but I wouldn't say you need to knock yourself out tracking a copy down.\n\nCarl Brouse \"American Hotel\" (DTI Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Craig Luckin & Carl Brouse)\n\nThis was the lone LP by songwriter Carl Brouse (1950-2002), a New Hampshire artist notable in part for his collaborations with alt-twang luminary Tom Russell, who co-wrote for songs on here, and later recorded his own version of the title track on one of his own albums. This record might appeal to fans of the younger Rodney Crowell, or early Marty Stuart -- Brouse had a similar rock-appreciative country style, pop-aware, but definitely twangy. Plus, his laconic Southern-inflected drawl sounds an awful lot like Rodney at various points in his career. Highlights include the honkytonk boozing anthem, \"These Bars (Have Made A Prisoner Out Of Me)\" and the title track, which is an homage to the great American composer Stephen Foster. Brouse moved to Austin at some point, San Francisco as well, and worked with a bunch of talented people. On this album alone, he's got folks like Shawn Colvin, Amos Garrett, Bonnie Hayes and Paul Davis (which explains some of the 'Seventies AOR vibe on a tune or two...) as well as Bobby Black on steel guitar... Brouse died young, apparently from complications of diabetes. This album is a fine legacy, though! As are the few singles he recorded as well...\n\nSue Brown \"Sings The Gospel\" (Chapel Tone Recordings, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Herb Kallman & Stan Anderson)\n\nOriginally from Dixon, California, in the Great Central Valley, Sue Brown started her career as a secular country singer, performing at local venues in northern and central California, and even hosted a television show in Sacramento. When her friend, gospel singer Polly Johnson died in a plane crash on May 7, 1964, Brown was deeply shaken and converted to a career as a gospel singer. She retained her rural roots, though, as heard on this fine album, recorded with The Christian Troubadours, a twangy band from Stockton that had a more-country sound than most gospel groups of the era. The opening notes of this album feature pedal steel and electric guitar, hinting at the more robust sound of West Coast country, and although the twang is mostly subdued, it's there. Brown had a fine voice, with clear country roots -- there are strong hints of Kitty Wells in her delivery, tempered by more modern influences such as Skeeter Davis and Patsy Cline. Students of country-gospel and southern gospel will find a lot to enjoy about this album, in particular the wealth of original material, including five songs composed by Chapel Tone owner Herb Kallman, another influential figure int he Central Valley gospel scene. One of these songs, \"Don't Turn Jesus Away,\" is also co-credited to Sue Brown. The repertoire also includes classics by Albert Brumley, Thomas A. Dorsey, Mylon LeFevre and Ira Stanphill's \"Mansion Over The Hill.\" Sue Brown (later Sue Brown Osbourn) performed tirelessly throughout the Valley, living in Lodi and Fresno, where she worked with legendary studio engineer Stan Anderson; later she retired to live in Henryetta, Oklahoma, where she continues to perform well into the 21st Century.\n\nSue Brown \"I've Been Changed\" (Chapel Tone Recordings, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Sue Brown & Herb Kallman)\n\nAnother understated but solidly country set from Sue Brown, with calm, pleasantly twangy backing by unnamed members of the Stockton-based Countrymen. Sue Brown's country gal vocals hit a nice balance between Kitty Wells' Depression-era nasality and the smoother, pop-friendly style of Skeeter Davis and other contemporary Nashville gals. As on her previous album, there's a bunch of original material, notably four songs from producer Herb Kallman. In addition to the Countrymen, Brown thanks several Fresno-based musicians -- Tom Force, Chuck Mambrini, Jim Shaw and Cubbie Slayton -- for backing her on three tracks. (Unfortunately she doesn't specify which tracks these were, but they were probably those that featured Jim Shaw on piano, including album closers \"He's Already Done What He Said He Would Do\" and Kallman's \"Jesus Is My Destiny.\") A heavy lineup of talent from the Central Valley/Bakersfield scene, playing t sweet and simple on this laid-back but deeply rural country gospel album.\n\nSue Brown \"Hold On To My Hand\" (Sound Of Ministry Recordings, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dale Hooper & Roy Ward)\n\nThis set was produced at Roy Ward's studio in Richmond, CA, just north of Berkeley and Oakland... The musicians include pedal steel player Jim Grey, John Moyers (keyboards), Paul Perryman (lead guitar), Dave Raffanelli (percussion), and John Schoger on bass. Not sure of the date, but it looks like a mid- to late-'Seventies kinda thing.\n\nJackson Browne \"Jackson Browne (Saturate Before Using)\" (Asylum Records, 1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jackson Browne & Richard Sanford Orshoff)\n\nYeah, I know... It's long been fashionable to mock and deride Jackson Browne as a wimp, a cheeseball, one of the ultimate '70s dino-rockers... And I'll concede that his earlier albums are, by and large somewhat lugubrious and overinflated -- there are songs on them that I like, but many more that are, frankly, way overwritten and insufferable. Nonetheless, he's firmly in the SoCal country-rock pantheon -- a protege of David Geffen and an early buddy of The Eagles, Browne was key to the development of the singer-songwriter/adult pop genre, and dipped into true twang from time to time... This debut album has a bunch of his best-known songs, including a few faves like \"Doctor My Eyes\" (guilty pleasure, though I'm pretty much over it) and \"Something Fine\" (which still holds up) and a bunch of songs that have always struck me as a bit too precious. Still, it's canonical and all.\n\nJackson Browne \"For Everyman\" (Asylum Records, 1973) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jackson Browne)\n\nOf his early albums, I'd recommend For Everyman the most, just 'cuz the songs are catchier and more overtly \"pop.\" Winners include his version of \"Take It Easy,\" \"These Days,\" and the jaunty novelty number, \"Red Neck Friend.\" And then there's the usual pretentious-poetic stuff. Musicians include Glenn Frey and Don Henley of the Eagles, Sneaky Pete on pedal steel, David Lindley on just about everything else, and a bunch of LA \"usual suspects,\" in one big SoCal rock-star lovefest. Some folks dig it, some folks don't.\n\nJackson Browne \"Late For The Sky\" (Asylum Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jackson Browne & Al Schmitt)\n\nNothing on here I really care about... A lot of poetic would-be profundity, etc., etc. Not my cup of tea.\n\nJackson Browne \"The Pretender\" (Asylum, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jackson Browne & Jon Landau)\n\nDitto with this one...\n\nJackson Browne \"Running On Empty\" (Elektra, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jackson Browne)\n\nA not-so-guilty pleasure. This album remains one of the best country-rock records ever made, and when measured up against most of the alt.country acts of the '80s and '90s, this is indeed a superior product. A concept album about driving the long, lonesome highway and touring in a rock'n'roll band, this disc is packed with winning songs. It had several hits: the title track, \"You Love The Thunder,\" his version of the doo-wop oldie, \"Stay,\" given a modern, sardonic twist in the context of the weird, mutually parasitic relationship between rock stars and their fans. There are also a slew of great, non-hit country tunes, like \"Nothin' But Time,\" \"Shaky Town,\" and \"The Road\" that stack up quite well against anything the cowpunk and insurgent-altie crowd has come up with. Browne's road songs are as self-involved and navel-gazey as other songs of the genre, but he seems to have a self-awareness, and a willingness to explore the ickiness of situation that is lacking in many similar compositions. The sexism of the opening verse \"Rosie\" -- a song about a groupie -- is tempered by a deft humanization of the objectified girl, and by Browne's remarkable willingness to portray himself and his fame in an unfavorable light, either as honest autobiography, or as an Almost Famous-style character sketch. At any rate, I think this is a fine album, well worth checking out and listening to without the hipster blinders on: you might be surprised by how good it really is.\n\nSeverin Browne \"Severin Browne\" (Motown Records, 1973) (LP)\n\nWell... While we're at it, might as well give a nod to Jackson's brother Severin, who cut a couple of albums in the early '70s in an unlikely matchup with the R&B powerhouse, Motown Records, which was trying to branch out at the time. You can kind of see it, though: there's a lightly funky undercurrent to many of Browne's songs, his soft-pop singer-songwriter tunes had a mild groove to them, ala Michael Franks. Although several country-rock stalwarts are on here backing him up -- Richard Bennett, Emory Gordy Jr. and Sneaky Pete Kleinow -- there are also cello and conga players to reckon with, and Browne's own gentle piano riffs. This disc is basically a straight-up soft-pop outing, not quite as slick as, say, Seals & Croft, but in that vicinity, so for most twangfans this might be a no-go. But soft-rock aficionados might really dig it.\n\nSeverin Browne \"New, Improved\" (Motown Records, 1974) (LP)\n\nTom Brumley \"Tom Cattin' \" (Steel Guitar Record Club, 1973-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tom Bradshaw & Don Jewell)\n\nOne of several musically inclined siblings, steel guitar legend Tom Brumley (1935-2009) was the son of country gospel star Albert E. Brumley and grew up playing in a family band with his brother Albert Junior, who followed in their father's footsteps and became a gospel performer as well. It was while backing his brother at a recording session in California that Tom Brumley was spotted by West Coast honkyonker Buck Owens, who soon recruited Brumley for his band. Brumley joined the Buckaroos in 1964 and it was a perfect match for the bouncy, melodic style meticulously crafted by Buck Owens and his bandleader, guitarist Don Rich. You'll instantly recognize Brumley's crisp, clean, decisive phrasing and bright, assertive tone. If there are great, old classic country songs where you hear that one short, perfect steel lick and think, \"oh, man!\" and wish for more, then this disc is for you. Brumley digs deeper into his melodies than the sideman role would normally allow, building up some pretty groovy, playful riffs, but he doesn't get all artsy and lofty about it, sticking close to the concise, poppy approach of the back-to-basics Bakersfield scene. It's good. Really good. Fun stuff!\n\nBrush Arbor - see artist discography\n\nBuck Owens' Bakersfield Brass \"Standin' On A Mountain Top\" (Capitol Records, 1970) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ken Nelson, Hugh Davies & Ed Flaherty)\n\nAn oddball early 'Seventies offering, with pop-orchestral renditions of a bunch of Bakersfield Sound classics, tunes like \"Act Naturally,\" \"Okie From Muskogee,\" \"My Heart Skips A Beat\" and \"I Take A Lot Of Pride In What I Am.\" The musicians aren't named, but one point of interest is the album's arranger/conductor, David Gates, described here as \"a son of Hollywood\" -- I thought it was the same David Gates who did a bunch of studio work in LA before breaking out as a 'Seventies superstar as a solo artist and as the leader of the band Bread, though now I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, if you're looking for the intersection between West Coast neo-trad hard country and squaresville easy listening, this one might be for you.\n\nThe Buckaroos - see artist discography\n\nBuckhorn \"Buckhorn\" (Bowman/Baby Grand Recording Co., 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by C. Marmont & L. Wilson)\n\nNo info online about this band, which was led by singer/guitarist Steve Sherman and recorded this album in Hollywood, California... Sherman was rocking the cowboy hat, but the band didn't include pedal steel or fiddle, so the twang factor might not be as high as some might like.\n\nBuffalo Nickel Jugband \"Buffalo Nickel Jugband\" (Happy Tiger Records, 1971) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tom Hartman & Dan Sciarotta)\n\nIt took me a few listens to warm to this one... It's a nice, standard-issue, retrodelic bluesy-jazzy jugband set with oldies such as \"Alabamy Bound,\" \"Separation Blues\" and \"Tain't What You Do\" alongside about a half-album's worth of similar sounding material written by various members of the band. This group was an amalgamation of longhaired pickers and plunkers drawn mostly from Tacoma, Washington and the greater Los Angeles area, recording for a short-lived indie label out of Hollywood, CA. Among the musicians was Denny Hall, who had connections to the Lydia Pinkham Orchestra, a SeaTac area band that migrated to LA, as well as Bob and Lester Broersma, Ben King, Russ Lewark, and Joel Tepp. The difficulty I had with this album was its tidiness, the overall sense of being a little too controlled or trying to sound professional and precise -- there's little of the madcap, kooky abandon of, say, the Bonzo Dog Band or even Jim Kweskin and his crew... Still, they obviously had their hearts in the right place, and after two or three spins, I got into it. If you enjoy hippie-era jugband revivalists, these guys are worth checking out.\n\nNorton Buffalo \"Lovin' In The Valley Of The Moon\" (Capitol Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Norton Buffalo, Mickey Hart & Steve Miller)\n\nRoots/blues harmonica player Norton Buffalo (aka Phillip Jackson, 1951-2009) was born in Oakland, California, and moved through several of the Bay Area's top groups before starting his own solo career. He played live gigs with Huey Newton's old band, Clover, and toured with Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, and ultimately with The Steve Miller Band, when they were at the height of their \"Fly Like An Eagle\" fame. Though he continued on with the Steve Miller Band for over three decades, Buffalo also pursued a solo career, including these first two country-tinged albums, which were recorded with help from Steve Miller, along with a slew of top West Coast talent, notably co-producer Mickey Hart, from the Dreadful Grate, who also played percussion on both albums. Other notable musicians included bassist John Ciambotti and John McFee from Clover (with McFee doing triple duty on guitar, pedal steel... and sitar!) as well as gospel singer Tramaine Hawkins, and her sister Lynette Hawkins, and a whole slew of other folks, mostly from the Bay Area and Northern California music scene. This album includes a lot of Buffalo's own original material, most notably (for twangfans) his version of the amped-up trucker tune, \"Eighteen Wheels,\" which had previously been recorded on Commander Cody's 1976 live album. As with his second album (below) this is an eclectic and ambitious album, laced with various strains of pop, folk and blues, and may not be what most country fans are looking for -- later on, Buffalo would focus primarily on blues music. For my money, this is the stronger of these two albums.\n\nNorton Buffalo \"Desert Horizon\" (Capitol Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Norton Buffalo, Jim Gaines, Mickey Hart & Steve Miller)\n\nAs on his first album, Norton Buffalo surrounded himself with a ton of West Coast/Bay Area talent, including many of the same musicians as before: Mickey Hart on percussion, John McFee (guitar, sitar and pedal steel), augmented by steel players Bobby Black and Fred Jones, as well as drummer Gary Mallaber and synth keyboardist Byron Allred (both from the Steve Miller Band) and a slew of others. Notable as backup singers are pop star Nicolette Larson and Bay Area pop-soul singer Bill Champlin, who led the ultra-hippie white-funk jam-band The Sons Of Champlin, and later became the lead singer for Chicago. To be honest, there's not much on this album that ever really resonated with me (or that I remembered from hearing it on the radio...) More of a pop-oriented album, I suppose, although Buffalo's approach was remarkably eclectic and not really geared towards the Top Forty. Amazing, really, that these early major label albums made it off the ground. As noted above, in years to come Norton Buffalo became more tightly focussed as a blues artist, notably collaborating with electric guitarist Roy Rogers on several albums. He was also a highly in-demand session player, and lauded as a harmonica virtuoso, including solos on records by folks such as The Doobie Brothers and Bonnie Raitt.\n\nNorton Buffalo \"Lovin' In The Valley Of The Moon/Desert Horizon\" (Edsel Records, 1995)\n\nA digital-era reissue of two Norton Buffalo's first two albums. This handy little disc might still be floating around out there somewhere...\n\nNorton Buffalo & George Kahumoku, Jr. \"From Paradise\" (Kealia Farms Records, 2012)\n\n(Produced by Brett Allen, Lawrence Bryant & Norton Buffalo)\n\nA posthumously-released album with Buffalo dipping into the ocean of Hawaiian popular music... He produces and plays harmonica, along with his wife, Lisa Flores-Buffalo on guitar and vocals, backing slack-key guitarists George Kahumoku, Jr., his son Keoki Kahumoku, Dennis Kamakahi and Jeff Peterson, as well as ukulele player Herb Ohta Jr. Not sure when this was recorded, though Norton Buffalo had passed away in 2009 following a short battle with a particularly aggressive form of cancer. The album title has a double meaning, encompassing both Hawaii (of course) and Buffalo's longtime home in Paradise, California, out in the gold country above Sacramento.\n\nShelley Burns \"Be For Me\" (Gold Country Music, 1985-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Charlie Peacock)\n\nAlthough she later evolved into a jazz singer, Sacramento, California's Shelley Burns cut this 6-song country EP back in the height of the big-hair '80s. All the songs were written or cowritten by pianist-producer Charlie Peacock, who went on to become a jazz musician himself, as well as a successful contemporary Christian songwriter and producer. Best of all, this is a pretty good little record, a little glossy and '80s-ish, but also rootsy enough to appeal to traditional country fans. Burns has a nice voice, the material is pretty strong, and the backing band plays with feeling and conviction... In addition to Peacock on piano, pedal steel player Marcus Welborn adds some sweet licks, as do Tom Phillips and Jim Beecker on guitar. Not classic, by any means, but surprisingly good. (Burns has also recorded a few albums of jazz-vocals material, which might be worth checking out as well...)\n\nBurrito Brothers, The Flying - see artist discography\n\nButterfield Stage Line \"Butterfield Stage Line\" (Crimson Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Henry M. Quinn & Maynard Smith)\n\nThis trio from Downey, California played a mix of oldies and twang, including a hefty dose of original material credited to all three musicians, Buddy Banks (drums), Maynard Smith (lead guitar), and Coy Williams on bass. They took their name from a historic though short-lived stagecoach line that ran on a southern route from Saint Louis to San Francisco (with stops in Los Angeles, of course...) between 1858-61. The trio also released several singles, also on the Crimson label; other than this handful of records, I couldn't find anything else out about these guys...\n\nRick Byars \"Fallin' In Love Everyday\" (Merrell Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rick Byars, Eddie B. Barlow & Warren Dennis)\n\nArchetypal Northern California/Bay Area folkie stuff, from a singer-guitarist who was in Kate Wolf's original backing band, Wildwood Flower, and performed on her second and third albums. An able accompanist, Byars also was a prolific songwriter, penning all but one of the songs on this disc, and also played in a Sonoma County trio called Lazy Bones, along with dobro player Eddie B. Barlow and guitarist Peter Brooks, who formed the core of the group on this album. Although there's a hint of Byars' twangier Texas country roots, the music quickly settles into the gentle, pastoral poetics known to Wolf's ardent fans. She sings harmony on four songs, including way in the background as a member of the \"Stanislaus Chorus\"; also noteworthy is the lead guitar and mandolin picking of Nina Gerber, another stalwart of the Wildwood Flower ensemble, who plays on several tracks. Overall, this is pretty gooey, dewy, touchie-feelie stuff: if you like the Kate Wolf sound, you ought to dig this as well.\n\nThe Byrds \"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\" (Columbia Records, 1968)\n\n(Produced by Gary Usher)\n\nThe Byrds \"Sweetheart Of The Rodeo\" (Columbia Records, 1968)\n\n(Produced by Gary Usher)\n\nOften referred to as the first \"official\" country-rock album, though there are other claimants to the throne... Really, it was simply a masterful country album, recorded by a super-famous rock band. As the story goes, stonerbilly bad boy Gram Parsons more or less muscled his way into LA's then-ascendant folk-rock band, and swiftly remade them into Nudie suit-wearing space cowboy, hippie-billies... which is to say, into his band. Naturally, there was resentment within the group, and Parsons was eventually given the boot, but not before they made this wonderful, landmark album. Gram provided most of the arrangements and repertoire, including his own classic ballad, \"Hickory Wind,\" as well as oldies such as the Louvin's \"Christian Life.\" Because he was under contract to another label, though, the producers at Columbia stripped Parsons' vocal tracks off the album, and replaced them with lead vocals by Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman. Recent CD reissues have gone back and (partially) re-created the album as it was originally recorded.\n\nThe Byrds \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" (Columbia Records, 1969)\n\n(Produced by Bob Johnson)\n\nThe Byrds \"Ballad Of Easy Rider\" (Columbia Records, 1969)\n\n(Produced by Terry Melcher)\n\nThe Cache Valley Drifters \"The Cache Valley Drifters\" (Flying Fish Records, 1978) (LP)\n\nThis popular California bluegrass band mixed modern folk songs from the likes of Kate Wolf with 'grassed-up versions of old country tunes and Tin Pan Alley standards. Mandolinist Bill Griffin was a member of Kate Wolf's band, while the other members were in a variety of off-the-radar groups before joining to form the Drifters. On ther debut, they covered John Prine's \"Angel From Montgomery\" and Bob Wills' \"Roly Poly\" alongside Bob Marley's \"I Shot The Sherriff\" and the folk standard \"Columbus Stockade.\" A fine example of the eclectic spirit of yesteryear.\n\nThe Cache Valley Drifters \"Step Up To Big Pay\" (Flying Fish Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tom Diamant)\n\nAnother fun set, with some sweet, melodic picking and a light touch that's nice to hear, even as they deliver some dazzling licks. The repertoire is the real key here, with songs drawn from sources such as Benny Goodman and Louis Jordan from the big band era, folkies like Gordon Bok and John Prine, as well as Tom Lehrer's cowboy satire, \"The Wild West Is Where I Long To Be,\" and a twangy version of the Grateful Dead's \"Cumberland Blues,\" which later made it onto a compilation album of Dead cover songs. A nice album, very reflective of the mellow, eclectic sensibilities of Northern California's folk scene.\n\nThe Cache Valley Drifters \"Tools Of The Trade\" (Flying Fish Records, 1983) (LP)\n\nThe Cache Valley Drifters \"White Room\" (CMH Records Records, 1996)\n\nThe Cache Valley Drifters \"Mightyfine.net\" (Taxim Records, 1999)\n\nThe Caffrey Family \"Country Thoughts\" (Century Productions, 1975) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Ligotino & Bob Miller)\n\nLed by guitar picker Tom Caffrey, this family group was a mainstay of the San Francisco Bay Area bluegrass scene for many years, first forming in the late 1960s and performing at numerous venues throughout the early and mid-'Seventies. The Caffreys were charter members of the California Bluegrass Association and played at the CBA's first concert back in '75, around the time they recorded this album, a pleasantly understated acoustic set mixing country and old-timey covers. They seem to have moved to the Delta town of Benicia in the early '80s, with Tom Caffrey playing dobro for a local band called the J Street String Band in 1984. I'm not sure how long this family band stayed together, or if they recorded anything else, but they were a fun, earnest group, and sound great on this disc. (Thanks to radio deejay Peter Thompson's venerable Bluegrass Signal for filling in a bunch of gaps about this band: check out his amazing timeline of the Bay Area bluegrass scene!)\n\nBuddy Cagle \"The Way You Like It\" (Imperial Records, 1966) (LP)\n\nA West Coast country back-bencher, North Carolina-born Buddy Cagle moved out to California in the late 'Fifties and worked in the orbit of the 1960's Bakersfield scene. Cagle landed a couple of major label deals and scraped his way into the Top Forty a few times before sliding into the lower rungs of the charts and basically retired from music by the end of the 'Sixties. He cut a few early singles and a handful of albums, then called it quits, pulling one of the great disappearing acts in country music history.\n\nBuddy Cagle \"Mi Casa, Tu Casa\" (Imperial Records, 1967) (LP)\n\nBuddy Cagle \"Longtime Traveling\" (Imperial Records, 1968) (LP)\n\nBuddy Cagle \"Through A Crack In A Boxcar Door\" (Imperial Records, 1968) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Scott Turner)\n\nThis was Buddy Cagle's last album, although he did record a few more singles before hanging it up in the early '70s. It's a pretty soft set, a \"traveling hobo\"-themed folk-country set, the sort of stuff that young Bobby Bare struggled mightily to free himself from, but similar to a lot of the Nashville Sound crooning of the time... Indeed, on Side Two, Cagle sounds a lot like '60s-era Hank Snow, both in his choice of repertoire and in his vocal intonations. Not a very exciting record, but it stands up fine next to albums by big stars of the time.\n\nJeffrey Cain \"For You\" (Warner Brothers, 1970) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rick Turner & Stuart Kutchins)\n\nThis is a little more folkie and maybe too hippie-dippy for our purposes here, but I gotta give this album a shout-out since the backing band is basically the Youngbloods -- Joe Bauer, Lowell \"Banana\" Levenger and Jesse Colin Young -- accompanying Marin County songwriter Jeffrey Cain, who plays guitar throughout. Now, don't get me wrong: I think this is actually a pretty cool record, particularly for those of you who are into the whole \"freak folk\" thing. On many tracks, Cain croons and noodles around in a spacey, Banhart-ian fashion, maybe a little Tim Hardin-y in his more cohesive moments. On a couple of the more overtly goofy tracks, he even sounds a little like John Prine, and of course he recalls Jesse Colin Young on a tune or two. This is an amazingly un-commercial album -- I'm sure Warner Brothers wasn't kidding when they placed a track on their \"Loss Leaders\" promo record -- and if you like hardcore, stonerdelic hippie music, this is the real deal. I dunno what they were smoking out in Point Reyes back in 1970, but you can definitely catch a little whiff of it here.\n\nJeffrey Cain \"Whispering Thunder\" (Warner Brothers/Raccoon Records, 1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jesse Colin Young)\n\nCalcote Cousin Clan \"Honey Come Back\" (Crown Records, 1970) (LP)\n\nPresumably this was a side-project of singer/producer Gordon Calcote (below), who worked up and down the Pacific Coast and recorded several earlier albums for the Custom (and Crown) cheapie label empire. As with so many of the records, the specific details are scant and hard to come by -- i.e., what musicians were involved and whatnot.\n\nGordon Calcote \"Going Home For The Last Time\" (Custom Records, 1967-?) (LP)\n\nSinger Gordon Calcote was one of the rare cheapie label artists who got proper credits on the budget-line albums he recorded... Like many country singers in the days of yore, Calcote had a day job in radio, at first as a deejay on stations such as KAYO-AM in Seattle (where he was on air in the early '60s) and later as a program director and station manager various stations in Southern California, where he was probably working when he started recording for the Custom label. And the thing is, he was also a pretty good singer - rugged, robust, but also working in the suave, sophisticated style being pioneered by Glen Campbell at the time. A good mix of manly honky-tonk and the nascent countrypolitan sound that was starting to come into vogue... and all on an under-the-radar, fly-by-night label. Definitely worth a spin!\n\nGordon Calcote \"Folsom Prison Blues\" (Custom Records, 1968-?) (LP)\n\nGordon Calcote \"Galveston And Other Pop Country & Western Favorites\" (Crown Records, 1969-?) (LP)\n\nThe California Band \"California\" (MCF Records, 19--?) (EP)\n\nThis six-song EP featured contributions from Bruce Crosby and Lisa Iskin, with pedal steel guru Joe Goldmark playing on one track, \"First Waltz.\"\n\nCalifornia Champs \"1974: Country Western\" (Trac Records, 1974) (LP)\n\nA swell all-instrumental set from three talented old-timers from California's Central Valley. Fiddlers Coy Daily and Vern Keathly are joined by rhythm guitarist Nellie O'Neal for a nice set of antebellum oldies, Irish and Appalachian tunes and country covers. Then calling themselves Coy's Group, the informal trio competed in -- and won -- the music competition at the 1974 Auburn State Fair, giving them the impetus to record this album on the Fresno-based Trac label. Coy Daily was probably the most experienced musician in the band -- born in Oklahoma, he came out West in 1940 and played professionally in some western swing bands before settling down in Salida, California, near Modesto. His son Ron plays bass on this record and on another Trac Records disc credited to Coy Daily alone. Other local musicians chipping in are steel player Ivan Ward, Don Hyland (also spelled Heiland) on piano and a nice lead guitarist, Vern Baughman. Sweet stuff!\n\nCalifornia Cowboys & Co. \"The Colorful California Cowboys & Co.\" (American Heritage Music Corporation, 1974-?) (LP)\n\nThough they seem to have been a struggling pizza parlor/fraternal club band, The California Cowboys nonetheless included several original songs into their covers-heavy repertoire. The band featured a trio of brothers -- David, Scott and Steve Preston, as well as Denise Preston, the wife of nineteen-year old Scott -- and was rounded out by a second \"gal\" singer, Donna Lynn Smith, who also played fiddle and wrote three of the songs on this album, \"She Loves Me More,\" \"Tomboy\" and \"Pretty Girl Hoedown.\" There's also a slew of covers, from a diverse range of sources, including some Hank Williams, a cover of \"Phoenix,\" Tom T. Hall's \"Ravishing Ruby,\" the Webb Pierce classic \"I Ain't Never,\" and Terry Stafford's \"Amarillo By Morning\" which was later a big hit for George Strait, but was kind of a hip pick in the mid-1970s. Lead guitarist Steve Preston also offered an instrumental number, \"Helmet Stomp.\" Unfortunately, the album neglects to tell us where the band was actually from, though they had a long-term gig playing a Nevada casino at the time of this album.\n\nCalifornia Express & Tex Williams \"Tex Williams & California Express\" (Garu Records, 1981) (LP)\n\nYup, sure enough, it's that Tex Williams, a hilllbilly-era star in his twilight years, playing a bunch of classics and oldies, on what may have been his last album. The backing band were a bunch of shaggy 'Seventies longhairs, including his daughters Jenny and Sandi Williams, as well as Sam Aiello, who I believe was his son-in-law (married to Sandi). I'm not sure if California Express was primarily Williams' band, or if they had a career of their own -- at some point former child actor and roller derby queen Tammy Locke sang with the group -- the rest of the band included Russ and Dennis Orr, and Michael Reid. I think this may have been their only album, and I believe it was Tex"
