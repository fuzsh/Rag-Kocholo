        "text": "Label: Sepia Records\n\nYear: 1954\n\nReleased on LP: Yes\n\nReleased on CD: Yes\n\nTracks\n\nCamille\n\nPersonnel\n\nDave Brubeck (piano)\n\nPaul Desmond (alto sax)\n\nJoe Dodge (drums)\n\nNorman Bates (bass)\n\nNotes\n\nIn 1954 Columbia recorded two performances of stars gathered at the homes of Jo Stafford / Paul Weston and Mitch Miller. In the majority, the tunes recorded were never made available on other recordings.\n\nColumbia had produced several new LPs in 1955; part of their sales promotion was to give buyers of units valued at $100 or more the Columbia House Party album, which was not available any other way. One side of the album featured the party with celebrities at the Weston's California home, while the other featured Mitch Miller's New York City party.\n\nPerformers at the California gathering at which the Dave Brubeck Quartet performed were Jo Stafford & Paul Weston, Frankie Laine, The Norman Luboff Choir and Jo Stafford.\n\nIn 2006 Sepia Records issued the 1st side of the LP, the California gathering on a Jo Stafford compilation CD. Jo Stafford did not perform on \"Camille\".\n\nSome Dave Brubeck collectors suggest that the\n\nversion of \"Camille\" is actually just the solos from Sometimes Im Happy from the Red Hot and Cool album.\n\nBack to recordings"
