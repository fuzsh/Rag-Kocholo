        "text": "Description\n\nVery few singers of the 20th Century achieved the popularity and respect of Jo Stafford. A highly-diversified musician whose repertoire included American standards, folk music, sacred works, jazz, blues, novelty material, seasonal songs, and comedy. Her recordings continue to be readily sought by her many fans and 'Reflections' is one of Stafford's most comprehensive collections focusing on her output from the 1950s!\n\nIncludes all her million-sellers of that period: \"Shrimp Boats\", \"Make Love to Me\", \"It Is No Secret\", \"Jambalaya\", \"You Belong to Me\", \"Whispering Hope\", \"Keep It a Secret\", \"Hey, Good Lookin'\" and more! Features her classic duets with Gordon MacRae, Gene Autry, Nelson Eddy, Johnny Mercer and her album with Frankie Laine, \"A Musical Portrait of New Orleans\" appears in it's entirety along with her classic albums \"American Folk Songs\", \"Songs of Faith\" and \"Garden of Prayer\". The great Paul Weston arranged and conducted the majority of the sessions, with many tracks featuring the celebrated Norman Luboff Choir. Wonderfully remastered and includes detailed liner notes."
