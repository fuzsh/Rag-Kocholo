        "text": "The Peggy Lee Bio-Discography:\n\nThe Polydor Contract (1977)\n\nby Iván Santiago\n\nPRELIMINARY NOTES\n\nThe Peggy Lee Look\n\nThe photography on this page's opening section showcases the way that Peggy Lee looked in 1976 and 1977, the latter being the year of her fourth and most productive trip to the United Kingdom. Indeed, the third of these images was probably taken at the Teddington Studios in London, during an interview for Thames Television, conducted in March 1977. Also a screenshot from a televised interview/performance, the first image takes us back to the United States one year earlier, when the show Good Morning America caught Lee during rehearsals at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel (October 15, 1976). As for the central image above, specifics are not available to me. But there is a fair chance that the plane inside which Lee is seen was taking to or back from London, in 1977.\n\nBelow we can see two album session pictures, each from one of the albums that Peggy Lee recorded in 1977. The first is an alternate picture from the Polydor Live In London photo shot, the second from the Polydor album Peggy photo shot. Unlike the albums, however, none of these shots truly date from 1977 -- nor did they happen in London. The exact year is probably 1975, with 1974 as a secondary possibility for the Peggy shots, and 1976 a secondary possibility for the Live In London shots. The dog in sight is one of Lee's beloved pets, Sungi La.\n\nPeggy Lee's Recording Career, 1977\n\nJoining forces with Ken Barnes, Peggy Lee recorded on the Polydor label while visiting the British producer's native land in 1977. This \"British-Polydorian\" sojourn became the third of Lee's post-Capitol contracts. It generated two albums, one done in the studio and the other recorded in concert. Additional material from this Lee-Barnes partnership included professionally recorded rehearsals and one more concert, which is listed below. (Such material -- i.e., rehearsals + concert -- does not belong to Polydor. Instead, it is co-owned by Ken Barnes Productions and Peggy Lee's estate. For further details, see the notes under each of the sessions below.) A total of 46 masters are listed herein, plus 6 entries classified as either alternate takes or professionally recorded rehearsal performances. The bulk of the material (34 entries) is comprised of the aforementioned concert performances, including one which is a medley of several songs. Finally, here is a note for viewers in search of recommended issues: your best option is the 2015 Polydor set Peggy Lee Live In London, which includes most of this material, including even some of the rehearsal numbers.\n\nPeggy Lee With Ken Barnes At Polydor Records\n\nBritish filmmaker and music producer Ken Barnes was responsible for bringing legendary acts such as Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby, and Johnny Mercer to the United Kingdom, and for having them record albums in their late, senior years. Peggy Lee herself was assiduously courted by Barnes. \"I have been to Hollywood 12 or 14 times in the past two years,\" he told Reginald Brace, of the Yorkshire Post, in 1977. \"Each time I phoned Peggy about making an album, but she was always recording with someone else like Paul McCartney or Leiber and Stoller. She always said, Don’t forget to call next time you come over. One day I phoned and she was ready to listen. It was persistence on my part.\" Barnes made Lee's European traveling very worthwhile. He negotiated concert appearances in various cities (including London and Amsterdam), along with a television special and, as illustrated through this page, a two-record deal with Polydor Records. \"We got on famously,\" Lee told Melody Maker's Max Jones at a party thrown by Polydor in her honor. \"Ken and Pete [Moore] and Steve the engineer, well, everyone there has been absolutely marvelous to me. I’m so happy.\" Added Barnes: \"It took [me] long to get her away from Beverly Hills and over to London, but it’s been worth it.\"\n\nPhotos\n\nAbove: Peggy Lee flanked by arranger Pete Moore on her right and producer Ken Barnes on her left, at the CBS Studios in London. They are in the process of singing and dubbing her own background vocals, most likely for the song \"Here. Now,\" on March 18, 1977. Below: Miss Lee caught in the act twice at the Drury Lane, first on September 15 of 1976, then on October 4 of 1977. The Drury Lane in question is not London's Theatre Royal but the theater that was once located in Chicago's Water Tower Place. Lee was among the first acts to play at this original, opulent incarnation of Chicago's Drury Lane, which remained in place for just eight years (1976-1983). \"Everything Must Change\" and \"Make Believe\" were among the songs which she performed at the Drury Lane in 1976 and took to the London Palladium in 1977.\n\nSessions Reported: 5\n\nPerformances Reported: 59\n\nUnique Songs Reported: 32\n\nUnique Issues Reported: 16"
