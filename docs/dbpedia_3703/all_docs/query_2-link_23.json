        "text": "This is one of my all time favorite albums. The performances of Shenandoah and Black Is The Color are so hauntingly beautiful that no words can do them justice. It is a wonderful early 60s Capitol recording and the CD issued by Corinthian sounds unfutzed with. I wonder if Steve has heard it because I'd love to know his thoughts.\n\nAn interesting thing about this album is that there are two versions. There was a 10\" LP issued around 1950 or so. To my knowledge, none of these have been issued on official cd from Capitol or Corinthian. Though some have turned up on compilations from Jasmine and JSP. Here are two selections from the 1950 album, courtesy of a beat up 78 on youtube.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kmWV0dm-ug\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcRKAXBP1PQ\n\nAround 1962, she rerecorded this album in stereo with an expanded/updated song selection. Here is Shenandoah: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj1iEi8yWyw\n\nWish I could find two recordings of the same song for comparison's sake, but no such luck. It's interesting that the Wikipedia entry makes no distinction between the two. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Folk_Songs\n\nForgive my ignorance, but can anyone tell me what the 1950 versions would have been recorded on? I'm guessing it wasn't tape.\n\nAre there other examples of an artist rerecording an entire album in stereo that was originally recorded in mono?\n\nIs there a chance in hell that Steve could remaster the 1962 album and include the 1950 recordings as bonus tracks? I can dream, can't I?\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, June Christy's Something Cool was originally recorded and issued in mono, became quite popular over time, and was subsequently re-recorded (and expanded slightly?) for stereo release some years later.\n\nCapitol gave June the royal treatment, as it were, back in 2001 when they issued Something Cool: The Complete Mono And Stereo Versions back to back on one CD.\n\nAll said, I love me some Jo Stafford. And I'm totally gone for June, too!\n\nThe 1950 date is somewhat misleading since the original album on 78 rpm came out in 1948 and was undoubtedly recorded to disc not tape. There were six sides on the original 78. The song I Wonder As I Wander must have been added to the 10 inch LP in 1950, but I don't know the year it was recorded.\n\nJo Stafford, like many singers, is at her very best singing a fine song with a beautiful melody and either a simple arrangement or orchestration. All those novelty songs, in my opinion, waste that talent - though they certainly did sell more. I'll leave the Darlene material in a separate \"entertainment\" category. It is too bad that there is not a definitive complete edition. I have never figured out whether all of the many CD compilations, all put together, cover all of her 78 and 45 singles. The LPs, at least, are easier to pull together.\n\nJust after I revived a little Jo Stafford discussion. here comes a new 4CD compilation I have not studied yet whether this one has many or any tracks not already on one of the many CD compilations. Can anyone else analyze this? I just wish some company would do all the 78s from beginning to end to settle this.\n\nThis may be very good, nonetheless!\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Jo-Stafford-Collection-1939-1962/dp/B017MSKX3Q"
