        "text": "The English landscape in art, as in real life, is contentious, open to interpretations, with the term Picturesque being a visual recycling and improving of the landscape for consumption by various audiences. Ironically a term prevalent in late 18th century Britain as a mediator between Burke’s ideas of the sublime and beautiful, it depended on the roughness and ruin of a certain pictorial view inducing a sentimental and nostalgic response in the viewer of the painted and graphic representation. I use a photo-real style of painting as an attempt to avoid certain manners in painting that tend to deflect aesthetically from perhaps unpalatable truths about situations behind the image and subject matter: the paintings are rooted in the day to day exigencies and tussle of painting. In his essay for the 1983 Arts Council exhibition Landscape in Britain 1850 – 1950 Ian Jeffrey points out that painters, watercolourists and etchers were more upholders of tradition, worried about not losing their audience and buyers, by holding back from ‘satire and parody and pandemonium’ whilst writers of the times did not. Ruskin uses the phrase ‘heartless’ picturesque, of making a virtue of the observation of poor or low subject matter which ‘adds questions concerning the truth of imitation that are at the heart of the Western tradition’. This may be more about taste and sensibility of the observer and social and political predilections of the times, of the required response of sentimentality and nostalgia for the ruined and lost in the face of improvement. The Tate Britain exhibition a couple of years ago, British Landscape: Photography After the Picturesque presented a counterpoint to its Romantic exhibition at the time, a Post-Picturesque as Nicholas Alfrey put it. This may be recognition of the content on display; the signs of economic tension and decline, the ubiquitous use of the mundane landscape as subject matter, or perhaps a disinterested academic fixation on so called ‘non spaces’. My picturesque destabilises through ‘surprise and humour, friction rather than rapprochement’ (Robert Smithson 1973) by conflations of site specific views and their actualities, contradiction of tradition with progress. Modernity, loss and change is expressed through the playful ‘bubbleworlds’ of miniature diorama (why go hunting for views when I can make my own). These ‘landscapes’ are then painted in a Photoreal manner. This may smack of the Ruskinian ‘heartless’ picturesque, but I would argue that the Picturesque is, and has always been, more about the dialectical nature of landscape , my paintings continue and expand this discussion through visual language. I refer to Robert Smithson’s essay Frederick Law Olmsted and the Dialectical Landscape in Artforum 11, Feb1973, cited in Robert Smithson and the Anglo-American Picturesque Martin, Timothy D 2011, also Cosgrove, Denis Modernity, Community and the Landscape Idea UCLA.\n\n“Utopia originally meant ‘Nowhere’ but it is widely used to mean ‘ideals’. The purpose of Utopia is not just to escape to a place of fiction but to think about painful realities.” My works depict fictional landscapes which have never existed. However, the works were started with the aim of facing reality. I would like to examine my artwork, “Landscape as Utopia” To examine this assumption, I would like to analyze artists’ works which are related to the themes of ‘landscape’ and ‘fiction’. This study will be based on artworks by Korean artists. According to the French artist, Natacha Nisic, “Landscape can never be naive.” For Nisic, landscape always reflects the desires of humans. The desires of humans also reveal the social context that these desires came from. Yet, what if landscapes were combined with fiction? For me, utopian landscapes clearly reveal our desires; more so than landscapes that aim to depict reality. In section 1, I will look at the history and tradition of landscape painting to see how landscapes reflect human desire and the social contexts of different places and times. I will focus on the works of Jeong Seon and folding screen paintings from the Joseon dynasty. In Section 2, I will examine work produced by Korean contemporary artists such as Lee Bul, Lee Sea Hyun and Kwon Hayoun in order to investigate how social and political contexts in South Korea are uniquely represented in their art works. They depict utopian landscapes which show an ideological history and the disappearance of nature in Korea. They also reveal at the same time how far our utopian worlds are from the reality of contemporary Korean society. Lastly, I would like to introduce my work by explaining the process of production and examining the motivations and contexts that underlie my work. I will unveil how utopian landscapes are affected by society and how utopian landscapes today can also affect society. In doing so, I hope to find new meaning in my own artworks as forms of utopian landscape and in relation to society today.\n\nFrederic Leighton is mostly recognised as President of the Royal Academy in the latter half of the nineteenth century, exhibiting large scale figurative paintings of a high degree of finish. Scholarship has, however, overlooked his plein-air paintings created during frequent voyages to Italy, Spain, Egypt and Greece, to name a few. As Leighton’s oil sketches comprised over 200 canvases and boards, their significance to his oeuvre is paramount and needs to be clearly articulated. Using the example of 'An Outcrop in the Campagna', this article explores how the three aspects – nature, science and myth – merged in Leighton’s vision of landscape. The painting’s composition and technique are examined, as well as the influence of Leighton’s circle, exemplified by Giovanni Costa and the Etruscan School of Art. Finally, Victorian solar physics and thermodynamics are presented as an important context for the symbolic dimension of Leighton’s landscapes."
