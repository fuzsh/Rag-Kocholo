        "text": "<strong>CLUCK</strong> <strong>OLD</strong> <strong>HEN</strong> A <strong>Barnyard</strong> <strong>Serenade</strong> <strong>1926</strong>-1940 Old Hat CD - OHCD1009 Riley Puckett, Earl McDonald’s Original Louisville Jug Band, Cliff Carlisle, Beale Street Sheiks, Dixieland Jug Blowers, Utica Institute Jubilee Singers, Gene Autry, Sweet Papa Stovepipe, Six Jumping Jacks, Binkley Brothers Dixie Clodhoppers & more. Old Hat as a label can hardly be deemed as prolific, averaging as they do less than one new release a year. When they do come up with a new CD you know you are onto a winner, and this is no exception. Recent CDs have tended to follow a particular theme, last year’s Barbeque Any Old Time being a particular favourite of mine and many <strong>Red</strong> <strong>Lick</strong> customers who bought it by the bucket-load (very nearly a play on words here!). This time up the theme is America’s favourite domestic fowl, the chicken. Or, as detailed in the impressive booklet that comes with the CD, ‘two dozen musical selections comprising breakdowns, and frolics, folk songs and blues, parodies and imitations, double-entendres, jubilees, minstrel sketches and tunes of Tin Pan Alley’. This succinct but accurate summary of the contents means I don’t have too waste much time explaining what it includes and can instead focus on extolling the virtues of the music. So, let me extol awhile.... One of the first sides that had me rushing to the repeat button on first hearing is Harry Reser’s Six Jumping Jacks There’s A Trick In Pickin’ A Chick- Chick Chicken, a droll novelty number that is sung in front of a magnificent hot jazz band that the flappers and the dandies would have gone a bomb on when it was recorded in 1927. The spare finger picking (or, in this context, plucking) of Gene Autry on Stay Away From My Chicken House is also a delight in which potential adversaries are advised that any messing with his chicken house (double-entendre alert) will result in them being cut up Mexican-style (not sure what exactly this means but it can’t be healthy). Another highlight is the Dixieland Jug Blowers Hen Party Blues track which magnificently incorporates the great sounds of renowned New Orleans jazz clarinettist, Johnny Dodds, into a jug based feast. And anything with Frank Stokes has to be a winner and here he appears with Dan Sane as the Beale Street Sheiks on Chicken You Can Roost Behind The Moon. I’d love to go on because I’ve still got plenty of extolling left in me on this one. But space and time is against. Suffice to say, it’s another massively enjoyable set. Ask for OHCD1009 - on offer at a special price of only £13.45 plus p&p if bought before 22 February DROP ON DOWN IN FLORIDA Field Recordings Of African-American Traditional Music 1977-1980 Dust-To-Digital 2CD & Book - DTD24 Robert Dennis, Richard Williams, Ella Mae Wilson, Willie Gillard, Emmett Murray, Moses Williams, Johnny Brown, Testerina Primitive Baptist Church, Miccosukee Church Of God Of Prophecy, Florida- Alabama Progressive Seven-Shape-Note Singing Convention, Southeast Alabama And Florida Union Sacred Harp Singing Convention A stupendous release from another of the labels you can rely on for top quality releases. What they have done here is to take an obscure 1981 LP consisting of contemporary (at the time) field recordings of blues and gospel performers and transferred it to CD, increasing the number of tracks available to a total of 63 (eminently achievable in the CD era but not really possible to do when we only had LPs). All of this music is wrapped up in a stunning high quality hardback book of more than 200 pages incorporating the original albums liner notes and inclusions but also featuring new essays from blues scholars, detailed profiles on the artists and the tracks and loads of great photographs. The book is fantastically impressive, the music on the CDs more so. Few of the artists seemed to be concerned with the intrusion of the microphone so you get a real sense of country blues as it was played in the homes for friends and family and gospel as it was sung by the choirs in the churches. A rare treat indeed, and not often to be found on recordings made when the musicians knew the tapes were rolling. Of the musicians that were more obviously recording for posterit y , t here seems to be greater level of seriousness involved in fulfilling a complete performance, and some of these are nothing short of tremendous. Emmett Murray’s plugged in back porch tracks are truly memorable and Johnny Brown’s tracks are reminiscent of the best religious songs of Mississippi Fred McDowell. And if you like to hear Baptist Church choirs and Singing Conventions at their most fervent , this is the place to climb aboard. Overall, this is already a candidate for the ‘Best of 2013’ listing and it is only January! I’m just not sure if it will be entered for the Best Book Award (viewing the CDs as a super bonus) or the Best CD Award (taking the view that the book comes as a ridiculously splendid extra to the music). This early in the year, such niceties don’t matter. It simply is just a stunning collection that anyone with an interest in blues and gospel should find a place for in their home. Ask for DTD24 - on offer at a special review price of only £28.50 plus £3.00 UK p&p if bought before 22 February HERE COMES THE HURT Soul Ballads From King, Federal & DeLuxe Kent CD - CDKEND383 Hank Ballard, Charles Spurling, Christine Kittrell, Bobby Wade, Lee Holland, The King Pins, Earl Gaines, Toni Williams, Marva Whitney, Lynn Davis, The Bobbettes, Thomas Bailey & more. It is staggering to recently discover fact that Ace has been releasing CDs of superior southern and northern soul for thirty years now. It would seem inevitable that after such a long and intensive period of regular monthly releases that, while the well may not have been completely drained dry, the quality of what was found and made available must go down. But no, we can happily report here that there are absolutely no sounds herein that are suggestive of barrel bottoms being scraped. Instead, here we are yet again with another top-notch collection of newly mined sides from the King vaults which are rightly described in the accompanying (and as always excellent booklet) as ‘bounteous’. Indeed, this collection could easily stand to be tested against any previous release and not be found wanting. It really is that good! This collection is effectively another instalment in the superb ‘King’s Serious Soul’ series, following up Volume One - Too Much Pain (ask for CDKEND194) and Volume Two - Counting Teardrops (ask for CDKEND206). With a slightly broader scope, now not being limited only to the inclusion of southern soul, this provides 24 amazingly good soul ballads to weep along to, or at least nod along to appreciatively if not feeling particularly blue. Every single one of these selections is, in one way or another, excellent and it seems a little churlish to select any particular highlights. As Churlish is my middle name however, here are just a few. Christine Kittrell’s Ain’t Never Seen So Much Rain Before is a revelation. Not only is it such a marvellous song, but her voice is stupendous, carrying with it the fragility of Billie Holiday, the poise of Ella Fitzgerald and the spark of Etta James. An amazing performance but, sadly, as the brief profile provided in the booklet states, this 1965 recording was to prove her last. Bobby Wade’s lung-bursting version of Blind Over You sounds fantastic over the more controlled backing singers and superb production sound, while The King Pins How Long Will It Last is one of many great songs in this set, delivered by a great gospel-soaked voice enhanced by an excellent rumbling guitar support. The singing on Fall Into These Arms Of Mine by Johnny Soul is clearly heavily influenced by Otis <strong>Red</strong>ding but is none the worse for the intended (or otherwise) homage. And similarly, Why by James Duncan has an excellent gospel-impassioned vocal delivery that even O.V. Wright would have been proud of. We could go on indefinitely here but I will wrap up by simply stating that whether you like your soul vocalists with a creamy falsetto, a rasping growl, or something in between, this collection is just simply a must-have.
