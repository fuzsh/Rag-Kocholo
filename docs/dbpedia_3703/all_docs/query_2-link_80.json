        "meta_description": "Spend an entire Holiday Season listening to one of America's classic female vocalists sing you all the way from Thanksgiving through Christmas, and on to Valentines' Day.This is a brand new Corinthian release featuring a combination of tracks from Jo's two great Columbia recordings: \"Happy Holidays\" from 1955 and the long awaited CD issue of \"Ski Trails\" from 1956.The tracks have been digitally re-mastered from the original master tapes and re-sequenced to provide an entirely new listening experience.All tracks feature arrangements and orchestra under the direction of Paul Weston, plus some fantastic group singing courtesy of Jo's companions from the `50's: The Starlighters.As Johnny Mercer assembled the artists to start Capitol Records in 1943, Jo Stafford began a recording career that was to culminate in Columbia Records giving her a Diamond Award as the first recording artist to sell 25,000,000 Records.Her Hits include: \"You Belong to Me\", \"Timtayshun\" , \"Whispering Hope\" (with Gordon MacRae ), \"Shrimp Boats\", \"Make Love to Me\", \"Jambalaya\", her album of \"American Folk Songs\", and the comedy albums made under the name of Darlene Edwards. One of these, \"Jonathan and Darlene in Paris\" , has won a Grammy Award. Most of her best known albums including \"JO + JAZZ\", are currently in release on the Corinthian Records label.When Hollywood decided to commemorate its stars with plaques in the sidewalks of Hollywood and Vine , Jo Stafford was one of the few stars to have three separate plaques, one for Records, one for Radio, and one for Television.From swinging Big Band favorites, Holiday Classics, to \"cozy and warm\" fireside ballads; this compilation perfectly expresses the many nostalgic moods of the Winter Season from a timeless era of classic pop recordings as performed by one of America's most versatile singing stars: Jo Stafford.",
