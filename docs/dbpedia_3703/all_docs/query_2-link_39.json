        "text": "Bob1951\n\n12th Oct 2018\n\n\"She's the G.I's Jo\"\n\nInside Cover Text:\n\n\"RADIO, supper clubs, theaters ...Jo Stafford's distinctive voice has brought success with her every endeavor. Probably never before in the history of American popular music has a singer achieved such renown within so short a period. When Capitol released its first record featuring Jo as a soloist in early 1944, she was familiar only to a few disc-buyers as one-fourth of a famous vocal quartet ... Today the picture is different. Starred on major network programs, a young veteran of a dozen of the nation's greater theater stages and a consistent attraction at ornate New York supper clubs, Jo also leads the list of popular recording artists and has been voted the favorite girl singer in a score of popularity polls ...Yank fighting men on Saipan once \"adopted\" her and bestowed upon her the title of \"G.I.'s Jo\", an honor which she regards as more important than making a best-selling record ... Born in California, Jo obtained her experience as a member of the original Pied Pipers vocal group with seven men. Later, the Pied Pipers became affiliated with Tommy Dorsey's orchestra and Jo sang an occasional solo vocal with the band. After Dorsey, she and three Pipers remained together until Johnny Mercer sized up her talents and recorded her as a singing single ... That was in 1944. The eight sparkling selections she offers between these covers receive the svelte accompaniment of Paul Weston, who has cleffed virtually all of Jo's arrangements in recent years ... This is the story behind the expressive voice featured on these records. Capitol is privileged to offer them, but more privileged to offer Jo at her very best. We think you'll agree that she can do no wrong.\""
