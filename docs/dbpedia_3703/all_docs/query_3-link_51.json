        "text": "Before we do anything, I gotta piggyback a little bit off a thing I said, the last time we saw each other.\n\n“Psychedelic Rock was already making waves but the lumbering beast was still waiting patiently, for its’ time.”\n\nWhat a thing to say. This following year, Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles and The Doors and all types of vibrant characters — who nowadays have their names echoing in the halls of Infinity, in-large-part due to these very contributions to music — its new, serious and somewhat competitive landscape that had formed as suddenly as night turns into morning.\n\nIt is easy to see in everything I write about Psychedelic Rock, that it is a personal favorite genre of mine. What I love about the late-sixties even more (I’m serious, visiting this year in-depth is just the first part of a three-part reward for doing all this work and digging through all this material!) … what I love about it even more, is that for how vibrant and fruitful the genres of Space Age Pop, Post-Bop and Country were in the early years of this decade, the giants of Psychedelic Rock, new poetic and self-aware Singer-Songwriter music, were not alone. Every single kind of good creative energy, was invited to this party and the summer of love marked a three-year period of fucking perpetual bloom.\n\nI couldn’t have been more excited when I was done with 1966 and knew that what was ahead of me — all that’s left — were the three years of music I’ve been most-eager to explore, for years.\n\nNone of this is said to de-value all the things from earlier years’ reviews that found themselves etched into my heart and my state-of-being, things I fell utterly in love with.\n\nBut Jesus Christ. 1967.\n\nA thing that could alone have made this year remarkable, was how the biggest band in the world made all their non-sequitous ambition from the last two (still great) years, form into a cohesive sound. The Beatles, whether it was for their fame at the time or just their talent — up to you — set a new standard for experimentation in Rock music, for a wide audience.\n\nA thing that could alone have made this year remarkable, was that this was the year The Jimi Hendrix Experience debuted, Al Green debuted, James Carr debuted, Pink Floyd debuted, The Doors debuted, Sly and the Family Stone debuted, Leonard Cohen debuted, Van Morrison debuted as a solo artist.\n\nA thing that could alone have made this year remarkable, was how the persistent wind in Blue Note’s sails still managed to get that house in the top-batting-average areas where it stood at the top, the last two years, towering over the crowd. This label could still do no wrong in 1967.\n\nA thing that could alone have made this year remarkable, was how Antônio Carlos Jobim kept dominating. He has three albums out of this Top 50, which says much more than when John Coltrane did similar numbers in my earlier sixties-lists because the competition, sadly, wasn’t as steep there. One thing you need to understand about Mr. Jobim, the singular individual embodiment of the sound of Brazil, is that this man already had more songs in the Great American Songbook of standards than arguably anybody else — certainly more than anybody else in the 1950s or 1960s. All of his most famous songs came before this year. This year he just got a brand new bag, and still dominated an entire year. It’s easy to see for anybody, why he’s become one of my favorite musicians ever, with me going through the 60s.\n\nA thing that could alone have made this year remarkable, was how much obscure releases of very regional music hit my radar and absolutely knocked my socks off, amidst all this other craziness goin’ on.\n\nAnd what else… The Velvet Underground and Nico debuted. John Coltrane but his horn down for good. Numerous incredible soundtracks, creative energy blowin’ out of the summer of love’s collective wazoo.\n\nI swear I’m not making all this up.\n\nThis all really happened in just one year.\n\nI hope you’re as hyped as I am.\n\n#50. The Jimi Hendrix Experience – Are You Experienced?\n\nBlues Rock, Psychedelic Rock, Acid Rock, Hard Rock\n\nDebut album by The Jimi Hendrix Experience\n\nReleased May 12, 1967\n\nTrack Record / Polydor / Reprise Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no Jimi’s innovative guitar-playing style opened a new avenue for the sound of Psychedelic Rock, at the times.\n\no The track Purple Haze has an average score of 4.6/5 on RYM.\n\no The track Hey Joe has an average score of 4.5/5 on RYM.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

Lalo Schifrin – Cool Hand Luke\n\nFilm Score, Bossa nova\n\nFourteenth album by Lalo Schifrin\n\nReleased in 1967\n\nDot Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no Soundtrack for the 1967 prison drama film Cool Hand Luke, directed by Stuart Rosenberg.\n\no This soundtrack was reissued in 2001 along with additional cues and new music on Schifrin’s own Aleph Records label.\n\no In part because its staccato melody resembles the sound of a telegraph, an edited version of the 5/4 musical cue from Tar Sequence has been used for many years as the news music package on several television stations’ news programs around the world, most notably on ABC’s owned-and-operated stations (except WPVI and KFSN) as part of their local newscasts starting in 1968 and lasting until the mid-1990s.\n\n#48. Grant Green – Street of Dreams\n\nCool Jazz, Soul Jazz, Hard Bop\n\nTwelfth album by Grant Green\n\nReleased August 1967\n\nBlue Note Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no This album was recorded almost three years before its’ release.\n\no The street signs featured on the cover photo are at an actual street corner in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco.\n\no The title track is a foxtrot composed in 1932 by Victor Young with lyrics by Sam Lewis.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

He later re-affirmed this notion in an interview with NME: “it’s about being cool, laid-back, and also the electrical bananas that were appearing on the scene – which were ladies’ vibrators.”\n\no Paul McCartney played bass guitar — uncredited — on portions of this record. Invertly, Donovan was an uncredited co-author of The Beatles‘ song Yellow Submarine.\n\no According to a Nick Drake biography (Darker Than the Deepest Sea: The Search for Nick Drake), this album was a significant influence on him.\n\no Herman’s Hermits covered Museum on their album Blaze, this year.\n\no Writer in the Sun, Hampstead Incident and Sunny South Kensington are the only tracks that have been remixed into stereo.\n\no The 2005 EMI RecordsCD reissue saw a whole disc of bonus tracks for the album, some of them appearing on A Gift From a Flower to a Garden, the boxset Donovan released at the end of this year.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

I said we don’t have no more material. And the guy said just play anything for three minutes so we can fill out the time. So I just made the riff and naturally the guys could follow it. That’s the only damn thing that sold on the record.”\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1. Alligator Bogaloo\n\n2. One Cylinder\n\n3. I Want a Little Girl\n\n4. Rev. Moses\n\n5. Aw Shucks!\n\n6.

In Europe this album was issued as The Supremes Sing Motown, with how essential the writing-team was to the Motown in these first critically- and commercially successful years for the label.\n\no Notable for including You Keep Me Hangin’ On which is easily one of the most recognizable Supremes-songs, and covered by a variety of bands of the times. Most memorably, Vanilla Fudge later in the same year.\n\no The Supremes did not just sing material written by Holland-Dozier-Holland for them.

The second side is the 1967 singles released by The Beatles; songs that had no other home than this album.\n\no John Lennon referenced two songs from this (I Am the Walrus and Fool on the Hill) on The Beatles’ 1968 album The White Album‘s song Glass Onion.\n\no All You Need Is Love was made for The Beatles’ Our World (satellite broadcast) appearance on June 25th.\n\no EMI engineer Ken Scott said, about the band’s drive in these recording-sessions: “They half knew what they wanted and half didn’t know, not until they’d tried everything. The only specific thought they seemed to have in their mind was to be different.”\n\no The single Hello, Goodbye / I Am the Walrus was the first Beatles release after the death of their producer Brian Epstein.\n\no Paul McCartney has said that Hello, Goodbye takes duality as its theme. In a 1967 interview with Disc magazine he said: “The answer to everything is simple. It’s a song about everything and nothing … If you have black you have to have white.

The Velvet Underground & Nico – The Velvet Underground & Nico\n\nArt Rock, Experimental Rock, Proto-Punk, Noise Rock, Garage Rock, Psychedelic Rock\n\nDebut album by The Velvet Underground\n\nDebut album by Nico\n\nReleased March 12, 1967\n\nVerve Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no Sunday Morning appeared in my 2017 book Talisman.\n\no Another album considered by numerous publications as one of the greatest of all time, this is the 4th most ranked album on all-time lists according to acclaimedmusic.net.\n\no During frontman Lou Reed’s attendance at Syracuse University (at around age 18), he also played guitar with several bar bands and hosted his own radio show on campus, in which he featured the works of various jazz and R&B legends. According to The Velvet Underground: An Illustrated History of a Walk on the Wild Side, he’d amuse himself by using his electric guitar to blast screeches at the marching ROTC cadets on the green outside his dorm window. It was not known back then that would become characteristic of The Velvet Underground’s music, and later end up being a big influencer of music to come — in big-time retrospect actually, since the largest apparent influence of TVU’s first three records is that within the Alternative Rock movement of the 1990s.\n\no Nico sang lead vocals on All Tomorrow’s Parties. She’s also recorded the song for herself and included it in her live shows. Other famous people who have covered the song include Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Jeff Buckley and Simple Minds. William Gibson used the title of the song for one of his novels.\n\no The Psych Rock band The Black Angels (formed in 2004) derived their name from the final track of this album, Black Angel’s Death Song.\n\no Lou Reed dedicated the song European Song to Delmore Schwartz, who taught Reed at Syracuse University. The song is over 7 minutes long, but there are no lyrics after the first minute. This is in tribute to Schwartz, who spoke of hating lyrics in rock songs.\n\no The inspiration for Femme Fatale was actress Edie Sedgwick, who was a member of Andy Warhol’s “Factory” crowd. Warhol was the manager of the Velvet Underground for a time, and good friends with Lou Reed. He asked for this song to be written for Edie.\n\no The line from Heroin, “And I feel just like Jesus’ son”, provided the title for Denis Johnson’s short story collection Jesus’ Son, which was made into a movie in 1999. Heroin also appears on the Oliver Stone film The Doors.\n\no Lou Reed wrote I’ll Be Your Mirror for Nico, anecdotally after Nico approached Reed with this line after a 1965 stage show. He added a new meaning to the line.\n\no I’m Waiting for the Man is a story about buying drugs at the dark side of New York, told from the objective point of the buyer. It’s one of the many songs written about drugs on the album, all of which Reed insisted, while writing, to have no lyrics taking a moral stance or anything else rocking the objectivity of the song itself.\n\no Lou wrote the opening track Sunday Morning on a Sunday morning around 6am. Andy Warhol suggested he write a song about the paranoia associated with the effects of a drug wearing off. The production on that song is also intentionally more lavish than the other tracks on the album. It was intended for release as a single and they wanted to make it radio friendly.\n\no Venus in Furs is inspired by the novella of the same title, written and published by Austrian author Leopold von Sacher-Masoch in 1870. It tells the story of a man who wishes to be dominated and treated as a slave by the woman he loves. We get the word “masochism” from Sacher-Masoch’s last name, and the entire practice of dominance and submission from this and the works of Marquis de Sade, a male author who wrote from the opposite position of dominating women and treating them as slaves.\n\no The single Sunday Morning / Femme Fatale came in on the RYM all-time chart at #7.\n\no Norman Dolph Acetate topped the 60s bootleg chart on RYM.\n\no Venus in Furs / All Tomorrow’s Parties topped the RYM singles-chart for 1988.\n\no Heroin / Venus in Furs / I’m Waiting for the Man / Run Run Run topped the RYM EP chart for 1982, and came in at #6 on the all-time chart.\n\no Sunday Morning is the most played Velvet Underground track of all time, according to last.fm.\n\no The track Sunday Morning has an average score of 4.6/5 on RYM.\n\no The track Heroin has an average score of 4.6/5 on RYM.\n\no The track Venus in Furs has an average score of 4.5/5 on RYM.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

The Moody Blues – Days of Future Passed\n\nBaroque Pop, Art Rock, Symphonic Prog, Progressive Pop, Psychedelic Pop, Tone Poem\n\nThird album by The Moody Blues\n\nReleased December 1967\n\nDeram Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no The decision to employ the The London Festival Orchestra, first came from the label who were worried at The Moody Blues’ first two albums’ lack of financial success… and an opportunity that just happened to be present at the time.\n\no The only time the band and the orchestra play together (instead of trading song-sections and orchestral interludes) is on the last part of the final track, this album’s runaway-hit Nights in White Satin.\n\no The 1978 reissue of this album started with an interesting discovery: the original master tapes of Days of Future Passed had been lost by the label. Therefore the album was completely remixed that year. The end-result differed from the original packaging of the album in many noticeable ways.\n\no The track Nights in White Satin has an average score of 4.6/5 on RYM.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

The Doors – The Doors\n\nPsychedelic Rock, Blues Rock, Acid Rock\n\nDebut album by The Doors\n\nReleased January 4, 1967\n\nElektra Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no The End appeared in my 2020 book The Coleman Stories.\n\no An album considered by numerous publications as one of the greatest of all time, this is the 27th most ranked album on all-time lists according to acclaimedmusic.net.\n\no Light My Fire topped the US Billboard charts for weeks 25, 26 and 27 in 1967.\n\no The original line in the chorus of Break on Through was “She gets high,” but their producer Paul Rothchild thought that would limit the song’s airplay potential, and convinced the group to leave it out. Instead, “high” was edited out, making it sound like, “she get uuggh,” but the “high” line can be heard in live versions. You can also hear the song as intended in the 1999 reissue of the album, which was overseen by their original engineer Bruce Botnick. He also replaced Jim Morrison’s “f–k”s on The End.\n\no Soul Kitchen is a tribute to a soul food restaurant Jim Morrison ate at on Venice Beach called Olivia’s. Morrison often stayed too late at Olivia’s, where he liked the food because it reminded him of home and warmed his “soul.” They often kicked him out so they can close, thus lines like: “let me sleep all night, in your soul kitchen.”\n\no Jim Morrison got the title of The Crystal Ship — B-side to the band’s most successful single Light My Fire — from a Celtic legend in The Book Of The Dun Cow, a collection of stories compiled by about 1100 Irish monks around the 9th century.\n\no Producer Paul Rothchild had the band walk on wooden planks during the chorus of Twentieth Century Fox to get the pounding effect.\n\no In 2002, original Doors members Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek joined former The Police drummer Stewart Copeland and former The Cult singer Ian Astbury to form a new group which they called “21st Century Doors,” the name being a takeoff on the song Twentieth Century Fox.\n\no Alabama Song (Whisky Bar) is a cover of a German opera song written in 1929 by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht. It was used in a controversial 1930 German operetta called The Rise And Fall Of The City Of Mahogany.\n\no Most of the song Light My Fire was written by Robby Krieger, who wanted to write about one of the elements: fire, air, earth, and water. The song was supposed to have a Folk flavor to it, but it ignited as a result of two things that happened subsequently: Jim Morrison coming up with the line “our love become a funeral pyre”, and Ray Manzarek coming up with the famous organ intro.\n\no The producers of The Ed Sullivan Show asked the band to change the line of Light My Fire “Girl we couldn’t get much higher” for their appearance in 1967. Morrison said he would, but sung it anyway. Afterwards, he told Sullivan that he was nervous and simply forgot to change the line. This didn’t fly, and The Doors were never invited back.\n\no The title and some of the lyrics of End of the Night were inspired by the 1932 French novel Journey To The End Of The Night by Louis-Ferdinand Celine.\n\no Take It as It Comes is about accepting what life gives you at your own pace. It was dedicated to the Maharishi, a teacher of transcendental meditation, after Jim Morrison attended one of his lectures. The full name of this particular Maharishi is Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1917-2008. “Maharishi” itself is just a title meaning “enlightened, spiritual one.” Yogi had a good sense of humor and as he often laughed in TV interviews, he was nicknamed “the giggling guru.” While his teachings, the practice of transcendental meditation, were usually associated with Hindu or Buddhist religions, Yogi was out to advocate meditation itself as a spiritual practice and alternative medicine, based on his interpretation of the ancient Vedic science. The Maharishi is famous for leading a meditation camp in 1967 attended by The Beatles, Donovan, and Mia Farrow. John Lennon wrote Sexy Sadie about The Maharishi.\n\no The Doors developed the song The End during live performances at the Whisky a Go Go, a Los Angeles club where they were the house band in 1966. They had to play two sets a night, so they were forced to extend their songs in order to fill the sets. This gave them a chance to experiment with their songs. The song began as Jim Morrison’s farewell to Mary Werbelow, his girlfriend who followed him from Florida to Los Angeles. It developed into an 11-minute epic. Morrison sang the song live as “F–k the mother,” rather than “Screw the mother.” At the time, the band couldn’t cross what their engineer Bruce Botnick called “the f–k barrier,” so they sanitized the lyric on the album. When Botnick remixed the album for a 1999 reissue, however, he put Morrison’s “f–k”s back in, which is how the song was intended.\n\no The End was famously used in the 1979 Francis Ford Coppola film Apocalypse Now over scenes of the Vietnam war, and as the end-credits rolled. Coppola had the song remixed to include the fuck the mother line.\n\no Break on Through (To the Other Side) is the most played The Doors track of all time, according to last.fm.\n\no The track Break on Through (To the Other Side) has an average score of 4.5/5 on RYM.\n\no The track Light My Fire has an average score of 4.5/5 on RYM.\n\no The track The End has an average score of 4.5/5 on RYM.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

Frank Sinatra & Antônio Carlos Jobim – Francis Albert Sinatra & Antônio Carlos Jobim\n\nBossa nova, Standards, Vocal Jazz\n\nForty-seventh album by Frank Sinatra\n\nEleventh album by Antônio Carlos Jobim\n\nReleased March 1967\n\nReprise Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no The Great American Songbook includes three tracks that appear here: Change Partners, I Concentrate on You and Baubles, Bangles and Beads\n\no This isn’t the only collaboration between the two titans of balladry; from the late-sixties to the late-seventies, one after another new release by Jobim and Sinatra surfaced, until finally in 2010 the Concord Records label issued a new, comprehensive compilation titled The Complete Reprise Recordings.\n\no In 1968 the Grammys nominated this album for Album of the Year, where it lost to Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\n\no Before finishing this album, Jobim had to wait for Sinatra to return from a holiday in Barbados where he was taking a mutually agreed “break” from his marriage to Mia Farrow.\n\no Al Viola played guitar on Change Partners, but is not credited on the album.\n\no February 1, 1967 was the final recording date for this album.

A couple weeks later from that day, Coltrane recorded duo tracks with Alice Coltrane (Ogunde and Number One) that would later be released on Interstellar Space (1974) and The Mastery of John Coltrane, Vol. III: Jupiter Variation (1978).\n\no To Be is the only track where the lineup of musicians is expanded. Besides the quartet, Pharoah Sanders and (possibly) Algie DeWitt are featured. On this track Coltrane also plays flute.\n\no In May 1967, Coltrane, who had been suffering from liver cancer since mid-1966, and who had canceled a number of concerts that month, “spent days stretched out on a coach, listening back to his recent recording sessions.” On July 14, three days before his death, Coltrane met with producer Bob Thiele to finish plans for the album, and suggested the title Expression.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

Donovan – For Little Ones\n\nSinger/Songwriter, Contemporary Folk, Children’s Music, Psychedelic Folk, Psychedelic Pop, Folk Pop\n\nSixth album by Donovan\n\nReleased December 1967\n\nEpic Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no Part-two of A Gift From a Flower to a Garden, a double-album boxset which was the first for Donovan, and one of the earliest for music, period. This and Wear Your Love Like Heaven (first part) were only released as separate albums to the U.S. market by Epic Records, the same year the whole thing was released.\n\no The infrared photo of Donovan (on Wear Your Love Like Heaven) was shot by Karl Ferris who was the personal photographer for Donovan and Jimi Hendrix. The photo required six color separations for printing, instead of the usual four separations. Which I guess is something you would say in the days before photoshop.\n\no Epistle to Dippy was essentially an inside-joke/open letter for a childhood friend. It hit the top 20 on the singles-charts in February of 1967, following Donovan’s ambition after the release of Mellow Yellow, to commit to releasing great singles rather than full bodies of work. In August of 1967, There Is a Mountain followed the song on the top 20, reaching the top 10 in the UK.\n\no While Mickie Most is credited for the album’s production, the bulk of the production-job was handled by Donovan himself.\n\no Donovan took a deep anti-drug stance on A Gift from a Flower to a Garden, barring to a sentencing from marijuana-possession in this year. Additionally, he said in the liner notes for the double albums that his aim was to create two rather different discs, one for the present generation, and the other for the “dawning generation”.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

Whilst the former sounds like “a kind of American Indian dance, evoking trance-like states”, the latter has “the sound of a man alone. A man reflecting on what religion means to him, reflecting on the meaning of life.” Tyner titled the fourth piece “Search for Peace” because of its tranquil feeling; it “has to do with a man’s submission to God” and the “giving over of the self to the universe”.\n\no The album closes with the track Blues on the Corner, which is dedicated to Tyner’s neighborhood tradition — not an uncommon one, but one with its own distinct sting in different area codes — of spending time, hanging out on the corner.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

No. 9 in B major in a minor key (B minor) instead of the usual major.\n\no The track Op. 9, No. 2 in E-flat has an average score of 4.5/5 on RYM.\n\n#7. Thelonious Monk – Straight, No Chaser\n\nPost-Bop\n\nTwenty-second album by Thelonious Monk\n\nReleased March 20, 1967\n\nColumbia Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no Locomotive, the title track and We See are Thelonious Monk originals. I Didn’t Know About You was composed by Duke Ellington, Japanese Folk Song by 瀧廉太郎 [Rentaro Taki], and Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea by Harold Arlen.\n\no On all issues past the original, Japanese Folk Song has been (correctly) re-identified in the tracklisting by its’ original title, Kojo no Tsuki.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

John Fahey – Requia\n\nAmerican Primitivism, Sound Collage\n\nSeventh album by John Fahey\n\nReleased December 1967\n\nVanguard Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no After releasing exclusively on his own Takoma Records label, John Fahey signed to Vanguard Records for a deal that consisted of two albums. This is the first of the two albums he ended up making for the new master.\n\no Denny Bruce, Fahey’s manager at the time, recalled that “His deal was that he could record for Takoma ‘experimental records,’ but to try and make commercial recordings for Vanguard, with their approval of the budget.”\n\no John Fahey (unlike me) does not like Requiem for Molly, Pt. 1-4. It was his first attempt at creating Musique Concrete., and he later remembered it as a “very good learning experience though.”\n\no Part 4 of Requiem for Molly uses California Dreaming, the recent Top-40 hit for The Mamas & The Papas.\n\no Fight on Christians, Fight On is named after Christians, Fight On, Your Time Ain’t Long by Bo Weavil Jackson. Wanna fight about it?\n\no Requiem for John Hurt makes obvious reference in its title to Mississippi John Hurt.\n\no In his original liner notes, Fahey wrote “Since 1948, after seeing the movie, The Thief of Bagdad, I composed cerebral symphonies every day. It was a pleasant pastime. But suddenly in 1953 I needed a full orchestra at my command — me playing every instrument in that impossible ensemble.”\n\no In those liner-notes John Fahey also said that Catfish and Fight On aren’t Requia, but father Cantica.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

The Doors – Strange Days\n\nPsychedelic Rock, Blues Rock, Acid Rock, Psychedelic Pop, Spoken Word\n\nSophomore album by The Doors\n\nReleased September 25, 1967\n\nElektra Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no I had pages upon pages of trivia written/compiled for this album back in September 4, 2017 where I wrote a report about it for another project of mine. My computer crashed inexplicably on that day, wiping away all of it JUST as I was done and ready to save my progress. I talked about everything, about how this album’s innovations of studio-technology made it close to the Pet Sounds/Bitches Brew-tier in terms of pure influence on musicianship at the times. The huge machines the studio dragged in just to make every sound as complete as possible. The kind of unsung genius of Strange Days. But since I was so fucking upset at my computer that morning, I still refuse to write that trivia. It was a day that will live on in infamy.\n\no The track People Are Strange has an average score of 4.5/5 on RYM.\n\no When the Music’s Over appeared on The Sopranos’ episode The Blue Comet (S6E20).\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

Aretha Franklin – I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You\n\nDeep Soul, Southern Soul, Rhythm & Blues\n\nNinth album by Aretha Franklin\n\nReleased March 10, 1967\n\nAtlantic\n\ntrivia:\n\no Respect is a cover-version of the Otis Redding track from Otis Blue; Album of the Year for 1965.\n\no This is the album that laucnhed Aretha to the stratosphere. If you’re ever listening to oldies with your kneesock-knitting-ass grandmother, and you hear a fucking banger on the oldies-station with a soulfulness that’s just eagerly bursting out with every fiery second, thank Aretha. Thank I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You.\n\no This album was included in the 2005 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die and the 2008 opus 1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die.\n\no Respect was a #1 hit single, and the title track of the album peaked at #9 on Billboard.\n\no There are two Sam Cooke covers on this album, Good Times and A Change Is Gonna Come (which was also covered on Redding’s album Otis Blue).\n\no The 1995 reissue saw stereo versions surface of three tracks: Respect, the title track, and Do Right Woman, Do Right Man.\n\no The track Respect has an average score of 4.5/5 on RYM.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

New York Philharmonic / Leonard Bernstein – Eroica\n\nSymphony, Romanticism\n\n167th album by New York Philharmonic\n\n96th album by Leonard Bernstein\n\nReleased in 1967\n\nCBS\n\ntrivia:\n\no Sinfonia Eroica, officially titled Symphony No. 3 in E flat major, is one of Ludwig van Beethoven‘s most celebrated works, and the large-scale composition that marked the beginning of his creative middle-period.\n\no Considered to be one of the landmark pieces in the transition from the Classical period, to the Romantic period, Eroica was composed mainly in 1803-04, and while it is grounded in the Classical era’s symphonic tradition, it also stretches boundaries of form, length, harmony and perceived emotional and possibly cultural content, on a level that was unheard-of, back then.\n\no At the end of the development, one horn famously appears to come in early with the main theme in E♭ (mm. 394–395), while the strings continue playing the dominant chord. In the 19th century, this was thought to be a mistake; some conductors assumed the horn notes were written in the tenor clef (B♭–D–B♭–F) while others altered the second violin harmony to G (chord of the tonic), an error that eventually appeared in an early printed version. However, Beethoven’s secretary, Ferdinand Ries, shared this anecdote about that horn entrance: “The first rehearsal of the symphony was terrible, but the hornist did, in fact, come in on cue. I was standing next to Beethoven and, believing that he had made a wrong entrance, I said, “That damned hornist! Can’t he count? It sounds frightfully wrong.” I believe I was in danger of getting my ears boxed. Beethoven did not forgive me for a long time.”\n\no There is significant evidence that the Eroica, perhaps unlike Beethoven’s other symphonies, was constructed back-to-front.The theme used in the fourth movement, including its bass line, originate from the seventh of Beethoven’s 12 Contredanses, and also from the Finale to his ballet Die Geschöpfe des Prometheus, both of which were composed in the winter of 1800–1801.\n\no While composing, Beethoven originally dedicated the symphony to Napoleon Bonaparte, who he believed embodied the democratic and anti-monarchical ideals of the French Revolution. In the autumn of 1804, Beethoven withdrew this dedication, when Ferdinand Ries told him Napoleon had proclaimed himself Emperor of the French (May 14, 1804); “I was the first to tell him the news that Buonaparte had declared himself Emperor, whereupon he broke into a rage and exclaimed, “So he is no more than a common mortal! Now, too, he will tread under foot all the rights of Man, indulge only his ambition; now he will think himself superior to all men, become a tyrant!” Beethoven went to the table, seized the top of the title-page, tore it in half and threw it on the floor. The page had to be recopied, and it was only now that the symphony received the title Sinfonia eroica.”\n\n#2. Antônio Carlos Jobim – Wave\n\nBossa nova, Lounge, Samba-Jazz\n\nThirteenth album by Antônio Carlos Jobim\n\nReleased September 1967\n\nA&M Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no Prolific Jazz-album cover photographer Pete Turner created the psychedelic solarized cover picture of a giraffe.\n\no The album cover was parodied/referenced in the Carlos Berlanga Synthpop album Indicios (1994).\n\no The title track was sung with lyrics by Frank Sinatra on Sinatra & Company (1971).\n\no Triste was written by Jobim while he waited for Frank Sinatra to return from his vacation at Barbaros so they could begin recording their album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antônio Carlos Jobim — which is also one of the finest albums of 1967.\n\no This album is something I regularly use to relax when I can’t find any other vehicles for that in stressful situations. That’s more important to me than any studio recording session story about how Jimi Hendrix coughed into a guitar which Donovan looked at on his way to the salad bar over at Electric Lady Studios.\n\nlast.fm ranks the tracks:\n\n1.

Dialogo\n\nALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nLeonard Cohen – Songs of Leonard Cohen\n\nContemporary Folk, Singer/Songwriter, Chamber Folk\n\nDebut album by Leonard Cohen\n\nReleased December 27, 1967\n\nColumbia Records\n\ntrivia:\n\no The Stranger Song appeared in my 2019 book Helicopters.\n\no Leonard was in his 30s by the mid-late 60s, and was living life as a critically acclaimed poet whose living was supported by a Canadian organization arranging social support for excellent artists. Suzanne is a cover of the song of the same name, sung by Judy Collins, whom Leonard wrote the song for in 1966. Judy was one of the main inspirations, along with the grand scope of New York’s Folk underground scene, for Leonard to step out of his “zone” as a man in his thirties. He’d always been interested in music however, and even played in a Country/Western band The Buckskin Boys as a teenager.\n\no Sisters of Mercy was the only song Leonard said he’d ever written in one take. It came to him one night when two roommates — both women — offered him shelter from a blizzard. He said (source) that all through the night, erotic fantasies were all over his mind, until the sight of the moon being reflected off of fresh snow, awoke inspiration in him. He stood in front of a window, looking at the moonlight’s reflection, and wrote the song right there.\n\no The Goth Rock/Post-Punk band The Sisters of Mercy took their name from the fifth track, Sisters of Mercy. The title of their compilation album Some Girls Wander by Mistake — also on this list — is derived from lyrics of the song Teachers (track #9).\n\no This album, the debut of Cohen, foreshadows the division his future albums would almost by-definition have internationally, achieving more success on the charts in Europe than in America.\n\no The album spent almost an entire year on the UK Albums Chart.\n\no Cohen asked that a full-length mirror be brought into the studio because, as he explained to Mojo in November 2001, “through some version of narcissism, I always used to play in front of a mirror. I guess it was the best way to look while playing the guitar, or maybe it was just where the chair was. But I was very comfortable looking at myself playing.”\n\no The writing of Suzanne took place in Montreal while Leonard was staying there, and lasted 4-5 months.\n\no In the book Songwriters on Songwriting, Cohen told author Paul Zollo that he wrote So Long, Marianne “in two hotels. One was the Chelsea and the other was the Penn Terminal Hotel. I remember Marianne (Ihlen, Cohen’s girlfriend at the time) looking at my notebook, seeing this song and asking, ‘Who’d you write this for?'”\n\no On the back cover of the album is a Mexican religious picture of the Anima Sola depicted as a woman breaking free of her chains surrounded by flames and gazing towards heaven. In a Rolling Stone interview, Cohen described the image as “the triumph of the spirit over matter. The spirit being that beautiful woman breaking out of the chains and the fire and prison.” Cohen found the picture in a botánica near the Hotel Chelsea in 1965.\n\no Songs of Leonard Cohen saw its first release on CD issued in 1989, while a digipak edition was released in European countries in 2003. Finally in 2007, bonus tracks started rolling out; two of them, called Store Room and Blessed Is the Memory.\n\no Additional credited musicians on this album were Jimmy Lovelace (drums on So Long, Marianne), Nancy Priddy (vocals on Suzanne, So Long, Marianne and Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye), Willy Ruff (bass on So Long, Marianne and Stories of the Street), Chester Crill, Chris Darrow, Solomon Feldthouse, and David Lindley (flute, mandolin, Jew’s harp, violin, various Middle Eastern instruments on Master Song, Winter Lady, Sisters of Mercy, So Long Marianne, Hey That’s No Way to Say Goodbye, Stories of the Street and Teachers)\n\no In 1969, Cohen met another Suzanne: a 19-year-old named Suzanne Elrod. They had a passionate and tumultuous affair that lasted about 10 years. The couple never married, but Elrod gave birth to his two children, son Adam Cohen and daughter Lorca Cohen.\n\no Three songs from this album appear on the off-beat 1971 Western McCabe & Mrs. Miller: Winter Lady, The Stranger Song (opening credits) and Sisters of Mercy.\n\no The Stranger Song also plays extensively in the 1967 film The Ernie Game, which is about a man released from a mental asylum, apparently prematurely.\n\no Marianne Ihlen and Leonard Cohen both died of cancer in 2016, Ihlen in July and Cohen in November. When Cohen learned that she was sick, he wrote her a letter that read: Well Marianne it’s come to this time when we are really so old and our bodies are falling apart and I think I will follow you very soon. Know that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine. And you know that I’ve always loved you for your beauty and your wisdom, but I don’t need to say anything more about that because you know all about that. But now, I just want to wish you a very good journey. Goodbye old friend. Endless love, see you down the road.\n\no Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye has been covered by Maxine Weldon in 1971, Roberta Flack in 1969, Phosphorescent in 2010, Ian McCulloch in 1991, Herman van Veen in 1969, The Lemonheads in 2009, The Colgate Thirteen in 1973, The Vogues in 1970, Esther Ofarim in 1972, Yasmine in 2004, Claudine Longet in 1972, Nickel Eye in 2009, AM/FM in 2001, Michael Monroe in 2003, Farhad Mehrad in 2010, and Maciej Zembaty in 1984.

Out of this world. I know I said in my 1966-list that it was the best year I ever logged through, but this time… I’m finding that words are hardly enough.\n\nStay tuned for 1968 though. If you didn’t get quite your fill of trivia about Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix or The Beatles in particular… I’m pretty sure when we get to the next year, you will.\n\n.\n\nThat reminds me, it stand to be mentioned that this is now the fourth year-list in a row where The Supremes have a placement. I am discovering their music just as I’m discovering most of these things that you see me put on these lists, and this achievement is nothing short of great.\n\n.\n\nAlso, I will be starting a new project on this blog very soon into 2021. A project that I have been planning and researching for since last spring. It’s gonna be really exciting. Especially so, if you’re a fan of the HBO show The Sopranos.\n\nTwo songs from albums in this list appeared on The Sopranos. Frank Sinatra and Antônio Carlos Jobim’s Baubles, Bangles and Beads, and The Doors’ When the Music’s Over.\n\n.\n\nDon’t turn out the lights just yet though, because by all estimations this listening-project is only gonna get more and more and more epic for these upcoming, final, two years of it. Following that I’ll write a Top 100 Decade-List. Wow. This is my first time announcing that. The first time I feel confident enough that I will finish this and not back out of it.\n\n2021, the rest is left to you.\n\n2021, the best is left to you.\n\n.\n\nSee ya."
