        "text": "US singer Sabrina Carpenter broke a UK chart record when she became the first female artist to hold both the No.1 and No.2 positions on the singles chart for three consecutive weeks. 'Please Please Please' remained in the top spot on this week's chart, while her previous single \"Espresso\" held on at No.2. The Beatles achieved the same feat in the 60s, scoring the chart double on two separate occasions.\n\nThe Beatles had the biggest-selling vinyl single of 2023 in the UK with their record-breaking ‘last’ song, 'Now and Then'. With over 33,000 copies sold since its release, they broke several records including the longest time between an artist’s first and last No.1 and the UK’s fastest-selling vinyl single of the century. The ballad that John Lennon wrote and recorded around 1977 as a home demo was completed by his surviving bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, using overdubs and guitar tracks by George Harrison from the abandoned 1995 Anthology sessions.\n\nTaylor Swift surpassed Elvis Presley for the most No.1 weeks of any solo musician in music history. To date, Swift had logged 68 weeks with the No.1 album in America. That number tops Elvis’ previous record of 67 weeks at the top of the charts.

He became a constant member of Wings for their entire run from 1971 to 1981, playing guitar, bass, keyboards, singing backing and lead vocals, and co-writing songs with McCartney including the 1977 hit 'Mull of Kintyre'.\n\nThe Beatles topped the UK charts with their single, 'Now and Then', making them the act with the longest gap between their first and last No.1's. Sixty years after 'From Me to You' topped the charts, Sir Paul McCartney said: \"It's blown my socks off!\" 'Now and Then' became this century's fastest-selling vinyl single, according to the Official Charts Company. Its first bars were written by John Lennon in 1978, and the song was finally completed last year.\n\nA rare copy of The Beatles' 1968 White Album raised more than £2,000 at auction after being donated to a British charity shop.

In the audiences, among Gracie's fans, were future rock musicians Graham Nash and members of The Beatles.\n\nRobbie Williams overtook Elvis Presley (13 No.1s), to become the solo artist with the most UK No.1 albums ever when his latest album XXV topped the UK chart. Only The Beatles had more UK No.1 albums than Robbie with 15 across their career.\n\nThe Metallica classic 'Enter Sandman' topped a list of songs with misheard lyrics, while Mick Jagger was named as the singer people struggle most to understand. A survey of 1,000 Americans by WordFinder also suggested that 65% of people, on discovering they’ve been wrong for years about a favorite song, decide they prefer the incorrect version. \"Enter Sandman\" came on top overall, with 70% of listeners believing the line \"Exit light, enter night\" was actually \"Eggs and light end all nights.\" 52% heard The Beatles sing \"I get high, I get high, I get high\" on I Want to Hold Your Hand rather than the real words \"I can’t hide, I can’t hide, I can’t hide.\" Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' came next: \"With the lights out, it’s less dangerous / Here we are now, entertain us\" heard as \"With the lights out, it’s Las Vegas / Hear me all now, entertainers\".\n\nHarry Styles was at No.1 in the UK with his third studio album Harry's House.
