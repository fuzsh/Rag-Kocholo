They’re not easy to get, but available. If you get above set, you need to start with Volume 3 (some overlap), and then continue until and including Volume 7:\n\nComplete Sister Rosetta Tharpe / Intégrale Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Vol. 3: 1947–1951 (Frémeaux & Associés FA 1303)\n\nComplete Sister Rosetta Tharpe / Intégrale Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Vol. 4: 1951–1953 (Frémeaux & Associés FA 1304)\n\nComplete Sister Rosetta Tharpe / Intégrale Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Vol. 5: 1953–1957 (Frémeaux & Associés FA 1305)\n\nComplete Sister Rosetta Tharpe / Intégrale Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Vol. 6: 1958–1959 (Frémeaux & Associés FA 1306)\n\nComplete Sister Rosetta Tharpe / Intégrale Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Vol. 7: 1960–1961 (Frémeaux & Associés FA 1307)\n\nThen you need to get:\n\nLive in Paris, 1964 (France’s Concert FC 118, 1964)\n\nLive at the Hot Club de France (BMG / Milan ML2 35624, 1966)\n\nFamous Negro Spirituals and Gospel Songs (Guilde Internationale Du Disque SJS 1265, 1966)\n\nThen there are some scattered 1969-tracks for a jazz-film soundtrack originally published in 1971 on two LPs, these where all gathered on Fremeaux on a double-CD:\n\nL’aventure du jazz Vol. 1 & 2, la musique du film de Louis Panassié 1969–1972 (Frémeaux & Associés FA 5666, V/A, 7 tracks)\n\nAnd, to come to a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion, her last output is only available on two LPs, which were later combined to a double plus here two very last recordings:\n\nThe Best Of Sister Rosetta Tharpe Singing And Playing 22 Of Her Greatest Hits (Savoy 7029) – This combines Precious Memories (Savoy MG14214) and Singing in My Soul-LP (Savoy MG14224), but then you’re still two tracks short in comparison to the combined LP.\n\nYeah, well, this is still pretty good, nice box, nice series. Alright.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe’s complete recordings\n\nTommy McClennan\n\nLived 1905–1961, recorded 1939–1942.\n\nThere’s a JSP-set Big Joe Williams and the Stars of Mississippi Blues ((JSP 7719, 5 CDs, 126 tracks, see under –>Big Joe Williams) which has also all of McClennan’s stuff and a lot more.\n\nIf you hate the idea of getting that set, there is Bluebird Recordings 1939-1942 (RCA 07863 67430 2) – nice double-disc (also better than the two Document discs).\n\nTommy McClennan’s complete recordings\n\nJohn Henry Barbee\n\nLived 1905–1964, recorded 1938, 1963–1964.\n\nHis few early tracks are on this Document compilation:\n\nMemphis Blues (1927-1938) (Document DOCD-5159, 1938, V/A)\n\nHis „proper“ 1960s collections here:\n\nBlues Masters, Vol. 3: I Ain’t Gonna Pick No More Cotton (Storyville STCD 8003, 1964)\n\nBlues Live!

These compilations below collects most of that material, but they do have major overlap:\n\nShake Baby Shake [The Essential Blue Archive] (Blue Label SPV 50812)\n\nShake Baby Shake (Detour 33-007, adds some unissued Groove & Viks Sides)\n\nPiano Blues: New Orleans Barrelhouse 1960 (Magpie PYCD 53)\n\nChampion of the Blues (Atlantic 8056, 1961 album)\n\nThis collects two of his best albums with a lot of bonus material, get this one for sure:\n\nTwo Classic Albums: Plus 40s & 50s Singles – Blues From the Gutter / Natural & Soulful Blues (Avid Roots AMSC1006, 1958/59)\n\nFolkways session:\n\nThe Women Blues of Champion Jack Dupree (Folkways FS 3825, 1961 LP)\n\nFrom 1960 onwards, Dupree recorded for Storyville in Europe. Most of this material is available, but in the following years, those sessions were scattered throughout several albums, later compilations and several V/A-compilations – it’s really a great, astounding mess (the material is consistently good though). I left out several V/A-comps, but this is a bulk of his 1960s work. It is probably most sensible to get the CD-issues, they have the most in one place:\n\nBlues Masters, Vol. 6 (Storyville STCD 8006)\n\nTrouble, Trouble (Storyville SLP 145, 1961)\n\nOf New Orleans (Storyville ST 21009, 1962)\n\nThe Blues of Champion Jack Dupree Vol.1 (Storyville STCD 8019)\n\nThe Blues of Champion Jack Dupree, Vol. 2 (Storyville STCD 8020)\n\nTruckin‘ On Down (Storyville STCD 1829, 1960-63)\n\nThe Blues of Champion Jack Dupree (Storyville STCD 8031)\n\nV/A-comp CDs with storyville material:\n\nBarrelhouse Blues & Boogie Woogie, Vol. 1 (Storyville STCD 1830)\n\nBarrelhouse Blues & Boogie Woogie, Vol. 2 (Storyville STCD 1844)\n\nBarrelhouse Blues & Boogie Woogie, Vol. 3 (Storyville STCD 1845)\n\nStoryville LPs with at least some songs not issued on the above CDs:\n\nPapa Bue’s Viking Jazzband and Jack Dupree (Storyville SLP 150)\n\nThe Incredible Champion Jack Dupree (Sonet SNTF 614)\n\nPortraits in Blues Vol. 5 (Storyville SLP 161)\n\nThe Best of the Blues (Storyville SLP 151)\n\nCheck out his entire Storyville-catalogue in this amazing document, which also tells you which LPs are equivalent to others etc.\n\nhttp://www.karl-emil-knudsen.dk/Dupree/JACK%20DUPREE%20ON%20STORYVILLE.pdf\n\n(it contains minor errors, e.g. SLP 151 isn’t the same as ST 21009 – while SLP 193 is, though)\n\nV/A-comps:\n\nI Blueskvarter: 1964, Volume Three (Jefferson Records SBACD 12658/9, 1964, V/A, 7 tracks)\n\nUp until 1964, this is about 90% of his stuff that is comparatively easy to assemble (there’s more on obscure EPs and scattered V/A-comps).\n\nFrom 1965 onwards, the albums are your best bet, starting with\n\nFrom New Orleans to Chicago / Champion Jack Dupree and His Blues Band (BGO Records BGOCD649, 1966/67 two-fer)\n\nDupree ’n‘ McPhee: The 1967 Blue Horizon Session (Ace CDCHM 1063, 1967 session)\n\nJivin‘ With Jack (Jasmine JASMCD 3008/9, 1967 live)\n\nThe Complete Blue Horizon Sessions (Columbia 518516 2, 1968/69.

There are some major corners to cut and this is much more than just his essential stuff. But it isn’t all of it, and I’ll revisit this for the time after 1970 at some point.\n\nUntil 1970, this is most, if not quite all of\n\nChampion Jack Dupree’s complete recordings\n\nLil Green\n\nreal name Lillian Green or Lillie May Johnson\n\nLived 1919–1954, recorded 1940–1951.\n\nThe Chronological Lil Green 1940-1941 (Classics 5072)\n\nThe Chronological Lil Green: 1942 – 1946 (Classics 5099)\n\nThe Chronological Lil Green: 1947 – 1951 (Classics 5131)\n\nLil Green’s complete recordings\n\nRobert Petway\n\nLived 1902 or 1903 (possibly 1907)–unknown, recorded 1941–1942.\n\nCatfish Blues: Mississippi Blues, Vol. 3 (1936-1942) (DOCD-5671, 1941–1942). This includes Petway’s 14 issued sides and some tracks by –>Mississippi Matilda and her then-husband – and –>Mississippi Sheiks member – Sonny Boy Nelson (= Eugene Powell).\n\nKaboom,\n\nRobert Petway’s complete recordings\n\nBig Maceo Merriweather\n\nLived 1905–1953, recorded 1941–1950.\n\nThere are two Document CDs, but they miss this or that track (and put them on their clean-up-compilations), so the way to go is probably the JSP double-disc with all of it:\n\nPower Piano Player (JSP 4230)\n\nBig Maceo Merriweather’s complete recordings\n\nArthur „Big Boy“ Crudup\n\nLived 1905–1974, recorded 1941–1974(?).\n\nComplete Recorded Works 1941-1954 In Chronological Order, vol 1 (11 September 1941 to 6 September 1946) (DOCD-5201)\n\nComplete Recorded Works 1941-1954 in Chronological Order, Vol. 2 (6 September 1946 to 11 March 1949) (DOCD-5202)\n\nComplete Recorded Works 1941-1954 in Chronological Order, Vol. 3 (11 March 1949 to 15 January 1952) (DOCD-5203)\n\nComplete Recorded Works 1941-1954 in Chronological Order, Vol. 4 (15 January 1952 to 8 April 1954) (DOCD-5204)\n\nGet these Document series discs and his remaining official albums he cut (starting with 1962’s\n\nMean Ol‘ Frisco [Charly Blues Masterworks Vol. 50] (Charly CD BM 50 )), and I think you’re set.\n\nUnless I’m missing obscure tracks on various-artist-compilatios, these should be\n\nArtur „Big Boy“ Crudup’s complete recordings\n\nMuddy Waters\n\nbirth name McKinley Morganfield\n\nLived 1913–1983, recorded 1941–1981.\n\nThe Complete Plantation Recordings (Chess CHD-9344, 1941–1942)\n\nLibrary of Congress Recordings (1941-1942) / Early Commercial Recordings (1946-1950) (DOCD-5146, some overlap with the former, but some otherwise not available cuts from 1946/47, also by others with Waters as a sideman)\n\nThe Complete Muddy Waters (1947-1967) (Charly CD RED BOX 3, 1947–1967, 9 discs. It’s kind of unbelievable, but this really is virtually all the officially published stuff, incl. some alternate takes up until 1967. Missing are some originally unissued live and studio tracks that later surfaced on scattered V/A-compilations, some live recordings where he appeared for a track or two at the American Folk Blues Festivals in Germany, some Newport. Also, some alternate takes missing. We’re not talking big numbers though, but beware that you’ll „only“ have about (rough estimate) 90 % of his stuff from this period if you get this box. I don’t list all the „American Folk Blues Festival“-stuff, because it’s easier to just get all those records which you need to fill up the discographies of all the particapting guys, but I’ll make a separate list for all those compilation at some point)\n\nNow let’s fill some minor gaps for the time until 1967:\n\nImportant:\n\nMuddy Waters And Otis Spann In Concert 1958 (Krazy Kat ‎LP 7405)\n\nHoochie Coochie Man (LRC CDC 9050, 5 additional songs)\n\nGoin‘ Way Back (Just a Memory JAM 9130, 1967, an entire archival 1967 session with familiar songs)\n\nOne More Mile (MCA CHD2-9348, large overlap, but at least two 1965-songs only here)\n\nMiscellaneous, V/A:\n\nAlan Lomax Presents Folk Song Festival At Carnegie Hall (UAL 3050, 1959, V/A, 2 songs) AND\n\nAmerican Folk Blues Festival ’63 (Fontana 681 510 ZL, V/A, 1 song) AND\n\nRare Live Recordings Volume One (Black Bear 901, Python PLP-BB 901) AND\n\nBroken Soul Blues (United Artists UAL 3137, credited to Memphis Slim, 1961, Muddy plays on „Rock Me“ and „Sunrise Blues“)\n\nFrom 1968, get the official (studio and live) albums, starting with Electric Mud (Cadet Concept LPS-314, 1968).\n\nBut more archival releases include:\n\nLive the Life (Testament TCD 6001, 1968, with Otis Spann)\n\nRare Live Recordings Volume One (Black Bear PLB-BB 901, Python PLP-BB 901)\n\nRare Live Recordings Volume Two (Black Bear PLB-BB 902)\n\nRare Live Recordings Vol. 3 (Black Bear PLP-BB 903, 1970)\n\nLive in Paris 1968 (France’s Concert FC-121, 1968)\n\n19 Tracks from the Film Chicago Blues (Red Lightnin‘ RL 0055, V/A, 1970, 3 tracks, this appears on some other discographies)\n\nGoin‘ Home Live in Paris 1970 (Fan Club FCD 99, 1970)\n\nThen there is a row of appearences with his band on various Victoria Spivey-records, so look there.\n\nGenerally, check –>Victoria Spivey, –>Memphis Slim and –>Otis Spann for more Muddy Waters.\n\nThis is what I can do up until 1968 or 1970. I left out some single scattered tracks because I couldn’t be bothered (really about three or four). Note that there’s probably more archival live stuff from the late 1960s and later that I didn’t track down here. But this is still pretty okay. And of course there’s a lot of material after 1970. Check out this discography: http://www.bluesandrhythm.co.uk/documents/200.pdf\n\nFor the 1970s, get his studio and live albums. But there is for example this short-cut:\n\nOriginal Album Classics (Columbia 88697730622) containing his classic albums: Hard Again (Blue Sky PZ 34449, 1977), I’m Ready (Blue Sky JZ 34928, 1978) and King Bee (Blue Sky JZ 37064, 1981).\n\nAlthough I am pretty satisfied (but I can’t be!) with this effort here, I’m going to flag this as „approximate“ as a reminder of how much more work there would be to track down the actual rest:\n\nMuddy Waters‘ complete recordings\n\nMemphis Slim\n\nbirth name John Len Chatman, aka Peter Chatman\n\nLived 1915–1988, recorded 1941–1986\n\nThe Complete Recordings 1940-1941 (EPM 158032)\n\nThe Complete Recordings, Vol. 2: 1946-1948 (EPM 159862)\n\nThe Complete Recordings Vol.3, 1948-1950 (EPM 160142)\n\nThe Complete Recordings, Vol. 4: 1951-1952 (EPM 160392)\n\nThe Come Back (Delmark DE-762, 1952–54)\n\nMemphis Slim U.S.A. (Delmark DE-710, available 1954 United sessions)\n\nRockin‘ the Blues (Charly CD BM 21, 1958/59 VeeJay sessions)\n\nChicago Blues Masters, Vol. 1 (Capitol 7243 8 29375 2 4, 1959 live with Muddy Waters)\n\nV/A-comps:\n\nBlues From Dolphin’s of Hollywood (Ace CDCHD 357, V/A, contains his four 1955 sides)\n\nChicago Piano 1951-1958 (Paula/Flyright FLY CD 31, V/A-comp with his 4 songs from 1957)\n\nNewport Folk Festival: Best of the Blues 1959-68 (Vanguard 193/95-2, V/A, 3 CDs, 3 songs. Lots of other important performers)\n\nSo, this is all the scattered stuff until 1959 – from this point, you’ll have to get the albums, starting with 1959’s\n\nThe Real Boogie Woogie (Folkways FG 3524), but you might want to get Real Gone’s 4 CD set, it’s a great short cut:\n\nSix Classic Albums (Real Gone RGMCD227) containing mentioned The Real Boogie Woogie, At the Gate of Horn (Vee Jay LP-1012, 1959), Memphis Slim and the Real Honky Tonk ( Folkways FG 3535, 1960), Memphis Slim, U.S.A. (Candid CJM-8024, 1961), Alone With My Friends (Battle BM 6118, 1963) and All Kinds of Blues (Bluesville BVLP 1053, 1962).\n\nDon’t forget about the live albums.\n\nMemphis Slim arguably recorded more than any other piano blues man, so this actually isn’t too bad, he’s well documented. Great!\n\nMemphis Slim’s complete recordings\n\nRobert Lockwood Jr.\n\nLived 1915–2006, recorded 1941–2006.\n\n“Lockwood, who was already impatient with the Delta’s traditional blues forms and was spending his nights off tuning into network radio broadcasts by Count Basie and other jazz bands, was about to play a crucial if largely unsung role in modernizing Delta blues. He was the first electric guitarist heard over the radio in the Delta, and the first many younger guitarists in the area heard anywhere. He was the first Delta guitarist to popularize a jazz-influenced, single-string lead guitar style.”\n\n(Palmer, Robert: Deep Blues. New York: Penguin Books 1982, 178.)\n\nMississippi Blues (1935-1951) (Wolf Records WBCD-005, V/A, contains earliest 1941 and 1951 singles)\n\nBlues Is Killing Me (Juke Joint LP 1501, V/A, contains 1 song of 1951)\n\nSweet Home Chicago: The JOB Sessions 1951-1955 (P-Vine PCD-24051, with JOHNNY SHINES). There is a slightly less complete version: Johnny Shines & Robert Lockwood (Paula CD-14)\n\nSunnyland Slim and his Pals – The Classic Sides 1947-1953 (JSP, 4 more 1951 tracks by Lockwood, see under SUNNYLAND SLIM)\n\nand from here, it’s the albums with one more shortcut. You start with 1973’s\n\nSteady Rollin‘ Man (Delmark DD 630)\n\nThen you get this double deal:\n\nComplete Trix Recordings (Savoy Jazz 17312, contains 1974’s Contrasts (Trix 3307) and 1977’s …Does 12 (Trix 3317))\n\nand it’s just the albums and live albums from here on out. Sorry!\n\nThe large gaps in his discography are there because he worked mostly as a sideman in the 1950s and did perform, but simply wasn’t a recording artist, in the 1960s.\n\nSo with only an approximation for his pre-album output:\n\nRobert Lockwood Jr.’s complete recordings\n\nJay McShann\n\nLived 1916–2006, recorded 1941–2001.\n\nBlues from Kansas City (GRP 614), identical to The Chronogical Classics: Jay McShann and His Orchestra 1941-1943 (Classics 740)\n\nThe Chronogical Classics: Jay McShann 1944-1946 (Classics 966)\n\nthese two create overlap with above and each other, but are the next best thing for his 1947-1951 output, though incomplete!\n\nJimmy Witherspoon & Jay McShann (Black Lion BLCD760173)\n\nJumpin‘ the Blues (Proper Records PVCD-131)\n\nfor his late 1940s and especially his solo-1950s output (which is small), there are no complete collections, several singles apparently never appeared on any compilations at all. Fortunately, we’re talking about a dozen tracks total or two dozen maximum.\n\nBut in other sad news, from this point on, it’s just his albums, starting with 1966’s\n\nMcShann’s Piano (Capitol ST 2645)\n\nGood luck, really quite disappointing. The large time-gaps in his solo-recording career exist because he focused on being a sideman for some years, for example for –>Jimmy Witherspoon.\n\nQuite spotty, but the best we can do. Up until 1946 (and still a pretty good bet up until 1951):\n\nJay McShann’s complete recordings\n\nDavid „Honeyboy“ Edwards\n\nLived 1915–2011, recorded 1942–2004.\n\nDelta Bluesman (Earwig / CD4922, 1942/1979/1991)\n\nDelta Blues 1940–1951 (Frémeaux & Associés FA 5030, V/A, contains his two extremely elusive 1950 sides)\n\nThe Sun Blues Box: Blues, R&B and Gospel Music in Memphis (Bear Family / BCD17310, V/A, contains both his 1952 versions of „Sweet Home Chicago“)\n\nDrop Down Mama (Chess / LP-411, V/A, contains his sole 1 track from 1953. Quite essential LP by the way)\n\nCrawling Kingsnake (Testament Records – TCD 6002, 1964–1967)\n\nRamblin‘ On My Mind – A Collection Of Classic Train And Travel Blues (Milestone MLP 3002, V/A, 1 track 1964 – extremely elusive)\n\nThe Complete Blue Horizon Sessions 1967-1969 credited to Fleetwood Mac (Blue Horizon Remastered / 73003-2, contains the two tracks by Edwards from these 1969 sessions)\n\nReally Chicago’s Blues (Adelphi / AD 1005, V/A, creates some overlap but contains unique tracks, 1969)\n\nDon’t Mistreat a Fool (Genes / GCD 9914, 1969 session)\n\nI’ve Been Around (Trix / CD 3319, 1974–1977)\n\nBlues Blues Blues (Roots / SL-518, 1975)\n\nMississippi Delta Bluesman (Folkways / FS 3539, 1979)\n\nFrom West Helena to Chicago (Wolf 120854, V/A, several tracks 1987)\n\nWhite Windows (Evidence / 26039, 1987/88)\n\nThe Best of Mountain Stage Live: Volume Four (Blue Plate Music 004, V/A, 1 track 1992)\n\nHellhound on My Trail: The Songs of Robert Johnson (Telarc / CD-83521, V/A, 1 track, 1999)\n\nShake ‚Em On Down (APO 2010 CD, 1999)\n\nBlues Power – Songs of Eric Clapton (This Ain’t No Tribute) (House of Blues / 51416 1449 2, V/A, 1 track, 1999)\n\nSweet Emotion: The Songs of Aerosmith – Blues on Fire (Heavy Hip Mama HHM-4321-2, V/A, 1 track, 2000)\n\nCrossroads Guitar Festival (Reprise / R2 970378, V/A, 1 track, 2004)\n\nLightning in a Bottle: A Salute to the Blues (Legacy / 517462 2, V/A, 1 track, 2004)\n\nLast of the Great Mississippi Delta Bluesmen: Live in Dallas (The Blue Shoe Project, V/A, 1 track, 2004)\n\nCouldn’t locate the 1991 track „That’s alright“ which is supposedly on „Columbia 472264“)\n\nThis looks a bit stitchy – and maybe it is for the last two decades – but the fact is that Edwards recorded, then didn’t, then did, then did not, then a single in that decade, two sides in another decade… this guy has to be the record-holder of some sorts for really driving the word „revival“ to its semantic limits.\n\nThese are, I think,\n\nDavid „Honeyboy“ Edwards‘ complete recordings\n\nJoe Liggins\n\nLived 1915–1987, recorded 1944–1965.\n\nThis starts nicely in the 1940 and ends in a 1960s mess.\n\nStart with the Classics Series:\n\nThe Chronological Joe Liggins 1944–1946 (Classics 5020)\n\nThe Chronological Joe Liggins 1946–1948 (Classics 5063)\n\nThe Chronological Joe Liggins 1948–1950 (Classics 5108)\n\nThe Chronological Joe Liggins 1950–1952 (Classics 5155)\n\nContinue with this collection, some overlap, but it’s mostly about alternate or unknown takes:\n\nThe Honeydripper: Rare and Unreleased Recordings 1946-1949 (Night Train 7031, 1946–1949)\n\nThen these two very good collections:\n\nJoe Liggins And The Honeydrippers (Specialty 7006 or Ace CDCHD 307, 1950–1954, massive overlap, but includes a take of „Little Joe’s Boogie“ not identical to the other 1950s take, as well as about half a dozen unique numbers like „Freight Train Blues“)\n\nJoe Liggins And The Honeydrippers, Vol. 2: Dripper’s Boogie (Specialty SPCD-7025-2, 1950–1954, overlap continues, but has about half a dozen tracks best available here)\n\nAnd it ends with a nice session album from the early 1960s:\n\nHoneydripper (Mercury MG 20731, 1962 session album)\n\nAbove gives you a very, very complete collection. Now let’s continue with some absurdly detailed stuff.\n\nThe Best of Afrs Jubilee, Vol. 10 (Live) (RST Records 1010, 1945, V/A, includes one live performance of „How Come“ 1945)\n\nLet’s Have A Ball Tonight (Natasha Imports NI 4025, V/A, contains a single unique 1950 take of „Pink Champagne“)\n\nMercury Blues ’n‘ Rhythm Story 1945-1955 (Polygram 528292, V/A, 3 tracks from 1954)\n\ncan’t locate LP/CD for:\n\n„Ham Bone Boogie“ (1949, B-side of „What Is the Reason“)\n\n„Justina“ (1957, backed with „Go Ahead“)\n\n„Tell Me So“ / „In the Wee Hours“ (1960 single, Honeydripper 9011/14)\n\n„House Party“ / „Tell Me So“ (1965 single, Duplex 1004)\n\nConsider this big collection, which is great in itself, but a bit of a nuisance when it comes to completing your collection:\n\nCollection 1944–57 (Acrobat 9061, 1944–1957)\n\nContext: This collection contains between 80 and 90 % of the Classics-series and some tracks from the other compilations – so the overlap is gigantic, but you can’t get this one just to replace all of the others. Yet it does uniquely contain „Go Ahead“ (from the 1957-single), so well, there’s that.\n\nYes! My second attempt to complete this, and it is much better now.\n\nJoe Liggins‘ complete recordings\n\nWynonie Harris\n\nLived 1915–1969, recorded 1944–1964\n\nClassics Series:\n\n1944-1945 (Chronogical Classics 885)\n\nThe Chronogical Classics: Wynonie Harris 1945 – 1947 (Chronogical Classics 1013)\n\nDon’t You Want to Rock? The King & Deluxe Acetate Series (Ace CDTOP2 1124, 1947–1950), this is more than equivalent, better and more complete than 1947-1949 (Chronogical Classics 1139)\n\nThe Chronogical Classics: Wynonie Harris 1950 – 1952 (Chronogical Classics 1289)\n\nWomen, Whiskey & Fish Tails (Ace CDCHD 457, 1951–1957)\n\nLovin‘ Machine (Ace CDCHD 843, 1951–1960)\n\nV/A-compilations:\n\nRoulette Rock & Roll Volume 2 (Sequel Records NEM CD 670; V/A-comp, 6 tracks, 1960)\n\nShoutin‘, Swingin‘ & Makin‘ Love (Chess CHV 412; V/A-comp, 3 tracks, his last 1964 session)\n\nThere are two additional sides he recorded for Atco („Destination Love“ and „Tell a Whale of a Tale“) that have been released on Rock Mr. Blues – The King and Atco Recordings 1949-1956 (Rev-Ola CRBAND19). But mind that title: these are just SOME of his King records and just THESE TWO SONGS from the Atco-single. So it creates massive overlap for just that single. A dark spot on an otherwise nice list, sorry everybody.\n\nWynonie Harris’s complete recordings\n\nCharles Brown\n\nLived 1922–1999, recorded 1944–??\n\nThis box seems to be very rare, very expensive – and actually not complete: The Complete Aladdin Recordings of Charles Brown (Mosaic MD5-153, 1945–1956, 5 CDs, 98 tracks).\n\nWhat you want is this:\n\nThe Classic Earliest Recordings (JSP 7707, 1944–1950, 5 CDs, 120 tracks)\n\nand the sixth and LAST disc of this Classics series (about five songs overlap):\n\nThe Chronogical Classics: Charles Brown 1944-1945 (Classics 894, 22 tracks)\n\nThe Chronogical Classics: Charles Brown 1946 (Classics 971, 22 tracks)\n\nThe Chronogical Classics: Charles Brown 1946-1947 (Classics 1088, 23 tracks)\n\nThe Chronogical Classics: Charles Brown 1947-1948 (Classics 1147, 24 tracks)\n\nThe Chronogical Classics: Charles Brown 1948-1949 (Classics 1210, 24 tracks)\n\nthis one –> The Chronogical Classics: Charles Brown 1949-1951 (Classics 1272, 23 tracks)\n\nThis is all his (and Johnny Moore’s Three Blazers‘) stuff up until 1951. Then there are the following, not quite complete, but pretty comprehensive compilations.\n\nCryin‘ Mercy (Blue Orchid 211, 2 CDs) (redundant first CD, but the second CD chronologically contains many tracks up until 1956)\n\nBlue Over You: The Ace Recordings (Westside WESM 610, unissued tracks 1959–1960)\n\nThe Very Best of Charles Brown (Collectables COL-CD-2891, 2004, has some tracks chronologically from 1960–1963)\n\nI’m sure I’m missing a few things here. And anyway, from the early 1960s on, it gets hard and confusing, you’ll basically have to hunt down his albums and the constantly issued clean-up compilations from here on.\n\nBut up until the late 1950s, these are just about\n\nCharles Brown’s complete recordings\n\nReverend Gatemouth Moore\n\nLived 1913–2004, recorded 1945–1977\n\nCouldn’t find single „Did You Ever Love a Woman?“/“I Ain’t Mad at You Pretty Baby“ (ca. 1945, Gilmore’s Chez Paree 853/4)\n\nCouldn’t find single „Somebody’s Got to Go“/“Jumping at the Chez Paree“ (ca. 1945, Gilmore’s Chez Paree 855/6)\n\nCryin‘ and Singin‘ the Blues (1945/46) (his entire output 1945/46 lacking one possible alternate take)\n\nHey Mr. Gatemouth: Complete King Recordings (1947) (his entire 1947 output)\n\nLe Gospel (1939/1952) (Body&Soul 2439, V/A, contains one 1951-song)\n\nCouldn’t find the 78-b-side „Glory, Glory Hallelujah“ (ca. 1951) on a CD\n\nCouldn’t find 78-single „I’m going through“ backed with „Thank You Jesus“ (ca. 1951) on a CD\n\nCouldn’t find 78-single „Ain’t God Alright“/“Silent Night“ (ca. 1951) on a CD\n\nCouldn’t find single „They Buried Sin – Part 1“ / „They Buried Sin – Part 2“ (ca. 1952) on a CD\n\nRevival! (1957, some sources say 1959/60)\n\nAfter Twenty-One Years (1973 revival-album)\n\nWell, this is spotty, but the spots are known, at least.\n\nReverend Gatemouth Moore’s complete recordings\n\nIvory Joe Hunter\n\nLived 1914–1974, recorded 1933 (one track), 1945–1958.\n\nToo Late, Too Late: Vol 10 – 1926-1951 (Document DOCD-5601, clean-up comp, contains Hunter’s first record, 1933’s „Stack-O-Lee“)\n\n1945-1947 (Chronological Classics 5015, 1945–1947)\n\n1947 (Chronological Classics 5026, 1947)\n\n1947-1950 (Chronological Classics 5049, 1947–1950)\n\n1950-1951 (Chronological Classics 5113, 1950–1951)\n\nBlues, Ballads & Rock ‚N‘ Roll (Ace CDCHD 747, 1954–1958)\n\nThere’s a weird gap of about half a dozen singles from 1952 and also 1957 that don’t seem to have been issued on CD anywhere. Well. This is still a very clean and neat way to get all the rest. So, as availability goes:\n\nIvory Joe Hunter’s complete recordings\n\nJohnny Moore’s Three Blazers\n\nRecorded 1945–1954\n\nJohnny Moore’s Three Blazers: Los Angeles Blues (Complete Recordings 1949 – 1950) (Westside WESD 217, 1949–1950)\n\nJohnny Moore’s Three Blazers: The Modern & Dolphin Sessions 1952-54 (Ace CDCHD 1148, 1952–1954)\n\nFor their earlier recordings, see –>CHARLES BROWN. After Brown left the group, they turned to other vocalists. Most of that stuff you’ll find under –>FLOYD DIXON.\n\nWith the stuff listed under Brown and Dixon, these are probably\n\nJohnny Moore’s Three Blazers‘ complete recordings\n\nLightnin‘ Hopkins\n\nbirth name Samuel John Hopkins\n\nLived 1912–1982, recorded 1946–1981.\n\nAll the Classics: 1946-1951 (JSP 7705, 1946–1951)\n\ncontains among other things The Complete Aladdin Recordings (EMI CDP 7-96843-2, 1946)\n\nLightnin‘ Special: Volume 2 of the Collected Works (JSP 7790, 1951-1956 for Hopkins, but contains late-1950 sides by L.C. Williams, Lil‘ Son Jackson, Manny Nichols, Thunder Smith, Soldier Boy Houston, J.D. Edwards, Ernest Lewis, Frankie Lee Sims)\n\nThe Herald Recordings: 1954 (Collectables COL-CD-5121, 1954 – major overlap with above, but a few unique tracks)\n\nLightnin‘ Hopkins (his 1959 revival album)\n\nThe Tradition Masters (Tradition TCD 1084, 1959), fantastic set, contains both albums for Tradition which are Country Blues (Tradition TLP 1035, 1959) and Autobiography in Blues (Tradition TLP 1040, 1960).\n\nFour Classic Albums: Third Set (Avid Roots – AMSC1363) contains The Rooster Crowed in England (77 LA 12-1, 1959), Lightnin‘ (Bluesville LP 1019, 1960), Lightnin‘ Strikes (Vee-Jay LP 1044, 1962), Last Night Blues (Bluesville BVLP 1029, 1960).\n\nJoel & Lightnin‘ Hopkins (Heritage HLP 1001 or Collector’s Issue C-5530, 1959 – this is an impossible to get, elusive item. There are obscure CD issues on Fourmatt and Reloaded, five really hard to find tracks by Hopkins…)\n\n(1946-1960) (Heritage (E) 77 LA 12-3 or Story of the Blues CD 3524-2) – huge overlap, mainly for two 1959 and 1960 songs: „Tom Moore’s Farm“ and „The Slop“.\n\nBe sure to get these two collections:\n\nLightnin‘ Hopkins & The Blues Summit (World Pacific WP 1296 or Fuel 2000, 302 061 101 2, 1960), with Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, Big Joe Williams\n\nBlues Hoot (DCC Compact Classics DZS 1081 or 100, 1960/1961), with Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, Big Joe Williams. These two collections collect some tracks recorded in slightly shifting combos from one member to all four and everything in between, the original issues are elusive and scattered, the track titles inconsistent, the crediting chaotic – just get these two and you’re set. Don’t worry about: Davon LP 2015, Society (E) LP 1015, Society LP 1020, Society 1009… – these sessions showed up in numerous formats. Focus on these CDs.\n\nMojo Hand: Complete Sessions (P-Vine PCD-5749, 1960, excellent CD, contains the original album plus all other tracks from that session)\n\nThe Complete Candid Otis Spann / Lightnin‘ Hopkins Sessions (Mosaic MD3-139, 1960. split release with Otis Spann–>ROBERT LOCKWOOD on guitar and –>ST. LOUIS JIMMY ODEN takes the vocals on some tracks).\n\nStrikes Again (Collectables COL-CD-5216, 1961, large overlap, at least 2 unique tracks)\n\nLonesome Life (Collectables 5262, 1961, large overlap, only 1 unique track „Good as Old Time Religion“)\n\nThe Little Darlin‘ Sound of Lightnin‘ Hopkins: Lightnin‘ Strikes Twice (Koch KOCCD 9850, 1961–196?, contains among others The Lost Texas Tapes Vol. 4 (Collectables LP 5206, 1964))\n\nLightnin‘ Sam Hopkins (Arhoolie F 1011 – but get the expanded CD: Arhoolie Records PCD-93619, 1961–1962, completing the session and cutting down the number of more Arhoolie output)\n\nRemaining Titles: 1950-1961, Vol.1 (Document DOCD-5609, overlap but unique 1961 track „Hello (Austria)“)\n\nJoel, Lightning & John Henry (Arhoolie CD 340, 1964, credited to The Hopkins Brothers – Lightnin‘ Hopkins with his two brothers!)\n\nThe Swarthmore Concert (OBC CD 563, 1964 live)\n\nSometimes I Believe She Loves Me (Arhoolie CD 451, 1964 live, with Barbara Dane)\n\nCadillac Man (Drive Archive 41004, 1964, contains the entire live sessions Guest Star LP 1459)\n\nThe Complete Prestige/Bluesville Recordings (Prestige Bluesville 7PCD-4406-2, 11 albums from 1961–1965)\n\ncontains: Last Night Blues (Bluesville BVLP 1029, 1961) , Lightnin‘ (Bluesville BVLP 1019, 1961), Blues in My Bottle (Bluesville BV 1045, 1962), Walkin‘ This Road by Myself (Bluesville BVLP 1057, 1962), Lightnin‘ & Co.

Nice.\n\nWake Up the Dead (Cicadelic 6869, 1968–1969), with Billy Bizor\n\nFree Form Patterns (Charly Records J 750, 1968)\n\nShootin‘ Fire (Cicadelic 41169, 1969 session, with one track possibly from 1961)\n\nStrikes Again (Home Cooking HC-S-102, 1968)\n\nBlowing My Blues Away (Home Cooking HCS 111, 1968, by Billy Bizor, featuring Hopkins)\n\nCalifornia Mudslide (And Earthquake) (Vault SLP 129, 1969 album)\n\nLightnin‘ (Poppy PYS 11000, 1969 album)\n\nIn the Key of Lightnin‘ Hopkins (Tomato CD 2098, 1969)\n\nLightning Hopkins in Berkeley (Arhoolie 1063, 1969)\n\nBlues Is My Business (Edsel EDCD 353, live 1971)\n\nYou’re Gonna Miss Me (Edsel EDCD 357, live 1971)\n\nIt’s a Sin to Be Rich (Verve 517 514, 1972)\n\nThe Sonet Blues Story (Verve B007210-02, 1974, technically a reissue of Legacy of the Blues, Vol. 12 (Sonet SNTF 672), adding two tracks)\n\nLightnin‘ Hopkins (Island 1009, 1976, 3 tracks) –> couldn’t locate this one.\n\nLightnin’s Boogie (Just a Memory 9151-2 or Just a Memory RSC 0009, live 1977)\n\nMighty Crazy (Catfish KATCD 225, 1978, split release with Big Mama Thornton)\n\nRising Sun Collection – Louisiana Red, Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee, Lightnin‘ Hopkins (Just a Memory RSC 0011, 1980, split release, 3 tracks)\n\nForever (EPM Blues Collection 157792, 1981 – his last recordings).\n\nV/A-compilations and other:\n\nConversation With The Blues (A Documentary Of Field Recordings) (Decca LK 4664, 1 track 1960. This is an elusive test pressing, the track seems to appear nowhere else).\n\nSing Out With Pete! (Folkways LP 2455, 1960, credited to Pete Seeger, 1 track with Hopkins)\n\nLook, It’s Us! (Jester Records Inc. – J-1, V/A, 1963, 1 track, elusive)\n\nHear Me Howling! Blues, Ballads, and Beyond (Arhoolie CD 518 A-D, V/A, 1963, 1 track „Tom Moore’s Farm“)\n\nThe American Folk Blues Festival 1962-1966 (Hip-O CD B0001030-02, V/A, 1964, 1 track, „Mojo Hand“)\n\nAmerican Folk Blues Festival ’64 (Fontana TL 5225, V/A, 1964, 2 tracks)\n\nGreat Bluesmen: Newport (Vanguard VSD 77/78, 1965, V/A, 2 tracks)\n\nBlues With a Feeling: Newport Folk Festival Classics (Vanguard CD 2-77005, 1965, V/A, 3 tracks)\n\nWell, there we are. Legend has it that Hopkins is the most prolifically recorded blues artist ever: showing up at the studio, refusing to record until paid, then improvising numbers until the contractual obligation was fulfilled (I mean, he was and is the coolest, no competition).\n\nThis list might not be complete – but it’s really the closest I’ll get. So, very approximately:\n\nLightnin‘ Hopkins‘ complete recordings\n\nAfterthought:\n\nThis collection contains four original albums, but they all were reissued with bonus material. This collection is neat, but really incomplete when it comes to all things he recorded during this time:\n\nFour Classic Albums (Avid Roots EMSC 1225, 1959–1962) contains Lightnin‘ and the Blues: The Herald Sessions (Buddha 74465 99782 2, 1959), Country Blues (Rykodisc TCD 3001, 1961), Lightnin‘ in New York (Candid 9010, 1960) and Mojo Hand (Fire FLP-104, 1962).\n\nJohnny Shines\n\nLived 1915–1992, recorded 1946–1991.\n\nChicago Blues, Volume 1, 1939 – 1951 (DOCD-5270, his first six sides from 1946 and 1950. Split release with Alfred Fields and Tony Hollins)\n\nEvening Shuffle (West Side WESM 635, 1952-53, his JOB recordings)\n\nBetween 1953 and 1965 there is a big gap as a recording artist (we know the drill). Shines returns with\n\nChicago / The Blues / Today! Vol. 3 (Vanguard VSD 79219, 1965, V/A, 6 tracks by Shines)\n\nMasters of Modern Blues (Testament 5002, 1966)\n\nWith Big Walter Horton (Testament 5015, 1966, more tracks from that and 1969 session)\n\nBottleneck Blues (Testament 5021, 1966, V/A, one more last track from that 1966 session)\n\nFrom here on out, it’s basically getting the CD-reissues (with additional tracks) of his live and studio albums. I’m listing about as much as I can reasonably scratch together:\n\nLast Night’s Dream (Blue Horizon 7 63212, 1968 session, 1969 album)\n\nReally Chicago’s Blues (Adelphi 1005, 1969 – co-credited to other blues greats)\n\nStanding at the Crossroads (Testament CD 5022, 1970, this reissue listed on RYM as Standing at the Crossroads)\n\nJohnny Shines (Hightone CD 8028, 1970 session, 1974 album)\n\nTraditional Delta Blues (Biograph BCD 121, 1972, reissue of 1972’s Sittin‘ on Top of the World (BLP 12044))\n\nHey Ba-Ba-Re-Bop! (Black and Blue 33.582, 1971, live album)\n\nChicago Blues Festival 1972 (Black and Blue 33.502, 1972)\n\nThe Blues Came Falling Down – Live 1973 (Omnivore OVCD-328, 1973, live archival)\n\nCountry Blues (XTRA 1142, 1974, reissued as „Worried Blues Ain’t Bad“, TBA 13004)\n\nJohnny Shines and Company (Biograph BLP-12048, 1974)\n\nRecorded Live 1974 (Wolf 120.914, 1974 live)\n\nToo Wet to Plow (Blue Labor BL 110, 1975)\n\nLive Recording at Yubin Chokin Hall on March 1975 (Bourbon BMC-2003, 1975 live)\n\n„Live“ in Europe 1975 (DOCD 32207, 1975, live archival)\n\nHangin‘ on (Rounder 2023, 1980, with Robert Lockwood Jr.)\n\nMister Blues Is Back to Stay (Rounder 2026, 1981, with Robert Lockwood Jr.)\n\nBack to the Country (Blind Pig BP 74391, 1991, with Snooky Pryor)\n\nCheck out also the discography of OTIS SPANN for more major appearances by Shines.\n\nI’m reasonably confident that this is a good approximation of his studio as well as his available live output, though the latter is shakier of course. Let’s call it\n\nJohnny Shines‘ complete recordings\n\nAmos Milburn\n\nLived 1927-1980, recorded 1946-1972.\n\nThe Complete Aladdin Recordings of Amos Milburn (Mosaic Records MD7-155, 1946–57, 7 CDs, 124 tracks)\n\nSing My Blues Tonight: The Ace Blues Masters Volume 1 (Westside WESM 530, V/A, 1 song, 1959)\n\nHe recorded three singles in 1960/61 which are not readily available on good compilations. Hm. These are:\n\nPlease Come Home for Christmas / Christmas (Comes But Once a Year) (King 45-5405, other side by CHARLES BROWN, 1960)\n\nMy Sweet Baby’s Love / Heartaches That Make You Cry (King 45-5483, 1961)\n\nMovin‘ Time / The Hammer (King 45-5529, 1961)\n\nWe continue with:\n\nThe Motown Sessions, 1962-1964 (Motown 314 530 611-2, 1962–1964)\n\nR&B Hipshakers Vol. 2: Scratch That Itch (Vampi Soul CD 126, V/A, 1 song, 1967)\n\nR&B Hipshakers Volume 4: Bossa Nova and Grits (Vampi Soul 45064, V/A, 1 song, 1967)\n\nIt gets fuzzy after this. I couldn’t find any solo recordings of Milburn after 1967, but he worked at the very least as a session musician on other records, reportedly dying of a stroke during a session for JOHNNY OTIS.\n\nAnyhow, this is probably almost complete, and for sure until 1967, these are\n\nAmos Milburn’s complete recordings\n\nThe Big Three Trio\n\nConsisted of Willie Dixon, Leonard „Baby Doo“ Caston & Ollie Crawford\n\nRecorded 1946–1952.\n\nThe Big Three Trio (Columbia Roots’N’Blues 467248, 1947–1952, credited to Willie Dixon)\n\nI Feel Like Steppin‘ Out (Dr. Horse RDB 804, 1946–1952)\n\nThese two discs collect about two thirds of their entire output, missing about 16 tracks (not counting this or that alternate take of the songs presented above). The rest, alas, is scattered or elusive. Some tracks appear on this or that sampler, but only very few. I doubt many the following singles have even made it on an LP-compilation, let alone a CD.\n\nAnyway, these are the tracks not on either of the compilations above:\n\n„Lonely Roamin'“, „Get Up Those Stairs, Mademoiselle“, „It Can’t Be Done“, „Baby I Can’t Go On Without You“, „Get Her Off My Mind“, „Till the Day I Die“, „Dry Bones“, „Why Do You Do Me Like You Do“, „Goodbye Mr Blues“, „Cigarettes, Whiskey and Wild Women“, „There’s Something on My Mind“, „Blip Blip“, „Practising the Art of Love“, „Torture My Soul“, „Be a Sweetheart“, „Too Late“\n\nOther than that:\n\nThe Big Three Trio’s complete recordings\n\nSunnyland Slim\n\nbirth name Albert Luandrew\n\nLived 1906–1995, recorded solo 1947–1987(?).\n\nSunnyland Slim is one of the imposing figures – meaning, even when he played as a sideman to one of the bigger stars and recording artists, he is still sometimes credited or co-credited. This makes his „solo“-career a bit messier, depending on the information you follow. Anyhow.\n\nThere is a good JSP set, Sunnyland Slim and his Pals – The Classic Sides 1947-1953 (JSP 7783), with several artists (which might be essential for other reasons), but it is very spotty for Sunnyland Slim, especially compared to the essentially complete Chronogical Classics series. There is also a large collection called 1947 – 1961 (Real Gone CD 293) which is large and budget-priced, but it is nowhere near comprehensive.\n\nSo be sure to start with:\n\nThe Chronological Sunnyland Slim 1947-1948 (Chronological Classics 5013)\n\nThe Chronological Sunnyland Slim 1949-1951 (Chronological Classics 5035)\n\nThe Chronological Sunnyland Slim 1952-1955 (Chronological Classics 5171)\n\nThese have all his stuff as a frontman or „leading sideman“ from the period, except two alternate takes: „I’m Just a Lonesome Man“ and „When I Was Young“.\n\n(compare to 1947 – 1961)\n\nThe Cobra Records Story: Chicago Rock and Blues 1956-1958 (Capricorn 9 42012-2, V/A, 3 tracks from 1956!)\n\nThe La Salle Chicago Blues Recordings – Vol. 2 (Wolf 120.297 CD, V/A, 1 track from 1959!)\n\n… (but get the reissue #Southland CD 10 called Chicago Blues Session, containing the complete 1960 session with LITTLE BROTHER MONTGOMERY)\n\nMeat and Gravy from Bea and Baby (Castle Music 610, V/A, contains 2 tracks from poss. 1960)\n\nChicago Ain’t Nothin‘ But a Blues Band (Delmark 624, V/A, 1960, 2 tracks)\n\nSlim’s Shout: The Blues of Sunnyland Slim (OBC D 26804, 1960 album, bonus track issue)\n\nBlues Piano Orgy (Delmark CD 626, V/A, 1963, 4 tracks)\n\nLive in ’63 ((Varèse Sarabande 302 061 300 2, live 1963, archival, with J.B.

These are 11 tracks. Sunnyland Slim recorded 13 more on that session. The entire session (including the album) is said to be released on a 3-CD-Box with other artists, called\n\nRediscovered Blues, Vol. 2 as part of the „Capitol Blues Collection“, with a catalogue number something like „Capitol CDP 36284 or 724383628421. All this information is online in numerous sources – but all sources point out that no one has ever seen or laid hand on the physical CDs. Most sources assume that Capitol planned and promoted this set (which is why there is specific information) but never actually released it. Anyway, if you find this, you reached the end of the rainbow – let me know!\n\nAll Stars Blues World of Spivey Records (Spivey 1011, V/A, 1969, 1 track)\n\nReally Chicago’s Blues (Adelphi AD 1005, V/A 1969, 3 tracks)\n\nSad and Lonesome (Jewel LPS 5010, 1971 album)\n\nMeat and Gravy – The Best of Cadillac (Castle CMDDD 610, V/A, 1971, 7 tracks)\n\nPlays the Ragtime Blues (Bluesway BLS 6068, 1973 album)\n\nLegacy of the Blues, Vol. 11 (Sonet SNTCD 671, 1973 album)\n\nSunnyland Slim’s Blues Jam With Delta Blues Band (Storyville SLP 245, 1973)\n\nBarrelhouse Blues and Boogie Woogie Vol. 1 (Storyville STCD 8030, V/A, 3 tracks)\n\nBarrelhouse Blues and Boogie Woogie Vol. 2 (Storyville STCD 8044, V/A, 2 tracks)\n\nShe Got A Thing Goin‘ On (Earwig Music CD 4942, 1971–1983)\n\nBlues Reference: Chicago Blues Festival 1974 With Jimmy Dawkins (Black and Blue BB 470, 1974, with Big Voice Odom)\n\nTravelin‘ (Black and Blue BB 433, 1974)\n\nDepression Blues (Festival FLD 648, 1974)\n\nLive in Europe 1975 (Airway AR-SBB 4757, 1975)\n\nLong Tall Daddy (Arcola Records A CD 1006, 1976, with Big Time Sarah)\n\nHeavy Timbre Chicago Boogie Piano (Sirens SR-5002 CD, V/A, 1976, 6 tracks)\n\nThe Blues Wailed in Berkeley (Southland SCD-37, 1976)\n\nSmile On My Face (Delmark DD-735, 1977)\n\nBe Careful How You Vote (Earwig 4915, 1977–1983)\n\nOld Friends (Earwig 4902, 1979, credited to Old Friends)\n\nDecoration Day (L+R CDLR 72007, 1980)\n\nSunnyland Train (Evidence ECD 26066, 1983)\n\nSnake in my Bedroom (Drive 3206, V/A, 1983–1984, aka Chicago Blues Meeting)\n\nNational Downhome Blues Festival, Vol. 1 (Southland SCD-21, V/A, 1984)\n\nChicago Jump (Evidence ECD 26067, 1985)\n\nTenth Anniversary Anthology, Vol. 1 – Live from Antone’s (Antone’s Ant 0004, V/A, 1985, 1 track)\n\nLive at the D.C.

Watch out for those Earwig-releases, they gather a lot of stuff very orderly.\n\nSunnyland Slim’s complete recordings as a frontman or „credited“ sideman\n\nEddie Boyd\n\nLived 1914–1994, recorded 1947–1984 (1993?).\n\nThe compilations of Eddie Boyd’s work are so large and nice while being so outrageously overlapping at the same time that it is almost comical. While they seem rich and thoughtfully done at first („complete“ this, „complete“ that, nice chronology), they basically all feature two or three absolutely unique tracks, while the other two or three dozen overlap with the other collections. It is absolutely flabbergastig, to the point one could say: Any Eddie Boyd collection is great, because none is perfect.\n\nAll these directly below come with HUMONGOUS overlap, among the worst examples of discographical desaster I’ve seen:\n\nEddie Boyd: The Blues Is Here To Stay 1947–1959 (Jasmine JASMCD 3039)\n\nFive Long Years – The Complete Recordings Vol.2, 1951-1953 (EPM 160562, 1951–1953)\n\nRattin‘ and Running Around (Crown Prince IG-400, 1953–1956)\n\nThe Singles Collection 1947-62 (Acrobat ADDCD3250, 1947–1962)\n\nEddie Boyd: Vacation From The Blues (Mojo 2167, 1957–1964)\n\nThe Complete Blue Horizon Sessions (Blue Horizon 82876769682, 1960, 1967/68)\n\nAnd above wraps up his beginnings until the mid-1960s. Now get some scattered V/A-tracks:\n\nI Blueskvarter Chicago 1964, Volume One (Jefferson Records SBACD 12653/4, V/A, 1964)\n\nBlues With a Feeling: Newport Folk Festival Classics (Vanguard VCD2-77005, V/A, 1965, 1 track)\n\nAmerican Folk Blues Festival ’65 (Fontana 885 422 TY, V/A, 1 track, 1965)\n\nThe American Folk Blues Festival 1962-1966 (Hip-O CD B0001030-02, V/A, 1965, 1 track)\n\nAnd from here we’re just out to hunt the albums, starting 1966:\n\nFive Long Years (L+R CDLR 72009, 1965, his 1966 album)\n\nPraise the Blues (Philips XPL 655033, 1967 album)\n\nEddie Boyd and His Blues Band ( Decca / SKL 4872, 1967 album)\n\nPraise to Helsinki (Love LRLP 25, 1970 album)\n\n„Mello‘ Hello!“ (Blue North BNCD 003, 1970 live album)\n\nThe Legacy of the Blues Vol.10 (GNP Crescendo GNPS 10020, 1973/74)\n\nHand in Hand (Blue Angel BA 1, 1978 live album)\n\nEddie Boyd: My Lady (Lobo 002, 1978 live album)\n\nEddie Boyd with Ulli’s Blues Band: Soulful (Magic Angel BA2, 1979 live album)\n\nA Sad Day (Paris Album PLB 2 28509, 1980 album)\n\nLovers‘ Playground (Stockholm RJ-204, 1984 album)\n\n„Live“ in Switzerland 1968 (Storyville STCD 8022, live 1968)\n\nEddie Boyd: for sincere listening (Bluebeat S-77331, live 1968)\n\nBarrelhouse, Blues & Boogie Woogie Vol. 2 (Storyville STCD 8044, 1968, V/A, 1 track)\n\nBarrelhouse Blues and Boogie Woogie Vol. 3 (Storyville STCD 8045, 1968, V/A, 1 track)\n\nNice, but obsolete if all above is acquired:\n\nThe Complete Recordings 1947-1950 (EPM 160002, 1947–1950, major overlap but some unique tracks)\n\nThird Degree (Charly CD BM 42, 1953–1959, major overlap)\n\nCouldn’t locate on LP/CD:\n\n„Tortured Soul“, „Came Home This Morning“, „I’ve Been Deceived“, „Let’s Tie the Knot“, „Nothing“ (Heco 45008)\n\nAnd well, after falling ill, he only appeared at the Chicago Blues Festival 1986 (I haven’t found any indication that a record survived) and he apparently published a gospel-cassette in 1993.\n\nEddie Boyd’s complete recordings\n\nBig Maybelle\n\nBirth name Mabel Louise Smith.\n\nLived 1924–1972, recorded solo 1947–1967.\n\nThe Complete OKeh Sessions 1952-55 (Legacy EK 53417)\n\nThis one has about seven tracks that don’t show up on the following larger collections.\n\nSavoy Blues Legends: Candy! (Savoy 93018-2, 1956–57, 2 CDs, 46 tracks)\n\nmisses 25 tracks that are on this one:\n\nComplete King, Okeh & Savoy Releases 1947-1961 (Acrobat ADDCD3161, 2Cds, 53 tracks)\n\nmisses 18 tracks that are on Savoy Blues Legends, but has more in total. These two compilations share 28 tracks out of 99, so going with both is still the best bet.\n\nBlues In The Night No. 1 (Phontastic PHONT NCD 8815, V/A, 1958, Series Newport Jazz Festival 1958, July 3rd-6th – Vol. III)\n\nYou’ll find two otherwise missing songs „Foolin‘ Blues“ and „Dirty Deal Blues“ on this otherwise redundant compilation:\n\nThe Chronological Classics Blues & Rhythm Series: Big Maybelle 1944-1953 (Chronological Classic 5809, 1944–1953)\n\nBig Maybelle did vocals for the elusive orchestra led by Christine Chatman, so there would be a few additional tracks not in her own discography until 1967.\n\nThis sadly isn’t a completely clean catch, but the two single collections on Savoy and Acrobat are already a terrific start – and if you hunt down the other tracks, you’ll have\n\nBig Maybelle’s complete recordings\n\nClarence „Gatemouth“ Brown\n\nBirth name Clarence Brown Jr.\n\nLived 1924–2005, recorded 1947–2004.\n\nBoogie Uproar: Texas Blues and R&B 1947-1954 (JSP 7758, 4 CDs, V/A, contains Gatemouth’s recordings from this period as well as several other artists!)\n\nBetween 1955 and 1961, Gatemouth recorded about a dozen tracks that are not neatly collected on one compilation. You get most of those on compilations like The Original Peacock Recordings (Rounder 2039, 1948–1959), San Antonio Ballbuster [Drive] (Red Lightnin‘ RL0010, 1948–1959), Gate Walks to Board: 1947-1960 Aladdin & Peacock Sides (Hoodoo 263524, 1947–1960) or Boogie Uproar: The Complete Aladdin/Peacock Singles, As & Bs 1947-1961 (Jasmine JASMCD 3079, 1947–1961) – but none of them has all the tracks and they create absolutely massive overlap with each other and the other records in this list. Unfortunate!\n\nOkie Dokie (Aim Records AIM 1304 CD, most his 1964/65 recordings)\n\nSan Antonio Ballbuster [Charly Blues Masterworks Vol.6] (Charly Records CD BM 6, the remaining 1965 recordings)\n\nYou’ll have to hunt down albums from this point on, starting with 1972’s The Blues Ain’t Nothin‘ (Black and Blue 33033). Gatemouth shuffled in and out of the music business but remained active until his death in 2005.\n\nGive or take a few alternate tracks (and the badly documented period from 1955 to 1965), until 1965 these are\n\nClarence „Gatemouth“ Brown’s complete recordings\n\nRoy Brown\n\nLived 1925–1981, recorded 1947–1972(?)\n\nThe Chronological Roy Brown 1947-1949 (Classics 5021, 1947–1949)\n\nThe Chronological Roy Brown 1950-1951 (Classics 5036, 1950–1951)\n\nThe Chronological Roy Brown 1951–1953 (Classics 5090, 1951–1953)\n\nMighty Mighty Man! (Ace CDCHD 459, his King recordings 1953–1959)\n\nThe Complete Imperial Recordings (Capitol 7243 8 31743 2 4, his Imperial and Capitol recordings 1956–58)\n\nThere’s a weird gap of about a dozen 1960–1963 singles that partly hadn’t been issued, and the rest hasn’t really seen the compilation-light of day.\n\nHard Times (Bluesway BLS-6056, 1973 album with his 1967/68 recordings)\n\nNow, as said, Brown’s work became very obscure, even elusive from the late 1960s onwards, and he only recorded very few additional tracks on extremely obscure, badly documented labels.\n\nApart from the unissued singles, a couple of singles ranging from 1968–1972 (and a few later in the 1970s) haven’t ever been released on compilations at all, only this or that track shows up on V/A-compilations. But apart from these (about two dozen tracks), everything is on this list here.\n\nTo get an idea about his entire discography and the missing singles, compare:\n\nhttp://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/roybrown.htm\n\nBut apart from these and some alternate tracks, these really are\n\nRoy Brown’s complete recordings\n\nLittle Walter\n\nBirth name Marion Walter Jacobs\n\nLived 1930–1968, recorded solo 1947–1968.\n\nThe Complete Chess Masters (1950-1967) (Geffen Records – B0012636-02, 1950–1967, 5 CDs, 126 tracks)\n\nThis is the one to get, all his Chess/Checkers records which is basically 90% of his solo output.\n\nThe following contain the half dozen tracks recorded 1947–49 and single scattered tracks after 1950 not recorded for Chess. All of these create massive overlap, but that’s the way the bee bumbles:\n\nThe Chronological Classics Blues & Rhythm Series: Little Walter 1947 – 1953 (Classics 5091, 1947–1953)\n\nBlues with a feeling [The Essential Blue Archive] (Blue Label SPV 97752, contains a number of early singles credited to other people like Muddy Waters, but composed and sung by Little Walter)\n\nThe Blues World of Little Walter (Delmark DL-648, 1950–51, more obscure stuff)\n\nThe 1949 B-side „I Want My Baby“ (for Tempo-Tone) is nowhere to be found on a CD-compilation, as far as I could tell.\n\nAnyway, the Chess masters box set is just amazing. Just about\n\nLittle Walter’s complete recordings\n\nJohn Lee Hooker\n\nLived 1912 or 1917–2001, recorded 1948–2001.\n\n„Finally, you could go to his earliest recordings. But here Hooker’s deceptiveness gets positively wicked. He sometimes recorded under the name of John Lee Cooker or John Lee Booker or just John Lee – easy aliases to penetrate – but he mixed these up with trickier pseudonyms, „Delta John“ or „Texas Slim“ or „Birmingham Sam“ or „The Boogie Man“ or „Little Pork Chops.“ So many sessions, so many labels, so little information: with John Lee Hooker, even the hard facts of discography take on a suggestive, hypothetical quality.“ (Gioia, Ted: Delta Blues. New York, London: W. W. Norton 2009, 235)\n\nHooker recorded for a myriad labels under about a dozen different names – this makes his pre-album career a collector’s nightmare. Still, let’s see what we can do, just be aware there’s no clean solution.\n\nThere is a quite complete collection by Body & Soul (6 double-CDs):\n\nThe Complete John Lee Hoker, Vol. 1: Detroit 1948–1949 (Body & Soul 3057012)\n\nThe Complete John Lee Hoker, Vol. 2: Detroit 1949 (Body & Soul 3063142)\n\nThe Complete John Lee Hoker, Vol. 3: Detroit 1949–1950 (Body & Soul 3067872)\n\nThe Complete John Lee Hoker, Vol. 4: Detroit 1950–1951 (Body & Soul 3074742)\n\nThe Complete John Lee Hoker, Vol. 5: Detroit 1951–1953 (BS 2500)\n\nThe Complete John Lee Hoker, Vol. 6: Detroit – Miami 1953–1954 (BS 2653)\n\nThese have become extremely rare and partly insanely expensive (when I first wrote this entry, the amazon price for vol. 6 was 1300 dollars, no typo, while vol. 1 stood at 175 dollars. the rest goes for between 25 and 300). Get as much of these as you can afford – anything below 50 is an incredible bargain.\n\nThere’s another basically unattainable one which is nothing short of stunning:\n\nThe Vee-Jay Years, 1955 – 1964 (Charly CD RED BOX 6, 6 CDs, ~300 dollars…)\n\nBut for his early pre-album years, this incomplete set is your best bet:\n\nThe Classic Early Years 1948-1951 (JSP JSPCD7703)\n\nNow, each of the following has a lot of material not on the others, but the factual overlap will be quite large if you get all these. Still, the additional material is always larger than the overlap, so…\n\nAlternative Boogie: Early Studio Recordings, 1948-1952 (Capitol 7243 8 33912 2 6, some overlap, but a lot of stuff not on the above sets)\n\nEarly Years: Classic Savoy Sessions (Metro Doubles METRDCD532, 1948–1959)\n\nThe Modern, Chess & Veejay Singles Collection 1949–62 (Acrobat Music ACQCD7103, 1949–1962, 4 CDs, creates some overlap but very good collection.)\n\nIf you’re fed up with this kind of stuff, you might want to get this 50-year-overview:\n\nHooker (Shout! Factory / 826663-10198, career-spanning 4 CD set)\n\nAfter 1960, you’ll have to get the albums, that’s when they started to issue those.\n\nWell, this isn’t neat and by no means complete, but for the effort I’m going to reward myself and call these\n\nJohn Lee Hookers‘ esssential recordings up until 1960\n\nFrankie Lee Sims\n\nLived 1917–1970, recorded solo 1948–1960.\n\nThis is an easy, if slightly haphazard three-step-journey.\n\nJuke Joints, Vol. 4: That’s All Right with Me (JSP 77168, V/A, 4 CDs, collects numerous artists, but is probably a most reliable place to get Sims‘ first four sides from 1948).\n\nThen the biggest chunk of his work is right here:\n\nMasterly Texas Blues – Music With a Swagger (JSP CD 4217, 1953–1957, split release with Mercy Dee Walton)\n\nThis contains the entire 1970-collection Lucy Mae Blues (Ace CDCHD 423, 1953–1954: all of his recordings for Specialty).\n\nWalkin‘ With Frankie (Aim 1089, 1960, CD-reissue of Walkin‘ With Frankie: (Unissued Cuts From 1960), Krazy Kat 7428, a formerly elusive session that saw the light of day in 1985).\n\nNice. Aside from alleged and dubitable work as a sideman, this is a pretty concise thing with a clearly essential collection from JSP.\n\nFrankie Lee Sims‘ complete recordings\n\nAnnie Laurie\n\nLived 1924–2006, recorded 1948–1962.\n\nGiven the fact she had some R&B hits, this woman is mightily bad documented. Below are just compilations I could find that do not seem to have any overlap. Most of these don’t have publishing dates etc. Weird.\n\nCreole Gal (Route 66 KIX 8, 1948–1949, with Paul Gayten)\n\nIt Hurts to Be in Love! (Sing 1155, vinyl only, has some tracks not on the following CD, but much less in total)\n\nIt Hurts to Be in Love (Official CD 9138, 26 tracks on the CD reissue)\n\nNothing But the Blues (Palace M-793, with the Specs Williams Quartet)\n\nV/A-compilations:\n\nRegal Records In New Orleans (Ace CD 362, V/A-compilation)\n\nLadies Sing The Blues – Volume 2 (Savoy SJL-2256, V/A-compilation, 3 tracks)\n\nThe OKeh Rhythm and Blues Story 1949-1957 (Epic E3K 48912, V/A, 1 track)\n\nCan’t find these singles noted in Fancourt/McGrath’s Blues Discography on any CD- or LP-compilation : „I Don’t Get My Kicks Anymore“, „I Ain’t Go It Bad No More“, „I’m Tired (of Waitin‘ For You)“, „Leave It To Me“, „Wild and Wooly“.\n\nThere is very minor overlap between this or that noted compilation above. For an overview, compare http://www.rocky-52.net/chanteursl/laurie_a.htm\n\nApart from those noted missing, these are\n\nAnnie Laurie’s complete recordings\n\nForest City Joe\n\naka Forrest City Joe, birth name Joe Bennie Pugh\n\nLived 1926–1960, recorded 1948 and 1959.\n\nDownhome Delta Harmonica (Deltacat 1003, split release with –>Polka Dot Slim)\n\nForest City Joe’s complete recordings\n\nB.B. King\n\nLived 1925–2015, recorded 1949–2014.\n\nThis is a bit of a mess and there is really no way to get everything, even from his early years, in a neat and concise way.\n\nKing recorded around ~250 songs on the Modern Records labels (Crown/Kent/RPM) between 1949 and 1962 (an estimation but an educated one). So his early work is large but manageable. While he recorded nothing but singles for eight years, the labels started putting out „albums“ (mostly collecting published singles), thirteen in number. These already had minor overlaps among themselves.\n\nACE Records reissued ten of these albums with extensive bonus tracks. If you hunt down the ACE reissues one by one, you’ll have a historically important, excellently made collection with 184 tracks total (and very minor overlaps – I haven’t counted precisely, but no more than four or five songs seem to show up twice). Despite the extensive bonus tracks, there are still dozens of published singles from this era that aren’t on here (but are on Option 3 below, for example).\n\nBut there are several ways to get about 90% of his early output in sets, so I’ll just list those with their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nOption 1\n\nThe Complete RPM-Kent Recording Box 1950-1965 (P-Vine Records PCD-LP-3/20, 234 CD-tracks, but many alt. takes etc.)\n\nIf you want to indulge yourself with 17 CDs, an LP, alternate takes, incomplete takes etc. you’ll have to get Bear Family’s The Complete RPM-Kent Recording Box 1950-1965.\n\nPro: This obviously does have next to all published sides for RPM/Kent recorded in that time span and it is by far the largest set. No other set can even remotely touch this one in terms of completeness.\n\nContra: It costs an insane amount of money (+400), and at least B.B.’s two earliest singles (recorded for Bullett!) are not here. Neither are many of the tracks that were recorded back then but not released, but which do show up as bonus tracks on re-issued albums and, to some degree, the other options here.\n\nOption 2 (recommended)\n\nMilestones of a Blues Legend (Documents 600267, 182 tracks, 1949–1962)\n\nThis is a Document box set with his first ten albums. Two of these are rare and haven’t been readily issued on CD! It fills some of the gaps of Option 3.\n\nPro: contains two albums that were never actually re-issued on CD before: Compositions of Duke Ellington and Others (rare) and the entire Twist With B.B. King. To be taken with a grain of salt though, see below. Also, all the ten albums come with a plethora of necessary bonus tracks… but different bonus tracks than the ACE reissues.\n\nContains the albums Singin‘ the Blues (Crown CLP 5020), The Blues (Crown CLP 5063), B.B. King Wails (Crown CLP 5115), Sings Spirituals (Crown CLP-5119), Compositions of Duke Ellington and Others (Crown CLP-5153), King of the Blues (Crown CLP 5167), My Kind of Blues (Crown CLP-5188), Blues for Me (United US 7708, aka More B.B.King), Easy Listening Blues (Crown CLP-5286) and Twist With B.B. King (Crown CLP 5248).\n\nThis is the largest of the affordable sets I’ve found! I recommend it. It’s really quite cheap and I think it’s worth the overlap with other sets.\n\nContra: It has to be said that the Duke Ellington-album is actually by conductor Maxwell Davis and features King on vocals on only one track (the rest is just instrumental big band) – it gets credited to King purely to get attention. The „Twist with“-album is a compilation consisting entirely of previously released songs (some changed titles) available on the other albums of this set. So they are historically accurate regarding the publishing history, but musically quite pointless.\n\nAlso, a few tracks show up twice, for instance as an album track and (sometimes retitled) bonus track. This reflects King’s erratic publishing history from that period, but it’s a bit of a downer. Still, it’s the best you can get for the money.\n\nAs opposed to Option 3, misses the complete Blues in My Heart (Crown 5309, 10 songs) and misses one song of The Great B.B. King (Crown US-7728). Also misses about 6 additional tracks. So: has more tracks total than Option 3, but misses about 17 (?). Last but not least, this edition uses tracks that have better OR worse mastering than other compilations, for example Option 3 has better sound for some songs.\n\nOption 3\n\nComplete Recordings 1949-1962 (Enlightenment EN6CD9055, 168 tracks)\n\nThis contains dozens of singles and ten early albums/compilations with different sequencing: Singin‘ the Blues , The Blues, B.B. King Wails, Sings Spirituals, King of the Blues, My Kind of Blues, The Great B.B. King, Blues for Me (aka More B.B.King), Blues in My Heart (aka A Heart Full of Blues), Easy Listening Blues (as well as six cuts of Twist With B.B. King – but only because these were already on other albums).\n\nPro: You can get the album Blues in My Heart on this (missing on Option 2) and contains dozens and dozens of singles that aren’t on the ten mentioned albums – most of those are on the bonus tracks of the ACE reissues and on Option (2) though. This has about at least ~20 tracks that are not on Option(2), but fewer tracks overall.\n\nIt seems to be completely chronological, is super-low budget (like under 20 Dollars) while still being okay quality considering the package. Sound is pretty good.\n\nIt is one of the largest of the affordable sets, has slightly better sound quality in certain spots than Option (2), but is overall less satisfying. I’d personally go with Option(2), even though that one has some sound problems on a few tracks.\n\nContra: There really is no consistency to what made the cut here in what order. There are all kinds of labels, this or that elusive track that didn’t make it on any of the other sets here… but there’s no system. It’s a (very large) grab bag. There are even some songs that appear TWICE (under different alternative titles). This is a common theme for B.B.’s publishing history from that period.\n\nAs opposed to Option(2), explicitly missing are the four tracks to complete Twist with B.B. King (though they probably do appear here under their original titles, check my statement above), all but two or three tracks from B. B.King Sings Compositions Of Duke Ellington & Others (rare!) and some (partly obscure) singles from this period, you can read about it here:\n\nhttp://www.bluesblastmagazine.com/b-b-king-complete-recordings-1949-1962-album-review/\n\nThat review’s assessment has some errors though: 5 of the 32 songs claimed missing are actually on the set (title differences…).\n\nConsidering the package: It’s okay quality visually and materially, but of course zero effort went into the presentation: No recording dates, no actual liner notes. You know the budget drill. Still, this is a good buy.\n\nOption 4\n\nThe Complete Singles As & Bs: 1949-62 (Acrobat Music ACFCD7504, 123 tracks)\n\nPro: contains 11 tracks not on Option 3, even has some that aren’t on Option 2. Well made packaging.\n\nContra: misses 17 tracks that are on Option 3, a lot less tracks than Option 2.\n\nOption 5\n\nThe Vintage Years (Ace ABOXCD 8, 106 tracks)\n\nThis seems to be very nice looking set from 2002.\n\nPro: It contains at least two songs that weren’t anywhere to be found on Option 2–4.\n\nContra: Stretches further into the late 1960s (so has more tracks from that era on the last CD), but isn’t nearly as complete as the other options, especially missing the early years.\n\nNow, obviously King’s story didn’t end here, but up until about 1962, the recommended sets here are the best way to get something approximating\n\nB.B. King’s complete recordings (until 1962)\n\nBig Jay McNeely\n\nLived 1927–2018, recorded 1949–2018.\n\nThis isn’t an easy case, as McNeely doesn’t appear in professional „blues“ discographies very reliably – his recordings were either too rhythm&blues, too jazz, too rock’n’roll for the holy purists of cataloguing things. McNeely also has a very weird career – a star in the 1950s and (to a degree) early 1960s, he stopped recording until the 1980s (where things picked up again).\n\nAnyway: This is probably spotty, but it’s the most I could do. His early phase is probably represented reasonably well here.\n\nThe Chronological Big Jay McNeely 1948-1950 (Classics 5009)\n\nThe Chronological Big Jay McNeely 1951-1952 (Classic 5058)\n\nThe Chronological Big Jay MnNeely 1953–1955 (Classics 5170)\n\nNervous! (Saxophile Records SCD-103, 1951-57)\n\nCrazy (Saxophile Records SCD-105, 1949–1957)\n\nThere Is Something on Your Mind (Collectables 6377). Contains: Swingin‘ (Big J JLP-103, 1957–1961) and Live at Birdland 1957 (Big J JLP-108, 1957).\n\nRecorded Live at Cisco’s, Manhattan Beach, Calif. (Warner Bros. W 1523, live 1962, p. 1963)\n\nAnd now his comeback albums and later career:\n\nFrom Harlem to Camden (Ace CH 111, 1984) – his comeback album\n\nAZ Bootin‘ (Big J JLP-107, 1988).\n\nBlow the Wall Down (Ornament CHCD-7.543, 1990)\n\nCherry Pie (Big J-Records JCD-112, 1996) with Dana Gillespie\n\nSaxy Boogie Woogie (Vagabond Records VRCD 8.08033, 2008) with Axel Zwingenberger\n\nLive in Switzerland (Big Jay McNeely Masters 2009, digital file)\n\nI’m Still Here: Big Jay Sings The Blues (Cleopatra CLOCD1083, 2018)\n\nThis is a pretty good approximation of\n\nBig Jay McNeely’s complete recordings\n\nFats Domino\n\nBirth name Antoine Dominique Domino Jr.\n\nLived 1928–2017, started recording 1949\n\nOut of New Orleans (Bear Family / BCD 15541, 8 CDs, goes for about 100-300 right now)\n\nThis contains almost everything from 1949–1962, except for these tracks:\n\n„Domino Stomp (Twistin‘ the Stomp)“ on The Chronological Fats Domino 1953 (Classics 5095, 1953)\n\n„My Heart’s in Your Hands“ and „Are You Going My Way“ on album Fats Domino Rock and Rollin‘ (Imperial LP-12388, 1956 recordings)\n\n„Just a Little While (to Stay Here)“ and „When You’re Smiling“ on Let’s Dance With Domino (Imperial LP-9239)\n\nI don’t know why these didn’t make it on the Bear Family compilation. They’re also missing on the respective issues of the Chronological Classics Series, which is otherwise excellent and maybe the cheaper option, IF you can find them. But they only reach until 1958. So… anyhow, the Chronological Classics series is still a bit better for the respective years than the „Imperial Singles“ volumes as those only collect his Imperial singles, not the (very few) other tracks.\n\nHere’s the list of the Classics Series that you might want to skip in favour of the Bear Family collection.\n\nThe Chronological Fats Domino 1949-1951 (Classics 5025)\n\nThe Chronological Fats Domino 1951-1952 (Classics 5060)\n\nThe Chronological Fats Domino 1953 (Classic 5095, see above)\n\nThe Chronological Fats Domino 1954-1955 (Body & Soul 5301)\n\nThe Chronological Fats Domino 1955-1957 (Body & Soul 5302)\n\nThe Chronological Fats Domino 1957-1958 (Body & Soul 5303)\n\nThe Chronological Fat Domino 1958 (Body & Soul 5304)\n\nThings pick up again here:\n\nThe Imperial Singles Volume 5, 1962-1964 (Ace CDCHD 1323, this stretches the Imperial works from 1962 to 1964).\n\nFrom 1964 onwards, there are a few large collections, but none of them is complete – you’ll need to seek out his albums and probably myriads of anthologies. Okay then.\n\nUntil 1964,\n\nFats Domino’s complete recordings\n\nFloyd Dixon\n\nLived 1929–2006, recorded 1949–1996(?)\n\nNow, the bad news is that (apart from some unissued tracks), quite a number of Dixon’s singles have never been put on a compilation some others are scattered on several V/A-comps (not listed here). And some compilations even just appeared as vinyl-LPs (on Bear Family).\n\nBut the bulk of his work (with some minor overlaps) is available on these few compilations:\n\nCow Town Blues: The Seminal 1948-50 Recordings (Ace CDCHD 740, 1948–1950)\n\nHis Complete Aladdin Recordings (Capitol 7243 8 36293 2 9, 1949–52)\n\nMarshall Texas Is My Home (Specialty SPCD 7011-2, 1953–57)\n\nEmpty Stocking Blues ( Route 66 KIX-27)\n\nWake Up and Live! (Alligator ALCD 4841, 1996 live)\n\nI guess this is as convenient as it gets, so just about\n\nFloyd Dixon’s complete recordings\n\nProfessor Longhair\n\nBirth name Henry Roeland Byrd\n\nLived 1918–1980, recorded 1949–1980\n\nMardi Gras In New Orleans: Complete Recordings 1949-1962 (Jasmine 2013)\n\nWell, that is neat, isn’t it. There are other good sets (from 1949-57 and so on) which are less complete – of course Jasmine Records knows what they’re doing.\n\nFrom this glorious start, it descends into an unholy mess very quickly. Let’s see what the hell of anthologies and V/A-compilations has in stock for us:\n\nFess: The Professor Longhair Anthology (Rhino R2 71502, creating massive overlap in all directions, has some more mid-60s singles, MISSES the B-side „Bald Head“ from 1963)\n\nThe Best of Louisiana Music: Over 60 Minutes of the Best Mardi Gras Party Music! (Rounder CD AN 08, V/A, adds 1 more song „Big Chief, Pt. 1“, not on the above…)\n\nNew Orleans Soul ’60s: Watch Records (Mardi Gras Records MG 1047, V/A, provides 2 more sides plus 1 alternate „Big Chief“ cut from 1964)\n\nAnd that’s it until 1964! Except the 1963 take of „Bald Head“ which seems not to have made it on and CD or LP.\n\nAs many others that somehow didn’t get caught up in the folk revival, our professor had to drop out of music in the late 1960s, becoming a janitor. His career was revived through the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 1971 (there’s no record) – and it’s the albums and festival appearances from that point on, starting with 1974’s Rock ’n‘ Roll Gumbo (Blue Star 80.606) which wasn’t issued until 1977. His first reappearance on record after 1964 would be 1976’s V/A-comp New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival 1976 (Island ISLD 9424).\n\nWith those last two mentions, until 1976, these are\n\nProfessor Longhair’s complete recordings\n\nJoe Hill Louis\n\nLived 1921–1957, recorded 1949–1957.\n\nAs is common with weirdos, Joe Hill Louis‘ discography is bits and pieces, but there’s a surprisingly consistent way to get virtually all of it. Start with this JSP-set:\n\nKing Of The One Man Bands – Key Postwar Cuts 1949-1954 (JSP 4208, 1949–1954, 2 CDs). This is a set that covers his entire and basic output, only leaving out a few important cuts available elsewhere (it’s been done by people in the know, after all) and missing some alternate takes.\n\nThe Be-Bop Boy (Bear Family BCD 15524, 1952-1953). This used to be the first sizeable collection and has overlap with the one above, but gives you important recordings for the Sun label that the later JSP-set leaves out (since available here).\n\nBoogie in the Park (Ace CDCHD 803, 1950-1953). We’re in deep overlap territory with the jSP-set here, but it does have a few numbers not available there. It’s a bit unfortunate.\n\nOther than that, there are some elusive singles of his later career that are traceable but never made it on CD, apparently, like his last 1957-record „Glamour Girl / Keep Your Arms Around Me“.\n\nA tiny bit spotty, some overlap, but overall a nice and easy way to get 95% of his output with no worries.\n\nJoe Hill Louis‘ complete recordings\n\nBig Mama Thornton\n\nBirth name Willie Mae Thornton\n\nLived 1926–1984, recorded 1950–1980(?)\n\nThe Essential Recordings (Primo PRMCD 6212, 1950–1961)\n\ncontains: The Chronological Classics Blues & Rhythm Series: Big Mama Thornton 1950 – 1953 (Classics 5088, 1950–1953)\n\nHound Dog – The Peacock Recordings ( MCA 10668 overlap, 1 additional track from 1955)\n\nThen there’s this completely unfortunate constellation:\n\nIf I Have To Wreck L.A.: Kent & Modern Records – Blues Into The 60s Vol.2 (Ace CD 1577, V/A, 1 side from the elusive 1965-single Before Day / Me and My Chauffeur)\n\n20 Great Blues Recordings of the 50s and 60s, Vol. 1 (Cascade Records 1005, V/A, has the other side from that single)\n\nCouldn’t locate:\n\nSotoplay 0033-single „The Truth’ll Come to the Light / Summer Time“\n\nSotoplay 0039 „Tomcat“\n\nSotoplay 0050 „Mercy / Yes I Cried“\n\nSpeed 851 „You Don’t Need Me / Checkin‘ Out“\n\nMovin 144 „There ain’t nothin‘ you can do Pt. 1 / There ain’t nothin‘ you can do Pt. 2“\n\nMovin 145 „Don’t do me this way / Let’s go get stoned“\n\nHere we go again:\n\nThe American Folk Blues Festival 1962-1969 Volume 2 (Hip-O / B0003224-02, V/A, 1965, 1 track)\n\nIn Europe (Arhoolie F 1028 / Arhoolie CD 9056, 1966 album)\n\nWith the Muddy Waters Blues Band – 1966 (Arhoolie CD 9043, 1966 album)\n\nJohn Hammond’s Spirituals to Swing 30th Anniversary Concert (1967) (Columbia G 30776, 1967 V/A, 3 tracks)\n\nAll Night Long They Play the Blues (Fantasy D 41361, 1967, V/A, contains 2 single sides „Because It’s Love / Life Goes On“)\n\nBall and Chain (Arhoolie 1039, 1968, 3 tracks, split release with Larry Williams and Lightnin‘ Hopkins)\n\nStronger Than Dirt / The Way It Is. (Charly / CDX 24), twofer, contains:\n\nStronger Than Dirt (Mercury SR 61225, 1969 album) and\n\nThe Way It Is (Mercury SR 61249, rec 1969, 1970 album).\n\nThe Blues… A Real Summit Meeting (Buddah BDS 5144, 1973 Newport Jazz Festival with Muddy Waters, B.B. King, and Eddie „Cleanhead“ Vinson)\n\nThe Complete Vanguard Recordings: Big Mama Swings contains Jail (Vanguard VSD 79351, 1975 live album), Sassy Mama [live in Montreal] (Just a Memory JAM 9154-2, 1975 live album) and more from that 1975-session. These 1975-recordings are her last proper studio recordings and releases. From this point until her death in 1984, she played festivals and made TV-appearances, only a few of those performances have been released on record:\n\nSan Francisco Blues Festival Vol. 3 (SS-8011, V/A, 3 tracks, 1979)\n\nand maybe there’s this or that additional track – I don’t know.\n\nAnd there this CD, posthumously released 2002:\n\nMighty Crazy (Catfish KATCD225FP, with Lightnin‘ Hopkins. According to discogs „Most probably recorded 19th June, 1978 at the „Juneteenth Blues Spectacular“, Miller Outdoor Festival, Houston, Tx.“)\n\nWhat can I say, this gets spotty in the mid-1960s since she recorded for obscure and badly preserved labels, and it get spotty in the mid-1970s until her death, because she played this song or two at scattered festivals whose publishing history is always difficult to follow – admittedly, this is a general problem of the myriad of blues festival and Various-Artists-records that document them.\n\nSo all in all, not too bad. Especially that „Essential“-CD collecting her early stuff is a trove.\n\nBig Mama Thornton’s complete recordings\n\nJ.B. Lenoir\n\nLived 1929–1967, recorded 1950–1967.\n\nA bit tricky.\n\nThere are valiant archival label-oriented discs, for example.\n\nHis JOB recordings 1951-1954 (Flyright FLYCD 04, 21 tracks), The Parrot Sessions [Expanded Edition] (Re Records 545 450 598-2, 13 tracks), and (six songs overlapping with the latter), The Chronological J. B. Lenoir 1955–1956 (Classics Records 5184, 19 tracks).\n\nThese quite elegantly cover his singles output from 1950 to 1956 – okay.\n\nThere are other, extremely elusive (and incomplete) compilations I couldn’t check out, such as The Mojo: The JOB, Vee-Jay, and USA Recordings (P-Vine PCD-24161, 22 tracks). This Japanese CD additionally has the promo-single I Sing Um the Way I Feel / I Feel So Good which isn’t on any of the others.\n\nThe 1966-single Mojo Boogie / I Don’t Care What Nobody Say is on some random compilations, like Fine Blues (Official 6049) or The Topical Bluesman: From Korea to Vietnam (Blues Encore CD 52017).\n\nIt’s a bit frustrating really: There is no smart way to get all singles and all alternate takes without massive overlaps.\n\nBut anyway, most of these largely seem to have been replaced by this 2015-compilation:\n\nI Wanna Play a Little While – The Complete Singles Collection 1950-1960 (Jasmine 809, double disc, 58 tracks).\n\nThis is a complete SINGLES collection, meaning it mostly has published sides. About three or four alternate takes available on the J.O.B. issue are missing. Still, this collection is the way to go.\n\nThen there’s an archival live album:\n\nLive in ’63(Varèse Sarabande 302 061 300 2, live 1963, archival, with Sunnyland Slim)\n\nBut most importantly, there is this absolutely essential, mind-blowing acoustic stuff:\n\nVietnam Blues: The Complete L+R Recordings (Evidence ECD 26068)\n\ncontaining his two studio albums: Alabama Blues (Scout Sc-5, 1965) and Crusade (Polydor 24-4011, 1970, posthumous).\n\nAnd that, give or take some alternate tracks, would be\n\nJ.B. Lenoir’s complete recordings\n\nEarl Hooker\n\nLived 1929–1970, recorded 1952–1970\n\nThis starts out with a lot of scattered V/A-compilations and doesn’t become reasonable until about 1960. Well, well well.\n\nSings Blues 16 Selections – Every One a Pearl (CD CHARLY 245, 1960 compilation – four of the tracks are the earliest Earl sides, wrongly credited to John Lee Hooker. Sadly, quite the fitting introduction to the slide genius’s career…)\n\nEarl Hooker and His Blues Guitar (Blue City Records, BCCD-1325) (incredibly elusive, very essential)\n\nMessin‘ With the Kid (CD CHARLY 219, with Junior Wells, CD reissue contains Hooker tracks)\n\nBlue Guitar: The Chief / Age / U.S.A. Sessions 1960-1963 (P-Vine PCD-24045, the first proper collection. Phew. This is the one to get for sure by the way.)\n\nSimply the Best (MCA MCAD-11811, good compilation, contains tracks not on the above)\n\nV/A-comps:\n\nRockin‘ the Blues [Rockin‘] (CD – Hot Productions #5502) (V/A-comp)\n\nThe Sun Blues Box: Blues, R&B and Gospel Music in Memphis (Bear Family BCD17310, V/A-comp)\n\nThe Sun Blues Archives Volume 1: Blue Guitar (Charly Records Ltd. ‎– SUN 1060, Sun (9) ‎– SUN 1060) (V/A-comp)\n\nChess Rhythm & Roll (Chess CHD4-9352, V/A-comp)\n\nThis is everything up to 1963!\n\nFrom here, it’s basically his albums / compilation albums:\n\nThe Genius of Earl Hooker (Cuca KS-3400, 1964-67 album)\n\nPlay Your Guitar Mr. Hooker! (Black Top 0641093, 1964-67 compilation)\n\nTwo Bugs and a Roach (Arhoolie CD 324, 1969)\n\nThe Moon Is Rising (Arhoolie CD 468, 1968/69)\n\nEarl Hooker, Little Walter & Muddy Waters: At Pepper’s Lounge, Chicago (Rarities No. 25, recorded at Pepper’s Lounge, Chicago on May 1, 1969)\n\nFunk. Last of the Great Earl Hooker (Blues on Blues BOB 10002, 1972 [1969])\n\nSweet Black Angel (Blue Thumb BTS 12, 1969)\n\nDon’t Have to Worry (Bluesway BLS-6032, 1969)\n\nHooker and Steve (Arhoolie 1051, 1970)\n\nAmerican Folk Blues Festival ’69 (Scout ‎– ScS-6, 1969, V/A-comp)\n\nNow, some singles hadn’t been issued, some singles never made it on any LP or CD. But all you can reasonably find is here, it’s about 99,5% of his output as a frontman. Pretty neat, pretty neat. Pretty cool, pretty cool.\n\nEarl Hooker’s complete recordings\n\nJunior Parker\n\nLived 1932–1971, recorded 1952–1971.\n\nNext Time You See Me…And All The Hits – The Complete Singles 1952-1962 (Jasmine JASMCD 3057)\n\nJunior’s Blues: The Duke Recordings, Vol. 1 (MCA Records, MCD10669, overlap, but more Duke sides)\n\nBacktracking: The Duke Recordings, Vol. 2 (MCA Records, MCAD-11786, overlap, some more Duke sides)\n\nDriving Wheel (DUKE DLP-76, 1962 album)\n\nSometimes Tomorrow My Broken Heart Will Die (Bluesway BLS-6066, 1966 session)\n\nI’m So Satisfied: The Complete Mercury & Blue Rock Recordings (Mercury 314 558 549-2, 1966–68)\n\nAnd from here it is the albums, starting with 1969’s\n\nBlues Man (Minit LP 24024)\n\nBut beware: Several of his late 1960s/early -70s albums came out under two different titles! Just get one of each, preferably the one with the cooler cover art.\n\nSurprisingly, Junior Parker’s Duke years (his most prolific label output) is neither neatly nor comprehensively collected. Several single sides seem not to have made it on any LP or CD, quite baffling:\n\nMISSING: „Last night“ (1962 B-side)\n\n„If You Don’t Love Me / I Can’t Forget About You“ (1962 single)\n\n„I’m Gonna Stop“ (1963 B-Side)\n\n„That’s Why I’m Always Crying“ (1964 B-Side)\n\n„I’m in Love“ (1964 B-Side)\n\n„Guess You Don’t Know (The Golden Rule)“ (1964 B-Side)\n\n„Why Do You Make Me Cry“ (1965 side) „Walking The Floor Over You“ (1966 side)\n\nOther than that,\n\nJunior Parker’s complete recordings\n\nJohnny „Guitar“ Watson\n\nLived 1935–1996, recorded 1952–1994.\n\nThe Chronological Johnny Guitar Watson 1952-1955 (CLASSICS 5172, 1952–55)\n\nGonna Hit That Highway: The Complete RPM Recordings (P-Vine Records – PCD-3026/27, 1954–1961)\n\nHot Just Like TNT: The Best of His Early Years (Ace – CDCHD 621, 1954–1958)\n\nPosin‘ – More Singles (Jasmin JASCD1035, 1959–1962)\n\nUntouchable!

Mediocre News: All of these have massive overlap. Bad News: A few of his last singles have not made it onto compilations! But it’s about four to six tracks.\n\nAt least until 1967:\n\nJohnny „Guitar“ Watson’s Complete Recordings\n\nLowell Fulson\n\nLived 1921–1999, recorded 1953–1995.\n\nClassic Cuts 1946 to 1953: The Early Recordings of One of the Biggest Talents in the Blues (JSP / JSP7728 or JSP77207, 4CDs, contains almost everything until 1952, despite its title. Misses about 9 songs and very few alternate takes)\n\nMissing songs are: wicked old world, down beat shuffle, bad luck blues, i’m going away, three o’clock in the morning, there is a time for everything, raggedy daddy blues, goodbye baby, black gold\n\nI’m A Night Owl, Vol.2 (Acrobat ACR291, overlap, but adds the remaining half dozen 1953/54 recordings)\n\nThe Complete Chess Masters (Chess / CHD2-9394, 1954–1963) – the complete Chess recordings in chronological order. I love these kind of sets.\n\nThe Complete Kent Recordings 1964-1968 (P-Vine Records 3066/9) – and again: his entire Kent catalogue including the albums up to that point. This is going splendidly.\n\nI’ve Got the Blues & Then Some: 1969-1971 (Westside / WESD 234, Jewel/Kent sides 1969–1971)\n\nAnd from here, you need to get the albums, starting with 1975’s The Ol‘ Blues Singer (GS 1006)– except 1978s Lovemaker (PCD-22309), which you should get on\n\nThe Final Kent Years )(Ace / CDCHD 831). This creates some overlap with the late-1960s collections but adds the album and some previously unreleased stuff.\n\nPretty neat. Reconsider Lowell.\n\nLowell Fulson’s complete recordings\n\nJimmy Reed\n\nLived 1925–1976, recorded 1953–1976.\n\nThe Vee-Jay Years (Charly CD RED BOX 9)\n\nThis is the one, all his stuff from 1953–65. A bit pricy, but worth it, there is no better way.\n\nFrom here, it’s the albums starting with 1967’s double feature / twofer:\n\nThe New Jimmy Reed Album / Soulin‘ (See for Miles SEECD 468)\n\nThere might be other double compilations, but I haven’t found any.\n\nSo…\n\nJimmy Reed’s complete recordings\n\nWilbert Harrison\n\nLived 1929–1994, recorded 1953–1980s\n\nGonna Tell You a Story: Complete Singles As & Bs 1953-1962 (Jasmine Records JASCD 733, 2 CDs, 40 tracks), contains all his Fury-related singles, that’s 99% of his output until 1962.\n\nHis mid-1960s period is badly collected.\n\nOut of all collections, this one has the most of the songs you need from 62-67, but not all:\n\nAn Introduction to Wilbert Harrison (Fuel 2000 / 061599). It also creates some overlap.\n\nThen it’s\n\nThe Small Labels (Krazy Kat / KK 7439), some overlap, 1963-1965 recordings\n\nCan’t locate 1965-single „Sugar Lump / Don’t Take It So Hard“, 1967-single „No One’s Love But Yours / Mini-Parade“.\n\nFor the rest, seek out:\n\nLet’s Work Together (Sue / SSLP 8801, 1969 album)\n\nAnything You Want (Wet Soul / WS-1001, 1970 album with recordings starting 1960)\n\nShoot You Full of Love (Juggernaut / JUG ST/LP 8803, 1970 album)\n\nWilbert Harrison (Buddah / BDS 5092, 1971 album)\n\nSoul Food Man (Chelsea / CHL 523, 1976 album)\n\nAnd that’s that, as far as I can tell at least. Harrison is mightily badly documented after the mid-1970s, because he had virtually no commercial success or relevance anymore. I read he performed into the 1980s, but it’s hard to tell online, there’s no good sources. There also doesn’t seem to be a lot of print about him.\n\nWell, well. I’m not quite happy with this, but for now:\n\nWilbert Harrison’s complete recordings\n\nJunior Wells\n\nLived 1934–1998, recorded 1953–1996\n\nSee also –>Buddy Guy & Junior Wells\n\nBlues Hit Big Town (Delmark / DD-640, 1953/54)\n\nMessin‘ with the Kid: The Chief/Profile/U.S.A. Sessions 1957-1963 (P-Vine Records – PCD-24039, 1957–1963)\n\nAfter this, he started recording albums with and without Buddy Guy. For his following solo output and the records with Buddy Guy starting 1966, you’ll have to get the albums, starting with:\n\nHoodoo Man Blues (Delmark / DL-612, 1965, credited to Junior Wells‘ Chicago Blues Band).\n\nBut until 1965, these are\n\nJunior Wells‘ complete recordings\n\nBuddy Guy & Junior Wells\n\nsee also –> Buddy Guy and –>Junior Wells\n\nThey started recording in the 1960s together, although their first double-billed album wouldn’t appear until 1972. Their last live gig together in 1993 was issued in 1998, after Junior’s death.\n\nAnyhow, check their solo entries on this list for their stuff up until the mid-1960s – for their albums together, you’ll just have to get the studio and live albums and archival sessions one by one, starting with\n\nPlay the Blues (ATCO / SD 33-364, 1972). Well well well.\n\nLittle Milton\n\nBirth name James Milton Campbell Jr.\n\nLived 1934–2005, recorded 1953–2005\n\nThere are these important sets to start you off:\n\nAnthology 1953-1961 (Varèse Sarabande 066359, 1953-1961)\n\nRunning Wild Blues (Charly SNAP 262, 1953–1954) – there’s overlap with above, but has a lot more tracks from that period.\n\nThe Complete Meteor Blues, R&B & Gospel Recordings (Ace CDCH2 1090, V/A, 1956, „only“ his 4 sides for Meteor and lots of other good stuff by other people). These three collections above make these two (that are by themselves good) completely redundant: The Sun Masters (Rounder SS 35), Raise a Little Sand (Red Lightnin‘ RL-0011, 1956–1958).\n\nThe above covers his entire output before he joined Chess in 1961. Below is his Chess / Checkers output until 1970.\n\nWelcome to the Club: The Essential Chess Recordings (Chess CHD2-9350) – one of the largest and arguably the most important collection of these years. Several tracks solely or best available here.\n\nGreatest Hits (MCA CHD-9386, 1961–1969) – OBSOLETE\n\nChess Rhythm & Roll (Chess CHD4-9352, V/A, only two tracks, but one of them ONLY here: 1961’s „Saving My Love for You“)\n\nGlobal Roots: Chess Blues (HMV 544 540-2, V/A, two tracks, one of them uniquely here „One of These Old Days“ – this collection is completely elusive)\n\nWe’re Gonna Make It (Checker LP-2995, 1965 album, mostly overlap, but two unique tracks)\n\nThe Complete Checker Hit Singles (Connoisseur VSOP CD 351 – mostly overlap, but two unique tracks. This is dreadful).\n\nSings Big Blues (Checker LPS-3002, 1966 album – next to no overlap!)\n\nGrits Ain’t Groceries ( Checker CRLS 4552, 1969 album – mostly overlap, but two unique tracks)\n\nIf Walls Could Talk (Checker LPS-3012, 1970 album, but get the bonus tracks reissue – they are unique to this)\n\nThe Checker Years 1961-70 (P-Vine Special PLP-6059/6060 – large collection, larger overlap – but about half a dozen tracks only here)\n\nLittle Milton (Chess 2ACMB-204 – large collection, ever larger overlap – but about half a dozen tracks only here)\n\nChess Sing a Song of Soul 4 (digital V/A-release by Geffen / Universal 2018, contains Milton’s elusive „Sometime“)\n\nIn the Beginning… (Checker LPS-3014 – V/A, contains one Milton-track, the elusive „Follow the Lamb“)\n\nThis is a nightmare. With at least three large compilations that are almost but not quite redundant to each other, my heart bleeds. Anyway. Can’t locate „Don’t Leave Her“ and this or that alternate take on LP/CD\n\nLittle Milton enjoyed a long and prosperous career after 1970, but this I will update another time.\n\nUp until 1970, this should be 99.9% of\n\nLittle Milton’s complete recordings\n\nWillie Dixon\n\nLived 1915–1992, recorded solo 1954–1989(?)\n\nsee also –>The Big Three Trio\n\nsee also –> Memphis Slim & Willie Dixon\n\nThe Original Wang Dang Doodle: The Chess Recordings & More (MCA / CHD-9353, 1954–1955). This contains the six tracks and more performed by Dixon that are also on his The Chess Box (Chess / CHD2 16500).\n\nI Got 29 Ways – Blues Roots Series, Vol. 12 (Chess – 6.24802, 1955–1962)\n\nI Am the Blues (Columbia / CS 9987, 1970 album)\n\nV/A:\n\nOld Town Blues – Downtown Sides (Ace 469, 1957, V/A, 2 tracks)\n\nThe American Folk Blues Festival 1962-1969 Volume 2 (Hip-O / B0003224-02, V/A, 1962, 1-2 tracks)\n\nAmerican Folk Blues Festival – Live in Paris 20 Octobre 1962 (Fremeaux 3CD 5614, 1962, V/A, 3 tracks)\n\nThe Best of the Blues Singers (Denon 8530, 1962, V/A, 1 track, credited to Memphis Slim)\n\nThe American Folk Blues Festival 1962-1966 (Hip-O Records B0001030-02, 1963, V/A, 1 track)\n\nAmerican Folk Blues Festival ’63 (Fontana 681 510 ZL, 1963, 2 tracks)\n\nChicago Blues ((Spivey 1003, V/A, 1964, 2 tracks)\n\nAmerican Folk Blues Festival ’64 (Fontana TL 5225 / Optimism LR CD-2024, V/A, 2 tracks)\n\nLost Blues Tapes/More American Folk Blues Festival 1963-1965 (ACT 6000-2, V/A, 1964, 2 tracks)\n\nPolish Radio Jazz Archives Vol. 19 – Big City Blues & Howlin‘ Wolf in Warsaw (PR / PRCD 1871, 1964, V/A, 3 tracks)\n\nAmerican Folk Blues (AMIGA / 850 043, 1964, V/A, with Hubert Sumlin & Sunnyland Slim)\n\nEncore! for the Chicago Blues (Spivey 1009, 1965, V/A, 1 track)\n\nAmerican Folk Blues Festival 1970 (Scout Sc-7, 1970, V/A, 2 tracks)\n\nThis is all his available solo stuff until 1970 (apart from unissued things or takes that never made it on a LP or CD).\n\nFrom here on, you need to hunt down his solo live and studio albums starting with\n\nCatalyst (1973), there really are no corners to cut.\n\nAs his solo stuff goes, this is a decent approximation to\n\nWillie Dixon’s complete recordings\n\nMemphis Slim & Willie Dixon\n\nRecorded as a credited duo 1960–1968.\n\nSee also –> Willie Dixon\n\nSee also –> Memphis Slim\n\nDixon and Slim recorded a few albums and live albums as a credited duo, and there are some live appearances scattered throught the American Folk Blues Festival discs. It’s a bit quirky – in their discographies one album („Willie’s Blues“) shows up under Dixon (because his name goes first), another album („Songs of…“) goes under Memphis Slim, and some albums just seem to be forgotten entirely. The list here is really just their album and live album output.\n\nWillie’s Blues (Bluesville BV-1003, 1960)\n\nThe Blues Every Which Way ( Verve / V6-3007, 1961)\n\nSongs of Memphis Slim & Willie Dixon (Folkways FA 2385)\n\nPete Seeger at the Village Gate: With Memphis Slim and Wee Willie Dixon (Folkways FA 2450, 1960, credited to Pete Seeger)\n\nMemphis Slim & Willie Dixon at the Village Gate (Folkways FA 2386, 1962)\n\nAux Trois Mailletz (Polydor 46 131, 1963)\n\nSo, apart from scattered live tracks:\n\nMephis Slim & Willie Dixon’s complete recordings\n\nAlbert King\n\nLived 1923–1992, recorded 1953–1992.\n\nLived 1923–1992, recorded 1953–1992.\n\n1953\n\nHand Me Down Blues, Chicago Style (1953, Relic LP 8024, V/A, 2 first recordings)\n\nChicago Guitar Killers (1953, Blue Night BN 073 1669, V/A, 2 tracks)\n\n1953–1968\n\nBad Luck Blues (1953–1962, Music Avenue 250321)\n\nThe Complete King & Bobbin Recordings (1953–1963, Collectables COL-CD-2887), creates overlap with above, but each have tracks the other doesn’t.\n\nThe Ultimate Collection (1953–1984, Rhino R2 71268)\n\nBorn Under a Bad Sign (1964–1967, Stax STX-34334-02). His 1967 breakthrough album. This reissue also contains bonus tracks nowhere else to be found.\n\nFrom 1968 onwards\n\nit’s just the studio and live albums, starting with\n\nLive Wire / Blues Power (1968 live, Stax 2003)\n\nBut until 1968,\n\nAlbert King’s complete recordings\n\nOtis Spann\n\nLived 1924 or 1930-1970, recorded 1954-1970\n\nThe Complete Candid Otis Spann / Lightnin‘ Hopkins Sessions (Mosaic MD3-139, 1960.

(Spivey 1031, V/A, 1969)\n\nAnd there are 4 more songs by Spann on three LPs credited to Muddy Waters that are apparently so rare that I only found them in a Willie Dixon-discography. They’re called Muddy Waters: Rare Live Recordings Vol 1, 2 and 3 (Black Bear (E) LP 901, 902 and 903). Good luck finding those.\n\nAlso missing: 1960’s „The Bible Don’t Lie / Los Angeles Midnite Groove“\n\nStill, spann-tastic!\n\nOtis Spann’s complete recordings\n\nAnn Cole\n\nLived 1934–1986, recorded solo 1954–1958.\n\nIn the Chapel: 30 of Her Greatest Hits! (Blue City 812)\n\nI don’t actually know if these are really all her songs, but I didn’t find any additional material on any other compilation so far. Quite amazing given she made the original „Got My Mojo Working“. Did she really just record 30 sides? But according to Fancourt/McGraths Blues Discography, there are really only about four or five tracks missing, but those seem to never have seen the light of LPs or CDs.\n\nWell, she recorded at least some more with the gospel group The Colemanaires starting 1949, but they’re even worse documented.\n\nFor her solo output, these are\n\nAnn Cole’s complete recordings\n\nJimmy Rogers\n\nLived 1924-1997, recorded solo 1955-1997\n\nRogers recorded a few sides before he went to Chess. These sides are badly documented and compiled, only some of them are available as single scattered tracks on different random V/A-compilations. These sides are:\n\n„Round About Boogie“ (1946, Harlem, not credited to Rogers but Sunny Land Slim)\n\n„Little Store Blues (tk. 1)“ (1947, Barrelhouse 04)\n\n„Little Store Blues (tk. 2)“ (1947, Barrelhouse 04)\n\n„Ludella“ (1949, Biograph 12035)\n\n„That’s all right“ (1949, Delmark)\n\n„I’m In Love“ (1949, Delmark)\n\nHave fun hunting for these. This is followed by the perfect\n\nThe Complete Chess Recordings (Chess / CHD2-9372, 1955-1959)\n\nBelieve it or not, but Rogers didn’t record in the 1960s.\n\nThen there are the elusive 1970 sides „Ludella“, „Back door friend“ and „What Have I Done“ all featured on the CD-reissue (Testament 5028) of the 1977 LP\n\nChicago Blues at Home (Testament / TCD 5028).\n\nFrom here on, you need to get his individual albums, starting with 1973’s\n\nGold Tailed Bird (Capitol / 7243 8 33916 2 2)\n\nApproximately\n\nJimmy Rogers’ complete recordings\n\nBo Diddley\n\nRecorded 1955–2007(?), lived 1928–2008\n\nThis is a rather unfortunate case in some respects.
