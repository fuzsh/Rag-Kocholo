Writing was, and i suppose still is, just a hobby, but like all hobbies, sometimes life takes precedence over entertainment. though i was gainfully employed and had a family i decided i wanted to pursue an academic career, so i started graduate school in 1992 in pursuit of a Ph.D. in English literature. as a result, my research and writing about South Carolina history, folklore, and music was relegated to the background for a while. as a college professor, one of the requirements for tenure is publication about issues in one’s ﬁeld of academic expertise, so after my appointment as an assistant professor in 1997 i spent the ﬁrst 10-plus years of my career publishing articles and a book related to 19th-century British literature. But after securing tenure and promotion to associate and then full professor, i decided it was time to write about the things that i had pushed to the background in pursuit of an academic career. My ﬁrst two books, Defending South Carolina’s Coast: The Civil War from Georgetown to Little River (2009) and Hidden History of the Grand Strand (2010), grew from my interests in grand Strand history and folklore, and after their publication i decided i wanted to write a book based on my love for beach music. Carolina Beach Music: The Classic Years (2011) was well received and became a ﬁnalist for the 2012 Excellence in Historical Sound Research award in the category of “Best Research in Rock and Pop Music” by the association for Recording and Sound Collections (aRSC), which was a whole lot more than i expected for a book i had written just for fun. i was encouraged enough to write a second book, Carolina Beach Music from the 60s to the 80s: The New Wave (2013). Both of these books focused on a select number of individual songs and the stories behind them based on interviews with the artists. But what was apparent then and is still apparent now was that beach music really did not have its own reference work, one solid reliable source where someone could go to ﬁnd out something about this music and the diverse array of the artists who recorded it. as i researched my ﬁrst two books about beach music in broad reference works such as The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, The Encyclopedia of Rhythm and Blues and Doo Wop Vocal Groups, and The All Music Guide to Soul: The Definitive Guide to R&B and Soul, or more narrowly focused works such as Kansas City Jazz: From Ragtime to Bebop—a History, South to Louisiana: The Music of the Cajun Bayous, A House on Fire: The Rise and Fall of Philadelphia Soul, and Chicago Soul, i became more and more convinced that there was a market for a similar work about Carolina beach music. Rock, R&B, pop, punk, new wave, new age, reggae, country, classical, rockabilly, and so on have all had multiple reference works written about their genres, so why not beach music? i’m not forgetting greg Haynes’ The Heeey Baby Days of Beach Music, which is quite 1\n\n2\n\nPreface\n\ngood, but by design the book’s focus has a regional ﬂavor, and concerns itself primarily with homegrown groups such as the Prophets, Bill Deal and the Rhondels, the Embers, and others. i felt like there was a need for a work that incorporated information about well-known and little-known groups on a national scale whose music has been appropriated by beach music audiences, as well as those home-grown artists from florida, georgia, virginia, and the Carolinas whose time in the national spotlight was brief, if it existed at all. true, there have been a few works about beach music that have dealt with some of this, but most have been self-published and do not qualify as deﬁnitive reference works. in fairness, they weren’t designed to do anything more than sell books for audiences eager for anything written about beach music, so i’m not faulting them. there is value in those books, and a paragraph or two about a beach song is generally more than could be found anywhere else previously. i just felt that something more scholarly was needed. once i’d made up my mind what i wanted to do i had to ﬁnd someone who’d publish it if i wrote it. the problem was that the publisher i was with for my ﬁrst two beach music books did not publish books of the magnitude that i knew this work would have to be. for their books they wanted a word count in the 45,000 to 50,000 range, and i knew the work i was proposing was going to be a lot bigger than that. Even at that, i knew my focus wasn’t going to be on every aspect of beach music, but instead my project was going to be a reference work containing detailed information about artists and songs in the Carolina beach music oeuvre, including biographical information about the artists, information about the record labels, and whether or not the recordings made the national charts. futhermore, as i’ll explain below, rather than try to do that for the last 80 years, i decided to limit my focus to the music from the early, or “classic” years of beach music. in short, the focus was to be on recordings made between 1940 and 1980 that are generally considered beach music, as well as the artists who made them. as a result, we have the Carolina Beach Music Encyclopedia, a painstakingly researched work that should be able to provide all the information you need about classic beach music. Let me say a word about the scope of the work. the music that can be called “beach music” is often hard to deﬁne, which is not surprising since people even argue about when the term ﬁrst came into use. Some of the artists themselves have given me conﬂicting accounts, some swearing that some of the songs were being called beach music as early as the mid 1960s, while others say they never heard the term until the early 1970s. to be honest, i don’t think it is as important to know when it came to be as it is to know what it is and how the deﬁnition of beach music has changed over the years. one thing i do know is that up until about 1980, it wasn’t all that diﬃcult to determine what was and what was not beach music. as i’ll address in the introduction, it was after 1980 that the somewhat dichotomous relationship between what was beach music and shag music developed. i’d argue that they are not the same thing, but again, i’m not sure that question existed until the 1980s. Because the pre–1980s releases provide a pretty safe zone, and because it’s in my wheelhouse because i was listening to beach music right up through the ’70s, i decided to set the limits for this book at 1940 to 1980. there is plenty to cover there, and although i’m sure some people will be upset that some of their favorites (perhaps songs such as “Brenda” by o.C. Smith or “Lady Soul” by the temptations) came after that, i had to draw the line somewhere. that early, classic period is\n\nPreface\n\n3\n\nfairly easy to deﬁne, and it’s the period i know best, so that’s how i decided to limit this work. Despite those very clear- cut lines, there is nevertheless one more issue, which is the trickiest and most debatable of all. What if a song existed before 1980, but wasn’t really “discovered” or adopted as a beach song until after 1980? unfortunately, there are a number of these, and this brings us back to the difference between beach music and shag music that i’ll address in the introduction. But by the early 1980s i think DJs, record collectors, and beach music compilation album producers were listening to a lot of old music that beach music audiences had either missed altogether or forgotten about, and so there came a broadening of the roster of songs that could be marketed as beach music. there’s nothing wrong with that in principal, and in fact it brought to light some pretty ﬁne tunes that maybe we’d all missed the ﬁrst time around or forgotten about over time. By way of example, from the 1950s, the Drivers’ “Smooth, Slow, and Easy,” Champion Jack Dupree’s “Rub a Little Boogie,” and the four Jacks’ “Last of the good Rocking Men” are all songs i really don’t remember hearing prior to 1980, although they’d been around more than 20 years at that point. i would not say that no one ever listened to those songs in beach clubs or called them beach music during that period, and it is quite possible that they were popular at one time but then faded away as a lot of songs do. But i think i could argue that none of those songs would have made anyone’s top 50, 100, or maybe even 200 beach songs prior to 1980 because they just weren’t on the radar. However, at some point they were back in the mix, so the way i approached those songs was as follows: if it were a song that that was recorded in the ’40s, ’50s, ’60s, or ’70s that would have ﬁt nicely as a beach music song during any of those decades, i included it even if it only became popular later. unfortunately, we keep coming around to the difference between shag music and beach music, and so here i will add that a number of older songs that probably didn’t belong were “shoehorned” into the beach music genre during the 1980s, ’90s, and 2000s. there are principally two types of songs that ﬁt this category, the ﬁrst of which were disco-type songs from the 1970s. i can conﬁdently say that songs such as tina Charles’ “i’ll go Where the Music takes Me” or Candi Staton’s “victim” were not considered beach music when released, and were only so-designated later. i have not included songs such as these in this book unless i know for a fact they were being listened to and danced to by beach music audiences during the 1970s. the same goes for a number of songs such as “Begin the Beguine” by Johnny Mathis, “a nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square” by Bobby Darin, or “My Baby Just Cares for Me” by nina Simone. While these are ﬁne songs, they were not considered beach music at the time they were released, nor (in my opinion) should they be now. these were also late additions introduced, again, for people looking for shag music as opposed to music that adhered to the spirit of beach music. those distinctions aren’t going to make everyone happy, but again, the rule of thumb is that if you played the song for a fairly knowledgeable fan of beach music in 1980, and he or she said, “yes, that’s beach music” or “it should be beach music,” then it’s in. otherwise, it is not. now that i’ve made an attempt to explain what has and has not been included here, an explanation of the listings is in order.\n\n4\n\nPreface\n\nListings, Labels and Chart Positions the entries in this book are organized alphabetically by the artist’s last name if an individual, alphabetically by the last name of the featured artist if a group with the singer’s name listed (for example, Hank Ballard and the Midnighters can be found in the B’s), or by the ﬁrst word listed in the group’s name, save for the “the” (for example, the Chairmen of the Board can be found in the C’s). this is followed by the “beach music discography,” a listing of only the singles that have found an audience with beach music lovers, regardless of how many singles the artist released or how many of the artist’s records have charted. generally though, mention will be made in the chapter of other signiﬁcant recordings by the artist even if they are not considered beach music. for example, although Marvin gaye’s “Stubborn kind of fellow” peaked at #46 on the pop charts, it is discussed in this book because it’s considered beach music, while 1973’s “Let’s get it on” is not although it went to #1 and was a much bigger hit nationally. information about the record follows the song title, starting with the label of release. if a single came out on a regional label, but was later released on a national label, in the chapter headings it is listed by its original release if the record never charted, or the national label if it did chart. for example, “kidnapper” by Jewell and the Rubies was ﬁrst released on La Louisianne 8041, then picked up and released by aBC on aBC Paramount 10485. Since neither record made the national charts i have listed the original La Louisianne release in the chapter heading. to illustrate the opposite point, “Double Shot” by the Swingin’ Medallions was released ﬁrst on 4 Sale 002 before being picked and released on Smash 2033. the Smash recording made the national charts, so that version is listed in the chapter heading. this is followed by the year of release if the song did not chart, or the year it reached its peak position if it did chart. finally, this is followed by the highest position the record reached on the Billboard Pop Charts. if it did not make those charts, it will say “Billboard Pop Did not Chart,” followed by the listing on the Billboard R&B charts if it made those charts. taking William Bell’s “Easy Comin’ out (Hard goin’ in)” by way of example, since it did not make the pop charts but did make the R&B charts, it says “Billboard Pop Did not Chart, R&B #30.” if a record did not make either chart it will say simply “Did not Chart.” in the body of the entry i have usually included the artist’s place of birth, though not their birth date. this is usually followed by the artist’s early experiences in music, any groups he or she may have been with at any time, the artist’s recordings (focusing of course on beach music). in some cases, if the artists went on to record for a number of years yet produced no more music that ﬁts the beach music genre, single releases and chart history will only focus on any big hits. finally, when applicable, if the artist is deceased, the year of his or her death will usually be noted. Sadly, death is the one thing in this book that is not static, and as of this writing at least half a dozen artists have passed away since i’ve been working on this book. What i think you’ll ﬁnd in these pages is a useful guide to songs that were recorded and included in the beach music genre between 1940 and 1980. While i can’t claim to have included every single song that someone, somewhere, at some time, has considered beach music—despite my best efforts—i can’t imagine i’ve missed much. i hope you ﬁnd this guide useful, and as enjoyable to read as it was for me to write it.\n\nintroduction i grew up in florence, South Carolina, a town about 70 miles from Myrtle Beach. as early as junior high school i had some idea of what beach music was, or at least enough to know that it wasn’t California beach music by groups such as the Beach Boys or Jan and Dean. i knew just enough to know that in my area of the country it was mainly R&Bbased music people heard at the beach, and as an untutored teenager, that meant music by groups such as the Drifters and the tams, though somehow even early on i was also aware of Willie tee and the georgia Prophets—though don’t ask me how. it was not necessarily the type of music that i liked best as a pre-teen, but i have to admit it appealed to me on some level. When i was growing up my mother loved Motown, so i knew and often heard the music of the Supremes, four tops, temptations, and other groups, and so what passed for beach music was close to the music i heard playing in the house when i was a child. then, around 1974, i was in one of those once-ubiquitous shops you used to ﬁnd near the boulevard in Myrtle Beach that sold bootleg 8-track tapes. i’m not sure what i thought those tapes were at the time, but i knew they weren’t original releases because they were cheap, had no (or generic) pictures on them, and didn’t sound all that great. But for a high school kid on a budget they were a bargain, and as i thumbed through the racks of cheap tapes, for some reason my attention was drawn to a tape called “Beach Music Hits” that, as best i can remember, contained the following tracks: “gimme Little Sign”—Brenton Wood “kidnapper”—Jewell and the Rubies “i Dig your act”—the o’Jays “39–21–40 Shape”—the Showmen “anna”—arthur alexander “Mixed up, Shook up, girl”—Patty & the Emblems “opportunity”—the Jewels “thank you John”—Willie tee “the Entertainer”—tony Clarke “across the Street”—Lenny o’Henry “a Quiet Place”—garnet Mimms “California”—georgia Prophets “Michael, the Lover”—the C.o.D.s “together”—the intruders “if We Had to Do it all over”—Sunny and Phyllis “Hey! i know you”—the Monzas as you can see, that’s a real strong list of beach classics, and it was with this tape that i think my love affair with beach music really began. i’m not even sure why i bought it, and 5\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\ni certainly wasn’t familiar with all of the songs on the tape, but i know for a fact that was the day that changed my life. Maybe in retrospect the exceptional collection of songs on the tape made me a bit of a purist, and perhaps in my mind a prerequisite for “real” beach music was that it should principally be ’50s and ’60s rhythm and blues—period. i broadened my horizons just a little when i entered Clemson university in the fall of 1976. i joined kappa alpha order at Clemson, and not surprisingly i was in an organization whose members had many of the same interests i did, and beach music was one of those interests. We were the preppy, khakied, button-down collared, Weejun and topsider wearing frat, a bit of anachronism at a time when every other fraternity was into silk shirts, stacked heels, and leisure suits. in that sense, the music ﬁt who we were, and that was the next big step in my development. as a ka i learned a lot more about the music from older guys in the chapter, and it was at that point that i also learned that there were some pretty ﬁne newer beach recordings too, and so i became aware of songs such as “you keep tellin’ Me yes” by Cannonball, “i Dig Everything about you” by the MoB, and “Something old, Something new” by the fantastics for the ﬁrst time. i’ve read in places that songs such as “Summertime’s Callin Me” and the tymes’ “Ms. grace” really didn’t take off with beach music audiences until the late ’70s or even the early ’80s, but i assure you they were on the jukebox at the ka house by 1976 when i arrived on campus. of course, if you were a ka at Clemson you had to know how to shag, and so by that time the circle was complete. this is when i started collecting records that were also exclusively beach music. as time went on, with nothing more than the authority of having a pretty decent collection of 45s, i started occasionally working as a beach music DJ at parties. i already worked at the beach every summer, and after my freshman year in college a friend was talking to a bar manager who had decided he wanted to play beach music in his bar one or two nights a week. this led to my friend suggesting me for the job, which led to a stint playing beach music part time for a couple of summers in Litchﬁeld Beach at the Litchﬁeld inn, in the hotel bar which was then known as “Big Daddy’s Bottom.” During those years i was also able to see a lot of the beach bands that played in the area, including the tams, the georgia Prophets, the Catalinas, the Embers, and even acts with a broader national appeal such as the Cornelius Brothers & Sister Rose and even the four tops. needless to say i also visited a variety of beach clubs and bars, including the Spanish galleon, fat Jacks, Crazy Zacks, and sometimes even places like the afterdeck had beach bands as well. if you love beach music and think this all sounds pretty much like a perfect life for a beach music fan, it was. By the early ’80s i was ﬁnished with college and had moved to the beach to live full time, and during this period i was married, we had children, and eventually i was off to grad school to get a Ph.D. in English. i was offered a job and we moved to Louisiana in 1997, and of course part of being employed as a professor involves publishing. as i mentioned in the Preface, i eventually turned from academic writing to writing about my personal interests. Had i known there would be more than one book, i probably would have done one book about the beach music grounded in the ’40s and ’50s, one about the ’60s, and then one about the ’70s and early ’80s; in other words, something with the type of parameters you ﬁnd in this book. However, i didn’t know there would even be more than one book when i wrote the ﬁrst one, so the ﬁrst one spanned all of those decades, then the\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nsecond one was about the period from 1965 on. Consequently, that left a lot of songs, especially from pre–1965 period, that didn’t get covered at all. Working on those books, and especially after having left the job unﬁnished, it was apparent that beach music really did not have its own reference work, one solid reliable source where someone could go to get reliable information about this music. it’s generally easy to ﬁnd out information about chart hits by well-known groups, but what about some of the lesser lights, at least in terms of chart success in the annals of popular music? there have been a few works that have dealt with some of the music, but sadly most were not designed or researched enough to serve as deﬁnitive reference works. Consequently, i felt it was time for a deﬁnitive, library-quality research work about beach music. Earlier i mentioned growing up and then going to college in the ’70s, and while by the 1980s i still listened to beach music, i was no longer active on the club scene and that was certainly true as i got married and we moved ﬁrst to Columbia and then Louisiana. this is all to say that for me, beach music was basically frozen in time around 1980. as it relates to my writing, and the material in this book, i think that’s okay because as this book proves, there was plenty of music recorded that qualiﬁed as classic beach music prior to 1980. that music doesn’t need to be defended nor does it need to be justiﬁed in order to make it legitimized as beach music. after roughly 1980, i’m not so sure that’s the case.\n\nClassic Beach Music and “New” Beach Music Saying beach music—what it was, what it meant, and what it included—was frozen in time for me around 1980, may need some elucidation. it requires an explanation of how it was changing, what the “newer” or “new wave” of beach music was, and the rise of shag music as opposed to beach music. But before i can do that, perhaps it’s a good idea to talk about the foundation of it all—classic beach music. Put 10, 20, 30—or even 2—people in a room and ask them to deﬁne beach music and you’re sure to get number of different answers that will probably equal the number of people responding. no one has ever come up with a deﬁnition that ﬁts it perfectly, and in all honesty to some degree i’m depending on readers to come into this book already having a pretty good idea of what beach music is. Words and phrases used to deﬁne it often relate it to music about sand, the surf, salt air, spring break, summer vacation, the Pad, the ocean Drive Pavilion, the Myrtle Beach Pavilion, girl watching, regional R&B bands, Labor Day Weekend, beach parties, the boardwalk, young love…. i could probably come up with 100 words that connect with what beach music is about and i’d still miss some things. Most people reading this book will know a lot of early beach music was R&B by black groups that, in the 1940s and ’50s, was played only on jukeboxes at the beach, often at pavilions and “juke joints” where it was okay to play “race music” long before white radio stations would play it. a lot of those old atlantic, federal, king, and Chess releases qualiﬁed, but they weren’t the only labels releasing it. this music by black artists started to appear on jukeboxes in the area around Myrtle Beach and eventually all along the coastal bars, pavilions, and dancehalls of north and South Carolina, georgia, and virginia. the old story goes that people would hear this music at the beach and go home and talk about that “beach music”—the music they heard played at the beach. When in the ’50s\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nand ’60s more and more local bands started to pop up all over the Southeast they knew that one of the best ways to please the crowds was to play that beach music that fans had a hard time listening to anywhere but along the coast. as ammon tharp of Bill Deal and the Rhondels told me, “We played down in the Carolinas, and during the summer of 1968 people kept requesting [Maurice William’s] ‘May i.’ We did it live on stage, and they went crazy down there. We were there the rest of the week, and we’d get requests to do it two or three times a night. We came back home to virginia Beach and said, ‘Wow—we really gotta record this damn thing.’” Certain bands became identiﬁed with this sound and type of music, and in my interviews i’ve had a number of band members tell me quite pointedly that though they may have forayed into other types of music at one time or another, eventually they decided to be a beach band. they’d play those old classics they knew, throw in some original stuff that ﬁt that loosely-deﬁned beach music template, and they were on their way. if they were good, and could bring something special to those covers, they could be successful even if they never had a hit on national radio. Many of them did have a few national releases, and some of them—such as Bill Deal and the Rhondels with their top 40 covers of “May i,” “i’ve Been Hurt,” and “What kind of fool”—actually had national hits with them. During the mid– to late 1960s, much of the music from Motown and Stax ﬁt the beach music template, though of course by that time what was once considered race music was being played on radio stations and in clubs everywhere, and was no longer relegated just to jukeboxes and local bands playing on the coast. Since the dance people had been doing along the coast for decades, the shag, was danced to beach music, beach music started to diversify in the late ’60s and early ’70s, and in some cases became whatever music could be shagged to, though it still primarily consisted of soul and rhythm and blues. Consequently, more pop music started to work its way onto beach playlists across the South, and not surprisingly, by the mid–1970s with the rise of disco, some of that music worked its way onto beach playlists as well. in addition, many well-established and enormously successful national groups who had been considered solid soul/R&B/beach music acts such as the four tops, the o’Jay’s, the intruders, and even the Drifters expanded their repertoires in order to keep up with music’s new directions and keep their music relevant. this led to a very different sound for some of these groups, but it also meant that many of the songs they recorded were accepted much more quickly as part of the beach music canon than would have otherwise been the case. But perhaps the most dynamic change, and what truly changed beach music forever, was that groups whose sole purpose was to ﬁnd a localized audience in the Carolinas started to produce self-reﬂective and self-aware beach music beginning in the mid– to late 1970s. this principally started after the Catalinas’ 1975 recording “Summertime’s Callin’ Me” became a huge regional favorite. Here was a song written about the beach, by a group from the Carolinas, and even though the group had released a record on a national label (Scepter) in the 1960s, by the 1970s the group apparently had nothing more ambitious in mind than having a song that was a hit on the beach music circuit. it eventually became just that, and consequently claims on the Catalinas’ website that note that “the song’s popularity was the main catalyst that kicked off the modern day beach music renaissance” are true without a doubt: certainly, after the regional success of “Summertime’s Calling Me,” beach music would never be the same again. By the late ’70s, established acts who had recorded classic\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nera hits but principally played the beach music circuit by this point, such as the tams, the Chairmen of the Board, Clifford Curry, the Embers, and others, also started to record songs about the beach geared for a beach music, as opposed to a national, audience. they recorded regional hits such as “Shag with Me,” “on the Beach,” “i Love Beach Music,” and others, and so these well-established acts lent credibility to those beach-music-about-thebeach songs that might otherwise have been slow to gain acceptance. this left the door open for newer acts in the late ’70s and early ’80s who were able to break onto the scene without a national recording of the type that lent them instant credibility as had, to some extent, previously been the case. Whereas groups such as those mentioned above had recorded with national labels and paid their dues, groups such as the Band of oz, the fantastic Shakers, Bradford & Bell, and others began to break onto the beach music scene without having had that big national release. While it’s true that not all of the groups with classic-era hits had had national releases, it certainly wasn’t for lack of trying, but in many ways, by the late ’70s a recording contract with a national label, no matter how brieﬂy it ran, was no longer a pre-requisite for being taken seriously as a major beach music act. in many ways it was inevitable that this had to happen. as the Chairmen of the Board’s general Johnson later wrote of his founding of Surfside Records with Mike Branch in 1979, “our objective was to record new music to revitalize the identity of a thriving [beach] music market that was slowly being recognized as too dependent on old recordings.” Certainly, it’s true that a few hundred solid classic era beach music hits couldn’t carry the industry forever. as acts and individuals grew older and passed on, it would mean that every beach music song one heard performed live would be a cover version and that certainly would have relegated beach music to an amateurishness which the genre perhaps could not have survived. nevertheless, as the 1970s came to an end, beach music was still pretty easily deﬁnable. there were those old R&B songs from the ’40s, ’50s, and early ’60s that had always ﬁt the mold of classic beach music, some Motown, Stax and the like, releases by regional bands, some of which had charted nationally, newer recordings by older classic groups, and selfaware beach music recorded to be beach music from the mid–1970s on. am i forgetting anything? Probably, but nevertheless, if you were compiling a list of great beach songs around 1980, while you might debate what did and didn’t belong on the list due to how popular the song was as a beach music hit, you wouldn’t necessarily have debated whether it was actually beach music or not. as the music had become popular there was a growing market for people who wanted to read and learn more about it, and in 1979, Chris Beachley started It Will Stand Magazine, a publication about beach music that, in my mind, has never been surpassed. it featured interviews with beach music artists, discographies, news on beach concerts, shag contests, and all other things concerning the beach music scene. one especially important thing it did was run a poll during its ﬁrst year in print, and subsequently offered a list of the top 50 beach music hits of all time: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n\nBilly Ward & the Dominoes, “Sixty-Minute Man” (1951) the tymes, “Ms. grace” (1974) Willie tee, “thank you John” (1965) the Catalinas, “Summertime’s Calling Me” (1975) the Showmen, “39–21–40 Shape” (1963)\n\n10\n\nIntroduction 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. 45. 46. 47. 48. 49. 50.\n\nJimmy Ricks and the Ravens, “green Eyes” (1955) garnet Mimms and the Enchanters, “a Quiet Place” (1964) Barbara Lewis, “Hello Stranger” (1963) the Clovers, “nip Sip” (1955) tony Clarke, “the Entertainer” (1964) the Platters, “With this Ring” (1967) Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs, “Stay” (1960) the Clovers, “one Mint Julep” (1952) Doris troy, “Just one Look” (1963) the tams, “i’ve Been Hurt” (1965) Willie tee, “Walking up a one-Way Street” (1965) the Platters, Washed ashore (on a Lonely island in the Sea)” (1967) the Embers, “far away Places” (1969) the tams, “Be young, Be foolish, Be Happy” (1968) the georgia Prophets, “i got the fever” (1968) the temptations, “My girl” (1965) Lenny o’Henry, “across the Street” (1964) Bruce Channel, “Hey!

By way of example, Marvin gaye’s “Come get to this” has been included. this song wasn’t a blip on the radar of beach music when it came out in 1973, nor at any time prior to 1980 as far as i know, no matter how much people may like it today. that doesn’t mean no one heard nor even shagged to it prior to 1980, but it was not considered beach music in the decade following its release no matter how much of a favorite it may be now. However, since Marvin gaye had a preexisting beach music repertoire i have included “Come get to this” in this book. on the other hand the Mills Brothers’ “a Donut and a Dream,” also released in 1973, is not included. neither the song nor the Mills Brothers were under the beach music umbrella prior to 1980 (with good reason i think), and in fact, this song wedged its way onto playlists in the 1990s because people were desperate for songs to shag to. in my mind it is not nor ever will be a beach music song, which brings us to the difference between “shag music” and “beach music”—and they are not the same thing.\n\nThe Curse of “Shag” Music a few years ago, i was at the o.D. Pavilion talking to the late H. Lee Brown, and as we talked about the state of beach music, he said something to the effect that he almost feared for the music, and was worried that maybe younger generations might not carry on the tradition. But as i listened to the music coming across the speakers on the dance ﬂoor, i had a thought i’ve had many times since then: no one really knows what beach music is anymore, and we’ve increasingly blurred the lines between shag music and beach music. now more than ever they are not the same thing. the ﬁrst time i really became aware that what passed for beach music was changing was in the 1990s when i saw a Ripete compilation CD with grand funk’s “Bad time” on it. i think beach music lovers owe a debt of gratitude to Ripete because they made hundreds of songs available on vinyl and CDs that were nearly impossible to ﬁnd after their original release. Before the advent of MP3s, there weren’t a lot of choices if a record was out of print, so Ripete can take a lot of credit for saving some of that old music from obscurity. However, they had a business to run, and you can’t get very far recycling the same 200 or 300 songs over and over in new packaging. also, often the terms or the rights and royalties changed, so something had to give. i’ll admit i loved grand funk when i was in junior high, and “Bad time” truly is a great song, and technically one you can shag too. But it’s not beach music no matter how you cut it. i use this as an example that’s sure to provoke\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\na knee jerk response, because the image of a longhaired, shirtless (as he often performed) Mark farner singing lead on a beach music song deﬁes imagination. i’ve interviewed Mark farner, and he is a wonderful man and a devout Christian; i just can’t consider anything by grand funk beach music no matter how hard i try. But i think the inclusion of “Bad time” on a beach music CD shows just how desperate things were by the 1990s, as people in the beach music business sought to keep it a viable industry. the solution seems to have been to start calling anything you could shag to beach music, which to me really violates the spirit of what that music was up until the early 1980s. But quality “new” beach music, and new music that could be adopted as beach music, wasn’t produced at a pace that was likely to keep shaggers satisﬁed, and so in my mind things changed to the point where beach music and shag music had become two different things—which i think they have and are. i’ve seen lists purporting to be “Beach Music top 40s” containing songs by the Bee gees, Eric Clapton, van Morrison, Cher, Bob Segar, John fogerty, Rod Stewart, and many others. i’m not sure that people who would call songs by those artists beach music really understand what beach music is, and i think they need to recognize that shag music is not exactly the same as beach music. While it’s clear that when i grew up they were the same thing, it’s just as obvious that today they are not. those two things took different paths long ago. i understand people want different music to shag to, and i know DJs need something to play beyond a few hundred classic songs, but i resent having something that is clearly in no way beach music being shoved down my throat and told it’s the same thing. it is not. then there’s the newer beach music, which is generally new homegrown beach-musicabout-the-beach. Sonny threatt of the duo Sunny and Phyllis once told me, “i hear so many repos and soundalikes it makes me sick. Songs aBout beach music insult the intelligence of anyone who really loves the real thing.” there are a considerable number of people who would certainly agree, though obviously there is a thriving industry out there based on the modern beach music sound and whose supporters would beg to differ. the superb beach music DJ Charlie Brown explained to me his theories on why he thought this happened, noting that perhaps the difference is that instead of simply being about the music like it once was, some individuals are selling beach music, shagging, and so on as a lifestyle package more so than just being about great music. for these people, apparently those old classics are great songs, but they are no longer an essential part of the modern beach music scene, the “Carolina beach music” scene, as it is now known. there’s a whole new catalog of music for those people. i understand this as well, but just because a group covers “thank you John,” or writes and records a new song about being at the beach, don’t expect me to embrace it. finally, it’s not just modern music that seems to be bleeding over, but older music as well. as i mentioned in the Preface, from the 1980s on, a lot of old songs were “discovered” or “rediscovered.” unfortunately, though, a number of older songs that probably didn’t belong were “shoehorned” into the beach music genre during the 1980s, ’90s, and 2000s, and the most egregious of these were songs not considered beach music at the time they were released, nor (in my opinion) should they be now. these were also late additions introduced, again, for people looking for shag music as opposed to music that adhered to the spirit of beach music. Just because you can shag to van Morrison’s “Brown Eyed girl,” that doesn’t make it beach music.\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nas a result of all these factors, though beach music has always been hard to deﬁne, i think that’s true now more than ever. Rather than negotiate the mineﬁelds of what is beach music as opposed to maybe just shag music, and rather than try to write a book about a post–1980 period i admit i know very little about, i played it safe in this book and dealt with a period i do know a whole lot about as a native South Carolinian who grew up listening to that old, classic beach music. in this book i have written almost exclusively about the songs i consider indisputable beach classics, although i admit there’s always room for discussion. i’ve tried to be pretty inclusive here, and if you were to ask me if i really think there are more than 400 great beach music songs i’d be inclined to say perhaps not, but it is probably better to be inclusive than not. My job, as i saw it, was not to simply include what I think are the best beach songs, but what are more or less universally hailed as beach songs of merit recorded and recognized prior to 1980. i realize i’ve probably missed a few, and there are some songs i ended up leaving out at the last minute because i was on the fence about whether or not to include them. to be honest, a lot of R&B recorded in the 1950s and early ’60s could qualify as beach music in some way, and there are obviously a lot of songs from the period you can shag to. Even now there are songs here that i’m not 100 percent sure are the best examples of beach music, but if we shagged to them and considered them some form of beach music back in the day, i erred on the side of caution and included them. i hope you enjoy this reference guide that was so many years in the making. for me, it was truly a labor of love.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nThe Encyclopedia Barbara Acklin BEach Music Discography: “Love Makes a Woman” (Brunswick 55379, 1968: Billboard pop #15); “am i the same girl” (Brunswick 55399, 1969: Billboard pop #79). Born in oakland, california, Barbara acklin’s family moved to chicago when she was ﬁve, and after graduating from high school she worked as a secretary at chicago’s st. Lawrence records while waiting for her big break. she did get the opportunity to record an early side under the name Barbara allen on the special agent label, though it failed to chart. acklin also stayed active in the business by doing back-up work for Etta James and Fontella Bass, and by 1966 she had moved to the larger and better-known Brunswick records to work as a receptionist while still trying to land a contract as a singer. she was also writing music, and along with her friend David scott she co-wrote a song called “Whispers” and took it to Brunswick’s biggest act, Jackie Wilson. at the time Wilson hadn’t had a Top 20 hit since 1963, but after he recorded “Whispers” in 1966 it hit #11 on the pop charts and his career was rejuvenated (see the entry for Jackie Wilson). in Chicago Soul, Bob pruter notes that acklin said Wilson appreciated what she had done for him, and told her “‘if there is anything i can do for you let me know.’” acklin asked Wilson to tell Brunswick to give her the opportunity to cut a record of her own, and in turn Wilson persuaded Brunswick to give her a shot; “about three weeks later i was in the studio” acklin told pruter. her ﬁrst solo efforts, “Fool, Fool, Fool” and “i’ve got you Baby” didn’t do much, but Brunswick labelmate gene chandler had heard her sing and decided it might be a good idea to record a couple of duets with her. “show Me the Way to go” went to #30 on the r&B charts, while “From the Teacher to the preacher” went to #57 on the pop charts and #16 on the r&B charts. in between those two releases was another solo effort, the beach standard “Love Makes a Woman,” and it became her ﬁrst big hit. The song went to #15 on the pop charts, #3 on the r&B charts, and would win a Broadcast Music inc. (BMi) award. acklin’s next single, “Just ain’t No Love,” did moderately well, and though her next release, “am i the same girl,” was her lowest charting record of those listed so far, it probably had the potential to be her biggest hit. acklin sings backed by the in-house Brunswick studio musicians, and listening to it today it’s obvious it should have charted and done well. unfortunately, Brunswick didn’t like the ﬁnished product and refused to release it as it was. instead, the label removed acklin’s vocal track and added\n\n\n\n6\n\nArthur Alexander\n\nanother piano section to the song, re-titled the song “soulful strut,” and released it as being by young-holt unlimited (though neither young nor holt actually played on the track). The instrumental release went to #3 in the u.s. and #1 in canada in 1968 and sold two million copies. Brunswick ﬁnally released acklin’s original version in 1969, but by that time audiences were probably tired of what they heard as “soulful strut” with overlaid vocals; acklin’s version stalled at #79 on the pop charts. acklin would have a few more moderate hits on the r&B charts, but would never make a substantial mark as a singer. as a songwriter, however, she would be hugely successful, and would co-write several of the chi-Lites’ hits including “have you seen her,” which was #3 on the pop charts and #1 on the r&B charts. her own solo career would eventually wind down, and she would go on to sing backup for acts such as the chi-Lites and Tyrone Davis before passing away in 1998.\n\nArthur Alexander BEach Music Discography: “you Better Move on” (Dot 16309, 1962: Billboard pop #24); “anna” (Dot 16387, 1962: Billboard pop #68); “Every Day i have to cry some” (Buddah 492, 1975: Billboard pop #45). arthur alexander, Jr. (called “June” by his friends in reference to Jr.) was born in Florence, alabama, and as a teenager his ﬁrst success in the music business came when his group the heartstrings sang on a few radio shows. he came to attention of Florence resident Tom stafford, who along with Billy sherrill and rick hall opened the Florence alabama Music Enterprise in Muscle shoals, which is now better known as FaME studios. alexander spent time in the studio and co-wrote a song called “she Wanna rock,” which was recorded by amie Derkson in 1959. a year later, recording as June alexander, he recorded another song he co-wrote, “sally sue Brown,” on the tiny Judd records label. Though the record was not a commercial success, it would later be recorded by Bob Dylan. By then alexander was married, a father, and working part time as a bellhop and selling bootleg liquor to make ends meet. it was at this point he wrote another song that would become his second recording, “you Better Move on.” it was recorded at FaME studios and when it was released under his given name in 1962 on Nashville’s Dot label the record ﬁnally brought him some notice. The song was based on alexander’s relationship with girlfriend (and later wife) ann, and how her wealthy former boyfriend tried to win her back. alexander’s advice to boyfriend to “move on” was one of many songs he would write and record about troubled relationships, and it seemed to resonate with listeners. The song went to #24 on the charts and Arthur Alexander circa 962 (photograph courtesy got alexander a booking on American Richard Younger).\n\nArthur Alexander\n\n\n\nBandstand. it was the ﬁrst national hit recorded in the state of alabama, and the studio’s ﬁrst hit of the many to follow. Like many of alexander’s recordings, it would be also be covered by multiple artists, including the rolling stones, the hollies and chuck Jackson, among others. after releasing the excellent but somewhat underappreciated “soldier of Love,” which would be covered by the Beatles and eventually Marshall crenshaw and even pearl Jam, his next recording was 1962’s “anna,” written about his wife and their doomed relationship, which would ultimately end in divorce. alexander later noted that while in reality his wife had not been unfaithful, he believed she was starting to regret not going with that other guy who had “moved on.” “anna” went to #68 on the pop charts and was reportedly one of John Lennon’s favorite songs. consequently, the Beatles recorded it and in 1963 released their own version on the album Please Please Me. The Beatles would eventually cover two other alexander recordings, “a shot of rhythm and Blues” and “Where have you Been,” and with those and “anna” and “soldier of Love,” it was clear, as paul Mccartney later said in a 1987 interview with Mark Lewisohn, that if the early “Beatles ever wanted a sound, it was r&B … we wanted to be like arthur alexander.” Despite the inﬂuence of his music, “anna” was his last record in the 1960s to make the pop charts, and by the end of the decade he was playing smaller venues. his friend clifford curry told me in an interview that the two of them “did a few gigs together in the carolinas in the late 1960s,” including the Beach club in Myrtle Beach, and that alexander was surprised at how popular his music still was among the beach music crowd. “he was really pleased by that,” curry said. While his older songs were adopted as beach music on the coast, in the music industry alexander’s heartfelt recordings would continue to inspire others, and the likes of “Burning Love” would be covered by Elvis presley. another song alexander wrote, “Every Day i have to cry some,” was ﬁrst recorded by steve alaimo in 1962, then Dusty springﬁeld, the Mccoys, The Bee gees, Johnny rivers, and others before alexander’s own version went to #45 in 1975. on a personal level, however, alexander’s life was not so successful. alexander divorced ann, and his behavior became increasingly erratic. he often had to be tracked down in bars to perform, and on one occasion he walked off stage in the middle of a performance for no apparent reason. in 1975 he recorded the very ﬁne “Every Day i have to cry some” which reached #45 on the charts, but the next recording, “sharing The Night Together,” did nothing until covered by Dr. hook and the Medicine show in 1978 when it peaked at #6. in the late 1970s he inexplicably decided he was through with music and simply dropped out of sight. alexander moved to cleveland and spent most of the rest of his life working as a bus driver and janitor, and alexander’s co-workers had no idea who he was until 1993, when he recorded his comeback album, Lonely Like Me. shortly thereafter, he suffered a fatal heart attack and died at the age of ﬁfty-three. Keith richards of the rolling stones said, “When the Beatles and the stones got their\n\n\n\nThe Artistics\n\nﬁrst chances to record, one did ‘anna,’ and the other did ‘you Better Move on.’ That should tell you enough.” ultimately, alexander is perhaps the only performer to have his songs covered by Bob Dylan, Elvis, The Beatles, and the rolling stones—and of course many others. considering his many contributions to his own catalogue as well songs he wrote and/or recorded and others covered, it isn’t hard to see that alexander was an underappreciated genius often laboring in relative obscurity.\n\nThe Artistics BEach Music Discography: “This heart of Mine” (okeh 4–7232, 1965: Billboard pop #115); “i’m gonna Miss you” (Brunswick 55301, 1966: Billboard pop #55). Formed in chicago in 1958, aaron Floyd, curt Thomas, Laurence Johnson and Jesse Bolian made up the original artistics, and the group got their ﬁrst opportunity to play a big venue at the Democratic National convention in 1960. Thereafter they were joined by new lead vocalist robert Dobyne, and soon they came to the attention of Major Lance, who in 1962 had signed with okeh records as a solo act. For Major Lance’s second recording on okeh in august 1963, he enlisted the artistics as backup singers on “The Monkey Time,” which peaked at #8 on the Billboard charts. okeh gave them their own recording contract, and they recorded “i Need your Love” in 1963 before problems within the group forced Dobyne out and charles Davis, formerly of the Dukays, took over in his place. Davis was eventually replaced by Marvin smith, who had been a member of several groups including the Four Eldorados and the Tempos. smith sang lead for “get My hands on some Lovin,’” which was recorded in January 1964. Their next recording for okeh was 1965’s “This heart of Mine,” written by Barrett strong of “Money (That’s What i Want)” fame. strong, who by 1965 had moved more towards writing than performing, gave the group their ﬁrst real hit, and even though “This heart of Mine” rose no higher than #115 on the pop charts, it did go to #25 on the r&B charts. They followed this with their album Get My Hands On Some Lovin,’ but after several more recordings in 1965 and 1966, internal struggles at okeh resulted in several artists leaving the label and going to Brunswick with producer carl Davis. Brunswick, which was or would be the home of Jackie Wilson, gene chandler, Lavern Baker, and others, signed the artistics as well, and their ﬁrst recording was the Marvin smith–led “i’m gonna Miss you.” Though not a big hit—it only climbed to #55 on the pop charts and #9 on the r&B charts—it was nevertheless a step in the right direction, and at long last the artistics seemed poised to break out. on the strength of that record they played the apollo Theatre in New york, the uptown in philadelphia, the royal in Baltimore and the howard in Washington, among others. But yet again, changes in the lineup would affect the group’s continuity. smith had left for a solo career (he had already recorded “Time stopped” backed by the artistics in 1966), and Tommy green had now come onboard as the lead vocalist while Bernard reed also joined the group. oddly enough, even though smith had left in 1967,\n\nThe Astors\n\n9\n\nBrunswick continued to releases singles and two albums he performed on throughout 1968 and 1969. in the meantime, green left and was replaced by Fred pettis, who only recorded one single with the group. reportedly pettis’ stage presence was so bad he was let go as well. The artistics would release one more single that they thought had potential, “Make My Life over,” with old member robert Dobyne back on lead. it also failed to chart, the group changed leads again (Morris Williams) and at this point they asked Brunswick to release them from their contract because they felt they were being ignored by the label. Brunswick wouldn’t comply, and rather than stay with the label the group disbanded in 1973.\n\nThe Astors BEach Music Discography: “candy” (stax 170, 1965: Billboard pop #63). curtis Johnson, Eliehue stanback, sam Jones, and richard harris formed the Duntinos while schoolmates at in high school in Memphis, Tennessee, in the late 1950s. along with richard griﬃn, the group had been organized by piano player herman “red” arnett, and initially they picked up gigs singing the types of doo-wop tunes that were popular at the time. rufus Thomas, who would later have a hit with “Walking the Dog,” took the group under his wing and they went on the road with Thomas for a while until they were out of high school. Eventually they decided to live with Johnson’s relatives in Buffalo, New york, ﬁguring it would put them closer to the heart of the big time in New york city. But soon they were back in Memphis, working as backup singers for artists such as carla Thomas at a new company called satellite records—soon to become stax. starting afresh, the group changed their name to the chips and recorded their ﬁrst record as a featured act in 1961 on stax 105, a song called “you Make Me Feel so good.” The song did nothing, griﬃn left the group and Johnson joined the air Force, but like William Bell (see the entry for Bell), who was also at stax, Johnston continued to record for the label while on leave. By 1963 they had changed their name to the astors, and that year released “What can it Be?” a song written by guitarist Larry Lee, who would later work with Jimi hendrix at Woodstock, and even later, with al green. That song failed to chart as well, and so after three name changes and three singles, and having worked with a number of famous or soon-to-be famous artist and writers, the group looked destined to join the hundreds of other groups around the country who had had a small taste of success but not enough to sustain them. Their big break came when guitarist steve cropper of Booker T. & the M.g.s and isaac hayes, who would later be a superstar in his own right, wrote the group a song called “candy,” which was recorded and released in 1965. at last the group had a taste of the success they had been looking for, as the song went to #12 on the r&B charts and #63 on pop charts. suddenly the astors were in demand, and performed with a number of notable acts such as The coasters, The impressions, Booker T. & the M.g.s, and James Brown. They not only played the apollo Theater, but they also appeared on Where the Action Is, Hollywood A-Go-Go, and performed at nightclubs on the sunset strip in hollywood.\n\n2\n\nThe Bad Habits\n\nyet like many groups before and after them, the magic was ﬂeeting, as they failed to follow up their ﬁrst effort with another hit. Their next release (which hayes also co-wrote), “in the Twilight Zone,” failed to chart. harris left the group, and after cutting one more noncharting record for stax, 1967’s “More power to you” (with another hayes co-writing credit), members started to go their separate ways. harold and curtis joined the group Brothers unlimited, and curtis Johnson went to work for Mercury records. a few sides they had recorded at stax were later released on ace records, but none charted and by that time the group had disintegrated.\n\nThe Bad Habits BEach Music Discography: “Night owl” (paula 327, 1970: Did Not chart). Debby Folse (often credited as Debbie Folse or Debby Falls) came from a musical family of six children (her father pott is a member of the Louisiana Music hall of Fame), and when she was just 11 she recorded her ﬁrst single backed on the piano by Mac rebennack, who would later gain fame as Dr. John. she recorded “you shouldn’t have” and “hurry hurry” as Debbie Falls on the Virgil label out of New orleans, and while still in high school she joined a band called the Lads, which eventually became Debbie and the Ladds. This group won a number of singing competitions and ended up winning a Battle of the Bands contest in Louisiana, ultimately heading to New york city for national competition. They continued to play clubs and concerts in Louisiana and at one point opened for herman’s hermits and also appeared with The Who and the Blue Magoos in Baton rouge. They recorded a single, “Dear Lord above” on the local Ladd label, and in 1969 after she graduated from high school, Debbie and the Ladds—now consisting of Debbie Folse, pershing Wells, rick Folse and ronnie plaisance—signed a contract with stan Lewis’s paula records in shreveport and changed their name to The Bad habits. For their ﬁrst single the group covered “it’s Been a Long Time coming,” a song that Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett had released as a single in 1968. The song was well suited for Debbie Folse’s vocal range as she sounded somewhat like Bonnie Bramlett, and so for the Bside they did a throwaway called “Night owl.” The song was a cover of “Nite owl,” a 1955 release by New orleans group Tony allen and the champs on the specialty label, which had been covered by the righteous Brothers in 1965 and paula labelmates John Fred and the playboy Band for an Lp in 1966. When the Bad habits went into the studio in Tyler, Texas, to record the song there was a diﬃcult solo that guitarist pershing Wells couldn’t work out, so manager gene Kent asked Mouse and the Traps guitarist and Tyler resident “Bugs” henderson to step in and play. When ﬁnished, the song was relegated to the ﬂip side of the record, but perhaps because of composer Tony allen’s Louisiana connection, New orleans DJs ﬂipped the record and “Night owl” ended up getting the airplay. reportedly the song was a #1 hit in some regional markets and was listed by Billboard as a regional breakthrough song, though it never made the Billboard or Cash Box Top 100.\n\nRazzy Bailey\n\n2\n\nThe group released two more singles on paula in 1970 and 71, but by then Debby Folse was married and had a child. The group decided to go their separate ways, and because they were a popular regional act Kent decided to form a new group behind rick Folse to capitalize on their name. Folse and Bob Fell, sonny Williams (and later Nick pratt), ron Diiulio and Fred Engelke, most of whom had recorded as Noel on Tower records, emerged as the new Bad habits. The group recorded three singles on paula in 1971 and 1972, none of which charted. Debby Folse (chiasson) eventually returned to the music business when Debbie and the Ladds reformed brieﬂy, and over the years appeared with groups such as the pott Folse Family Band, the country sunshine Band, the Breeze Band, the Down home Band, and others.\n\nRazzy Bailey BEach Music Discography: “i hate hate” (MgM 14728, 1974: Billboard pop #67). Born rasie Michael Bailey in Lafayette, alabama, Bailey’s ﬁrst experience singing was in high school as a member of a Future Farmers of america band. after high school he turned his love of music into a career playing small clubs in alabama and georgia, writing songs all the while and eventually signing with atlanta promoter Bill Lowery. he cut his ﬁrst record, “9,999,999 Tears,” backed by an all-star combo of then relatively unknown artists including Billy Joe royal and Joe south. The song did nothing, but Bailey continued to record sides and a couple of albums on regional labels for the next few years. around 1972 he recorded a song he had written, “i hate hate,” for Bobby smith’s Boblo records based in Macon, georgia, and the label credits it to “razzy” Bailey. Though it is unlikely that most people have ever heard this rather rare version, it is perhaps the best version of the three recordings of the song which would ultimately be released. recorded in mono as opposed to the later stereo releases, this song has regular back-up singers (not the “neighborhood kids”), no strings or piano, and is much more soulful with a strong bass line and drumbeat. Many listeners have compared it to archie Bell and the Drells’ “Tighten up” in an instrumental sense, and its raw unadulterated sound sounds like many of the beach songs released in the 1960s. Despite the song’s high quality it languished for two years before being re-recorded on Nashville-based aquarian records in 1974. This cut is credited to razzy Bailey and the Neighborhood Kids, and Bailey is backed by his group the aquarians while preschool children sing the chorus to the song and clap in the background. This version was recorded in stereo, and despite the merits of the song, this is clearly a case where wellenough should have been left alone; the result is an over- produced mess which many listeners have described as “screeching” or “screaming” kids in the background. considering that social activism was at its peak in this country in the early 1970s, having a studio full of children sing about how they “hate hate” probably seemed like a good idea at the time. surprisingly, this is probably the cut that many beach music lovers ﬁrst heard in the carolinas, as the aquarian version sold half-a-million copies in the south.\n\n22\n\nLavern Baker\n\nafter the popularity of the aquarian version, MgM picked it up for national distribution. in this version, which is simply credited to “razzy,” the children’s voices were mixed down and only become intrusive during the last 30 seconds of the record. There is a little clapping, and the strings are more prominent in this version. Though the song is clearly preferable to the aquarian version, it still lacks the soulful feel of the Boblo release. This recording of the song made the national charts, peaking at #67 on the pop charts in May 1974. Even given the record’s limited success, Bailey still hadn’t found his proper milieu, and it wasn’t until Dickey Lee released his own version of Bailey’s “9,999,999 Tears” in 1976 that people started to really notice Bailey as a prominent songwriter and then a singer as well. Bailey signed with rca in 1978, and over the course of the next decade he released more than 30 songs which made the country charts, and thirteen of them would make the Top 10 and ﬁve of them would go to #1. The result of Bailey’s massive chart success was that the soulful sound heard on “i hate hate” would be relegated to the background. Nevertheless, for a brief moment in time, Bailey was a star in beach music circles even before he would go on to take the world of country music by storm.\n\nLavern Baker BEach Music Discography: “Tweedle Dee” (atlantic 1047, 1954: Billboard pop #14); “you’re the Boss” (with Jimmy ricks) (atlantic 2090, 1961: Billboard pop #81). Delores Lavern Baker was born into a musical family and sang in her church choir, and so it was no surprise when at age 17 she began singing on the chicago club circuit. The ﬁve-foot-tall Baker was billed as “Little Miss sharecropper” and dressed like a farmhand, but despite the fact that Baker disliked the gimmick she had an extremely popular act. she recorded some unreleased sides under that name in the late 1940s, and by 1947 she had relocated to Detroit, gotten married, and ﬁnally released a few singles on rca and National under the Little Miss sharecropper stage name. None of these sides charted, and by 1951 she had dropped the Little Miss sharecropper tag (though the name would follow her for a while) and started working as Bea Baker. in 1952 she ﬁnally started recording as Lavern Baker. in 1952 and 53 Baker recorded a few records, toured with a group in Europe, and then returned to the u.s. and signed with atlantic records. her ﬁrst two records did nothing, but the third, 1954’s “Tweedlee Dee,” was a hit on both the r&B charts (#4) and the pop charts (#14) at a time when crossover hits by black artists still were not all that common. What was common at the time was that white artists would cover songs by black artists for “white” radio, and in this case georgia gibbs did what was basically a note-for-note cover version for Mercury that even used the same backup singers and most of the same musicians that that Baker’s version had used. gibbs’ version went to #1 on the pop charts, and an infuriated Baker unsuccessfully tried to get congress to make that type of duplication illegal. Though it was precedent setting, the suit failed and the bill did not pass.\n\nHank Ballard and the Midnighters\n\n2\n\nBaker would follow “Tweedlee Dee” with several Top 10 r&B songs before recording “Jim Dandy,” which topped the r&B charts for 18 weeks and also went to #17 on the pop charts. The recording sold more than a million units and earned a gold record, and Baker was now ﬁrmly entrenched as an up-and-coming rock and roller. she appeared in the several rock ﬁlms, toured, and continued to have records on both charts, including “i cried a Tear,” which made the pop and r&B Top 10. in 1961 she recorded a song considered a seminal beach hit, “you’re the Boss” with Jimmy ricks. ricks had been the lead singer and co-founder of the ravens of “green Eyes” fame (see the entry for Jimmy ricks and The ravens), but had been working, largely unsuccessfully, as a solo act for a number of years. The Jerry Leiber and Mike stoller penned tune only made it to #81 on the pop charts. Eventually Baker left atlantic for Brunswick, where she recorded an odd duet with Jackie Wilson called “Think Twice” in 1966. Though the “clean” version made the r&B charts at #37 and the pop charts at #93, it was her last chart record to break the Top 100 on either chart. Baker was performing for u.s. troops during the Vietnam War when she developed pneumonia and had to be hospitalized in the philippines. she ended up staying there for two decades, performing and working as the entertainment director at a military nightclub on the subic Bay Naval Base. she eventually returned to the u.s. and started performing again, and in 1991 became the second solo female artist indicted into the rock and roll hall of Fame after aretha Franklin. a diabetic, later in life she had both legs amputated due to medical complications; she passed away from heart disease in 1997.\n\nHank Ballard and the Midnighters BEach Music Discography: “Work with Me annie” (Federal 12169, 1954: pre-Billboard pop charts—r&B charts #1); “annie had a Baby” (Federal 12195, 1954: pre-Billboard pop charts—r&B charts #1). in 1950, charles sutton was singing at an amateur show in Detroit when he met Freddie pride, sonny Woods, alonzo Tucker, and henry Booth, all of whom wanted to form a singing group, The royals, in the mold of the orioles or the Dominoes. soon they were entering amateur contests singing cover tunes, but after just a few months pride was drafted. he recommended Lawson smith, who joined the group in his place, and in 1951 the new line-up won an amateur contest at Detroit’s paradise Theater. singer Johnny otis was playing there that week, and he told the group he wanted to manage them and that he could get them a contract with Federal records. The royals agreed to his terms and otis got them signed to Federal, and although Lawson smith was soon drafted, they were able to get a few songs recorded before he left for active duty. once again down a member, they added a friend of Woods’ named John Kendricks, who changed his name to hank Ballard, using a family surname. The group released a half dozen singles in 1952 and 1953 before they hit with “get it,” which climbed to #6 on the r&B charts. The song had suggestive lyrics and was banned in some markets, but this would come to be a hallmark of the group’s records throughout the decade. in 1954 they were working with a&r man ralph Bass who had an idea for a record, or at least a partial lyric: “work with me.” he sat down with Ballard and they wrote the classic, “Work with Me, annie.” Ballard told andrew Edelstein in an interview for Goldmine that they chose annie to go with the “work with me” phrase simply because “it was just a good commercial name. you know, ‘annie get your gun,’ ‘Little orphan annie.’.. it’s just a catchy name. it could have been ‘Work with Me Mary’ or ‘Work with Me sue.’” Despite being banned by some stations for its suggestive lyrics, “Work with Me annie” became a hit almost overnight, reached #1 on the r&B charts and crossed over onto the pop charts climbing to #22. While Federal clearly had a successful act on its hands, trouble was brewing in the form\n\n2\n\nHank Ballard and the Midnighters\n\nof another group, the “5” royales, with whom the royals were often confused. Federal told its group they had to change their name to The Midnighters, and so while early copies of “Work With Me annie” were released as being by the royals, even as the record was riding the charts it was being released by the Midnighters as well. The group’s next big release was “sexy Ways,” a record no doubt designed to cement their standing as a group who sang risque music—which was clearly what the public really wanted, despite the fact that the group’s records continued to be banned. The record went to #2 on the r&B charts, and was followed by “annie had a Baby,” which passed “sexy Ways” and went to #1 on the r&B charts. a perhaps apocryphal story about the song was that before the record existed a DJ on the West coast made an off-hand comment to the effect that if listeners thought “Work With Me annie” was scandalous, wait till they got a load of “annie had a Baby.” apparently listeners were calling record stores asking for the single, and so Federal quickly wrote it, had the group record it, and got it out there. This second annie hit opened the door for a legion of imitators, including “annie pulled a hum-Bug” (the Midnights), “annie’s answer” (hazel Mccollum & El Dorados’), “i’m The Father of annie’s Baby”(Danny Taylor), “My Name ain’t annie”(Linda hayes & platters), and “annie Kicked The Bucket” (the Nu-Tones)—and those were just in 1954. Even the Midnighters got in on the act again, recording “annie’s aunt Fannie” which went to #10 on the r&B charts. it was at about this point that sutton was forced to leave the group for medical reasons, and ultimately the Midnighters moved on without him. at ﬁrst it seemed as if sutton got out at the right time, as from 1955 to 1959 the group didn’t have a single release make the charts, and that included 1958’s “Baby please,” which had some play in the beach clubs. Then in 1959 they changed their name to hank Ballard and the Midnighters, went to Federal’s parent label, King, and their ﬁrst release was “The Twist.” The song had been written by the sensational Nightingales, but because it was somewhat suggestive they shopped it around and ﬁnding no takers ﬁnally Ballard agreed to record it. it was actually released as the B-side of the record but nevertheless went to #6 on the r&B charts in 1959, then to #28 on the pop charts and #6 on the r&B charts again when re- released in 1960. The best known version was chubby checker’s cover, which reached #1 on the pop charts in 1962 and 1963, making it the only song to hit #1 in two different years through two different releases. The 1959 release of the “The Twist” would kick off a period of the group’s greatest chart success, although their later recordings were not as popular in beach clubs. hits such as “Finger poppin’ Time,” “Let’s go, Let’s go, Let’s go,” and others would chart through 1962. The group released records up through 1968, and Ballard went solo that year. Ballard was inducted into the rock and roll hall of Fame in 1990, while the Midnighters were inducted as a group in 2012. Ballard, who was the cousin of Florence Ballard of the supremes, died in 2003.\n\nThe Band of Oz\n\n2\n\nThe Band of Oz BEach Music Discography: “shaggin’” (Mega 18830, 1978: Did Not chart). The Band of oz got their start in grifton, North carolina, in the late 1960s as The avengers, and the core of the group consisted of Johnnie Byrd, Buddy Johnson and Keith houston. By 1970 they had changed their name to the Band of oz, added horns and expanded their playlist as they played the party and club circuit. By the mid–1970s their line up consisted of chuck French, Bob Lynch, ronnie Forbes, shep Fields, Freddy Tripp, Billy Bazemore, David hicks, and Keith houston, and they performed across the south. after “playing fulltime traveling all over the southeast” for several years but “tired of being on the road,” houston said the group decided to go back to their roots, and specialize by playing what was known in the carolinas as beach music. “We ﬁgured … we could go back to North carolina and do\n\nThe Band of Oz, circa 9 (photograph courtesy Keith Houston).\n\n26\n\nDarrell Banks\n\nthat type of music again. The disco era was fading, and so we came back home started playing the old beach music that we used to play. it was actually getting big then, and new beach music was being written as well.” That new music, in the form of songs such as “summertime’s callin Me” by The catalinas, “i Love Beach Music” by the Embers, and “Myrtle Beach Days” by the Fantastic shakers, was extremely popular and the Band of oz decided to offer up their own contribution in the form of “shaggin” in 1978. “Billy Bazemore was our lead vocalist, and he came in one day and said ‘Look, i gotta set of lyrics here, i’ve written a song’” houston told me. “Well, he pulls out four pages of lyrics—it was probably three or four songs! i took it and edited down and put the music to it. and though we had two or three songs worth of lyrics, we did get one real good hit out of it.” They tested it out by playing it in their act, and after “playing it live before we ever made the record … we decided to record it. it was the ﬁrst time our band had actually been in the studio.” The band went to Mega sound in Bailey North carolina and recorded the song with Bazemore singing lead. “you never know what’s going to happen when you make a record” houston said, “but we got a good response. We started pushing it at the radio stations. all the beach jocks started to play it, and it got a lot of airplay. Then when ripete records came in and put together that ﬁrst Beach Beat album, and it had ‘shaggin’ on it along with ‘Myrtle Beach Days,’ ‘i Love Beach Music,” and a lot of national releases, it locked it in as a beach music hit.” at ﬁrst, nothing they did could really follow up “shaggin’” as far as audiences were concerned, and even though “We recorded another song about that time, ‘song of my Life,’ it never did anything, because “shaggin’ overshadowed it.” There were a few more personnel changes, and in 1982, another big hit came along—actually one that was even bigger—when they recorded “ocean Boulevard,” which was written and produced by general Johnson and Warren Moise. That song went on to win song of the year at the carolina Beach Music awards and the accolades have followed the Band of oz almost nonstop over the years since. They’ve done so many songs since “shaggin’” that houston says “we don’t play ‘shaggin’ all that much now. Even though it was one of the biggest selling things we did, we only play it once in a great while. We get more requests for ‘shama Lama Ding Dong’ and ‘over the rainbow’ than ‘shaggin’ and ‘ocean Boulevard.’ But you know, i think it’s one of those things that if we did it every night, we’d be indoctrinating another group of kids, because most people are more familiar with the newer stuff. But they are still great songs.” and even though they might not play those older hits as much as they used to, they still stand as seminal beach music songs that came out as the genre was making its transition from a collection of national releases appropriated for use as beach music, to a genre that was increasingly creating songs all its own. houston and the band continue to perform today.\n\nDarrell Banks BEach Music Discography: “open the Door to your heart” (revilot 201, 1966: Billboard pop #27). Darrell Banks grew up in Buffalo, New york, and like many young men who sang r&B in the 1950s and ’60s, he got his start singing with gospel groups before he turned his talents to solo musical pursuits. he would often play at the revilot Lounge in Buffalo, and there his friend Donnie Elbert wrote a song for him called “Baby Walk right in”—the actual working title of “open the Door to your heart.” The song would take Banks off the lounge circuit and put him in a studio in Detroit to record the song, which went all the way to #27 on the Billboard hot 100 and to #2 in the r&B listings. suddenly, Banks was a hot singing commodity and Elbert had written a hit song.\n\nGene Barbour and the Cavaliers\n\n2\n\nhowever, when the record came out, Elbert noticed that Banks, and not he, was credited with writing the song. Willing to give Banks the beneﬁt of the doubt, Elbert attempted to correct what he assumed was a clerical error but was shocked to learn that the song’s rights had been given to Banks not because of an error but because Banks had told the record company (and indeed had ﬁlled out documents saying) that he alone had written the song. after a protracted legal battle, Elbert was at last able to get himself listed as co- songwriter but only as a co- writer because apparently Banks had made some minor changes, such as speeding up the tempo, so Banks was given 50 percent authorship. perhaps it’s indicative of the injustice of Banks’s perﬁdy that while Elbert would go on to write well more than one hundred songs, “open the Door to your heart” is the only song for which Banks would ever receive a songwriting credit. Banks stayed with revilot for one more single, “somebody (somewhere) Needs you,” which hit #55 that same year. Banks moved to atco and then cotillion, where none of his releases would chart. stax records signed him to its Volt subsidiary on for a couple of singles, though chart success would elude him there as well. plagued by personal and professional demons, while waiting at his estranged girlfriend’s house one afternoon in February 1970, he saw her return home in the company of another man. an infuriated Banks pulled a gun on him, despite the fact that the man identiﬁed himself as off-duty policeman aaron Bullock. Faced with being shot himself, Bullock shot Banks in the neck and the chest; he was declared dead at the hospital at the age of thirty-two.\n\nGene Barbour and the Cavaliers BEach Music Discography: “i Need a Love” (hit 101, 1966: Did Not chart). gene Barbour and The cavaliers started as simply The cavaliers, and when they got together in 1963, they were charles aycock, Walt Jones, paul Mattox and Donald hobson, all of whom were in the band at Dunn high school in Dunn, North carolina. The band started out like many others, playing high school gigs whenever they could get them. Feeling that with a little direction they could improve their sound and bookings, they hired Jones’ uncle harry Driver to be their manager. Driver brought in Tommy ralph to play bass, and with aycock singing lead, the group became a successful local act. Next Driver found gene Barbour, who had his own group called gene Barbour & The shakedowns, and he was added as lead singer. Billy Wellons then joined, and the pieces all seemed to be in place. Driver had the group record a song Mattox and Barbour had co-written titled “Nobody.” Though the record is now a collector’s item, the original recording only sold “probably 100 units or so” according to hobson. Nevertheless, in the summer of 1966 Driver decided to take them to Bill Lowery’s studio in atlanta to record once again, and one of the songs they recorded was “i Need a Love.” produced by Ted hall’s charlotte-based Hit Attractions, the song, which the impressions had released as the single “i Need you” in 1965 (Billboard #64),\n\n2\n\nGene Barbour and the Cavaliers\n\nGene Barbour and the Cavaliers, 966 (photograph courtesy Donald Hobson).\n\n“sold pretty well regionally but nothing really signiﬁcant,” hobson said. The group always thought that the song was retitled by the cavaliers management, but hobson discovered that the release of their single “i Need you,” the impressions released their 1966 Lp “ridin high,” which contains the exact song that charted except that on the Lp it had a new title—“i Need a Love.” This is the song that hobson’s group would record—word for word, title and all—in 1967. as a result, the mistake was on the impressions album, and not a change made by the cavaliers’ management. The group would become one of the most popular bands in the carolinas and played with and opened for groups including the Four Tops, Martha & the Vandellas, the platters and smokey robinson & the Miracles. yet despite their success, like many groups performing in the late 1960s, several members of the group were eventually drafted or enlisted. By the\n\nChris Bartley\n\n29\n\nearly 1970s, the gene Barbour & The cavaliers group that had recorded “i Need a Love” was no more. The group did reunite as the original Men of Distinction, but they never cut a song with the staying power that “i Need a Love” has had.\n\nChris Bartley BEach Music Discography: “The sweetest Thing This side of heaven” (Vando 101, 1967: Billboard pop #32). harlem-born chris Bartley began his performing career in the late 1950s as a member of a group called the soulful inspirations, who would change their name and personnel several times before settling on the name The Mindbenders. While searching for a label, they auditioned for songwriter, producer, and singer Van Mccoy (who would later become well known for 1975’s “The hustle”). Though Mccoy was not interested in signing the group, he was impressed by Bartley, and signed him to a solo contract group with the new cameo subsidiary label Vando, owned by Mccoy and Douglas henderson (VAN and DOug). The label’s ﬁrst release on Vando 101 was Bartley singing “The sweetest Thing This side of heaven,” a song Mccoy had written. The song sounds very much like a Motown/smokey robinson release, and perhaps as a result the song went to #10 on the r&B charts and #32 on the pop charts. over the course of the next year Bartley would release four more singles and an album on Vando, all written, accompanied, and produced by Mccoy. But despite this promising beginning and constant touring, nothing else would chart. The Vando label folded after just seven single releases, but Mccoy had enough faith in Bartley that he facilitated his signing with Buddah records. For Buddah he recorded two singles, “Baby i’m yours,” his cover of the Barbara Lewis song that Mccoy had also written, and “i Know We can Work it out,” which was a re-recording of “sugar Baby,” a Mccoy-penned song from his Vando album. Neither single was successful, and not long afterwards Bartley brieﬂy retired from the music business to look after his ailing mother. he started recording again in 1971, signed with Musicor for one unsuccessful single, and then released his last single in 1975 on the right-on label, which was only available in England. he later joined the ad-Libs, and in the ’80s even re-recorded “The sweetest Thing This side of heaven,” but he would have no further chart success. Bartley died of kidney failure in 2009 at the age of 52.\n\n\n\nFontella Bass\n\nFontella Bass BEach Music Discography: “rescue Me” (checker 1120, 1965: Billboard pop #4). Fontella Marie Bass was born in st. Louis Missouri, and both her grandmother Nevada carter and her mother Martha Bass were gospel singers. Fontella’s mother had sung with a gospel quartet under the guidance of Willa Mae Ford smith, and had also been a member of the clara Ward singers, and so Fontella was immersed in gospel from a very early age. she began singing in the church choir when she was six, learned to play the piano and organ, and by the time she was nine she was touring and singing with her mother. as a teen, however, Fontella became interested in secular music, and after graduating from st. Louis’s soldan high school she auditioned for a singing job with the Leon claxton carnival. she won the job and after performing for two weeks she decided to go on the road with them. Even though Fontella was 18 her mother refused to let her go, but her appearances with the carnival had come to the notice of r&B singer Little Milton and his bandleader, oliver sain. They hired her to back Little Milton, but on one occasion Little Milton was late for a gig and sain asked Bass to take the stage in his stead. This led to solo appearances in Milton’s show, as well as single releases on sain’s Bobbin records and working with ike and Tina Turner and the ikettes as well as singles on Turner’s prann label. None of the releases charted, however. in 1964 Bass and her husband, saxophonist Lester Bowie, moved to chicago and she signed with chess records. chess had her record two singles with Bobby Mcclure, and both “Don’t Mess up a good Thing” (#33 pop, #5 r&B) and “you’ll Miss Me When i’m gone” (#91 pop, #27 r&B charted) were released on the checker subsidiary. her ﬁrst solo release on checker was 1965’s “rescue Me,” a record that would not only be a national chart success but would generate interest with beach music audiences as well. on the recording Bass was supported by several later-notable singers and musicians, including Maurice White, later of Earth, Wind and Fire, who played drums on the track, and backing vocalists included Leonard caston, later a member of the radiants who sang on “Voice your choice” and co-lead on “it ain’t No Big Thing,” as well as Minnie riperton, who would come into her own as a solo artist a decade later. reportedly the lyric sheet fell off of the music stand when they were recording, and so Bass hummed her way out of the song instead of singing the song as written while her manager Billy Davis went around the room tapping the musicians on the shoulder one at a time to get them to stop playing. chess decided to use the cut, impromptu or not, and the song went to #1 on the r&B charts for 11 weeks and made it to #4 on the pop charts. it surpassed a million units in sales, and was the ﬁrst million seller the label had had since chuck Berry’s 1955 hit “Maybelline.” Though many people have compared Bass’s singing on the track to aretha Franklin, Franklin was little known in 1965, and wouldn’t have a Top 10 pop or #1 r&B hit for two more years. The label followed the single with an album,\n\nWilliam Bell\n\n\n\nThe New Look, as well as a follow-up single, “recovery,” but neither performed particularly well and the single only went to #37 on the pop charts and #13 on the r&B charts in 1966. “recovery” would be her last pop Top 40 hit, and just three more r&B Top 40 songs would follow; by 1967 her time on the charts had ended. ironically, Bass would always claim that the success of “rescue Me” was to some extent responsible for derailing her career. chess staff writers and carl William smith and raynard Miner were credited as the songwriters, but Bass apparently made signiﬁcant contributions to the track and expected to receive label credit. she did not, but said she was told by her manager that even though it wasn’t on the label the record company paperwork listed her as a co-writer. When she received her ﬁrst royalty check for the song she realized it was so small that she knew she’d been lied to, and reportedly tore the check up on the spot. her relationship with chess became contentious, and she left the label the next year. it was only through continued litigation that she ﬁnally received due credit for the song in the late 1980s, but even at that point she still had to ﬁght to protect her artistic rights. as late as the 1990s she had to sue american Express for the unauthorized use of the song in a commercial. Even before the 1980s and ’90s however, ﬁghting for her rights cost her dearly, and she had been tagged with a reputation as a troublemaker due to the controversy over ‘rescue Me” in the 1960s. she always felt Leonard chess had her blackballed in the industry, and certainly after she left the label nothing she recorded charted. she and her husband moved to France until 1972 and then came back to the states, and after raising her children she concentrated on jazz and also gospel music. she occasionally performed with her mother as well as her younger brother David peaston, who himself had a half dozen r&B chart hits between 1989 and 1991. in 1995 her gospel album No Ways Tired was nominated for a grammy, and she continued to record until her health no longer permitted it. in 2012 Bass died from complications from a heart attack and several strokes that she had suffered towards the end of her life.\n\nWilliam Bell BEach Music Discography: “Easy comin’ out (hard goin’ in)” (Mercury 73961, 1977: Billboard pop Did Not chart, r&B #30). William Bell’s career as an entertainer had a promising start when he won a talent contest in in his hometown of Memphis as a teenager. in addition to a $500 cash prize, Bell (who was born William yarborough) was invited to go to chicago and do a weekend gig with the red saunders Band at club Delisa. saunders was impressed with the young man and recommended him to a man named phineas Newborn, who let Bell sub in as a vocalist on and off for the next few years. Bell also became a member of the Del rios along with harrison austin, Melvin Jones, and David Brown, and in the late ’50s along with the group recorded a couple of singles for the Meteor and Bet T labels. By the early ’60s Bell had signed with stax, scoring a minor hit with a song he had written called “you Don’t Miss your Water.” The song reached #95 on the Billboard hot 100, and it would be the ﬁrst of many successful sides Bell would record for the label in the 1960s. Bell served in the army from 1962 to 1966, but he was able to record enough material while on leave to enable stax to release new singles throughout his service in the army. None of them were very successful, but after his enlistment was up Bell had a couple of r&B hits before “Everybody Loves a Winner” crossed over to the pop charts in 1967. he was also writing material for other artists, including “Born under a Bad sign” (which would also be covered by cream) for albert King, and a song he wrote for himself and recorded in 1968, “i Forgot to Be your Lover,” would be recorded by Billy idol in 1986 as “To Be a Lover” and go to the #6 position on the pop charts.\n\n2\n\nWilliam Bell\n\nperhaps the most notable recording to come out of his stax years was 1968’s “private Number,” a duet with Judy clay (see the entry for Judy clay and William Bell). But after stax’s biggest star, otis redding, died in 1967, stax was in trouble. The label lost their distribution deal with atlantic records in 1968, and stax started to make some p"
