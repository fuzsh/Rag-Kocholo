The operation, which was coordi- nated by Newark's U.S. Attorney's office, raided Melody Recordings, Inc. Incentives. Inc. and Telecor In- dustries, Inc. in Fairfield; U.S. Tapes. Inc. in North Bergen; Stellar Sounds. Inc. in Bloomfield; Tape Mate, Inc. in Trenton and Ewing Township; and Purchase Power in Belleville. Among the equipment seized were: tape masters, dupli- cating and packaging equipment, blank tapes and empty cartridges, as well as labels and sleeves. The raids, which could result in a fine of not more than $1,000 and/or imprisonment of up to one year for the individuals involved, were coordinated by assistant U.S. Attor- ney Furman L. Templeton and di- rected by special FBI agent J. Wall- ace LaParade. U.S. Magistrate Jerome Schwitzer authorized the search warrants for the operation. 2 Labels Market Same '45' LOS ANGELES-In a rare and refreshing example of industry cooperation. Anthem and NAMI, two labels which found themselves with deals for exclu- sive U.S. licensing of the German hit, \"He,\" by Family Child, have agreed to joint distribution of the single rather than holding back release by suing each other. The record will be issued under a joint Anthem-NAMI logo and all profits and expenses shared equally. In most markets the labels had the same distribu- tors. But in the six cities where they don't, each company's distributor will get a share of the product. NAMI is the logo abbreviation for North American Music Industries, a new New York label. Anthem is Lee LassefTs Hollywood company financed by Polydor. AGAC Hints Pubr. Audits; Writers Aided LOS ANGELES-The vigor ol new leadership in AGAC was evi- dent here Tuesday (19) when both President Ervin Drake and Execu- tive Director Lew Bachman laid out progressive programs.

AGAC's computerization pro- gram is continuing, he said, with the next step one wherein starting with notices for songs renewing in 1975. member will be notified of renewal in u calendar quarter one year ahead The quarterly reports will replace the individual letter notice. Back Court Decision: Brockway NEW YORK -On the heels of the historic U.S. Supreme Court deci- sion in Goldstein vs. California, Robert E. Brockway. president. Pol- ygram Corp., advised the presidents of the three Polygram record com- panies to support and press for local legislation in all remaining states where no protection exists. Brockway suggested that MGM Records. Phonogram- Mercury Records and Polydor Records urge local record stores to contact their legislators and stimulate enactment of piracy protection statutes. He added, \"The RIAA rates a vote of confidence for its role in repre- senting the industry before the Su- preme Court. Now it's up to the in- dustry, through state outlets for the product, to push for legislation. Most states still lack such laws. I hope dealers everywhere will join this fight, and that every record com- pany will make this its concern. (Continued on page 4) Bachman explained that in 1975 for the first lime under the 1947 AGAC contract, a writer through providing proper notice to the pub- lisher can have world rights to his song revert back to him. Member- ship will be sent a full explanatory notice this fall, he promised. AGAC is also exploring a non-profit divi- sion for educational purposes. Drake forecast that sometime in 1974 ASCAP would provide its members with itemized statement of foreign secondary payments, as BMI recently started doing. Drake also said that AGAC is backing Bur- ton Lane's universal coding concept to the hilt (Billboard. May 14). He also pledged AGAC's full support of the \"rap session\" program, being initiated in New York after a year's successful operation under the tute- lage of Arthur Hamilton here (Bill- board. June 23). Drake called the first publisher audit \"the most en- compassing audit ever taken by AGAC.\" but explained that the fact the audit was being taken did not re- flect on the publisher's honesty, merely wishing to \"confirm AGAC's suspicion that the publisher is right- doing.\" Drake also complimented Bill- board on its pioneering of the inclu- sion of writer's credits on its record/ tape charts. Finfer Places Grand With GSF NEW YORK-Record industry veteran Harry Finfer is putting his Grand label with Larry Newton's GSF label here for distribution. The first release will be \"Goodbye.

Jules Malamud. He said that \"Record piracy is a pernicious practice which must be stamped out if the industry is to sur- vive and NARM pledges its full ef- forts to the support of the enactment of additional state legislation and to assist in the prosecution of all legal remedies available to eliminate the practice.\" \"The battle against record piracy is not over,\" continued Malamud. \"But, we can now say that the valid- ity of the position of the legitimate sound recording industry in oppos- ing such piracy has been sustained by the U.S. Congress, in enacting federal copyright legislation, and by More Late News See Page 70 the U.S. Supreme Court, by up- holding the validity of slate criminal laws against piracy.\" He added that NARM anticipates that state and lo- cal authorities will increase their en- forcement efforts in \"those jurisdic- tions where statutes have been enacted.\" Stanley M. Gortikov, president of the RIAA, expressed \"gratitude over the U.S. Supreme Court's decision. He said that the court's decision \"re- moves any deterrent from vigorous enforcement of existing state anti-pi- racy laws. \"We also believe that the High Court's action will undoubtedly re- sult in a number of other states tak- ing positive action to pass such laws,\" continued Gortikov. \"Record piracy has become widespread in re- cent years becuase the profits have been high and the financial and le- gal risks low. Nationwide piracy di- verts more than S200-million a year from legitimate companies, artists and composers,\" said Gortikov. \"The court's decision will help slop the spread of piracy,\" stated Gortikov. \"Enforcement of the Fed- eral law by the Department of Jus- tice and the FBI has already been vigorous, and even stronger action has been promised by Justice De- partment officials,\" he said.

Some 5,000 soul bunny posters with the slogan, \"Warner Bros. Soul Bros.\" have been printed and are in distribution to record stores and ra- dio stations. Also 4,000 soul bunny tee shirts are being spread by WB sales and promotion men.

Soul bunny also appears on em- bossed plaques which are to be presented to soul station music di- rectors at photographed ceremonies with WB promotion men. Banks said, \"Companies that have been in r&b for a long time have their gold records on the walls at the key sta- tions. We want something from Warner on the walls for radio people to look at right away.\" Still another soul bunny appear- ance is on necklaces being given to female radio and merchandising personnel. \"The ladies have gener- ally been neglected in this sort of campaign,\" said Banks. Coinciding with the soul bunny displays are contests for WEA branch salesmen and promotion men.

The Real McCoy Dear Sir: I've enjoyed various articles on Ron Jacobs and KGB AM & PM, and even though they were quite in- formative, I'm finding it hard to un- derstand how you can spend so much lime writing about a pair of stations that have less cume au- dience now than when Mr. Jacobs took over in 1972. Especially in light of the fact that you could offer some- thing on KCBQ and Jack McCoy, a Program Director who's consistently turned in superior rating perform- ances here at \"Q\" in the face of over- whelming industry sympathy and support for progressive rock AM radio. As an ex-air personality, now turned sales manager, I am ob- viously interested in programming trends, especially because they de- termine my productiveness and live- lihood. So, I hope you'll understand my comments when I say I believe Jack McCoy deserves mention for a job well done. KCBQ has never been stronger, and Jack McCoy is a major reason for KCBQ's success. Best regards, Dcx Allen Local Sales Manager KCBQ San Diego the flights originated on American, at Cleveland they were transferred to Air Canada. The plaintiffs contend American is responsible since it sold the tickets and marked the baggage. The guitars were both Gibson 400's and THEIR worth was estab- lished atS1.500each. .Frank contends there is a \"known theft ring\" in the Cleveland area. Chet Atkins guitars, two of them, disappeared on a flight through that airport some months ago, and were never recovered. Frank said artist Faron Young caught someone in the same airport taking his guitar, but no prosecution resulted because it was not removed from the building. The attorney also stated that art- ists, to protect their guitars, must at times buy an extra passenger ticket for them. Marks New Exec Office NEW YORK-Edward B.

The company warned that the music industry may be assessed by the State of California for sales taxes on certain producer and artist royal- ties.

But so far, our overseas affiliates have eagerly welcomed the additional merchandising help we're now able to give them. And we will always be very careful not lo dictate to our af- filiates.\" Global Sales Double According lo Cornyn. one of the most significant recent corporate de- velopments at Warner has been (he doubling of overseas sales in the past IK months. WEA International, un- FREEDLAND der Nesuhi Ertegun and Phil Rose, has dropped licensees and set up its own companies in most key inter- national markets already. The policy will undoubtedly continue. \"Our goal is to get Warner Records to treat Belgium or Bang- kok as simply additional breakout markets with their own specialized tastes and business styles, just like Cleveland or Seattle.\" said Cornyn. Warner has already assembled videotape and film clips on most of its stars in action. This library will be heavily utilized by the new depart- ment. \"Take the Philippines, for ex- ample.\" said Cornyn. \"They get practicalK no rock concert tours out there but it's a strong record market. There's also excellent nationwide TV coverage. The demand for videotape rock segments is fantas- tic.\" Past experience has shown that overseas affiliates or licensees rarely get adequate servicing of U.S. artist publicity releases, photos or posters, Cornyn said. First major tests of the new WB international creative serv- ices concept will be autumn Europe lours by Van Morrison and the Doobie Brothers. WHO IS THE ONE MAN YOU CAN TRUST WITH YOUR LIFE?

Steiger noted that at Grambling University recently, the audience stood up and knew all the lyrics to \"The World Is a Ghetto\" from \"Cisco Kid.\" another contemporary property being grabbed up by marching bands. \"Young people are into marching bands,\" he said, \"the old fossils are gone who used lo do nothing but 'Poet & Peasant Overture.* Now the kids want Judy Collins and Don McLean.\" The contemporary wave is evident in the marching band packages from Charles Hansen with such titles as \"I Am Woman,\" \"Duelin' Banjos,\" \"Also Spraeh Zarathustra\" and \"Love Theme from Godfather.\" Walter Kane & Son were promot- ing five different folios of Carole King, eight Rolling Stones packages and dozens of more contemporary artists' works ranging from Bach- arach and Carpenters to Simon & Garfunkcl and Yes. Grossman Music Corp. plugged artists such as Kris KristofTerson, David Bowie, Alice Cooper, and complete packages such as \"Burning Love and 24 other Big Country Hits.\" The country influence is also im- portant with Mel Bay promoting such packages as \"Chord Sirummin' Songs for Guitar\" and \"Deluxe Al- bum of Folk, Country & Blue Grass Guitar Tunings.\" Rip Racks Rackjobbcrs are falling down, said Steiger, \"Because sheet music publishers are not used to nol being paid. Rackjobbers need to be more selective. My returns are normally 7 percent. If it weren't for racks, they would be 5 percent.\" He said rackjobbers make the mis- take of thinking folios and sheet mu- sic can be equated with records and tapes. He pointed to such dynamite LP acts as Deep Purple. Pink Floyd and Edgar Winter as being very dis- appointing in sheet music and folios. \"Whereas Judy Collins and Don McLean will sell out even if they have modest record sales.\" The obvious answer is specialized buyers at the rack level who under- stand sheet music. He said two ex- clusive rackers of sheet music and folios he sells will gross $4 million each this year. \"Our one big problem is distribu- tion. Many stores arc located poorly and have no sophisticated inventory control. It's a miracle we sell what we do. I would like to set up a franchise operation for senior citizens-I think this would be a great business for them.\" Overseas Problem Distribution is a hangup overseas too. said Steiger, where often agents do not exploit songs. \"I would like to see non-exclusive print arrange- ments so that we could promote in a given country where the agent was not doing a job.\" Nevertheless, with one in every three U.S. households owning a mu- sical instrument, the potential for sheet music and folio sales is unlim- ited. Steiger expects to do 200,000 sales in hard cover alone and 700,000 in paperback eventually on \"The Great Entertainer,\" a two set package that lists at $12.95 for piano-vocal and $14.95 for organ.

The inner sleeve is being redesigned again to picture more of the hard- ware licensees and this, will continue to be done on a rotating basis. Other information is also being updated, including the \"SQ Story\" and a list- ing of the off-shore licensees. Columbia has also published a booklet titled. \"Some Discrete Facts About SQ.\" The booklet evaluates the last two years of 4-channel sound, discussing the growth of hardware and software as well as how musicians, composers, produc- ers and engineers are now learning to work with quadrasonic sound as they once worked with stereo from monaural.

Jerry Ragovoy has brought a re- markable background to his post as the man behind New York's Hit Factor)'. In recent weeks, however. Ragovoy has been setting his sights on yet another field, and, with the announcement this week (see Music News) of the forming of Rags Records. Ragovoy has tackled the world of selling disks. Ragovoy 's initial approach is somewhat \"low-profile,\" he admits, but he sees little purpose in starting off with a flood of product. Indeed, in discussing present-day promotion activities. Ragovoy agreed with many critics of the rapid-fire ap- proach necessitated by large product releases. \"One of the reasons I started my label was that, whether I have just a production deal or my own label, I still have to contribute the same amount of legwork.\" he ex- plained, noting that \"work records\" have become a thing of the past for many promo men. Thus, Ragovoy is beginning with a single by Lou Courtney, an r&b stylist who had worked with Rago- voy some time ago. And, while working with a slowly but steadily growing stable of artists slated for Rags' release, Ragovoy is witnessing a strong session schedule in the stu- dio. Jim Croce has returned, working with C ashman and West, who have been producing Croce's next ABC album. Croce has also written a film title with Charles Fox (of Gimbel and Fox), with the vocal overdub handled at the Hit Factory, while Cashman and West are producing the next LP outing by Eric Andersen for Columbia. That marks Ander- sen's first step outside the Nashville arena in some time. Then Bill Szymczyk, last there for work on the Winters and J. Ceils, has returned for more of the same. He'll produce the next J. Geils sessions for Atlantic there in July, and is now working as engineer with producer Rick Derringer on Edgar Winter's next Epic recording. Other sessions: PG&E, pro- duced by John Hill ; Gold, a new act being produced for A&M by Joey Levine; the Fabulous Rhinestones, recently completing their next tracks for Just Sunshine; and, of course, Ragovoy himself, handling sessions both for Rags artists as well as other artists produced independently. ★ * * In New York, RCA's midtown stu- dios have been hosting a variety of sessions for label artists. Peter Ser- kin is working on his next Red Seal release, with engineer Dick Gardi- ner. In the pop vein, Carolyn Frank- lin is working with producer Jimmy RadclirTe and engineer Paul Good- man, while The ShireUes have been working on a new single with pro- ducer Randy Irwin and engineer Jim Crotri.

NEW YORK— As progressive rock acts continued to employ a wider range of electronic effects in the recording studio, concert au- diences can expect to sec many of those sonic elements begin to grace live performances. Eventide Clockworks, a profes- sional audio devices design and manufacturing firm here, has recently discovered that several of the company's specialized studio de- vices are being purchased by leading rock acts for onstage use. While Eventide is just one of several firms marketing such equipment, the firm markets only those designs, rather than a full line of studio equipment. Thus, while over 100 studios have purchased Eventide designs like the Instant Phaser, a sonic phasing de- vice; the Omnipressor, a special multi-purpose compression device: and the Digital Delay Lines, which afford a number of sonic effects through variation of timing between signals, only recently have these de- signs appeared onstage. Since then. Eventide has recog- nized the value of their designs for live acts, particularly in the case of the Digital Delay Line, which, in ef- fect, permits a form of \"over- dubbing\" onstage: by multiplying a given signal, from an instrument or voice, and separating the resulting signals by barely perceptible time increments, the Digital Delay Line multiplies a guitar or voice, provid- ing added body and richness. The value for background vocals is per- haps most immediately apparent. Engineer Jerry Masters shared production duties with John \"Rab- bit\" BundrtcL (he itinerant Texas keyboard man whose \"Broken Ar- rows\" LP was recently finished there and just shipped by Island. Don Davis has produced Johnny Taylor for Stax, and the new Dells' single for Cadet, while Don Covay pro- duced his own single for Decca. Then, picker Pete Carr produced the Court Pickett album for Elektra, while Peter Yarrow has been work- ing with the Muscle Shoals rhythm section, producing the next Yarrow album for Warner Bros. Finally. Atlantic's Jerry Wexler has been producing Gary Farr there, working with engineers Jerry Mas- ters and Steve Melton, who handled most of the sessions at Muscle Shoals. That effect can also be varied to provide other services, such as com- pensating for hall echo in larger venues created by long distances be- tween p.-a. speakers. Simulated tape delay is also available both on Even- tide's top-tine Digital Delay Line and somewhat less flexible, lower- priced counterpart. Bands using the Digital Delay Lines include a number of name acts, such as Yes, the Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin. Ten Years After, Hot Tuna. Jefferson Airplane and Todd Rundgren, all of whom employ elaborate studio technology during recording. Eventide is also approaching live acts to use its Instant Phaser, which offers various phasing effects, and the Omnipressor. a multi-purpose device which functions as a com- pressor, expander, limiter and noise gale device for noise reduction. The Omnipressor also functions as a dy- namic reverser, processing instru- ments and voices so that they sound as though they are being played \"backwards,\" as in tape reversing. Thus, Eventide's president, Rich- ard Factor, is now turning his sights toward the live talent world as an- other marketplace for his designs, offering bands demonstrations of their use either in their own re- hearsal quarters or at Eventide's home, Sound Exchange recording studios here, 265 West 54th Street. Demonstrations of those devices are also being made by Ken Schaf- fer, at his own penthouse at 21 West 58th Street. Talent Korea Kids, Darin Bill LAS VEGAS-The Little Angels of Korea, 35 children between the ages of eight and 15, will make their U.S. debut with Bobby Darin at the Hilton Hotel, beginning July 16. The MGM act will work both solo and with Darin. Their manager. Daniel Ben Av of MGM Produc- tions, and MGM's Stan Moress have been finalizing plans for the debut, with their new album slated for re- lease in conjunction with the Hilton appearance.

This is the largest group ever con- tracted for the Hilton stage. Under age. the children will live in the hotel but be barred from lingering in the casino area.

New York Fllcnne Harding, utilizing good vocal ability and a bouncy stage presence, deliv- ered an entertaining and amusing evening's fare in her appearance here. Miss Harding, a pixieish songstress who records for Mainstream Records, opened her set with \"Corner Of The Sky\" and moved into Leon Russell's \"Song For You\"— with both numbers alerting the au- dience to her inherent vocal range. No doubt, the lady has talent; but, as in the case of these two selections, her arrangements left her vulnerable. They just didn't give her voicc-and it's definitely a good one-the How deserved. Working with a two-man backup. Miss Harding apologised for the missing string section in \"We'll Cry Togelher\"-a single cut from her latest album-and it really wasn't necessary. The song was a natural, as was she in delivering it. Other high points during her set included the trilogy \"Brown Baby\" and a delightful version of the \"do?cns\"-a fun loving word game put to music. Throughout her per- formance. Miss Harding shared a good rap- port with her audience -often moving be- tween tables to chat and sing. Her arrangements, at times, needed tight- ening. Miss Harding has all the tools to \"make it \" JIM MELANSON PETER NERO Maisonette. New York Although Peter Nero has presented his pi- ano skills in a variety of settings-including working with full scale symphony orches- tras-he works the intimate St Regius Hotel room with only bass, drums and some good MOR taste in material. Nero concentrates on the music. He doesn't trick up his Cole Porter medley for instance with any flashy gimmickry, or try to swing it too much, and even his extended concerto version of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" was flamboyant but never overblown. The result is substantial fare for the easy listener, played professionally and cleanly. His repertoire flows smoothly, one to the other, and Nero works hard to make it seem effortless. IAN DOVE ROGER McGUINN Troubadour. Los Angeles If Roger McCuinn's forthcoming Colum- bia solo album catches near the energy and exciting musicianship of his in-pcrson act. all those years of effort to keep the Byrds' name alive with constantly shifting person- nel will seem an ironic exercise in futility. Roger (formerly Jim) McCiuinn isn't exactly the warmest onstage entertainer around-he might have acted more relaxed if all the ex-Birds who were supposed to join him for opening night had showed up. But his musical personality is strong enough to hold an audience by itself. The artist seems a lot freer to create without the pressure of the Byrds' label. Some of his most effective first-hearing songs had a darkly satiric quality which may point to the best direction for him to concen- trate on. There was a chilling ballad of a dis- gruntled ex- para trooper who got away with a skyjacking ransom. Then Bruce Johnston showed up for a Beach Boys' parody about (wo 747 jets \"Draggin' Cross The USA.\" Abo sitting in were Spanky (& Our Gang) McFarland and another original Byrd. Gene Clark. McGuinn's regular combo is kiuKLinding, especially flash studio drum- mer John Guerin. It's Mike Wooford on lots of keyboards and bassist David Vaught rounding out the line-up. Battcaux. reviewed in Billboard May 12. opened with a tightly-kntt set of their semi- folk acoustic work, which was exceedingly well received. NAT FREEDLAND JOE FARRELL/JOE BECK QUARTET Boomer s. New York Joe Farrell has developed a strength and versatility as a reed player thai has finally brought him to a happy, if somewhat awk- ward, transitional phase in his* career. As one of the premier session men of the day. he has finally grown to that point where his solo al- bums for CTI arc attracting a growing au- dience. At the same time. Farrell's live appear- ances arc somewhat hampered by that very popularity: in the studio. Farrell's pro- digious skills have won him the musical sup- port of some very fine players, but when he has to appear live, most of those musicians arc busy fronting their own bands. For the past few months. Farrell has been working on a solution, and his progress is laudable. His sets at Boomer's found him sharing the front line with a relatively un- known session guitarist. Joe Beck. The combination is one that is meshing nicely, for Farrell's strength lies in his re- straint, and Beck proves himself equally bal- anced. Working against (h? bass and drums of the remaining members, Farrell. who handled his lines mostly on tenor, and Beck worked mostly from a traditional frame- work, trading solos and then phrasing con- cise, swinging duels. The set began with Beck's **D "
