        "text": "1.\n\nOnce I met a cloak-and-suiter Never was a suitor cuter My wardrobe grew more ample with each sample And that’s how I got my start Then I met a famous flyer Goodness, was that guy a liar He loved me like a brother (ha) That’s another But that’s how I got my start Nobody has a string on me Let people talk as they do Nobody has a thing on me Except mink and a bracelet or two Prove it by my rich old banker How I made that banker hanker So let this be a lesson Keep ’em guessin’ ’Cause that’s how I got my start Prove it by my rich old banker How I made that banker lanker So let this be a lesson Keep ’em guessin’ ’Cause that’s how I got my start\n\n2.\n\nNecessary Evil 04:07\n\nSo you try hard to be good And do the things you should You give up everything that you enjoy But if you slip a bit And your heart says, “This is it” That’s a necessary evil, my boy All your friends say you’re a fool And you won’t break any rules With all the saintly virtues you employ But if the slightest fling Makes your soul begin to sing That’s a necessary evil, my boy Well a man sometimes has to sip of the grape Cast his eye on a lovely shape And sometime a wager desire If a man says he don’t, he’s not a man, he’s a liar So don’t let yourself be sad If what looks good is bad Reach out, accept the things that bring you joy And when you feel inclined It’ll help to keep in mind That’s a necessary evil, my boy Well a man sometimes has to sip of the grape Cast his eye on a lovely shape And sometime a wager desire If a man says he don’t, he’s not a man, he’s a liar So don’t let yourself be sad If what looks good is bad Reach out, accept the things that bring you joy A man has got to live Even steel is made to give That’s a necessary evil A necessary evil, my boy!\n\n3.\n\nA handsome hunk o’ fellow with the sharpest clothes A sunny disposition and a smile that glows That’s the kind of guy I dream of You should see the kind that I get He never runs around with any gal but me He doesn’t give a hoot about variety That’s the kind of guy I dream of You should see the kind that I get If they’re not “dese, dem, and dose”-ers They’re financially in the red They’re broad-shouldered brutes But in their bathing suits… I shoulda stood in bed A trip to Catalina on a moonlit deck He wines me and he dines me and he pays the check That’s the kind of guy I dream of You should see the kind that I get A man who comes a-courtin’ in a limousine Who doesn’t want me chipping in for gasoline That’s the kind of guy I dream of You should see the kind that I get He shows up on the minute when we have a date Of course I’m never ready but he loves to wait That’s the kind of guy I dream of You should see the kind that I get Got a guy, says he’s a jockey Took me to see his thoroughbred You guessed it, of course He looks just like his horse I shoulda stood in bed He tells me that he’s faithful, never fools around So naturally I trust him when he’s out of town That’s the kind of guy I dream of You should see the goons, the looney tunes The geeks, the freaks, the weak physiques The losers, the mooks, the flukes and the kooks You should see The guys that I get\n\n4.\n\nThe boss gets on my nerves I’ve got a good mind to quit I’ve taken all I can It’s time to get up and “git” And move to another job Or maybe another town The gentleman burns me up The gentleman gets me down The gentleman is a dope, a man of many faults A clumsy Joe who wouldn’t know a rhumba from a waltz The gentleman is a dope and not my cup of tea Why do I get in a dither? He doesn’t belong to me The gentleman isn’t bright, he doesn’t know the score A cake will come, he’ll take a crumb and never ask for more The gentleman’s eyes are blue, and little do they see Why am I beating my brains out? He doesn’t belong to me He’s somebody else’s problem, she’s welcome to the guy She’ll never understand him half as well as I The gentleman is a dope, he isn’t very smart He’s just a lug you’d like to hug and hold against your heart The gentleman doesn’t know how happy he could be Look at me crying my eyes out, as if he belonged to me He’s somebody else’s problem, she’s welcome to the guy She’ll never understand him half as well, half as well as I The gentleman is a dope, he isn’t very smart He’s just a lug you’d like to hug and hold against your heart The gentleman doesn’t know how happy he could be Look at me crying my eyes out, as if he belonged to me He’ll never, no never belong to me\n\n5.\n\nLove For Sale 04:27\n\nWhen the only sound in the empty street Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet That belong to a lonesome cop I open shop When the moon so long has been gazing down On the wayward ways of this wayward town That her smile becomes a smirk I go to work Love for sale Appetizing young love for sale Love that’s fresh and still unspoiled Love that’s only slightly soiled Love for sale Who will buy? Who would like to sample my supply? Who’s prepared to pay the price For a trip to paradise? Love for sale Let the poets pipe of love In their childish way I know every type of love Better far than they If you want the thrill of love I’ve been through the mill of love Old love, new love Every love but true love Love for sale Appetizing young love for sale If you want to buy my wares Follow me and climb the stairs Love for sale\n\n6.\n\nSkylark 02:16\n\nSkylark Have you anything to say to me? Can you tell me where my love can be? Is there a meadow in the mist Where someone’s waiting to be kissed? Oh, Skylark Have you seen a valley green with spring Where my heart can go a-journeying Over the shadows and the rain To a blossom-covered lane? And in your lonely flight Haven’t you heard the music in the night? Wonderful music Faint as a will o’ the wisp Crazy as a loon Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon Skylark I don’t know if you can find these things But my heart is riding on your wings So if you see them anywhere Won’t you lead me there?\n\n7.\n\nLong ago and far away I dreamed a dream one day And now that dream is here beside me Long the skies were overcast But now the clouds have passed You’re here at last Chills run up and down my spine Aladdin’s lamp is mine The dream I dreamed was not denied me Just one look and then I knew That all I longed for long ago was you You stepped out of a dream You were too wonderful to be what you seem Could there be eyes like yours? Could there be lips like yours? Could there be smiles like yours, honest and truly? * You stepped out of a cloud I want to take you away, away from the crowd And have you all to myself, alone and apart Out of a dream, safe in my heart (repeat from *)\n\n8.\n\nAn Occasional Man 02:49\n\nI got an island in the Pacific And everything about it is terrific I’ve got the sun to tan me, palms to fan me and… An occasional man I love my island, it’s very lazy If I should ever leave it, I’d be crazy I’ve got papayas, peaches, sandy beaches and… An occasional man When I go swimmin’ I am always dressed in style ‘Cause I go swimmin’ Wearin’ just a great big smile My little island was made for pleasure And in the cool of evening, it’s a treasure And when the hour grows later, what is greater than An occasional man? When I go swimmin’ I am always dressed in style ‘Cause I go swimmin’ Wearin’ just a great big smile My little island is such a beauty You may forget to heed the call of duty But if you give a slip to your ship Miss the trip Take a tip and play An occasional day\n\n9.\n\nOut Of This World 05:23\n\nYou’re clear out of this world When I’m looking at you I hear, out of this world The music that no mortal ever knew You’re right out of a book The fairy tale I read when I was so high No armored knight out of a book Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I * After waiting so long for the right time After reaching so long for a star All at once, in the long and lonely nighttime And despite time, here you are I’d cry out of this world If you said we were through So let me fly out of this world And spend the next eternity or two with you (repeat from *)\n\n10.\n\nHooray For Love 03:19\n\nHere’s to my best romance Here’s to my worst romance Here’s to my first romance, ages ago Here’s to the men I’ve kissed And to complete the list Here’s to the boys who said, “No” Love, love, hooray for love Who was ever too blasé for love Make this a night for love If we have to fight, let’s fight for love Some sigh and cry for love Ah, but in Paris they die for love Some waste away for love Just the same, hooray for love It gets you high, it gets you low But once you get that glow... Some beat their brains for love Other fellas miss their trains for love Screen stars emote for love Even politicians vote for love Kings lose their thrones for love Lovers disconnect their phones for love There’s more to say for love But for now, hooray, hooray for love Some trust to fate for love, Others have to take off weight for love Some go berserk for love Loafers even go to work for love Sad songs are sobbed for love People have their noses bobbed for love Some say we pay for love Just the same, hooray, hooray for love\n\n11.\n\nPersonality 03:27\n\nMary Smith had a college education Sally Jones had a scientific streak Susie Brown used to lecture on ancient architecture Josie Green spoke Latin and Greek Just forgotten girls with forgotten brains While history explains… When Madame Pompadour was on the ballroom floor Said all the gentlemen, “Obviously, The Madame has the cutest personality” And think of all the books about DuBarry’s looks What was it made her the toast of Paris? She has a well-developed personality What did Romeo see in Juliet Or Figaro in Figarette Or Jupiter in Juno? You know… And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced No doubt it must have been easy to see That she knew how to use her personality A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well And never sit on the boss’s settee Unless she’s got a perfect personality A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair Or even just a bit bowed at the knee If she can show a faultless personality Why are certain girls offered certain things Like sable coats and wedding rings By men who wear their spats right? That’s right… So don’t you say I’m smart and have the kindest heart Or what a wonderful sister I’d be Just tell me how you like my personality\n\n12.\n\nMy Foolish Heart 04:36\n\nThe night is like a lovely tune Beware, my foolish heart How white the ever constant moon Take care, my foolish heart There’s a line between love and fascination That’s hard to see on an evening such as this For they both give the very same sensation When you’re locked in the magic of a kiss * Your lips are much too close to mine Beware my foolish heart But should our eager lips combine Then let the fire start For this time it isn’t fascination Or a dream that could fade and fall apart It’s love This time it’s love, my foolish heart (repeat from *)\n\n13."
