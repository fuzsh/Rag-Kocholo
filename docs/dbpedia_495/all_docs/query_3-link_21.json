        "text": "Pat Green\n\nStarting at approximately 8:15 p.m.\n\nMarked by resilience, maturity, and the optimistic joy of a creative resurgence, Pat Green’s brand new album, Miles and Miles of You is the work of an icon reclaiming ground only he himself could have ceded. Ten fresh tracks feel like the spiritual exhale of a celebrated troubadour, taking fans on a journey to the other side of turmoil … and to a place where the old ways feel new again.\n\nCredited as one of Texas country’s modern-era founding fathers, Green has traveled many roads in the 25 years since his debut album, Dancehall Dreamer. A Grammy nominated singer-songwriter with a restless creative spirit, his career has gone beyond the bounds of a “country star” to include the work of a painter, sculptor, philanthropist, family man and more. But one constant has remained – his vision.\n\nCombining Southwestern country traditions with the rebellious spirit of rock ‘n’ roll, and adding in a poet’s literary flourish, it was Green’s vision which brought the organic, true-to-yourself Texas style to the country mainstream in the early 2000s. With watershed tracks like “Carry On,” “Three Days” and the Grammy nominated Top 5 Billboard Country Airplay hit, “Wave On Wave,” he’s gone on to sell more than two million records and notch a string of Top Ten hits on the Billboard Country Radio chart, 12 Number Ones at Texas radio, a headlining sell out of the Houston Astrodome and tours with Dave Matthews Band, Willie Nelson, Kenny Chesney and others.\n\nHis vision paved the way for a generation of fiercely-independent Texan talent, and with the new album, Miles and Miles of You, that vision is focused like never before!\n\nFor more information, visit the Pat Green website.\n\nTime Thief\n\n5 p.m.\n\nTime Thief is a Texas based Rock and Roll/ Dance party band. Time Thief reaches back in time and plays the songs you grew up with cruising in your car…..the ones that you forgot about, along with long-standing hits spanning over 40 + years. This 5 piece band has some of the best musicians that have been playing the scene in DFW for decades. They all stem from other bands from the past, to create a very talented group of musicians to give you a Rock show you won’t forget and will want to come back for more!\n\nFor more information, visit the Time Thief Facebook Page."
