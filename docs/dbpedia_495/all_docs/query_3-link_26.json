        "text": "Despite hailing from a lineage of Arizona musical nobility, Wonder Truly has carved her own path as a songwriter, showcasing a unique musical style. Her album Come Back Swinging is a journey of self-discovery, resonating with its intimate and breathtaking beauty.\n\nThe title track “Come Back Swinging” sets the tone with its restrained guitar work and Truly’s authentic vocal delivery, inviting us on an emotional journey. “Edges Soften” elevates the art of metaphor-rich lyricism, with the fingerpicking guitar work underscoring the complexities of love and fear. “Lighthouse (for Emily)” serves as a beacon of hope, resilience, and encouragement, reminding us of our capacity to be a light in the darkness for others.\n\nNearly halfway, “Nook” is a strong representation of the pandemic: its frenetic beat and simple imagery recall memories of the moment the world stopped. “Edges of the Map” feels reminiscent of better days, like innocent times before uncertainty ripped reality away from us. Like an early Joni Mitchell, “Lockpick” seems matter-of-fact. In contrast, “Here We Go” almost feels like a tame Yvette Young riff taking us through the drama of a relationship’s end.\n\nDark and reverent, “Holy” finds redemption in reclaiming the soul; achingly terrifying in its final hollow echo, we should all be disturbed by this song’s message. Heading out of the record, the bright “Poltergeist” brings back lightness with lilting vocals. We’ve lived through something. Closing with “Scrap Metal Man” suggests in a lilting waltz that Wonder Truly‘s Come Back Swinging proves that we have a fighting chance.\n\nCome Back Swinging is streaming on all platforms. –Lisa Whealy\n\n1. “Mind of You” – Ape Shifter. A chunky, punchy, riff-heavy instrumental rock tune with a wonderfully fun video.\n\n2. “Glimmerings” – GoGo Penguin. A lithe, beautiful composition that makes wholeness out of disparate rhythms, tones, and approaches. GoGo Penguin know how to make mid-tempo work sound just as fascinating and enlivening as speedy work.\n\n3. “Marché Aux Puces (Flea Market)” – Kristen Miller. A peaceful composition that evokes, through pace and evenly measured string melodies, the subtle thrills of walking a market and discovering things.\n\n4. “Katmandou” – Temple Otium. A thoughtful, expansive, patient exploration of space and time in a space influenced by Indian ragas.\n\n5. “Shipwreck” – The Great Northern. This electronic journey calls up tension and ominous vibes without being heavily dissonant. RIYL: Ulrich Schnauss, ODESZA at their lightest\n\n6. “Immortal Love” – Michael Borowski. A lovely piano rumination that transcends the usual barrier of pleasant-but-not-memorable to become truly memorable.\n\n7. “Temper the Wound” – Kalia Vandever. A wonderful collection of breathy brass tones, seeking valiantly.\n\n8. “Ta Nyé” -Ballaké Sissoko, Émile Parisien, Vincent Peirani, Vincent Segal. Delicate, elegant drones underlie lovely melodies from the kora and woodwinds.\n\n9. “Strawberries in Rain” – Euglossine. A wistful, thoughtful nylon-string guitar work that feels very much the soundtrack to walking in a field.\n\n10. “You Will Be Missed” – Julian Loida. A beautiful elegy that begins with piano, moves through gentle strings, and brings in touching melismatic vocals. The effect is deeply felt; this could be the soundtrack to the high point of a Wes Anderson movie.\n\n1. “Good Luck in Green Bay” – Maple Stave. This ripper is equal parts punk, post-hardcore, and post-rock. I love it.\n\n2. “Flower Tail” – Dabda. Jubilant, soaring math-rock with soothing vocals that only add to the joy.\n\n3. “Trucks to Gettysburg” – Equipment Pointed Ankh. A little bit jam, a lotta bit motorik, a little bit klezmer; this is a quirky, fun, interesting composition that goes places I did not expect.\n\n4. “Zoetropics” – Setting. A gently churning and subtly ominous piece that melds folk, post-rock, and neo-classical composition to excellent effect.\n\n5. “So Far So Good” – Michael Peter Olsen. Bustling, hustling cello is slowly subsumed into floating, spacy high strings and electronics for a neat composition that is fun and beautiful.\n\n6. “Inside Minds” – Resavoir. Mash up Spanish guitar, vaporwave keys sounds, jazz, and low-key groove, and you’ll get an unusually cool and intriguing track.\n\n7. “Have Mercy” – Paper Horses. I’ll listen to anything Sandra McCracken does. This outfit brings together McCracken, Leslie Jordan (All Sons and Daughters), Taylor Leonhardt, and Jess Ray, which is a pretty impressive collection of songwriting prowess. This one is a lithe, somber Southern folk jam (yes, somber AND jam), and it gets me very excited for the full record.\n\n8. “Water Street” – Matthew Halsall. A luscious, watery, flute-laden piece of relaxing spiritual jazz that immediately brightens the mood of the room.\n\n9. “Narrow Time” – Blurstem. A beautiful, delicate ambient piano composition.\n\n10. “North” – Ross Christopher. Here’s an elegant, wintry composition that is heavy on legato strings and staccato piano, producing a lovely tension.\n\nAh, it’s good to be back. In particular, I’m very pleased to be working with Tracy Shedd and Fort Lowell Records again. When James Tritten sent over this song, he thought “it might be a little too ‘up’ for your interest.” Given that this is a mid-tempo indie-pop jam with good-times ’80s vibes, I think this is a sign that I’ve become a little dour in my listening interests.\n\nNevertheless, this track did indeed catch my ear. Shedd’s lovely voice cruises over a thrumming bass line, a solid electronic percussion backline, and some swirly/mystical guitars and keys. (Let it ride, indeed.) The solid groove stays on track the whole way. The outcome of the piece is a very summery track without a lot of the usual indicators of “summer,” which is a compliment to the songwriting: evoking the feeling without hitting too many tropes is a feather in the cap. If you like Generationals, Metric at their chillest, and Rilo Kiley (shoutout; I don’t know what the statute of limitations is on RIYL references is, but we’re probably past it on this one) will love this.\n\nLet It Ride by Tracy Shedd\n\nYou can pre-save the single here. The song arrives August 18.\n\nYou can find Tracy at the digitals: Website // Bandcamp // Facebook // Instagram // Soundcloud // Twitter // YouTube\n\nFort Lowell also has ’em: Website // Bandcamp // Facebook // Instagram // Soundcloud // Twitter // YouTube\n\nSo, Independent Clauses took a roughly six-month unexpected hiatus. There were several false starts at getting things running again, but I hope and expect that this one is for real. Apologies. On to the music:\n\n1. “The Strings of Hope, the Puppets of Belief” – John Reidar Holmes. A great, misty cloud of acoustic guitar, reverb, defanged distortion, and other mystical vibes. Almost meditative in its mood, but a little more punchy than most require for that.\n\n2. “La Taill​é​e” – La Tène. This Swiss band sounds like nothing I’ve ever heard. This is some wild combination of distinctive instruments (hurdy-gurdy, harmonium, bagpipes/cabrette), the long grooves of techno, the repetition of drone, and the subtle variations of minimalism. The results are ecstatic and mysterious, energetic and enigmatic, nerve-wracking and relaxing. Highly recommended.\n\n3. “Dark Moon” – Okonski. Stately and yet exploratory, this composition falls somewhere between jazz (in its component elements) and trip-hop (in its rhythms and mood). Fans of GoGo Penguin will love this.\n\n4. “Lord Sepulchrave, the 76th Earl of Groan” – Cabbaggage. This piano piece is the opening cut of an album that takes its inspiration from the 1946 gothic fantasy novel Titus Groan. I love a good concept record, and this one opens with a delicate, intriguing rumination with plenty of atmosphere.\n\n5. “acceptances” – Lara Somogyi. An elegant and pulsing collection of delicate harp and thumping bass that makes for a lovely ambient work.\n\n6. “Aurora” – Juffbass. A soaring post-rock tune that falls somewhere between the dark-and-stormy and the twinkly-guitar versions. Reminds me a bit of Ulrich Schnauss.\n\n7. “Immaculate Inning” – Requiem. Stuttering, cool post-rock that’s heavy on bass and vibes.\n\n8. “Welcome to London” – Penguin Cafe. A whirling, punchy, thoughtful piece of jazz/contemporary classical that does the legacy of Penguin Cafe Orchestra proud.\n\n9. “December Dream” – Julian Loida. Drops into a peaceful piano-based groove, and then picks up the pace with quirky percussion and melismatic vocals. A lovely composition.\n\n10. “Sea Wall Bench” – Vein Melter. A delicate, haunting performance of an acoustic guitar with distant reverb trailing behind.\n\n11. “Brocken Spectre” – Kyle Bates and Lula Asplund. Evocative, round drones that make me smile.\n\n12. “Slow Beethoven Radio Mix 1” – The TANK Center for Sonic Arts. Beethoven, but played in a giant resonant tank at a very slow tempo. Truly: ambient classical. It’s beautiful."
