At 92.5 the River, we celebrate that diversity every day, playing music that weaves a rock-and-roll tapestry across time and genres. Our playlist includes elements of alternative, acoustic, blues, folk, reggae, and other forms of music. You’ll hear a blend of current releases from today’s artists, your favorites from the '80s and '90s, and a few deep album cuts from the '60s and '70s. You’ll also hear artists and songs that have never been played on the radio before, because we believe that discovering new music is one of life’s simple joys, and we love to share that joy with our listeners."
