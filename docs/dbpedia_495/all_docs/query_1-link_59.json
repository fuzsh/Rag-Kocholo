Estimates\n\n(1) Estimates for detailed occupations do not sum to the totals because the totals include occupations not shown separately. Estimates do not include self-employed workers.\n\n(2) Annual wages have been calculated by multiplying the hourly mean wage by a \"year-round, full-time\" hours figure of 2,080 hours; for those occupations where there is not an hourly wage published, the annual wage has been directly calculated from the reported survey data.\n\n(3) The relative standard error (RSE) is a measure of the reliability of a survey statistic. The smaller the relative standard error, the more precise the estimate.\n\n(4) Wages for some occupations that do not generally work year-round, full time, are reported either as hourly wages or annual salaries depending on how they are typically paid.\n\n(5) This wage is equal to or greater than $115.00 per hour or $239,200 per year.\n\n(8) Estimate not released.\n\nOther OEWS estimates and related information:\n\nMay 2023 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates (cross-industry estimates)\n\nMay 2023 State Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates (cross-industry estimates)\n\nMay 2023 Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Area Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates (cross-industry estimates)\n\nMay 2023 National Industry-Specific Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates\n\nMay 2023 Occupation Profiles"
