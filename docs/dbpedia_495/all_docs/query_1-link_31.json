        "text": "There’s little mystery about which two political parties dominate in California. About 47 percent of California’s 22 million voters are registered as Democrats, and 24 percent as Republicans.\n\nBut what about the state’s third-largest party?\n\nThat one’s a little more obscure. With more registered voters than the Green Party or the Libertarian Party, the American Independent Party ranks third overall with 3.8 percent, or roughly 835,000 registered voters as of February.\n\nThe news this week that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will appear on the presidential ballot in California as the party’s nominee gave the party a big boost in name recognition. His running mate will be Nicole Shanahan, a Silicon Valley lawyer and investor."
