        "text": "Since 2005 Plastic Crimewave (aka Steve Krakow) has used the Secret History of Chicago Music to shine a light on worthy artists with Chicago ties who’ve been forgotten, underrated, or never noticed in the first place.\n\nAll forms of art speak of their time, and during events of historical significance, art reliably reflects those changes, whether overtly or subtly. Often the artists themselves respond by creating new aesthetics or philosophies. Righteous Chicago soul group the Independents didn’t catalyze a musical revolution of their own, but they still prove the point: they formed in part as a consequence of key developments during the last years of the civil rights movement.\n\nThe Independents were formed by the songwriting pair of singer Chuck Jackson and pianist Marvin Yancy (covered by the Secret History of Chicago Music a couple years ago). Jackson was born March 22, 1945, in Greenville, North Carolina. His mother sang in church, and Jackson learned gospel fundamentals in school and church choirs. Yancy was born in Chicago on May 31, 1950, the son of a Baptist minister, and he began playing in his dad’s church at age 13.\n\nYancy attended the Moody Bible Institute, and Jackson studied commercial art and music at Furman University in South Carolina. After Jackson left school in 1964, he joined an R&B band, and in 1968 he moved to Chicago to work as an art director for Playboy.\n\nMusic still had a powerful hold on Jackson, though. When he heard from a friend about a songwriting workshop sponsored by soul singer Jerry “Iceman” Butler, he quit that Playboy job to join it. Butler had launched the workshop in 1970 because he’d lost the services of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff at Mercury, and he needed songs to fulfill his recording contract. The writers who networked there generated material for Butler and many other artists—including dozens of charting singles—before it dissolved in 1976.\n\nButler was impressed by a few of Jackson’s tunes. “If It’s Real What I Feel” and “Walk Easy My Son” became Butler singles in 1971, with the former also featuring Jackson’s church friend Brenda Lee Eager on vocals.\n\nThat same year, Jackson met Yancy at a Black Expo in Chicago, presented by Operation Breadbasket under the leadership of the Reverend Jesse Jackson, half brother to Chuck Jackson. Yancy was at the trade fair to play piano with gospel group the Caravans, and Jackson invited him to Butler’s workshop as a writing partner—Jackson was stronger as a lyricist, and he thought he could benefit from some help with tunes.\n\nOperation Breadbasket was launched in 1962 in Atlanta by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and its founding president, Martin Luther King Jr. “The fundamental premise of Breadbasket is a simple one,” King said in 1967. “Negroes need not patronize a business which denies them jobs, or advancement [or] plain courtesy.”\n\nIf businesses that served the Black community weren’t giving Black people good jobs, ministers would encourage their congregations to boycott or picket. Operation Breadbasket expanded to Chicago in 1966, led by Jesse Jackson, then a Chicago Theological Seminary student. He led successful campaigns targeting the dairy industry, supermarket chains, and even bottlers of Pepsi and Coca-Cola—and in the program’s first 15 months he secured an estimated 2,000 new jobs for Black people, worth about $15 million.\n\nThe two young songwriters and musicians had put the group name “Independents” on the hub label for “Just As Long As You Need Me,” so now they needed to actually assemble a band. They began to scout talent from the local scene, and in 1972 they found two new members: Maurice Jackson (no relation) had been playing and recording in the local R&B scene since the early 60s without much recognition, and Helen Curry from Clarksdale, Mississippi, had recorded a clutch of singles too, including the 1969 release “A Prayer for My Soldier” b/w “Sad and Blue” (which addressed the war in Vietnam).\n\nThe First Time We Met features top-shelf Chess Records session musicians, as well as Yancy’s piano—but Yancy, who preferred to stay behind the scenes, didn’t appear on the album’s cover with the other three members. For the Independents’ second album, Yancy worked mainly as a songwriter and producer. For live shows he was replaced by Chicago native Eric Thomas, who’d met Chuck Jackson through Operation PUSH; Thomas had been part of the group’s choir, which Yancy directed for a 1973 album.\n\nThat second album, also released by Wand, dropped in 1973 with the title Chuck, Helen, Eric, Maurice. It yielded a single hit, “It’s All Over,” which reached number 12 on the soul charts. The lush, gospel-informed weeper, fleshed out with weedy organ, percussive guitar, and epic string arrangements, might’ve been the first Independents song I heard.\n\nYancy and Jackson also wrote for artists on Curtis Mayfield’s Curtom label, including the Notations, and for stars such as Ronnie Dyson. They rapidly became heavyweights in the business, and both had solo careers as performers. In 1978, Jackson released the solo album Passionate Breezes, which included six tunes written with Yancy. In 1979, Yancy dropped a gospel single, then followed it in 1985 with the album Heavy Load. It reached number four on the gospel chart, but he didn’t get to enjoy its success—he died tragically young from a heart attack that same year. In the early 1980s, his partnership with Jackson had ended after a falling-out between them.\n\nIn 1976, Maurice Jackson formed the group Silk, whose members included Eric Thomas and fellow Operation PUSH choir alum Arthur Reid. In 1977, they released a self-titled LP on New York label Prelude, which produced the successful single “Party.” Maurice Jackson also put together a latter-day version of the Independents in the 2010s, which in 2018 reunited with Chuck Jackson and Eric Thomas for a daylong south-side concert copresented by the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.\n\nHelen Curry continued recording too, and her excellent 1979 single “Such a Thrill I Feel (When You Hold My Hand)” seems especially ripe for rediscovery by crate diggers. It’s a bona fide burner, combining disco-flavored funk with diva-style gospel vocals.\n\nMaybe if the Independents had had a longer career, they’d be internationally beloved the way they deserve. But let’s at least remember to celebrate the incredible Independents recordings we do have. And we should also bear in mind how they formed, with members connected by a righteous program by and for the Black community—something else we can never have too many of."
