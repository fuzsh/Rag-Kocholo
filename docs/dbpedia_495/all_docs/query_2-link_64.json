        "text": "Paris headquartered music company Believe has fully acquired DoÄan Music Company (DMC), which is claimed to be Turkeyâs largest independent label.\n\nBelieve struck an initial deal with DMC in 2020 to acquire a 60% majority stake in the label for â¬18.8 million (net of â¬1.6 million cash acquired). That deal included the consolidation of DoÄan MÃ¼zik YapÄ±m ve Ticaret A.Å. and Netd MÃ¼zik Video Dijital Platform ve Ticaret A.Å. within the Believe group.\n\nAccording to an update on Tuesday (August 6), Believe has now reached an agreement with DoÄan Group to exercise a call option, acquiring the remaining 40% of DMC for a total of â¬38.3 million (approx USD $41.8m at current exchange rates).\n\nBelieve said in an update to the market on Tuesday (August 6) that the transaction is still subject to approval by the competition regulator.\n\nThe deal for Istanbul’s DMC marks the latest M&A move for acquisitive Believe, which just last month acquired aÂ 25% stake in Bucharest-headquartered Global Records, which has offices in Romania, Germany and the US.\n\nGlobal is claimed to be the biggest independent music company in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nBelieveâs investment in Global and DMC follows the confirmationÂ on June 24 thatÂ a majorityÂ of Believeâs share capital is now owned by a consortium consisting ofÂ EQT X,Â TCV,Â and Believe founder and CEO,Â DenisÂ Denis Ladegaillerie.\n\nAs of July 15, the consortium held 96.02% of Believeâs share capital (see below).\n\nSpeaking exclusively withÂ Music Business Worldwide in June, Believe founder and CEO,Â Denis Ladegaillerie saidÂ that Believe is planning to spendÂ EUR â¬200 to â¬300 millionÂ per year on acquisitions to grow its global business.\n\nSpeaking with MBW, Ladegaillerie, said: “We are aligned withÂ EQTÂ andÂ TCV to supercharge our existing organic growth. We will continue to invest in our organic growth strategy and make acquisitions to grow market share.”\n\nHe added: “The No.1 element of our acquisition strategy today is in the Top 10 markets. We want to become a No.1 player in those markets. We are already the largest player [on local repertoire] in France; the third largest player inÂ Germany; the largest player inÂ India; the third largest player inÂ Japan. We want to do more. TheÂ US, UK,Â andÂ JapanÂ are all key priorities for us.\n\n“At the same time, we will continue making very qualitative, targeted acquisitions across [smaller] markets as youâve seen recently in Turkey, the Philippines, and elsewhere.”\n\nBelieve published its financial results for the first half of 2024 (the six months ending June 30) on Thursday (August 1).\n\nThe company, which trades on the Paris Euronext, generated revenues ofÂ EURÂ â¬474.1 million (approx. USD $510m)Â in H1 across its entire business.\n\nMusic Business Worldwide"
