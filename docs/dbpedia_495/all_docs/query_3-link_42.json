        "text": "Three Westmoreland County bands have earned nominations for the 2024 Josie Awards, which recognizes independent musicians.\n\nGreensburg’s Derek Woods Band was nominated for “Social Impact Music Video of the Year,” for their song “Thank You For Being Here.”\n\nThe song celebrates unity and diversity, and explores the importance of embracing change in order to grow emotionally, with lyrics such as, “We are different, we must listen/to each other’s piece of mind.”\n\n“It’s a reminder that each and every one of us is necessary in order to make the world a better place,” said Woods, who will join his band in attending the Josie Awards, held annually at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville.\n\nIt’s not the first time one of the band’s videos has earned a chance at acclaim.\n\nThe video for “Don’t Look Away,” from its 2022 album, “Picture Yourself,” won LIT Talent Awards for best music video and best art music video. The centerpiece of the video was a “Muppet”-style puppet of namesake Derek Woods, which was created by California company Jonny Does Puppets.\n\nIn addition to the Derek Woods Band, country rocker Andy Davis was also nominated for four Josie Awards: Artist of the Year (JMA Alum Modern Country), Fan’s Choice (Male), Vocalist of the Year (Modern Country) and Music Video of the Year (Performance Focused/Male JMA Alum). Davis also is a Mt. Pleasant borough councilman.\n\nAlle-Kiski hard rock band Sourmash is also nominated for Group of the Year (Rock/Metal JMA Alum)."
