        "text": "The National Independent Venue Foundation (NIVF) is committed to equity in its support for independent venues, and seeks to create and encourage opportunities for venues, promoters, and festivals owned, operated, and staffed by people of color, women, non-binary, LGBTQ+, veterans, and people with disabilities. NIVF is committed to creating and upholding a safe space for its participants where respectful conversations around inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA) can continue to happen. NIVF makes an ongoing commitment to prioritize IDEA initiatives and learn more about best practices and approaches to IDEA in the live performance industry, and to provide resources and professional development opportunities to support NIVFâ€™s participants in doing the same for their individual organizations.\n\nThese entertainment hubs are critical to their local economies and tax bases as employers, tourism destinations, and revenue generators for neighboring businesses such as restaurants, hotels, and retail. Independent venues exist in every state across the country. During the pandemic, they were the first to be closed, then they were the last to open. The economic recovery process for this community is extending well past just reopening, requiring solutions unique to the industry."
