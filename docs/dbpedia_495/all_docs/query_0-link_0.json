        "text": "American R&B vocal group\n\nFor other uses, see The Independents.\n\nThe Independents were an American R&B vocal group active from 1971 to 1975.[1] They scored several hits on the U.S. Pop and R&B charts. Their 1973 song \"Leaving Me\" reached No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100,[1] and remained on the chart for 14 weeks. Sales of over a million copies led to a gold record being awarded by the R.I.A.A. on May 23, 1973.[2]\n\nAfter the group broke up and recording the solo albums, Passionate Breezes and Gonna Getcha Love, Chuck Jackson, along with fellow group member Marvin Yancy, achieved success as the producers and writers for most of Natalie Cole's early chart releases,[1] and also had success with Phyllis Hyman and Ronnie Dyson. Jackson is the half-brother of the Reverend Jesse Jackson and is not related to singer Chuck Jackson.[1] In 2019, original member Maurice Jackson (no relation) reformed The Independents with Theo Huff, Rashan Thompson, Vanessa Lainey, Parkas Alexander and himself.\n\nMembers\n\n[edit]\n\nCharles \"Chuck\" Jackson - born 22 March 1945, Greenville, South Carolina[2]\n\nMaurice Jackson - born 12 June 1942, Chicago[2]\n\nHelen Curry - born Clarksdale, Mississippi[2]\n\nEric Thomas - born Chicago[2]\n\nMarvin Jerome Yancy - born 31 May 1950, Chicago - March 22, 1985[2]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Peak chart positions Record label US\n\n[3] US\n\nR&B\n\n[3] 1972 The First Time We Met 127 18 Wand 1973 Chuck, Helen, Eric, Maurice — — \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released.\n\nCompilation albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Peak Record label US\n\nR&B\n\n[3] 1974 Discs of Gold 42 Wand 1991 Leaving Me: Their Golden Classics — Collectables 2016 Just As Long: The Complete Wand Recordings 1972-74 — Kent Soul \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released.\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Single Peak chart positions US\n\n[3] US\n\nR&B\n\n[3] 1972 \"Just as Long as You Need Me (Part 1)\" 84 8 \"I Just Want to Be There\" 113 38 1973 \"Leaving Me\" 21 1 \"Baby I've Been Missing You\" 41 4 \"It's All Over\" 65 12 1974 \"The First Time We Met\" 103 20 \"Arise and Shine (Let's Get It On)\" — 19 \"Let This Be a Lesson to You\" 88 7 \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
