This includes fostering awareness of the interconnected issues, systemic challenges, and opportunities facing the independent film and media arts field and the broader cultural sector.\n\nElevating strategies, best practices, and exemplary models for building accessible and equitable career pathways into the film and media arts industry, and providing relevant expertise to local and regional cultural organizations and service providers.\n\nPromoting the contributions of the independent film and media arts field to the wider arts sector and beyond, including aspects such as strengthening communities through the power of storytelling.\n\nWith Sundance Institute as the inaugural partner from 2019-2022, the initiative established the Independent Media Arts Group (IMAG), a nationwide network of more than 800 individuals representing local, regional, and national stakeholders across the United States, including artists and collectives, film and media arts organizations, film festivals, art house cinemas, cultural institutions, content distributors, broadcast entities, arts service organizations, and funders. IMAG activities include quarterly field meetings open to the public, which serve to provide a continuous forum for ideas exchange; peer learning; and technical assistance led by practitioners within and outside the IMAG network. Registration is free to join the IMAG network and gain access to the IMAG listserv.
