        "text": "Popular Monster [Candyland Color Vinyl] (LP)\n\nFalling in Reverse\n\nFilled with fierce, infectious post-hardcore tracks, Popular Monster is a fitting title for the latest from Falling In Reverse. Blending rap, metal, emo, and hard rock, these tracks are on fire with raw, rough emotion. They're also total anthems: turn them up loud and headbang your way through your worst (as well as your best) days. Popular Monster is a powerful, intense, world-shaking album.\n\nWanderers Like Me (CD)\n\nThe Po' Ramblin' Boys\n\nSweet harmonies and even sweeter strings take center stage on The Po' Ramblin' Boys' Wanderers Like Me . Hailing from the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, the album is packed to the gills with good old-fashioned bluegrass that feels dynamic, urgent, and alive. These timeless tracks will keep your foot tappin' as the band segues from rollicking, road-worn tunes to wistful, melancholic numbers. The songs on Wanderers Like Me have deep, satisfying roots in the country and bluegrass genres while simultaneously feeling fresh, immediate, and entertaining.\n\nThis Is How Tomorrow Moves [Sky Blue Vinyl] (LP)\n\nbeabadoobee\n\nThis is How Tomorrow Moves is the charming new album from cult fave British indie artist beabadoobee. Singer-songwriter Beatrice Laus writes pumped-up, pastel lo-fi indie pop with some serious hooks. Lead single \"Take a Bite\" has enough rock 'n' roll edge and swooning pop bliss to call to mind the '90s glory days of iconic female alt-rock artists while sounding like a breath of fresh air. As beabadoobee, Laus sings of self-acceptance and growing into your self, with an impassioned, vital sound that moves effortlessly from introspective ballads to driving, punk-inflected rockers.\n\nYou'll Have To Lose Something (CD)\n\nSpirit Of The Beehive\n\nYou'll Have to Lose Something is the experimental, exquisite new album from Spirit of the Beehive. Over the course of its runtime, the album twists and turns, morphing and reshaping itself in surprising ways. There are moments of heartbreaking beauty, moments of unsettling weirdness. This is indie rock through the looking glass, the soundtrack to a dream in the instant where it shifts from the expected into the deeply strange. Voyage with Spirit of the Beehive through this wild, wonderful territory and you'll be richly rewarded.\n\nBREAD (CD)\n\nSofi Tukker\n\nKnowing that the title of Sofi Tukker's new album BREAD is an acronym for Be Really Energetic And Dance explains so much about this joyful, slightly off-kilter collection. The album, like its title, is a little goofy, a lot of relentlessly good times. The songs are hands-in-the-air bangers with glimpses of the group's sense of humor and joie de vivre â€” basically it's pretty much what the best night of your life sounds like, if the best night of your life happened in Ibiza. Turn this one up loud, get weird, and live it up.\n\nWake Up The Wicked (CD)\n\nPowerwolf\n\nFantasy meets ferocity on the latest from Powerwolf. Wake Up the Wicked is every bit as epic as you'd expect from its title, with thundering riffs, soaring choruses, and intense theatricality. Of course it's heavy, of course it's catchy...of course it's the ideal soundtrack for embarking on a medieval quest into a realm of dragons, hellfire, and badass sword-slingin' babes of all gender expressions. Wake Up the Wicked is loud enough and powerful enough to do just that, and you'll have a hell of a good time while you're listening.\n\nThe Bed I Made (LP)\n\nThe Softies\n\nYes, you heard right. There's a new album from beloved indie pop minimalists The Softies. The Bed I Made is lilting and tender, a softly beautiful and introspective exploration of grief and rebirth. The songs are quietly powerful, a testament to love, hope, and growth through challenges. The Bed I Made is an album to treasure, one you'll want to listen to closely, again and again. This album will remind you that nobody does it quite like The Softies.\n\nL.A. Times [Green Marble Vinyl] (LP)\n\nTravis\n\nL.A. Times is the eclectic, excellent new album from Scottish indie rockers Travis. \"Gaslight\" is catchy as hell while \"Bus\" is romantic and wistful. \"Raze the Bar\" is a '90s style alt-rock anthem while \"The River\" is a Gaelic folk-inflected rocker. Each song feels like its own world, sometimes its own genre, yet as part of the album, they all build off one another and create their own cohesive, compelling listening experience. The record touches on frontman Fran Healy's experiences living in Los Angeles, a city as diverse and dynamic as these tracks, filled with all the high-highs and low-lows reflected in these songs. Travis continues to evolve and L.A. Times is some of their best, most intimate work in years.\n\nBuzz (LP)\n\nNIKI\n\nPop music gets a much-needed injection of authenticity and enchantment with NIKI's Buzz . Having gained an audience as a Jakarta teenager releasing acoustic covers on YouTube, NIKI's third album shines an even brighter spotlight on her singular and captivating voice as an alt-pop singer-songwriter. She's vulnerable, introspective, and writes some killer songs that'll get under your skin. The melodies are informed by hip-hop, mid-century pop, lo-fi indie, and folk â€” NIKI weaves all those seemingly disparate elements together with aplomb. Buzz is fresh and fascinating, an album to treasure.\n\nGreif (CD)\n\nZeal & Ardor\n\nZeal & Ardor find the beauty in the darkness on Greif . Moments of introspection and resilience contrast with, and complement, the periods of rage and regret. With brooding vocals and heavy-as-hell guitars, elements of silence and stillness just hit harder. Greif will keep listeners on the edge of their seats, with punishing metal punctuated by handclaps, anthemic choruses, moody verses, and instrumentation that ranges from menacing to plaintive.\n\nBilly Strings Live Vol. 1 (LP)\n\nBilly Strings\n\nOn Live Vol 1 , young bluegrass star Billy Strings already sounds like a legend. A compilation of live performances at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, Austin's Moody Center, Paris' La Cigale, and other locales, the album is a dizzying record of his electrifying concert appearances. The mood transforms from song to song, with outlaw tales, melancholy ballads, and rollicking stompers. This is bluegrass on fire, with fiery guitar, strings that sound like Orpheus himself got out his fiddle, and captivating storytelling. Impressive and unforgettable.\n\nLong Way Home ['Eruption' Color Vinyl] (LP)\n\nRay LaMontagne\n\nLong Way Home is the cinematic new album from Ray Lamontagne. Whether he's singing languorous, lush folk numbers like the title track or tapping into '60s style soul on \"Step Into Your Power,\" these are the type of songs that'll instantly set a mood. Long Way Home is pure listening pleasure, an eclectic and sublime collection of tracks about the road from youth to maturity and all the trials and rewards along the way. The album features The Secret Sisters on backing vocals along with the multi-talented Carl Broemel of My Morning Jacket."
