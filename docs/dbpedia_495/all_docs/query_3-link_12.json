        "text": "Since the last time I interviewed Set It Off in 2019, a lot has changed, and I’m not just referring to most of our hair colors. With their most recent single ‘Fake Ass Friends’ the band is embarking on a new era on their journey as an independent band which brings on plenty of new possibilities.\n\nWhile tons of fans were lining up outside the venue for their show with I Prevail and Kid Bookie, I sat down with Cody, Maxx and Zach and let’s say, things escalated towards the second half of the interview when the conversation shifted to the lack of ‘cold things’ when touring Europe amongst other things. Clearly, I wouldn’t have it any other way. By request of the band, this interview is dedicated to the one and only Rob Zombie."
