        "text": "Navarro Panther Band Boosters is a growing organization of parents and other volunteers who help support the needs of the Navarro Panther Band Program. From 6th to 12th grade, we support over 300 kids who participate in various band programs including Beginner Band, Junior High Band, High School Marching and Concert Bands and our Jazz Band.\n\nWe raise funds to help support all Navarro Band Programs, buy needed instruments and equipment, and fund other projects to lessen the burden of individual students and parents and the school district overall. We also provide numerous volunteer hours to help organize, chaperone and otherwise support the band directors who educate our kids in the study of music.\n\nWe are proud of the many accomplishments of the collective Navarro Panther Bands that have received top awards in practically all areas of competition from Junior High to High School.\n\nWe hope that the support of parents within the Band Boosters is a part of the Bandâ€™s success.\n\nWe need all Band Parents to help support the Band Boosters efforts to make sure that students have what they need, when they need it. The more volunteers we have, the less the burden is for all.\n\nSo please consider joining, supporting and volunteering in the Navarro Panther Band Boosters by signing up TODAY by downloading, completing and returning the attached form. If you will be in direct contact with the students, you will also need to complete and return the attached background check form."
