        "text": "Written By: CalypsoRoom Editorial Team - January 2024\n\nTable of content\n\nThe rise of independent music artists (updated 2024) - Introduction\n\nIn the past, to succeed in the music industry, you needed to be under the wing of a big record label with the resources to promote your music.\n\nArtists struggled to get noticed by big names in the industry so they were not able to have their shots.\n\nJ.Cole once said he waited outside Jay Zâs studio in 2007 for almost 2 hours just to give him is mix tape.\n\nAnd when he finally saw Jay Z and handed him the mix tape, Jay Z looked at him and said âMan, I donât want that.â\n\nThat was the typical story of almost every big artist that became famous over 2 decades ago. They had to get through the âO.Gsâ in the game to make it to the top.\n\nBut the game has changed now!\n\nIndependent artists are the ones carrying the industry. And they donât seem to be relenting.\n\nOver 9.5 million tracks were released by independent music artists around the world in 2020, 8 times more than the 1.1 million tracks released by major labels.\n\nDespite a decline in sales in the early pandemic months, the recorded music sector recovered in the remaining months of the year, marking the sixth year in a straight of gain.\n\nIn record label trade revenue figures, worldwide recorded music sales increased 9% in 2022 to $26.2 billion. And most of that revenue was generated by independent sound recording owners.\n\nLetâs take a closer look at how independent music artists are influencing the industry and the amount of growth they have contributed in recent years.\n\nIndependent music artists are driving the expansion of streaming\n\nRevenue from streaming services totaled $25.1 billion, in 2021 and, as a result, streaming revenue growth continued to accelerate in 2022.\n\nHowever, Spotify's revenue growth decreased in 2022, indicating that the company is now meaningfully underperforming in the market as a result of the emergence of local players in emerging markets and the rapid growth of YouTube music.\n\nThe major labels underperformed in the streaming market for the first time, albeit not all majors were equally impacted.\n\nWarner Music Group (WMG) and Universal Music Group (UMG) both performed significantly worse than Sony Music Entertainment (SME), which was totally in line with the rise of the streaming business.\n\nBut how have they influenced a shift in the market share for record labels?\n\nShift in market share\n\nThe majors and Merlin's proportion of Spotify streams decreased significantly in the last years as a consequence of the independent artists rise.\n\nIn fact, 87% of Spotify's total streams in 2017 were from the big labels and Merlin; however, that percentage dropped to 85% in 2018, 82% in 2019, 78% in 2020, 77% in 2021, and 75% in 2022.\n\nNot only is there a new growth pattern in the recorded music industry emerging, but there is also a new breed of independent copyright owners emerging.\n\nThe headline states that independents' (copyright owners) market share increased from 29.7% to 31.1% in 2020. The percentage in 2018 was 28.3%. Gained market share is over three full points.\n\nIn a rapidly expanding sector like streaming, large revenue growth is required to fuel such significant movements in market share.\n\nAccording to Spotify data, majors increased by 14%, Merlin decreased by 3%, artists direct increased by 28%, and non-Merlin independents increased by 49%.\n\nAs a result, the biggest winners in the last years were artists direct and non-Merlin independents.\n\nCompared to larger, more established organizations, these two divisions have learned how to exploit their smaller scale to be agile and play to the specific rhythms of streaming.\n\nThey are the new vanguard of music strategy for the streaming era.\n\nNow all the stats and figures aside, how did we get here? What changed? How are Independent sound recording owners now topping the game the âO.Gs?â\n\nYou guessed right â streaming!\n\nHow streaming has given independent music artists more opportunities\n\nThe opportunity for artists and labels of all sizes to access international audiences is the undeniable advantage of the streaming era.\n\nHowever, the majority of small record labels lack the size and resources necessary to directly license and distribute to streaming services, therefore they instead turn to the rapidly growing market for digital distributors.\n\nThe major record companies have made a name for themselves in this market as essential players, distributing independent labels directly or through their distribution networks.\n\nThe value that they give to independents is evident, but the revenue passes via the majorsâ accounts, and thus major label revenues are inflated by independent revenue, thereby inflating the market share of the majors.\n\nâWith the help of the data we collected for our independent label survey, we were able to separate the majors' total revenue from this \"embedded\" distributed independent label revenue in order to determine the \"actual\" market share of independent labels, which is based on who owns the copyright rather than just who distributes itâ.\n\nHere you can find the full report from Media that explains how independent labels and artists are bigger than what we might think.\n\nHow streaming has changed the entire music industry\n\nA decade or two ago, fans of music had three options: buy physical records, purchase tracks and albums on an online store like iTunes, or downloading them illegally for free compromising the security of their computers as well.\n\nAll of that has altered since then.\n\nMusic streaming, which has also fundamentally altered how customers listen to and purchase music, has shaken up the music industry.\n\nCustomers may now access music at a much lower cost than was previously possible thanks to music streaming services, which offer millions of recordings from tens of thousands of artists for a monthly subscription fee.\n\nFor instance, the two most well-known music streaming services, Apple Music and Spotify Premium, each have monthly fees of around $11, as opposed to $1 for each song on iTunes.\n\nSimilar to how Netflix and Hulu impacted how people watch television and movies, music streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music have transformed how people listen to music.\n\nThe rise of independent music artists - Conclusion\n\nMusic streaming services are used and favoured all over the world. So, as long as streaming platforms keep growing in popularity, we can expect independent artists to keep churning off the larger market share in the music industry.\n\nPlease take the time to browse our blog area for many more resources, information, and recommendations on the music industry as a whole.\n\nDo you know anything about CalypsoRoom?\n\nWe at CalypsoRoom think that music has the greatest ability to unite people, thus we created an online music social network where you can chat with friends or complete strangers while listening to music via a webcam.\n\nCreate your free account and let us know if you want to participate in CalypsoRoom with your music if you are a musician.\n\nIt's completely free, you retain full ownership of your copyright, and you will get a new source of income from the use of your music on the platform.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nCalypsoRoom Team\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nWhat is the article \"The rise of independent music artists\" about?\n\nThe article discusses the rising popularity of independent musicians in the music business as well as the factors that contribute to their success.\n\nWho are independent music artists?\n\nIndependent musicians are those that produce and release their own music on their own terms, without the assistance of a large record label or entertainment business.\n\nWhy are independent music artists on the rise?\n\nIndependent music artists are becoming more popular for a number of reasons, including the simplicity of using platforms for music distribution, the rising popularity of self-promotion on social media, and shifting perceptions of the traditional music industry.\n\nHow do independent music artists distribute their music?\n\nIndependent musicians have access to a variety of online distribution channels, including Bandcamp, SoundCloud, and Spotify, as well as tangible formats like CDs and vinyl records.\n\nWhat are some challenges faced by independent music artists?\n\nIndependent musicians must manage all part of music creation and promotion themselves and are constrained by a lack of funding, visibility, and exposure.\n\nCan independent music artists achieve success without the support of a record label?\n\nYes, independent musicians can be successful without a record label's help.
