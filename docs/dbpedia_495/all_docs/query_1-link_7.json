        "text": "L.A. Times [Green Marble Vinyl] (LP)\n\nTravis\n\nL.A. Times is the eclectic, excellent new album from Scottish indie rockers Travis. \"Gaslight\" is catchy as hell while \"Bus\" is romantic and wistful. \"Raze the Bar\" is a '90s style alt-rock anthem while \"The River\" is a Gaelic folk-inflected rocker. Each song feels like its own world, sometimes its own genre, yet as part of the album, they all build off one another and create their own cohesive, compelling listening experience. The record touches on frontman Fran Healy's experiences living in Los Angeles, a city as diverse and dynamic as these tracks, filled with all the high-highs and low-lows reflected in these songs. Travis continues to evolve and L.A. Times is some of their best, most intimate work in years.\n\nBilly Strings Live Vol. 1 (LP)\n\nBilly Strings\n\nOn Live Vol 1 , young bluegrass star Billy Strings already sounds like a legend. A compilation of live performances at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, Austin's Moody Center, Paris' La Cigale, and other locales, the album is a dizzying record of his electrifying concert appearances. The mood transforms from song to song, with outlaw tales, melancholy ballads, and rollicking stompers. This is bluegrass on fire, with fiery guitar, strings that sound like Orpheus himself got out his fiddle, and captivating storytelling. Impressive and unforgettable.\n\nFine Art [Color Vinyl] (LP)\n\nKneecap\n\nNorthern Ireland's Kneecap are the kind of once-in-a-generation group that'll make you reimagine the possibilities for rap. On Fine Art , the trio cannonballs off the diving board of grime and 2-step, creating unpredictable, relentless tracks that juggle unhinged irreverence and laser-focused insights. The group members' flows accent each other nicely, the beats shift from simmering Beastie Boys'-esque minimalism to hands-in-the-air dance to moody, bass-heavy garage. Fine Art is a woozy and wonderful thrill ride. You've got to hear this one.\n\nWhere I've Been, Isn't Where I'm Going (CD)\n\nShaboozey\n\nHot off his appearance on Beyonce's Cowboy Carter comes Shaboozey with his top-notch new album, Where I've Been, Isn't Where I'm Goin g. Shaboozey fuses classic country sounds with indie Americana, adds in a dash of hip-hop, and occasionally even some pop. In Shaboozey's hands, this modern melange feels natural, affecting, and utterly satisfying. This is an album with a capital \"A,\" the type of front-to-back listening experience that creates a mood and tells a story that'll stick with you. \"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\" is a down-and-out anthem that's irresistible and infectious. \"Anabelle\" will break your heart and \"My Fault\" (featuring Noah Cyrus) will break it into even smaller pieces. You've got to hear this album: you'll be glad you did.\n\nMoonDial (LP)\n\nPat Metheny\n\nPat Metheny's new album MoonDial is atmospheric, mellow, and magical. The compositions are nuanced and moving, the type of tracks that enhance your surroundings and instantly lift your mood. On MoonDial , the legendary Metheny experiments with tuning, finding delightful, evocative harmonies and creating mood music that sets the tone but doesn't disappear into the background. An enchanting, gently beautiful album that you'll want to hear again and again.\n\nWake Up The Wicked (CD)\n\nPowerwolf\n\nFantasy meets ferocity on the latest from Powerwolf. Wake Up the Wicked is every bit as epic as you'd expect from its title, with thundering riffs, soaring choruses, and intense theatricality. Of course it's heavy, of course it's catchy...of course it's the ideal soundtrack for embarking on a medieval quest into a realm of dragons, hellfire, and badass sword-slingin' babes of all gender expressions. Wake Up the Wicked is loud enough and powerful enough to do just that, and you'll have a hell of a good time while you're listening.\n\nRed Moon Rising (CD)\n\nRobert Jon & The Wreck\n\nSouthern-fried rock meets blistering blues rock on Robert Jon & The Wreck's latest. Red Moon Rising is packed with evocative storytelling, red hot riffs, and grooved out basslines. The band incorporates funk flourishes, sing-a-long-ready choruses, and imaginative, urgent lyrics into truly electrifying tracks that'll scratch your blues rock itch. Red Moon Rising is the sort of mood-setting album that'll transport you to a sweatier, sultrier, more down-and-dirty rock 'n' roll world.\n\nX's [Crystal Clear Vinyl] (LP)\n\nCigarettes After Sex\n\nOn X's , the tenderly seductive milieu of Cigarettes After Sex moves from dream pop to emotional nightmare. Written as a way of coping with the collapse of a four-year long relationship, the album moves from love-drunk early days to relentless, creeping loss. Cigarettes After Sex has always trafficked in the slow burn; these songs take that simmering tension to a new height. Inspired by melancholic slow dances of the '70s and '80s, X's is moody and quietly devastating.\n\nBox Of Letters (CD)\n\nSparkle*Jets U.K.\n\nSparkle Jets UK are back with their first full-length record of originals since 2002. Box of Letters is addictive, timeless power pop. Featuring dual singers Susan West and Michael Simmons, the band builds a high-octane, ridiculously hooky, and ultra cool vibe that doesn't quit. The mood moves from sharp-witted and punky to wistful and romantic, all with driving riffs and catchy as hell choruses. Box of Letters is pure rock 'n' roll excitement in the way only Sparkle Jets UK can bring it.\n\nbuzz (LP)\n\nNIKI\n\nPop music gets a much-needed injection of authenticity and enchantment with NIKI's Buzz . Having gained an audience as a Jakarta teenager releasing acoustic covers on YouTube, NIKI's third album shines an even brighter spotlight on her singular and captivating voice as an alt-pop singer-songwriter. She's vulnerable, introspective, and writes some killer songs that'll get under your skin. The melodies are informed by hip-hop, mid-century pop, lo-fi indie, and folk — NIKI weaves all those seemingly disparate elements together with aplomb. Buzz is fresh and fascinating, an album to treasure.\n\nThis Is How Tomorrow Moves [Sky Blue Vinyl] (LP)\n\nbeabadoobee\n\nThis is How Tomorrow Moves is the charming new album from cult fave British indie artist beabadoobee. Singer-songwriter Beatrice Laus writes pumped-up, pastel lo-fi indie pop with some serious hooks. Lead single \"Take a Bite\" has enough rock 'n' roll edge and swooning pop bliss to call to mind the '90s glory days of iconic female alt-rock artists while sounding like a breath of fresh air. As beabadoobee, Laus sings of self-acceptance and growing into your self, with an impassioned, vital sound that moves effortlessly from introspective ballads to driving, punk-inflected rockers.\n\nCharm [Purple Vinyl] (LP)\n\nClairo\n\nCharm is an appropriate title for Clairo's easy-to-love latest. These atmospheric indie pop gems are warm, inviting, and intriguing. Clairo brings a pastel-hued '70s sound to the proceedings, fusing languid lounge music, groovy soul, lush jazz, and summery folk. Listeners will want to immerse themselves in the dreamy, hazy worlds Clairo creates via Charm . Clairo long ago transcended her early career internet buzz and with Charm , she moves in inspired new directions."
