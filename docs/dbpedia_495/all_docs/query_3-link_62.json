        "text": "What others are saying of our Band Director, Ms. Saad\n\n“Ms. Saad has a very admirable work ethic. She goes above and beyond, but to her, it's doing the bare minimum.”\n\n-Mr. Dylan Cardenas, UTEP Student Teacher\n\n“When I look back to my first year of band, I think of how I knew nothing. As long as I’ve been in band, I’ve grown and learned a new form of expressing myself, and a new form of love. I as well as many others in the band have grown together and it’s all because of how amazing Ms. Saad has been and how she’s led us to work together and be at our best.”\n\n-Jacqueline Levario, Sophomore, Percussionist\n\n“I came expecting nothing out of me in band, I was not a devoted student. After the course of a few years, I got to know Ms saad, and I found a goal, I found motivation. She always tried her best to guide me towards it, and as of right now, I've improved by a lot thanks to her.”\n\n-Miguel Kroll, Junior, Clarinetist\n\n“Ms. Saad has been my band director since 7th grade. Five years later, she's helped me grow into who I am today, both musically and as a person. The door to her office is always open if we need to talk to her, and she never fails to help and support us. I've grown as a musician with her help, and all the success we've had this year is proof of her amazing musicianship and leadership. She's a high school band director, middle school band director, even a guard coach, and everything in between. She does everything, and it's all so inspiring.”\n\n-Johanna Romero, Senior, Drum Major"
