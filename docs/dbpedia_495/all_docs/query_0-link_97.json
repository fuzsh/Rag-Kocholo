After countless revivals without the composer’s involvement, Bernstein decided to revisit the work in 1988 to produce his ultimate version based on a revival by the Scottish Opera.\n\nThe Overture features a dazzling display of musical sparks and fanfare.\n\nFlorence Price’s Symphony No. 1\n\nPrice‘s iconic work was the first symphony by a Black woman to be performed by a major American orchestra. Completed in 1932, her piece was premiered by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Frederick Stock in June 1933.\n\nThe symphony reflects Price’s experience as a woman of color in the post-Civil War South, and incorporates elements of African-American spirituals, church hymns, and American folk music.\n\nAaron Copland’s El Salón México\n\nCopland‘s symphonic El Salón México was written during 1932 and completed in 1933. The work was inspired by the composer’s first trip to Mexico, and its melodies drew on those found on sheet music Copland purchased during the trip.\n\nWhile visting Mexico, Copland’s friend Carlos Chávez took him to a nightclub called “El Salón México.” The outing inspired Copland to incorporate elements of dance hall and the country’s complexities into his new piece.\n\nJeffrey Tyzik’s Fantasy on American Themes\n\nGRAMMY Award winner Jeff Tyzik is one of America’s most innovative and sought-after pops conductors. This Independence Day, you’ll hear the Oregon Symphony Pops conductor’s Fantasy on American Themes.\n\nFeaturing cascading strings and rhythmic brass and woodwinds, the piece incorporates music from classics such as Yankee Doodle, America the Beautiful, and When Johnny Comes Marching Home.\n\nJohn Philip Sousa’s The Stars and Stripes Forever\n\nIt would not be the Fourth of July without Sousa‘s patriotic march! Written in 1896, The Stars and Stripes Forever was named the official National March of the United States of America by Congress in 1987.\n\nSousa wrote the memorable march on Christmas Day while vacationing in Europe with his wife, when he became homesick for the USA.\n\nHow To Listen\n\nJoin us at 89.9 FM in Portland or listen online from anywhere via the live player on our website."
