We offer programs and services aimed at fostering the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual independence of our servicemembers, combat Veterans, their Caregivers, families, and Allies who served in combat alongside them. Our initiatives encompass innovative mobility and adaptive technologies, suicide prevention, Caregiver and family support, and advocacy for Veterans with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, government agencies, legislators, and allied partners at federal and state levels.\n\nThe Independence Fund's hallmark Mobility program provides Veterans with equipment, like all-terrain trackchairs, as well as opportunities to take back their physical independence.\n\nSupporting a Veteranâ€™s entire family is the best path towards full independence. Our Family program provides opportunities to engage in specialized activities alongside their peers."
