        "text": "Tyrique Wilson | JD Candidate, 2019\n\n\"WashULaw is a place marked by a collegial culture, engaged faculty, and progressive ideas. The lofty themes and representations pitched to me as an applicant have all proved true. Both the law school and university at-large offer its students global opportunities while providing mid-western comfort. I will cherish my time here forever.\"\n\nSarah J. Tietz\n\nJD Candidate 2019\n\n\"The professors Iâ€™ve had at WashULaw are not only experts in their field, but are also so invested in my success inside and outside the classroom. They are always willing to meet with me and help me better understand the class material, prep me for interviews, and discuss my career path.\"\n\nErnest Zhu | JD Candidate 2020\n\n\"As an international student and a member of the LGBTQ community, I have never felt that I'm treated differently by any faculty members or classmates. No place is free of bias but WashULaw is a place where students don't have to worry about potential problems caused by their identities. The administration is also very receptive to suggestions and as a member of Student Bar Association, I have personally witnessed changes made based on student input.The 1L classes prepared me well for the judicial internship this summer. Be open-minded to all perspectives and you'll thrive here.\""
