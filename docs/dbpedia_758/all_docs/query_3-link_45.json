        "text": "Western’s Political Science faculty are committed to the belief that understanding politics and government is essential to a well-educated person, vital to democratic citizenship, indispensable to effective public service, and critical to the maintenance and ethical progress of a free society. The Political Science department specializes in four sub-fields: American Politics and Public Policy, Political Theory, International Relations, and Comparative Politics. Faculty have research interests that range from foreign policy and international political systems, to race and public policy elections and representation, environmental politics, and more.\n\nPolitics, Philosophy, and Economics are combined in a multidisciplinary effort to study modern political science, questions of political philosophy, pursue social scientific research, and apply economic analysis in problem solving. The multidisciplinary trio provides a foundation in philosophy, logic, critical thinking, and political processes within the U.S. and in the international system, and the functioning of the economy with attention to economic analysis tools. Students are given preparation in the foundational materials of each of these fields, and encouraged to explore classes at the intersection of political and economic issues. Because it draws on three different research disciplines, this combined major strives to provide students with an interdisciplinary set of skills related to critical reasoning and analysis, problem solving and decision making, and social scientific research. The PPE combined major is not a triple major; rather, it strives to provide a broad exposure to these three fields.\n\nThe study of Economics provides insights into decision-making, market outcomes and the functioning of the overall economy. Political Science is concerned with the structure and function of both domestic and international political systems, and engaging questions associated with American politics, international politics, public policy and political theory.\n\nThe combined Economics / Political Science major provides students with rigorous preparation in both economic theory and applications, and political processes at the national and international levels. By combining coursework in Economics and Political Science, students gain an interdisciplinary perspective important to understanding both political and economic issues. Students are trained in research methods used in Economics and Political Science, giving them interdisciplinary tools for problem solving and policy making. Students in this program will gain insight into a variety of areas including trade, monetary systems, development, and the interplay between politics and economics within the U.S. and the international system.\n\nSecondary Education students who wish to be endorsed in social studies may choose this major. However, this degree does not require that a student pursue a teaching certificate. See the Secondary Education section of the catalog for program admission, completion, and teacher certification requirements.\n\nWestern’s Department of Political Science is part of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.\n\nInternships\n\nSome students work with the department or Career Services Center to find internships. Examples of recent student internships include the WA State House of Representatives and the Whatcom County Office of Public Defenders.\n\nThe Political Science Department hosts the Ralph Munro Seminar for Civic Education and sponsors the Political Science Association student conference and Sandison Lecture. The department also coordinates the WA Legislative Internship program and offers administrative internship opportunities with a variety of agencies and organizations. Recent student internships include Global Visionaries — Grant Writing Department, and the Washington State Senate.\n\nClubs\n\nPolitical Science students are active in two student clubs: the Political Science Association (PSA) and the International Affairs Association (IAA). Students in the IAA regularly participate in regional and national Model UN Conferences; over the years, the Western team has garnered numerous accolades for their participation in these events.\n\nStudents in the Economics/Political Science major have opportunities to get involved with both economics and politics outside of the classroom. The WWU Student Economics Association (SEA) is a student-led club that promotes the development of skills to lead members’ transition into the job sector. The club coordinates events to help guide and inspire innovative thinking for economics students and business students alike.\n\nThe Political Economy Club is a community of students interested in the subject of political economy. The goal is to create a space for education and discussion and to enhance the interdisciplinary experience of students interested in the subject. This student group may be of particular interest to students in the Economics/Political Science and Politics/Philosophy/Economics majors.\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nStudents are also encouraged to Study Abroad through faculty led study abroad, direct exchange programs, or other international exchange programs."
