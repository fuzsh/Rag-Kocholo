Drop deadline: Monday, Aug. 22, 2016. As described below, students will be required to draft a significant number of written assignments in a very short time frame during this advanced legal writing course. As a result, a strong foundation in written English is highly recommended for students taking this course. The purpose of this course is to provide students with exposure to and practice in various types of legal writing and legal drafting they will likely encounter in practice. Students will work with a wide a variety of legal documents in the practice areas of real estate law, estate planning and drafting, litigation, and business law. Class time will be spent developing skills pertinent to each area of writing and/or drafting being addressed and to participating in workshop activities that will prepare students for their writing assignments. Emphasis will be put on working with students through class time, individual conferences as requested, and feedback, all aimed at enabling students to further develop their skills in legal writing. Grades for this course will be based on weekly writing assignments. There will not be a final exam. Assignments in Litigation Section of Course: Based on a hypothetical fact pattern and relevant case law (you will not do any independent research), you will be required to prepare three written assignments (each one due one week apart): (1) letter to client; (2) memorandum of law in support of preliminary injunction; and (3) memorandum of law in opposition to motion to dismiss tortious interference claim. Assignments in Real Estate Section of Course: Evolving from commercial and residential sales contracts and leases discussed in class, assignments will include internal law firm memoranda and correspondence to opposing attorneys regarding negotiated issues. Assignment in Business Law Section of Course: Weekly contract drafting assignments are based on facts obtained by students during in-class interviews of the client (the professor), and after a presentation of background on the anticipated substantive issues involved with the contracts to be drafted. Examples of past assignments include: nondisclosure (confidentiality) agreements, letters of intent for acquisition of a business, term sheets for commercial loans, and key provisions in agreements for the manufacture of snack foods.

This course offers an introduction to comparative law, and consists of three parts. The first part surveys the most striking differences in property law, tort law, family law, corporate law, criminal law and litigation law, discusses the historical and economic literature that tries to explain these differences, and explores more general themes such as the effects of regulatory competition (race to the bottom or to the top?), the importance and effectiveness of legal transplants, and the relationship between the quality of law and economic growth. The second part offers an overview of the history and typical features of the principal legal families (with particular emphasis on the civil law tradition). The third part focuses on contract law in particular, and compares American, English, French, and German law. Classroom instruction is by lecture and discussion. Laptops are not allowed in class.

This course is based on the assumption that national legal systems may be organized into certain \"legal families\". Among them, the civil law and the common law systems (families) are the closest ones to our tradition. The general question here is to what extent the globalization resulted in a certain convergence of the traditional systems and what is the role of international and supranational legal systems in imposing such convergence. The first part offers a general discussion on the method of comparative law and on the principal characteristics of the civil law system, the common law system and some other types of legal systems. Furthermore, some problems of techniques of comparative law and comparisons of judicial styles will be considered. The second part of the course will be devoted to analyzing a few selected examples comparing how similar institutions and procedures are elaborated in different legal systems. We will focus on comparative problems of the judicial review (diffused v. concentrated systems) and of the modern constitutions (including the review of constitutionality of constitutional amendments). Furthermore, we will compare the concept of contract and tort in the law of obligations. Finally, one class will be devoted to discussion on the criminal procedure (including the problem of the \"fruits of the poisonous tree\" concept). Classroom instruction will combine lecture, students in-class presentations and discussion. Lap-tops and similar devices are allowed in class.

Katz)\n\nAn introduction to the comparative study of different legal systems. This course will focus primarily on the question of how law and order are maintained, and justice pursued, under two major \"legal families,\" the civil law and the common law systems. Our overarching aim in this course will be to explore the extent to which differences in legal doctrine and practice reflect larger differences in social structure. The first part of the course introduces us to comparative law as a method, to the principal characteristics of the civil law and common law systems, and to basic structures elaborated under these systems and their functioning, among them courts and judicial review. Next we will explore how similar institutions and procedures are elaborated in different legal systems, among them civil and criminal procedure; contracts and torts; and property. We then turn to modern constitutions, and a brief selection of issues they contend with, including structural design (the presidentialism vs. parliamentarism debate); human dignity; freedom of speech; and the family. Finally, we consider the extent to which we may be witnessing a convergence of traditional systems under globalization (considering specifically the role of international and supranational legal systems) and the backlash thereto. Our goal is for students to come away with some knowledge of foreign law and with a heightened awareness of some of the ways in which foreign societies can differ from our own.

Each week, we will cover a different element of the constitution, including: the nature of a constitution, the preconditions for constitutionalism, forms of government, the foundations of judicial power, the role and design of courts, constitutional \"borrowing\" across regimes, and the evolution of constitutionalism on a global scale. We will discuss judicial methods of interpretation, including proportionality and rights balancing. We will also explore comparative rights jurisprudence in areas including freedom of expression, equality and non-discrimination, religion, privacy and the family. Finally, we will discuss doctrines of constitutional maintenance and survival, including militant democracy and the \"basic structure doctrine,\" and will consider why some constitutions endure while others fail. Ultimately, the aim of the course is to not only to expose students to different approaches to constitutionalism the world over, but also to help them better understand their own constitutional system. Grades will be based on attendance, class participation, and a final exam. 3 credits\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nW74 LAW 536 Conflict of Laws (Appleton)\n\nConflict of Laws considers the following three questions: What law applies to cases connected to more than one state or country (choice of law)? What courts have the authority to decide such cases (jurisdiction)? What is the effect elsewhere of a court's decision in such cases (recognition of judgments)? The cases examined span a range of subject matters, including torts, contracts, and property, just to name a few examples. Today, family law cases provide especially fertile ground for analysis in Conflict of Laws, given different states' and countries' varying positions and policies on topics such as same-sex marriage, adoption, abortion, and surrogacy arrangements. Other timely contexts include mass tort cases and controversies in \"Cyberspace.\" Although the course emphasizes conflicts among the American states, selected international problems are included. The course covers material that is both theoretical and practical. In terms of theory, the course explores questions of power, authority, and the nature of law, in light of the courts' evolving understanding of such concepts. In terms of practice, the course confronts a reality of the modern world: the vast majority of legal problems today are not confined to a single state or even a single country. Because class discussion is a vital part of the course, regular class attendance and preparation are required, and students may not use laptops. Grades will be based on a closed-book final exam and additional points for class participation. 3 units.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nW74 LAW 536B Conflict of Laws\n\nThis course examines legal problems that arise from occurrences transcending state or national boundaries: choice of applicable law, constitutional limitations thereon, jurisdiction of courts, and recognition of foreign judgments.

Conflict of Laws provides an excellent review of a number of substantive courses as well as Civil Procedure because the cases examined in Conflict of Laws cover a variety of different topics including, for example, Torts, Contracts, Property, Insurance, and Family Law. Several contemporary controversies raise issues explored in this course: the effect elsewhere of same-sex marriages validly celebrated in Massachusetts or countries such as Canada, similar issues regarding civil unions and domestic partnerships, the applicability of abortion restrictions across state lines, mass tort actions, and the laws governing \"Cyberspace\" - to name just a few examples.

This course constitutes an interdisciplinary approach to acquisitive business transactions. Emphasis will be placed on the role of the business attorney as a facilitator, who enhances the value of the transaction for the business client. The Course emphasizes the multiple skills and disciplines utilized by the attorney engaged in an acquisition transaction.

The Course begins with an analysis of the motivations of the buyer and seller, with a brief explanation of the principles used in determining the value of the target business. The Course continues with an analysis of the various transaction structures used in business acquisitions, together with an in depth analysis of the negotiating process and particular legal issues involved in the acquisitive transaction. Finally, the Course analyzes the respective roles of the board of directors, shareholders and the courts with respect to the sale and purchase of a corporation whose stock is publicly traded.

Under what circumstances are police permitted to stop you on the street, fish in your pockets, or open your wallet and remove its contents? What legal rules govern jailhouse interrogations? At what point in a criminal investigation does the right to confer with counsel attach? In surveying the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and their interpretation in Supreme Court jurisprudence, we will consider answers to each of these questions. Upon completion of the course, students will understand how the Constitution and related case law govern the opening stages of the criminal process. 3 units.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nW74 LAW 544E Biosciences, Causation, and Tort Law (Green)\n\nThis course builds on tort law and involves its application in a specialized area that focuses on the harm suffered. Rather than traumatic injuries, toxic torts are about diseases suffered as a result of the wrongful conduct of another. Of course, automobiles, baseball bats, and widgets don't cause disease. Instead, diseases (for our purposes) are caused by drugs, chemicals, minerals (asbestos is, after all, a type of mineral), radiation, cigarette smoke, and similar substances. Those substances, the diseases they cause, and the lawsuits they spawn frame this course. Among the many special problems that exist in this area of tort law is causation, and that will be the focus of the course: addressing the theory of factual causation and then understanding the different types of scientific evidence brought to bear on the issue of causation, which include primarily epidemiology, as well as toxicology, and genetics. Caution: This course has a heavy science component and a little bit of standard statistical methods of the sort taught in an undergraduate liberal arts course. If you came to law school to avoid any further contact with science or basic math, this course is not for you. Final grade will be determined based on the final examination, group project and presentation, and class participation. 2 Credits\n\nCredit 2 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nW74 LAW 547K Evidence\n\nWe will study the principles and rules that regulate the presentation of evidence at trial using the Federal Rules of Evidence, involving both lecture and problem solving. Topics covered include relevancy and its limits, various policy and efficiency-based limitations on the receipt of evidence, the rule against hearsay and the more important hearsay exceptions, rules governing the impeachment of witnesses, privilege and expert testimony. Class participation and consistent attendance are required. While not taught as a traditional law school class in that the class does not emphasize case analysis, participation includes both answering questions provided in lecture notes and group (law firm) exercises, which require out of class work. The group (law firm) exercises include a Practice Problem in most lectures which will require a few of the law firms to take assigned roles (Plaintiff, Defendant and Judge) to make an objection to evidence and present testimony and legal arguments about an issue raised from the class materials. There will be a mid-term practice exam made up of 20 multiple-choice questions from a prior final exam which will not count as part of a student's grade and instead is a self-evaluation of a student's understanding of the material studied up to that time. There will be an unscheduled, modified open book final exam which includes both an essay question with multiple prompts and 40 multiple choice questions. ABA Standard 310 requires \"not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and two hours of out-of-class student work per week or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time\" for each credit hour awarded.

The early part of the course will take up classic views of law and society, including the views of Montesquieu, Maine, Durkheim, and Weber, along with the views of a few contemporary theorists, to explore how theorists and social scientists have characterized the relationship between law and society. The remainder of the course will explore a range of issues that bear on the law-society relationship, including the nature or function of law, sources of law, social influences on law, customary law, law and colonization, the transplantation of law, legal pluralism, law and development, legal change, the legal profession, globalization, and more. The objective of the course is to develop a sophisticated theoretical and empirical understanding of the complex and multifarious connections between law and society. The course material is a compilation of excerpts from articles and books. The exam is a take home essay exam that poses a series of questions about the law-society relationship. Students will be graded on their demonstrated mastery of the material and on the depth and thoughtfulness of their responses to the questions.\n\nCredit 2 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nW74 LAW 553B International Law\n\nThis course introduces students to both the substance and process of international law. It is an essential prerequisite to upper-level courses in international law and legal process and is required for members of Washington University's Jessup International Moot Court team. It provides a foundation for the student wishing to specialize in international or transnational law and serves as a wonderful introduction to international legal reasoning and materials for the non-specialist. The course serves as an introduction to the basic principles of public international law including treaty law, customary international law and U.S. foreign relations law, as well as the resolution of international disputes through international courts and tribunals including international arbitration and litigation. It covers the legal frameworks applicable to international issues, as well as taking up the question of international institutional design. It is also a fun, interesting, and very relevant course, covering international law issues that arise during the course of the semester, including inter-state disputes about the participation of particular Olympic athletes, the onset of war, or exploding space objects. Many years students participate in a simulation during the semester in which they will represent a UN member state and debate an international legal problem in the UN General Assembly. The final will be a three hour in-class open book exam. From time to time, but not more than twice in a semester, pass/fail, short, reaction papers will be assigned in relation either to films or presentations by guest speakers.

The course begins with an introduction to the sources of international law (treaties and customary international law). It then critically examines a variety of international legal frameworks for creating and enforcing international law, and for resolving disputes under international law. The course will also explore application of international law norms to certain substantive law areas, such as international human rights, environmental law, the laws of war, and international criminal law. Note that this course is a survey of public international law principles, and does NOT address in depth issues pertaining to the foreign relations law of the United States (including the role of international law in the U.S. legal system).

In this course, we will explore the law's role in creating, exacerbating, alleviating, and remedying exclusionary and discriminatory tactics through the regulation of land. We will examine ways in which land use laws have helped create structural inequalities based on race and ethnicity. The course is centered on i) exploring ways land use laws have been used to segregate and discriminate and ii) analyzing facially-neutral land use laws that have a disproportionate impact based on race and ethnicity. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to: 1) Explain how the American common, statutory, and constitutional law governing land is affected by, and in turn affects, structural racism; 2) Identify the social impacts associated with objective or facially-neutral legal land use doctrines; 3) Describe structural racism as embedded in land use laws; and 4) Critically analyze laws and determine whether they are addressing structural racism, exacerbating it, or something else.

It is considered a survey ethics course. Students can take only one survey ethics course. Other recently offered survey courses offered include: Lawyer Ethics and Legal Profession. This 2 unit course will provide students with the practical skills necessary to identify ethics issues, both routine and complex, and help them identify the resources available to properly resolve those issues. In addition, the course will focus on professionalism in the practice of law and its importance in improving the public perception of lawyers. Students will benefit from an understanding of the importance of ethics and professionalism to their individual legal careers. While they may ultimately practice law in any number of different work settings and specialize in various substantive practice areas, ethics and professionalism will be a daily part of their practices. The course will therefore begin with an analysis of the legal profession and the interplay between (i) defining minimum standards below which behavior may not fall, (ii) establishing standards of ideal behavior toward which attorneys should aim but cannot realistically expect to reach, and (iii) giving \"practical advice\" that conforms to the lawyer's ethical responsibility. This analysis will also examine the lawyer's dual and somewhat contradictory role in society (i.e., citizens want lawyers to be understanding and socially responsible, but the same people freely admit that, when they have a problem, they want a lawyer who will play \"hardball\"). The course will examine, inter alia, specific ethical and professional issues relating to the attorney-client relationship, the duty of loyalty to the client, ethical issues in litigation, conflicts of interest, and advertising and the marketing of legal services. Hypotheticals and problems based on real situations will be used.

How one responds to these crises determines whether or not a lawyer may be sued for malpractice, disciplined professionally, or possibly violate the lawyer's sense of what is \"right\" or \"wrong.\" We will explore the nature and types of client-attorney relationships, confidentiality rules, client-attorney privilege, conflicts of interest, ethical issues in representing entity clients such as corporations and partnerships, fees, professional self-regulation, access to legal services, public interest representation, and the role of lawyers for the government. We will study the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and ethical duties under common law and other sources of authority. Most of the classes will focus on the skill of problem solving as you learn to recognize and resolve ethical dilemmas you will face in practice. Other skills you will use and develop include: legal analysis and reasoning, legal research, communication skills, and client counseling. This course also will focus on the professional values of providing competent legal representation, improving the legal profession, and examining the legal profession's role in promoting justice, fairness, and morality.

Transnational disputes involve foreign citizens, activities, or harms. Proficiency in transnational legal dispute resolution is essential for lawyers engaged in international practice areas such as international business or human rights. It's equally valuable for lawyers without an international focus, as transnational legal challenges often surface across various domains of domestic law. These include family law, environmental law, product liability, intellectual property, civil rights, criminal law, corporate law, and many others.

Note: Students who took any of the following courses prior to Spring 2014 are not eligible to take this course: Mediation Theory & Practice, Negotiation Theory & Practice, or Business Negotiation Theory & Practice. Students who took Negotiation during the January Intersession or at any other time are not eligible to take this course. This course is currently a pre-requisite for: Arbitration Theory and Practice; Business Negotiation Theory and Practice; Negotiation Theory and Practice; Mediation Theory and Practice; Multi-Party/Public Policy Dispute Resolution Theory and Practice; Family Mediation Theory and Practice; and Employment/Civil Rights Mediation Theory and Practice] This one unit pass/fail course will be offered in an intensive weekend format on Sat, XXXXX (9:30a-5:30p), and Sun, XXXXX (12:00p-5:00p). The course will emphasize learning the skills of negotiation through simulations in which students will negotiate and observe their classmates negotiate. Class members will conduct three negotiations during the weekend - a simple sales contract, a retainer agreement between an attorney and a client, and a complex multi-party dispute. The first negotiation will commence immediately at the start of class, so prompt attendance is vital to credit in the course. Some negotiations will be videotaped for review in class. The reading for the course consists of Roger Fisher and William Ury, Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In (Harvard/Belknap Paperback). Other readings on lying in negotiation (approximately 30 pages) will be made available approximately two weeks before the class occurs. In addition to the simulations and discussion of the readings, there will be brief instruction on drafting agreements and advice about further steps to improve negotiation skills. Students who attend all class sessions, participate in good faith in the simulations, and do the readings will receive credit for the course (passing grade posted on transcript will be 'CR'). Attendance will be taken each day. This class starts promptly at the time indicated (not at 8 minutes after the hour.) Any enrolled student who arrives late to the class (barring a true emergency) risks earning a failing grade of F-2.50, which counts toward his/her GPA - barring a true emergency.\n\nCredit 1 unit.\n\nView Sections\n\nW74 LAW 578L Business Negotiation Theory and Practice\n\nEnrollment limit: 24. Prerequisite: Negotiation. Students are not eligible to take both this course and any other section of Business Negotiation Theory & Practice. The difference between a good attorney and a great one is often a matter of negotiation skills. Whether working in a law office practice, a public institution, or a business enterprise, an attorney's job inevitably involves negotiation. Many of the negotiation skills learned in this class are also applicable to individuals working in non-traditional legal positions (for example, business executives, leaders of non-profit organizations or politicians), as these and other careers frequently require reaching agreements with other parties. Negotiation skills are needed in any situation where the terms of an agreement or contract must be determined (mergers, joint ventures, litigation settlements, partnership agreements, and so forth), and also in the day-to-day work of dealing with clients, partners, employees, judges, legislators, and colleagues. Because negotiation is so integral to what lawyers do, negotiation skills play critical role in determining how successful lawyers are in their work. The premise of this course is that, while attorneys need analytical skills to discover solutions to negotiation problems, bargaining skills are needed for solutions to be accepted by others and implemented. The purpose of this course is to help you become a more skillful negotiator. The course is relevant to a broad range of business and negotiation problems faced by lawyers. A solid grounding in negotiation theory is necessary for the development of negotiation skills. Toward this end, students will study a variety of situations where negotiating skills are important and will develop a set of bargaining tools that will enable them to convert conceptual knowledge into effective action. These tools consist of preparation and at-the-table guidelines that, when practiced regularly, develop into fluid negotiation skills. Because practice is essential for negotiation skills to develop, practice opportunities are offered continually throughout the course. Indeed, at least one practice opportunity will be provided in almost every class, in the form of a negotiation or dispute resolution case that simulates a real world situation. Laptops are not allowed to be used during class. This course includes a lab/case fee. There are no exams in this course. Rather, you will be graded on the basis of written assignments (including a paper due the last week of class), class participation, performance in negotiations and group projects (if assigned). 3 units.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nW74 LAW 578M Comparative Business Negotiation\n\nPrerequisite: None.

M. students the opportunity to negotiate and learn from students from around the world. The course focuses on understanding negotiation theories and developing negotiation skills necessary to be successful as negotiators and advocates in a variety of domestic and international business settings, including deal making, and internal corporate and employment dispute resolution. Students will study a variety of business situations where negotiating theory and skills are important and will develop a set of bargaining tools that will enable them to convert conceptual knowledge into effective action. These tools consist of preparation and at-the-table guidelines that, when practiced regularly, develop into fluid and intentional negotiation skills, informed by cutting-edge negotiation theories. Because practice is essential for business negotiation skills to develop, practice opportunities are offered continually throughout the course. At least one practice opportunity will be provided in almost every class, in the form of a negotiation or dispute resolution case that simulates a real-world business situation.

The sources of fiduciary law such as the ERISA statute, regulations, and Department of Labor guidance will be explained. Emphasis will be placed on the proper identification of fiduciaries, the fiduciary duties of prudence and loyalty, prohibited transactions and major exemptions, personal liability under the law, and the recent regulations regarding disclosure of fees and expenses. Special focus will be given to recent Supreme Court and Circuit Court cases that have significantly changed the ERISA fiduciary landscape. Finally, a brief overview will be provided of typical ERISA litigation that a student is likely to see in their future practices. The course will be relevant for any student interested in employee benefits, employment law, labor law, business law, or securities law as they will leave the course with the proper understanding of how to advise clients in avoiding the major compliance pitfalls of being an ERISA fiduciary.

The structure, scope, and objectives of labor law regulation of employee benefit plans, both pension and welfare, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) will be studied in depth. The tax treatment of contributions to, earnings of, and distributions from qualified (i.e., tax-subsidized) and non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements will be compared. The rules governing the terms and operation of qualified deferred compensation plans, such as 401(k) plans, will be examined, including workforce coverage, allocation of contributions and benefits, funding, fiduciary responsibility, vesting, and the timing, forms, and taxation of distributions. In addition to fiduciary oversight, ERISA's disclosure regime and civil enforcement mechanism will be introduced. Students will work extensively with ERISA, related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and corresponding regulations. Federal Income Taxation is not a prerequisite for this course; students who have not taken Federal Income Taxation would not face a disadvantage. Attendance and preparation are required and sanctions will be imposed in cases of serious noncompliance.

In real-world settings, however, lawyers frequently find themselves spending more time working with statutes than with case law. In order to equip students to survive in our so-called \"age of statutes,\" this course attempts to shed light on legislation and the processes that give rise to it. The first half of the course will examine legal rules that govern the legislature, including such topics as lobbying regulation, bribery statutes, ethics rules, open meetings laws, the line-item veto, the filibuster, and judicial review of legislative decision making procedure. The second half of the semester will be a more straightforward doctrinal unit, examining the ways in which legislation is implemented in the courts. The primary focus will be on principles of statutory construction. Students will acquire a working knowledge of the uses and abuses of canons of construction, legislative history materials, and other tools that lawyers and judges employ as they try to make sense of legislation. Regular attendance and preparation will be expected, and sanctions may be imposed on egregious offenders. The course grade will be based on a timed exam. 3 units.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nW74 LAW 601A Legislation\n\nPrerequisite: Constitutional Law. Most law school courses focus on judge-made law, but many important practice areas - from bankruptcy and tax to environmental law and civil rights - are dominated by statutes. This three-unit course examines how legislatures create statutory law and how judges interpret statutes. The first part of the course focuses on the legislative process. How do members of Congress draft, debate, and enact legislation? How do voters and interest groups influence the content of federal laws? What rules constrain federal and state legislative processes? The course then explores different theories of what statutes are and how they fit into the fabric of the law. The final part of the course examines how courts can and should interpret statutes. What are the theoretical bases for statutory interpretation? What sources of authority should determine the meaning of statutes? Only the text? Legislative history materials? Related statutes or administrative provisions?
