The article was then reviewed, fact-checked, and edited by multiple members of our editorial team prior to publishing.\n\nAre you considering a career in law and wondering what it takes to get there? Though challenging and demanding, the journey to becoming a lawyer can also be incredibly rewarding.\n\nThis article covers the requirements for a career in law, discussing everything from the degrees you'll need, the skills you'll learn, and the steps to becoming a lawyer.\n\nWhether you're exploring your career options, considering law school, or are considering changing careers, this guide will attempt to help you understand what it takes to embark on a legal career.\n\nWhat Degree Do You Need to Become a Lawyer?\n\nAfter obtaining a bachelor's degree, you must get a juris doctor (JD) degree from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). This degree, which involves three years of full-time study, is the foundational law degree required to practice law in most jurisdictions.\n\nRelated Criminal Justice & Legal Programs You May Be Interested In\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below.\n\n7 Steps to Become a Lawyer\n\nBecoming a lawyer in the United States requires several steps. Let's break down each step in detail:\n\nStep 1: Earn a Bachelor's Degree\n\nYou must first earn a bachelor's degree. While the subject of your undergraduate degree does not need to be related to law, it might help to choose a field that develops skills useful for law school, such as writing and critical thinking. During your final year of college or after graduating, you can begin preparing for the LSAT so that you can apply to law schools.\n\nStep 2: Take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and Apply to Law School\n\nThe LSAT is the generally accepted standardized test required for admission to law schools. It assesses your logical reasoning and reading skills. Your LSAT score is an important part of your law school application, and you should prepare for the test well in advance. The average LSAT score is about 160, but most top-ranked law schools require a score of at least 170.\n\nSome law schools accept the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) or the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) as an alternative to the LSAT. Be sure to check with the specific law school you are interested in to understand their requirements.\n\nStep 3: Apply to Law School\n\nAfter you receive a satisfactory LSAT score, it's time for you to apply for law school. Most law schools require a personal statement and letters of recommendation as part of your application.\n\nMost law schools have rolling admissions, meaning they review applications as they come in. However, it may be beneficial to apply early to maximize your chances of getting in and receiving financial aid.\n\nStep 4: Earn Your JD\n\nLaw school requires rigorous academic study combined with practical skills, covering subjects such as constitutional law, contracts, torts, property law, criminal law, and civil procedure.\n\nA law degree teaches you many useful skills, such as:\n\nCommunication skills to help you articulate complex ideas clearly and persuasively.\n\nCritical thinking skills to help you analyze facts and arguments.\n\nResearch skills to help you conduct thorough and efficient legal research.\n\nProblem-solving skills to help you identify issues and craft logical solutions.\n\nAdvocacy skills to help you represent clients or causes effectively.\n\nStep 5: Pass the Bar Exam\n\nAfter finishing law school, you need to pass the state bar exam to practice law. The exam is a comprehensive test of your legal knowledge; passing the bar is required in most jurisdictions.\n\nThis rigorous test covers a broad range of topics, including constitutional law, criminal law and procedure, civil procedure, contracts, torts, real and personal property, and evidence. Some states also test state-specific laws.\n\nThe bar is usually split into multiple parts, including a multistate bar exam (MBE), state-specific essays, and a performance test designed to assess practical skills.\n\nStep 6: Obtain a License to Practice\n\nAfter passing the bar, you can start the process of obtaining a license to practice law, also known as admission to the bar. This process involves submitting an application that includes your official transcripts, exam scores, and a background check. Upon approval, you'll receive your license and be able to practice law.\n\nRequirements can vary by state, so always check the specifics in your area.\n\nStep 7: Consider Specialization or Further Education\n\nAfter obtaining a law degree and license, you might consider further education or specialization in law. This can range from earning a master's degree in law (LL.M) to gaining certification in a specific area of law. Here are some areas you could specialize in:\n\nTax Law: This focuses on the complexities of tax codes and regulations.\n\nInternational Law: This explores laws governing relationships between countries.\n\nIntellectual Property Law: This covers laws related to patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.\n\nHuman Rights Law: This focuses on laws protecting individual rights and freedoms at a global level.\n\nEnvironmental Law: This covers laws related to environmental protection and sustainability.\n\nCorporate Law: This explores laws governing businesses and corporations.\n\nSpecializing or furthering your education can provide a competitive advantage, open doors to advanced educational opportunities, increase your salary potential, and lead to a more fulfilling career.\n\nWhich Law Schools Accept the GRE or GMAT?\n\nThe GRE or GMAT is accepted in a number of law schools. Remember to check the specifics of your prospective law school's website for specifics and any conditions that may apply. Policies can also change over time, so check for the most updated information. Here is a sample list:\n\nSchools Accepting GRE or GMAT (2024) Law School Accepts GRE Accepts GMAT Harvard Law School Columbia Law School University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law Georgetown University Law Center Northwestern Pritzker School of Law UCLA School of Law The University of Texas at Austin University of Chicago Law School (if you want to pursue a dual degree in law) University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School Yale Law School Cornell Law School George Washington University Law School University of Virginia School of Law Boston University School of Law\n\nApprenticeships or Law Office Study Programs\n\nIn California, Virginia, Vermont, and Washington, you can take the bar exam without going to law school. Instead, you can study under a practicing attorney or judge called an apprenticeship or law office study.\n\nHere's how it works: You work in a law office under the direct guidance of a licensed attorney. You study legal documents and learn the daily tasks of a lawyer. This direct experience could give you an advantage when you begin practicing law. The disadvantage? It requires a significant amount of effort with no promise of achieving success.\n\nFor folks who can't afford law school or don't want to take on student loans, it's an attractive option. However, the pass rate for the bar exam is also lower for law office study than for law school graduates.\n\nBe aware that completing an apprenticeship may not carry the same weight or recognition as a law degree in the professional world, and it may limit opportunities for jobs, particularly with large law firms or for competitive positions. Always thoroughly research and consider your options before choosing this path.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Requirements for Law School"
