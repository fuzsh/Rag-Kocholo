        "text": "“Through experience, I have learned that the Jesuits are really really great at education and especially education of the whole self, critical thinking. Not just mind, but body and spirit.”\n\n“Seattle University encourages each student to locate and empower their personal voice. Through experimentation of thought, expression of ideas, and personal reflection, this powerful process can be used by everyone to better those around them and change communities locally and internationally. I encourage everyone to find their courage and seek others in an open minded and curious spirit to inspire change!”\n\n“It’s refreshing to feel that my classmates are helpful and encouraging instead of feeling like they are out to get me! It makes me think like there is a kind of ‘no scientist left behind’ culture here. Seattle U's dedication to bringing humanity into science is truly commendable and sets it apart from other colleges. I look forward to the remaining years of my academic journey in this nurturing and inclusive community.”\n\n“I had never thought about being a researcher, but I immediately said yes [when asked to join a research project]. From this experience, I honored people’s stories, listened to what changes they wanted to see, and then was able to tell those stories in a research paper distributed to food banks across the nation to help make that change. All research should reposition power from the interviewer to the interviewee.”\n\n“Choosing Seattle U has been one of the best decisions I've made. The challenging coursework, dedicated faculty, and supportive community have empowered me to grow both personally and professionally. The computer science program provides ample opportunities for internships, networking, and career development, making it an ideal choice for aspiring computer scientists.”"
