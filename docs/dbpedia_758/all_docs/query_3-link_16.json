        "text": "Shaping Tomorrow's Legal Leaders\n\nWashington, D.C., is the ideal setting for the study of law. As a student at The Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law (Catholic Law), you are within easy reach of the enormously beneficial study, externship, and networking opportunities that come with earning a J.D. in the nation’s capital. Catholic Law's offers both a full and part-time J.D. program in a supportive and connected environment. The Law School also offers three areas of focus for a LL.M. degree, as well as an American LL.M. for international students. Catholic Law's M.L.S. degree features five concentrations for working professionals who want to learn more about the law, but do not wish to seek a J.D. degree. Each of these academic programs are managed by the Office of Academic Affairs at Catholic Law.\n\nAn Inspiring Legal Environment\n\nAs a child, Jim Moye ’99 spent countless nights watching his mother’s beloved legal drama Perry Mason on television. The eponymous criminal defense lawyer fascinated young Moye. “He was always the smartest guy in the room,” he reminisced. Needless to say, Moye charted his own path, bypassing a decades-long career in criminal law to specialize in the intersection of both domestic and international law in business. He does still share at least one personality trait with litigation-loving Perry Mason though: He loves a challenge."
