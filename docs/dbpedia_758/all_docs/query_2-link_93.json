        "text": "Washington University in St. Louis (often referred to as WashU) is a mouthful to say, but the name of this private research university founded in 1853 comes out of the mouths of more top students every year when naming their top-choice institution. Yet, this wasn’t always the case. Back in the 1970s, the school, then called Washington University, voted to stick “St. Louis” at the end of their name, simply because they were tired of explaining that they were not located in either Seattle or the nation’s capital. While the number of applications has risen in recent years (particularly those applying ED), acceptance rates have been low for a very long time. A decade ago, 22% of applicants were accepted; last year, the Washu acceptance rate was half that figure.\n\nGiven the highly selective nature of WUSTL, applicants need to be well informed and understand the true level of competition at this university. Toward that aim, this article will give you:\n\nWashU acceptance rate\n\nWashU ED acceptance rate\n\nGPA, SAT, ACT, and class rank of accepted WashU applicants\n\nAdmissions trends from the Class of 2027\n\nThe demographics of current WashU undergraduates\n\nWashU’s yield rate\n\nHow WashU’s admissions officers evaluate candidates\n\nTips for applying to WashU\n\nEssay Prompts and Advice\n\nHow to assess whether applying to WashU is even worth the $75 application fee (for you)\n\nLet’s begin with an examination of the most recent admissions data.\n\nWashU Acceptance Rate\n\nOut of the 32,240 applicants for a place in the Class of 2027, 3,855 were accepted. This means that the overall WashU acceptance rate is 12%.\n\nHowever, it’s important to break this number down by cycle: regular decision vs. early decision. In the regular decision cycle, WashU received 27,723 applications and accepted 2,697 of them for a regular decision acceptance rate of just 9%.\n\nHistorical overall Washington University in St. Louis acceptance rates are as follows:\n\nApplicants Admits Acceptance Rate Class of 2026 33,214 3,764 11% Class of 2025 33,634 4,373 13% Class of 2024 27,949 4,477 16%\n\nWashU ED Acceptance Rate\n\nThe WashU ED acceptance rate for the Class of 2027 (ED 1 and ED 2 combined) was 26%. There were 4,517 applicants and 1,158 were admitted.\n\nThis university offers an Early Decision deadline of November 1 and an Early Decision 2 deadline in early January.\n\nWhat GPA do you need to get into WashU?\n\nEnrolled Class of 2027 freshmen had an average high school GPA of 4.24. Furthermore, a whopping 92% had a GPA of 3.75+.\n\nWhat class rank do you need to get accepted to WashU?\n\nAmong enrolled 2023-24 first-year students, 89% hailed from the top 10% of their graduating class, while 99% earned a place in the top quarter.\n\nWhat is the minimum SAT or ACT score for WashU?\n\nThose enrolled in the Class of 2027 sported middle-50% standardized test scores of 1500-1570 on the SAT and 33-35 on the ACT.\n\nAdmissions Trends & Notes\n\nWashU will remain test-optional for those applying to enter in fall 2024.\n\n21% of those entering the Class of 2027 are Pell Grant Eligible.\n\n17% of the entering Class of 2027 are first-generation students.\n\n43% of the Class of 2027 applied as a test-optional applicant.\n\nWashU fills about 55-60% of its class through both Early Decision rounds.\n\nWho Actually Gets Into WashU?\n\nLet’s now look at the demographics of the WashU Class of 2027.\n\nThe regions producing the greatest number of 2023-24 freshmen were the:\n\nMidwest: 30%\n\nMiddle States: 18%\n\nWest: 17%\n\nSouth: 11%\n\nSouthwest: 6%\n\nNew England: 5%\n\nInternational: 13%\n\nAs at any highly selective university, competition is toughest among those hailing from states with endless streams of qualified applicants (the entire Midwest and both coasts). If you hail from a less populated state like Alaska, North Dakota, or Montana, your location is more likely to provide a boost to your admissions chances. Unusual for any college, WashU does not have a substantial percentage of students from its host state of Missouri (typically around 10%).\n\nOverall, incoming students came from all 50 states and 29 countries. 65% came from more than 500 miles away.\n\nThe countries from which the highest percentage of international students typically hail from are:\n\nChina\n\nSouth Korea\n\nIndia\n\nCanada\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nLooking at ethnic identity, the breakdown of members of the Class of 2027 was as follows:\n\nAsian American: 27%\n\nHispanic: 13%\n\nBlack or African American: 12%\n\nWhite: 35%\n\nTotal Underrepresented Students of Color: 26%\n\nWashU (Washington University in St. Louis) Acceptance Rate — Continued\n\nThe breakdown by gender of the Class of 2027 slightly favors women:\n\nMale: 48%\n\nFemale: 52%\n\nWashU’s most recent crop of enrolled students came from the following types of high schools:\n\nPublic: 61%\n\nPrivate: 39%\n\nThe percentage of current freshmen in each school during the 2023-24 school year was as follows:\n\nCollege of Arts & Sciences: 65%\n\nMcKelvey School of Engineering: 17%\n\nOlin Business School: 9%\n\nCollege of Architecture: 4%\n\nCollege of Art: 4%\n\nBeyond Boundaries: 1%\n\nYield Rate\n\nWashington University in St. Louis’ yield rate—the percentage of accepted students who elect to enroll, divided by the total number of students who are admitted—was 47% for the Class of 2027. Keep in mind that this number is likely boosted by the high percentage of the class admitted during the early decision rounds.\n\nHow WashU Rates Applicants\n\nThere are 8 factors that WashU ranks as being “very important” to their admissions process: rigor of secondary school record, GPA, class rank, standardized test scores (even being test-optional), the essays, recommendations, talent/ability, and character/personal characteristics.\n\nIn the words of the admissions office: “Washington University is looking for students with a high school diploma or equivalent who took a challenging college-preparatory curriculum in high school complemented by extracurricular activities, community service, and work experience. Your senior-year transcript should show that you continue to take demanding courses. Most applicants take advantage of honors, advanced placement, and International Baccalaureate courses, if offered by their high schools.”\n\nWashU (Washington University in St. Louis) Acceptance Rate — Continued\n\nApplicants to the various undergraduate schools will need to bring unique, discipline-specific attributes with them. “Students applying to Olin Business School should have completed coursework in math at least through the pre-calculus level with calculus highly recommended. Students applying to McKelvey School of Engineering and/or students who are interested in pre-med should have completed coursework in physics and chemistry, as well as coursework in math at least through the pre-calculus level with calculus highly recommended…(those) interested in studying architecture or art should demonstrate interest, skill, or background in art and design by highlighting relevant course work or extracurricular activity. A portfolio is required for applicants to the College of Art and encouraged for applicants to the College of Architecture.”\n\nTips for Applying to WashU\n\nIf you plan on joining the roughly 33,000 WUSTL hopefuls for the next admissions cycle, you should know the following:\n\nFirstly, WashU expects to see evidence of advanced coursework in high school. Taking multiple advanced classes, particularly within your area of academic interest is a must. A minimum of 7-8 AP courses is a good target to aim for.\n\nWashU has extended its test-optional policy through fall of 2024.\n\nYou must list your “Academic Division” on the Common App as well as a “Primary Academic Interest.” You have the option of also listing a “Secondary Academic Interest” or a “Pre-Professional Interest.”\n\nWashU (Washington University in St. Louis) Acceptance Rate — Continued\n\nRather than an interview, WashU allows students to upload a 90-second video (optional). However, we highly recommend taking advantage of this opportunity to add more dimension to your application.\n\nWUSTL weighs “demonstrated interest” as heavily as any other school in the country in the admissions process. Thus, it will be noted whether or not you made a campus visit, contacted an admissions officer, etc. The school especially likes those who demonstrate interest in the most devoted way—through submitting a binding ED application.\n\nLastly, make sure to dedicate sufficient time and effort to the supplemental essay required by WUSTL. In the 2023-24 cycle, the prompts are as follows:\n\n1. Please tell us what you are interested in studying at college and why. (200 words) Undecided about your academic interest(s)?\n\nDon’t worry—tell us what excites you about the academic division you selected. Remember that all of our first-year students enter officially “undeclared” and work closely with their team of academic advisors to discover their academic passions. You can explore all of our majors and programs on our website.\n\nWashU (Washington University in St. Louis) Acceptance Rate — Continued\n\n2. This optional question allows you to add another dimension to your application – something that the admissions committee might not learn by reading your transcript or your personal statement.\n\nIf you prefer, you may focus your optional 90-second video submitted through the WashU Pathway on addressing one of these three questions. (Students who choose to submit a written response to one of these questions may still opt in to sharing an optional video).\n\nWashU is a place that values diversity of perspectives. We believe those perspectives come from a variety of experiences and identities. Respond to one of the following prompts to help us understand “Who are you?” (250 words)\n\nDiscuss a fresh perspective or opinion you brought to a collaborative setting or project.\n\nDescribe a community you are a part of and your place within it.\n\nTell us how your identity has impacted the way you view or interact with your community.\n\nFor detailed advice on the “Why WashU?” essay, visit our blog: WashU Essay Prompt and Tips.\n\nShould I apply to WashU?\n\nWith an acceptance rate of 12% last year, Washington University in St. Louis is a school that is looking for students who sit among the very top of their high school class and have posted SAT/ACT scores in at least the 95th percentile. Moreover, the school heavily favors students who commit via ED, so if WashU is your first choice, it will be in your best interest to submit an application during one of the early rounds.\n\nWashU (Washington University in St. Louis) Acceptance Rate – Final Thoughts\n\nWith such a competitive admissions process, all students need to make sure that they, in conjunction with a counselor, formulate an appropriate college list, containing a complement of “target” and “safety” schools. Hopefully, your dream of attending WUSTL becomes a reality, but, in the event that things don’t unfold as hoped, you’ll still end up at an institution with comparable attributes and opportunities.\n\nReady to start your college applications?
