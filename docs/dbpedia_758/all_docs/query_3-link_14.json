        "text": "Program Description\n\nLaw and Justice focuses on the areas of criminal justice, criminology, law, and social justice. Students study core institutions involved in criminal and juvenile justice (police, courts, corrections) as well as key content areas of study (criminal and procedural law, criminology, constitutional law, civil law). This prepares students to be knowledgeable about the systems they will work in and prepares them to be actively engaged in shaping practice and policy within agencies. Special emphasis is placed on how these fundamental institutions serve and interact with society. Upon completion, students will be prepared to work in agencies in law and justice and/or pursue graduate level work (graduate school or law school).\n\nLikely Career Paths\n\nLaw enforcement, attorney, correctional officer, probation and parole, correctional counseling, case worker, court administration, paralegal/legal assistant, social service/non-profit agency, wildlife agent.\n\nCourse Planning\n\nCompletion of a direct transfer agreement (DTA) is preferred. No other specific courses are required prior to transfer for admission to the Law and Justice major. Major may be completed in two full-time years after arrival.\n\nThe Transfer Equivalency Site (TES) provides CWU equivalencies for courses at other colleges and universities."
