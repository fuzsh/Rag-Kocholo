        "text": "Admissions Criteria:\n\nThe most important aspects of an application are: class rank, essay, recommendations, academic record, GPA, test scores, talent, volunteering, character, and extracurricular participation.\n\nAspects of an application which are considered are: legacy status, first generation status, race/ethnicity, interview, and demonstrated interest.\n\nWhile WashU does consider whether or not an athlete has been recruited, they do not offer any leeway on academics to recruited athletes.\n\nThe school is need aware. There is a limited amount of need-based financial aid available, and they will only admit a number of students needing financial aid that they will be able to reward it to. There is additional merit aid available, but that is administered separately.\n\nWhat is WashU Looking For?\n\nWhile the admissions process is the same for all admitted students, choice of division does affect admissions chances. Admissions officers want to see a high school background which matches a student’s proposed field of study. Thus engineering students should have a solid math and science background, while students interested in Arts & Sciences should be more well-rounded academically. Students interested in business should have a solid grounding in math.\n\nThe school began a new BS in environmental engineering, and will be looking for students interested in the program. This also fits in with one of their strategic, campus-wide goals, to focus more on sustainability and related research.\n\nTheir other strategic priorities are to increase diversity on campus, to engage more in public health, and to increase their entrepreneurship focus. Students with a focus in these areas will fit better with the school’s vision of itself, and receive more consideration.\n\nThe school’s holistic admissions process looks for three things: academic preparation, fit for the school’s community, and what you will contribute to campus. Fit for community is demonstrated through extracurriculars and essays in particular, while what you will bring to campus is especially concerned with a student’s extracurricular activities and academics.\n\nWashU Strategy:\n\nThe best way to increase your chances of admission is to apply Early Decision. More than half of students are admitted in the two ED rounds, from a much smaller pool of candidates. While the same academic requirements exist in the ED rounds, the school offers a much higher proportion of qualified candidates admission in these rounds. ED II offers less of a benefit than ED I, and you should use it if you aren’t ready to submit in the first round, or if your first choice school rejects you ED I and WashU is your second choice.\n\nCourse rigor is determined based on high school offerings, WashU wants to see that you have taken the most rigorous classes available to you. A high GPA in unchallenging classes will not be very beneficial.\n\nWashU will place a large number of students on the waitlist, but does not admit many off of it in most years. If you are placed on the waitlist, don’t count on being admitted, and seek a place at another school.\n\nThe school does consider demonstrated interest, and while the best way to do this is applying ED, you can use this guide to learn additional steps you can take to demonstrate interest in a school.\n\nAs WashU allows for students to take a second major from another division without transferring divisions (with advisor permission), students should always apply for the division they are best positioned for, and then take a second major in another division if that is what they decide they want to focus their studies on.\n\nBecause the school is need aware, if you will require financial aid to attend, consider making another school your first choice. Many schools which are in the same academic tier as WashU are need blind, and commit to meeting all demonstrated need."
