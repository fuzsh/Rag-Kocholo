        "text": "The Association of American Law Schools (AALS) selected the symposium proposal, “Expanding Access to Justice through Legal Tech Innovation and Education,” to be featured at the AALS 2025 Annual Meeting in January 2025. TILE Professors Chon and Thompson, along with Penn Carey Law School professor Miguel Willis (SU Law '17), will assemble a dozen professors specializing in legal tech education to speak at this half-day symposium.\n\nThe American Association of Colleges and Universities (AACU) selected Seattle University for its 2024-25 Institute on AI, Pedagogy, and the Curriculum. Professor Thompson will participate in exploring the current digital evolution of student learning with generative artificial intelligence (AI). The Institute asks how to ensure that students achieve a range of learning outcomes within existing courses and programs, balanced with academic integrity and traditional pedagogy, with the use of generative AI.\n\nTILE Directors Margaret Chon and LeighAnne Thompson received a Multidisciplinary Generative AI Research Award from Seattle University to develop a Spring ’25 semester course on Ethical Legal Technology Development. This will be an interdisciplinary course co-taught by education, law, and computer science professors, for students who are interested in learning how to collaborate on ethical legal tech development.\n\nProfessors Chon and Thompson are also serving on the Washington State Bar Association Legal Technology Task Force, chaired by former Mayor and U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan. Also appointed by the WSBA Board of Governors to this task force are Seattle U Law alumnae Laura Lemire and Kari Petrasek. The task force charge and charter can be found here: The Washington State Bar Association's Legal Technology Task Force (wsba.org)."
