        "text": "Environmental Law Concentration Track\n\nEnvironmental Law is a complex and often highly contentious area of law that responds to science, economics and ethics as they relate to the world's natural resources. Issues surrounding the use, ownership and stewardship of our natural resources and surrounding environment prompt intense legal and public policy debates. The University of Washington School of Law offers a J.D. concentration track in Environmental Law. Students are taught about the importance of statutory and administrative sources of environmental law, as well as the agency rulings and court opinions that interpret them.\n\nOur faculty members are at the forefront of many new developments in environmental law, so students have early and complete access to changes in the law as they occur. In addition, researchers in other departments within the University of Washington contribute significantly toward much of the scientific study that ultimately prompts change in environmental law. School of Law faculty present these developments in context with other substantive areas of the law to provide practical training in applying environmental theories and ideals in all areas of legal practice.\n\nFaculty Advisors\n\nSanne Knudsen\n\nTodd A. Wildermuth\n\nMonte Mills\n\nProgram Requirements\n\nGENERAL\n\nFollow all of the steps outlined on the Concentration Tracks page.\n\nCOURSE REQUIREMENTS\n\n(Not all courses will be available each year.)\n\nStudents must take a minimum of 30 credits in environmental law curriculum as follows:\n\nStudents must take:\n\nA509 Administrative Law (4 credits)\n\nA527 Environmental Law: Pollution Control (4 credits)\n\nB585 Natural Resources Law (4 credits)\n\nStudents must earn at least 9 credits in courses from the following list:\n\nA525 Water Law (3 credits)\n\nA529 Public Land Law (3 credits)\n\nA540 Land Use Planning (3 credits)\n\nA545 International Environmental Law (3 credits)\n\nA565 American Indian Law (4 credits)\n\nB529 Advanced Environmental Law and Practice (2 credits)\n\nB565 U.S. Coastal and Ocean Law (4 credits)\n\nE596 Wildlife Law (3 credits)\n\nE598 Climate Change and the Law (4 credits)\n\nWith approval of the Environmental Law Track advisor, other advanced environmental law courses, or courses outside the law school related to environmental issues, may be used towards this requirement\n\nApplied:\n\nWriting Requirement\n\nAll students must complete an advanced writing project on an environmental law subject. Subject to approval by the Environmental Law Track advisor, this requirement may be satisfied by writing a major research paper in conjunction with an environmental seminar (4-6 credits), as part of an independent study (Advanced Writing Project Law E500), or by publishing a law journal article.\n\nClinic Externship, or Equivalent Practice Requirement\n\nStudents must earn at least 6 credits by enrolling in the Regulatory Environmental Law and Policy Clinic or by completing an externship with an organization approved by the law school public service program and the Environmental Law Track advisor (such as American Rivers, Center for Environmental Law & Policy, Pacific Legal Foundation, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Natural Resources).\n\nAs part of meeting the externship requirement, students must take B567 General Externship Perspective Seminar (2 credits) or its equivalent (e.g. B529 Advanced Environmental Law and Practice Seminar (2 credits)).\n\nThe Environmental Law Track Advisor may waive the clinical or externship requirement for students who document equivalent practical experience in the area (e.g. through a summer internship focused on environmental law). To the extent that the student has equivalent experience, he or she must still take sufficient additional credits of approved environmental courses in order to meet the 30 credit hour minimum for the concentration.\n\nOther:\n\nTo the extent that students have met the minimum course, writing, and applied requirements listed above and have not earned 30 credits, students may earn additional credits by (1) taking approved environmental courses (see section 2 above) or (2) taking any of the following courses, all of which are highly recommended and help develop essential lawyering skills for complex environmental litigation and practice:\n\nB500 Civil Procedure II\n\nB507 Federal Courts & the Federal System\n\nA549 Advanced Legal Research\n\nB520 Trial Advocacy\n\nB519 Pre-trial Practice\n\nB523 Negotiations\n\nB525 Alternative Dispute Resolution\n\nEnvironmental Law Learning Outcomes\n\nJ.D. students electing to specialize in the Environmental Concentration Track should achieve the competencies expected of all J.D. students at the University of Washington.
