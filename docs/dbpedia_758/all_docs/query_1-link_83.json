        "text": "With almost 150 years of history and an enviable setting in the heart of the nation's capital, The George Washington University Law School attracts thousands of applicants and hundreds of matriculants each year. Aside from its location in one of the world's biggest and most competitive legal markets, the school features a solid national reputation and one of the country's most prominent intellectual property programs.\n\nHistory\n\nIn the Republic's early years, when the nation's new capital was no more than a small collection of public buildings separated by pastureland, President George Washington advised Congress to establish a national university at the seat of government.\n\nHis goal was to educate future generations of civil servants and forge a national identity based on \"principles friendly to republican government and the true and genuine liberties of mankind.\" He left in his will 50 shares of stock in the Potowmack Canal Company for the endowment of a university \"to which the youth of fortune and talents from all parts thereof might be sent for the completion of their Education in all the branches of polite literature-in arts and Sciences-in acquiring knowledge in the principles of Politics & good Government.\"\n\nThough it would be decades before George Washington's namesake university would be established by an Act of Congress, the George Washington University Law School-established in 1865-was the first law school in the District of Columbia. Today, the School continues to embody the aspirations of the nation's first president.\n\nAdmissions\n\nThey are delighted to welcome their Fall 2022 entering class. This year, they received more than 9,000 applications. Their entering class is composed of 516 1Ls (491 full-time and 25 part-time) and 69 transfer students.\n\nFor our entering 1L class, the median LSAT is 168 and the median GPA is 3.84. Diversity in every sense is an important quality of our community 53% identify as female and 34% identify as a minority. The students are from 17 countries, 47 states, the District of Columbia, and 220 undergraduate institutions. The most common states were New York, California, Maryland, Virginia, and New Jersey. The median age is 23, and the oldest student is 46.\n\nStatistics\n\nAdmissions Stats Class of: 2020-2021 2021-2022 25th - 50th - 75th percentile LSAT 159 - 166 - 167 162 - 167 - 168 25th - 50th - 75th percentile GPA 3.45 - 3.76 - 3.85 3.55 - 3.83 - 3.91 Acceptance rate 34.1% 21.6% Applications received 7836 10585 Acceptances 2676 2283 Matriculants 1990 1588\n\nThe George Washington University Law School will begin accepting applications for the Fall 2023 semester on September 1, 2022. This is the first day that applications will be accepted. Candidates are encouraged to apply as early as possible to ensure that their application is complete and can be reviewed by the admissions committee. The deadline to apply is March 1, 2023. Applications received after this date will be considered on a rolling basis. Decisions will be released on a rolling basis beginning in April 2023.\n\nMultiple LSAT Scores\n\nAlthough the admissions committee will see all LSAT information, GW gives the most weight to the highest score. Per American Bar Association regulations, the law school will also report each matriculating student's highest score for rankings and other purposes.\n\nPersonal Statements and Addenda\n\nApplicants must submit a personal statement on any subject of importance that will assist the Admissions Committee in its decision. It should be no more than two pages, double-spaced. Applicants may also submit an optional identity statement discussing characteristics and accomplishments they believe will contribute positively to the GW Law community and to the legal profession. For more information on personal statements and application essays, check out the TLS Guide to Personal Statements.\n\nLetters of Recommendation\n\nAt least one letter of recommendation must be submitted through the LSAC Letter of Recommendation/Evaluation Service. To get some additional advice on obtaining letters of recommendation, click here.\n\nBinding Early Decision Program\n\nApplicants who apply through either the binding Early Decision process or the Presidential Merit Scholarship Program must complete and submit a Binding Agreement along with their applications. To read a TLS article about making the decision between ED and RD (or Regular Decision), click here.\n\nTransfers, Waitlists, and Deferrals\n\nThe George Washington University Law School's transfer class comprises students from 43 different law schools. They come from 7 different countries, in addition to the United States. These countries are Brazil, China, the Dominican Republic, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. In addition, 18 states and the District of Columbia are represented. The class is 50% female and 46% diverse. The ages of the students in the class range from 21 to 39, with a median age of 26. 8 of the students have advanced degrees, and 34 speak at least one language other than English.\n\nGeorge Washington Law places several applicants on a waitlist each year. The school encourages those on the waitlist to remain engaged with the law school, notifying GW Law of any relevant updates like second-semester college grades, honors, or work promotions. Some waitlisted candidates will receive notice of their acceptance as late as August.\n\nThe law school grants a limited number of deferrals to admitted students each year, considering requests on a case-by-case basis. One-year requests are more likely to be approved than two-year requests. However, multiple-year deferrals will be granted for exceptional circumstances like military duty or well-known public service fellowships.

This budget includes the cost of tuition, books, supplies, and living expenses. The living expense portion of COA is the same for all students, except for the books and supplies item, which varies slightly based on your degree program. For the 2022-2023 academic year, tuition is $2,370 per credit hour. You can use this budget to help plan your expenses for the year.\n\nCost of Attendance\n\n2022-2023 Academic Year (Fall and Spring) Cost of Attendance, JD program Expense Full-Time JD Part-Time JD Books and Supplies $2,100 $1,580 Personal $3,000 $3,000 Room and Board $22,800 $22,800 Transportation $1,700 $1,700 Tuition and Fees $67,380* $49,770* Total Costs $96,980 $78,850\n\nScholarships and Financial Aid\n\nThe law school works with students individually to ensure that each receives the most generous aid package available. All admitted applicants will be considered for merit-based scholarships. These awards, which vary in amount, are based on the strength of applications; no separate scholarship applications are required. Grants are also awarded to admitted and continuing students based on financial need and availability of resources.\n\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you may be eligible to apply for need-based grants and federal loans from the George Washington University Law School. You may not be eligible for need-based grants if you are transfer students, joint BA/JD students, receiving tuition benefits as a GW employee, or receiving a GW Law Merit Scholarship of $20,000 or more.\n\nGW Law supports a limited number of students committed to public interest work, including summer funding and fellowships for 3L's. The school also has a loan repayment assistance program (LRAP) that provides up to $8,000 a year of assistance to graduates working in low-paying public service. For more information about GW's LRAP-which is not guaranteed for all qualifying students-see the TLS LRAP profile.\n\nAcademics\n\nAt GW Law, they believe that legal education should be about more than just coursework. Their curriculum is designed to be collaborative and distinctive so that students can explore various areas of the law and find what they are passionate about. In addition, they offer flexible pathways to legal education. Students can easily switch between full-time and part-time status to take advantage of job opportunities. At the same time, in law school, they accommodate family responsibilities and plan their education to fit changing needs. This dynamic combination of support and career development from the start of each student’s legal education sets the GW Law experience apart from all others.\n\nCurriculum\n\nFirst-year students at George Washington Law take a traditional slate of mandatory classes: Torts, Property, Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, Civil Procedure, and Contracts (the latter two are taken both semesters of 1L year). In addition, GW requires students to take a graded semester of Legal Writing and Research. This related Advocacy class focuses on pretrial motions, appellate briefs, and a course on Professional Responsibility and Ethics.\n\nOwing to its large size, GW Law offers over 200 classroom options for upper-level students, not counting many clinical opportunities. According to the ABA, these classes include 75 seminars. 1L sections are large (at around 100 students), although these are broken up into much smaller groups for Legal Writing and Research.\n\nWhile the law school does not offer major-like specialty tracks, the school highlights seven \"academic focus areas\" with strong faculty and resource support, including Environmental Law and Government Procurement Law. GW's Intellectual Property Law program is especially notable: U.S. News & World Report ranks the school third in the country, trailing only elite Bay Area schools Berkeley and Stanford.[viii]\n\nProfessors\n\nAs one of the nation's biggest centers of legal teaching and scholarship, GW Law boasts a large and diverse faculty. University of Chicago professor Brian Leiter's most recent study on scholarly impact, as indicated by several citations, ranks George Washington's faculty eighteenth in the nation, despite the exercise's admitted bias against larger schools. GW placed two spots ahead of nearby Georgetown in this study.[ix]\n\nProminent faculty members include Naomi Cahn, a well-known expert in family law; Orin Kerr, who has authored or co-authored popular casebooks in criminal procedure and cyberspace law; Richard J. Pierce, Jr., the most commonly cited administrative law scholar in the world; and Jeffrey Rosen, whose legal insights frequently appear in top law reviews and a variety of popular media outlets. Still, one TLS user writes that the value of GW's professors goes beyond scholarly reputation:\n\nThe professors are fabulous at GW. Many are top scholars in their field, but so many more [have] practical experience. For example, I am leaning towards prosecution, and two of my professors this semester have been prosecutors at either a US Attorney's Office or [the] DOJ. Almost all are approachable and eager to help you understand the material, either after class or at office hours. For example, my Evidence professor even agreed to help me figure out some evidence issues for my mock trial competition.[x]\n\nHowever, George Washington's large student body does make for bigger class sizes: at roughly 15:1, GW's student-to-faculty ratio is the highest among top-twenty schools.[xi] Enrollment in some classes tops 75 or even 100 students. While one TLS user complains that this makes for a \"diploma mill\" atmosphere,[xii] others point out that except for classes taught by the most prominent professors, most 2L and 3L classes are not huge, and claim that \"the larger student body is not really 'felt' in the classroom.\"[xiii]\n\nLL.M. Program\n\nGW Law offers a general Masters of Law degree for foreign-trained lawyers who wish to take the bar and practice in the United States. The law school also confers LL.M. degrees in nine specialty areas, including Business and Finance Law, Environmental Law, Intellectual Property Law, International and Comparative Law, Litigation and Dispute Resolution Law, and National Security and U.S. Foreign Relations Law. For most of these tracks, LL.M. students take classes alongside J.D. candidates.\n\nJoint Degrees\n\nJ.D. students at GW Law benefit from all the advantages of a national research university, including various joint degree options with four schools at GWU. Law students interested in business or finance can earn an M.B.A. from the George Washington University School of Business. Those with global or political interests can pursue a degree with the Elliot School of International Affairs, and those interested in health issues can earn a Master of Public Health with the School of Public Health and Health Services. The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences also offers joint degrees with the law school, like a Master of Public Policy or an M.A. in legal history or women's studies.\n\nJoint degree hopefuls must be accepted to each program separately. Once admitted, joint degree candidates take a standard 1L course load before beginning their graduate study. Twelve credits from the second degree can generally be counted toward the J.D. credit hours requirement. The university offers two joint degree options to Master of Laws students: an M.P.H and three M.A. tracks with the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nGW Law students can spend a summer studying European and International Law at the University of Augsburg, Intellectual Property Law in Munich, or International Human Rights Law at Oxford University. Through the North American Consortium on Legal Education, students can also spend a semester studying at one of several law schools in Canada or Mexico.[xiv]\n\nStudent Activities\n\nJournals\n\nGeorge Washington Law publishes seven journals on which students can gain editing experience, and over 400 students generally become involved with at least one publication. The George Washington Law Review is the most competitive of these journals. Students are chosen largely on the basis of first-year grades, but a writing competition also weighs in the selection process, and up to 10% of each year's new members may be selected solely on a \"write-on\" basis. The Law Review holds a separate writing competition for transfer students and an editing competition to select members for editorial board positions.\n\nLaw Review writing competition results are also used to select members for the George Washington International Law Review, International Law in Domestic Courts, andthe Public Law Contract Journal. Other editing opportunities include the American Intellectual Property Law Association Quarterly Journal, the Federal Circuit Bar Journal, and the Journal of Energy and Environmental Law.\n\nClinics and Externships\n\nGW Law's size and location provide a rich diversity of clinical experiences. Twelve different clinics span a range of interests, from immigration law and domestic violence advocacy to small business development and consumer mediation. One of these clinics, D.C. Law Students in Court, is a joint effort between George Washington and four other area law schools. The Vaccine Injury Clinic offers a unique experience, as it is the only one of its kind.\n\nGW students, with little initiative, can pursue faculty-supervised externships in one of the world's most exciting legal markets. Students in the Outside Placement program must enroll in a co-requisite course. Students participating in the program have had the opportunity to work for federal judges, government agencies like the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, and prestigious public interest organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the World Health Organization.\n\nGW Law students who use the TLS forums consistently rave about the year-round opportunities living in D.C. presents, especially for those willing to do some legwork on their own. Says one student:\n\nThere's an advantage, especially during the school year, to us (and Georgetown) just because of access. The internships that exist during summer don't vanish during the year, and there's less competition for them[xv]\n\nAnother writes:\n\nIf you go to GW, you can work for DOJ or any federal agency, intern for a District Court judge, work on the Hill, or even at the White House, and get class credit for it. It can be hard to get into those places in the summer, but it is pretty easy to do so during the spring or fall.[xvi]\n\nSkills Boards\n\nGeorge Washington Law gives students three opportunities to develop their lawyering skills through competition. The Moot Court Board and Mock Trial Board each hold several annual internal competitions and send students to compete in interscholastic events. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Board explores non-litigious methods of resolving conflicts, allowing interested students to hone their negotiation and arbitration skills.[xvii]\n\nStudent Organizations\n\nOver forty student groups represent various interests, ranging from professional niches (the Corporate and Business Law Society and the Cyberlaw Students Association) to the less serious (the GW Law Softball Club and the entertainers' group, Law Revue). These organizations, along with journals, experiential learning, and the District's ample professional development and recreation opportunities, should ensure that no GW Law student becomes bored.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe law school offers the kind of modern amenities one would expect from a well-respected institution, including three moot court rooms, campus-wide wireless access, and \"smart\" classrooms that integrate recent technology with the traditional teaching of law. Law students also have access to the conveniences of a large research university, including necessities like a well-equipped fitness facility (the Lerner Health and Wellness Center). The Jacob Burns Law Library boasts over 600,000 volumes and a large staff.[xviii]\n\nIf students have one complaint about GW Law's facilities, it seems to be limited space. The library, for example, has seating capacity for 637 students, or about 40% of the student body. One TLS poster who attended GW complains:\n\nThe law school is cramped. It's made up of multiple buildings that were once individual but have since been renovated and made into a larger building. I liked the idea, but in practice so many people in such small quarters got very irritating, often to the point where I couldn't stand to be there. Though, to be fair, they have since added a new wing and cafe. That helps a bit, I suppose.[xix]\n\nEmployment Prospects and Bar Passage\n\nGeorge Washington University Law School provides its students with a top-tier education, preparing them well for a successful career in law. Students who graduate from GWU Law earn a median salary of $190,000 upon entering the private sector, and those who go into public interest work can expect to make around $60,000. An overwhelming majority of GWU Law graduates (93%) pass the bar on their first try, and many go on to work for law firms or as clerks for judges.\n\nInformation on employment outcomes for the Class of 2020 may not reflect a particular law school’s typical results in this area. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, bar admission exams were canceled or delayed in many jurisdictions, thus making it more challenging for graduates to secure employment by the annual Graduate Employment Status Date of March 15. Please reference the 3 years of employment outcome data posted on the ABA Required Disclosures webpage of each ABA-Approved Law School or at www.abarequireddisclosures.org.\n\nEmployment Summary Report 2021\n\nEmployment Summary Report 2020\n\nEmployment Summary Report 2019\n\n2021 Bar Passage Outcomes Report\n\nGeorge Washington University Law School's bar passage outcomes report for 2021 shows that the school's graduates had a high success rate when it came to passing the bar exam. The report showed that out of all the school's graduates who took the bar exam, almost 80% felt well-prepared for it. These results are very encouraging and suggest that the school is excelling at preparing students for their future careers as lawyers.\n\nHistorical Bar Passage Data\n\nPrivate Practice\n\nAs noted above, most GW Law students will work for firms. Summer associate and full-time positions with large, market-paying firms have been harder to come by in recent years. Students without top grades are increasingly sweating out on-campus interviews or scrambling to find other employment options.\n\nStudents with strong intellectual property backgrounds have an easier time securing lucrative firm offers than most. The strong reputation of the IP program, as well as the limited supply of law students with hard science backgrounds, combines to give these candidates higher employment chances and greater geographic reach, as one TLS poster attests:\n\nFirms that recruit GW students for IP are always more lenient in terms of grades. I remember at OCI a firm I was interviewing [with] required a 3.4 unless you were IP [in which case the cut-off] was a 3.0. We also have a bunch of people here from California who plan on returning when they are done with law school. I am not an IP person, but I know from some of my friends who are that the connections are just insane.\n\nA 2L with an engineering background adds:\n\nA lot of my friends at GW happened to be in IP, and almost 100 percent of us have found summer associate positions - GW is so well known for IP that you really can't go wrong here.[xxii]\n\nClerkships\n\nGW students have clerked for some of the nation's most prestigious judges: for example, four GW grads have clerked for the Supreme Court in the past five years. A Clerkship Office helps current and recent graduates navigate the involved application process. However, clerking is not a particularly common career move for GW students: just a tenth of each graduating class clerks in a given year, and the school typically places fewer Article III clerks on a percentage basis than its ranking and reputation might suggest.\n\nPublic Interest\n\nGW Law's Career Development Office has a staff member dedicated to public interest opportunities, and David Johnson serves as the school's Assistant Dean for Public Interest and Public Service Law.[xxiii] The school has a limited LRAP program, and the Washington, D.C. area provides public interest-minded students with many opportunities to connect with potential employers. Still, public interest students make up a fairly small percentage of each year's class, and students who finance a significant fraction of the total cost of attendance may find it extremely difficult to take low-paying public service jobs without relying on federal income-based repayment.\n\nHousing\n\nGW Law has recently begun offering law students the option of university-sponsored housing. First-year students have the option of living in the Aston, a West End residence comprised of one-bedroom efficiency apartments. The residential complex is within six blocks of the law school and offers walking access to the fashionable Dupont Circle neighborhood, but comes with a hefty price tag: $15,500 for the current academic year. Law students can also live in the Hall on Virginia Avenue, a cheaper option at $10,150 a year.\n\nThe majority of law students live in non-university apartments. While D.C. is an exciting place for young people to live, it is not cheap: according to www.payscale.com, housing in the District is nearly twice as expensive as the national average. One TLS poster speculates:\n\nI would say most students live within one mile of school, though many live in neighborhoods as diverse as Eastern Market, Arlington, Georgetown, and Penn Quarter. The school is centrally located and easy to get to by multiple forms of public transportation, so there are many options outside Foggy Bottom.[xxiv]\n\nMultiple TLS users advise prospective students to consider commuting to school from nearby Arlington, Virginia, where rent is generally cheaper and accommodations more spacious. Neighborhoods like Roslyn, Clarendon, and Ballston are a short metro ride away from Foggy Bottom on the Orange Line.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nStudent life at George Washington Law seems defined by size and location. Some love the large and diverse student body, while others complain about a lack of class cohesion. The economic downturn, with its corresponding increase in competition for selective jobs, has no doubt affected quality of life for some. Still, one TLS user happily reports:\n\nAlmost everyone I have met at GW is friendly and helpful, and always willing to share notes. I have never experienced any backbiting that I was expecting from a competitive environment.[xxv]\n\nThe school does its part to help students relax: each \"Thirsty Thursday,\" the school gives out free beer, and the GW Student Bar Association puts on its version of the law school staple, Bar Review. While Foggy Bottom is not a huge nightlife spot, nearby neighborhoods like Adams Morgan, Dupont Circle, Georgetown, and North Arlington offer fun options for various personalities.\n\nOutside of GWU's immediate environs, Washington's benefits are not limited to networking opportunities. Students have plenty of options for escaping the stresses of law school. One of the country's greatest cities for culture, D.C. boasts landmarks like the Smithsonian Institution museums and the Kennedy Center. The city has major league sports and a vibrant music scene, with various neighborhoods and scenes to suit most every taste. A well-organized metro system makes navigating the city and its surrounding suburbs easy even without a car, and national entertainment acts make D.C. a regular stop.\n\nProspective students should, however, keep the metro area's high cost of living in mind. As mentioned above, rent will run most students $1,000 or more, and other costs like transportation and entertainment are higher than the national metropolitan average.\n\nSynopsis\n\nAs the second-best law school with year-round access to the large and diverse D.C. market, George Washington Law School has a lot to offer prospective law students. GW Law students live in a fun, fast-paced city where opportunities to connect with top law firms, government agencies, and non-profit organizations abound; furthermore; they can take advantage of a deep, experienced faculty and the considerable resources afforded by one of the country's largest law schools. However, those thinking about GW without substantial financial support should look before they leap. Rising tuition and high living expenses make attending the law school a pricey proposition, and the recent recession looks to keep high-paying legal jobs well below peak levels for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe George Washington University Law School\n\n2000 H Street, NW Washington, DC 20052\n\nPhone: 202.994.6261\n\nFax: 202.994.8980\n\nAdmissions Office\n\n700 20th Street, NW\n\nWashington, DC 20052\n\nPhone: 202.994.7230\n\nFax: 202.994.3597\n\nE-mail: admissions@law.gwu.edu\n\nSummary\n\nEstablished 1865 Location Washington, DC Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew 2022 US News Ranking 25th LSAT Median Score 167 GPA Median Score 3.83 Bar Passage Rate 93% (2022) Employment Rate 71% (2022) Cost $67,380 Average Debt $154,504 Application Deadline March 1, 2023\n\nForum and Discussion\n\nThe George Washington University Law School Discussions\n\nLaw School Admissions Forums\n\nLaw Student Forums\n\nLaw School Class Forums\n\nReference"
