        "text": "In this guide\n\nDegree options\n\nConsiderations\n\nRequirements\n\nCurriculum\n\nTuition\n\nCareer outlook\n\nFAQs\n\nProgram listings\n\nCybersecurity law professionals are in high demand. From security analysts to pen testers, the need for employees trained and qualified in this field far outstrips the current supply. This skills gap includes people who hold a cybersecurity law degree\n\nAs the frequency and severity of cyber breaches increase, so does the political pressure for legislation to protect personally identifiable information (PII), proprietary information, and intellectual property.\n\nThe need to understand and adhere to new and changing laws and regulations creates a thriving market for cybersecurity legal expertise. Cybersecurity regulation compliance is crucial to business success.\n\nWorking in cybersecurity law will require specialized education. This guide will outline the various options and requirements for those wishing to work in this specialized field of law.\n\nDegree programs for cybersecurity law\n\nThere are essentially four graduate degrees that qualify an individual to work on the legal side of cybersecurity. These are an MLS, a J.D., an LL.M., and an S.J.D. These are discussed in order from the least amount of training needed to the most amount of education required below.\n\nThe main focus of this guide will be the LL.M. degree with a concentration in cybersecurity. It is the most beneficial law degree for students aspiring to become practicing cybersecurity lawyers.\n\nMLS (Master of Legal Studies) is a master’s degree that provides a firm working knowledge of the law and concentrates on compliance, legal research and analysis, risk management, ethics, and professional standards. Earning an MLS does not allow the graduate to practice law.\n\nThere are, however, many employment opportunities within private corporations for which an MLS is sufficient. Graduates will typically find these opportunities in risk and compliance departments as legal assistants or paralegals.\n\nA Doctor of Jurisprudence (J.D.) program provides students with a broad understanding of the law. With a J.D., graduates are permitted to practice law in the United States after passing a state bar examination and obtaining a law license. As the minimum requirement for practicing law, law school J.D. curriculum does not usually include courses specific to cybersecurity law.\n\nA Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree is an internationally recognized post-Juris Doctor (J.D.) law degree. To be awarded an LL.M., US domestic students must already hold a J.D. degree, and international students must have a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) or its equivalent.\n\nLL.M. degrees focus on a specific area of the law, providing students with the experiences and expertise to become an experts in that area. Cybersecurity concentration provides law students with a sophisticated understanding of the legal, policy, and technical structures associated with cybersecurity.\n\nGraduating with an LL.M. in Cybersecurity Law and Data Privacy will prepare a student for a job practicing law in the fields of cybersecurity and information privacy, or any area that deals with high-value or confidential information. Lawyers with LL.M. degrees work at law firms, for the government, or as in-house counsel at corporations.\n\nThe highest degree offered in the field of law is the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.). It is equal to the Doctor of Philosophy.\n\nThe National Association of Legal Professionals states that the S.J.D. is “the most advanced law degree that would follow the earning of the J.D. and LL.M. degrees.” Most schools require an LL.M. before admission to an S.J.D. or a Ph.D. law degree program. Like the Ph.D., the S.J.D. degree generally requires a graded dissertation, orally defended and then often published as a book or series of articles.\n\nRelated resources\n\nConsiderations for choosing the right cybersecurity law degree program\n\nNot every law student will have the available time or access to the required financial resources needed to pursue an LL.M. in Cybersecurity. If a student’s situation dictates that they take a progressive approach to their legal studies, they may wish to begin with an MLS.\n\nAn MLS will often provide the graduate with the opportunity to work in a legal department for and with lawyers who specialize in cybersecurity. This strategy can provide valuable experience, but it should be noted that while there are some part-time and online J.D. and LL.M. programs, many programs require students to attend full-time in-person (when in-person classes are open).\n\nBeginning with an MLS presents a danger that additional education will become difficult if life circumstances do not allow the student to attend law school full-time. Going back to school is often more difficult than staying in school.\n\nA common route to a job in cybersecurity law is to obtain a J.D. and pass the state bar exam. This common strategy will allow the graduate to practice law broadly while gaining specific cybersecurity experience in the workplace. After some time in the workplace, a licensed lawyer may petition to take a hiatus from work to return to law school and get an LL.M. or find an online LL.M. option.\n\nThe most direct route to becoming a practicing cybersecurity legal specialist is to continue in law school for an additional year after completing a J.D. to get an LL.M. This is the preferred strategy for students who have the available time and financial resources.\n\nEducation advisors recommend the LL.M. degree, especially for those students wanting to specialize in global cybersecurity law or work in cybersecurity law for an international firm.\n\nThe LL.M. is the degree of choice for career advancement and international credibility, particularly in today’s competitive and globally focused legal environment. Early- and mid-career lawyers often pursue the LL.M. when looking to expand their proficiency in a specific area of law, such as cybersecurity.\n\nThe final option to consider for cybersecurity law education is obtaining an S.J.D. This degree should be a consideration for students who intend to invest their careers in cybersecurity research or academia.\n\nCybersecurity law school admission requirements\n\nAfter completing the requirements for a J.D. degree, students can apply for admission to their law school’s LL.M. program. These are typically one-year programs that require full-time attendance.\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin Law School (Texas Law) LL.M. admissions and curriculum requirements are similar to many other law schools. They can be used as a guide to what students may expect in these areas.\n\nTexas Law requires students to complete at least 24 semester hours of credit and keep a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 1.90 to be awarded an LL.M. degree.\n\nStudents must maintain a GPA of at least 1.80 to continue in the program. Students who fail one class are placed on scholastic probation. A student who fails two courses in a single semester will be dropped from the program, regardless of the student’s GPA.\n\nCybersecurity law degree curriculum\n\nTexas Law provides an excellent example of the curriculum requirements for an LL.M. degree with a concentration in cybersecurity law. Like many other law schools, Texas Law does not accept transfer credits in the LL.M. Program. Students currently in another LL.M. program may apply to the Texas Law LL.M. Program but must take the required 24 credits.\n\nStudents must complete a total of 24 credit hours in one academic year.\n\n12 concentration-specific credit hours.\n\nA three-credit writing seminar or a two-credit directed research project.\n\nConstitutional Law for Foreign Lawyers. (This is a requirement for students with a foreign law degree. Students with a background in common law may request a waiver from this requirement.)\n\nNon-US J.D. students interested in taking a US state bar exam will also be required to take specific bar-required courses to be eligible to sit for the bar exam.\n\nAll Texas Law LL.M. in Cybersecurity students must take the following courses:\n\nCybersecurity Law & Policy — This course surveys the landscape of legal, policy, and institutional design issues associated with cybersecurity, ranging from litigation and regulatory matters to hostilities in cyberspace.\n\nTechnology of Cybersecurity, An Introduction for Law and Policy Students – This course provides a tailored introduction to key technical concepts associated with cybersecurity.\n\nWriting Seminar, Emerging Cybersecurity Legal and Policy Issues — This seminar engages an evolving array of cutting-edge legal and policy issues related to cybersecurity, including a variety of guest speakers.\n\nInternational Law of Cyber Conflict — This course explores the application of international law to state-sponsored cyber activities.\n\nPrivacy Law — This course examines U.S. and foreign legal regimes for the protection of information.\n\nThe University of Southern California (USC) cites the outcome of their LL.M. in privacy law and cybersecurity degree curriculum as follows:\n\nEvaluate, manage, and mitigate risk associated with the acquiring, storage/retention, use, sharing, and disposal of data.\n\nIdentify privacy and data protection issues across various sectors.\n\nUnderstand the legal aspects of cyber risks in different business sectors, including legal issues with computer hacking crimes, identity theft, internet fraud, malware and phishing offenses, and civil torts.\n\nIdentify threats to cybersecurity and the necessary compliance frameworks for cybersecurity.\n\nCommunicate effectively about privacy and data protection issues.\n\nDemonstrate solutions to relevant stakeholders such as customers, end-users, suppliers, vendors, regulatory authorities, and others.\n\nCybersecurity law school tuition\n\nLaw school is by no means a low-cost proposition: the overall earning potential and cultural status associated with being a lawyer commands premium tuition rates.\n\nAmerican Bar Association-approved law schools usually require three years of full-time study to earn a J.D. An LL.M. in Cybersecurity degree will take another full year.\n\nAs noted on Nerd Wallet, “Most law school scholarships come from law schools themselves to attract the best candidates. But private awards are available, and taking the time to apply could reduce the amount you borrow for your J.D.”\n\nCybersecurity law career outlook\n\nWhile not explicitly required for an LL.M. in cybersecurity law degree, many experts recommend that a job applicant have at least a basic knowledge of cybersecurity principles. Taking undergraduate courses in IT and information security is a good investment for aspiring cybersecurity legal professionals.\n\nObtaining an IT-related certification demonstrates a basic understanding of cybersecurity and computer networks. Studying for the certification will provide students with a conceptual framework of how IT professionals manage security risks and mitigate vulnerabilities.\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment in computer and information technology occupations will grow 23 percent from 2022 to 2032, much faster than the average for all occupations.\n\nMany major law firms have begun to establish cybersecurity law practices. Graduates of LL.M. programs will be employable across every industry – both public and private sectors – as consultants, chief security officers for businesses, and government.\n\nGlassdoor says that a chief security officer‘s base pay is $153,000 per year.\n\nThe USC Gould School of Law suggests that there are five careers that an LL.M. graduate can pursue. Of those five, Law Firm Partner is most applicable for a cybersecurity concentration.\n\nAccording to PayScale, the median salary for law firm partners in the United States stands at $179,953. Bonuses and profit-sharing agreements can significantly boost wages to more than $400,000 a year.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nList of schools offering cybersecurity law degree programs"
