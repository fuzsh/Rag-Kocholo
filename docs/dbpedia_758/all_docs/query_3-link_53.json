Official transcripts of all academic work at the undergraduate and graduate levels are required for all students. USD Knudson School of Law shall have on file the student’s official transcripts verifying all academic credits undertaken and degree(s) conferred. USD Knudson School of Law retains the right to require credential evaluations from organizations, such as Educational Credential Evaluators/World Education Services (ECE/WES), if such an evaluation is deemed necessary.\n\nOfficial transcripts must be sent directly to the University of South Dakota Knudson School of Law from the issuing institution(s). Official transcript(s) may be sent in paper or electronic format. A paper official transcript must bear the original seal and signature of the official in charge of records at that institution. An electronic official transcript must be transmitted directly between institutions using the electronic transcript service authorized by the issuing institution and acceptable to the receiving institution. A transcript delivered by the student or issued to the student is not official. Official transcripts must be received by the USD Knudson School of Law by October 15 of the student’s first semester of matriculation at the USD Knudson School of Law. If the official transcript is not received by that date, the student will be administratively withdrawn."
