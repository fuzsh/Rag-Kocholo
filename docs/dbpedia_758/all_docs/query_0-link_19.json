Tuition\n\nTuition for the Master of Legal Studies (MLS), the Master of Legal Studies in Taxation (Tax MLS), the Master of Laws in Taxation (Tax LLM), and the Master of Laws in U.S. Laws (LL.M. in U.S. Laws) programs for the 2024-2025 academic year is US $2,917 per credit. There are 24 credits required to complete each program, and total tuition cost for each degree is US $70,008. This total tuition cost is not due upfront. Tuition payments are broken down by term. Students are only responsible for paying for the courses in which they are enrolled for the term. Please note that tuition costs are subject to change at the discretion of the university.

We encourage candidates to apply for financial aid as early as possible.\n\nYou must be registered for a minimum number of credits in order to qualify for financial aid on a term basis. Students who choose to take a less accelerated path toward completion of the degree should be aware that this will impact federal financial aid eligibility.\n\nHow to Apply for Financial Aid\n\nIf you plan to apply for financial aid to help fund your online studies at Washington University in St. Louis, you will need to complete the following steps, or download the WashULaw Federal Student Aid Checklist (PDF, 120KB).\n\nComplete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) online. Include the Washington University in St. Louis school code, which is 002520. The FAFSA must be completed each academic year in order to remain eligible for federal student aid.\n\nSign your FAFSA application electronically using your Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID. The U.S. Department of Education recently replaced the federal PIN with a new login system. You will be asked to create a new FSA ID when logging in.\n\nApplying for PLUS Loans\n\nEvaluate your need for additional funding through sources such as a Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan from the Department of Education or alternative loans from various private lenders.\n\nPrior to borrowing through the Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan Program, or any additional private/alternative loan, you may need to review credit reports for potential issues. Contact any of the following credit bureaus for information: Experian, Equifax or TransUnion.\n\nTo apply for the Direct Graduate PLUS Loan, complete the credit application PLUS loan request online.\n\nWhen You Are Admitted\n\nUpon admission to a Washington University in St. Louis program and successful completion of both the federal requirements and the WashULaw Supplemental Form, you will receive an award letter via email from a Washington University financial aid representative.\n\nFor your loan to be officially disbursed, you must sign your award letter and return it to Carrie Burns Director of Financial Aid and Student Life at cjburns@wustl.edu.\n\nAfter signing your award letter for a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, complete the Entrance Counseling and electronically sign the Master Promissory Note (MPN) online.\n\nIf approved for the Direct Graduate PLUS Loan, complete a separate MPN for this loan.\n\nIf declined for the Direct Graduate PLUS Loan, you can reapply with a co-signer (endorser) or appeal the denial through the Department of Education.\n\nScholarships\n\nScholarships are available to admitted students. Availability of scholarships as well as amount awarded may vary based on cohort and program of choice. To learn more about available scholarships contact your admissions counselor.\n\nAid for International Applicants\n\nInternational candidates should explore funding options in their home countries. While some companies may not advertise that financial support is available, many employers offer tuition benefits, including tuition reimbursement and low-cost loans. Candidates should schedule a conversation with their employer to discuss their professional development goals. Based on each candidateâ€™s country of residence, they may also have access to education loans through private lenders."
