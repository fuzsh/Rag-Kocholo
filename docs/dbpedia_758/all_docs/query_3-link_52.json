All Family Law Certificate candidates should register for the TWEN site to receive up-to-date information.\n\nIV. COURSE, ACTIVITY, AND GRADE REQUIREMENTS\n\nA. General Curricular Requirements\n\nEach Family Law Certificate candidate must satisfy all of the following requirements:\n\nComplete at least twenty-one (21) credit hours of approved Family Law and related courses (courses in which a significant amount of class time is devoted to discussion of family law issues). This is a minimum credit requirement. To demonstrate a genuine interest in Family Law and to receive a thorough indoctrination in this subject area, candidates are urged to enroll in as many Family Law courses as possible. In addition, for Bar preparation, candidates are advised to select as many Bar courses from the list of approved courses as possible.\n\nComplete at least one approved seminar that requires writing a substantive paper (one that satisfies HUSL’s Legal Writing III requirements) on a Family Law topic. Candidates may write their paper on a traditional Family Law topic, but are also encouraged to write interdisciplinary papers on Family Law issues that may arise in a variety of disciplines. Candidates may use the Note or Comment that they write for a law review or law journal at HUSL to satisfy this requirement.\n\nComplete a legal internship or externship to gain practical experience in Family Law and for resume enhancement. A qualified externship or internship will last for at least one semester during an academic term or at least eight weeks during the summer and involve substantial assignments in Family Law. Externships and internships must comply with all other requirements set forth in the HUSL Student Handbook. Suggested externship and internship opportunities will be available to candidates. Candidates are strongly encouraged but not required to receive course credit for the externship or internship.\n\nB. Approved Courses\n\nThe following list of approved courses is not exhaustive. It contains Family Law and approved related courses that are offered on a regular basis. The list of courses will evolve as new courses are offered at HUSL, faculty and administrative changes occur, and student needs change.\n\n6. Additional Course Offerings:\n\nThe Family Law Certificate Program is self-contained. Ample electives that candidates may select for completion of the requirements within a three-year period are offered. As the HUSL curriculum develops, additional courses may be approved for satisfaction of the requirements. Any additional courses or consortium courses (those offered at pre-approved law schools) must be pre-approved by the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the Program Director.\n\n[1] General Externship, Advanced Externship, or Judicial Externship.\n\nV. COMMUNITY SERVICE REQUIREMENT\n\nCandidates must complete a total of fifteen (15) hours of community service during their three years of study at HUSL. Candidates may choose any community service project that supports families or communities. Service in the legal field is preferred but not required. For these purposes, documented community service will be construed broadly.\n\nThis service may be performed in the Washington metropolitan area or anywhere in the United States or in an approved study abroad program.\n\nVI. PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAM AND FAMILY-LAW RELATED EVENTS\n\nCandidates must participate in a minimum number of Family Law Certificate Program and/or Family-Law related events each academic year, as determined by the Program Director. The minimum number of events is 2 (two) per academic year(s) in which the student is enrolled in the Family Law Certificate Program. Events are offered as part of the Family Law Certificate Program. Further, students are encouraged to attend other family-law related events (e.g., workshops, panels, legal trainings) outside of HUSL that could also count towards the minimum participation requirement. Students who are uncertain about whether an event will satisfy the minimum participation requirement should meet and discuss with the Program Director prior to participating.\n\nVII. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS\n\nCandidates must submit the Family Law Certificate Program Application to the Program Director to report that they have fulfilled all requirements. To ensure that they will qualify for a Family Law Certificate upon graduation, third-year candidates should meet with the Program Director at least once as early as possible during the semester that precedes their intended semester of graduation. The following items must accompany the Certificate Application:\n\nA Family Law Certificate Program checklist (found on TWEN);\n\nA certified transcript;\n\nThe Legal Writing III paper that satisfies HUSL and Family Law Certificate Program requirements;\n\nA Completed Externship/Internship Report Form that is signed by the supervising judge or attorney or the School of Law’s Director of Experiential Learning;\n\nA Community Service Report Form that is signed by the supervisor; and,\n\nA Family Law Certificate Program Exit Survey.\n\nPreliminary approval of a Family Law Program Certificate application will be made when the candidate submits the completed packet of graduation documents to the Program Director by the posted deadline. The Program Director will review the documents and preliminarily certify the candidate for a Family Law Certificate. Final approval must be made by the Records Office and the HUSL Faculty.\n\nVIII. PROFICIENCY EXAMINATIONS\n\nare not required for this Family Law Certificate Program.\n\nIX. OTHER EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND PRACTICAL TRAINING\n\nTrainings are typically offered throughout the year. Legal and interdisciplinary projects and educational lectures are offered on campus and off campus. Candidates are encouraged to attend as many of the programs and lectures as possible.\n\nX. GENERAL ACADEMIC POLICIES\n\nA. Enrollment in Required Courses at HUSL. Unless a candidate transfers from another law school, the candidate must take all required courses at HUSL. Transfer students (students who transfer from another accredited law school to HUSL) who provide documented proof of satisfactory completion of comparable listed courses may apply for a Family Law Certificate if they meet all other qualifications. Such students are encouraged to seek advice from the Program Director regarding their eligibility as soon as possible after enrollment.\n\nB. Identifying Approved Courses. Students who are uncertain about whether a course (including seminars) will be approved should meet with the Program Director prior to enrolling in the course.\n\nC. Grades. Candidates must earn a grade of at least an 80 in the Family Law survey course and at least a 75 in all other courses that are used to meet Family Law Certificate Program requirements.\n\nD. Time for Completion of Requirements. Certificate requirements must be completed before the candidate is graduated from HUSL. At its regular faculty meeting for certifying that HUSL students are qualified for graduation with input from the Records Office and the Program Director, the HUSL faculty will certify that each candidate qualifies for a Family Law Certificate.\n\nCERTIFICATE PROGRAM CONTACT INFORMATION:\n\nProfessor Mariela Olivares\n\nProgram Director\n\nHoward Family Law Certificate Program\n\nHoward University School of Law\n\n2900 Van Ness Street, N.W.,\n\nWashington, D.C. 20008\n\nPhone: (202) 806-8003\n\nE-mail: molivares@law.howard.edu\n\nDonations may be made electronically (click on Gift Designation and Choose Family Law Certificate Program)\n\nor by mail addressed to the Program Director at the above address.\n\nOur Legal Reasoning, Research, and Writing Program (LRRW) is one of the school’s greatest academic strengths. Students report that they are well prepared for their research, writing and oral communication responsibilities in a variety of legislative, judicial, and practice settings. In addition, the program has developed a national reputation among LRRW teaching professionals as one of the best in the country. One key to the success of the program is having high-quality, full-time LRRW faculty members. Another key is having a total of six credits over three semesters allocated to the program. The most important key to the success of the program continues to be the effort that our students put into it.\n\nLegal Reasoning, Research, and Writing\n\nThe centerpiece of the law school’s legal writing program is Legal Reasoning, Research, and Writing I (LRRW), a four-credit, year-long course taught during the first year. LRRW I introduces students to the fundamentals of legal reasoning, to the basic sources and processes of legal research, and to some basic forms of legal writing, including objective memoranda of law, client opinion letters, and trial court motion practice briefs. The reasoning skills taught include rule-based or syllogistic reasoning, analogical reasoning, case analysis, factual analysis, synthesizing and distinguishing cases, the use of policy in the law, and principles of statutory construction. The full range of legal research skills is introduced, including both hard-copy research skills and computer- assisted legal research skills in primary and secondary materials. Students are also taught oral advocacy skills.\n\nLegal Writing II\n\nThe second legal writing course, Legal Writing II (LRRW II), is a two-credit, semester-long course taken either in the fall or spring of the second year. LRRW II focuses on appellate advocacy and serves to reinforce the skills learned in the LRRW I course.\n\nLegal Writing III, Scholarly Writing Requirement\n\nA scholarly writing requirement is integral to the third part of the LRRW Program. While LRRW and LRRW II focus primarily on practice-oriented aspects of legal reasoning, research, and writing, the LRRW III requirement focuses on scholarly legal writing. LRRW III is not a particular course. Instead, it is a significant scholarly writing assignment supervised by a full-time faculty member. Each student enrolled in LRRW III is required to complete in-depth research in a specialized area wherein the issues involved are fully analyzed, and in which supportable conclusions are articulated.\n\nStudents also benefit from Scholarly Writing Workshops held in the spring and fall semesters. The goal of the Scholarly Writing Workshops is to provide a blueprint for students who are working on their LRRW III papers and scholarly articles, and to encourage students to participate in the myriad of writing competitions available. Through the workshops, students learn how to 1) choose a topic, 2) do a preemption check, 3) outline their article/paper, 4) conduct research, 5) write the article or paper, and 6) use the correct legal citation form.\n\nThe Legal Writing Center\n\nHoward University School of Law’s newest component to the Legal Reasoning, Research, and Writing Program\n\nAdditional assistance is available for students to improve their writing and research skills through the Legal Writing Center. The Center’s key purpose is to identify and fix structural and grammatical problems in student papers and research projects. The Legal Writing Center offers one-on-one conferences and tutorial assistance and group writing conferences to all Howard law students at any stage of the writing process.\n\nConveniently located in the Law Library, the Legal Writing Center is supported by the legal writing professors and staffed by Dean’s Fellows and peer tutors who keep flexible hours to meet student demand."
