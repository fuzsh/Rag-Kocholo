        "text": "Description:\n\nThe First Amendment Clinic at Washington University School of Law seeks a full-time Legal Fellow for a two-year term.\n\nThe First Amendment Clinic’s mission is to defend and advance the rights of free speech, press, assembly, and petition through regional litigation and advocacy, while providing law students with the practice and real-world experience to become leaders on First Amendment issues. The Clinic takes on a wide array of cases and controversies, including defense against libel claims and newsgathering torts, access to courts, and defending the rights of journalists, artists, protestors, and others who have been censored by the government. The Clinic and the legal fellow position are supported by the Stanton Foundation.\n\nUnder the direction of the Clinic’s Director, the Fellow will be expected to: (1) engage in substantial legal work including direct client representation encompassing intake/case evaluation, drafting and filing pleadings, taking discovery, motion practice, and court appearances; and (2) help supervise law students by providing feedback on their written work, client interaction, and oral advocacy. The Fellow will also assist with coalition building and managing referral relationships with public interest organizations, law firms, journalists, and other stakeholders committed to protecting expressive freedoms.\n\nQualifications:\n\nCandidates must possess a J.D. degree from an ABA-accredited law school and must be admitted or eligible to practice law in Missouri (i.e., must be a member of the Missouri bar, able to become a member within six months of starting the position or eligible for a certificate to supervise students as a law teacher pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 13.06). Candidates should possess a strong academic record; excellent written and oral communication skills; strong organizational and time-management skills; an ability to build and maintain relationships with both students and community/professional partners; and an interest in First Amendment law. Preference will be given to candidates who have at least two years of litigation or clerkship experience.\n\nApplication:\n\nInterested applicants can view the job posting here.\n\nThe start date for this position is negotiable, but should be no earlier than February 1, 2021, and no later than July 1, 2021.\n\nFor fullest consideration, apply by December 30, 2020.\n\nApplicants should submit a cover letter (briefly describing the candidate’s interest and qualifications), resume, and at least two references to Lisa Hoppenjans, Director, First Amendment Clinic, at lhoppenjans@wustl.edu.
