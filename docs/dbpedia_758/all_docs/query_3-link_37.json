        "text": "James Headley, Advisor\n\nPatterson Hall 233\n\nProgram Description\n\nEntrance into law school does not depend on the completion of any particular set of undergraduate requirements, but rather on the attainment of a bachelorâ€™s degree in a recognized field of study, a sufficient GPA, and a satisfactory score on the Law School Admission Test. Any bachelor's degree program can work to prepare one for law school, but social sciences are particularly useful for preparation for law school. A balanced preparation for the study of law should include exposure to the traditional liberal arts disciplines and the development of skills in verbal and written communication and in logical thinking.\n\nSince many students interested in law combine that interest with a similar one in public affairs, the Department of Political Science and Public Policy offers a special option major designed especially to meet the needs of pre-law students.\n\nEastern Washington University offers students the opportunity to earn substantial amounts of coursework toward the requirements of a number of specific professions.\n\nAlthough the following Pre-Professional programs have been offered for several years by EWU, this listing is not exclusive; students who are interested in a profession not represented (below) are encouraged to contact the Center for Academic Advising & Retention (CAAR) for assistance in identifying departments or programs which can offer coursework and advice as regards alternative Pre-Professional studies."
