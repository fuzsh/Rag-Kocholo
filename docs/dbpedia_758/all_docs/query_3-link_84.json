Then the person is walking on campus with friends, greeting other people as the person walks by with smiles on their face. Entering into a building lobby, there are other people standing around signing about Gallaudet University. Then, it fades out to two people waiting for a drink at Starbucks lobby in a building. Switches out to a classroom and study area where groups of students are at a table learning and collaborating, giving each other high fives. Slides from the cafeteria showing people sitting at a table with smiles on their faces, eating to outside showing people playing disc golf. Then shows people gathering around in a dorm room playing cards and laughing. The same person from the beginning is shown laying down on a bed. Then the same person is shown waking up with arms and head on the table, rubbing eyes. As the person wakes up, they open laptop with words “Dream Bold, Thrive Here” showing on screen. The words “we are here for it” appear next, then the pink call to action button “apply” is shown."
