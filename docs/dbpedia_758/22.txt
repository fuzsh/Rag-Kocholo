The University of Queensland’s School of Law in cooperation with the Washington University (WU) School of Law in St Louis, Missouri, offers current UQ students a unique opportunity to complete their UQ law degree and an American LLM degree in a reduced time frame. WU students may combine their JD degree with an LLM at UQ.

This joint initiative enables law students to undertake formal study in two jurisdictions and add a postgraduate qualification to their first law degree. The LLM in US Law also permits WU law graduates to sit for several States’ bar examinations, including the New York State Bar Exam.

The agreement enables UQ students to complete the final four electives in their UQ LLB(Hons) degree at WU while simultaneously completing an LLM degree over two semesters at WU. On successful completion of the first semester of study, students will be eligible for #8 elective LAWS credit towards the finalisation of their LLB(Hons) program. At the end of the second semester of study students who have successfully completed all requirements will be eligible to graduate from the LLM at WU.

During the first semester at WU, UQ students will pay the academic fees to UQ (at the applicable UQ rates). During the second semester at WU (and any subsequent semesters), UQ students will pay the appropriate tuition fees to WU as the host institution.

This program is open to current single and dual degree law students at UQ. Six places are available each year.
