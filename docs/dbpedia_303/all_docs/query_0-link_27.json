        "text": "The protagonists of Jack London’s White Fang and Andy Weir’s The Martian both face a potentially fatal situation in their respective novels. White Fang follows the story of a man being hunted by wolves across the tundra of Northern Canada, while The Martian is about an American astronaut called Mark Watney who is accidently left behind on the deserted planet of Mars during a mission evacuation.
