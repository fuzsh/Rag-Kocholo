Get your FREE printable list of must-have read alouds! This list is also perfect for kids looking for exciting books to read on their own. Enjoy!\n\nMost parents read books out loud to their kids when they’re young. But did you know it’s important to continue reading to our kids even when they’re able to read on their own?\n\nFor the past several years, I have read books out loud to my boys at the beginning of each school day. I’ve been doing this ever since I felt encouraged to do so by hearing talks by Andrew Pudewa of Institute for Excellence in Writing and Sally Clarkson of Whole Heart Ministries.\n\nWhat are Read Aloud Books?\n\nReading books out loud will take your family on a magical journey. Even after our kids are able to read on their own, we should continue to read books out loud to them.\n\nTry to read books to them which are just a little bit above the level which they can comfortably read on their own. These books are an excellent source of reliably correct and sophisticated language patterns.\n\nHearing the English language in this way will help our kids to increase their vocabulary and to recognize proper English when they hear it!\n\nIt’s also important to read books to our kids that they will just plain enjoy hearing. Books with action. Books that hold their interest. Books that will keep our kids begging for more!\n\nWe want our kids to discover how exciting it can be to get lost inside a book and one of the best ways to do this is to let them sit back and listen while we take them on a journey. Reading can and should be something our kids look forward to doing. And books read aloud are a great way to do this!\n\nHow to Approach Read Aloud Books\n\nWhen reading books out loud to our kids, it’s important to use lots of expression in our voices. Don’t be afraid to raise or lower your voice to help set the mood. If a character yells out some dialog, you should holler as well. Keep kids interested in what’s going on by varying the level of your voice.\n\nWe want kids to feel that they are entering the story, so a good read aloud experience will be one where our kids are sitting on the edge of their seat waiting to hear what happens next.\n\nIt can take a bit of practice for our kids to develop their listening skills enough to remain focused on the story. So, the more we’re able to act things out with our voices, the easier it will be for them to remain engaged.\n\nSome of the read-aloud books below are our family favorites. Some of them are favorites recommended by my readers. I hope that this guide will help you find just the right read out loud books for your kids!
