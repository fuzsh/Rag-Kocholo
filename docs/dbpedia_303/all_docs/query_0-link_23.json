        "text": "The Art of Racing in the Rain\n\nBy Garth Stein,\n\nFrom my list on adventure books that will make you forget reality.\n\nBy Eve Gaal Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a survivor. Whether flaming engines on a plane, a hurricane, or breast cancer, I have made many unusual journeys. The way I see it, I am also a writer, and God keeps giving me material for my adventure novels. Of course, I’m also a reader and could fill this page with more than five recommendations. Hopefully, you’ll want to read one of these awesome books. I guarantee they will make you escape reality.\n\nEve's book list on adventure books that will make you forget reality\n\nWhy did Eve love this book?\n\nThis book is so much better than the movie!\n\nI love it because it’s a story about a dog. In fact, the story is told from the dog’s point of view, which, of course, grabbed my attention immediately. I mean, if the dog is going to tell a story, I’m going to listen. Loved it!\n\nBy Garth Stein,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n14 authors picked The Art of Racing in the Rain as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSoon to be a major motion picture, this heart-warming and inspirational tale follows Enzo, a loyal family dog, tells the story of his human family, how they nearly fell apart, and what he did to bring them back together.\n\nEnzo knows he is different from other dogs: he thinks and feels in nearly human ways.

Through Denny, Enzo realizes that racing is a metaphor: that by applying the techniques a driver would apply on…\n\nPreview\n\nLassie Come-Home\n\nBy Eric Knight, Marguerite Kirmse (illustrator),\n\nFrom my list on making you fall in love with dogs all over again.\n\nBy Jennifer Marshall Bleakley Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a painfully shy child, I found friendship and ultimately my own voice reading about, and spending time with, animals—especially dogs. Dogs didn’t judge, didn’t expect anything from me, and I never had to worry about what to say to them. They gave me the gift of their presence and time to practice communication—gifts that ultimately led me to obtain a master’s degree in counseling and work as a children’s grief counselor. Thankfully I overcame my extreme shyness. And there is no denying the role that dogs—and books about dogs—have played in my life. I hope this list helps you find that same comfort and inspiration.\n\nJennifer's book list on making you fall in love with dogs all over again\n\nWhy did Jennifer love this book?\n\nAlthough it’s technically considered a children’s book, Lassie Come-Home is one of those special stories that crosses generations, cultures, and time periods.\n\nAs a child desperate for a dog, I loved imagining I had a dog as devoted as Lassie—and one as willing to traverse all manner of obstacles to come and find me should we ever become separated!\n\nAs an adult, I was struck by how much Lassie endured to find her way back to Joe, and how, even when presented with a comfortable life somewhere else, she chose to keep moving forward—back to the boy who held her heart.\n\nBy Eric Knight, Marguerite Kirmse (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n5 authors picked Lassie Come-Home as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

I’d kept a little Yorkshire terrier hidden in my Cambridge rooms for two years before he was discovered and he’d been lovely company as I plugged away at my reading there. I'm pretty confident that I'm the only student who has ever kept a dog at Trinity College. Because of the impact Lassie made on me as a child, I’ve always longed for a collie and now have space for one. He’s called Cedric and is as human and sentient as I. The first book I wrote was about a dog with the loyalty of all the dogs in the world, and with the love of all the dogs in the world.\n\nSam's book list on the bond between a dog and his human\n\nWhy did Sam love this book?\n\nThis made an enormous impression on me.

Whenever I come across any highland terrier on any street anywhere, I remember little Bobby sleeping for fourteen cold long years beside the grave of Auld Jock and I see all the great love that a dog can have for his human.

My ears were so big that someone once said I didn’t need an alarm clock because I could hear the sun coming up. On top of that, I was also very average at everything I tried. However, I found that being funny made people like me. I also realized that, as long as God loved me and had a plan for me, I could be a superhero despite being average at everything. So when Focus on the Family asked me to start writing, I knew exactly what I’d write about…me! Average Boy!\n\nBob's book list on growing up\n\nWhy did Bob love this book?\n\nThis book is a classic.

Then I wound up living with two more German shepherds with similar challenges. Our current dog, Bailey, was undersocialized before we met her, but our past experience showed us how to help her live her best life anyway. My dogs have enriched my life so much that my favorite books are about the ways they save us as much as we save them.\n\nKari's book list on dogs who rescue us as much as we rescue them\n\nWhy did Kari love this book?\n\nSpeaking of wolves, this book describes how wolves and wolfdogs can be safely contained and cared for. Author Nicole Wilde ran Villalobos Rescue Center back when it was a wolf rescue, and is also a specialist in domestic dog behavior. In this book, she opens up about the struggles she had with some of her own dogs. It’s very reassuring to read about experts having the same problems we do. Not only does Wilde describe the animals vividly in prose, but her photographs also are stunning. It bums me out when photos in dog books are grainy and black and white, or worse, when there are no photos at all. I want to see the dogs!\n\nBy Nicole Wilde,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Hit by a Flying Wolf as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWinner 2015 Silver Award Benjamin Franklin Awards!

For my last book, I wanted to write about animals as individuals—not just as units in a species, the way they are often thought of by conservationists. Diving into research about animal selfhood was an amazing journey. It helped shape my book, but it also changed the way I see the world around me—and who and what I think of as “people”!\n\nEmma's book list on what it is like to be a wild animal\n\nWhy did Emma love this book?\n\nIn some ways, this book is the “reality check” that I needed after reading Born Free.\n\nCeiridwen Terrill tells the story of why she decided to raise a wolf-dog hybrid—and why the experience was ultimately a tragedy for both Terrill and Inyo, her pet.\n\nWriting about the experience was extremely brave, especially because it ended so sadly—but Terrill’s candor and vulnerability as she explains why she made the choices she did completely gripped me, and her writing is so vivid, I felt like I was right there with Inyo, struggling to fit in as an animal who was neither a cuddly domestic dog nor a self-sufficient wild animal.\n\nBy Ceiridwen Terrill,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Part Wild as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPart Wild is the unforgettable story of Ceiridwen Terrill's journey with a creature whose heart is divided between her bond to one woman and her need to roam free. When Terrill adopts a wolfdog- part husky, part gray wolf-named Inyo to be her protector and fellow traveler, she is drawn to Inyo's spark of wildness; compelled by the great responsibility, even danger, that accompanies the allure of the wild; and transformed by the extraordinary love she shares with Inyo, who teaches Terrill how to carve out a place for herself in the world.\n\nOver almost four years, Terrill and Inyo's…\n\nPreview\n\nTrouper\n\nBy Meg Kearney, E.B. Lewis (illustrator),\n\nFrom my list on children’s books about kindness and friendship.\n\nBy Cheryl Lawton Malone Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFairy tales were my first love but I didn’t discover the true magic of children’s picture books until I left my 25-year career as an attorney to enter an MFA program. Wow, was I amazed. Picture books—books in which pictures tell an integral part of the story—not only create an instant connection between reader and little listener but stay with us into adulthood as memories. With this insight, I dove into the genre to discover what distinguishes picture books that are read and reread from those that fade. The answer turns out to be—tales that engender awe and wonder, yarns with heart, and narratives about friendship and kindness. Those are the stories that stay with us forever.\n\nCheryl's book list on children’s books about kindness and friendship\n\nWhy did Cheryl love this book?\n\nAuthor Meg Kearney and Caldecott Honor Book artist E.B. Lewis join together to create the enchanting story of a three-legged street mutt who longs to find his forever home. After his canine mob is napped by animal control, Trouper watches each of his pals get adopted. Alone in his crate, he wonders if anyone will ever want him. Of course—with perfect pacing—the right boy comes along at the right time and oh my goodness, do we cheer. In a charming approach, Trouper is told from the dog’s POV. This book oozes with heart and humor and is a sure re-read for anyone who loves an underdog.\n\nBy Meg Kearney, E.B. Lewis (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Trouper as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA moving story of a three-legged stray dog who finds a loving boy to call his own--illustrated by Caldecott Honor Book artist E.B. Lewis. Based on a true story.\n\nTrouper ran with a mob of mutts who tripped over trash cans and pawed the cold streets for bones. They howled and cried and wished for a home. Until one day, the dogs are captured from off the streets and put in cages in a shelter as they wait to be adopted. Trouper watches sadly as, one by one, each of his dog friends are chosen. He's the only one left…\n\nPreview\n\nHis Dog\n\nBy Albert Payson Terhune,\n\nWhy did Tabitha love this book?\n\nI’m a sucker for a book where a struggling person turns his life around, and His Dog is a wonderful example. A bitter, failed man, run to seed and given up to drink and bad ways, takes in a stray dog, and we see the gradual transformation of his life in response to the dog’s pure goodwill. It’s a charming book, and as it goes on, and terrible risks are encountered and overcome, it is in emotional terms one of the most exciting books I’ve read. Originally published in 1922, the book deals with subjects that don’t change over time, so it remains as relevant today as when it was first written. A beautiful and heart-warming book.\n\nBy Albert Payson Terhune,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked His Dog as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis book was converted from its physical edition to the digital format by a community of volunteers. You may find it for free on the web. Purchase of the Kindle edition includes wireless delivery.\n\nPreview\n\nDog Boy\n\nBy Eva Hornung,\n\nWhy did Tabitha love this book?\n\nOf all my picks, this one is the most startling read, I think. It follows the life of a very small boy, left for some reason abandoned, who takes refuge with a stray bitch and her litter, and consequently grows up as a dog.\n\nThis, too, is very much a tragedy; although he lives as a dog, and everything he knows is of being a dog, yet the boy is not a dog and cannot remain one, and his own complete failure to understand his circumstances when he is rescued results in one of the most heartbreaking endings to any book I have ever read.\n\nIt’s a strange and beautiful experience, reading this book, and although yes, it will break you, it gives a rare insight into how it can be for anyone brought up outside his proper culture.\n\nBy Eva Hornung,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Dog Boy as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA vivid, riveting novel about an abandoned boy who takes up with a pack of feral dogs\n\nTwo million children roam the streets in late twentieth-century Moscow. A four-year-old boy named Romochka, abandoned by his mother and uncle, is left to fend for himself. Curious, he follows a stray dog to its home in an abandoned church cellar on the city's outskirts. Romochka makes himself at home with Mamochka, the mother of the pack, and six other dogs as he slowly abandons his human attributes to survive two fiercely cold winters. Able to pass as either boy or dog, Romochka…\n\nPreview"
