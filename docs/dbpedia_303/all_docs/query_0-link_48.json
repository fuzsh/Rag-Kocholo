        "text": "Conservative parents have swarmed school board meetings in Texas and across the country in recent months to call for the removal of library books that deal with race, racism, sex, gender and sexuality. Some parents have taken it a step further, filling out paperwork to formally challenge the appropriateness of library books and forcing school administrators to review them.\n\nRead more: Books on race and sexuality are disappearing from Texas schools in record numbers\n\nNBC News sent public records requests to nearly 100 school districts in the Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin regions — a small sampling of the state’s 1,250 public school systems — and found 86 formal requests to remove books from libraries last year, the vast majority coming during the final four months of the year. Several titles were targeted in multiple districts.\n\nDrawing from those records, below is a list of 50 books that Texas parents tried to ban in 2021.\n\n1. \"Drama,\" by Raina Telgemeier\n\nA parent asked administrators at the Spring Branch Independent School District in Houston to pull this graphic novel, which features gay and bisexual characters, because she claimed it might lead young students \"to question their sexual orientation when they don't even comprehend what that means.\"\n\n2. \"When Wilma Rudolph Played Basketball,\" by Mark Weakland\n\nA parent in Prosper, a Dallas suburb, said this illustrated children's book, which touches on the racism that Olympian Wilma Rudolph experienced growing up in Tennessee in the 1940s, should be removed from school libraries because \"it opines prejudice based on race.\"\n\n3. \"Lawn Boy,\" by Jonathan Evison\n\nA parent in Plano said this coming-of-age novel about a Mexican American character's journey to understanding his own sexuality and ethnic identity should be banned because it contains \"profanity, pornography, gambling, homosexuality.\" The parent claimed the book encourages \"admiring people with low morals and values, and hate of other people.\"\n\n4. \"Better Nate Than Ever,\" by Tim Federle\n\nA parent in Leander, an Austin suburb, asked for this book, which features a subplot about a teenager who’s starting to notice his attraction to other boys, to be removed because the parent didn't believe \"books should discuss sensitive/controversial topics such as gender, sexuality.\"\n\n5. \"Five, Six, Seven, Nate!\" by Tim Federle\n\nA Leander parent suggested replacing children's books that mention gender identity or sexuality, including this one, with \"classics,\" such as \"White Fang,\" \"The Indian in the Cupboard,\" \"The Swiss Family Robinson\" and Shakespeare.\n\n6. \"The Bluest Eye,\" by Toni Morrison\n\nThis classic novel by the Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison should be banned from schools, according to a parent in the Fort Worth suburb of Birdville, because it includes a graphic description of rape.\n\n7. \"Out of Darkness,\" by Ashley Hope Pérez\n\nThis novel, about a 1930s East Texas romance between a Mexican American girl and a Black boy, isn't suitable for teens, a Birdville parent wrote, because \"it depicts a graphic sexual experience between minors.\"\n\n8. \"Ghost Boys,\" by Jewell Parker Rhodes\n\nAccording to a Houston parent, reading this novel about a Black boy killed by police might cause white children who attend the Spring Branch Independent School District to “feel ashamed based on color of their skin.”\n\n9. \"l8r, g8r,\" by Lauren Myracle\n\nTold entirely through instant messages among three high school students, this novel has no place in schools, according to a parent in the Dallas suburb of McKinney, because it contains a \"description of oral sex with minors,\" among other sexually explicit passages.\n\n10. \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,\" by Jesse Andrews\n\nA parent in the Houston suburb of Katy wrote that this book, which chronicles the relationship between a teen boy and a girl with leukemia, includes \"obscene language\" and could lead students to \"become over sexualized and objectified.\"\n\n11. \"White Bird: A Wonder Story,\" by R.J. Palacio\n\nA parent in the Spring Branch ISD said this graphic novel — about a Jewish teen living in France after Nazis seized power — should be banned because it's \"biased\" and could lead to the \"skewing of a young child's mind.\"\n\n12. \"Ground Zero: A Novel of 9/11,\" by Alan Gratz\n\nA parent in Prosper said this novel, which tells the story of 9/11 and its aftermath from the dueling perspectives of an American boy and an Afghan girl, should be removed from schools because it \"depicts American soldiers as callous, evil and terrorists\" and because the author mentions the racial or ethnic identities of every character.\n\n13. \"Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic,\" by Alison Bechdel\n\nThis illustrated memoir, which recounts the author’s coming of age as a lesbian, is unsuitable for schools, according to a parent in Birdville, because it includes graphic descriptions of sexual violence.\n\n14. \"Jack of Hearts (and Other Parts)\" by L.C. Rosen\n\nA Katy mom asked administrators to remove this book, about a 17-year-old gay student who has a lot of sex and isn’t ashamed of it, after reading explicit passages aloud at a school board meeting: “We cannot unread this type of content,\" she said, \"and I would like to protect my kids’ hearts and minds from this.”\n\n15. \"City of Thieves,\" by David Benioff\n\nA parent in San Antonio asked the Northside Independent School District to ban this work historical fiction, set during the Nazis’ siege of Leningrad, because it includes “pornographic imagery” that is \"not suited for the majority\" of readers, the parent wrote, adding, \"... unless you're into that.\"\n\n16. \"Gender Queer,\" by Maia Kobabe\n\nThis illustrated memoir by a nonbinary author, which includes sexually explicit cartoon images, triggered attempted bans — and even threats of criminal charges — in several Texas school districts.\n\n17. \"This One Summer,\" by Mariko Tamaki\n\nA Birdville mom wanted this book, a graphic novel featuring LGBTQ characters, removed from libraries because, she said, it \"has a recurring theme of oral sex.\"\n\n18. \"We Are the Ants,\" by Shaun David Hutchinson\n\nThis coming-of-age novel about a gay teenager came under fire in Birdville when a parent complained that it has explicit descriptions of \"masterbation and genitalia.\"\n\n19. \"The Breakaways,\" by Cathy G. Johnson\n\nParents in Keller and Spring Branch complained that this graphic novel, which features a transgender character, should be off-limits for young students because it includes images of children kissing in bed.\n\n20. \"All Boys Aren't Blue,\" by George M. Johnson\n\nThis memoir by a queer Black author was flagged for removal by a group of Katy parents because it includes descriptions of molestation and sex between men.\n\n21. \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\" by Stephen Chbosky\n\nA parent in McKinney asked the district to remove this coming-of-age novel because it includes descriptions of homosexuality, date rape and masturbation.\n\n22. \"Michelle Obama: Political Icon,\" by Heather E. Schwartz\n\nA Katy parent asked to have this children's biography of the former first lady banned at every grade level because, the parent said, it unfairly depicts former President Donald Trump as a bully and because Obama's reflections on race gave the impression that \"if you sound like a white girl you should be ashamed of yourself.\"\n\n23. \"Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You,\" by Jason Reynolds and Ibram X. Kendi\n\nThis young adult adaptation of \"Stamped From the Beginning,\" Kendi's National Book Award-winning historical examination of racism, was flagged for removal by a parent in Katy, who wrote that the children's book \"is littered with completely fabricated and conspiracy theory views on history\" that make it seem as if \"all historical events of the past were a result of racism.\"\n\n24. \"New Kid,\" by Jerry Craft\n\nA Katy mom asked to ban this graphic novel about a Black seventh grader at a mostly white school. She claimed that, because it includes references to microaggressions, the book is \"about critical race theory, which is forbidden by Texas law.\"\n\n25. \"Class Act,\" by Jerry Craft\n\nA Katy mom said this graphic novel, the second in a series, should be removed from schools because it will make white children feel guilty and \"kids will be brainwashed that one race is superior than the other.\"\n\n26. \"Salvage the Bones,\" by Jesmyn Ward\n\nIn asking to ban this book about the plight of a Black working-class family as they prepare for Hurricane Katrina, a parent in Katy wrote, \"I object to the explicit description of the teenage girl having sex with the boys in her social group.\"\n\n27. \"Woke: A Young Poet's Call to Justice,\" by Mahogany L.
