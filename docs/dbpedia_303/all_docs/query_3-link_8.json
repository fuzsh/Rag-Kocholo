There were three of them, three boys, in as many bright-colored sweaters, and they scorched along the cycle-path as dangerously near the speed-limit as is the custom of boys in bright-colored sweaters to go. They may have exceeded the speed-limit. A mounted park policeman thought so, but was not sure, and contented himself with cautioning them as they flashed by. They acknowledged the warning promptly, and on the next turn of the path as promptly forgot it, which is also a custom of boys in bright-colored sweaters.\n\nShooting out through the entrance to Golden Gate Park, they turned into San Francisco, and took the long sweep of the descending hills at a rate that caused pedestrians to turn and watch them anxiously. Through the city streets the bright sweaters flew, turning and twisting to escape climbing the steeper hills, and, when the steep hills were unavoidable, doing stunts to see which would first gain the top.\n\nThe boy who more often hit up the pace, led the scorching, and instituted the stunts was called Joe by his companions. It was follow the leader, and he led, the merriest and boldest in the bunch. But as they pedaled into the Western Addition, among the large and comfortable residences, his laughter became less loud and frequent, and he unconsciously lagged in the rear. At Laguna and Vallejo streets his companions turned off to the right.\n\nSo long, Fred, he called as he turned his wheel to the left. So long, Charley.\n\nSee you to-night! they called back.\n\nNo—I can't come, he answered.\n\nAw, come on, they begged.\n\nNo, I've got to dig.—So long!\n\nAs he went on alone, his face grew grave and a vague worry came into his eyes. He began resolutely to whistle, but this dwindled away till it was a thin and very subdued little sound, which ceased altogether as he rode up the driveway to a large two-storied house.\n\nOh, Joe!\n\nHe hesitated before the door to the library. Bessie was there, he knew, studiously working up her lessons. She must be nearly through with them, too, for she was always done before dinner, and dinner could not be many minutes away. As for his lessons, they were as yet untouched. The thought made him angry. It was bad enough to have one's sister—and two years younger at that—in the same grade, but to have her continually head and shoulders above him in scholarship was a most intolerable thing. Not that he was dull. No one knew better than himself that he was not dull. But somehow—he did not quite know how—his mind was on other things and he was usually unprepared.\n\nJoe—please come here. There was the slightest possible plaintive note in her voice this time.\n\nWell? he said, thrusting aside the portière with an impetuous movement.\n\nHe said it gruffly, but he was half sorry for it the next instant when he saw a slender little girl regarding him with wistful eyes across the big reading-table heaped with books. She was curled up, with pencil and pad, in an easy-chair of such generous dimensions that it made her seem more delicate and fragile than she really was.\n\nWhat is it, Sis? he asked more gently, crossing over to her side.\n\nShe took his hand in hers and pressed it against her cheek, and as he stood beside her came closer to him with a nestling movement.\n\nWhat is the matter, Joe dear? she asked softly. Won't you tell me?\n\nHe remained silent. It struck him as ridiculous to confess his troubles to a little sister, even if her reports were higher than his. And the little sister struck him as ridiculous to demand his troubles of him. What a soft cheek she has! he thought as she pressed her face gently against his hand. If he could but tear himself away—it was all so foolish! Only he might hurt her feelings, and, in his experience, girls' feelings were very easily hurt.\n\nShe opened his fingers and kissed the palm of his hand. It was like a rose-leaf falling; it was also her way of asking her question over again.\n\nNothing 's the matter, he said decisively. And then, quite inconsistently, he blurted out, Father!\n\nHis worry was now in her eyes. But father is so good and kind, Joe, she began. Why don't you try to please him? He does n't ask much of you, and it 's all for your own good. It 's not as though you were a fool, like some boys. If you would only study a little bit—\n\nThat 's it! Lecturing! he exploded, tearing his hand roughly away. Even you are beginning to lecture me now. I suppose the cook and the stable-boy will be at it next.\n\nHe shoved his hands into his pockets and looked forward into a melancholy and desolate future filled with interminable lectures and lecturers innumerable.\n\nWas that what you wanted me for? he demanded, turning to go.\n\nShe caught at his hand again. No, it wasn't; only you looked so worried that I thought—I— Her voice broke, and she began again freshly. What I wanted to tell you was that we're planning a trip across the bay to Oakland, next Saturday, for a tramp in the hills.\n\nWho 's going?\n\nMyrtle Hayes—\n\nWhat! That little softy? he interrupted.\n\nI don't think she is a softy, Bessie answered with spirit. She 's one of the sweetest girls I know.\n\nWhich is n't saying much, considering the girls you know. But go on. Who are the others?\n\nPearl Sayther, and her sister Alice, and Jessie Hilborn, and Sadie French, and Edna Crothers. That 's all the girls.\n\nJoe sniffed disdainfully. Who are the fellows, then?\n\nMaurice and Felix Clement, Dick Schofield, Burt Layton, and—\n\nThat 's enough. Milk-and-water chaps, all of them.\n\nI—I wanted to ask you and Fred and Charley, she said in a quavering voice. That 's what I called you in for—to ask you to come.\n\nAnd what are you going to do? he asked.\n\nWalk, gather wild flowers,—the poppies are all out now,—eat luncheon at some nice place, and—and—\n\nCome home, he finished for her.\n\nBessie nodded her head. Joe put his hands in his pockets again, and walked up and down.\n\nA sissy outfit, that 's what it is, he said abruptly; and a sissy program. None of it in mine, please.\n\nShe tightened her trembling lips and struggled on bravely. What would you rather do? she asked.\n\nI 'd sooner take Fred and Charley and go off somewhere and do something—well, anything.\n\nHe paused and looked at her. She was waiting patiently for him to proceed. He was aware of his inability to express in words what he felt and wanted, and all his trouble and general dissatisfaction rose up and gripped hold of him.\n\nOh, you can't understand! he burst out. You can't understand. You 're a girl. You like to be prim and neat, and to be good in deportment and ahead in your studies. You don't care for danger and adventure and such things, and you don't care for boys who are rough, and have life and go in them, and all that. You like good little boys in white collars, with clothes always clean and hair always combed, who like to stay in at recess and be petted by the teacher and told how they're always up in their studies; nice little boys who never get into scrapes—who are too busy walking around and picking flowers and eating lunches with girls, to get into scrapes. Oh, I know the kind—afraid of their own shadows, and no more spunk in them than in so many sheep. That 's what they are—sheep. Well, I 'm not a sheep, and there 's no more to be said. And I don't want to go on your picnic, and, what 's more, I 'm not going.\n\nThe tears welled up in Bessie's brown eyes, and her lips were trembling. This angered him unreasonably. What were girls good for, anyway?—always blubbering, and interfering, and carrying on. There was no sense in them.\n\nA fellow can't say anything without making you cry, he began, trying to appease her. Why, I did n't mean anything, Sis. I did n't, sure. I—\n\nHe paused helplessly and looked down at her. She was sobbing, and at the same time shaking with the effort to control her sobs, while big tears were rolling down her cheeks.\n\nOh, you—you girls! he cried, and strode wrathfully out of the room.\n\nChapter II.\n\nThe Draconian Reforms\n\nTable of Contents\n\nA few minutes later, and still wrathful, Joe went in to dinner. He ate silently, though his father and mother and Bessie kept up a genial flow of conversation. There she was, he communed savagely with his plate, crying one minute, and the next all smiles and laughter. Now that was n't his way. If he had anything sufficiently important to cry about, rest assured he would n't get over it for days. Girls were hypocrites, that was all there was to it. They did n't feel one hundredth part of all that they said when they cried. It stood to reason that they did n't. It must be that they just carried on because they enjoyed it. It made them feel good to make other people miserable, especially boys. That was why they were always interfering.\n\nThus reflecting sagely, he kept his eyes on his plate and did justice to the fare; for one cannot scorch from the Cliff House to the Western Addition via the park without being guilty of a healthy appetite.\n\nNow and then his father directed a glance at him in a certain mildly anxious way. Joe did not see these glances, but Bessie saw them, every one. Mr. Bronson was a middle-aged man, well developed and of heavy build, though not fat. His was a rugged face, square-jawed and stern-featured, though his eyes were kindly and there were lines about the mouth that betokened laughter rather than severity. A close examination was not required to discover the resemblance between him and Joe. The same broad forehead and strong jaw characterized them both, and the eyes, taking into consideration the difference of age, were as like as peas from one pod.\n\nHow are you getting on, Joe? Mr. Bronson asked finally. Dinner was over and they were about to leave the table.\n\nOh, I don't know, Joe answered carelessly, and then added: We have examinations to-morrow. I'll know then.\n\nWhither bound? his mother questioned, as he turned to leave the room. She was a slender, willowy woman, whose brown eyes Bessie's were, and likewise her tender ways.\n\nTo my room, Joe answered. To work, he supplemented.\n\nShe rumpled his hair affectionately, and bent and kissed him. Mr. Bronson smiled approval at him as he went out, and he hurried up the stairs, resolved to dig hard and pass the examinations of the coming day.\n\nEntering his room, he locked the door and sat down at a desk most comfortably arranged for a boy's study. He ran his eye over his text-books. The history examination came the first thing in the morning, so he would begin on that. He opened the book where a page was turned down, and began to read:\n\nShortly after the Draconian reforms, a war broke out between Athens and Megara respecting the island of Salamis, to which both cities laid claim.\n\nThat was easy; but what were the Draconian reforms? He must look them up. He felt quite studious as he ran over the back pages, till he chanced to raise his eyes above the top of the book and saw on a chair a baseball mask and a catcher's glove. They should n't have lost that game last Saturday, he thought, and they would n't have, either, if it had n't been for Fred. He wished Fred would n't fumble so. He could hold a hundred difficult balls in succession, but when a critical point came, he 'd let go of even a dewdrop. He 'd have to send him out in the field and bring in Jones to first base. Only Jones was so excitable. He could hold any kind of a ball, no matter how critical the play was, but there was no telling what he would do with the ball after he got it.\n\nJoe came to himself with a start. A pretty way of studying history! He buried his head in his book and began:\n\nShortly after the Draconian reforms—\n\nHe read the sentence through three times, and then recollected that he had not looked up the Draconian reforms.\n\nA knock came at the door. He turned the pages over with a noisy flutter, but made no answer.\n\nThe knock was repeated, and Bessie's Joe, dear came to his ears.\n\nWhat do you want? he demanded. But before she could answer he hurried on: No admittance. I 'm busy.\n\nI came to see if I could help you, she pleaded. I 'm all done, and I thought—\n\nOf course you 're all done! he shouted. You always are!\n\nHe held his head in both his hands to keep his eyes on the book. But the baseball mask bothered him. The more he attempted to keep his mind on the history the more in his mind's eye he saw the mask resting on the chair and all the games in which it had played its part.\n\nThis would never do. He deliberately placed the book face downward on the desk and walked over to the chair. With a swift sweep he sent both mask and glove hurtling under the bed, and so violently that he heard the mask rebound from the wall.\n\nShortly after the Draconian reforms, a war broke out between Athens and Megara—\n\nThe mask had rolled back from the wall. He wondered if it had rolled back far enough for him to see it. No, he would n't look. What did it matter if it had rolled out? That was n't history. He wondered—\n\nHe peered over the top of the book, and there was the mask peeping out at him from under the edge of the bed. This was not to be borne. There was no use attempting to study while that mask was around. He went over and fished it out, crossed the room to the closet, and tossed it inside, then locked the door. That was settled, thank goodness! Now he could do some work.\n\nHe sat down again.\n\nShortly after the Draconian reforms, a war broke out between Athens and Megara respecting the island of Salamis, to which, both cities laid claim.\n\nWhich was all very well, if he had only found out what the Draconian reforms were. A soft glow pervaded the room, and he suddenly became aware of it. What could cause it? He looked out of the window. The setting sun was slanting its long rays against low-hanging masses of summer clouds, turning them to warm scarlet and rosy red; and it was from them that the red light, mellow and glowing, was flung earthward.\n\nHis gaze dropped from the clouds to the bay beneath. The sea-breeze was dying down with the day, and off Fort Point a fishing-boat was creeping into port before the last light breeze. A little beyond, a tug was sending up a twisted pillar of smoke as it towed a three-masted schooner to sea. His eyes wandered over toward the Marin County shore. The line where land and water met was already in darkness, and long shadows were creeping up the hills toward Mount Tamalpais, which was sharply silhouetted against the western sky.\n\nOh, if he, Joe Bronson, were only on that fishing-boat and sailing in with a deep-sea catch! Or if he were on that schooner, heading out into the sunset, into the world! That was life, that was living, doing something and being something in the world. And, instead, here he was, pent up in a close room, racking his brains about people dead and gone thousands of years before he was born.\n\nHe jerked himself away from the window as though held there by some physical force, and resolutely carried his chair and history into the farthest corner of the room, where he sat down with his back to the window.\n\nAn instant later, so it seemed to him, he found himself again staring out of the window and dreaming. How he had got there he did not know. His last recollection was the finding of a subheading on a page on the right-hand side of the book which read: The Laws and Constitution of Draco. And then, evidently like walking in one's sleep, he had come to the window. How long had he been there? he wondered. The fishing-boat which he had seen off Fort Point was now crawling into Meiggs's Wharf. This denoted nearly an hour's lapse of time. The sun had long since set; a solemn grayness was brooding over the water, and the first faint stars were beginning to twinkle over the crest of Mount Tamalpais.\n\nHe turned, with a sigh, to go back into his corner, when a long whistle, shrill and piercing, came to his ears. That was Fred. He sighed again. The whistle repeated itself. Then another whistle joined it. That was Charley. They were waiting on the corner—lucky fellows!\n\nWell, they would n't see him this night. Both whistles arose in duet. He writhed in his chair and groaned. No, they would n't see him this night, he reiterated, at the same time rising to his feet. It was certainly impossible for him to join them when he had not yet learned about the Draconian reforms. The same force which had held him to the window now seemed drawing him across the room to the desk. It made him put the history on top of his school-books, and he had the door unlocked and was half-way into the hall before he realized it. He started to return, but the thought came to him that he could go out for a little while and then come back and do his work.\n\nA very little while, he promised himself, as he went down-stairs. He went down faster and faster, till at the bottom he was going three steps at a time. He popped his cap on his head and went out of the side entrance in a rush; and ere he reached the corner the reforms of Draco were as far away in the past as Draco himself, while the examinations on the morrow were equally far away in the future.\n\nChapter III.\n\nBrick, Sorrel-Top, and Reddy\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat 's up? Joe asked, as he joined Fred and Charley.\n\nKites, Charley answered. Come on. We 're tired out waiting for you.\n\nThe three set off down the street to the brow of the hill, where they looked down upon Union Street, far below and almost under their feet. This they called the Pit, and it was well named. Themselves they called the Hill-dwellers, and a descent into the Pit by the Hill-dwellers was looked upon by them as a great adventure.\n\nScientific kite-flying was one of the keenest pleasures of these three particular Hill-dwellers, and six or eight kites strung out on a mile of twine and soaring into the clouds was an ordinary achievement for them. They were compelled to replenish their kite-supply often; for whenever an accident occurred, and the string broke, or a ducking kite dragged down the rest, or the wind suddenly died out, their kites fell into the Pit, from which place they were unrecoverable. The reason for this was the young people of the Pit were a piratical and robber race with peculiar ideas of ownership and property rights.\n\nOn a day following an accident to a kite of one of the Hill-dwellers, the self-same kite could be seen riding the air attached to a string which led down into the Pit to the lairs of the Pit People. So it came about that the Pit People, who were a poor folk and unable to afford scientific kite-flying, developed great proficiency in the art when their neighbors the Hill-dwellers took it up.\n\nThere was also an old sailorman who profited by this recreation of the Hill-dwellers; for he was learned in sails and air-currents, and being deft of hand and cunning, he fashioned the best-flying kites that could be obtained. He lived in a rattletrap shanty close to the water, where he could still watch with dim eyes the ebb and flow of the tide, and the ships pass out and in, and where he could revive old memories of the days when he, too, went down to the sea in ships.\n\nTo reach his shanty from the Hill one had to pass through the Pit, and thither the three boys were bound. They had often gone for kites in the daytime, but this was their first trip after dark, and they felt it to be, as it indeed was, a hazardous adventure.\n\nIn simple words, the Pit was merely the cramped and narrow quarters of the poor, where many nationalities crowded together in cosmopolitan confusion, and lived as best they could, amid much dirt and squalor. It was still early evening when the boys passed through on their way to the sailorman's shanty, and no mishap befell them, though some of the Pit boys stared at them savagely and hurled a taunting remark after them, now and then.\n\nThe sailorman made kites which were not only splendid fliers but which folded up and were very convenient to carry. Each of the boys bought a few, and, with them wrapped in compact bundles and under their arms, started back on the return journey.\n\nKeep a sharp lookout for the b'ys, the kite-maker cautioned them. They 're like to be cruisin' round after dark.\n\nWe 're not afraid, Charley assured him; and we know how to take care of ourselves.\n\nUsed to the broad and quiet streets of the Hill, the boys were shocked and stunned by the life that teemed in the close-packed quarter. It seemed some thick and monstrous growth of vegetation, and that they were wading through it. They shrank closely together in the tangle of narrow streets as though for protection, conscious of the strangeness of it all, and how unrelated they were to it.\n\nChildren and babies sprawled on the sidewalk and under their feet. Bareheaded and unkempt women gossiped in the doorways or passed back and forth with scant marketings in their arms. There was a general odor of decaying fruit and fish, a smell of staleness and putridity. Big hulking men slouched by, and ragged little girls walked gingerly through the confusion with foaming buckets of beer in their hands. There was a clatter and garble of foreign tongues and brogues, shrill cries, quarrels and wrangles, and the Pit pulsed with a great and steady murmur, like the hum of the human hive that it was.\n\nPhew! I 'll be glad when we 're out of it, Fred said.\n\nHe spoke in a whisper, and Joe and Charley nodded grimly that they agreed with him. They were not inclined to speech, and they walked as rapidly as the crowd permitted, with much the same feelings as those of travelers in a dangerous and hostile jungle.\n\nAnd danger and hostility stalked in the Pit. The inhabitants seemed to resent the presence of these strangers from the Hill. Dirty little urchins abused them as they passed, snarling with assumed bravery, and prepared to run away at the first sign of attack. And still other little urchins formed a noisy parade at the heels of the boys, and grew bolder with increasing numbers.\n\nDon't mind them, Joe cautioned. Take no notice, but keep right on. We 'll soon be out of it.\n\nNo; we 're in for it, said Fred, in an undertone. Look there!\n\nOn the corner they were approaching, four or five boys of about their own age were standing. The light from a street-lamp fell upon them and disclosed one with vivid red hair. It could be no other than Brick Simpson, the redoubtable leader of a redoubtable gang. Twice within their memory he had led his gang up the Hill and spread panic and terror among the Hill-dwelling young folk, who fled wildly to their homes, while their fathers and mothers hurriedly telephoned for the police.\n\nAt sight of the group on the corner, the rabble at the heels of the three boys melted away on the instant with like manifestations of fear. This but increased the anxiety of the boys, though they held boldly on their way.\n\nThe red-haired boy detached himself from the group, and stepped before them, blocking their path. They essayed to go around him, but he stretched out his arm.\n\nWot yer doin' here? he snarled. Why don't yer stay where yer b'long?\n\nWe 're just going home, Fred said mildly.\n\nBrick looked at Joe. Wot yer got under yer arm? he demanded.\n\nJoe contained himself and took no heed of him. Come on, he said to Fred and Charley, at the same time starting to brush past the gang-leader.\n\nBut with a quick blow Brick Simpson struck him in the face, and with equal quickness snatched the bundle of kites from under his arm.\n\nJoe uttered an inarticulate cry of rage, and, all caution flung to the winds, sprang at his assailant.\n\nThis was evidently a surprise to the gang-leader, who expected least of all to be attacked in his own territory. He retreated backward, still clutching the kites, and divided between desire to fight and desire to retain his capture.\n\nThe latter desire dominated him, and he turned and fled swiftly down the narrow side-street into a labyrinth of streets and alleys. Joe knew that he was plunging into the wilderness of the enemy's country, but his sense of both property and pride had been offended, and he took up the pursuit hot-footed.\n\nFred and Charley followed after, though he outdistanced them, and behind came the three other members of the gang, emitting a whistling call while they ran which was evidently intended for the assembling of the rest of the band. As the chase proceeded, these whistles were answered from many different directions, and soon a score of dark figures were tagging at the heels of Fred and Charley, who, in turn, were straining every muscle to keep the swifter-footed Joe in sight.\n\nBrick Simpson darted into a vacant lot, aiming for a slip, as such things are called which are prearranged passages through fences and over sheds and houses and around dark holes and corners, where the unfamiliar pursuer must go more carefully and where the chances are many that he will soon lose the track.\n\nBut Joe caught Brick before he could attain his end, and together they rolled over and over in the dirt, locked in each other's arms. By the time Fred and Charley and the gang had come up, they were on their feet, facing each other.\n\nWot d' ye want, eh? the red-headed gang-leader was saying in a bullying tone. Wot d' ye want? That 's wot I wanter know.\n\nI want my kites, Joe answered.\n\nBrick Simpson's eyes sparkled at the intelligence. Kites were something he stood in need of himself.\n\nThen you 've got to fight fer 'em, he announced.\n\nWhy should I fight for them? Joe demanded indignantly. They 're mine. Which went to show how ignorant he was of the ideas of ownership and property rights which obtained among the People of the Pit.\n\nA chorus of jeers and catcalls went up from the gang, which clustered behind its leader like a pack of wolves.\n\nWhy should I fight for them? Joe reiterated.\n\n'Cos I say so, Simpson replied. An' wot I say goes. Understand?\n\nBut Joe did not understand. He refused to understand that Brick Simpson's word was law in San Francisco, or any part of San Francisco. His love of honesty and right dealing was offended, and all his fighting blood was up.\n\nYou give those kites to me, right here and now, he threatened, reaching out his hand for them.\n\nBut Simpson jerked them away. D' ye know who I am? he demanded. I 'm Brick Simpson, an' I don't 'low no one to talk to me in that tone of voice.\n\nBetter leave him alone, Charley whispered in Joe's ear. What are a few kites? Leave him alone and let 's get out of this.\n\nThey 're my kites, Joe said slowly in a dogged manner. They 're my kites, and I 'm going to have them.\n\nYou can't fight the crowd, Fred interfered; and if you do get the best of him they 'll all pile on you.\n\nThe gang, observing this whispered colloquy, and mistaking it for hesitancy on the part of Joe, set up its wolf-like howling again.\n\nAfraid! afraid! the young roughs jeered and taunted. He 's too high-toned, he is! Mebbe he 'll spoil his nice clean shirt, and then what 'll mama say?\n\nShut up! their leader snapped authoritatively, and the noise obediently died away.\n\nWill you give me those kites? Joe demanded, advancing determinedly.\n\nWill you fight for 'em? was Simpson's counter-demand.\n\nYes, Joe answered.\n\nFight! fight! the gang began to howl again.\n\nAnd it 's me that 'll see fair play, said a man's heavy voice.\n\nAll eyes were instantly turned upon the man who had approached unseen and made this announcement. By the electric light, shining brightly on them from the corner, they made him out to be a big, muscular fellow, clad in a working-man's garments. His feet were incased in heavy brogans, a narrow strap of black leather held his overalls about his waist, and a black and greasy cap was on his head. His face was grimed with coal-dust, and a coarse blue shirt, open at the neck, revealed a wide throat and massive chest.\n\nAn' who 're you? Simpson snarled, angry at the interruption.\n\nNone of yer business, the newcomer retorted tartly. But, if it 'll do you any good, I 'm a fireman on the China steamers, and, as I said, I 'm goin' to see fair play. That 's my business. Your business is to give fair play. So pitch in, and don't be all night about it.\n\nThe three boys were as pleased by the appearance of the fireman as Simpson and his followers were displeased. They conferred together for several minutes, when Simpson deposited the bundle of kites in the arms of one of his gang and stepped forward.\n\nCome on, then, he said, at the same time pulling off his coat.\n\nJoe handed his to Fred, and sprang toward Brick. They put up their fists and faced each other. Almost instantly Simpson drove in a fierce blow and ducked cleverly away and out of reach of the blow which Joe returned. Joe felt a sudden respect for the abilities of his antagonist, but the only effect upon him was to arouse all the doggedness of his nature and make him utterly determined to win.\n\nAwed by the presence of the fireman, Simpson's followers confined themselves to cheering Brick and jeering Joe. The two boys circled round and round, attacking, feinting, and guarding, and now one and then the other getting in a telling blow. Their positions were in marked contrast. Joe stood erect, planted solidly on his feet, with legs wide apart and head up. On the other hand, Simpson crouched till his head was nearly lost between his shoulders, and all the while he was in constant motion, leaping and springing and manoeuvering in the execution of a score or more of tricks quite new and strange to Joe.\n\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, both were very tired, though Joe was much fresher. Tobacco, ill food, and unhealthy living were telling on the gang-leader, who was panting and sobbing for breath. Though at first (and because of superior skill) he had severely punished Joe, he was now weak and his blows were without force. Growing desperate, he adopted what might be called not an unfair but a mean method of attack: he would manoeuver, leap in and strike swiftly, and then, ducking forward, fall to the ground at Joe's feet. Joe could not strike him while he was down, and so would step back until he could get on his feet again, when the thing would be repeated.\n\nBut Joe grew tired of this, and prepared for him. Timing his blow with Simpson's attack, he delivered it just as Simpson was ducking forward to fall. Simpson fell, but he fell over on one side, whither he had been driven by the impact of Joe's fist upon his head. He rolled over and got half-way to his feet, where he remained, crying and gasping. His followers called upon him to get up, and he tried once or twice, but was too exhausted and stunned.\n\nI give in, he said. I 'm licked.\n\nThe gang had become silent and depressed at its leader's defeat.\n\nJoe stepped forward.\n\nI 'll trouble you for those kites, he said to the boy who was holding them.\n\nOh, I dunno, said another member of the gang, shoving in between Joe and his property. His hair was also a vivid red. You 've got to lick me before you kin have 'em.\n\nI don't see that, Joe said bluntly. I 've fought and I 've won, and there 's nothing more to it.\n\nOh, yes, there is, said the other. I 'm 'Sorrel-top' Simpson. Brick 's my brother. See?\n\nAnd so, in this fashion, Joe learned another custom of the Pit People of which he had been ignorant.\n\nAll right, he said, his fighting blood more fully aroused than ever by the unjustness of the proceeding. Come on.\n\nSorrel-top Simpson, a year younger than his brother, proved to be a most unfair fighter, and the good-natured fireman was compelled to interfere several times before the second of the Simpson clan lay on the ground and acknowledged defeat.\n\nThis time Joe reached for his kites without the slightest doubt that he was to get them. But still another lad stepped in between him and his property. The telltale hair, vividly red, sprouted likewise on this lad's head, and Joe knew him at once for what he was, another member of the Simpson clan. He was a younger edition of his brothers, somewhat less heavily built, with a face covered with a vast quantity of freckles, which showed plainly under the electric light.\n\nYou don't git them there kites till you git me, he challenged in a piping little voice. I 'm 'Reddy' Simpson, an' you ain't licked the fambly till you 've licked me.\n\nThe gang cheered admiringly, and Reddy stripped a tattered jacket preparatory for the fray.\n\nGit ready, he said to Joe.\n\nJoe's knuckles were torn, his nose was bleeding, his lip was cut and swollen, while his shirt had been ripped down from throat to waist. Further, he was tired, and breathing hard.\n\nHow many more are there of you Simpsons? he asked. I 've got to get home, and if your family 's much larger this thing is liable to keep on all night.\n\nI 'm the last an' the best, Reddy replied. You gits me an' you gits the kites. Sure.\n\nAll right, Joe sighed. Come on.\n\nWhile the youngest of the clan lacked the strength and skill of his elders, he made up for it by a wildcat manner of fighting that taxed Joe severely. Time and again it seemed to him that he must give in to the little whirlwind; but each time he pulled himself together and went doggedly on. For he felt that he was fighting for principle, as his forefathers had fought for principle; also, it seemed to him that the honor of the Hill was at stake, and that he, as its representative, could do nothing less than his very best.\n\nSo he held on and managed to endure his opponent's swift and continuous rushes till that young and less experienced person at last wore himself out with his own exertions, and from the ground confessed that, for the first time in its history, the Simpson fambly was beat.\n\nChapter IV.\n\nThe Biter Bitten\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBut life in the Pit at best was a precarious affair, as the three Hill-dwellers were quickly to learn. Before Joe could even possess himself of his kites, his astonished eyes were greeted with the spectacle of all his enemies, the fireman included, taking to their heels in wild flight. As the little girls and urchins had melted away before the Simpson gang, so was melting away the Simpson gang before some new and correspondingly awe-inspiring group of predatory creatures.\n\nJoe heard terrified cries of Fish gang! Fish gang! from those who fled, and he would have fled himself from this new danger, only he was breathless from his last encounter, and knew the impossibility of escaping whatever threatened. Fred and Charley felt mighty longings to run away from a danger great enough to frighten the redoubtable Simpson gang and the valorous fireman, but they could not desert their comrade.\n\nDark forms broke into the vacant lot, some surrounding the boys and others dashing after the fugitives. That the laggards were overtaken was evidenced by the cries of distress that went up, and when later the pursuers returned, they brought with them the luckless and snarling Brick, still clinging fast to the bundle of kites.\n\nJoe looked curiously at this latest band of marauders. They were young men of from seventeen and eighteen to twenty-three and -four years of age, and bore the unmistakable stamp of the hoodlum class. There were vicious faces among them—faces so vicious as to make Joe's flesh creep as he looked at them. A couple grasped him tightly by the arms, and Fred and Charley were similarly held captive.\n\nLook here, you, said one who spoke with the authority of leader, we 've got to inquire into this. Wot 's be'n goin' on here? Wot 're you up to, Red-head? Wot you be'n doin'?\n\nAin't be'n doin' nothin', Simpson whined.\n\nLooks like it. The leader turned up Brick's face to the electric light. Who 's been paintin' you up like that? he demanded.\n\nBrick pointed at Joe, who was forthwith dragged to the front.\n\nWot was you scrappin' about?\n\nKites—my kites, Joe spoke up boldly. That fellow tried to take them away from me. He 's got them under his arm now.\n\nOh, he has, has he? Look here, you Brick, we don't put up with stealin' in this territory. See? You never rightly owned nothin'. Come, fork over the kites. Last call.\n\nThe leader tightened his grasp threateningly, and Simpson, weeping tears of rage, surrendered the plunder.\n\nWot yer got under yer arm? the leader demanded abruptly of Fred, at the same time jerking out the bundle. More kites, eh? Reg'lar kite-factory gone and got itself lost, he remarked finally, when he had appropriated Charley's bundle. Now, wot I wants to know is wot we 're goin' to do to you t'ree chaps? he continued in a judicial tone.\n\nWhat for? Joe demanded hotly. For being robbed of our kites?\n\nNot at all, not at all, the leader responded politely; but for luggin' kites round these quarters an' causin' all this unseemly disturbance. It 's disgraceful; that 's wot it is—disgraceful.\n\nAt this juncture, when the Hill-dwellers were the center of attraction, Brick suddenly wormed out of his jacket, squirmed away from his captors, and dashed across the lot to the slip for which he had been originally headed when overtaken by Joe. Two or three of the gang shot over the fence after him in noisy pursuit. There was much barking and howling of back-yard dogs and clattering of shoes over sheds and boxes. Then there came a splashing of water, as though a barrel of it had been precipitated to the ground. Several minutes later the pursuers returned, very sheepish and very wet from the deluge presented them by the wily Brick, whose voice, high up in the air from some friendly housetop, could be heard defiantly jeering them.\n\nThis event apparently disconcerted the leader of the gang, and just as he turned to Joe and Fred and Charley, a long and peculiar whistle came to their ears from the street—the warning signal, evidently, of a scout posted to keep a lookout. The next moment the scout himself came flying back to the main body, which was already beginning to retreat.\n\nCops! he panted.\n\nJoe looked, and he saw two helmeted policemen approaching, with bright stars shining on their breasts.\n\nLet 's get out of this, he whispered to Fred and Charley.\n\nThe gang had already taken to flight, and they blocked the boys' retreat in one quarter, and in another they saw the policemen advancing. So they took to their heels in the direction of Brick Simpson's slip, the policemen hot after them and yelling bravely for them to halt.\n\nBut young feet are nimble, and young feet when frightened become something more than nimble, and the boys were first over the fence and plunging wildly through a maze of back yards. They soon found that the policemen were discreet. Evidently they had had experiences in slips, and they were satisfied to give over the chase at the first fence.\n\nNo street-lamps shed their light here, and the boys blundered along through the blackness with their hearts in their mouths. In one yard, filled with mountains of crates and fruit-boxes, they were lost for a quarter of an hour. Feel and quest about as they would, they encountered nothing but endless heaps of boxes. From this wilderness they finally emerged by way of a shed roof, only to fall into another yard, cumbered with countless empty chicken-coops.\n\nFarther on they came upon the contrivance which had soaked Brick Simpson's pursuers with water. It was a cunning arrangement. Where the slip led through a fence with a board missing, a long slat was so arranged that the ignorant wayfarer could not fail to strike against it. This slat was the spring of the trap. A light touch upon it was sufficient to disconnect a heavy stone from a barrel perched overhead and nicely balanced. The disconnecting of the stone permitted the barrel to turn over and spill its contents on the one beneath who touched the slat.\n\nThe boys examined the arrangement with keen appreciation. Luckily for them, the barrel was overturned, or they too would have received a ducking, for Joe, who was in advance, had blundered against the slat.\n\nI wonder if this is Simpson's back yard? he queried softly.\n\nIt must be, Fred concluded, or else the back yard of some member of his gang.\n\nCharley put his hands warningly on both their arms.\n\nHist! What 's that? he whispered.\n\nThey crouched down on the ground. Not far away was the sound of some one moving about. Then they heard a noise of falling water, as from a faucet into a bucket. This was followed by steps boldly approaching. They crouched lower, breathless with apprehension.\n\nA dark form passed by within arm's reach and mounted on a box to the fence. It was Brick himself, resetting the trap. They heard him arrange the slat and stone, then right the barrel and empty into it a couple of buckets of water. As he came down from the box to go after more water, Joe sprang upon him, tripped him up, and held him to the ground.\n\nDon't make any noise, he said. I want you to listen to me.\n\nOh, it 's you, is it? Simpson replied, with such obvious relief in his voice as to make them feel relieved also. Wot d' ye want here?\n\nWe want to get out of here, Joe said, and the shortest way 's the best. There 's three of us, and you 're only one—\n\nThat 's all right, that 's all right, the gang-leader interrupted. I 'd just as soon show you the way out as not. I ain't got nothin' 'gainst you. Come on an' follow me, an' don't step to the side, an' I 'll have you out in no time.\n\nSeveral minutes later they dropped from the top of a high fence into a dark alley.\n\nFollow this to the street, Simpson directed; turn to the right two blocks, turn to the right again for three, an' yer on Union. Tra-la-loo.\n\nThey said good-by, and as they started down the alley received the following advice:\n\nNex' time you bring kites along, you 'd best leave 'em to home.\n\nChapter V.\n\nHome Again\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFollowing Brick Simpson's directions, they came into Union Street, and without further mishap gained the Hill. From the brow they looked down into the Pit, whence arose that steady, indefinable hum which comes from crowded human places.\n\nI 'll never go down there again, not as long as I live, Fred said with a great deal of savagery in his voice. I wonder what became of the fireman.\n\nWe 're lucky to get back with whole skins, Joe cheered them philosophically.\n\nI guess we left our share, and you more than yours, laughed Charley.\n\nYes, Joe answered. And I 've got more trouble to face when I get home. Good night, fellows.\n\nAs he expected, the door on the side porch was locked, and he went around to the dining-room and entered like a burglar through a window. As he crossed the wide hall, walking softly toward the stairs, his father came out of the library. The surprise was mutual, and each halted aghast.\n\nJoe felt a hysterical desire to laugh, for he thought that he knew precisely how he looked. In reality he looked far worse than he imagined. What Mr. Bronson saw was a boy with hat and coat covered with dirt, his whole face smeared with the stains of conflict, and, in particular, a badly swollen nose, a bruised eyebrow, a cut and swollen lip, a scratched cheek, knuckles still bleeding, and a shirt torn open from throat to waist.\n\nWhat does this mean, sir? Mr. Bronson finally managed to articulate.\n\nJoe stood speechless. How could he tell, in one brief sentence, all the whole night's happenings?—for all that must be included in the explanation of what his luckless disarray meant.\n\nHave you lost your tongue? Mr. Bronson demanded with an appearance of impatience.\n\nI 've—I 've—\n\nYes, yes, his father encouraged.\n\nI 've—well, I 've been down in the Pit, Joe succeeded in blurting out.\n\nI must confess that you look like it—very much like it indeed. Mr. Bronson spoke severely, but if ever by great effort he conquered a smile, that was the time. I presume, he went on, that you do not refer to the abiding-place of sinners, but rather to some definite locality in San Francisco. Am I right?\n\nJoe swept his arm in a descending gesture toward Union Street, and said: Down there, sir.\n\nAnd who gave it that name?\n\nI did, Joe answered, as though confessing to a specified crime.\n\nIt 's most appropriate, I 'm sure, and denotes imagination. It could n't really be bettered. You must do well at school, sir, with your English.\n\nThis did not increase Joe's happiness, for English was the only study of which he did not have to feel ashamed.\n\nAnd, while he stood thus a silent picture of misery and disgrace, Mr. Bronson looked upon him through the eyes of his own boyhood with an understanding which Joe could not have believed possible.\n\nHowever, what you need just now is not a discourse, but a bath and court-plaster and witch-hazel and cold-water bandages, Mr. Bronson said; so to bed with you. You 'll need all the sleep you can get, and you 'll feel stiff and sore to-morrow morning, I promise you.\n\nThe clock struck one as Joe pulled the bedclothes around him; and the next he knew he was being worried by a soft, insistent rapping, which seemed to continue through several centuries, until at last, unable to endure it longer, he opened his eyes and sat up.\n\nThe day was streaming in through the window—bright and sunshiny day. He stretched his arms to yawn; but a shooting pain darted through all the muscles, and his arms came down more rapidly than they had gone up. He looked at them with a bewildered stare, till suddenly the events of the night rushed in upon him, and he groaned.\n\nThe rapping still persisted, and he cried: Yes, I hear. What time is it?\n\nEight o'clock, Bessie's voice came to him through the door. Eight o'clock, and you 'll have to hurry if you don't want to be late for school.\n\nGoodness! He sprang out of bed precipitately, groaned with the pain from all his stiff muscles, and collapsed slowly and carefully on a chair. Why did n't you call me sooner? he growled.\n\nFather said to let you sleep.\n\nJoe groaned again, in another fashion Then his history-book caught his eye, and he groaned yet again and in still another fashion.\n\nAll right, he called. Go on. I 'll be down in a jiffy.\n\nHe did come down in fairly brief order; but if Bessie had watched him descend the stairs she would have been astounded at the remarkable caution he observed and at the twinges of pain that every now and then contorted his face. As it was, when she came upon him in the dining-room she uttered a frightened cry and ran over to him.\n\nWhat 's the matter, Joe? she asked tremulously. What has happened?\n\nNothing, he grunted, putting sugar on his porridge.\n\nBut surely— she began.\n\nPlease don't bother me, he interrupted. I 'm late, and I want to eat my breakfast.\n\nAnd just then Mrs. Bronson caught Bessie's eye, and that young lady, still mystified, made haste to withdraw herself.\n\nJoe was thankful to his mother for that, and thankful that she refrained from remarking upon his appearance. Father had told her; that was one thing sure. He could trust her not to worry him; it was never her way.\n\nAnd, meditating in this way, he hurried through with his solitary breakfast, vaguely conscious in an uncomfortable way that his mother was fluttering anxiously about him. Tender as she always was, he noticed that she kissed him with unusual tenderness as he started out with his books swinging at the end of a strap; and he also noticed, as he turned the corner, that she was still looking after him through the window.\n\nBut of more vital importance than that, to him, was his stiffness and soreness. As he walked along, each step was an effort and a torment. Severely as the reflected sunlight from the cement sidewalk hurt his bruised eye, and severely as his various wounds pained him, still more severely did he suffer from his muscles and joints. He had never imagined such stiffness. Each individual muscle in his whole body protested when called upon to move. His fingers were badly swollen, and it was agony to clasp and unclasp them; while his arms were sore from wrist to elbow. This, he said to himself, was caused by the many blows which he had warded off from his face and body. He wondered if Brick Simpson was in similar plight, and the thought of their mutual misery made him feel a certain kinship for that redoubtable young ruffian.\n\nWhen he entered the school-yard he quickly became aware that he was the center of attraction for all eyes. The boys crowded around in an awe-stricken way, and even his classmates and those with whom he was well acquainted looked at him with a certain respect he had never seen before.\n\nChapter VI.\n\nExamination Day\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIt was plain that Fred and Charley had spread the news of their descent into the Pit, and of their battle with the Simpson clan and the Fishes. He heard the nine-o'clock bell with feelings of relief, and passed into the school, a mark for admiring glances from all the boys. The girls, too, looked at him in a timid and fearful way—as they might have looked at Daniel when he came out of the lions' den, Joe thought, or at David after his battle with Goliath. It made him uncomfortable and painfully self-conscious, this hero-worshiping, and he wished heartily that they would look in some other direction for a change.\n\nSoon they did look in another direction. While big sheets of foolscap were being distributed to every desk, Miss Wilson, the teacher (an austere-looking young woman who went through the world as though it were a refrigerator, and who, even on the warmest days in the classroom, was to be found with a shawl or cape about her shoulders), arose, and on the blackboard where all could see wrote the Roman numeral I. Every eye, and there were fifty pairs of them, hung with expectancy upon her hand, and in the pause that followed the room was quiet as the grave.\n\nUnderneath the Roman numeral I she wrote: (a) What were the laws of Draco? (b) Why did an Athenian orator say that they were written 'not in ink, but in blood'?\n\nForty-nine heads bent down and forty-nine pens scratched lustily across as many sheets of foolscap. Joe's head alone remained up, and he regarded the blackboard with so blank a stare that Miss Wilson, glancing over her shoulder after having written II, stopped to look at him. Then she wrote:\n\n(a) How did the war between Athens and Megara, respecting the island of Salamis, bring about the reforms of Solon? (b) In what way did they differ from the laws of Draco?\n\nShe turned to look at Joe again. He was staring as blankly as ever.\n\nWhat is the matter, Joe? she asked. Have you no paper?\n\nYes, I have, thank you, he answered, and began moodily to sharpen a lead-pencil.\n\nHe made a fine point to it. Then he made a very fine point. Then, and with infinite patience, he proceeded to make it very much finer. Several of his classmates raised their heads inquiringly at the noise. But he did not notice. He was too absorbed in his pencil-sharpening and in thinking thoughts far away from both pencil-sharpening and Greek history.\n\nOf course you all understand that the examination papers are to be written with ink.\n\nMiss Wilson addressed the class in general, but her eyes rested on Joe.\n\nJust as it was about as fine as it could possibly be the point broke, and Joe began over again.\n\nI am afraid, Joe, that you annoy the class, Miss Wilson said in final desperation.\n\nHe put the pencil down, closed the knife with a snap, and returned to his blank staring at the blackboard. What did he know about Draco? or Solon? or the rest of the Greeks? It was a flunk, and that was all there was to it. No need for him to look at the rest of the questions, and even if he did know the answers to two or three, there was no use in writing them down. It would not prevent the flunk. Besides, his arm hurt him too much to write. It hurt his eyes to look at the blackboard, and his eyes hurt even when they were closed; and it seemed positively to hurt him to think.\n\nSo the forty-nine pens scratched on in a race after Miss Wilson, who was covering the blackboard with question after question; and he listened to the scratching, and watched the questions growing under her chalk, and was very miserable indeed. His head seemed whirling around. It ached inside and was sore outside, and he did not seem to have any control of it at all.\n\nHe was beset with memories of the Pit, like scenes from some monstrous nightmare, and, try as he would, he could not dispel them. He would fix his mind and eyes on Miss Wilson's face, who was now sitting at her desk, and even as he looked at her the face of Brick Simpson, impudent and pugnacious, would arise before him. It was of no use. He felt sick and sore and tired and worthless. There was nothing to be done but flunk. And when, after an age of waiting, the papers were collected, his went in a blank, save for his name, the name of the examination, and the date, which were written across the top.\n\nAfter a brief interval, more papers were given out, and the examination in arithmetic began. He did not trouble himself to look at the questions. Ordinarily he might have pulled through such an examination, but in his present state of mind and body he knew it was impossible. He contented himself with burying his face in his hands and hoping for the noon hour. Once, lifting his eyes to the clock, he caught Bessie looking anxiously at him across"
