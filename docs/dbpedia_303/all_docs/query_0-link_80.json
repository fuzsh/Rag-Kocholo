        "text": "Premise\n\nSharky & George is set in the underwater city of Seacago, populated by various kinds of fish. The protagonists are two fish private detectives who run their own agency. Sharky, the bigger fish, is a rather lazy pink shark with a huge nose, and wears a Humphrey Bogart-style fedora hat. George, the smaller fish, is blue with a yellow face, and is younger than Sharky. Together the two friends combat the mad plans of conquest of the many villains and gangs that are terrorizing Seacago, including Dr. Medusa (Dr. Jelly in English versions; mad scientist and self-proclaimed master of the world) and Red Lobster (Colonel Klaw in English versions; German commander of the army of Black Crab).\n\nInternational presence\n\nIt was translated into English, and shown on Channel 4, Sky Channel and The Children's Channel in the United Kingdom.
