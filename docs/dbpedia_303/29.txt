WHITE FANG takes place during the Yukon Territory's Gold Rush near the end of the 19th century. Speculators and miners from the U.S. have disrupted the natural beauty and the native people. When a wolf-dog is born to Kichi, who has been known as the native tribe's fastest sled dog, the magnificent animal nurtures him and teaches him to survive in the wild. Winter finds Kichi taking her pup to Grey Beaver (voiced by Eddie Spears) and his people, where they will find warmth and food. There, White Fang, as Grey Beaver names him, grows into a powerful animal, as smart and resourceful as he is strong. Unfortunately, dogfight promoter Beauty Smith (Paul Giamatti) sees White Fang's potential in the ring. Dogfights provide "entertainment" and gambling opportunities for the towns filled with men hopeful to strike gold. Smith manages to stealthily gain custody of the wolf-dog. White Fang is mistreated and turned into a dominant competitor, fearful of humans and desolate. Only with the arrival of a heroic lawman and his wife (Nick Offerman and Rashida Jones) will it be possible to save White Fang and help him find his way back to the noble life he deserves.
