this show isn't meant to be anything but good wholesome family entertainment, and in that sense this show delivers. what more can you want for your children than an adorable wolf and some exciting story lines that always have good messages . the lead actor is annoying, but you'll get over it if you give it a chance. the wolf in this show is the same wolf who was famous for actually seeming to talk. at the end of each show you can hear him say "i love you". on many TV shows he spoke for audiences saying "i love you", "hello", and the most amazing.... "God bless you". what a wonderful animal. now, if your tastes are for something like sex and the city or the sopranos then maybe this show isn't for you. but if you like family entertainment with warm family values then white fang is the show for you.
