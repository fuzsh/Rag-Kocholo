        "text": "Kurt Alder (1902–1958) studied chemistry in Berlin and Kiel and earned his doctoral degree from 1922 to 1926 in Kiel. Alder worked as an assistant in chemistry from 1926 to 1930 and as a private lecturer at Kiel University from 1930 to 1934. After that, he was employed as a professor of chemistry until 1937. In 1950 he and his mentor Otto Diels won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovering and developing diene synthesis, which is also known as the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\nKurt Alder in the Kiel Directory of Scholars\n\nMore information about Kurt Alder\n\nLenard (1862-1947) studied natural sciences in Budapest and Vienna as well as physics in Berlin and Heidelberg. In 1898 Lenard moved to Kiel, where he became a director and created a new institute for physics. The nine years Lenard spent in Kiel were, scientifically speaking, among his most productive. He discovered the most important laws of photoelectric effects in Kiel in 1900. He developed the dynamid atomic model, a precursor of the modern atomic model which argues the majority of atoms is empty space. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1905 for “important work on cathode rays”.\n\nHowever, Lenard’s enthusiasm for Adolf Hitler and National Socialism overshadow his outstanding scientific achievements in physics. After World War I, Lenard was no longer able to come to terms with modern discoveries in physics. He rejected Einstein’s theory of relativity, not least because of anti-Semitic prejudices. In 1920, he publicly attacked Einstein at the natural scientists’ convention in Bad Nauheim and eventually left the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (German Physics Society). As early as 1924, he openly professed his support for Hitler and National Socialism in his appeal in favour of Hitler’s principles and science.\n\nPhilipp Eduard Anton Lenard in the Kiel Directory of Scholars\n\nMore information about Philipp Eduard Anton Lenard\n\nOn the occasion of the 350th anniversary of Kiel University in 2015, the four Rotary Clubs of Kiel donated the portrait busts of former Kiel scientists to whom the Nobel Prize was awarded. The sculptures were created by the internationally renowned sculptor Jörg Plickat from Bredenbek .\n\nThe Rotary Clubs of Kiel have set a sign of solidarity with their university by creating these portrait busts. It also honors the outstanding achievements of researchers and scientists who once worked in Kiel and emphasises the importance of science and research at our universities in the past, present and future."
