        "text": "Theodor Mommsen (30 November 1817 – 1 November 1903) was a German classical scholar. In 1902, Theodor Mommsen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nLife and Career\n\nTheodor Mommsen was born on 30 November 1817, in Garding, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Mommsen pursued a wide range of studies, focusing on law, philology, and history. He completed his doctorate in law in 1843 and embarked on a career in academia. Mommsen is most famous for his monumental work, “Römische Geschichte” (The History of Rome), a multi-volume history of Rome that earned him a Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902 (though the award technically recognized his collective contribution to historical research rather than the specific work). This work is considered a landmark in the field of classical studies and is known for its meticulous research and engaging narrative style.\n\nHe also made significant contributions to epigraphy, the study of inscriptions, and was involved in various archaeological endeavors. He held academic positions at various universities, including the University of Leipzig and the University of Berlin. Theodor Mommsen passed away on 1 November 1903, in Charlottenburg, Germany.\n\nAward and Legacy"
