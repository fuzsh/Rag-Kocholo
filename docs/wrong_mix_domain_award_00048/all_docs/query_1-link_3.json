        "text": "Award\n\n1902 Nobel Prize in LiteratureTheodor MommsenDate\n\n9 October 1902 (announcement)\n\n10 December 1902\n\n(ceremony)\n\nLocationStockholm, SwedenPresented bySwedish AcademyFirst awarded1901WebsiteOfficial website\n\n← 1901 · Nobel Prize in Literature · 1903 →\n\nThe 1902 Nobel Prize in Literature was the second prestigious literary award based upon Alfred Nobel's will, which was given to German historian Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) \"the greatest living master of the art of historical writing, with special reference to his monumental work A History of Rome.\"[1]\n\nMain article: Theodor Mommsen\n\nTheodor Mommsen was a writer expert both in history and law, and this combination was important for his research career. His Nobel Prize was motivated primarily by his pioneering three-volume work about Roman history, Römische Geschichte. It depicted different aspects of the Roman Republic's history: political, legal, economic, cultural and even geographical and meteorological. According to the Swedish Academy, his writing was \"vivid and empathetic\", and it was for these literary qualities that he was awarded the Nobel Prize.[2]\n\nWhen Mommsen was awarded the prize, the world recognition was given him with \"special reference\" to the Römische Geschichte (the History of Rome).[3] The award came nearly fifty years after the first appearance of the work. The award also came during the last year of the author's life (1817–1903). It is the only time thus far that the Nobel Prize for Literature has been presented to a historian per se.[4] Yet the literary Nobel has since been awarded to a philosopher (1950) with mention of an \"intellectual history\",[5] and to a war-time leader (1953) for speeches and writings, including a \"current events history\",[6] plus a Nobel Memorial Prize has been awarded for two \"economic histories\" (1993).[7] Nonetheless Mommsen's multi-volume History of Rome remains in a singular Nobel class.\n\nThe 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, a well-regarded reference yet nonetheless \"a source unsparingly critical\", summarizes: \"Equally great as antiquary, jurist, political and social historian, Mommsen lived to see the time when among students of Roman history he had pupils, followers, critics, but no rivals. He combined the power of minute investigation with a singular faculty for bold generalization and the capacity for tracing out the effects of thought on political and social life.\"[8]\n\nThe British historian G. P. Gooch, writing in 1913, eleven years after Mommsen's Nobel prize, gives us this evaluation of his Römisches Geschichte: \"Its sureness of touch, its many-sided knowledge, its throbbing vitality and the Venetian colouring of its portraits left an ineffaceable impression on every reader.\" \"It was a work of genius and passion, the creation of a young man, and is as fresh and vital to-day as when it was written.\"[9] About the History of Rome another British historian Arnold J. Toynbee in 1934 wrote, at the beginning of his own 12-volume universal history, \"Mommsen wrote a great book, [Römisches Geschichte], which certainly will always be reckoned among the masterpieces of Western historical literature.\"[10]\n\nMommsen had not been nominated for the prize in 1901, making it the first rare occasion when an author have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature the same year they were first nominated.[11] In total, the Swedish Academy received 44 nominations for 34 writers, including the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy (four nominations), British philosopher Herbert Spencer (one nomination), and Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen (one nomination).[12]\n\nThe authors Philip James Bailey, Samuel Butler, Ethna Carbery, Mary Hartwell Catherwood, Francisco Javier de Burgos, Alice Marie Durand (known as Henry Gréville), Ernst Dümmler, Samuel Rawson Gardiner, Bret Harte, Annie French Hector, George Alfred Henty, Grace Hinsdale, Lionel Johnson, Heinrich Landesmann, William McGonagall, Ljubomir Nedić, Frank R.

While praising Mommsen's work in a 1902 article in Ord och Bild, the Swedish professor in Intellectual history Johan Bergman wrote: \"It is and remain a flagrant injustice to not award this prize for the best literary work in ideal direction to one of the great idealists among the celebrated authors of our time, to Tolstoj or Björnson or Ibsen.\"[15] Internationally, Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg were frequently mentioned as worthy candidates for the prize.[15]"
