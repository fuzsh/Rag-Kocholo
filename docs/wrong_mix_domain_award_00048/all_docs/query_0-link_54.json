        "text": "Prize Distribution\n\nNobel Prize per Birth Country\n\nThe USA clearly dominates with the number of laureates born per country. Since the population of the USA is much higher compared to other countries on the chart, we will make further analysis on a per continent basis in order to even out the differences in population size.\n\nNobel Prize per Birth Continent\n\nFrom the charts above, it looks like people born in Europe are more likely to become a Nobel laureate with North Americans slowly catching up. But how are Nobel Prizes distributed across categories? Is there a category in which one continent is much better than the rest?\n\nWhile Europe still dominates in most categories, it looks like North America produced the most economists. The numbers may be easier to compare in a tabular format below:\n\nNobel Prize per Affiliation\n\nJust because someone was born on a certain continent that doesnât necessarily mean they are going to live on that continent indefinitely. Considering that people tend to travel more often than in the past, how do migrations affect the distribution of Nobel Prizes if we compare the number of laureates per affiliation?\n\nOn the first glance, it looks like the North American universities dominate in the number of laureates, but how does the long tail of affiliations affect the final numbers?\n\nDespite the majority of laureates being born in Europe, in 2020 North America surpassed Europe in the total number of laureates per affiliation.\n\nThis could mean only one thing: the European future laureates/scientists are migrating to work across the pond. Either there is a lack of funding/research positions in Europe, or the work conditions are just so much better in the USA.\n\nIn the past 20 years Asia is also on the rise, but this rise is concealed due to the head start of Europe and North America.\n\nCumulative affiliation charts, however, do not tell us the whole story since Literature and Peace prize affiliations are based on the laureateâs place of birth. In order to get a better view of migrations, we should check the cumulative affiliation numbers for each category separately. When and for which category did the North American affiliation takeover happen in this case?\n\nThe USA based affiliations took over in Physics in the early 2000s, in Physiology or Medicine in 1990s and in the Economic Sciences already back in the 1970s. Europe is still on top in Chemistry, Literature and Peace categories.\n\nMigrations\n\nHow many laureates born on a certain continent have decided to migrate and work in another before being awarded a Nobel Prize? If they had decided to migrate, where they have decided to go?\n\nEach box represents a continent on which the laureates were born, while the bars are showing the number of affiliations. If the laureate was affiliated with more than one continent, affiliations of both continents were increased by one. Organizations, Literature and Peace prize laureates were not included, since their affiliation defaults to their country of birth.\n\nSince migrations across continents are painting the picture with pretty broad strokes, itâs better to display the migrations on a level of a country. Which country is able to retain their people, and which country is losing them?\n\nOnly the top 15 countries, sorted by the total number of laureates, were chosen to be displayed in the migration matrix below. The numbers in the matrix represent the number of laureates, while the background color of the matrix field represents a percentage based on the number of laureates (the darker the color, the more laureates there are in that slot). Organizations, Literature and Peace prize laureates were not included, since their affiliation defaults to their country of birth.\n\nIf the country was able to retain their laureates, the color on the diagonal should be of the darkest color when comparing it to the rest of the fields in a row. This does not seem to be the case for Poland, Canada, Austria, Italy and Scotland â the majority of their laureates migrated to another country.\n\nAge\n\nAverage Age\n\nThe average age of the Nobel laureate is growing over time, from early 50-ies in 1901 to late 60-ies in 2022.\n\nThis observation could denote that breakthroughs are getting harder, as the low hanging fruit was already picked. It could also mean that with a bigger population the competition is getting fiercer, therefore one has to âstand in lineâ before their work is acknowledged as valuable.\n\nThe dots represent ages of laureates at the time when they have received the prize (this does not mean they have come up with the groundbreaking ideas at this age; that has happened earlier). Blue dots represent males, while the red dots represent females. The orange line is a regression line with a 0.95 confidence interval.\n\nAge Extremes\n\nHow old was the oldest Nobel Prize laureate? How old was the youngest Nobel Prize winner?\n\nFrom the age distribution above, it looks like the Economic Sciences, Literature and Peace laureates are in general older than those working in Physics, Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine. Considering that the average age of awarded laureates is rising over time, what is the influence of each category on the average age?\n\nAge per Category Over Time\n\nThe dots represent laureate ages at the time when they have received the prize; blue dots are males, red dots are females. The orange line represents a regression line with a 0.95 confidence interval. You can hover over each dot to see details about each laureate.\n\nThe average age of awarded laureates is rising across most categories, except for the Economic Sciences and Peace category. But just because the average age of laureates is rising across STEM categories, that doesnât necessarily mean laureates have come up with Nobel Prize worthy ideas in their late age. For this reason we should check the ages of laureates at the time when they have published their award winning papers.\n\nAs expected, most papers that ended up winning the Nobel Prize were not written by scientists in the last few years of their careers. While there are some outliers (marked with circles), the majority of laureates wrote their award winning papers in their early thirties to late forties â an age that is considered a prime working age for most of the population.\n\nThis is a rather surprising discovery, since there are many theories claiming how scientists peak early in their life, when in reality they are not that much different compared to the rest of their peers.\n\nItâs also interesting to note how laureates working in Physics tend to be around 10 years younger in comparison to the ones working in the other two disciplines. Does this mean that Physics is more open to new ideas, while Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine tend to be more conservative fields where more reputation is needed?\n\nReasons Behind the Laureates Age Increase\n\nWhat could possibly affect increase of the average age of Nobel laureates over time? If the problems are getting harder, that should also be reflected in the increasing ages of laureates at the time of publication, as one would need more experience before their work would be considered novel and important.\n\nBoth Physics and Chemistry laureateâs publication age has increased by around 10 years, whereas in the case of Physiology or Medicine it stayed more or less constant. But how do we distinguish between the problems becoming harder to solve and the competition for the Nobel Prize getting fiercer?\n\nWe can compare the duration between publishing the prize winning paper and being awarded the Nobel Prize over time. If this ârecognition durationâ is increasing over time that would imply that with more people working in the field you have to wait longer before itâs your turn for getting the prize. On the other hand, if recognition duration is more or less constant over time (while we know that the average age of laureates is increasing), that simply means the problems are becoming harder to solve.\n\nJudging from the charts, it looks like there are no obvious patterns between publication year and the number of years one had to wait in order to be awarded a Nobel Prize (the confidence band of a regression line is wide). This means that Nobel Prize worthy problems are indeed becoming harder to solve.\n\nTo get a better feeling of the distribution of laureateâs recognition durations, we can also take a look at the histogram below:\n\nLife Expectancy\n\nCompared to the average life expectancy numbers of continents in which the Nobel laureates have worked in, how well do the laureates fare in this department?\n\nWe assume that laureates who died on a certain continent also lived there at least for the last part of their life, therefore the average life expectancy of the continent of their death applies to them. We are comparing the life expectancy of laureates who died between 1950-2019, see Data Sources for more info.\n\nThe black line represents the average life expectancy for the continent. The orange line represents a regression line for laureatesâ ages of death with a 0.95 confidence interval.\n\nAcross all continents the Nobel Prize laureates are expected to live above the average life expectancy of the continent in which they worked and lived. But how is the age of death spread across categories? Are chemists living longer than say physicists?\n\nThe chart is showing the regression lines of ages of death for every Nobel Prize category of both Europe and North America. Other continents are not displayed, since they donât have enough laureates to display meaningful regression lines.\n\nEurope\n\nChemistry (92)\n\nPhysiology or Medicine (91)\n\nEconomic Sciences (91)\n\nPhysics (89)\n\nLiterature (87)\n\nPeace (84)\n\nNorth America\n\nPhysiology or Medicine (92)\n\nEconomic Sciences (92)\n\nPhysics (91)\n\nLiterature (87)\n\nChemistry (87)\n\nPeace (86)"
