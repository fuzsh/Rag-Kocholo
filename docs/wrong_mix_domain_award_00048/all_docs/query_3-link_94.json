Important duties of another kind, to which I was called after completing the third volume, rendered it necessary that I should defer for a time the further prosecution of the work, and occasioned much interruption to its progress after I had resumed it. But I considered it due to those who had so favourably received the earlier volumes of my translation that I should endeavour personally to complete i t ; and I can only cast myself on their indulgence if I have somewhat unduly taxed their patience. The delay has enabled me to compare the sheets with the fourth edition of the German, issued in the present year. I have adhered substantially to the same principles of translation as in the earlier volumes, endeavouring to retain as much of the form and manner of the original as seemed compatible with a due regard to English idiom, and even venturing in some cases to have less regard to the latter than to the desirableness of reproducing Dr. IN\n\nPRESENTING\n\nBrefaciory\n\nvi\n\nNote.\n\nMommsen's meaning without paraphrase. Readers conversant with the original will in many passages miss not a little of its characteristic force; but they will also, I doubt not, be ready to acknowledge that the task of the translator is attended with peculiar difficulty in those cases where D r . Mommsen for the more emphatic expression of his meaning makes use—often with great felicity—of words and phrases, the English equivalents of which have not as yet passed into literary currency. In the latter portion of the volume I have deemed it sufficient to give the value of the Roman money approximately in round numbers, assuming for that purpose 100 sesterces as equivalent to £1.

There were, moreover, the PopDemocrats. , ulares strictly so called, the honest and credulous\n\nlé\n\nMarcus\n\nL&pidus\n\n[BOOK\n\nV\n\nnarrow-minded radicals, who staked property and life for the current watchwords of the party-programme, only to discover with painful surprise after the victory that they had been fighting not for a reality, but for a phrase. Their special aim was to re-establish the tribunician power, which Sulla had not abolished but had divested of its most essential prerogatives, and which exercised over the multitude a charm all the more mysterious because the institution had no obvious practical use and was in fact an empty phantom —the mero name of tribune of the people, more than a thousand years later, revolutionized Rome. There were, above all, the numerous and important classes whom the Sullan restoration had left unsatisfied, or whose political or Transpaprivate interests it had directly injured. Among danes. those who for such reasons belonged lo the opposition ranked the dense and prosperous population of the region between the P o and the Alps, which naturally regarded the bestowal of Latin rights in 665 (iii„ 3 0 0 ) as merely an instalment of the full Roman franchise, and so afforded a ready soil for agitation. T o this category belonged also the freedmen, influential in numbers and wealth, and specially dangerous through their aggregation in the capital, who could not brook their having been reduced by the restoration to their earlier, practically useless, suffrage. In the same position stood, moreover, the great capitalcapitalists. maintained a cautious silence, but still as before preserved their tenacity of resentment and their equal tenacity of power.

I . ]\n\nAnd Quintus Sertoriu-8.\n\n15\n\nsuspended over them by the Roman people; or, as was the case in Etruria especially, were reduced to be beggars in their former abodes, or robbers in the \"woods. Finally, the The proagitation extended to the whole family connectMr8ad-na tions and freedmen of those democratic chiefs herents. who had lost their lives in consequence of the restoration, or who were wandering along the Mauretanian coasts, or sojourning at the court and in the army of Mithradates, in all the misery of emigrant exile; for, according to the strict family associations that governed the political feeling of this age, it was accounted a point of honour* that those who were left behind should endeavour to procure for exiled relatives the privilege of returning to their native land, and, in the case of the dead, at least a removal of the stigma attaching to their memory and to their children, and a restitution to the latter of their paternal estate. More especially the immediate children of the proscribed, whom the regent had reduced in point of law to political Pariahs (iii. 422), had virtually received from the law itself a summons to rise in rebellion against the existing order of things. To all these sections of the opposition there was added the whole body of men of ruined fortunes. All Men of ruined the rabble high and low, whose means and substance had been spent in refined or in vulgar debauchery; the aristocratic lords, who had no farther mark of quality than their debts; the Sullan soldiers whom the regent's fiat could transform into landholders but not into husbandmen, and who, after squandering the first inheritance of the proscribed, were longing to succeed to a second —all these waited only the unfolding of the'banner which invited them to fight against the existing order of things, Men of whatever else might be inscribed on it.

On the advocates' platform in particular—the only field of legal opposition left open by Sulla—-even in the regent's lifetime such aspirants waged lively war against the restoration with the weapons of formal jurisprudence and clever oratory : for instance, the adroit speaker Marcus Tullius Cicero (born 3rd J a n u a r y , 648), son of a landholder of Arpinum, speedily made himself a name by the mingled caution and daring of his opposition to the dictator. Such efforts were not of much importance, if the opponent desired nothing farther than by their means to procure for himself a cur ale chair, and then to sit in it contentedly for the 'est of his life. N o doubt, if this chair should not satisfy a popular man and Gaius Gracchus should find a successor, a struggle for life or death was inevitable; but for the present at least no name could be mentioned the hearer of which had proposed to himself any such lofty aim. Such, was the sort of opposition with which the oligarchic Power of government instituted by Sulla had to contend, theopposi-when it had, earlier than Sulla himself probably expected, been thrown by his death on its own resources. The task was in itself far from easy, and it was farther complicated b y the other social and political evils of this age—especially by the extraordinary double difficulty of keeping the military chiefs in the provinces in subjection to the supreme civil magistracy, and of dealing with the masses of the Italian and extra-Italian populace accumulating in the capital and of the slaves living there to a great extent in de facto freedom, without having troops at disposal. The senate was placed, as it were, in a fortress exposed and threatened on all sides, and serious conflicts\n\nCHAP. I ]\n\nAnd\n\n{Quintas\n\nSertorius.\n\n17\n\ncould not be avoided. But the means of resistance organ ized by Sulla were considerable and lasting; and, although the majority of the nation was manifestly disinclined to the government which Sulla had installed, and even animated by hostile feelings towards it, that government might very well maintain itself for a long time in its stronghold against the distracted and confused mass of an opposition which was not agreed either as to end or means, was without a head, and was broken up into a hundred fragments. Only it was necessary that it should be determined to maintain its position, and should bring at least a spark of the energy •which had built the fortress to its defence; for in the case of a garrison which will not defend itself, the greatest master of fortification constructs his walls and moats in vain. The more everything ultimately depended on the perWant of sonal character of the leading men on both sides, leaders. ^ e m o r e unfortunate that both, strictly w a g speaking, wanted leaders. The politics of this period were Coteriethoroughly under the sway of the coterie-system, system. in its worst form. . This, indeed, was nothing n e w ; close unions of families and clubs were inseparable from an aristocratic organization of the state, and had for centuries prevailed in Rome. But it was not till this epoch that they became all-powerful, for it was only now (first in 690) that- their influence was substantiated 64» rather than checked by legal measures of repression. All persons of quality, those of popular leanings no less than the oligarchy proper, met in Hetaeriae; the mass of the burgesses likewise, so far as they took any regular part in political events at all, formed according to their voting-districts close unions with an almost military organization, which found their natural captains and agents in the \" district-distributors \" (divisores tribuum). With these political clubs everything was bought and sold ; the vote of the elector especially, but also the votes of the senator and the judge, the fists too which produced the street riot, and the ringleaders who directed it. The as-\n\n18\n\nMarcas\n\nLepidus\n\n[BOOK\n\nV -\n\nsociations of the upper and of the lower classes were distinguished merely in the matter of tariff. The Hetaeria decided the elections, the Hetaeria decreed the impeachments, the Hetaeria conducted the defence; it secured the distinguished advocate, and in case of need it contracted for an acquittal with one of the speculators who prosecuted on a great scale the lucrative traffic in judges' votes. The Hetaeria commanded by its compact hands the streets of the capital, and with the capital but too often the state. All these things were, done in accordance with a certain rule, and, so to speak, publicly ; the system of Hetaeriae was better arranged and managed than any branch of state administration; although there was. as is usual among civilized swindlers, a tacit understanding that there should be 110 direct mention of the nefarious proceedings, nobody made a secret of them, and advocates of repute were not ashamed to give open and intelligible hints of their relation to the Hetaeriae of their clients. If an individual was to be found here or there who kept aloof from such practices and yet mingled in public life, he was assuredly, like Marcus Cato, a political Don Quixote. Parties and party-strife were superseded by the clubs and their rivalry; government was superseded by intrigue. A more than equivocal character, Pubiius Cethegus, formerly one of the most zealous Marians, afterwards as a deserter received into favour by Sulla (iii. 400), acted a most influential part in the political proceedings of this period—unrivalled as a cunning tale-bearer and mediator between the sections of the senate and as having a statesman's acquaintance with the secrets of all cabals : at times the appointment to the most important posts of command was decided by a word from his mistress Praecia. Such a plight was only possible where none of the men taking part in politics rose above mediocrity: any man of more than ordinary talent would have swept away this system of factions like cobwebs ; but there was in reality a sad lack of men of political or military capacity. Of the older generation the civil wars had left not a\n\nCHAP. I ]\n\nAnd Quintus Sertorius.\n\n19\n\nsingle man of repute except the old shrewd and eloquent Lucius Philippus, consul in 663, who^ formerly of popular leanings (in. 170), thereafter leader of the capitalist party against the senate (iii. 271), and closely associated with the Marians (iii. 392), and lastly passing over to the victorious oligarchy in sufficient time to earn thanks and commendation (iii. 399), jtfeteiius had managed to escape between the parties, t,lje the^ncuiii. Among ^ e m e n ' following generation the most notable chiefs of the pure aristocracy were Quintus Metellus Pius, consul in 674, Sulla's comrade in dangers and victories; Quintus Lutatius Catulus, consul in the year of Sulla's death, 676, the 7g son of the victor of Vercellae; and two younger officers, the brothers Lucius and Marcus Lucullus, of whom the former had fought with distinction under Sulla in Asia, the latter in Italy ; not to mention Optimates 114-50 like Quintus Hortensius (640-704), who had importance only as a pleader, or men like Decimus Junius Brutus, consul in 677, Mamercus Aernilius 77. . . Lepidus Livianus consul in 677 and other such nullities, whose best quality was a euphonious aristocratic name. But even those four men rose little above the average calibre of the Optimates of this age. Catulus was like his father a man of refined culture and an honest aristocrat, but of moderate talents and no soldier. Metellus was not merely estimable in his personal character, but an able and experienced officer; and it was not so much on account of his close relations as a kinsman and colleague with the regent as because of his recognized ability that he was sent in 675, after resigning the consulship, to Spain, where the Lusitanians and the Roman emigrants under Quintus Sertorius had begun fresh movements. The two Luculli were also able officers—particularly the elder, who combined very respectable military talents with thorough literary culture and a liking for authorship, and appeared honourable also as a man. But, as statesmen, even these better aristocrats were not much less remiss and-\n\n20\n\nMarcus\n\nLepìdus\n\n[BOOK V .\n\nshortsighted than the average senators of the time. In presence of an outward foe the more eminent among them, doubtless, proved themselves useful and brave; but no one of them evinced the desire or the skill to solve the problems of politics proper, and to guide the vessel of the state through the stormy seas of intrigue and faction with the hand of a true pilot. Their political wisdom was limited to a sincere belief in the oligarchy as the sole means of salvation, and to a cordial hatred and courageous execration of demagogism as well as of every individual authority which sought to emancipate itself. Their petty ambition was contented with little. The stories told of Metellus in Spain —that he not only allowed himself to be delighted with the far from harmonious lyre of the Spanish occasional poets, but even wherever he went had himself received like a god with libations of wine and odours of incense, and at table had his head crowned by descending Victories amidst theatrical thunder with the golden laurel of the conqueror— are no better attested than most historical anecdotes; but such gossip reflects the degenerate ambition of the race of Epigoni. Even the better men were content when they had gained not power and influence, but the consulship and a triumph and a place of honour in the senate; and at the very time when with right ambition they would have just begun to be truly useful to their country and their party, they retired from the political stage to spend their days in princely luxury. Men like Metellus and Lucius Lucullus were, even as generals, not more attentive to the enlargement of the Roman dominion by fresh conquests of kings and peoples than to the enlargement of the endless game, poultry, and dessert lists of Roman gastronomy by new delicacies from Africa and Asia Minor, and they wasted the best part of their lives in more or less intellectual idleness. The traditional aptitude and the individual self-denial, on which all oligarchic government is based, were lost in the decayed and artificially restored Roman aristocracy of this age; in its judgment universally the spirit of clique was accounted as patriotism, vanity as ambition, and narrow-\n\nCHAP. I . ]\n\nAnd Quintus Sertorius.\n\n2,1\n\nminded ness as consistency. Had the Sullan constitution passed into the guardianship of such men as have sat in the Roman College of Cardinals or the Venetian Council of Ten, we cannot tell whether the opposition would have been able to shake it so soon; with such defenders every attack involved, at all events, a serious peril. Of the men, who were neither unconditional adherents nor open opponents o f the Sullan constitution, Pompeius.\n\nn i\n\nno one attracted more the eyes or the multitude than the young Gnaeus Pompeius, who was at the time of Sulla's death twenty-eight years of age (born 29th September, 648). The fact was a misfortune for the admired as well as for the admirers ; but it was natural. Sound in body and spirit, an excellent athlete, who even when a superior officer vied, with his soldiers in leaping, running, and lifting, a vigorous and skilled rider and fencer, a bold leader of volunteer bands, the youth had. become imperator and triumphator at an age which excluded him from every magistracy and from the senate, and had acquired the first place next to Sulla in public opinion; nay, had obtained from the indulgent regent himself—half in recognition, half in irony—the surname of the Great. Unhappily, his mental endowments by no means corresponded with these unprecedented successes. He was neither a bad nor an incapable man, but a man thoroughly ordinary, created by nature to be a good sergeant, called by circumstances to be a general and a statesman. An intelligent,, brave and experienced, thoroughly excellent soldier, he was still, even in his military capacity, without trace of any higher gifts. It was characteristic of him as a general,, as well as in other respects, to proceed with a caution bordering on timidity, and, if possible, to give the decisive blow only when he had established an immense superiority over his opponent. His culture was the average culture of the time ; although entirely a soldier, he did not neglect, when he went to Rhodes, dutifully to admire and to make presents to the rhetoricians there. His integrity was that of a rich man who manages with discretion his considerable\n\n22\n\nMarcus\n\nLepidus\n\n[BOOK Y .\n\nproperty inherited and acquired. He disdained not to make money in the usual senatorial way, but he was too cold and too rich to incur special risks, or draw down on himself conspicuous disgrace, on that account. The vice so much in vogje among his contemporaries, rather than any virtue of his own, procured for him the reputation—comparatively, no doubt, well warranted—of integrity and disinterestedness. His \" honest countenance \" became almost proverbial, and even after his death he was esteemed as a worthy ar.d moral man: he was really a good neighbour, who did not join in the revolting schemes by which the grandees of that age extended the bounds of their domains through forced sales or measures still worse at the expense of their humbler neighbours, and in domestic life he displayed attachment to his wife and children : it redounds moreover to his credit that he was the first to depart from the barbarous custom of putting to death the captive kings and generals of the enemy after they had been exhibited in triumph. But this did not prevent him from separating from his beloved wife at the command of his lord and master Sulla, because she belonged to an. outlawed family, nor from ordering with great composure that men who had stood by him and helped him in times of difficulty should be executed before his eyes at the nod of the same master (iii. 414): he was not cruel, though he was reproached with being so, but—what perhaps was worse—he was cold and, in good as in evil, unimpassioned. In the tumult of battle he faced the enemy fearlessly ; in civil life he was a shy man, whose cheek flushed on the slightest occasion; he spoke in public not without embarrassment, and generally was angular, stiff, and awkward in intercourse. With all his haughty obstinacy he was—as indeed persons ordinarily are, who make a display of their independence—a pliant tool in the hands of men who knew how to manage him, especially of his freedmen and clients, by whom he had no fear of being controlled. For nothing was he less qualified than for a statesman. Uncertain as to his aims, unskilful in the choice of his means alike in little and great matters shortsighted\n\nCHAP. I . ]\n\nAnd\n\nQuintus\n\nSertoHus.\n\n23\n\nand helpless, he was wont to conceal his irresolution and indecision under a solemn silence, and, when he thought to play a subtle game, simply to deceive himself with the belief that he was deceiving others. By his military position and his territorial connections he acquired almost without any action of his own a considerable party personal!/ devoted to him, with which the greatest things might have been accomplished; but Pompeius was in every respect incapable of leading and keeping together a party, and, if it still kept together, it did so—-in like manner without his action—through the sheer force of circumstances. In this, as in other things, he reminds us of Marius ; but Marius, with his nature of boorish roughness and sensual passion, was still less intolerable than this most tiresome and most starched of all artificial great men. His political position was utterly perverse. H e was a Sullan officer and under obligation to serve the restored constitution, and yet again in opposition to Sulla personally as well as to the whole senatorial government. The gens of the Pompeii, which had only been named for some sixty years in the consular lists, had by, no means acquired full standing in the eyes of the aristocracy ; the father of this Pompeius had occupied a very invidious equivocal position towards the senate (iii. 326, 387), and he himself had once been in the ranks of the Cinnans (iii. 400)—recollections which were suppressed perhaps, but not forgotten. The prominent position which Pompeius acquired under Sulla set him at inward variance with the aristocracy, quite as much as it brought him into outward connection with it. Weak-headed as he was, Pompeius was seized with giddiness on the height of glory which he had climbed with such dangerous rapidity and ease. Just as if he wished to ridicule his dry prosaic nature by the parallel with the mosfe'poetical of all heroic figures, he began to compare himself with Alexander the Great, and to account himself a man of unique standing, whom it did not beseem to be merely one of the five hundred senators of Rome. In reality, no one was more fitted to take bis place as a member of an aristocratic régime than Pompeius.\n\n24\n\nMareros Lepidus\n\n[BOOK\n\n'V.\n\nHis dignified outward appearance, his solemn formality, his persona] bravery., his decorous private life, his want of all initiative might have gained for him, had he been born two hundred years earlier, an honorable place by the side of Quintus Maximus and Publius Decius : this mediocrity, so characteristic of the genuine Optimate and the genuine Roman, contributed not a little to the special affinity which subsisted at all times between Pompeius and the mass of the burgesses and the senate. Even in his own age he would have had a definite and respectable position, had he contented himself with being the general of the senate—the office for which he was from the beginning o destined. With © this he was not content, and so he fell into the fatal plight of wishing to be something else than he could be. H e was constantly aspiring to a special position in the state, and, when it offered itself, he could not make up his mind to occupy i t ; he was deeply indignant when persons and laws did not bend unconditionally before him, and yet he everywhere bore himself with no mere affectation of modesty as one of many peers, and trembled at the mere thought of undertaking anything unconstitutional. Thus constantly at fundamental variance with, and yet at the same time the obedient servant of, the oligarchy, constantly tormented by an ambition which was frightened at its own aims, his deeply agitated life passed joylessly away in a perpetual inward contradiction. Marcus Crassus cannot, any more than Pompeius, be reckoned among the unconditional adherents of the oligarchy. H e is a personage highly characteristic of this epoch. Like Pompeius, whose senior he was by a few years, he belonged to the circle of the high Roman aristocracy, had obtained the usual culture befitting his rank, and had fought like Pompeius with distinction under Sulla in the Italian war. F a r inferior to many of his peers in mental gifts, literary culture, and military talent, he outstripped them by his boundless activity, and by the perseverance with which he strove to possess all things and to become all-important. Above all, he threw himself into\n\nCHAP. I . ]\n\n.And Quintus\n\nSertoriw.\n\n25\n\nspeculation. Purchases of estates during the revolution formed the foundation of his wealth; but he disdained no: branch of gain ; he carried on thé business of building in the capital on an extensive scale and with prudence; he entered into partnership With his freedmen in the most varied undertakings ; he acted as banker both in and out of Rome, in person or by his agents ; he advanced' money to his colleagues in the senate, and undertook—as it might happen—to execute works or to bribe the tribunals on their account. He was far from nice in the matter of making profit. On occasion of the Sullan proscriptions a forgery in the lists had been proved against him, for which reason Sulla made no more use of him thenceforward in affairs of state : he did not refuse to accept a;n inheritance, because the testamentary document which contained his name was notoriously forged ; he made no objection, when his bailiffs by force or by fraud dislodged the petty holders from lands which adjoined his own. He avoided open collisions, however, with criminal justice, and lived himself like a genuine moneyed man in homely and simple style. In this way Crassus rose in the course of a few years from a man of ordinary senatorial fortuné to bé the master of wealth which not long before his death, after defraying enormous extraordinary expenses, still amounted to 170,000,000 sesterces (£1,700,000). He had become the richest of Romans and thereby, at the same time, a great political power. If, according to his expression, no one might call himself rich who could not maintain an army from his' revenues, one who could do this was hardly any longer a mere citizen. In reality the views of Crassus aimed at a higher object than the possession of the fullest money-chest in Rome; He grudged no pains to extend his connections. He knew how to salute by name every burgess of the capital. He refused to no suppliant his assistance in court. Nature, indeed, had not done much for him as an orator : his speaking was dry, his delivery monotonous, he had difficulty of hearing ; but his pertinacity, which no wearisomeness deterred and no enjoyment distracted, overcame\n\nVOL. IV.—2\n\n26\n\nMarcus\n\nLepiäm\n\n[BOOK\n\nV,\n\nsuch obstacles. H e never appeared unprepared, he never extemporized, and so he became a pleader at all times in request and at all times ready; to whom it was no derogation that a cause was rarely too bad for him, and that he knew how to influence the judges not merely by his oratory, but also by his connections and, if necessary, by his gold. Half the senate was indebted to him ; his habit of advancing to \" friends \" money without interest revocable at pleasure rendered a number of influential men dependent on him, and the more so that, like a genuine man of business, he made no distinction of parties, maintained connections on all hands, and readily lent to every one able to pay or otherwise useful. The most daring party-leaders, who made their attacks recklessly in all directions, were careful not to quarrel with Crassus; he was compared to the bull of the herd, whom it was advisable for none to provoke. That such a man, so situated, could not strive after lowly aims is clear; and, in a very different way from Pompeius, Crassus knew exactly like a banker the objects and the means of political speculation. F r o m the origin of Rome capital was a political power there; the age was of such a sort, that everything seemed accessible to gold as to iron. If in the time of revolution a capitalist aristocracy might have thought of overthrowing the oligarchy of the gentes, a man like Crassus might raise his eyes higher than to the fasces and embroidered mantle of the triumphators. F o r the moment he was a Sullan and adherent of the senate; but he was too much of a financier to devote himself to a definite political party, or to pursue aught than his personal advantage. W h y should Crassus, the wealthiest and most intriguing man in Rome, and no penurious miser but a speculator on the greatest scale, not speculate also on the crown? Alone, perhaps, he could not attain this object.; but he had already carried out many great transactions in partnership; it was not impossible that for this also a suitable partner might present himself. It is a trait characteristic of the time, that a mediocre orator and officer, a politician who took his activity for energy and his covet-\n\nAnd Quintus Sertorius.\n\nCHAP. I . ]\n\n27\n\nousness for ambition, one who at bottom had nothing but a colossal fortune and the mercantile talent of forming connections—that such a man, relying on the omnipotence of coteries and intrigues, could deem himself on a level with the first generals and statesmen of his day, and could contend with them for the highest prize which allures political ambition. i In the opposition proper, both among the liberal conLeaders of servatives and among the Populares, the storms the demAmong0 G f revolution had made fearful havoc. oerats.\n\nthe former, the only surviving man of note was\n\n124—73\n\nGaius Cotta (630—c. 681), the friend and ally of Drusus and as such banished in 663 (iii. 287), and then by Sulla's victory brought back to his native land (iii. 433); he was a shrewd man and an efficient advocate, but not called, either by the weight of his party or by that of his personal standing, to act more than a respectable secondary part. In the democratic party, among the rising Caesar youth, Gaius Julius Caesar, who was twenty-four 102.

(J. ii. 149) he was at his death (15 March, 710) in his 56th y e a r ; with which also the statement that he was 18 years old at the time o f the Sullan proscription ( 6 i 2 ; Y e l l . ii. 4 1 ) nearly accords. ly 65. 62.\n\ninconsistent\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nfacts\n\nBut this view is utterthat\n\nCaesar\n\nfilled\n\nthe\n\naedileship in 689, the praetorship in 692-, and the consul-\n\n59.\n\n. ship in 695, and that these offices could, according t o the\n\nleges annqles,\n\nbe held at the v e r y earliest in the 37-38th,\n\n40-41st, and 43-44th years o f a man's life respectively ( B e c k e r ii. 2, 24).\n\nW e cannot conceive why Caesar should have filled all the curule\n\noffices t w o years before the legal time, and still less w h y there should b e no mention anywhere o f his having done s o ; these facts rather suggest the conjecture that, as his birthday fell undoubtedly on July 12, he was born not in 654, but in 652 ; so that in 6*72 he 100-\n\n1\n\n'\n\nwas in his 20-21st year, and he died not in his 56th year, but at the age o f 57 years 8 months.\n\nI n f a v o u r of\n\nthis\n\nlatter v i e w w e may m o r e o v e r adduce the circumstance, which has been\n\npaene puer\n\nstrangely brought forward in opposition to it, that Caesar u\n\n28\n\nMarcus\n\nLi-pi\n\ndus\n\n[BOOK V .\n\nwards him the eyes of friend and foe.

Nor is it so-rash as it appears to us who are accustomed t o regular and official lists of births, to charge our authorities with an error in this respect. Those four statements may very well be all traceable to a common source ; n o r can they at all lay claim to any very high credibility, seeing that for the earlier period before the commencement of the acta diarna t h e s t a t e m e n t s as to t h e n a t a l years of even the best known and most prominent Romans, e„ g,, as to t h a t of Pompeius, vary in t h e most surprising manner.

B u t the first assertion rests on a m i s t a k e ; for, as t h e example of Cicero shows, t h e lex annalis required only that at t h e entering on office t h e 43d year should be begun, n o t t h a t it should be completed. N o n e of t h e alleged exceptions to t h e rule, moreover, a r e pertinent.

Once a zealous Optimate, and a large purchaser at the auctions of the proscribed estates, he had, as governor of Sicily, so scandalously plundered the province that he was threatened with impeachment, and, to evade it, threw himself into opposition. It was a gain of doubtful value. No doubt the opposition thus acquired a well-known name, a man of quality, a vehement orator in the Forum ; but Lepidus was an insignificant and indiscreet personage, who did not deserve to become a leader either in council or in the field. Nevertheless the opposition welcomed him, and the new leader of the democrats succeeded not only in deterring his accusers from prosecuting the attack which they had begun, but also in carrying his election to the consulship for 676; in which he was helped not only by the treasures exacted in Sicily, but also by the foolish endeavour of Pompeius to show Sulla and the pure Sullans on this occasion what he could do. Now that the opposition had, on the death of Sulla, found a head once more in Lepidus, and now that this their leader had become the supreme magistrate of the state, the speedy outbreak of the new revolution in the capital might with certainty be foreseen. But even before the democrats moved in the capital, the democratic emigrants had again bestirred themTne emi° °\n\nj\n\ngrants in selves in Spain. The soul of this movement Sertorius. was Quintus Sertorius. This eminent man, a native of Nursia in the Sabine land, was from the first of a tender and even soft-hearted temperament—as his almost enthusiastic love for his mother, Raia, shows—and at the same time of the most chivalrous bravery, as was proved by the honourable scars which he brought home from the Cimbrian, Spanish, and Italian wars. Although wholly\n\nCHAP. I . ]\n\nAnd Qulnius\n\nSertorius.\n\n31\n\nuntrained as a speaker, he excited the admiration of learned advocates by the natural flow and the striking precision of his address. His remarkable military and statesmanly talent had found opportunity of shining; by contrasts more particularly in the revolutionary war which the democrats so wretchedly and stupidly mismanaged; he was confessedly the only democratic officer who knew how to prepare and to conduct war, and the only democratic statesman who opposed the insensate and furious doings of his party with statesmanlike energy. His Spanish soldiers called him the new Hannibal, and this not merely because he had, like that hero, lost an eye in war. He in reality reminds us of the great Phoenician by his equally cunning and courageous strategy, by his rare talent of organizing war by means of war, by his adroitness in attracting foreign nations to his interest and making them serviceable to his ends, by his prudence in success and misfortune, by the quickness of his ingenuity in turning to good account his victories and averting the consequences of his defeats. It may be doubted whether any Roman statesman of the earlier period, or of the present, can be compared in point of universal talent to Sertorius. After Sulla's generals had compelled him to quit Spain (iii. 414), he had led a restless life of adventure along the Spanish and African coasts, sometimes in league, sometimes at war, with the Cilician pirates who haunted these seas and with the chieftains of the wandering tribes of Libya. The victorious Roman restoration had pursued him even thither: when he besieged Tingis (Tañgiers), a corps under Pacciaecus from Roman Africa had appeared to help the prince of the town; but Pacciaecus was totally defeated and Tingis was taken by Sertorius. On the report of such achievements by the Roman refugee spreading abroad, the Lusitanians, who, notwithstanding their pretended submission to the Roman supremacy, practically maintained their independence and annually fought with the governors of Further Spain, sent envoys to Sertorius in Africa, to invite him to their country and to commit to Kinv the command of their militia.\n\n32\n\nMarcus Lepidus\n\n[BOOK V .\n\nSertorius, who twenty years .before had served under Titus Didius in Spain and knew the resources outbreak Q f j-]ie land, resolved to comply with the invitaof the Spanish ti o r i j a n ( j leaving behind him a small detachRenewed\n\nmsurrec °\n\ntion. ment on the Maaretanian coast, embarked for 80 Spain (about 674). The straits separating Spain and Africa were occupied by a Roman squadron commanded by Cotta; to steal through it was impossible; so Sertorius fought his way through and succeeded in reaching the Lusitanians. There were not more than twenty Lusitanian communities that placed themselves under his orders; and of \" R o m a n s \" he mustered only 2,600 men, a considerable part of whom were deserters from the army of Pacciaecus or Africans armed after the Roman style. Sertorius saw that everything depended oil his associating with the loose swarms of guerillas a strong nucleus of troops possessing Roman organization and discipline : for this end he reinforced the band which he had brought with him by levying 4,000 infantry and 700 cavalry, and with this one legion and the swarms of Spanish volunteers advanced against the Romans. The command in Further Spain was held by Lucius Fufidius, who through his absolute devotion to Sulla—so well-tried amidst the proscriptions—had risen from a subaltern to be propraetor; he was totally defeated on the Baetis; 2,000 Romans covered the field of battle. Messengers in all haste summoned the governor of the adjoining province of the Ebro, Marcus Domitms Calvinus, to check the farther advance of the Sertorians; and there soon appeared (675) also the experienced general Qirintus Metellus, sent by Sulla to relievo senttoUS the incapable Fufidius in southern Spain. But Spam. ^ n o t s u c c e e c ] } n mastering the revolt. In the Ebro province not only was the army of Calvinus destroyed and he himself slain by Sertorius' lieutenant, the quaestor Lucius Hirtuleius, but Lucius Manlius, the governor of Transalpine Gaul, who had crossed the Pyrenees with three legions to help his colleague, was totally defeated bv the same brave leader. With difficulty Manlius escaped\n\nCHAP. I. ]\n\nAnd Q uint us Sertorius.\n\n33\n\nwith a few men to Ilerda (Lerida) and thence to his pro* vince, losing on the march his whole baggage through a sudden attack of the Aquitanian tribes. In Further Spain Metellus penetrated into the Lusitanian territory; but Sertorius succeeded during the siege of Longobriga (not far from the mouth of the Tagus) in alluring a division under Aquinus into an ambush, and thus compelling Metellus himself to raise the siege and to evacuate the Lusitanian territory. Sertorius followed him, defeated on the Anas (Guadiana) the corps of Thorius, and inflicted vast damage by guerilla warfare on the army of the commanderin-chief himself. Metellus, a methodical and somewhat clumsy tactician, was in despair as to this opponent, who obstinately declined a decisive battle, but cut off his supplies and communications and constantly hovered round him on all sides. These extraordinary successes obtained by Sertorius in the two Spanish . Orgamzar rprovinces were the more sigo tionsof . nificant, that they were not achieved merely by Sertorius. ^ J J arms and were not of a mere military nature. The emigrants as such were not formidable; nor were isolated successes of the Lusitanians under this or that foreign leader of much moment. But with the most decided political and patriotic tact Sertorius acted, whenever he could do so, not as condottiere of the Lusitanians in revolt against Rome, but as Roman general and governor of Spain, in which capacity he had in fact been sent thither by the former rulers. H e began* to form the heads of the emigration into a senate, which was to increase to 300 members and to conduct affairs and to nominate magistrates in Roman form. H e regarded his army as a Roman one, and filled the officers' posts, without exception, with Romans. W i t h reference to the Spaniards he was the governor, who by virtue of his office levied troops and other support from them ; but he was a governor w ho, in* At least the outline of these organizations must be assigned to the years 674, 675, 676, although the execution of them doubt' ' ' less belonged, m great part, only to the subsequent years. YOL.\n\nIV.—2*\n\n34\n\nMarcus Lepiäm\n\n[BOOK Y .\n\nstead of exercising the usual despotic sway, endeavoured to attach the provincials to Rome and to himself personally. His chivalrous character rendered it easy for him to enter into Spanish habits, and excited in the Spanish nobility the most ardent enthusiasm for the wonderful foreigner who had a spirit so kindred with their own. According to the warlike custom of personal following which subsisted in Spain as among the Celts and the Germans, thousands of the noblest Spaniards swore to stand faithfully by their Roman general unto death; and in them Sertorius found more trustworthy comrades than in his countrymen and party-associates. He did not disdain to turn to account the superstition of the ruder Spanish tribes, and to have his plans of war brought to him as commands of Diana by the white fawn of the goddess. Throughout he exercised a righteous and gentle rule. His troops, at least so far as his eye and his arm reached, had to maintain the strictest discipline. Gentle as he generally was in punishing, he showed himself inexorable when any outrage was perpetrated by his soldiers on friendly soil. Nor was he inattentive to the permanent relief of the condition of the provincials; he reduced the tribute, and directed the soldiers to construct winter barracks for themselves, so that the oppressive burden of quartering the troops was done away and thus a source of unspeakable mischief and annoyance was stopped. F o r the children of Spaniards of quality an academy was erected at Osca (Huesca), in which they received the higher instruction usual in Rome, learning to speak Latin and Greek, and to wear the toga—a remarkable measure, which was by no means designed merely to take from the allies in as gentle a form as possible the hostages that in Spain were inevitable, but was above all an emanation from, and an advance on, the great project of Gaius Gracchus and the democratic party for gradually Romanizing the provinces. It was the first attempt to accomplish their Romanization not by extirpating the old inhabitants and filling their places with Italian emigrants, but by Latinizing the provincials themselves. The Optimates in Rome sneered at\n\nCHAP. I - ]\n\nAnd Quintus\n\nSertorius.\n\n35\n\nthe wretched emigrants; the runaways from the Italian army, the relics of the robber-banc! of Carbo; the sorry taunt recoiled upon its authors. The masses that had been brought into the field against Sertorius were reckoned, including the Spanish general levy, at 120,000 infantry, 2,000 archers and slingers, and 6,000 cavalry. Against this enormous superiority of force Sertorius had not only held his ground in a series of successful conflicts and victories, but had also reduced the greater part of Spain under his power. In the Further province Metellus found himself confined to the districts immediately occupied by his troops; all the tribes, who could, had taken the side of Sertorius. In the Hither province, after the victories of Hirtuleius, there no longer existed a Roman army. Emissaries of Sertorius roamed through the whole territory of Gaul; there, too, the tribes began to stir, and bands gathering together began to make the Alpine passes insecure. The sea too belonged quite as much to the insurgents as to the legitimate government, since the allies of the former—the pirates—were almost as powerful in the Spanish waters, as the Roman ships of war. At the promontory of Diana (between Valencia and Carthagena, opposite Iviqa) Sertorius established for the corsairs a fixed station, where they lay in wait for such Roman ships as were conveying supplies to the Roman maritime towns and the army, carried away or delivered goods for the insurgents, and formed their medium of intercourse with Italy and Asia Minor. The constant readiness of these men moving to and fro to carry everywhere sparks from the scene of conflagration tended in a high degree to excite apprehension, especially at a time when so much combustible matter was everywhere accumulated in the Roman empire. Amidst this state of matters the sudden death of Sulla took place (676). So long as the man lived at 7g Death of whose voice a trained and; trustworthy army of ftsTOn-Dd veterans was ready any moment to rise, the sequences. oligarchy might tolerate the almost (as it seemed) definite abandonment of the Spanish provinces to the\n\n36\n\nMarcus Lejpiclus\n\n[BOOK Y.\n\nemigrants, and the election of the leader of the opposition at home to be supreme magistrate, at all events as transient misfortunes; and in their shortsighted way, yet not wholly without reason, might cherish confidence either that the opposition would not venture to proceed to open conflict, or that, if it did venture, he who had twice saved the oligarchy would set it up a third time. Now the state of things was changed. The democratic Hotspurs in the capital, long impatient of the endless delay and inflamed by the brilliant news from Spain, urged that a blow should be struck; and Lepidus, with whom the decision at the moment lay, entered into the proposal with all the zeal of a renegade and with his own characteristic frivolity. F o r a moment it seemed as if the torch which kindled the funeral pile of the regent would also kindle civil w a r ; but the influence of Pompey and the temper of the Sallan veterans induced the opposition to let the obsequies of the regent pass over in peace. Yet all the more openly were arrangements thenceforth made for a fresh revolution. Daily the Forum msurrec\" tionof resounded with accusations against the \" m o c k lepidus.\n\n.\n\nRomulus and his executioners. The overthrow of the Sullan constitution, the revival of the distributions of corn, the reinstating of the tribunes of the people in their former position, the recall of those who were banished contrary to law, the restoration of the confiscated lands, were openly indicated by Lepidus and his adherents as the objects at which they aimed. Communications were entered into with the proscribed ; Marcus Perpenna, governor of Sicily in the days of China (iii. 414), arrived in the capital. The sons of those whom Sulla had declared guilty of treason —on whom the laws of the restoration bore with intolerable severity—and generally the more noted men of Marianviews were invited to accede. Not a few, such as the young Lucius Cinna, joined the movement; others, however, followed the example of Gains Caesar, who had returned home from Asia on receiving the accounts of the death of Sulla and of the plans of Lepidus, but after becoming more accurately acquainted with the character of the leader and of the\n\nCHAP. L ]\n\nAnd\n\nQuintus\n\nSertorius.\n\n3T\n\nmovement prudently withdrew. Carousing and recruiting went on in behalf of Lepidus in the taverns and brothels of the capital. At length a conspiracy against the new order of things was concocted among the Etruscan malcontents,* All this took place under the eyes of the government. The consul Catulus arid the more judicious Optimates urged an immediate decisive interference and suppression of the revolt in the bud; the indolent majority, however, could pot make up their minds to begin the struggle, but tried to deceive themselves as long as possible by a system, of com« promises and concessions. They yielded in respect to the corn law, and granted a limited renewal of the Graechan distribution of grain, in doing which they probably returned to the mediating regulations made in the time of the Social war; according to these not all (as according to the Sempronian law) but only a definite number—-it may be conjectured 40,000—of the poorer burgesses appear to have received the earlier largesses, as Gracchus had fixed them, of five modii monthly at the price of 6-J- usses (3d.)—a regulation which occasioned to the treasury an annual net loss of at least £40,000. f The opposition, naturally as little . * The following narrative rests substantially on the account of Licinianus, which, fragmentary as it is at this very-point, still gives important information as to the insurrection of Lepidus. f Under the year 676 Licinianus states (p. 23, Pertz; p. 42, Bonn)'; {Lepidus ?) \\le\\gem, frumentari\\arn\\ nulla resistente \\adep?] tus est, ut annon\\ae] quinqué modi popu\\lo da\\rentur, According to this account, therefore, the law of the consuls of . 681 Marcus Terentius Lueullus and Gaius Cassius Varus,i which 73 .. Cicero mentions (in Verr. iii, 70, 136; v. 21, 52), and to which also Sallust refers {Hist. iii. 61, 19 Dietscb), did not first re-establish the five modii, but only secured the largesses of grain by regulating the purchases of Sicilian corn, and perhaps made various alterations of detail. That the Sempronian law (iii. 137) allowed every burgess domiciled in Rome to share in the largesses, is certain; but this must have been subsequently departed from, for, seeing that the monthly corn of the Roman burgesses amounted to little more than 3.3,000 medimni = 198,000 modii (Cic. Verr. iii. 30, 72), only some 40,000 burgesses at that time received grain, whereas tlie number oí burgesses, domiciled in the capital was certainly far more considerable\n\n38\n\nMarcus\n\nLepidus\n\n[BOOK V .\n\nsatisfied as it was decidedly emboldened by this partial concession, displayed all the more rudeness and violence in the capital; and in Etruria, the true centre of all insurrections of the Italian proletariate, civil war already broke out; the dispossessed Faesulans resumed possession of their lost estates by force of arms, and several of the veterans settled there by Sulla perished in the tumult. The senate on learning what had occurred, resolved to send the two consuls thither, in order to raise troops and suppress the insurrection.* It was impossible to adopt a more irrational course. The senate, in presence of the insurrection, evinced its pusillanimity and its fears by the re-establishment of the corn-law; in order to be relieved from a street-riot, it furnished the notorious head of the insurrection with an army; and, when the two consuls were bound by the most solemn oath which could be contrived not to turn the arms entrusted to them against each other, it must have required the superhuman obduracy of oligarchic consciences to think, of erecting such a bulwark against the impending insurreoThis important alteration probably proceeded from the Octavian law, which introduced instead of the extravagant Sempronian amount \" a moderate largess, tolerable for the state and necessary for the common people\" (Cic. de O f f . ii. 21, 12, Brut. 62, 222 ; see vol. iii. 287), and must have been again adopted in the law of 676. The 78 ' democracy was by no means content with this (Sallust, I, c.). The amount of loss is calculated on the basis of the grain being worth at least double (iii. 137); when piracy or other causes drove up the price of grain, a far more considerable loss must have ensued. * From the fragments of the account of Licinianus (p. 44, Bonn) it is plain that the decree of the senate, uti Lepidus et Catulus decretis exercitibus rnaturrime proficiseerentur (Sallust, Hist. i. 44 Dietsch), is to be understood not of a despatch of the consuls before the expiry of their consulship to their proconsular provinces, for which there would have been no reason, but of their being sent to Etruria against the revolted Faesulans, just as in the Catilinarian war the consul Gaius Antonius was despatched to the same quarter. The statement of Philippus in Sallust (Hist. i. 48, 4) that Lepidus ob seditionem, provineiam cum exercitu adeptiis est, is entirely in harmony with this view j l'or the extraordinary consular command in Etruria was just as much a provincia as the ordinary proconsular command in Narbonese Gaul.\n\nCHAP. I . ]\n\nAnd Quintus Sertorius,\n\n39\n\ntion. Of course Lepidus armed in Etruria not for the senate, bat for the insurrection—sarcastically declaring that the oath which he had taken bound him only for the current year. The senate put the oracular machinery in motion to induce him to return, and committed to him the conduct of the impending consular elections ; but Lèpidus evaded compliance, and, while messengers passed to and fro and the official year drew to an end amidst proposals of accommodation, his force swelled to an army. When at length, in the beginning of the following year (677), the distinct injunction of the senate was issued to Lepidus to return without delay, the proconsul haughtily refused obedience, and demanded in his turn the renewal of the former tribunician power, the reinstating of those who had been forcibly ejected from their civic rights and their property, and, besides this, his own re-election as consul for the current year or, in other words, the tyrannis in legal form. Thus .war was declared. The senatorial party could Outbreak of reckon, in addition to the Sullan veterans whose the war. civil existence was threatened by Lepidus, upon the army assembled by the proconsul Catulus; and so, in. compliance with the urgent warnings of the more sagacious, particularly of Philippus, Catulus was entrusted by the senate with the defence of the capital and the repelling of the main force of the democratic party stationed in Etruria. At the same time Gnaeus Pompeius was despatched with another corps to wrest from his former protégé the valley of the Po, which was held by Lepidus' lieutenant, Marcus Brutus. While Pompeius speedily accomplished his commission and shut up the enemy's general closely in Mutina, Lepidus appeared before the capital in order to conquer it for the revolution as Marius had formerly done by storm. The right bank of the Tiber fell wholly into his power, and he was able even to cross the river. The decisive battle was fought 011 lepidus t^e Campus Martius, close under the walls defeated. But Catulus conquered ; and Le0 f the city. pidus was compelled to retreat to Etruria, \"while another division, under his son Scipio, threw itself into the fortress\n\n40\n\nMarcus Lepidus\n\n[BOOK Y .\n\nof Alba. The rising was substantially at an end.. Mutina surrendered to Pompeius; and Brutus was, notwithstanding the safe-conduct promised to him, subsequently put to death by order of that general. Alba too was, after a long siege, reduced by famine, and the leader there was likewise executed. Lepidus, pressed on two sides by Catulus and Pompeius, fought, another engagement on the coast of Etruria in order merely to procure the means of retreat, and then embarked at the port of Cosa for Sardinia, from which point he hoped to cut off the supplies of the capital, and to obtain communication with the Spanish insurgents. But the governor of the island opposed to him a vigorous ., , resistance; and he himself died, not long after Death of ' ' ° Lepidus. his landing, of consumption (677), whereupon the war in Sardinia came to an end. A part of his soldiers dispersed; with the flower of the insurrectionary army and with a well-filled chest the late praetor, Marcus Perpenna, proceeded to Liguria, and thence to Spain to join the Sertorians. The oligarchy was thus victorious over Lepidus; but it 1 found itself compelled by the. dangerous turn of Pompeius compels^ the Sertorian war to concessions, which violated to send him the letter as well as the spirit of the Sullan contoSpam. stitution. It was absolutely necessary to send a strong army and an able general to Spain ; and Pompeius indicated, very plainly, that he desired, or rather demanded, this commission. The pretension was bold. It was bad enough that they had allowed this secret opponent again to attain an extraordinary command in the pressure of the Lepidian revolution ; but it was far more hazardous to set aside all the rules instituted by Sulla for the magisterial hierarchy, so as to invest a man who had hitherto filled no civil office with one of the most important ordinary provincial governorships, under circumstances in which the observance of the legal term of a year was not to be thought of. The oligarchy had thus, even apart from the respect due to their general Metellus, good reason to oppose with all earnestness this new attempt of the ambitious\n\nCHAP. I . ]\n\nAnd Quintus\n\nSertorius.\n\nm\n\nyouth to perpetuate his exceptional position. But this was not easy. In the first place, they had not a single man fitted for the difficult post of general in Spain. Neither of the consuls of the year showed any desire to match himself against Sertorius; and what Lucius Philippus said in a full meeting of the senate had to be admitted as too t r u e that, among all the senators of note, not one was able and willing to command in a serious war. Yet they might, perhaps, have got over this, and after the manner of oligarchs, when they had no capable candidate, have filled the place with some makeshift, if Pompeius had merely desired the command and had not demanded it at the head of ail army. H e had already lent a deaf ear to the injunctions of Catulus that he should dismiss the army ; it was at least doubtful whether those of the senate would find a better reception, and the consequences of a breach no one could calculate—the scale of aristocracy might very easily mount up, if the sword of a well-known general were thrown into the opposite scale. So the majority resolved on concession. N o t from the people, which constitutionally ought to have been consulted in a case where a private man was to be invested with the supreme magisterial power, but from the senate, Pompeius received proconsular authority and the chief command in Hither S p a i n ; and, forty days after he had received it, crossed the Alps in the summer of 677. F i r s t of all the new general found employment in Gaul, Pompeius where no formal insurrection had broken out, iu Gaul. but serious disturbances of the peace had occurred at several places; in consequence of which Pompeius deprived the cantons of the Volcae-Arecomici and the Helvii of their independence, and placed them under Mas-, silia. H e also laid out a new road over the Cottian Alps (Mont Genevre, ii. 128), and so established a shorter communication between the valley of the Po and Gaul. Amidst this work the best season of the year passed away; it was not till late in autumn that Pompeius crossed the PyreBees,\n\n42\n\nMarcus Lepidus\n\n[BOOK\n\nT.\n\nSertorius had meanwhile not been idle. H e had despatched Hirtuleius into the Further province to keep Metellus in check, and had himself endeavoured to follow up his complete victory in the Hither province, and to prepare for the reception of Pompeius. The isolated Celtiberian towns there, which still adhered to Rome, were attacked and reduced one after another; at last, in the very middle of winter, the strong Contrebia (south-east of Saragossa) had fallen. In vain the hard-pressed towns had sent message after message to Pompeius ; he would not be induced by any entreaties to depart from his wonted course of slow progression. With the exception of the maritime towns, which were defended by the Roman fleet, and Appearance • > •> of Pompeius the districts of the Indisretes and Laletani in the in Spain. ° . north-east corner 01 Spain, where Pompeius established himself after he had at length crossed the P y renees, and made his raw troops bivouac throughout the winter to inure them to hardships, the whole of Hither Spain had at the end of 677 become by treaty or force dependent on Sertorius, and the district on the upper and middle Ebro thenceforth continued the main stay of his power. Even the apprehension, which the fresh Roman force and the celebrated name of the general excited in the army of the insurgents, had a salutary effect on it. Marcus Perpenna, who hitherto as the equal of Sertorius in rank had claimed an independent command over the force which he had brought with him from Liguria, was, on the news of Pompeius' arrival in Spain, compelled by his soldiers to place himself under the orders of Ms abler colleague. F o r the campaign of 678 Sertorius again employed the corps of Hirtuleius against Metellus, while Per76 ' penna with a strong army took up his position along the lower course of the Ebro to prevent Pompeius from crossing the river, if he should march, as was to be expected, in a southerly direction with the view of effecting a junction with Metellus, and along the coast for the sake of procuring supplies for his troops. The corps of Gaius\n\nCHAP.\n\nI.]\n\nAnd Quintus Sertorius.\n\n43\n\nHerennius was destined to the immediate support of Perpetina; farther inland on the upper Ebro Sertorius in person prosecuted meanwhile the subjugation of several districts friendly to Rome, and held himself at the same time ready to hasten according to circumstances to the aid of Perpenna or Hirtuleius. It was still his intention to avoid any pitched battle, and to annoy the enemy by petty conflicts and cutting oft supplies. Pompeius, however, not only forced the passage of the Poiaperas Ebro against Perpenna, but also totally defeated defeated. Herennius at Yalentia (Valencia), and possessed himself of that important town. It was time that Sertorius should appear in person, and throw the superiority of his numbers and of his genius into the scale against the greater excellence of the soldiers of his opponent. For a considerable time the struggle was concentrated around the town of Lauro (on the Xuear, south of Valencia), which had declared for Pompeius and was on that account besieged by Sertorius. Pompeius exerted himself to the utmost to relieve i t ; but, after several of his divisions had already been assailed separately and cut to pieces, the great warrior found himself—just when he thought that he had surrounded the Sertorians, and when he had invited the besieged to be spectators of the capture of the besieging army —'all of a sudden completely outmanoeuvred; and in order that he might not be himself surrounded, he had to look on from his camp at the capture and burning of the allied town and the carrying off of its inhabitants to Lusitania-—an event which induced a number of towns that were wavering in middle and eastern Spain to adhere anew to Sertorius. Meanwhile Metellus fought With better fortune. In a victories of sharp engagement near Italica (not far from Metellus. Seville), which Hirtuleius had imprudently risked, and in which both generals fought hand to hand and Hirtuleius was wounded, Metellus defeated him and compelled him to evacuate the Roman territory proper, and to throw himself into Lusitania. This victory permitted Metellus in the next campaign (679)\n\nMarcus\n\nLejndus\n\n[BOOK V .\n\nto enter on his march towards Hither Spain, with the view of joining Pompeius in the region of Yalentia, and in concert with him offering battle to the main force of the enemy. Hirtuleius, with a hastily collected army, sought to intercept him at Segovia; he was, however, not merely defeated, but was himself slain along with his brother—-an irreparable loss to the Sertorians. After this the union of the two Roman generals could no longer be prevented; but, while Metellus was advancing towards Valentia, Pompeius offered battle beforehand to the main army of the enemy, with a view to wipe out the stain of Lauro and to gain the expected laurels, if possible, alone. With joy Sertorius embraced the opportunity of fighting with Pompeius before Metellus arrived and the death of Hirtuleius transpired. The armies met on the river Sucro (Xucar) : after a Battle on sharp conflict Pompeius was beaten on the right the Sucro. wing, and was himself carried from the field severely wounded ; Afranius conquered with the left and took the camp of the Sertorians, but during its pillage he was suddenly assailed by Sertorius and compelled also to give way. Had Sertorius been able to renew the battle on the following day, the army of Pompeius would perhaps have been annihilated. But meanwhile Metellus had come up, had overthrown the corps of Perpenna ranged against him, and taken his camp : it was not possible to resume the battle against the two armies united. The junction of the hostile forces, the certainty which thenceforth could no longer be concealed that the army of Hirtuleius had perished, the sudden stagnation after the victory, diffused terror among the Sertorians; and, as not unfrequently happened with Spanish armies, in consequence of this turn of things the greater portion of the Sertorian soldiers dispersed. But the despondency passed away as quickly as it had come; the white fawn, which represented in the eyes of the multitude the military plans of the general, was soon more popular than ever; in a short time Sertorius appeared with a new army confronting the Romans in the level country\n\nCHAP. I.]\n\nAnd Quintus Sertorius.\n\n45\n\nto the south of Saguntum (Murviedro), which firmly adhered to Rome, while the Sertorian privateers interfered with the \"Roman supplies by sea, and scarcity was already making itself felt in the Roman camp. Another battle took place in the plains of the river Turia (Guadalaviar), and the struggle was long undecided. Pompeius with the cavalry was defeated by Sertorius, and his brother-in-law and quaestor, the brave Lucius Memmius, was slain; on the other hand Metellus vanquished Perpenna, and victoriously repelled the attack of the enemy's main army directed against him, receiving himself a wound in the conflict. Once more the Sertorian army dispersed. Valentia, which Gaius Herennius held for Sertorius, was taken and razed to the ground. The Romans, probably for a moment, entertained a hope that they were done with their tough antagonist. The Sertorian army had disappeared ; the Roman troops, penetrating far into the interior, besieged the general himself in the fortress Clunia on the upper Douro. But while they vainly invested this rocky stronghold, the contingents of the insurgent communities assembled elsewhere ; Sertorius stole out of the fortress and stood once more as general at the head of an army, when the eventful year 679 came to an end. Yet the Romans at home had reason to be content with the results of this campaign. Southern and r Successes ° of the central Spain was delivered from the enemy in 1\n\nRomans.\n\n,\n\nconsequence of the destruction of the Hirtuleian army and the battles on the Xucar and Guadalaviar, and was permanently secured through the occupation of the Celtiberian towns Segobriga (between Toledo and Cuenca) and Bilbilis (near Calatayud) by Metellus. The struggle was thenceforth concentrated on the upper and middle Ebro, around the chief strongholds of the Sertorians, Calagurris, Osca, Ilerda, and on the coast around Tarraco. Although both Roman generals had fought bravely, it was not to Pompeius, but to Metellus^ that the success \"was-' mainly due. But although not a little was gained, the Romans had\n\n46 The campaigns of 680 and 681.\n\nMarcus Lepidus\n\n[BOOK T .\n\n^y n o m e a r L S attained their object; and they had asain to take up their winter quarters with ^\n\n.\n\nthe cheerless prospect of an inevitable renewal of their Sisyphean labours. It was not possible to choose quarters in the valley of the lower Ebro, so fearfully devastated by friend and foe; Pompeius spent the winter in the territory of the Yaccaei (about Valladolid), and Metellus even in Gaul. Reinforced by two fresh legions despatched from Italy, the two generals began their operations anew in the spring of 680. N o more battles, in the proper sense, were fought; Sertorius confined himself wholly to guerilla and siege warfare. Metellus reduced the places that still adhered to Sertorius in southern Spain, and everywhere, in order to stop the sources of insurrection, carried the whole male population away with him. Pompeius had a more difficult position in the province of the Ebro. Pallantia (Palencia above Valladolid), which he besieged, was relieved by Sertorius; in front of Calagurris (Calahorra, on the upper Ebro) he was defeated by Sertorius and compelled to leave those regions, although Metellus had united with him in order to the siege of that town. After Metellus had wintered in his province and Pompeius in Gaul, the campaign of 681 was conducted in a similar fashion; but Pompeius gained in this year more permanent successes, and induced a considerable number of communities to withdraw from the insurrection. F o r eight years the Sertorian war thus continued, and yet there seemed no prospect of its termination. and6 1 The state suffered from it beyond desci'iption. character of The flower of the Italian youth perished amid riakSwar°\" exhausting fatigues of Spanish warfare. The public treasury was not only deprived of the Spanish revenues, but had annually to send to Spain for the pay and maintenance of the Spanish armies very considerable sums, which the government hardly knew how to raise. Spain was devastated and impoverished, and the Roman civilization, which presented so fair a promise there, received a severe shock ; as was naturally to be expected in\n\nCHAP.\n\nI.]\n\nAnd Quint m Sertorius.\n\n47\n\nthe case of an insurrectionary war waged with so much bitterness, and but too often occasioning the destruction, of whole communities. Even the towns which adhered to tlie dominant party in Rome had countless hardships to endure ; those situated on the coast had to be provided with necessaries by the Roman fleet, and the situation of the faithful communities in the interior was almost desperate. Gaul suffered hardly less, partly from the requisitions for contingents of infantry and cavalry, for grain and money, partly from the oppressive burden of the winter-quarters, which rose to an intolerable degree in consequence of the bad harvest of 680; almost all the local treasuries were compelled to betake themselves to the Roman bankers, and to burden themselves with a crushing load of debt. Generals and soldiers carried on the war with reluctance. The generals had encountered an opponent far superior in talent, a tediously pertinacious resistance, a warfare of very serious perils and of successes difficult to be attained and far from brilliant; it was asserted that Pompeius was scheming to get himself recalled from Spain and entrusted with a more desirable command elsewhere. The soldiers, too, found little satisfaction in a campaign in which not only was there nothing to be got save hard blows and worthless booty, but their very pay was doled out to them with extreme irregularity. Pompeius reported to the senate, in the winter of 680-681, that the pay was two years in arrear, and that the army threatened to disband if the senate did not devise ways and means ; whereupon at length the needful sums came. The Roman government might certainly have obviated a considerable portion of these evils, if they could have prevailed on themselves to carry on the Spanish war with less remissness, to say nothing of better will. In the main, however, it was neither their fault nor the fault of their generals that a genius so superior as that of Sertorius was able to carry on this guerilla war year after year, despite of all numerical superiority, in a country so thoroughly favourable to insurrectionary and piratical warfare. So little could its end be\n\nMarcus\n\nLepidus\n\n[BOOK V .\n\nforeseen, that the Sertorian insurrection seenwd rather as if it would become intermingled with other contemporary revolts and thereby add to its dangerous character. Just at that time the Romans were contending on every sea with piratical fleets, in Italy with the revolted slaves, in Macedonia with the tribes on the lower Danube, in Asia Minor once more with king Mithradates, That Sertorius had formed connections with the Italian and Macedonian enemies of Rome, cannot be distinctly affirmed, although he certainly was in constant intercourse with the Marians in Italy. With the pirates, on the other hand, he had previously formed an avowed league, and with the Pontic king—with Whom he had long maintained relations through the medium of the Roman emigrants staying at his court—he now concluded a formal treaty of alliance, in which Sertorius ceded to the king the client-states of Asia Minor, but not the Roman province of Asia, and promised, moreover, to send him an officer qualified to lead his troops, and a number of soldiers, while the king, in turn, bound himself to transmit to Sertorius forty ships and 3,000 talents (£720,000). The wise politicians in the capital were already recalling, the time when Italy found itself threatened by Philip from the east and by Hannibal from the west; they conceived thai the new Hannibal, just like his predecessor, after having by himself subdued Spain, could easily arrive with the forces of Spain in Italy sooner than Pompeius, in order that, like the Phoenician formerly, he might summon the Etruscans and Samnites to arms against Rome. But this comparison was more ingenious than accurate. Collapse of Sertorius was far from being strong enough to the power of renew the gigantic enterprise of Hannibal* H e\n\nSertorius.\n\n, '° °\n\n,\n\n.\n\nwas lost it he lelt »pain, where all his successes were bound up with the peculiarities of the country and the people; and even there he was more and more compelled to renounce the offensive. His admirable skill as a leader could not change the nature of his troops. The Spanish militia retained its character, untrustworthy as the wave or the wind; now collected in masses to the number of 150,000,\n\nCHAP. I . ]\n\nAnd Quinius Sertorius.\n\n49\n\nnow melting away again to a mere handful. The Roman emigrants, likewise, continued insubordinate, arrogant, and stubborn. Those kinds of armed force which require that a corps should keep together for a considerable time, such as cavalry especially, were of course very inadequately represented in his army. The war gradually swept off his ablest officers and the flower of his veterans ; and even the most trustworthy communities, weary of being harassed by the Romans and ill-used by the Sertorian officers, began to show signs of impatience and wavering allegiance. It is remarkable that Sertorius, in this respect also like Hannibal, never deceived himself as to the hopelessness of his position; he allowed no opportunity for bringing about a compromise to pass, and was ready at any moment to lay down his command on the assurance of being allowed to live peacefully in his native land. But political orthodoxy knows nothing of compromise and conciliation. Sertorius might not recede or step aside; he was compelled inevitably to move on along the path which he had once entered, however narrow and giddy it might become. His military successes: too, like those of Hannibal, of necessity became less and less considerable; people began to call in question his military talent; he was no longer, it was alleged, what he had been ; he spent the day in feasting or over his cups, and squandered money as well as time. The number of the deserters, and of communities falling internal away, increased. Soon projects formed by the among the Roman emigrants against the life of the general Surtorians. were reported to him; they sounded credible enough, especially as various officers of the insurgent army, and Perpenna in particular, had submitted with reluctance to the supremacy of Sertorius, and the Roman governors had for long promised amnesty and a high reward to anyone who should kill him. Sertorius on hearing such allegations, withdrew the charge of guarding his person from the Roman soldiers and entrusted it to select Spaniards. Against the suspected themselves he proceeded with fearful but necessary severity, and condemned various of theVOL.

A second conspiracy was soon discovered, which had its seat in his own staff;' whoever was denounced Assassmation of had to take flight or die ; hut all were not heSertonus.\n\n°\n\ntrayed, and the remaining conspirators, including especially Perpenna, found in the circumstances only a new incentive to make haste. They were in the head-quarters at Osea. There on the instigation of Perpenna, a brilliant victory was reported to the general as having been achieved by his troops ; and at the festal banquet arranged by Perpenna to celebrate this victory Sertorius accordingly appeared, atteri ded, as was his wont, by his Spanish retiiiue„ Contrary to former custom in the Sertorian head-quarters, the feast sooii became a revel; foul Words passed at table,, and it seemed as if some of the guests sought opportunity to begin an altercation. Sertorius threw himself back on his couch, and seemed desirous not to hear the disturbance. Then a wine-cup was dashed on the floor; Perpenna had given the concerted sign. Marcus Antonius, Sertorius\" neighbour at table, dealt the first blow against him, and when Sertorius turned round and attempted to rise, the assassin flung himself upon him and held him down till the other guests at table, all of them implicated in the conspiracy, threw themselves on the struggling pair, and stabbed the defenceless general while his arms were pinioned (082). With him died his faithful attendants. So ended one of the greatest men, if not the very greatest man, that Rome had hitherto produced—a man who under more fortunate circumstances would perhaps have become the regenerator of his country—by the treason of the wretched band of emigrants whom he was condemned to lead against his native land.

After the death of Sertorius, Perterpenna succeeds penna, as the highest among the Roman officers Succeeds Sertorius. of the Spanish army, laid claim to the chief command. The army submitted, but with mistrust and reluctance. However men had murmured against Sertorius in his lifetime, death, reinstated the hero in his rights, and, vehement was the indignation of the soldiers when, on the publication of his testament, the name of Perpenna was read forth among the heirs. A part of the soldiers, especially the Lusitanians, dispersed; the remainder had a presentiment that .with the death of Sertorius their spirit and their fortune had departed. Accordingly, at the first encounter with Pompeius, the Pompcius wretchedly led and despondent ranks of the inendto'the surgents were utterly broken, and Perpenria, insurrecamong other officers,,was taken prisoner. The wretch sought to purchase his life by delivering up the correspondence of Sertorius, which would have compromised numerous men of standing in Italy ; but Pompeius ordered the papers to be burnt unread, and handed him, as well as the other chiefs of the insm-gents, over to the executioner. The emigrants who had escaped dispersed; and most of them went into the Mauretanian deserts or joined the pirates. Soon afterwards the Plotian law, which was zealously supported by the young Caesar in particular, opened up to a portion of them the opportunity of returning home; but all those who had taken part in the murder of Sertorius, with but a single exception, died a violent death. Osca, and most of the towns which had still adhered to Sertorius in Hither Spain, now voluntarily opened their gates to Pompeius; Uxama (Osma), Clunia, and Calagurris alone had to be reduced by force. The two provinces were regulated anew; in the Further province, Metellus raised the annual tribute of the most guilty communities ; in the Hither, Pompeius dispensed reward and punishment: Calagurris, for example, lost its independence and was placed under Osca. A band of Sertorian soldiers, which had col-\n\n52\n\nQuintus Sertorius,\n\n[BOOK V .\n\nlected in the Pyrenees, was induced by Pompeius to surrender, and was settled by him to the north of the Pyrenees near Lugudunum (St. Bertrand, in the department HauteGaronne), as the community of the \" assembled \" (convenae). The Roman emblems of victory were erected at the summit of the pass of the Pyrenees ; at the close of G83, Metellus and Pompeius marched with their armies through the streets of the capital, to present the thanks of the nation to Father Jovis at the Capitol for the conquest of the Spaniards. The good fortune of Sulla seemed still to be with his creation after he had been laid in the grave, and to protect it better than the incapable and negligent watchmen appointed to guard it. The opposition in Italy had broken down from the incapacity and precipitation of its leader, and that of the emigrants from dissension within their own ranks. These defeats, although far more the result of their own perverseness and discordance than of the exertions of their opponents, were yet so many victories for the oligarchy. The curule chairs were rendered once more secure.\n\nCHAPTER RULE OF THE SULLAN\n\nII. RESTORATION.\n\nWHEN the suppression of the Cinnan revolution, which threatened the existence of the senate, rendered relations. it possible for the restored senatorial government to devote the requisite attention to the internal and external security of the empire, various matters presented themselves, the settlement of which could not be postponed without inj uring the most important interests and allowing present inconveniences to grow into future dangers. Apart from the very serious complications in Spain, it was absolutely necessary effectually to check the bar barians in Thrace and the regions of the Danube, whom Sulla on his march through Macedonia had only been able slightly to chastise (iii. 373), and to regulate, by military intervention, the disorderly state of things along the northern frontier of the Greek peninsula; thoroughly to suppress the bands of pirates infesting the seas everywhere, but especially the eastern waters ; and to introduce better order into the unsettled relations of Asia Minor. The peace which Sulla had concluded in 670 with Mithradates, king of Pontus (iii. 372), and of which the treaty with Murena in 673 (iii. 416) was essentially a repetition, bore throughout the stamp of a provincial arrangement to meet the exigencies of the moment; and the relations of the Romans with Tigranes, king of Armenia, with whom they had de facto waged war, remained wholly untouched in this peace. Tigranes had with right regarded this as a tacit permission to bring the! Roman possessions in Asia under his power. If these were not to be abandoned, it was necessary to come to terms amicably or by force with the new great king of Asia. External\n\n54\n\nRule of the Sullan Restoration.\n\nChap, i l ]\n\nIn the preceding chapter we have described the movements in Italy and Spain connected with the proceedings of the democracy, and their subjugation by the senatorial government. In the present chapter we shall review the external government, as the authorities installed by Sulla conducted, or failed to conduct, it. W e still recognize the vigorous hand of Sulla in the Daimatoenergetic measures which, in the last period of D^anexpehis regency, the senate adopted almost simulditions. taneously against the Sertorians, the Dalmatians and Thracians, and the Cilician pirates. The expedition to the Graeco-Illyrian peninsula was designed partly to reduce to subjection or at least to tame the barbarous tribes who ranged over the whole interior from the Black Sea to the Adriatic, and of whom the Bessi (in the great Balkan) especially were, as it was then said, notorious as robbers even among a race of robbers; partly to destroy the corsairs in their haunts, especially along the Dalmatian coast. As usual, the attack took place simultaneously from Dalmatia and from Macedonia, in which province an army of five legions was assembled for the purpose. In Dalmatia the former praetor Gaius Cosconius held the command, marched through the country in all directions, and took by storm the fortress of Salona after a two years' siege. In Macedonia the proconsul Appius Claudius (676-678) first attempted along the Macedono-Thracian frontier to make himself master of the mountain districts on the left bank of the Karasu. On both sides the war was conducted with savage ferocity; the Thracians destroyed the places which they took and massacred their captives, and the Romans returned like for like. But no results of importance were attained ; the toilsome marches and the constant conflicts with the numerous and brave inhabitants of the mountains decimated the army to no purpose; the general himself sickened and died. His successor,7 Gaius Scribonius Curio 75-73 (679-681), was induced by various obstacles, and particularly by a not inconsiderable military revolt, to\n\nCHAP. II]\n\nliule of the Sullan HestoraUon.\n\n55\n\ndesist from the difficult expedition against the Thracians, and to turn himself instead to the northern frontier of Mace donia, where he subdued the weaker Dardani (in Servia) and reached as far as the Danube. The brave and able Marcus Lucullus (682, 683) again advanced 72 n Thrace eastward, defeated the Bessi in their mountains,3 subdued.\n\ntook their capital Uscudama or Philippopolis (Adrianople), and compelled them to submit to the Roman supremacy. Sadalas king of the Odrysians, and the Greek towns on the east coast to the north and south of the Balkan chain—Istropolis, Tomi, Callatis, Odessus (near Varna), Mesembria, and others—became dependent on the Romans. Thrace, of which the Romans had hitherto held little more than the Attalic possessions on the Chersonese, now became a portion—-though far from obedient—of the province of Macedonia. But the predatory raids of the Thracians and Dardani, confined as .thev were to a small part of the emPiracy. . \" pire, were far less injurious to the state and to individuals than the evil of piracy, which was continually spreading farther and acquiring more solid organization. The commerce of the whole Mediterranean was t t in its power. Italy could neither export its own products nor import grain from the provinces; in the former, the people were starving, in the latter the cultivation of the corn-fields ceased for want of a vent for the produce. No consignment of money, no traveller was longer safe; the public treasury suffered most serious losses; a great many Romans of rank were captured by the corsairs, and compelled to pay heavy sums for their ransom, except in special instances where it was the pleasure of the pirates to execute the sentence of death, seasoning their proceedings with a savage humour. The merchants, and even the divisions of Roman troops destined for the East, began to postpone their voyages chiefly to the unfavourable season of the year, and to be less afraid of the winter storms than of the piratical vessels, which indeed even at this season did not wholly disappear from sea. But severely as the closing of\n\n56\n\nRule of the Sullan Restoration.\n\n[BOOK\n\nY.\n\nthe sea was felt, it was more tolerable than the raids made on the islands and coasts of Greece and Asia Minor. J u s t as afterwards in the time of the Normans, piratical squad« rons ran up to the maritime towns, and either compelled them to buy themselves off with large sums, or besieged and took them by storm. When Samothrace, Clazomenae, Samos, lassus were pillaged by the pirates (670) under the eyes of Sulla after peace was concluded with Mithradates, we may conceive how matters went on where neither a Roman army nor a Roman fleet was at hand. All the old rich temples along the coasts of Greece and Asia Minor were plundered one after another ; from Samothrace alone a treasure of 1,000 talents (£240,000) is said to have been carried off. Apollo, according to a Roman poet of this period, was so impoverished by the pirates that, when the swallow paid him a visit, he could no longer produce to it out of all his treasures even a drachm of gold. More than four hundred townships were enumerated as having been taken or laid under contribution by the pirates, including cities like Cnidns., Samos, Colophon ; from not a few places on islands or the coast, which were previously flourishing, the whole population migrated, that they might not be carried off by the pirates. Even inland districts were no longer safe from, their attacks; they occasionally assailed places distant one or two days' march from the coast. The fearful debt, under which subsequently all the communities of the Greek East succumbed, proceeded in great part from these fatal times. Piracy had totally changed its character. The pirates were no longer bold freebooters,' who levied Organizao tionof\n\ntheir tribute from the large Italo-Oriental traffic a n , ] luxuries, as it passed through the Cretan waters between Cyrene and the Peloponnesus—in the language of the pirates the \" golden sea; \" n o longer even armed slave-catchers, who prosecuted \" war, trade, and piracy \" side by side; they formed now a piratical state, with a peculiar esprit de corps, with a solid and very respectable organization, with a home of their own and the piracy.\n\nCHAP.
