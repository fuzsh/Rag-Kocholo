The very brand new collaboration with world famous Manga Devilman

On 24th.Apr. Ground Y will drop a new collaboration with manga Devil man which created by Go NAGAI to celebrate 3 years anniversary of its establishment.

Devil man started serialized on Weekly Shōnen Magazine in 1972, then got published as an independent book and achieved a total circulation which is 10 million.

The author dropped a question “What is human?” to discuss the existence of human-beings. It still has great influence on today’s manga artist and creators.

Questioning the existence of human-beings; introspecting the established concept between “kind” and “evil”,to pay the tribute of the antithesis both shared in Devil man’s and YOHJI YAMAMOTO’s world, the collaboration came into the world.
