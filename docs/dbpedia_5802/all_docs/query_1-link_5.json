Most incarnations of the character have him displayed as a kind hearted but weak willed young man before he is merged with the demon Amon where he battles against the forces of the demon army. Some incarnations however have him just as a shell for Amon to use.\n\nDevilman: Devilman not to be confused with the alter-ego of the main character, was originally the protagonist of the TV series and is a similar character to Amon. He has appeared in various other works since then often represented as the combination of Akira and Amon rather than as a separate character.\n\nDante: A massive and powerful demon lord, who leads the battle against God in the various Demon Lord Dante series along with his incarnation Ryo Utsugi. In other series he is often given a more villainous role, and the Devilman Lady incarnation has shown him to be the main body of Zennon.\n\nAmon: A mighty demon warrior and hero, in the original manga he fused with Akira Fudo after an elaborate trick by his rival Satan. Various manga and anime present him in different ways sometimes being an anti-hero, other times as a straight up psychopath.\n\nSatan: Satan is the main antagonist of the original manga, despite not really wanting to be evil. They are intersex, with several golden-white wings. They were the child of God, and an alien being known as an Angel that watched as their father create humanity. However, after a strain of demons emerged, and their father planned to wipe them out, Satan fought him and rescued the demons from death by putting them in hibernation. Years later, they escaped hibernation and wiped their memories, becoming Ryo Asuka in order to get close to a human they fell in love with, Akira Fudo. In some cases they are redone as Iwao Himura or Koichi Tomoda.\n\nMiki Makimura: Miki Makimura is Akira's childhood friend who often acts as the main female protagonist in any of the Devilman series, several times acting as Akira's love interest in various series. She is often seen as the grounding force for what Akira believes in. Some characters have also filled her role in other media including Kasumi Seta.\n\nSirene: Sirene is a beautiful demoness with angelic and avian qualities, she was the lover of Amon and after he was taken over by Akira she vowed vengeance upon him attempting to kill him. Sirene does not seem to be inherently evil as she cares about her companions, but was blinded by her emotions that often has terrible consequences.\n\nZennon: Zennon is Satan's second in command and one of the most powerful demons in existence, most versions have him as a loyal servant to his lord Satan alongside Psycho Jenny, others often have him based on his TV incarnation as the lord of the Demon Tribe.\n\nPsycho Jenny: Psycho Jenny was a large headed demoness of almost unlimited power, she uses her various psychic abilities to manipulate the reality around her including the memory of her master Satan.\n\nZannin: A demon originally seen in the TV series based on the character Zennon from Demon Lord Dante. In some cases he will often take the place of Zennon in leading the Demon Tribe.\n\nJinmen: A sadistic turtle-like demon who consumes both human and demon alike and adds them to his hideous shell often as a way to torment his victims and his enemies.\n\nKaim: A pachyderm-like demon with large horns, unlike most demons he is not evil and does not care about Satan's wish to wipe out humanity, with the only thing he cared about was the happiness of his love Sirene even if his love is unrequited.\n\nMico: Mico is the nickname of a female Devilman who often goes by the name Mikiko Kawamoto, however there are variations on the name. In all incarnations, she is a girl who dominates over the demon Tollg when it attempts to merge with her.\n\nGod: In a large number of the series, God is the main rarely yet seen antagonist especially in the main line of the Devilman series and the Demon Lord Dante series.\n\nJun Fudo/Devilman Lady: A female counterpart to Akira Fudo, with her alter-ego and powers being genetic in origin. Originally a mild mannered yet unconfident young woman, she becomes Devilman Lady due to a genetic factor that also creates Devil Beasts that she must hunt down while battling with her loss of humanity.\n\nLan Asuka: An analog to Satan's Ryo Asuka disguise, a cold and calculating young woman with special abilities partnered to Jun. In both the anime and manga, she is revealed to be intersex , first being a boy, but later becoming a woman in different ways, eventually growing feelings for Jun. Their true identity and role is different in the media however.\n\nAoi Kurosaki: An Olympic level swimmer who was friends with Jun once but they later grew apart by some means. Her original manga counterpart had a severe case of multiple personality disorder which caused her different transformations into a Devilbeast.\n\nTerminology[]\n\nDemons: An offshoot of humans that through some means gained the ability to fuse with matter and take over human bodies with unstable minds. While the Demons in Demon Lord Dante were displayed more as pitiful victims of God's invasion, the Demons of Devilman are displayed as maniacal and believe themselves to be above humanity with very few exceptions.\n\nDevilmen: Humans that due to their pure hearts, gained the ability to not be overtaken by demons and gain their powers and forms. However the effects on a person vary with the weak willed Akira becoming more aggressive after fusing with Amon and the doubtful Mico unable to suppress Tollg's body parts.\n\nDevil Beasts: Humans that through a genetic factor called the Devil Beast Syndrome are able to assume demonic forms that are different depending on the individual.\n\nBlack Sabbath: A ritual featured in a couple series that involves awakening demons using ill-willed humans as sacrifices.\n\nAngels: Mysterious alien beings that serve God, many of them blindly following God's will however at least one of them (Satan) is shown to disagree with his rulings, exactly what they are is never explained.\n\nAnti-Demon Corps: The Anti-Demon Corps was a small army dedicated against fighting the demon menace, however many of their victims were either human or Devilman. They had advanced technology and powerful weapons, and caused their victims slow and painful deaths."
