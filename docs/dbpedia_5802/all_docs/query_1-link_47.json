        "text": "Welcome to the Manga Sales general thread!\n\nAs you might have heard, InstallBase is trying to expand to markets other than the video game one. This thread will serve as a first step towards that goal.\n\nFor now, every single thing will be concentrated here. This means data, discussion, questions, etc.\n\nWhile the vast majority of the data available concerns the Japanese market, it will not be the only focus of this thread. And so, let me present you what you might find by reading through this thread:\n\nJapan\n\nThe company that tracks manga sales in Japan is Oricon. You might also know it for its tracking of the music market (for both singles and albums), the anime market (for both DVDs and Blu-Rays) or the book market (which includes manga and light novels).\n\nOricon tracks physical sales of manga volumes through a variety of retailers (a list of which you can find here). This means that the digital side of the market that has been steadily growing will not be represented through them.\n\nHere is what I will share from Oricon:\n\nA weekly top 10 best-selling manga series that separates the different editions of a series - Released at 1 a.m. GMT on Fridays\n\nA weekly top 10 best-selling manga series that combines all editions of a series - Released at 8 a.m. GMT on Fridays (a numberless top 20 is also released earlier, at 2 a.m. GMT)\n\nA weekly top 50 best-selling manga volumes - Released at 1 a.m. GMT on Fridays\n\nA monthly top 20 best-selling manga series (Based on the \"combined\" series ranking) and volumes - Released at 8 a.m. GMT on Fridays that follow the last week of the month\n\nA top 10 best-selling manga series (Based on the \"combined\" series ranking) for the first half of a year - Released at 8 p.m. GMT on Sundays following the end of the tracking period\n\nA top 50 best-selling manga volumes for the first half of the year - Released at 8 p.m. GMT on Sundays following the end of the tracking period\n\nA yearly top 10 best-selling manga series (Based on the \"combined\" series ranking) - Released at 8 p.m. GMT on Sundays following the end of the tracking period\n\nA yearly top 50 best-selling manga volumes - Released at 8 p.m. GMT on Sundays following the end of the tracking period\n\nThis constitutes what I will share for sure. On top of this, I should mention the Oricon White Paper, that releases on March 31st of every year. It includes a yearly top 50 best-selling manga series and top 200 best-selling manga volumes. I will not buy it and share its content, but this data will eventually end up being shared anyway.\n\nSeveral times in the past, someone appeared and started leaking data from the business Oricon subscription. This included, among other things, weekly top 100 best-selling volumes. It might happen again, but Oricon will likely cut it short.\n\nKnow that the weekly volume tracking started on March 24th, 2008. Therefore, if a volume released before that date were to chart in the weekly top 50, the number shown would represent sales achieved after that date.\n\nIt's also important to say that Oricon's yearly ranking goes from Week 47 to Week 46 (exceptions being made for years with 53 weeks). This means that the current year 2024 started on November 20th, 2023 and will end on November 17th, 2024.\n\nThe second main source of information for the Japanese market is Shoseki. A blog. Less trustworthy than Oricon, but still useful. A notable difference is that it tracks fewer stores (namely, online stores aren't tracked).\n\nThe blogger posts the following for free on their website:\n\nA daily top 500 best-selling manga volumes\n\nA weekly top 500 best-selling manga volumes - Released on Tuesdays\n\nA monthly top 500 best-selling manga volumes\n\nA first-half, second-half and yearly top 500 best-selling manga volumes\n\nAside from the daily rankings, all of these feature estimates for ranks 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500. This means that by using linear extrapolation, you can estimate sales for every volume from rank 30 to 500. I would advise against using such estimates for the monthly and yearly rankings, as the numbers are too big to be suitable for a linear extrapolation. But it is a useful tool for the weekly rankings.\n\nA difference with Oricon is that Shoseki uses calendar dates for all its rankings. The monthly ranking starts at the 1st of each month and ends on the last day of the month. The same thing happens with the yearly ranking, which starts on January 1st and ends on December 31st.\n\nThanks to these two sources, I will be able to share estimates for the yearly ranking throughout the year.\n\nFinally, I won't go into too much details, but you can also find and use data from specific retailers, such as Honto (which gives daily, weekly and monthly top 100s that include both physical and digital volumes), Amazon, BookLive, EbookJapan, Rakuten, etc.\n\nUnited States\n\nProbably the second country with the most data publicly available. The main tracker for the US's manga market is NPD/BookScan. Via Publishers Weekly, some numbers can be found:\n\nThe Trade Paper Frontlist features a weekly top 25 that may include manga volumes, among others\n\nThe Comics ranking features a monthly top 10 that may include manga volumes, among other comics\n\nVia ICv2, BookScan publishes a monthly top 20 best-selling manga volumes. Without a subscription, only the ranks will be available. The top 20 with numbers sometimes leaks, but it is highly irregular. If the dates match, which is not guaranteed, the monthly top 10 Comics ranking from Publishers Weekly will match with the numbers from the ICv2 top 20.\n\nFinally, Brian Hibbs, from Comics Beat, does an analysis on the yearly data, using BookScan numbers. You may find the 2021 one here, if you scroll a little, you will find links to the previous ones. This includes a numberless top 750 best-selling comics of the year, which usually contains at least 50% of manga volumes. The recent years are especially interesting as they include a ranking of all the authors that sold over 100,000 units in a year. This is a decent substitute to a series ranking, as a lot of authors only have one major series.\n\nFrance\n\nFor France, two trackers will be relevant.\n\nFirst is Edistat. Edistat releases a weekly top 200 best-selling books on Fridays, around 10 a.m. GMT. In the past couple years, 30 to 60 manga volumes were present on average. The sales numbers are available, but one needs to pay for individual volumes to get them. Only the weekly top 3 is free.\n\nBut, in a partnership with Edistat, Actualitté started sharing numbers for the entire top 10 in articles that may take a few hours to be published.\n\nThe second tracker is Gfk. The website and newspaper LivresHebdo is partnered with them. They share weekly best-selling books (without numbers) and, more importantly, a yearly top 50 best-selling comics, which is filled with manga volumes (28 out of 50 in 2021).\n\nIt's also fairly common for data to be shared through articles, interviews, tweets, etc. So I will also be on the lookout for that.\n\nAs a side note, Gfk and Nielsen have confirmed that the two companies will merge in the future. It is unknown how this will affect numbers (not just in France, and not just for manga).\n\nAnd more\n\nThese three markets are the ones I know best, but if you find data for other countries, feel free to share it so we can learn more!\n\nCirculation numbers are also regularly updated. Be careful, \"circulation\" does not mean \"sales\". It's the amount of physical volumes printed + the amount of digital volumes sold. Some may include worldwide numbers, but we never actually know which countries are included. A \"worldwide\" circulation number could very well only include a couple more countries on top of Japan.\n\nDatabases\n\nFinally, I will share here some relevant databases and archives.\n\nThe Oricon Weekly Manga Sales Archives, made by myself. This includes every single weekly volume ranking in Oricon history. A few from 2008 to 2011 have never been fully translated (only top 20s or 30s are available). But it is an ongoing project and I regularly add some missing data. You may also find some leaked top 100s. There is a \"Search\" option, which allows you to search for a volume or a series, so feel free to use it.\n\n@josu_ke 's website, MangaCodex, which includes graphs showing the evolution of first-month sales of ~100 series on Oricon.\n\nThis sheet that contains combined rankings of the highest selling series and volumes in a single year on Oricon, made by @Turkey and ManganiMY.\n\nThis Circulation Numbers database made by Sjeben. You can also search for a magazine and get data for all series that run/have run in it.\n\nThe Randomanga blog, by @Eris. In French, though that should only rarely be an issue. It includes every single known monthly and yearly data from Oricon. There are also yearly French top 50 best-selling series for 2007 to 2011. There is an archive of the print data for manga magazines in Japan since 2008. And finally, it archives the first-month sales for every single volume of every single series that ever reached 100,000 units sold in a month in the weekly Oricon rankings, including numbers from 2008-2011 that haven't been translated in my archive yet.\n\nAlready shared above for the US: all the BookScan top 20 best-selling comics volumes since April 2008, all the yearly analysis by Brian Hibbs on Comics Beat.\n\nThis database made by @Turkey of the monthly bookstores top 100 best-selling comics in Italy.\n\nI have also archived on my computer all of Edistat's (France) top 200 best-selling books since late 2020. I have yet to put it in a public sheet, but know that this is data that I have, if you have any questions that might need it.\n\nIf you have any question, just ask! Me or @josu_ke (or maybe even someone else) would be glad to answer and help you.\n\nThanks you very much for being here! Please be mindful and respectful of each others. Try not to derail the thread away from sales discussion.\n\nWelcome to the Manga Sales general thread!\n\nAs you might have heard, InstallBase is trying to expand to markets other than the video game one. This thread will serve as a first step towards that goal.\n\nFor now, every single thing will be concentrated here. This means data, discussion, questions, etc.\n\nWhile the vast majority of the data available concerns the Japanese market, it will not be the only focus of this thread. And so, let me present you what you might find by reading through this thread:\n\nJapan\n\nThe company that tracks manga sales in Japan is Oricon. You might also know it for its tracking of the music market (for both singles and albums), the anime market (for both DVDs and Blu-Rays) or the book market (which includes manga and light novels).\n\nOricon tracks physical sales of manga volumes through a variety of retailers (a list of which you can find here). This means that the digital side of the market that has been steadily growing will not be represented through them.\n\nHere is what I will share from Oricon:\n\nA weekly top 10 best-selling manga series that separates the different editions of a series - Released at 2 a.m. GMT on Fridays\n\nA weekly top 10 best-selling manga series that combines all editions of a series - Released at 10 a.m. GMT on Fridays (a numberless top 20 is also released earlier, at 3 a.m. GMT)\n\nA weekly top 50 best-selling manga volumes - Released at 2 a.m. GMT on Fridays\n\nA monthly top 20 best-selling manga series (Based on the \"combined\" series ranking) and volumes - Released at 10 a.m. GMT on Fridays that follow the last week of the month\n\nA top 10 best-selling manga series (Based on the \"combined\" series ranking) for the first half of a year - Released at 8 p.m. on Sundays following the end of the tracking period\n\nA top 50 best-selling manga volumes for the first half of the year - Released at 8 p.m. on Sundays following the end of the tracking period\n\nA yearly top 10 best-selling manga series (Based on the \"combined\" series ranking) - Released at 8 p.m. on Sundays following the end of the tracking period\n\nA yearly top 50 best-selling manga volumes - Released at 8 p.m. on Sundays following the end of the tracking period\n\nThis constitutes what I will share for sure. On top of this, I should mention the Oricon White Paper, that releases on March 31st of every year. It includes a yearly top 50 best-selling manga series and top 200 best-selling manga volumes. I will not buy it and share its content, but this data will eventually end up being shared anyway. (2019 and parts of 2018 are the only missing ones as of today)\n\nSeveral times in the past, someone appeared and started leaking data from the business Oricon subscription. This included, among other things, weekly top 100 best-selling volumes. It might happen again, but Oricon will likely cut it short.\n\nKnow that the weekly volume tracking started on March 24th, 2008. Therefore, if a volume released before that date were to chart in the weekly top 50, the number shown would represent sales achieved after that date.\n\nIt's also important to say that Oricon's yearly ranking goes from Week 47 to Week 46 (exceptions being made for years with 53 weeks). This means that the current year started on November 22nd, 2021 and will end on November 20th, 2022.\n\nThe second main source of information for the Japanese market is Shoseki. A blog. Less trustworthy than Oricon, but still useful. A notable difference is that it tracks fewer stores (namely, online stores aren't tracked).\n\nThe blogger posts the following for free on their website:\n\nA daily top 500 best-selling manga volumes\n\nA weekly top 500 best-selling manga volumes - Released on Tuesdays\n\nA monthly top 500 best-selling manga volumes\n\nA first-half, second-half and yearly top 500 best-selling manga volumes\n\nAside from the daily rankings, all of these feature estimates for ranks 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500. This means that by using linear extrapolation, you can estimate sales for every volume from rank 30 to 500. I would advise against using such estimates for the monthly and yearly rankings, as the numbers are too big to be suitable for a linear extrapolation. But it is a useful tool for the weekly rankings.\n\nA difference with Oricon is that Shoseki uses calendar dates for all its rankings. The monthly ranking starts at the 1st of each month and ends on the last day of the month. The same thing happens with the yearly ranking, which starts on January 1st and ends on December 31st.\n\nThanks to these two sources, I will be able to share estimates for the yearly ranking throughout the year.\n\nFinally, I won't go into too much details, but you can also find and use data from specific retailers, such as Honto (which gives daily, weekly and monthly top 100s that include both physical and digital volumes), Amazon, BookLive, EbookJapan, Rakuten, etc.\n\nUnited States\n\nProbably the second country with the most data publicly available.

Try not to derail the thread away from sales discussion.\n\nThank you so much for setting this up! This is a very good summary of sources used for tracking manga sales! It’s nice to see Install Base expand into manga, especially with such an interesting season coming up!\n\nNote: are these kinds of conversations forbidden?\n\nI want to talk about axe(Aliens Area and Super Smartphone)\n\nIt seems that they have received negative comments and are not popular not only in Japan but around the world.(MyAnimeList and Anilist, number of comment about chapters etc.)\n\nDespite this, I see a ot of comments like\n\n\"this is because of japanese people don't buy this type manga\" etc. or some comment about Shonen Jump.\n\nAnd I don't understand, especially the first one. There are officially translated and it is free in English.\n\nPeople don't like those and biggest reason for this is themselves.(probably editor or writer or both)\n\nNote: Let's not turn it into a discussion about the content of the 2 manga, this is not the place.\n\nNote: I wrote it because I'm tired of people talking about these two manga under every sales figure or ranking on twitter\n\nI’m guessing people are talking about those two manga in a negative light because there are a lot of signs that signal that those two are the next on the Weekly Shonen Jump chopping block, mainly being the consistently low ToC positions and low sales compared to the other stuff that the magazine has."
