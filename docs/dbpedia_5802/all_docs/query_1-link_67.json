        "text": "Probably never. This SPECIFIC style of anime? I doubt it.\n\nThink about the 3 examples you used; Dragon Ball, Naruto and One Piece.\n\nGoku just BARELY manages to be explicit by virtue of being married to a woman. Otherwise he displays 0 romantic or sexual interest in anything or anyone.\n\nLuffy is the same except he ISN'T married. I don't think Luffy is even explicitly heterosexual\n\nNaruto comes the closest with his crush on Sakura and even that is a small part of the beginning of the 700 chapter manga that almost exclusively focuses on his relationship with Sasuke.\n\nThis style of manga is barely even receptive to explicit displays of heterosexuality from the main character. Homosexuality is a pipe dream at this point.\n\nNow my question is; why does the west put so much importance on the 300+ chapter battle shonen published by Shueshia? They're such a narrow and specific style and market that it's a fools errand to go there looking for anything but the usual fare. As others have posted there are a breadth of manga and anime out there, all with their problems of course but all with qualities that are much more in line with something more positive and explicit. We should really do our part to prop those up instead of constantly going on about the mainstream of mainstream expectations and tastes\n\nNow my question is; why does the west put so much importance on the 300+ chapter battle shonen published by Shueshia?

We should really do our part to prop those up instead of constantly going on about the mainstream of mainstream expectations and tastes\n\nI mean I think the importance is that, despite being limited, they are some of the biggest and most hyped series. Seeing queerness in the mainstream is reassuring. It's a similar reason for why people are interested in seeing gay characters in the MCU even though there is a lot of LGTBQ cinema and representation in certain types of tv shows.\n\nLike my younger cousins are getting into anime and the shounen stuff is mostly what they hear about because it's popular. I can recommend other options but that's what they'll gravitate to because of the hype and because of the mass appeal.\n\nI mean I think the importance is that, despite being limited, they are some of the biggest and most hyped series.

I can recommend other options but that's what they'll gravitate to because of the hype and because of the mass appeal.\n\nI understand this but the thing is, over here we end up being a fair bit responsible for what does and doesn't get hyped. The industry in Japan usually does the bare minimum of promotion for most of their properties when it comes to overseas. You've got tons of super popular manga in Japan that nobody makes a peep about over here so it's not even that the biggest things are what get hyped it's just the biggest things that are part of that one hyper specific style are what get hyped by US! That's why I made my little \"call to action\" earlier because Japan isn't really doing anything to make \"Boy Adventure #4556\" more popular in the west than say \"Kingdom\". It's just for whatever reason the west tends to gravitate towards talking about the former rather than the latter despite both being popular in their home countries.\n\nI understand this but the thing is, over here we end up being a fair bit responsible for what does and doesn't get hyped.

It's not like the west is uniquly inflating the sales of these titles. Not to mention, compared to a lot of manga, the titles are easily accessible via the SJ app for extremely cheap, When the anime adaptations are created, they tend to be distributed across many platforms, featured on said platform, and have a better chance to air on Toonami. It's simply taking a popular thing and moving it across the sea where it also becomes popular because its features have mass appeal and Shueisha knows this.\n\nWSJ is the best selling manga magazine in Japan.

It's simply taking a popular thing and moving it across the sea where it also becomes popular because its features have mass appeal and Shueisha knows this.\n\nI'm not saying the west is inflating the sales of the titles. I'm saying that Japan doesn't do much to hype up works on an international level. So when it comes to what does and doesn't get hyped it has less to do with what is and isn't selling well over there and has more to do with what people over here latch onto and decide to talk about. WSJ is the best selling manga magazine in Japan but that doesn't mean too much here because.....most things in WSJ don't get talked about much here. Shueshia doesn't tell us to get hyped for Jujutsu Kaisen anymore than they tell us to get hyped for Kingdom or Golden Kamuy. They've all been licensed, their anime's all get distributed by the same people, they all sell well in Japan. It's a pretty level playing feel.\n\nIt's ultimately US who decide which one of those things we wanna hype up. We're not really getting this stuff pushed in our faces to the point that the hype becomes an inevitability. It's just people over here tend to flock to a very specific kind of popular thing. And I'm saying it doesn't have to be that way.\n\nIt's my understanding that every series in Shonen Jump with the sole exception of KochiKame is subject to regular popularity polls, and if the performance drops enough, the series gets cancelled.\n\nSo I think part of the uphill battle is that if you go to Shueisha and you want to sell them on a battle manga with a gay protagonist that you want published in Shonen Jump, they're not concerned with whether or not it would make money instead of losing it, they're concerned with whether or not it can compete with everything else they're publishing in the magazine that's already proven itself to be hugely successful in a mainstream audience. They're concerned with if they can expect better performance than everything else that's being pitched to them. Things are going to be pushed towards their most marketable form in order to compete in this environment, which means they're probably not going to try to grasp at other demographics that may be a smaller market, but may attempt to appeal to other markets on top of their primary one, like how Rurouni Kenshin had romantic and bishounen aspects to attract more female readers.\n\nThere's a similar resistance with toy companies, who are concerned that toys made based on female characters won't sell in franchises that are primarily positioned as being for boys, so it's harder to get female characters into the franchise. This is discussed on the Transformers wiki, for example."
