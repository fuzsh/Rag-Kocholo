        "text": "This article collates Evangelion staff interviews and statements. The source anthology by EvaGeeks member gwern includes many of these and numerous other sources collected mostly, but not exclusively from the forums over the years. It has not been updated since 2019 and does not include dozens of new translations (of old and new material) made since then, which are instead collected here. Consider both pages for a complete index of translations. Please refer to Theory and Analysis:What Is Canon? for the peculiarities in analyzing the hundreds of Evangelion extra-textual materials. The following material is usually considered Tier 2.\n\nThe format of the entries should be something like\n\nTitle (or some combination of who-what-where, if a straightforward title is not available)\n\nPoints of interest\n\nQuotations?\n\nPrimary source and its availability; this would usually mean the original Japanese text\n\nSecondary sources and their availability; these would be usually translations\n\nReliability level of the sources and related disclaimers (staff statements would usually be Tier 2 canon)\n\nThis list mostly covers material regarding the original series, D&R, EoE and the manga. For sources concerning Rebuild of Evangelion, particularly the last film, see:\n\nEvangelion 1.0 Complete Records Collection\n\nEvangelion 2.0 Complete Records Collection; and missing parts\n\nResources:Evangelion Q Records Collection\n\nEvangelion 3.0+1.0 Assorted Translations\n\nReliable and well-known sources\n\nHideaki Anno: What were we trying to make here?\n\nPoints of interest: An insightful view of what Anno had in mind before the start of the TV series. (Please expand)\n\nQuotations?\n\nPrimary source: Neon Genesis Evangelion Vol. 1 (Needs better release info!)\n\nTranslation: available here. Mari Morimoto and Fred Burke\n\nReliability level: Solid Tier 2 canon.\n\nThe year: 2015. A world where, fifteen years before, over half the human population perished. A world that has been miraculously revived: its economy, the production, circulation, consumption of material goods, so that even the shelves of convenience stores are filled. A world where the people have gotten used to the ressurrection-yet still feel the end of the world is destined to come. A world where the number of children, the future leaders of the world, is few. A world where Japan saw the original Tokyo destroyed, discarded and forgotten, and built a new capital in Nagano Prefecture. They constructed a new capital, Tokyo-2, then left it to be a decoy-then constructed another new capital, Tokyo-3, and tried to make it safe from attack. A world where some completely unknown enemy called the \"Angels\" comes to ravage the cities.\n\nThis is roughly the world-view for Neon Genesis Evangelion. This is a world-view drenched in a vision of pessimism. A world-view where the story starts only after any traces of optimism have been removed.\n\nAnd in that world, a 14-year-old boy shrinks from human contact. And he tries to live in a closed world where his behavior dooms him, and he has abandoned the attempt to understand himself. A cowardly young man who feels that his father has abandoned him, and so he has convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person, so much so that he cannot even commit suicide.\n\nAnd there is a 29-year-old woman who lives life so lightly as to barely allow the possibility of a human touch. She protects herself by having surface level relationships, and running away.\n\nBoth are extremely afraid of being hurt. Both are unsuitable-lacking the positive attitude-for what people call heroes of an adventure. But in any case, they are the heroes of this story.\n\nThey say, \"To live is to change.\" I started this production with the wish that once the production complete, the world, and the heroes would change. That was my \"true\" desire. I tried to include everything of myself in Neon Genesis Evangelion-myself, a broken man who could do nothing for four years. A man who ran away for four years, one who was simply not dead. Then one thought. \"You can't run away,\" came to me, and I restarted this production. It is a production where my only thought was to burn my feelings into film. I know my behavior was thoughtless, troublesome, and arrogant. But I tried. I don't know what the result will be. That is because within me, the story is not yet finished. I don't know what will happen to Shinji, Misato or Rei. I don't know where life will take them. Because I don't know where life is taking the staff of the production. I feel that I am being irresponsible. But... But it's only natural that we should synchronize ourselves with the world within the production. I've taken on a risk: \"It's just an imitation.\" And for now I can only write this explanation. But perhaps our \"original\" lies somewhere within there.\n\nJuly 17, 1995,\n\nIn the studio, a cloudy, rainy day.\n\nPS.\n\nBy the way, Shinji's name came from a friend of mine. Misato's name came from the hero of a manga. The name Ritsuko came from a friend of mine in middle school. I borrowed from everywhere. Even names that have no bearing on anything actually came from the countless rules that govern these things. It might be fun if someone with free time could research them.\n\nHideaki Anno: Ghibli ga Ippai Liner Notes\n\nGhibli ga Ippai (\"Full of Ghibli\") is a boxset of all Studio Ghibli movies (TKLO-50180 Tokuma Japan Communications), that was released on August 1996) and contains a section about Hideaki Anno in the liner notes.\n\ntranslated by Mark Neidengard\n\nSource http://keyframe.cjas.org/~mneideng/trans/misc/annoghib.txt\n\nAnno Hideaki. Director, producer. Born 1960, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Uto City. As an animator, participated in works including \"Superdimensional Fortress Macross\", \"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind\". Afterwards, established the shared stock company Gainax for the production of \"Royal Space Force - the Wings of Honneamise\". Also acted as Animation Director for that work. Later, as director he worked on \"Aim for the Top!\", \"Nadia of the Mysterious Seas\", \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", and others.\n\nThere are too many painful things for people to go on living in reality. Thus, humans run and hide in dreams. They watch films as entertainment. Animation, as a means to enjoy everything in a pure, fake world, is a realization of dreams and has become entrenched in film. In short, it is a thing where even coincidences are arranged and everything judged cinematically unnecessary can be excized. The negative feelings of the real world are no exception. If the director so desires, even malice toward others could be introduced straight into film. I guess that's one of the attractive things about anime. Changing the tribulation of reality into dreams and conveying that to the people... is that what our work is? For the sake of people who forget reality until the bill comes due, who want to devote themselves to happy fallacies. I guess that's our job in the entertainment and service sector.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Studio Ghibli's works is that, even if there are obsessive actions, there are things which appear to have not forfeited their goal. Forfeiting one's goal leads to despair, and is a sickness that can prove fatal. I wonder if Miya-san and his people are familiar with that feeling of despair. Perhaps they don't want to show that anguish to other people. I think they specifically don't want to display the negative things called self-loathing and complexes to others. That's why Studio Ghibli's works can't show anything but superficial happiness and a reproduction of reality with all the dirty things omitted. A fiction that imitates reality, and nothing more than a single dream. I suppose that is the governance of entertainment. And I think that that is one of the reasons that Studio Ghibli's works are safely watchable, brand name creations.\n\nI have no intention of denying that. All of Studio Ghibli's works are top level creations. But, I can't help but feel that something is missing. This is because, although the technique is there, I can no longer feel \"blood\", the \"blood\" that is surely flowing within everyone. I wonder when that happened? Studio Ghibli's works have, for me, become things that doesn't possess the image of \"Anime\", but rather of the so-called Japanese cinema, in other words, the Japanese movies that have now lost all their energy. That may be the reason that I feel that something is missing.\n\nBy the way, Mr. Miyazaki Hayao and Mr. Itano Ichirou are those I consider my teachers. I brag and say that I'm probably the only one in the world with that combination. I was greatly influenced, not just in the technical points of the animation craft, but in the mental portion of filmmaking. My posture on filmmaking is nothing more than an attempt to hang on to the things I learned from the two of them. I have nothing but words of gratitude for both of them.\n\nWhen I helped out as an animator for \"Nausicaa\", there's something that Miya-san often told me. It seems to have come from a Chinese sage, but \"There are three conditions for accomplishing something. Those are: Being young, Being poor, and Being unknown.\" And, \"No matter what, make friends.\" So I was taught. This was more than 12 years ago. Yes, I've known Miya-san approximately 12 years. In that time, I think Miya-san has achieved various things. However, he also lost many things.\n\nI think supporting a studio, that is, fighting to protect the organization against ruin, is painful as it piles up. A staff that strongly depends on you is also a double-edged sword. The height of the brand-name image and weight of the pressure from the world which prevents you from announcing even a short film without hiding your head under the excuse of it being an \"experiment\".\n\nHowever, I feel that he is still trying to obtain something new. Is that trying to throw away the past? But could that be the fate of those who go on making films? In any case, he is a person of deep craft regarding his desires.\n\nFinally, I'm looking forward to \"Mononoke Hime\", the latest in the series of seven works stretching from his masterpiece \"Nausicaa\" (the movie). No, I'm serious.\n\nPostscript. Yesterday, when I was in a state of mental collapse after my latest work had ended, I was moved deep within my heart by an encouraging phone call I received. The words of concern proceeding from the receiver became joy on my end as, with a exaltant face, my whole body was buoyed. In secret, I rejoiced in receiving some recognition for myself. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nMy master, the Lord Miyazaki Hayao-sama. From a (self-proclaimed) prodigal son, Anno Hideaki.\n\nHideaki Anno: Q&A on Evangelion (G.Press 06/1994)\n\nTranslation: Riki\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20121231204309/http://johakyu.net/lib/2007/10/2007-10-12-000603.php\n\nThis is probably the first ever \"Eva\" interview, which was published in the issue of \"G. Press\", an information magazine published by Gainax, right after the announcement of the production of Eva.\n\nWhat kind of anime is Evangelion?\n\nAnno: It's a giant robot story set in the near future. I think that's the closest description. However, this time there are no parody elements like in \"Gun Buster\". There is some comedy, but it's more serious. I'm hoping it will be an anime with an unusual mood.\n\nWhat kind of person is the main character?\n\nAnno: This is my first attempt at directing an anime. The main character is a boy. He is 14 years old and in the second year of junior high school.\n\nAre there any girls in the story?\n\nAnno: There will be many. There are a lot of girls. But I try to avoid stereotypical characters.\n\nDo you have a so-called theme?\n\nAnno: I guess a theme would be what I'm thinking about at the moment. Thinking about the complexes that anime fans (including myself) have, what makes us \"happy\"? How can I be \"happy\"? I guess that's about it. Well, there are many other things. The curse of the system, parents and children, and so on.\n\nWhat is your current situation?\n\nAnno: I'm busy with the original story, plot, setting design, script, and negotiations with outside parties. And then there's the storyboarding. I wonder when I'll be able to go home.\n\nFinally, please give some words to our readers.\n\nAnno: It's a pity that \"Uru\" is frozen for now, but \"Eva\" will be my first authentic animation in four years, since \"Nadia\". I want this anime to make people feel that they want to make animation. Please look forward to it.\n\nInterviewer: Thank you very much for your time.\n\nAnno: You're welcome. Please come again.\n\n・・・\n\nThe production company is a famous production company, and they are also planning to collaborate with a publishing company. There's still a lot to look forward to from Eva, and G-Press will be following it closely. Thank you.\n\n(Written by Kamimura)\n\nHideaki Anno and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto: Jan '95 Creators' Conversation (NewType 01/1995)\n\nQuotes from Jan 1995 publication\n\nTranslated by riki at https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rikki/hideaki-anno-yoshiyuki-sadamoto-interview-january-95\n\nSource:\n\nSource: http://anime-room.jp/modules/evangelion/eva-doc/siryou1.htm\n\nWe've been in the mid-90s before we know it, and the 21st century is around the corner.\n\nThese two men worked on such films as \"Wings of Honneamise\", \"Aim for the Top GunBuster\", \"Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water \" and so on as a core member of Gainax.\n\nI would like to ask you to talk about the state of animation in the coming 21st century, as well as your hopes and predictions.\n\nAnno: If I talk about limited to original works, I'd say that I have my doubts about the future of animation. Hope is essentially just a product of despair, so to talk about hope is to be desperate. And despair has another name, \"a deadly disease\". Japanese Animation today is in just such a circumstance. People are trying to cover it up by talking about hope as a self-defense. And the same goes for anime magazines. They're almost the same as information magazines.\n\nYou mean things have already come to that point?\n\nAnno: Yes. Nowadays, most anime is originally from manga or video games. That's because sponsors, creators and audiences don't really feel the need of anime. I think that as long as the manga they like are in the cell and they can hear the voices of their favorite voice actors, that's all that matters. Anime itself is already just a secondary thing. I feel that it has already lost its power as a core piece of media. I'm disappointed in this situation.\n\nSadamoto: But you're still trying to make a new work called \"Evangelion\", aren't you?\n\nAnno: It's a product of despair, though.\n\nSadamoto: In my case, I'll draw the manga version of \"Evangelion\" for Monthly Shōnen Ace, which will be released soon. The reason I chose the manga instead of the animation is because I was so desperate that I abandoned animation. Of course, I didn't come into the animation industry because I wanted to and people wanted me to as well like Anno, but because I wanted to satisfy my material desires. It is a rather ephemeral reason. So if you measure that \"despair\" in the same way as Anno, I think it's a bit of a problem.\n\nYou mean the difference in a personal attachment to animation?\n\nSadamoto: Of course, I have my own feelings about the films I've worked on. So it's like a difference in my approach to animation in general. To tell you the truth, I've been thinking about abandoning animation for a long time, but the people around me needed me, so I figured I'd stick around a bit longer. Metaphorically speaking, I was feeling like I'm Tsuge from \"Patlabor 2\" (laughs).\n\nAnno: I guess you'd like to see where it goes.\n\nSadamoto: However, I did have some hope for the future. After graduating from university, I worked for Telecom for a while, and then joined GAINAX on \"Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise\". I was also given my first opportunity to work on character design and art direction. For me, at least, all the work I did after that was based on some of the know-how I acquired during the \"Royal Space Force\" period. Then I decided to put an end to that, and there was a project in progress, but unfortunately I couldn't make it. That was a big factor in my decision to move into manga, but I don't think I've given up. Some people may think that I escaped, but for me I see it as a step in the right direction before my counterattack to animation.\n\nAnno: It's more of a disappointment than a despair. It's abandonment.\n\nSadamoto: Yes, abandoning the current animation, which is weirdly focused on commercialism. But there are a lot of people in GAINAX, including Anno, who haven't abandoned that animation yet. So if there's anything I can do to help them, I'm willing to help them.\n\nWhat made you decide to work on a new film despite these circumstances?\n\nAnno: Of course, it's for myself (laughs). The reason for creating things are always very personal. I don't think there's any need to talk more than that now. However, as long as it's a TV anime, it's a product, so I need to be careful not to turn it into a thing like masturbation. I've got to make this business work well including our own name value. I think it's hard to survive just by \"simply making anime\" nowadays.\n\nYou mean a media mix, which was popular at one point in time?\n\nAnno: Even though it's called a media mix, if it doesn't have a \"core\", it's just a bunch of weak things coming together. It would be nice if we could create a strong anime at the core of it, but in reality it's hard to create a powerful energy original anime. I want to do my best so that people don't call it the sadness of the TV generation, which is lack of originality. In order to do it, we have to start by improving the environment, and that's the hardest part. People are cold toward the anime industry (laughs).\n\nWhat exactly is wrong with the animation?\n\nAnno: There are a lot of things that can be said \"no\". But it's very difficult to talk about them in such a short time without misunderstanding. However, I've heard that the current state of anime is very similar to the end of the Japanese film industry, which is said to be at the end of its life. It may be that anime has reached the end of its life as a media content and is coming to an end. However, even if it's just a matter of age, I can't deny that we are lacking in power and energy today. Compared to 10 years ago, it's obvious that it's not as good as it was, including what our fans have. I think this is partly because of the dispersal of energy into manga and games. Damn. It's dangerous to glorify the past too much, take a bad view of reality, and long for the future.\n\nSadamoto: I have a small kid, he's most fascinated by the very first \"Ultraman\" after all. I'm sure that this is because of the power that only epochal works have, but recent anime, especially the original ones, have very little of this power. Of course, part of the reason for this is on us. Come to think of it, why did you decide to make your upcoming new work a robot thing? I only remember asking why, and I don't think I was convinced at the time.\n\nAnno: As a commercial product (laughs). No, seriously. I thought the best way for me to get my original project through would be to make a robot, space, or beautiful young girl one. Because I thought these categories would have the best product value. It's easy for sponsors to pay for it.\n\nI think anime keeps hanging in there despite of the circumstance.\n\nHow do you feel about it?\n\nAnno: I think that's a situation of just \"making\" things. I think we should be grateful for this situation. It's important that there's anime job. Anime is still a viable business. However, I also feel that anime is moving into a closed world. I don't want to be satisfied with where I am and want to make our anime something we can be proud of to the world. People say that TV anime is cheap, but compared to other TV shows, it's made on a budget that's about as high as a samurai drama. It means anime is a valuable product. I would like anime to get positioned closer to the center of the economy. It's hard to be the king of entertainment, though (laughs).\n\nWhat do you think why you still stick with the original?'\n\nAnno: I think that's because my presence remains in the film. It's rather straightforward. It's a pleasant sensation. Filmmaking itself is quite a pleasant sensation. In any case, animation is supposed to be interesting.\n\nHideaki Anno: Anno Started Production on Eva (Newtype 04/1995)\n\nTranslation: Riki\n\nSource: http://anime-room.jp/modules/evangelion/eva-doc/siryou2.htm#top\n\nAnno started production on Eva\n\nWhen we visited GAINAX in late January.\n\nThe new TV anime \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" had already reached the final phase for the first and second episodes.\n\nAt the beginning of this interview,\n\nAnno Hideaki said, Don't you think robot animation is outdated?\n\nThis is a stimulating statement.\n\nRobot anime is certainly not a fresh genre with more than 20 years of history.\n\nBut if he thinks so, why does he participate in the planning and directing of a robot anime?\n\nAnno: One of the reasons I thought it would be nice to do a robot anime on TV that a toy company wouldn't sponsor.\n\nHe said he wouldn't have done this anime if he had a sponsor who had interfered in the mechanic design, etc.\n\nHe also says, Robot anime is stuck in a pattern, so I wanted to break that pattern.\n\nThis is a completely different stance from the usual robot animation made through tie-ups with toy companies, which is the norm.\n\nIt wasn't an ambitious project that he started out with, but once he started working on it, it turned out to be a very \"hard and heavy\" robot animation.\n\nBy the way, he had the following in mind while working on this film.\n\nAnno: For example, I wonder if people who are over 20 years old and like robot and bishojo(*1) anime are really happy. If they never knew that there is a greater happiness, they might be happy for the rest of their lives. But I've begun to question that kind of happiness.\n\n1) Bishōjo is a Japanese term for a beautiful young girl, usually below young adult age.\n\nFor anime fans who like robots and bishojo, this story may be startled.\n\nThe main character Shinji Ikari is never portrayed as an otaku, but he is considered to be passive and not socialised.\n\nAnno: While making this anime, I want to think about what happiness means to such a person.\n\nOf course, that should be told as a drama in the anime. Well, It's exciting, isn't it? He also told me this story:\n\nAnno: I haven't finished it yet, but I think the first two episodes are going to be a true reflection of my recent 'mood'. When I realized that, I thought, 'Oh, that's good.\n\nThat must mean that his inner self and the anime he is making is very close to each other. It's also interesting.\n\nAnno: I think it's going to be a more cult anime than Nadia, because I don't think there's ever going to be an anime that has that kind of 'feel' to it.\n\nI wonder what that \"mood\" is. I'm sure that anime fans will be able to experience something they've never seen before with \"Evangelion\". I have a feeling that they will.\n\nHideaki Anno: Our Happiness: The Happiness Depicted by \"Evangelion\" (Newtype 11/95)\n\nTranslation: Riki\n\nSource: https://home.gamer.com.tw/creationDetail.php?sn=863308\n\nSpeaker\n\nHideaki Anno\n\nKotono Mitsuishi, a Japanese voice actress, singer, and narrator\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara, a Japanese director, writer, artist, and music producer\n\nNewtype\n\nWe, the editors, have planned a special roundtable discussion to get to the essence of \"Evangelion\". In attendance, of course, was director Hideaki Anno. Also in attendance was Kotono Mitsuishi, who plays the important heroine Misato Katsuragi. The special guest was director Kunihiko Ikuhara, who is also a close friend of Anno. The theme of the film is \"about happiness\".\n\n・・・\n\nNewtype: Now that you've seen the recording of Evangelion, how did you like it?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: It was great. I could feel the high tension of the staff. The actors are very eccentric and have a lot of charm. Ogata-san, who plays Shinji, has a nice neutral vibe. She has a sense of cleanliness that you don't find in male voice actors.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: Is this the first time you've seen an Evangelion recording?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Yes, it was my first time. I've seen the dubbing before, though.\n\nNewtype: What was your impression when you first saw Evangelion?\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: When I saw the video of the first episode, I couldn't help but shout 'ooh'. After that, I just kept admiring it, going \"Ooh, ooh!\"\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: I thought it was nostalgic when I first saw it.\n\nNewtype: Nostalgic?\n\nHideaki Anno: Oh man, but I'm trying to make a '90s anime.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: No, I don't mean old. When I was watching animation in the past, I thought that the younger generation would come out and change animation in the future. But that didn't happen. So when I saw \"Evangelion\" for the first time, I felt nostalgic because I felt like I had encountered the kind of animation that I thought would change in the future. Well, that's just my impression of \"Evangelion\" from 10 years ago, and I have a different impression of it now. But I'm sure it brought me back to the feeling I had when I was a fan.\n\nNewtype: What kind of work is \"Evangelion\" for you, Mitsuishi-san?\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: I haven't finished it yet, so it's hard to say. It's a work with a unique \"smell\". Director Anno also said that the characters in this animation don't speak honestly. The only ones who are honest are the boys at school.\n\nHideaki Anno: It's true, it's only those two (Toji Suzuhara and Kensuke Aida).\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: Pen-Pen is also a character that brings me comfort.\n\nHideaki Anno: I'm sorry, they're all twisted.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Can I ask you something strange?\n\nHideaki Anno: Sure.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: The other day, in an interview with Newtype, you talked about 'seeking happiness...'. What was that?\n\nHideaki Anno: No, I didn't really talk about happiness all that much, it's just that the part that was covered in the article was the part where I talked about happiness.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: I see. The reason why I asked you that is because I saw \"Die Hard 3\" the other day. But it was a crappy movie. Before that, I saw \"Forrest Gump\" because it had a good reputation, but it was also a crappy movie. What's stupid is that they're both about finding happiness.\n\nAbsolute evaluation standards and absolute happiness\n\nHideaki Anno: Isn't that what all American movies are like these days?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: That's true. \"Die Hard 3\" is also a movie about the search for happiness. It starts with a story about discrimination against black people, and at the end, there's a guy who's like a communist. In other words, it's a story about happiness as a comparative theory.\n\nNewtype: Comparative Theory?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Yes. Sounds like America is poor and there is a lot of discrimination, but we are still happy, and we are lucky to be Americans. When I saw that, I felt dizzy and wondered if America was really that hard.Just then, I read Newtype, and there was an article titled \"In Search of Happiness\".\n\nHideaki Anno: No, I'm not talking about happiness as a comparative theory. What I've always thought about is not that it's okay to compare it to something else, but that it's absolute. What I want is an absolute evaluation.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Are you saying you want absolute happiness?\n\nHideaki Anno: No, I mean, don't you want absolute evaluation in many ways, not just happiness?\n\nNewtype: Are you saying you want absolute evaluation for \"Evangelion\" as well?\n\nHideaki Anno: I crave for it. It doesn't mean much to me if people say that my work is better than other anime. I want to make a work that I can say is good when I look at it, not when I compare it to other works. \"Absolutes\" exist only in the context of ideas. I want to make a work that makes something that is impossible exist only in the mind and imagination of the person. As for me, I have my own absolute evaluation standards.\n\nNewtype: The criteria for evaluating \"Evangelion\"?\n\nHideaki Anno: Yes, I do. When I made \"Evangelion\", I had an ideal image in mind. I thought it should be at least this interesting. So if it doesn't reach that level, no matter how many people around me say it's interesting, I can't evaluate it in my own mind.\n\nNewtype: The only place to measure whether \"Evangelion\" is interesting or not is in \"Evangelion\"?\n\nHideaki Anno: I guess that's what I'm saying. Even if people around me say it's interesting, I still feel that it should be more interesting than it is. The reason why it doesn't become interesting is because I'm not good enough. Returning to the topic of happiness, I think I feel unhappy when I feel that way.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Hmm, what I'm hoping for from Evangelion is that it will be a drama that shows us an embodiment, a concrete way to be happy.\n\nHideaki Anno: You mean the way to embody happiness?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: \"Yes, yes. There are many young people who think that they will be happy if their current situation changes. They think that because the situation is bad, they can't be happy or do well. That's not true. What makes us happy is our ability to materialize - to give shape to our happiness.\n\nHideaki Anno: Is happiness tangible? Is it something that can be easily put into words?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Happiness can be expressed in many ways. For example, I'm happy to be dating so many girls.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: Oh man... (laughs)\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: (In a panic) I'm just talking about an example.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: But Ikuhara-san, when you think about happiness, that's the first thing that comes up. It kind of makes sense, doesn't it?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: What makes sense? That's rude (laughs).\n\nEveryone: (laughs).\n\nNewtype: What is your happiness, Mitsuishi?\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: I can't talk about it here.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: That's right. But you're happy, aren't you, Mitsuishi?\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: Probably. I think the fact that you don't feel unhappy is happiness itself.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: That's what's important. People who think about how they can make themselves happy are already unhappy at that point.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: Just the other day, I was so happy to find out that my favorite actor's house and mine were near each other.\n\n・・・\n\nShinji's 5-step conjugation and Misato's happiness\n\nNewtype: Ms. Mitsuishi, is there any story you've played that you'd like to tell?\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: For me, it was the scene where Kaji-san and Misato got together. I'm a girl, so I like romantic scenes.\n\nNewtype: What about you, Ikuhara?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: I'm curious about Rei's line.\n\nHideaki Anno: Rei has a good reputation. Why is that?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Because it's good description. Rei says the same line to Shinji over and over again. I thought that was interesting.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: It makes you think about what the lines are going to be. It's even more interesting because there are parts of it that make sense.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: I think she doesn't know how to use words, and doesn't know how to communicate with others. Rei is unconsciously using those words, but Shinji is overthinking it.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: Shinji gets nervous and wonders what she meant by that line.\n\nHideaki Anno: To tell you the truth, I've already given away the whole story at the end of the first volume of the comic, but the story of Evangelion is about people who are clumsy in their communication. It's about a boy who is afraid of contact with others and keeps to himself, and a 29-year-old single woman who protects herself by escaping into superficial relationships. It's a story about how these people change.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: A 29-year-old single woman is Misato, right? Will Misato be happy in the end?\n\nHideaki Anno: I don't know. She might not. I don't know what happiness is.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: What does happiness mean to Misato?\n\nHideaki Anno: I don't think she'll be happy if she gets together with Kaji.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Is it wrong to get together with Kaji?\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: There is a theory that it is better not to be with the person you love the most.\n\nNewtype: Does Misato love Kaji the most?\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: Well. I can't say for sure because I can't find anyone else who might be a potential love interest.\n\nHideaki Anno: \"No, I don't know. Misato might fall in love with Shinji.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: Hmm, we won't know for sure until about ten years from now.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: But isn't Misato always so worried about Shinji? When the enemy attacked, and Shinji and Rei were both blown up, she said, \"Shinji-kun!\" even when they were both blown up. Doesn't she care about Rei who blew up with him?\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: It's a heroine's fate to shout out the hero's name. Besides, there are many ways to use the same \"Shinji-kun\", such as the five-level conjugation.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: What's the fifth conjugation?\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: The script says \"Shinji-kun,\" \"Shinji-kun,\" and \"Shinji-kun,\" but they're all different. Some say \"Shinji-kun ♡\" cheerfully, some shout \"Shinji-kun\", and some say \"Shinji-kun\" with a bit of a scowl.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: I see.\n\nUltimate Individualism and the Happiness of Boys\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: I wonder what happiness is for a boy.\n\nHideaki Anno: I think it's getting the girl you like.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: But after you get her, you'll go back to your work, won't you?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: How can you say such a thing?\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: Because I haven't seen too many that aren't.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Is that something girls don't like?\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: As a girl, I don't like it.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: What do you do in such a case? In general, you know.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: Girls will blame boys.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: I wonder what boys would do if they were blamed.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: I think it's a case by case thing. Some people will break up with her because of it, and some people will think back on what he did wrong and follow through with hiswork.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: I wonder why boys are so eager to work. I've never done that before.\n\nHideaki Anno: Oh, you're just trying to be a good boy.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: No, I'm not. Seriously.\n\nHideaki Anno: I think it's because boys are only thinking about themselves. Even when they think about girls, I think they're actually doing it for themselves.\n\nNewtype: What do you mean?\n\nHideaki Anno: There was once a manga in which the main character abandoned Koshien (a high school baseball tournament) for the girl he loved. I couldn't believe that kind of thing. It seems like hypocrisy to say \"for the sake of the woman you love\". It's like he's saying \"for the girl\" as an excuse when he's really just following his own desires and pleasures. I don't think men are like that, they are more self-centered.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: A man is not supposed to think about a girl...\n\nHideaki Anno: That's right. In other words, I'm only doing it because it makes me feel good to be thinking about girls. The word \"man\" is also created by the world of ideas. If you don't think of yourself as a man, there is no such thing as a man. I think it's a very vague thing. I think that's why people have been saying \"if you're a man\" or \"if you were a man\" over and over again for a long time. If we don't constantly remind ourselves of this, \"men\" will disappear. To put it another way, I think that everyone is only thinking about themselves. That's why I think it's okay for people to be individualistic.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: But it's difficult to maintain individualism.\n\nHideaki Anno: It's difficult. Especially in Japan.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Ultimate happiness is related to ultimate individualism, isn't it? Isn't it determined by how much individualism you can maintain?\n\nHideaki Anno: Hmmm. Happiness can also mean a state of being free from stress and frustration.\n\nNewtype: It depends on the definition of the word happiness.\n\nHideaki Anno: One of the definitions is that it would be nice if the present moment could last forever. I wish I was taking a bath with a girl.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi: Is it happiness?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Yes, it's a happy moment.\n\nHideaki Anno: It's pretty nice to take a bath with a girl, isn't it?\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: Yeah. (To editor) Oh, please cut what I just said (laughs).\n\nHideaki Anno: The conversation has taken a turn for the worse, hasn't it?\n\nNewtype: Well, I guess it's time to call it a night.\n\nHideaki Anno: That's right. I've had a lot to drink and I'm really tired after the post-production. Well, Iku-chan, let's go out for a drink after this.\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: What? Then we can drink until the last train (laughs).\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara, \"The Awesomeness of No Vagueness\".\n\nKunihiko Ikuhara: After the roundtable discussion, I had a thought. In this column, I'd like to talk about it. I'd like to talk about what Anno-san said about wanting an absolute evaluation.\n\nNot only me, but many creative people say things like, \"It's a good work even though there wasn't enough time in the schedule,\" or \"For a TV animation, you did a great job.\" The truth is that whether or not there was enough time is not the same as evaluating the work. We all know that, but by saying things like \" in spite of ......\" or \"for ......\", we are making things relative and making the truth vague.\n\nBut Mr. Anno doesn't tolerate such vagueness. I was surprised by this. He eliminates all such excuses and strives for perfection within his own values.\n\nHe's trying to achieve perfection in his values, in story, in expression, in theme, in everything. I think that evaluations like \"the mecha action isn't good enough, it's not satisfying, but the theme is great\" are meaningless to Anno.\n\nIt's easy to say in words, but it's a tremendous task to actually do it.\n\nAnno-san and I have different ways of working and different directions. But he's a really inspiring person.\n\nHideaki Anno: Special Interview to celebrate being made into a movie (Newtype 06/1996)\n\nTranslation: Riki\n\nSource: http://anime-room.jp/modules/evangelion/eva-doc/siryou3.htm#top\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is the first major wave in the sea of the anime world in more than a decade.\n\nIt has already been 17 years since the first series of Mobile Suit Gundam was aired. This was the era when teenagers packed theaters to watch \"Space Battleship Yamato\" and \"Galaxy Express 999\". The so-called anime boom peaked in 1980 and lasted for two to three years before and after. Many of today's Newtype readers must have been unborn or, at best, babies.\n\nAt that time, every teenager accepted anime without any resistance. But later on, watching anime became a \"special thing\" for a teenager.\n\nParticularly in the mid-1980s, after original video animations, anime was subdivided to meet the needs of fans, and before we knew it, it had become a genre that \"ordinary people\" would never watch.\n\nOf course, \"Sailor Moon\" and \"Dragon Ball\" are popular. But they are just for children.\n\nAnd Hayao Miyazaki's (or Studio Ghibli's) films bring the ordinary people to theaters during the summer vacations. But they are not for anime fans at all, as a low-risk choice when you go on a date.\n\nThe film made for anime fans, and even the ordinary people says this is awesome, we have been waiting for such a film to be born.\n\nThat is Evangelion.\n\nEvangelion received enthusiastic support not only from anime fans, but also from ordinary children, adults sensitive to cutting-edge culture, and former fans who returned to anime after a 10-year absence, and the movement continues to grow even after the TV broadcast ended.\n\nIt's been a month since the last episode, which ended without any of the mysteries being solved and caused controversy.\n\nWe were able to talk to director Anno Hideaki, whose schedule has finally returned to normal.\n\nAnno: How I am now? ---Tired (laughs)\n\nAnno began to speak, choosing his words carefully.\n\nAnno: I worked on Evangelion as a live performance. I didn't do it theoretically, whether it was the story or the placement of the characters. As I worked, I took in various opinions and analyzed my own psychology, and I thought, 'Oh, this is how it should be. I found the words afterwards.\n\nAt first I thought it was going to be a simple robot anime. But if the story goes mainly in a school, it won't be the same as other robots anime. So I decided to make a protagonist with two identities: the school and the organization. I didn't think too much about it in the beginning.\n\nAs the staff gradually joined in, and when someone's guitar began to play, the drums and bass changed in response to the ad-libbing, the sense of live performance came alive in \"Eva\". The end of the performance is when the broadcast is over. That's why I can't start the next script until the previous one is finished. It takes me longer than in a normal production.\n\nAfter finishing the script, I go back and review it. If I found a wrong part, I fix it on the storyboard. That's why we couldn't do the final episode until the last episode was approaching.\n\nAfter all, the film Evangelion has two aspects: a story and a live documentary of Anno's own emotional journey. This is a reflection of his strong will \"not to lie about what I want to do.\n\nAnno had to face his own \"mental problems\" by getting involved in Eva.\n\nAnno: I made the main character 14 years old because he is \"more than a child, less than an adult\". You can live alone, and you can live in the company of others. If it was centuries ago, you'd be regarded as an adult. In those days, you had only 50 years to live, so you had to be independent at age 14 or so. Nowadays, people have more than 70 years to live, so if you are Japanese, there are many people who are still dependent on their parents even when they reach 20 years of age.\n\nThere is also the problem that parents may be making you dependent on them. They want children to be children forever. Including that, I think 14 years old is appropriate for the theme of the film, because it's an age when you can be mentally independent.\n\nSpeaking of improvisation, in two episodes I came up with a word that would be the vertical axis of the story, the Human Instrumentality Project, but I hadn't decided what it would mean. I just liked how that kanji looks (laughs). In the world of \"Eva\", the population is halved, but it's a replacement theory, and the world where the human population is actually halved is the animation world. I think the anime industry is the same as the world of the anime, where there used to be a lot of momentum, but the number of people in the industry has been decreasing and it's a closed world.\n\nCome to think of it, a couple of years ago, Anno said, \"The world of Gundam is the mind-set of a director named Yoshiyuki Tomino. The world of \"Gundam\" is the mind-set of a director named Yoshiyuki Tomino, and Char, who struggles like Don Quixote to free the people in the closed world of the space colony (an anime company), is Tomino's own replacement theory.\n\nIt would be interesting to replace \"Eva\" with a story about a group of amateurs, Nerf, or Gainax, dominated by director Anno, taking on the challenge of a world where professional soldiers are unable to break through the current situation.\n\nAnno: Is that so? By all accounts, Nerv is a group of amateurs. I make it look like a military formality, but it's not an army. I didn't want it to be an army. I think it's funny because anime magazines usually says Misato as a \"quality soldier\". It makes me wonder what makes her look quality. If she was, I feel sorry for the soldier. She makes plans in a willy-nilly way. It was all just a dumb luck. Ritsuko is the only one who has a decent strategy plan.\n\nAs for Misato, she is both subject and object, and she is partially similar to me in the real world. Earlier in the February issue of Newtype, Yuki Masami drew a picture quoting episode 7, and even though it's not that straightforward, Nerv has a similar meaning to it.\n\nHere, Anno's mental is synchronized with the Tokyo-03 in 2015. After all, the city where there was no one else in the city describes the anime industry got slightly crowded with the immigrants who wanted to watch \"Eva\". At the same time, however, Anno was having a frustration towards some anime fans.\n\nThe word \"Human Instrumentality Project\" sounds from science fiction indeed. That is the \"completion of the missing mind\" of us modern people. To be honest, this concept a bit of surprised me. It is something that was not expected at the beginning of the program, something that people are missing. I wonder what kind of conflicts the director had to go through before he settled on a form of \"heart\".\n\nAnno: I wasn't aware of the mental problem, but in Japan, the U.S. and some countries, material desires are almost always satisfied. I think the mental problem arises when people are already satisfied with their lives. If you have to worry about the foods for tomorrow, you don't care how others think about you, I mean, you'd work harder to make a better life. So in this age of satiation, the issue of the mind becomes a theme. I ended up there by going through Eva.\n\nI couldn't draw it out for various reasons, but as far as episodes 25 and 26 (the last episode) in the original storyline, I even had the plot for episode 25. Episode 26 was abandoned at the plot stage. We'll rework the original episodes 25 and 26 in the video and LD that will be released next year, but for episode 26, we're going to rework it again visually. If I can't come up with anything, I'll take that plot apart and do it again. The episodes 25 and 26 that aired on TV were a direct reflection of how I was feeling at that point in time, so I'm happy with them. I don't regret it.\n\nMarch 4. After the end of the voice recording of \"Evangelion\" episode 25, the staff and cast members held a party near the Tabak recording studio in Tokyo.\n\nAnno: At that time, the script for the final episode was not yet up. It was all done the following week. We only had three days of drawing work in fact. To be honest, I don't think it even needed to be drawn up as an expression. In fact, it should have been fine for me to come out and talk. I thought that'd still work, but as expected, they refused to let me.\n\nI used the non-cellucciated parts, the storyboard drawings, on purpose. It's not that I couldn't make it in time or anything. Anyway, I wanted to free myself from cell animation. Cell is just symbolism. If you see Asuka's picture with a marker and hear Miyamura's voice, it's more than enough to make it Asuka. I didn't want to get hung up on cells anymore.\n\nBut that doesn't mean we're going to go to CGI. I just wanted to tell that animation can function on line drawings alone as a medium of expression. I wanted to say something to those idiots who complain that \"it's not a finished product because it's not celluloid\" or \"it's not celluloid so it's corner-cutting\".\n\nIt's a liberation. I just wanted them to destroy the stereotypes that they have. It has gone beyond \"I can't recognize her as a human being unless it's a cell,\" and it's almost a fetishism.\n\nThe first time I tried was in episode 16 when I made the line speak. Animation is just symbols, so it's a lie from the first place. It's fiction. No one thinks of it as a documentary.\n\nBut my own sense of live performance is that I want to put documentary in the film. It would be a rare way to destroy symbolism in TV animation. When the line drawings came out, some people in the anime industry called it lazy, but it's no good if they see it as lazy. They don't realize that we are aiming at it as an \"expression,\" but the conception doesn't exist anymore in their minds.\n\nI think there may be other ways, but in the last episode, it's still a pure word play.\n\nSome of the core fans were in denial about the episode 26. Of course, it is true that there are fans who felt frustrated in that it did not depict the original storyline. I hear that there are many straightforward \"verbal attacks\" in online service(*1). On the other hand, this last episode recorded the highest viewership of \"Evangelion\", and the viewers who do not usually watch anime said, \"Evangelion is amazing!\n\n1) A method of communicating data between a personal computer and a server (or node or host) in a host station using specialized software, etc., via a communication line and services provided by it. Its heyday was in the late 1980s and 1990s, when it gradually declined as the Internet was later opened up to the general public.\n\nAnno: A lot of people from online service are stubborn and unable to think in a flexible way. Even though they're doing it in their own room, they get the impression that they're connected to the whole world. But that's just \"information\". There's no way to verify that information, but they feel like they have it all figured out. That comfort feeling is the pitfall. Besides, they've lost their sense of value for information.\n\nAnother thing is they can do it anonymously. For example, they would call me names and say, \"Anno, kiss my ass.\" If I was next to him, I might hit him. If I said this, I'd probably get objections from online service, but that would be the graffiti-covered toilet. You don't have to write your name on it. It goes on and on in his room.\n\nThe system is great, but the people using can't master it well. Of course, it's not for everyone. But it's very hard to find normal people there. Anyway, I don't have time to be bothered by them now. I just want to tell them to get to know the world a little better and get back to reality.\n\nFor example, the story that episodes 25 and 26 will be retaken has already been sent to online service by Gainax. This is because if we don't give out accurate information, people will get a lot of fake information, but as soon as we give it out, we got some ridiculous statement that it's a money-making scheme. It shows they don't understand economic logic, and they don't realize the hypocrisy of their own hypocrisy in believing that they are justified in saying such things.\n\nIt seems to me that \"Evangelion\" has only its negative elements (laughs). Anime fans are made fun of because they don't realize how childish their ideas are. It's because they don't leave their room. They only stay in the safety of their own room.\n\nAnime fans have nothing to be certain about in their minds. That's why they look to anime for help. It's not like Terayama Shuji's \"Throw away the book, go to the city\", but they have to go to the city and socialize with various people.\n\nThe reason why I can say that is because I am aware that I don't have anything in me... I'm so stupid that I've been an anime fan for 21 years and I've only realized that at the age of 35 (laughs).\n\nUnfortunately, that's it all for this time. There's a lot more to hear and talk about. Newtype would like to hear from Anno several more times in the future, and we hope to introduce his comments in the next issue in the form of a separate supplement to the magazine.\n\nIf you'd like to \"talk\" to the director, send a postcard or letter to Newtype, it's okay to ask questions, feedback or criticism.\n\nAs long as you are willing to \"talk\" with him in the magazine, he will surely respond to you (*2).\n\n2) This project did not come to fruition.\n\nHideaki Anno and Yuko Miyamura: Say 'Anta Baka' To Me! (Animage 06/1996)\n\nAnimage 1996 Anno X Miyamura discusion\n\n1996/06/10\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20080127001226/http://jo%C2%ADhakyu.net/lib/2007/07/2007-07-27-000535.php\n\nTranslation by: Xard\n\nAnno: First of all, men who want to be spoiled by women like this line without a doubt. If such a man is told \"anta baka\" or the like in a gentle voice it is enough to make him fall madly in love. 06/1996\n\nAM: Isn't director Anno like that himself?\n\nAnno: I'm like that without a doubt.\n\nAM: Miyamura, do you understand this feeling?\n\nMiyamura: My position is that of a woman, so not really. In my case, rather than Asuka-chan something like \"aaahhh I want to pin down a cold girl like Rei-chan\" would be a preferred scenario.\n\nAM: She'd be at your mercy?\n\nMiyamura: She'd be at my mercy. She wouldn't seem to say anything after the deed either.\n\nAM: \"After the deed\"? (laugh)\n\nMiyamura: You know, Asuka seems like she'd make a lot of noise, if pinned down.\n\nAnno: She seems like she'd make many orders.\n\nMiyamura: Exactly. For example \"stop!\" or \"it hurts!\"\n\nAnno: In the end you'd get told \"you suck\" by her (laugh)\n\nMiyamura: (what, you mean by me?) (laugh)\n\nAM: (in a somewhat dumbfounded state) Is Yuko Miyamura a man...\n\nMiyamura: IF I was a man... it's that kind of talk.\n\nAnno: Rei seems like she'd be less trouble.\n\nAM: She is the most popular character, Rei that is.\n\nMiyamura: I wonder if everyone has such desires.\n\nAnno: They do, don't they. People who are S (sadistic) go for Rei for sure, with their sadistic desire. On the other hand, I think M (masochistic) types go for Asuka. As for Misato, people who are her generation agewise but psychologically childish are inclined towards her.\n\nMiyamura: But don't humans have both (S&M) sides?\n\nAnno: Yes, they do. Fundamentally everyone has. It's only a question of which side is more dominant.\n\n[...]\n\nAnno: Asuka is a good character. I had no intention to become so attached to her. (In creating a character) feedback from the performer is quite important, so it might be because of Miyamura Asuka ended up like that.\n\n[...]\n\nMiyamura: I'm sure he'll do something (for Asuka) with the video!\n\nAnno: Please don't expect too much (laugh)\n\nAM: Thank you very much\n\nTL notes: 1. I've translated Miyamura's description of Rei as \"cold girl\", but the original expression 無機質な女の子 could also be rendered as \"inhumane girl\" or \"robotic girl\" or even \"inorganic girl\". Cold girl is the best choice in terms of nuance. 2. 押し倒す = oshitaosu means 1. to pin down; to knock down; to push (and hold) somebody down (esp. with sexual connotations)​ So the rapey vibe in what I have translated as \"pin down\" is not accidental at all. 3. Asuka's post-coital judgement on her partner as ヘタクソ or hetakuso I've translated as \"you suck\". I just want to remove any potential ambiguity: no, this is not a moral judgement or whatever, Asuka is dissing her hypothetical partner for being unskillful.\n\nAlternate Translation\n\n\"I want to be told, \"What are you, stupid?\"\n\nTranslation by: Riki\n\nMr. Anno has been written as if he was drunk.\n\nHowever, in reality, he was not that drunk.\n\nAccording to him, \"I added the word 'drunk' later because it was boring if I left it as it was. I didn't drink that much.\"\n\nFrom \"Hideaki Anno: Schizo Evangelion\"\n\nMonthly Animage July 1996 issue, Hideaki Anno and Yuko Miyamura\n\n-When we saw the last episode of Evangelion, we thought, \"What? No way. Is this it?\" The same feeling that we felt when we watched the final episode of Evangelion must have been felt by the voice actors who played the roles.\n\nYuko Miyamura, representative of your feelings, boldly approaches the core of \"Evangelion\" and director Anno's true feelings!\n\nAnimage(AM): What's most talked about now is the final episode of the TV series. How did you feel about it, Miyamura-san, who has been playing the role of Asuka?\n\nMiyamura: Hmm, I felt like I was left behind. In episode 24, Asuka ends up lying on a hospital bed with her eyes open, and that's where my image of Asuka stops, so please do something about it, director!\n\nAM: She's still lying on the bed with her cheeks looking very hollow. I wonder when Asuka will be complemented.\n\nAnno: I wonder when she will be complemented.\n\nMiyamura: Oi, what are you going to do if the director says so?\n\nAM: I think it was a total of 25 episodes, 26 episodes (the final episode), and one story.\n\nAnno: Yes, we stretched it out and changed the story a bit. That still wasn't enough, so it's not like we stretched it out. It wasn't long enough at all. After all, the scenario was ‘written and sent off’.\n\nAM: What do you mean by 'written and sent off'?\n\nAnno: In short, if you can't do episode 1, you can't do episode 2, and if you can't do episode 2, you can't do episode 3. From episode 1 to episode 6, we messed things up. We would do episode 5 or 6, and then go back to episode 3, and so on. I wanted to create a certain scene, but then I realized that I didn't need the whole scene. The thing I wanted to do the most turned out to be something I didn't need. It's like a live performance. I make everything according to the situation at the time.\n\nAM: I'm looking at it from here, it's extremely detailed, well I'm sure it will all add up, and the setting is very well thought out, which is amazing.\n\nAnno: In fact, until about halfway through the Human Instrumentality Project, we hadn't really decided what we were going to instrumentalize in terms of human instrumentality.\n\nAM: So, of course, there was no explanation to the voice actors as to what The Human Instrumentality Project is.\n\nMiyamura: There was no explanation at all.\n\nAnno: (Pretending to be innocent) Oh, there was no explanation? (Not eating, just drinking.)\n\nMiyamura: So when I ask, \"What is The Human Instrumentality Project?\" he just says, \"Well, I don't know.\"\n\nAnno: It's not that I was playing around, it's just that I hadn't really decided.\n\nAM: It's amazing that you made it to episode 24.\n\nAnno: Well, it's like a miracle (laughs). It was all done live. While we were playing, we ran out of performance time, performers, instruments, money, and even the score.\n\nAM: Anno-san, did you create your previous TV series with this kind of live feeling?\n\nAnno: I also had a half-live feeling when I worked on Nadia, but this is the first time I laid out the rails from scratch. It was like 'I've come this far, so lay out the rails for the next week.' So who knows where it will go?\n\nAM: The actors must have been working under a sense of uncertainty.\n\nMiyamura: In the first half, we were shown the storyboards ahead of time, so we knew roughly what was going to happen next. But after one episode or so, there was a point where we had no idea what was going to happen next.\n\nAnno: I couldn't even finish the storyboard for the last episode.\n\nAM: Was there anything whiter on the recording screen than the storyboard?\n\nAnno: It wasn't white, was it? The names of the actors and even their lines were written on the screen (laughs). For episode 25, we did the post recording with just the names written on the screen. But then I realized that if I wrote the dialogue along with the names, there would be no paper noise when they turned the script. I thought that was a good idea (laughs).\n\nAM: But as an actor, how did that work out for you?\n\nMiyamura: Well, it's episode 26, right? The only situation is that Shinji is standing on the stage like this, talking to himself, so just having the lines written like that didn't feel strange to me.\n\nAM: I think that was directed in a very theatrical way.\n\nMiyamura: When I was doing stage performances at university, I still do it now, but we used to incorporate that kind of feeling into certain scenes, and I also used to do it a lot in etude (practice) at university. Because it's easier to think for yourself when there's nothing around you. But the folding chair is theatrical, but I felt it was more like counseling.\n\nAnno: Oh, really?\n\nMiyamura: In counseling, for example, if a man goes to a counseling session because he has had a huge quarrel with his wife and is very angry with her, he is first made to sit on one of the two chairs facing each other. The first thing they do is put him in one of the two chairs facing each other, and they make him say all the things he wants to say, such as what happened, what disgusted him, and what his wife is doing. Then he is asked to sit on the other side of the chair he was sitting on, and he is asked to put himself in his wife's shoes and talk about what has happened. The way you look at yourself when you sit on this chair is different from the way you look at yourself when you sit on the other chair, so you can look at yourself calmly. I heard that there is such a therapy. I thought it was similar to that.\n\nAnno: I didn't know that. Why didn't you tell me such an interesting story before, while we were making it?\n\nMiyamura: After I saw the finished product, I thought that's what the director must have meant.\n\nAnno: I really didn't know that. Maybe I'm doing it unconsciously.\n\nAM: Does that mean it might be true, if asked?\n\nAnno: That's right.\n\nI guess that's how things become more and more 'konjac questions and answers(*1)'(konjac mondo’ in Japanese).\n\n1) Ridiculous questions and answers. Also, misguided responses.\n\nMiyamura: What is 'konjac mode'? (Mishearing 'mondo' and 'mode')\n\nAnno: It's not 'konjac mode,' it's 'konjac question and answer.\n\nMiyamura: When you said 'konjac mode,' I wondered what you were switching.\n\nAnno: No, 'question and answer'! (laughs)\n\nAM: I've always thought you were a bit of an eccentric person. It's interesting to hear about animation with a sense of live performance. Watching the last two episodes was like a live performance for me. Most of today's videos can be bought and watched whenever you want. But watching the last two episodes of the TV series in real time and experiencing the various situations of the time was like watching a live performance.\n\nMiyamura: I wonder what kind of ending the fans were expecting.\n\nAM: I think you were confident that you could create the ending that everyone was expecting.\n\nAnno: I don't know, but I was able to create an ending that people would enjoy. It was impossible, though.\n\nAM: For example, what was the Human Instrumentality Project all about?For example, what was the Human Instrumentality Project, and what was the final goal of Gendo Ikari?At the end, you want to have a sense of satisfaction when you understand it all.\n\nMiyamura: Is that going to be resolved in the new video version?\n\nAnno: I don't know what's going to happen yet. I'll think about it from now on.\n\nMiyamura: There's a graph that shows the stress levels of people all over Japan, and the stress gauge of people who watched the last episode of Evangelion went through the roof.\n\nAM: How was your own stress gauge, Miyamura?\n\nMiyamura: I gained five kilos because I couldn't take the stress with me...\n\nAnno: It's called bulimia, isn't it?\n\nMiyamura: I became bulimic.\n\nAM: You look so skinny on screen.\n\nAnno: I wonder if I should fatten her up for the retakes of episode 24.\n\nMiyamura: You left me to fatten up a bit. But as an actor, I was deeply involved, so I was really shaken up by the work of 'Evangelion'. I think that's why I started to overeat after the show. My heart was shaken so badly. What are you going to do about it, director?\n\nAnno: It's like Heart of Darkness, that's cool. (He's already looking at the alcohol.)\n\nIn the beginning, Asuka's personality was straight as a bamboo shoot, and she appeared on the scene in a cheerful manner. Then, from a certain point, she started to dig deeper and deeper into her heart.\n\nMiyamura: Yes, she dug in. She was fragile.\n\nAnno: She was fragile, wasn't she? I wonder why. I didn't intend to go that far in the beginning.\n\nMiyamura: I see. I wonder why it turned out that way.\n\nAnno: I don't know. Didn't it just happen? (laughs).\n\nAM: I thought her exhilarating personality in the first half was a foreshadowing for her depressing moments in the second half.\n\nAnno: No, that wasn't my intention at all. We had been doing a lot of depressing stuff up until episode 6, and the staff was getting tired, so we decided to do something cheerful. Of course, I didn't think of foreshadowing, though it would be cool to say that I did. Well, whatever. I'm getting tired of theorizing (laughs). But to be honest, I didn't completely grasp the character of Asuka at first. Then, when I came up with the line, \"You idiot,\" the character was born. “Chance\" and \"You idiot\" are two great lines.\n\nMiyamura: That's a good line.\n\nAnno: A man who wants to be spoiled by a woman will definitely like this line. I'm sure it feels good. If a woman says, \"You're an idiot,\" in a gentle way, men will be melted just by that.\n\nAM: Isn't that what director Anno is like?\n\nAnno: I definitely do.\n\nAM: \"Do you understand this feeling, Miyamura?\n\nMiyamura: I'm a woman, so I don't know. I'd rather prefer to have an inorganic girl like Rei on my bed than Asuka.\n\nAM: At your mercy?\n\nMiyamura: Exactly. Rei doesn't seem to say anything even after it's over, does she?\n\nAM: What do you mean 'after it's over'? (laughs).\n\nMiyamura: Asuka seems so annoying when you push her down on the bed.\n\nAnno: She seems to order a lot of things...\n\nMiyamura: That's true. She'd say things like, \"Stop it!\" or \"It hurts!\"\n\nAnno: She's going to say, 'You're terrible at this' at the end.\n\nMiyamura: 'Am I?' (laughs).\n\nAM: (Somewhat stunned) I wonder if Yuko Miyamura is a man.\n\nMiyamura: I'm talking about if I were a man.\n\nAnno: Rei seems to be less of a problem.\n\nAM: Rei is also the most popular, right?\n\nMiyamura: I wonder if everyone has that desire.\n\nAnno: I'm sure there is. People who are sadists will definitely go for Rei, because of their sadistic desires. Masochists would probably go for Asuka, though. And women of the same generation and those who are mentally children tend to go for Misato.\n\nMiyamura: But don't people have both?\n\nAnno: Yes, we have both. Basically, everyone has both. The only difference is which one is bigger. Even in the last episode, there are people who are happy with that, and there are people who are not happy with that. In short, humans are greedy and like both hot and cold weather. However, the reason why we think cold is better when it's hot is because our desire to be hot is satisfied, so we want to be cold at that time. And vice versa. So, no matter what kind of ending you make, people will complain. However, the last part is not what the majority of people want, but what I showed to a very small number of people, saying, \"This is what we need.\" I presented only the bare necessities.\n\nAM: When you say 'what we need', do you mean all the people who watch Evangelion?\n\nAnno: Anime fans. Small children might be a little off.\n\nAM: It's just that Evangelion seemed to involve a lot of ordinary people as it went on air. Although I had the impression that the majority of people were anime fans in the end.\n\nAnno: I think it's just that ordinary people became anime fans again.\n\nAM: Maybe so.\n\nAnno: There was a guy who said he had stopped being an anime fan, but then he came back. Those people are still fine. Anyway, I started to hate anime fans in the process. I hate the people who cling to their fake happiness. Television is the easiest form of entertainment. All you have to do is turn on the TV in the comfort of your own home, in the privacy of your own room, and you have nothing to do. With movies, you still have to pay for it, and you still have to go to the theater. Television is entertainment that you can watch in the comfort of your own room without making the least effort. You have the right to refuse to watch it. And yet, people get overly excited just by sitting around watching my programs without spilling any blood. From my point of view, they are fake, but they are clinging to their fake happiness. They think that the happiness they are clinging to is good, and they seek it more and more excessively, don't they? Happiness given to them by others. And then suddenly, in the end, it's not the end you wanted, and you get angry and hate only on this point. I wonder about that kind of thing. I knew that'd happen, but I wanted to do it.\n\nAM: But, Anno, you're an anime fan yourself, aren't you?\n\nAnno: So I'm giving myself half a rude awakening. Some people call this \"commercialism\" to sell new videos, but that's just a misunderstanding. There's no doubt that I'm going to feel bad about this (choosing this last part).In fact, I'm going through a lot of unpleasant feelings right now. When I enter the classroom in the morning, there are harsh complaints about me written all over the blackboard, and in addition, there are harassments on and in my desk. Well, I was prepared for that to a certain extent, and it's like I gave rude awakening half to myself and half to the audience watching TV!\n\nAM: I'm not sure why you feel the need to give rude awakening to anime fans.\n\nAnno: I didn't want them to be too dependent on it.\n\nMiyamura: I understand the director's feeling. You can say, \"I gave them a rude awakening,\" because you're the director, but you shouldn't have done that (laughs).\n\nAnno: Up until now, everyone (the creators) wanted to do it, but they couldn't.\n\nMiyamura: Because, to make something and have it received by everyone is.... I think that's the act of giving happiness, even if it's a fake happiness. So, director, please get it right in the video!\n\nAnno: Nope. (laugh)\n\nMiyamura: Expressing yourself, creating a stage, making a movie, writing a poem, whatever it may be, you are doing it because you want to convey something. When you want to feel happiness with others, it is also a created happiness, but you are creating it because you want to. So to now think that it's not good to be manipulated by the happiness they've been given is just wrong.\n\nAnno: I don't think so. From my point of view, I thought it would be better for them.\n\nMiyamura: There will come a time when some people will realize that the happiness they have been given is a fake, and those who don't will never come. Isn't that enough?\n\nAnno: For now, I've only given them one chance. It's probably the first and last time I'll be able to do something like this. \"I was able to do this because it was the right time.\"\n\nReturn to Reality\n\nAnno: I think the basis of \"Evangelion\" was to do it as if it were a live performance, without betraying my current feelings. As long as my feelings go that way, I won't betray them. At the very least, all I have to do is not betray myself. However, if I don't continue with this work, I will be betraying the staff (who have worked with me on this work). I asked the crew to make the last part of the TV show as a way of asking them to forgive me for doing another remake on video.\n\nAM: If you had had plenty of money at this time, and could have extended the show for three weeks or so to make up for the time lost, would the ending have been different?\n\nAnno: The methodologies are different, but what I was saying was probably the same. The theme is the same. I think it came down to \"return to reality\". I really didn't want animation, or at least the \"Evangelion\" that I've been working on, to become just a \"refuge\". It was just a place to escape from reality, and by being completely involved in it, they were only escaping the pain of reality, and there was nothing to return to reality from. There was nothing to return to reality from there. More and more people are escaping, and if things continue as they are, in the extreme, it will become a religion. It will be like Aum believers and Shoko Asahara. I think I had the potential to become the guru of a new religion if I did well here, but I didn't want to do that. I thought that I alone was enough to hang on to the spider's thread. (*2)\".\n\n(*2) The Spider's Thread: A short story by Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1918). The story is about a villainous hero who ascends to heaven by hanging on to a spider's thread that Shaka lowered from heaven, but falls into hell again because of his selfishness.\n\nMiyamura: This is the kind of story that says, \"Don't come here, you guys.\"\n\nAM:Do you understand that feeling?\n\nMiyamura: I do. There are people who are incredibly dependent on others, not just anime fans. It's hard to believe sometimes. For example, people who write their problems in their fan letters. Of course, if they write their problems in their fan letters and it makes them feel better, that's fine. But if the person says, \"I write so many problems in my letter to you, why don't you answer me?\" I think that person is looking for something a little different. They don't realize the mistake. I think that's because your vision has become narrow. You can't get rid of that unless you do it yourself. That's why I really understand what the director meant by \"rude awakening\". But of course there are other ways. Since I became an artist, I think that positive things (expressions and works) can definitely involve the people who receive them and make them positive. So, I believe that if you can feel it even once, you can definitely get that perspective (from the recipient).\n\nAnno: I guess I was too straightforward. There's nothing wrong with what we did. As for the methodology, I think I could have done something different if I had had a little more time. It would have been nice to just teach the reality that there is no such thing as a kind of (manufactured) pleasure that lasts forever. The world can betray you.\n\nAM: But Anno-san seems to be an anime fan.\n\nAnno: Of course, that's because I don't like myself. That (disliking anime fans) is what I'm saying to myself, too. I think the pain is the same.\n\nMiyamura: I've heard that people who hate themselves hurt others.\n\nAnno: I think so, too. I've hurt a lot of people.\n\nMiyamura: I think so, too. I hate myself, too, so ahahaha.\n\nAM: \"People who don't like themselves hurt other people.\" That's a line that's in there somewhere.\n\nAnno: I barely know how much I can hurt (others), so I know the right distance between myself and them. That's about it. I can recognize when I'm hurting someone. I think that's much better than being unaware of it. Unawareness is the scariest thing. Like, 'Oh, I'm hurting you. But I can't do anything about it anymore.' That's why I thought episodes 25 and 26 would hurt the viewers a lot, but that's okay too. I'd rather they get hurt. If the story ends without anyone getting hurt, I think the only thing that would come would be praise, and the only response would be one-sided praise like \"I was so moved.\" That would probably make me feel good when people said that, but I also felt really bad about the pre-established harmony of the ending.\n\nI also thought it would be a good topic (laughs). If I wanted to make it more commercially profitable, I could have dropped episodes 25 and 26 since I didn't have the time to do so, and made up the broadcast time with a video compilation and apologized. If we had done that, the number of people who would have been upset would have been small, we would have gotten a lot of sympathy votes, and we could have said, \"We're sorry we didn't have time.\" I'm sure I'll get letters from people saying, \"I'm sorry you didn't have more time, but please show us the rest of the movie on video or whatever.\" It's much better from a commercial point of view, because you get the sympathy of the customers and they buy the rest of the story. However, in episodes 25 and 26, I wanted to throw away all commercial thoughts and put my honest feelings on the screen. It was a last-minute choice, though.\n\nAM: But what about those 25 or 26 episodes that were made that way? It wasn't just about hurting people, was it?\n\nMiyamura: I think so, because the director had a lot to say in episodes 25 and 26.\n\nAnno: Was there anything? (laughs) (He's already drunk.)\n\nMiyamura: I thought that way. Episode 25 is all about what the director wanted to say. I think that's how it turned out when you made an animation of what you wanted to say in that situation. Wasn't that what the director wanted to say?\n\nAnno: I think that's what I wanted to say, but what did I say? (laughs). I've forgotten what I said. But I'm OK with it because a woman I know, who's over 30, cried when she saw episode 25. She said she remembered it from her life. I'm okay with that.\n\nAM: That's the part about Misato, isn't it?\n\nAnno: The part about Misato, she remembered something about it. When a certain kind of woman sees that, it must make her feel very uncomfortable. Just the fact that she felt that way was OK with me. At least, as far as I know, there are two of them. Two people is enough. I'm sure there are more, though.\n\nAM: I wonder what it means to be able to cry. A kind of release?\n\nAnno: No, I think she felt bad.\n\nAM: I think so, too. That's what she meant.\n\nAnno: The purpose of episode 25 was to make the viewer feel so bad that he or she would puke, but I wasn't able to do that. I couldn't do a good job of replacing reality instead of copying it.\n\nIt was a failure, episode 1\n\nAM: What's the difference between fans who are OK with it and fans who are not OK with it in episode 25 and 26?\n\nAnno: It's the way they cling to it...\n\nAM: Is it wrong to live by clinging?\n\nAnno: I think it's better than dying.\n\nAM: But the fact that it's just an animation on TV is shameful, yes?\n\nAnno: The fact that it is being used as a refuge is shameful. It's a negative thing that it's only a place to escape to. I guess I had a desire to change that into something positive. I may have used the wrong method, but I'm not lying about my feelings.\n\nAM: That's, for example, the most memorable line in the first episode, 'Don't run away.\" That mood dominated the first episode, and I think it dominated the impression of \"Evangelion\", in my opinion.\n\nAnno: It's an obsession itself. Even if I try not to think about it, it pops up in my head, and I made it because I was caught up in an idea that I couldn't get rid of by my own will, so impatience and things like that appear on the screen. That's especially true for the first episode. The first episode was a failure.\n\nAM: Because the obsession came out too much?\n\nAnno: That's part of it, but I put in so many things that I think the first episode was three minutes too long when I was cutting it. Anyway, I realized it perfectly during the post recording. Big mistake. After that, I was in a hurry. I wanted to die when I saw the rushes (preview).\n\nAM: When I watched the first episode, there were many scenes where the way each word was chosen and the way it was chosen were so close to each other that if a redundant line came here, the world would collapse at once. For example, you never let Gendo speak any more than he has to. I'm really impressed with the choices you made.\n\nAnno: It's no good at all. Also, overwhelmingly, it didn't beat Gundam (First) in my mind. Unfortunately, it couldn't beat the first episode of Gundam.\n\nAM: I felt that you were trying very hard, very carefully.\n\nAnno: To put it another way, I spent a lot of time on it, and this is what I got. Anyway, I couldn't do it well on my own part. The pictures and other things were already fine. My part, the script, the structure, and other parts were a disaster. I couldn't help but feel sorry for them. I didn't want the staff to feel this way again. That's all.\n\nAM: From that moment on, \"Eva\" became a live show.\n\nAnno: From the beginning, I wanted to do it like a live show. Until then, I thought I'd take it more easy, because it was television. Then, I couldn't take it easy anymore. I realized that I couldn't let the staff feel this way again. I completely reworked the second episode in the middle. (Turning to Miyamura) It was all a mess, wasn't it?\n\nThere were a lot of cuts, lines were replaced, and there was a lot of fuss, wasn't there? After the post recording script was finished, we changed a lot of things, including the lines. The structure was kept the same, but the details and dialogues were changed, and the cuts were increased. But it still didn't work. I thought, \"This isn't going to be interesting.\" Until I saw the first rush (preview), I didn't know what I wanted to make. I thought the script was not good enough, but I was so naive that I thought I could make it work. I thought the script was not good enough, but I did it with a naive feeling that I could make it work. Then, I couldn't make anything of the first episode. It was a huge failure.\n\nAM: You tried to make up for it in episode 2. At what point did it seem to get back on track?\n\nAnno: Well, when we finished the second episode, it was already OK during the recording. The dubbing was almost perfect.\n\nAM: There are a lot of feedback scenes in episode 2, aren't there?\n\nAnno: Episode1 and Episode 2 are one story. It was tough. The other episodes were all tough, but episodes 1 and 2 were the toughest.\n\nAsuka's German\n\nAM: When you played Asuka, you had to speak German.\n\nMiyamura: Yes, I did. When I was chosen for the role of Asuka, the director, Anno, who I didn't even know at the time, told me that there was a scene where I had to speak German, so I had to practice. So I decided to go to a language school, and I learned German. I thought I would be able to use German in my daily conversation, but the German that came up in episode 8 was a military term. When I asked my native teacher about military terms, he said he didn't understand it (laughs).\n\nAnno: So I felt bad for Miyamura, so I added some German dialogue to the second half of the story.\n\nMiyamura: Then he asked me to improvise.\n\nAnno: Only the last greeting and the first line of the mother's speech were decided, and the rest was ad-libbed, so I was told to fill in the lines herself.\n\nMiyamura: Since I was having such a hard time, the director asked me to ask someone who knew German to do it, but I said, \"Since I've practiced so hard, I'm okay with it.\" I worked very hard on it, asked for the length of the lines, timed it myself, and thought it was OK. But I put in so many things that it didn't sound like a phone conversation, so it had to be cut a lot (laughs).\n\nAnno: So I had to add a little more space for the dialogue afterwards. That's Miyamura. I'm impressed.\n\nMiyamura: Yes! Please write the conversation here in the magazine properly (laughs).\n\nAnno: Asuka is a good character. I hadn't planned to put so much thought into her. The actor's feedback is very important in character creation, so Miyamura may have influenced the way Asuka turned out.\n\nAM: She became thin and slender like an anorexic.\n\nAnno: I heard that she actually gained weight, so I had to redo it. I'll have to fatten her up for the video version.\n\nMiyamura: She's not in the muddy water, she's at the convenience store buying stuff.\n\nAnno: Yeah, I didn't expect her to get so fat. I was not observant enough. I'm sorry.\n\nMiyamura: You go that far?\n\nAnimation is not just about cels.\n\nAnno: Another reason why I made the last episode like that was to free the celluloid animation. I didn't want to have a bunch of crazy anime fans thinking that if it's not cel, it's not anime.\n\nAM: Anno-san himself was honed in the fields of independent production, special effects, and animation. You had experience in cine calligraphy, drawing directly on film, and paper animation.\n\nAnno: I wanted to include cine calligraphy in episode 26, but there was no room.\n\nAM: It's the same with the so-called \"line-dori\" (*3) style expression in episode 16.\n\n3) A kind of dummy material or timing shot in the animation production process when the original material is not ready in time for editing, post recording, or sound work. It is also called \"Shirosatsu\".\n\nAnno: I started with the idea of what it would be like to take a symbol called a word and turn it into a minimal image. It's an expression of the primitive word in my mind. As I make my living from animation, I thought it was an expression of the pure image of words. This is the only way I can make a documentary about myself. If you see that and think it's lazy, then I think you're done. You've been poisoned by commercial celluloid animation.\n\nAM: Even if you notice that's a line-dori method, it should be easy to understand why they did it, if you look at it with normal senses.\n\nAnno: Normal people called it a \"surrealistic expression\". Know-it-all people would say something boring like, \"No, that's just animation with a line-dori, it's just a lazy thing,\" or \"They couldn't get the drawing done in time.\"\n\nAM: I'm sure it's easier to talk about it that way. Isn't it surprisingly difficult to look at a work of art and try to express what you think of it, or try to read something from it yourself? In other words, it would be easy to just say, \"Oh, that was fun,\" or \"The pictures were terrible today. I think there is a perspective that says what's wrong with being easy, because it's entertainment. But the truth is, if you look at it properly, you should be able to tell what happened at that point. But instead of going to that point, they just run away from it.\n\nMiyamura: Viewers are doing that?\n\nAM: Yes. I'm sure it would be a shock for those people to see the last episode. I think there were many keywords that led to the last episode. For example, why is episode 16 called \"Deathly Sickness\"? Do you know what episode 16 is? The one where Shinji is captured by the black sphere. It's hard to understand why it's a \"disease leading to death\". Why does it lead to death, when you're regenerating and living, when all you're doing is looking at your past?\n\nMiyamura: Because it makes you want to die, doesn't it?\n\nAnno: It's just pedantic (an act of showing off one's academic knowledge).\n\nAM: To put it simply...\n\nAnno: Pedantic (,which refers to words and actions that show off one's knowledge).\n\nMiyamura: It sounds a lot like Peking duck, doesn't it?\n\nAnno: Oh no, that's just as boring as it sounds.\n\nAM: I was shocked.\n\nAnno: Zero for Robocon!\n\n(He's perfectly drunk.)\n\nAM: It's getting pedantic (laughs). Miyamura, do you think it was good to work on Evangelion?\n\nMiyamura: I do.\n\nAM: Do you feel that something has changed in you?\n\nMiyamura Yes, I do.\n\nAnno: I, too, feel as if something has changed.\n\nAM: What has changed, that's .......\n\nMiyamura: God only knows what it is.\n\nAM: I see.\n\nAnno: I don't know how it's changed yet.\n\nMiyamura: I don't know if it's good or not.\n\nAnno: I don't know if it made me more positive or more negative. So I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but as a result, there's a lot of criticism and slander against me. It's not a good feeling to hear someone say bad things about you.\n\nAM: If you can feel good about it, you're crazy.\n\nAnno: But I wonder what it means to have started something in order to feel good about it, and then to have rejected it as a result. No matter what you make, when you decide to make it into a work of art, it can only be the director's masturbation. People who feel good by hurting themselves are the ones who create such works. How far can you go in commercial work without being noticed? When I came to my senses, I realized that all the staff were helping me masturbate. The director is the last dictator left in the age of democracy, just like Coppola. That's what Orson Welles said.\n\nThat's how it should have started, but it ended up with both sides in a lot of pain, and we didn't conclude it. I wonder what the reason was. I still don't have a clear answer as to why I did it. There are some reasons, but they are all different. It's not clear yet. I guess I hate myself because I'm so dependent. I never thought I'd be such a dependent man.\n\nAM\n\n.......\n\nAnno: I don't have a self. It's empty. This is especially true of my generation, but we have no self. The only common experience is television.\n\nAM: You're afraid that if you conclude with this, it might prove that.\n\nAnno: No, I don't think it's just about that either. It's more of a chaotic feeling. Also, I have a desire for destruction, I think. It's boring to have a clean ending.\n\nMiyamura: You want to destroy things.\n\nAnno: I've been doing this for a long time. I make clay, toys, plastic models, whatever, realistically, complete them, and then set them on fire and burn them.\n\nMiyamura: That kind of momentary thing is wrong, but so am I. (laughs)\n\nAnno: When I was in junior high school, it took me about a month to make a mock-up model of an airplane that would actually fly, and it was really beautiful when I lit it on fire and watched it fly. When it went into someone's house and almost caught fire, I panicked (laughs).\n\nAM: Didn't it catch on fire this time?\n\nAnno: Well, I guess so. I guess I just went to someone's house and got burned. I don't like things that are beautifully finished. It always has to be broken somehow. When I was a kid, I used to draw doodles in my notebook. I used to write \"Getter Robo\" or something like that, but after I drew it neatly, I would make sure to erase it with an eraser and rip off the arms and legs to make a picture of a pipe or something coming out of the inside.\n\nAnd yet, I didn't do what everyone else did when I was a kid, such as wrenching the legs of frogs or making them hold firecrackers in their mouths and popping them. I didn't deny what my friends did. I watched them do it, but I never did anything like that myself. Instead, I always destroyed inorganic things. So, for me, animation is inorganic. So I think that's why I destroyed it. Well, I do have the urge to destroy. I guess I didn't want it to end nicely.\n\nAM: You call animation inorganic, but there are people who have been involved in it, including Miyamura, and people who have watched it. You chopped it up.......\n\nAnno: Miyamura, I chopped off after 24 episodes.\n\nMiyamura: Ah, it was cut off and left there.\n\nAM: It's especially bad for Miyamura-san. What will finally happen to Asuka? Is she going to be saved or is there going to be a new Asuka? But in the end, she just stayed in bed.\n\nMiyamura: She was still asleep. The director cut me in half! That's right!\n\nAnno: I guess I didn't love the character enough.\n\nMiyamura: But I hope something happens in the video.\n\nAnno: If you say so, Miyamura. I'm weak with women. I'm the type of person who is spoiled by women.\n\nAM: You're weak with women.\n\nAnno: I'm nothing. I'm totally weak. I realized it clearly this time. I didn't know I had nothing like this.\n\nAM: Inside yourself?\n\nAnno: In myself. I'm too dependent on anime. The words in episode 26 are all words that come back to me.\n\nAM: Before starting Evangelion, Anno-san said that you wanted to make a film based on the idea that you had to make as many otaku as possible.\n\nMiyamura: I didn't know he said that.\n\nAnno: I think the otaku industry is going to get worse and worse, because it's just going to get blocked. Nowadays, there are no more TV anime for otaku, and everyone is using video as their primary source of entertainment. Video is something that you have to pay a certain amount of money to watch, so there will never be an unspecified number of people buying it, because only those who want to watch it will buy it.\n\nAt that point, there will be no reason to buy the video other than \"I'll buy it because Yuko Miyamura is in the voice.\" Because everyone is making the same thing inside. When that happens, people who are not fans of Miyamura Yuuko will watch the anime. If that were to happen, the business of dealing with only a few thousand people would become a viable one, and that would be fine for a day-to-day living. But it will never be more than that, and it will never be less than that. It's just that that world is getting blocked.\n\nMiyamura: I see. Making anime is anime fans. Becoming a voice actor is also an anime fan. Anime fans of anime fans.\n\nAnno: The only way to make anime is for anime fans, by anime fans, and for anime fans. In this process, they become smaller and smaller. The only way to cope with this situation is to increase the number of people who buy our products, even if it is just one person, from an unspecified number. Even people who think they are ordinary people always have otaku elements, so we have to stimulate them and increase the number of people.\n\nMiyamura: It was a success, wasn't it?\n\nAnno: Yes, it was successful, but I started to hate it more than that, didn't I? I hated myself.\n\nAM: It's not 100 million otaku-ization, but I think Evangelion is succeeding in its plan to make otaku more popular, at least until episode 24.\n\nAnno: You don't know about episodes 25 and 26.\n\nAM: I'd like to hear about the change of heart in those episodes the most.\n\nAnno: I don't know what to say. I didn't have much time at all, I was so tired.\n\nMiyamura: You were tired?\n\nAM: In the beginning, you create otaku and lock them in a locked room. I wondered what it was like when that became unacceptable.\n\nAnno :I guess I started to hate otaku. Also I hated myself.\n\nAM: If you hate yourself, then you can't depend on yourself. It's not that \"I don't\", it's that \"I can't\".\n\nAnno: I myself am dependent on animation. I haven't come up with my own ideas yet.\n\nAM: Is this the flip side of your dependence on animation?\n\nAnno: But I think that's okay, too. The final episode of a video or a TV program may be completely different, and the final episode of a theater may also be different. In the case of theaters, I think it's OK to be dependent. I don't know…\n\nMiyamura: Dependency, huh?\n\nAnno: It can't be helped, though, can it?\n\nMiyamura: Admitting it is also .......\n\nAnno: You have to honestly admit what you have. You can't do anything about what you can't do.\n\nAM: I'm not going to try to summarize this discussion in a very harmonious way. We haven't finished \"Evangelion\" yet, we have the video, and you have to keep working on it. We can't come to a conclusion about \"Evangelion\" here. Was there anything left to say, Miyamura? You did say to the director, \"Please do something about Asuka, who is being neglected.\"\n\nMiyamura: I'm sure he'll do something about it in the video!\n\nAnno: Don't get your hopes up.\n\nAM: Thank you very much.\n\nHideaki Anno: The World of Neon Genesis Evangelion (SF Magazine 08/1996)\n\nTranslation: Riki\n\nSource: http://anime-room.jp/modules/evangelion/eva-doc/siryou4-1.htm#top\n\nThis is a reconstructed version based on a discussion between Hideaki Anno and Nozomi Omori(*1) at the SF Seminar '96 held on April 28th.\n\n1) A Japanese translator, book reviewer, critic, and anthologist who focuses on science fiction.\n\nOmori: I'd like to start with a topic about why we talk about anime in a science fiction seminar in the first place.\n\nPersonally, I have been advocating the \"New Real Science Fiction\" since last year. At the core of this new Sci-Fi is\n\n\"The Devil in Soliton\" by Katsufumi Umehara\n\n\"Hyperion\" and \"The Fall of Hyperion\" by Dan Simmons\n\n\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\"\n\nOf those works, Eva is the most representative of Japanese Sci-Fi today, and at the same time, it can be said to be at the forefront of modern Sci-Fi. If you talk about science fiction today, I think it's indispensable. But Anno-san probably doesn't think so.\n\nAnno: Nope.\n\nOmori: You don't. You don't have to agree with me at all (laughs), it's up to the viewer. Sci-Fi geek have their own way of watching Evangelion. So I'd like to analyze here a different view of Evangelion than the way anime geek sees it.\n\nAnno: Thanks. By the way, I'm at a loss, probably here's not the right place for me.\n\nOmori: I heard that you joined the SF convention at Hammacon(*2).\n\n2) Japan SF Convention held in Yokohama\n\nAnno: So far, that was the last one.\n\nOmori: I was surprised to hear in the waiting room earlier that there's an episode called \"Magma Diver,\" and that title is actually based on David Prynne's \"Sundiver\" (laughs).\n\nAnno: Yes, it was taken from \"Sundiver\", but no one noticed. I haven't read it. I just read the cover blurb and thought it was cool. When you dive into the sun, there's something there. That's cool. I haven't read it though.\n\nOmori: That's keen. If you have that sense, you can live well as a Sci-Fi geek (laughs). Now I'd like to survey the audience here.\n\nWho in the audience is unfortunate enough to live in an unfortunate living/economic environment to have never seen a single episode of \"Evangelion\"? Please raise your hand.\n\nOh, that's not much, about 20%. Then, please raise your hand if you bought all three LDs?\n\nAnno: Seriously? That's not as bad as I thought.\n\nOmori: There are about the same number of people with a 0% synchronization rate and those with a 100%+ synchronization rate (laughs). That's an ideal distribution.\n\nThere may be some people who have never heard of it, so I'd like the director to explain it in a few words. What kind of anime is \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\"?\n\nAnno: Oh well, I don't know.\n\nOmori: In a nutshell, it's like a robot animation?\n\nAnno: Hmmm, there's a robot in it. I can call it a robot animation, maybe.\n\nOmori: For example, what if one of your relatives asked you \"Shu-chan, what kind of animation have you been making lately? or something like that.\n\nAnno: Well, I'd answer I'm making a robot animation (laughs).\n\nOmori: What if they ask \"Like in Mazinger Z?\"\n\nAnno: If they ask that, I'll tell them that it's like 'Gundam'. Gundam is famous, so if I say so, they'll understand.\n\nOmori: A robot anime like Gundam?\n\nAnno: Hmmm, well, it's quicker. It's easier to understand.\n\nOmori: Gundam, in terms of Sci-Fi history, was an anime that achieved a certain degree of Sci-Fi realism, not the promised space combat of TV anime. From the space colony setting to the Minovsky particle that brought about the need for melee combat. Back in the day, robots didn't need any logic to fight.\n\nAnno: So they've brought something like that to the table, and they've succeeded.\n\nOmori: Yes, properly reasoned, and that's what made Sci-Fi geek love it.\n\nAnno: Also, throwing away the word \"robot\" was a big deal. No matter how you look at it, it's a robot, but it's a mobile suit. It's so cool, isn't it?\n\nOmori: Earlier, in a conversation with Omiya Nobumitsu(*3), Okada Toshio talked about it, didn't he? No matter how you look at it, it's just an ordinary building, but the AUM truth teach calls it \"Satyam\" (laughs). They said, \"This is similar to Gundam, isn't it?\"\n\n3) He was the chairman of the executive committee of the Japanese SF convention \"TOKON8\" in 1982.\n\nAnno: Yes, I think the way you use words is important. That's because it's a semiotic theory. I think so, too.\n\nOmori: That's why it's called a humanoid battle weapon. And in the case of Eva, the kanji characters have a big impact.\n\nAnno: It sure does. I'm not good at kanji, but it looks cool. It's good now we have a word processor. My rough drafts are all in hiragana. I don't know kanji very much.\n\nOmori: It is groundbreaking in the sense that they used kanji with attention to typographic matters. For example, the way you put the chyron.\n\nAnno: I was aiming for the coolness of the thing.\n\nOmori: I think that's one of the reasons why it's so popular. Even in modern science fiction, the measure of \"coolness\" is becoming very important. It's because cyberspace and cybernetic space were so cool that William Gibson was so popular.\n\nAnno: Yes, that's cool.\n\nOmori: But if you think about not only the naming but also the framework of science fiction, the point is the fact that Eva is presenting a big theme, a big story about God and humanity. In the Japanese Sci-Fi of the 80's, there was a thought that the story should be no longer about a god or humanity. That you can't have reality in a big story like that. In the case of Eva, however, the vision of human evolution is clearly at the root of the story.\n\nAnno: I got inspired by Mitsuse Ryu(*4) when I started.\n\n4)Japanese Science Fiction Writers\n\nOmori: Oh, it was Mitsuse Ryu? Rather than Komatsu Sakyo(*5)?\n\n5) One of the leading science fiction writers in Japan, as well as one of the leading novelists of post-war Japan.\n\nAnno: Not Komatsu-san but Ryu Mitsuse for that time.\n\nOmori: He's famous for \"Ten Billion Days and a Hundred Billion Nights\"(*6).\n\n6) A science fiction novel by Ryu Mitsuse\n\nAnno: Yes he is. I read it again. Japanese Sci-Fi of that era was good, wasn't it? If I say so, it sounds terrible now, though. It's just that I rarely read.\n\nOmori: In that sense, Mitsuse Ryu's sense of naming is also quite-\n\nAnno: Good, right?\n\nOmori: Yes, it is. It also has challenges that seem to anticipate cyberpunk. However, Mitsuse's worl"
