        "text": "Plot: As the apocalypse surges, Akira struggles to maintain his resolve, and Cadney rears up for his final assault. Meanwhile, the demons plot to finally break Akira by taking away the one thing in this world that gives him hope.\n\nThe world’s crumbling.\n\nWill anyone be left standing?\n\nBreakdown: If you’ve already read the ending of the original Devilman series, there’s not really much to hold you to this volume. It is, by default, essentially the ending of the original manga just with a few more details and added scenes put in.\n\nThe biggest buildup so far has been Cadney, but since he had no role whatsoever in Devilman, we can assume his role here is nothing to write home about.\n\nAnd it’s not. It’s incredibly disappointing.\n\nWe learn that Cadney was present at the Black Sabbath party, but he was the only one, besides Ryou, to keep his humanity during the whole thing. He huddled up on the floor and believed him to be the only one to truly be a self-controlled devilman since even Akira was losing control back then. However, it’s revealed that Cadney’s demon side is really just fragments of Amon, somehow.\n\nHe starts to lose control of his demon powers and tries to assimilate with Amon. Manjirou, who had been assimilated last volume, suddenly pops up and sets Cadney on fire as his final act. That was a pretty nice twist for such a minor character.\n\nOh yeah, Cadney latches onto Amon later and reanimates Miki’s body to taunt him only to be decapitated a page later. Pretty pointless.\n\nAnother new scene we get is Akira fighting Amon, literally. They split off from each other and have an evenly matched fight. It’s pretty awesome, but really short lived because Ryou interrupts.\n\nFor anyone who has never read the original Devilman, I’d imagine this final chapter would be really weird. We gear up for a final showdown between Ryou/Satan and Akira/Amon, but then we cut away to the very start of the story when Ryou’s saving Akira from Dosuroku and his gang back when they were thugs. As he did then, he calls himself crazy and the story just ends. If I was reading this without having read Devilman, I’d be insanely confused, and I’d feel very ripped off.\n\nTo recap the ending of Devilman, there’s a massive battle between the demons, humans and devilmen, particularly Satan and Amon, where eventually everyone dies. Ryou/Satan and Akira/Amon are the only ones left, but we see that even Akira’s dead and Satan’s left all alone only to be destroyed when the angels of heaven come down to wipe out every living being left on earth, including the demons, and supposedly restore humanity.\n\nThey could’ve redone that, but I dunno. Maybe they felt it redundant?\n\nNothing else of real note happens that didn’t happen in the finale of Devilman.\n\nWhen all is said and done, the first half and second half of this entire series seems to be awkwardly stitched together. Some of the additions, due to the constraints of the original series, were just disappointing, particularly Cadney in his entirety. However, each story on their own, while sometimes being difficult to follow, particularly if you’ve never read the original manga (and sometimes if you have read it) is pretty good and adds a fair amount of development and interesting scenes that were missing from the original Devilman.\n\nThe art is both beautifully and grotesquely detailed, and there are many scenes that look much better than the original series ever did. It’s not as good as Devilman, but it’s a very solid entry in the franchise.\n\nRecommended Audience: There’s damn near everything outside of sex. There’s full-frontal nudity, though the genitals are never really drawn (nor are they covered usually, though) A lot of blood, gore, violence, and mature themes spread throughout the entire series. 16+\n\nIf you enjoy my work and would like to help support my blog, please consider donating at my Ko-Fi page. Thank you! ♥\n\nPlot: Returning to the Devilman timeline, Akira and the others struggle with trying to live in their post-apocalyptic society as more and more people are turning into devilmen. As the demon and devilman increase in numbers, so do the numbers of people killed by the ADSC. Many allies fall, and Akira starts to have difficulties discerning between himself and Devilman.\n\nBreakdown: It is so nice to be back in familiar territory. After four volumes of oddities and confusion, it’s a relief to finally have a good idea of what’s happening.\n\nThis volume returns us to the Devilman world we’re familiar with, but sticks us right in the part where the great war has already happened and humanity is starting to go extinct. I appreciate the volume starting at this point because this was one part of the manga I really wanted to see more of.\n\nTrouble is, there’s not much they’re building on so far. Some of Miki’s friends die, we get some nice moments with Dosuroku and his gang buddies, but they ultimately die too, and we get more insight into Akira and Ryo’s relationship.\n\nThey introduce a new character named Cadney who is the personal secretary to Kouzou Rainuma, head of demon issues at the Department of Defense. But we don’t learn a whole lot about him in regards to who or what he really is. All we know is that he is firm in the belief that the concept of ‘devilmen’ is merely an illusion and that he has strength and abilities that not only rival devilmen, but also rival Akira quite easily. He seems to either be a devilman or a complete demon.\n\nHe says their department aims to eradicate demons and help innocent people who became devilmen. His first appearance is attempting to ‘help’ Miko, who, sadly, doesn’t get much time in this volume.\n\nThis volume also introduces us to some ways humanity has adapted to this situation. For example, there are obviously people benefiting from the devilman and demon outbreaks by gaining wealth and power, but there are also aspects such as cage matches between devilmen that rich people put on for sport and betting.\n\nAkira is succumbing to an increasing feeling of bloodlust and is questioning who really has control over his body – him or Devilman/Amon. This is something they didn’t really address in Devilman as he always seemed to have a good degree over control over himself, even in the very end, so it’s an interesting aspect of his character to explore. It also seems to be the real reason behind why Ryo outs Akira over the news in Devilman, but that’s not made clear yet. All he keeps saying is that he wants to save him.\n\nMiki is, sadly, no better than she usually is. She gushes over Akira, tries to get all up in that hotness and is ultimately useless. She is the point of some contention between Ryou and Akira because, despite them having a near romantic moment in the heat of Akira losing his sanity, Miki is shown to be able to reverse Akira’s transformations by merely touching him, which makes Ryou jealous.\n\nBut at least we get some quality time with Dosuroku. I can’t remember the last time a mostly minor character has been so missed to me, but dammit I love me some Dosuroku.\n\nAll in all, this was a pretty great volume that I hope is leading into a fantastic finale. I have to wonder how this will end considering we already know the grand ending of Devilman. What else is left to show? What’s left to tell?\n\nRecommended Audience: Not better or worse than the other volumes. 15+\n\nIf you enjoy my work and would like to help support my blog, please consider donating at my Ko-Fi page. Thank you! ♥\n\nPlot: Satan has gone missing, and while Amon has saved many of the demons, he’s also not making himself known. A new greatly powerful demon named Asura arrives and offers the demons a chance to become as powerful as Amon. All they have to do is merge together over and over. Most of the demons are more than willing to go through with her plan and see her as leader, especially the demon who wishes for nothing more than be beautiful. However, Silene’s not giving into her claims. Asura has more going on behind the scenes than just a lush future filled with demon gods.\n\nBreakdown: Our first chapter title page is a butt shot. Starting out well, Amon.\n\nThis whole volume was just very uninteresting. It focuses mostly on Silene, Demiko (still given no name) and a new enemy named Asura, who seems like a half-human, half-demon crazy person who is trying to take over as leader of the demons since Satan mysteriously disappeared. She’s trying to convince all of the demons that they can be like Amon if they agree to merge together over and over. However, her true intentions are to use the demons in their merged state to find Satan and kill him for revenge on how her body looks and acts.\n\nAsura is two beings, Earth and Terra, merged into one. She used to be angel-like with beautiful white wings, but when Satan fucked up in the last volume, the two were merged into one crazy being with two personalities, a weird body and small black wings that couldn’t handle flight.\n\nIn the end, Demiko gets killed by Kaim who kills her after she tries to steal Silene’s wings for Asura, under a semi-brainwashed delusion that she could be made beautiful if she helped Asura.\n\nSilene’s part is almost entirely stagnant through this whole volume. She meanders and mopes, longing for her precious Satan to return. She’s not buying into Asura’s lies, especially in her statement that they can surpass Satan, but she mostly whines and mopes and cries out for Satan.\n\nThe very last chapter is where the only thing of interest happens, though it’s a bit confusing. We find out why there seem to be contradictions between Devilman and Amon. The events of Devilman did happen, but they’re also in the future. God, as punishment for the events of Devilman, apparently put Satan in a time loop so he’ll constantly be tormented by losing his love (Amon, or moreso Devilman, though I thought Akira was a bigger part of that) He’s destined for the events long passed, and he’s damned to start all over again when it’s over with no memory of what happened.\n\nIt’s still not entirely clear in some respects, but it’s an explanation at least.\n\nAmon’s role is mostly just to escort Silene to Satan as Asura goes to him with her new pile of merged demon goo to take him on, but she’s ironically defeated by the demons she gathered, granted powers or abilities by the sleeping Satan, who all turn into little Saiyaman angel things that range in size from a few inches to a few stories tall. The little ones stab her over and over with a bunch of tiny needles and they mutate her into some glob. She tries to assimilate with Silene, but gets stopped by Amon who’s again mostly just annoyed by everything around him. He rips off Silene’s wing as it’s trying to be merged with Asura and kills her.\n\nThen the weirdest part of the volume…No….weirdest part of the manga happens. A gravely wounded Silene rides on Kaim back to their nest and quickly becomes pregnant. She reveals that silene continue to grow larger and larger in preparation for childbirth. However, if a silene’s life is put in mortal danger before then, they can basically force asexual pregnancy and give birth to one child very quickly before they die. She does indeed give birth to a young child (not a baby) that Kaim names Silene and starts to raise.\n\nSo….does that mean the Silene/Silen we see in Devilman is actually this Silene?\n\nThe very end has some nice action, answers some questions and ends….interestingly, but it didn’t hold my attention very well through the read. It was either boring or confusing. I don’t know what the next volume holds, but hopefully it will at least make more sense and be more interesting.\n\nOh and fewer butt shots, yeah that would be nice. Seriously, what is with all of the lone panels with pure butt shots? What is the point, Mr. Nagai?\n\nRecommended Audience: Still lots of gross imagery, gore, and damn near full frontal nudity. 16+\n\nIf you enjoy my work and would like to help support my blog, please consider donating at my Ko-Fi page. Thank you! ♥\n\nPlot: Satan is missing, Silene is captured, and Amon is on a mission to find Satan and kill him. What is the true story behind the strange man who merged with Amon?\n\nBreakdown: Not gonna lie here, guys. I wasn’t feeling this volume very much.\n\nIt starts off in a very odd place, I suppose quite a bit of time after the events of volume two. Silene has been captured, off panel, by a bunch of demons who seem in awe of her beauty, especially an unnamed demon whose body looks strikingly similar to Miko’s. In fact, this demon, who I guess I’ll just refer to as Demiko (demon Miko – I’m so clever) since she’s not given a name, wants to do everything in her power to be as beautiful as Silene since the whole reason she looks the way that she does is because she was merged against her will.\n\nAmon telepathically frees Silene before the angels can purify them, at least I think that’s what’s going on. While Silene stays behind, Demiko runs off to a different dimension thing where she meets Amon.\n\nSilene, caught again, is about to be purified when the angels merge into one to reveal Satan. With Silene’s call, Amon arrives on site. “Satan” is actually an amalgamation of the demons, taking that form to trick Silene into accepting the merging and purification, but Amon saves her. She states that she called out for Satan, but Amon reveals that he was the only one who received her signal.\n\nAmon starts breaking down the world around them, claiming that he wants to take back the world and make it free again. As he proclaims his goal, he transforms into his full Amon devil form.\n\nSilene has an identity crisis, and is set straight by Amon, but she falters yet again when Satan returns with his army of demons to be with her and save the demon race. But just as she’s about to reunite with Satan, Amon rips one of her wings off.\n\nSilene, distraught, starts to battle Amon, only to have him stop her in mid-battle to show her that all of the demons and Satan were illusions created by her heart…because she can do that I guess. Silene’s injury was a fake as well. Silene asks Amon why he forsakes Satan so harshly and he says ‘I don’t know, I just don’t like the guy.’….Welp. That was some kind of motivational reveal.\n\nSatan shows up….again.\n\nOh wait, this time he’s totes for real, and he’s gearing up for some tasty backstory. IE, the only interesting part of the volume. We learn that Amon is the first demon god, but his power rivaled God’s so God sealed him away in that sphere. In an effort to ensure that no being like Amon ever existed again, God created the demons a second time…\n\n……Uh….Huh…..\n\nAir tight plan, there G-man. Seal Amon away, fine, but revive demons….for the sake of never having another Amon appear again? Hey, you never want to see another demon god? Don’t make one! Problem solved.\n\nDemons can’t make themselves, but they can be created, and God is one of few beings with such power. It makes zero sense to revive the demons for this purpose, especially since all demons have the ability to merge with one another making themselves immensely more powerful. Hell, the demons all melding together now and in Devilman keep causing the world to end. Also, this ability is what allowed the man to merge with Amon to begin with, allowing Amon to return to the world. Your plan has more holes in it than the Guinness world record holder for most body piercings.\n\nBut that’s not all.\n\nWe also learn who the odd man born to the silenes really is. God felt threatened when Satan went to earth so he ripped some of Satan’s power from him. However, it wasn’t destroyed.\n\nIt was instead made into another living being – that which being the silene man. In essence, the man is Satan’s shadow. I don’t have as much of a problem with this, though I am confused beyond all reason as to why God didn’t destroy this power. Why turn it into a silene-like creature when Satan could realize what he is and find him in the future? God created Satan, he should be able to completely destroy at least some of his power.\n\nAmon punches him in frustration, showing the power that the two of them have when they’re combined as they’re instantly transported into a negative void-like world for a bit. Satan states that he hates God’s world since it’s filled with peace and tranquility, so he wants to fill the world with pain and misery. He wants to experience the fullness of life with all of his power, so he calls Amon back to him. Amon won’t go quietly, though, and stabs him in the forehead with his tail, causing mass destruction around them.\n\nWhen the dust settles, Amon asks if his true intention is to rule the world as king of the demons, but Satan implies that he’ll kill all demons due to them taking life for granted. Satan sheds his wings and says he forsakes God entirely and wishes to cling to the earth he fell to. This pisses Amon off and they start wrastlin’. Satan claims that the power Amon shows just proves that he’s no demon, but Amon says he doesn’t care because he is himself and that’s all that matters. At this revelation, we get this page.\n\nWhat the hell is this? I was under the impression that these two volumes were prequels, but they’re sequels? How? I thought Satan died. Did he get a reboot? Is this one of those ‘didn’t show it, so don’t blame us for what you believe from implications’ moments? Once God had Satan where he wanted him, he really let him go back to the way he was before and go doing the same crap all over again? Why? I don’t understand this at all. Did I miss something between volumes one and two? Is that a memory or a vision? I might be more understanding if it’s a vision, but it really seems like it’s a memory.\n\nWhispering Akira’s name, Satan falls. Amon leaves and Silene flies away with Satan, end volume.\n\nMost of this volume was stuff that I cared little about or was just completely pointless. Hell, Demiko didn’t even do anything. She never even got a name. She’s just kinda there to fill in spectator dialogue. She might be Silen, the first bad guy that Devilman fought, but I assumed that she was…..Silene….wait, I’m even more confused now. Kaim, Silen’s lover/friend from Devilman, is also there. I didn’t mention him because he doesn’t matter outside of kinda mirroring the scene he shared with Silen in Devilman.\n\nIt takes until the final two chapters for anything interesting to happen, and all of it is confusing as sin (pun not intended) or seemingly stupid. Maybe I am missing something. Maybe all of this will make more sense in the next volume, but I just left this feeling confused and unsatisfied, bordering on bored.\n\nRecommended Audience: I believe the groin area is getting less censored now. Nothing horribly graphic, but you can now see full outlines of genitals instead of shadows all the time. Other than that, same as the other volumes. 16+\n\nIf you enjoy my work and would like to help support my blog, please consider donating at my Ko-Fi page. Thank you! ♥\n\nPlot: Akira and Ryou are suddenly thrust through various points in time where they’re tasked with defeating a demon in each time period that is set on ruining the timelines.\n\nBreakdown: It’s a Devilman/Doctor Who crossover! 😀\n\n……………………..No, it’s not. *sigh* I can dream.\n\nThis is a series of kinda short stories in that they are indeed separate stories but there’s the main theme and characters of Devilman/Akira and Ryou keeping them all together, and they’re still technically part of the canon in the Devilman series.\n\nThis…is kinda an odd duck. I never expected Devilman to be in this type of manga, yet here we are. Devilman and Ryou traveling through time fighting timestream hating demons. There are five stories in all spanning across numerous time periods and locations, so let’s just plow through them all real quick.\n\nStory 1: Late Spring in Vienna – So, believe it or not, the first story is actually the oddest of the bunch. The first chapter involves them going to pre-war Vienna where they detect the faint scent of a demon around an artist and his distributor. For those who are already making internal connections here, yes, it is what you’re thinking, but oh it is a lot crazier than that.\n\nThe distributor shows a sold painting of a woman that the artist fell in love with but lost her to an army captain. Despite the distributor being very much money hungry, the artist cares more about putting tender care and detail into his paintings.\n\nAkira and Ryou decide to leave, resigned to the fact that a demon’s not around. They later follow the artist and the distributor to a huge house where the scent of demons gets stronger. The painting from before is being sold to the head of this house, despite the artist’s desire to keep it. His distributor, however, will have none of that and hands it over.\n\nThe head of the house accidentally gives them too much money, and while the distributor is more than happy to keep the extra, the artist finds it to be a mistake and runs back to return the money. As he enters the house, he sees the man, Schultz, slashing at the picture in front of his long lost lover.\n\nSchultz states that her husband died on the battlefield and that she’s now his somehow. He relishes in the supposed fact that the artist has given up on her entirely, the proof being that he sold the painting of her.\n\nHe bursts into the room in an outrage and finds that Schultz is actually a fire demon, who promptly burns up his love, Stephanie. Devilman rushes into the scene and destroys the demon. The artist watches on as the house burns to the ground. As his distributor, Mr. Harnisch, runs to ensure that he’s alright, the artist yells at him to stay away and says that he hates all of ‘his kind’ and that he’ll dedicate his life to eradicating all of the Jews….\n\nFor all of you playing along at home, the correct answer is: Adolf Hitler.\n\nYup, the artist in this story is Adolf Hitler, and while he had already shown a disliking of Jewish people before this whole thing happened, the story makes it out like the main reason behind the mass genocide of Jewish people was that his first love was killed by a Jewish fire demon. A Jewish fire demon…..a Jewish fire demon. Oh manga. The things you make me type.\n\nI just have all sorts of questions right now. Let’s start with the main plot of this whole side story. Why time travel of all things? Time travel is so touchy of a plot thread since it just causes so many plot holes and continuity errors that it’s a nightmare to deal with. This story in itself is causing plot holes.\n\nSo does that mean, since Devilman saved Hitler, that leaving him there would’ve killed Hitler and kept the holocaust from happening? Did Devilman just inadvertently cause the holocaust? Did Devilman really have any impact on the events of that day since the time that they were in at the start seemed to have experienced WWII?\n\nAlso, it’s not like it’s some surprise as to who it is either. Unlike what I did here, the manga gives the artist’s name right at the start, though they don’t divulge that his last name is Hitler until the very end. Gee, an artist in pre-war Vienna who dislikes Jewish people and has the first name of Adolf. Golly gee, who could he really be?\n\nStory 2: Jeanne D’arc in Hell – Next chapter, we learn that Ryou, unknowingly utilizing his satanic powers, is the one making them travel through time in order to, I suppose, combat time traveling demons that are trying to mess up history.\n\nThis time, Devilman goes to France where Jeanne D’arc is trying to end the Hundred Years War. Demons decide to kidnap her from the battlefield and bring her to hell where she’s put on trial for her sins. The sins in question being trying to end war, which the demons find to be beneficial to humanity in regards to progress, and hearing voices, which they claim are really demonic and not heavenly.\n\nShe’s saved by Devilman and continues her quest, though the chapter ends on a rather somber note as it reminds us that shortly after this event she was arrested and put on trial for being a witch (though, technically, the charges were heresy and repeated instances of cross-dressing.) She was found guilty and burned at the stake.\n\nWould’ve been a little better to also add that there was a retrial later which not only found her innocent, but found that the previous trial was not conducted justly and the person who convicted her was implicated with heresy for his biased view on the trial. But then again this is Devilman, wouldn’t want to have any happy-ish endings.\n\nStory 3: The Beautiful Goddess of War, Nike of Samothrace – The next chapter is a bit intriguing. The goddess of victory, Nike, is giving modern weapons to an army in ancient Samothrace, allowing them to easily take down their enemies in hopes of taking over Greece.\n\nAkira combats her when she ‘reveals’ that she’s actually Amon’s long lost lover and coaxes him into remembering her, proving their love by stating that he fell for a human who looked like her while he was in his human form. Devilman basically falls for it, but Ryou breaks him free of her ‘spell’ and lops off her arms and head with a sword, leaving a famous statue of her also without its arms or legs.\n\nI guess it’s intentional that we not know if she really was telling the truth or not. Devilman still seems to harbor feelings for her after her death since he clutches her head with a somber look like he does with Miki later on. It’s possible that Ryou’s more Satan-y side took over for a bit and killed her for the sake of either keeping Amon for himself or protecting him legitimately. *shrug*\n\nStory 4: The Bewitching Queen of Versailles – In France, Ryou and Akira travel to just before the French Revolution where they learn Marie Antoinette is being controlled by a demon who is planning on forcing the armies of her native Austria to completely overpower the French revolutionaries and take over Europe. They go inside her heart, beat the demon, and the chapter ends with both the demon and Marie Antoinette getting beheaded……Pretty lackluster story, to be honest.\n\nStory 5: The Demon of Little Bighorn – The final chapter starts out with Ryou and Akira kicking back as a part of the Cheyenne Native American tribe. They’re particularly close with the chief of the tribe, Crazy Horse, and his little sister Tiana, who has shown to be quite smitten with Ryou, though he states that he has no interest in girls and even nearly confesses his attraction to Akira.\n\nThey go off to do some hunting and fishing for a while, and Crazy Horse prepares for a meeting with the Sioux tribe to join forces against General Custer and the 7th cavalry.\n\nAs Ryou and Akira fish and hunt, they discuss the odd fact that they’ve been in this time period for quite a while (maybe a few weeks or months) yet no demon has attacked.\n\nJust as they ponder that, we discover that General Custer and his troops were possessed by demons and have executed a sneak attack on the Cheyenne tribe as Crazy Horse and his men were meeting with Sitting Bull and the Sioux. They viciously slaughter the villagers with guns and swords and are gone before Ryou and Akira put the pieces together.\n\nThey find Tiana raped and murdered, and Akira, in a deep rage, slaughters all of the 7th cavalry. History supposedly embellishes the story saying the Native Americans were the ones to kill them.\n\nNow you must be wondering, ‘Hey, that’s the final chapter? How do they get home? Does beating demons through time five different times really just end everything?’ Well, the answer is……..\n\nI have no friggin’ clue.\n\nImmediately after the end of the Battle at Little Big Horn, we cut to Akira walking through what seems like a burning desolate wasteland of an earth while carrying a suitcase. He remembers various battles from the past, but mostly he remembers his time with Miki.\n\nHe continues to walk and remember her before he halts and opens the case. It contains Miki’s severed head, which just raises all sorts of questions as to where and when we are right now. I’m almost entirely certain this manga started before Miki’s death.\n\nHe buries Miki’s head and gives her a cross as a headstone before Ryou calls him over. Akira walks past him through the destroyed earth and we end.\n\nWhat….the….hell…\n\nWhat was the point of all that? Seriously, what was the point? Despite bringing us to various points in time and space, the main plot stays the same. A demon is going to do something that threatens something that is supposed to happen in history. Devilman beats the demon with absolutely no problem, and they jump to another point in time and space to do the exact same thing. Wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nThey try to bring more Devilman-y things to it like saying Nike was Amon’s lover, but that went no where, and those instances are few and far between.\n\nAnd what was that ending? Was that hell? They looked like they were still on earth. The earth’s destroyed yet Ryou’s not in his Satan form? Akira’s not dead? How did they get back? I know Ryou was the one sending them through time because demons were infiltrating time, but why were demons infiltrating time if Ryou/Satan is the one calling the shots with the demons? He told them to go through time and screw it up just to go back in time and fix everything? Did the demons give up after five tries or were the rest of the demons in the time stream in the cavalry at Little Big Horn?\n\nBottom Line: I don’t want to say that this manga’s a waste of time……but I’m pretty much gonna. Really the only story worth reading is the first one because Hitler and Jewish fire demons…..Just…you have to actually read it to believe it.\n\nIf the other stories had been as baffling as that one, I could’ve gotten into it more. But like I said, it’s really just historic stories with Devilman v. Demon shoved in there somewhere. They bond with some people through time, but it’s hard to establish any sort of true connection in a 40-60 page chapter. I never really felt bored reading these stories, but they just don’t bring much to the table, Devilman-wise.\n\nAdditional Information and Notes: Shin Devilman was written by Go Nagai and Hiroshi Nagai (under the pen name Hiroshi Kouenji), illustrated by Go Nagai and published by Shougaku Sannensei.\n\nChapters: 5\n\nYear: 1979\n\nRecommended Audience: Being Devilman, there’s still plenty of gore and several instances of nudity. There’s also an implied rape and kinda an implied shot of a silhouetted closeup sex shot, if that even was a sex shot and not just kissing. The final chapter in particular is just a huge blood bath. 16+\n\nIf you enjoy my work and would like to help support my blog, please consider donating at my Ko-Fi page. Thank you! ♥\n\nPlot: A look at the past of Amon and Satan. What truly happened back when demons ruled the earth so many years ago?\n\nBreakdown: This volume is a complete shift away from Devilman pretty much in its entirety. Here, we’re going to prehistoric times where demons and dinosaurs ruled the earth. A winged harpy-like race called the Silene, mostly consisting of females, are proud warriors who rule over the land and take down all who oppose them. Their leader is a gigantic Silene merely called ‘mother.’\n\nThe Silene have tanned skin and black wings. When a pale child with no wings is born, it’s taken as a bad omen. One of the Silene, Sheena, wishes to have it killed after his birth coincided with the death of her right hand woman, Saias.\n\nMother, however, says that killing a defenseless child is against the Silene’s nature and pride. Thus they shall keep him alive, but he is never given a name and is never truly a warrior alongside the Silene. However, despite his disadvantage in not having wings, he still manages to become a very powerful warrior, taking down dinosaurs with little problem all on his own.\n\nHe has become as such due to the gentle guidance of a mysterious voice within his head whom he soon realizes is the voice of another outcast Silene, a white-winged creature merely known as ‘the white monster.’ She contracts the boy out to bring her food and increase her power. When a Silene named Sheena catches wind of their secret meetings, she tries to convince Mother to do something about it for fear that they will wipe out the Silene. However, Mother simply states that their fate is something they cannot avoid.\n\nAs the Silene do indeed start getting killed by the demons and dinosaurs roaming the earth, and Sheena herself gets terrible wounds to her leg and wings that make her unable to fly and hidner her battle capabilities, the white monster and the boy meet up with Mother who offers her body and power to them.\n\nSheena manages to survive despite her entire race being wiped out and hobbles to Mother where she is horrified to find her bones, picked dry with only the eyeballs remaining.\n\nAs time goes on, Sheena finds it difficult to get food for herself, but when she’s offered some food by a snake demon who stole her killshot, he tells her that he has seen a being just like her before – someone who calls themselves Silene.\n\nShe asks where to find her, and he says that they’re probably with the demons’ new ‘savior,’ Satan.\n\nSatan has allied with Silene and the boy, now a man, and plans on raising an army of demons to combat God in order to ensure the demons’ survival. Sheena arrives and hears a story about a giant sphere of light in the sky. It is said that the sphere is the where the first and most powerful demon, Amon, was imprisoned by the gods due to their fear of him. The sphere has been glowing more and more over time, and they say that those who wish to challenge Amon can enter the sphere by climbing Amon’s Ladder.\n\nSheena, in desperation to restore herself and her kind, goes to the highest point she can manage and challenges Amon. The ladder appears and she is transported within the sphere to find a huge mass of demons who also challenged Amon.\n\nShe tries her best to defeat Amon and even believes she has won and regained her wings again. When the man, having followed Sheena, finds her merged to the demon pile with nothing but a delusion and a smile left behind, he lets her die in peace. The man decides to challenge Amon, and he seems to have won. Amon, now having taken over the man’s body, returns to the earth. He does not join with Satan and the others since he lives and fights only for himself. However, he plans on battling God all on his own.\n\nBreakdown: This was a good volume, if a little jarring due to the complete lack of all things Devilman except Amon and Satan. In all honesty, I was perfectly fine not seeing the backstory of Amon and Satan. Having Satan explain it all at the end of the original manga was fine.\n\nThe story was good, most notably Sheena and the Silene’s story, but I didn’t feel like I needed to know. Considering the Satan/Amon plot was the least interesting thing about this volume, I feel like it kinda failed in that regard. I was excited to see Amon at the end, and I’m interested to see how this plays out….even though we pretty much already know.\n\nSheena is a good character, and, man, I felt for her at the very end. When they cut from a splash page of her restored and flying through the air to her to disfigured ‘body’ smiling and crying while she’s under that delusion, my heart just broke.\n\nThe boy is not very likable, but I don’t believe he’s really meant to be. I’d like to know what he actually is, though. He’s a Silene, I guess, even without wings he still has talons and feather-like features on his arms, feet and torso. He seems to be more powerful than a Silene despite his wing disadvantage.\n\nSilene is likable as she really loved Mother and is also very protective and respectful of Satan. However, we don’t learn a whole lot about her besides the fact that she was locked away because of her white wings. She was cared for by Mother, though.\n\nNow that Sheena’s gone, I hope the story doesn’t nose dive. I’d really like to get back to actual Devilman territory, though.\n\nRecommended Audience: Non-stop full frontal and back-al nudity because the Silene don’t wear clothes. You don’t really see any genitals, but they’re just shaded a little and not detailed most of the time. You do get plenty of ass shots, though. Other than that, there’s some gore and violence. No sex or swearing. 16+\n\nIf you enjoy my work and would like to help support my blog, please consider donating at my Ko-Fi page. Thank you! ♥\n\nPlot: As humans continue to be pitted against each other and the anti-demon forces mowing down any and all suspicious people in their path, it seems like Akira’s biggest threat isn’t the demons but a majority of humanity. When Satan finally shows his face, and hope for humanity seems at it’s dimmest, can the devilman army rise up and save what’s left?\n\nBreakdown: Well, just…wow. That was incredible…and massively depressing.\n\nIn this volume, our finale, Akira’s devil identity has been revealed on live television by Ryo, who has recently come to realize that he’s been Satan all along. Miki’s family eventually understands Akira’s plight, but tells him to leave in order to help protect the family from the anti-demon forces who may attack them for harboring a demon.\n\nDespite him immediately leaving, the anti-demon forces storm the Makimura house and take Miki’s parents. They eventually torture, dismember and kill both of them before Devilman has a chance to save them.\n\nBack at the Makimura household, a huge group of people are enraged that the anti-demon forces left Miki and Tare alone when they’re probably demons as well. They attack the household, and, despite a great effort by Miki and one of the thugs who has allied with Akira, all three of them end up getting horribly murdered by them. Miki in particular is made out to be an example, and her corpse is dismembered and placed outside the house on pikes.\n\nDevilman is horrified by how far humanity has fallen and completely loses his drive to save any of them since they’re all lost in his eyes. However, there’s one person he still wishes to protect – Miki. When he returns to the Makimura house and finds his beloved murdered outside, he loses all hope and only wishes to take down the one who started it all.\n\nMegaultrasuperendingspoilersturnbacknow\n\n20 years later, humankind reaches extinction. The earth is in ruin, and only devilmen and demons remain. After a long and hard battle…..\n\nAkira fails. He dies in the aftermath of the final battle, and Ryo sadly recants his tale to Akira’s body without realizing he is dead. Once he realizes that the man who was his best friend, the man he fell in love with, is dead, he mourns his loss as an army of angels comes to exterminate the last of the demons from the earth.\n\nSee what I mean? In the end…it was all for naught. Humanity went to hell before going extinct, the devilmen lost, Akira died, Satan and his army took over, and it wasn’t even a victory for them because in the end Ryo/Satan feels like he made a big mistake and lost the only person he really cared about in the process, and even the demons still end up losing in the very end.\n\nOne could say it’s a bit of a happy ending because, if the angels arrived to take out the demons, there might be some plan to revitalize the earth and humanity, but it’s still a very dim finale.\n\nI will say that Ryo’s reveal as Satan was really not what I expected at all. I always assumed he was taken over by Satan during the Black Sabbath, but he was actually Satan for his entire life. He assumed the identity of Ryo Asuka, who was the technical first victim of the demon apocalypse, and had his memories erased by one of his henchmen in order to truly immerse himself in humanity and understand them in order to fully defeat them. His falling in love with Akira is also what prevented him from getting killed by the demons on one occasion.\n\nThere are a few things I feel this finale did wrong, though some of this is because I read the first volume of Amon before this.\n\nMiko amounted to nothing. She doesn’t appear in this volume at all. Some weird-haired devilman speaks with Akira a few times, but really no other named devilmen appear which is really weird considering the devilman army is a huge part of this story. In addition, it really seemed like they were starting something with Miko in the previous volume but just forgot about her, which is a damn shame because she seemed like she’d be an awesome character.\n\nDosuroku didn’t do much either. In fact, I have no clue what happened to him. Akira calls him ‘Roky’ once and he entrusted him with the knowledge that he was a devilman, which implies they became good friends, but he disappears and is never even seen dying. I mean, considering all of humanity was wiped out in the 20 Year War, it can be safely assumed that he quickly died, but I would’ve liked to have seen something come of his character.\n\nDespite Miki not being annoying for the first time in ever (except stupidly saying she won’t fight the army of people charging her house with torches and weapons intending on killing her and her little brother. I understand why, but come on. Look where you are, take in the situation and toss a molly.) and even being a little kickass, her relationship with Akira just wasn’t done well enough for me to give two shits about her dying.\n\nShe was incredibly annoying for a majority of the series, Akira treated her like crap several times and they never shared any really good moments of connection. Near the middle of this volume, they share a nice embrace, but that’s it. The romance just wasn’t handled well enough for me to really care when she died.\n\nIn fact, I was way more impacted by Tare’s death. That poor kid didn’t deserve to go out that way.\n\nThe ending also leaves a few notes to really think about. Did Akira’s cause really matter in the end? Humanity proved to be just as selfish, fearful and vile as Satan believed they were from the start. Men, women, children, babies; all of them mercilessly murdered by humans and demons alike.\n\nYou could also say that the ending is perpetuating the lesson that Satan learned. God wished to destroy the demons because they were violent and evil beings, and Satan wished to destroy humanity because he thought the same of them. When the angels arrived to supposedly wipe out the demons yet again, could this start the cycle again? If humanity is restored, is it just damned to another massacre at the hands of something else?\n\nDespite the dark ending, I am actually perfectly content with it. Sometimes you need a story with deeply tragic ending. Not all stories can end happily. Not all heroes can save the day. We may escape into media like this to get the happy endings we’ll never have, but sometimes the sad endings can really make you appreciate the good endings, both in fiction and real life.\n\nDevilman is an awesome series, and while it does have its problems it is still a really great read. It’s not for those without a stomach for gore or dark and tragic tones, but it’s still a great manga that I’d fully recommend.\n\nFinal notes: I really loved this one shot of the people who attack the Makimura household, It’s purposely drawn erratically in order to give the people a monster-like look.\n\nRecommended Audience: There’s still plenty of gore around every corner, and a graphic small child death. A couple of instances of nudity, no sex, minor swearing, dark tones. 17+\n\n….Previous Volume\n\nIf you enjoy my work and would like to help support my blog, please consider donating at my Ko-Fi page. Thank you! ♥\n\nPlot: The worldwide attack of the devil army is underway, and Devilman is forced to watch humanity fall in front of his eyes. As millions of people are wiped out by the demons, it seems like even more human-on-human violence and insanity is erupting. The demons, having taken over numerous government heads, start launching attacks against each other. There are still numerous devilmen out there who can help save innocent human lives, but will they be wiped out before Akira even has a chance to start his devilman army?\n\nBreakdown: Whoo boy, the first quarter of this volume is insane. It is just non-stop massacre and destruction. They really weren’t playing around with wiping out humanity, even though it seems like the killing definitely slowed down substantially after the initial blow. And here Ryo said nearly everyone would be wiped out after the first wave.\n\nAfter the insanity starts to calm a bit, we see that the demons’ endgame is for humanity to destroy itself with nuclear weapons. They purposely spark war between the nations and send out hundreds of missiles towards Russia. However, the missiles mysteriously disintegrate in mid-air, and all of Russia is wiped off of the map by a huge sphere of white light.\n\nRyo believes that this is actually the apocalypse as foretold in the bible. While this theory brings about even more worry as the threat of Satan himself leading this army makes hope dwindle, it also invigorates Akira even more to find the other devilmen and make an ‘army of god’.\n\nHowever, it really seems like humanity itself is the biggest threat to his cause. I guess the Japanese government has been hauling ass in mere hours as it not only has numerous ways of combating the demons now, even avoiding the various powers of the demons, but they’ve also developed an incentive that is surely designed to be the downfall of humanity in every way.\n\nYeah, after this is over, could you guys direct your attention to finding a cure for cancer? Because you seem to really have it together.\n\nSome scientist believes he has found the reason behind the creation of the devilmen and failed mergings lately; frustration, stress, anger and anxiety. The government decides that anyone showing such symptoms is a demon and will be killed on sight. However, they don’t realize that the devils have mostly retreated from merging with humans and most of the people who will be killed will be innocent people and devilmen.\n\nMeanwhile, a major hint is given as to Ryo’s nature as his body starts to emit light just like the sphere of light in Russia. However, no one else immediately near the light has shown such symptoms. He also believes that he’s been a little too spot-on with his predictions and feels like he’s actually been dictating things that will happen.\n\nWe also meet back up with Miko who is sadly being horrifically tortured in a government facility and being used as an experiment. Luckily, she’s saved by Devilman at the end of the volume, though.\n\nDespite wars erupting in every country, the devils still attacking every which way, the governments of the world killing everyone who shows natural human emotions, especially in times of war and mass panic, and a suicide rate probably so high that they’re killing themselves faster than anyone else is killing them, humanity is still around and kickin’ at the end of the volume, which seems to be at least a few weeks or months after the government has called for these measures.\n\nAkira has formed an underground rebellion of sorts, and he has found a handful of devilmen to help him with his attack. Dosuroku and the other thugs have joined up with them as well, acting as their information gatherers and security.\n\nA band of monks contact the devilmen telepathically, revealing that they are also all devilmen who have maintained great composure and sense of mind after much training. They promise to provide Akira and the others with a great devilman army in one month, and Akira states that as the moment when they’ll strike on the demons.\n\nThis is another great buildup to what I hope will be a fantastic battle and finale. The opening was insane and really made you lose hope for humanity. I mean, even if the devilmen win, it would be incredibly hard if not impossible for humanity to come back from this.\n\nAkira’s frustration here was well done, even if you can understand where Ryo’s coming from too. Regular Akira shines through here several times, which is nice to see every now and then. Despite his desire for fighting seeming to take hold of him, you can see where Akira has the bigger hold several times.\n\nMiki also wasn’t terribly annoying for a change. She did keep worrying about Akira when he was gone during the attack, but that’s understandable. She also had one moment of irkness when she acted like she knew all along that humanity would be fine and beat the demons, but that’s also not terrible considering that she could just be trying to make light of a bad situation and latch onto some hope.\n\nShe also didn’t really do much in this volume. She and her family did get attacked by a demon, but Dosuroku and his gang beat it and saved them off-panel.\n\nThe art has even gotten a bit better, especially in the softer shadows and shots where they try to be realistically detailed, possibly to give us a realistic view on what’s going on to connect to the situation even more. It’s very effective, especially in one scene with an air force pilot that was affected by the light. That was awesome.\n\nThis is a fantastic volume, and I’ll be sad to see it end, but here’s to volume five!\n\nRecommended Audience: Wow, they really amp up the gore even more here a few times. They even kill a baby on-panel, though it’s in silhouette. There are some instances of nudity, no sex, a few swears. 16+\n\nNext Volume…..\n\n….Previous Volume\n\nIf you enjoy my work and would like to help support my blog, please consider donating at my Ko-Fi page. Thank you! ♥\n\nPlot: The demon threat is getting worse by the day. More and more people are being attacked by demonic beings, and Devilman is trying his hardest to keep up. With a new worldwide attack launched by the demon king, Xenon, the demons aim to make humans crazy and play off of their fears, hopefully allowing them to form a window which will ultimately allow the devils to wipe out humanity and take the planet back.\n\nDevilman realizes that their newest plan has resulted in the creation of several other devilmen in the world, and he plans on making a devilman army to stop the demons before they wipe out humanity, or before humanity wipes themselves out.\n\nBreakdown: This volume is more broken up than the previous ones as it actually involves several stories instead of just one long story.\n\nThe first story involves a spider demon called General Demon Zan possessing, but not merging with, everyone at Akira’s school, forcing the students to attack him. He’s forced to hold himself back and try his best to kill the spiders instead of the people. After saving their lives and earning their gratitude, Akira enlists the help of the thugs that have been appearing time and again in the series. They manage to help him beat the spiders, but Zan ends up escaping.\n\nThis story is a bit on the boring side, other than some creepy and cool visuals. Miki is at her worst so far, as she’s almost entirely relegated to being Akira’s fangirl…No, no, I’ll do you one better; she’s his lap dog.\n\nHe barks orders at her and treats her like crap, she backs down and obeys and even apologizes for being a very mild nuisance. She gushes over being told to grab his back when they’re attacked by possessed thugs with spiders on their heads, all the while thinking that Akira smells good as it’s ‘the smell of manliness.’ She doesn’t try to fight the possessed people at all and only starts batting them away with her book bag in a panic while screaming for Akira.\n\nAnd the cherry on top, later she gets jealous of a five year old girl who is Akira’s friend because she seriously believes something romantic is between them. She even calls her a brat just because Akira was nice to her.\n\nOh and she finds the thugs who tried numerous times to rape her and possibly kill her ‘sooo cool!’ after they decide to help Akira with the possessed people. *huff*\n\nThis story did get us an interesting view on the demon situation, likening it to predators and prey, and we get more hints that something is seriously off with Ryo (in a demon sense. He was always kinda crazy even before the Black Sabbath). However, it’s definitely the weakest arc so far.\n\nThe next story, however, is probably the strongest and most emotionally impacting story thusfar. The kid I mentioned before is named Sachiko, and she used to be Akira’s neighbor back when he lived with his parents (he lives with Miki’s family now as his parents are away, I believe). She doesn’t stick around with Akira and Miki for long before she’s set off on a train back home. The train enters into a pitch black cave that is revealed to be the stomach of a turtle demon, Jinmen, one of Zan’s henchmen.\n\nJinmen possesses the ability to consume human beings and replaces sections of his shell with their faces. While he claims the people are actually still alive within his shell, dialogue suggests that the people truly are dead; if not, they’re very close to death and will die soon with no way of saving them.\n\nDevilman shows his first signs of true emotion since his merging, even crying several times when he’s realized what’s happened to Sachiko. He’s horrified that his attacks hit the faces of the shell, ‘killing’ the person that they hit. this leads him to the terrible realization that the only way to kill Jinmen and free Sachiko and the others is to punch a hole right through the shell, and subsequently Sachiko’s face, weakening him enough to finish him off.\n\nI really like this story. Despite Sachiko having an incredibly minor part before her death, she seems like a very sweet kid who loved Akira dearly. Her sad monologue after Akira finds her only adds more weight to the situation. While her final death was very sad and impacting, I felt the most for her when she saw the face next to her get destroyed. She understands and accepts that she’s dead, yet she still has to witness something that horrible.\n\nThey did a great job with writing Sachiko to fit right in for an emotional impact for Akira without feeling shoehorned in. I especially like how the second to last page shows a split of Devilman’s face and Akira’s face with Akira’s crying in his section. Plus, they broke the taboo of killing a kid, meaning there’s even more tension since now we know that no one is truly safe.\n\nThe next story kinda compounds that sentiment, and while the story is also very sad, I felt it should’ve been placed somewhere other than directly after Sachiko’s story.\n\nTare, Miki’s little brother, is out late at a park with his friend, Susumu. He wants to go home, but Susumu says he’ll stay at the park tonight since he doesn’t want to go home. When asked why, he says his mother beats him all the time, and apparently there’s been a trend of mothers killing their children. She not only beats him, but she frequently sics her dog on him, even trapping him alone in a room with the dog.\n\nHe’s covered in scars because of the incidents and only feels safe when his dad’s home, despite the fact that his dad doesn’t believe him about his mom. However, his dad is usually very late so it’s not worth it to go home.\n\nWhen Tare offers to have him sleep over at his house, Susumu’s mother arrives while acting pretty normal. She claims that Susumu makes up crazy stories since he’s alone so much, and even proves that the dog loves Susumu by letting the dog loose and walk up to him. After hearing his father’s home early for a change, Susumu agrees that he was lying, and he and Tare part ways.\n\nWhen he arrives home, he finds his father is not there and his mother is mad at him for revealing her secret, also revealing that she and the dog are demons. When his dad arrives home, he shows that he’s also a demon and Susumu’s disembodied head is seen in a pool of blood in the final panel.\n\nAgain, Go Nagai does a great job of making Susumu a real character to us while also not having any other scenes before this. Susumu seems like a realistic enough abused kid. He seems somewhat numb about what’s happening to him and gets really excited when even minor positive things happen. His expression changes to that of defeat when his mother reveals that his dad isn’t home and he turns into a simple frightened child when the demons reveal themselves.\n\nWhile I feel this would have more impact either further before or further after the Sachiko story due to the fact that it’s two child death stories back to back, this is a good, albeit short, story. Rest in peace, Sachiko and Susumu.\n\nThe final story arc is the big scene of the volume to lead into volume four. The demons have set out their biggest attack yet, which is to not really attack at all. They’re purposely merging with people who still have reason, something that needs to be gone in order for a proper merge to occur, hence the Black Sabbath.\n\nWhen this happens, the demons and the humans they’re trying to inhabit quickly die. The sudden rash of people turning into monsters before dying sparks public panic all across the world. It’s so bad that a hydrogen bomb is launched to Russia in an effort to tamper the threat. With the various governments of the world and everyone else panicking, the world is on a fast track to destruction.\n\nThis is solidified when the gargantuan demon king, Xenon, emerges, blocking a majority of the view of the sky over earth, claiming that in five minutes the first wave of attacks from the demons will truly begin. Those who survive the first wave will be sure to die in the second, and if any stragglers remain after the second, they’ll continue until every last human is wiped out.\n\nRealizing that the string of failed merges has resulted in the formation of some devilmen, Akira plans to create an army of devilmen to help him combat the demons. However, Ryo stops him as time runs out as there’s nothing they can do at the moment, even with Devilman’s power. The only thing they can do is sit and watch the war between the humans and devils unravel, forcing them to watch what Ryo calls the greatest show of history.\n\nThis is also the debut of Miko, who is an ex-thief who has recently changed her ways after a demon tried to merge with her. I guess the merge was a success because despite the fact that her body changed, her consciousness is still very much her own. She believes this malformed body is a punishment from God in response to her bad behavior.\n\nAlso, we learn that she can shoot acid from holes in her chest that can melt people into puddles in seconds.\n\nAwe. Some.\n\nThis entire story is a big buildup, but on it’s own, it’s pretty awesome. The aspect of wanting to attack humans psychologically is very interesting and definitely a believable thing for devils to do. Xenon’s introduction was just fantastic. Showing him as such a huge being that he casts over a large part of the sky and can be seen from every country at once is just amazing. His design isn’t terribly great, but meh.\n\nPlus, the end of the volume really leaves you on edge for what might happen, especially considering that it seems like Devilman may actually sit this war out, at least until they have a game plan. The humans have no chance against the demons, so I’m expecting an all-out massacre until Devilman and Ryo get their shit together.\n\nRecommended Audience: All of the previous warnings remain except maybe nudity. The gore and creepy factor seem amped up in this volume, though. 14+\n\nNext Volume…..\n\n…Previous Volume\n\nIf you enjoy my work and would like to help support my blog, please consider donating at my Ko-Fi page. Thank you! ♥\n\nPlot: Now a Devilman, Akira Fudou tries to continue on with his everyday life, though he finds his newfound lust for battle to be insatiable. A devil called Silen arrives at Miki’s house with her two lackies, Agwel and Ghelmer, and they start an assault to kill Amon, the demon Akira merged with.\n\nBreakdown: Our first major devil on devil battle of the series involves the winged demon, Silen, a demon who can merge with water called Agwel, and another demon called Ghelmer. This battle takes up over half of the volume, but it’s certainly a very intense and awesome one.\n\nSilen is a great first enemy. Unlike a lot of first-time enemies, she’s not made out to be incredibly weak or stupid for the sake of an easy battle to make Devilman look badass. She actually almost seems like she may win several times and gets tons of damage out on Devilman before the tides obviously turn. She can create high powered winds, manipulate the weather, has incredibly strong and sharp claws that even render a demon’s powers useless when ensnared by them, and she can control disembodied limbs.\n\nI will say that the very end of the battle was a bit weak, though. Essentially, Silen gets terribly wounded by Devilman and calls out to her boss, Xenon, who appears in the first volume of Amon, to help her. A different demon named Kaim, who may or may not be in love with her, arrives and merges with her to help her win.\n\nHowever, there’s a catch. Merging is random when it comes to consciousness. If Silen’s consciousness stays as the dominant one, her wounds and resolve will most likely damn them to defeat. If Kaim’s consciousness is dominant, they have a much better chance of winning but even Kaim states that he has no hope of making it out alive, possibly due to Silen’s injuries being taxing on his body after merging. Basically, either way, Silen/Kaim will die. It’s just a matter of whether Devilman will go with her/him, which he obviously won’t because then we wouldn’t have a manga.\n\nDespite the fact that the ending is predictable after that point and we know nothing of Kaim, they handled Silen/Kaim’s death in a very good way that almost makes you feel kinda bad for her/him in a screwed up way.\n\nThis volume also pokes at the fact that Ryo seems to have gained powers of some kind from the previous volume. Ryo was in bad shape and lying under the body of a demon at the end of the last volume. However, he recovered incredibly quickly, showed enhanced healing abilities later on as well, and seems to have some telepathic powers at least in regards to Devilman. I know who he turns out to be later thanks to Amon, but eh.\n\nI did receive a somewhat unpleasant surprise in this volume, however. That of which being Miki. She gets some more characterization here, and it’s huge mixed bag. On one hand, holy crap she was ready to take on three thugs with swords and intentions on raping her while she’s armed with a big serrated knife. And she’s still telling them off like a badass through the whole thing.\n\nThen Akira steps in and…..she basically becomes an Akira fangirl. She gladly steps aside and even gushes over the fact that he’s protecting her and finally not being the little wuss he was in the previous volume. I swear, she grins from ear to ear when Akira steps in. Later, she even tries to excuse her use of the knife by claiming she was just scared and doesn’t want Akira to think she’s a tomboy. *sigh*\n\nShe’s also constantly flirting with him and even frequently poking at the possibility of them having sex or him seeing her naked. It gets to be really annoying after a while.\n\nAll in all, this was a great first battle, but the first quarter of the volume kinda tarnishes it a bit with Miki being a good chunk of the focus. Silen was a great enemy who got a pretty great cast off, and even her lackies were pretty powerful.\n\nWhile I know what he turns into, I definitely look forward to Ryo’s development in future volumes.\n\nRecommended Audience: There’s still nudity, though still no sex. Some swearing, a bit more gore than the previous volume. There’s even some creepy imagery involving Miki’s parents. 15+\n\nNext Volume…\n\n….Previous Volume\n\nIf you enjoy my work and would like to help support my blog, please consider donating at my Ko-Fi page.
