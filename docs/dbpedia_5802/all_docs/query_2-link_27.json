        "text": "Our beloved Devilman has more twisted bars than Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. His X-rated lyrics and general rawness has earned him a loyal following, and with frequently updated viral YouTube freestyles being his primary claim to fame, we’re never short of content to feast our eyes and ears upon. After a hard bit of decision making, Hit The Floor has gathered for you the Top Ten finest in D.E.Velopment freestyles.\n\nWuuuuuuunsen!\n\n10. Wunsen Media Freestyle\n\nFresh from his own ‘Wunsen Media‘ channel, this sick freestyle displays an un-common occurrence: Devilman over a relatively chilled instrumental.\n\n9. Showerdown Part 2 (Who’s Da Boss)\n\nTing, ting, ting. TING! Devilman on top form flossing his new ‘IM A DIRTY BASTARD’ top, available for purchase now!\n\n8. Showerdown (Who’s Da Boss)\n\n“Whatever you just said there sounds like some bullshit what a lickle wasteman would say” – Classic opening bars. Chilling instrumental and comical lyrics on this one.\n\n7. Devilman & Badness #LinkUp (RCTV)\n\nThis evil collab with Badness is a slap of energy and originality, and features one of Devilman‘s best ever verses – 2:25 onwards. “I need fags and Rizla, somebody better tell me where the 24 hour Spar is” – Ha ha ha!\n\n6. No Mics Needed Freestyle\n\n“I’m a Shaolin creature” – Devilman goes ‘ARD and direct on this one.\n\n5. #RiddimKilla Freestyle (DespaCam)\n\nDevilman‘s sexual depiction in this freestyle is golden. “I’m a dirty guuuuyyyyy!” Solid bars throughout and a filthy instrumental – no more needed.\n\n4. Plug In Your Speakers (Tim & Barry)\n\nMy first Devilman encounter, and an unquestionable classic. ‘Chinese Tale‘ bars = the work of a lyrical genius. “Bombaclaarted, pussyclaarted, do not get Devilman started!”\n\n3. Chromosome Live Lab Freestyle\n\nA bass-heavy live band session. Lyrics based entirely on jacking someone – “OH SHIT, I DIDN’T KNOW YOU HAD P’S LIKE THAT?!” – Ah ha ha, ‘ARDDD!\n\n2. Fire Bars Freestyle (S-Star TV)\n\nThis raw and hilarious freestyle effortlessly sculpts Devilman as the wordsmith he is.\n\n1. Send B4 The War: Killa-P Diss (Who’s Da Boss)\n\nThe send for Killa-P in this monstrous freestyle shows Devilman‘s battering-ram ability to humiliate his opposition, with the dexterity and hilarity behind his bars to provide a proper burial. Needless to say, after the public vote, Devilman walked away from this clash victorious. “Go home and lock your door, before you clash me need to study the art of war, you will get Texas like chainsaw!”\n\nSpecial Mention:\n\nSpitfire Freestyle (JDZmedia)\n\nHad to throw this one in for a special mention. You could refer to it as the UK grime version of Eminem‘s ‘Kim‘ – Ha ha ha, the bars in this. “Put my dick in her fanny like an O2 pay-as-you-go dongle, then I penetrate it. I’m a durty guuuy!” – Classic.\n\nWhat’s your favourite Devilman freestyle? Any other artists you think deserve a Top Ten? Leave a comment with your thoughts below."
