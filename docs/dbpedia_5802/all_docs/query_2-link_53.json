        "text": "Lol, but there was no final battle with Satan... Amon Apolcaypse literally ends with Akira regaining control, and then turning away from Ryo. It ends like the first 5 mins of Crybably ep10 basically, just before the end war itself. That's why Yuasa announced from the start that Crybaby would be the first anime adaptation of the climax up to the \"last scene\" of the manga. It's a real pity Amon Apocalypse even had to be made though, because apparently in a magazine interview with Nagai years ago, he revealed that they were going to finish the original Iida OVAs as a trilogy, with the final one being Armageddon, after Birth and Demon Bird. They proposed a budget of $1.2 million (which was unheard of for an OVA at that time) and were all ready to go but it never got greenlit. What a sight that would have been. :(\n\nThis is odd, where do those memories of an animated ending come from then... Now I need to find my DVD of the OVA, this is gonna be a challenge.\n\nThe whole last half of this thing was fucked. I feel like I need to cheer up by reading Berserk or something Akira put his grasses on and everything went wrong.\n\nNobody got a happy ending, not even Ryo.\n\nFucking idiot shouldn't have shot a kill beam at his best friend that would blow him in half\n\nBut he can't. They make it very clear that Devilman is weaker than Satan.\n\nThis Devilman running posture is on some Jojo levels of human anatomy shit.\n\nEp 6:\n\nRyo's a bit of a piece of shit isn't he?\n\nDude just pretty much trapped a bunch of innocent people in an arena to prove that demons exist and allowed this bull demon to go ham on them. Not to mention broadcasting super hardcore lsd porn nationwide where we all know kids were watching.\n\nEven fucking Griffith had standards.\n\nRyo is definitely one of the most evil characters you'll find, which is of course fitting given his other title. Like I said before though, he was a bit too comically evil that it got to the point where I just had absolutely zero sympathies for the guy even at the very end. All throughout the show I kept asking in the back of my head \"Akira, why are you hanging around such a utterly deranged psychopath?\". I kept looking for traits or personality insights that maybe would allow me to like him even a little, but nope, couldn't find anything.\n\nAbout Akira going back in episode 9,\n\nhe goes back because his encounter with that mob gave him the urge to desperately tell Miki how important she was to him. He says it himself. It opened his eyes basically and he just had to tell her before encountering Ryo.\n\nYeah, that was what hit hardest for me and sold me on the Akira/Miki relationship, in a more deep way because\n\nWhile up until then, Akira had of course thought the world of Miki (such as Ryo's infamous \"Choose. Me or the Girl!\", and we saw his choice), how her family had been more of a family to him than his own, and had sexually desired her greatly (why he went into that lust-rage after imagining her naked and aroused). But now he realized that she herself was where he drew his own inner strength from, and that of course ties into why he was able to retain his humanity and overpower Amon and become Devilman. She truly was his anchor to being human, and the core of his emotions, and that is of course why her death deprived him of it all, with the only thing left he could hold on to was revenge against Ryo.\n\nBut he can't. They make it very clear that Devilman is weaker than Satan.\n\nI don't know if it was in the manga (seems like people said the final battle was barely shown in a few panels), but the anime definitely amped up the \"anime\" power-levels with Satan when he\n\nstarts pulling out attacks that crack the Earth's surface and also destroy the Moon. That of course made it clear above anything else that Satan was just so far beyond Devilman, and thus how utterly hopeless Akira's revenge would be. It's also funny in a way that Ryo's fatal attack is visualized so fast if you blink you do miss it. But I suppose that was intentional so the reveal at the very end of Akira's missing lower body would be impactful\n\nTo be fair, Akira was high as shit. Probably thought he was just tripping or something.\n\nGood point, he did get roofied. But even without that I think his reaction wouldn't have been much different, have to remember that pre-Amon Akira is well, a weakling and pushover, and Ryo was his only best friend I think (hard to remember how Akira thought of Miki before Amon). Watching someone who was your best bud go utterly batshit like that would probably put most people in shock, especially someone like Akira, on top of the drug as well as the ambiance of the Sabbath itself, it's no wonder all he could do was be in shock.\n\nThe manga barely did anything with the battle, because it really didn't matter. It just showed the opening shot, and the aftermath.\n\nTo me, showing that Satan was completely unscathed at the ending spoke volumes. Akira was a shriveled up torso, Satan didn't have a scratch.\n\nAh ok, I'm kinda glad then that the anime showed more, even if it was just for show since it was clear what the outcome would be.\n\nIn the first episode they showed the news and reporters were asking asking him questions about attending a mysterious party and his (boy)friend disappearing. While Koda was acting distant and uncaring Akira was crying because he felt that deep down Koda was sad.\n\nI'd forgotten about that part too. That makes things have more sense to them as well and explains Akira's determination towards Koda at the stadium event scene.\n\nOf course it's also yet another knife in the heart when Koda instead turns out to be an asshole who wasn't worth crying over"
