Grab your penguins, your mummies, and your Pompompurins and gather ’round the campfire, AniFam!\n\nDEVILMAN crybaby, Legacies of Queerness, and Diversifying Remakes\n\nWhat do you do with a series that features sympathetic representation while also roundly killing its queer characters off, and does it make a difference that everybody is dying?\n\nChatty AF 38: DEVILMAN crybaby Retrospective (WITH TRANSCRIPT)\n\nChatty AF is back from its winter break, and what better way to kick off the new year than by chatting about the flawed-but-ambitious series that’s been emotionally wrecking the anime community? Vrai, Peter, and special guest Dawn get together to discuss Masaaki Yuasa’s DEVILMAN crybaby!\n\nDEVILMAN crybaby – Episode 1\n\nDevilman Crybaby is not for everyone. It’s got a list of content warnings as long as my arm. That said, I’ll definitely be bingeing the rest—they had me at “body horror.”"
