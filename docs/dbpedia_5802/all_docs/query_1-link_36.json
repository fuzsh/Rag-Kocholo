Like to demonstrate there are plenty of Seinen series that tonally and content wise could easily have been sold as Shonen stuff instead and vice versa. Like Kingdom has more in common with the stereotypical shonen action series than Death Note or even Chainsaw man do, but the latter are both Shonen and the former is Seinen.\n\nPeople in the west use it as a genre because they don't actually know what they're talking about\n\nAlso Chainsaw Man is in no way a deconstruction or critique of other shonen action stories. To be either you need to be similar enough to point out the flaws or explore the concepts and how things are different in real life, but Chainsaw Man doesn't even really attempt to do anything like that\n\nI'd say nowadays it's more of a genre (a vast one, but still with many core elements regardless of setting and variations) than just a demographic.\n\nIt is a demographic because trying to have something so vast and varied and lump it into a single genre is impossible and really that is not what shonen is by definition. People usually misuse the term and have for many years. Stuff like Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, as well as Fist of the North Star have a genre and it isn't shonen, it is instead Wuxia. It is one of the oldest genres in fiction. The properties are just aimed at a younger demographic as in young boys. (Shonen) Trying to have Shonen be a genre is a bit like trying to have the age rating of a game be defined as a specific genre.\n\nAlso Chainsaw Man is in no way a deconstruction or critique of other shonen action stories.

But that manga has repeated jokes and callbacks to shonen books. It's at least an element of its humor where it takes the piss out of certain ideas.\n\nDenji is easy to see as a Goku style \"strong simpleton\" but in a more realistic world. Someone like him who is very powerful and very stupid just ends up getting exploited, and that's pretty much all of the first part of CSM. Denji getting used for other people's ends. I predict the second part of the series will parody a lot of High School manga.\n\nI wouldn't call CSM deconstructionist either, mainly because I feel that boxes CSM in too much.

I think Chainsaw Man is just the result of the author writing a story without paying much mind to convention rather than trying to specifically contrast or redefine conventions\n\nIt is literally only a demographic and has no meaning beyond that.

You can only call it a \"vast\" genre because it encapsulates so much. And in this instance, we're talking about anything targeting 8-16 year old boys.\n\nIt is a demographic because trying to have something so vast and varied and lump it into a single genre is impossible and really that is not what shonen is by definition.

(Shonen) Trying to have Shonen be a genre is a bit like trying to have the age rating of a game be defined as a specific genre.\n\nI phrased it wrong, I'm sorry.\n\nI completely agree with you all, but by my experience in anime communities if you say shonen people will reply with any of the above mentioned series.\n\nIs it right? No, but you can't ignore that for a lot of people it's now arguably the main definition.\n\nI wasn't trying to start an argument over the validity of Shonen as a genre. Within the parameters of this contest, Shonen is being defined as a genre. Possibly one defined more by its audience or what it isn't, but breadth doesn't stop anime from being it's own genre, for example.\n\nThat said, I get that I may be asking a difficult or impossible question, or may need to dig deep to get a satisfactory answer.\n\nThanks for the responses and discussion.\n\nI disagree, because a genre is determined solely by it's contents. A genre can't be changed at the whims of marketing, but demographics can. Hence how in Japan One Punch Man is sold as a seinen but in the west it is sold as a Shonen. This is possible because it can appeal to either demographic, so choosing which one is the primary one is fairly arbitrary.\n\nI phrased it wrong, I'm sorry.\n\nI completely agree with you all, but by my experience in anime communities if you say shonen people will reply with any of the above mentioned series.\n\nIs it right? No, but you can't ignore that for a lot of people it's now arguably the main definition.\n\nI get that, but I think clarifying this common misconception and asking what exactly the OP is interested in is important here in the context of this thread. If he's interested in the archetypal \"Shonen Action\" stuff the works that should be recommended are different that if he's asking for something more along the lines of \"Historically important Shonen Jump manga\". Stuff like Death Note would not be mentioned if it's the former, but the latter Death Note absolutely belongs.\n\nFor those of you that don't see Shonen as a genre, do you have specific shows you'd like to recommend that may be especially far outside the mold? I'm going to watch Devilman Crybaby to start (I was interested before this exercise), but I'd love to hear more recs from the fringes of shonen and shows with rarely seen/atypical genres within Shonen\n\nAmong recent releases, definitely Chainsaw Man. It starts from a place similar to a lot of battle shonen but goes wildly off the rails and is willing to do things with its plot and cast that no popular, marketable series would even dream of, and it does that with panache.\n\nFor stuff that's darker and often mistaken for not being shonen as a result, you could look at Death Note, Attack on Titan, and Tokyo Ghoul. Chainsaw Man kind of fits here as well but it's even more avant-garde.\n\nFor those of you that don't see Shonen as a genre, do you have specific shows you'd like to recommend that may be especially far outside the mold? I'm going to watch Devilman Crybaby to start (I was interested before this exercise), but I'd love to hear more recs from the fringes of shonen and shows with atypical genres within Shonen\n\nI think you're misunderstanding the point some of us are making about \"shonen isn't a genre it's a demographic\".\n\nI recommend the following shonen anime\n\nWe Never Learn: A harem romcom about a boy trying to tutor a bunch of gifted females in subjects they're bad at.\n\nDeathnote: A thriller anime about a teenager who begins to murder criminals with a mysterious object called the deathnote, and the worlds greatest detective is trying to catch and stop him\n\nAssassination Classroom: A comedy about an alien that threatens to blow up the planet within a year, unless a group of high school students is able to assassinate him before then, also he wants to teach those kids both normal school and assassination techniques.\n\nJujutsu Kaisen: A dark fantasy action about a teenage who eats the finger of a dangerous curse and is set to be executed once he finds and eats the other 19 fingers. To find these fingers he'll have to discover the power to use curse energy and fight curse monsters alongside other Jujutsu sorcerers.\n\nHaikyuu: A sports series about a high school volleyball team where the main character and his rival from middle school end up on the same high school team.\n\nTo Love Ru: An ecchi series about a highschool boy who has a crush on his childhood friend, but his life is turned upside down when an alien princess comes to Earth and declares him his finance.\n\nThose are all shonen anime/manga, but they're all in such a wide variety of genres that I have no idea if you'd even like half of them, but you want shonen here are a bunch of them.\n\nAlso I don't really recommend to love ru, I just couldn't think of another shonen ecchi series off the top of my head.\n\nHunter x Hunter.\n\nI'll check it out, thanks!\n\nThis seems to be conflating Battle/Fighting manga w/ shonen demographics?\n\nI definitely see how my main post could be construed that way, but it's more like most of my exposure to Shonen is battle/fighting anime, but I know that it's a staggeringly large category of media. I'm looking to explore if there is connective tissue beyond the demographic, and if not, how that demographic has been used to create shonen throughout different eras.\n\nAmong recent releases, definitely Chainsaw Man. It starts from a place similar to a lot of battle shonen but goes wildly off the rails and is willing to do things with its plot and cast that no popular, marketable series would even dream of, and it does that with panache.\n\nFor stuff that's darker and often mistaken for not being shonen as a result, you could look at Death Note, Attack on Titan, and Tokyo Ghoul. Chainsaw Man kind of fits here as well but it's even more avant-garde.\n\nI have seen Death Note, and the start of Attack on Titan. I'll definitely look at Chainsaw Man further.\n\nI think you're misunderstanding the point some of us are making about \"shonen isn't a genre it's a demographic\".\n\nThose are all shonen anime/manga, but they're all in such a wide variety of genres that I have no idea if you'd even like half of them, but you want shonen here are a bunch of them.\n\nI mentioned in my OP that Haikyuu! is a shonen that I have watched, and I definitely understand Shonen is far wider in scope than battle anime. I'm looking for battle anime shonen stuff that may be important to understanding how all shonen work, but more importantly, stuff outside of a battling anime. I haven't heard of a few of these, thank you for the recs.\n\nOne more general recommendation is to get a $2/mo Shonen Jump subscription. Reading a weekly shonen manga series as it's coming out gives you a very different perspective than watching a completed anime. It'll connect you to the pulp roots of all this stuff as you look forward to a new chapter every week.\n\nSome strong ongoing stuff that hasn't been mentioned already:\n\nMagu-chan: God of Destruction\n\nSpy x Family\n\nSakamoto Days\n\nMashle: Magic and Muscles\n\nKaiju No. 8\n\nThese all blend familiar shonen action with comedy/slice of life, in roughly ascending order of action content.\n\nThank you for this. I actually picked up a Jump sub recently, I'm trying to be careful with manga because this is an anime-focused exercise, but I'm sure these recs will be useful.\n\nBasically. I know I could have been more specific with my OP, but lots of those responses are either repeating things I specifically called out myself, or that otherwise missed basic info from my post. I'm trying not to let it distract from the purpose of the thread too much.\n\nI'm getting lots of good recs regardless, and I really appreciate it. I'm going to be looking at Mother's Basement, does anyone else have recs for critiques of shonen shows, in any form? Like I mentioned a few posts back, broad looks at shonen as a category or looks at shows that don't conform with a lot of mainstream shonen are especially appreciated.\n\nSuper Eyepatch Wolf plays in the same space as Mother's Basement and he has some worthwhile deep dives. Some like his \"Fall of Bleach\" video are more contentious than others, but he's usually pretty thorough and insightful.\n\nWhat does it being animated have anything to do with the specific genre that it is based off? Dragon Ball and Fist of the North Star for instance are FILLED with Wuxia imagery. The entire world is heavily based on those tropes and the core fundamental aspects of the story revolve around the very essence of what Wuxia is. It is 110% Wuxia. I don't understand how anyone watches it and not see that.\n\nAgain, there's a specificity to the terms that you're using incorrectly. Dragon Ball of course derives a bunch of imagery from Chinese mythology, because Son Goku and a lot of the characters and situations are directly taken from Journey to the West, and even that isn't wuxia (武俠), but xianxia (仙俠), given its supernatural/mythological elements. \"People fight using martial arts\" does not wuxia make.\n\nBut I agree that it being animation has nothing to do with it, as Thunderbolt Fantasy, a puppet show, is wuxia.\n\nBasically.

Do you know what Wuxia means exactly? See I can't even begin to go down this road unless I know someone is making an argument in good faith so that I don't end up wasting an entire night arguing about facts that should be blatantly obvious.\n\nAll I can do is source basic facts and let you decide. I recommend reading the entire thread posted on Kanzenshuu by a user called Kunzait but the two parts that I will link are the most relevant are these two.\n\nPART 1 What Wuxia is\n\nhttps://www.kanzenshuu.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=31707\n\nPART 5 how it relates specifically to DB\n\nhttps://www.kanzenshuu.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=31707&start=40#p990368\n\nSeriously I would HIGHLY recommend that you read the posts in those links as it goes over EVERYTHING regarding this very topic and your very own misunderstand. Frankly, it summarizes the entire situation far better than I could in my entire lifetime, and it is so well written and argued that it would be a crime not to recommend it. The same goes for the OP who seems interested in learning about where all these tropes originated from if I'm correct and would like to read some analysis. The two posts that I linked go over far more than any half-assed youtube video ever did on this subject in particular.\n\nThis is one of the main reasons I cringe when I hear western fans when they complain about the music in the Japanese version of DBZ being \"too old and unfitting\" If only people paid attention for a microsecond to what they were watching, it would highlight just how ridiculous that notion is.\n\nFor shows that fit with what shounen is when used as a genre that are still somewhat unique, I'd recommend the following:\n\nHikaru No Go: This takes the traditional battle shounen trappings, but instead of fantasy fights, it's about a young boy playing a board game (Go). It stands out to me mainly in its very well written rival character, as well as in the fact that it somewhat subverts the whole \"hidden power that makes the protagonist OP\" thing that most shounen shows use. Here, the protagonist does indeed have a special ability that makes him super strong (he's possessed by a ghost of the strongest Go player in history). But the protagonist actively chooses not to use this power, instead wanting to win with his own skill. It's also interesting historically, since the US release of the manga lead to a huge popularity surge for the board game itself.\n\nMagical Circle Guru-Guru: This is one of the most underrated shows I've ever seen in general, but it also has one other interesting thing going for it: that it has two anime versions, one made in the 90s, and one made in 2017. And often you see particularly shounen fans debating how anime was so much better back when it used cell animation, but here the 2017 version is actually a really good example of how modern approaches, both technical and stylistic, actually make what I feel is the better product. Also, ironically one of the reason people didn't watch this show is because it looked too \"childish\", which is notable given that shounen is literally aimed at kids.\n\nFor more well known stuff:\n\nGintama is pretty much an essential shounen experience, especially as far as comedy goes. Most people would recommend skipping the first episode, since it's bad and anime original content that assumes you already know the manga.\n\nMob Psycho 100 isincredible both visually and in terms of its storytelling, and a great showcase of modern animation techniques. And it's also kind of an intersting outlier genre wise. The author's other work (One Punch Man) is classed as a Seinen, while Mob is a shounen. Despite the fact that Mob is a much more mature show in terms of its storytelling.\n\nJujutsu Kaisen is also good as far as recent stuff goes.\n\nFor resources, if you're interested into the more technical side of things, Sakugablog does good writeups focused on animation anime creators, and the industry in general. It's not shounen specific, but since there's so many shounen shows they inevitably cover some of them.\n\nSorry, I don't in ANY way mean for this to come across as condescending but let me ask you. Do you know what Wuxia means exactly? See I can't even begin to go down this road unless I know someone is making an argument in good faith so that I don't end up wasting an entire night arguing about facts that should be blatantly obvious.\n\nI just want to point out the irony in asking a Chinese person born in Taiwan, who both reads and understands Chinese literature, if they even know what wuxia means, while linking to a Japanese anime forum as an authority. Wuxia. Literally Chinese fiction, lol.\n\nI mean you wouldn't know any of that context about meph because it wasn't brought up, but I do think it's kinda funny from my perspective. If you're going by the purist definition of what \"wuxia\" means, then you're not really understanding it imo. I think even wikipedia is a better resource for what wuxia is, than your random anime forum thread.\n\n(& TBH maybe DBZ can be considered wuxia - the forum thread is certainly making an argument for how it could be - but you're arguing about something being wuxia with someone who is coming at it from the classical Chinese form of wuxia. It's kind of like watching someone argue that a hot dog is a sandwich, while the other person is insisting that a hot dog is not a sandwich.)"
