        "text": "Keeping up with your new year’s resolutions? Akira resolved to save all of humanity by combining with the power of the Devil to become DEVILMAN, in one of the wildest manga the Mangasplainers have ever read. Something to shoot for, for next year’s resolution, eh? Plus a reader Q&A about ‘indie’ manga. Check it out!\n\nPowered by RedCircle\n\nGo Nagai’s Devilman: The Classic Collection Volume 1\n\nBy Go Nagai\n\nTranslated by Zack Davisson and Adrienne Beck\n\nLettering and Retouch by Bambi Eloriaga-Amago and Roland Amago\n\nCover Design by Nicky Lim\n\nPublished by Seven Seas Publishing (Print Only Edition)\n\nShow notes by Christopher Butcher and Deb Aoki. Audio Editing by David Brothers.\n\nBefore We Get Started:\n\nSpoilers, first and foremost. For the whole series, and some of the anime too.\n\nContent note: There’s a lot of nudity and body horror, albeit cartoony, in this manga and therefore, stuff we describe in this episode, so it might be a lot for some listeners and viewers. If you don’t want to see boobs, butts, and some gross stuff happening to them, this might not be the show notes for you.\n\nThirdly, all images used in this article are for the purposes of review and commentary. They are photographed from the printed book, and as such, they may be distorted slightly and do not reflect the quality of the printed book (which is lovely).\n\nFourthly, Let’s talk about Go Nagai!\n\nGo Nagai (real name: Kiyoshi Nagai) was born September 6th, 1945, in Wajima, Ishikawa, Japan. He is a prolific manga author credited with inventing many genres and styles of manga over his long career, which continues to this day.\n\nAmong his many accomplishments is the creation of the Super Robot genre in his manga Mazinger Z, which refers to robots piloted by humans in their cockpits, rather than controlled from outside, typified by another of his earlier series’, Getter Robo.\n\nHe is also credited with the creation of magical girl manga with his manga Cutie Honey, though the genre did go in a somewhat different direction after this work, which is epic-ly violent and sexy.\n\n[Deb:] In addition to publishing Devilman, Seven Seas also published Go Nagai’s Cutie Honey manga and the rebooted/updated version of the story, Cutie Honey A Go Go. Cutie Honey is maybe best known for its busty heroine, and how Honey’s clothes tend to get shredded while she’s in action. It’s probably one of the stranger magical girls manga around… and that’s saying a lot. Go read it and see why David says it’s popular with “some 45-year old men.”\n\n[Christopher:] Perhaps his most infamous and influential(!) manga at the time it was created is Harenchi Gakuen (Shameless School), which added erotic and sexual content to a high school gag manga, creating the ‘ecchi’ genre of manga that is still very popular to this day. Harenchi Gakuen was one of the first series featured in Weekly Shonen Jump. It was so popular that it spawned live action films and a TV series, but was also widely protested by PTA groups, women’s associations, and other corners of conservative society. These groups eventually ‘won’ the battle, getting Nagai’s manga temporarily suspended from publication, but not before Nagai offered a final, parting middle finger to the PTA groups by turning them into bloodthirsty murderers, who viscerally kill all of the characters of Harenchi Gakuen in its ‘final’ chapter. Pretty wild.\n\n[Deb:] In recent years, Nagai has defended Harenchi Gakuen, describing it as being a critique of Japan’s “culture of shame.” In this overview of the controversy published in Otaquest, he says:\n\nI did have proper morals and, in fact, I fought hard against myself not to go too far because I knew that I was being published in a kids’ magazine. There are lots of different kinds of “erotic,” and what’s erotic to one person is different from another. Humans are living creatures, and like any other living creature we’re obviously drawn to the opposite sex. I thought that if I didn’t draw that, then I wouldn’t be representing humanity, I wouldn’t be representing society.\n\n– Go Nagai, from a 2007 interview\n\n[Christopher:] Showing that creators can get absolutely screwed over by their publishers on both sides of the Pacific, it turns out that Go Nagai didn’t make any money from any of the Harenchi Gakuen licensing. After this experience, he formed his production company, Dynamic Productions, as a studio and rights management company for him and his work (manga and anime) in 1969. Tezuka and maybe a few other manga-ka had created production companies as well by this time too, which is interesting, and many established creators do just that these days, on both sides of the Pacific.\n\nOne of the things you won’t quite get from the Wikipedia articles is just how prevalent Go Nagai’s creations were at the dawn of commercial anime and manga fandom in the early 1980s. Anime based on his series’ listed above, as well as his creations Violence Jack, Grendizer (known as Goldorak in France), Shin Getter Robo, Amon, and of course Devilman and its sequel Devilman Lady (aka DevilLady), were a big part of the early direct-to-home-video, legitimate anime releases in the 80s and early 90s.\n\nHis work really helped anime deserve it’s reputation for extreme violence and sex, you know? His work is also very popular outside of both Japan and the English speaking world, with his manga pretty widely translated into French, Spanish, and Italian, among other languages. Moreover, all of these series (and many more) will constantly get sequels, remakes, crossovers with each other and outside properties, and all of the kind of ‘iterative’ publishing that you see in North American Superhero publishing, which is pretty different than most manga, even ‘classic’ manga series’.\n\nSo I do wanna say we’re pretty glib this episode, but Nagai is a legit GOAT creator, despite the problems with his work, and he’s hugely influential in ways you can’t always see. This is absolutely a book worth checking out.\n\n00:00 I don’t know that we actually explained what this book is about, at the beginning. So here’s the book description from the website.\n\nGo Nagai’s groundbreaking horror classic that inspired the genre for decades.\n\nHordes of demons, once thought entombed forever in the underworld, have now returned to Earth. Evil and corruption begin to seep into our world, as demons seize human hosts. Mankind’s only hope for salvation is to use the demons’ power against them–and only a pure-hearted man like Fudo Akira can do so without losing his humanity. Once little more than a crybaby, Akira now wields the terrible power of a devil, yet holds the innocent soul of a man–Devilman!\n\nSeven Seas Website\n\n01:20 So the ‘BEST FRIEND’ is… a hint about this series. These fellas, Akira and Ryo, sure do a whole heck of a lot of embracing for just being bros. More to come.\n\n02:05 As David mentions, there was a live action Devilman movie made back in the 1990s that was released at the time in North America by Media Blasters. It’s now free to watch over on TUBI. Enjoy!\n\n02:30 The Guyver is another live-action, medium-budget horror/sci-fi movie based on a manga series that features extensive prosthetics, make-up, monster suits (Japanese tokusatsu-style shows, we’ll get into that with Kamen Rider in a few weeks), that was released in the early 1990s, and did really well in your local Blockbuster Video (Jumbo Video, in Canada). It co-stars Mark Hamill when his career was on something of a downswing, but it’s a VERY watchable piece of trash cinema. It’s not free to watch anywhere, maybe Hamill’s people are keeping that shit off streaming, but you can see the trailer on the IMDB page: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101988/\n\n03:50 David mentions the animated series Devilman Crybaby, a Netflix Original anime directed by Masaaki Yuasa. It’s probably how most of you reading these words know what Devilman might be. As David and Deb mention, it’s a good, but very dark and heavy anime series that adapts the main story of Devilman. No time-travel or side-stories, but a very interesting update / reinterpretation of the story.\n\n[Deb:] For other takes / remixes of the Devilman story, check out these other Devllman manga spin-offs, also published by Seven Seas Entertainment: Devilman vs. Hades by Go Nagai and Team Moon — a 3-volume story about how Devilman goes to Hell to wage war against the gods of the underworld. Devilman Grimoire is a complete retelling of the story in 5 volumes.\n\n04:50 So, funny story, the first mention of Devilman on the podcast was in the context of the color Devilman 3-issue series that Verotik published in 1995. The colour page on the left is from the Verotik edition, the black and white page on the right from the original/Seven Seas edition.\n\nAlso the Verotik edition had this sweet Bisley cover on issue 3, which is metal as all heck.\n\nIf you check out this short tweet thread by comics commentator Jog on twitter here, he mentions that this Verotik series is, essentially, three of the time-travel stories that appear at the end of this volume as a three-issue mini series. The Hitler, Joan of Arc, and Roman times stories, specifically. Also, as I suspected (and we dig deeper into later in the episode), these stories are actually from the sequel series Shin Devilman (New Devilman), which retroactively inserts time travel stories with Akira and Ryo made years later into the main Devilman chronology. He mentions that no one is talking about Seven Seas doing this, and that’s kind of my whole complaint a little later. Anyway check out that link, there’s some interesting art comparisons there.\n\n06:45 “But those boobs!” Chip’s not just a pervert, the Akira comments on Maki’s boobs in more-or-less that way in the book itself.\n\n07:00 So yeah, David mentions mentions Parasyte, the manga by Hitoshi Iwaaki, and he is not, in fact, talking about Parasite, the Academy Award-winning film directed by Bong Joon-ho. Common confusion.\n\n“This is like if unrestrained id wrote a comic.”\n\nChristopher Butcher, on Devilman\n\n09:35 This dead-end panel just killed me. I feel like it was maybe a serialization-break in the original Japanese, and then this page was edited for the collection later. I could be wrong of course, but it just seems so…? “Make it work, and keep going.”\n\n12:00 The Turtle sequence. So yeah, both this short story, about the turtle demon and the little girl, and the later one with a the little boy’s parents secretly being monsters, are probably the strongest horror stories in the book, IMO. I’ll talk about that again in a few minutes, but for now, please enjoy what passes for the softer side of Devilman.\n\nThen, some stuff happens. And…\n\n15:30 There’s some REALLY great drawings of Devilman in this manga.\n\n16:37 Yeah, the drawing of Ryo pointing directly at the reader on Page 168 really is something else. Keep in mind that this series was a weekly shonen manga, and Nagai was probably working at 2-3 series at a time, drawing 10 pages a day… sometimes you can really feel it.\n\n17:30 [Deb:] For you young ‘uns out there, “Charles Atlas” refers to the body building ads that were a familiar sight in 1960s-1970s comics, where a skinny lad gets sand kicked in his face by a bully, takes up body-building and becomes MANLY.\n\nHaha, the before-and-after eyebrow comparison is great. FWIW, this ‘after’ eyebrow comparison is from the first page of what would’ve been volume 2 in the manga collections, and the scene with Akira and Maki is meant to mirror the same scene from the beginning of volume 1, with a very different outcome. It’s just bizarre that these are a volume apart, rather than a chapter or two within the same book…\n\n17:50 The idea of Ryo showing up to offer ‘drug-laced’ cigarettes to John Allison‘s Bad Machinery kids is certainly a fun one.\n\n18:20 I was going to insert the double-page reveal spread of ‘The Hippies’ here, but it’s just too darned good, honestly. I don’t wanna spoil the surprise, it’s worth seeing in context.\n\n19:00 However, the Hitler page that Chip cites as his absolute favourite? We’re definitely including that.\n\nYikes.\n\n21:00 APPARENTLY, Chip hates heavy metal album art. Look at how beautiful this is.\n\nAngels with massive boobs and little wieners, on the run (fly?) from apocalyptic devils. If that isn’t the left side and right side of the bitchin’est van of all time, I don’t know what is.\n\n23:00 There’s just a lot of nude embraces as characters fall through time. Hell, Ryo is nude for the entire last story of the book. Shin Devilman is on a whole other thing.\n\n24:00 David mentions a thing here that sounds a little weird out of context, but that’s what these show-notes are for, right? I’ll try to be brief but cover what all, exactly, this means.\n\nSo there’s a manga called The Rose of Versailles by manga-ka Riyoko Ikeda. It ran from 1972-1973 (and has had new short stories pretty consistently since then) and it’s one of the great, classic, foundational shoujo manga works (that I swear we will cover on Season 3 of Mangasplaining). The Rose of Versailles is a historical drama set in years preceding and during the French Revolution, mixing both historical persons (Marie Antoinette, Queen of France), and original characters (a woman named Oscar Francois de Jarjayes, commander of the Royal Guard and raised as a boy from birth).\n\nThe manga became a huge critical and commercial success, one of shoujo manga’s earliest, and even aged-up the entire genre from a children’s genre to a teen/YA genre. It incorporates left-wing ideological themes that were gaining strength in Japan-post war by showing the terrible behaviour of the ruling class, and also had a lot to say about gender and gender roles due to Lady Oscar being a military commander. Its popularity made it incredibly influential both inside and outside of shoujo manga. It makes perfect sense that if you’re a manga-ka in 1979 doing time travel stories, you’re going to go to the time period that had been popularized in one of the biggest manga of the decade, at that time.\n\nWhich brings us to the Takarazuka Revue, an all-female musical theatre troupe founded in Takarazuka, Japan (just outside of Osaka) in 1913. The Takarazuka Revue is the most famous “western style” theatre troupe in Japan, a response to traditional Kabuki performances which would see all roles performed by male actors. As you might imagine, a hugely popular period-piece manga with a female character taking on a traditionally male role was Very Interesting to the Takarazuka Revue, and the Revue adapted the wildly popular manga to a musical performance in 1974. It has long been one of the most popular and beloved stories performed at the Revue, so much so that that statues of Lady Oscar, and her attendant and lover André, adorn the street between the train station and theatre in Takarazuka.\n\nWhich brings us to David’s “Video of Lupin III being performed at the Takarazuka Revue and he gets sent back in time to the time of Marie Antoinette.” Lupin III is a famous manga series by the artist Monkey Punch (The “Classic Heists” collection of Lupin III manga was recently published by Seven Seas!), the Takarazuka Revue often creates original stories as the basis for Revue performances from various manga, and there’s just something special about the time just before the French Revolution, the decadence really lets you use some great costuming….!\n\n25:20 So first up, let’s talk about these bullies.\n\n“Right outta Central Casting,” is very accurate. These bullies are like, the perfect manga personification of ‘rough’ bullies. You can tell that Go Nagai spent years and years doing high-school gag manga before Devilman.\n\nThen as Chip says, there’s just no consistency in the face of this smug teacher type on page 450.\n\n26:30 So that cartoonist for SUCK.com is Terry Colon, and his work is some fun caricature that definitely gets even a little abstract at points.\n\n27:45 Here’s that page I mentioned from Chip’s series Kaptara, with (and by!) artist Kagan McLeod:\n\n30:15 Deb’s bang-on here, the pacing in this is just… all over the place. Like the entire first 200+ page volume, which doesn’t actually show Devilman until almost the end of the volume, is paced (from a plot perspective) exactly like the first episode of an anime… except its more than 200 pages long! Then volume 2, starts with the new-eyebrow stuff above… which would be the second episode of the ‘anime’ version. Making matters worse, a 20-page nearly-wordless colour sequence is added before volume 1… and honestly from reading reviews online it seems like volume 2 is worse at this, not better. And that brings us to my main problem with this book.\n\nSo we gotta talk about what Devilman Classic Collection actually is, it’s the ‘Graphic Novelization’ of the original-timeline Devilman material. Shout out to the Devilman Wiki and a few other online sources for helping me finally put it all together. I was making best-guesses during the episode, but I did some research as we were talking, and now for this, and yeah, Devilman Classic is not an ‘archive’ or ‘reprint’, but a reordering of most of the ‘classic’ Devilman material into roughly chronological order, including the original Devilman 5 volume manga series, the Shin Devilman short-story volume, and a selection of one-shot stories that appeared in various reprints in Japan over the years. It also is an edition that excises a lot of additional material, including a bunch of pages and a few short stories.\n\nAnd that’s fine.\n\nExcept there’s nothing in the book that mentions its publication history. The book swings wildly in tone and quality and style because of the insertion of short stories and pieces completed 10 or 15 years after the fact, and there’s no guide to the material either. The copyright info just references the 1972 original. For an archival collection, this is a huge sin, frankly. For a ‘graphic novel’ it creates, well, an uneven reading experience, though it can be argued that it was already a prrrrrretty uneven experience to begin with.\n\nSo yeah, I did a real deep-dive into this to figure it out, because it just didn’t feel ‘right’ while reading it, and I could tell there were some real problems. If you want to go alllll the way down the rabbit hole, the video above does a good job of outlining the issues with this collection.\n\nAnd while I think Seven Seas is ultimately on the hook for not being clearer about what’s actually in this book, and why, and not treating it a bit more like a proper archival property (or at least listing proper copyrights), I also don’t blame them for any of the inclusions and exclusions, because this edition is based on a Japanese edition, and it seems to be the version of Devilman that’s in print to this day, with the creator’s blessings. That info probably isn’t in the Japanese edition either, but this is a book that really did need an essay explaining what’s up, but the rest of it isn’t on Seven Seas.\n\nLike, if you choose to license and publish Devilman (already pretty close to a miracle), and then you get the material in this two-volume Complete Collection, and you notice that it’s missing a few short stories and another 30-40 pages that were excised… like I can’t stress that it’s incredibly difficult, if not outright impossible, to then go and license those missing stories. If you even were able to tell that there were missing stories in the first place, because you thought you were licensing the complete Devilman and it turns out you were kinda getting the remastered Star Wars Special Edition version. Yikes.\n\nAnyway.\n\nAnyway.\n\nChip is actually absolutely right that I’m being a huge dumb Poindexter about all this and ultimately, you can read these books and get like, 95% of the material from the reading and tell whether you like it or not. And I probably shoulda kept my dumb Poindexter stuff out of the very casual fun-times podcast and down here in the show notes where it belongs, but hopefully you weren’t too put off by it.\n\nBut it really bugged me. /shrug\n\n42:00 Weirdly, the iconic rave scene at the beginning of Blade, starring Wesley Snipes, is on YouTube! Check it out to see what we’re talking about.\n\nWe mention this, of course, because there’s a hippie ‘happening’ in the manga, and it’s updated to a warehouse rave in the Devilman Crybaby anime.\n\n44:30 David was making hand gestures at this point, trying to explain that the gap between Astro Boy by Osamu Tezuka, and Pluto, a retelling of an iconic Astro Boy story, by Naoki Urawsawa, was pretty big. This is not yet a visual podcast, however. 🙂\n\n46:00 Laced with drugs!!\n\n[Deb:] Oh, 1970’s shonen manga… if you ever asked yourself, what if N. American comics never had the Comics Code Authority, well, maybe Japanese comics gives us a glimpse of that particular alternate universe.\n\n47:00 So yeah, I had to sell a TON of Satanika comics before I started working at the Beguiling, as Verotik’s blurry line between porn and not-porn storytelling greatly appealed to some comic store customers in Canada who couldn’t get real porn comics imported into Canada. So when Sirene made her demonic appearance in this volume (via 1972), the origins of the 1995 character Satanika, created by Glenn Danzig, suddenly became very clear.\n\nI should be VERY CLEAR that I don’t know for sure that there were any legal threats between Go Nagai and Verotik, this is just ‘a story’ for legal purposes. But man, does the timing perfectly line up.\n\n49:40 So when it comes to horror manga, and Devilman certainly has some real moments of horror, to go with the shonen action and the science-fiction, it really recalls the work of Kazuo Umezu (nee: Umezz). His only in-print work as of writing is the recently-re-released Drifting Classroom, which, in its beautiful 3-volume hardcover perfect edition from VIZ Media, is a must-own.\n\nThat series features terrible things happening to children in an apocalyptic hellscape, and it also debuted in 1972, the same year as Devilman! The two stand-alone short stories about terrible things happening to little kids in Devilman seem pure-Umezz to me, and while I can’t say that Umezz was an influence on the horror aspects of Devilman with any authority, I can say if you like either story, you’ll find a lot to like in the other.\n\nI also mentioned Umezz’s Cat-Eyed Boy, published by VIZ in two omnibus volumes in 2008, but now badly out of print, as a reference point. Cat-Eyed Boy starts off with the sort of insane energy of Devilman, all of these throw-it-against-the-wall short stories of this little human-looking demon with cat eyes wandering from place to place and terrible things ocurring. Then it evolves into a sustained storyline called “The Band of One Hundred Monsters” that kind of bogs it down. That more-or-less marks the end of the original run. Then after a 10-year break in serialization, the series starts up again for four chapters, which round out the end of the second volume. The art style takes a major leap forward at that point, and it was already good too. Worth noting I just checked and the VIZ edition doesn’t list the Japanese edition or publication history either, though the design and supplemental material does explain some of the history of the character and his publications.\n\nAlso, that was 150 words about an out of print book you can’t get. Sorry. There’s a couple of free previews on VIZ’s website though.\n\nFor a book that you can get, soon, VIZ is releasing Orochi: The Perfect Edition this year, with volume 1 in March and volume 2 in July. I bought a previous edition of this material and it’s really great girls’ horror manga from Umezz, totally worth checking out if you like Junji Ito’s work, for example, as I believe it was a big influence on him.\n\n51:00 I feel I would be remiss if I didn’t register the smallest objection to what David says here. While Umezz’s Drifting Classroom does technically end, it doesn’t really have an ‘ending’ per se. Still totally great, and I enjoyed the way it finishes. But it has exactly the same ending as the Nausicaa manga.\n\n53:20 Oh man, I’ve been working on this for 7 hours at this point, slow going and lots of research this week, and then Deb had to go and mention Candy Candy, Tiger Mask, and F, the formula 1 racing manga. Luckily, I love Deb, so let’s do this!\n\nCandy Candy is a classic shoujo manga by Kyoko Mizuki and illustrated by Yumiko Igarashi, that ran from 1975-1979. It’s about a little orphan girl who deals with many trials in life (including getting taken in by new adoptive parents, treated exceedingly poorly, and then returning to the orphanage). It was incredibly popular at the time, spinning off a television anime that aired around the world, as well as animated films. Due to ‘legal issues’ between the original author, the manga illustrator, and the animation company that produced the anime, the work has not been legally published in any format since the early 1990s.\n\nTiger Mask is a manga series by Ikki Kajiwara and illustrated by Naoki Tsuji, first published from 1968-1971. The series follows an orphan (themes!) who grows up to become a ‘heel’ or villainous professional wrestler, recognizes the error of his ways, and seeks to become an inspiring heroic professional wrestler… who also fights off a shadowy evil organization filled with assassins… in and out of the ring! The character got a very popular anime series around the same time, and the New Japan Pro-Wrestling organization also licensed the use of the character to create a real-life Tiger Mask wrestler in their federation, and the character continues to this day with many different wrestlers portraying him. Like Candy Candy, the animation was widely distributed into different languages across the world, and its a character who has huge international popularity while being relatively unknown in continental North America, where it has not been published (though there have been some anime featuring the character released to home video).\n\nJust between you and me, I can’t understand why no one has picked up any of the Japanese wrestling manga.\n\nFinally, Deb mentions F, a Formula 1 auto-racing manga by Noboru Rokuda, and published in seinen manga magazine Big Comic Spirits from 1985-1992. I actually don’t know anything at all about this one. Apparently it has ‘interesting’ ideas about ditching other driver? Lol. Maybe Deb will fill in some details.\n\n[Deb:] F is probably the most jaw-droppingly crazy seinen sports manga I’ve ever read. It’s about a rebellious guy from the countryside who has a need for speed that takes him to the world’s biggest racetracks as a Formula One racer.\n\nIt’s available in English (albeit as a digital-only release, and I think it’s unfinished at 20 volumes) on Comixology as part of its Unlimited subscription, so sure, I binge-read the heck out of it. However, It’s not for everyone — it’s got several scenes where female characters… well, let’s just say it… they get raped. There’s also this scene from volume 1, where Gunma, the hero of the story is so determined to win a no-holds-barred street race, he decides to sabotage his rival by dropping a load on him from his car’s busted rear window. It’s… crazy like that. Anyway, if classic manga is your thing, F is an interesting glimpse into what was being published around the same time as Devilman.\n\n55:30 I think Deb’s got a good point here about how Japanese mainstream material is just way, way crazier (or at least it was) than what was available at the same time in North America. Our puritanical roots are showing, eh? I was gonna jump in here and mentioned that comparable material WAS being made in the U.S. at the time, but in the adults-only “Underground” comics market. Go Nagai’s Harenchi Gakuen ran in, I shit you not, Shonen Jump, in the 1960s. Wild. And it’s worth noting that the Underground, made by and for adults, were still the subject of intense persecution.\n\n56:30 Rosemary’s Baby debuted in 1968, Black Sabbath debuted in 1970 (man, someone needs to ask Go Nagai about the influence of Black Sabbath on Devilman), the Satanism scare with Dungeons & Dragons in the mid 1970s. So much stuff around this period, part of the cultural zeitgeist and the follow-up to the peace-and-love late 1960s hippie movement.\n\n58:50 Let’s leave Devilman Classic Collection Volume 1 on this image, which sums up what this manga is really all about: MANLY TEARS!\n\n59:50 THE BREAK! You might get an ad here, you might not.\n\nIt’s time for some reader Q&A!\n\nI’ve just caught up through all the episodes of the podcast, and now I’m really looking forward to hearing you talk about your first alt-manga/small press comics in An Invitation from a Crab by Panpanya. Do you think you will be able to make space in the podcast for more art manga or less highly commercial works? Especially with the recent crop of English-language small press manga publishers that have popped up in the last year like Starfruit Books and Glacier Bay Books (which just won an Ignatz for it’s stellar Glaeolia manga anthology), North American readers suddenly have a chance to read works from authors they would probably never be able to without going to COMITIA. I, personally, would love to hear you talk about these types of works!\n\nAnd by an alternate coin. Do you think you’ll ever cover manhwa or “”webtoon-style”” comics. How far does the term manga stretch for this podcast? “\n\nCarina Taylor, in E-mail.\n\nLike we said on the podcast, we’re open to talking about any kind of manga, but we’re all involved in the comics and manga publishing industries to some degree, and we all want to be good and supportive folks, and we’re going to have to choose titles that let us feel good about doing the podcast. 🙂\n\nMeanwhile, Deb references the Manta Webtoons App as being particularly attractive to her as a reader who wants to know more about Korean Comics and Webtoons, because they offer a flat monthly rate for all-you-can-read webtoons. https://manta.net/\n\nDavid references the Japanese light novel and manga series My Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, one of the ‘better’ examples of the isekai light novel genre. Also published in English by Seven Seas.\n\nChristopher references Guyabano Holiday, by Panpanya, the next book (coming June 2022) from the creator who gave us An Invitation From a Crab, which we covered earlier this season. Published by Denpa.\n\n…and then we talk about Devilman some more, because yeah, there’s… a lot to say. Haha.\n\n[Deb:] Just because I can, here’s some photos from Go Nagai’s visit to Anime Expo in Los Angeles in 2018."
