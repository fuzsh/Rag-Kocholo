        "text": "20th Century Cartoonist Collection Go Nagai's World - Shokugan Trading Figure\n\nWhat is the 20th Century Manga Artist Collection? A diorama-style production of the world of popular writers representing that era.\n\n[Comics version / Akira Fudo (from Devilman)] Devilman / 1972 In the year, serialization started from Kodansha Shonen Magazine (No. 25). After that, \"New Devilman\" was serialized in the special edition Shonen Magazine in 1979. In 1980, it was published in Kadokawa Shoten's \"Variety\" as a one-shot. If the desire to transform is sleeping in the depths of human beings, this immovable Akira is the one who fulfills that desire. The transformation from the human form to the devil form (Devilman) surprises what you see. This existence of Akira Fudo was actually killed before becoming a devilman, and it is the figure that Amon, the hero of the devil world, has transferred.\n\nSize: H12cm\n\nCondition: Second Hand / Like New. Sealed bag was opened to verify contents and take the pictures. All looks great. Includes the card shown on picture 4."
