Philip Anthony Spalding (1911-1989) was at Balliol College, Oxford, 1930-3; lived in London, 1933-1938, and moved to Churt (in Surrey) in 1938, the year of his marriage to Edna Brown, née Young. Of independent means, Spalding devoted much of his life to reading and writing, and considered his diary to be his most important written work. His published work includes A Reader's Handbook to Proust (London, 1952), some volumes of verse and prose, and Self-Harvest, a study of diaries and the diarist (London, 1949).

Émile Alexis Preyre (fl. 1956-1989) was the author of Le doute libérateur: expérience sceptique, expérience mystique (1971).
