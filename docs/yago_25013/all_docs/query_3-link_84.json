        "text": "To make a real long story short, he went nuts because Olivia lied about their baby being dead and because Lizzie kept threating Olivia. He was in and out of the mental institution for months. Then after he found out his baby was alive he stopped taking his meds and turned on everyone. He got out of the looney bin and tried to shut down company. Then he kidnapped all his children, and set up a meeting to meet with the mothers. He met with Harley at Company and he got shot and killed. For months Harley was the supposed murderer, then it came out that Alan shot him. Then it was discovered that Alan was keeping him in an abandoned warehouse that was modeled after Spaulding where Phillip thought he was CEO. The doctor taking care of him read about Alan’s arrest in the paper and knew that he would no longer be paid to take care of him and he left Phillip alone. Alan told Harley where he was but when she got there Phillip left. He called Rick and Rick’s been helping him hide. Then Ross was killed when plane went down on the way to San Gabriel. Trying to figure out what Ross was working on, Harley and others traveled to Ross’s suite in San Gabriel. In the suite, Harley found the business card of the private investigator’ who accompanied Ross. Harley spoke with her partner who sent Harley a photo of the case the PI was working on for Ross. It was a recent photo of Phillip! Then Rick had to tell that he knew Phillip was alive. Rick then explained that Phillip had called again and informed him that Ross had found him. Phillip didn’t feel safe and wanted time to get off the island, so Phillip arranged for someone to arrange a problem with the private plane to keep it from leaving Washington D.C. Tragically, Ross insisted on going up anyway and was lost in the crash. The truth out, Alexandra tried to locate Phillip by putting out feelers all over the world. But we’ve heard nothing since then."
