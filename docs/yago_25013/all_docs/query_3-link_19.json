        "text": "LEWISTON — Phillip Spaulding, 70, formerly of Cumberland, New Gloucester and Lewiston, and also Barre, Vt., died Sunday, Jan. 22, at the Marshwood Nursing Care Center in Lewiston following a massive stroke, with his daughter Jana Spaulding and former wife, Dotty Spaulding, at his side. A true sports fan to the end, Phil died with the New England Patriots AFC Championship game on TV, shortly after kick off.\n\nAn avid outdoorsman, Phil suffered his first stroke in 2006 shortly after bagging his first elk while hunting with friends in Dillon, Mont. While being airlifted back to Maine following that first stroke, he asked if perhaps the EMTs could bring the elk along with them in the plane. His favorite place to hunt was in Eustis, however, and he could frequently be found duck or deer hunting at King & Bartlett Fish and Game Club or telling stories at the Trail’s End Lounge with a whiskey in hand. Active and involved, he was a member of Ducks Unlimited, the Wild Turkey Federation, Operation Game Thief and the Elks Lodge.\n\nPhil was born in Barre, Vt., and graduated from the University of Vermont before moving to Maine to begin a career as a certified public accountant with Baker and Adam, which later became Peat, Marwick and Mitchell. He also worked for Brooks and Albin before opening his own practice, sharing an office with friend and fellow accountant, Ron Taliento, in Westbrook and serving both corporate and individual clients, many for decades.\n\nTwice married, the father of four children — two biological and two stepdaughters he helped raise and very much considered his daughters — and grandfather of five, Phil’s “family” included an extended circle of friends far and wide. Among these many friends, the family wishes to express special gratitude to Jim Brownrigg, Dave Landry, Ron and Mary Taliento, and Fred Thurston for continuing to be there for Phil through a series of increasingly debilitating strokes over the last 5½ years.\n\nPhil is survived by his sister, Linda Dutcher, and her husband, John; children, Brian Spaulding and his wife, Carolyn, Jana Spaulding, Stephanie Rogers and her husband, Chris, and Elizabeth Ray and her husband, Tony; and grandchildren, Nick and Ben Rogers, Calvin and Charlotte Ray, and Sophia Spaulding. Phil is also survived by former wives, Dotty Spaulding and Mimi Spaulding, as well as a companion in recent years, Diane Jambird. He is also survived by dozens of nieces, nephews, cousins, friends and former clients who will remember him for his generous spirit and fun-loving nature.\n\nPlease visit www.lindquistfuneralhome.com to share condolences, memories and tributes with Phil’s family."
