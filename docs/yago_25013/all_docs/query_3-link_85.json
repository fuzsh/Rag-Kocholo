CHARLES SPALDING (PHILIP4 , EDWARD3, JOHN2, EDWARD1) was born December 12, 1735 in Plainfield, Windham, CT, and died March 15, 1807 in Plainfield, Sullivan, NH.

SOLOMON FARNHAM KIMBALL (1770-1825), April 19, 1795, Plainfield, Sullivan, NH; he died July 9, 1825, Mendon, Monroe, NY.\n\nnote 1: The genealogy of ANNA SPALDING (c. 1770-1825) is slightly in doubt. Although nearly all reliable sources record her father as being CHARLES SPALDING (1735-1807), a few others list her father's name as \"SPEEDY SPAULDING,\" a name not otherwise encountered in published Spalding -- Spaulding genealogies.\n\nnote 2: ANNA SPALDING, the mother of HEBER CHASE KIMBALL (1801-1868) was the a contemporary and distant cousin to would-be author SOLOMON SPALDING (1761-1816); the great grandfathers of ANNA and SOLOMON's parents (CHARLES5, PHILIP4, EDWARD3, JOHN2) and (JOSIAH5, EPHRAIM4 , EDWARD3, BENJAMIN2) were the two brothers JOHN2 and BENJAMIN2). Since the mother of Heber Kimbal and the writer of the Oberlin Spalding MS were both Spalding family \"cousins,\" growing up in Windham Co., CT at the same time, there is a slight possibility that ANNA and SOLOMON knew each other.\n\niv.

(WILLIAM4, BENJAMIN3, BENJAMIN2, WILLIAM1) was born April 26, 1741 in Pomfret, Windham, CT, and died November 15, 1814 in Pomfret, Windham, CT. He married (1) ELIZABETH SKINNER (c. 1744-1798), February 27, 1768 in Woodstock, Windham, CT. She was the daughter of ABRAHAM SKINNER (c. 1716-?) and ANNA EAMES (c. 1720-?) and probably came from CT. She died March 11, 1798 in Pomfret. He married (2) IRENE WELCH (1746-?), March 31,1799 in Windham, Windham, CT).\n\nThe children of WILLIAM SABIN, JR. and ELIZABETH SKINNER were:\n\ni. MATILDA D. SABIN, b. March 3, 1767, Pomfret, Windham, CT; d. June 22, 1846, Belchertown, Hampshire, MA; m. (1) SOLOMON SPALDING (1781-1816), the son of JOSIAH SPALDING, SR. (1729-1809) and PRESCILLA PAINE (1735-1817); m. (2) JOHN DAVISON (also spelled \"DAVIDSON\"), (c. 1763-?), November 22, 1819 in Cooperstown, Otsego, NY. JOHN DAVISON was probably a New England migrant to Otsego Co., and a member of the family of that name who were among the early settlers of the Syracuse region. MATILDA left his company ]\n\nnote 1: MATILDA D. SABIN died as MATILDA S. DAVISON.while living in the home of her adopted daughter, MATILDA SPALDING MCKINSTRY of Monson, Hampden, MA. Her actual death and burial appear to have taken place 10 miles away in Belchertown, Hampshire, MA.\n\nnote 2: Belchertown, Hampshire, MA. is generally recorded as the site for MATILDA'S February 21, 1795 marriage to SOLOMON SPALDING (1761-1816). One source speculates that marriage may have taken place in Onondaga Co., NY, at or near the residence of her brother, WILLIAM H. SABIN. However, since WILLIAM was at that time a student at Brown University, it would have been more likely that, if MATILDA was then in NY, it would have been as a visitor with her otherwise unidentified \"niece,\" MRS. JEROME CLARK of Hartwick, Otsego, NY.\n\nnote 3: No explanation has survived as to why SOLOMON would have been in Belchertown in 1795, or why the marriage did not take place in Pomfret or Ashford, Windham, CT (where the couple's parents lived). MATILDA D.'s uncle, BARNABAS SABIN (1745-1794) had died in Amherst, Hampshire, MA the year before -- so it is possible that MATILDA D. married SOLOMON SPALDING in the company of BARNABAS' surviving family in the Amherst-Belchertown area. At any rate, by late 1795 or early 1796 the couple had followed SOLOMON's BROTHER, JOSIAH, westward and were living in Cherry Valley, Otsego, NY.\n\nnote 4: Little is known concerning the life of SOLOMON and MATILDA D.'s adopted daughter, MATILDA SPALDING (c. 1806- c. 1888). She was perhaps born in Otsego Co., NY, informally adopted there by the childless couple, and taken with them in their c. 1809 removal from NY to OH.\n\nnote 5: Following the death of her husband, SOLOMON, in 1816, MATILDA D. and her daughter moved to the residence of her brother, WILLIAM H. SABIN, in Onondaga Hollow (Valley), Onondaga, NY. Returning from a visit to CT in 1817, MATILDA D. and her daughter must have soon afterward moved to the home of an otherwise unidentified \"neice,\" MRS. JEROME CLARK, of Hartwick, Otsego, NY. Here they remained until November 22, 1819, when MATILDA married JOHN DAVISON (also spelled \"DAVIDSON\" in Cooperstown, Otsego, NY. The young JOHN may have been a relative of another JOHN DAVIDSON (1734-1815), who married MATILDA D.'s aunt MEHITABLE SABIN, January 6, 1757, Pomfret, Windham, CT. MEHITABLE was probably living in Hartwick, Otsego, NY when MATILDA D. was married in nearby Cooperstown. MEHITABLE SABIN died in Hartwick February 28, 1829. It is possible that her daughter or neice married JEROME CLARK, who also lived in Hartwick during this same general time period.\n\nnote 6: MATILDA D. and her daughter remained with JOHN DAVISON until 1828 when Miss. MATILDA SPALDING, (the daughter), married DR. A(LEXANDER) MCKINSTRY (JR.) of Monson, Hampden, MA. Hampden is near the Amherst-Belchertown area of MA, and Miss. MATILDA may have met MCKINSTRY through her mother's relatives in Otsego Co., NY who had connections in the counties of Hampden and Hampsjire, MA. Soon after that, both the mother and daughter were living with MCKINSTRY in MA. MATILDA SPALDING MCKINSTRY died sometime between 1886 and 1889 (perhaps near Washington, DC). She was survived by at least one son, DR. J. A. MCKINSTRY, of Longmeadow, Hampden, MA.\n\nii. OREN SABIN, b. January 31,1770, Pomfret, Windham, CT; d. September 17, 1790, Pomfret, Windham, CT; m. ???, (c. 1789?).\n\nnote 1: One unpublished source speculates that OREN was the father of the \"neice\" of MATILDA D. SABIN, who, by 1820, had become MRS. JEROME CLARK of Hartwick, Otsego, NY. There is no hard evidence for this possibility, and the \"neice\" in question might just as easily have been a daughter of ELIZABETH SABIN (1775-1846) or WILLIAM H. SABIN (1779-1842). The latter two siblings of MATILDA D. were both rather young to have produced the necessary \"neice\" for a marriage c. 1820 to JEROME CLARK (c.1786-1864). Perhaps the term \"neice\" ought to be interpreted in some broader sense here than being precisely the daughter of one of MATILDA D.'s brothers or sister.\n\niii. ELIZABETH \"BETSEY\" SABIN, b. September 29, 1775, Pomfret, Windham, CT; d. June 16, 1846, Warren, Worcester, MA; m. HARVEY S. SESSIONS (1778-1849), (probably in CT), c. 1806.\n\niv. WILLIAM H(ENRY or HARVEY) SABIN, b. January 21, 1779, Pomfret, Windham, CT; d. September 4, 1842, Onondaga Hollow (Valley). Onondaga, NY; m. SARAH \"SALLY\" WARD FORMAN (1784-1832), May 17, 1806, Onondaga Hollow (Valley), Onondaga, NY.\n\nnote 1: SARAH WARD FORMAN was the sister of the HON. JOSHUA WARD FORMAN, NY Legislator and prime proponent for the Erie Canal construction project. (See his biography in Clark, Joshua V. H., Onondaga, or Reminiscences . . . Syracuse, Stoddard and Babcock, 1849.)\n\nnote 2: WILLIAM H. SABIN and SARAH WARD FORMAN had seven children. They were: SARAH (1807-1843), ELIZABETH (1808-1879), WILLIAM#1 (1810-1812), JOSEPH FORMAN (1814-1874), WILLIAM#2 (1814-1877), JOSHUA R. (1816-1839), and JAMES HARVEY (1822-1843). SARAH SABIN, b. January 17, 1807, Syracuse, Onondaga, NY; d. March 17, 1843, Cleveland, Cuyahoga, NY; married ROYAL STEWART (c. 1803-1849), July 19, 1825, Onondaga Valley, Onondaga, NY. SARAH and ROYAL had at least two children: ELLEN E(LENOR?) STEWART (c. 1830-1898) and WILLIAM S> STEWART (1832-?). ELLEN later married a MR. DICKINSON, perhaps OBEDIAH DICKINSON (c. 1825-?) of Syracuse. Under the name of ELLEN E. DICKINSON she authored a book published under the title of: New Light on Mormonism, NY, Funk & Wagnalls, 1885. This book is the source for much of the available biographical information for SOLOMON SPALDING (1761-1816), MATILDA D. SABIN (1767-1846), and MATILDA SPALDING MCKINSTRY (c. 1806-c. 1887).\n\nnote: preliminary posting only -- still under construction --\n\nGo back to: Top of This Page\n\nGenealogical Notes Part III:\n\nSpalding & Sabin Family Charts and Index\n\nThe following section of linked html charts will help the viewer to quickly navagate from one family to another and from generation to another, as summarized in the Solomon Spalding Family Tree graphic at the Spalding Research Project web-page.

Most of the Sabin Family genealogical information presented here came from the 1903 and 1994 books on the descendants of William Sabin of Rehoboth. These books are not available on-line, but most of the information in them is available at Gordon Morris' Descendants of William Sabin Page. Some less than reliable, but not otherwise available, information on Solomon Spalding's immediate family and his wife's relatives of the next generation can be found in Ellen E. Dickinson's 1885 book New Light on Mormonism.An e-text for this book is under preparation at The Spalding Home Studies Library.
