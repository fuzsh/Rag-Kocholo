It starts at the end of the dinner, when the dinner guests are leaving. Complete\n\nThe Stroke of Midnight PG Olivia/Natalia December 30, 2008 - A different take on the New Year's Eve episode, which starts with what happens after Olivia and Emma go down for breakfast, and incorporates some of the actual dialog.

The women take a life altering trip to the NC mountains, and get to know each other while trying to solve a 60 year old mystery. On-Going\n\nResurrection 15 Olivia/Natalia This story assumes that Olivia and Natalia never admitted their feelings for each other, and Natalia actually married Frank, so nothing that takes place after the wedding happened. The story starts seven years after the wedding. Olivia has moved away from Springfield. She comes back to attend a funeral. I have used a lot of Biblical references in this story, but you don't need to know anything about the Bible, and it isn't a \"religious\" story per se.

PG-13 Olivia/Natalia \"Olivia, stop,\" Natalia commands, turning to face her son and her daughter - their daughter - trying to ignore the fact that her face is flushed and that her children just caught her making out with her girlfriend. Complete\n\nDrunk Kid Catholic PG-13 Olivia/Natalia They're back to the beginning again, except the roles are reversed this time. Because this time, it's Olivia pushing Natalia to do the right thing - marry Frank. It's not Natalia pushing Olivia to take her heart medicine and to live for her kid. She only hopes this is a different outcome - that Olivia fails where she succeeded. Complete\n\nMy Imperfect Offering PG-13 Olivia/Natalia Natalia deserves perfection and your heart is far from perfect. It's a tangled web of wires and batteries and while it's in the right place, it does the wrong things sometimes. Complete\n\nYou Trained These Lips When They Were Champs PG-13 Olivia/Natalia She used to think she was a least an expert on kissing.

Complete\n\nThe Script Series\n\nWe Cry PG-13 Olivia/Natalia She doesn't know it, but Natalia is somewhere else - probably the farmhouse - crying too and she doesn't know it either, but Olivia is crying too. Complete\n\nBreakeven PG-13 Olivia/Natalia Her knees hit the dirt before she can stop herself and she wonders if this is how Natalia does it - just drops to the ground, letting the hard ground be her penance; just takes it as her punishment. Complete\n\nRusty Halo PG-13 Olivia/Natalia Olivia presses up against the back of her dress. \"Here,\" she whispers, pressing Frank's soon-to-be wedding ring into her hand, their fingers tangling slightly in the hand-off. \"They'll make you strong.\" It breaks her instead. Complete\n\nFall For Anything PG-13 Olivia/Natalia \"It's time you got to be happy,\" he says instead.\"Fix it,\" the little girl demands. Complete\n\nThe Man Who Can't Be Moved PG-13 Olivia/Natalia \"I know you,\" he insists. \"I know your goodness and your warmth. And I know your heart. I know that you can love me, if you try to. I can be anything you need me to be.\" In her eyes, he can read her question: \"Can you be Olivia?\" Complete\n\nTalk You Down PG-13 Olivia/Natalia Natalia is crying now, tears streaming. But Olivia Spencer does things big. Complete\n\nNone The Wiser PG-13 Olivia/Natalia She knows that Olivia is probably setting up a war camp: bunkered down in her room for hours with nothing to sustain her. She knows Olivia will stay there until Natalia comes to get her, pulls her back together and demands to spend the rest of her life loving her. She loves Olivia Spencer. Complete\n\nBefore The Worst PG-13 Olivia/Natalia It might be the dimples or the smiles or the disarming, genuine goodness of her heart, but it just might be that Natalia Rivera refused to let Olivia get away with anything without retribution. Natalia Rivera has tamed and tempered Olivia Spencer. She deserves a medal or a happy life, at least. Complete\n\nThe End Where I Begin PG-13 Olivia/Natalia \"I love you,\" she's trying to say. \"I love you and your heart. I love you and your heart and stupid one-liners and your bad jokes and your daughter and your hair and your smile and your ass in that one pair of jeans you own and your eyes and the way you tell me you love me.\" She wonders if Olivia understood that - if she got that out of the kiss - but she kisses her again, just to make sure.
