He is thrilled to have continuous opportunities to travel along-side God's people as they live through their ever-changing adventures.\n\nJoel's wife, Rachel, graduated with a teaching degree from Martin Luther College. Joel and Rachel have four children: Lucy, Judah, Caleb and Moses. These children keep the dinner table exciting, and bring their parents a special kind of joy.\n\nJoel has a large hobby collection. He enjoys roasting his own coffee (and drinking it), playing soccer and coaching it, basketball, disc golf, Star Wars, woodworking, reading, knitting and crocheting, and loves playing (and collecting) board games. One of his favorite hobbies is playing guitar and writing spiritual songs.\n\nAdministrator / Worship Coordinator Lyle Strehler\n\nPhone: 952-888-2475\n\nEmail: lyle.strehler@mybllh.org\n\nIn 1996, Lyle Strehler accepted a position at Bloomington Living Hope Lutheran School.
