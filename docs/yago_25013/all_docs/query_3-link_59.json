        "text": "Frances Bauer Parker, age 90, wife of Dr. John Chamberlin Parker was born Frances Elizabeth Bauer on January 25, 1934 in Cincinnati, Ohio to Emily Thurber Bauer and Nicholas Bauer. Fran died August 8, 2024 at Chelsea Hospital in Chelsea, Michigan.\n\nFran graduated from the College of Wooster with a degree in History. Before children, she taught seventh grade in the Willow Run Schools. After the family settled in Jackson, Michigan, she became a lifelong activist for social and environmental causes. She helped launch a community recycling program in the 1970s, was a long-time supporter of the Dahlem Nature Center, and a delighted birder with the Jackson Audubon Society. She dedicated decades to the League of Women Voters, including state-wide lobbying on key issues and serving as President for the Michigan League. Her work was recognized by the Susan B. Anthony Award, the Liberty Bell Award, and a Michigan Senate Concurrent Resolution.\n\nOne of Fran’s favorite phrases was “live fully ‘til you die” and she embodied this by taking on every aspect of life with gusto, inspiring others in the process. She was a passionate mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She took up painting in her 60s and restarted piano lessons in her 80s. She started a new chapter with John at Silver Maples Retirement Community, making new friends late in her 80s. Fran was known for her warm quick smile, her buoyant spirit, baking one of the best apple pies in Michigan, and her deep spiritual quest toward God.\n\nFran is survived by her loving family: husband John Parker, daughter Anne (Joseph) Campau, daughter Joan Parker, son David (Jane) Parker, grandchildren Joan (Adam) Campau, Peter (Kelly) Campau, Samuel Campau, George Campau, Alexander Gordon, Charles Gordon, Emily Parker, Christopher (Emily) Parker, Lydia Parker and Elizabeth Parker, great-grandchildren Piper and Dorothy Parker and Cherub Carlson, and her brother Nicholas (Connie) Bauer.\n\nFran is predeceased by her birth mother (who died when Fran was four), her father, her stepmother Mildred Gieringer Bauer, and her sister Carla Vendeland.\n\nA celebration of a life well lived will be held on Thursday, August 15, 2024 at 3:00 p.m. in the Maples Room at Silver Maples of Chelsea in Chelsea, Michigan.\n\nPlease visit Fran’s Memorial Page at Everloved.com/life-of/frances-parker/ where you can leave a memory of Fran or make a donation in lieu of flowers to Doctors Without Borders.\n\nArrangements by Staffan-Mitchell Funeral Home."
