        "text": "Huzzah! I found more. I now have three full episodes, scroll down for the links. Check out the original version of this post with a link to highlight clips only:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/bauer-bbq-2001/\n\nThis is one of my favorite Bauer BBQs and actually it’s one of my favorite years in Springfield period. It’s just a great time period. We are just on the tail end of an umbrella story that had Edmund marry Beth and take the kids and Lillian down to San Cristobel, take over the throne (turns out Richard wasn’t legitimate, long story), and kidnap Cassie. Phillip was down with Richard helping with a coup. Harley’s pregnancy is actually part of the pay off of a storyline that when Abby left him, Harley realized Phillip had impregnated Beth and lied about it, Eleni had left Frank, and Selena had left Buzz they all got together and got drunk and Harley and Rick slept together. Harley got pregnant and while Phillip was divorcing Harley and had his attention focused on rescuing Beth and his kids and Harley’s kid Susan from Edmund’s influences, Harley and Rick hid it from him. We’re almost up to this point in our episode guide, basically as the last part of The Perfect Storm. They got Danny out of trouble with the mob and the immediate problem with FBI, but Gus Aitoro is committed to getting him. Michelle had destroyed the evidence May had against them. So Gus pressured Harley into becoming his assistant and pressured her into planting a bug in the Bauer living room. Gus also got Harley to get all of the Bauers out of the house and used the opportunity to get Danny’s home gun (he’d killed Carmen with his office gun) and to get a cartridge to plant to frame Danny. Danny will shortly go on trial. Josh and Reva split up over the revelation that Reva had been married to Richard when she was gone. Reva is also currently temporarily blinded. Josh married Olivia and Reva is dating Noah. Tony had broken up with Marah to keep her safe, but not understanding that she’s using Sam to make him jealous and Catalina is taking advantage of the situation, apparently not caring that he didn’t care enough about HER welfare to push her away. The funniest storyline right now requires you to swallow the fact that Buzz would be interested in Holly even though she was fairly directly responsible for Jenna’s death. When Billy got out of jail for shooting Roger Thorpe, Buzz Cooper stepped up and got him probation/work release. They fought a friendly competition for Holly’s affection that I think had more to do with beating each other than Holly. Holly took it mostly in that spirit and will dump them both in a nanosecond as soon as Ed comes back to town and gives her a second look.\n\nFind the prep from the day before in the highlight clip. Tony is upset because he thinks they should be doing something for the case prep.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJQPfFSRF4I (Watch night before prep first two minutes, after that switch to full episodes at the bottom.)\n\nDanny: “You’re going to upset, Michelle.”\n\nTony: “She’ll be more upset when you go to jail for murder.”\n\nDanny: “Yes she is. So the least I can do right now is to give her every bit of happiness and normalcy that I can manage. Do you understand?”\n\nJuly 4, 2001\n\n2001 provides one of the most detailed prep periods. I just love Rick as general of the BBQ and they could have done it every year. I don’t know why they never had Danny behind the bar at the BBQ. He does such a good job when he works at Millennium. I just love his speech about the drinks he makes when they hire him. I think it’s a total waste of talent and obviously between this and burning the money in San Cristobel it just shows that as much as I love him, the boy can’t grill. I love his BLACK Hawaiian shirt. I wish he’d worn it to the last one, I didn’t really care for his outfit for Bauer BBQ 2009, although once I realized his shorts matched Robbie’s it grew on me. I could just see Robbie picking them out to be like his Dad. Happy sigh!\n\nI would have liked to see Danny in the apron and THE HAT. I thought it was a bit much to say Robbie wouldn’t wear the hat either. I greatly look forward to the day when Robbie wears the hat. The line about have your own son was because Harley was coming in (apparently via the patio doors far away from any parking area) and she was pregnant with Rick’s son Jude Bauer.\n\nBeth had believed in the fairytale of Edmund after she had lost Phillip to Harley. Beth believed in Edmund’s story until she discovered he’d locked Cassie in a tower. He really didn’t mean her THAT much harm, but he got sick himself and Cassie was stuck without food and water and almost died. When Beth discovered her rather than letting Beth leave him and tell people he locked her in. Beth freaked broke out a window and fell that’s why she was in the hospital. Richard was a cool guy. Jeffery was a complete loser in comparison.\n\nReva was temporarily blinded, basically for the sake of the story of when her sight came back. For once Reva is doing a story Michelle already did and not the other way around. That’s kind of late for the party to be starting normally people arrive around noon, but they just seem to be arriving and it’s dark out. Josh and Olivia were still married and he’d brought her into Lewis Construction and they had put in a bid for a MAJOR construction project in San Cristobel. Olivia’s government contracts were signed by Edmund with Richard coming back as elected President the contracts were in question.\n\nTony and Ray are Danny’s cousins, so now pulled in to helping with the BBQ. Danny is currently being prosecuted for his mother’s death (which he thinks he did in defense of life but covered it up – Carmen really is still alive and the body they pull out of the lake isn’t hers). FBI Agent Gus Aitoro, who is behind the prosecution, is trying to get Danny because he holds Danny’s father responsible for his own father’s death and Gus intends to get revenge on Danny. (Apparently in all that lawyer learning he got, he skipped the bit in the Constitution about the no contamination of the blood clause – meaning that children can’t be punished for their parent’s crimes.) Gus is currently working up to romancing Harley who is pregnant with Rick’s child Jude.\n\nI love Rick’s little show at the beginning of the clip. They refer back to both Rick’s wearing the hat and Danny hating the hat and apron when Manny return at Bauer BBQ 2009. Phillip has just returned from San Cristobel where he was trying to rescue Beth and his children and Harley’s daughter Susan. I think Harley is referring to when Phillip leads a commando style raid to rescue Beth from Edmund. As their marriage broke up, (I will spare Pharley fans my analysis about why it never stood a chance to begin with) in part over Phillip’s constant efforts to protect Beth, this latest rescue went over like a lead balloon with Harley, even though her own daughter was involved. She is currently pregnant with Rick’s child, the future Jude Bauer, from a drunken one night stand.\n\nFire breaks out.\n\nRay: “Anyone for well done?”\n\nDanny: “I’m just getting the hang of it.”\n\nRick: “We only have so much chicken here. You are now in charge of coleslaw and pouring the iced tea.”\n\nThat was a great couple communication when with a couple of significant looks, Michelle tells Danny that Rick is the father of Harley’s baby.\n\nRick to Tony: “Take over here and keep Danny away from the BBQ. I don’t want him blowing up the house.”\n\nSeriously Harley, I know you think you’ve done the right thing, but honestly you’re betraying some of your best friends. I don’t blame Tony and Danny from being mad at her. Harley still gets Tony to act like her trying to put his cousin on death row is no big deal.\n\nHarley: “Feed me. I’m hungry.”\n\nTony: “How about this one, it’s fried to a crisp like you’re trying to do to my cousin.”\n\nBlake and her twin sons Jason and Kevin come running in with water pistols and then Ross carries in Clarissa. At this point Blake had published her 2nd book. (Her first book was the romance she imagined between Ross and Holly while she was pregnant with Clarissa and hiding from Ross at the Bauer BBQ.) She had decided to use Selena Davis’s true life story of a romance with Miguel Santos (which produced a never seen on screen Miguel Santos, Jr.) as the basis of this second book. (When she could have used Manny? Or Jezz? Or Bloss or even Blen? Why Selena?) However, Blake’s failure to disguise the people involved adequately led to either Abuela or Carmen putting a hit out on Selena. Selena barely made it out of town in time, leaving Buzz heartbroken and beaten by the goons that came after her. Blake is thinking that stirring up the past led to Danny being on the murder charge, hence the apology.\n\nSo family stories get passed down. Tony has been told the hot tub was covered because “some kid almost drowned.” Marah remembers the incident involved Kevin Marler, but being a Springfielder utterly dismisses it. So someone almost died, they’d have come back! LOL. Sam is like I’m getting all the making out I can get from this bad deal as Marah tries to make Tony jealous, not knowing he’d broken up with her to protect her. Reva is currently dating Noah (a San Cristobel combination doctor and spy) basically to keep from getting bored when Josh refused to heel back from Olivia fast enough. The best thing about them was their couple code which was Nova – one of the best ever. Noah was down in San Cristobel because he was helping Richard over throw Edmund and rescue Cassie. Noah, not being an idiot, could tell sometimes that Reva just wasn’t that into him. Alan was dating Claire Ramsey at the time and it was too bad that he broke up with her because they were actually a pretty cool couple. So glad that Phillip is going to take Lizzie and James to the BBQ. Richard shows up to surprise Cassie at the BBQ. This is a very prominent Rassie moment. That’s really sweet how both Tammy and RJ both totally adopted Richard as their dad.\n\nJuly 5, 2001\n\nPhillip didn’t know Harley was pregnant. Nice reminder that Phillip saw Michelle as almost a little sister. I love how familiar Danny is with the hospital and its staff, it just goes to show that he spends a lot of off camera time there lunching with Rick, dropping off Michelle, etc. I just think it’s nice. Danny: “No it’s just some friend of Rick’s from the hospital.”\n\nThis is my favorite haircut on Danny. It’s just gorgeous and it’s shown to full effect during his conversation with Tony which does a nice job of showing of their positive relationship. Beth had been a bit blind, but Edmund did encourage her to be more of an equal partner than any of her other boyfriends/husbands. He just lied…a lot and plotted some.\n\nConsidering Phillip got the woman Rick loved/was married to twice before, I don’t think he has a lot of moral high ground to stand on here. This is one of the most mature scenes ever for Beth. I like her taking responsibility. Oh, Michelle is carrying around Robbie behind Jolivia, he’s so cute!\n\nRichard: “Only a natural catastrophe could stop this project.” I laughed too because that’s exactly what stops it, an earthquake. The writers must have known already. 🙂\n\nHarley is actually wrong here. Harley basically hates Beth because she wanted to erase her very existence from Phillip’s life and she wouldn’t disappear. Harley reads as a stronger character than Beth, but she made just as many stupid repeated mistakes. And considering that Harley hasn’t been through a tenth of what Beth was I don’t think it’s fair to compare them.\n\nReva watches the fireworks with Josh and actually sees sparks of light.\n\nThis a great jalapeno fight between Buzz and Billy over Holly. Blake apologizes to Danny for the trouble her book caused. Danny very kindly tells her there’s no need and just shows what great step-siblings-in-law they will be.\n\nGus has no right to come to Bauer BBQ, but he is starting to chase after Harley, he will ultimately catch her, and he’s trying to make Danny miserable so he comes. Really Gus is lucky Danny isn’t the man Gus thinks he is or Gus would be in the lake by now. Lucky for Danny he isn’t though because later Gus does make some amends for faking evidence against Danny etc., by saving his life from the warehouse fire and they grow to have a more friendly, although still very prickly relationship. Gus should really give up the quips, he’s no Ben Warren. Currently Gus is making up to Blake hoping to get more information from Selena and find out who Blake’s source was which nobody will tell him although most of the people we know in town either know or could guess. Not having learned her lesson with Ben Warren, Blake is heavily flirting back to him trying to get information out of him. Ultimately she will turn up the evidence that shows who Gus really is (at least who he thinks he is at this point) and the lengths he will go to try to destroy Danny. BOO GUS! HISSSSS! At this point Bloss and Manny are really each other’s closest couple friends, although not as close as Dresse and Manny had been. Blake and Michelle share the bond that they were once and future step-sisters and I wish the show had played that up more rather than playing Blake as a Thorpe all the time. She was Bauer to in a very real way although her efforts to help Manny get out of legal trouble (which she actually does a couple of times) are as close as they get to playing Blake and Michelle as sisters.\n\nNot a good idea, Frank? How about highly illegal? Once someone who is an occupant of a house asks you to leave you are supposed unless you are also an occupant which Gus wasn’t.\n\nFinally, having survived Selena breaking his heart (I really think he was mostly with Selena to keep himself from dwelling on Jenna being gone and to give her full credit Selena, she was very good with his kids), Buzz was ready to move on to Holly. While Buzz really should have had issues with Holly who’s actions had helped bring about Jenna’s death, look around the canvas and there aren’t a lot of more tenable options. They move into a triangle with Buzz-Holly-Billy. Buzz and Billy were friends because when Billy was released from prison from trying to kill Roger Thorpe, Buzz was supportive and gave Billy a job. They had formed a friendship and I think their love of competing with each other played more into the romance than anything about Holly which is good because she will dump them both flat the SPLIT SECOND Ed returns to town. However, at this point they are still fighting over her. Billy had doctored up a bowl of chili to make it superhot to give to Buzz to keep him away from Holly. Buzz put it down and Gus picked it up and took a huge spoonful. Billy is the only one who understands Gus’s reaction and that’s why he’s laughing his head off.\n\nJuly 6, 2001\n\nI think Phillip has a point about the “Cooper” attitude. Buzz was always terrible to Phillip, which considering Buzz’s history took a lot of gall. Michelle says the kids are watching cartoons in the den. Nice the rarely seen den got a shout out. This is the start of Harley’s Phillip is evil incarnate downslide. I think Phillip has a reason to be upset and I don’t think it was arrogant for Phillip to think that the only one to get Harley pregnant while they were still married was him. Harley should have taken it as complement. Rick is also right Harley spends a lot of time cutting Rick out of Jude’s life which sucks considering how long Rick longed for a kid of his own to raise. Actually I think Buzz gets so mad because Phillip is exactly right about what Buzz is doing.\n\nI hate the way the Coopers keep trying to take over the BBQ. Buzz to Blake: “Don’t confuse me with facts.”\n\nThis is a nice Ross-Phillip conversation. Ross had his faults, but he was always a great mentor to Phillip. Oh, point Ross, “Just the way you told your wife you had a kid coming with Beth.” Ross to Rick: “[Phillip] is in run silent, run deep mode, you know how he gets.\n\nRick’s right that he did betray Phillip, but again they have a two for one score here.\n\nWith moves like these Sam is using on Marah I don’t know why he never really had a love interest of his own. Susan/Daisy had the best chemistry with him and she left the show a couple of months in. But Sam just never seemed to get Marah just wasn’t into him. Really it wasn’t Noah’s place to tell Reva’s kids about their engagement. Really nice Danny-Rick conversation at the end.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

He tells God he wants Him to protect Danny, but he doesn’t think he can. He wonders if that makes him as bad as the guy who will pull the trigger. Ray comes in and sees his brother praying. He approaches Tony and asks him how he got in. Tony said he picked the lock. Ray tells him he could have just called. Tony tells him he needed to be there alone and he didn’t want to see him. Ray asks him what is wrong and asks if it is about Marah. Tony tells him he broke up with Marah and that is all over. Ray doesn’t think it is over her and tells him he should give it a few days. Tony gets angry and says he doesn’t have a few days. Ray says he came there for help so he should open his heart and trust Ray. Tony tells Ray to back off. Ray says his job is to listen and not to judge. Tony says Ray judges him all the time. Ray agrees, but says he wants to make it better. He wants Tony to trust him. He tells Tony if he tells Ray in confession, his confidence will be protected. Ray goes to the confessional and Tony follows. He tells Ray that he is going to be part of a murder. Ray asks who will be killed and Tony tells him there is a hit out on Danny and he can’t stop it. Ray asks Tony if he is sure and advises Tony to warn Danny. He tells him he owes Danny. Tony thinks Danny has to know people are after him. Ray insists that Tony tell Danny or at least Abuela. Tony tells Ray that Abuela can’t stop it either because she is in on it. Ray tells him he has to give Danny a fighting chance. Tony gets up to leave. Ray comes out and pushes him up against the wall and tells him to listen. Ray tells him he has to warn their cousin. He realizes that Tony must be thinking of taking over the family. He tells him that is no way to repay Danny for all he has done for Tony and that Danny’s only “sin” was to decide to leave “the family business” so he can give his child the father he deserves. Ray asks if Tony taking over has anything to do with why he broke up with Marah. Tony isn’t listening. Ray refuses to give Tony absolution since there is no true repentance if he lets this happen, especially for his own gain. Tony tells Ray he can’t tell Tony anything unless he is willing to take off his collar and walk away from the church, since that is Ray’s protection from the world they live in. Tony tells Ray that the love and forgiveness act is a big crock. Ray says he will forgive him, but Tony’s heart is hardened. Tony says he lives in the real world and makes real choices. He doesn’t hide in the Church when his father gets killed. He reminds Ray that he left his brother when their father died, leaving him for God. Ray asks if he is going to let this happen to Danny. Tony says it is what he has to do to survive and Danny should see this coming. Tony leaves and Ray falls to his knees to pray this won’t happen. (Note from Tony and Marah blog: I feel sorry for Ray during this time. Ray was always torn between loyalty to his family and being a priest.)\n\nAt Olivia’s Marah is sitting on the couch holding her Saint Anthony medal that Tony gave her and thinking about Tony. Sam walks into the apartment and asks how things are at depression central. He tells her cheap chocolate is the wrong way to go. He has a better suggestion. He gives her a present that she opens and smiles at. She has no idea what it is. He tells her it is a tuning fork. He shows her how to hit it and get the vibrations and hold it to her forehead. He tells her it will relax and dissolve her distractions helping her harmonize her feelings, aligning herself and centering her power. Marah thinks it is weird, but seems nice. Sam smiles and tells her it must be working since she hasn’t thought about Tony in 15 seconds. Marah tells him that she doesn’t want to forget about Tony.\n\nJosh and Olivia come in and Olivia tells Josh the children are playing together nicely. Sam and Marah tell Josh about the tuning fork and are laughing. Olivia brings in the chocolates from San Cristobel and Sam goes for a piece. Marah comes over and tries some. Sam tells Josh they finally found something Olivia and Marah can agree on, chocolate. Josh thanks Sam for helping Marah get over Tony.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sERwsNV55Fw\n\nWed., March 21, 2001 – At the Bauers: Danny and Michelle are looking at their son. Danny says this is all he ever wanted. Michelle says she knew that all along and that is why she waited for him. Danny says the only reason he continued with illegal trading was to convince the other families he was one of them and not a threat. Now the feds will want him to turn on all the other families. Either he turns them in or deals with the feds. He doesn’t think there is any way out for him. Michelle says maybe May’s boss will have the solution. Danny says if he has to go to prison to protect her and Robert, he will. Michelle tells Danny that prison is not an option. Danny says if he takes the fall, the other families will protect her and the baby, they will see him as their hero instead of as a traitor. Michelle doesn’t want to lose him now that they are back together. Danny says this is the only way. Meta comes in and tells them she could hear them in the kitchen. Michelle tells her about Danny’s decision. Danny tells Meta he would have never went to the hospital if he had knows about May. Meta doesn’t believe he would have turned his back on his son and his wife. She thinks there has to be a way to get out of this. Michelle tells Meta that May asked Danny to meet with her boss. Meta thinks that could be tricky and Danny goes over the drawbacks again. He admits he is only stalling for time by agreeing to meet with the feds. He sits with Michelle on the couch, admiring his son and tells them that every day he spends with them, he will be grateful. Michelle tells him that she has faith that it will work out and they will be together. The phone rings and Meta goes to answer. May tells her that it is May and Meta tells her she thought her name was Mary. May seemed upset that she knew about her true identity, but tells her that she needs to talk to Danny. Danny picks up the phone. May tells Danny her boss will meet with him tomorrow. Danny hangs up and tells Michelle he will wait and see what they have to offer. They talk about the witness protection plan. Meta offers to come along if it is somewhere exotic. Danny thinks he should go alone if that is the case. Michelle says they will go together with their baby. Danny tells her that when you go into the witness protection plan, there is no coming back or contacting your old life. Meta comes over and the three hug.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5F3-dWsG_U\n\nThurs., March 22, 2001 – At the Santos Compound: Tony is standing in the dark looking at a picture of Danny. Ray comes in and flips the lights on. He asks Tony if it is any easier facing things in the dark. Ray is still very angry about the hit planned on Danny. Tony tells Ray he can say nothing about it. Ray manhandles Tony and tells him he has to face up to things. Tony pushes Ray back and Ray tells him to go ahead and hit him. Tony backs off and Ray tells him that he knew he couldn’t hurt one of his own. Then he reminds him that Danny is one of them as well. Tony tells him he wished he never stepped into his confessional. Ray tells him that was the smartest thing he ever did. Tony tells him the whole thing is very complicated and Ray should leave him alone or things will be a whole lot worse. Ray wants an explanation, but Tony asks Ray to trust him. Ray says he will pray for him and walks out. Tony says, “You do that, you pray for me.” At the Bauers: Danny is wound up and having a drink. Michelle tells him it has been a long day and things will look better in the morning. Danny says he will not turn over on the other families. If the other families suspect he is meeting with the feds, he is dead. Michelle doesn’t think they will find out. They have come too far to let anything bad happen now. She promises they will make it and be together safely. Danny sighs and says maybe she is right. She asks him to come to bed. He tells her he will be up in a few minutes. Danny fell asleep on the couch and is dreaming about the night on the docks when he shot Carmen. He tells her to hang on and keep breathing but she doesn’t make it and he sees all the blood on his hands. When he looks back down at Carmen, he sees Michelle lying there lifeless. He cries out to her and wakes suddenly. Michelle asks him if he is all right. He tells her he had fallen asleep. He hugs her and tells her that he loves her and doesn’t want anything to hurt her or Robert. Michelle asks about Danny’s nightmare, but he doesn’t want to talk about it. He just wants them all to be safe. He has all these different ideas but nothing that he thinks will work. He tells her that the clock is ticking and there has to be an answer. Michelle says if he rests, an idea will come to him. Danny calls May and tells her that the meeting is off. She says her boss will be disappointed and he better reconsider. She says he is making a dangerous decision and he better have a good reason. Danny tells her that the meeting is off again and she tells him that he doesn’t have any choice in the matter. The feds will move with or without him and it is up to him whether he will go down with the others or not. Danny tells her she doesn’t have enough on him and he doesn’t know enough about the other families. He tells her he will meet with her boss but he needs time to see what he can find out about the others. May agrees but tells him that he doesn’t have long. She is going out on a limb for him because they are friends. Danny tells her that they are most definitely not friends. Danny hangs up and tells Michelle that he bought them a little time. He is still worried. Michelle tells him they have the perfect baby boy and she is sure God would not have given them a son just to take his Daddy away. Danny says he should have been more aware of May’s agenda and they wouldn’t be in this mess. He tells her that he bought some time, but sooner or later he will have to deal with the feds.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMJ7B6122Uk\n\nMy Comments:\n\nDanny, Tony, and Ray are all caught “between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea” each in their own unique way. Danny is caught between the mob and the FBI. Tony is caught between his loyalty to Danny and Abuela. Ray is caught between helping Danny and honoring his faith.\n\nI wonder what the backstory is on the chocolate.It makes no sense good chocolate would come from San Cristobel because the Santos family always brought in good chocolate from Springfield for their associates because you couldn’t get as good in San Cristobel. They never really did know what to do with Sam was he mature or a kook? He had the best connection and relationship with Susan and if she’d stuck around a Max Nickerson – Susan LeMay – Sam Spencer triangle might have had some legs. As it was Sam just kind of hung around mooning over Marah despite the fact she couldn’t signal “Let’s just be friends” any louder.\n\nIt’s strange the church was locked when Tony arrived, most churches, used to anyway, have a policy of either staying unlocked or having a key somewhere the members knew about. We’ve seen people coming and going from St. Michael’s at odd hours before.\n\nDanny again spells out the options for Aunt Meta. I’m glad she’s pro-Manny now. Meta is smart, clever and knows a thing or two about getting out of a murder wrap. I really wish Michelle’s uncle Mike had been able to be part of this story though. That would be even better.\n\nThis Danny falling asleep downstairs stuff is clearly designed to get in the nightmare without having to break out another Bauer set today. I can believe Danny had that nightmare though and that it shook him into changing his plan. I would like to know though. This is soap world will they just be cuddling or is Michelle magically healed without recovery time? I think that’s an awful shot of Michelle when she first replaces Carmen. The angle is bad and you’re not sure it’s her. Nice recapping pick up at the beginning of the next episode.\n\nFri., Feb. 16, 2001 – Michelle comes into Danny’s office and sees Abuela. Abuela asks her what she is doing there. Michelle tells her that she is there to see her husband. Abuela tells her that Danny is not her husband. Michelle tells her that Danny still loves her and she is carrying his child. Abuela tells her to leave. She says Michelle has no right to tell Danny how to live his life. Abuela tells her that all Danny’s decisions were made by his own free will and he chose his family against her. Michelle tells her that Danny can make his own decision and he loves her. Michelle says Danny is in agony and is still running the family because of the guilt Maria and Carmen caused. Abuela tells her that she is selfish and her stupidity will get her in trouble. She accuses Michelle of looking down on them and reminds her that she is not a Santos and never will be. Michelle tells her that she isn’t going anywhere. Abuela tells her that may be dangerous to her. Danny walks in and asks Michelle what she is doing there. Michelle tells him that she is listening to his grandmother threaten her. He asks her what she means. Michelle tells Danny that she told Maria that she and her baby want Danny back and are determined to get him. Then Maria told her that it would be seriously dangerous to her health to keep it up. Maria calls Michelle paranoid and gets upset and leaves. Danny tells Michelle that she is ruining his day, coming around and starting trouble. He asks her why she had to come get into it with Abuela. She tells him that she was just stating the fact that they will be together. Danny starts to protest but Michelle tells him that it will happen. She tells him that she is sorry but she won’t stop fighting for him. He gives up and asks what she came there for. She tells him that she brought him a gift for Valentine’s Day. It is the latest sonogram. He takes it and thinks about not opening it. He eventually does and is taken aback. He is impressed at the growth and smiles. She tells him that is her reason and proof that they will be back together. He doesn’t understand. She tells him that they are from different worlds but not so different that there love couldn’t produce a child.\n\nAlternative Version:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNPkhq4WfjQ&feature=PlayList&p=D1B0506BAFFF0F2C&index=23\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sZFFjqFvlY&feature=PlayList&p=D1B0506BAFFF0F2C&index=24\n\nMon., Feb. 19, 2001 – Danny comes to Michelle’s table and tells her there is no point in her hanging around here. Michelle tells Danny she is staying but Danny says she is wasting her time. He appeals to Frank, who walks away. Michelle insists she will be waiting for him and tells him when he comes to his senses she will be at home.\n\nAt the Lighthouse Tony tells Marah he wants things to be different from when she was a prisoner. He tells her that it is their place now and starts kissing her. Tony offers her something to eat and then starts talking about Shayne’s hockey team. Marah wonders if something is wrong since he is changing the subject to hockey. He tells her that he is just trying to make conversation. He is trying to slow down and let them take their time. He tells her that she is making it very hard to do. Marah asks Tony if he is backing away from her because of what she did on New Year’s Eve. He tells her to forget about it because she has apologized enough. Marah says he even saved her from being kidnapped. Tony doesn’t want her being there out of gratitude. She says Tony always says he has changed because of her, but she has changed because of him too. He goes back to the food and pulls out all kinds of snacks.\n\nThey lie down on the blanket and are talking about her parents. She asks him about his childhood. He tells her about Ray and his relatives, saying no one was on his back too much; he pretty much raised his self. She says she wishes her parents would lighten up on her. She thinks they only want a preppie who will get 1300 on his SAT’s. She says those guys don’t respect girls at all. Tony says she shouldn’t take that from anyone. Marah says college is full of guys like that. Tony says college never seemed practical to him. He just wanted to survive. Marah wants to know what he really wants out of life. Tony says before he met her, he just wanted to stay two steps ahead of the guys on the street.\n\nJosh and Olivia look around the exterior of the lighthouse and see that it is in a mess. Olivia wonders how Sam climbed it and feels bad about Marah being held there. Olivia notices the door is unlocked and Josh says he will call someone about it in the morning. Josh’s cell phone rings as they start to enter the lighthouse. He tells her that it is a business call and he has to go to the Spaulding Spires project. Olivia tells him she will stay there and takes some pictures until he gets back. She has her cell phone in case of emergency. Olivia enters the lighthouse.\n\nTony tells Marah he wanted to give her something, without just buying it. He is nervous and starts to recite the poem in Spanish. Marah is lying with her head in his lap, looking up at him. He is stroking her hair and she seems impressed with the poem. Marah pops up and kisses him. She says that was the most beautiful thing she ever heard, but she didn’t know what he said. He tells her it means she is beautiful. He starts to translate into English. Tony says she is beautiful no matter what and kisses her again. Meanwhile, Olivia is climbing the stairs and is taking pictures inside the lighthouse. Tony tells Marah they should listen to music and make conversation instead of making out. He puts some music on and they dance slowly. She reminds him she will be 18 next month. He says she is killing him but she says she knows what she wants and tonight is the perfect night. She helps take Tony’s shirt is off and they kiss passionately as Olivia discovers them. Olivia calls out to Marah, who turns to look at her. Olivia has the camera in her hand pointing right at them.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JweZJga7IY\n\nWe pick up there at another episode, I’m not sure of the date. Olivia’s finger almost unconsciously presses the button and takes a shot of them hot and heavy together. Olivia gives them a lot of mature advice. Tony and Marah give eloquent pleas for their relationship and the powerful force for good it is in their life. Olivia points out that both Josh and Reva would freak if they saw the photo. Olivia: “You would be sent off to a convent. Or a military school. Or a military convent school.” Olivia makes a deal. She’ll keep quiet if Marah calms down and asks respectful to all the adults in her life. Tony needs to find a way out of the family business.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw_RgshS63I\n\nMy Comments:\n\nThis scene makes a nice counterpoint to the one where Abuela manipulates Michelle into asking Danny for a divorce before she left for New York City. It shows that Michelle has finally recovered from the trauma last year and is strong again. Abuela does have one point right though. Michelle has always seen Danny as apart from his family. While it turns out that his relationship with his mother and grandmother were toxic because of their behavior towards him, Danny is still a part of his family and even when he finally turns his back all the way on the criminal element and cuts his mother and grandmother completely out of his life (by turning them into the feds), the traditions and memories of being a Santos will always be part of that. Michelle finally reaches a mature place in their marriage when she can accept that, but she’s not really there yet.\n\nJosh and Olivia were always best at being friends. They really were never on the same page as a romantic couple and let’s face it, she was always destined to be roadkill courtesy of Jeva. They didn’t really work as business partners either. Olivia’s work style and work ethics always did match Alan’s much better than Josh’s. Although Alan and Olivia had such a terrible beginning I don’t think anybody was rooting for them, I really think they had a better chance than any other male-female relationship they put her with during the run of the show. I honestly think though Olivia tried and wanted to be a good step-mother to Marah, as long as Marah showed absolutely no resentment towards Olivia and role she played in her parent’s divorce and continued separation.\n\nI never really cared for this crumbling lighthouse story, even though I have to admit it did work well as an umbrella that touched lots of characters. In the first place the lighthouse had just gone through a massive restoration after the Brent Lawrence storyline in the early 1990s and a further restoration in 1996. It had been fine when Manny was there in 2000. Although it’s nice that Marony can add to the list of couples with a special connection to the lighthouse.\n\nMon., Jan. 29, 2001 – At the Bauers: Michelle comes in followed by Danny, carrying all her packages. Michelle’s biggest worry is now if Danny really likes her new short haircut and assumes he will be moving back in with her. Michelle says that the baby will have everything it needs including its daddy. Danny tells her that two days together doesn’t solve all their problems. Michelle doubts Danny can walk out the door. Danny says the past couple of days were great. They were in a city where they had no history, no enemies. It was separate from reality. Michelle insists that she is not afraid of his world anymore. Danny says a few days ago, people were following her. Danny doesn’t want her and the baby to be part of his life. Michelle asks what if he can’t stop her. Michelle reminds Danny that he made love to her and she strokes his arm. He tells her he loves her and wants her but the life he leads will only hurt her and the baby. His phone rings and it is May. She tells him about Tony, asking him to get there ASAP. He tells May to call Ray and no one else. Danny tells Michelle that there is an emergency and Michelle wants to go with him. Danny says Michelle can go with him but must keep quiet about what she sees and hears. Michelle agrees and reminds him that she has kept the other Santos family secrets including the one about Carmen. At Infierno: Catalina and May hear a noise, then see Tony tumble down the stairs bleeding and unconscious. They get him into Danny’s office and try to take care of him. May tells Catalina to cover Tony with a blanket, while she gets on the phone. She calls Danny and he says he will be right there. Danny is wiping the blood of Tony’s face while trying to get him to come to. Ray, Catalina, Michelle and May are in the office too. Tony wakes up and asks, “Where is she?” Danny asks him who did this. Tony looks around and says he can’t tell him. Danny asks the ladies to leave them alone a moment. They leave and Tony tells Danny that the goons grabbed Marah. He tries to get up saying he has to find her but he can’t. He tells Danny and Ray how they were at the Lewis’ and one of the men grabbed her and the other started beating on him. Ray and Danny are concerned and Ray thinks they should call the cops. Danny thinks the only way to protect Marah is to deal with it themselves. He thinks the whole situation was a ploy to get his attention. Some of the families don’t like what he is doing and want to bargain with him. Danny says he just has to figure out how to get her back. Ray insists on calling the police and Danny finally agrees, deciding to ask Frank to be discreet. Danny asks Ray to take Tony to the hospital while he contacts Frank. Catalina goes with them while Michelle waits for Danny. Michelle asks Danny what happened. He tells her when they couldn’t get to Michelle, they snatched Marah. Michelle says the danger is not from him but from his work. Frank arrives. Danny wants him to keep this information to himself. He tells Frank about Marah’s kidnapping. He thinks he knows who did it but needs Frank to be restrained. Frank agrees as long as Danny levels with him. He says he will handle the Lewis family while Danny goes to look for Marah. He wants Frank to tell the Lewises that Marah is safe and they are trying to get her back. Frank tells Michelle he wishes she wasn’t in on this and Danny agrees. Frank leaves and Danny calls Carlos. He asks him what he knows about the situation. Danny tells Michelle he may have a lead on who has Marah. She asks what he will do. Danny says whatever it takes.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4TyyQBJh6k\n\n(This is the Manny highlight clip, when the scene cuts to the Lewis house about 1/2 way through stop and watch the links below.)\n\nTues., Jan. 30, 2001 – At Infierno: Danny is waiting for Carlos to call. Michelle is with him and says she wanted to spend time with him but didn’t expect this. Danny says that he wants her to leave as soon as someone can take her. May comes in and says Tony has some cracked ribs but will be okay. She asks if Michelle wants something to eat. Danny encourages her to go with May. They talk about Tony and May asks Michelle if it makes her crazy when she doesn’t know what is going on. Michelle says it is worse sometimes when you do know. May wonders if it was the same thugs from last week. She starts comparing it to a movie but Michelle stops her. Frank comes in and asks if Danny heard anything. Frank says Reva is very upset. Danny says Reva is a lose cannon and her being anywhere near this situation is a big problem. Frank offers to take Michelle home and then will contact his sources. Michelle doesn’t want to go but eventually agrees. Tony arrives with Ray. Michelle wonders what Tony is doing there. Tony asks Danny about Marah. Tony thinks Danny needs to hit back hard at Johnny Machado. Danny says what if it isn’t him. Tony says if it is him, he (Tony) would like to deal with him. Danny wants to handle it and tells him it will be better for Marah. Reva arrives and says she holds each of them responsible for Marah’s life and wants to know how they are going to find her daughter.\n\nWed., Jan. 31, 2001 – At the Bauers: Frank brings Michelle home. She is worried about Marah especially since Tony was badly beaten. Frank says most thugs draw the line at women and children. Michelle says she should have been the one kidnapped instead of Marah. Frank tries to cheer her and tells her she needs to think of the baby. Michelle tells Frank he can get back to work. Frank says he is staying put. Frank gets her some milk and tells her that he can do all his work from there until someone else gets there to watch her. She doesn’t think it is necessary but he tells her that someone could be out there watching her right now. Michelle is worried about Marah but Frank tells her that the guys who did this want Danny, not Marah. Michelle says the families wants Danny back on their terms, but she wants him back in hers and she won’t give in. Frank says a part of him thought she and Danny wouldn’t come back from New York. Michelle said she didn’t want to. She tells Frank that Danny is a good person, not at all like Carmen. He just believes what his mother told him about himself. Michelle wants Danny back but Danny believes the kidnapping proves they shouldn’t be together. Michelle wishes it could be just her, Danny and the baby. Frank reminds her of trying to help the FBI bring down the family a while back and says if they had succeeded then she would have her dream now. Meta returns home and is upset about the kidnapping. She asks Michelle if she knows why it happened. Michelle says she isn’t sure. She tells Meta about cooperating with the FBI. Meta tells her to take it one day at a time. Right now, Marah is the one who needs help.\n\nI’m not sure which day this is but Josh, Reva, and Olivia discover Marah is kidnapping.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YF0u_5ryEg\n\nFri., Feb. 2, 2001 – At the Santos Compound: Danny and Tony are listening to Johnny’s conversations on a scanner. Tony tries to run out when he hears something about the lighthouse. Danny tries to stop him and Ray agrees. Danny thinks he and Marah will both get shot. The only way to get Marah back alive is to keep the police and the guns out of it. The phone rings. Frank tells Danny they have a problem; Danny has been holding out on him. Danny tells Frank he knows everything Danny knows. Frank mentions the meeting with Johnny. Danny says he was planning on filling him in once he had more info. Frank asks questions about Marah and is not buying Danny’s story. Frank is threatening a SWAT team and tells Danny he can’t promise him anything unless Danny tells Frank everything. Frank wants 45 minutes notice to get the police in place. Danny tells Ray and Tony that Frank knows about the meeting. Danny decides to get Marah out first before the meeting and the police arrive. Tony says he knows how they can get Marah out. He tells them about Sam scaling the lighthouse to come in from the top and Danny calls him.\n\nSam arrives at the Santos house. He tells Tony this was bound to happen to Marah and wonders why he couldn’t leave her alone. Tony and Sam are yell at each other and Ray and Danny break it up and get to the point. Danny asks Sam if he can climb the lighthouse. Sam says he can and asks if that is where Marah is being held. He asks why they don’t call the police. Danny says it will make things worse. He explains that they have to get Marah out of the lighthouse by 11 PM. He asks if Sam can get her out without being seen. Tony wants to come but Sam says he has to do it alone. Ray reminds Tony of his broken ribs. Danny says the guys have to put aside their differences or the plan is off. They both agree.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-HtwzCvprw\n\nTues., Feb. 6, 2001 – At the Lighthouse Marah is sitting blindfolded and tied. She is talking to the goon who is watching her and tells him she must be very intimidating to them to be kept tied up. She complains about having to go to the bathroom, being dehydrated and then of some pains she has. She begged the guy to untie her for only a moment. The guy comes over and says he would rather put duct tape on her mouth. Marah says her boyfriend will save her but the goon says with her mouth her boyfriend may have decided she isn’t worth it. Meta comes down and offers Michelle some chamomile tea to help her sleep. Michelle won’t sleep until she hears from Danny or Frank. She trusts Danny to rescue Marah. Meta says it will take more than chamomile tea to calm her while working with Claire. Michelle thinks Meta is formidable and will hold her own. Michelle says she is also stronger than she looks and will use that strength to help Danny. On the observation deck the goon is surprised when Sam comes over and starts talking about the stars. The guy wonders how Sam got up to the top of the lighthouse. Sam starts telling him about free climbing and how great it is except when it is freezing and the mortar cracks. Sam keeps the guy distracted while Tony climbs the rope. The guy pulls a gun on Sam and Sam asks him what his problem is. He just wanted to look at the stars and somebody pulls a gun on him. Tony sneaks up over the railing and behind the guy and taps him on the shoulder. When the guy turns, Tony knocks him out. Sam starts tying the guy’s hands behind him as Danny and Ray climb up the rope. Tony tells them that they got one of the men and there should only be one more. Danny tells him not to get overconfident. Tony and Sam are ready to go on to part two of their plan. Ray huddles them all together and they pray for the safety of Marah and themselves. Marah is still complaining as Danny, Tony, Sam and Ray arrive outside the door where she is being held. Danny’s cell phone rings and the guard goes out to check. Marah screams as she hears a shot. Tony comes in and unties Marah and she tells him she knew he would come. She was afraid he was shot. She thinks he is amazing but Tony admits Sam is the one who did the climbing. She thanks both of them. Sam thought they were toast when Danny’s phone rang. Danny says it was the cops. Danny returns Frank’s call and tells him he will bring Marah and Sam home. Frank says he will be waiting. Danny and Ray tell them that they all are going to the Lewis house.\n\nThe Santos’ and Sam come in with Marah. Reva is hugging her. Frank confronts Danny and wants details. Danny tells them how Sam and Tony staged the rescue. Marah stands up for them saying they were hero’s but Josh says Tony is the reason that Marah was kidnapped in the first place. Ray says he is proud of Tony but Josh says he has had enough of the Santos family. They get ready to leave and Marah tells Tony that she will never forget what he did. Sam tries to stand up for Tony and Danny, but Reva and Josh start in on him working with the mob instead of the police. Sam says Danny’s plan worked and he is glad he could help. Reva says, “If you were my kid…” Olivia stops her and Josh suggests she take Sam home. Noah tries to make peace. Marah apologizes for ruining another honeymoon. Josh and Olivia are going to go home and Marah thanks Sam again. Josh hugs Marah. Josh gives the keys to Sam to go to the car. Olivia asks him if he understands why she withheld information. Josh tells her that he is angry.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwtGWDiXNyw\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYZOQ1my2M4\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSURWEE4Cuc\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4Y71HUQg_8\n\nJosh: “You blindly put your trust in Danny Santos.” Sam: “Not blindly, Tony and Danny explained their plan to me and it made sense…it seemed like the best chance to save Marah, and guess what? It worked!” (Trusting Danny, what Josh should have done.)\n\nNOTE: Most of this is a from a channel that mainly hosts a highlight reel from someone interested in Josh and Olivia and Reva, not Manny or Marony so these are definitely not the bits I’d have highlighted, but it’s much more than is in the Manny highlights and the scenes were they recruit Sam and when they decide who is going first are are worth watching them all. I did have to make kind of a rough stab on some of these though because I hadn’t though some of the bits included (Josh and Olivia finding out, for instance) worth including in my descriptions so some of the dates maybe even more approximate than is usual with highlight reels.\n\nMy Comments: Jeva already disapproved of Marony, but this kidnapping made them worse than ever. Personally, I think subconsciously Jeva individually see themselves in Marah and Tony and want her to take a safer path.\n\nSam is such an idiot here going after Tony. Involving Sam’s climbing skills was a good plan though and a nice bit of introduction with the writers. Sam’s first appearance on the show, was when he climbed up and surprised Susan/Daisy in the lighthouse back when the show was chemistry testing them.\n\nActually this is about the last solid story Sam ever had although he stuck around town for awhile after and even recurred as support when Olivia needed him. So you can see the lighthouse from the window of Olivia’s apartment? Interesting. Have they reverted to the 1970s black and white striped, brick lighthouse? Josh, since when did Reva ever UNDERSTAND and do NOTHING? Nice bit about Josh not forgiving Reva for keeping it from him when Olivia is. Tony & Sam could have been good friends.\n\nNice Santos family conversation at the foot of the tower while Sam climbs the second time. Reva, Danny has saved your life twice, how about a little gratitude. Josh doesn’t know Dr. Noah is still a spy. I like that Reva figured out Olivia knew more. The top of the lighthouse is still stucco. I wouldn’t have told Jeva either. Half-Cocked is both their middle names.\n\nNormally in a Reva-Olivia fight I’m on Reva’s side, but I’m totally team Olivia here. See I’d have written Sam & Tony as friends from this point on, it would have really provided some balance and spread connections across the canvas. Danny didn’t silence the phone? That really was nice of Tony to give Sam credit. More reason they should be friends. Can’t believe Danny didn’t silence the phones first.\n\nJosh, Danny has saved your life and Reva’s life twice now. How about a little gratitude? Boy, normally I like a good step-parent back off, but if the question is actually protection I think becoming a step-parent makes you responsible. So I’m Team Olivia again."
