        "text": "by Susan Morse\n\nSoap Opera Digest\n\nJuly 1, 1986\n\n1. Jarrod Ross (1977-1981)\n\nJust after GL expanded to one hour, the writers introduced the very popular Spauldings: Alan, his wife Elizabeth and their young son Phillip. Elizabeth's best friend, Jackie Marler, was also brought on and, unknown to Elizabeth, she was Phillip's natural mother. Jackie fell for Mike Bauer, but Mike fell for Elizabeth. When Elizabeth divorced Alan, Jackie married him (even though she wasn't in love) to be closer to Phillip. Eventually, Alan left Jackie, who went on to remarry Dr. Justin Marler (her ex) -- Phillip's real father. During this time, Phillip was an extremely confused youngster.\n\n2. Grant Aleksander (1982-1984)\n\nPhillip underwent a drastic change in appearance in 1982. He was now being played by dashing Grant Aleksander and was a student at Springfield University. At the same time, other teens (Rick Bauer, Mindy Lewis, Beth Raines, Lujack) were brought on the show and because of this, some very exciting and popular stories were born. Phillip faced the usual heartache with his girlfriend Beth and viewers longed for them to get together. They never did [for very long]. Just before Aleksander's departure, a hurt Phillip fell for mysterious newcomer, India von Halkein.\n\n3. John Bolger (1985-1986)\n\nBolger has had the difficult task of living up to his predecessor, who viewers adored. But Bolger has held his own through all of Phillip's trials and tribulations with India and the character has emerged as a savvy corporate executive at Spaulding Enterprises. New love and good times are on his horizon."
