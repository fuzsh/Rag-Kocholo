Whether you like it or loathe it, Durham Bus Station has been welcoming people from far and wide for more than 100 years.

The site on North Road has been serving thousands each week as buses pull in from Teesside, Darlington, Tyne & Wear and the rest of the county.

Served mainly by Go North East and Arriva North East, it remains one of the main ways the city welcomes workers, residents and tourists.
