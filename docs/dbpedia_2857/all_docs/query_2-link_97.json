        "text": "I have a little confession to make: I‚Äôve been dying to write this Flixbus review for years. In fact, I‚Äôve had a little ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù file on my phone compiling anecdotes and facts specifically for this occasion.\n\n‚Ä¶ and the day has come.\n\nI‚Äôve relied on Flixbus as my handsome steed literally dozens of times in the past three years, and after a particularly interesting ride (I‚Äôll explain this later), I felt inspired to finally sit down and write an honest Flixbus review that holds nooothing back.\n\nIn other words: this one‚Äôs definitely #NotSponsored, my friends.\n\nI hope you enjoy your reviews with a dash of salt and sass (AKA what I would name my food blog, tbh).\n\nSave this post for later on Pinterest:\n\nClick here to find the latest deals for Flixbus\n\nTIP: If you are open to options other than Flixbus, I always use Omio to compare/book transport options in Europe. Sometimes trains or flights are cheaper, and this site compares them all at once and sorts them by price, convenience, etc. HotelsCombined offers a similar price check for hotels if you‚Äôre still needing a place to stay üôÇ\n\nFlixbus: A Quick Introduction\n\nNow, to quickly catch you up to speed, Flixbus is a budget bus travel company that has routes all around Europe.\n\nKnown for its ridiculously low fares (think 5 euros one way if you book early enough), its lime green coaches are a ubiquitous sight all around the continent, touting budget-conscious travellers who often look dead in the eyes as they ponder the all too common question ‚Äúwas this worth it?‚Äù\n\nAnd to help you answer that question, I bring you my very honest Flixbus review.\n\nI‚Äôll start first with a quick summary of pros and cons, then dive into some seriously important Flixbus info you need to survive your trip. OH, and if you find this review helpful at all,\n\nI‚Äôd super appreciate if you clicked here and purchased from my affiliate link. It comes at no extra cost to you, but earns me a bit of commission. Thank you, and enjoy\n\nPS: Since writing this review, Flixbus has launched new routes in the US! I have no experience riding with Flixbus in the US, but you are free to browse through the comments as several people have left their own experiences there. The following post though is strictly a Flixbus Europe review.\n\nMy Flixbus Review of Pros and Cons\n\nHaving read my fair share of horrible Flixbus reviews, I need to say that overall, Flixbus really is fine.\n\nLike really, it does what it says it does. It gets you to where you need to go for a dirt cheap price, and their booking process is delightfully straightforward. When you think about how affordably you‚Äôre able to travel thanks to them, you realize they do provide epic value for money.\n\nThat said, as with all things, you get what you pay for. Don‚Äôt hop on a Flixbus expecting razor sharp punctuality, luxurious digs or glowing customer service.\n\nReally, don‚Äôt expect anything more than just a place to put your butt for a few hours as you try to ignore your neighbour‚Äôs aggressive mouth breathing.\n\nIn my opinion, Flixbus makes sense if it‚Äôs substantially cheaper than any other alternative (e.g. trains, flights, etc.). This is usually the case if you book early enough (although keep in mind that last minute fares can be comparable to the price of a train or flight).\n\nIn addition to that, I‚Äôd say Flixbus is a decent option if you‚Äôre a relatively carefree traveller. This means no hissy fits if your bus is late or when your driver has the warmth of a walk-in freezer.\n\nOdds are you‚Äôll have to endure some ‚Äòmeh‚Äô customer service and do some waiting, maybe even on a random curb somewhere in the rain, so just have your expectations in check.\n\nA quick summary of my Flixbus review pros/cons.\n\nImportant Flixbus Info You Need for Surviving Your Trip\n\nI‚Äôll end off this Flixbus review with some really important considerations you need to make before your trip. Think of all this Flixbus info as essential survival tips. Please tattoo them on your thigh or something.\n\n1. Seriously, don‚Äôt use Flixbus if you need to be somewhere at a certain time ‚Äì Flixbus delays are REAL\n\nPunctuality is probably one of the biggest weaknesses of Flixbus.\n\nI can‚Äôt stress this enough: if you have to be somewhere (e.g. to catch some kind of connection, job interview, important meeting, hot Tinder date, whatever it is), you shouldn‚Äôt rely on Flixbus to get you there in time.\n\nAs a serial victim of Flixbus delays, I have to tell you: SO much can happen! You can get stuck in traffic and be delayed by 2 hours (happened to me en route to the Nuremburg airport), you can get hit with randomly terrible weather (happened to me too many times to count) and if you‚Äôre lucky, the bus may even spontaneously break down (happened to a friend of mine).\n\nWith Flixbus, you should always assume that it‚Äôll run late. If you have something important to catch, consider catching an earlier bus or simply using a different transportation alternative.\n\n2. Book as far in advance as possible\n\nPurchasing Flixbus seats is always cheaper the earlier you book.\n\nIf you want to get the best deal, hop on early.\n\nThe good news is, Flixbus is really flexible with cancellations and modifications. A few years ago, these were always free to make up until 15 minutes before the trip. I call these the glory days! Sadly this flexibility is no more because the Flixbus system now makes you pay more the closer to the departure you cancel.\n\nStill, the fee isn‚Äôt more than 5 euros, so I would suggest buying tickets as early as possible and then getting a refund/modifying the ticket later if needed.\n\nClick here to browse deals now\n\n3. Overnight buses are almost always a terrible idea.\n\nThis may come as a severe shock, but Flixbus seats aren‚Äôt actually built for a good night‚Äôs sleep.\n\n*gasp*\n\nAnd I totally get why you want to believe in overnight buses, because you really do save buckets of money! Not only are the tickets are cheaper, you get more time to explore the next morning and to boot ‚Äì you don‚Äôt even need to pay for a hotel room.\n\nI mean, if you listen closely, you might hear all the budget travellers peeing their pants in excitement.\n\nThis is all dandy until you realize you get no good sleep at all, and arrive at your dream destination with panda eyes and a thirst for ten Red Bulls. Trust me guys, it‚Äôs not worth it!\n\nIf there‚Äôs one thing you take away from this Flixbus review, let it be that overnight buses are the devil, and should be avoided at all costs.\n\n4. The early bird gets the least crappy seat\n\nHonestly, the Flixbus boarding process is like the Hunger Games. All semblance of a line dissipates as soon as the little driver in the lime green jacket emerges.\n\n‚Ä¶ and people will hound him like he‚Äôs Channing Tatum dipped in sugar.\n\nIt really pays to get there early though.\n\nWhile Flixbus tells you to be there 15 minutes before departure time, I always go earlier.\n\nIt might seem paranoid, but being near the front of the line is crucial if you want any chance of sitting with your travel companions, or at least score a window seat away from the bathroom.\n\nTrust me, don‚Äôt run in there last minute or you‚Äôll be awkwardly shuffling through the crowded bus, meekly asking people to move their bags. You‚Äôll get some of the most severe side-eye of your life, guaranteed.\n\nFLIXBUS REVIEW BONUS TIP: When you get there early, make sure you stand either by the front door (if you‚Äôre doing hand luggage only) or by the Flixbus luggage storage area (if you need to check a bag). You‚Äôll be required to check any bags first before you board, so don‚Äôt accidentally stand in the wrong line-up‚Ä¶ or you‚Äôll end up in that coveted seat next to the famous Flixbus toilet üòâ\n\n5. Expect grumpy customer service\n\nThis Flixbus review wouldn‚Äôt be complete without a shoutout to that classic Flixbus customer service.\n\nHonestly, I imagine that job interviews for Flixbus drivers goes something like:\n\nInterviewer: Does human contact irritate you? Also, are you good at mumbling?\n\nDriver: *grunts*\n\nInterviewer: You‚Äôre hired!\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì obviously not ALL Flixbus drivers are grumpy, but service in my experience has rarely been friendly or warm.\n\nThe truth is: you and your driver will probably not become Flixbus Besties, he probably won‚Äôt be thrilled to answer any additional questions you have and no, he won‚Äôt be cracking any jokes or flashing toothy grins your way.\n\nThat said, you paid like, 10 euros for your seat, sooo, at least you have that going for you.\n\nOn a similar note though, for my fellow English speakers, it‚Äôs important that you remember the following‚Ä¶..\n\n6. Don‚Äôt expect service to be in English\n\nYou really need to prepare yourself well for your Flixbus rides. Know exactly where you‚Äôre going, have the destination loaded up on Google Maps, have your passport ready, etc. because odds are, you won‚Äôt hear a word of English throughout the ride.\n\nThe drivers rarely speak English, and even when they do, they don‚Äôt typically make the on-board announcements in English, which means you‚Äôll potentially miss a lot of things like what stop they‚Äôre at, how long the breaks are, etc.\n\nEspecially if your stop isn‚Äôt the final stop, make sure you have a rough idea of how long it‚Äôll take to get there, then hop on Google Maps from time to time to ensure you don‚Äôt miss your stop.\n\n7. Want to hear a joke? Flixbus WiFi\n\nOkay, but actually‚Ä¶\n\nYou need to know this: Flixbus Wifi is NOT great.\n\nOf course it depends on the route, but sometimes it just will not work at all.\n\nAnd even when the WiFi magically works, there‚Äôs a cap on usage so you‚Äôll usually max out within an hour or so (or like, 5 minutes if you watch too many cat videos on Facebook).\n\nSO, no matter what, don‚Äôt count on the WiFi. especially on busier buses where there‚Äôs many people trying to leech off it at once.\n\nFLIXBUS REVIEW BONUS TIP: Have everything you need for your arrival (e.g. check-in confirmations, address of your hotel/hostel, etc.) loaded and ready for offline use, just in case the WiFi fails you.\n\n8. Expect some blind, shelterless waiting\n\nWith plane travel, you have airports.\n\nWith train travel, you have train stations.\n\nWith Flixbus, you have‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. the curb.\n\nJust kidding. Kind of.\n\nObviously this all depends on your departure point. In Munich, we are very lucky in that Flixbuses come in and out of the main bus station, which has an undercover area so we‚Äôre protected from rain and snow.\n\nThe same can‚Äôt be said in many other cities (especially small ones) where Flixbus pickup points are just random spots marked with a sign (sometimes not even).\n\nSO, remember to bring an umbrella and bundle up warm. In the case of delays, you‚Äôll often be left waiting outside for an indefinite amount of time.\n\nFLIXBUS REVIEW BONUS TIP:\n\nLiterally, this sounds like a joke, but sometimes your bus MIGHT NOT EVEN BE A FLIXBUS. I‚Äôm not joking. This is the aforementioned experience that inspired me to finally write this review.\n\nLast week, my Flixbus was running 45 minutes late, and I was beginning to worry because it didn‚Äôt show up on the bus board whereas other delayed buses had. I managed to scramble and ask the customer service folks, who promptly pointed me to the (unmarked) Bay 24 and said that it was a white bus, and that the driver was already loading.\n\nI looked around, thinking he was mistaken‚Ä¶ I thought Flixbuses were always green.\n\nPanicked, I went up to the sketchy white bus, showed the driver my ticket, and he let me on. It was weird‚Ä¶. and definitely not a Flixbus. And there was no signage to indicate it was where I intended to go.\n\nIn other words, if I hadn‚Äôt asked, there would have been no way for me to know. Sooooo, if you‚Äôre ever lost and confused, make sure to ask someone. Better safe than sorry.\n\nPS: Yes while Flixbus does alert you of delays (they send emails/text messages), these aren‚Äôt always 100% accurate and there‚Äôs still loads of blind waiting that happens.\n\nFor instance, in the above scenario, I got one email in German stating the 45 minute delay, about 1 hour before my departure time.\n\nI then got one email in English stating the delay again‚Ä¶.. but this time I received it while I was already on the bus? That wouldn‚Äôt have been too helpful. Anyways, be warned!\n\n9. And the Flixbus interior? Well, it‚Äôs definitely not the Ritz\n\nThe Flixbus experience isn‚Äôt meant to be a crazy luxurious one, but overall, the buses are clean and comfortable enough.\n\nThat said, at 5‚Äô3‚Ä≥, I‚Äôm a relatively little thang, so I‚Äôve never struggled with legroom for my stumps, but taller folks might struggle more (certainly on longer rides when the urge to manspread is real).\n\nFlixbus seats do recline a fair bit, but they are super invasive for the person behind you. That said, it does go both ways, so expect your frontsies-neighbour to recline and leave you no space to breathe as well!\n\nFLIXBUS REVIEW BONUS TIP: While some routes seem to advertise snacks/drinks available for purchase on board, I‚Äôve honestly never encountered this in real life (and based on reviews I‚Äôve read, they often don‚Äôt deliver on this promise), so don‚Äôt bank on it, and try to bring your own refreshments. At least a bottle of water!\n\n10. Flixbus luggage is a free for all‚Ä¶. But you still need to follow the rules\n\nI get a really good laugh out of the Flixbus luggage system, where they‚Äôll literally chuck your bags out on the street at the end of the journey, yet get Hulk-level angry when you try to bring anything kinda big onto the bus.\n\nSo, while they don‚Äôt seem to care all that much about security, they can be weirdly stern about bag sizing, so keep in mind what your allowance is.\n\nFLIXBUS REVIEW BONUS TIP:\n\nI highly recommend you travel as much as much as possible with a small bag that you can bring on board with you, because security isn‚Äôt the best.\n\nI‚Äôve only been on one bus ever where they‚Äôve tagged the luggage and had you trade in tickets to get your bag.\n\nEvery other time, it has been a total free for all, which means the luggage doors are left wide open while the bus is loading (i.e. any random could just come up and take your things) and also all the bags are just unloaded onto the street at the end of the journey (i.e. again, any random could just come up and take your things!!)\n\nI‚Äôve luckily never had theft happen to me while using Flixbus, but I have heard horror stories of Flixbus stolen luggage so please be vigilant!\n\nA few tips for surviving Flixbus luggage:\n\nTag your bags and try to put some kind of unique identifier on it. Since luggage at the end of the trip is such a free for all, having a unique thing on your bag might help prevent anyone taking your stuff by accident.\n\nDon‚Äôt bring anything over the Flixbus luggage size limit, or be prepared to pay up (in cash).\n\nBring some cash with you in the off-chance that you do need to pay those dreaded Flixbus baggage fees.\n\nI saw a girl struggle so hard once because her bag was a little bit oversized, and they wouldn‚Äôt accept any cards to pay the difference. The bus driver straight up threatened to leave her there if she didn‚Äôt find an ATM!\n\n13. The drivers will wait for NO ONE\n\nThis kinda goes back to #5, with the whole customer service thing... but yeah, Flixbus drivers don't usually care if you're being left behind.\n\nSometimes they'll half-heartedly count passengers before leaving a rest stop, but often they do not. They also do not care for latecomers.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nOnce upon a time, I was on a bus that was literally stuck in the bus station queue of vehicles waiting to leave. In other words, we were still at the station, and weren't going anywhere anytime soon. This frantic guy then showed up, relieved to see the bus was still around, and kept tapping at the door, suitcase in hand, begging the driver to let him on.\n\nThe bus driver stared at him, almost drinking in the suspense before ultimately deciding that he was not worthy. Some friends of mine also reported an instance of two friends being left behind at a rest stop, with their passports and get this: their SHOES still on the bus.\n\nKinda asking for it though - I mean leaving the bus shoeless? Come on.\n\nSooooo, FLIXBUS REVIEW BONUS TIP: don't ever be late!\n\n14. Only sit by the bathroom is you want to die\n\nThis is the ultimate Flixbus review bonus tip...\n\nThere are few woes worse than the horror of near-bathroom Flixbus seats. Trust me. This is not something you want in your life. Unless you want your Flixbus experience to literally go to shit.\n\nThe smell is the worst. Just avoid, avoid.\n\nLAST BUT NOT LEAST: Don‚Äôt forget to bring a passport and your ticket\n\nThis is so important! If you're travelling internationally, it doesn't matter if you're going through countries like Schengen where passports aren't typically checked, they'll still want one from you.\n\nThe bus driver will always ask for it, and I have been checked many times going through Schengen countries (e.g. from Austria to Germany for instance).\n\nAlways have your passport when you travel with Flixbus! And a copy of your ticket too (whether on your phone or printed out).\n\nAt the end of the day, my Flixbus review can be summed up in a few key words: it gets the job done, but not glamorously.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this honest Flixbus review!\n\nAgain, this post was not sponsored in any way, I just wanted to share my personal Flixbus experience after having used their service so many times in the past few years.\n\nI hope that you're know better equipped with the Flixbus info you're looking for. If not, feel free to ask away in the comments! If you've decided after this review that Flixbus isn't for you, I highly recommend using Omio to compare your other options. It's a free and super helpful website that shows you all the different transport possibilities (from trains and planes to flights)."
