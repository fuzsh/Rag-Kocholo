Lift access available to the subway from both platforms. Durham has two RNIB 'Maps for All' - one is located on the southbound side inside the portico as you approach the Travel Centre. The second is located on the northbound side to the left of the waiting room entrance doors beside the taxi rank.\n\nStaff can deploy station ramps at all times when trains are operating through this station to help customers who need step-free access board any train at this station. Where in circumstances beyond our control station staff are not available, on train staff can deploy the on board ramp if necessary.\n\nWe want everyone to travel with confidence.
