        "text": "Robbinsdale Area Schools (Rdale) is entering the third year of its opt-in transportation system. All families with students enrolled in Rdale schools must fill out the bus transportation survey for the 2024-25 school year. The survey must be completed for each student by Monday, May 20.\n\nTo fill out the survey, families must log-in to their Infinite Campus Parent Portal account. For those who haven’t accessed their Parent Portal account before, Rdale has video tutorials demonstrating how to log into the Infinite Campus Parent Portal from a phone or from a computer. Families can also contact district support staff with questions about accessing the Parent Portal at registrar@rdale.org.\n\nThe opt-in survey is an annual requirement for all students – both those who need bus transportation, and those who do not, as well as those who receive specialized transportation. Completing one for the current school year doesn’t apply to the upcoming school year.\n\nEven though the opt-in program requires all families to complete a survey annually for each student, it is important to note that every student who is eligible for and needs busing will have transportation to and from school.\n\nIf your situation changes, families will be able to make changes to the opt-in form at any time by contacting our Transportation Department at Transportation@rdale.org.\n\nRobbinsdale Area Schools transportation and bus provider, Durham School Services, have a new mobile app for families: BusZone.\n\nThis will replace the Bus Tracker app that families have been using. BusZone has enhanced features that allow parents/guardians to safely and securely check on their child’s school bus. (Check out the BusZone Info Flyer, also available in Spanish) To set up BusZone:\n\nDownload the BusZone app from the App Store or Google Play.\n\nEnter the School Access Code: 3103SD281\n\nIn the search field, enter the bus or route number you want to follow. Complete this step for all the buses your students ride throughout the week.\n\nEnter your child’s unique student ID. This is the same ID you used in ParentPortal.\n\nCreate alert zones around drop-off and pick-up points.\n\nWhen your child’s bus enters an alert zone, you will receive a notification by email or text.\n\nVisit the BusZone website to read or download a guide for parents/guardians, also available in Spanish. Robbinsdale Area Schools is not responsible for the functions or content of BusZone. Please email buszone3103@nellc.com if you have questions about the BusZone app.\n\nFamilies are encouraged to remove the previous Durham Bus Tracker app as it no longer displays active information.\n\nRobbinsdale Area Schools strives to accommodate as many bus riders as possible. Bus transportation is provided for students who live within our district's boundaries.\n\nStudents who open enroll into Robbinsdale Area Schools may request bus transportation using this form. After this form has been submitted, we will look for an active bus route that has room for additional students. The transportation department will process these requests after Oct. 1.\n\nPlease note it could take up to 14 days to process these requests. We may not be able to accommodate all bus transportation requests for families who live outside of school district boundaries.\n\nClosest Bus Stop Request Form"
