        "text": "Philadelphia, NY – Durham School Services and the Indian River Central School District are excited to announce their new five-year partnership, which starts this fall and will run through 2029. This new partnership is a major milestone, given that the Indian River Central School District is the largest school district by area in the North Country. In addition to Durham’s growth in the North Country, Durham also recently announced two other new partnerships in the East Coast – City School District of Albany in New York and the Columbia Borough School District in Pennsylvania.\n\nAlbany, NY – Starting this fall, Durham School Services (DSS), a leader in student transportation, will begin providing transportation for the City School District of Albany’s students. Durham School Services currently serves 12 communities in New York and is excited to start its new partnership with the City School District of Albany. This new partnership is a significant development coming off the heels of another new East Coast partnership announced by Durham in late June with the Columbia Borough School District in Pennsylvania."
