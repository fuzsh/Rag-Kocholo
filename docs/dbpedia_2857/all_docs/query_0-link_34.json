        "text": "Update: June 20, 2024\n\nGoDurham will continue providing fare free service through June 30, 2025. The City of Durham approved its proposed budget for the next fiscal year, including support for transportation.\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nDuke’s participation in the GoPass program is on pause as GoDurham and GoTriangle undergo an adjustment of their fare structures.\n\nAs of July 1, 2024, GoTriangle, the regional bus service covering Durham, Orange and Wake counties, will end its fare-free ridership program. However, users who sign up for GoTriangle’s fare payment app, Umo, can continue to ride for free through July 31, 2024.\n\nThe Durham City Council is expected to decide this month whether GoDurham buses, which serve Durham, will remain fare-free for 2024-25.\n\nAs part of Duke’s alternative transportation resources, the GoPass program offered all eligible Duke students, staff and faculty users unlimited rides on GoDurham, GoTriangle and GoRaleigh buses."
