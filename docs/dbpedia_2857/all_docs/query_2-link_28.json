        "text": "TransLoc, a leading provider of transportation technology, along with partners GoTriangle and Uber launched a pilot of TransLoc Rider with Uber in Durham on Thursday, March 3, 2016. The Rider mobile app helps people get to and from the bus stop with ease to make transit more accessible. “Durham is a growing leader in innovation and entrepreneurship,” said Mayor Bell. “It is exciting to see technology developed in Durham change how we get around our community and communities throughout the country.”TransLoc and GoTriangle kicked off the pilot in true Durham style with the help of Durham’s Mayor William V. Bell, chair of the GoTriangle’s Board of Trustees, and Wool E. Bull, the Durham Bulls beloved mascot. Local indie label, Merge Records provided a custom playlist for the event, the first in an ongoing series of TransLoc Rider Tunes. “We are excited to be launching this partnership in our own backyard with our valued partners GoTriangle and Uber,” said Doug Kaufman, TransLoc CEO. “This is a game-changing solution to the first-mile/last-mile problem and a big step toward making multi-modal travel the norm.” “As a company devoted to innovation, Uber believes that integrating with TransLoc is a positive step towards providing safe and reliable rides for all at the touch of a button,” said Raj Naik, general manager Uber North Carolina. “It will help more commuters and users of public transportation bridge the first- and last-mile gaps in their routes.\" TransLoc is recruiting beta testers for the GoTriangle pilot and will launch a second pilot in Memphis on March 22nd, 2016 with the Memphis Area Transit Authority.
