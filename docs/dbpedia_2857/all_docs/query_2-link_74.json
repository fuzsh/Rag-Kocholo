The transit agency says that's too much.\n\nrichmondtransitnetwork.com\n\nlikely this is deserving of a separate entry.\n\nAt 8:20 AM, said...\n\nat a more granular level in DC, if you want to make buses cool:\n\n1. Get rid of of the homeless people. Tired of urination and other bodily stuff on seats.\n\n2. Rationalize the lines. There is a lot to unbundle there, but the majority of DC bus lines don't make sense -- and don't work for middle class commuters.\n\n3. Fix the AC and suspensions.\n\nWas in Cleveland, and got to see an actual working bus signal -- and clearly the one we have on 16th is not turned on yet.\n\nThe nextbus/GPS systems probably did the most to drive bus ridership.\n\nBig tension between cool and equitable. The best way to be equitable is having functioning public services.\n\nAt 3:54 PM, Richard Layman said...\n\nis it the suspensions?\n\nI can't read on buses in the DC area, it upsets my stomach/eyes.\n\nBut I was able to read on MTA buses going up and down Greenmount Ave./York Road in Baltimore City/County.\n\n2. Re: Big tension between cool and equitable. The best way to be equitable is having functioning public services.\n\nyes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,\n\nyes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,\n\nyes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n3. wrt rationalization, I'd argue the system is sort of rationalized, but not branded and operated as such.\n\nYou have the trunkline routes--X2, 70, S, 30, 50, 90.\n\nThen you have lines that run through neighborhoods that typically run between Metrorail stations. Some are direct and some more meandering.\n\nBut the trunkline services aren't branded and marketed as trunkline services, what the more enlightened systems call \"the hi/high frequency transit network\".\n\nI would probably re-articulate some of the neighborhood to be less meandering and complement that with the \"intra-neighborhood\" services I constantly hype.\n\nMinneapolis Hifreq map\n\nhttps://www.metrotransit.org/high-frequency-network-map\n\nhttp://nmotion2015.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/nMotion-Frequent-Transit-Network-150710_FINAL.pdf\n\nAt 6:42 PM, Richard Layman said...\n\nMinneapolis Metro Transit Call Center\n\nhttps://www.minnpost.com/line/2017/01/smart-transportation-tools-how-metro-transit-uses-technology-ensure-smooth-ride\n\nAt 10:03 AM, Richard Layman said...\n\narticle about CityMapper, the integrated transit/mobility trip mapping app:\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-26/the-guy-making-public-transit-smarter\n\nAt 8:28 AM, Unknown said...\n\nSyracuse to NYC and Philadelphia To DC you get cheap bus tickets and Lowest Price.
