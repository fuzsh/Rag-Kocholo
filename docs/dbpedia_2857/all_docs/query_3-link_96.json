        "text": "Even though we advise against exploiting this deduction, we do want you to understand how to leverage the process to save on your taxes, and get some R&R while youâre at it.\n\nFollow the steps in this guide to exactly what qualifies as a travel expense, and how to not cross the line.\n\nThe travel needs to qualify as a âbusiness tripâ\n\nUnfortunately, you canât just jump on the next plane to the Bahamas and write the trip off as one giant business expense. To write off travel expenses, the IRS requires that the primary purpose of the trip needs to be for business purposes.\n\nHereâs how to make sure your travel qualifies as a business trip.\n\n1. You need to leave your tax home\n\nYour tax home is the locale where your business is based. Traveling for work isnât technically a âbusiness tripâ until you leave your tax home for longer than a normal work day, with the intention of doing business in another location.\n\n2. Your trip must consist âmostlyâ of business\n\nThe IRS measures your time away in days. For a getaway to qualify as a business trip, you need to spend the majority of your trip doing business.\n\nFor example, say you go away for a week (seven days). You spend five days meeting with clients, and a couple of days lounging on the beach. That qualifies as business trip.\n\nBut if you spend three days meeting with clients, and four days on the beach? Thatâs a vacation. Luckily, the days that you travel to and from your location are counted as work days.\n\n3. The trip needs to be an âordinary and necessaryâ expense\n\nâOrdinary and necessaryâ is a term used by the IRS to designate expenses that are âordinaryâ for a business, given the industry itâs in, and ânecessaryâ for the sake of carrying out business activities.\n\nIf there are two virtually identical conferences taking placeâone in Honolulu, the other in your hometownâyou canât write off an all-expense-paid trip to Hawaii.\n\nLikewise, if you need to rent a car to get around, youâll have trouble writing off the cost of a Range Rover if a Toyota Camry will get you there just as fast.\n\nWhat qualifies as âordinary and necessaryâ can seem like a gray area at times, and you may be tempted to fudge it. Our advice: err on the side of caution. if the IRS chooses to investigate and discovers youâve claimed an expense that wasnât necessary for conducting business, you could face serious penalties.\n\n4. You need to plan the trip in advance\n\nYou canât show up at Universal Studios, hand out business cards to everyone you meet in line for the roller coaster, call it ânetworking,â and deduct the cost of the trip from your taxes. A business trip needs to be planned in advance.\n\nBefore your trip, plan where youâll be each day, when, and outline who youâll spend it with. Document your plans in writing before you leave. If possible, email a copy to someone so it gets a timestamp. This helps prove that there was professional intent behind your trip.\n\nThe rules are different when you travel outside the United States\n\nBusiness travel rules are slightly relaxed when you travel abroad.\n\nIf you travel outside the USA for more than a week (seven consecutive days, not counting the day you depart the United States):\n\nYou must spend at least 75% of your time outside of the country conducting business for the entire getaway to qualify as a business trip.\n\nIf you travel outside the USA for more than a week, but spend less than 75% of your time doing business, you can still deduct travel costs proportional to how much time you do spend working during the trip.\n\nFor example, say you go on an eight-day international trip. If you spend at least six days conducting business, you can deduct the entire cost of the trip as a business expenseâbecause 6 is equivalent to 75% of your time away, which, remember, is the minimum you must spend on business in order for the entire trip to qualify as a deductible business expense.\n\nBut if you only spend four days out of the eight-day trip conducting businessâor just 50% of your time awayâyou would only be able to deduct 50% of the cost of your travel expenses, because the trip no longer qualifies as entirely for business.\n\nList of travel expenses\n\nHere are some examples of business travel deductions you can claim:\n\nPlane, train, and bus tickets between your home and your business destination\n\nBaggage fees\n\nLaundry and dry cleaning during your trip\n\nRental car costs\n\nHotel and Airbnb costs\n\n50% of eligible business meals\n\n50% of meals while traveling to and from your destination\n\nTravel\n\nOn a business trip, you can deduct 100% of the cost of travel to your destination, whether thatâs a plane, train, or bus ticket. If you rent a car to get there, and to get around, that cost is deductible, too.\n\nLodging\n\nThe cost of your lodging is tax deductible. You can also potentially deduct the cost of lodging on the days when youâre not conducting business, but it depends on how you schedule your trip. The trick is to wedge âvacation daysâ in between work days.\n\nHereâs a sample itinerary to explain how this works:\n\nThursday: Fly to Durham, NC.\n\nFriday: Meet with clients.\n\nSaturday: Intermediate line dancing lessons.\n\nSunday: Advanced line dancing lessons.\n\nMonday: Meet with clients.\n\nTuesday: Fly home.\n\nThursday and Tuesday are travel days (remember: travel days on business trips count as work days). And Friday and Monday, youâll be conducting business.\n\nIt wouldnât make sense to fly home for the weekend (your non-work days), only to fly back into Durham for your business meetings on Monday morning.\n\nSo, since youâre technically staying in Durham on Saturday and Sunday, between the days when youâll be conducting business, the total cost of your lodging on the trip is tax deductible, even if you arenât actually doing any work on the weekend.\n\nItâs not your fault that your client meetings are happening in Durhamâthe unofficial line dancing capital of America.\n\nMeals and entertainment during your stay\n\nEven on a business trip, you can only deduct a portion of the meal and entertainment expenses that specifically facilitate business. So, if youâre in Louisiana closing a deal over some alligator nuggets, you can write off 50% of the bill.\n\nJust make sure you make a note on the receipt, or in your expense-tracking app, about the nature of the meeting you conductedâwho you met with, when, and what you discussed.\n\nOn the other hand, if youâre sampling the local cuisine and thereâs no clear business justification for doing so, youâll have to pay for the meal out of your own pocket.\n\nMeals and entertainment while you travel\n\nWhile you are traveling to the destination where youâre doing business, the meals you eat along the way can be deducted by 50% as business expenses.\n\nThis could be your chance to sample local delicacies and write them off on your tax return. Just make sure your tastes arenât too extravagant. Just like any deductible business expense, the meals must remain âordinary and necessaryâ for conducting business.\n\nHow Bench can help\n\nSurprised at the kinds of expenses that are tax-deductible?

While you canât directly deduct the expense of bringing friends and family on business trips, some costs can be offset indirectly.\n\nDriving to your destination\n\nHave three or four empty seats in your car? Feel free to fill them. As long as youâre traveling for business, and renting a vehicle is a ânecessary and ordinaryâ expense, you can still deduct your business mileage or car rental costs even when others join you for the ride.\n\nOne exception: If you incur extra mileage or âunnecessaryâ rental costs because you bring your family along for the ride, the expense is no longer deductible because it isnât ânecessary or ordinary.â\n\nFor example, letâs say you had to rent an extra large van to bring your children on a business trip. If you wouldnât have needed to rent the same vehicle to travel alone, the expense of the extra large van no longer qualifies as a business deduction.\n\nRenting a place to stay\n\nSimilar to the driving expense, you can only deduct lodging equivalent to what you would use if you were travelling alone.\n\nHowever, there is some flexibility. If you pay for lodging to accommodate you and your family, you can deduct the portion of lodging costs that is equivalent to what you would pay only for yourself.\n\nFor example, letâs say a hotel room for one person costs $100, but a hotel room that can accommodate your family costs $150. You can rent the $150 option and deduct $100 of the cost as a business expenseâbecause $100 is how much youâd be paying if you were staying there alone.\n\nThis deduction has the potential to save you a lot of money on accommodation for your family. Just make sure you hold on to receipts and records that state the prices of different rooms, in case you need to justify the expense to the IRS\n\nHeads up. When it comes to AirBnB, the lines get blurry. Itâs easy to compare the cost of a hotel room with one bed to a hotel room with two beds. But when youâre comparing significantly different lodgings, with different ownersâa pool house versus a condo, for exampleâit becomes hard to justify deductions. Sticking to âtraditionalâ lodging like hotels and motels may help you avoid scrutiny during an audit. And when in doubt: ask your tax advisor.\n\nSo your trip is technically a vacation? You can still claim any business-related expenses\n\nThe moment your getaway crosses the line from âbusiness tripâ to âvacationâ (e.g. you spend more days toasting your buns than closing deals) you can no longer deduct business travel expenses.\n\nGenerally, a âvacationâ is:\n\nA trip where you donât spend the majority of your days doing business\n\nA business trip you canât back up with correct documentation\n\nHowever, you can still deduct regular business-related expenses if you happen to conduct business while youâre on vacay.\n\nFor example, say you visit Portland for fun, and one of your clients also lives in that city. You have a lunch meeting with your client while youâre in town. Because the lunch is business related, you can write off 50% of the cost of the meal, the same way you would any other business meal and entertainment expense. Just make sure you keep the receipt.\n\nMeanwhile, the other âvacationâ related expenses that made it possible to meet with this client in personâplane tickets to Portland, vehicle rental so you could drive around the cityâcannot be deducted; the trip is still a vacation.\n\nIf your business travel is with your own vehicle\n\nThere are two ways to deduct business travel expenses when youâre using your own vehicle.\n\nActual expenses method\n\nStandard mileage rate method\n\nActual expenses is where you total up the actual cost associated with using your vehicle (gas, insurance, new tires, parking fees, parking tickets while visiting a client etc.) and multiply it by the percentage of time you used it for business. If it was 50% for business during the tax year, youâd multiply your total car costs by 50%, and thatâd be the amount you deduct.\n\nStandard mileage is where you keep track of the business miles you drove during the tax year, and then you claim the standard mileage rate.\n\nThe cost of breaking the rules\n\nDonât bother trying to claim a business trip unless you have the paperwork to back it up. Use an app like Expensify to track business expenditure (especially when you travel for work) and master the art of small business recordkeeping.\n\nIf you claim eligible write offs and maintain proper documentation, you should have all of the records you need to justify your deductions during a tax audit.\n\nSpeaking of which, if your business is flagged to be audited, the IRS will make it a goal to notify you by mail as soon as possible after your filing. Usually, this is within two years of the date for which youâve filed. However, the IRS reserves the right to go as far back as six years.\n\nTax penalties for disallowed business expense deductions\n\nIf youâre caught claiming a deduction you donât qualify for, which helped you pay substantially less income tax than you should have, youâll be penalized. In this case, âsubstantially lessâ means the equivalent of a difference of 10% of what you should have paid, or $5,000âwhichever amount is higher.\n\nThe penalty is typically 20% of the difference between what you should have paid and what you actually paid in income tax. This is on top of making up the difference.\n\nUltimately, youâre paying back 120% of what you cheated off the IRS.\n\nIf youâre slightly confused at this point, donât stress. Hereâs an example to show you how this works:\n\nSuppose you would normally pay $30,000 income tax. But because of a deduction you claimed, you only pay $29,000 income tax.\n\nIf the IRS determines that the deduction you claimed is illegitimate, youâll have to pay the IRS $1200. Thatâs $1000 to make up the difference, and $200 for the penalty.\n\nForm 8275 can help you avoid tax penalties\n\nIf you think a tax deduction may be challenged by the IRS, thereâs a way you can file it while avoiding any chance of being penalized.\n\nFile Form 8275 along with your tax return. This form gives you the chance to highlight and explain the deduction in detail.\n\nIn the event youâre audited and the deduction youâve listed on Form 8275 turns out to be illegitimate, youâll still have to pay the difference to make up for what you should have paid in income taxâbut youâll be saved the 20% penalty.\n\nUnfortunately, filing Form 8275 doesnât reduce your chances of being audited.\n\nWhere to claim travel expenses\n\nIf youâre self-employed, youâll claim travel expenses on Schedule C, which is part of Form 1040.\n\nHow Bench can help\n\nWhen it comes to taking advantage of the tax write-offs weâve discussed in this articleâor any tax write-offs, for that matterâthe support of a professional bookkeeping team and a trusted CPA is essential.\n\nAccurate financial statements will help you understand cash flow and track deductible expenses. And beyond filing your taxes, a CPA can spot deductions you may have overlooked, and represent you during a tax audit."
