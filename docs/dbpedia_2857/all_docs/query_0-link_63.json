        "text": "Local and Regional Transportation Information\n\nCoast Bus (Seacoast Public Transit)\n\nC&J Bus (Regional Bus Line)\n\nAmtrak Downeaster Line (Durham-UNH Station)\n\nWhere can I find accessible parking spaces at UNH?\n\nThe UNH-Durham campus has designated accessible parking spaces across the campus with the highest concentration of spaces located in the core campus. Accessible spaces can be found in all lots except perimeter Lots A, West Edge and the Mast Road Lots. Zoom into a building on the Accessibility Map to find the closest accessible parking spaces. Look for the wheelchair symbol.\n\nAccessible parking spaces at the Manchester and Concord campuses are located in proximity to each building's accessible entrance(s).\n\nAccessible parking spaces are reserved on a first come/first served basis for individuals with a walking disability who display a current state-issued license plate or hanging placard. Disability plates and hang tags are honored in all 50 states. At UNH-Durham an individual with a disability plate or hanging placard may park in a marked accessible space in any commuter or staff parking lot.\n\nAccessible parking spaces are exempt from the Winter Parking Ban.\n\nIn New Hampshire it is illegal to use a hanging placard issued to another individual who is not entering or exiting the vehicle.\n\nIs there any place else I can park on campus?\n\nIn New Hampshire, a vehicle with a current accessible parking plate or placard may park for free at any meter. This applies to street or UNH lot meters for the full extent of the allowed time if fully paid.\n\nSee the Parking web site for all other parking-related questions or give them a call.\n\nHow can I tell if a parking space is reserved for people with walking disabilities?\n\nAccessible parking spaces are designated with a sign placed at the head of the parking space. In most cases, the sign will display a wheelchair, the international symbol of access. The space itself may also have the wheelchair symbol stenciled on the pavement. Some signs will also indicate that the space is van accessible; this means that the parking space and access aisle total 16 feet across.\n\nWhat is an access aisle?\n\nAccessible parking spaces must include an adjacent access aisle. Some access aisles are 8 feet wide, others are 5 feet wide. Access aisles are hatched to indicate that they are not parking spaces. In fact, it is illegal for anyone to park in an access aisle. This is because the access aisle provides the necessary clearance for an occupant with a disability to swing a door all the way out or to drop a ramp or lift and still have enough space to disembark and turn.\n\nHow can I apply for a state issued walking disability plate or placard?\n\nYou must apply for walking disability privileges through the NH Department of Motor Vehicles\n\nHow can I learn more about New Hampshire accessible parking laws?"
