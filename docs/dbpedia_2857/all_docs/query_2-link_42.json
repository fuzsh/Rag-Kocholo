The Sunflower Program offers free sunflower products to airport workers and guests that discreetly indicate the wearer may need extra assistance or time when traveling through the airport. The sunflower is a globally recognized symbol for non-visible disabilities, also known as hidden disabilities or invisible disabilities.\n\nMany people have disabilities that aren’t obvious. Hidden disabilities include autism, chronic pain, and learning difficulties; mental health conditions, mobility and speech impairments; and sensory loss such as speech, sight loss, hearing loss, or deafness. They also include respiratory conditions as well as chronic conditions such as diabetes and sleep disorders when these significantly impact day-to-day life.\n\nPeople with these disabilities often face barriers that can make routine tasks and everyday life more challenging. Travelers can choose to wear a sunflower product to discreetly indicate that they may require additional assistance, a little more compassion or time throughout their journey.\n\nSunflower products are available to anyone to make it easier for airport employees to identify people with hidden disabilities who may need extra time, assistance or support. Wearing the sunflower does not guarantee special treatment.\n\nFree sunflower-branded lanyards, pins and other products are available at RDU Information Desks in Terminals 1 and 2. Guests may also contact the Airport Authority to make special arrangements for pick-up by calling (919) 840-2123.\n\nWheelchairs\n\nDo you need a wheelchair upon arrival at RDU?
