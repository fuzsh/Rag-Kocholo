        "text": "ROANOKE, Va. (WDBJ) - Roanoke City Public Schools will pay $77 million for a five-year deal with a transportation company called Zum.\n\nThe contract officially starts in August, and as the company prepares to serve the district, they are prioritizing safety and efficiency.\n\n“Safety is at the forefront of everything that we do — safe student transport, getting students not only to and from school safely, but also on time,” said General Manager Eric Huegerich.\n\nThe California-based company has primarily served school districts on the West Coast. This is the first time it will provide services to a school in Virginia. The company will assist Roanoke City Public Schools and its 14,000 students.\n\nHuegerich says what sets Zum apart is its technology. It has an app allowing parents to track their childrem’s buses and see when they arrive.\n\n“With this, the district or a parent can literally go on the app or the platform and see where that bus is in real time,” explained Huegerich.\n\nThis comes after the school district decided not to renew its contract with Durham School Services. Students have faced bus delays in Roanoke since at least 2019. Durham School Services bus aide Dawn Boulanger says Durham tried to fix the issue.\n\n“They tried the best they could. They did the best they could,” said Boulanger. “I give them a lot of credit.”\n\nDurham School Services responded to WDBJ7′s request for comment with a statement.\n\n“It was a great privilege and honor to serve Roanoke City Public Schools and its students for the past five years. Again, we’d like to thank the Roanoke community and its residents for giving us the opportunity to serve them over the last few years,” communications specialist Anna Lam said. “We wish nothing but the best for the community, Roanoke City Public Schools students, and their new transportation provider.”\n\nCameras on Zum’s buses will record how drivers are doing on the road.\n\n“Anytime a driver does something, you know, that’s potentially questionable or of concern, we get that immediate feedback that allows us to coach drivers almost instantaneously,” added Huegerich.\n\nHe says they are going to be able to increase drivers’ current pay. They’re promising parents a modernized service.\n\n“I think it’s something that as concerns arise, and they will, that’s the nature of any operation, we’re going to be able to answer those questions and very quickly pivot and make changes that will, again, better help students and parents get where they need to be,” said Huegerich.\n\nLooking ahead, Zum is looking to hire 125 people for an estimated 110 bus routes.
