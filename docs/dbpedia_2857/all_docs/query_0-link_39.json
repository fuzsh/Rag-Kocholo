We will be happy to add your student after the due date, but the bus stop locations will be set; thus, students may have to walk farther and possibly wait several days before they can begin riding the bus.\n\nTRANSPORTATION GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nALL eligibility is determined by your home address, not where your child will be transported to or from.\n\nIt is possible to bus to and from an address other than your home, but the address needs to be within the district, within the area school of attendance, and also within a bus area.\n\nAddresses cannot be in a walk zone (see below) in order for busing to be provided.\n\nThe transportation must be the same every day. For example: the bus would go to and from the alternate (e.g. daycare) address every day or to your home address every day, but never changing between the two.\n\nAll Kindergarten and 1st grade students will need to have an authorized person to release the student to the bus driver and to receive the student at the bus stop in the afternoon.\n\nInteractive School / Bus Zone Maps\n\n2024 – 2025 School Year\n\nKaren Acres Interactive Bus Zones\n\nOlmsted Interactive Bus Zones\n\nValerius Interactive Bus Zones\n\nWebster Interactive Bus Zones\n\nUMS Interactive Bus Zone Map\n\nUHS Interactive Bus Zone Map\n\nAre you eligible to ride the bus for free?\n\nAll students in grades K-8 who live 2 miles or more from their school and all students in grades 9-12 who live 3 miles or more from the high school are eligible.\n\nIf you are considering Karen Acres for your student, you may be eligible for free transportation. Please contact the District Registrar to verify your eligibility (contact information below).\n\nARE YOU ELIGIBLE TO RIDE THE BUS FOR A FEE?\n\nAll students who live outside the walk zone for their school (see Walk Zone links above) are eligible to request a bus for a fee.\n\nPAYMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FEES\n\nYou will be notified via ParentSquare before bus fees are assigned to your account. You can view and pay your fee balance in your PowerSchool parent portal. Instructions on how to pay fees in PowerSchool can be found here.\n\nAnnual and Semester Bus Transportation Fees Annual Pass 2-Way $392.00 Semester Pass 2-Way $206.00 Annual Pass 1-Way AM $196.00 Semester Pass 1-Way AM $103.00 Annual Pass 1-Way PM $196.00 Semester Pass 1-Way PM $103.00\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n\nTo be on a route for the first day of school, your request needs to be received no later than July 1st for Karen Acres and August 1st for all other schools. We will be happy to add your student after the due date, but the bus stop locations will be set; thus, students may have to walk farther and possibly wait several days before they can begin riding the bus.\n\nRefunds\n\nRequests must be received by October 1 for 1st semester and February 1 for 2nd semester. Requests must be submitted in writing to kochera@urbandaleschools.com\n\nBUSING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS\n\nSpecial Education students have the same busing rules as general education students unless their IEP specifies specially designed transportation service.\n\nIEP teams (of which parents are included) determine if the nature and severity of the disability requires specially designed transportation\n\nOpen Enrollment (OE) rules apply for Special Education students too, and typically OE students are not eligible for any transportation services between school and home. (See Transportation Options For Open Enrolled Students directly below.)\n\nStudents with specially designed transportation may need to have an authorized parent meet them in the afternoon, depending on the nature of the disability and the age of the child\n\nTRANSPORTATION OPTIONS FOR OPEN ENROLLED STUDENTS\n\nOpen enrolled students do not qualify for busing. Parents are responsible for student’s transportation to school.\n\nThere may be an option for parents to purchase bus services within the Urbandale District. In this case, parents must provide transportation to an existing stop. The stop must be on a route that has space and serves the school the student is attending.\n\nTransportation assistance for those who qualify according to income guidelines is available only between contiguous districts.\n\nHOW TO COMPLETE A BUS TRANSPORTATION REQUEST\n\nStep 1: Login to PowerSchoolLogin to your parent portal.
