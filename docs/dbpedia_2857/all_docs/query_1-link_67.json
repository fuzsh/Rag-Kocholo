        "text": "Durham police are investigating a fatal crash involving a bus and woman on the sidewalk at the bus station at 515 West Pettigrew Street.\n\nThe crash happened shortly after 12:30 p.m. on Thursday as a GoDurham bus was pulling into Gate A at the bus station. The bus jumped the curb and struck a woman who was standing on the sidewalk, according to investigators.\n\nThe woman, Lawanda Gail Rigsbee, 56, of Durham, was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later. The driver of the bus was taken to the hospital for treatment of serious injuries.\n\nAlexandra Taverez, 53, was cited for misdemeanor death and making an unsafe movement a couple weeks after the incident.\n\nRigsbee's mother was reportedly standing right beside her at the time.\n\nBrandon Ruffin, who was waiting for the bus at the time, said, \"I was coming out of the building. It happened so fast. I just saw the bus move and hit the pole, and I didn't realize that it was a lady that was hit until after I had gotten outside.\"\n\nHe described the crash as \"traumatic.\"\n\n\"That was probably the worst thing I've ever seen in life. In front of me. Just to see her laying there, unresponsive,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Holland, who was working at a table near the crash, said he heard a loud boom and then glass was everywhere.\n\n\"All of a sudden I heard this loud sound – maybe 30 yards away from me. And saw a lady on the ground. She really wasn't moving at all,\" he said.\n\nBoth Ruffin and Holland told WRAL News they thought the driver had some kind of medical issue. Officials have not confirmed whether that was the case.\n\n\"She started shaking really bad and her foot let up off the brake – and she went into the pole while the lady was walking through at the same time,\" Ruffin said."
