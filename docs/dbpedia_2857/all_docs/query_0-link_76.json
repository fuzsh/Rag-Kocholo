        "text": "NEW IN 2024: HOP ON THE BUS FOR HAPPY HOUR!\n\nHAPPY HOUR HISTORY: STORIES OF THE “GRITTY CITY”\n\nFriday, June 28 (4PM, SOLD OUT!) • Friday, July 19 (3:30PM, SOLD OUT!) • Friday, August 16 (4PM, SOLD OUT!)\n\nInspired by Omaha’s rough and tumble past, “The Gritty City” explores the growth and challenges the city faced as the country expanded west. Omaha was at times a sophisticated urban setting and other times a throwback to the days of the Wild West. The tour will conclude in time for happy hour at Sips on 10th where guests can enjoy a complimentary signature cocktail made just for the occasion. It’s a great way to kick back and relax on a Friday afternoon!\n\nMAKE IT A PRIVATE TOUR! Looking for a team building outing with your organization? The Durham Museum is happy to offer this experience as a private tour for your group throughout the summer on Friday afternoons. Please email education@durhammuseum.org or call 402-444-5027 to inquire and book your private tour. Tour dates subject to availability.\n\n2024 BUS TOURS\n\nNEW! OMAHA AND THE PRESIDENTS\n\n2024 marks an election year, and The Durham Museum is excited to present a new two-part tour focusing on American presidents and their influence on Omaha and the wider region. As guests will learn, Omaha has played a role in shaping the world’s most powerful office and those who have held it. Sign up for both tours (Parts I & II) to experience the full story spanning 200 years of American history, or sign up for one. We can assure you, each tour is a rich experience all on its own!\n\nPart I – Sunday, June 2 (1PM, Sold Out!) • Tuesday, July 16 (6PM) • Sunday, October 13 (1PM): From the days of Thomas Jefferson and the Louisiana Purchase to Franklin Pierce and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, to Abraham Lincoln’s vision for a trans-continental railroad, American presidents shaped Omaha’s formative years. But a number of crises developed during the 19th and 20th centuries that tested the White House as well as our local community. Join us as we discuss triumphs, trials and tribulations from Jefferson to T. Roosevelt, and how they and Omaha addressed those important moments.\n\nPart II – Sunday, June 9 (1PM) • Tuesday, July 30 (6PM) • Sunday, October 20 (1PM): Omaha’s rise to prominence in the 20th century was marked by contradiction. Periods of incredible industry and creativity were coupled with stark divisions and deadly riots. Throughout it all, FDR brought his Fireside Chats to the Omaha household and Eisenhower built interstates through the city. Join us on a journey from Taft to Ford as we explore the paradoxes of Omaha in the 1900s and how the presidency, and the nation more widely, mirrored and shaped the local community.\n\nFrom Expositions to Jazz Musicians\n\nSaturday, May 18 (1PM, SOLD OUT!) • Saturday, July 6 (1PM, SOLD OUT!)\n\nIn 1898, Omaha hosted the Trans-Mississippi & International Exposition, an event that brought millions to Omaha to learn about life west of the Mississippi River. Visit the former site of the expo and see the stately homes, parks and jazz halls that followed in its path. Plus, enjoy a stop at the historic Florence Mill!\n\nLast Call for Alcohol: Omaha’s Bootlegging History\n\nTuesday, June 25 (6PM, SOLD OUT!) • Tuesday, August 27 (6PM, SOLD OUT!) • Sunday, September 22 (1PM, SOLD OUT!)\n\nBy the time prohibition was the law of the land in the U.S., Nebraska had been “dry” for two years and organized crime syndicates had established a well-oiled machine to turn profits. Local and federal authorities spent years putting together a case that ultimately brought down the “kingpin” of Omaha’s crime scene, Tom Dennison. This tour, based on Dennison’s 1931 federal indictment, takes a look at hotels, speakeasys and other key locations in prohibition-era Omaha.\n\nOmaha’s Parks and Boulevards\n\nSaturday, May 11 (1PM) • Saturday, August 3 (1PM) • Sunday, September 29 (1PM)\n\nDid you know that Omaha developed a beautiful parks and boulevard system beginning in the late 1800s? In fact, much of this system remains today linking popular parks like Elmwood and Hanscom with gorgeous tree-lined streets such as Happy Hollow and Lincoln Boulevard. The “Parks and Boulevards” tour will take you along the beautiful path developers laid out so many years ago.\n\nRemember the Ladies! The Women of Early Omaha\n\nSaturday, July 20 (1PM) • Saturday, August 17 (1PM, SOLD OUT!) • Sunday, September 8 (1PM, SOLD OUT!)\n\nHop on a tour with us in honor of the founding ladies of Omaha. This tour will introduce you to a few of Omaha’s first women, from factory workers and business owners to religious leaders and activists, who contributed to the growth and success of Omaha today. Destinations on this tour will include driving through Omaha’s previous “Red Light District,” the Paxton Hotel, St. Cecilia Cathedral, and so much more!\n\nREGISTER FOR YOUR BUS TOUR\n\nNote to members, your discount will be applied near the end of the registration process.\n\nTour Choices\n\nCAPTCHA"
