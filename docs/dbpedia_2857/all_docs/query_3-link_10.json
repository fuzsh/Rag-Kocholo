        "text": "Not long ago, “friend” was a noun, “yelp” meant a shrill bark, “twitter” referred to a chirp, a “tumbler” was a gymnast or a glass, and “facebook,” “youtube,” and “instagram” were gibberish. Cases now rise and fall on the admissibility of Facebook profiles, Yelp reviews, Twitter tweets, YouTube videos, Instagram photos, Tumblr posts, and other social media evidence — and more conventional, but only slightly older, electronic data like text messages, emails, search engine results, and webpages (live or archived).\n\nWhile the media are new, the applicable evidentiary principles are familiar and have easily adapted to them. The two overarching issues are authentication and hearsay. This article focuses on authentication beginning with the critical, and very distinct, roles of judge and jury in deciding that question. The article then turns to authentication of website data, moving from conventional webpages to social media pages. It concludes with a discussion of email, text, and social media messages.\n\nI. Judge as Gatekeeper, Jury as Decision Maker\n\nThe ultimate decision maker on the question of authentication is the finder of fact. The judge is gatekeeper, but this is not Daubert-intensive gatekeeping.\n\nThe principal authentication rule, Rule 901(a), provides that: “To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.” The court makes the initial decision under Rule 104(a) whether the proponent has offered sufficient proof that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity. If so, then, under Rule 104(b), the jury makes the ultimate determination as to whether the evidence is, in fact, what its proponent claims. “Importantly,” as the Fourth Circuit has observed, “the burden to authenticate under Rule 901 is not high . . . . [A] district court’s role is to serve as gatekeeper in assessing whether the proponent has offered a satisfactory foundation from which the jury could reasonably find that the evidence is authentic.” “In performing its Rule 104 gate-keeping function, the trial court itself need not be persuaded that the proffered evidence is authentic. The preliminary question for the trial court to decide is simply whether the proponent of the evidence has supplied facts that are sufficient to support a reasonable jury determination that the evidence he has proffered is authentic.” At that point, the issue is for the jury.\n\nII. Conventional Websites\n\nPrima Facie Website Authentication\n\nIn applying Rule 901 authentication standards to website evidence, there are three questions that must be answered:\n\nWhat was actually on the website?\n\nDoes the exhibit or testimony accurately reflect it?\n\nIf so, is it attributable to the owner of the site?\n\nIt is generally sufficient, in order to make a prima facie showing of authenticity, that a witness testifies — or certifies in compliance with a statute or rule — that:\n\nThe witness typed in the Internet address reflected on the exhibit on the date and at the time stated;\n\nThe witness logged onto the website and reviewed its contents; and\n\nThe exhibit fairly and accurately reflects what the witness perceived.\n\nThe exhibit should bear the Internet address and the date and time the webpage was accessed and the contents downloaded.\n\nWhen evaluating the proffer, the court considers whether the exhibit bears indicia of reliability, such as:\n\nDistinctive website design, logos, photos, or other images associated with the website or its owner.\n\nThe contents of the webpage are of a type ordinarily posted on that website or websites of similar people or entities.\n\nThe contents of the webpage remain on the website for the court to verify.\n\nThe owner of the website has elsewhere published the same contents, in whole or in part.\n\nThe contents of the webpage have been republished elsewhere and attributed to the website.\n\nThe contents were posted on the website for some period of time.\n\nThe opponent of the evidence is free to challenge it by adducing facts showing that the exhibit does not accurately reflect the contents of a website, or that those contents are not attributable to the ostensible owner of the site. There may be legitimate questions concerning the ownership of the site or attribution of statements contained on the site to the ostensible owner. More by way of authentication may be required of a proponent who is known to be an information technology specialist (that is, a computer geek) and is both able and motivated to modify the proffered website data.\n\nSelf-Authenticating Website Data\n\nThree types of webpage exhibits are self-authenticating.\n\nGovernment Websites. Under Rule 902(5) (Official Publications), “[a] book, pamphlet, or other publication purporting to be issued by a public authority” is self-authenticating. Rule 101(b)(6) provides that “a reference to any kind of written material or any other medium includes electronically stored information.” Hence, data on governmental websites are self-authenticating.\n\nAs discussed below, courts regularly take judicial notice of these websites.\n\nNewspaper & Periodical Websites. Under Rule 902(6) (Newspapers and Periodicals), “[p]rinted material purporting to be a newspaper or periodical” is self-authenticating. Coupled with Rule 101(b)(6), which expands “printed” to include electronic data, newspaper, and periodical material that appears on the web — whether or not it ever appeared in hard copy — is self-authenticating. As discussed below, courts regularly take judicial notice of these websites. (Note that, while the contents of articles remain subject to hearsay analysis, if an article is more than 20 years old it is not excludable as hearsay because it is an “ancient document” under Rule 803(16), seemingly leading to the conclusion that incredible tabloid articles from the early ’90s or before are admissible for their truth. Sometimes, common sense must intrude.)\n\nWebsites Certified as Business Records. Rules 902(11) and (12) render self- authenticating business (organizational) records that are certified as satisfying Rule 803(6) by “the custodian or another qualified person.” Exhibits extracted from websites that are maintained by, for, and in the ordinary course of a business or other regularly conducted activity can satisfy this rule.\n\nJudicial Notice of Website Evidence\n\n“It is not uncommon for courts to take judicial notice of factual information found on the world wide web.” Governmental Websites. First and foremost among the types of Internet inference that may be judicially noticed is that taken from governmental websites, including:\n\nFederal, state, and local court websites.\n\nFederal, state, and local agency, department and other entities’ websites.\n\nForeign government websites.\n\nInternational organization websites.\n\nEven this rule has exceptions, however. For example, one court found that data posted on the website of a governmental entity, which was a litigant before the court, was in conflict with all other evidence (including evidence before the governmental entity that posted the data) and was insufficiently trustworthy to warrant judicial notice.\n\nNongovernmental Websites. Generally, and with some notable exceptions, courts are reluctant to take judicial notice of nongovernmental websites because the Internet “contains an unlimited supply of information with varying degrees of reliability, permanence, and accessibility” and “is an open source” permitting anyone to “purchas[e] an Internet address and create a website.”\n\nFamiliar, Frequently Noticed Websites. Nonetheless, there are many types of nongovernmental websites of which courts routinely take judicial notice, including:\n\nInternet maps (e.g., Google Maps, MapQuest).\n\nCalendar information.\n\nNewspaper and periodical articles.\n\nOnline versions of textbooks, dictionaries, rules, charters.\n\nWayback Machine. Archived versions of websites as displayed on The Wayback Machine (www.archive.org) are frequently the subject of judicial notice, but this is not always the case.26 Note that it is only the contents of the archived pages that may warrant judicial notice — the dates assigned to archived pages may not apply to images linked to them, and more generally, links on archived pages may direct to the live web if the object of the old link is no longer available. Corporate Websites. For certain purposes, even private business websites may warrant judicial notice. Much may turn on the purpose for which judicial notice is taken, the nature or stage of the proceedings, whether any party contests the taking of judicial notice, whether the evidence is in the nature of a party admission, the importance to the outcome of the case of the fact to be noticed, and other variables.\n\nIII. Social Media Websites\n\nUser-Created Pages\n\nAnyone can create a Facebook or other social media page in anyone else’s name — that is, create a false identity, post a phony social media page, send pseudonymous messages. Law enforcement does this with some regularity. There is even instruction on the Internet in how to create a fake Facebook page. One person may also gain access to another’s account, which becomes easier and easier as people own more and more devices, each of which can be used to link to their social media accounts.\n\nCourts are, therefore, circumspect in their approach to authentication of social media evidence.\n\nBoth the social media page and the particular post must be linked to the purported author.\n\nThis can be done in a variety of ways, including:\n\nAn admission from the purported author, in or out of court, that he or she created the page or posted the item.\n\nTestimony of a witness who saw the purported author post the item to the page.\n\nTestimony of a witness that she often communicated with the alleged creator of the page through that account.\n\nA forensic review of the Internet history and hard drive of the purported author’s computer or other devices.\n\nInformation from the social media network that links the page or post to the purported author.\n\nCircumstantial evidence derived from:- Witness testimony (Rule 901(a), (b)(1)).- Distinctive characteristics of the contents themselves and corroborative circumstances (Rule 901(b)(4)).- Descriptions and explanations of the technical process or system that generated the evidence (Rule 901(b)(9)).\n\nAmong the circumstantial factors that may tip the scales in favor of, or against, putting the issue to the jury for final determination are:\n\nWhether the purported author knows the password to the account.\n\nHow many others know it as well.\n\nThat the page or post contains:\n\nNonpublic details of the purported author’s life.- Other items known uniquely to the purported author or a small group including him or her.\n\nReferences or links to, or contact information about, loved ones, relatives, co-workers, others close to the purported author.\n\nPhotos, videos.\n\nCell numbers.\n\nNicknames.\n\nBiographical information.\n\nThe structure or style of comments.\n\nThat the purported author acts in accordance with the contents of the page or post.\n\nSocial Media Conversations and Website Chats\n\nEvidence of social media conversations or more conventional website chats may be of interest only to the extent that the person who left a salient posting can be identified. Simply to show that a posting appears on a particular user’s webpage is insufficient to authenticate the post as one written by the account holder.\n\nThird-party posts, too, must be authenticated by more than the names of the purported authors reflected on the posts.\n\nEvidence sufficient to attribute a social media or chat room posting to a particular individual may include, for example:\n\nTestimony from a witness who identifies the social media account as that of the alleged author and one on which the witness on other occasions communicated with the account holder.\n\nTestimony from a participant in the conversation based on firsthand knowledge that the transcript fairly and accurately captures the conversation.\n\nEvidence that the purported author used the same screen name on other occasions.\n\nEvidence that the purported author acted in accordance with the posting (e.g., when a meeting with that person was arranged, he or she attended).\n\nEvidence that the purported author identified him- or herself as the individual using the screen name.\n\nAn admission that the social media account containing the chat is that of the alleged author.\n\nUse in the conversation of the customary signature, nickname, or emoticon associated with the individual.\n\nDisclosure in the conversation of particularized information that is either unique to the purported author or known only to a small group including the individual.\n\nEvidence that the individual had in his or her possession information given to the person using the screen name.\n\nEvidence from the hard drive of the purported author’s computer reflecting that a user of the computer used the screen name in question.\n\nEvidence that the chat appears on the computer or other device of the account owner and purported author.\n\nEvidence that the purported author elsewhere discussed the same subject matter.\n\nYouTube and Other Online Videos\n\nThe first step in authenticating an online video is to satisfy the three-part test for website evidence generally. That requires evidence that a witness accessed a particular page on a particular site (we will use YouTube as the paradigm) and reviewed what was on the page, and that a proffered video fairly and accurately reflects what the witness saw. See § II(A), supra.\n\nA YouTube video can be authenticated circumstantially with evidence identifying the individual and items depicted, and establishing where and roughly when the video was recorded, without evidence from YouTube (Google) personnel. A YouTube video can be rendered self-authenticating by obtaining and proffering a Rule 902(11) or (12) certification from a Google custodian of records that the video was captured and maintained on the company’s servers in the ordinary course of business at or near the time that users post them. If the YouTube video is posted on a Facebook page, that certification should be accompanied by a similar Rule 902(11) certification from a Facebook custodian of records that the page was captured and maintained on Facebook servers in the ordinary course of business.\n\nYelp and Other Online Reviews\n\nThe first step in authenticating an online review is to satisfy the three-part test for website evidence generally, which is set forth in § II(A), supra. In addition to proving that the review was posted on the site, it is often essential that it identify the author. Identification can be established circumstantially — for example, by:\n\nThe review’s similarity to the alleged author’s other writings.\n\nThe reviewer’s use of a pseudonym or screen name used elsewhere by the alleged author.\n\nThe reviewer’s use of pseudonyms that share the alleged author’s actual initials.\n\nThe alleged author repeating the substance of the review elsewhere.\n\nThe alleged author’s failure affirmatively to deny authorship.\n\nInstagram and Other Online Photo Sites\n\nThe first step in authenticating an Instagram photo is to satisfy the three-part test for website evidence generally, which is set forth in § II(A), supra. Testimony from a witness that the witness downloaded a photo from Instagram and that the exhibit fairly and accurately reflects it may suffice to authenticate it.\n\nIV. Email and Text Messages\n\nConventional Emails and Texts\n\nThe mere fact that an email purports to come from someone’s email address or a text emanates from a person’s cell phone or other device typically is insufficient to authenticate a message as coming from a particular individual. Some methods of authenticating emails and texts are unique to the medium. For example, the “@” designation of origin in an email address has been held sufficient to self-authenticate the email as having been sent by the organization. Many methods of authentication, however, are the same or very similar for both emails and texts, and the authentication of either may depend on whether the relevant question is whether a particular person received an emailed or texted message or whether someone sent the message.\n\nWhether a Particular Person Received a Message. Receipt of an email or text may be proved circumstantially with evidence that the message was sent to the email address or phone number assigned at the time to the person, and receipt is corroborated by circumstantial evidence, such as:\n\nA reply to the email was received from the email address or phone number assigned to the person.\n\nSubsequent communications with the person reflect the person’s knowledge of the contents of the message.\n\nSubsequent conduct of the person reflects the person’s knowledge of the contents of the message.\n\nA participant to an electronic conversation testifies that an exhibit fairly and accurately reflects the messages exchanged with the recipient.\n\nThe person produced the message in the action.\n\nWhether a Particular Person Sent a Message. That a particular person sent a specific email or text may be proved circumstantially with evidence that the message was received from the email address or phone number assigned at the time to the person and receipt is corroborated by circumstantial evidence, such as:\n\nThe message contained the typewritten name, nickname, or initials of the recipient or the sender, or reflected the sender’s customary use of emoji or emoticons.\n\nIf an email, the message contained the signature block or electronic signature of the person.\n\nIf a text, the sender’s cell phone number or name as displayed on the cell phone or other device of the recipient.\n\nThe contents of the message would normally be known only to the person or to a discrete number or category of people including the person.\n\nSubsequent or contemporaneous communications with the person reflect the person’s knowledge of the contents of the message.\n\nSubsequent conduct of the person reflects the person’s knowledge of the contents of the message.\n\nThe recipient had previously communicated with the sender at the same cell number or email address.\n\nThe sender told the recipient that he would email or text her, and she soon received a text from an account she knew was his.\n\nThe sender alone (or among a small group) had the motive to send the message.\n\nThe absence of evidence that anyone had the motive or opportunity to impersonate the sender in sending the message.\n\nThe alleged sender or recipient knows the password to the computer, cell phone, or other device from which the message was sent.\n\nThe alleged sender or recipient knows the password to the computer, cell phone, or other device from which the message was sent.\n\nEvidence that the message was sent from the computer or other device of the purported author.\n\nExternal corroboration that statements made by the alleged sender in the message concerning his or her whereabouts are accurate.\n\nThe tone, syntax, appearance, and other characteristics of the message are consistent with that of other communications from the alleged sender.\n\nThe person produced the message in the action.\n\nSocial Media Messages\n\nAuthentication of messages sent over a social network is, at the outset, the same as authentication of other messages. Because anyone can create a social media identity in anyone else’s name, “the fact that an electronic communication on its face purports to originate from a certain person’s social networking account is generally insufficient standing alone to authenticate that person as the author of the communication.” Consequently, “[t]here must be some ‘confirming circumstances’ sufficient for a reasonable jury to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the [purported author in fact] authored the e-mails.” “So long as the authenticity of the proffered evidence was at least ‘within the zone of reasonable disagreement,’ the jury [i]s entitled to weigh the credibility of the[] witnesses and decide who was telling the truth.” Circumstantial indicia of authorship or receipt parallels those used for email and text messages, coupled with the indicia for social media conversations, all as discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo borrow from the Second Circuit, speaking in another context: “[A]ttempting to apply established [evidence] law in the fast-developing world of the Internet is somewhat like trying to board a moving bus.” So far, however, the Rules and the courts have been fully up to the challenge.\n\nMay We Suggest: Contracting the Virus: Not If, But When\n\nFootnotes:"
