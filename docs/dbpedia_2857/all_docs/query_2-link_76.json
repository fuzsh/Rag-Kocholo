        "text": "Whether you like it or loathe it, Durham Bus Station has been welcoming people from far and wide for more than 100 years.\n\nThe site on North Road has been serving thousands each week as buses pull in from Teesside, Darlington, Tyne & Wear and the rest of the county.\n\nServed mainly by Go North East and Arriva North East, it remains one of the main ways the city welcomes workers, residents and tourists.\n\nBut next Monday, it is set to close its doors as the current building is torn down to make way for a brand new ‘transport hub' on the same site.\n\nSEE MORE: Durham Bus Station closure - here are details of temporary bus stops\n\nThe long-awaited hub which has been several years in the making will provide more overall space with plans suggesting a ‘light and airy’ setting.\n\nWe've delved into our archives to see how the bus station has evolved from a relatively small shelter to a major thoroughfare in the region.\n\nTake a look below:\n\nLast week, Durham County Councillor and City of Durham Parish Councillor Richard Ormerod hailed the demolition as a new era for the bus station is set to begin.\n\nHe said: “We’ve waited a long time for this to happen.\n\nSEE MORE: The apprentice roles set to be created by this North-East bus firm this year\n\n“Working with the council we managed to secure a green wall and solar panels. We will have a building which is safer, greener, more attractive and more user-friendly than the old one.”"
