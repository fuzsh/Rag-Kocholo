        "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Summer vacation is about to start, but one of the bus contractors for Duval County Public Schools is already working to ensure enough drivers are available to get students to class in the fall.\n\nDurham School Services is hosting a hiring event Thursday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at its office at 1205 Monument Road.\n\nThe event was already a part of a bigger plan to address a driver shortage and prevent delays.\n\nDuval County Public Schools needs about 50 new drivers and a handful of mechanics for next school year.\n\nThe jobs will pay around $25 an hour.\n\nAccording to our news partners at Jax Today, most of the new bus routes Durham will be taking over for DCPS will be in the Beaches area and Arlington.\n\nA driver shortage led to significant delays at the start of this school year.\n\nIn November, the district agreed to a new five-year deal with Durham.\n\nThe company was asked to take over several routes that were handled by Student Transportation of America.\n\nStarting in August, it will manage at least 220 school bus routes and is adding 10 more buses for those routes.\n\nSTA blamed the issues on what it called “significant driver shortfalls” that resulted in delays getting students to and from their respective schools.\n\nDurham School Services says it will give hired drivers free training."
