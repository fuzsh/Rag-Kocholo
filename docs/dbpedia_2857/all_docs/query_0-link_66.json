        "text": "Three of the Triangle’s transit providers have new names.\n\nIn a news conference earlier today, NC Secretary of Transportation Tony Tata, Raleigh Mayor Pro Tem John Odom and Durham Mayor and GoTriangle Board Chair William V. “Bill” Bell, unveiled GoRaleigh, GoDurham and GoTriangle. The transit providers are part of a new family of services called GoTransit.\n\n“Transit is important to Raleigh and Wake County to sustain growth and improve our community,” said Raleigh Mayor Pro Tem John Odom. “This effort is one more way we’re investing in improving our systems.”\n\n“More and more, the Triangle lives, works and plays as a region,” said Durham Mayor and GoTransit Board Chair Bill Bell. “This new exciting transit brand, while maintaining what makes us unique as individual cities and agencies, also reflects our vision for transit to be the link that grows our businesses as well as improves the quality of life for residents throughout the Triangle.\"\n\n“Today’s launch is another important step in our mission to provide a well-connected multimodal transportation system that meets the growing needs of our state,” says Transportation Secretary Tony Tata. “Partnerships like this are essential to helping us better connect people to jobs, education, healthcare and recreation centers, and ensuring continued quality of life for all our communities.”\n\nThe new names replace Capital Area Transit (CAT) for Raleigh, Durham Area Transit Authority (DATA) for Durham and Triangle Transit for the region. Cary’s C-Tran will become GoCary in 2016. Chapel Hill Transit will decide at a later date if it will change its name to GoChapel Hill\n\nFollowing the news conference, GoRaleigh, GoDurham and GoTriangle buses hit the road, stopping at Cary’s Town Hall, GoTriangle’s Regional Transit Center and Durham’s Transportation Center, displaying the new look.\n\nThe public will see the new identity reflected immediately on several buses for GoRaleigh, GoDurham and GoTriangle. The design was driven by the idea of connections and motion. Being in the Triangle, bringing that movement to life using triangular shapes was a natural choice, accompanied by the word Go.\n\nBuses and other vehicles on the road will incorporate the new logo and design elements gradually; new vehicles will carry the new design as they are purchased. The changes will be phased in on Bus Operator uniforms, bus passes and schedules. The name change will also affect social media and websites.\n\nThe N.C. Department of Transportation assisted with funds for the rebranding project."
