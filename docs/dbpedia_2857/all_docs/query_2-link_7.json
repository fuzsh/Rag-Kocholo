        "text": "Transit district in Durham, North Carolina, U.S.\n\nNot to be confused with Durham Region Transit.\n\nGoDurhamFormerlyDurham Area Transit AuthorityFounded1991Headquarters1907 Fay St, Durham, NC 27704LocaleDurham, North CarolinaService typebus service, paratransitAllianceGoTriangleRoutes21HubsDurham Station Transportation CenterFleet58Daily ridership19,700 (weekdays, Q1 2024)[1]Annual ridership5,417,000 (2023)[2]Fuel typeDiesel, Hybrid, & ElectricOperatorFirst TransitWebsitegodurhamtransit .org\n\nGoDurham, formerly Durham Area Transit Authority (DATA), is the public transit system serving Durham, North Carolina. It is currently operated by First Transit, managed by GoTriangle, and funded by the City of Durham. It was renamed under the consolidated GoTransit branding scheme for the Research Triangle region. In 2023, the system had a ridership of 5,417,000, or about 19,700 per weekday as of the first quarter of 2024.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly years\n\n[edit]\n\nThe City of Durham assumed the operation of the local Duke Power bus system in 1991, naming it Durham Area Transit Authority (DATA).[3]\n\n1891–1902 – Durham Street Railway Co.\n\n1902–1913 – Durham Traction Co.\n\n1913–1921 – Durham Traction Co. (Cities Service Co.)\n\n1921–1943 – Durham Public Service Co. (Cities Service Co.)\n\n1930 – streetcars discontinued\n\nAfter 1943 – Duke Power Company\n\n2000s & 2010s\n\n[edit]\n\nDATA Upgrades\n\n[edit]\n\nTo benefit more riders in safety and accessibility, DATA purchased 31 new Gillig Low Floors in 2002. The first bus arrived on April 16, 2003. The next day on April 17, the bus ran in revenue service on Route 7. The first bus ran through all routes to attract passengers of the fleet. These included LED destination signs, longer 40-foot buses, and automated announcements.[4]\n\nService Expansions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2005, DATA collaborated and funded with Capital Area Transit (now GoRaleigh) and Triangle Transit Authority (now GoTriangle) to create a route connecting the DATA Downtown Terminal with the Brier Creek Shopping Center in Raleigh. The new route, designated 15, began in November 2005.[5]\n\nThe downtown terminal, located at Great Jones St and W Main St, was relocated to a new transportation center, named Durham Station. This also serves the GoTriangle and Greyhound Lines buses on February 22, 2009. It later served Megabus and FlixBus. The building was designed by the Freelon group.[6] Triangle Transit decided to merge operations with DATA in 2010. As a result, DATA was dissolved, with Triangle Transit (now GoTriangle) handling management, planning, and marketing. The first major thing they did was in 2011, when DATA, along with GoTriangle began the Designing Better Bus Service project, a project offering the following improvements:\n\nBetter on-time performance.\n\nRevamped routes, with new diversions.\n\nImproved bus stop and route alignment.\n\nThese revamped routes debuted in two phases. Phase One, which affected routes 1 (became 1/1A/1B/1N), 6 (became 6/6B), and 11 (became 11/11B) began on September 29, 2012. The rest of the routes were changed on January 9, 2013.[7]\n\nDATA to GoDurham\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, as part of the GoTransit naming scheme, DATA was renamed GoDurham. Total ridership, for the fiscal year 2015 was almost 6.3 million ridership.[8] To plan enhance service, GoTriangle introduced GoDurham's Short-Range Transit Plan in April 2019.[9] This plan intended to speed up service while the original 2017 and current revision of the Durham Transit Plan were being done. These improvements were:\n\nFurther improve on-timer performance\n\nSimplify routes, removing variations to make them more direct.\n\nIntroduce micro-transit on select areas.\n\nAdd better service to reduce wait times, introducing the Frequent Service Network program.\n\nAdd more direct, crosstown routes.\n\nThey offered the changes GoDurham can in the upcoming years. The plan was done by late 2019 and by January 2020, the new routes began running service. However, the implementation of the plan was slowed and eventually halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2020s\n\n[edit]\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the pandemic, GoDurham service ran normally until March 20. Service was reduced, as service was scheduled to end at 9:30 pm, similar to Sundays. On March 22, fare collections were suspended, and rear-door boarding was allowed. However, on March 30, GoDurham severely reduced service as operators start to drop. The following service changes included reductions of service to hourly or every 2 hours.\n\nIn April, bus capacity was reduced to 16 passengers max. Seats were taped off from buses to prioritize social distancing. However, in May, they reduced service to a modified Sunday schedule. This took effect on May 4. This was short-lived as on May 18, some service was restored. By June 29, GoDurham restored all bus service back to pre-COVID service patterns. In October 2020, GoDurham expanded service with the Short-Range Transit Plan, adding 15-minute service to Fayetteville St and adding better weekday evening and weekend service to various routes.\n\nRestoration\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 29, 2021, service was reduced due to another operator shortage. The following service reductions included, reversing the improvements and suspending certain routes. However, in late 2021, GoDurham slowly restored service again. Such as the 5K and the 10B routes restored.[10]\n\nDuring 2022, further service restorations occurred. To provide lost service to Croasdaile Crossings previously served by the 1 route, on February 1, 2022, route 6 service was extended to serve Croasdaile Crossings during weekday daytime hours.[11] Major restorations occurred on October 28, when GoDurham restored 15-minute service, discontinuing the 5K route again, minor changes to the 11/11B routes, and restoring the 12B route.\n\nService started to be mostly restored in February 13, full service returned on route 7.[12] On June 24, routes 2, 8, 11/11B were restored to full frequencies and service. In October, GoDurham plans to get full service restored by early 2024.[13] On November 11, routes 1 and 4 will have restored overnight service, Frequent Service Network on route 5 will be active on Saturdays, and 10/10B will have expanded service.[14]\n\nFares & Service Hours\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrently GoDurham is fare-free until summer 2024.\n\nFare Type Single-Way 1 Day Pass 5 Day Pass 7 Day Pass 31 Day Pass Standard $1.00 $2.00 $8.50 $12.00 $36.00 Discount $0.50 $1.00 $4.25 $6.00 $18.00 Student Free with a GoPass Seniors Free without ID\n\nGoDurham currently runs in three service patterns. Weekday daytime hours which runs from 5:30 am to 6:00 pm, weekday evening hours which runs from 6:00 pm to 12:30 am, and Sundays which runs from 7:30 pm to 9:30 pm[15] Sunday-level service is also operated during New Years, MLK Jr. Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving Day.[15] There is no service on Christmas Day. Service operates on Christmas Eve, however, service ends after 7:30 pm.[15]\n\nFleet\n\n[edit]\n\nColor Schemes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fleet livery changed throughout the years. The first ever livery, prior to 2003, had buses utilized blue stripes over a white body. However, with the introduction of Gillig Low Floors in 2003, buses used a white body with red, yellow, and blue stripes.\n\nIn 2010 with the delivery of new Gillig BRT Hybrids, a new livery was created, which featured a brighter color, arc scheme on the buses. As the result of the transition to GoDurham, the livery was changed into a gray body with blue triangles in different hues. Retrofitted buses, which are the buses before the rebranding retain the black trim. All buses delivered after 2017 lack any black trim. The slogan used for the buses was changed to Connecting the Bull City.\n\nCurrent Fleet\n\n[edit]\n\nGoDurham's fixed-route service currently runs 58 vehicles, running on 21 routes. GoDurham currently operates Gillig Low Floor, Gillig BRT, and Gillig Low Floor Plus buses, They currently run diesel, hybrid and electric buses. As part of the clean-energy program, 20 Gillig BRT Hybrids were delivered to the city in 2009–2010.[16] Bicycle racks are fitted to the front of all buses to increase efforts for public transit. All buses are equipped with Wi-Fi on board. USB ports were introduced with the 2018-2019 units. On 2019, GoDurham placed an order for six electric buses. Two of these buses were delivered on Earth Day 2021. The rest of the fleet arrived in 2023, to replace aging units.[17][18] Further, in February 2024 it was announced that 18 more electric buses are to be received in the following two years.[19] As of now, this is the current fleet as of April 2024.[20]\n\nImage Year Bus Name Fleet Numbers Notes 2008 Gillig\n\nLow Floor 40' Diesel\n\n801-806\n\nTotal: 6 units\n\nDelivered in July 2008\n\nRefurbished and repowered in FY 2016-2017\n\n2010 Gillig\n\nBRT HEV 40'\n\n1001-1020, 1201-1204\n\nTotal: 23 units\n\nDelivered in July 2010 and 2012\n\nRepowered in 2018, refurbished in 2021.\n\n1007, is unavailable due to an accident\n\n2012 2017 Gillig\n\nLow Floor 40' Diesel 1701-1712\n\nTotal: 12 units\n\nDelivered by August 2017\n\nExpected to be repowered in 2023.\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n1801-1803, 1901-1904\n\nTotal: 7 units\n\nFirst units delivered in April 2018\n\nThe rest delivered in July–September 2019\n\nOrdered to replace 2003 units.\n\n2021 2103-2110\n\nTotal: 8 units\n\nDelivered January 2022\n\nOrdered to provide more service.\n\nGillig\n\nLow Floor Plus EV 40'\n\n2101-2102\n\nTotal: 2 units\n\n2101-2102 delivered Earth Day 2021\n\nDurham's first-ever electric bus fleet.\n\n2021 2023 2301-2306\n\nTotal: 6 units\n\nSecond batch of electric buses ordered by GoDurham\n\nDelivered in September 2023.\n\nRetired Fleet\n\n[edit]\n\nImage Year Bus Model Fleet Numbers Notes N/A 1992 OBI\n\nOrion I (01.507) 9201-9232\n\n(32 units)\n\nThe first buses were purchased by DATA in 1992 to replace old Duke Power Company units.\n\nOriginally numbered 101–131.\n\nRetired in 2007, replaced by 2003, 2005, and 2008 Gillig Low Floors.\n\nN/A 2000\n\n2001\n\nGillig\n\nPhantom 30' Diesel 0001-0008\n\n0101-0103\n\n(11 units)\n\nReplaced some Orion I's\n\nMainly ran until 2009, and remained in reserve until 2011.\n\nRetired in 2011 by 2008 Gillig Low Floors and 2009-2012 Gillig BRTs\n\n2003 Gillig\n\nLow Floor 40' Diesel 0301-0331\n\n(31 units)\n\nReplaced all Orion I's.

The 18-month plan, which has six projects plans to improve major corridor routes, more attention on both Holloway Street and Fayetteville Street bus lines.[25]\n\nCurrently, GoDurham's planned projects are shown here, expected to be planned and finished by 2023-2024:\n\nBus Access Project[26] - Will allow easier access to bus stops by adding sidewalks 1/4th mile from a GoDurham bus stop.\n\nBus Speed and Reliability Project[27] - Allows for the improvement of bus service by prioritizing buses in traffic, pavement markings, and better signage.\n\nDurham Station Transit Area[28] - This project will evaluate current streets in Downtown Durham taken by GoDurham buses and improving those streets to speed up service to/from Durham Station\n\nFayetteville Street Corridor[29] - This project would allow major improvements around Fayetteville Street like enhanced bus stops, better traffic, and safer access which will increase reliability, safety, and will speed up the route.\n\nHolloway Street Corridor and Village Transit Center[30] - This project will allow the same enhancements on Holloway Street. This will also allow major upgrades on The Village Shopping Center.\n\nBus Stop Balancing Study - Will remove low ridership stops and modify existing stops to increase service reliability.[31]\n\nDurham Transit Plan\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Durham Transit Plan is the plan for GoDurham's long-term future bus improvements for the city by 2040.[32] In April 2011, Durham County added a sales tax for public transit to allow this plan to happen. This plans allows for the improvement of bus stops, acquire electric vehicles, and increased 30 and 15-minute service. Durham was recently awarded $10.8 million in funding, which will allow GoDurham to advance with this plan.[18]\n\nCurrent Progress\n\n[edit]\n\nThe program is currently in its middle phase. This has affected the system already. Current changes since November 2022 are:\n\nCreating brand new bus terminals in The Streets at Southpoint and Glenview Station as part of their Bus Stop Improvement program.[33]\n\nImproving 90 bus stops with benches and/or adding shelters.\n\nOrder six electric buses, two of them have since been delivered.\n\nIncreasing 30-minute service on overnights and Sundays on routes 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 10, and 11.\n\nAdding all or some 15-minute service or Frequent Service Network on routes 5, 3/3B/3C, 2/12/12B, and 11/11B.\n\nMicro transit on the East and North Durham Zones, now named Durham Connect\n\n2024-2028 Short Range Transit Plan\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the summer of 2023, GoDurham and GoTriangle provided the draft for the new Short-Range Transit Plan., which is planned to redesign the bus network in Durham from 2024 to 2028.[34] Funding has been approved for these services, which the changes would happen between 2024 and 2028.
