        "text": "Most operators in the Durham, Northumberland and Tyne & Wear regions are participating in the scheme and the products are valid on the majority of services. Tickets are also valid on cross boundary services into Tees Valley, but not for onwards travel.\n\nThere are a limited number of services where these products will not be valid, including tour buses, match day services and some school services.\n\nTickets can be purchased in advance online or through operator apps, as well as being available to purchase on the bus – just ask the driver for the named ticket above.\n\nProducts that are valid in the Tyne & Wear area can also be purchased on Metro ticket machines.\n\nThis will depend on which operator you are travelling with and the type of ticket machine they have.\n\nWhere a QR code is generated on your ticket, this should be scanned on services where ticket machines facilitate this. If the ticket purchased does not have a QR code, just show the ticket to the driver on all subsequent trips. You will also be able to show the ticket to Tyne and Wear Metro staff to gain access through the barriers.\n\nGo North East and Arriva services have ticket machines where QR codes will be printed and scanned for each journey.\n\nTickets purchased through Stagecoach and Metro will not produce QR codes.\n\nA ticket cannot be re-issued during its validity, and therefore a decision needs to be made in advance of purchasing your ticket as to which product will offer the best value.\n\nIn 2025, we are aiming to implement smart capping which will enable flexibility so the best value fare will be calculated automatically.\n\nFrom 16 June 2024, Tees Valley will also be using BSIP funding to match our offer for customers 21 and under. Customers boarding in the North East Combined Authority area can use their ticket on the cross boundary services listed below into Tees Valley, but not for onwards travel. Customers boarding in Tees Valley with a Tees Valley ticket will also be accepted on the below services into the North East Combined Authority area, but these tickets will also not be valid for onwards travel.\n\nService 1 (Tow Law - Darlington),\n\nService 5 (Bishop Auckland - Darlington),\n\nService 7 (Durham - Darlington),\n\nService 8 (Spennymoor - Darlington),\n\nService X10 (Newcastle - Middlesbrough),\n\nService X12 (Newcastle - Middlesbrough),\n\nService X22 (Sunderland - Durham),\n\nService 23 (Sunderland - Hartlepool),\n\nService 24 (Durham - Hartlepool),\n\nService 59 (Durham - Hartlepool),\n\nService X75/X76 (Barnard Castle - Darlington).\n\nFor journeys over the western (Cumbria) and Northern (Scotland) borders, eligibility remains unchanged with tickets only valid for journeys wholly within the North East Combined Authority region."
