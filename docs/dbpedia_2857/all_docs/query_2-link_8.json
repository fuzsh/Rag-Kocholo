        "text": "DURHAM, N.C. (WTVD) -- A group of GoDurham drivers are rallying to demand Durham City Council address the violence involving city buses and near bus stops.\n\nThey want the city council to work with the police chief and district attorney to step up prosecution for violence that affects bus passengers and drivers.\n\nLast July, a Raleigh man was shot and killed near a bus stop near the Wellons Village Shopping Center in Durham.\n\nAccording to the news release, last November, someone sprayed a GoDurham bus with bullets. No arrest has been made.\n\nThis incident left several holes in the bus' windows and a hole in a window frame on the side of the bus.\n\n\"Luckily, none of those bullets struck anyone on the bus, but the passengers and the driver of that bus must carry the terror of those moments with them for the rest of their lives,\" Sara Maxwell, a GoDurham bus driver, said.\n\nThe drivers addressed the city council Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"We will not stand idly by as our brothers and sisters come under the line of fire and no arrests are made,\" one driver said.\n\nOne of the drivers who spoke was behind the wheel during that deadly November shooting.\n\nThe day my bus got shot up, I came home, I shared it with my wife and my kids,\" said Julian Mack. \"And you know we all got things going on every day, and on my way to work, I say a prayer, that I can get back home to my wife and kids.\"\n\nMayor Leonardo Williams said the city will work with the company that manages GoDurham.\n\n\"I don't want to get too technical, but there is a middle operator between the city and our drivers, but these are our drivers, they're our residents, and I want to make sure you're heard, and make sure we're communicating with them.\"\n\nDrivers asked the city to ensure their safety and prosecute those responsible for serious and violent crimes."
