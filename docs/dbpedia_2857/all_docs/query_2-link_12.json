        "text": "Keep in Touch\n\nBuses & Transportation\n\nHere are a few tips for ensuring proper bus assignment for your child:\n\nBus routes are determined by the DPS Transportation Dept, which can be contaced with questions or concerns at 919-560-BUSS.\n\nSign up for the Edulog app to track the location and schedule of your child's bus.\n\nWhen registering your child for school, please make sure that you check ‘Y’ (Yes) for morning and/or afternoon transportation in the school bus transportation box on the student data sheet. If your child was pre-registered, please call the school to confirm that the appropriate transportation requests are indicated on the student data sheet.\n\nPlease notify the school if your child needs an alternate bus stop location such as daycare, for either morning or afternoon.\n\nIt is equally important to notify us if your child does NOT need transportation.\n\nTo ensure that your child has an assigned stop on the first day of school, please notify your school of a change in address or alternate location three weeks prior to the first day of school.\n\nFor more information about transportation services, please visit the DPS website at https://www.dpsnc.net/transportation."
