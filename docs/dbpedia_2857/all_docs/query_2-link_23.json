        "text": "I operate a home day care and the state requires me to keep the children in view. Can a bus stop be set up at my home?\n\nNo. All regular education bus stops are placed at centrally located Intersections. Daycare providers carry the same responsibility as parents/guardians and are responsible for ensuring that students arrive safely at their assigned bus stop.\n\nCan my student get a closer bus stop because of a certain medical condition, such as asthma, broken bones?\n\nSome medical conditions may require an accommodation as a provision of the Rehabilitation Act Section 504 (504 plan), which could make a non-eligible student eligible for bus transportation or warrant a relocated stop for a current rider. Contact the health specialist at your student’s school to inquire about eligibility for a 504 plan.\n\nThe bus drives right by my house. Why can’t it stop at my house?\n\nWe are a mass transportation system with the guiding principle of safety. We do not have the combination of time and resources to provide that level of service in an equitable manner to all students. Statistics show that it is safer and more economical for buses to stop at corner intersection collector points within a neighborhood.\n\nI feel the bus stop is too far from my home, can the stop be moved closer?\n\nBus stops are located at centralized locations for efficiency and to allow for equitable placement of the bus stop for all registered students. The District attempts to keep the number of stops minimized, thus keeping the buses moving and reducing ride times for all students. If you have a concern about your child's safety, you are encouraged to accompany your child to the bus stop.\n\nIf you still feel there is a safety concern beyond the line of sight of the bus stop, complete and submit your bus stop change request online. We do not accept bus stop change requests via email or telephone.\n\nI can't see my child at the bus stop, can the bus stop be moved closer to my house?\n\nDue to variances in topography, neighborhood and home design, and other factors beyond our control, line of site is not a criterion to stop creation. Bus stops are designed to be collector points for students. District school bus stops are placed at centralized locations for efficiency purposes and to allow for equitable stop placement for all students. If you have a concern about your child's safety, you are encouraged to accompany your child to the bus stop.\n\nIf you still feel there is a safety concern beyond the line of sight of the bus stop, complete and submit your bus stop change request online. We do not accept bus stop change requests via email or telephone."
