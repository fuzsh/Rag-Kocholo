        "text": "As the district transportation provider, Durham School Services (DSS) transports over 1,100 students to more than a dozen different facilities throughout the district through our fleet of buses dedicated to regular education students in grades K-12. To ensure the safety and quality of our transportation services, our fleet undergoes annual inspections conducted by the Michigan State Police. For the past 15 years, BPS buses have consistently received an \"Excellent\" rating during these inspections.\n\nApart from serving regular education students, we also operate 11 special-education bus routes that cater to students attending 14 in-district buildings and 12 out-of-district locations for specific programs. Additionally, DSS actively collaborates with neighboring school districts as part of a regional transportation program in Oakland County's southeast quadrant. This collaboration allows us to extend our services to Pontiac, West Bloomfield, Bloomfield, and Berkley students who attend the same out-of-district schools as BPS students.\n\nTo meet the instructional needs of smaller classes within Ernest W. Seaholm and Wylie E. Groves high schools, DSS provides shuttle services between these two campuses.\n\nOur commitment at DSS is not only limited to transporting students but also ensuring their safety and well-being throughout their journey between home and school."
