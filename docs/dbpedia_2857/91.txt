Planning permission has been granted for a new transport hub in the heart of County Durham.

Durham County County Council has approved plans for the redevelopment of Durham Bus Station as part of a wider strategy to support the region’s economic recovery.

Under the plans, the existing Durham Bus Station on North Road is set to be demolished, and in its place a new transport hub will be constructed.

The new bus station has been designed to increase the overall space for passengers, as well as provide improved facilities such as increased toilet provision and seating in the passenger circulation and waiting areas.

Work on the new station is set to begin next spring and is scheduled to be open by Summer 2022.

Cllr Carl Marshall, Durham County Council’s Cabinet member for economic regeneration, said: “We’re delighted to be moving on to the next stage of the regeneration of North Road, with the investment in a brand new, state-of-the-art bus station for our residents, visitors, and businesses.

“The new station has been designed to create a modern transport hub that fits the historic nature of Durham but also is a safe and welcoming space for those who are coming and going from the city.

“As plans have been approved, we can now all look forward to construction starting which will bring us this new, spacious and accessible station. Our plan for Durham Bus Station is part of a wider vision to improve transport links, which in turn will help boost our economy, and enhance towns and villages across the county.”
