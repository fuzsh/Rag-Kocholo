Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds are set to return to the site where they were originally created to mark the show's 50th anniversary.

Three new episodes, starring the show's iconic puppets, including Lady Penelope and Parker, will be produced at Slough Trading Estate in Berkshire.

The children's TV programme was written and filmed at the site of the estate between 1964 and 1966.

The project will use audio recordings of the original voice cast.

As well as these recordings, which were first released in 1966, the Thunderbirds 1965 project will feature recreated puppets and sets.
