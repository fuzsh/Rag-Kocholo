        "text": "How to Block Emails on Gmail\n\nGmail provides two methods to stop unwanted emails ‒ blocking certain senders or entire domain names.\n\nBlocking Unwanted Senders\n\nThis method is ideal for blocking unwanted emails from individual email addresses. Here’s how to do it on the Gmail web app:\n\nAccess your Gmail inbox and open an email from the sender you want to block.\n\nClick More (three vertical dots icon) next to the Reply button and select Block “Sender”.\n\nA pop-up will inform you that Google will mark this sender’s incoming mail as spam. Click Block to confirm.\n\nFollow the same steps to block an email address on the Gmail app.\n\nBlocking Domain Names\n\nBlocking email addresses doesn’t always work because spammers can easily create new ones. Luckily, Gmail lets you block an entire domain to stop all communications from that particular sender.\n\nFollow these steps to block entire domains from reaching your inbox:\n\nAfter logging into your Gmail account, select Show search options on the right side of the search bar.\n\nEnter the domain name you want to block in the From field and click Create filter.\n\nCheck the Delete it option to automatically delete emails from the targeted domain. Click Create filter to apply the rule to future messages.\n\nManaging Filtered Emails and Blocked Senders\n\nIf you accidentally blocked an email or filtered out a domain, here’s how to undo it:\n\nAccess Settings (gear icon) on the top toolbar and select See all settings.\n\nOpen the Filters and Block Addresses tab to see all the blocked addresses and filtered domains.\n\nSelect delete to remove the filter and hit unblock to allow emails from a previously blocked sender.\n\nWhile Gmail allows up to 1,000 filtering rules, having too many of them can slow down your account. Regularly review and delete unnecessary filters for optimal performance.\n\nSuggested Reading\n\nRead our guide to integrating a custom domain with a Gmail account to benefit from the email client’s convenient interface.\n\nHow to Block Emails on Apple Mail\n\nSetting up your email account on Apple Mail lets you use the blocking feature across all Apple devices. We’ll explore how to block unwanted emails on mobile and desktop.\n\nBlocking Emails for macOS\n\nHere’s how to block emails on the Mac Mail app:\n\nOpen the email you want to block.\n\nIn the message header, click on the dropdown menu next to their name.\n\nSelect Block Contact.\n\nLike other email clients, you can also create filters to block emails from specific senders automatically. Here’s how:\n\nHead to Settings (gear icon) → Rules.\n\nSelect Add New Rule, then set its name, rules, and actions. Click Add to save it.\n\nApple Mail only applies the first matching rule, so drag and drop your rules based on their priority. Click on a rule to modify or remove.\n\nBlocking Emails for iPhone or iPad\n\nHere’s what you can do to block email senders from the Mail app on iOS:\n\nOpen the spam email you want to block on the Mail app.\n\nTap the sender’s name in the message header and choose Block this Contact.\n\nRead the disclaimer and tap Block this Contact to confirm.\n\nFollow these steps to manage your blocked senders list:\n\nGo to Settings → Mail on your iOS device.\n\nAccess Blocked under the Threading section.\n\nTap Edit to manage the blocked addresses or Add New.\n\nTo customize actions on blocked emails, go to Blocked Sender Options within the Threading section.\n\nChoose Move to Trash or Leave in Inbox.\n\nHow to Block Emails on Outlook\n\nAs part of the Microsoft Office Suite, Outlook provides the block functionality to enhance communication quality. Like other email clients, this email client lets you block unwanted emails from specific addresses and senders.\n\nBlocking Unwanted Emails\n\nHere’s how to stop receiving emails from a specific mail address on Outlook webmail and desktop app:\n\nLog in to your Outlook account and open the email from the sender you want to block.\n\nSelect More Actions (three horizontal dots icon) → Block → Block Sender.\n\nBlocking Senders and Managing Block List\n\nTo block certain domains, you have to add them to the block list in Junk Mail. You can use the same steps to block emails and manage the blocked senders list.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nGo to Settings (gear icon) in the top menu bar.\n\nWithin the Mail section, open Junk Mail.\n\nUnder Blocked senders and domains, click + Add.\n\nEnter the email addresses or domains that send spam to the blocked list.\n\nOnce you’re done, click Save.\n\nOutlook sets the maximum rule size at 256 KB per mailbox. As some rules can take more space than others, it’s best to manage the blocked senders list periodically and remove the ones you no longer need.\n\nDo You Like Outlook’s Interface?\n\nCheck out our guide for instructions on setting up a custom email address on Microsoft Outlook.\n\nHow to Block Emails on Yahoo\n\nYahoo’s blocking method is similar to other email clients, allowing up to 1,000 blocked emails per account. However, free users can only block up to three domains. You can upgrade to Yahoo Mail Plus for $5/month to raise the limit to 500 domains per account.\n\nUtilizing Email Blocker\n\nHere’s how to block an email address on the web version:\n\nLog in to your Yahoo account and open the mail you want to block.\n\nAccess More (three horizontal dots icon) and click Unsubscribe if it’s a marketing email or Block Senders to stop receiving all emails from that address.\n\nA pop-up will ask whether you wish to block the sender’s address and delete emails you have already received. Check the preferred options and click OK to confirm.\n\nImplementing Sender Blocking\n\nYou can also add blocked addresses and domains to security settings. Here’s how:\n\nNavigate to Settings (gear icon) → More Settings from the Yahoo dashboard.\n\nAccess Security and privacy and click Add under Blocked Addresses to target specific emails. Alternatively, add domains under Block unwanted sender domains to stop emails from specific resources.\n\nYahoo’s block list lacks an editing feature. If you add the wrong address or domain, click on the trash icon next to it and repeat the steps.\n\nHow to Block Emails on Hostinger Email\n\nHostinger Email includes advanced spam-blocking tools alongside standard anti-spam measures. If you want to stop receiving emails from specific senders, create email filters to delete or redirect them to a separate folder.\n\nSetting Up Email Filters\n\nTo set up email filters in Hostinger webmail for blocking unwanted emails and domains, follow these steps:\n\nLog in to hPanel and go to Emails → Email Accounts.\n\nScroll down until you reach the Manage Email Accounts section.

The email client doesn’t specify the limit for blocking emails and domains. For best performance, review the block list regularly to keep the number of entries low.\n\nUtilizing the Block Feature\n\nFollow these steps to block an email address on the Proton Mail web app:\n\nLog in to your Proton Mail account and open the email you wish to block.\n\nClick the sender’s address and choose Block messages from this sender to stop receiving unwanted emails.\n\nRead the disclaimer and click Block.\n\nThe block will affect all Proton platforms, including the mobile version.\n\nSetting Up Custom Filters\n\nThis method involves adding unwanted email addresses and domains to the block list. Here’s how:\n\nGo to Settings (gear icon) → All settings from the dashboard.\n\nOpen the Filters section, where you can create and manage filters, as well as add addresses and domains to the block list. Let’s do the former by clicking Add filter.\n\nEnter the filter name and click Next.\n\nSet the conditions to trigger the filter. In this example, we set the filter to flag messages sent by “domain.com” or containing the phrase “Sign up today” or “Dear recipient” in the subject. Click Next.\n\nSpecify the action for messages that meet the filter’s rules. Here, we set the filter to redirect flagged messages to the spam folder.\n\nOnce you’re done, click Save.\n\nManaging Custom Filters and Block List\n\nReturn to the Filters section to add, edit, or remove filters, addresses, or domains.\n\nWith custom filters, select the toggle next to your chosen filter to activate or deactivate it. Open the dropdown menu and hit Apply to existing messages to filter emails you have already received. Select Delete to remove the filter permanently.\n\nAs for the spam, block, and allow lists, select the three horizontal dots and choose the appropriate label."
