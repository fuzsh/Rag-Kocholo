        "text": "Just for the record. The winged biomass we ogled at the Bluecreek Property today. Trumped any flock I’ve ogled in the Southern Hemisphere on my three pilgrimages to the Land of Argentina. Absolute epitome of hard work, like-mindness, habitat acquisition, and management. All involved should be PROUD. Epic example of conservation and habitat development. Leaving things better for the ducks and our kids/grandkids. Hats off to all you boys for whatchall do!!! I’m still getting goosebumps from the amount of duck flesh on the wing!! Errrrrrrah!!\n\n[THC] are group of people who enjoy the outdoor hunting lifestyle. A Club that is well organized yet allows all the members to participate. Best managed and organized hunting club that I have had the pleasure of being a member. Extremely fair in the way hunting spots are picked for each group. Club properties are managed in a manner that gives each hunting group optimum chance to hunt ducks.\n\nReputation for quality properties under lease. Relations with landowners is good; club management has been successful in maintaining long term agreements which enhances ability to maintain quality habitat. Properties managed on par with the top end clubs with respect to habitat. The club has a record of consistently good habitat regardless of weather conditions. Pond rotation strategy best I’ve seen. Management communicates well and accepts feedback with an open mind. Members expected to contribute time and effort to maintain and improve the club. We are a “do it yourself” club. Members are avid waterfowlers and outdoorsmen. Our blind partners are also our friends. We have many long-term members and have opportunities of watching their kids grow up. We are not a “commercial club” We do have corporate members, but they are not given preference in blind selection. I know I could pay more but don’t believe I could the same value anywhere on the Texas Coast. The lodge strikes the right balance between function and operating cost. I also like the ability to use it year round. Where else can you blast and cast without getting in a boat?"
