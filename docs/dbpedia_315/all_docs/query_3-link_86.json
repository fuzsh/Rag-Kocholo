After a long time trying to send it comes up with the following message :-\n\nSending of the message failed.\n\nUnable to authenticate to Outgoing server (SMTP) mail.btinternet.com. Please check the password and verify the 'Authentication method' in 'Account Settings | Outgoing server (SMTP)'.\n\nI had recently changed the BT email address and gave that to Thunderbird at the first receive attempt. Nothing else has changed for several years and the Outgoing Server (SMTP) settings are :-\n\nDescription : BT Mail\n\nServer Name : mail.btinternet.com\n\nPort : 465\n\nUser Name : .................@btinternet.com\n\nAuthentication Method : Normal password\n\nConnection Security : SSL/TLS\n\nI've tried the trick of switching off the Homehub for half an hour in the hope of getting a different server but the problem is still there. Any ideas?\n\n@TimCurtis\n\nThe settings that you are using are not secure and are not recommended. Using port 25 has not been the ideal port to use since the early 1980s. Most ISP and email providers no longer use that port. I am surprised your email is still working when you use that port because I thought BT had also stopped its use on its systems.\n\nThe correct settings for BTMail are as per this think.\n\nWhat are the settings for outgoing and incoming BT Email servers? | BT Help\n\nThanks for your reply. I am a BT Broadband customer. Just days before my problems started I was persuaded to start a new 24 month contract at slightly reduced cost. When I received the details of this I noticed that I was now on Halo 3 with a guaranteed download of 10 Mbps whereas my old contract was on Halo 1 with a guaranteed download of 17 Mbps! When I queried this I was told that Halo 1 is no longer available and my new maximum speed was the best they could guarantee in my area. Could this switch have anything to do with my Thunderbird problem?\n\n@Bextonian wrote:\n\nCould this switch have anything to do with my Thunderbird problem?\n\nNo.\n\nCan you clarify what you mean when you said \"I had recently changed the BT email address and gave that to Thunderbird at the first receive attempt\".\n\nI would suggest that if you have not changed any settings in T'bird or changed your password that you check that you can still access and send/receive using your email account on webmail using this link. BTMail .\n\nIf you can it would indicate that there is nothing wrong with your email account in which case I would suggest that the best course if action is to do nothing. It is probably a BT server issue and when that happens it usually resolves its self in a few days."
