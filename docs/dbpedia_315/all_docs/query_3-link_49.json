(That is, the literal word \"locked\", or any other word without an @ in it.)\n\nThunderbird considers that to be an invalid address, and won't let you send the message until you delete the invalid address.\n\nIt will look like this:\n\nAnd when you try to send:\n\nBased on the \"better late than never\" principle: using the Correct Identity extension, you could configure a nonsense address that, if included as recipient, prompts an extra confirmation.\n\nThis would allow you to flexibly 'request' the extra confirmation by adding that address as recipient. For example, you can add \"[email protected]\" in the \"Safety\" list (or simply 'confirmation'). Prior to sending, the extension checks for matches to that list, and requests extra confirmation if a match is found.\n\nYou could then remove the address again if you're sure you want to send the email.\n\nI admit, it's a work-around, but it works quite well for me.\n\nYou might want to have a look at Thunderbird add-ons. For instance, Confirm-Address.\n\nConfirm E-mail address before sending mail\n\nYou may also be interested by Flex Confirm Email which seems to include some rule-based mechanism.\n\nConfirm mail address and attachments based on flexible rules.\n\nFinally, if you are familiar with PGP signing and encrypting, you are probably using the Enigmail extension. If so, have a look at its settings: Sending > Confirm before sending > Always.\n\nYou can install add-ons through the Tools > Add-ons menu in Thunderbird. Here is a link to the search results I used (Mozilla Thunderbird Add-ons) for this answer, you might find more suitable add-ons there."
