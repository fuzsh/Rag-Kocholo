It was superceded by the Thunderbird 2, which entered service with the Heavy Air Defence Regiments of the Royal Artillery in 1965-66. Thunderbird 2 had an improved guidance system and was capable of engaging targets at much lower altitudes, but was withdrawn from service in the 1980s, when it was replaced by the Rapier anti-aircraft missile.\n\nHistory note\n\nThe British Aircraft Corporation Thunderbird, a highly mobile surface-to-air guided missile designed to engage fast high flying aircraft, was first introduced into service with the British Army in 1960.
