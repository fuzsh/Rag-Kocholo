        "text": "If it’s in only one place, it’s not backed up.\n\nUsing a desktop email program to back up email avoids potential data loss. I'll show you how using Outlook.com and Thunderbird as examples.\n\nMany years ago, I received a panic-stricken email from an individual whose account had been hacked. He had lost all access. His panic stemmed from the fact that, for whatever reason, the account held the only copy of his master’s thesis.\n\nIt was gone, and there was no hope of recovery.\n\nHopefully, you’re not keeping something as important as a master’s thesis only in your online email account. That’s wrong on many levels. But I’m sure there are things in your account you never want to lose, such as photos, correspondence, or other things you’ve exchanged via email.\n\nThe problem is, of course, that if it’s only in your email account, it’s not backed up.\n\nLet’s fix that. Let’s back up your email.\n\nOur example: Outlook.com and Hotmail\n\nFor this article, I’m going to use a Hotmail account: askleoexample@hotmail.com. I’ll continue to access that account as I usually do, using the Outlook.com website, but we’ll back it up to my PC using Thunderbird.\n\nThe technique I’ll use applies to almost all online accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo!, and others. For this technique to work, the account must support a protocol called IMAP. The good news is that IMAP is common; almost all email services support it.\n\nIn this example, I’ll use Thunderbird as my desktop email program, but any desktop program supporting IMAP can back up your email, including Microsoft Office Outlook and others.\n\nInstall Thunderbird\n\nThe first step is to download and install Thunderbird. Download Thunderbird from the official download site here.\n\nAt this writing, the official URL is https://www.thunderbird.net.\n\nDownload and run the Setup Wizard.\n\nThe first choice is whether to accept the Standard settings or use Custom.\n\nAlways choose Custom. Even though we’re going to accept all suggestions made by the installer, choosing Custom is an important habit to avoid malware and PUPs. Click Next through the subsequent settings, and accept:\n\nCreate icons on the Desktop and Start Menu.\n\nThe installation location for Thunderbird.\n\nIf there are additional options, read them carefully to make sure you understand what you are agreeing to.\n\nClick Install on the last page of the Wizard to install Thunderbird.\n\nWhen the installation is complete, leave “Launch Mozilla Thunderbird now” checked, and click Finish.\n\nThunderbird may offer to import settings from another mail program if one is installed. Our goal is to use Thunderbird simply for backup, so there’s no need.\n\nConfiguring Thunderbird for a Hotmail account\n\nWhen you first install Thunderbird, there are no email accounts configured. Thunderbird proceeds to the “Setup an Existing Account” dialog.\n\nEnter your name, email address, and password. In my case, I’ll enter “Ask Leo! – askleo.com” as my name, “askleoexample@hotmail.com” as my email address, and the password for that account.\n\nSelect Remember password if this computer is secure and you don’t want to type in your password every time you fire up Thunderbird.\n\nClick on Continue, and Thunderbird will consult its own database of email providers for the correct settings. Hotmail is in that database.\n\nMake sure that IMAP is selected and click Done.\n\nIf you have two-factor authentication enabled, you may be prompted by your email service to verify your identity or your sign-in will fail. You’ll need to check with your provider for the technique to be used with a desktop email program. It typically involves creating what’s called an “app password” to be used here instead of your normal password. You’ll find more information here: I Enabled Two-Factor Authentication and Now My Email Program Can’t Log In.\n\nThunderbird is now configured to access your Hotmail account and will begin downloading your mail.\n\nUsing Thunderbird\n\nThe benefit of using IMAP is that the email program downloads a copy to your computer, creating a backup of your email. You can continue to use your email normally via the Outlook.com web interface, your mobile device, or wherever else you’ve been accessing it.\n\nYou can, if you like, use Thunderbird to actually read, compose, and reply to messages. Email you read here will be marked as read elsewhere. Any change you make, such as moving emails to folders, deleting emails, or otherwise managing your messages, will show up in all the places you access your email.\n\nSince IMAP mirrors the activity on your online account to your PC, it will mirror deletions as well. Delete a message online, and the next time you connect Thunderbird, the message will be deleted locally. Backing up your PC regularly may provide you with an additional safety net, since the Thunderbird repository would be included in those backups as well.\n\nBacking up contacts\n\nTo back up contacts, you need to manually export them from your email provider. Contacts are not included in the email protocol and thus are not included in anything we’ve done so far.\n\nClick on the contacts/people icon in the lower left of the Outlook.com display.\n\nOn the People page, click the Manage menu item, and then on Export contacts.\n\nSave the downloaded file somewhere on your computer, ideally in a place that will also be backed up by your regular PC backups.\n\nYou can, if you like, import these contacts into Thunderbird, but since our goal here is to back them up, just downloading the file to our computer is enough.\n\nBack up your email\n\nIf you don’t use Thunderbird regularly, it’s important to run it periodically to perform its backup. Once a day, once a week, or a couple of times a month, depending on how current you want your backup to be, run Thunderbird and keep it running until it’s downloaded a copy of all updates to your mail.\n\nSince there’s no automated download of your contacts, you’ll need to do that regularly as well.\n\nThe good news is that your email is backed up! Particularly when used in conjunction with ongoing PC backups, you’re well protected against data loss due to account theft or other problems.\n\nBut I still wouldn’t keep the only copy of my master’s thesis there. That’s worth a few more copies in other locations for safekeeping.\n\nPodcast audio"
