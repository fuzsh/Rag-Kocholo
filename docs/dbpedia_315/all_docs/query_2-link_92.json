        "text": "In Thunderbird (a popular open source email client), there is an extension store similar to Mozilla Firefox which adds further functionality to the client. Mozilla has an article detailing the security and safety of Firefox extensions (see Tips for assessing the safety of an extension). They state:\n\nWhen a developer submits an extension to addons.mozilla.org, it’s scanned for a set of common issues. It may also be subject to human review. But neither of these processes guarantee that an extension is absolutely 100% safe. With permissions messages, you can see what data and features an extension wants to access, so you can make more informed choices about the software you’re considering.\n\nI understand that no application or extension can be 100% safe. Everything on the internet poses a risk. I am curious if Thunderbird add-ons goes through a similar vetting process. In addition, I notice most Thunderbird extensions don't make proper use of permissions.\n\nI found a website stating:\n\nWhen a developer submits an extension to addons.mozilla.org, it’s scanned for a set of common issues. It may also be subject to human review. But neither of these processes guarantee that an extension is absolutely 100% safe.\n\nHowever Thunderbird has been transferred to a subsidiary of Mozilla. Take a look at Wikipedia, which states:\n\nOn January 28, 2020, the Mozilla Foundation announced that the project would henceforth be operating from a new wholly owned subsidiary, MZLA Technologies Corporation, in order to explore offering products and services that were not previously possible and to collect revenue through partnerships and non-charitable donations.\n\nIn addition, the Thunderbird extension support page does not mentioned security at all. I find this odd as for most people, security when it comes to email is a high priority. Email after all is usually the primary method of logging into most websites.\n\nFor myself, the way I have judged most extension's security is by their Github activity, reviews / number of downloads from the Thunderbird Extension page, and finally longevity of the extension. This becomes difficult however as some extensions are maintained by one person. Take for instance the Signature Switch add-on. I find this functionality absolutely vital as I have more than one signature for emails.\n\nWhat are people's thoughts on potential risks? How likely are these plugins malicious? Thunderbird is my favourite email client however its quite limited without the further functionality provided by third party extensions."
