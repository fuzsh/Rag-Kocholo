It allows you to right-click on a message in the message list and immediately do a search in the quick search box for that sender's email address or domain. There are some things to note:\n\nThe Ctrl-Alt-H keyboard shortcut doesn't work in some versions of Thunderbird.\n\nIt includes the display name in the search, not just the email address.\n\nThe domain search parses the address poorly, so you may end up with example.com> in the search box.\n\nYou can't right-click on the sender address in the message panel; only right-clicking in the message list works.\n\nThat said, it does this one job pretty well in my experience.\n\nI don't think there's an easy way to see both send from and to in a single window.\n\nBut you can easily sort by sender from your inbox view, just select an email from that person and click on the From header:\n\nYou can do the same in your \"Sent\" folder too."
