        "text": "Is it possible to assign a public key from your key manager to a particular email address so that Thunderbird 78.6.0 automatically uses that key to encrypt when that email address is in the \"To\" field?\n\nI want Thunderbird (later abbreviated TB) to encrypt an email to my friend, [email protected]. I have a certificate for him which is assigned to his name, firstname, but the certificate doesn't have an email setting. While I ran enigma, I could choose the certificate to use when I sent an email and Enigma (IIRC) would ask if I'd like to make this assignment permanent (a \"per-recipient\" certificate assignment or something like that). I'd often say NO and then have to select the cert manually next time also.\n\nAfter I compose an email to firstname, Thunderbird first says \"Unable to send this message with end-to-end encryption, because there are problems with the keys of the following recipients: [email protected] ... OK?\"\n\nOK! (I click) and then it says \"In order to send... you must obtain and accept...\" and doesn't even present the list of certs (which I have already obtained and accepted) so that I can choose one. It lists the recipient (there's only [email protected]) and I can select it and click \"Manage Keys for selected recipient.\" There are no keys to manage, and no clue as to how one (which is already in my certificate list) can be selected!"
