        "text": "Click here to go back to my tips for your Twilight trip.\n\nThe actual places where Twilight was filmed take place in both Oregon and Washington so you’ll have to plan your time accordingly. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were only able to visit locations in Oregon:\n\nThe Swan house (St. Helens)\n\nParking lot where Edward saves Bella (St. Helens)\n\nThunderbird & Whale Bookstore (St. Helens)\n\nAlley (St. Helens)\n\nBloated Toad restaurant (St. Helens)\n\nPetite Jolie – Angel Hair Salon (St. Helens)\n\nJilly’s (Not a filming location but where they got the prom dresses and set decor from) (St. Helens)\n\nMultnomah Falls (Corbett)\n\nCarver Cafe (Damascus)\n\nThe View Point Inn (Corbett)\n\nCullen House (Portland)\n\nBallerina Studio (Portland)\n\nClick any photo to view it in original size.\n\nClick here for a map to locations in St. Helens.\n\nIf you have any questions you can email me at justnikkitbnet@gmail.com.\n\nThe Swan House\n\nLocation: 184 S 6th St, Saint Helens, OR\n\nThe Swan house was an easy find. I would suggest parking in the parking lot that you’ll come across on your right-hand side before you go up the small hill. The house is within walking distance from the parking lot.\n\nParking Lot, Alley and Thunderbird & Whale Bookstore\n\nLocation: 260 S 2nd St, Saint Helens, OR\n\nTip: Find the parking lot first – it’ll be much easier scouting out the alley and bookstore.\n\nAll three of these locations are right next to each other. When we had first visited the parking lot we had no idea the alley and the bookstore were right within that same area too. We ended up getting lost looking for the bookstore and didn’t realize we were already near it when we had visited the parking lot!\n\nBloated Toad Restaurant\n\nLocation: 330 S 1st St, Saint Helens, OR\n\nWhen we got to this location we couldn’t help but re-enact the scene with Jessica and Angela bumping into Edward and Bella as they were leaving the restaurant 😉\n\nPetite Jolie – Angel Hair Salon\n\nLocation: 251 S 1st St, Saint Helens, OR\n\nI was really excited to visit this place and get a chance to see Catherine Hardwicke’s director’s chair in the window but sadly we came upon a vacant store 😦\n\nJilly’s\n\nLocation: 299 S 1st St, St. Helens, Oregon\n\nI never got a chance to step inside but if you do go for it!\n\nThe View Point Inn\n\nLocation: 40301 East Larch Mountain Road, Corbett, OR\n\nThe View Point Inn is a gorgeous place especially on a sunny day. Enjoy the drive up to it – it’s really beautiful and reminds you a bit of Twilight with all the tress around 🙂\n\nCheck out this great interview with the co-owner of the inn, Geoff Thompson, giving viewers a tour of the Inn and discussing the parts that were filmed there.\n\nDon’t expect to find the place where Jacob finds Bella waiting for Edward outside the inn – that scene was actually shot in Pasdena (tip from Twilight: Director’s Notebook).\n\nMultnomah Falls\n\nLocation: 50000 E Historic Columbia River Hwy, Corbett, OR\n\nYou can see the falls in a quick scene in Twilight – when Edward and Bella are on their way to the baseball field they are on that bridge that is pictured behind us and in that scene you can see the falls in the background.\n\nIf you do come to the falls, take the hike up all the way to the top. It’s hard work – bring a pair of tennis shoes and water! – but the view from the very top is well worth it and absolutely BREATHTAKING.\n\nCarver Cafe\n\nLocation: 16471 S.E. Highway 224, Damascus, OR\n\nI had referenced the address for Carver’s Cafe from Experience Twilight but the GPS didn’t lead us in the right direction with it. It’s because the cafe is actually located in Damascus, not Carver which the website lists it as – just make a note of that when you’re on your way to visit it.\n\nThe first thing I did was look for steak and berry cobbler on the menu ;P Sadly, both of them were not listed. I later learned from my handy dandy Twilight: Director’s Notebook that screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg wrote up the Carver Cafe diner menu after visiting “Forks Coffee Shop” in Forks, WA and reading what they served – that’s how steak and cobbler got included in the movie. If you’re interested you can view Carver’s complete menu here.\n\nDon’t forget! Before you leave, be sure and sign the Twilight fanbook! The waitress who served us said the first fanbook they had had got stolen so they started up a new one, which I believe was 3/4 full of signatures when we were there.\n\nThe Ballet Studio\n\nLocation: 800 SE 10th Avenue, Portland, OR Thank you to @kaseysarah for helping me find this address again! 🙂\n\nThis place was just used for the exterior shots when Bella is headed to meet James.\n\nThe Cullen House\n\nLocation: 3333 NW Quimby St., Portland, OR\n\nUnfortunately, these were the only photos I was able to take. When we visited the place that day it looked like it was moving day for the family who lived here. They looked busy so we didn’t want to bother them with questions.\n\nThe Cullen House is known as “The Hoke House”. Check out this great post about the house with more exterior and interior shots.\n\nPhotos are only allowed from the streets – this is a PRIVATE RESIDENCE.\n\nIt took us a few trips around the block to find the house – it’s tucked away towards the back of all the other residences.\n\nTwilight tidbit from Twilight: Director’s Notebook: Catherine Hardwicke says “I’m trained as an architect and I couldn’t help but do a little digital remodeling and re-landscaping – even on this gorgeous house. Then, when I read Breaking Dawn during editing – I thought – ‘This house sounds big – esp. the wedding scene – I better add another story on it.'” (p. 159)\n\nYou can see the third story added up on top in the still from the movie below.\n\nSources\n\nAll addresses are thanks to Experience Twilight.\n\nTwilight screencaps thanks to Twilight Poison.\n\nAll other images are my own."
