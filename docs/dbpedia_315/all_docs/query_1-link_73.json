When I try to access https://bad-mail-admin.com:465 and it tells me:\n\nThis address uses a network port which is normally used for purposes other than Web browsing. Firefox has canceled the request for your protection.\n\nThen I googled it and found the solution: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1083282\n\nJust go to about:config (\"Preferences\" -> \"General\" -> scroll all the way down -> \"Config Editor\"), right-click anywhere on the page and choose New > String. Create an option named network.security.ports.banned.override, with the value: 465\n\nThen firefox show https://bad-mail-admin.com:465 successfully.\n\nImmediately I realized that Firefox and TB use the same browser engine. So I repeat do it in \"Config Editor\" of TB."
