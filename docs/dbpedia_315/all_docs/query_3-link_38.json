Thunderbird has a built-in option to run a filter on the Inbox every 10 minutes. But This is not adjustable. I am looking for a way to run any specified message filter every 1 minute.\n\nI've searched around and unfortunately (for me) this does not seem to be an issue others are trying to solve.\n\nAny assistance would be appreciated.\n\n(And in the mean time, I will RTFM Thunderbird to see if there is a way I can solve this.)"
