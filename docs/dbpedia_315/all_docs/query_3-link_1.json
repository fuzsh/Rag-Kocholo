Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit to correct: it's not a colour I had defined for a tag, as I had first said.\n\nPS: reinstalling didn't solve it.\n\nHi everyone, longtime user here, actully huge fan. I have Thunderbird installed on two win 10 machines, both updated to the newest version, only installed the google-chat mod.\n\nSince two or so weeks, Thunderbird keeps being stuck at every operation I want it to do. I get mails, its stuck, i send mails, its stuck, i open the app up, its stuck.\n\nDoes anyone know what I should do?"
