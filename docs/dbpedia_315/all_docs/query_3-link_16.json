        "text": "This special program is the first of a two-part series that includes short stories representing the perspective of different cultures or indigenous societies from around the globe. Each story features exceptional, unique art. In “To Seek Far,” we present “Thunderbird” and “Jai Singh’s Dream,” two stories highlighting the theme of developing tools—to seek far.\n\nThunderbird\n\nThe sky is a powerful tool for measuring time, and for the Diné, or Navajo people, the Thunderbird transcends space and time, revealing the passage of seasons and connecting earth and sky.\n\nJai Singh’s Dream\n\nAmid the political chaos of 18th-century India, a great ruler brought the order of the skies down to earth. His giant instruments allowed for precise measurements of stars, planets and the passage of time—and his observatories still stand today!\n\nThere’s more! True to Bays Mountain fashion, we’ll expand upon these two short stories using our theater’s unique projectors. We’ll connect the feather of the Thunderbird story to how we see the night sky and explore other ancient observatories around the world. Come explore how we all interpret the night sky at Bays Mountain Planetarium!\n\nShow length ~35 min.\n\nDid you know that you can purchase tickets online at any time through the City’s CivicRec portal?

This live presentation is enhanced with additional content from our VELVET LED projectors for a wonderful, immersive experience.
