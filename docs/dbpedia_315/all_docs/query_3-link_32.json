        "text": "For the sake of example, we are going to pretend that we are setting up fictional account \"fakeacct@verizon.net\" and the password for logging into that account in webmail is \"fakepassword\" - Again, this is a fictitious account for the sake of an example.\n\nThe settings for using Verizon's servers would be:\n\nIncoming Server: pop.verizon.net\n\nServer Requires Authentication: Yes\n\nUsername: fakeacct\n\nPassword: fakepassword\n\nRequires a Secure Connection (SSL): Yes\n\nPort: 995\n\nOutgoing Server: smtp.verizon.net\n\nServer Requires Authentication: Yes (You can set it to use the same settings as incoming, or manually enter the username and password.)\n\nRequires a Secure Connection (SSL): Yes\n\nPort: 465\n\nIf you are given the option anywhere for Secure Password Authentication (SPA), set it to No or Normal\n\nThese settings should work unless you have a Verizon/Yahoo account, in which case the server names are: incoming.yahoo.verizon.net -and- outgoing.yahoo.verizon.net\n\nIf all of that is set up and it's still not working, your best bet is to provide a screenshot of your settings (with personal information blocked/removed) and any errors you are getting.\n\nIn case someone stumbles across this in August, 2021, who has a verizon.net account.\n\nYou have to log into mail.aol.com first.\n\nThen you will need to 'generate' a new password for Thunderbird (or whatever other third-party app you are using) by following these steps:\n\nhttps://help.aol.com/articles/Create-and-manage-app-password\n\n1. Sign in and go to the AOL Account security page.\n\n2. Click Generate app password or Manage app passwords.\n\n3. Select your app from the drop down menu and click Generate.\n\n4. Follow the instructions below the password.\n\n- Be sure to enter the password into your app without any spaces.\n\n5. Click Done.\n\n6. Use this app password and your email address to sign in to your email app.\n\nYou should get to a screen like this:\n\nCopy and paste that password into your account settings, incoming and outgoing (Thunderbird will ask the first time you try and send out an email).\n\nPain in the butt but it works with both POP3 incoming and smtp outgoing settings, same port numbers as before.\n\nJust saw this info today, and can verify it is accurate.\n\nHowever, as a long time Thunderbird user, I caution Verizon.net customers against planning on establishing a reliable Thunderbird e-mail system using Verizon.net.\n\nMy Verizon web mail (Yahoo) works reliably. Thunderbird (which I greatly prefer) stumbles intermittently for prolonged periods and cannot access the SMTP (outgoing) server (which is Yahoo mail). The result is one can receive mail on TBird but cannot send mail.\n\nThe problem typically resolves with 24 hours with no changes made on my end.\n\nHours spent communicating with Verizon support have failed to resolve the problem.\n\nSince 9/25 evening I have been unable to send e-mail using Verizon.net on TBird. I expect that by tommorrow, it will function again.\n\nLast outage was in August.\n\nIf you can personally tolerate such disruptions go for Thunderbird. I love it."
