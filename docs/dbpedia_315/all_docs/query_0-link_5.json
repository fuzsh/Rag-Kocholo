        "text": "This website contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of applicable securities laws. We are hereby providing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking and may involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Often, but not always, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “continues” or “believes” or the negatives thereof or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.\n\nExcept for statements of historical fact, information contained in this presentation constitutes forward-looking statements and includes, but is not limited to the (i) projected financial performance of Thunderbird Entertainment Inc. (the “Company”); (ii) completion of the offering of subscription receipts and the completion of the reverse takeover transaction with Golden Secret Ventures Ltd.; (iii) the expected development of the Company’s business projects and joint ventures; (iv) execution of the Company’s vision and growth strategy, including future M&A activity and global growth; (v) sources and availability of third party financing for the Company’s projects; (vi) completion of the Company’s projects that are currently in production, development or otherwise under consideration; (vii) renewal of the Company’s current productions; and (viii) future liquidity, working capital and capital requirements.\n\nForward-looking information is based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management made in light of its experience and its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that management believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date that such statements are made, but which may prove to be incorrect.\n\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, which contribute to the possibility that the predicted outcomes may not occur or may be delayed. The risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, that could influence actual results include factors beyond the control of the Company, include (i) risks related to the general nature of the entertainment industry; (ii) risks related to digital media, television and film industries; (iii) global media industry trends; (iv) potential for budget overruns and other production risks; (v) limited ability to exploit current and future film and television content inventory; (vi) changes in applicable regulatory environments; (vii) technological change; (viii) labour relations; (ix) dependence on relationships with content producers and suppliers; (x) customer, distribution or industry segment concentration risks; (xi) dependence on relationships with customers and distribution partners; (xii) fluctuations in financial results; (xii) competition; (xiv) dependence on key personnel; (xv) protection of intellectual property; (xvi) impact of fluctuations in exchange rates; (xvii) reliance on distribution of Canadian content and government funding; and (xviii) international distribution activities.\n\nAccordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking information, except as, and to the extent required by, applicable securities laws."
