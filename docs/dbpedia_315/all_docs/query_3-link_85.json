        "text": "The Queens County Farm Museum recently hosted a major event celebrating American Indian culture with the 45th annual Thunderbird American Indian Powwow.\n\nA key feature of the powwow is the dance competition, where participants from 40 tribes showcase their traditions and educate visitors about their heritage.\n\nThunderbird American Indian Dance Company director, Louis Mofsie, said millions of Native Americans live throughout the U.S. in a variety of environments.\n\n\"In the United States, there are over five million Native Americans, some on reservations and others in cities like New York,\" he told PIX11 News.\n\nShinnecock member Mattah Wright described her jingle dress and dance as a healing tradition from Canada and Michigan, now performed in a contemporary style.\n\n\"It's a healing dance from Canada and Michigan, now in a contemporary style,\" they said.\n\nMore than 40 vendors set up booths across the farm's expansive grounds, offering items such as handmade Native American jewellery and antiques.\n\n\"I love the handmade jewellery,\" said 10-year-old Kova Baranenko, admiring her new earrings.\n\nVisitors also found Native American blankets adorned with turtles, fish, and thunderbirds.\n\nFood was another highlight, with the Lakota fry bread Indian taco being a standout.\n\n\"It's a bit messy, but it's fantastic,\" said visitor Ian Isbister.\n\nJackie Jackson, a fry bread chef, attributed its appeal to the positive energy involved in cooking.\n\n\"The secret is being in a good space. We believe that your attitude while cooking affects the outcome,\" Jackson told PIX11 News.\n\nProceeds from the powwow will fund scholarships for Native Americans."
