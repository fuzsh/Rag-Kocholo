        "text": "What Are Mozilla Thunderbird Filter Rules?\n\nThunderbird filter rules are sets of instructions for the email client to execute when certain conditions are met.\n\nFor example, you can create Thunderbird rules for incoming mail that automatically move messages to appropriate folders so you don’t have to do it manually.\n\nIt’s possible for Thunderbird rules to run when you receive a new message, when you send a message, when you archive a message, every 10 minutes, and when you manually trigger them.\n\nCreate Filter Rules in Mozilla Thunderbird\n\nLet’s go over the steps you need to follow to create Thunderbird rules that move messages from a specific sender to a folder:\n\nLaunch Mozilla Thunderbird.\n\nOpen the Tools menu and choose Message Filters.\n\nClick New to create a new filter.\n\nGive the filter a suitable name.\n\nClick the dropdown menu that says Subject and change it to From.\n\nEnter the sender’s email address in the field next to the dropdown menu that says contains.\n\nUnder Perform these actions, make sure the Move Message to option is selected and choose the folder where you want to move all messages from the sender you’ve specified in the previous step.\n\nClick OK to confirm.\n\nAll new Thunderbird email rules are enabled by default, so you can simply close the Message Filters window and continue using the email client.\n\nTo test how Thunderbird rules work, you can press the Run Now button in the Message Filters window and then click Filter Log to display the log file created by the email client.\n\nCreate Rules to Filter Emails with Clean Email\n\nIt takes some work to learn the ins and outs of creating rules in Thunderbird, but there’s an even larger issue: the mail client executes message rules only when it’s running.\n\nIf you also access your inbox from a mobile device or web browser, then your messages won’t be filtered out until you launch Thunderbird on the computer where you created your rules.\n\nClean Email, a third-party inbox organizer, doesn’t suffer this problem because it’s a web app, so it’s running all the time and can be accessed from any device with a modern web browser.\n\nWhat’s more, Clean Email makes the process of creating rules a matter of a single click with its Auto Clean feature. Here’s how it works:\n\nGo to: https://app.clean.email/.\n\nConnect your mailbox.\n\nGo to your Inbox and select any message that represents the messages you want to filter.\n\nApply the action you want Clean Email to automatically apply to other similar messages.\n\nBefore you confirm the action, choose to apply it to all Selected and future similar emails.\n\nFrom now on, the inbox organizer will perform the same action automatically. To see all filters you’ve created:\n\nSelect the Auto Clean tool from the left pane.\n\nGo to the Your Rules tab.\n\nThere, you can pause, edit, or delete your rules.\n\nIn addition to streamlining the creation of email filters, Clean Email can help you keep your inbox organized in a number of different ways.\n\nFor example, its Unsubscriber feature can stop even the most persistent marketing newsletters and other recurring unwanted messages from making their way into your inbox, stealing your storage space and attention alike.\n\nThe Unsubscriber feature doesn’t care if a subscription message does or doesn’t contain an unsubscribe link—just like a good bouncer can kick out a rowdy patron regardless of whether they cooperate or not.\n\nOther features you should know about include Quick Clean (perfect for making neglected inboxes usable again), Read Later (let’s you temporarily hide emails you don’t have time to read), or Privacy Guard (checks your email address against known data breaches and security incidents)."
