Part way through today, I got the following error.\n\nI'm a bit surprised that Thunderbird doesn't use Firefox as its internal browser. I know they're somewhat separate these days, but still.\n\nAnyone know how to fix this?\n\nEdit. Some details requested below were only implicity given and some missing. So, I'm adding the missing ones and making explicit the implicit ones.\n\nIt is indeed a work email address---the company is blocked out on the screenshot, but they ware the ones that provide the \"management compliance policy\". It does state that I need to change browser. I don't know what Thunderbird uses as its internal browser.\n\nWhat I did would be best summarised as \"nothing\". It was working at one point on Sunday. I turned my computer off, went out, turned it back on when I came back and was asked to sign in. Signing in, I got this message. This was on a Sunday, so I'd be a little surprised if anyone was changing settings at work then. They could be scheduled changes, of course.\n\nUsing Windows 10, as per the image, with up-to-date Thunderbird, 102.7.2\n\nI've tried signing in multiple times as well as searching on the internet for solutions. Neither were successful. I also tried using my company's VPN, but that didn't change anything\n\nI was able to find a very hacky workaround.\n\nWhen the pop-up appears, asking to log in, I quickly copied the URL that appears in the top, before it redirected to a generic Microsoft one. It included some sort of token.\n\nI then went to this URL in a browser and logged in.\n\nAfter logging in, I got redirected to a 'local' link, which Firefox couldn't understand. This makes sense, as the link was instructed Thunderbird to do something. I just needed to enter this link into the Thunderbird pop-up.\n\nDoing this was not so easy, as the URL bar can't be typed in. However, I was able to click on various links and navigate to a webpage over which I had control. I put that link on that webpage, editing the webpage via my browser. I then clicked on this link and it worked.\n\nThis is one of the hackiest fixes I've come up with. I don't assume that it will work forever. So, if someone does have a real fix, please do let me know! Hopefully Thunderbird updates its internal browser soon...\n\nanswered Feb 21, 2023 at 14:19\n\nSam OTSam OT\n\n27711 gold badge66 silver badges1414 bronze badges"
