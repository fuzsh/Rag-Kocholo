        "text": "From the creative mind of Simon Barry is the sci-fi smash hit CONTINUUM. 2016 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, Best Science Fiction Television Series award winner and Special Recognition Award 2015 winner. Canadian Screen Awards, CA 2013\n\nWinner for Best Visual Effects (Adam Stern. For the episode \"A Stitch in Time\".) Winner of the International Academy of Web Television Awards 2014 - Best Design (Art Direction/Production, Eric Whitney) and Best Original Music (Damon Criswell).\n\nWhen a group of fanatical terrorists escape their planned execution in 2077 by traveling back in time to 2012, they inadvertently take City Protective Services officer Kiera Cameron with them. Trapped in a more “primitive” past, Kiera infiltrates the local police department to try to track down the terrorists before they change the course of history.\n\nContinuum stars Rachel Nichols (Alias, Criminal Minds, G.I. Joe) as Kiera, Victor Webster (Castle, Melrose Place) as detective Carlos Fonnegra – who Kiera allies with – and Erik Knudsen (Jericho, Scream 4) as Alec Sadler, the teenaged tech genius who could be Kiera’s key to saving the future.\n\nContinuum comes from executive producers Simon Barry (The Art of War), Jeff King (Stargate SG-1, White Collar), Tom Rowe (Tin Man), and Pat Williams (Smallville), and aired on Syfy and Showcase."
