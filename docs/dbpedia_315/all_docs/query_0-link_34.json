It uses a combination of computer-generated animation and live-action models. It is a remake of the series Thunderbirds created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson which follows the exploits of International Rescue (IR), a rescue organisation run by the Tracy family out of their secret island base in the Pacific Ocean. They use technologically-advanced craft for land, sea, air and space rescues in their operations, the most important of which are a set of vehicles called the Thunderbirds, piloted by the five Tracy brothers.\n\nThe programme premiered on 4 April 2015 and concluded on 22 February 2020, running for 78 episodes across three series. It was well-received by critics and fans of the original series, and has spawned several branches of merchandising since its broadcast.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nA revival of the 1960s science fiction Supermarionation television series Thunderbirds was approved by co-creator Gerry Anderson when Richard Taylor, the founder of Weta Workshop, visited him at Pinewood Studios while he was working on New Captain Scarlet.[1] On 4 February 2013, ITV Global Entertainment and Pukeko Pictures officially announced the revival under the title Thunderbirds Are Go![2] Production began in June 2013 at Weta Workshop,[3] while the principal voice cast was announced on 30 September 2014.[4]\n\nEach series consists of 26 episodes with transmission split into multiple parts. Series 1 was broadcast between 4 April–20 June 2015 and 31 October 2015–23 January 2016. A second series was green-lit on 18 December 2014[5] and aired between 22 October 2016 – 7 January 2017 and 30 September–16 December 2017. A third and final series was confirmed on 5 May 2016[6] and was broadcast between 31 March–26 May 2018, 18 May–13 July 2019 and 4 January–22 February 2020.\n\nPremise\n\n[edit]\n\nSet in the year 2060, Thunderbirds Are Go follows the exploits of the Tracy brothers - Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon, and John - who form the backbone of International Rescue (IR): a life-saving organisation that operates from a hidden base in the Southern Pacific Ocean, and who save people from disasters and dangerous situations using technologically advanced crafts for land, sea, air and space rescue, the most prominent of these being five vehicles called \"Thunderbirds\", each one operated by one of the brothers. In addition to the brothers, IR also includes additional members who offer assistance and support: Chief of Security Tanusha \"Kayo\" Kyrano, who conducts covert and security operations through the use of a specialised Thunderbird with stealth capabilities; engineer Brains, who provides technological and mechanical support both at the base and in the field; Grandma Tracy, the brothers' maternal support who tends to their home needs; and London operatives Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, an English aristocrat, and Aloysius \"Nosey\" Parker, a chauffeur and former thief, who conduct investigative and espionage work when required.\n\nAlthough most rescues involve contending with disaster caused by unforeseen incidents or the actions of criminals, a number are orchestrated by IR's main adversary known only as \"The Hood\" - a British criminal mastermind who despises the organisation and seeks to often steal their technology while conducting crimes to make him wealthy. Prior to the premiere episode of the programme, the Hood is known to IR and is responsible for the loss of the brothers' father, Jeff Tracy, the founder of IR and a close friend of Colonel Casey, the head of the Global Defence Force (GDF). In the second series, the programme introduced a second villain called \"The Mechanic,\" who causes havoc and eventually helps to break out the Hood, after he is arrested by the GDF at the end of the first series, only to later turn on him in order to break free from his control, whereupon he later surrenders, on condition that Brains helps him secure his freedom. In the third series, a pair of villains called the \"Chaos Crew\" - formed of siblings Havoc and Fuse - join with the Hood to cause world-wide chaos, and become a considerable problem for both the GDF and IR.\n\nMuch of the episodes focus on rescue operations, many of which include elements from the original series - an example includes a remake of the original series premiere episode with a modern take on its plot. Although all episodes mainly include unique characters who have only one appearance, several created for Thunderbirds Are Go make reoccurring appearances, often with them being put into new situations they need rescuing from, though overarching storylines for each series focused mainly on the prominent villains for that series and the actions they undertake. Throughout the programme, the loss of Jeff to his sons plays a key element in a number of stories, both in relics found by the brothers, the various lessons they recall him teaching them, and the people who knew him best. The third and final series eventually included a final story arc focused on Jeff, in which IR discover him to be alive, rather than dead as presumed, but trapped in deep space. Amid a few standard rescues, the next few episodes focused on the Tracy family developing the means to reach and rescue him, culminating in the brothers eventually bringing him home in the 'Zero-XL', a spacecraft assembled around the five main Thunderbirds.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMain\n\n[edit]\n\nRecurring\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\nKayvan Novak, Rosamund Pike and Teresa Gallagher also voice various guest characters.\n\nArchive audio of Peter Dyneley, voice actor of Jeff Tracy in the original Thunderbirds series, announcing the 5–1 countdown from the title sequence is featured in the remake's titles and during the Thunderbirds' launch sequences.\n\nDavid Graham also voiced Parker in the original Thunderbirds series.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 2000, Jem Roberts held an interview with Gerry Anderson about a potential revival of the Thunderbirds series. Anderson anticipated that computer graphics would better capture realism. Around this time, a video game adaptation for Game Boy Color was in development.[7]\n\nAll scale model miniature effects and CGI for the series was produced at Weta Workshop in New Zealand. The series was executive produced by Estelle Hughes, Giles Ridge, Richard Taylor and Andrew Smith,[8] while David Scott and Theo Baynton act as series director and episode director, respectively.[9] The head writer is Rob Hoegee, while Anthony Cox serves as a film editor[10] and Ben Milsom a production designer.\n\nThe production of each episode started with a physical set creation. The sets were created using methods similar to those used in the original series, including the use of household objects as components. A film crew would devise camera setups for scenes to match with the movement and positions of CGI-created characters and crafts that were to be imposed later upon the footage. This also included special effects used on set, such as smoke and air. All CGI sequences were storyboarded before being superimposed onto the live-action footage of the miniatures. Each set was then individually scanned as a 3D print to provide reference for the CGI elements so they could be accurately registered in the environments. Details were then introduced, including textures, craft setup, atmospheric particles and flying debris. The UK-based company Milk VFX was responsible for the final composition.[11]\n\nThe music score was composed by brothers Ben and Nick Foster. The revived series's opening theme and certain cues remained faithful to Barry Gray's score for the original series, albeit with a contemporary orchestral style.[12]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nFans and critics reacted very positively to the new series.[13][14][15][16][17] ITV started to air episodes at 8 am (other than the pilot, which aired at 5 pm). Series 2, however, has been airing the show at 4pm on ITV and repeat it the following day at 8:30am on CITV. From the episode Volcano on 30 September 2017, it aired on CITV's Scrambled on Saturday at 8:30am, with it being repeated on ITV the same day at 3:30pm, although this varied throughout the run, with the repeat often airing as early as 12pm. The afternoon repeat was dropped for Series 3.\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Recipient Result 2015 British Academy Children's Awards[18] BAFTA Kids Vote - Television Thunderbirds Are Go Nominated 2016 British Academy Television Craft Awards[19] Original Music Ben Foster, Nick Foster British Academy Children's Awards[20] BAFTA Kids Vote - Television Thunderbirds Are Go\n\nInternational broadcasts\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 16 June 2014, ITV Studios Global Entertainment sold the rights in a deal with Australia's free-to-air Nine Network (9Go!), who broadcast both the first series,[21][22] and the second series.[23] The third series was bought by ABC, who premiered it on ABC Me from 2 June 2018.[24]\n\nOn 28 April 2015, Tohokushinsha Film Corporation acquired the television and licensing rights for Thunderbirds Are Go.
