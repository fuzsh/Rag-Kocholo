However, in recent years trans readers and journalists alike have raised concerns about the Times' pattern of coverage on the transgender community. This culminated in February 2023, when thousands of readers and contributors co-signed a letter outlining these concerns; alongside them, GLAAD and numerous other organizations did the same in a separate letter. The New York Times responded by not only dismissing these concerns, but subsequently publishing a defense of author J.K. Rowling, a vocal opponent of transgender rights. In the year that followed, myself and a talented team of folks at Media Matters explored the paper's news coverage of anti-transgender legislation in order to lay some hard figures down on the table. The results were damning: ‚û° 66% of the articles did not quote even one trans or gender-nonconforming person. ‚û° 18% of the articles quoted misinformation from anti-trans activists without adequate fact-checking or additional context. ‚û° 6 articles obscured the anti-trans background of sources, erasing histories of extremist rhetoric or actions. If transgender people are to be free from the throes of this one-sided culture war, our news media must be willing to uphold a standard of ethical coverage to better inform our citizens. If The New York Times cannot set that example, the failures will only trickle down from there.

Utterly nonsense and propaganda is all that she offers. She does it intelligently, so many follow her like sheep. Here's a few ideas - 1. How about hiring some conservatives, Christians, Veterans, law enforcement, hunters & fisherman on the team there at NPR??? Your newsroom has a ratio of 87 Democrats and ZERO Republicans. When she refers to BALANCE, is this balance?? 2. Stop referring to people you don't like as racists. This woman (who is Caucasian) states openly & proudly, that she HATES ALL WHITE PEOPLE! 3. Disagreeing with someone doesn't make you right. She talks about BALANCE and PRODUCTIVE FRICTION. Don't make me laugh ü§£ü§£ü§£ Your entire employed staff ARE DEMOCRATS, SAUL ALINSKY LOVERS, COMMUNISTS, ISLAMIC JIHADISTS, BLM, ANTIFA, CCP, MARXISTS, WEATHER UNDERGROUND FANS, THOUSAND CURRENTS LOVERS - ALL CRIMINALS & TRAITORS THAT HATE AMERICA. NPR is ALL THE ABOVE. ZERO Republicans. ZERO!!!! How is that balance????? How does your definition of DEBATE work?? I don't get how there is any debate amongst an office full of people that all agree on pretty much everything, all the time. You say it \"Actually brings people into the conversation??\" SURE THING. LOL. ü§£ü§£ü§£ She goes on to reveal her true motive - \"You don't sit back when you disagree with someone because engaging gives you the chance to SHAPE the public record.\" UTTER NONSENSE!!!!! She says, \"Through THAT PROCESS, words become s SHARPER, BETTER and MORE UNDERSTANDABLE. \" HUH?????Smoothe orator like Obama right? This is brainwashing with propaganda at a high level. DO NOT BE A SUCKER!!!!! 4. \"Not woke enough\"???? Seriously, you're muse here is Hillary Clinton (a known pathological liar & guilty Benghazi traitor...and you want us all to what? Go WOKE??? 5. ...and ENOUGH with the Wikipedia crap. Everyone with a brain knows you're trying to rewrite history and what words mean or don't mean, plus what words this kook deems appropriate for Americans to use. What makes her an authority on words??? She decides what binary, non-binary, pronouns, $#@%!!! WHATEVER NONSENSE. JUST STOP FUNDING NPR. Make it happen America. ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá≤ *WATCH THE VIDEO ALL THE WAY TO THE END* Jesse Watters https://lnkd.in/eftbnfsz\n\n10"
