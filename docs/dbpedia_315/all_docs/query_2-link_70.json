Working in a similar way to physical theatrical partnerships, we share the virtual box office ticket sales between distribution and exhibition.\n\nEVENT CINEMA\n\nModern Event Cinema is a sub-brand of Modern Films, dedicated to making the cinema-going experience inviting, exciting and entertaining. We create one-off events related to a film or filmed content that are shown Live from a venue or online in the form of Q+As, panels and/or discussion.

Our event partners range from the Royal Opera House and The Barbican to Tate Modern and Serpentine Galleries, from Penguin Books to Frieze Art Fair to the British Library, from The Guardian to the Southbank Centre, from Rough Trade to the British Fashion Council and the V&A Museum, from UN Women to UK Parliament, from SKY to BBC, Channel 4 and A24.\n\nIMPACT PROJECTS & CULTURAL PARTNERSHIPS\n\nModern FIlms work with impact partners across our release campaigns.
