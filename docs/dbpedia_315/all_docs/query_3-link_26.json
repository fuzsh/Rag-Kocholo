        "text": "The IMAP check box, next to Incoming, is selected by default and is recommended. In the Server hostname box, enter the name of your incoming server. If you’re connecting to your Microsoft 365 email, the IMAP or POP server name is partner.outlook.cn. If you’re not using Microsoft 365, see Find your POP3 and IMAP server settings later in this article.\n\nNote: Leave the Port option set to Auto. Leave the SSL and Authentication options set to Autodetect.\n\nIn the Server hostname text box, next to Outgoing, enter your SMTP server name. If you’re connecting to your Microsoft 365 email, the SMTP server name is smtp.office365.cn. If you’re not using Microsoft 365, see Find your POP3 and IMAP server settings later in this article.\n\nNote: Leave the Port option set to Auto. Leave the SSL and Authentication options set to Autodetect.\n\nClick the Re-test button. If you see the message \"The following settings were found by probing the given server,” click Create Account. A page opens that lets you view or change other Thunderbird settings.\n\nClick OK when you've finished viewing or changing the settings. If you’re unable to connect, see “What else do I need know?” later in this topic.\n\nNote: If you're using POP, under Server Settings, it's a good idea to select Leave messages on the server. After you select this check box, a copy of the messages you retrieve to your local computer will be kept on the server. You’ll also be able to access your messages from a different mail application.\n\nIf your email account is the type that requires registration, you must register it the first time you sign in to Outlook Web App. Connecting to your email account through POP3 or IMAP4 will fail if you haven't registered your account through Outlook Web App. After you sign in to your account, sign out. Then try to connect using your POP3 or IMAP4 program.\n\nIf you’re using an incoming POP3 server, you can only synchronize your Inbox folder. If you’re using IMAP4, you can choose the folders that you want Thunderbird to synchronize with the server. Remember that IMAP4 doesn’t support the synchronization of the Contacts and Calendar folders. Thunderbird uses a folder named Sent to store sent items. Exchange and Outlook Web App use a folder named Sent Items. You can synchronize the email items that you’ve sent in Thunderbird with the Sent Items folder on the Exchange server. To do this, follow these steps:"
