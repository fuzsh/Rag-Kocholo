        "text": "You might also be looking for the 2004 or 2015 incarnations.\n\n\"The things I do for International Rescue!\"\n\nScott Tracy is the eldest of Jeff Tracy's five sons, and the pilot of Thunderbird 1. He is 30 years old.\n\nScott's signature colour on his IR uniform is light blue.\n\nBiography[]\n\nScott was named by his parents after Mercury 7 astronaut Malcolm Scott Carpenter.\n\nHe was educated at Yale and Oxford Universities and joined the United States Air Force. After his father created the International Rescue organisation, Scott became the pilot of one of the five special IR craft, Thunderbird 1.\n\nAs the pilot of TB1, Scott is always the first to arrive at the Danger Zone where he assesses the situation and quickly determines which special rescue equipment would be required for the task, such as rescuing men trapped in a flooded mine. (Martian Invasion).\n\nPersonality & Traits[]\n\nScott is fast-talking, quick-witted, and quick-thinking. He has brains, brawn, and boldness. With all these qualities he has the confidence to make instant decisions, backed by a fierce determination and unfaltering bravery. When off duty, Scott is relaxed and good-humoured and loves home cooking - notably, Grandma Tracy's apple pie (The Uninvited).\n\nDuties[]\n\nAs well as piloting Thunderbird 1, Scott also co-pilots Thunderbird 3 with his younger brother Alan Tracy and sometimes changes shifts with him and his other younger brother John Tracy aboard Thunderbird 5.\n\nIn the absence of his father, Scott takes command of the main headquarters on Tracy Island.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nMain article: Scott Tracy/Appearances\n\nScott appears in all 32 television episodes, as well as both movies (Thunderbirds Are Go and Thunderbird 6).\n\nHe also appears (via both new and archival footage) in all three episodes of Thunderbirds 1965.\n\nMissions[]\n\nMain article: Scott Tracy/Missions\n\nScott's role as first responder usually sees him rush to the scene in Thunderbird 1, where he will set up his Mobile Control Centre and oversee the rescue from the ground, advising Virgil and whoever else is on scene about the equipment they'll need and how best to tackle the rescue. Sometimes though, Scott will pitch in and help with the rescue effort itself.\n\nOutfits[]\n\nMain article: Scott Tracy/Outfits\n\nTrivia[]\n\nTo date, Scott is the only Tracy brother to come face-to-face with the Hood onscreen, first in Thunderbirds Are Go, then in The Abominable Snowman.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"Gee, that apple pie you brought out was good, Tin-Tin. Is there any more?\" - The Uninvited\n\n\"Sorry I'm late, folks. I had to milk the cows before I took off.\" - Operation Crash-Dive\n\n\"I know I don't really have to say this, but a man's life is at stake.\" - The Impostors\n\n\"Sir, you'll pardon the intrusion, sir, but would you mind telling the boys that lunch is ready? Sir.\" - Cry Wolf\n\n\"This is a job for International Rescue. Thunderbirds are go!\" - Atlantic Inferno\n\nBehind the Scenes[]\n\nScott's facial features are based off of Scottish actor Sean Connery, who was popular at the time due to his portrayal of the titular character in the James Bond series of spy films. Like all of the Tracy brothers, he was named after one of the Mercury Seven astronauts, in this case: Scott Carpenter.\n\nExpressions[]"
