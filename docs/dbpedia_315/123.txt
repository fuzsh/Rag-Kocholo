Thunderbird Films has acquired U.K.-based indie distributor Soda Pictures to enter the Canadian film distribution arena.

Terms of the acquisition deal were not disclosed, but Soda Pictures, as a new Thunderbird division unveiled at the Toronto Film Festival, has acquired Lone Scherfig’s The Riot Club from Hanway Films for the Canadian market.

The Sam Claflin and Max Irons starrer about an elite party set at Oxford University will have a gala world premiere at Roy Thomson Hall on Saturday night.

The sales agreement will see Soda principals Eve Gabereau and Edward Fletcher sign long-term contracts with Vancouver-based Thunderbird, which until now has focused on scripted TV production.

That includes running a 50-50 TV studio with Lionsgate Entertainment.

Soda Pictures will focus on bringing specialty British films to Canada for distribution, while broadening Thunderbird’s reach into the U.K. and Ireland film and TV markets.

“We are thrilled to be expanding into the theatrical space with Eve, Edward and the Soda team, they are a great fit for us,” Thunderbird CEO Tim Gamble said in a statement.
