Much has been made of Canada’s lack of star appeal, so much so that head coach Dave Cameron has said he has four ‘No. 2 lines.’

As such, ice time appears ready for the taking among the forward group and it’s likely that roles could change through the course of the tournament.

Ahead of Team Canada’s Dec. 26 opener against Russia, sportsnet.ca takes a look at what each player brings and projects their roles on the team.

SEAN COUTURIER

Junior team: Drummondville Voltigeurs (QMJHL)

NHL rights: 2011 eligible

Hometown: Bathurst, N.B.

Height: 6’3″

Weight: 192 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: The youngest player on the team could eventually become one of its most reliable point-producers. Couturier centered a line with Zack Kassian and Marcus Foligno after the team was named and would make a formidable third line. Couturier will be the benefactor of gritty linemates and could see his role increase as the tournament progresses. This will also be an opportunity for him to assert himself as the top draft eligible prospect, similarly to last year’s youngest Canadian player, Taylor Hall.

JADEN SCHWARTZ

Junior team: Colorado College Tigers (NCAA)

NHL rights: St. Louis Blues

Hometown: Emerald Park, Sask.

Height: 5’10”

Weight: 184 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: Schwartz is the type of player Cameron loves to build around. He’s a natural offensive talent, but doesn’t sacrifice defence for offence. Schwartz is a speedy skater and possesses high hockey intelligence. He will be relied on for offence and defence and will be on the ice late when Canada needs a goal or is trying to prevent one.

ZACK KASSIAN

Junior team: Windsor Spitfires (OHL)

NHL rights: Buffalo Sabres

Hometown: LaSalle, Ont.

Height: 6’3″

Weight: 226 lbs.

Shoots: Right

Synopsis: Kassian is a man among boys physically in junior hockey this season. His role will be to disrupt the opposing team with his brute force and develop hesitation in the opposition. Kassian has the ability to provide offensively and will play the antagonizing role similarly to Steve Downie several years ago.

BRAYDEN SCHENN

Junior team: Brandon Wheat Kings (WHL)

NHL rights: Los Angeles Kings

Hometown: Saskatoon, Sask.

Height: 6’0″

Weight: 199 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: The only player made available by an NHL team, Schenn is also one of only four returnees from last year’s silver-medal winning team. Schenn will be given the opportunity to shine on an offensive line which will give him something to prove after a mediocre tournament last year. He could also see occasional time on the penalty kill.

CASEY CIZIKAS

Junior team: Mississauga St. Michael’s Majors (OHL)

NHL rights: New York Islanders

Hometown: Mississauga, Ont.

Height: 6’2″

Weight: 191 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: Cizikas is a candidate for the 13th forward position and his ice time will likely be limited. He has the ability to play defensively and could earn a penalty killing role, particularly since he excels as a defensively reliable forward on Cameron’s junior team.

QUINTON HOWDEN

Junior team: Moose Jaw Warriors (WHL)

NHL rights: Florida Panthers

Hometown: Oak Bank, Man.

Height: 6’2″

Weight: 192 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: Howden’s role will be as a grinding, energy-type player on Canada’s fourth line. Like every other forward on this team, he has the ability to score, but he won’t likely earn the opportunity to showcase his offence. Howden has both the size and ability to provide valuable minutes in an energy role.

CURTIS HAMILTON

Junior team: Saskatoon Blades (WHL)

NHL rights: Edmonton Oilers

Hometown: Kelowna, B.C.

Height: 6’3″

Weight: 202 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: Hamilton is the son of Kelowna Rockets general manager Bruce Hamilton. Curtis will be a regular on the team’s penalty killing units and should develop a niche as an energy player on the team’s fourth line. Cameron will love Hamilton’s hockey sense and two-way ability, but it’s unlikely he will play in a top six role.

MARCUS FOLIGNO

Junior team: Sudbury Wolves (OHL)

NHL rights: Buffalo Sabres

Hometown: Sudbury, Ont.

Height: 6’1″

Weight: 200 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: The other half of Canada’s bash brothers, Foligno will play a similar role to Zack Kassian on the team’s third line. Foligno and Kassian will provide Canada with the intimidating presence and could chip in with the occasional goal due to their hard work. It will be a homecoming of sorts for Foligno, who was born in Buffalo and could have represented the home country. Foligno chose Canada, just like Brandon Kozun — who also holds dual citizenship — did in last year’s tournament.

RYAN JOHANSEN

Junior team: Portland Winterhawks (WHL)

NHL rights: Columbus Blue Jackets

Hometown: Port Moody, B.C.

Height: 6’2″

Weight: 193 lbs.

Shoots: Right

Synopsis: Johansen came a long way in a short time. The fourth-overall pick of last year’s draft should earn the opportunity to showcase his offensive game. Johansen is a reliable point-producer in Portland and will likely center the team’s second line. He could be a valuable secondary contributor.

LOUIS LEBLANC

Junior team: Montreal Juniors (QMJHL)

NHL rights: Montreal Canadiens

Hometown: Point-Claire, Que.

Height: 5’11”

Weight: 181 lbs.

Shoots: Right

Synopsis: Leblanc will be relied upon to produce much of Canada’s offence in this tournament. He dominated league play on many nights after leaving Harvard for his hometown Montreal Juniors in the QMJHL. His natural offensive ability as both a playmaker and a scorer will make him difficult to defend. Leblanc will play in all offensive roles.

CODY EAKIN

Junior team: Swift Current Broncos (WHL)

NHL rights: Washington Capitals

Hometown: Winnipeg, Man.

Height: 6’0″

Weight: 187 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: Eakin is a solid two-way forward with underrated offensive ability. His game resembles that of the player he models it after, Ottawa’s Mike Fisher. Eakin will likely begin the tournament on an offensive line and could also earn minutes as a penalty killer.

CARTER ASHTON

Junior team: Tri-City Americans (WHL)

NHL rights: Tampa Bay Lightning

Hometown: Saskatoon, Sask.

Height: 6’3″

Weight: 219 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: While Ashton can produce offensively in junior, he isn’t as natural a scorer as some of the other forwards on this team. He will likely fight for ice time on the team’s fourth line as an energy player, but might not factor into the penalty kill. He provides another big body that could help slow the opposition’s defence.

BRETT CONNOLLY

Junior team: Prince George Cougars (WHL)

NHL rights: Tampa Bay Lightning

Hometown: Prince George, B.C.

Height: 6’2″

Weight: 181 lbs.

Shoots: Right

Synopsis: Connolly is perhaps the most gifted natural scorer on the team. He possesses a wicked wrist shot and always finds himself in the right places at the right time. Connolly’s intelligence will also ensure offence doesn’t come at the expense of defence.

JARED COWEN

Junior team: Spokane Chiefs (WHL)

NHL rights: Ottawa Senators

Hometown: Allan, Sask.

Height: 6’5″

Weight: 227 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: Cowen is one of three returnees from last year’s defensive core, but will see more ice time than he did a year ago. He should have much to prove after a disastrous tournament a year ago. Cowen was not reliable and his ice time diminished rapidly as the tournament progressed. He will start in the top four and play on the penalty kill.

SIMON DESPRES

Junior team: Saint John Sea Dogs (QMJHL)

NHL rights: Pittsburgh Penguins

Hometown: Laval, Que.

Height: 6’4″

Weight: 222 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: Despres doesn’t do anything fancy, but is solid at both ends of the rink. He doesn’t figure into an offensive role or as a shutdown defender. Despres will likely begin on either the third pairing or as the seventh defenceman.

DYLAN OLSEN

Junior team: Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs (NCAA)

NHL rights: Chicago Blackhawks

Hometown: Calgary, Alta.

Height: 6’2″

Weight: 223 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: Olsen will likely begin on the third pairing, but could earn more ice time with his solid and dependable play. He’s an all-around, mobile defenceman that could play on the team’s penalty kill. Olsen is the first player from UMD to represent Canada at the world juniors.

ERIK GUDBRANSON

Junior team: Kingston Frontenacs (OHL)

NHL rights: Florida Panthers

Hometown: Orleans, Ont.

Height: 6’4″

Weight: 211 lbs.

Shoots: Right

Synopsis: Gudbranson will be Canada’s steady and reliable defender. He can play any role, but will most likely be part of Canada’s shutdown pairing and a defensive specialist. He has the size to punish the opposing forwards and make crisp, outlet passes. Gudbranson will most likely be one of Canada’s unsung heroes.

RYAN ELLIS

Junior team: Windsor Spitfires (OHL)

NHL rights: Nashville Predators

Hometown: Freelton, Ont.

Height: 5’10”

Weight: 184 lbs.

Shoots: Right

Synopsis: The Canadian captain will bring a bit of everything. Ellis will be relied upon as a leader as a three-time representative. He has a cannon of a slapshot and makes smart, first passes. His ability to pick apart a defence will be crucial in starting the rush. He will also play in defensive situations and probably play an average of 30 minutes per game. Ellis was inconsistent in last year’s tournament, which should motivate him to step up his play this time around.

TYSON BARRIE

Junior team: Kelowna Rockets (WHL)

NHL rights: Colorado Avalanche

Hometown: Victoria, B.C.

Height: 5’10”

Weight: 190 lbs.

Shoots: Right

Synopsis: Barrie brings an element that may have been missing in Canada’s pursuit of six-straight tournament wins last year: mobility. His skating stride is fluent and effortless, which will help him keep pace with quick forwards. Barrie will play an offensive role, but most likely on the third pair at even strength. He has an accurate shot that should create chances on the power-play.

CALVIN DE HAAN

Junior team: Oshawa Generals (OHL)

NHL rights: New York Islanders

Hometown: Carp, Ont.

Height: 6’0″

Weight: 189 lbs.

Shoots: Left

Synopsis: de Haan is the third returnee to Canada’s defensive core. His ice time was limited at last year’s tournament after taking a hit away from the play against Switzerland in the round robin. He should play in a top four role and on the team’s power-play. de Haan’s skating ability and vision will make him a valuable offensive specialist.

OLIVIER ROY

Junior team: Acadie-Bathurst Titan (QMJHL)

NHL rights: Edmonton Oilers

Hometown: Causapscal, Que.

Height: 5’11”

Weight: 186 lbs.

Catches: Left

Synopsis: Roy will likely earn the starting job, but his leash may be short. He was inconsistent on a team with championship aspirations in Bathurst this season in spite of his reputation as a money goaltender. He’s a fierce competitor and will need to find consistency to help Canada back to the top.

MARK VISENTIN

Junior team: Niagara IceDogs (OHL)

NHL rights: Phoenix Coyotes

Hometown: Waterdown, Ont.

Height: 6’1″

Weight: 198 lbs.

Catches: Left
