        "text": "Welcome to the Varsity Centre Arena stop of the Black History Here & Now Virtual Tour, where we will learn about Black Canadians in hockey.\n\nBlack Canadians are pioneers of hockey. Two historians, George Fosty and Daril Fosty, have written extensively on Black Canadians and the Colored Hockey League (CHL), revealing that, contrary to past revelations, hockey’s roots and background are Black and stem from the south of Halifax.\n\nFounded in Nova Scotia in 1895, the CHL had over 400 players in a three-decade span. A little-known fact from this time (now coming to light) is that the slapshot can be credited to a Black Canadian forward, Eddie Martin, who played for the CHL Halifax Eurekas in 1906. In its peak, the CHL drew crowds of up to 1200 for its championship games in the early 1900s.\n\nIn January 2020, Canada Post issued a commemorative stamp featuring an image of Black hockey players on a frozen pond in front of the Halifax Citadel. The stamp reads “Colored Hockey Championship” and includes the names of some of the teams: Jubilees, Stanleys, Eurekas, Sea-Sides, Rangers, Royals and Moss Backs.\n\nRead more about the contributions of Black Canadians to the sport of hockey below.\n\nAthlete Spotlight\n\nTHE ST. CATHERINE'S ORIOLES\n\nThe first record of an all-Black hockey team in Ontario is found in St. Catherine’s in the 1930s. Part of an eight-team league, the St. Catherine’s Orioles (also called the St. Kitts Orioles) faced off against various teams in the Niagara District Hockey League. The team, made up of about 16 players, often faced discrimination. While there are not many official records on the team, more information can be found, for example, in the book A Sporting Chance: Achievements of African-Canadian Athletes by Bill Humber.\n\nLearn more about the St. Catherine's Orioles\n\nDARREN LOWE\n\nDarren Lowe comes from a family rooted in Black Canadian Hockey history as his dad played on an all-black line for the Mount Forest Redmen in the 1950s, one of the first in the country.\n\nIn 1984, Lowe became the first Black Canadian to represent Canada in the Men’s Olympic Hockey competition. He tallied 2 goals and 1 assist in 7 games at the Olympics, helping Canada to a fourth-place finish.\n\nAfter his appearance with the Olympic Team, Lowe attracted NHL interest and became the first Black player to play for the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nAt the end of his playing career Lowe became the first black head coach of the Varsity Blues Men’s Hockey team in 1995, the beginning of a successful 22-year coaching career.\n\nCoach Lowe accomplished 4 first placed finishes in their OUA Division and over 250 wins throughout his tenure.\n\nLearn more about Darren Lowe\n\nSources\n\nGeorge Fosty and Darill Fosty: Canadian Encylopedia - Coloured Hockey League\n\nSportsnet: The Mostly Lost History of the St. Catharines Orioles\n\nAlex McKenzie and Janelle Joseph: Whitewashed and Blacked Out: Counter-Narratives as an Analytical Framework for Studies of Ice Hockey in Canada\n\nHockey Canada: In My Own Words - Darren Lowe\n\nPerry King: U of T alum Darren Lowe talks teaching, coaching and leading the Varsity Blues hockey bench\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nBlack Girl Hockey Club Canada\n\nVarsity Blues: Black History Month Feature - Safiya Muharuma\n\nIce Queens: A Documentary about Black Women in Hockey\n\nCanadian Encyclopedia: Herb Carnegie\n\nCanadian Encyclopedia: Willie O'Ree"
