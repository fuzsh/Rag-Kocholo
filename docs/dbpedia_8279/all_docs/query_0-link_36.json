        "text": "Athletics Canada is pleased to reveal the list of 27 athletes who will represent the country at the World U20 Championships in Lima, Peru from August 27 to 31.\n\n“I am extremely proud of all the Canadians who qualified for the 2024 U20 World Championships,” said head coach Carmyn James. “The qualification standards are based on marks that reflect what it has taken to place 16th at past WA U20 Championships. So, to have 27 athletes at that level is very impressive!”\n\nThis group of 15 women and 12 men will don the Maple Leaf and contend for medals with almost 900 athletes hailing from more than 100 countries: Roxane Tedga, Savannah Blair, Keon Rude, Junior Imoukhuede, Dianna Proctor, Ashley Odiase, William Batley, Isaac Chandra, Kiara Webb, Pishon Haughton, Kyla Martin, Stephanie Bertram, John O’Reilly, Robin Lefebvre, Rachel Forsyth, Paige Marchant, Liam Smith, Justin Pretre, Arienne Birch, Tricia Madourie, Payton Serraglio, Mackenzie Hurtubise, Asia Phillips, Julia Tunks, Jake McEachern, Jackson Mackay, and Aidan Turner.\n\n“Three of our top athletes include Ontario’s Julia Tunks and Asia Phillips, and Alberta’s Jake McEachern,” James said. “Julia is ranked 2nd in the world in the U20 Women’s Discus and she just missed qualifying for the Paris Olympics by two spots. Asia is ranked 9th in world in the U20 Women’s Triple Jump and Jake McEachern is ranked 11th in the world in the U20 Men’s Hammer Throw.”\n\nPerformance on Demand\n\nHeading the World Athletics U20 Championships, the challenge for every Team Canada member is the same.\n\n“The goal for all our team members will be to rise to the occasion on the internation stage and ‘Perform on Demand,’” James said. “That may result in placing higher in the competition than they are ranked, or it may mean placing in the top 8 or winning a medal. Each athlete will have the same objective.”\n\nThe Future is Now\n\nThe World Athletics U20 Championships are a proven testing ground for Canada’s next wave of track & field stars.\n\nThe team of athletes selected today may not have long to wait before joining the world’s elite.\n\nThree members of the 2022 U20 team are currently in Paris, competing at the Olympic Games: Christopher Morales Williams, Savannah Sutherland and Olivia Lundman. Olympic and world hammer throw champion Ethan Katzberg was part of the 2021 team, while his fellow Olympic and world hammer throw champion Camryn Rogers was part of the 2018 team, along with two-time Olympian Lauren Gale.\n\n“With the Olympic being on now, it's just an exciting time because, if some of the athletes we’ve selected have made connections with some of their predecessors, they know what's possible,” said team leader Molly Killingbeck. “I'm pretty excited about the team that we have. I think we have a very solid team.”\n\nCali 2022\n\nCanada’s 32-athlete team generated eleven Top 10 finishes and eight personal bests at the last World Athletics U20 Championships in Cali, Columbia in 2023.\n\nTeam Canada saved its greatest highlight for last: a bronze medal performance in the men’s the 4x400m relay team, consisting of Christopher Morales Williams, Daniel Kidd, Ben Tilson and Will Floyd."
