        "text": "At the Tejano Music Awards: Ricky, Joe, Jesse, and dad Roman, Sr.\n\nI was surprised to find news of the death of Ricky Martinez, the lead singer and bassist of Lubbock’s Hometown Boys, a powerhouse conjunto. What is even more eerie is that Ricky is the 4th brother in the band to pass away in the last ten years.\n\nKnown for their rockin’ accordian-driven rancheras, the band has lost percussionist Roman, Jr, in 1997, power-accordianist Joe in 1998, and drummer Jesse in 2002. While Roman, Jr. died after a battle with cerebral palsy, Joe was jamming with his brothers and dad on stage in Houston when he suffered a heart complications and Jesse died a few minutes before a show of a brain aneurysm.\n\nTejano radio stations have been offering tributes to Ricky and the Hometown Boys.\n\nAccording to their website: The Hometown Boys have had a very basic style of music that appeals to all generations. September, 1996, marked a first in the history of West Texas. The Hometown Boys were the first Hispanics to be inducted into the “Buddy Holly Walk of Fame” in Lubbock, Texas, alongside Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, Waylon Jennings and other Texas legends. The Grammy award winners have been known for songs like, “Mire Amigo”, which went gold in its first 4 days of release, “Dos Gatos”, “El Poder De Una Mujer”, “Hombre Innocente”, “Dos Cosas”, “Vestida De Blanco”, “El Pintor”, and many more great songs. Lets not forget to mention “Joe’s Specials”. “Joe’s Special # 10” received the Best Instrumental Award at the 1997 Tejano Music Awards. The fans have been an inspiration to the group’s dedication.\n\nBack in October, 1997 The Hometown Boys had their first loss. Roman, Jr., percussions, and sound engineer, after a lengthy illness, passed away at the age of 45. This was such a tremendous loss. Joe, accordion player, wound up having a heart attack shortly after Roman Jr.’s funeral. After a triple bypass, Joe seemed to be on the road to recovery. A couple of months later, in January, 1998, he went to see The Hometown Boys perform and was invited up on stage to play his beloved accordion. Joe was known as the “Accordion Abuser” because he put all his energy into playing the accordion that sometimes he wound up breaking the instrument from playing so hard. After being on stage for a while, Joe suffered heart complications and at the tender age of 34, passed away while he was doing what he loved to do. Joe was a remarkably talented musician. The loss was devastating. Two brothers passed away within a three month period. However, The Hometown Boys continued their quest to perform for their fans. A few years later in August, 2002, just as The Hometown Boys were to go on stage in Lubbock, Texas, Jesse, The drummer and baby of the family, suffered an aneurysm and passed away also at the young age of 34. The family has been in mourning for many years now.\n\nAnd now, Ricky…\n\n…Rest in peace, Ricky Martinez. As Ricky would say, “Grito!!!!“"
