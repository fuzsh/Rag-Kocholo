        "text": "Name: Adam Walker II\n\nNickname: AWalk\n\nYear: Junior\n\nPosition: Free Safety\n\nHeight: 6'1\"\n\nWeight: 193 lbs\n\nHometown: Alpharetta, Ga.\n\nHigh School: Alpharetta\n\nMajor: Aerospace Engineering – Astro Track\n\nWhat do you want to do after graduation and why? I have always found flight and space interesting growing up, so I would love to commission as a Navy Pilot or cross-commission into the Space Force.\n\nWhy did you choose Navy? The Naval Academy is the best place to play big-time football while studying Aerospace Engineering, not to mention there are plenty of benefits from graduating from a military academy.\n\nWhat would you tell somebody that is considering coming to Navy to play football? If they want to play for the toughest team in the country, this is the place for them.\n\nIf you could play another position, what position would you play and why? Wide Receiver. Being able to go back to my roots and get the ball in my hands to help our team win would be a great feeling and I know I have the skills to do so.\n\nIf you could choose any opponent for Navy to play that is currently not on the schedule, who would you choose and why? I would want to play Northwestern. I have a close friend who plays for them, so getting to dominate them and claim bragging rights would be fun.\n\nFavorite class at the Naval Academy and why? My favorite class is Principles of Aerospace Engineering II, or Intro to Astro. I enjoyed this class because we got to learn all about how space works and how objects in space function and are affected by other factors, which I find very interesting.\n\nHardest class at the Naval Academy and why? The hardest class I have taken so far at the Naval Academy is Dynamics for Aerospace Engineers. There are almost too many ways to go about solving a problem but each one takes forever and you can still easily get it wrong. Unfortunately, I have a feeling this answer will change next year.\n\nFavorite teacher at the Naval Academy and why? My favorite teacher here is Lt. Cmdr. Wallace. He brings a great energy to the classroom and makes learning fun and easy.\n\nFavorite form of social media and why? My favorite social media is YouTube. I like unwinding by throwing on a video while I eat.\n\nFavorite person to follow on social media and why? My favorite person to follow is RDCWorld1, who is actually a group of people that perform skits, play video games and host major events.\n\nIf you could have dinner with any 4 people that are currently at the Naval Academy who would you choose and why? I would have dinner with Lt. Cmdr. Wallace, Chief Cook, GySgt. Morris and Coach Eric Lewis. These four people I know well and would provide lots of knowledge as well as entertainment.\n\nFavorite sport to follow at the Naval Academy outside of football and why? I like to keep up with track and field because I like seeing some of the times our athletes run. I also have some friends who run, so I make sure to support them.\n\nIf you didn't play football at Navy, what sport would you play and why? I would most likely play baseball. Baseball was my first love and I played it the longest, so getting to go back to my original sport would be fun.\n\nWhat song is playing on your headphones in the locker room right before taking the field? \"Rock and Roll\" by Youngboy Never Broke Again\n\nWhat is your dream vacation? I would love to go to Hawaii, or anywhere tropical.\n\nWhat is the best thing about being in the American Athletic Conference? A lot of the offensive talent is very respectable, so the receivers and quarterbacks bring good competition.\n\nWhat do you think about Army being in the American Athletic Conference? I think them being in the conference adds another level of competition between us.\n\nFavorite Coach Newberry Quote: \"Success is your very best\"\n\nHow would you describe Coach Cronic's Offense: Dynamic. The run game will challenge the defense with its ground-and-pound attack but can explode at any moment on the ground or in the air.\n\nHow would you describe Coach Volker's Defense: Relentless. We are very attack-oriented and stay on the offensive and we run to the ball better than anyone.\n\nOne word to describe a Navy Football player: Dawg\n\nWho will be the surprise player on offense in 2024? Isaiah Bryant\n\nWho will be the surprise player on defense in 2024? Job Grant\n\nWho is the toughest player on the Navy football team? Colin Ramos\n\nWhat player epitomizes Navy Football? Daba Fofana\n\nWho will be the Most Valuable Player on offense in 2024? Alex Tecza\n\nWho will be the Most Valuable Player on defense in 2024? Landon Robinson\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to in 2024? Beating Army\n\nTell us one thing about you that most people don't know? Baseball was my first love and I played it the longest.\n\nTell us one thing about you that would make a good feature story? My father also played football collegiately and professionally, so I am continuing his legacy.\n\nIf there was a Movie about your Life what would it be called and who would play you? The movie would be called Underdog and I would be played by Marcus Scribner."
