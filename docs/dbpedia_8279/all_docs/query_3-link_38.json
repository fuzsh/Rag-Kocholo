        "text": "BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) - The Hilltoppers are gearing up to play in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in over a decade as the tops will take on Marquette tomorrow afternoon and one Hilltopper has close personal ties to their opponent that goes beyond the court.\n\nWKU junior guard Don McHenry is a native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Marquette university is located. So when it was announced that WKU would be taking on his hometown team, his phone immediately started blowing up.\n\n“A lot of people back home have been talking to me and have been talking about it all over the media. I think it’s kind of special how that kind of played out that way, that I’m playing against the hometown team,” McHenry said. “I still have the same excitement that I would against anybody else but for it to be them it’s special how it played out that way, like it was meant to be.”\n\nMcHenry leads the Hilltoppers in scoring this season, averaging 15.2 points per game while shooting 47% from the floor and 37% from behind the arc. In the CUSA championship game, McHenry had another “he’s him” moment, leading the team with 25 points and 5 rebounds, earning him the championship game MVP.\n\nMcHenry will be on the court against one of his hometown friends Marquette junior forward David Joplin. The two grew up on the court competing against each other.\n\n“Me and him both, since we’ve been in college, every summer, that’s where the runs be at in Milwaukee or Brookfield. McHenry said. “We’d always run together, even at Marquette sometimes, play runs up there, other guys that were on their team right now was in the open runs so I’m very familiar with a lot of them,” McHenry said. “David Joplin is kind of a long time friend through basketball like AAU and stuff like that we’ve always competed against each other so yeah that’s my guy.”\n\nJoplin is averaging 11 points and 4 rebounds a game in his junior year with Marquette.\n\nMcHenry attended the Milwaukee Academy of Science while Joplin went to Brookfield Central High School, schools that are 23 minutes away from each other.\n\nMake no mistake about it, McHenry is going in with the mindset to pull off the upset and beat his hometown friend. And while it’s a tough mountain climb going against the two seed, Don is ready for the world to see what the Hilltoppers are about.\n\n“I think it’s a big time opportunity for sure, definitely for my team and showing we can compete at any level for sure. I think it’s a great opportunity to show how good we are and the fight we have and just showing how we got here and why we made it here and we’re here for a reason.”\n\nWKU takes on Marquette in the first round of the NCAA Tournament tomorrow afternoon at 1 p.m. CT at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis."
