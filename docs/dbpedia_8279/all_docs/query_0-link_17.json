        "text": "Much has been made of Canada’s lack of star appeal, so much so that head coach Dave Cameron has said he has four ‘No. 2 lines.’\n\nAs such, ice time appears ready for the taking among the forward group and it’s likely that roles could change through the course of the tournament.\n\nAhead of Team Canada’s Dec. 26 opener against Russia, sportsnet.ca takes a look at what each player brings and projects their roles on the team.\n\nRemember to visit the WJHC section on sportsnet.ca for game previews, recaps & video reports.\n\nSEAN COUTURIER\n\nJunior team: Drummondville Voltigeurs (QMJHL)\n\nNHL rights: 2011 eligible\n\nHometown: Bathurst, N.B.\n\nHeight: 6’3″\n\nWeight: 192 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: The youngest player on the team could eventually become one of its most reliable point-producers. Couturier centered a line with Zack Kassian and Marcus Foligno after the team was named and would make a formidable third line. Couturier will be the benefactor of gritty linemates and could see his role increase as the tournament progresses. This will also be an opportunity for him to assert himself as the top draft eligible prospect, similarly to last year’s youngest Canadian player, Taylor Hall.\n\nJADEN SCHWARTZ\n\nJunior team: Colorado College Tigers (NCAA)\n\nNHL rights: St. Louis Blues\n\nHometown: Emerald Park, Sask.\n\nHeight: 5’10”\n\nWeight: 184 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: Schwartz is the type of player Cameron loves to build around. He’s a natural offensive talent, but doesn’t sacrifice defence for offence. Schwartz is a speedy skater and possesses high hockey intelligence. He will be relied on for offence and defence and will be on the ice late when Canada needs a goal or is trying to prevent one.\n\nZACK KASSIAN\n\nJunior team: Windsor Spitfires (OHL)\n\nNHL rights: Buffalo Sabres\n\nHometown: LaSalle, Ont.\n\nHeight: 6’3″\n\nWeight: 226 lbs.\n\nShoots: Right\n\nSynopsis: Kassian is a man among boys physically in junior hockey this season. His role will be to disrupt the opposing team with his brute force and develop hesitation in the opposition. Kassian has the ability to provide offensively and will play the antagonizing role similarly to Steve Downie several years ago.\n\nBRAYDEN SCHENN\n\nJunior team: Brandon Wheat Kings (WHL)\n\nNHL rights: Los Angeles Kings\n\nHometown: Saskatoon, Sask.\n\nHeight: 6’0″\n\nWeight: 199 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: The only player made available by an NHL team, Schenn is also one of only four returnees from last year’s silver-medal winning team. Schenn will be given the opportunity to shine on an offensive line which will give him something to prove after a mediocre tournament last year. He could also see occasional time on the penalty kill.\n\nCASEY CIZIKAS\n\nJunior team: Mississauga St. Michael’s Majors (OHL)\n\nNHL rights: New York Islanders\n\nHometown: Mississauga, Ont.\n\nHeight: 6’2″\n\nWeight: 191 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: Cizikas is a candidate for the 13th forward position and his ice time will likely be limited. He has the ability to play defensively and could earn a penalty killing role, particularly since he excels as a defensively reliable forward on Cameron’s junior team.\n\nQUINTON HOWDEN\n\nJunior team: Moose Jaw Warriors (WHL)\n\nNHL rights: Florida Panthers\n\nHometown: Oak Bank, Man.\n\nHeight: 6’2″\n\nWeight: 192 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: Howden’s role will be as a grinding, energy-type player on Canada’s fourth line. Like every other forward on this team, he has the ability to score, but he won’t likely earn the opportunity to showcase his offence. Howden has both the size and ability to provide valuable minutes in an energy role.\n\nCURTIS HAMILTON\n\nJunior team: Saskatoon Blades (WHL)\n\nNHL rights: Edmonton Oilers\n\nHometown: Kelowna, B.C.\n\nHeight: 6’3″\n\nWeight: 202 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: Hamilton is the son of Kelowna Rockets general manager Bruce Hamilton. Curtis will be a regular on the team’s penalty killing units and should develop a niche as an energy player on the team’s fourth line. Cameron will love Hamilton’s hockey sense and two-way ability, but it’s unlikely he will play in a top six role.\n\nMARCUS FOLIGNO\n\nJunior team: Sudbury Wolves (OHL)\n\nNHL rights: Buffalo Sabres\n\nHometown: Sudbury, Ont.\n\nHeight: 6’1″\n\nWeight: 200 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: The other half of Canada’s bash brothers, Foligno will play a similar role to Zack Kassian on the team’s third line. Foligno and Kassian will provide Canada with the intimidating presence and could chip in with the occasional goal due to their hard work. It will be a homecoming of sorts for Foligno, who was born in Buffalo and could have represented the home country. Foligno chose Canada, just like Brandon Kozun — who also holds dual citizenship — did in last year’s tournament.\n\nRYAN JOHANSEN\n\nJunior team: Portland Winterhawks (WHL)\n\nNHL rights: Columbus Blue Jackets\n\nHometown: Port Moody, B.C.\n\nHeight: 6’2″\n\nWeight: 193 lbs.\n\nShoots: Right\n\nSynopsis: Johansen came a long way in a short time. The fourth-overall pick of last year’s draft should earn the opportunity to showcase his offensive game. Johansen is a reliable point-producer in Portland and will likely center the team’s second line. He could be a valuable secondary contributor.\n\nLOUIS LEBLANC\n\nJunior team: Montreal Juniors (QMJHL)\n\nNHL rights: Montreal Canadiens\n\nHometown: Point-Claire, Que.\n\nHeight: 5’11”\n\nWeight: 181 lbs.\n\nShoots: Right\n\nSynopsis: Leblanc will be relied upon to produce much of Canada’s offence in this tournament. He dominated league play on many nights after leaving Harvard for his hometown Montreal Juniors in the QMJHL. His natural offensive ability as both a playmaker and a scorer will make him difficult to defend. Leblanc will play in all offensive roles.\n\nCODY EAKIN\n\nJunior team: Swift Current Broncos (WHL)\n\nNHL rights: Washington Capitals\n\nHometown: Winnipeg, Man.\n\nHeight: 6’0″\n\nWeight: 187 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: Eakin is a solid two-way forward with underrated offensive ability. His game resembles that of the player he models it after, Ottawa’s Mike Fisher. Eakin will likely begin the tournament on an offensive line and could also earn minutes as a penalty killer.\n\nCARTER ASHTON\n\nJunior team: Tri-City Americans (WHL)\n\nNHL rights: Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nHometown: Saskatoon, Sask.\n\nHeight: 6’3″\n\nWeight: 219 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: While Ashton can produce offensively in junior, he isn’t as natural a scorer as some of the other forwards on this team. He will likely fight for ice time on the team’s fourth line as an energy player, but might not factor into the penalty kill. He provides another big body that could help slow the opposition’s defence.\n\nBRETT CONNOLLY\n\nJunior team: Prince George Cougars (WHL)\n\nNHL rights: Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nHometown: Prince George, B.C.\n\nHeight: 6’2″\n\nWeight: 181 lbs.\n\nShoots: Right\n\nSynopsis: Connolly is perhaps the most gifted natural scorer on the team. He possesses a wicked wrist shot and always finds himself in the right places at the right time. Connolly’s intelligence will also ensure offence doesn’t come at the expense of defence.\n\nJARED COWEN\n\nJunior team: Spokane Chiefs (WHL)\n\nNHL rights: Ottawa Senators\n\nHometown: Allan, Sask.\n\nHeight: 6’5″\n\nWeight: 227 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: Cowen is one of three returnees from last year’s defensive core, but will see more ice time than he did a year ago. He should have much to prove after a disastrous tournament a year ago. Cowen was not reliable and his ice time diminished rapidly as the tournament progressed. He will start in the top four and play on the penalty kill.\n\nSIMON DESPRES\n\nJunior team: Saint John Sea Dogs (QMJHL)\n\nNHL rights: Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nHometown: Laval, Que.\n\nHeight: 6’4″\n\nWeight: 222 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: Despres doesn’t do anything fancy, but is solid at both ends of the rink. He doesn’t figure into an offensive role or as a shutdown defender. Despres will likely begin on either the third pairing or as the seventh defenceman.\n\nDYLAN OLSEN\n\nJunior team: Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs (NCAA)\n\nNHL rights: Chicago Blackhawks\n\nHometown: Calgary, Alta.\n\nHeight: 6’2″\n\nWeight: 223 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: Olsen will likely begin on the third pairing, but could earn more ice time with his solid and dependable play. He’s an all-around, mobile defenceman that could play on the team’s penalty kill. Olsen is the first player from UMD to represent Canada at the world juniors.\n\nERIK GUDBRANSON\n\nJunior team: Kingston Frontenacs (OHL)\n\nNHL rights: Florida Panthers\n\nHometown: Orleans, Ont.\n\nHeight: 6’4″\n\nWeight: 211 lbs.\n\nShoots: Right\n\nSynopsis: Gudbranson will be Canada’s steady and reliable defender. He can play any role, but will most likely be part of Canada’s shutdown pairing and a defensive specialist. He has the size to punish the opposing forwards and make crisp, outlet passes. Gudbranson will most likely be one of Canada’s unsung heroes.\n\nRYAN ELLIS\n\nJunior team: Windsor Spitfires (OHL)\n\nNHL rights: Nashville Predators\n\nHometown: Freelton, Ont.\n\nHeight: 5’10”\n\nWeight: 184 lbs.\n\nShoots: Right\n\nSynopsis: The Canadian captain will bring a bit of everything. Ellis will be relied upon as a leader as a three-time representative. He has a cannon of a slapshot and makes smart, first passes. His ability to pick apart a defence will be crucial in starting the rush. He will also play in defensive situations and probably play an average of 30 minutes per game. Ellis was inconsistent in last year’s tournament, which should motivate him to step up his play this time around.\n\nTYSON BARRIE\n\nJunior team: Kelowna Rockets (WHL)\n\nNHL rights: Colorado Avalanche\n\nHometown: Victoria, B.C.\n\nHeight: 5’10”\n\nWeight: 190 lbs.\n\nShoots: Right\n\nSynopsis: Barrie brings an element that may have been missing in Canada’s pursuit of six-straight tournament wins last year: mobility. His skating stride is fluent and effortless, which will help him keep pace with quick forwards. Barrie will play an offensive role, but most likely on the third pair at even strength. He has an accurate shot that should create chances on the power-play.\n\nCALVIN DE HAAN\n\nJunior team: Oshawa Generals (OHL)\n\nNHL rights: New York Islanders\n\nHometown: Carp, Ont.\n\nHeight: 6’0″\n\nWeight: 189 lbs.\n\nShoots: Left\n\nSynopsis: de Haan is the third returnee to Canada’s defensive core. His ice time was limited at last year’s tournament after taking a hit away from the play against Switzerland in the round robin. He should play in a top four role and on the team’s power-play. de Haan’s skating ability and vision will make him a valuable offensive specialist.\n\nOLIVIER ROY\n\nJunior team: Acadie-Bathurst Titan (QMJHL)\n\nNHL rights: Edmonton Oilers\n\nHometown: Causapscal, Que.\n\nHeight: 5’11”\n\nWeight: 186 lbs.\n\nCatches: Left\n\nSynopsis: Roy will likely earn the starting job, but his leash may be short. He was inconsistent on a team with championship aspirations in Bathurst this season in spite of his reputation as a money goaltender. He’s a fierce competitor and will need to find consistency to help Canada back to the top.\n\nMARK VISENTIN\n\nJunior team: Niagara IceDogs (OHL)\n\nNHL rights: Phoenix Coyotes\n\nHometown: Waterdown, Ont.\n\nHeight: 6’1″\n\nWeight: 198 lbs.\n\nCatches: Left"
