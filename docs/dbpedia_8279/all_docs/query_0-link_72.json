        "text": "As Hockey Canada remains under intense scrutiny over its handling of a lawsuit alleging a sexual assault involving players from the 2018 national junior team, the organization is reopening its investigation and some of the players have been speaking out.\n\nFacing a flight of sponsorship dollars over recent weeks, the organization announced in an open letter to Canadians on Thursday morning that it is reopening the investigation into the alleged sexual assault and it will be mandatory for all players on that team to participate.\n\nSenior leaders told the House of Commons Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage last month that players were “encouraged” but not required to cooperate with the initial probe into the matter.\n\n“We know we have not done enough to address the actions of some members of the 2018 national junior team or to end the culture of toxic behaviour within our game,” Hockey Canada wrote in its letter Thursday. “For that we unreservedly apologize.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“We know we need to do more to address the behaviours, on and off the ice, that conflict with what Canadians want hockey to be, and which undermine the many good things that the game brings to our country.”\n\nHockey Canada officials have said neither the original and later abandoned probe, nor inquiries by police in London, Ont., were able to identify the alleged perpetrators. Robert Talach, lawyer for the complainant, told Global News on Thursday his client is participating in the reopened probe.\n\nOne player from the 2018 World Juniors team, Victor Mete, recently took to Twitter to call the allegations “appalling,” adding he was not involved. Since the eight alleged perpetrators haven’t been identified, he wrote, “the incident has left an unfortunate cloud over every player who was on the Canadian team.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe allegations in the lawsuit have not been tested in court. Neither have criminal charges been laid.\n\nHockey Canada officials said in committee testimony on June 20 that police in London, Ont., were notified the day after Hockey Canada learned of the allegation in June 2018 but that the investigators did not determine the identities of the accused.\n\nThe London police investigation was separate from the external probe conducted for Hockey Canada by Henein Hutchison. Neither of those efforts determined the identities of the alleged perpetrators. When contacted by Global News on Thursday, London police said they could not comment.\n\n“The London Police Service is unable to comment on any alleged criminal investigation,” a spokesperson for the force said.\n\n“The London Police Service is committed to thoroughly investigating all complaints of sexual assault. Along with our community partners, we will fully support those who come forward and we encourage anyone who has experienced sexual violence to report the incident to police so that the matter can be investigated.”\n\nHockey Canada’s Scott Smith said in June that the organization settled the lawsuit “on behalf of all the defendants.” He also said that after learning of the statement of claim, Hockey Canada “communicated with the players’ representatives.”\n\n“You communicated directly with the counsel or representative of the eight different players,” one Liberal MP asked for clarification during the committee meeting.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“It was with their representative,” Smith said.\n\nHockey Canada’s Tom Renney later added: “We had no idea of knowing where to focus our energy at all, and it would have been wrong nonetheless, so we contacted every player and all the teams.”\n\nTSN first reported on the allegations in May, citing a lawsuit filed by the woman who made the allegation earlier this year. In it, she alleged eight players from the Canadian Hockey League and the World Junior championship team bought her alcoholic beverages and that she went back to a nearby hotel with one of the players.\n\nTSN reported that after allegedly engaging in sexual acts with the woman, a player cited only as John Doe 1 “invited the remainder of the John Doe defendants into the room without the knowledge or consent of the Plaintiff,” where they allegedly repeatedly sexually assaulted her.\n\nMembers of Parliament raised serious concerns about the allegations during that committee, citing their multimillion-dollar contracts with National Hockey League teams, and the chance they could coach young Canadians one day.\n\n“It’s not unreasonable now to imagine that many of the eight players subject to these gang rape allegations enjoy lucrative professional careers,” said Sports Minister Pascale St-Onge to the committee.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nConservative MP Kevin Waugh posed a question to the Hockey Canada officials: “Does it concern any of you in front of me today that these alleged so-called rapists have ongoing careers in amateur and professional hockey today, and some day could be coaching?”\n\nHockey Canada’s roster for the 2018 World Junior championship included 20 players and two goaltenders. Smith told the committee he believed 19 of those were at the Hockey Canada event preceding the alleged sexual assault.\n\nGlobal News reached out to the agents for all players on the 2018 Hockey Canada roster asking whether each player had participated in the Henein Hutchison probe, and whether they were involved in the alleged sexual assault.\n\nRegarding questions about six players on the 2018 roster put to sports agency Wasserman Hockey, Global News received a statement from Scott Fenton, a criminal defence lawyer based in Toronto.\n\n“We act for one of the players referenced in your email inquiry and have consulted with counsel for the other players you reference. All of Global News’ questions will be asked and answered during the pending NHL investigation. That said, none of the players you reference engaged in any wrongdoing, all of the players cooperated fully with the independent London Police Service investigation in 2018, and all players were then cleared of any wrongdoing,” Fenton wrote.\n\n“Naming any of these players now, or attempting to associate any of them in any way with alleged criminal wrongdoing, or alleging that they were not cooperative with the London Police or willing to cooperate with Hockey Canada, will constitute materially false statements constituting defamation causing serious financial and reputational harm.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBelow are the players on the roster, which is publicly available. For players whose agents did not respond, Global News also attempted to get answers from their teams and also reached out to the NHL Players’ Association for comment.\n\nBorn in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Batherson lists New Minas, N.S., as his hometown on the Hockey Canada roster.\n\nHe played forward for Team Canada at the 2018 World Junior championship.\n\nBatherson plays right wing and was drafted by the Ottawa Senators in 2017 in the fourth round.\n\nHe is 24-years-old.\n\nIn September 2021, Sportsnet reported Batherson re-signed a contract with the Ottawa Senators for the next six years, worth $29.85 million.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nGlobal News contacted Quartexx Management multiple times but has not yet received a response.
