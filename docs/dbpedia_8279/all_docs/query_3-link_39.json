        "text": "(May 16, 2024) BERNARDSVILLE, NJ – Congressman Tom Kean, Jr. (NJ-07) officially launched his first Law Enforcement Hometown Hero Initiative, honoring local law enforcement officers across New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District.\n\nCongressman Kean took submissions throughout New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District and will be highlighting law enforcement heroes throughout the year. Law Enforcement Hometown Heroes were nominated by their supervisors and chiefs from their respective agencies throughout the district.\n\nNational Police Week occurs every May as a time to honor America’s law enforcement community. Congressman Kean is an original cosponsor of the National Police Week Resolution.\n\n“Law enforcement officers in New Jersey and across the country face difficult and thankless tasks responding to danger in our communities,” said Congressman Kean. “It is humbling to honor local law enforcement officers from my district as a small token of appreciation for their bravery and commitment to ensuring the safety of our constituents. I will always support the men and women in blue who keep our communities safe.”\n\nTo kick off the Law Enforcement Hometown Hero initiative, Congressman Kean recognized Sergeant Tracy Baldassare from the Bernards Township Police Department. View the post HERE.\n\nCongressman Kean recently hosted a roundtable to address rising crime in New Jersey with county sheriffs and undersheriffs from Somerset, Union, Hunterdon, Morris, Warren, and Sussex.
