        "text": "To be considered for an at-large bid to the BJNC, a team must enter the event through the approved USAV online registration system as an Open or USA team, and submit complete and accurate results by all posted deadlines. In the absence of results, a letter of explanation addressing the reason(s) why such results are not available, and reason(s) why the team should be considered for an at-large bid should be submitted. The letter is to be submitted to the USAV Events Department by the entry deadline.\n\nPlease see the current BJNC Pre-Tournament Manual for deadlines and other information (www.usavolleyball.org).\n\nThe teams awarded the at-large bids will be selected by the BCC with final approval of the USAV Events Department using the following criteria:\n\n1. Must have competed in at least one (1) bid tournament (in a bid division—Open OR USA)\n\n2. Register your team in the desired At-Large division for the BJNC in AES and send payment and the entry form\n\nby the posted deadline (may not register for both Open & USA but if a team is not awarded an Open bid, it will\n\nbe considered for USA). *Please note: If previously registered in club division please reach out to [email protected] to change divisions to the desired At Large division\n\n3. Strength\n\n4. Record against Qualified teams\n\n5. Record against At Large applicants\n\n6. Past year’s BJNC finish of the rostered players\n\n7. Date of entry\n\nThe BCC committee and the USAV Events Department will rank all Open At-Large and USA At-Large applicants together regardless of the division entered and assign bids by that agreed upon rank. Teams awarded an At-Large bid have up to three (3) business days to accept or decline the bid. If a team declines a bid, the declining bid will trickle down to the next team in rank order. If a team accepts a bid but does not participate in BJNC, the team is subject to sanctions for not using bids.\n\nThe BCC and USAV EVENTS DEPARTMENT reserve the right to accept as many or as few teams applying for an At-Large Bid to round out numbers and create even pool play. Note: Any team that declines an Open or USA bid at a bid tournament will be ineligible for an at-large bid. *In the Open Division(s) Hawaii and Puerto Rico will be given one (1) bid for the 14s-18s & underage divisions. Each territory will award those bids to a team in each age division by any means they deem appropriate (i.e. a tournament or via an application process). Any other team wishing to receive a bid for the 14 or 15 & under age divisions must attend a bid tournament and apply for an At-Large bid if necessary. If Hawaii or Puerto Rico choose to award the allotted bids via bid tournament, that tournament is not considered a sanctioned USAV bid tournament and does not count towards the required criteria to be eligible to apply for an at-large bid."
