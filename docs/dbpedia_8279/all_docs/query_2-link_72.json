You may still purchase/renew, but the known issue is producing an error message and not automatically sending your membership card via email. If you make payment and received the payment confirmation email, your membership has been purchased/renewed for 2020.\n\nYou can use the Membership Card Look-up Tool to see your Membership# and Expiration date. https://www.usapowerlifting.com/member-tools/memberLookup.php\n\nProgrammers are working on this matter and we hope to have a resolution soon.\n\nThank you for your patience."
