Each student-athlete has a support system around them inclusive of a head coach, position coach, strength and conditioning coach, athletic trainers, teachers, college advisors, and more to aid in the developmental process that includes:\n\nAn individual football skill developmental plan\n\nA team periodization plan\n\nAn individual position periodization plan\n\nAn athletic and Academy personal development plan\n\nCollege-preparatory environment\n\nIMG Academy football is structured like a collegiate program so that student-athletes understand the requirements on and off the field and are prepared for the schedule at the next level. IMG Academy football student-athletes not only train within a schedule that mirrors that of a collegiate program, but they are also expected to maintain similar expectations, such as respect, academic success, responsibility and ownership, mental and physical toughness, and complete personal and athletic development.\n\nTracking growth & success\n\nStudent-athletes will measure their development and success through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including:\n\nPosition-specific statistics\n\nGame day evaluations\n\nPractice tapes\n\nStrength & conditioning goals\n\nAcademic progress\n\nTeams\n\nWith four teams competing across various levels, IMG Academy football will identify which program is the best fit for prospective student-athletes in grades 6-12 based on their age, skill level, position, and overall goals.\n\nIMG Academy is a full member of the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA), and the National Team competes as an independent. IMG Academy follows the practice requirements and standards issued by the FHSAA.\n\nNATIONAL\n\nIMG Academy’s National Team takes on an incredibly competitive schedule against some of the nation’s most elite programs. Players will arrive in July to begin their pre-season training camp, compete in 10+ games in the Fall, train and develop during the Winter off-season, and continue to train in the Spring before the Spring Practice Game. This team is comprised of some of the nation’s top collegiate recruits as well as those with aspirations to compete in the NFL.\n\nVARSITY\n\nIMG Academy has two varsity teams (Blue and White) consisting of student-athletes who train with IMG Academy’s expert, varsity coaching staff. IMG Academy Varsity White team competes against the top 250 ranked teams by MaxPreps in the state of Florida, while also traveling out of state along with international travel for competition. This team has been ranked as a top 50 team in Florida on MaxPreps as well. IMG Academy Varsity Blue competes against the bottom 250 ranked teams by MaxPreps in the state of Florida. All varsity student-athletes have an opportunity to develop alongside other players of similar skill levels while working towards achieving their peak potential in an unrivaled environment. The total varsity program operates with around 90 to 100 athletes each year. The varsity program places athletes at all levels of college football, over the last 4 years the IMG Academy Varsity Program has placed 87 players in college."
