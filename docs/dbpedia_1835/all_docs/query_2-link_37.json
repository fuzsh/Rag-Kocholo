        "text": "Are the wait lists currently open?\n\nThe Housing Authority manages 12 different wait lists, which open and close based on availability and other factors.\n\nFor current information on status of open and closed wait lists, please refer to www.sacwaitlist.com.\n\nHow can I apply for assistance through the Housing Choice Voucher/Section 8 Program?\n\nApply online at www.sacwaitlist.com using any device with internet access and an email address. There is no charge to apply. Information can be translated in multiple languages directly on the website. Or, you may submit a request for assistance or for a paper application by clicking here. For reasonable accommodation, please call 916-440-1390 | TTY 711 or 1 (800) 855-7100.\n\nHow can I be notified when the wait list is open?\n\nWaiting list opening notices will be posted on SHRA’s website, Facebook and Twitter as well as in the local media including the local newspaper. We encourage you to monitor our website or to follow us on Facebook and/or Twitter.\n\nAfter I apply, how long should I expect to be on the waiting list?\n\nOnce you have been added, the length of time spent on the waiting lists depends on multiple factors such as when the application was submitted and on the number of preference points the family or individual has. Preference points are based on factors such as:\n\n• if you are a resident or work in Sacramento County,\n\n• if someone in your household is disabled,\n\n• if you are rent burdened (the amount of rent you currently pay compared to income),\n\n• if you or a family member is a veteran,\n\n• if you are homeless.\n\nFor more information on the preference system, refer to the current HCV Administrative Plan at this link.\n\nThe frequency and volume of applicants selected from each of the waiting lists varies as well depending on the number of families exiting the program, making way for new program participants. The best way to ensure that you are selected as quickly as possible is to sign up for all waiting lists for which you qualify and are interested. Due to the fact that the waiting lists are constantly changing as discussed above, we are unable to provide you with your exact position on the waiting list.\n\nCan anyone apply to be on the wait list?\n\nEveryone has an equal opportunity to apply for housing, and U.S. citizenship is not a requirement to submit an application.\n\nIf an applicant is placed on the wait list (one of the 7,000 that will be randomly selected), once they are contacted for a housing opportunity, they will be asked to provide up to date information that will assist in verifying their eligibility to receiving housing assistance. At least one family member listed on the application must be a U.S. citizen or legal immigrant to be eligible to receive a voucher.\n\nHow do I update my information once I am on the waiting list?\n\nIn order to maintain your status on the waiting lists and so that staff can reach you if you are selected, you must notify SHRA in writing within 30 days of any changes to your household, such as:\n\n• a change of address,\n\n• addition or removal of household members,\n\n• an increase or decrease in income.\n\n• change of email address or phone number.\n\nTo update your information, visit sacwaitlist.com.\n\nDuring a recent open wait list period, I was contacted by an entity who said they could help me with my application by paying for a credit check. Is that a normal part of your process?\n\nNo, it is not. There is never a fee to apply. Please do not provide any money or provide any personal information to any organization that may contact you.\n\nIf I was removed or denied from the waiting list, what can I do to appeal the denial or the removal?\n\nIf the application is denied for cause (ie. did not meet eligibility or preference requirements), families may appeal the decision by requesting an Informal Review or hearing. The process for requesting an Informal Review is written on the letter denying the application. If the family was removed from the waitlist for failing to respond, there is no right to an informal review, however, the family may request to be reinstated due to extenuating circumstances. Please contact staff regarding the documentation and proof required to receive this type of reinstatement.\n\nWhat if I have a criminal conviction on my record? Am I able to receive housing assistance?\n\nAs part of the application, staff will run a background check on members of the household listed on the application over the age of 18. If there are convictions related to drugs, fraudulent or violent criminal activity that took place within the past three years, it may lead to further review of your application. An individualized review of mitigating circumstances will be conducted before a decision is made. If the application is still denied after individualized review, this decision can be appealed by requesting an Informal Review.\n\nDoes my prior rental history and credit status impact my eligibility?\n\nAs the HCV program works with landlords in the private rental market, each landlord has different screening guidelines and standards. Rental and credit history are evaluated by the landlords and may impact your ability to obtain assistance.\n\nDo I need to be a citizen to receive housing assistance?\n\nEveryone has an equal opportunity to apply for housing, and U.S. citizenship is not a requirement to submit an application.\n\nIf an applicant is placed on the wait list (one of the 7,000 that will be randomly selected), once they are contacted for a housing opportunity, they will be asked to provide up to date information that will assist in verifying their eligibility to receiving housing assistance. At least one family member listed on the application must be a U.S. citizen or legal immigrant to be eligible to receive a voucher.\n\nWhat are the income limits to qualify for HCV housing?\n\nA: The maximum allowable income to qualify for HCV is listed below.\n\nFamily Size Income Limit 1$41,300 2$47,150 3$53,050 4$58,950 5$63,650 6$68,400 7$73,100 8$77,850 9$82,550 10$87,250 11$92,000 12$96,700\n\nThe full table is available HERE\n\nWhat is a “reasonable accommodation”?\n\nA “reasonable accommodation” is a change, exception, or adjustment to a rule, policy, practice, or service that may be necessary for a person with a disability to have an equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from SHRA’s housing programs. The reasonable accommodation process applies to both applicants and program participants and determinations are made on a case-by-case basis. A reasonable accommodation must first be requested, preferably in writing, before it can be considered and both the disability and the need for an accommodation must be verified.\n\nCan a request for a reasonable accommodation be denied?\n\nYes. A request for a reasonable accommodation may be denied if:\n\nthere is no disability-related need for the accommodation;\n\nthe accommodation is not reasonable;\n\nit would impose an undue financial, operational or administrative burden on the Housing Authority;\n\nthere is an alternative available other than the requested accommodation;\n\nthe disability is not verified.\n\nSHRA’s reasonable accommodation policy can be found at this link under the Public Housing Agency Plans and Reports tab in the Housing Choice Voucher Administrative Plan document.\n\nFor more information about the Housing Choice Voucher program, contact the Customer Service line at (916) 440-1390.
