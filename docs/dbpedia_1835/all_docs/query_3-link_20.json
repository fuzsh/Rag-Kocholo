        "text": "Chandra Newsletter Issue 18\n\nStudies of Dark Energy with X-ray Observatories\n\nAlexey Vikhlinin\n\nI review the contribution of Chandra X-ray Observatory to studies of dark energy. There are two broad classes of observable effects of dark energy: evolution of the expansion rate of the Universe, and slow-down in the rate of growth of cosmic structures. Chandra has detected and measured both of these effects through observations of galaxy clusters. Combination of the Chandra results with other cosmological datasets leads to 5% constraints on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, and limits possible deviations of gravity on large scales from General Relativity.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe accelerated expansion of the Universe discovered in 1998 [1, 2] and the associated problem of dark energy are widely considered as one of the greatest unsolved problems in science. In this short article, I will summarize the contribution of X-ray astronomy (primarily, Chandra and XMM-Newton) to the currently emerging picture of empirical properties of dark energy.\n\nThere are two main observable manifestations of dark energy. The first is its effect on the expansion rate of the Universe as a whole, which can be probed through the distance-redshift relation using âstandard candlesâ such as type Ia supernovae, or standard rulers such as baryonic acoustic oscillations in the large-scale distribution of galaxies [3]. This broad class of cosmological observations is often referred to as âgeometricâ methods. The second effect is the impact of dark energy on the rate of growth of large-scale structures. As the Universe enters the accelerated expansion phase around z ~ 0.8, it is expected that the rate of structure growth slows down. If this effect is observed sufficiently accurately â e.g., through weak lensing on the large-scale structures, redshift-space distortions in the distribution of galaxies [4], or through evolution of galaxy clusters as described below â it should significantly improve constraints on dark energy properties in combination with the geometric methods [3]. In addition, the growth of large-scale structures can be used to test, or put limits on, any departures from General Relativity on the 10â100 Mpc scales [5].\n\nX-ray astronomy's contribution to observational cosmology is primarily through studies of galaxy clusters. Cluster observations provide both the geometrical and growth of structure cosmological tests. The distance-redshift relation can be measured either through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich [6] effect, or using the expected universality of the intracluster gas mass fraction, fgas = Mgas/Mtot [7,8]. Both methods can also be used to determine the absolute value of the Hubble constant through observations of low-z clusters1. The mass function of galaxy clusters is exponentially sensitive to the underlying amplitude of linear density perturbations and therefore can be used to implement the growth of structure test [11].\n\nIn the Chandra and XMM-Newton era, X-ray observations of galaxy clusters have reached sufficient maturity for a successful implementation of both types of cosmological tests. This success is based on significant advances in our ability to select and statistically characterize large cluster samples, and to get detailed X-ray data at both low and high redshifts. At the same time, quick progress in theoretical modeling of clusters (see [12] for a recent review) resulted in better understanding of their physics and improved ability to obtain reliable mass estimates from the data. These advances are reviewed below.\n\nCombining the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations and X-ray data for the same cluster naturally provides the absolute distance to the object [9]. In the gas fraction method, it is assumed that the baryon mass fraction within clusters, fb, approximates the mean cosmic value, Î©b//Î©m. The absolute value of this ratio is now very well known from the CMB data [10]. On the other hand, the mass fraction of the hot intracluster gas, the dominant baryonic component in clusters, derived from the X-ray data is proportional to h-3/2 (see below in the text), therefore h can be extracted from these measurements after correcting fgas for the contribution of stellar mass to the total baryon budget.\n\nProgress in understanding of clusters\n\nSamples\n\nThe ROSAT mission which operated in the 1990s proved to be a great resource for selecting large, complete samples of massive galaxy clusters reaching redshifts beyond z=1 [13]. ROSAT carried out surveys in a wide range of sensitivity and solid angle. The sensitivity and angular resolution in the all-sky survey mode are well-suited for detection of clusters at low redshifts (e.g., the BCS and REFLEX surveys, [14, 15]). With substantial effort on the optical identification side, the all-sky survey data can be used to select exceptionally massive clusters out to z ~ 0.5 (MACS survey, [16]). In the pointed mode, ROSAT PSPC covered just over 2% of the extragalactic sky. However, the sensitivity and angular resolution in the pointed mode are sufficient for detection of z ~ 0.6 clusters with masses matching those of the low-z objects detected in the all-sky survey. Just such a sample of clusters is provided by the 400d survey [17]. The REFLEX, MACS, and 400d surveys, several hundred clusters each, are the main sources for cosmological observations with Chandra.\n\nDetailed Measurements\n\nChandra and XMM-Newton observations of low-redshift objects now provide detailed measurements of the radial profiles of the density, temperature, and metallicity of the intracluster medium (ICM) over a wide range of radii. Several studies (Chandra samples of high-mass relaxed clusters [18]; Chandra studies of low-M groups [19]; XMM-Newton representative cluster samples [20] including both relaxed and unrelaxed objects) provide a consistent picture. The gas density and temperature profiles show a high degree of regularity and follow simple scalings outside the inner cluster region (Figures 1 and 2). At large radii, the observed scaling of the ICM entropy with cluster mass is close to that predicted for purely gravitational heating [21, 22]. However, deviations from such a scaling are observed at small radii, indicating more complex physics in the inner cluster region. Such measurements are important for cosmological applications of the cluster data for several reasons. First, they provide the necessary observational ingredients for estimation of the cluster total masses via the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. Second, the observed ICM profiles can be used to verify numerical models of the cluster formation [21]. The main role of numerical models in the cosmological applications of the cluster data is to provide predictions for the scaling relations between total mass and global X-ray properties. These predictions can be used reliably only because we can verify that numerical models reasonably well reproduce even more complex cluster properties. Last, self-similarity of the observed ICM profiles directly demonstrates that the cluster properties are predominantly determined by a single parameter, its mass. This is a key notion in the theory of cluster formation, and the basis for using clusters as cosmological probes.\n\nMass Measurements\n\nThe existence of scaling relations between various cluster parameters and total mass has long been recognized. However, establishing the absolute scale in such relations is a long-standing problem. The situation today is much improved. A good agreement, at a ~ 10% level in mass, exists [23] between normalizations of the mass vs. proxy relations determined from the X-ray measurements in relaxed clusters (e.g., [18]), âmeasuredâ in numerical simulations [24, 25], and obtained from weak lensing observations of representative samples of intermediate redshift clusters [26, 27]. A 10% accuracy in the absolute cluster mass calibration is indicated not only by the agreement of the results from different methods, but also indirectly by agreement of the amplitude of density perturbations derived from X-ray clusters [28], from optically selected clusters with masses calibrated through weak lensing [29], and from the latest weak lensing shear studies [30].\n\nThe advances in theoretical and observational studies of galaxy clusters outlined above, which were triggered in large part by the Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, have enabled efficient application of the geometrical and structure-based cosmological tests.\n\nGeometric test with fgas\n\nGalaxy clusters are expected to have a nearly cosmic mix of baryonic and dark matter, fb = Mb/Mtot â Î©b/Î©M, because their mass is orders of magnitude higher than the Jeans mass scale and hence baryons and dark matter are not separated as the clusters grow from large-scale structures [31]. The universality of the baryon fraction in clusters was originally used as a method for measuring Î©M, but in the mid-1990's it was realized that it can be also used as an independent distance indicator [7, 8]. The mass of the intracluster gas (contributing 80%â90% to the total baryonic mass in massive clusters [32]) derived from the X-ray image is proportional to d5/2 where d is the distance to the cluster, while dynamically-derived total mass scales as d1. Therefore, the apparent baryon mass fraction is proportional to 33/2 and is constant as a function of z only if we use the correct distance-redshift relation.\n\nEarly pilot studies based on this test were inconclusive [8, 33]. Comparison of the Chandra results [34] with these early works exemplifies just how revolutionary Chandra has been for cluster cosmology (Figure 3). The object-to-object scatter is now low and the trends in the fgas(z) data arising from assuming a âwrongâ cosmological model are clearly detectable. In particular, the expected absence of redshift trends in the fgas measurements is only for the range of parameters corresponding to the âconcordantâ cosmological models, while strong trends in fgas (z) are found if, e.g., one assumes an Î©M= 1 model without a cosmological constant [34].\n\nUnfortunately, the assumption that fgas (and even the total baryon fraction including stellar mass) in clusters is constant and universal is only approximately accurate because there are observed trends with radius within individual clusters. The fgas values measured at a fixed fraction of the virial radius also show a trend with cluster mass [18, 19, 22]. The nature of these trends remains uncertain. Feasible explanations include different star formation efficiencies in high and low-mass clusters, and some form of non-gravitational heating of the gas in the central regions. Existence of fgas trends in the low-z clusters almost certainly implies that fgas should slightly vary with redshift. Allen et al. [34] corrected for some of these effects using results from numerical simulations. Unfortunately, non-negligible systematic uncertainties must be assigned (e.g., Allen et al. allowed for Â± 10% variations of intrinsic fgas between z=0 and 1), and they dominate the final error budget when the fgas test is used, for example, to constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w. Even with the current level of systematic uncertainties, the fgas test provides interesting constraints on the value of w (Figure 4).\n\nGrowth of structure test\n\nEvolution of the cluster mass function traces (with exponential magnification) the growth of linear density perturbations. Growth of structure and the distance-redshift relation are similarly sensitive to properties of dark energy, and also are highly complementary sources of cosmological information (e.g., [35]). Pre-Chandra studies using the cluster mass function as a cosmological probe were limited by small sample sizes. They also had to use either poor proxies for the total mass (e.g., the X-ray flux) or inaccurate measurements (e.g., temperatures with large uncertainties). Despite these limitations, reasonable constraints could still be derived on Î©m (e.g., [36, 37]). However, constraints on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter from such studies were weak.\n\nAs discussed above, the situation with the cluster mass function data has dramatically improved in the past three years, and the new measurements allow us to track the growth of density perturbations over the redshift interval z=0-0.7. These measurements confirm the slow-down of that growth caused by cosmic acceleration, improve constraints on the equation-of-state parameter, and even put limits on possible departures from General Relativity on ~10 Mpc scales.\n\nThe sensitivity of the cluster mass function to the presence of dark energy is illustrated in Figure 5. The cluster sample used in [28] provides sufficient statistics to measure the amplitude of density perturbations independently in the redshift intervals z=0.015-0.15, 0.35-0.45, 0.45-0.55, and 0.55-0.9. Together with the amplitude of perturbations at z ~1000 derived from the cosmic microwave background fluctuations, these data track the growth of perturbations over a wide redshift interval (Figure 6). The slowdown of the perturbations growth at low redshifts is clearly seen, and the data indicate that the transition from fast to slow growth was fast and occurred at z ~ 1, as expected for models with dark energy (see, e.g., the solid red line in Figure 6 and compare it with the growth histories for low-density models without dark energy shown by blue dashed lines).\n\nThe evolution of the cluster mass function measured from the 400d survey provides sufficient statistics to constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameter (Figure 7). The combination of the structure growth data with other cosmological datasets results, as was long anticipated, in dramatic improvement of the constraints. For example, a non-evolving equation-of-state parameter is constrained to be w0 = -0.99 Â± 0.045 (inner ellipse in Figure 7); without the cluster data, the statistical and systematic uncertainties on w0 are a factor of 1.5-2 worse [28].\n\nTesting non-GR models\n\nPerhaps a more interesting application of the cluster mass function is to test for possible deviations from General Relativity on ~10 Mpc scales. Non-GR gravity theories modify the distance-redshift relations. However, the changes in d(z) generally can be mimicked by variations of the equation-of-state parameter for âtrueâ dark energy and therefore non-GR models cannot be tested by geometric methods alone. We can test them using a combination of geometric measurements with the growth of structure data. Each of the essential ingredients of the cluster mass function theory â the growth of linear density perturbations, non-linear collapse of large-amplitude perturbations, and relations between the cluster mass and its observed properties â is potentially modified in non-GR gravity models.\n\nUnfortunately, self-consistent predictions for the properties of the cluster population in non-GR models are still rare. Usually, the published analyses are restricted to predicted modifications of the structure growth rate in the linear regime. It has been suggested [5] that a useful parametrization for such deviations is the linear growth index, Î³, defined as\n\nD = (1+ z) exp [ - â«âz (Î©M(z)Î³ - 1) d ln (1 + z) ]\n\nwhere D is the perturbations growth factor at redshift z. If D is measured at a set of redshifts, Î³ can be constrained by fitting the model curves given by eq. (1) to the data. The test is useful because it was found that for a wide range of models in which dark energy is represented by some form of a scalar field, Î³ â 0.55 with high precision [5]. Therefore, if Î³ is found to significantly deviate from 0.55, this potentially would imply that gravity does not follow GR on the cluster scales. Unfortunately, implementations of this method using cluster data necessarily ignore potential effects of non-GR gravity on the non-linear collapse and relations between the cluster mass and observables. However, Î³ derived from the cluster data still provides a useful null test. The best published results from the X-ray cluster mass function constrain the growth index to be Î³ =0.44Â±0.16 [38]; no other cosmological test currently provides useful constraints on Î³.\n\nAs of this writing, the only self-consistent test of a non-GR theory with the cluster data is presented by Schmidt et al. [39]. They consider a specific variant of a so-called f(R) models, in which two terms are added to the GR Lagrangian, one corresponding to Einstein's cosmological constant and another to a genuine modification of GR,\n\n16 Ï Lg = R + f(R) = R - 16ÏGÏÎ- fRR02/R\n\nis the average present-day curvature in the Universe, and f(R) characterizes the fractional (with respect to R) modification of the Lagrangian density of the gravitational field. Schmidt et al. showed that a combination of the 400d survey cluster data with other cosmological datasets constrains the non-GR term to be f(R) < 10-3.\n\nConclusions\n\nX-ray observations of massive galaxy clusters with Chandra and XMM-Newton have afforded robust implementations of the geometric and growth of structure cosmological tests. Cluster data independently confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe, show that the empirical properties of dark energy are very close to those of the cosmological constant, and start to provide interesting constraints on possible deviations of gravity from General Relativity on large scales.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Riess, A.

The Observatory is now in its 12th year of successful operation, and the call for the 13th Cycle of proposals has been issued. Considering the implications of the most recent Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics, we realize just how much the community needs the high-resolution of Chandra to accomplish its science. Moreover, the Observatory continues to operate with only minor incremental changes in performance, due primarily to slow degradation of the thermal insulation and to the gradual accumulation of molecular contamination on the ACIS filter. The former mainly impacts observing strategies and efficiencies so that we may operate the Observatory in a safe thermal environment. The latter has an impact for the detection of the softest x-rays with ACIS.\n\nA major Project activity of the past year was to undergo the biennial NASA Senior Review of Operating Missions. As the largest program under review, the Chandra mission was under a lot of scrutiny. Thanks to the efforts of many dedicated people, to excellent presentations (by Harvey Tananbaum, Belinda Wilkes and Roger Brissenden), and to the science that the Observatory fosters, the Project came out with the (just next to) highest marks. The Senior Review even recommended some relief in projected spending cuts.\n\nWe have sponsored Chandra-focused symposia every two years for many years. This year we are doing something slightly different: We are sponsoring a âMeeting in a Meetingâ (MiM) at the 218th AAS Meeting, in Boston, 2011 May. The Chandra MiM, â12 Years of Science with Chandraâ, will comprise poster sessions and six 90-min sessions of invited talks. We encourage you to contribute a poster (see http://cxc.harvard.edu/symposium_2011/) and to attend the invited talks.\n\nThe oral sessions are:\n\nSession 1 (05/23/2011, 10am-11:30am)\n\nTitle: What Chandra tells us about Solar System Objects\n\n15-minute talk 1: Martin.

Weisskopf (NASA/MSFC).\n\nCXC Project Manager's Report for 2010\n\nRoger Brissenden\n\nChandra marked over eleven years of successful mission operations with continued excellent operational and scientific performance. Telescope time remained in high demand, with significant oversubscription in the Cycle 12 peer review held in June. In the Fall the observing program transitioned from Cycle 11 to Cycle 12. We released the Call for Proposals for Cycle 13 in December, and look forward to the Cycle 13 peer review in June 2011.\n\nThe team worked hard to prepare for NASAâs Senior Review of operating missions, held in April. Chandra ranked second of the eleven missions reviewed, with a score of 9.5 out of 10. In its report, the review committee observed, âAfter a decade in operation, Chandra remains an immensely powerful observatory in its prime, and it is well managed....Chandra has subarcsecond spatial resolution with spatially resolved spectra on the same scale. These attributes do not exist in any other mission and will not be seen again for several decades.â\n\nThe CXC conducted a workshop in February for users of the CIAO data analysis software package, a workshop in July on accretion processes, and a workshop in August on astrostatistics, as well as meetings of the Chandra Usersâ Committee in April and October.\n\nThe CXC mission planning staff continued to maximize observing efficiency in spite of temperature constraints on spacecraft pointing. Competing thermal constraints continue to require some longer observations to be split into multiple short duration segments, to allow the spacecraft to cool at preferred attitudes. The total time available for observing has been increasing gradually over the past few years as Chandraâs orbit evolves and the spacecraft spends less time in Earthâs radiation belts. The overall observing efficiency during 2010 was 74%, compared with 71% in 2009. In the next several years we expect potential observing time to increase slightly, but actual observing to be limited by radiation due to increasing solar activity.\n\nOperational highlights over the past year included seven requests to observe targets of opportunity that required the mission planning and flight teams to interrupt and revise the on-board command loads. The sun was quiet during the year, causing no observing interruptions due to solar activity. Chandra passed through the 2010 summer and winter eclipse seasons, as well as a brief lunar eclipse in February, with nominal power and thermal performance. The mission continued without a significant anomaly and with no safe mode transitions. In May the spacecraft transitioned to normal sun mode due, it is believed, to a single-event upset in an electronic circuit. The operations teams returned the spacecraft to normal status within two days with no adverse consequences and a loss of less than 40 hours of observing time.\n\nBoth focal plane instruments, the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer and the High Resolution Camera, have continued to operate well and have had no significant problems. ACIS, along with the overall spacecraft, has continued to warm gradually.\n\nAll systems at the Chandra Operations Control Center continued to perform well in supporting flight operations.\n\nChandra data processing and distribution to observers continued smoothly, with the average time from observation to delivery of data averaging roughly 30 hours. The Chandra archive holdings grew by 1 TB to 8.3 TB and now contain 30.9 million files. 0.44 TB of the increase represents Chandra Source Catalog data products.\n\nThe Data System team released software updates to support the submission deadline for Cycle 12 observations proposals (March 2010), the Cycle 12 Peer Review (June) and the Cycle 13 Call for Proposals (December). In addition, several enhancements to instrument algorithms have been incorporated into standard data processing and also released in CIAO 4.3 (December). Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) version 1.1 was released over the summer, with the addition of the HRC imaging observations. Virtually all publicly available ACIS & HRC data for compact sources have been processed, representing on the order of 110,000 sources in the Catalog.\n\nEducation and Public Outreach (EPO) group highlights during 2010 include 11 science press releases, three press release postings, two programmatic releases, two award announcements, and 21 image releases. The group released 16 â60 secondâ High Definition podcasts and four longer features. The feature video âExtraordinary Universeâ received the Communicator âAward of Distinctionâ and is a Webby Awards âHonoree.â The Mani Bhaumik award of the International Year of Astronomy (IYA) Cornerstone Project, âFrom Earth to the Universeâ (FETTU), was presented to the Chandra EPO Principal Investigators, Kim Arcand and Megan Watzke, for the best IYA project, and the PIs were invited to give the keynote address at the IAU Communicating Astronomy Conference. Two new blog series were initiated on the CXCâs public web site, a career-focused blog, âWomen in the High Energy Universe,â and a blog tracking the impact of the solar cycle on Chandra operations. Thirty-two workshops were presented at National Science Teacher Association regional and national conferences, National Science Olympiad coachesâ clinics, American Association of Physics Teachers conferences, and other state and NASA meetings.\n\nWe look forward to a new year of continued smooth operations and exciting science results. Please join us to celebrate twelve years of Chandra discoveries at special sessions of the American Astronomical Society meeting to be held in Boston in May, 2011.\n\nInstruments: ACIS\n\nPaul Plucinsky, Royce Buehler, Nancy Adams-Wolk, & Gregg Germain\n\nThe ACIS instrument continued to perform well over the past year with no anomalies or unexpected degradations. The charge-transfer inefficiency (CTI) of the FI and BI CCDs is increasing at the expected rate. The CTI correction implemented in CIAO now includes a temperature-dependent component for Timed Exposure (TE) mode data and the CTI correction has been expanded to work with TE Graded mode data. See the calibration pages (http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Acis/detailed_info.html) and the CIAO 4.3 release notes for more details (http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/releasenotes/ciao_4.3_release.html). The contamination layer continues to accumulate on the ACIS optical-blocking filter. The CXC calibration group has recently released an update to the contamination model for the ACIS-I array, see the CALDB 4.4.1 release notes page for details (http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/caldb/downloads/Release_notes/CALDB_v4.4.1.html).\n\nThe control of the ACIS focal plane (FP) temperature continues to be a major focus of the ACIS Operations Team. As the Chandra thermal environment continues to evolve over the mission, some of the components in the Science Instrument Module (SIM) close to ACIS have been reaching higher temperatures, making it more difficult to maintain the desired operating temperature of -119.7 C at the focal plane. In previous years, a heater on the ACIS Detector Housing (DH) and a heater on the SIM were turned off to provide more margin for the ACIS FP temperature. At this point in the mission, there are two effects that produce excursions in the FP temperature, both related to the attitude of the satellite. First the Earth can be in the FOV of the ACIS radiator (which provides cooling for the FP and DH). Second, for pitch angles larger than 130 degrees, the Sun illuminates the shade for the ACIS radiator and the rear surfaces of the SIM surrounding the ACIS DH. The ACIS Ops team is working with the Chandra Flight Operations Team (FOT) to develop a model that will predict the FP temperature for a week of observations given the orientation of the satellite for each observation. Reducing the number of operational CCDs reduces the power dissipation in the FP, thereby resulting in a lower FP temperature.\n\nStarting in Cycle 13, GOs are requested to select 5 or fewer CCDs if their science objectives can be met with 5 CCDs. GOs may still request 6 CCDs if their science objectives require 6 CCDs, but they should be aware that doing so increases the likelihood of a warm FP temperature and/or may increase the complexity of scheduling the observation. GOs should review the updated material in the Proposersâ Guide on selecting CCDs for their observations. An important point to note is that specifying âYâ for a CCD means that the CCD must be on for that observation, âNâ means that the CCD must be off for that observation, and âOPT#â means that the CCD may be on for that observation if thermal conditions allow. In order to ensure that no more than 5 CCDs are used for an observation, the GO must set 5 CCDs to âNâ and 5 CCDs to either âYâ or âOPT#â.\n\nThe control of the ACIS electronics temperatures has also been a concern for the ACIS Operations Team. ACIS has three main electronics boxes, the Power Supply and Mechanisms Controller (PSMC), the Digital Processing Assembly (DPA), and the Detector Electronics Assembly (DEA). The PSMC reaches its highest temperatures when the satellite is in a âforward Sunâ configuration, pitch angles between 45-60 degrees (Chandra cannot point within 45 degrees of the Sun). Since 2006, the Chandra FOT has been using the optional CCDs information provided by GOs to turn off optional CCDs if thermal conditions require. As a result of the changing thermal environment, the DEA and DPA are reaching higher temperatures in tail-Sun orientations (pitch angles larger than 130 degrees). The recommendation in the previous paragraph to use only 5 CCDs if the science objectives can be met with 5 CCDs, will also reduce the temperature of the DEA and DPA in addition to the temperature of the FP. If current temperature trends continue into the future, the CXC may have to extend the turning off of optional CCDs to tail-Sun attitudes in addition to forward-Sun attitudes. GOs should always specify optional CCDs if possible to provide the maximum scheduling flexibility.\n\nInstruments: HRC\n\nRalph Kraft, Mikhail Revnivstev, Mike Juda\n\nIt has been another quiet, productive year for the HRC. HRC flight operations continue smoothly with no significant anomalies or interruptions. The instrument gain continues to slowly decline with increasing charge extraction, but entirely within pre-flight expectations. We are still many years away from having to increase the operating voltage to offset the gain loss. Regular monitoring observations of Vega show no degradation in either the UVIS or the MCP photocathode. The transition of the HRC laboratory to the new space in Cambridge Discovery Park has been completed. The HRC POC is now operational again and ready to support any spacecraft/instrument anomalies.\n\nA novel operating mode was tested and successfully implemented in a GO observation of the Crab Nebula over the past year. This operational mode will be useful to anyone trying to use the HRC at its highest time resolution on bright sources that saturate the telemetry. This mode does not make use of the shutter. High time resolution observations are not possible with the HRC in its default configuration if the telemetry rate (188 cts s-1) is exceeded because the timestamp on individual events is incorrect. In this observation of the Crab Nebula (with LETG inserted to act as a filter), the trigger level threshold was adjusted so that the observed rate from the source was less than the telemetered rate. This effectively eliminates the lowest pulse height events from triggering the readout electronics - the higher the threshold limit the higher the pulse height required to trigger. Figure 8 contains a plot of both the total and telemetered rates as a function of trigger setting. For a trigger setting above ~ 48, both the total and telemetered rates drop below the telemetry limit, thus allowing timing observations at the full resolution (~ 16 Î¼s). This mode can now be used by any GO, if desired, to observe the small number of sources that exceed the Chandra/HRC telemetry limit and preserve the highest temporal resolution.\n\nThe HRC-I and HRC-S were used for a number of scientific investigations during the past year. We describe a study using the HRC-I to identify counterparts to Galactic low mass X-ray binaries (PI: Mikhail Revnivtsev).\n\nApart from being hosts for exotic objects like black holes and neutron stars, low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) attract a lot of attention as compact binary systems. Indeed, understanding of their secular evolution can give us insights about the rate of events extremely important in astrophysics, like: 1) SN Ia, standard cosmology candles; 2) mergers of compact objects (like white dwarf-white dwarf, neutron star-neutron star), which are crucial for our understanding of gravitational wave signals and construction of future gravitational wave detectors.\n\nOrbital periods of LMXBs evolve very slowly, making it challenging to observe their change. However, it is clear that secular evolution of long lived LMXBs directly influences overall statistical properties of their population such as their distribution over orbital periods or X-ray luminosities. Therefore, by measuring statistical properties of galactic LMXBs, one can make important conclusions about mechanisms of their long-term evolution. The ultimate sample for this purpose is the set of persistent sources, because one can reliably estimate time averaged mass transfer rate from their instantaneous X-ray luminosity, which is impossible in case of transient objects.\n\nIn order to link the properties of binary systems with their statistical distributions, we need to measure main parameters of LMXBs, such as orbital periods, type of donor star, and others. These detailed studies are only possible for systems within our Galaxy. But even for them it has not yet been completed in a systematic manner, while considerable efforts were invested in such projects. The chance to measure LMXB orbital parameters strongly increases if the binary system harbors a giant companion because such systems are brighter in optical/IR spectral bands and they are easier to identify.\n\nAt the moment the main problem in obtaining a large complete sample of optical/IR counterparts of Galactic LMXBs is that the astrometric position of the majority of them is not known with appropriate accuracy. This is especially true for sources only recently discovered via surveys, such as the survey of the INTEGRAL observatory. A set of CHANDRA/HRC observations was requested to obtain the best possible astrometric position of X-ray sources. One of the optical fields with the HRC identified counterpart is shown in Figure 9. As a result of these observations we were able to identify IR counterparts of some of the observed sources. The remaining sources were recently covered with VVV infrared survey (VISTA Variables in The Via Lactea) and results of their identification will be published soon.\n\nReferences\n\nZolotukhin I., 2009, ATel, 2032, â Possible optical counterpart of IGR J17254-3257ââ Zolotukhin I.Y., Revnivtsev M.

Activities in the past year have enhanced the calibration for the continuous-clocking (CC) modes with the HETG; the results are summarized in the POG, section 6.20.4, âChoosing CC-Mode for Bright Source Observation.â\n\nHETG Technique: He-like Triplets\n\nThe HETG and the XMM-Newton RGS were the stars of a high-resolution spectroscopy conference at Utrecht last year; talks and posters are online and the proceedings will be coming out soon (Kaastra & Paerels, ed.s, 2011). One of the review articles gives a thorough presentation of âHe-like ions as practical astrophysical plasma diagnostics: From stellar coronae to active galactic nucleiâ (Porquet, Dubau, and Grosso 2011). Our view of He-like triplets in extra-solar objects has been revolutionized by the Chandra and XMM-Newton grating instruments, though we did have a glimpse of the triplets in the days of the Einstein observatory. The focal plane crystal spectrometer (FPCS, Canizares et al. 1979) resolved Oxygen and Neon He-like triplets in some astrophysical sources, for example the Puppis A supernova, Figure 10. The complete FPCS observations and results are given in a paper by Lum et al. (1992). Since current grating spectrometer resolution is degraded for very extended sources, these data are still our highest-resolution spectrum of Puppis A!\n\nThe relative intensities of the three lines in a triplet can be described by two parameters, typically expressed by the âRâ and âGâ ratios reviewed in Porquet, Dubau, and Grosso 2011. Figure 11 shows examples of the HETG-observed He-like triplets of Si, Mg, Ne, and O and the corresponding parameter confidence contours in R-G space. In addition to temperature and density, the UV radiation field can also affect the triplet ratios; Mitschang et al. (2010) use this to conclude that these lines originate well within a stellar diameter of the O-star's surface.\n\nHETG Science: Absorbing Complexities\n\nThe continuum emission from accretion-powered sources is generated near the compact object and has to make its way out of the system for us to see it. Absorption along this path, often from ionized or 'warm' material, can be seen in the spectra and used to constrain the system geometry and properties. A recent paper by Andrade-VelÃ¡zquez et al. (2010) includes a re-analysis of 236 ks of HETG data on the Seyfert 1 galaxy, NGC 5548, located at z ~ 0.017 (~ 70 Mpc). Because of the low foreground NH of ~ 1.6e20/cm2, the observation provides reasonable flux even at longer wavelengths (Figure 12). Their paper demonstrates that the time-averaged warm absorber features can be fit with a combination of two outflows of distinct velocities (-490 and -1110 km/s), with each outflow composed of two ionization phases. This modeling is in good agreement with velocities and densities seen in UV spectra and may constrain the wind geometry of the system.\n\nA multi-observatory campaign was carried out on the black hole candidate Cygnus X-1, producing spectra over the 0.8 to 300 keV range (Nowak et al. 2011). The Chandra HETG joined RXTE and Suzaku for one epoch of observing and proved very useful by showing the spectral complexity of the absorption which the other instruments are unable to resolve. As an example, the 30 ks HETG observation was divided into 4 based on the 'dipping' state of the source and shows that the ionization state changes with the degree of dipping, Figure 13.\n\nNot all absorption features are so pronounced as in the previous examples. In Figure 14 an absorption feature is seen between the K-alpha and K-beta fluorescence lines in a neutron star (NS) binary, 1A 0535+262. These data were taken with Director Time during a 2009 âType IIâ outburst. The model does require that Fe be over-abundant and suggests an outflow velocity of ~ 3000 km/s (Reynolds and Miller 2010); these high velocity winds may be unique to neutron star binary systems. In the near term, the three most important tools to make further progress in this area are: data, data, and data.\n\nReferences\n\nAndrade-VelÃ¡zquez, M., et al. (2010) ApJ 711, 888.

Popularized by the spewing chimneys of the industrial revolution and explained by Fred Hoyle's 12C resonance that facilitates Bethe's triple-alpha process in stellar nucleosynthesis. They make everything with it now: aeroplanes, racing cars, bicycles, tennis rackets, musical instruments, footprints, everything. They even use it to make optical blocking filters for X-ray satellites. But despite its moderately important role as the basis of life as we know it, carbon still has a bit of an image problem. This is perhaps partly due to it being the prime constituent of blights like soot, gunk, grime and crud, which X-ray instrument builders refer to euphemistically as âcontaminationâ. It doesn't help that carbon also proves to be rather messy under the X-ray microscope of high-resolution spectroscopy.\n\nLike all heavy elements, the X-ray transmittance of carbon near its ionization threshold, between about 40 and 45 Ã (0.3 â 0.28 keV), shows complex X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). This would be all well and good â we could use this structure as a spectroscopic tool to study carbon in the cosmos, as has been done for elements such as O, Ne and Fe (Juett et al. 2004, 2006) â were it not for our carbon filter-clad instruments showing the same structure. Itâs not quite the same structure though, and this makes it all the more messy.\n\nThe optical and UV blocking filters on the Chandra detectors are made from aluminium-coated polyimide. The polyimide (C22H10N2O5) substrate in these metal-polymer foils provides the flexural and tensile strength needed for the filter to survive the rigors of launch, while the carbon also helps attenuate UV and optical light. The energies of inner-shell states in carbon whose valence electrons are bound up in a polymer such as this are perturbed relative to those in isolated carbon atoms. The detailed structure and energies of absorption resonances of a given element then depend on its ionization and chemical state. Accurate calculation of this photoabsorption cross-section for complex materials such as polyimide is currently not readily tractable and consequently the ACIS and HRC filter transmittances as a function of wavelength used to construct the Chandra effective areas are based on measurements obtained in the laboratory and at synchrotron facilities. These calibration measurements do a pretty good job of matching most of the resonance features seen near the carbon edge in LETG observations. Pretty good, because for many sources the filter signature dominates, but we would not expect a perfect match because of carbon absorption in the source, and in the intervening interstellar medium.\n\nWhile detailed photoabsorption cross-sections complete with resonance structure cannot yet be readily computed for complicated chemical compounds, they can be computed for single atoms and ions. Indeed, the use of K-edge resonance structure for studying elements like O and Ne in the ISM was made possible by such computations (Garcia et al. 2005; Gorczyca 2000). Similar calculations for carbon should, at least in principle, enable the same sort of studies for C to be made. Moreover, an accurate cross-section for the cosmic absorbers should provide a check on the propriety of the instrument absorption features and calibration in the vicinity of the edge.\n\nSuch calculations were taken on by Tom Gorczyca and his graduate student, Fatih Hasoglu, at Western Michigan University (Hasoglu et al. 2010). An example of how the resulting cross-sections look is illustrated for C II in Figure 15; similar calculations were performed for C I, III and IV ions. Also shown in Figure 15 is the cross-section computed using an independent particle approach â essentially a mean-field approximation in which the detailed interactions of the 1s electron under consideration with other electrons in the ion are not taken into account. These more simplified cross-sections are characterized by ionization edges that are essentially a step-function at the ionization threshold, and are similar to those included in ISM X-ray absorption models in common use. The resolving power of the LETGS at these energies is about 1000 (0.3 eV or so) and it might be appreciated by the comparison that the resonance structure will have an impact on observations for sources in which the cosmic absorption optical depth becomes comparable to that of the filter.\n\nWe turned to our trusty blazar calibration source, Mkn 421, to test an ISM absorption model using the new high-resolution C cross-sections. This source was caught in a very high state during an LETG+HRC-S observation on 2003 July 1 and 2 (ObsID 4149; see Nicastro et al. 2005 for a full description). An absorbed power-law continuum model has never produced a really good fit to this spectrum in the vicinity of the main C resonances. Trying a fit with an ISM absorption model that included the new high-resolution C cross-sections was instead quite revealing. The fit used a power-law continuum with photon index Î = 2 and ISM absorption corresponding to cosmic metal abundances and neutral hydrogen column density of NH = 1.5 Ã 1020 cm-2 â slightly different to the parameters adopted by Nicastro et al. (2005), but here we optimized the fit to the C edge region. Immediately apparent was a precise coincidence between the C II 1s2s22p2 (2P, 2D ) resonances and a discrepancy in the same fit performed using the step function edge employed in the Balucinska-Church & McCammon (1992) absorption model. The redshift of the C II absorber is zero, indicating that it resides along the line-of-sight in our Galaxy. The new C model could not help a 5% â 15% under-prediction of the data in the 42 â 44 Ã range though, but since this was just an informal test and most Newsletter readers will never read this far into the article, we just cheated a bit and added a broad Gaussian-like correction to the effective area to fix it. The fraction of the ISM carbon to atribute to the different C charge states could then be computed using rigorous statistical methods. It could be, but I just did it by eye and got 20% C I, 60% C II, and for good measure, 20% C III. This fit is illustrated in Figure 16, together with one using the Balucinska-Church & McCammon (1992) step function absorption model. The new high resolution photoabsorption cross-section data for carbon are available from Tom Gorczyca on request.*\n\nSo, the improvement in the fit is perhaps not so dramatic? Keep in mind that the ISM column toward Mkn 421 is very low compared with most Galactic lines of sight that will exhibit much stronger ISM features. We still need to look in more detail at the broad Gaussian cheat in the 42 â 44 Ã region to determine if it really does warrant inclusion in the instrument calibration, or if it might be explained by other means. Any calibration updates for the region close to the C edge will likely be included later in the year, together with planned revisions to the HRC-S quantum efficiency at Î» > 44 Ã . There is also a weak absorption feature near 42.2 Ã in the observed spectrum suggestively close to the predicted C III 1s2s22p (1P ) resonance that bears further study; absence of a stronger feature tells us that at most only about 20% of the carbon in the line-of-sight is in the form of C2+: Galactic interstellar crud is not highly-charged.\n\nReferences\n\nBalucinska-Church, M., & McCammon, D. 1992, ApJ, 400, 699 Garcia, J., Mendoza, C., Bautista, M.

David\n\nThere were four updates to the Chandra calibration data base (CALDB) released during 2010. These releases contained the standard quarterly calibration of the ACIS gain and the yearly calibration of the HRC gain. Since the ACIS charge particle background varies during the solar cycle, a new set of blank field ACIS background images was released during the past year to assist observers in the analysis of extended sources. These background images were compiled from ACIS observations taken from late 2005 through 2009 (Epoch E). In addition, a blank field HRC-I background image and a HRC-I PI background spectrum were released during 2010. A recent LETG observation of the Crab nebula revealed some remaining cross-calibration issues between the transmission efficiency of the higher orders relative to the first order. The photon statistics in the Crab data were sufficient to allowed a re-calibration of the higher order transmission efficiencies, up to seventh order. Further updates to the ACIS-I molecular contamination model and a slight revision to the HRC-I QE, to improve cross-calibration with the other focal plane detectors, were also released to the public in 2010.\n\nWith CIAO 4.3 and CALDB 4.4.1 (released on Dec. 15, 2010), ACIS data telemetered in graded mode is now corrected for the effects of charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) by default. With the current versions the CALDB and CIAO, all timed event (TE) mode data, taken in either Faint (F), Very Faint (VF) or Graded (G) telemetry format is corrected for the effects of CTI by default. The calibration team is presently working on methods of applying CTI-corrections to continuous clocking (CC) mode data. Users can also apply temperature-dependent gain corrections to ACIS data with the latest versions of the CALDB and CIAO. A discussion of what data should be re-processed with the new temperature-dependent gain correction software is given at http://cxc.harvard.edu/contrib/tcticorr.\n\nThe Chandra calibration team continues to support the efforts of the International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC). The CXC helped organize the 5th annual IACHEC meeting which took place in April, 2010 in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. These meetings bring together calibration scientists from all present and most future X-ray and Î³-ray missions. Collaborations among the calibration scientists have produced two papers that describe the present cross-calibration status between Chandra, XMM-Newton and Suzaku using clusters of galaxies (Nevalainen, David & Guainazzi 2010, A&A, 423, 22.) and the supernova remnant G21.5-09 (Tsujimoto et al. 2011, A&A, 525, 25.)\n\nCIAO 4.3: pushing the Chandra spatial resolution to its limit\n\nAntonella Fruscione, for the CIAO team\n\nVersion 4.3 of the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observation (CIAO) and CALDB 4.4.1, the newest versions of the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations software and the Chandra Calibration Database were released in December 2010.\n\nCIAO 4.3 includes several enhancements and bug fixes with respect to previous CIAO versions. One of the most important facilitates significant improvement to the already unprecedented spatial resolution of Chandra X-ray imaging with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) through subpixel event repositioning techniques.\n\nAs outlined in the CIAO âWhy topicâ âACIS Sub-Pixel Event Repositioning (http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/why/acissubpix.html), for sources near the optical axis of the telescope, the size of the point spread function is smaller than the size of the ACIS pixels (< 0.49 arcsec). Li et al. (2003, 2004) describe various subpixel event repositioning algorithms that can be used to improve the image quality of ACIS data for such sources. Their algorithm âEDSERâ (Energy-Dependent Subpixel Event Repositioning) can be applied to all Chandra observing modes - except for CC mode - and to data on both front-illuminated and back-illuminated CCDs. As of CIAO 4.3 this algorithm has been incorporated into the tool acis_process_events. It is therefore possible to reprocess older data to apply a subpixel algorithm. As of version DS 8.4 of the Standard Data Processing (SDP) code in the pipeline (planned for the spring of 2011), the default processing will also apply this subpixel algorithm. Note that most users will not notice a difference in the data with the âEDSERâ subpixel resolution applied. The exception is users working with high-resolution (< 1 arcsec) data on-axis. Figures 17 and 18 show examples of optimized image resolution by subpixel repositioning of individual X-ray events.\n\nOn the âinstrument responseâ front, a substantial and important improvement has been added in CIAO 4.3 regarding ARFs (Ancillary Response Functions). Via the tool arfcorr it is now possible to correct an ARF for the finite extraction region, while sky2det is an improved weighting algorithm to account for spatial variations in the ARF. arfcorr calculates the approximate fraction of the point spread function (PSF) enclosed by a region, which the tool then applies in an energy-dependent correction to the ARF file. sky2det creates a weighted map (WMAP) used by mkwarf: it properly weights the ARF based on how much of the source flux fell onto the bad pixels, columns, or a node boundary and which bad pixels are actually exposed. Without accounting for these effects, the ARF is significantly over-estimated.\n\nA substantial effort has been invested during the past year in the CIAO contributed scripts package. This contains analysis scripts and modules written by scientists and IT specialists at the CXC to automate repetitive tasks and extend the functionality of the CIAO software package. The CIAO Scripts Package is installed seamlessly within the CIAO structure and is considered a required part of the installation; however new scripts or updates are released more often than CIAO, generally once a month.\n\nRecent notable additions include:\n\nchandra_repro: a reprocessing script which automates the recommended data processing steps presented in the CIAO analysis threads and may be used to reprocess ACIS and HRC imaging data.\n\ncombine_spectra: a script which sums multiple imaging source PHA spectra, and optionally, associated background PHA spectra and source and background ARF and RMF instrument responses; the script utilizes the new tool addresp which adds multiple RMFs, weighted by ARFs and exposures and adds multiple ARFs, weighted by exposures.\n\nspecextract: an improved python-version of the old tool by the same name, which now lets the user create source and background PHA or PI spectra and their associated unweighted or weighted ARF and RMF files for point and extended sources .\n\nmake_psf_asymmetry_region: a script which creates a region file indicating the location of the PSF asymmetry found in HRC and ACIS data as described in âProbing higher resolution: an asymmetry in the Chandra PSFâ (http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/caveats/psf_artifact.html).\n\nForthcoming (in spring 2011) is a complete rewrite and improvement of the merge_all script to combine any number of observations and create corresponding exposure maps and exposure-corrected images.\n\nOther notable CIAO 4.3 changes and improvements are within Sherpa, the modeling and fitting package, which now supports model expressions with different types of instruments and combinations of convolved and non-convolved model components, and caching of model parameters. It also has improved support for multi-core processing, new iterative fitting methods and many new high level user interface functions (see also the article by Siemiginowska et al. in this newsletter). The ChIPS plotting application includes support for creating axes with WCS meta data associated with them (Figure 19 ). There are new commands for panning and zooming in plots, as well as improved image support and many enhancements and bug fixes. Finally the Data Model supports tab separated values (TSV) format ASCII files, including the extended header detail provided by the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) output format.\n\nUsers interested in hands-on CIAO training should plan to attend the next CIAO workshop which will be held in Cambridge, MA, USA on 6 August 2011 immediately following the X-Ray Astronomy School. More information will be posted at http://cxc.harvard.edu/xrayschool/ and http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/workshop/.\n\nMore information and updates on CIAO can always be found at: http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with CIAO news and developments subscribe to chandra-users@head.cfa.harvard.edu (send e-mail to âmajordomo@head.cfa.harvard.eduâ, and put âsubscribe chandra-usersâ (without quotation marks) in the body of the message).\n\nA few important notes for CIAO users:\n\n1. Switching to Python\n\nAs of CIAO 4.3 only the Python interface is supported in CIAO. Old and new users of CIAO should learn the Python syntax for ChIPS and Sherpa. However the CXC is committed to helping existing S-Lang users transition to Python; contact Helpdesk if you need assistance.\n\n2. SherpaCL\n\nThe sherpacl application has not been updated to work in CIAO 4.3. Please contact the Helpdesk if you would like to use SherpaCL in CIAO 4.3.\n\n3. CIAO 3.4 and CALDB3.x\n\nThe CXC no longer supports CIAO 3.4 however the CIAO3.4 webpages will stay on-line for the foreseeable future. Similarly there will be no more updates for version 3.x of the CALDB: CALDB3.5.5 is the last CALDB updated for CIAO3.4. All the latest calibration updates are not included in CALDB 3.x. We encourage users to migrate to CIAO 4.3 and CALDB 4.4.1. We also note that CALDB 4.x is not compatible with CIAO3.4.\n\nReferences\n\nKastner J.H., Li J., Vrtilek S.D., Gatley I., Merrill K.

Sherpa is a modern modelling and fitting Python application in CIAO, can also be run as a standalone package in a Python shell. Sherpa contains a powerful language for combining simple models into complex expressions that can be fit to the data using a variety of statistics and optimization methods. Sherpa is also easily extensible to include user models, statistics and optimization methods and methods provided by the user.\n\nCIAO users can start Sherpa by simply typing âsherpaâ on the command line within the CIAO environment. This gives access to all the Sherpa high-level user functions and also provides access to the most of the internal data and variables. Other Python packages (for example, scipy) can be imported to a Sherpa session just as in any other Python applications.\n\nTo access Sherpa from a Python shell independently of CIAO, one needs to âimport sherpaâ. This option is convenient for non-X-ray astronomers who would normally not work in CIAO.\n\nThe following two web pages provide more information about Sherpa for CIAO and Python users:\n\nSherpa Modeling and Fitting in CIAO:\n\nhttp://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/\n\nSherpa Modeling and Fitting in Python:\n\nhttp://cxc.harvard.edu/contrib/sherpa/\n\nPython in Astronomy\n\nProgramming languages and programing styles evolve. Like scientific ideas, they become more and less fashionable. Only a few of the compiled languages (e.g., Fortran, C) have lasted for decades. Python is a âscriptingâ (not-compiled) language that has become more and more popular in the astronomy community. There are many packages for data analysis being developed in Python, e.g. PyRAF, Fermi software, CASA. Also there are many new web pages presenting Python software to astronomers (for example astropython http://www.astropython.org/ or astrobetter) and conferences devoted to scientific analysis performed in Python.\n\nPython turns out to be an easy language to use for scientists. It is very useful in every day scientific programing. It is also relatively easy to incorporate a code written in C (or Fortran) into Python. Python's scientific libraries contain many useful functions and tools. Over the last few years Python has matured and become stable, yet it is still an active language with plenty of community support. Unlike IDL, scientific Python software is free. In addition, Linux and Mac users get a version of Python as a standard part of their operating system installation.\n\nSherpa development in Python started a few years ago when the language was not as popular as today. Large parts of the Sherpa code have been kept as C, but the main user interface has been developed in Python. The first Python version of Sherpa was released in December 2009. The second update was available last summer and a fully updated new version was released last December (2010).\n\nSherpa Capabilities\n\nSherpa allows users to:\n\nFit 1D (multiple) data including: spectra, surface brightness profiles, light curves, general ASCII arrays\n\nFit 2D images/surfaces in the Poisson and Gaussian regimes\n\nBuild complex model expressions\n\nImport user-defined models\n\nUse appropriate statistics for modelling Poisson or Gaussian data\n\nImport user-defined statistic functions, with priors if required by analysis\n\nVisualize a model parameter space with simulations and with 1D/2D cuts\n\nCalculate confidence levels on the best fit model parameters\n\nChoose a robust optimization method for the fit: Levenberg-Marquardt, Nelder-Mead Simplex or Monte Carlo/Differential Evolution.\n\nOptimization\n\nThe main scientific goal of Sherpa modelling is finding the model parameters that best describe the observed data.\n\nThe âforward-fittingâ algorithm employed by Sherpa is a standard technique used to model X-ray data. A statistic, usually an assumed weighted Ï2 or Poisson likelihood (e.g. Cash), is minimized in the fitting process to obtain a set of the best model parameters. Astronomical models often have complex forms with many parameters that may be correlated (e.g., an absorbed power-law); minimization is not trivial in such a setting, as the statistical parameter space becomes multimodal, and finding the global minimum is difficult. Therefore there are several optimization algorithms in Sherpa which target a wide range of minimization problems. Two local minimization methods were implemented: (1) levmar - the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was obtained from the MINPACK subroutine LMDIF and modified to achieve the required robustness; and (2) simplex - the Nelder-Mead simplex method was implemented in-house, based on variations of the algorithm described in the literature (Nelder & Mead, 1965, Computer Journal, vol 7, 308-313). A global search Monte-Carlo method - moncar - has been implemented following a differential evolution algorithm presented by Storn and Price (1997) (J. Global Optimization 11, 341-359, 1997; http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html).\n\nIn summary: levmar is fast, very sensitive to initial parameters, and performs well for simple models, e.g. power-law or single-temperature models, but may fail to converge with complex models. neldermead-simplex and moncar are both very robust and converge to the global minimum in complex model cases. neldermead-simplex is more efficient than moncar, but moncar probes a larger part of the parameter space. moncar or neldermead should be used when fitting complex models with correlated parameters.\n\nUser Models and Contributed Sherpa Packages\n\nSherpa's Python implementation makes user contributions easy. Users can develop their specific models, functions or pipelines in Python and import them to Sherpa.\n\nThere are a few contributed packages on the Sherpa web page already. The deproject package developed by Tom Aldcroft is a CIAO Sherpa extension package to facilitate deprojection of two-dimensional annular X-ray spectra to recover the three-dimensional source properties. For typical thermal models, this would include the radial temperature and density profiles. This basic method has been used extensively for X-ray cluster analysis, and the deproject package brings this functionality to Sherpa as a Python module that is straightforward to use and understand.\n\nTwo other Python packages contributed by Tom Aldcroft are: datastack which improves the user interface in analysis of multiple data sets and cosmocalc which is an implementation of Ned Wright's cosmology calculator.\n\npyblocxs is a result of an on-going collaboration between the Sherpa Team and the astrostatistics group CHASC. It is an MCMC-based algorithm designed to carry out Bayesian spectral fitting of low counts data (Van Dyk et al 2001, ApJ. 548, 224). It explores the parameter space at a suspected minimum using a predefined Sherpa model. It includes a flexible definition of priors and allows for variations in the calibration information. It can be used to compute posterior predictive p-values for the likelihood ratio test (see Protassov et al. 2002, ApJ. 571, 545).\n\nWeb page for the Astrostatistics Group CHASC:\n\nhttp://hea-www.harvard.edu/AstroStat/\n\nWeb page for contributed Python packages:\n\nhttp://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/sherpa/contrib.html\n\nWe also have a âSherpa Blogâ, with postings from developers and other contributors.

This database collects atomic data relevant to modeling the emission from collisionally-ionized thermal plasmas, with a particular focus on ions and processes of interest to X-ray astronomy. The data is stored as FITS files to allow for ease of use in other analysis work. In this update, the data for almost every ion in the database has been replaced, leading to significant changes in emission spectra and line diagnostics. Two versions are available now at http://www.atomdb.org: one that can be used as a drop-in replacement in Sherpa or XSPEC, and another that contains every element with Z=1-36 but requires updates to the fitting codes before it can be used.\n\nOne of the most fundamental changes has been the upgrade to the ionization and recombination rates. The old AtomDB used rates from Mazzotta et al. (1998), which have now been replaced with the more recent compilation of Bryans et al. (2009). This has a noticeable effect on the ionization balance for some important ions, such as Fe XVII, generally shifting them to higher temperatures. This in turn has affected the resulting emissivities for many lines, in particular those of Fe L-shell ions.\n\nRecombination rates are now divided into level-resolved rates, resulting in a modest further change to line emissivities that will nonetheless impact the emission for plasmas in non-equilibrium ionization. For this reason, the ionization and recombination rate files have been included in this release for the first time to allow full non-equilibrium ionization modeling to be performed.\n\nIn addition, the collisional excitation rates for every H- and He-like ion, and for the iron L-shell ions (Fe XVII to Fe XIV) have been upgraded to a new set of R-Matrix calculations. This provides significantly improved effective collision strengths.\n\nAs a result of all of this new data, several outstanding issues raised with the old database have been solved. The figure shows the electron temperature measured using two different line ratios using the old database â in theory, these should agree, however they consistently did not. In AtomDB 2.0, the new He-like data leads to a much better agreement between the two methods.\n\nFuture developments already underway for the next release include the incorporation of the XSTAR photoionization database into AtomDB, and inclusion of new inner-shell excitation data for Li-like ions, which will be significant for non-equilibrium ionization studies. In the meantime, work is ongoing to incorporate all of the new data into analysis tools such as Sherpa, XSPEC and ISIS. As of now, the new data are directly available for public use from the AtomDB website â www.atomdb.org.\n\nNews from the Chandra Data Archive (CDA): NEW Footprint Service\n\nAaron Watry, Arnold Rots\n\nThe CDA started the new year bringing online a new interface: the Chandra Footprint Service. This service provides a visual web interface to all public Chandra observations, as well as to the coverage of the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC); see Figure 24. It superimposes the instrumental coverage of the Chandra instruments on a cut-out image from the Digital Sky Survey, using the look and feel of the footprint service of the Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA).\n\nThe service provides the user with three functional tabs (in addition to Help and FAQ):\n\n1. The main Footprint tab displays the footprint and an accompanying table of all the observations displayed in the footprint. The table is user-configurable, may be filtered, and selections are mirrored in the footprint overlay. In addition, the user can turn instruments on and off and choose between archived data (up to Level 2) and the CSC.\n\n2. The Image Inventory tab provides a list of all the Chandra images that are available from the observations in the table.\n\n3. The Image Preview/Data Download tab allows the user to browse those Chandra images and select observations for download through WebChaSeR.\n\nThe Footprint service is VO-compliant and can provide VOTable output.\n\nThe Footprint Service is located at:\n\nhttp://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/footprint/cdaview.html\n\nTo learn more:\n\nhttp://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/footprint/cdaview_help.html\n\nIn the future we hope to provide options to add CSC positions to the footprints and to include footprints from different missions and archives.\n\nRecent Chandra Dataset Identifiers\n\nSherry Winkelman, for the Archive Operations Team\n\nPublications managed by the AAS provide authors with a mechanism that allows them to follow links in either direction between journal articles and the observational data presented therein. Identifiers are described at: http//cxc.harvard.edu/cda/datasetid.html.\n\nThe Chandra Data Archive (CDA) would like to thank our recent dataset identifier contributors. Your use of dataset identifiers greatly improves our ability to link data to published results. We have two defined sets in the past year:\n\n1. ADS/Sa.CXO#DefSet/CCCP - contains 38 obsids related to the Chandra Carina Complex Project (http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/DefSet/CCCP.html)\n\n2. ADS/Sa.CXO#DefSet/GBS - contains 195 obsids related to the Galactic Bulge Survey\n\n(http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/DefSet/GBS.html)\n\nWe also created contributed sets for both Chandra Deep Fields which are pre-packaged datasets of the Deep Fields. They can be found at:\n\nADS/Sa.CXO#Contrib/2010/CDFN\n\n(http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/Contrib/2010/CDFN)\n\nADS/Sa.CXO#Contrib/2010/CDFS\n\n(http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/Contrib/2010/CDFS)\n\nIn addition, we are now working with the Chandra EPO group to create dataset identifiers for press releases. The first identifier is linked to the M82 press release which was issued at the January AAS and can be found at:\n\nADS/Sa.CXO#DefSet/PR_M82_2011-01-13\n\n(http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/DefSet/PR_M82_2011-01-13.html)\n\nDataset identifiers provide a means of linking articles and the observational data that are presented in them. Such linking provides a powerful data mining tool which the CDA uses to create its bibliography. (For more details see Chandra Newsletter #17.) In addition the ADS, CDA, and other observatories are collaborating to create a richer, semantically linked research environment by sharing information about observations and bibliographic content. Clearly labeling data in papers and using dataset identifiers play a key role in that linking.\n\nThe CDA recognizes five types of datasest identifiers to link to published Chandra results:\n\n1. to individual observations:\n\nADS/Sa.CXO#obs\n\n2. to lists of multiple observations:\n\nADS/Sa.CXO#DefSet\n\n3. to static contributed data products:\n\nADS/Sa.CXO#Contrib/YYYY\n\n4. to dynamic contributed data products:\n\nADS/Sa.CXO#Contrib\n\n5. to the Chandra Source Catalog:\n\nADS/Sa.CXO#CSC\n\nWe encourage authors to use dataset identifiers in their manuscripts as a means of creating direct links to the data used in their publications. You can find details on using and requesting identifiers at the CDA website, http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/datasetid.html.\n\nRetirement of Longtime Newsletter Editor: Dr. Nancy Evans\n\nHarvey Tananbaum (Director), Belinda Wilkes (Assistant Director)\n\nMay 2010 marked the retirement of Chandra Director's Office scientist and longtime Newsletter editor, Dr. Nancy Remage Evans.\n\nNancy masterminded planning, designing and editing this annual, Chandra Newsletter from Issue #4 in Sep. 1996 to #17 in Spring 2010, 14 Issues in all. During this time she also oversaw several updates in format, taking advantage of newly available software to keep the Newsletter current and looking sharp and professional, both electronically and in hardcopy.\n\nNancy set a high standard. She diligently researched and sought out articles on all aspects of the observatory, including recent events affecting the observatory or its users, current science reviews and press releases, upcoming events, relatively routine status reports, and future mission news. The result was a consistently reliable, useful and attractive document which allowed interested readers worldwide to keep in touch with Chandra and its exciting science.\n\nWe thank Nancy for her hard work over so many years and wish her many years of happy retirement. We miss her presence in the CXC, but we enjoy the continued pleasure of her company as she continues her scientific research on Cepheid stars here at the CfA.\n\nReflections from the Outgoing Editor\n\nNancy Remage Evans\n\nAfter more than a decade of editing the Chandra Newsletter (since Issue 4 in 1996, back when it was the AXAF Newsletter), I was asked by Paul Green, the new editor, if I had any thoughts to pass along. After a little reflection, I decided that my thoughts were a list of thanks for the effort from so many people which went into our annual summary.\n\nThanks to:\n\nOf course the major thanks are to the team who put Chandra together and pulled it off. The âTen Years of Chandra Conferenceâ brought a lot of them together (2010, PNAS, 107, 2127; http://cxc.harvard.edu/ChandraDecade/). Take a look at the back page of Issue 17. The launch issue (Issue 7, 2000) celebrated with a splurge of color in the center spread. Times have changedâand we are now all color.\n\nThe hardworking science staff continuously push the science and calibration data to get the most out of it. Sometimes it takes a nudge to get them to write things up, but happily Users' Committee reports could frequently be repurposed for the whole community to use.\n\nThe writers of the âcommissioned cover storiesâ always did a great job.\n\nParticular thanks to Diana Worrall for starting the Newsletter and with it, the first Chandra/AXAF User database. Off to a good start.\n\nA lot of Director's Office support staff helped with the production, with special thanks to Mihoko Yukita and Tara Gokas for moving the production into sophisticated desktop publishingâand into full color.\n\nThe article I have personally used the most was the one by Jiahong Juda on the calibration facility, and I always looked forward to anything by Wallace and Karen Tucker.\n\nAnd, of course, I learned more about copyright than I ever intended. Thanks all.\n\nAnd happy editing, Paul!\n\nChandra: Promises Made and Kept\n\nWallace Tucker\n\nA promise made is a debt unpaid. ~Robert Service\n\nChance favors the prepared mind. ~Louis Pasteur\n\nNot long ago a request came down from above for a list of Chandra's achievements that have completely transformed the way we have viewed our world, solar system, sun, or universe.\n\nIn other words, how many discoveries of the century have you made this year?\n\nIn a bow to David Letterman, or the decimal system, or other lists of ten that you can easily summon up, Chandra Project Scientist Martin Weisskopf submitted a list of Chandraâs top ten which would probably fall beyond the event horizon, never to be seen again. Not really, because it appears below, and being an environmentally conscious group, we will likely recycle the list several times before the next request requires generation of a new list which will be similar, but not identical to previous lists because real progress is being made.\n\nChandra's Top Ten\n\n(As of January 2011, not necessarily in order of importance)\n\n1. Deep field observations resolved the X-ray background and showed that it is dominated by accreting supermassive black holes including a large number of highly obscured black holes.\n\n2. Images of clusters of galaxies established that energetic feedback by rotating supermassive black holes dramatically affects the evolution of intracluster gas and galaxies.\n\n3. X-ray rings and jets around rotating neutron stars provide the most direct evidence of the transformation of rotational energy of these stars into jets and winds of high energy particles.\n\n4. X-ray and optical observations of the Bullet cluster of galaxies show the separation of dark and ordinary matter in a collision between galaxy clusters.\n\n5. Observations of the rate at which massive galaxy clusters grow have provided confirmation that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, an effect attributed to the prevalence of dark energy, and have ruled out some alternatives to General Relativity.\n\n6. Observations of supernova remnants showed that supernova explosions are asymmetric and turbulent, requiring mixing of layers either during or prior to the explosions, and images of supernova shock waves provide evidence for acceleration of electrons to extremely high energies.\n\n7. Detection of absorption by highly ionized oxygen atoms in X-ray spectra of a quasar behind the Sculptor wall of galaxies provided evidence for the Warm Hot Interstellar Medium, thought to contain the missing baryons in the local universe.\n\n8. Chandra observations of spectrally soft X-ray sources in early-type galaxies led to the conclusion that mergers, rather than accretion-driven explosions, are responsible for the Type Ia supernovas in these galaxies.\n\n9. A number of multi wavelength studies of star clusters have provided an unprecedented look at the co-evolution of young stars and their disks in a wide variety of conditions.\n\n10. Chandra was used to discover and/or contribute to an understanding of the X-ray emission processes from comets, the moons of Jupiter, the Io plasma torus, and the atmospheres of Venus and Mars.\n\nThe list, which could have easily been expanded to fifteen or more by including insight into the nature of stellar black holes (event horizon, rotation rate), the accretion process near black holes, the studies of the Galactic center region, starburst galaxies, etc., got me to wondering how well the promise of Chandra has been met, and whether we can possibly guess what the future holds. This led me to my personal archive to dig out copies of old proposals. The oldest was the proposal for a Large Orbiting X-ray Telescope, which was submitted to NASA in May of 1970.\n\nThe LOXT was to have two telescopes, one designed for high resolution with the capabilities approximately that of Chandra, and the other for maximum efficiency with approximately the capabilities of XMM-Newton. What did we expect to be the major accomplishments of LOXT? The following list is in order of appearance in the proposal.\n\nL1. Detect line emission from Sco X-1 as a test to the binary star model for X-ray stars.\n\nL2. Determine the nature of strong, transient X-ray stars.\n\nL3. Resolve the X-ray emission from and around the Crab pulsar & detect and search for other rotation powered X-ray emitting pulsars in supernova remnants.\n\nL4. Study the dynamics of supernova shock waves and measure the abundances of the elements in supernova remnants.\n\nL5. Detect X-rays from supernovas in their first month.\n\nL6. Detect X-rays from stellar coronas, stellar winds and flare stars.\n\nL7. Determine the populations of X-ray sources for different galaxy types & their association with galactic features such as spiral arms.\n\nL8. Resolve the X-ray emission around M87, especially the optical jet.\n\nL9. Detect and study X-ray emission from Seyfert galaxies and QSOâs.\n\nL10. Measure the granularity of the x-ray background.\n\nL11. Look for shadows cast by cool intergalactic matter.\n\nL12. Search for the missing mass in the form of ionized gas in clusters of galaxies.\n\nL13. Set limits on the mass density of the intergalactic medium through observations of the soft X-ray background.\n\nGiven that this proposal was submitted before the launch of UHURU, when the total useful time from all the rocket flights was about 300 ksec, and the evidence for black holes, or the binary nature of compact X-ray sources, or the existence of the hot intracluster medium was still in the future, the overlap between this list and the latest Chandra list is remarkable. It is also noteworthy that Chandra has made significant advances on every one of the topics.\n\nLOXT never made it through the budget gauntlet, but, largely because of the success of UHURU, the Einstein X-ray Observatory, a smaller version of the LOXT did survive, and the X-ray images made with its mirrors made the case for the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), or Chandra. Perusing the various brochures being circulated in the halls of NASA and Congress in the mid-1980's, I came up the following list of prime scientific objectives:\n\nA1. Understanding the magnetic dynamos in stars\n\nA2. Probe the nature of the supernova process through observations of SNRs.\n\nA3. Determine the size and thermal conductivity of neutron stars, and constrain the equation of state for matter at extreme densities.\n\nA4. Confirm the existence of black holes on a stellar and galactic scale.\n\nA5. Measure the distribution of dark matter on various size scales.\n\nA6. Study the formation and the evolution of quasars\n\nA7. Establish the contribution of various classes of discrete sources to the X-ray background\n\nA8. Use the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect to measure the Hubble constant.\n\nA9. Measure the evolution of the heavy element content of the universe through observations of clusters of galaxies.\n\nA10. Study plasma physics and particle acceleration processes in stellar coronas, supernova remnants and cosmic jets.\n\nA11. Study the relation of high energy jets to apparently unrelated lower energy thermal phenomena such as star formation.\n\nA12. Potential use of a growing archive of thousands of serendipitous sources to discover new types of objects, ranging from brown dwarfs to quark stars to new types of galaxies to cosmic strings.\n\nThe list contained most of the elements of the LOXT list, but the impact of the discoveries made by the Uhuru, Einstein, HEAO -A and other observatories, as well as the growing connections with other fields of astronomy and the physics of elementary particles, is evident. Black holes are now on the list and it has been established that dark matter cannot be in the form of hot gas.\n\nA list prepared just before launch for PR purposes was similar, but shorter and less technical, and included the use of clusters of galaxies to test cosmological models.\n\nComparing the list of actual Chandra accomplishments with what was promised shows that Chandra has more than fulfilled the promises made. The list also shows that most of the discoveries, except the evidence bearing on double-degenerate precursors to Type Ia white dwarf explosions, were anticipated in a general way. The potential for discoveries in the solar system were mentioned in the LOXT and AXAF documents, but werenât given much ink. The discovery of dark energy wasnât anticipated, but it was well understood that the rate of formation of galaxy clusters would provide an important cosmological probe. I think it is also true that in every case the reality exceeded the anticipation â see the images of the Crab Nebula and the Perseus Cluster as prime examples.\n\nIt seems that astrophysical theorists deserve some credit for the close correspondence between what was promised and what was delivered. Maybe not so much for being visionary, but for their ingenuity in being able to adapt existing models and theories to the changing landscape revealed by observation.\n\nThat is not to say that there wonât be any surprises in the future with 95% of the energy density being in either in dark energy or dark matter, we are still very much in the dark! But the increasingly rapid and positive feedback between observational discoveries and theoretical modeling should give us a feeling of what to expect from Chandra in the next decade, and prepare the way for an ingenious use of the broad and deep data base that will be complemented by increasing multiwavelength coverage of the areas observed by Chandra.\n\nThere is great joy in serendipitous discoveries, and they make for good stories, but most of them are not totally unexpected - again dark energy is a notable exception, but even there, the researchers were confident they would find something of cosmic significance. Most discoveries occur because chance does indeed favor the prepared mind.\n\nSo Chandra seems well-prepared to make a wealth of discoveries in the coming years. I would give you my list, but I have already exceeded my allotment of words.\n\nUpbeat on Chandra's Longevity\n\nPaul Viens and Sabina Bucher Hurley\n\nAfter eleven-and-a-half years on-orbit, the Chandra X-Ray Observatory continues to provide ground-breaking science returns to the astrophysical community. When discussing Chandra in venues ranging from program reviews to conferences to lunch-time meetings with colleagues and friends, there is one question that inevitably comes to mind: âhow long will it last?â. The response to this question, like a great many others, is âit dependsâ. It depends on many factors, many of which are out of our control. However, there is much optimism among the science and operations groups affiliated with Chandra that it will be around for a long time to come.\n\nThe overall health of the Chandra vehicle remains outstanding. The observatory has exhibited very few anomalies in its eleven-and-a-half years of operation. All subsystems are currently operating on their primary side equipment with only two exceptions, the Inertial Reference Units (IRUs) and the Mechanism Controller Electronics (MCEs). In both cases, the units were swapped to their redundant side for operational considerations and not due to unit failures. Vehicle performance has been exceptional with all subsystems meeting, or exceeding their original design requirements. There is considerable margin in most of the vehicleâs prime systems. Currently, there are no vehicle concerns that would preclude continued extensions of the mission.\n\nThe Chandra X-Ray Observatory is composed of three main elements: the Spacecraft system, the Telescope system, and the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM). The figure below shows the current state of health of the major subsystem components within each of these elements. The Integrated Electron Proton Helium Instrument (IEPHIN) used as a radiation detector is the only subsystem with issues impacting performance; however, the MCP event rate data and the anticoincidence shield rate data from the High Resolution Camera provide alternative sources of radiation data to back up the IEPHIN unit.\n\nTo date, Chandra has only experienced five anomalies that impacted observations. All have been either fully resolved or are being effectively mitigated. Two of the issues are related to a faster than anticipated degradation of the vehicleâs Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) outer layer of silverized Teflon. The degradation has caused higher than expected temperatures on the sun-facing side of the Observatory. The exact cause of this accelerated degradation is not entirely understood; however, it has been well characterized and the effects are manageable while maintaining a full and efficient observing program. Although each anomaly or technical issue has had some operational impact, all have been efficiently managed such that the effect on science was minimized or, in some cases, completely avoided. The flight and science teams quickly identified and reacted to these events, and to several anomalies with no significant impact, and are well poised to do so again for future anomalies.\n\nSubsystem performance and the observatoryâs operating environment are assessed on daily, weekly, monthly, and biannual bases to quickly identify and respond to adverse trends. To continue operating at peak performance, the Chandra spacecraft requires a set of routine maintenance activities to ensure desired performance levels. These include ephemeris updates, star camera dark current calibrations, IRU calibrations, and periodic flight software modifications. Effects of orbit evolution are also well understood and are being addressed.\n\nIn addition to the research of possible future anomalies and preparing for their occurrence, the flight team has performed considerable analysis of the probability of extending vehicle life. Analyses associated with extending vehicle life include periodic studies of life limiting factors, which analyze all mission consumables and life-limited items. These investigations have looked at lifetime projections for static hardware items such as the Multi-Layer Insulation, propulsion thrusters, heaters, and OBC flight software memory, as well as lifetime projections for dynamic hardware items such as propulsion fuel, IRU spin bearings, battery charge/discharge cycles and mechanism moves. To date, these analyses have been able to show that, given no unexpected anomalies or other mission impacting problems, there were no concerns with reaching and/or exceeding the studiesâ target mission durations.\n\nWith regard to on-board consumables, of primary interest are the amount of fuel remaining for the MUPS thrusters, and budgeted allocations for items such as thruster warm starts and mechanism moves. At this point in the mission, less than 18% of the fuel in the MUPS tank has been consumed, thanks to judicious mission planning practices in managing momentum accumulation. Based on the recent fuel usage rate, there is an estimated 22 years remaining before a switch to the backup fuel supply in the IPS tank will be needed. The number of âwarm startsâ is also monitored closely, since a swap to the MUPS B-side will be needed if a pre-defined threshold based on qualification life testing is ever reached. A âwarm startâ is a thruster firing at a catalyst bed temperature of about 450 deg F, which occurs at the start of a momentum unload. The latest trends in the accumulation of warm starts suggest a swap will not need to be considered before year 19 or 20 of the mission, at which point the fresh B-side thrusters can be brought into service. The bottom line: the Chandra consumables are in good shape!\n\nElectrical power is the life-blood of the observatory, and aboard Chandra there is plenty of power for the extended mission. All three batteries are healthy, with capacity to spare for handling future eclipse events. The solar array continues to support all of Chandra's power demand, as well as the batteries' charge needs. The degradation of the solar arrayâs performance is closely following the pre-launch expectations. This, along with decreasing power needs as the spacecraft heating trend continues and the on-board heaters turn on less often, suggests that long-term solar array capability will remain well above the projected spacecraft and science instrument power needs for a 20+ year mission.\n\nOverall, Chandra vehicle health remains excellent. Although minor issues have surfaced, the operations team has ensured that these issues are non-impacting and do not threaten an extended Chandra mission. Continued diligence is being applied to subsystem performance trending and monitoring, as well as to managing thermal challenges and preparing for anomalies. At this time there are no known limitations due to degradation, consumables, aging, or obsolescence that would prevent Chandra from meeting Level 1 requirements over the course of a 20-year mission.\n\nInternational "
