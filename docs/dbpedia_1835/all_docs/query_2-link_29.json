He spent time exploring the mystical island made famous by the traditional houses with thatched roofs reaching for the sky. There are many outdoor activities throughout Western Sumba, including hiking one of the numerous trails, swimming in lagoons, walking through lush rice fields or exploring one of the many idyllic waterfalls. Sumbanese arts and crafts are also well known.
