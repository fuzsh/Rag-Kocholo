        "text": "Standing on the corner of the intersection of Farm to Market (FM) 455 and FM 2450 roads, buffeted by the cold wind and stream of passing cars, Howard Clark spoke with warmth and curiosity as he handled the artifacts that likely passed through the hands of his ancestors. He considered his growing understanding and appreciation of blacksmithing through his own hobby work; Clark became interested in blacksmithing without knowing that his ancestor Thomas “Tom” Cook Sr., an African American freedman, was an important blacksmith along the Chisholm Trail in the late nineteenth century. Traversing a landscape of memories, Clark traced his family's history, which embodies the arc of rural and urban life in North Texas through the mid- to late nineteenth and twenty-first centuries, from enslavement through Reconstruction, Jim Crow and into the present. Reflecting on learning more about his family history, Clark remarked, “I didn't realize there was a whole other half of my family in [this] area. I'm driving by every other day or so [patrolling as a police officer]. Let alone a grave up there on that place. I had no idea any of this existed at all.” Folded into the archaeological team, Clark unearthed the iron craftwork and material remnants of his family and was a firsthand witness to the emerging image of the lives of his ancestors. A gregarious presence and avid storyteller, Clark would quip, “There we were. . .” to mark the beginning of a story and emphasize shared historical experiences, filled with both the joy and solemnity of life.\n\nA car stopped along the side of the road, with its occupants stepping out and approaching the excavation site. Our archaeological team welcomed the visitors, offering them an informational handout. As we introduced the project and archaeological methods, we turned to Clark as he shared his family's story and his thoughts on the nonlocal specialists—whose team he joined too—who were meticulously digging on the street corner. By the end of the conversation, Clark and the visitors would usually discover that they had common acquaintances, and we would continue the work. Soon, another visitor would stop, and we would again share the story of Tom Cook and the communities of descendants and stakeholders who breathe life into the Bolivar Archaeological Project (BAP).\n\nThis article analyzes the research process of the BAP, illustrating how we can learn more together through archaeology as service and amplify an “undertold story” of African American blacksmiths on the Texas frontier through the material life of Tom Cook, an African American freedman living, working, and raising a family along the late nineteenth-century Chisholm Trail. Archaeologists working across governmental, academic, public, and private institutions have the capacity to impact descendant community members, stakeholders, and the broader public through practice designed to serve. The BAP demonstrates collaborative public archaeology as service by incorporating stakeholders into the project, thereby sharing authority and decision- making, developing relationships of trust and mutual respect, and co-producing knowledge. In this manner, the co-authors—including descendant community members Clark and Halee Clark Wright—bring people in to celebrate Black history by piquing curiosity and engaging community members with our research as it unfolds. The ultimate goal is to broaden the spectrum of empathy and support communities.\n\nThe BAP was conducted amid the broader urgency and growing awareness of long-standing historical inequities and the role of representation in archaeology (e.g., Flewellen et al. Reference Flewellen, Dunnavant, Odewale, Jones, Wolde-Michael, Crossland and Franklin2021; Franklin Reference Franklin1997). Considering this context, the BAP's research framework draws from the foundational Ransom Williams Farmstead Project. This was a Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)–sponsored cultural resource management (CRM) project involving archaeology, archival research, descendant community collaboration, and oral history research (Boyd et al. Reference Boyd, Franklin and Myers2011, Reference Boyd, Norment, Franklin, Myers and Lee2014, Reference Boyd, Norment, Myers, Franklin, Lee, Bush and Shaffer2015; Juneteenth Jamboree 2010; Franklin Reference Franklin2012; Franklin and Lee Reference Franklin and Lee2020). Widely recognized for its community and public outreach, the project produced a two-volume oral history report highlighting recollections of descendant community members (Franklin Reference Franklin2012), a documentary film (Juneteenth Jamboree 2010), and an online educational exhibit (Boyd et al. Reference Boyd, Norment, Franklin, Myers and Lee2014) that includes lesson plans for fourth- and seventh-grade students (Schlenk and Liebick Reference Schlenk and Liebick2014). This exemplifies the substantial and rewarding impacts of incorporating descendants and stakeholders into the project.\n\nThe co-authors acknowledge the historical trauma of marginalized African American communities due to systemic and structural forms of racism and oppression. Building trust with descendant communities and engaging in the co-production of knowledge is a critical step toward a more socially just world. The BAP lies at the intersection of multiple historical, social, and disciplinary shifts convulsing the field and society at large, in addition to growing efforts to create collaborative and public archaeology (e.g., Ashmore et al. Reference Ashmore, Lippert and Mills2010; Bollwerk et al. Reference Bollwerk, Connolly and Mcdavid2015; Colwell-Chanthaphonh and Ferguson Reference Colwell-Chanthaphonh and Ferguson2008; Dunnavant et al. Reference Dunnavant, Justinvil and Colwell2021; Flewellen et al. Reference Flewellen, Dunnavant, Odewale, Jones, Wolde-Michael, Crossland and Franklin2021; Skipper Reference Skipper2022; Sullivan Reference Sullivan2022). Through this, the collaboration centers on decolonizing and feminist critiques that destabilize historical systems of power by diffusing knowledge production across stakeholders and archaeological evidence (e.g., Atalay Reference Atalay2006; Franklin Reference Franklin2001; Haraway Reference Haraway1991; Liebmann Reference Liebmann and Stephen2018; Oland et al. Reference Oland, Hart and Frink2012). By practicing archaeology as service, the BAP and project members have become beholden to the descendants of Tom Cook and stakeholders as they are tied to their pasts.\n\nTo illustrate the collective voice that helped shape the BAP, this article was co-produced through the incorporation of conversations and interviews with Clark and Wright, descendants of nineteenth-century blacksmith Tom Cook. The authors represent the main collaborative groups for the BAP: Hanselka is the project manager for TxDOT, Menaker and Boyd are the co-principal investigators for Stantec; Franklin (Department of Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin) is the community outreach coordinator and lead oral historian, and Clark and Wright are outreach liaisons with the local African American community. The BAP exemplifies the possibilities of practicing archaeology as service through building relationships of trust and mutual respect with stakeholders involved in the project, allowing for the co-production of knowledge. The article first outlines the process by which the project unfolded and focuses on the key themes emphasized by collaborators, including giving communities a voice and feeling heard by the archaeological team. Collaborators additionally reflected on their desire for the project to be responsive to the communities and to provide meaningful products for members. Moving forward, archaeological projects interested in archaeology as service can engage in community outreach at the earliest stages of project design and research, enacting inclusive practices that offer open-ended engagement and build relationships of trust and mutual respect, potentially leading to sharing authority and decision-making."
