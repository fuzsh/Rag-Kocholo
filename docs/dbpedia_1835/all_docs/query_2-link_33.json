        "text": "UBON RATCHATHANI - Media reports the prehistoric Pha Taem paintings had been seriously damaged by rock falling from the crumbling cliff face were incorrect, Ubon Ratchathani governor Somsak Jangtrakul said on Monday\n\nThe crumbling cliff referred to was 6km away from the rock paintings, which had not been damaged, the governor said.\n\nThe Daily News Online carried a report on Monday saying the local Khong Chiam district chief had reported that the cliff started crumbling away again in late December, seriously damaging most of the remaining rock paintings.\n\nThe story was picked up by other news organisations.\n\nThe rock paintings, which are in Pha Taem National Park, are 3,000-4,000 years old and a major tourist attraction of the province.\n\nThe assortment of more than 300 prehistoric paintings originally spread along a 180-metre stretch of the cliff. It is the largest such collection found in Thailand, variously depicting animals, human hands, spiritual rites, farm activities and hunting scenes.\n\nDeep down the cliff on the park's east face flows the Mekong River that separates Thailand and Laos."
