        "text": "You may be asking, how did a Sydney librarian come to stay in Mailu, an island situated over 2500 kilometres north of Sydney, in 1932? Letters in the collection from Mander-Jones to her mother and from her Aunt Annie indicate that a family friend, missionary William Saville, arranged for her holiday in Papua. Saville was a London Missionary Society member, who was officially appointed to settle on Mailu, Papua, in Mar 1901 which he did for 35 years in the company of his wife, Fanny (nee Lawes). Saville’s letters to his brother, which are held at the Mitchell Library, show, besides being desperate for the latest cricket scores from London, that he was devoted to documenting the lives of the people of Mailu. We see this intention to document indigenous culture and society in a letter written on 18 Feb 1932 to Mander-Jones. Discussing her pending arrival Saville told Mander-Jones ‘Bring your sketching things, camera and good supply of films and Nepera glossy gas-light paper. We can develop here and print at night by lamp light. I do hope dear girl, you will have a thundering good holiday.’\n\nLetters from Mander-Jones to her family indicate that she was willing to document her time in various forms, with writing and sketching most effective for Mander-Jones. On 7 April 1932, as she departed from Walsh Bay, on The Macdhui Mander-Jones started keeping a journal of her experiences in Papua. She travelled along the south-eastern coastline for three months, staying on London Missionary Society mission sites. The journal provided comments about everyday and seasonal life. There are also woodcut prints and a sketch map bound into the journal. These illustrations showed Mailu people at work, often focused women, hunting, creating pots, caring for children.\n\nThe journal is a particularly striking item. Mander-Jones created an embroidered cover, grey backing material with yellow and red thread, the pattern represented local winds. The interior pages, lightweight and transparent, are depositories for typed descriptions and comments. The content is split into two distinct sections—the first, is an account that blends ethnography with personal experiences. The second half of the journal reads as a tropical leisure getaway detailing exotic sights, games and afternoon teas. Overall, these bound pages lack the stained, look expected of a well-travelled journal exposed to Papua’s humidity. This indicated she wrote a diary on site and transcribed the content into this edited and curated form.[1] Given Mander-Jones’ devotion to sending letters to her family and friends, and the infrequency of the mail service in Papua at this time the journal served two purposes; as a personal memory device and as a vibrant and informative means for a reader to experience Mailu.\n\nI hope you enjoy reading and seeing the images below.\n\n-Deborah\n\nNote: The originals are held at the State Library of New South Wales, Mander-Jones collection, MLMSS 4337.\n\nMy visit to Mailu\n\nApril May June\n\n1932\n\n[loose leaf, handwritten letter inserted between the cover and the first, bound, typed, page]\n\nThe design on the cover is an adaptation of Nogara-i-da-leilei- the clouds standing in line.\n\nMailu and other Papuan words mentioned in the diary are pronounced as spelt – sounding every vowel and pronouncing the vows as in Italian.\n\nNames ending in U are pronounced without the U eg Bagam(u), Dim(u)ga.\n\nThe lino cuts are from drawings made at Mailu with the exception of the canoes and the large pandanus which are drawn from snap shops and memory.\n\nlove from\n\nPhyllis.\n\n[next page, bound, typed, there are some editing marks, these have been excluded in this draft]\n\n1.\n\n1932\n\nApril 7th The Macdhui drew away from no. #8 Walsh Bay in the afternoon sunlight while bright coloured streamers broke and fluttered into the water. A sail down the harbour, a long wait at Watson’s Bay, and then through the Sydney heads and out onto the great Pacific rollers following each other in and out of the gathering darkness.\n\nApril 8th This morning dawned bright with flying showers. The ship shook and jumped as she ploughed through a choppy swell. About 6. 30 I was the only passenger on deck – and a rather green faced one. All the good sailors appeared about 7. 30 for a brisk walk before breakfast, when they disappeared for about half an hour by 9 o’clock games were in full swing. There was the NSW coast to look at too-we were close in. But I buried my head against my cushion, tucked my rug tie to round my feet and spent the day in a rather miserable sleep. Mrs A. H. Bunting Came to speak to me. I’m afraid I was very giddy and only half awake-early to bed and a happier dawn in the muddy but peaceful Brisbane River.\n\nApril 9th A long day among the empty flats and Muddy Waters of the river estuary. We took up at Pinkenbah and drank “land tea” at the railway station. Many people went up to Brisbane but I stayed on board- had a visit from Rhys in the afternoon- then goodbye and we slid down Brisbane river again.\n\nApril 10th At sea out of sight of land for the first time, though it could not have been far beneath the western horizon, for about 2:00 o’clock we passed the Cooma, high and dry these three years on a sandbank off an islet where there is a lighthouse.\n\nApril 11th\n\nOn the back of the menu at lunch yesterday we read that at dawn we would pass through Whitsunday passage\n\n2.\n\nSo I hurried on deck early and saw the sunrise through the mist which lay everywhere over an enchanting scene. Islands of strange contour rising like clouds from the glassy waters were gradually lit by the sun’s rays penetrating the mist. Wooded slopes, grass clad folds and steeps and outcrops of red and grey rock, with here and there a rocky point fringed with Pines- white beaches sweep along the bays and little waves break white against each precipitous head land. The ship drew near to some islands scarce half a mile in length and rising fully 500 feet, and as we sailed along, vista after vista of island in closed waters faded into the distance in ever lighter shades of blue.\n\nIn the afternoon about five we approached Townsville and sailed up the Bay through hot windless air. The little port is very glaring amber- railway tracks and breakwaters, bread roads an water tanks painted black, but beyond one can see trees and to the right a higher Red Bluff under which lies the white roofed town among green trees. Everywhere the horizon is bounded by blue hills, even to see ward where islands rise out of the bay.\n\nAfter dinner on board I went with Mrs Irwin to the pictures at the Townsville Wintergarden-Theatre built mostly of lattice and decorated with tropical plants in pots and baskets. For 2/- We had good seats Anna long programme- 3 gazettes (rather stale) end to long pictures (rather so so but I dare say we were unlucky.) At 11 p.m. After looking at pictures since seven. 50 we emerged into bright Starlight and began to wonder about regaining the ship. A ferry runs from Townsville to the port but as we had come in by car we did not know the Wharf so we questioned the driver of one of Townsville ‘s buses. We quite wished for a ride in his vehicle, a queer looking contrivance, high off the ground with steps at the rear and awning for roof, but we managed to distinguish\n\n3.\n\nthrough the driver’s whiskers that the fair was 6d., i.e. double after 11 P. M stop and that we hadn’t far to go. So armed with his directions we set off down Townsville ‘s Main Street and found the little white launch which serves as ferry just setting off laden with ships passengers. With many others I sat on the roof and enjoyed the reflections in the style Atwater on the 20 minute’s trip.\n\nApril 12 Directly after breakfast off for a car drive around Townsville for we sale at noon. Mrs butcher, Mrs Filliter, Mrs Irwin, Miss Laing and myself hired a car recommended by Mr Nevitt. The driver was a patriotic citizen and showed us “the highest hill in the world” “the widest street in Australia” and “the largest railway station in Queensland.” He took us past the blacksmiths forge where teams all made their first halt on the way in land in the old days- and the spot where Townsville’s first brewery was built. The owner made his fortune and then became a public benefactor by building an asylum for the men his beer had sent mad exclamation point or such was our drivers tale.\n\nWe halted by a swamp of blue water lilies- acres of blue flowers satin green paddocks- pale stemmed gum trees edged the swamp- there brown foliage outlined against the blue sky and distant blue hills. White ibis and grey cranes flew over the dreamy scene. Our objective was the Botanic Garden where we stood beneath a banyan Ann wandered among ferns and orchids under a rough shelter of lattice Ann poms. Purple and orange orchids were in flower and there was giant maidenhair standing 18 inches high- baskets of fern hung five and six feet from the ground with fronds sweeping the floor an many strange leaved plants creeping round rocks and up posts. Townsville is a hot place as we learned when we stopped at the post office to send off the last letters we could post in Australia.\n\n4.\n\nAs we slid over the Bay passed to magnetic island I talked with Mrs Chatterton [?] a friend of Mrs Banfield of dunk island fame. She told me how when her husband died Mrs ban Feld was alone on the island where according to his people in England he had buried his talents. She fired a gun to attract the notice of a passing ship and she and the man the ship left with her buried her husband and erected across over his grave. On the cross were Thoreau’s words “we do not all hear the same music, every man must pipe to the music that he hears.” By lunchtime this day we were through the barrier- a sharp turn to the right- then to the left and across the open sea once more feeling the ocean swell.\n\nApril 13th Plenty of ocean swell all day so I did not feel like packing- anyway I understand there is no likelihood of catching the pop one chief- the coastal boat which stops at Mailu, so I will have to stay on the Macdhui till she gets to Samarai and go back in the P.C from there.\n\nApril 14th Daylight to see the first glimpse of the New Guinea coast. As usual I was washed from one deck to another by the men doing the decks but was soon joined by Mrs butcher and Mrs Lang and we began to distinguish the haze of land. It was a great day but as we passed through coral reefs we could see the green of shallow water. The coast was a succession of sharply pointed hills rising hundreds of feet and after coming through the passage in the reef we rounded one of these hills and found ourselves at Port Moresby. The town lies on an isthmus on our eastern side and the port sweeps away to the West. The doctor’s inspection was soon overran the breakfast bell rang as we were drawing up to the Wharf.\n\nAt breakfast I heard some startling news from Mr Horan- he had seen the purple in chief on the slip in the harbour- and had hardly heard it when a message came that\n\n5.\n\nA gentleman was asking for me at the pursers’ office. It was I knew Mr Chatterton LMS missionary at Port Moresby to whom Mr Seville had written. At the top of the companionway, I found him talking to Mrs butcher who was also to go to the Mission so I rushed off to pack- hurried goodbyes-a hectic struggle with suitcases, a short interview with customs- and hardly realising it, I had left the Macdhui end was West out to the mission, 3 miles westward round the Bay.\n\nThe road skirted the Bay and soon left the little Township- past the golf links and Government House- set on a grassy rise at the end of an avenue of poincianas- Cross the sand flat to the marine village of Poreporena and twisted up a steep hillside to the mission. Here on a cool verandah we were welcomed by Mrs Chatterton.\n\nThe mission is built on a Stony hill above the village towards which the ground falls steeply, but the slope to the north is more gradual and spreads into garden flats which again rise steeply into hills 700 and 800 feet high. The outlook to the hills is very beautiful. Groves of QCA nuts and patches of Bush very the green of grassy hillsides and to the West the harbour is spread among palm fringed shores an hills rising higher and higher in the distance.\n\nA beautiful island called Tatana shuts off the view of the inner harbour, I am told the whole Australian fleet can be at anchor unseen from Port Moresby or the sea.\n\nThe teachers houses, church, school Ann mission bungalows are built on the hill, the main bungalow on the Crest, and among the houses are huge friendship any trees, custard apples an coconut palms. The bungalow is an iron roofed, wooden building with wide verandahs back and front, four rooms between the two Ann kitchen an girls quarters forming a separate wing. The teachers wives take it in\n\n6.\n\nTurns to do the work of the house and small boys wait at table and do the kitchen work under Mrs Chatterton’s supervision. The missionary seemed to spend a great deal of time on the wide verandah on the northern side with the sea breeze blowing through the rooms behind and sewing in singing classes and prayers held here.\n\nFrom my room I faced southeast and looked across the verandah through palms and trees to the village built on twisty piles over the water. Over the bay lay Port Moresby built on an acre of land ending in a high promontory.\n\nOh after lunch we drove into Port Moresby to visit Burn’s Philip and the post office. The latter was closed for mail sorting so we were frustrated.\n\nMany natives are employed in the town both in clerical and manual work and are continually passing through the hot glaring streets. Groups of native girls and children sit about in patches of shade. The man’s dress Rami- a length of stuff wound round his waist and hanging down in a fold in front. At the back the rami is about knee length sometimes longer and for strenuous work the fold is passed between the legs and tucked into his belt at the back. White rami’s are plentiful but labourers were all shades and for best natives are fond of brilliant colours. The girls wear grass petticoats and both day and the boys are fund of decorating their here and arm bands with flowers- brilliant red oleander- hibiscus- yellow and orange flowers and especially the bright pink flowers of a creeper called mountain rose. Burns Phillips Wharf lies alongside the town and their store and officers, square and dazzling white, dominate the Main Street. There is another trading company called the British New Guinea trading company but it is not so imposing. The homes of the residents are of weatherboard\n\n[new page; includes maps of Papua and Port Moresby]\n\n7.\n\nEnd set among flowering trees on the hillsides.\n\nPort Moresby in April was looking its greenest- it is one of the driest spots in Popeye with less than half the rainfall of the coast farther east and less than 1/6 of the far West, Kikori way, where 300 inches for per annum. The temperature is very even. On hot days the from monitor registers 90 odd degrees an in cooler weather varies between 75 degrees and 80 degrees. In land of course the extremes are greater but even on the mountains over 10,000 feet high snow has never been reported.\n\nAfternoon tea at the mission was grateful after the heat and about 5:00 PM Mrs Butcher, Mrs Filliter to and I walked along the western side of the hill to see the sunset behind Tatana and came back by way of Poreporena. An animated game of cricket was going on among the village girls- bats of palm frond bases and sticks for stumps. The bowl i did not examine but it was certainly hard. While we watched a girl was clean bold and all the fielders clapped rhythmically to celebrate the eventful stop through their houses higher on their piles we saw the Macdhui leave Port Moresby and disappear round the hill on her way to Samurai.\n\nMrs Butcher had heard that a small boat with an oil engine- the Veimauri- with saline West at daylight on Saturday morning- that I’m scheduled for the popcorn chief to leave also. She was delighted to get away so soon having expected a weight of 10 days or perhaps two or three weeks.\n\nApril 15th However, even this early start left Friday clear. The morning Mrs Butcher and her friend spent in recovering the latters £50 deposit from the customs- burns Phillip had demanded it in Sydney as she was not purchasing a return ticket- while I had a far more interesting time wandering round Poreporena taking\n\n8.\n\nPhotographs. My guide was Taunau- The native teacher, who spoke fair English and was very friendly. We went down the western side of the hill Antrim first all the villages; for Poreporena is really four- mostly Motuan people- but if you from the hills speaking a different language. Approaching from the West one comes first to Kuriu- a hill people- then Hanuabada, Elevala and Tanuabada- Motuan- and last Hohodei, Hill people again. Poreporena People are very well off- they have electric light on the beach and water laid on two pumps where they can fill their water pots. The lack of rain had made the pumps rather inefficient during my visit so they were carrying water as well but in early morning and evening the water would run. The houses consist of a single large room with walls of plaited palm leaves and roofs of sago thatch. The roof juts out in front over a kind of veranda platform reached by three or four rungs made of poles- and from the platform one mounts a couple more rungs to the doorway.\n\nTaunau took me to visit two houses in Tanuabada. The first was that of the father of Moreatowa a government census taker. Moreatowa Received us in the doorway at the head of the ladder rungs an ushered us into the house. A deckchair was produced from the rafters and set up in the centre of the room facing the doorway. This seat of honour was offered to me, my host sat on a bunk on my left with a woman nearby- another woman was in the background on my right and Taunau somewhere behind. After a moment of dead silence I remarked that it was pleasant to come in to the cool of the house out of the hot street. This was true as well as polite for Poreporena houses have quite a large door each end and the roofs of Sega Thatcher very cool- but no reply resulted. I then asked Taunau if my host spoke English\n\n9.\n\nAnd was told he certainly did. In the next 10 minutes I had an opportunity of judging for myself as Moreatowa held forth at length- describing his work and traveling- and explaining that his presence in Tanuabada was due to his health- he had a pain in his chest- if it became too bad “my breath stop- then i stop.” From this expression it will be seen that his English was broken. But it was not pigeon an I easily followed what he said.\n\nAfter about 1/4 of an hour’s visit we said goodbye and Taunau took me to see a deacon’s house. It was built right out over the water and approached by a rickety line of planks between the houses nearer the beach. Here Taunau showed me Nets of New Guinea string with floats of sago palm and weights of cockle shells, also photos of missionaries and church members.\n\nOur road up to the mission again lay past the church and workshop so we visited both and at the steps of the mission bungalow I said goodbye to my guide and thanked him for his kindness.\n\nLunch we ate with the Nixons and miss Riley. The latter takes the primary school at the mission and the former are on their way to Jokea, a western station. We spent a delightful couple of hours hearing the impressions of newcomers to the country an left about three to be ready for a drive to Pali which Mr Chatterton had suggested.\n\nPali Lies to the east of the town so our way was over the best roads of Port Moresby- through the Main Street and over the isthmus to Ela beach where are beautiful road skirts the beach residences on one side and a line of Casuarinas on the other. A few miles of fairly open country have to be crossed-the aerodrome- swampy flats and Groves of coconuts with hills rising steeply inland\n\n10.\n\nWhere the road to Rona falls turns to the left, and on the right high slopes up to the brink of cliffs. On one of these is perched a village, and rounding a hill one comes to the village of Pali line along a beach which is enclosed by hills at either end. It doesn’t also houses perched like Poreporena UN piles over the water face the curve of the beach and there is a little white church and a teachers house. Here I tasted cocoa milk for the first time and drank and drank from a little nut till I could drink no more. The liquid is wonderfully cool and I was sorry to have to hand it over to the small girls who were hanging around hopefully. I could only manage about 1/4 of the milk in my nut.\n\nWe wandered along the beach among knew dugouts for canoes which the people were making, while Mr Chatterton interviewed the teacher- then bade goodbye and drove back to the mission.\n\nApril 16th On Saturday morning Mr Chatterton took Mrs butcher and Mrs Filliter over to port to board the Veimauri. She sailed at dawn so they set off just before 6:00 AM. The pop when chief was delayed an I had another day.\n\nThe morning we spent partly in the Township and partly on the mission veranda and after lunch and siesta Mr Chatterton took me to Baruni, a hill village some miles to the West. This was a much rougher Dr than yesterday’s but we or rather the car dashed briefly at all obstacles an we pursued our rocky way without mishap. The track skirts the harbour whose waters stretch away to the South and West. The Bush is low growing for the most part, though here and there we passed through Groves of cocoa nuts. It was on this drive I first saw in the trees the white clumps of Ant nests made of leaves mattered together. I heard afterwards that the ants are\n\n11.\n\nNearly all honey ants that natives will pluck a nest from a tree, break it open, and pour its contents, answering all down their throats! Rounding a rocky hillside we came insight of Fairfax harbour which is cut off from the main port by the island of Tatana. On this island lies a fair sized village of Moutans who have to carry every drop of water from the mainland. They must travel very well over a mile by land and water with their round pots full of the precious liquid. We were on Baruni before we could see the village- but is steep hill and a sharp turn brought us into the street running along the Crest of the hill. Poplin hill villages used formerly to be built on the most precipitous crags and Razorbacks-the house is often erected on poles with a crevice hundreds of feet deep beneath- when one has often to hell an enemy from one’s door, the further he falls the better- gradually, however, many of the hill people are coming nearer the coast and down to the riverbanks. Back at Poreporena we had afternoon tea and set off to climb about 800 feet to the top of Ugava, a hill behind the mission. In clear weather 1 can see the main range, raising 13,000 feet peaks against the skyline, but this day it was shrouded in rain. To the east, South and West, however, the prospect was clear- E the cliffs and valleys darkening in the evening mist- S the town and harbour spread like a map at our feet and West Fairfax harbour behind Tatana- stretching away to the high heels shutting in the view. We looked out to see past the palm covered coral flats of fisherman’s island and thought of Mrs Butcher well on her way to Kikori in the little Veimauri.\n\nGrowing on the summit was a quantity of a sweet smelling weed- rather overpowering at close quarters but pleasant in the open air. It is the favourite Motuan\n\n12.\n\nSent in the little girls who had accompanied us decorated their hair and arm bands with sprays of flowering stamps and as they descended the grassy slope below us the wind blew the scent back in our faces. The grass is on the Port Moresby hills a beautiful- at this time they were waves of vivid green. Later they will be silver and golden brown shimmering in the wind and after drought the hills are brown and bare- a radish earthy colour I believe. But if beautiful the grasses have villainous seeds- long spiky ones insinuate themselves through ones clothing up to the waist and short prickly ones that stick like glue to one’s legs. I still had grass seeds on me when I arrived in Mailu four days later.\n\nDown at the mission again we heard that the Veimauri had not got far along the coast before she developed engine trouble Anne had to send a boy across the peninsula to Stuarts boat building place the other side of the port from Port Moresby. Mr. Stewart had signalled to the town at a boat had towed the Veimauri in. They spent the night over at Mr Stuart’s but were gone early the next morning for captain Anderson of the PowerPoint chief could see no sign of them as we left at 6:30.\n\nApril 17th Up early again and Mr Chatterton had another early trip to port with me and my luggage. The pop in chief is a quaint little steamer about the size of a large tug. She has four cabins on the deck which serve as a bridge and two beneath on the starboard side, a sort of saloon forward and bathroom and laboratory on the port side.\n\nBehind the built up deck is a wide hatch covering the whole damn beyond the Hatch the funnel and winches to work the cargo. The stern has a roof on\n\n13.\n\nWhich two very heavy looking boats swing on davits-on the roof two, on my trip, was a shelter of palm leaves in which travelled a complete native family. In the stern there were also a number of native passengers and a pig as well as the crew. We found captain Anderson just rousing from his sleep. He remarked that mission people are always early- so after seeing me installed in a cabin on the upper deck Mr Chatterton said goodbye. We waited for half an hour or so till the crew had got all snug until my fellow passenger appeared an left the Wharf soon after sunrise. The other passenger was a Mrs Gemmel, wife of a plantation manager at Babaguina near Abau- she was a tall thing girl from Queensland, married about a year- and was charming to me and shared her little boy servant with me- the first thing he did been to wash our cabin water bottles which had rings of brown sediment ornamenting their sides. He was a bright young specimen about 13 or 14- very important at having gone with Sinebada to Samarai- then to port on the white man’s big ship the Montoro, which seemed chiefly to have impressed him as being marvellously clean in full of food. He was very good on the P. See. Always at hand when we called- one of his chief jobs was to water the plants Mrs Gemmel was taking home to her garden in he had to be watched lest he should use saltwater!\n\nTurning east from Port Moresby the coast is very beautiful and the seas this clear morning marvellous shades of green and blue with alternating deep water and coral reef- but the peculiar motion of the P.C Breasting the waves soon got the better of me and I retired to my bunk which I had taken the precaution to make up with my own sheet and pillow before leaving port. All my luggage I had carefully lined with unbleached calico\n\n14.\n\nAnd added a plentiful supply of mothballs- and for my clothes at night including hats- a bag which I could pin up securely. I was glad if these when precautions when dusk fell and I saw the size of the cockroach inhabitants of the P.C. We were given hurricane lamps- for the electric light is put out early and I left mine burning and had a torch under my pillow. I could not bear the idea of one walking on me in the dark. However, this is anticipating- there was still the whole day before us. I am afraid i missed a beautiful piece of coast for i could not hold up my head till we drew into KapaKapa about lunchtime. Here I took a picture of the natives coming off the ship from the marine village. There followed a long afternoon along the coast and about four we reached Kaparoka where there is a government timber mill. There was plenty of timber to load- 2 barges of it so we stayed the night. The land opposite was well grassed and fairly clear of bush and looked most enticing but there was no opportunity of landing. The man in charge of the mill came on board while the native struggled with the huge sawn logs and we had his company till late. He was full of grievances against the magistrate of the district because he let off the natives who raided the gardens of the neighbouring village. If the villages continued to fail to get redress through the government Kaparoka would take the law into their own hands and there would be a dead native in the Bush one morning. He (The manager of the timber mill) had quantities of rice to sell for labour but could not get anyone to work, so maintained the natives were not stealing from hunger. In fact a woman had been brought to him an accused of stealing yams Anne had immediately offered to pay a fine. She then thought she had paid for the yams and began to walk off with them- but was\n\n15.\n\nSoon disillusioned- also if she could pay a find and was hungry why had she not come to buy rice?\n\nThis sounds logical but I have since heard there has been over a year’s drought in Papa and all the ladies have been short of food. In the Port Moresby district last year old taxes were omitted and tonnes of rice distributed.\n\nThe P.C.’s Delay of four days had been a nuisance to the timber manage are- a barge laden ready had sunk in rough weather an had to be unloaded underwater to float it again. The barges are certainly heavily laden logs all over the deck and two swung each other side underwater. The second load was brought alongside an hoisted aboard the electric light.\n\nApril 18th At dawn on April 18th we crossed the Bay to Hula then had a calm trip to Aroma onto Abau which we reached just before sunset. The island of Abau is a government station, the president magistrate being mr flint. His district extends past Mailu so I felt I was nearing my destination. The island lies in cloudy Bay an at the mouth of several rivers. Robinson river where the horns plantation is situated comes in from the northeast and there are several Guina- among them Bagaguina- Mrs Gemmel’s home.\n\nThere is a Wharf on the east of Abau and we saw the flints down to meet the boat- Mr and Mrs Flint, Alan Flint aged about eight and a friend, miss Irwin, from Mogubo the plantation opposite Mailu- her suitcases were on the Wharf so I should have company for the rest of the trip.\n\nMrs. Gemmel was sad not to see her husband but as soon as we got ashore we heard he had been waiting since Thursday and just gone home an hour before P.C what cited. News had come down that in his\n\n16.\n\nAbsence a cough had been taken by a crocodile- a new tank had overturned in a boy had been mauled by a wild pig! He had said he would bring the boy down later in the evening to be treated by the native medical boys at Abau.\n\nThe flints opened their mail as soon as it came off and we walked up to the house. The island rises steeply from the Wharf and the path winds up through an Ave of young poor pause and acalyphas. Go poms grow everywhere and the little P.C moored at the Wharf looked quite attractive seeing through their beautiful Frans. On top of the hill we found ourselves on a plateau beautifully laid out- grass under the poms in the path edge with croutons and Acalyphas. There is quite a zoo on Abau- cuscus- red parrots- white cockatoos- cassowary- tortoises and wallabies. The cuscus Is a quaint little animal like an O possum but has yellow fur and very prominent eyes. His long tail is bare of fur underneath and spotted with alternating dark and bright yellow fur on top. As we drew near the house the park like grounds changed garden. Anaba covered with beautiful mauve thunbergia, and flowering shrubs and plants which we could not distinguish in the gathering dusk. Mrs Flint had asked me to dine with them so we sat in the cool room under the house till it was time for lamps. In a hot climate a cement floor and cheers under the house or a great idea and I was surprised not to see the cool space used more frequently. Nearly all pop one bungalow are built up on piles and it is a simple matter to allow enough space to enable people to stand upright. The flints have banks add friends on three sides- IV leading on to a grass plot across which a path takes one to the steps up to the house. Hot baths were a great pleasure after two days and a night on the PC and so was the food after the few\n\n17.\n\n[insert lino cut, a loose copy and bound page, ‘The mission bungalow at Ogobada’]\n\nUnsavoury mouthfuls I had since leaving port. We ate in the lounge under the house and Mr Gemmel appeared about eight. 15 while we were still seated. An hour in the drawing room with a gramophone and then down to the boat. The whole household it came down to see us on board in spite of a heavy shower of rain. Miss Irwin and I slept in the airiest cabin which happened to be hers- the other side of the ship was breathless.\n\nMailu at last.\n\nApril 19th Early next morning we left the wolf and after a call at table point with letters for Mr clay, tossed our way across table bay. I felt very rocky but managed to look ahead occasionally for the first glimpse of Mailu. Captain Anderson would not say definitely when we should arrive but it was obvious we would be there that morning. A brief glimpse of a little misty I land it was blooded out by rained but in an hour or two it was plainly distinguishable and at 11:00 AM canoes were coming out to meet us. On the nearest I could see Mr Seville- his suitcase beside him ready to go to meet me at samurai in case i had missed the P.C. At Port Moresby- but of course they had been wondering what on earth had happened to her the last few days. He did not see me till the canoe was quite close- though from the shore he had been studying the P.C for some time through a telescope. Mailu at last! A double peaked line of hills about 500 feet high- covered by a mantle of grass which falls in folds to ahem of cocoa nuts and casuarinas. The island is about a mile and a half long an on an average half a mile wide and is fringed with white coral beaches against which the waves lap gently for the encircling reef protects them.\n\nFor the moment, however, my eyes were not on Mailu, but on the little Outrigger canoe bearing Mr Saville out to the P.C. 12 days from Sydney only,\n\n18.\n\nBut familiar faces seemed very far away and to the joy of seeing friends again I could add the excitement of landfall in A lonely spot. On the shore too, I could see the white mission bungalow and the girls in red skirts dancing on the beach as they saw me, and running up to the house to tell Mrs Saville. Meanwhile the canoe was almost alongside and we could call out to each other. Hurried farewells to my friends on the P.C and Mr Saville was soon on board. While he received the things consigned to Mailu I climbed over the side onto the canoe and my suitcases were handed down. Then assure- but by stages- for I had to be transferred to a smaller canoe in the shallow water and then carried ashore.\n\nMrs Saville was on the beach with all the girls, also Bindel- who I soon got to know as a very superior canine aristocrat.\n\nOf course our tongues were hard worked though in the excitement of meeting we occasionally fell silent and just looked at each other. But after the first half an hour there was much to be done. I was longing for a bath to wash off the feel of the P.C. And lunch went well in a cool veranda room- sheltered by the shutters built round the bungalow and facing a view of 5 1/2 miles of blue sea to the mountains of the mainland seen through the palms in the garden.\n\nAfter lunch I left the Savills to their mailbag- a great monthly event- and did some unpacking. My room lies at the back of the bungalow. It has on one side a wide UN glassed window sheltered by a shutter- a thin slab of wood supported by cross pizzas end by stronger wood on the edge and swung on screws about 18 inches from the top on either side. The shutter is held in place by a length of wood pierced by holes which fit onto a nail on the window sill-and painted white to\n\n20. [note page numbers skip 19]\n\nOf tanks. All the rain water is stored in a big cement tank under the house.\n\nBehind the mission the hill rises steeply, clad with trees, poms and ferns and garden surrounds all the mission building. Near the House of three huge poinciana trees- there spreading branches now hung with long purple- brown beans and only yellowing leaves in a few stray scarlet flowers suggest the glorious summer canopy. They have lunch and covered trunks and on the poinciana behind the house grow giant staghorns. The ground is everywhere covered with a low growing grass- a variety of couch- which makes a fine even lawn- partly because of the poor sandy soil and partly because it is vigorously swept every morning by the mission children. Two cascara Trees flank the house and must be beautiful when hung with vivid yellow sprays- and the garden has friendship any trees- hibiscus, oleander and crotons of every shade. A lovely shrub with sprays of orange flowers resembling bouvardia is in full bloom in all the flower beds and paths at edge with little starry pink lilies.\n\nFrom the house one goes along a path on terrace and down steps in a rough wall of weather beaten stones to the garden. Stones edge the path to the beach about the length of a tennis court away and besides the path stand old canoe ends lightened overran broken with age. A Bush house, covered with stag horns an orchards and sariba, the creeping fern the natives use in their pleated arm bands and belts, stands to the right, and across the garden to the left Lisa tennis court. Caught and garden are shaded by canutt poms and high casuarinas grow along the beach. One passes through a line of them on the left to the cricket ground around all four sides of which they are planted. Teachers houses\n\n[new page]\n\n[lino print bound Church at Ogobada]\n\n21.\n\nEnd the workshop are built in their shade.\n\nOn the other side of the garden is the church – white with brown crossbeams with a native touch- and beyond it a strip of Bush passed which goes the path that leads round ahead land to the next day and the village of Mailu.\n\nThe native path from the village runs all along the bottom of the garden and skirts the cricket ground to the native gardens on this side of the island and every morning women and children pass along at- the women laden with gardening tools in the morning and with bundles of firewood add baskets of vegetables in the evening. They sling their burdens from their foreheads Ann will carry great weights. One often sees a woman with a bundle of firewood- basket of vegetables and baby perched on top.\n\nBeyond the path grow hibiscus and other native shrubs and a mauve vetch which binds the sand above high watermark. Mailu Beaches of white and soft and strewn with driftwood Ann broken shells. At high tide the water is several feet deep over the reef but when the tide is out one can walk over coral for about 100 yards from the beach. Opposite Ogobada there is a lagoon with a narrow passage to the northeast. It is the only break in the reef round the island an Mr Seville thinks it is due to fresh water from a spring flowing out underground. The lagoon forms a convenient harbour for the mission launched during the season of the southeast wings which blow during the winter months. In the summer when northwesterners below the launch has to be hold high and ride to the sheltered Cove near the village.\n\nAbout 6 miles of sea separate Mailu from the mainland which we see as a line of purple hills with Blue Mountains behind rising over 10,000 feet among the clouds.\n\n22.\n\nThe three highest peaks are Suckling, Dayman and Simpson. 30 years ago Mr Saville went in among these mountains, and talking of these high peaks to the natives told them the white man’s names. Many years later he was up there again with the government magistrate who wished to find out the native names, but the natives had adopted the new titles from only once hearing them and refused to give any others.\n\nIt must be wonderful up among those hills but time an opportunity is denied me. Besides I wonder how I should get on around precipitous paths over dizzy bridge is made by felling a single long slender tree across a gorge and up and down the 1000 foot slopes. I only know the tales not the reality of wading rivers- of savage tribes and of beautiful forests the higher ones called the mossy forests- where the way may look like a carpet but is really full of snares where the unwary traveller may fall continually in the crevices hidden by the Moss. To revive aching limbs after a strenuous day the natives use unnatural. Believes I kept in the village and rubbed on size and cars. The result is agony for about 15 or so minutes but afterwards a great peace.\n\nBet from Mailu beach the afternoon of my first day the adventures of the hills were closed in distant blue haze and misty white clouds- as the sun went down to the sea the crossline turn gold, the clouds pearly grey and delicate rose, and the sky green in the blue behind. Near the sun was hung a shining curtain of vermilion end orange and against this glowing background stretch grey clouds “standing in line” Nogara – is the pattern is called with which the women decorate their part rooms, taking the idea from this formation often seen in the southern and western sky. Gradually the reflection of the sunset lit up even the east and a soft rosy cloud\n\n23.\n\nSean there against the deep blue which seemed to be made deeper and richer by the golden moon. As floor to the wondrous seen lay the ever changing see- molten golden copper in the west- a strange reflected blue in the east- east and west both growing purple as darkness fell.\n\nI have tried to put down some of my impressions on my first day here and in the order in which they came- Mr and Mrs Saville and the mission children- the mission house in the garden in the whole station as I saw it on the tour of inspection Mr Saville and I made after lunch.\n\nMr and Mrs Saville seemed to regret very much that so many of their people- nearly all the men in fact- are away east in their canoes. Every year in April the Mailu go to the reefs 200 and 300 miles eastward and collect a conus show from which they make arm shells. They will return early in June and in October when they have a good store of arm shells, and before the northwest trade is blowing, they sail West to Aroma where they trade their arm shells- chiefly for pigs. Then the northwest will begin to blow and send them home again. In the meantime the population of the village is mostly women and children.\n\nThese yearly journeys, casting April and West in October, have been going on from traditional times in when white men first came to Papua they called these waters Amazon BAE because passing ships saw only women here- paddling canoes back and forth to the mainland an work in the gardens.\n\nSoon after dinner on my first evening there was a great noise of shouting, and going on the veranda we saw flaring tortures being carried round from the village. “The people come to welcome you” Mr Saville\n\n24.\n\nSaid- along the shore they came in were joined by canoes bearing the few men here just now. Soon the garden and cricket ground were ablaze of leaping lights. The torches are dead cocoa nut leaves Anna bundle is carried on the back to replace those that burnt out. We went down to speak to the people and there were renewed outbursts of sound above the continuous shouting. They waved their torches on higher than dash them on the ground Anna every swish clouds of sparks were scattered on the darkness. At last the torches began to burn down and the people departed. The night was cloudy but now the moon began to shine clear and we walked round to the village- to return the compliment of visit. It was a thrilling first sight of Mailu village- the high peaks of the houses through black shadows on the sand of the moonlit St- people were still outside sitting on platforms at the entrances or standing in little groups. We went right along then back and the girls played games for us. They have many games- circular- in two lines- sometimes parallel, sometimes opposite. Joining in a circle hands on each others arms they sing little songs- Porekaka a plaintive one to which they sway- Kui for which they join hands and filling up their hands at the end. In another every head is down towards the centre an all that is visible a grass skirt san leg Swain to a slow hum- then suddenly the time livens- they leap straight and jump round still clasping each other ‘s shoulders. The cuscus is a great favourite but becomes very monotonous as it can go on forever- The cuscus a little girl stands on a house platform and the players form 2 lines facing each other with joined hands. 2 girls hold the cuscus’ hands in she leaps from couple to couple as they sing. Each couple as they are passed join on again in front. Gorume Is also played in two\n\n[new page]\n\n[lino print, bound, ‘Pandanus and paddling canoe on the beach at Mailu. Mainland in the distance]\n\n25.\n\nLines, the latest stooping and walking backwards still clasping hands under the row of arms. Gorume Has a pleasant song and represents the gorume- a shellfish going into his shell. After they had played us many games we had evening prayers in the moonlight and returned to Ogobada.\n\nDaily life on the mission.\n\nApril 20th One of the first things after I arrived was an introduction to the mission boys and girls but it was only gradually that I sorted them out and got to know them. Ianamu Is the native teacher and has a wife named Maela in six children of whom I saw Josia, Michael, Rowena and a baby boy. Tavara is married to Oege And there are eight girls on the mission- Betty, Loega, Amoa, Urea, Elsie, Logo (pronounced Longo), Miriam and Lucy. The boys are Nole, Ronnie, Roy, Leonard, Makeko, Matthaio, Punch, Tapua, Sydney, Loea, Joseph, Moses and Owari. A day on the mission begins at 5:30 with the first streak of dawn. The girls into little boys sleep on the back verandah ran as the bell is rung they roll up their blankets and mats and there is a great rustling and noise of sweeping. That veranda is swept several times a day- this is the first. The only brooms in native ones made from cocoa mid ribs, tide together in news without a handle-and very efficient they are. It must be good exercise bending over and using these brooms.\n\nThe elder girls do the work of the house- Malea and Oege Helping with the washing in ironing- the smaller boys and girls sweep around and under the house, girls on one side, boys on the other, and every Friday the schoolchildren sweep the tennis lawn an cricket ground, so there is plenty of sweeping done at Mailu.\n\nThe first week of my stay was a school holiday- the end of three weeks- but ordinarily school is on\n\n26.\n\nMonday, Tuesday and Thursday from 7:00 AM till 9:00 and from 2:30 PM till four.\n\nAfter breakfast at 9:00 there is a roll call and the work of the mission is arranged for the day. The older boys do carpentering, or clearing- chop wood, clean out houses and sometimes weed and plant gardens.\n\nThis time after breakfast is Mrs Savills hospital time. Her hospital is the ground in the shade of the great poinciana tree at the back. The seek from the village assemble there every morning- mothers with their sick babies and people with the sores that are so prevalent. When there is sickness in the village and people are too ill to come Mr and Mrs Saville visit them there, but fortunately there was little sickness during my visit. Ianamu the teacher helps with first aid treatment. He sets the stage by carrying down boxes for the patience to sit on an by having tubs of water and basins entails ready. Then here unlocks the medicine cupboard and carries down what will be needed for stop many are the trials of the hospital under the tree- for a sample, one mother, when I was there, centre message one morning that she could not come because she had lost the bandage Mrs Saville had put around her baby’s head. It appeared she used to take off the bandage as soon as she returned to the village in order to keep it clean for her next visit!\n\nWhen the housework is finished the girls do sewing or basket making and there are always two boys in the kitchen and a boy and a girl to wait at table.\n\nMorning and evening to the food for the mission boys and girls has to be prepared. A boy cooks the boys and a girl the girls. Everything is boiled in the Mailu fashion, formerly in Mailu cooking pot, but now they use kerosene tins for economies sake. Then the food is\n\n27.\n\nDished onto individual plates and they set round on the grass to eat. The chief item is rice- but they have plenty of sago, sweet potato, yam and Taro and everything is flavoured with cocoa nut. At low tides there are shellfish an octopus from the reef and often quantities of fish. The mission supplements what the boys and girls catch by buying from the village people with tobacco. The orange and mango trees on the mission burwell to. Between lunch at 12:30 and school at 2:30 everyone retires for a short rest- then school or work till four when we have afternoon tea. After four o’clock tea the work of the day is done. And there are games on the cricket ground and tennis court. On the ladder we play bowls with cricket balls the bias of being provided by the lawn. The mission boys and girls could beat Mr Seville and me hollow.\n\nDescribing what I saw of Mailu on my first day I failed to mention the birds- their own numbers but one species is a feature of the place. From early morning till evening there merry whistles and liquid song sound on Ogobada of which they seem fonder than of any part of the island. They are birds about the size of a thrush- greenery brown on top and greyish spotted breasts. Their beaks are long enough to suck honey from flowers but they look like insect eaters to. Pairs of them frisk…about the garden, resting high in the Oege, and the Mailu call casuarinas- in sweeping down onto cocaina poms and often to the shrubs and lawn. They love to bath in the shells which are filled every day in placed here and there. Stray fouls from the back lawns come too but the pokios are the most in evidence. Pokio is the Mailu name and is probably onomatopoeic. Scrub fell have been seen in the Bush- one used to come down to be fed with the imported fowls- there are willy\n\n28.\n\nwag tails who love to tease Bindel and the cats- and Hawks in petrels haunt the windy ridges of the Mailu hills- Aginoro behind Ogobada and Etaporo further South. There are deer little vivid blue kingfishers an parakeets another birds in the more bushy parts- wallaby’s no longer live on Mailu – they have been killed out- but iguanas, lizards and snakes are found, and there are rats and domestic pigs and cats. The last named imported and i think hateful. Ogobada Has two cats, both of which have kittens. Maela has a cat- Oege has a cat, the village has about a dozen- so what chance have the poor birds? One only of the Ogobada Cats is pleasant natured, a little tabby kitten with white paws. The others only appeared to be fed but this is a friendly soulful stop a cat is a very insinuating creature when he takes any notice of you.\n\nThe Coral Reef.\n\nI have arrived just in time for some low tides on the reef so after lunch Mr Saville and I set out with the girls to explore the wonders of coral. At this time of year the SE blozan we do not often get the brilliant colouring of the clear days of the popcorn summer but I am lucky to be here at a time when there are low tides on the reef in the daytime. The tides are lowest when the moon is new or at the full so there are big reefs every fortnight, and early afternoon is the best time. In November and December when there is clear calm weather the biggest reefs are at night. I had never imagined coral so beautiful. Once over a weedy stretch of trodden down stuff we found ourselves among pools filled by growing coral. Every shade is there and endless varieties of form. Some shapes alike bushes of sweet Alice, but dozens of hues, mauve, salmon coloured, green- rose- blue- everyone tipped with a lighter shade. There are fine at branching kinds like delicate hates of brilliant purple Ann rose and strong yellow coral that in some seasons has painted the reef gold. Among my favourites are the cabbage-brown and mauve- but i love the carpets of magenta end purple, and the very fine corals that seem more like most to you touch them. Here and there are masses of soft coral- olive green, apple green- old gold- lemon yellow- strange leathery groups that set off the hard forms. Beautiful little fish dart here and there- orange with pale blue bands- one blunt nosed little chap with a yellow tail striped with black- tiny transparent creatures with streaks of emerald and turquoise on their heads-one absolutely glowing jewel of deep ultramarine- but for the most part you don’t see much life on the reef unless you look hard and move the loose stones and poke your hand and arm into very eerie crevices. The Mailu Women go out every Lou tired and decorate the reef or round the island with emu like figures in grass petticoats- each with her basket for carrying the food- they find octopus, sea urchins, sea snakes, crabs, little fish, shells- all tasty morsels to be added to the evening potful stop boys speed fish and shoot them with little bows and arrows and men catch them in Nets and dive off the edge for beche de mer and Pearl shell to sell- but the things that inhabit the reef pools at gathered by the women. They are women’s food too. A man will eat with them but will rather eat a fish every time.\n\nThis first day on the reef walked along to Gailele Gogosa- a point to the South, then back along the beach and through gardens to Ogobada. The flat this side is narrower than elsewhere but nearly all is garden land- sweet potato- tarot- yams and maniota\n\n[new page]\n\n[lino, bound, ‘Back from the gardens approaching Mailu village from the west’]\n\n30. [note page numbers skip 29].\n\nBanana, purple, breadfruit, but the latter an inferior kind. I haven’t mentioned the chief crop cocoa nuts- one of the main items have diet here. A man’s cocoa nuts are his own-everyone has certain trees and when he dies he’s buried beneath him in the nuts placed in rows till his spirit is laid to rest.\n\nOn the path home we passed a pandanus with a thick heavily scented cream flower- and a tree with nobly twisted white trunk- light coloured leaves and fruit like little rose coloured Chinese lanterns hung among them.\n\nApril 21st another low tide in the afternoon so I went on the reef again with the girls- we walked right round the island- turning N round warawara Gogosa- past Mailu village- round Bauro Gogosa, along the next beach to Uruaora And out onto the reef there. That day the whole force of the swell was breaking against it and we had to retreat. I suggested turning back but gradually gathered it would be quicker to go on! So we went along the soft sand under the leaning poms and I was surprised to recognise the next point as Gailele Gogosa. There are four points on Mailu and for beaches- all are white except the one just round Gailele from Ogobada. Here the sand is deep yellow and brings exclamations from the children whenever they jump down onto it from the rocks. All the beaches are strewn with broken shells and driftwood from which women gather nearly all their firewood apart from ko nut husks and palm front ends and often great logs are washed up big enough to make smoke news or to split into house planks. The walk around Mailu is about 3 miles palm zan grassland hills on one side, reef and sea on the other. [This was edited out: There are four white shell strewn beaches in for rocky headlands each distinctive in form] Sunlight and shadow full strongly\n\n[new page]\n\n[lino print, bound, Laruoro]\n\n31.\n\nOn the ridges that rise in land from each point to two high hills. Agiuoro just beind Ogobada and Etaporo between Gailele and Uruaoro.\n\nWe go to a coral island into the mainland.\n\nApril 22nd Still the calm hold so we decided to visit the Irwin’s at Mogubo. In bright sunshine we crossed to Laruoro, one of the two coral islands about four miles from Mailu and about 1.5 from Mogubo. Having passed through the passage between Laruoro and Loupomu Reefs and round to the northern side of the island we went ashore in the dinghy and all Laruoro came through the palm sat along the beach to greet us. The villages nearly built in the houses look fresher than other villages. Laruoro Two were once driven away E in a war with the Mailu, and when they return to broad back eastern culture with them. The peaks of their houses jut out over the street and are elaborately decorated with hanging shells and palm leaves. From the eaves project carved birds an the front thatch is in a pattern of varying shade. On the beach was a newly tide up canoe with mast just stepped. A big Milau canoe consists of two dugouts on which strakes are fastened to give more freeboard. Cross poles between the two dugouts keep them apart and support the deck onto which are let to stone fireplaces. The master is stepped onto the larger dugout and is a young tree complete with roots the letter lashed to the polls. There is a small deck near the mast from which the sail is hoisted- the halyards passing through a hole in the top of the mast. There was no sale on the canoe but I have seen others beautifully made of stripes of plaited matting and claw shaped. To the sail and rigging a tide distinctive flags Python perhaps strips of coconut leaves cut different lengths and thicknesses for different canoes. The writer is a long piece of wood with a hole into which\n\n32.\n\nThis steering pole is fixed. When a Mailu canoe goes about ship the mainsheet is let go- the rudder unshipped and taken forward- Guy is converted into the main sheet and the old mainsheet becomes the guy. We returned to the dinghy by a path through a palm Grove and were in Mogubo shortly after. The Irwin’s were delightfully hospitable. We had lunch and walked down to the copper sheds and through part of the plantation. I rather hoped to see the bullimecows they had but they were invisible. They are Indian cattle with humps on their backs. Bullimecow is Pigeon English I find- I thought it was a new kind of cattle. In the afternoon we came home- quite a fair passage.\n\nApril 23rd\n\nSpent the morning letter writing for the popcorn chief will soon be back from samurai. As we sat having afternoon tea on the lawn under the Oeges, there was a cry of Laurabada and soon the governor’s boat was anchored off the reef. Mr Saville went out in the dinghy and returned with H.E., Mr Leonard Murray, his secretary an doctor strong. There visit was the only one from white people while I was at Mailu. H.E. Is a great friend to the native peoples and likes them with their hair long after the original fashion, so the crew of the Laurabada we’re very picturesque with their outstanding friz [sic].\n\nIn the evening we had games on the back verandah with the mission boys and girls. The tides are low now after dark, and the coast is bright with the coconut torches of the women out on the reefs. I should not fancy bare feet among the coral pools in the dark but Mailu women do not seem to mind. It is a pretty sight to see the torches come flaring round Wara-wara Gogosa, and the lights on the mainland reefs and on Laruoro and Loupomu look like towns lit by electric light.\n\nApril 24th. Sunday. My first Sunday – churches at 9:00 AM- soon after\n\n33.\n\nBreakfast. All the mission children gather on the veranda and the village people troop around to the church. When the bell is rung the mission girls and boys stand in lines. The girls have skirts and blouses and the boys the white rami’s for the day. They marched down to the church and we’ve followed in a few moments. Inside the church it is pleasantly cool under the thatch. The timber of the walls and the roof is stained brown, overhead one can see to the thatch and the walls are of fibro- cement with a brown dado. The floor is cement and there are a few forms but most of the congregation set on the floor- women on one side than men on the other. They are graded in size is- the smallest in front, though the babies of course stay behind with their mothers who sits near the door so that they can slip out if a child cries. Ianamu Takes the service alternate Sundays so this day there was a chair for Mr Saville in the aisle near the men. The mission girls sit on forms near the side door an we had two chairs beside them. The service is all in Mailu of course and the people very attentive. I was amused to say the very small fry in front kept in order by the still minute people behind them. The little girls tie an untie their top layer of grass petticoat but are wonderfully good. Everyone’s hair is wet and brushed for the occasion. Some Mailu People have quite straight hair, but the majority have black frizzy curls- men and women both cut short, but standing out quite a distance round their heads. The hymns are sung unaccompanied- the mission girls forming a kind of choir but Mr and Mrs Saville start them all.\n\nAfter afternoon tea on Sundays Mrs Saville visits the sick in the village. Fortunately just now there are none but we walked round with all the mission girls and the members of the Bible class going home. Bindel comes\n\n[new page]\n\n[lino print, bound, A Mailu house]\n\n34.\n\nOn these Sunday afternoon walks and takes great pleasure in making the girls in grass petticoats run along the beach. Mailu’s Main road runs between Ogobada and the village- just a much trodden track in the sand and in and out the poms. It is about 10 minutes walk but soft sand makes slow going. The path round Wara Wara Gogosa is supposed to be kept firm with stones and earth but the tides play havoc with it. Wra wara Gogosa Is a jutting rock topped by a single famished Oege and a very windblown pandanus. Between the rock and the slope which rises raise up fashion to Agiuoro there is a deep end through this runs the path. In 1606 Torres landed on Ogobada beach. His ship must have come along from the east through Raven passage, which is the very choppy piece of water between Mailu and double rock, an islet off the mainland. If so they saw the big village built to conform to the Crescent of the Bay. Ogobada Beach is an easy landing place for boats with a SE wind, which is what they probably had, and the Portuguese came ashore unmolested. They advanced through the break in Wara wara Gogosa but when met with a shower of Spears. Forthwith they knelt down and fired on the natives in the name of the father, son and Holy Ghost. Many Mailu were killed and the invaders stormed the village and carried off boys and girls. There is apparently no legend of this first unhappy visit of white men to Mailu.\n\nMailu Consists of 62 houses roofed with sago thatch- a golden fawn and soft grey in fine weather and dark brown when it rains. A ridgepole runs from front and rear projecting slightly at both ends- higher in front and with a dip in the middle. The roof comes well down each side almost to the first platform. The front and back are thatched too and there is a second platform reached by a ladder. This upper room is completely\n\n[new page]\n\n[lino print, bound, Mailu village from Baurogogosa Etaporo Agiuoro]\n\n36.\n\nBaurogogosa is a mass of tumbled rocks- high brown cliffs and patches of coral debris- white among the brown and grey conglomerate. Most of Maillu Seems conglomerate- it is obviously volcanic. As we came round to the point the southeast caught us full in the face and we stood a long time watching the great rollers come thundering in. Then back along the beach past the village again. Little groups were sitting everywhere round fires of cko nut husks-they seemed to feel the air cold.\n\nApril 25th\n\nschool today from 7 till 9:00 AM. I wandered on Ogobada beach- enjoying the sunshine and shadow on its steep slope- the clear water lapping gently against it and debris of shells among the driftwood. During the morning the P.C Came on her way back to Port Moresby. It is a lively scene when she stops at Mailu. She drifts about just off the reef here at Ogobada in the canoes from the village in the mission cluster round her. Then she twists her turned up nose away from us and is off again. There is always plenty of time to be ready for her for there is a cry of sale- oh an hour and a half before she arrives. Sometimes too, she goes to Mogubo first in has copra to load there.\n\nApril 26th\n\nWashing day when Bindel is bathed in the soap suds- all the morning he is very affectionate- reminding one, as Mrs Saville says- he hates being washed.\n\nIn the evening we saw a flare at Kurere so expected the Dimuga people to come the next day. They are popcorns in the inland districts here. Mr Saville\n\n37.\n\nHas been up among their mountains and is great friends with them but there is no teacher among them yet. 30 years ago they were headhunters and harried by fear to constant warfare but now of course times are fairly peaceful. Last year there was a raid and nine people of 1 village were killed but it caused not a war but a police raid under Mr Flint. The Dimuga People told Mr Saville that when the Sinebada from Sydney came they would come to Mailu and dance for her so it was with excited anticipation I watched the mission boys respond with a blaze on Ogobada beach.\n\nApril 27th The Dimuga.\n\nDirectly after breakfast the doba set off for Borebo to the accompaniment of blasts on the horn. The water was deep blue flecked with white under a fresh W Leeland breeze. Before noon the little launch was back very full of hill people- about 30 in all, including men and boys, an old woman, 2 girls and a married woman with a baby in a net slung from her forehead. The westerly had dropped in the sea became a pale glassy blue streaked with darker shades and near the shore apple green over the shallow sandy channels between the transparent purple of the reef.\n\nVisitors came ashore in the dinghy and canoes and presently came up to the back veranda to greet us. They are a different type to the Mailu rice. The nose on the whole more prominent, hooked, and the hair blacker and more frizzy. 30 years ago they were absolutely untouched as far as missionary work is concerned but are a gentle an tractable people. Many of the younger men and boys had never been to Mailu before and certainly never travelled on a launch. The leaders of the party were an old man named Naua and a young one named Gabamu, the letter in charge of the mission\n\n38.\n\nPlantation on the mainland. At odd moments during the day I learned the curious history of old Naua whose name interpreted means “reef”. In Mailu it is Lagaru and so he is often called when on a visit here. As a young man he would frequently come in from his hill village to the mission station, then situated at mill port harbour. He was always friendly and would bring gifts for Sinebada. While Mr and Mrs Saville were away on short furlough in Sydney, however, their house was broken into and burgled. On their return the cutlery had disappeared, cushions were ripped open, apparently from curiosity, and their photograph was gone from its place on the wall. They had grave suspicions of Naua and though they never openly accused him are certain that he was the leader of a number of men in the burglary. One day as Mr Saville was sitting on the verandah, Naua nearby on one of his visits, the government launched came up the harbour and Mr Saville pointing to it said- “Naua that is the government launch- may give you till it leaves this place to go into the hills an bring back all the knives there which belong to the mission.” Naua at once departed and shortly returned with nearly all the missing cutlery. The photograph, however, never turned up, for before committing the theft, the first action of the savages had doubtless been to knock it down and destroy it. A picture or shadow of a person is to their minds a part of the person himself. To the burglars their portraits were in actual fact Mr and Mrs Seville looking down at them. If it had been left on the wall untouched they would have known each of the culprits for they would have seen them. A striking evidence of this belief was afforded during a recent visit to the mainland village. While a moving picture of native life was showing, a woman in the audience stood up and asked if she might\n\n39.\n\nGo up to the picture- she had recognised a man in it as her brother who had died not long before. The film was stopped and the woman went right up to it. She stroked the figure all over- talk to it, wailed over it. To her it must have been some manifestation of her brother’s spirit or even a real part of him as a living person.\n\nTo return to Naua, He has been ever since a firm friend of Mr and Mrs Saville and finally became a Christian. There in lead people trade with Mailu but seldom speak the language- using one or two of their number as interpreters. Naua and Gabamu Where the interpreters of our visitors and Naua by far the more talkative in Mailu. He also acted as master of ceremonies doing a fair share of the performance but egging on the others enthusiastically.\n\nAfter coming to greet us the hill people had a midday meal after which they took possession of the workshop as a green room. When we had finished lunch we paid them a visit so that we could see the toilets in process of makeup. It was dark in the workshop, for there are few windows, the main source of light being a large door at one end, and this they had closed. Only streaks of sunlight filtered through the cracks. It was not too dark, however, to see the groups of men sitting on strips of bark on the sandy floor. They were in all stages of dress- the younger ones practically ready, the older ones still adjusting their headdress or their ceremonial clothing- the evari- a strip of bark beautifully white, often fringed and decorated with stripes of yellow. The bark is that of a kind of paper Mulberry. A piece of branch or trunk of the required length is cut off made wet and beaten till the bark swells and may be stripped off. The resulting tubular piece of material is flat and worn double. On first examining an\n\n40.\n\nEvari I was intrigued that I could find no seam- the explanation of course being that given above. The bark when prepared is beautifully white and has a silky texture. The evari On our visitors were died in stripes- the dye used being a two barice route which the native choose. When his mouth is full of the yellow dye he bites along a fold of the cloth thus producing a stripe. I saw some of the roots wrapped in banana leaves. Two evari where of a greyish colour and died in more pretentious patterns of brick read. We were informed that they came from the West. The evari Is often fringed after being decorated with yellow stripes, and the fringe sometimes crinkled- smaller pieces of cloth are threaded through their arm bands and hang gracefully to a length of two or three feet. Important items of the dances dress a belt and I’m, leg, and headbands of fine plait- black with intricate patterns in yellow. The black is from the root of creeping ferns, the yellow from orchid root. Many natives wear arm bands on ordinary dress but on this occasion we saw a great variety of decorate if plaits. The headbands were worn flat but at least one stood out like a Saints Halo. Into them are woven three or four rows of white cowries. The most elaborate decoration for the head is made of rows of bird-of-paradise feathers-the long delicate red plumes with an orange tinge which hang from the wings. They are fixed to a strip of plaiting in tide at the back under the where is frizzy black hair. Stuck in the hair on top of the head and projecting out of the waving paradise plumes several had ornaments made of brilliant red, blue and orange feathers. The feathers are gathered from red parakeets and from the red and blue parrot- the female of the green parrot. Nowhere did I see a sign of the male’s brilliant green plumage.\n\n41\n\nthough one would gave thought its vivid colouring would have appealed to the natives.\n\nSome feather ornaments are about 15 to 18 inches long and are in the shape of a rod for about 8 inches- then more a frill or cup shaped decoration, then more rod, another cup and finally a number of plumes a few inches in length.\n\nOver the plain band to whcih the paradise feathers are attached, or beneath it, the dancers wore varying decorations- strips of plait ornamented with white cowries or with finally cut pieces of white shell- a piece of bright yellow orchd plaited into black. One or two head dresses dispensed with the birds of paradise feathers and consisted of a coronet of red parrot feathers or of those of the briallnt yellow and red parrakeet. The wearers of these showed more of their black curls in front. Naua had a most beautiful headdress of the last named feathers, and flowing down his back some of the most beautiful of the bird of paradise plumes, held in shape by bands of plait in intricate patterns- one having small pieces of shell plaited in and another larger pieces- both sizes cut marvellously evenly and placed regularly round the plait at close intervals.\n\nAll the men had pierced ears- some pierced noses. In the ears were worn hibiscus flowers and earrings and in the noses shaped peices of shell- some white, some orange. Round their necks were wonderful strings of cut shell- threaded through their centres, and as even as rows of pearl buttons- they were mostly made of mother of pearl, and the linkeness to manufactured buttons was deceiving till closely examined. To the necklace would be affixed a large white shell or two boars’ tusks to be bitten in moments of excitement.\n\nIn armbands and belts were stuck plumes of\n\n42\n\nCassowary- some black comma some brown comma and additional plumes were made of young shredded coconut palm leaves- brilliant apple green with yellow near the midrib. These also were many of them crinkled. Fringes of the same leaf finally crinkled hung from their elbows and knees. For extra colour some had added bunches of bright red crouton leaves. Two of the dances were ropes of cuscus fur threaded on twine dangling from their belts the evari. Coming out over the fur but the latter hanging beneath it and around their sides. The effect was decidedly savage. From the workshop the dancers issued dramatically at a signal that we we’re ready to watch. They came from the southern end on the cricket ground, through the shadows of the tall casuarinas into the brilliant sunlight. In the first dance- the GADIDI, the dancers came in a single file, knees bent, heads forward but well up- keeping time to the beat of rods of bamboo knocked alternatively against the inside of the thigh in the palm of the hand. About 8 dancers took part, led by an old man carrying the ceremonial string bag and gord over his left shoulder and holding a club of Blackwood with carved star shaped head full stop he never altered his stately tread however animated became the prances of the dancers. At the side of the line a girl in grass petticoats with hibiscus in her hair advanced slowly with the crab like motion of the women’s dance step. The faces of these men were all painted with charcoal mixed with oil-the black lines thrown into relief by rows of white spots made with lime about the size of small cowries and perhaps representing shells. The predominating colour in the decoration was yellow- orange coronets of feathers- yellow green palm Lees- yellow stripes on the E VARI. One boy had a beautiful head dress of strips of plate decorated with shells- surmounted by a crown of parrot\n\n43\n\nFeathers- and stuck in his hair behind one ear the grey blue Crest of the gaur a pigeon (bibim Mailu) behind the other three beautiful cobalt blue plumes with white ends which came, we were told, from a small bird in the hills.\n\nThe Gadidi Dance step is a kind of two step with a hop on the foot on which the weight is placed- this fits in exact time to the varying tones of alternate thigh in hand against the end of the drum. Forward and back the line of warriors moves with a snake like motion. In a second movement the same step is repeated in a circle to the company meant of song as well as drums.\n\nThe Dauge followed- warriors resplendent in paradise feathers and plumes of cassowary. The drums for this dance are of wood carved, handling all, from one piece. The drum is made narrower in the centre and is about two feet long and six or seven inches in diameter- over one end is stretched iguana skin which is struck with the palm of the hand to mark time or with the fingers in quick succession as a sign to make ready or bring a dance to a close. The handle is over the narrow apart at the centre, running lengthwise, and from the opposite side hang rattles of empty shells of the carau not. The same shelves are fastened as rattles to the dancers ankles. The dancers performed several figures- 1-A double line knees bent holding their drums advancing by low leaps singing and accompanying song and faced by the two dancers in cuscus fur with drums held high and leaping backwards- in a second figure the dancers formed align all facing front, drums low, knees bent, and leaping both feet at one time but apart while the two cuscus where is skipped up and down beating their drums above their heads. A third figure, similar steps and song but more intricate movements I cannot recall.\n\n44\n\nThe thrilling notes of the warriors voices form a fitting accompaniment to this dance which is performed at feasts the whole length of a village St, but is primarily a war dance. Mr Saville has seen it performed in earnest by warriors visiting another village and not on the best of terms. Every man was hidden beneath a shield and the leader carried 6 Spears. That Dauge came into the village like a Roman tortoise beneath its Shields- a yell, and warriors rushed in from the sheltering bush- defenders appeared from the houses and there was a hand to hand fight on the beach. Mr civilan his companion tried to distract their attention by taking photographs-but failing stood between the opposing parties and threatened to report them to the government. The result was peace.\n\nAfter the Dauge the dancers acted the dog and the kangaroo, to taking the main parts and the rest acting the huntsman. Every movement and sounds, the shouts of the Huntsman and the barking of the dog is in time to the beat of the drums. The dance takes approximately the same form every time- varied slightly at the will of the actors. The dog hunts everywhere for the kangaroo among the grass-then is hot on the scent- kangaroo jumping with much vigour at first but gradually wearying- the Huntsman catch up and surround their quarry with shouts of exultation- but kangaroo breaks through and comes leaping forward- dog close on his heels, the warriors behind in a crescent. At last kangaroo is rundown and slain.\n\nThe gara what war dance they did in various forms- 2 lines of warriors and two others leaping up and down the lions Spearing each other through the row of dancers- crossing over the lines twice and spearing in dumb show at each end. The same step is done in circle form- the dances in the centre, one crouched, the other towering\n\n45\n\nAbove him. The first performers then appeared again and danced several figures borrowed from TUPIA village on the northeast coast. One of the most striking of the TUPI dancers was one in which all the dancers skip in two lines continually parting in joining again at the rear- something in the style of one movement in Sir Roger D Coverley. Women took part in this but not approving of their dancing two of the men borrowed grass petticoats from the Mailu audience and demonstrated the correct swing of the skirt. They also performed amao or dirgy sung by women over enemy skulls at a feast after a massacre- and showed us how news is called from hill village to hill village by men with strong lungs- a long call- then a sentence ending on a high note.\n\nFor each of these items came loud applause from the mission boys and girls and the audience who had come trooping along gradually from Mailu. The slanting afternoon sunlight let the dark figures under the trees- the glistening dancers with their brilliant finery- the green grass and the background of palms and tall dark casuarinas. The sound of drums and of deep voices in chorus were gusts of sound on the calm afternoon air. Towards sunset the dancers began to sit around on the grass and Naua brought his flute and played us a Dimuga love song- a gentle breeze of music but very thrilling and penetrating. He sat cross legged beside us and we bent our ears to catch the rippling minor notes but in the clear air of the hills I am told the sounds carry very far.\n\nThe sun went down and we parted. Dimuga, Mailu End English, to our evening meal, each looking forward to the pictures promised for our entertainment after dark. By 7:00 PM we were gathered again. The schoolhouse was packed as we well knew when the roof almost rose to the\n\n46\n\nshouts of applause. The small Pathe projector through a picture about 3X4 feet and the light was provided by an electric bulb supplied by a Dynamo turned by one of the boys or rather several in turn.\n\nMany of the Dimuga People had never seen moving pictures before. It is not etiquette to express astonishment but the shouting became positively terrific. Hula and Port Moresby, Films taken by Mr Saville, where followed by London! Close-ups of traffic, of crowds, of changing the God at Buckingham Palace brought the loudest shouts and next in favour were boats on the Thames and ships passing under London Bridge- we returned to New Guinea scenes and finished with two comic pictures- children at a picnic and one of Charlie Chaplin’s efforts. From the laughter an exclamations one would judge the audience I appreciated the jokes. Most of the people came from Nunemai.\n\nApril 28th\n\nThe Dimuga bade us farewell in the morning. Naua Came first and presented me with a dress of the Mulberry bark striped with yellow. It was a large one so we asked politely for a smaller which was immediately forthcoming. We shook hands with Naua and Bagamu and the rest said Aion from the ground below the verandah. As a final treat they came through the house with many exclamations of pleasure and astonishment at the revelation of Taubada’s home.\n\nApril 29th Life at Mailu\n\nno school on Fridays so we seized the opportunity of a fairly low tide in the afternoon and took a picnic of five o’clock tea to Baurogogosa. The wind was too terrific where the view is best- looking SE, so we sheltered in the village side near a little Grove of mangroves.\n\nAprril 30th The village girls came and played their native\n\n47\n\ngames on the lawn in the afternoon and some stayed till the evening when we had more games on the veranda by gaslight- skinning the snake for the boys- all the native games- including CUSCUS&GORU me done by boys with terrific vigour.\n\nMay 1st the first Sunday in the month is collection Sunday- a little bag is passed round then all the women go out and come back carrying pots. A pot is worth about 3d. And one comes from each woman. The deacons stand to receive them and place them on the raised dais near the pulpit.\n\nMay 2nd – 5th we spent fairly quietly- on Wednesday we had another picnic to Baurogogosa and Mr. Saville and I went there again on Thursday after school and so pots being baked on the beach- they are baked only for about 20 minutes at the outside -KK and friends are used and bent inwards to form a kind of funnel. The heat is terrific.\n\nMay 6th Low tide- took photos on the reef and walked round Gai LELE and over the break in the hills near ETA PORO. The hills are beautiful here- especially in the evening light and one looks down on the valley of the water hole covered with chia nuts and trees. We walked down through LA LAN G to the water- just a depression filled with dirty looking water- which never runs dry However many Kia not bottles are filled at it. Every drop of fresh water is carried by the women from here to the village- a fair distance- over 1/4 of a mile anyway. Once the government asked Mailu if they would like a pump for there is good water to be got near the village. They seemed willing an it was Julian stored by Mr Saville. The well was a splendid one and a tenth of the distance to the water hole. But custom was too strong and the pump fell into disrepair from lack of use.\n\n48\n\nFinally the government took it away again.\n\nMay 7th Another picnic to Bauro gogosa.\n\nMay 8th Sunday again. Went into some houses in the village in the afternoon. The insides are very Smokey and dark but most interesting- or the floorboards of the upper room are carved on the sides which formed the ceiling of the lower room-crocodile and snakes, tortoises, the crinkled KKR nut leaf are some of the designs we saw.\n\nI love the Nets the men make- beautiful string S a KOA. There are very fine Nets and quite coarse ones with every size in between. The floats are of a light wood and sinkers of white shells- mostly cockle shells which tinkle pleasantly as the net swings over a man’s shoulder on the way to a fishing ground. Cooking pots of various sizes, each with a pattern on the outside rim and a smaller on the inner are kept in the house is. The patterns are traditional and all have names- one of the most striking is Nogara-i-da-leilei the clouds standing in line on the western horizon. When does not see the weapons and dance treasures of the people- they must be hidden away. There are spare petticoats hanging here and there and I saw a ring of banana leaves which I found was a pone for supporting the pot when it is being made. The pots are all when shape those sizes vary and some women get a better shape than others. The clay is brought to the village and stones and gets squeezed out by the fingers- then fillets of it are rolled between the hands and on a base of half a coconut shell the woman wines the fillets one on top of the other till the pot is the required size. She moulds it to shape and decorates it with a sharp shell and finally bakes it.\n\nThere is no sign of the canoes coming back yet- every prayer meeting the people pray for their return.\n\n[new page]\n\nLino print, bound into the journal with and additional, same print, loose leaf. The image has the viewer looking down the “street” of the village. Note that Mander-Jones dated it as Jan 1933 Titled “Western end of Mailu village’\n\n49\n\nThere are a few men in the village- two or three old men- one deaf- one called Iari- very ancient- another called Manu who has bina (the hornbill) tattooed on him to show he has killed a man. Then there is Bunava younger and the leader in dealings with the mission. He is a true gentleman. A man with his leg off just below the knee came back on the same P.C. myself from Port Moresby. His name is Kena- he had a terrible open sore on his foot for years. Mrs Saville had treated it and it seems to be clearing up again and again only to break out a fresh. He lived in a little palm leaf shelter slowly rotting away. He was like this for months but at last consented to go into port and have his leg off. Now he can get about on a stick, set on a canoe, and fish, and live in the village. He ought to be grateful to the mission through whose influence he was sent to hospital. The mission boys have made him a pair of crutches but he doesn’t seem to like them. Since coming home he has been all around the villages- getting food for showing off his leg. Mr Saville says Velavi and Tieta add two quite young men left in the village. The former is a queer character. He insisted on being married in the church some years ago and now wants another wife as he has no children. As usual Mr and Mrs Saville supposed to solve the problem. Tieta Is the policeman. The women have a busy time providing for their families. It is a lean time when the men are away. Every day they set off for their gardens and if there is a reef go out again all the afternoon poking about in the pools. They are very talkative and sound positively angry sometimes but are marvellously friendly and kind to one another. The children are many of them Pretty Little things and have such curly heads.\n\n50\n\nWe are now having just now what the Mailu call biga sama or low tide in the morning so are planning a trip to the mainland to-morrow if it looks good weather.\n\nWe go up the Oraoro\n\nMay 9th the whole household was up before 5. 30 and packed into the dab by 6.30. Several canoes and boatloads were required as we took eight girls and 10 boys and all their sleeping mats, pillows in drugs. The girls laughed when Mr Saville told them to be sure and remember 3 pillows for each of them. He also amused me by describing their nervousness boarding the dinghy from the beach- they all have bare feet and skirts knee length but not even a toe must touch the water! This was a slight exaggeration but it is certainly funny to see them dance back from the waves and to hear them laugh-they have a propensity for giggling. Besides the girls and boys and their gear there was a large roll of rugs, pillows and sheets for the three of us in case we should sleep at Kurere- a handbag age, and a huge Taco basket with enough food for a week in case the southeast should blow up and we could not get back.\n\nPoor Bindle was left behind, much against his will. He sailed out on one canoe- came back and made valiant efforts to get into the dinghy with us. It was no good taking him as he is always a nuisance on the mail and- he will rush off and fight the village dogs and when it is time to leave is nowhere to be found, then has to be brought along in a special canoe. So he was held by the hair by Maela Ann watched us waving goodbye with reproachful eyes. Maela told us afterwards he spent the day and night up at the empty house and would eat hardly anything.\n\nTo set off we had a perfect morning- clear sky and sea-mirror calm. Across the water the rising\n\n51.\n\nSun lit up Laruoro and Lopomu and caught the wooded sides of the hills near the coast. Rolls of mist lay in the valleys and surged gradually up the distant blue mountain slopes. Once out of the shelter of Mailu we felt the ocean swell but after a quick passage to Laruoro were soon inside the coral reefs. Before 7.30 we were landing at Mogubo- Mr. Irwin waving from the beach and wondering how many more boat loads of human beings the Daba was going to produce. He said she much be elastic below the waterline.\n\nWe were calling at Mogubo to see if Debby Irwin could join us for the day and found her thrilled to go up the river- Mrs. Irwin pressed us to return to Mogubo for the night so we left the Daba in the safe anchorage there and walked along the beach to Kurere carrying only our picnic lunch. Three boys were left to look after the Daba but we still had 15 pairs of hands so transport was easy in spite of the addition of a bag of raice borrowed from Mr. Irwin, for in the rush the girls and boys food had been forgotten. The mainland beaches opposite here are black sand, pleasantly hard to walk on though the surf is small for there are reefs all along the coast. The two miles to Kuere were sweltering hot and the shade of the busy when we cut across a point very grateful. Thermos tea went well too on the verandah of the teacher’s house where Boo and his wife and 2 small boys received us with smiles and handshakes. We had doubted if we would be able to get canoes to take us up the river to Oraorro but found Book has seen us coming and had arranged for canoes at Orebeuru. Kurere has a branch of the river on one side and the sea on the other- the spit of land runs for two miles to Woworo where it becomes a little broader- Ade, the mouth of the river is a short distance beyond and on the river band as you go in from Woworo\n\n52.\n\nIs Orebeuru where Oraoro begins to wind inland through country of the same name. Higher up, the river is called Indara by the Dimuga people but the plantation is only 5 or 6 miles up and we were still in Oraoro.\n\nThe mainland villages are stockaded to keep in the pigs at night and keep out the crocodiles which are plentiful on all rivers. Boo had seen and heard of numbers recently on the Oraoro but not on flopped in from the bank as we paddled up. It was too late in the morning- the women had preceded us going to their gardens so the crocodiles were already frightened off. They eat fish, pigs and quite frequently humans- and are anything from 10 to 15 feet long. We passed a placed where Mr Saville once got a lucky shot at a 13 footer- the thing fell dead on the spot and the natives with him rushed up and danced with triumph on its back. Usually a shot even though fatal leaves a crocodile strength to leap into the water and vanish- appearing later washed up in some bend of the river.\n\nWe were so stewed during our walk deom Mogubo that we got Boo to rake up two more canoes to take us to Orebeuru and regretted we had only a small umbrella and no sunshade- a large umbrella we had foolishly left at Mogyo, and two little boys were sent back to ask Mrs Irwin for it. Before they left they were drilled in the word umbrella and could say it perfectly but the two mile run must have shaken it out of their heads for they could say nothing to Mrs. Irwin that she could understand but “Mailu” and “Sinebada”. A boy from the launch was brought and got the umbrella off the verandah for our little messengers who ran back to Kurere and passed it to a relay to Woworo relay finally overtaking us a couple of miles up the river.\n\nBy nine o’clock we were boarding the Kurere canoes 8 girls and boys and some packages on one- 8 of us\n\n53.\n\nAnd the rest of the picnic on another and two boys walking Orebeuru. Our canoe was in bad repair- water logged outrigger, deck and dugout badly tied- with our weight it had about ½ an inch freeboard. The worst of sitting gingerly on a dugout is that one’s legs go fast asleep and refuse to bear one’s weight when dry land is at last there to step upon. The little cross bars on the dugout are also very uncomfortable to sit on and Mrs. Saville and I insisted on sitting on the edge of the rickety deck in spite of the water logged outrigger. Our two boys and two girls paddled gently and we followed the shade of the mangroves on the winding stream but even so were out in the sunshine for a great part of the 40 or 50 minutes. On this branch of the river there was little to be seen but mangroves and glimpses of blue mountains occasionally. Here and there creepers overhung the trees but they were in seed not flower. The long bean pods Mr. Saville said were those of the D’Albertis which hands in scarlet curtains along the bank on springtime. It must be a beautiful scene with the red flowers reflected in the still water. There are two other varieties of D’Albertis- blue and white, but in this district only the red is seen. The seeds of the mangroves are interesting. They hang perpendicularly downward and the radicale sprouts while the seed is still attached to the branch. When it drops the radicle is ready to take root in the mud. A seed will float in a perpendicular position till the tide falls and enables the radicle to reach the bottom. The aerial mangrove roots sometimes shoot out from the stem at a surprising height above the water- I saw some 15 to 20 feet long.\n\nWe were glad to see Orebeuru and a fine large canoe to which we transferred forthwith. It was great\n\n54.\n\nTo have several inches freeboard and to be able to sit on deck with more room for one’s legs. The Oraoro is 30 or 40 feet wide and a few feet deep. It flows swiftly and we soon came to fresh water but the stream remained muddy for the 5 miles we travelled. On either side the banks slope steeply for 4 feet in places, for 15 to 20 in others, showing where the water rises after heavy rain. The vegetation is dense and thought the natives have made gardens all along the banks since the mission started its plantation, trees and palms are still abundant. Breadfruit trees stand out in the bush with their serrated foliage and so do cocoanut palms and a beautiful palm more like a giant fern, but there are many varieties of tall trees- soft woods and hard woods- Papua is rich in timber. Wild cotton with its yellow hibiscus flowers overhung the water and there were several other flowering shrubs. From the bark of the wild cotton the natives make their rope- it is wonderfully strong and when fresh- very clean looking.\n\nThe Oraoro is picturesque little river winding in and out among the foothills of the mountains and narrowing considerably as we got higher up. There was plenty to ook at- always some new tree or flower- quaint fish that hop out and up the banks- solider crabs with one claw brilliant scarlet and nearly as big as the crab itself and turned over their backs, so that they could attack while in retreat apparently. One could only take a glance at these things however for the sun was beating down with great strength and gale. We longs for our extra umbrella- even dark glasses did not keep our eyes and necks from aching. Some men on the bank cut fronds for us- banana and nipa palm. Their grateful shade shut out the view but was cool and green. When the Woworo boys overtook us with the umbrella I put it up on\n\n55.\n\nTop of the banana leaves!\n\nOur paddlers raced each other and did not seem to feel the sun on their bare heads. In one place the smaller canoe made a trip across country and got well adhered arriving at the platnation a half hour before us.\n\nWe were up there too by twelve and heard the conch sounding to call the people to greet us. Lagaru came and one ro two others and then we had lunch in the shade, sitting on mats on the long green grass. The flies are bad up the river but we were ravenous and devoured the food before they had a chance. After eating we set off with Lagaru to have a look at the plantation. Mr Saville was distressed to see it overgrown but clearing is hopeless with the few hands the mission can afford- they have as much as they can do to keep the paths open, collect and smash the nuts and send the copra to Mogubo to be smoked. Clearing on a plantation on the fertile river bank is a different proposition to the flats by the sea shore. From a scenic point of view the vegetation is very beautiful- creeping ferns, orchids stag horns climb the palms, and wild passionfriot- masses of shrubs and grass- the giant leaved taro, are everywhere. I specially noticed a shrub with racemes of orange pea shaped flowers which the natives use to cure skin diseases.\n\nWalking through the plantation we came to Lagaru’s house and a bend in the river with the Oraoro village on the opposite bank. Thunder was crashing in the iron stone country to the north and the sky very overcast so we turned back and embarked for the return journey.\n\nTravelling downstream we had the current with us and made quick progress so we drew in to the left hand bank so that I could see a sago swamp. Mrs. Saville stayed with some boys and girls on the canoe but the rest of us scrambled up ten or twelve feet of very slippery mud and\n\n56.\n\nPlunged into a path through dense shrubs and trees. On the edge were beautiful grasses- some tufted and resembling papas- and a tree with sprays of delicate mauve pink flowers- and inside were tall tree trunks, palms wound round with creeping ferns and masses of ferns on either side of the path. We soon crossed a line of short poles which had been used in pulling out a canoe. A picture sprang before one’s eyes "
