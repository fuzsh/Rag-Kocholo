The CHA comes off the celiac axis, gives off the GDA to become the PHA which then bifurcates into the RHA and LHA. Note the MHA (the slender branch arising from left hepatic artery as seen in 1B) arising from LHA. CHA: Common hepatic artery; GDA: Gastroduodenal artery; PHA: Proper hepatic artery; RHA: Right hepatic artery; LHA: Left hepatic artery; MHA: Middle hepatic artery."
