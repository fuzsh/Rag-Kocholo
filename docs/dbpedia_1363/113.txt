Summary:

Andrea Ferro is most well known as one of two lead vocalists for the band Lacuna Coil. In 1994 Ferro, along with Marco Coti Zelati, formed the band Sleep of Right. They soon began recruiting people to join, one of whom was Cristina Scabbia, Ferro's fellow vocalist in the band. They then changed their name to Ethereal, signed to Century Media and afterwards changed their name to Lacuna Coil after finding out that the former was already taken by a Greek band. Since then they have gone on to grow exponentially in popularity.

Ferro’s vocal style hasn't changed very much over time, with the only noticeable difference being the early disappearance and relatively recent reappearance of his death growl/distortion technique. Early on in Lacuna Coil's career he would use this technique fairly often, however he stopped doing so quite early on and has only started using this technique again somewhat recently. For a large portion of the band's lifetime so far, he has focused mainly on a cleaner style of vocals. His lower range is strong enough for his placement, however it is very underused. His mid and high range is where he spends most of his time, favouring chest voice over any other technique, though he has displayed on a couple of occasions a capable falsetto. Ferro's vocals are an essential part of Lacuna Coil's sound, and along with Cristina Scabbia, he is part of a powerful vocal duo that front a band who are quite a prominent part of the metal scene.
