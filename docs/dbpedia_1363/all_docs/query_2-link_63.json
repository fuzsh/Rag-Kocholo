        "text": "(Milan, Italy – May 14, 2021) – Italian metal giants LACUNA COIL recently announced the release of their new live album, Live From The Apocalypse, to be released on June 25th. Today, the band have dropped the live version of “Apocalypse”, originally released on the latest studio album Black Anima, which is available to purchase and stream on all digital platforms. Watch the video for “Apocalypse” from the Live From The Apocalypse bonus DVD, HERE.\n\n“Looking at the sand gliding down through the hourglass... ‘Apocalypse’ is factual and actual in today’s pandemic, though, we couldn’t foresee this when we wrote it: the separation, the solitude, the confusion, the resilience. We keep on fighting for our will to survive,” states Cristina Scabbia about “Apocalypse”.\n\nAndrea Ferro adds, \"Apocalypse is usually a huge concept involving destruction or damage and the way the world ends. In our vision, there’s no big apocalypse just endless little ones. Ignorance, complacency, selfishness alone can bring apocalypse.\"\n\nLive From The Apocalypse is the fruit of an unprecedented time. Unlike previous live efforts the Italians, under the yoke of the pandemic, cleverly devised a way for their devoted fan base to hear and see them on stage by organizing a special live stream event performing their latest album, Black Anima, in its entirety this past September 2020. This very special show will now be released digitally and physically (vinyl and CD). The physical album formats come with a bonus DVD featuring the footage of the original live stream.\n\nLive From The Apocalypse will be available in the following formats and can be pre – ordered, HERE\n\n- Ltd. CD+DVD Digipak\n\n- Gatefold 2LP+DVD & LP Booklet\n\n- Digital album\n\nThe vinyl version will be available in the following colors and limitations:\n\n- Black vinyl, unlimited\n\n- Neon yellow, limited to 300 copies worldwide, available at CMDistro EU\n\n- Red vinyl, limited to 200 copies worldwide, only available at EMP\n\n- White vinyl, limited to 300 copies worldwide, only available at the band’s official store\n\n- Silver vinyl, limited to 300 copies worldwide, only available at Century Media US\n\n- Transp. Orange vinyl, limited to 300 copies worldwide, only available at Revolver\n\n1. Anima Nera\n\n2. Sword Of Anger\n\n3. Save Me\n\n4. Now Or Never\n\n5. Reckless\n\n6. Through The Flames\n\n7. Apocalypse\n\n8. Black Feathers\n\n9. Under The Surface\n\n10. The End Is All I Can See\n\n11. Veneficium\n\n12. Black Dried Up Heart\n\n13. Bad Things\n\n14. Layers Of Time\n\n15. Black Anima\n\n16. Save Me (Apocalypse Version)\n\nBy all accounts, this was no ordinary gig. Even though LACUNA COIL were in their hometown of Milan—at the famed Alcatraz Club—there were no fans to greet them. No roar of anticipation; No claps of adulation; No interaction with the people who had become deeply involved in and had a profound love for LACUNA COIL’s music and live shows over two-plus decades. The live stream energy was different. It had to be. With hearts on their sleeves, cameras rolling, and the world tuning in online, LACUNA COIL brought “Black Anima: Live from the Apocalypse” to life."
