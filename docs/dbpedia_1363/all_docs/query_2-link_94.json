        "text": "Related Articles\n\nItalian metal giants LACUNA COIL just recently announced the release of a new live album, entitled “Live From The Apocalypse”, to be released on June 25th.\n\nAs of now the live version of “Apocalypse”, originally released on the latest studio album “Black Anima”, is available on all digital platforms! You can watch the video to “Apocalypse” taken from the bonus DVD, above.\n\n“Looking at the sand gliding down through the hourglass…\n\n‘Apocalypse’ is factual and actual in today’s pandemic, though we couldn’t foresee this when we wrote it: the separation, the solitude, the confusion, the resilience. We keep on fighting for our will to survive.“ – Cristina Scabbia\n\n“Apocalypse is usually a huge concept involving destruction or damage and the way the world ends. In our vision, there’s no big apocalypse just endless little ones. Ignorance, complacency, selfishness alone can bring apocalypse.” – Andrea Ferro\n\n“Live From The Apocalypse” is the fruit of an unprecedented time. Unlike previous live efforts the Italians, under the yoke of the pandemic, cleverly devised a way for their devoted fan base to hear and see them on stage by organising a special live stream event performing their latest album, “Black Anima” in its entirety, in September 2020. This very special show will now be released on vinyl and CD as well as a digital album. The physical album formats come with a bonus DVD featuring the footage of the original live stream.\n\n“Live From The Apocalypse” will be available in the following formats and can be pre-ordered here: https://lacunacoil.lnk.to/LiveFromTheApocalypseID\n\nCD+DVD Digipak\n\nGatefold 2LP+DVD & LP Booklet\n\nDigital album\n\nThe vinyl version will be available in the following colors and limitations:\n\nBlack vinyl, unlimited\n\nNeon yellow, limited to 300 copies worldwide, available at CMDistro EU\n\nRed vinyl, limited to 200 copies worldwide, only available at EMP\n\nWhite vinyl, limited to 300 copies worldwide, only available at the band’s official store\n\nSilver vinyl, limited to 300 copies worldwide, only available at Century Media US\n\nOrange vinyl, limited to 300 copies worldwide, only available at Revolver\n\nTrack-list “Live From The Apocalypse”\n\nAnima Nera\n\nSword Of Anger\n\nSave Me\n\nNow Or Never\n\nReckless\n\nThrough The Flames\n\nApocalypse\n\nBlack Feathers\n\nUnder The Surface\n\nThe End Is All I Can See\n\nVeneficium\n\nBlack Dried Up Heart\n\nBad Things\n\nLayers Of Time\n\nBlack Anima\n\nSave Me (Apocalypse Version)\n\nBy all accounts, this was no ordinary gig. Even though LACUNA COIL were in their hometown of Milan—at the famed Alcatraz Club—there were no fans to greet them. No roar of anticipation; No claps of adulation; No interaction with the people who had become deeply involved in and had a profound love for LACUNA COIL’s music and live shows over two-plus decades. The live stream energy was different. It had to be. With hearts on their sleeves, cameras rolling, and the world tuning in online, LACUNA COIL brought “Black Anima: Live from the Apocalypse” to life.\n\n“On one hand, it felt awkward to play for a huge empty room,” tells vocalist Andrea Ferro. “ But, on the other hand, it felt great to finally reconnect with our fans at home and with the people working behind the scenes. A lot of people enjoyed the show—it was definitely a one-off event loaded with a lot of emotions and feelings. Live from the Apocalypse is an opportunity to offer a new release to our fans while the COVID-19 crisis is still a real thing, affecting them and us. The live album represents a unique moment in our career (and life) that will be forever remembered as that one time when we literally ‘rose from the Apocalypse.’”\n\nAlso don’t miss the pre-order for “HORNS UP!”, LACUNA COIL’s very own tabletop (or better yet, concert floor!) party game in pure rock style. The game itself takes place at a LACUNA COIL show, where each player must fight his or her way to be the first to reach the stage. There will obviously be many “friendship-threatening” actions challenging the opponents. LACUNA COIL band members will be an active presence in the game: they are depicted on the Stage Cards, and each of these will have consequences on the whole audience! You can pre-order your copy HERE.\n\nThe pre-order campaign is live worldwide and as the number of requested copies rises, the project will become more developed, with new events and new expansions. Shipping Worldwide from November 2021.\n\nLACUNA COIL:\n\nCristina Scabbia – Vocals\n\nAndrea Ferro – Vocals\n\nMarco “Maki” Coti-Zelati – Guitars, Bass Guitar, Keyboards & Synths\n\nDiego “DD” Cavallotti – Guitars\n\nRichard Meiz – Drums"
