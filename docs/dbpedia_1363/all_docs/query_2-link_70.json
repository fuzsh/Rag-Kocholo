In this process, developing a skillset is as important as nurturing a constructive approach to learning, where the students feel reassured and motivated to pursue their own aspirations. This is true for any age or level.\n\nAndrea is fluent in rock, funk/r’n’b, jazz, pop, blues and americana, and has developed well-tested curricula on many topics of interest including guitar style analysis, instrument proficiency, applied harmony and improvisation, reading, music theory, harmonic analysis, session guitar work and recording.\n\nAndrea provides personalized lesson plans that are tailored to the learner’s needs, choosing from a wealth of teaching materials, and fine-tuning them to each student’s very own preferences and taste.\n\nLessons can be booked in-person or online. All ages and levels welcomed.\n\nFor rates and general inquiries, please fill in the contact form."
