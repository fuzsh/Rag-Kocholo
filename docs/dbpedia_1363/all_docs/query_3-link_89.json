        "text": "published on 2022-12-17T19:33:34Z\n\nOn this FM Punk Interview, I had Andrea Ferro, screamer in chief of Italian metal powerhouse Lacuna Coil, drop by to talk about the 20th anniversary of their classic album Comalies! An album that truly represents the peak of gothic metal as a genre! We talk about the recording and themes of the original album, we talk about the new re-recording of the album the band put out, we talk about some of the album's soundtrack appearances, the roots of Lacuna Coil and what the band is looking forward to in the future! This one is definitely a showstopper! Tune in to FM Punk on 90.3 WHPC every Thursday from 10pm-12am EST! Also available on the iheartradio app, tunein, Audacy, the WHPC app and smart speakers!\n\nGenre\n\nHardcore Radio"
