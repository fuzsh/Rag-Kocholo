        "text": "Italian Goth metal legends Lacuna Coil are proud to unleash a new single “Hosting The Shadow” on the world. After their successful collaboration with Ash Costello of New Years Day on their latest single “In The Mean Time“, the new track “Hosting The Shadow” comes with none other than Randy Blythe from the mighty Lamb of God.\n\nListen to “Hosting the Shadow” (feat. Randy Blythe) here: https://lacunacoil.lnk.to/HostingtheShadow-Single\n\nLacuna Coil comments about the new single and collaboration with Randy: “‘Hosting The Shadow’ is a trip through light and dark, where silence reveals its hidden secrets. Obscure moments can become occasions to evolve, to learn to master one’s own shadow – which is crucial in order to prevail. Randy Blythe did an incredible job on this track, we absolutely adore his voice and his evil laugh! Our admiration for him is infinite and to have him as a guest on this song is a dream come true. Partnering with a friend you respect immensely, that also kicks ass on stages around the world: it doesn’t get any better than this. We’re looking forward to the day we can perform ‘Hosting The Shadow’ live together!“\n\nThe appreciation for the collaboration is more than mutual. Randy Blythe adds: “I was super excited when Lacuna Coil asked me to sing on a song with them – not only am I a big fan of their music, they are truly beautiful souls who have been like family to me for 20 years now. We’ve played shows together all over the world, and I’ve always wanted to jump onstage and sing with them – I can’t wait until it actually happens with ‘Hosting the Shadow’!”\n\nFollowing their features with Ash Costello and Randy Blythe, Lacuna Coil will head out to the UK & Ireland this October, with special guests and friends Blind Channel from Finland.

The band is renowned for their distinctive blend of heavy metal, gothic rock, and symphonic elements, characterized by dual vocal harmonies between co-lead vocalists Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro. The band gained international recognition with their third album, Comalies, released in 2002, which featured hit singles like “Heaven’s a Lie” and “Swamped.” This album marked their breakthrough in the United States and helped them secure a dedicated fan base worldwide. Over the years, Lacuna Coil has released several successful albums, including Karmacode (2006), Shallow Life (2009), Dark Adrenaline (2012), and Black Anima (2019).\n\nKnown for their dynamic live performances and strong stage presence, Lacuna Coil has toured extensively, sharing stages with prominent bands in the metal scene and performing at major music festivals around the globe. Today the band consists of Cristina Scabbia (vocals), Andrea Ferro (vocals), Marco Coti Zelati (Bass, Guitar, Synths), and Richard Meiz (Drums).\n\nLacuna Coil online:\n\nhttp://www.lacunacoil.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lacunacoil\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lacunacoilofficial\n\nItalian metal legends Lacuna Coil have announced their return to the states next year, with a special West Coast tour – featuring The Birthday Massacre, Blind Channel, and Edge of Paradise as openers. This trek follows the successful East Coast run in fall 2022 with Butcher Babies, Uncured, and Lions At The Gate, in support of Lacuna Coil‘s recent Comalies XX release.\n\nCristina Scabbia (vocals) comments: “USA Coilers! We are so thrilled to announce that we’ll be heading your way again in 2023. We can’t wait to perform for you, and we’ll not be alone – we’ll bring along our special guests Birthday Massacre, Blind Channel and Edge of Paradise to the party!

Available as a Ltd. Deluxe 2CD Artbook, 2CD Jewelcase, Ltd. Gatefold 2LP+2CD & LP-Booklet and digital album, Comalies XX is an entirely deconstructed and remade re-recording of Lacuna Coil‘s third full-length album, Comalies (2002). Featuring the original songs from the classic record, plus new versions of the 13 tracks, Comalies XX has the same energy and drama as 20 years ago, but is dressed for 2022 and ready to win over old fans, as well as new fans, alike.\n\nPurchase and stream Comalies XX now at: https://LacunaCoil.lnk.to/ComaliesXX\n\nItalian gothic metal giants Lacuna Coil went on quick September North American tour to commemorate anticipated October 14th re-release of their breakthrough third studio album Comalies and will be called Comalies XX. Release will be with reimagined material, from which many songs are already being played at this tour. Band is joined on this tour by Butcher Babies, Uncured and Lions At The Gate. Thirteen date tour stopped for two nights in New York City’s The Gramercy Theatre on September 17th and 18th.\n\nWritten by Andris Jansons\n\nJust before Lacuna Coil took the stage, it was Butcher Babies turn to dazzle the crowd. To put their performance in short description it was a real Rock’n’Roll party! Heidi Shepherd and Carla Harvey got the crowd going wild. They know how to put up the show. Their on-stage chemistry is impeccable as both frontwomen are founders of the band. As a sort of to emphasize this they performed the song Best Friend (originally written and performed by Saweetie) while on stage acknowledging their friendship bond. While the band have released to date three studio albums, they are working on a new material, and during the show people were invited for the new music video shoot the next day in New Jersey.\n\nSee full Butcher Babies photo gallery here.\n\nFor me Lacuna Coil set was somewhat a trip back in time as band had set the stage in their traditional dark red background and wore their black “uniforms”, just as they did when I saw them the last time three years ago. Another unsurprising matter was the usual harmony between Cristina Scabbia melodic singing and Andrea Ferro aggressiveness to complete that signature Lacuna Coil feel. Marco, Diego and Richard had their signature face paint. One of my favorite moments was when Richard came on stage and stared right into my camera lens allowing to capture that up and close image you see in the accompanying photo gallery.\n\nSee full Lacuna Coil photo gallery here.\n\nBand started set with five fan faves before giving a glimpse into the reworked material. Apcalypse, Layers Of Time and Reckless represented their last studio album Black Anima, which was also most played during this set with addition of Now or Never, Sword Of Anger and Veneficium. The Comalies XX introduction started with Tight Rope XX and Heaven’s A Lie XX. Tigh Rope XX is already released as a single. Both songs felt both ways, as something old you liked and as something new. Well, I guess that is the definition of a rewritten song, though what I mean is that It did not struck as let’s say covers of different bands. Heaven’s a Lie was more darker with more aggressive Andrea vocals. While I love the original, I was completely ok with remake. Soon enough you will be able to make your own judgement, as October 14th nears or you can still catch band on tour to hear these songs. Other two from Comalies XX on this set were Daylight Dancer XX and Swamped XX.\n\nRemaining dates:\n\nSep. 21 – King Of Clubs – Columbus, OH\n\nSep. 22 – Crofoor Ballroom – Pontiac, MI\n\nSep. 23 – The Forge – Joliet, IL\n\nComalies XXwill be performed live in its entirety on October 15th at Milano’s Fabrique Club for a special event to mark the release of the album and the 20th anniversary of the original version. Tickets are available, HERE.\n\nAustralia:\n\nDec. 2 – Good Things Festival – Melbourne (AUS)\n\nDec. 3 – Good Things Festival – Sydney (AUS)\n\nDec. 4 – Good Things Festival – Brisbane (AUS)\n\nItalian metal legends LACUNA COIL announce the release of Comalies XX, which is set for release on October 14th via Century Media Records. To celebrate the announcement, the band have just dropped their new single and video for “Tight Rope XX” today. Watch the video, which was directed by Trilathera, below:\n\nComalies XX is not just a re-recording, but an entire deconstructed and remade version of their third full-length record, Comalies, which was originally published in 2002. Now, 20 years later, this undeniably anthemic Millennial classic in a new guise – produced by Marco Coti Zelati & mixed by Marco Barusso – will be available as Ltd. Deluxe 2CD Artbook, 2CD Jewelcase, Ltd. Gatefold 2LP+2CD & LP-Booklet and digital album, featuring the original and new versions of the 13 tracks. Pre-orders of Comalies XX started last Friday.

To celebrate the 20th anniversary of ‘Comalies’, we felt this special album deserved more than a remastering. We didn’t just give it a new dress, we built a new skeleton and gave it new skin and a new life. ‘Comalies XX’ is alive and walks alone, this is not a remake or a reboot, it’s ‘Comalies’ on steroids! ‘Tight Rope XX’ and its video are just a taste of what’s coming, and we couldn’t be more proud,” states LACUNA COIL about the album and single “Tight Rope XX”.\n\nComalies XXwill be performed live in its entirety on October 15th at Milano’s Fabrique Club for a special event to mark the release of the album and the 20th anniversary of the original version.
