        "text": "Italian metal giants Lacuna Coil recently announced the release of their new live album, Live From The Apocalypse, to be released on June 25th.\n\nAlso Read: Rammstein Released MUTTER 20 Years Ago Now\n\nToday, the band dropped the live version of “Apocalypse”, originally released on the latest studio album Black Anima, which is available to purchase and also stream on all digital platforms. Watch the video for “Apocalypse” from the Live From The Apocalypse bonus DVD below.\n\n“Looking at the sand gliding down through the hourglass… ‘Apocalypse’ is factual and actual in today’s pandemic, though, we couldn’t foresee this when we wrote it: the separation, the solitude, the confusion, the resilience. We keep on fighting for our will to survive,” states Cristina Scabbia about “Apocalypse”.\n\nAndrea Ferro adds, “Apocalypse is usually a huge concept involving destruction or damage and the way the world ends. In our vision, there’s no big apocalypse just endless little ones. Ignorance, complacency, selfishness alone can bring apocalypse.”\n\nLive From The Apocalypse is the fruit of an unprecedented time. Unlike previous live efforts the Italians, under the yoke of the pandemic, cleverly devised a way for their devoted fan base to hear and also see them on stage by organizing a special live stream event performing their latest album, Black Anima, in its entirety this past September 2020. This very special show will now be released digitally and also physically (vinyl and CD). The physical album formats also come with a bonus DVD featuring the footage of the original live stream.\n\nAlso Read: Video: Ice Nine Kills Celebrate 45th Anniversary of JAWS with Mini-Documentary & Special Merch Drop\n\nLive From The Apocalypse can also be pre – ordered, HERE.\n\nThe vinyl version will be available in the following colors and limitations:\n\nBlack vinyl, unlimited\n\nNeon yellow, limited to 300 copies worldwide, available at CMDistro EU\n\nRed vinyl, limited to 200 copies worldwide, only available at EMP\n\nWhite vinyl, limited to 300 copies worldwide, only available at the band’s official store\n\nSilver vinyl, also limited to 300 copies worldwide, only available at Century Media US\n\nTransp. Orange vinyl, limited to 300 copies worldwide, also only available at Revolver\n\nLive From The Apocalypse Tracklisting:\n\nAnima Nera\n\nSword Of Anger\n\nSave Me\n\nNow Or Never\n\nReckless\n\nThrough The Flames\n\nApocalypse\n\nBlack Feathers\n\nUnder The Surface\n\nThe End Is All I Can See\n\nVeneficium\n\nBlack Dried Up Heart\n\nBad Things\n\nLayers Of Time\n\nBlack Anima\n\nSave Me (Apocalypse Version)\n\nLacuna Coil is Cristina Scabbia (vocals), Andrea Ferro (vocals), Marco “Maki” Coti-Zelati (guitars, bass guitar, keyboards & synths), Diego “DD” Cavallotti (guitars), and also Richard Meiz (drums).\n\nAre you also a fan of Lacuna Coil?
