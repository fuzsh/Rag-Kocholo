        "text": "Interview by ERIN EDDY\n\nGothic metal veterans Lacuna Coil are approaching a milestone, the 20th anniversary of their acclaimed album, Comalies. To mark the occasion, they returned to the studio to give the record a total facelift, to give it a 2022 identity and a new title, Comalies XX.\n\nWith privilege, I sat down with vocalist Andrea Ferro to discuss the band’s motivation and approach to re-recording such a classic album.\n\n“One idea could have been just to re-master the record,” Andrea begins, “but we thought for such an iconic record, maybe it wasn’t enough, so we decided instead to try to re-work it, deconstruct it and bring it into 2022.”\n\nThe band were careful to inject newness into the songs without deviating too far from their original states, with slight tempo changes being made, some melody alterations and perhaps more interestingly, the feel of the songs being adapted to reflect the times we’re currently living. Even the album art symbolises the change of times. You may remember the vibrant sunflower that graced the cover of 2002’s Comalies, whereas Comalies XX is a fairly colourless depiction of a dead flower, devoid of petals.\n\nFans have been given a taste of what the “XX” versions of the songs are bringing to the table, as Andrea explained they have recently begun performing them live. Several singles have also been released, creating a real buzz around just how exquisite these already beautiful songs are now sounding.\n\nLacuna Coil are also heading to Australia in December as part of the Good Things line up. This will be their first visit to our country in six years, and they are genuinely excited to be returning.\n\n“To finally be able to be there after cancelling the tour before Covid; it’s going to be great just to be there and back to doing what we love,” Andrea smiles. He also alluded to a headlining tour being on the cards in the future. “We’re working on something,” he says, somewhat mysteriously, “hopefully we’re going to be able to announce it as soon as possible.”\n\nFor a deeper dive into the work behind the incredible re-release that is Comalies XX and what to expect when Lacuna Coil hit the stage at Good Things, check out my interview with Andrea.\n\nBecome acquainted with the breathtaking Comalies all over again in her “re-dressed” XX form when it is released on October 14."
