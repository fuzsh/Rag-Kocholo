        "text": "Lacuna Coil is currently on their 20th year together as a band. They have been a dominant force in the gothic metal and the godfathers of Italian metal. The band released ‘Delirium’ in 2016 their 8th studio album, which was a concept album of sorts. Lacuna Coil just wrapped up a co-headlining tour with Epica and we happened to see them on that tour (see review here) and then we also had the opportunity to witness the band again at this years Louder Than Life Festival in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nWe had the opportunity to speak with co-vocalist Andrea Ferro prior to the bands performance at Louder Than Life. We spoke about the 20 year anniversary of the band, their upcoming book which will be released commemorating their 2 decades of dominance, their cinematic video for “You Love Me, Cause I Hate You”, staying in a monastery and their upcoming 20th Anniversary show in London on January 19th which will also be filmed for an upcoming dvd release."
