        "text": "I must say, it’s getting on my nerves to see people constantly say that Andrea needs to leave Lacuna Coil due to the fact that these people simply don’t like his voice.\n\nNow, I don’t care if you don’t like his vocals. If his voice doesn’t appeal to you, that’s your opinion you’re entitled to. That’s fine by me. However, saying he should leave the band just because YOU don’t like him is a rather dick thing to say.\n\nWanting him to leave just so you can like the band is absolutely moronic.\n\n\"Yeah, but his voice is so terrible! No one likes him in the band!\"\n\nSo you’re saying those over 11 thousand likes on his Facebook page aren’t actual likes? *rolls eyes* Lots of people don’t like Nickelback but they have over 18 million likes on their Facebook page(I’m not a fan of Nickelback, by the way). They’ve managed to get full venues.\n\nThere are people who genuinely like Anette Olzon(ex-Nightwish, replaced Tarja Turunen), Kristen May(Flyleaf, replaced Lacey Sturm) and Mariangela Demurtas(Tristania, replaced Vibeke Stene) despite the enormous amount of backlash they have received.\n\nThere are people who genuinely like Andrea’s voice. Just because something gets a lot of hatred and dislike doesn’t mean that’s the universal opinion.\n\n\"Yeah, but his terrible voice holds them back from all this success they could have!\"\n\nThey’ve released 7 studio albums, 2 EPs, have toured all over the globe, were nominated for an MTV Europe Music Award as well as a Revolver Golden Gods Award and won a Female Metal Voices Fest Award for best album.\n\nIn A Reverie got a 4/5 rating from AllMusic and got an 8/10 rating from Metal Storm.\n\nUnleashed Memories got a 3/5 rating from AllMusic, got a 4/5 rating fromSputnikmusic and got a 9/10 rating from Metal Storm.\n\nComalies got 4/5 from AllMusic, 8/10 from Chronicles of Chaos and 8.5/10 from Rock Hard.\n\nKarmacode got 9.5/10 from AllMusic and About.com, 4/5 from Answers, 5/5 from Musical Discoveries and 7/10 from Popmatters.\n\nShallow Life didn’t really do that well, having gotten 2.5/5 from AllMusic, 3/5 from Kerrang!, Popmatters, Sputnikmusic and Alternative Press, 6/10 fromMetal Hammer, and 8/10 from Rock Sound.\n\nDark Adrenaline got 4/5 from AllMusic, About.com and Loudwire, 8.5/10 fromBlabbermouth and 3.5/5 from Sputnikmusic.\n\nObviously, not every Lacuna Coil album was a major hit but they have had successful albums.\n\nThey have also headlined/co-headlined several festivals.\n\nNow, you were saying?\n\n\"He looks ugly!\"\n\nCome back when you have a less shallow argument.\n\n\"I just don’t like him!\"\n\nWell, as I said before, that is an opinion you are 100% entitled to. But why should he have to leave the band just because you don’t like him? If you don’t like him, don’t listen to Lacuna Coil. It’s that simple. No one is obligated to listen to any band. You can discontinue to listen to a band at any time, free of charge. You are not legally bound to this band.\n\n\"But I like Cristina!\"\n\nWell, then you’ll just have to put up with him.\n\n\"But I don’t like him!\"\n\nWell, it’s one or the other. You can either put up with his vocals or just not listen to them at all. I’ll leave the choice up to you.\n\n\"But that’s gonna be a hard choice to make!\"\n\nA hard choice to make?\n\nA hard choice is seeing a little girl and puppy playing on a set of train tracks that connects to another set of tracks where a woman is walking with her baby. Uh-oh, spaghetti-Os! A giant train is coming at full-speed and you spot a railroad switch. But there’s only two tracks. What do you do? Either the little girl and her puppy die or the woman and her baby die.\n\nTHAT is a hard choice to make.\n\nTrying to decide whether or not to listen to a band is one of the simplest decisions you can make so quit your complaining. Deciding to listen or not listen to a band does not have an impact on your life or your ability to obtain your basic needs in the slightest.\n\nOver and out."
