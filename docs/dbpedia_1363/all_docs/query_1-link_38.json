        "text": "PITTSBURGH — The “Music as a Weapon” tour returns Tuesday to Pittsburgh with a hard-rocking vengeance. With past lineups including Drowning Pool and Flyleaf, it is not a shock that the tour’s artist arsenal has expanded further.\n\nThis year, the main stage will feature four headliners, accompanied by a second stage with a rotating roster. Each stop also boasts famed tattoo artists such as Oliver Peck and Vic Back, as well as an outdoor Vendor Village.\n\nNear the beginning of the series’ snaking path across America, Lacuna Coil singer Andrea Ferro, a Milan, Italy native, had much to share about the band’s road experience and the sunny prospects of their latest release.\n\nQ: “Shallow Life,” your latest full-length album, debuted this week. Group dynamics often change over a band’s lifespan; how was the band’s chemistry in the studio this time?\n\nA: It was pretty relaxed. It was our first time recording in the USA; we had our own apartment and car in Hollywood, and the beautiful weather made it a good atmosphere. Instead of freezing during autumn in Italy, we got to wear flip-flops every day.\n\nQ: Can you describe the album’s creative progression from previous Lacuna Coil records?\n\nA: Musically speaking, it’s just a step in the band’s evolution from a European Goth idea to an international rock sound. The album is catchier, each song’s structure is more mature, and the listener can recognize that we’re headed in a rock direction.\n\nQ: “Spellbound” is the first single and it helped the band earn the distinction of being a “Myspace Featured Artist.” On the band’s own Myspace is a function to allow fans to vote for the second single; which one do you think they will select?\n\nA: I suppose we will find out. That’s interesting because if you break it down, there will be a different single chosen by each different radius of listeners. We want to attract new listeners and retain old ones, so it can’t be a song that will really shock anyone.\n\nQ: That’s understandable. Right now you’re on the “Music as a Weapon” tour, and Lacuna Coil has frequented both concert halls and festival circuits. Which setting do you feel better suits your music?\n\nA: While festivals carry such a great energy and promotion opportunity, a smaller venue provides direct contact. The production and sound of a smaller place make it quite intimate, and we really enjoy that.\n\nQ: This isn’t the first time you’ve traveled with these bands; for example, you played Ozzfest in 2006 with Disturbed. What is it like to be reunited with old tour mates?\n\nA: It’s such a friendly atmosphere, there is surely no ice breaking needed. We already know each other and that is so helpful when getting through long tours. We eat, drink, reminisce, and play some table soccer together also.\n\nQ: Table soccer is good for combating homesickness? That’s a new one. I’m guessing you’re all AC Milan fans?\n\nA: Yes! We watch the Italian soccer league via satellite as much as we can, especially while we’re traveling. It’s something from home we have with us here, and it’s on our TV whenever we get spare time to watch it.\n\n“MUSIC AS A WEAPON IV” TOUR\n\n• Bands: Disturbed, Lacuna Coil, Chimaira, Killswitch Engage.\n\n• When: 2 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n• Where: Petersen Events Center, Oakland.\n\n• Tickets: $37.75."
