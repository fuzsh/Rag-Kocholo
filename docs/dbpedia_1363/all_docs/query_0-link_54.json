        "text": "Andrea Bocelli has been bringing his honeyed vocals to fans for 30 years, and he’s celebrating his third decade in the music business with Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration, a three-day event in the 65-year-old tenor’s hometown of Lajatico, Italy.\n\nThe event, which is set to take place July 15, July 17 and July 19 in at Tuscany’s Teatro del Silenzio will feature appearances and performances from Bocelli’s superstar friends including Ed Sheeran, Shania Twain, Jon Batiste, Russell Crowe, Sofia Vergara, David Foster, Christian Nodal, Sofia Carson, Laura Pausini, Tiziano Ferro, Zucchero, Giorgia, Matteo Bocelli and Virginia Bocelli as well as classical stars Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras, Lang Lang, Aida Garifullina, Bryn Terfel, Nadine Sierra and more to be announced.\n\n“As a child, I learned to dream about my future in the enchanted silence of these hills,” Bocelli said in a press statement. “Then life made that dream happen. Today, 30 years later, I can only imagine celebrating my career and my life, its strength, and its wondrous beauty here at Teatro del Silenzio, surrounded by such wonderful artists and friends. I want to thank everyone who helped my childhood dreams come true with an unforgettable concert.”\n\nIn addition, Mercury Studios, Maverick, Impact Productions and CITYSOUND & Events are working together to produce the Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration concert film, which will be directed by Sam Wrench. “You can’t get much more cinematic than Andrea Bocelli against the Tuscan landscape. I’m incredibly excited to bring this once in a lifetime concert to cinemas around the world with his unique voice, this world class team and enviable list of special guests,” Wrench shared."
