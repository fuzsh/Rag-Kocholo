        "text": "I've been having tons of conversations with sales leaders about why deals don't close in the current climate and what gaps exist in their current process. As we all know very well, right now budget is the main detractor on new business flow overall. But that's not a qualified opportunity. Why do we accept a 20-30% win rate on qualified opportunities as good? Why can sales teams book quality meetings, but deals end up slipping quarter to quarter? From my conversations, the vast majority of sales software stacks are heavily tilted towards the prospecting side. Lots of tools (which are typically great and most of the time needed) to help scale outreach, optimize messaging, capture intent, etc. Great for filling pipeline, but the gap in most systems and processes is supporting sellers collaborating with buyers to get deals done on a mutually agreed upon timeline. #sales\n\nReceiving positive customer feedback is always wonderful. However for me, as founder, itâ€™s the type of feedback we get which assures us our mission of always being customer-first is embodied throughout our company, by everyone, in every role. Consistently the feedback we receive centres on two outcomes: 1. Value 2. Support We talk about, live and action these two outcomes every single day. Theyâ€™re our rocks. Itâ€™s so satisfying to know our customers feel it too.\n\nA leader of leaders... the moment you take this responsibility lightly is the moment you fail to see the true potential you have to build dreams into reality. Not just for the companies you work for but the people who work for you.\n\nWhen it comes to testing, I always state my hypothesis as well as a personal opinion. I, honestly, love being proven wrong. A test with any result, good or bad, is always a win in my book. I have made this face quite a few times. Top of mind was a form test showing all fields vs multi-step. In this particular case, the multi-step won. Conv rate actually decreased when all fields were shown on the landing page. Any specific tests come to mind that made you scratch your head? (btw, give Jay a follow. He's an email marketing nerd with great insights and legit sense of humor. I first saw him speak at InBound in Boston this past Sept.) #abtesting #landingpageoptimization\n\nWise words from Manish Khatta, one of many gems from this episode. I especially loved hearing Manish's origins as well as his advice on building your brand including owning your flaws. The episode is well worth a listen, but don't just take my word for it. Use the link in the comments below to see for yourself.\n\nOga President Mr. Tinubu and associates, please this message is quite different from what the demands of the protesters are saying. Some of the things they are asking for are; 1. You recently increased the electricity bill, that bill should cut down by 80% because there is no power supply anywhere. 2. You recently increased fuel price, that fuel price should be cut down by 80% because the fuel subsidy scam is getting us weak and tired. 3. Sell crude to both NOCs and IOCs in Naira so that everyone will enter market to source for our currency the way we are sourcing for Pounds, Dollars and Euros. This one will help make foreign currencies equivalent to Naira.\n\nSometimes, letting the engineering team speak to the real problems can motivate the client towards real solutions. This whole notion of sales teams and engineering teams not being on the same page is a problem that I continually have to solve for companies, when brought in to handle \"system issues\". Sales teams provide feedback for engineers on the customer experience, and defines the fiscal opportunity/risk. Engineering teams provide insights to sales on design decisions, scheduling, known solutions, and should be the metric for a businesses productivity levels. It's very common for sales and engineering teams to not be on the same page, and the worst part of it is the number of companies who are okay keeping these skeletons in the closet - because who wants to take responsibility for the problem when it's you? #engineeringproblems #technicaldebt #brokencode #spaghetti #cicd #mismanagement #guidelines #regulations #procedures #mobileapp #softwaredeveloper"
