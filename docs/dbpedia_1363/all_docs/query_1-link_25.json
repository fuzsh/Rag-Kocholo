        "text": "Andrea Ferro has admitted that LACUNA COIL's most distinct and dominant feature — the dual vocals of Ferro and Cristina Scabbia — did not come naturally upon the band's formation.\n\n\"Especially in the beginning, I would say on the first three records, we [were] struggling to understand where to go exactly with the two voices,\" he told Australia's Heavy in a new interview (hear audio below). \"Because, obviously, Cristina's and my voices are very different and we add completely different things to the music. She can bring a lot more melody and epicness while I can bring more violence or rhythmical parts or more powerful addition to the music, so we needed to work together before we found the right balance. And then nowadays we are very, very balanced, I think, and we know what we can bring to the music — we [understand] exactly where to go with our voices, but, obviously, it took time, because it was something new — both on the record but also in the live show, to find your space and your time and what to do when the other [person] is singing. So, it took time. And then I think we learned it along the way, and now we've been able to develop it really well, I think.\"\n\nThis past summer, Scabbia told mxdwn.com that she and Ferro think of themselves \"as two instruments. We can add to the composition,\" she explained. \"We don't sit down and say, 'Oh, I'm gonna sing more than you do.' Our ultimate goal is to give balance to every song and this happens with what fits perfectly for a song. If it's an atmospheric part, it makes more sense if I sing it. If it's an aggressive part, it makes sense that Andrea does it. You know, that's exactly how you use the bass and guitar. This is what happens with our music. Sometimes he gives ideas of what I'm gonna sing or vice versa. My guess is there is not much ego with the band and that's what kept the band together.\"\n\nAdded Ferro: \"Obviously, we do have completely different voices so what I can do she can't and what she can do I can't. It's also something that we learned early on. We had to find a way to make it work and we had to learn because sometimes the balance wasn't perfect.\"\n\nCristina continued: \"We also think of live shows and how it doesn't really matter who sings what. During the show, we're all gonna have our parts and do our thing.\"\n\nLACUNA COIL's latest album, \"Black Anima\", was released on October 11.\n\nThe deluxe edition of \"Black Anima\" comes with a limited-edition custom deck, created with the help of artist Micah Ulrich.\n\nLast month, LACUNA COIL released an Amazon Original song titled \"Bad Things\"."
