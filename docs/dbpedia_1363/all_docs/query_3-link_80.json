While it may have seemed obvious that I’d want to talk to Cristina the most (I do), I’m also actually very glad that it didn’t happen this time. Andrea was an easy interview to do and it was refreshing to talk to him and hear his perspective.\n\nPardon the loudness of the noise of the Las Vegas Strip. Couldn’t do much about it and the wind. But we made it work!\n\n#AndreaFerro #LacunaCoil #LasVegas #HardRockLive\n\nMarcus Miller\n\nMarcus Miller founded AudioVein Entertainment in April 2015 once he parted ways with another music webzine he helped launch. After many years of establishing personal and professional relationships within the music scene of Las Vegas and Los Angeles, AudioVein was created to provide a very straight forward, but eclectic approach to the music industry; All while showcasing various genres of music, as well as providing a place for unsigned and local artists to shine from any location. With the philosophy that MUSIC should be the focus, and not drama and garbage, Marcus ensures that AudioVein will be the place to come for your music needs."
