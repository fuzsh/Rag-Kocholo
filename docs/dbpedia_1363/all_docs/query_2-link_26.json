        "text": "Karmacode (2006–08)\n\nThe band and label postponed the release of their follow-up to Comalies, Karmacode, to early 2006. According to the band’s website, this made it possible for more time to be spent on production, and to avoid the crowded summer 2005 release schedule for metal albums. On December 23, 2005 the band announced on their web site that all recording, mixing, and mastering on Karmacode had been completed. It was then announced that Karmacode would be released in the United States on April 4, 2006.\n\nDuring their 2005 European Tour, Lacuna Coil debuted two new songs from Karmacode at selected concerts: “Our Truth” and “Fragile” under the working titles “Antonio” and “A2” respectively\n\nKarmacode debuted at number 28 on the Billboard 200. Considered by Billboard to be “the biggest album in the history of Century Media Records”, it was acclaimed by music critics and magazines. Corresponding with the release of the new album, Lacuna Coil toured with Rob Zombie throughout North America in early 2006. After their tour with Zombie, they performed main stage at Ozzfest 2006 along with System of a Down, Ozzy Osbourne, and Hatebreed becoming the first female-fronted band to co-headline the heavy metal festival. That summer they also played on the main stage of the Download Festival (a three-day music festival in England’s Donington Park), which was headlined by Metallica, Tool, and Guns N’ Roses. That December, Lacuna Coil teamed up with In Flames, The Sword and Seemless for a US tour, as well as The Blackest of the Black 2006 Tour.\n\nFour singles were officially released from Karmacode: “Our Truth”, “Closer”, “Within Me”, and a cover of Depeche Mode’s “Enjoy the Silence.” “Our Truth” was the first single released, and had a music video produced for it. The song was featured on the Underworld: Evolution soundtrack and entered the top forty on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart in the United States.\n\nThe band toured extensively to support the album throughout 2007. This included the Jägermeister Music Tour, The Hottest Chicks in Metal Tour 2007 Loudpark Festival ’07 in Saitama City’s Saitama Super Arena, and the Australian leg of Megadeth’s Gigantour.\n\nLacuna Coil’s first live DVD was released in November 2008, entitled Visual Karma (Body, Mind and Soul). The CD/DVD package is a retrospective of all things from the band’s “Karmacode” album cycle. The set list features concerts filmed at Germany’s Wacken Festival and at the Japanese Loudpark Festival in 2007."
