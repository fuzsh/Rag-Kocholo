        "text": "LACUNA COIL singer Andrea Ferro spoke to \"The Jay & Brodie Show\" about the band's plan to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of its debut by playing a very special show, dubbed \"Nothing Stands In Our Way\", on January 19, 2018 at London, England's O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire. The concert will be filmed and recorded for a release later in 2018. Said Andrea (see video below): \"We're gonna celebrate that date. We have a song called '1.19' [on the 2001 album 'Unleashed Memories'] that people really… We never really revealed why this number in the title, so it's been sort of a current question from the fans, asking, 'What does it mean?' And we never revealed it because we wanted to keep that mystery. So we decided to celebrate the twentieth anniversary from the first release on January 19 in London with a special show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire. And there's gonna a lot of surprises — obviously, a career-spanning kind of set with also songs we never played before, songs played in different versions, and a lot more surprises we're gonna announce soon. So it's gonna be a very special event. We're gonna film it for a DVD. So it's gonna be a fun party, to celebrate after all these years.\" Asked why LACUNA COIL chose London as the place to celebrate its twentieth anniversary, Andrea said: \"London has always been sort of our second home. It's always been one of the first places to really embrace our music, and the fans are really good. And it's pretty easy to reach from all over Europe, and also coming from America, it's far, but not that far, compared to other places. So we thought it was a good idea to do it there. It's kind of a symbolic city for us, and we love to play there. All the shows we play in London are usually some of the best of the tour, so we decided to just do it there. Maybe in the future we're gonna do something else also in Italy or maybe somewhere else to celebrate, but that one main show is gonna be in London, for sure.\" Ferro also clarified that LACUNA COIL will not play any brand new material at the London show, explaining that when he said the band would perform \"songs we never played before,\" he meant \"stuff from the past that we never played. Because some of the songs, for one reason or another, they never got played, so we'll pick up a few ones that really the fans love but we never decided to play them live for some reason,\" he said. \"So it was more referring to the past. There's not gonna be any new song from the future, let's say, or anything we're still working on.\" Ferro recently told the Impact metal channel that LACUNA COIL fans will have to wait at least a couple of years for the follow-up to \"Delirium\". LACUNA COIL in December released a new song called \"Naughty Christmas\". \"Delirium\" entered The Billboard 200 chart at position No. 33 with first-week sales of just over 13,000 units — nearly all from pure album sales. The set followed the No. 27-peaking \"Broken Crown Halo\", which also opened with around 13,000 copies back in 2014.\n\nContinue reading..."
