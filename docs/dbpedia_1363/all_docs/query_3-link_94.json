        "text": "Andrea Ferro of Lacuna Coil Names His Favorite Metal Albums of All Time\n\n2017-10-12\n\nAndrea Ferro and Anne Erickson chat about metal at Louder the Life festival\n\nItalian metal band Lacuna Coil is coming up on their 20th anniversary of making melodic metal music that truly soars. With the staying power of Lacuna Coil, who better to talk to about the metal genre than vocalist Andrea Ferro?\n\nSitting down during Louder than Life festival in Louisville, Kentucky, earlier this month, Ferro spoke with Audio Ink Radio about his favorite metal albums of all time.\n\nMetallica, Pantera, Sepultura, Paradise Lost and Type O Negative and Anthrax all made the list. We’re guessing most hardcore metal fans would approve.\n\n“There has to be a Metallica record in there, for sure,” Ferro said. “‘Ride the Lightning,’ or ‘…And Justice for All.’ Also, ‘Vulgar Display of Power’ by Pantera. Sepultura, ‘Chaos A.D.’ Paradise Lost, ‘Icon.’ Type O Negative, ‘Bloody Kisses.’ I’ll give another one, just in case. If it has to be metal, I would say Anthrax, ‘Among the Living.'”\n\nIn other news, Lacuna Coil will remain on the road through the end of 2017 in support of their latest album, “Delirium.” According to Ferro, the group has plans to start writing and recording their next album throughout 2018.\n\nIn January of 2018, the band will play a 20th anniversary show at O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire in London.
