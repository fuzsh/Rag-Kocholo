        "text": "LACUNA COIL fan site EmptySpiral.net recently conducted an interview with the band's male vocalist Andrea Ferro. The third and final part of the chat follows in its entirety:\n\nEmptySpiral.net: Have there been any specific influences that you've drawn on [for the new album, \"Karmacode\"]?\n\nAndrea: \"Maybe for the heavy songs there might be an American influence in the sound because we have toured so much over there that it's impossible to avoid. When I talk about the groove of the songs, that could be more connected to the American sound. I don't want to say nu-metal, because it's not, but you can hear something more in the bigger sound with a lot of groove from the drums and from the bass. That could have been an American influence. But for the atmospheric songs our sound is still very European, something you can't really hear from the States.\"\n\nEmptySpiral.net: It sounds like you're putting together a global album…\n\nAndrea: \"Since we like to play the really heavy songs live, we like to have more heavy songs. 'Heavy' is not totally the right word, when I say heavy you might think we're doing MESHUGGAH, but it's not like that. As you've heard the songs we've played live — there is a lot of groove and we try to push them. It's good what you say about the global aspect, as you'll hear influences from different places. Of course, the violins and the atmospheric parts are more like our tradition compared to the heavy songs. We also used the classical instruments to give a diverse sound, and when we talk about the concept behind the album we talk about an old style of spirituality not only the western civilization kind. It's nice for us to have a lot of different moods for the concept.\"\n\nEmptySpiral.net: You mention that you have fifteen songs recorded. How many do you think will go on the standard release of the album?\n\nAndrea: \"We still have to decide the final number because I think it's also a matter of how long the album has to be. Probably I think between twelve and thirteen.\"\n\nEmptySpiral.net: When do you think the album will be released?\n\nAndrea: \"There is no official date yet. Perhaps March.\"\n\nEmptySpiral.net: Will it be released globally on that date?\n\nAndrea: \"It should be released at the same day everywhere. That is what we would like to have. It is not fair to release it first in America because we sell more there or in Italy because we are from Italy.\"\n\nEmptySpiral.net: Do you think you'll release any singles prior to then?\n\nAndrea: \"This is something we're still discussing. It is almost sure that we're going to have a single I have no idea which song! (laughs). We're also discussing some ideas for a video to release of course before the release of the album. The point is that we still have to mix all the songs before deciding which is going to be a single. When you complete the job it always sounds a little different from what you expect…\"\n\nEmptySpiral.net: Finally, is there anything else you want to tell us about Karmacode?"
