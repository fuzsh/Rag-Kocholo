        "text": "You guys, I am sooo excited to give you this interview from a man that I very much look up to for his passion and dedication to his band and their fans, Mr. Andrea Ferro of Lacuna Coil! I cannot wait to see Lacuna Coil in concert one of these days! They are by far one of my most favorite bands. If you haven’t checked them out DO IT!!!\n\n(Michelle) Mr. Ferro, thank you so very much for taking time to do this. Although I have never had the pleasure of seeing you guys live or meeting you, I’m such a huge fan. How are you today? And how was this most recent leg of your Delirium world tour?\n\nI’M GOOD THANX, YOU SHOULD TRY TO MAKE IT TO THE LIVE SHOW ONE DAY! THE TOUR HAS BEEN A LOT OF FUN AND SINCE WE HAVEN’T PLAYED IN JAPAN, AUSTRALIA AND SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN A WHILE HAS BEEN A PLEASURE TO GO BACK AND MEET OUR PEOPLE OUT THERE! (Believe me, no one wants this more than me LOL I want to meet these guys so bad!)\n\n(Michelle) One of the very first songs that grabbed my attention from Lacuna Coil was “Heaven’s A Lie.” I just love the way yours and Cristina Scabbia’s vocals work together. Are there any songs that you particularly enjoy doing live?\n\nIT’S ALWAYS FUN TO PLAY “HEAVEN’S A LIE” BECAUSE IT’S A FAN FAVORITE AND PEOPLE SING A LONG WITH IT BUT SURELY WE HAVE A BIT MORE FUN PLAYING THE NEW SONGS FROM THE LAST ALBUM.\n\n(Michelle) Who would you say are some of Lacuna Coil’s influences? And yours personally?\n\nIN THE BEGINNING WE WERE A LOT INFLUENCED BY BANDS LIKE PARADISE LOST, TYPE O NEGATIVE, SEPTIC FLESH BUT NOW WE HAVE EVOLVED SO MUCH OUR STYLE AND WE HAVE LISTEN TO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT IT’S HARD TO SAY WHAT INFLUENCE US NOWADAYS SOMETIMES IT’S OLD MUSIC SOMETIMES NEW MUSIC, IT’S A COMBINATION AND VERY OFTEN IT’S UNCONCIOUS AND YOU DON’T EVEN REALIZE IT. THERE ISN’T JUST A BAND OR A SINGER I LOOK UP TO, THERE ARE MANY SONGS AND VIBES THAT I GET FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE.\n\n(Michelle) I’ve only been able to see concert videos on YouTube and such, but your live energy is insane! I love it! With the heavier direction of Delirium, how have your live show track lists changed up?\n\nWE LIKE TO HAVE A MEMORABLE CONCERT EVERY TIME WE HIT THE STAGE SOMETIMES IT’S POSSIBLE SOMETIMES IT ISN’T BUT WE SURELY TRY OUR BEST EVERY NIGHT! THE SONGS OF DELIRIUM ALTHROUGH PRETTY HEAVY FIT REALLY WELL IN THE SET AND WE JUST ADDED THE NEW SONG TO THE CLASSIC LC’S SONGS. SURELY THERE IS A BIT MORE THEATRICAL ASPECT IN OUR LIVE PERFORMANCE. (From what I have seen in videos this is totally true!)\n\n(Michelle) When I first became a fan (earlier this year, I’m very late to the game LOL) I had just lost a dear friend and the band suggested the song “My Spirit” to me. The song is so poignant and powerful. Can you tell me a little of the story behind it?\n\nWE WROTE THE SONG WHEN WE HAD THE TRAGIC NEWS OF THE PASSING OF OUR FRIEND PETE STEELE FROM THE BAND TYPE O NEGATIVE. HE WAS A DEAR FRIEND AND A GREAT MUSICAL INSPIRATION FOR US AND IT WAS JUST SHOCKING TO SEE HIM GONE SO EARLIER IN HIS LIFE. MY SPIRIT HAS DEFINITELY A TYPE O VIBE. (Type O Negative is certainly an amazing band as well, it broke my heart to learn this and My Spirit is such a beautiful song.)\n\n(Michelle) Do you and the rest of the band have any preshow rituals? Like anything to help your mindset?\n\nWE START TO GET READY ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE SHOW, STAGE CLOTHES, MAKE UP A BIT OF STRETCHING AND SOME WARM UP ROUTINES. SOMETIMES A SHOT OF WHISKEY. WE GATHER ALL TOGETHER RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW AND GIVE EACH OTHER A RUSH OF ADRENALINE. (I absolutely LOVE the Delirium stage clothes and makeup it’s so amazing!)\n\n(Michelle) What can fans expect in the coming New Year?\n\nMOSTLY TOURING, THERE ARE STILL MANY PLACES WE HAVEN’T VISITED. THERE WILL ALSO BE A COUPLE OF MUSIC VIDEOS TO BE RELEASED THAT WILL BE SURPRISING. (Ohhh now I’m even more excited! Can’t wait to see what the videos will be)\n\n(Michelle) I ask this on every interview simply because I love the different answers, and it can be more than one thing- If you could rid this world of anything what would it be?\n\nTHERE ARE SO MANY NEGATIVE THINGS WE COULD GET RID OF IN THIS WORLD BUT OVERALL I THINK THAT LIFE HAS TO DO HIS COURSE AND THERE IS NO MAGIC THAT WE CAN DO TO CHANGE IT. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER MAY COME IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE AND PUT OUR BEST EFFORT EVERY DAY TO BE AS GOOD AS WE CAN.\n\n(This- to me, this is the best answer I’ve gotten to this question! Live life to the fullest and be positive every day! Choose to make each day great!)\n\n(Michelle) What are some things you like to do on your time off from touring? Any hobbies?\n\nOBVIOUSLY I LIKE TO ENJOY TIME WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND FOLLOW MY SOCCER TEAM AC MILAN. A BIT OF SPORT AND VIDEO GAMES. I REALLY ENJOY VISITING ART EXPOSITIONS AND FIND OUT ABOUT NEW AND OLD ARTISTS. I ALSO LIKE HISTORY AND TRY NEW FOOD.I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE TIME FOR READING AND PLAYING INSTRUMENTS.\n\n(Michelle) Of all the countries and cities you have toured over the years, do you have a favorite?\n\nTHERE ARE SO MANY NICE PLACES IN THE WORLD AND WE’VE BEEN LUCKY TO VISIT A GOOD NUMBER, ONE OF MY FAVORITE CITIES IN THE WORL IS NEW YORK.\n\n(Michelle) Of all the bands you have toured with, who has been your favorite to work with?\n\nWE’VE ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY LUCKY WITH TOURING COMPANIONS AND MOST OF THE TIMES WE HAD A BLAST! MOONSPELL, TYPE O NEGATIVE, ROB ZOMBIE, DISTURBED, MEGADETH, SEVENDUST ARE AMONGST OUR FAVOURITES SO FAR.\n\n(Michelle) If you could have a jam session with any artist, living or dead, who would that be?\n\nI REALLY DON’T KNOW, THERE ARE MANY ARTISTS THAT I ADMIRE BUT I DON’T NECESSARILY SEE US JAMMING TOGETHER…\n\n(Michelle) Thank you again, so very much for taking time to do this. I really love the band and I admire you a lot for your passion and dedication to your work and your fans!\n\nTHANK YOU AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS!\n\nThank you Michelle for the Interview."
