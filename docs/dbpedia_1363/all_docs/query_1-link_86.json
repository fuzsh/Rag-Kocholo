        "text": "You know what blows my mind? Why isn’t Lacuna Coil more mainstream in the US? I think they have everything going for them. I think their tone quality of their guitars is great. I think the lead singer Christina Scabbia is way hotter than Amy Lee and sounds great as well. I think their music is great and tight as opposed to a wall of guitars that you cant even hear that seems to be the case with many bands today. What a shame that I only learned of them by playing Guitar Hero back in the day.\n\nThe band formed in 1994 by the other lead singer Andrea Ferro and bassist Marco Coti Zelati. They went through quite a few changes but ended up naming the band Lacuna Coil and releasing their self titled EP in 1998 a year after Scabbia joined the band. They picked up a lot of momentum in europe and in the next decade they had a ton of great tracks that you can view on youtube like Heaven’s a Lie, Our Truth, Spellbound, and a great cover of Depeche Modes Enjoy the Silence, among others.\n\nOne of my favorite tracks of all time is also the colab Scabbia did with Megadeth on a toute le monde. They also have a great concert on youtube, Wacken open air festival 2007. However I won’t post every video I like so I will leave you with my 3 favorite."
