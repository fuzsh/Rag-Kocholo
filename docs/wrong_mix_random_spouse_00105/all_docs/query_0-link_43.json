        "text": "It's been a firm favourite among TV audiences since it first hit screens in 2011 - and fans are eager to know where is Death in Paradise filmed.\n\nSurrounded by such gorgeous scenery, it makes you wonder how so many people on the island of Saint Marie can be drawn to murder. The gripping who-dunnit storylines keep viewers coming back series after series, and it’s proven so popular that a Death in Paradise spin-off was announced in June 2022, with Beyond Paradise episodes currently delighting viewers in February 2023.\n\nThe show has featured several famous faces over the years - from ex-Strictly Come Dancing contestant Danny John-Jules to actor Kris Marshall to current leading man Ralf Little - but the sunny setting has remained the same throughout. Following the arrival of the show's 12th season on 6 January, many want to know more about those stunning island locations where Death in Paradise is filmed - and some want to know where spin-off show Beyond Paradise is filmed too.\n\nWhere is Death in Paradise filmed?\n\nDeath in Paradise is filmed across the islands of Guadeloupe, an overseas territory of France located in the eastern Caribbean Sea. So, while the island and the town where Death in Paradise is set place are both fictional, the gorgeous locations you see on screen do exist.\n\nGuadeloupe is made up of a butterfly-shaped collection of five islands. The island’s official website shares all kinds of exciting things you can do while visiting Guadeloupe, including getting married and going island hopping.\n\nDeath in Paradise executive producer Tim Key previously told Express.com, “Not only is the island one of the characters in the show and not only is the town of Deshaies one of the main characters of the show, but about 50 per cent of our crew are from France or Guadeloupe. A lot of them are sort of family to us because we've known them for so long.”\n\nAnd much of the on-screen talent is local too. While the guest stars often fly in from the UK, all of the supporting artists are local to the island, and the team works with graduates from a film school on Guadeloupe. Key told What to Watch \"I think at the start they were slightly baffled by us, then when French TV started showing Death in Paradise it all made sense to them.\"\n\nWhere is Death in Paradise set?\n\nDeath in Paradise is set on the fictional island of Saint Marie, in the town of Honoré. This imaginary island is supposed to be about a 10th of the size of neighbouring Guadeloupe.\n\nUnlike Guadeloupe, Saint Marie is not French Overseas territory but British. However, it only came under British control in the seventies, and around 30 percent of its inhabitants are French - which explains the French accents you hear on the show. The main religions on the island are supposedly Catholicism and Voodoo, making for some interesting local festivals every year.\n\nDoes Catherine's bar exist?\n\nThe scenes of the beloved detectives sipping cocktails and discussing cases in Catherine's Bar are shot at a beachside restaurant called 'Le Madras' in Deshaies, Guadeloupe. So, while you won’t actually find Catherine herself running it, the bar is more than just a set.\n\nJust like Catherine’s Bar, 'Le Madras' serves beer, cocktails and sensational seafood. It currently has a four-star rating on Tripadvisor and the many reviews left on the site reference the restaurant's part in the hit drama.\n\nÉlizabeth Bourgine, the actress who plays Catherine, has shared many snaps of the picturesque bar on her Instagram, so Death in Paradise fans know what to expect if they ever make the trip to see it.\n\nIs Honoré police station a real police station?\n\nIn the real world, Honoré police station is not a police station but the Presbytery attached to the church of St Peter and St Paul. You can visit the place where the exterior shots of the police station are filmed, and the building's neighbours are more than welcoming to fans of the show.\n\n“We get on very well with the priest, we’ve worked with him since the beginning,” producer Tim Key previously told What to Watch.\n\nWhere is the Inspector’s shack?\n\nThe picture-perfect Inspector's shack can be found at La Perle Beach - which translates to 'Pearl Beach' - three miles north of Deshaies.\n\nThe shack is not quite as secluded as it might seem in the TV series, in reality there are several bars and restaurants as well as a car park nearby. Much like most of the filming locations in Death in Paradise, La Perle Beach is near the town of Deshaies, roughly a seven minute drive up the coastal road.\n\nLa Perle has an impressive five-star rating on TripAdvisor, with reviewers praising its beauty and the miles of unspoilt sand and palm trees.\n\nCan you visit the Inspector's shack?\n\nUnfortunately, the inspector's prime beach real-estate spot can only be found during filming months, and even then it is fenced off from the public beach.\n\nThe wooden shack, which all four detectives have now inhabited, is simply a set constructed on a public beach. It's put up for the six months of filming but is then taken down for the rest of the year.\n\nTim Key told Radio Times, \"We’ve had years where we’ve kind of left it to the elements, and then people were having parties in it at weekends, like tourists having parties. We were like, 'We have to secure this a little bit more now!'\"\n\nWhere do the actors stay when filming Death in Paradise?\n\nThe Death in Paradise cast and crew are based in Deshaies for the six months or so each year that they film the series. Though a traditional fishing village, Deshaies boasts numerous restaurants and bars, and is surrounded by picturesque beaches perfect for snorkelling.\n\nAccording to the Mirror, much of the cast and crew stay in the Langley Fort Royal Hotel, though some of the core cast who stay for the whole six months live in local villas with their families.\n\nThe hotel is situated a ten minute drive to the east of Deshaies, right on the Plage du Petit Bas Vent, and offers a spa, pool and a whole host of activities, including tennis, surfing, scuba diving and a kids club.\n\nWhen was Death in Paradise season 12 filmed?\n\nDeath in Paradise season 12 began filming in June 2022, along with the latest Christmas Special.\n\nLeading man Ralf Little, who plays D.I. Neville Parker, shared the news on Instagram with a video of himself in Guadeloupe. The 42-year-old clearly enjoys his time on the island, as he's shared plenty more behind-the-scenes snaps already, including a video of him getting his hair ready for shooting, and another sharing the work of the art department.\n\nAnd Little isn't the only cast member who relishes his time on the island. Speaking to HELLO! early this year, Joséphine Jobert, who plays Florence Cassell, said \"Filming in Guadeloupe, it's amazing. The sceneries, the people, the vibe, the crew, it's like a family. During the weekends, we'll go and see waterfalls, swim in the sea, eat in good restaurants, and the weather is so lovely.\"\n\nThe 12th season was commissioned back in 2021, at the same time as the 11th, and Tim Key said in a press release \"We are hugely proud of series ten and delighted we'll be heading back to Saint Marie to continue the story. Our amazing cast and crew have delivered against the odds this year and we can't wait to get going again – we've got huge plans for the future, with lots of surprises to come.\"\n\nThe date for Death in Paradise season 12 is yet to be announced, though it's thought that it will air in January 2023.\n\nCan you holiday where Death in Paradise is filmed? \"I saw Death in Paradise being filmed\"\n\nYes, you can go on holiday where Death in Paradise if filmed. In fact, our very own writer Ellie Hutchings has visited some of the filming locations herself. Here's what she said...\n\nDeath in Paradise was a favourite family watch in my home, so when I headed to the island where it's filmed, Guadeloupe, back in 2018, I was intrigued to see how the crystal clear water and magical sunsets measured up in real life.\n\nWe were staying right by Deshaies, slightly inland on top of hill with fantastic views out to sea, and just a ten minute walk from Plage de Grande Anse. The town itself was pretty and quaint, and it came alive at night as the bars and restaurant filled up.\n\nOf course, we had to try Le Madras, the restaurant where Catherine's Bar is filmed. The food was delicious and boasted a variety of fresh seafood dishes and West Indian food, such as curried goat and bananas flambé.\n\nOther Death in Paradise locations we checked out were Honoré Police Station and the Inspector's shack. To our delight, the film crew were on location during our stay on the island, so the shack was set up. Though the fence and tape around it stopped us from getting too close, the beach where it's situated - La Perle - was one of the most beautiful places we visited.\n\nAll in all, Guadeloupe is a charming holiday destination, with stunning water falls, unspoilt beaches and (mostly) clear blue skies. If you're a Death in Paradise fan the trip is even more worth it - and don't worry, the murder rate is fictional too!\n\nRelated features:\n\nWhen did Kris Marshall leave Death in Paradise?\n\nSally Bretton husband and children -details of the Beyond Paradise star's family life\n\nWhat is the Beyond Paradise theme tune?"
