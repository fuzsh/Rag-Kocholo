        "text": "WEDDING OF THE YEAR\n\nThis week’s Phantom Dancer feature artist with Greg Poppleton, is ‘the Red-Headed Music Maker’, Wendall Hall. Wendall was an early radio star and was the first to be married live on radio on 4 June 1924 to Marion Martin over WEAF New York.\n\nONLINE\n\nThis week’s Phantom Dancer will be online after the 10 November 107.3 2SER Sydney live mix at 2ser.com.\n\nHear the show live every Tuesday 12:04-2pm on 107.3 2SER Sydney.\n\nWENDALL\n\nThis week’s Phantom Dancer goes back to the earliest radio of the 1920s – 39s for its feature artist. Wendall Hall was an American country singer, vaudeville artist, songwriter, pioneer radio performer, Victor recording artist and ukulele player.\n\nRAIN\n\nIn 1923, Hall released the song “It Ain’t Gonna Rain No Mo’,” which sold over two million copies in the United States. It was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. The song is also considered the first musical hit on radio. He wrote “Underneath the Mellow Moon” and “Carolina Rose”. Hall also wrote songs with Carson Robison and Art Gillham.\n\n1920s RADIO STAR\n\nHall began his career in 1922 Chicago as a song plugger for Forster Music. He traveled around the US and stopped in towns to play in music stores, theaters, and radio. In vaudeville he began singing and playing the xylophone. He found the ukulele to be more portable and quickly became an expert with that instrument. In January, 1924 he signed with the National Carbon Company to host the Eveready Hour a pioneer commercially sponsored variety program on WEAF in New York. On November 4, 1924 the program was on a pre-network 18 station “hook-up” to broadcast election returns with entertainers Will Rogers, Carson Robison, Art Gillham, and the Waldorf Astoria Orchestra. Eveready even painted their batteries with a red top to cash in on Hall’s popularity. In 1929 Wendell Hall hosted the Majestic Music Hour and a few years later Gillette’s Community Sing. He made a few musical short films.\n\nOn a 1925 European tour he was broadcast over a 21 station hook-up, the largest ever attempted up to that time.\n\nAfter his radio days were over, Wendell Hall wrote commercials for radio.\n\nTAROPATCH\n\nHall performed on a variety of stringed instruments, including the standard ukulele, the taropatch ukulele, banjo, and the hybrid banjolele, as well as the tiple. Like so many of the other performers during the era, Hall was a big fan of the instruments created by the C.F. Martin & Company, particularly their Taropatch. Like other performers, he was unsuccessful in obtaining an endorsement deal with Martin, but in response to his letter offering to endorse their product, Martin offered their 20% discount for professional performers and to inlay his name in the head of the instrument.\n\nUKULELE\n\nHe published an instruction book, Wendell Hall’s Ukulele Method, with Forster Music in 1925, that was edited by May Singhi Breen. He also marketed a series of custom ukuleles through the Regal Musical Instrument Company of Chicago, with his picture on the head of The Red Head Ukulele and banjolele with red tuning pegs that became collectors’ items for several generations afterward\n\nWith the resurgence of the uke’s popularity in the 1950s, Hall was able to land a radio show on WBKB five days a week, the home of the Griff Williams Show which is your Phantom Dancer Video of the Week…\n\nPlay List – The Phantom Dancer\n\n107.3 2SER-FM Sydney, Live Stream, Digital Radio\n\nCommunity Radio Network Show CRN #417\n\n107.3 2SER Tuesday 10 December 2019\n\nAfter the 2SER 12 noon news, 12:04 – 2:00pm (+11 hours GMT)\n\nNational Program:\n\n1 ART ArtsoundFM Canberra Sunday 10 – 11pm\n\nEdge FM Bega Monday 3 – 4pm\n\n3VKV Alpine Radio 6 – 7pm\n\n7MID Oatlands Tuesday 8 – 9pm\n\n2ARM Armidale Friday 12 – 1pm\n\n3MGB Mallacoota Sunday 5 – 6am\n\nand early morning on 23 other stations.\n\nSet 1\n\nModernistic 1950s Dance Bands\n\nArtistry in Rhythm (theme) + A Melody To The Trees\n\nStan Kenton Orchestra\n\n‘Concert in Miniature’\n\nLakeside Ballroom\n\nDayton OH\n\nWLW NBC Cincinnati\n\n16 Sep 1952\n\nSavings Bonds Ad + The Stars and Stripes Forever\n\nRalph Flanagan Orchestra\n\n‘Treasury Bandstand’\n\nCafe Rouge\n\nHotel Statler\n\nWCBS CBS NY\n\n1950\n\nWending My May Back Home + Close\n\nEliot Lawrence Orchestra\n\n‘Jazz Is My Beat’\n\nNew York City\n\nAFRTS Re-broadcast\n\n1958\n\nSet 2\n\nEarly Live 1930s Ragio\n\nOpen + Music In My Fingers\n\nGeorge Shackley Ensemble (voc) Veronica Wiggins\n\n‘Nihi Program’\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nNew York City\n\n1931\n\nMargie + Do You Ever Think Of Me? + Sweet Sue\n\nJimmie Grier Orchestra\n\nCocoanut Grove\n\nAmbassador Hotel\n\nKFI NBC Gold Network LA\n\n1932\n\nMelancholy Moon + Pineapple Ad + It Gonna Rain No More + Aloha Oe\n\nWendall Hall\n\n‘The Pineapple Picadour’\n\nWMAQ NBC Red\n\nChicago\n\n2 Apr 1931\n\nSet 3\n\nSuper Jive From 1937 – 38 Radio\n\nDark Forest (theme) + Limehouse Blues\n\nEarl Hines Orchestra\n\nGrand Terrace Room\n\nWMAQ NBC Red Chicago\n\n3 Aug 1938\n\nA Study in Blue\n\nLarry Clinton Orchestra\n\nHotel Park Central\n\nWEAF NBC Red NY\n\n7 Jul 1939\n\nWhen It’s Sleepy Time Down South + Camel Hop\n\nBenny Goodman Orchestra\n\nMadhattan Room\n\nHotel Pennsylvania\n\nWABC CBS NY\n\n20 Oct 1937\n\nSet 4\n\n1940s Dance Bands\n\nVoglio Fischiettiare (I Like To Whistle)\n\nNuccia Natali and Vocal Trio with Orchestra\n\nComm Rec\n\nCetra\n\nTurin\n\n1940\n\nThe Sheik of Araby\n\nRuss Morgan Orchestra\n\n‘One Night Stand’\n\nAFRS Re-broadcast\n\n28 Apr 1944\n\nMedley\n\nArt Kassels and his Kassels-in-the-Air Orchestra\n\nBlackhawk Restaurant\n\nWGN Chicago\n\n1947\n\nSet 5\n\nJazz and Pop on 1940 Radio\n\nIt Never Entered My Head\n\nShep Fields and his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra (voc) Hal Derwin\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nNew York City\n\n1940\n\nOpen + Down For The Count\n\nGlenn Miller Orchestra\n\nCafe Rouge\n\nHotel Pennsylvania\n\nWJZ NBC Blue NY\n\n6 Nov 1940\n\nSt Louis Blues\n\nRoy Eldridge\n\n‘Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street’\n\nWJZ NBC Blue NY\n\n21 Apr 1940\n\nFour Beat Shuffle + Pretty Little Petticoat (theme)\n\nRaymond Scott Orchestra\n\nPanther Room\n\nHotel Sherman\n\nWMAQ NBC Red Chicago\n\n1940\n\nSet 6\n\nNew Orleans Jazz on Radio\n\nOpen + Way Down Yonder in New Orleans\n\nLouis Armstrong All-Stars\n\n‘New Orleans Movie Opening’\n\nWintergarden Theatre\n\nWNBC NBC NY\n\n19 Jun 1947\n\nOpen + At The Jazz Band Ball\n\nEddie Condon Group\n\n‘Eddie Condon Jazz Concert’\n\nTown Hall\n\nWJZ Blue NY\n\n30 Sep 1944\n\nI Ain’t Gonna Give Nobody None Of My Jelly Roll\n\nBud Freeman Summa Cum Laude Orchestra\n\nPanther Room\n\nHotel Sherman\n\nWMAQ NBC Red Chicago\n\n20 May 1940\n\nThat’s A’Plenty + Relaxin’ At The Touro (theme)\n\nMuggsy Spanier Dixieland All-Stars\n\nClub Hangover\n\nKCBS CBS San Francisco\n\n18 Apr 1953\n\nSet 7\n\nBig Bands on 1947 Radio\n\nWho’s Got The Ball?\n\nHarry James Orchestra\n\nThe Click\n\nWFIL Philadelphia\n\n22 Dec 1947\n\nKate\n\nTommy Dorsey Orchestra (voc) The Town Criers\n\nCasino Gardens\n\nOcean Park Ca\n\nKECA ABC LA\n\n6 Dec 1947\n\nEverybody Eats When They Come To My House\n\nCab Calloway’s Caballiers (voc) CC\n\n‘Guest Star’\n\nNew York City\n\n1947\n\nPassion Flower\n\nDuke Ellington Orchestra\n\n‘One Night Stand’\n\nCiro’s Hollywood\n\nAFRS Re-broadcast\n\nJul 1947\n\nSet 8\n\nCharlie Parker on WMCA NY 1949\n\nChasin’ The Bird\n\nCharlie Parker Sextet\n\n‘Symphony Sid Show’\n\nRoyal Roost\n\nWMCA NY\n\n12 Mar 1949\n\nConfirmation\n\nCharlie Parker Quintet\n\n‘Symphony Sid Show’\n\nRoyal Roost\n\nWMCA NY\n\n19 Feb 1949\n\nScrapple From The Apple\n\nCharlie Parker Quintet\n\n‘Symphony Sid Show’\n\nRoyal Roost\n\nWMCA NY\n\n22 Jan 1949\n\nJACK\n\nThis week’s Phantom Dancer feature artist with Greg Poppleton, is, following last week’s Kid Ory feature, also a tromobonist. He is credited with being the most important pre-bop trombonist in jazz, who took trombone away from Kid Ory’s tailgate style. It’s Jack Teagarden.\n\nONLINE\n\nThis week’s Phantom Dancer will be online after the 29 October 107.3 2SER Sydney live mix at 2ser.com.\n\nHear the show live every Tuesday 12:04-2pm on 107.3 2SER Sydney.\n\nTEAGARDEN\n\nJack Teagarden was the preeminent American jazz trombone player before the bebop era of the 1940s as well as being an engaging singer.\n\nHis early career was as a sideman in the orchestras of Tommy Dorsey, Paul Whiteman and lifelong friend Louis Armstrong before branching out as a bandleader in 1939. We hear his new orchestra debuting on radio in 1939 on this week’s Phantom Dancer. After WWII he specialised in New Orleans jazz until his death.\n\nSTART\n\nJack’s is brother Charlie and sister Norma also became professional musicians. His father was an amateur brass band trumpeter and started him on baritone horn. At age seven he had switched to trombone. His first public performances were in movie theaters, accompanying his piano playing mother.\n\nSTYLE\n\nHis trombone style was largely self-taught. He developed many unusual alternative positions and novel special effects on the instrument. He is usually considered the most innovative jazz trombone stylist of the pre-bebop era. He did much to expand the role of the instrument beyond the Kid Ory tailgate style of the early New Orleans brass bands.\n\nCAREER\n\nThis week’s Phantom Dancer features broadcast excerpts of Jack Teagarden between 1936-41. He had begun playing professionally as a teenager, playing with many different bands in a process that took him from his native Texas to New York City.\n\nTeagarden sought financial security during the Great Depression and signed a contract to play for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra from 1933 through 1938. Jack did play and broadcast on radio in small jazz groups in the mid 30s with his brother Charlie and Frankie Trambauer as ‘The Three T’s.’ I have played some of these radio broadcasts from the Hickory House over CBS but the sound quality is very poor.\n\nBIG BAND\n\nTeagarden started leading his own big band in 1939. We’ll hear it’s debut on ‘The Fitch Summer Bandwagon’. The band was not a commercial success, and he was brought to the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nVIDEO\n\nThis week’s Phantom Dancer video of the week is film of Jack Teagarden from a 1950s Telescription playing with ‘Basin Street Blues’.\n\n29 OCTOBER PLAY LIST\n\nPlay List – The Phantom Dancer\n\n107.3 2SER-FM Sydney, Live Stream, Digital Radio\n\nCommunity Radio Network Show CRN #411\n\n107.3 2SER Tuesday 29 October 2019\n\nAfter the 2SER 12 noon news, 12:04 – 2:00pm (+11 hours GMT)\n\nNational Program:\n\nArtsoundFM Canberra Sunday 10 – 11pm\n\nEdge FM Bega Monday 3 – 4pm\n\n7MID Oatlands Tuesday 8 – 9pm\n\n2ARM Armidale Friday 12 – 1pm\n\n3MGB Mallacoota Sunday 5 – 6am\n\nand early morning on 23 other stations.\n\nSet 1\n\n1944-54 Radio Dance Bands\n\nOpen + Two Spot Hop\n\nDean Hudson Orchestra\n\n‘One Night Stand’\n\nBlue Room\n\nHotel Lincoln\n\nAFRS Re-broadcast\n\n11 Nov 1944\n\nMinding My Business\n\nBuddy Rich Orchestra (voc) Dorothy Reid\n\n‘Spotlight Band’\n\nMutual Network\n\n24 Dec 1945\n\nOle Negra + Close\n\nPaul Neighbours Orchestra\n\nBiltmore Bowl\n\nBiltmore Hotel\n\nNBC via KGHL Billings, MO\n\n1954\n\nSet 2\n\nWomen Singers on Radio\n\nCan’t Help Loving That Man\n\nHelen Forrest (voc) Billy Liebert Group\n\n‘Ford Show with Tennessee Ernie Ford’\n\nAudition Disc\n\n1960\n\nCry Me a River\n\nJulie London (voc) Bobby Troup Group\n\n‘All-Star Parade of Bands’\n\nCameo\n\nWRCA NBC NY\n\n1956\n\nOnce In a While + Close\n\nDinah Shore\n\n‘MUM Show’\n\nKECA Blue LA\n\n1944\n\nSet 3\n\nModern Sounds 1947-60\n\nOpen + Trajectory\n\nStan Kenton Orchestra\n\n‘Innovations 1950’\n\nRadio Transcription\n\n1950\n\nJack, Jack, Jack\n\nClaude Thornhill Orchestra (voc) Fran Warren\n\nGlen Island Casino\n\nNew Rochelle NY\n\nWJZ ABC NY\n\n23 Jun 1947\n\nCool By The Pool\n\nGilbert Lacombe Septet\n\nCBC Monteal\n\n1960\n\nSet 4\n\nJack Teagarden\n\nAnnouncer’s Blues\n\nPaul Whiteman Orchestra (tb solo) Jack Teagarden\n\n‘Paul Whiteman’s Musical Varieties’\n\nWJZ NBC Blue NY\n\n19 Jan 1936\n\nSomebody Nobody Knows + Octoroon\n\nJack Teagarden\n\nOrchestra\n\n‘Fitch Summer Bandwagon’\n\nWABC CBS NY\n\nNov 1939\n\nMr Jessie\n\nJack Teagarden\n\nOrchestra (voc) Jack Teagarden + Band\n\nPanther Room\n\nHotel Sherman\n\nWMAQ NBC Chicago\n\n27 Dec 1941\n\nSet 5\n\nPhil Harris Orch 1933\n\nOpen + Love Me Tonight\n\nPhil Harris Orchestra (voc) Jimmy Mill\n\nCocoanut Grove\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nLos Angeles\n\n1933\n\nStrange Interlude\n\nPhil Harris Orchestra\n\nCocoanut Grove\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nLos Angeles\n\n1933\n\nFrom AM to PM + Close\n\nPhil Harris Orchestra (voc) The Three Rhythm Kings\n\nCocoanut Grove\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nLos Angeles\n\n1933\n\nSet 6\n\n1949-55 Swing Bands\n\nLeap Frog\n\nLes Brown Orchestra\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nSep 1949\n\nWoodchoppers’ Ball\n\nWoody Herman Orchestra\n\n‘All Star Parade of Bands’\n\nPeony Park\n\nOmaha NE\n\nWOW NBC Omaha\n\n1954\n\nMoonlight in Vermont\n\nClaude Thornhill Orchestra (voc) Patty Ryan\n\nSteel Pier\n\nAtlantic City NJ\n\nABC\n\n19 Jun 1955\n\nLullaby of Birdland + Close\n\nCount Basie Orchestra\n\n‘Stars of Jazz’\n\nBirdland\n\nWNBC NBC NY\n\n14 Jan 1953\n\nSet 7\n\n1943-45 Dance Band Radio Transcriptions.\n\nRead the Horace Heidt story from a 2017 Phantom Dancer\n\nDoodle-Doo-Doo (open ) + Candy\n\nArt Kassels and his Kassels-in-the-Air (voc) Glria Hart\n\nRadio Transcription\n\n1945\n\nHistory of Music\n\nHorace Heidt Orchestra (narr) Horace Heidt\n\nRadio Transcription\n\n1943\n\nBell Bottom Trousers\n\nArt Kassels and his Kassels-in-the-Air (voc) Trio\n\nRadio Transcription\n\n1945\n\nI Wonder Who’s Kissing Her Now?\n\nHorace Heidt Orchestra (voc) Horace Heidt\n\nRadio Transcription\n\n1943\n\nSet 8\n\nCharlie Parker\n\nScrapple From The Apple\n\nCharlie Parker\n\n‘Symphony Sid Show’\n\nRoyal Roost\n\nWMCA NY\n\n15 Jan 1949\n\nWhat Is Bop?\n\nSymphony Sid\n\n‘Symphony Sid Show’\n\nRoyal Roost\n\nWMCA NY\n\n19 Feb 1949\n\nOo-Bop-Sha-Bam\n\nCharlie Parker (voc) Band\n\n‘Symphony Sid Show’\n\nRoyal Roost\n\nWMCA NY\n\n22 Jan 1949\n\nKID\n\nOn this week’s Phantom Dancer presented by myself, Greg Poppleton, the second 2SER Supporter Drive 2019 show, I’ve put together a non-stop mix of some of my favourite and rare swing and jazz from live 1920s-60s radio. The feature artist this week is trad trombonist Kid Ory in broadcasts from 1949, 54 and 55.\n\nONLINE\n\nThis week’s Phantom Dancer will be online right after the 22 October 107.3 2SER Sydney live mix at 2ser.com.\n\nHear the show live every Tuesday 12:04-2pm on 107.3 2SER Sydney.\n\nSUPPORT\n\nJoin thousands of others to keep community radio on air by supporting to 2SER now https://2ser.com/featurealbum/supporter-drive-2019/\n\nORY\n\nEdward ‘Kid’ Ory was a Louisiana French-speaking bandleader and one of the most influential trombonists of early jazz.\n\nHe started playing music with homemade instruments in his childhood. By his teens he was leading a well-regarded band in southeast Louisiana. He kept LaPlace, Louisiana, as his base of operations because of family obligations until his twenty-first birthday, when he moved his band to New Orleans.\n\nTAILGATE\n\nOry was a banjo player during his youth. He said banjo skills helped him develop ‘tailgate’, his style of playing the trombone with a rhythmic line underneath the trumpets and cornets.\n\nOry had one of the best-known bands in New Orleans in the 1910s, hiring many of the great jazz musicians of the city, including the cornetists Joe ‘King’ Oliver, Louis Armstrong, who joined the band in 1919, and clarinetists Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone.\n\nWEST\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles in 1919 and recorded there in 1921 with a band that included Mutt Carey, the clarinetist and pianist Dink Johnson, and the double bassist Ed Garland. Garland and Carey were longtime associates who would still be playing with Ory during his 1940s comeback which we’ll be hearing on this week’s Phantom Dancer.\n\nNORTH\n\nIn 1925, Ory moved to Chicago to play record with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey. He mentored Benny Goodman and, later, Charles Mingus.\n\nWEST AGAIN\n\nDuring the Great Depression Ory retired from music. He did not play again until 1943. He ran a chicken farm in California. From 1944 to about 1961 he led one of the top New Orleans–style bands of the period. His sidemen during this period included Carey and Garland, the trumpeters Alvin Alcorn and Teddy Buckner; the clarinetists Darnell Howard, Jimmie Noone, Albert Nicholas, Barney Bigard, and George Probert, pianists Buster Wilson, Cedric Haywood, and Don Ewell, and drummer Minor Hall.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nThe Ory band was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz, making popular 1940s radio broadcasts—among them a number of slots on The Orson Welles Almanac program. In 1944–45 the group made a series of recordings for Crescent Records, which was founded by Nesuhi Ertegun for the express purpose of recording Ory’s band.\n\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s, Ory and his group appeared at the Beverly Cavern in Los Angeles. In the mid-50s he played Club Hangover in San Francisco. Ory retired from music in 1966 and spent his last years in Hawaii.\n\nVIDEO\n\nThis week’s Phantom Dancer video of the week is film of Kid Ory playing with Henry ‘Red’ Allen at the Salle Pleyel Paris in 1959.\n\n22 OCTOBER PLAY LIST\n\nPlay List – The Phantom Dancer\n\n107.3 2SER-FM Sydney, Live Stream, Digital Radio\n\nCommunity Radio Network Show CRN #410\n\n107.3 2SER Tuesday 22 October 2019\n\nAfter the 2SER 12 noon news, 12:04 – 2:00pm (+11 hours GMT)\n\nNational Program:\n\nArtsoundFM Canberra Sunday 10 – 11pm\n\nEdge FM Bega Monday 3 – 4pm\n\n7MID Oatlands Tuesday 8 – 9pm\n\n2ARM Armidale Friday 12 – 1pm\n\n3MGB Mallacoota Sunday 5 – 6am\n\nand early morning on 23 other stations.\n\nSet 1\n\nSelling Cars in 1936\n\nOpen + It’s You I’m Talking About\n\nBob Crosby Orchestra (voc) Bob Crosby\n\n‘Ford V8 Revue’\n\nRadio Transcription\n\n1936\n\nOpen + On Your Toes\n\nFred Waring and The Pennsylvanians (voc) Glee Club and Johnny Davis\n\n‘Ford and Lincoln Program’\n\nWABC CBS NY\n\n14 Apr 1936\n\nI’d Rather Lead a Band + Close\n\nBob Crosby Orchestra (voc) Bob Crosby and The Freshman Trio\n\n‘Ford V8 Revue’\n\nRadio Transcription\n\n1936\n\nSet 2\n\nJazz from 1960 Radio\n\nOpen + Love Letters\n\nRodolfo Alchurron Quartet\n\n‘Este es Jazz’\n\nLR1 Radio Buenos Aires\n\n28 Mat 1960\n\nGet Out of Town\n\nPatty MacGovern\n\n‘Jazz International’\n\nAFRTS Re-broadcast\n\nLos Angeles\n\n16 Jun 1960\n\nRhythm-a-Ning\n\nThelonius Monk\n\n‘World Jazz Series’\n\nConnie Mack Park\n\nHershey, Pennsylvania\n\nCBS\n\n3 Mar 1960\n\nSet 3\n\nEarliest Radio\n\nOpen + I’m a Dreamer, Aren’t We All?\n\nLeonard Joy Orchestra\n\n‘Coca Cola Top Notchers’\n\nWEAF NBC Red NY\n\n19 Mar 1930\n\nCall Of The Freaks\n\nRed Nichols Orchestra\n\n‘Heat’\n\nRadio Transcription\n\n1 Aug 1930\n\nMedley (includes If I Can’t Have You + I’ll Close My Eyes To The Rest of the World\n\nColonial Club Orchestra\n\n‘Brunswick Brevities’\n\nWABC CBS NY\n\nOct 1929\n\nSet 4\n\nKid Ory\n\nTheme + Royal Garden Blues\n\nKid Ory\n\nClub Hangover\n\nKCBS San Francisco\n\n5 Feb 1955\n\nTheme + Mississippi Mud\n\nKid Ory\n\nBeverly Cavern Club\n\nKGFJ Los Angeles\n\n28 Jun 1949\n\nI Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate + Chinatown, My Chinatown\n\nKid Ory\n\nClub Hangover\n\nKCBS San Francisco\n\n6 Nov 1954\n\nSet 5\n\nBreakfast Radio 1935-55\n\nOpen + Habanera\n\nUnidentified Orchestra\n\nWJSV CBS Washington DC\n\n21 Sep 1939\n\nPick Yourself Up + A Fine Romance\n\nHal Kemp Orchestra (voc) Skinnay Ennis\n\nMorning Radio\n\nOct 1935\n\nI Never Knew\n\nRayond Scott’s Captivators\n\n‘Morning Music’\n\nWABC CBS NY\n\n10 Jan 1943\n\nOpen+ Rain\n\nDorsey Brothers’ Orchestra\n\n‘NBC Bandstand’\n\nWRCA NBC NY\n\n1956\n\nSet 6\n\nWomen Singers on the Air\n\nOh Babe, Maybe Some Day\n\nIvie Anderson (voc) Duke Ellington Orchestra\n\nCotton Club\n\nWABC CBS NY\n\n24 Mar 1938\n\nThey Can’t Take That Away from Me\n\nBillie Holliday (voc) Count Basie Orchestra\n\nAircheck\n\nSavoy Ballroom, Harlem\n\n30 Jul 1937\n\nMad About The Boy\n\nLena Horne (voc) Fletcher Henderson Orchestra\n\n‘Jubille’\n\nAFRS Hollywood\n\n1944\n\nThere’ll Be A Jubilee\n\nDinah Washington (voc) Lionel Hampton Orchestra\n\n‘One Night Stand’\n\nTrianon Ballroom\n\nCulver City CA\n\nAFRS Re-broadcast\n\n16 Jun 1944\n\nSet 7\n\n1943 – 45 Australian Swing\n\nJungle Jive\n\nGeorge Trevare Orchestra (voc) Elsie Wardrope\n\nComm Rec\n\nSydney\n\nJohnny Zero\n\nGeorge Trevare Orchestra (voc) Joan Blake\n\nComm Rec\n\nSydney\n\nSay a Prayer For the Boys Over There\n\nGeorge Trevare Orchestra (voc) Joan Blake\n\nComm Rec\n\nSydney\n\nThere, I’ve Said It Again\n\nGeorge Trevare Orchestra (voc) Tassie Hamilton\n\nComm Rec\n\nSydney\n\nSet 8\n\nCharlie Parker\n\nScrapple From The Apple\n\nCharlie Parker\n\n‘Symphony Sid Show’\n\nRoyal Roost\n\nWMCA NY\n\n15 Jan 1949\n\nWhat Is Bop?\n\nSymphony Sid\n\n‘Symphony Sid Show’\n\nRoyal Roost\n\nWMCA NY\n\n19 Feb 1949\n\nOo-Bop-Sha-Bam\n\nCharlie Parker (voc) Band\n\n‘Symphony Sid Show’\n\nRoyal Roost\n\nWMCA NY\n\n22 Jan 1949\n\nSWING ARRANGER\n\nThis week’s Greg Poppleton Phantom Dancer features a set of 1940s swing bands from the Spotlight Bands series, a set of 1940s Nat King Cole and a set of the Dorsey Brothers on air, Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey with a feature by their uptempo arranger, the influential musician and composer, Sy Oliver.\n\nONLINE\n\nThe Phantom Dancer will be online right after the 6 August 107.3 2SER Sydney live mix at 2ser.com.\n\nHear the show live every Tuesday 12:04-2pm and Saturday 5 – 5:55pm on 107.3 2SER Sydney\n\nThe last hour is all vinyl.\n\nOLIVER\n\nSy Oliver was a byword for swing in the 1940s. His musicianship skyrocketed the careers of big band leaders Jimmie Lunceford and Tommy Dorsey, both of whom you hear on this week’s Phantom Dancer. From wiki,\n\n“Sy Oliver was born in Battle Creek, Michigan. His mother was a piano teacher and his father was a multi-instrumentalist who made a name for himself demonstrating saxophones at a time that instrument was little used outside of marching bands.\n\nOliver left home at 17 to play with Zack Whyte and his Chocolate Beau Brummels and later with Alphonse Trent. He sang and played trumpet with these bands, becoming known for his “growling” horn playing. He also began arranging with them.\n\nHe continued singing for the next 17 years, making many recordings when he was with Jimmie Lunceford and with his own band. With Lunceford, from 1934 to 1937, he recorded more than two dozen vocals. From 1949 to 1951, he recorded more than a dozen with his own band. With Tommy Dorsey, he only recorded two vocals, both in 1941 with Jo Stafford, on his own compositions “Yes Indeed” and “Swingin’ on Nothin'”.\n\nOliver arranged and conducted many songs for Ella Fitzgerald from her Decca years. As a composer, one of his most famous songs was “T’ain’t What You Do (It’s the Way That You Do It)”, which he co-wrote with Trummy Young.\n\nLUNCEFORD\n\nIn 1933, Oliver joined Jimmie Lunceford’s band as a trumpet player, arranger and songwriter. He contributed many hit arrangements for the band, including “My Blue Heaven” and “Ain’t She Sweet”, as well as his original composition “For Dancers Only” which in time became the band’s theme song. He was co-arranger with pianist Ed Wilson; Oliver primarily taking the up-tempo numbers, Wilcox the ballads. Oliver’s arrangements “were a dashing parade of innovation that rivaled Ellington’s for consistency and originality.”\n\nDORSEY\n\nIn 1939, when band leader Tommy Dorsey decided he wanted a swing band, his first step was to hire Oliver as an arranger away from Lunceford for $5,000 more a year. Oliver then became one of the first African Americans with a prominent role in a white band when he joined Tommy Dorsey. (Fletcher Henderson, another African American composer/arranger, had joined the Benny Goodman orchestra as the arranger some years earlier.) He led the transition of the Dorsey band from Dixieland to modern big band. His joining was instrumental in Dorsey luring several major jazz players, including Buddy Rich to his band.\n\nWith Dorsey, Oliver continued sharing arranging duties with another arranger, Axel Stordahl, Oliver doing up tempo tunes, Stordahl ballads. As James Kaplan puts it, “Tommy Dorsey’s band got a rocket boost in 1939 when Dorsey stole Lunceford’s great arranger Sy Oliver.”\n\nHis arrangement of “On the Sunny Side of the Street” was a big hit for Dorsey in 1946, as were his compositions “Yes, Indeed!” (a gospel-jazz tune that was later recorded by Ray Charles), “Opus One” (originally titled as “Opus No. 1”, but changed to suit the lyric that was added later), “The Minor Is Muggin'”, and “Well, Git It”.\n\nHere’s a 1947 Downbeat review of the Sy Oliver band that you’ll hear from a live 1946 broadcast on this week’s Phantom Dancer…\n\nAPRES DORSEY\n\nOliver left Dorsey after seven years, in 1946, and began working as a freelance arranger and as music director for Decca Records.\n\nOne of his more successful efforts as an arranger was the Frank Sinatra album I Remember Tommy, a combined tribute to their former boss.\n\nJune 26, 1950, Sy Oliver and his Orchestra recorded the first American version of C’est si bon (Henri Betti, André Hornez, Jerry Seelen) and La Vie en rose (Louiguy, Édith Piaf, Mack David) for Louis Armstrong.\n\nIn 1974 he began a nightly gig with a small band at the Rainbow Room in New York. He continued that gig until 1984, with occasion time off to make festival or other dates, including at the Roseland Ballroom in New York. He retired in 1984.\n\nOliver died in New York City at the age of 77.\n\nYour Phantom Dancer Video of the Week this week is a 1936 Vitaphone short of Jimmie Lunceford and his Orchestra with trumpet and arrangements by Sy Oliver\n\nEnjoy!\n\nMake sure you come back to this blog, Greg Poppleton’s Radio Lounge, every Tuesday, for the newest Phantom Dancer play list and Video of the Week!\n\nThank you.\n\nPlay List – The Phantom Dancer\n\n107.3 2SER-FM Sydney, Live Stream, Digital Radio\n\nCommunity Radio Network Show CRN #403\n\n107.3 2SER Tuesday 10 September 2019\n\nAfter the 2SER 12 noon news, 12:04 – 2:00pm (+10 hours GMT)\n\nSet 1\n\nSwing on the 1940s Spotlight Bands Radio Series\n\nBlue Skies + You’re Too Beautiful\n\nHarry James Orchestra (voc) Buddy DeVito\n\n’Spotlight Bands’\n\nAFRS Re-broadcast\n\nAug 1946\n\nFuturama\n\nGene Krupa Orchestra\n\n’Spotlight Bands’\n\nAFRS Re-broadcast\n\n1945\n\nDark Eyes + Temptation (theme)\n\nJimmy Joy Orchestra\n\n’Spotlight Bands’\n\nHarlingen Tx\n\nBlue Network\n\n6 Jan 1945\n\nSet 2\n\nNat King Cole Trio Time on 1947 – 59 Radio\n\nStraighten Up And Fly Right (theme) + Sunday + Ad\n\nNat King Cole Trio (voc) NKC\n\n’King Cole Trio Time’\n\nKFI NBC LA\n\n6 Mar 1948\n\nLittle Joe From Chicago + Boogie A La King\n\nNat King Cole Trio\n\n’King Cole Trio Time’\n\nRadio Transcription\n\n1959\n\nTired\n\nPearl Bailey (voc) Nat King Cole Trio\n\n’King Cole Trio Time’\n\nWMAQ NBC Chicago\n\n1 Mar 1947\n\nSet 3\n\nThose ‘Fabulous Dorseys’ on 1950s Radio and TV\n\nI’m Getting Sentimental Over You (theme) + Sentimental Baby\n\nDorsey Brothers Orchestra (voc) Lynn Roberts\n\n’All-Star Parade of Bands’\n\nClaridge Hotel\n\nWMC NBC Memphis\n\n1953\n\nI’m Getting Sentimental Over You (theme) + Smiles\n\nSy Oliver Orchestra\n\n’Endorsed By Dorsey’\n\nWOR Mutual NY\n\n3 Mar 1946\n\nWhen The Saints Go Marching In + I’m Getting Sentimental Over You (theme)\n\nDorsey Brothers Orchestra (voc) Johnny Ray\n\n’Stage Show’\n\nCBS TV NY\n\n1 Jan 1955\n\nSet 4\n\nModern 1950s Sounds: RnB, Bop and Cool\n\nOpen + King Jacquet\n\nIllinois Jacquet\n\n’Sepia Swing Club’\n\nWDIA Memphis\n\n14 Dec 1951\n\nCool Blues\n\nCharlie Parker\n\nHi-Hat Club\n\nWCOP Boston\n\n1954\n\nI’ve Got Rhythm\n\nThe Flexible Five\n\n’California Melodies’\n\nKHJ Mutual Los Angeles\n\n1950\n\nSet 5\n\nBroadcasting From The Savoy\n\nRound Midnight (theme) + 711\n\nCootie Williams Orchestra\n\n’One Night Stand’\n\nSavoy Ballroom NYC\n\nAFRS Re-broadcast\n\n12 Feb 1945\n\nBody and Soul (theme) + Chant of the Groove\n\nColeman Hawkins Orchestra\n\nAircheck\n\nSavoy Ballroom NYC\n\n1940\n\nThey Can’t Take That Away From Me\n\nCount Basie Orchestra (voc) Billie Holiday\n\nAircheck\n\nSavoy Ballroom NYC\n\n30 Jun 1937\n\nFloogie Boo + St Louis Blues\n\nCootie Williams Orchestra\n\n’One Night Stand’\n\nSavoy Ballroom NYC\n\nAFRS Re-broadcast\n\n12 Feb 1945\n\nSet 6\n\nSwing Bands on 1930s – 1940s Radio\n\nChatterbox\n\nCharlie Barnet Orchestra\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nLos Angeles\n\nApr 1938\n\nAre You Kidding?\n\nJimmie Lunceford Orchestra (voc) Band\n\n’Spotlight Bands’\n\nJefferson Barracks Missouri\n\nBlue Network\n\n23 Nov 1945\n\nBenny’s Bugle\n\nLee and Lester Young Orchestra\n\nClub Capri\n\nKHJ Mutual LA\n\n2 Dec 1941\n\nThe Blizzard\n\nLouis Prima Orchestra\n\n’Spotlight Bands’\n\nMitchell Field NY\n\nMutual Network\n\n15 Jan 1945\n\nSet 7\n\nPop Songs on 1930s Radio\n\nThe You And Me That Used To Be\n\nGeorge Hall Orchestra\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nNew York City\n\n1937\n\nWhen Summer Is Gone (theme) + You’ve Got Me Crying Again\n\nHal Kemp Orchestra\n\n’Lavena Program’\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nNew York City\n\n1934\n\nChlo-e\n\nBenny Goodman Orchestra\n\n’Camel Caravan’\n\nKNX CBS LA\n\n17 Aug 1937\n\nThe Little Man Who Wasn’t There\n\nJohnny Messner Orchestra\n\n’Radio Transcription’\n\nNew York City\n\n1939\n\nSet 8\n\nModern Improvised Jazz on 1950s Radio\n\nThe Cinch + I Don’t Want To Be Kissed\n\nBuddy Rich Quintet\n\nBirdland\n\nWABC ABC NY\n\n8 Nov 1958\n\nThe 7-11 Jump\n\nErroll Garner Trio\n\nBasin Street\n\nWCBS CBS New York City\n\nMay 1956\n\nAll The Things You Are\n\nDave Brubeck Quartet\n\nBasin Street\n\nWCBS CBS New York City\n\nFeb 1956\n\nCARDBOARD RECORDS\n\nThis week’s Greg Poppleton Phantom Dancer feature is a set of famous cardboard records from 1931.

(The company that brought out Hit of the Week records also produced low cost advertising discs).\n\n2. All of the records were recorded on one side only.\n\nThe playing side of the cardboard records was coated with Durium, a lightweight synthetic resin. The unrecorded side was uncoated and the unprotected cardboard absorbed moisture from the air. Therefore the discs have a propensity to curl. They now often require the use of a clip or weight around the turntable spindle to keep them flat during play.\n\nApart from some low-frequency rumble due to their texture, Hit of the Week audio fidelity was equal to or better than most ordinary shellac records., as you’ll hear in Set 4 of this week’s Phantom Dancer.\n\nA few releases had the performer’s portrait printed on the uncoated paper side, or were imprinted there with advertising matter. They were issued in flimsy rice paper sleeves, few of which have survived.\n\nA new issue featuring a current hit song was released every week. They were sold at newsstands. Previous issues could be obtained by mail order. Retailing for 15 cents each, later raised to 20 cents, Hit of the Week records were by far the lowest-priced records in the US at that time.\n\nBOOM AND BUST\n\nThe first regular issue was released in February 1930.\n\nBy mid 1930, up to half a million copies of each week’s issue were produced. But sales quickly slumped as the Depression worsened.\n\nIn March 1931 the company went into receivership and in May it was purchased by the Erwin, Wasey & Company advertising agency. They debuted a new format debuted in August, featuring two songs or dance tunes on each single-sided disc and a total playing time of about five minutes, but the label remained unprofitable.\n\nThe final Hit of the Week issue was released in June 1932.\n\nAfter the demise of the label, some limited use was made of smaller (often only four inches in diameter) records made of the same material, mostly for giveaway advertising novelties. Specimens of one of the most common advertising records, which invited the recipient to come see the new 1932 Chevrolet automobile, are usually found with a mailing label and postage on the uncoated back side.\n\nMusicians who recorded for Hit of the Week included Gene Austin, Duke Ellington (under the pseudonym “Harlem Hot Chocolates”), Ben Pollack, Eddie Cantor (on a special 25 cent “Durium De Luxe” issue), Morton Downey, and Rudy Vallée. Most of the arrangements were performed by studio musicians in New York, led by Adrian Schubert, Bert Hirsch, Vincent Lopez, Don Voorhees and Phil Spitalny.\n\nJazz solos by instrumental stars including Bunny Berrigan, Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang enlivened some recordings.\n\nTwo of the recordings on this week’s Phantom Dancer are tailed with football songs, trying to appeal to the young, male university market.\n\nThe vocalists who recorded with the studio bands included several popular radio singers of the day including Ralph Kirbery and Helen Rowland.\n\nIn the UK, a similar series was issued on the Durium label with songs by Al Bowlly and more.\n\nVIDEO\n\nThis week’s Phantom Dancer video of the week is from the late 1940s, an unidentified woman reading to paper tape.

It’s the Dixieland and ragtime jazz styles of the early 20th century which typically used a front line of trumpet, clarinet, and trombone.\n\nREVIVAL\n\nA Dixieland revival began in the United States on the West Coast in the late 1930s as a backlash to the Chicago style, which was close to swing. Lu Watters and the Yerba Buena Jazz Band, and trombonist Turk Murphy, adopted the repertoire of Joe “King” Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong and W. C. Handy: bands included banjo and tuba in the rhythm sections. A New Orleans-based traditional revival began with the later recordings of Jelly-Roll Morton and the rediscovery of Bunk Johnson in 1942, leading to the founding of Preservation Hall in the French Quarter during the 1960s.\n\nEarly King Oliver pieces exemplify this style of hot jazz; however, as individual performers began stepping to the front as soloists, a new form of music emerged. One of the ensemble players in King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band, Louis Armstrong, was by far the most influential of the soloists, creating, in his wake, a demand for this “new” style of jazz, in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Other influential stylists who are still revered in traditional jazz circles today include Sidney Bechet, Bix Beiderbecke, Wingy Manone and Muggsy Spanier. Many artists of the big band era, including Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa and Benny Goodman, had their beginnings in trad jazz.\n\nOn this week’s Phantom Dancer, you’ll hear Trad and Chicago style is Set 4 by the Bob Crosby Bobcats, Eddie Condon and Red Nichols direct from 1929 radio\n\nThe last hour is all vinyl.\n\nYour Phantom Dancer Video of the Week this week is: Westend Blues featuring Bob Barnard on trumpet and Lawrie Thompson, drums.
