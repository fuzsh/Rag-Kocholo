Forest Whitaker stars as brilliant jazz saxophonist Charlie \"Bird\" Parker in Academy Award-winning director Clint Eastwood's homage to Bird's life and genius. Charlie Parker pushes the boundaries of jazz, always ahead of the musical sensibilities of his time--and never willing to compromise his artistry. Wrestling with his twin demons, alcohol and drug abuse, he struggles to gain acceptance for his music. But neither his talent nor the love of his devoted wife, Chan, is enough to save Bird from a tragically untimely death at the age of 34.",

        "text": "Sure, the music is great, but it should have been placed in political and historical context. Bird did not wage the cultural revolution alone, nor did he fall from out of the sky.\n\nNovember 14, 2023\n\nAside from Lennie Niehaus' superb work as musical supervisor... and Forest Whitaker and Diane Venora's performances in the lead roles, all you get are clich√©s and the film's superficial response to an artist's descent into self-destruction.\n\nMay 8, 2023\n\nPeople who don't like jazz often complain it's overlong, complicated, noodling, and meandering. These criticisms can all be leveled at director Clint Eastwood's Bird, who, unlike a jazz master, doesn't back up his work with any inventive flair.\n\nDecember 1, 2021\n\nIt is only thanks to Whitaker's performance, which won him a Golden Globe, that we are truly able to bond with Bird and truly care about his lifelong challenges.\n\nSeptember 3, 2020\n\nEastwood directed Bird in much the same way he plays jazz piano-not with caution, not with precision, but with a love that is supreme.\n\nFebruary 12, 2020\n\nWhat the film pulls off is the difficult fusion of this kind of accuracy with larger 'truths' which are no respecter of accuracy.\n\nMarch 27, 2020\n\n\"Bird'' is a movie that demands your full attention, refusing to yield all its meanings if you sit back and let it wash over you.\n\nDecember 11, 2018\n\nIn this movie and its hot, fast bursts of bop, Charlie Parker gets a fitting elegy.\n\nDecember 11, 2018"
