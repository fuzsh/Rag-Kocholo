        "text": "Full text preview\n\nJohn P McCombe\n\nDespite Hollywood, jazz cannot be adequately portrayed nor adequately described. For to describe it contains it and it cannot be contained. Certainly not by the four sides of a picture's frame. Jazz cannot be contained. It flies free . (Spence43)\n\nDespite his descent into hyperbole, Kenneth Spencedoes remind us that the relationship between jazz and the cinema has often been contentious. When Spence'sessay appeared in Film Comment in 1988, many hoped that the end of the century would yield better fortunes for the jazz film, a moment marked by the arrival of major Hollywood productions such as Bertrand Tavernier's Round Midnight (1986) and Clint Eastwood's Bird (1988). However, the reality was that many of the conventions of the jazz biopic outlined by Spencewere all too familiar in the late 1980s:\n\nSet up the creative artistic genius as a cultural icon in as simple a manner as possible. Let the new musical ''discoveries'' be that of an individual effort, found in isolation. Avoid talking about social conditions (much less depict them), and for the most part, wrap up the film with a happy marriage or at least some nice lighting effects. (Spence38)"
