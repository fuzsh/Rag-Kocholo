        "meta_description": "In his film Kansas City, Robert Altman sought to capture the feel of KC in its wide-open heyday—the 1930’s. A time when jazz filled the air, Prohibition was overlooked and political bosses ruled the streets. No place during that time period was as vibrant and exciting as 18th and Vine.",

        "text": "Kansas City\n\nWhen Altman returned to KC in the ‘90s, he found that this area, which was once a hub for art and culture, had been slowly deteriorating. Altman wanted to recreate the neighborhood that had fascinated him in his teenage years.\n\nThe film crew cleaned up the street, creating storefront facades and dressing the windows of then-closed businesses. What’s incredible about this transformation is its lasting impact on the city. Altman’s storefront facades still line the streets of this famous district, which is uncommon, considering most sets from studio productions barely survive days after a film has wrapped, let alone more than two decades.\n\nTurns out that “Pearl Pickens Dress Shop” isn’t real. Not to mention “Owl Bar-B-Q”, “Lucille's Paradise Dinette” and “Paseo Bootery,” which were all created for Altman’s production and remain as imaginary storefronts.\n\nBird\n\nThe 18th & Vine District is home not only to storefront time capsules but to a vibrant music scene and two incredible museums—the American Jazz Museum and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.\n\nBoth jazz and the Negro Leagues have had a significant impact on Kansas City and the country. So it should come as no surprise that Hollywood has explored these American institutions, and likewise, Kansas City.\n\nOne of Kansas City’s most famous jazz sons was alto saxophone player Charlie “Bird” Parker. To this day, Parker is regarded as one of the most influential saxophone players and jazz musicians to ever play.\n\nWith a career so iconic and a life so tumultuous, it’s no wonder Clint Eastwood wanted to make a film about the artist. The film Bird, released in 1988 and starring future Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker, follows the rise and eventual fall of this jazz legend, but at the heart of it all is Kansas City.\n\nThe film would go on to win an Oscar for Best Sound and Eastwood would win the Golden Globe for Best Director. Meanwhile, Whitaker was awarded the Best Actor award at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. Visit the American Jazz Museum to see just how important both jazz and Charlie Parker were in shaping Kansas City.\n\nNegro Leagues Baseball Museum\n\nJust across the way you’ll find yourself at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, another institution that helped to shape Kansas City. Before the integration of Major League Baseball, black players faced off against one another in games that showcased the talent and skill of some of the game’s all-time greats.\n\nKansas City was home to the KC Monarchs, the two-time Negro Leagues World Series Champions and first ball club for the most influential players of all time—Jackie Robinson. Before he broke the color barrier in 1947 by signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers, the hall of famer played right here in KC.\n\nThe 2013 film 42, starring Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford, chronicles Robinson's historic transition to the majors, and begins with his time here as the star player for the Monarchs. The production held a special premiere of the film in KC to honor the Negro Leagues Museum and Kansas City’s role in Robinson’s career.\n\nHead into the museum and you’ll find yourself viewing a short documentary about the history of this groundbreaking league—and don’t be surprised if you recognize an iconic voice narrating the film. James Earl Jones, the actor who portrayed Darth Vader (the galaxy’s greatest villain in the Star Wars franchise), voiced Mufasa from Lion King, and starred in Field of Dreams, lends his iconic voice to this inspirational documentary."
