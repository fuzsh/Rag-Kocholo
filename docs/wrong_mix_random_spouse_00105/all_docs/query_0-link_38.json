It is Wednesday night, 10 August 1988, the second night of a six-night engagement of the Milt Jackson Quartet. Joining the famed vibraphonist are pianist Cedar Walton, bassist John Clayton, and drummer Billy Higgins. Well before the start of the 9 p.m. set the club fills with musicians and laymen. (Before the night ends, Monty Alexander, Buddy Collette, Slide Hampton, John Heard, Art Hillery, and other players will drop by to hear their colleagues.) When the musicians enter they take their places on the band platform, looking happy and well dressed (in the 1980s, suits and ties became common jazz concert attire again, even in casual Southern California). They play one great piece after another: a standard, a ballad, a blues, a series of Thelonious Monk pieces, and so on for one and a half hours. Clearly the four men are having a wonderful time playing for and with one another, and the audience members are the grateful beneficiaries of the musicians' mutual joy. Jackson's rhythmically ingenious, bluesy melodies inspire frequent joyous outbursts from the audience. Walton's broad harmonic palette and endless supply of tongue-in-cheek song quotes heighten everyone's pleasure. Clayton's luscious, singing arco tone when he plays 'Round Midnight and Django is awe-inspiring; toward the end of the Django solo Jackson shakes his head in disbelief and says \"Amazing!\" softly to himself. And smiling Billy Higgins (does anyone else have more fun playing jazz?), one of the world's most sensitive and telepathic drummers, shapes and guides the progress of each piece. The set ends with the inevitable Bags' Groove, Jackson's bestknown melody. It has been an electric set of acoustic jazz, as verified by the damp but happy faces of the players and the prolonged applause of the audience. It was bebop at its finest, played by master musicians in their prime, and played for a racially and chronologically mixed audi-\n\nviii\n\nPREFACE\n\nence of enthusiastic supporters. Surely bebop was alive and well in Los Angeles in 1988! The evening described above is but a microcosm of bebop in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Jackson is one of several pioneer players who are still active. Walton and Higgins represent the players who expanded the vocabulary in the 1950s and 1960s, and Clayton epitomizes the large group of gifted players born in the 1950s and 1960s who maintain the tradition with passion, skill, and inventiveness. Bebop, with three generations of practitioners, is a flourishing jazz style in the 1990s, just as it was in 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Bebop, first established in the early and middle 1940s in New York City by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Kenny Clarke, Max Roach, Ray Brown, and a few others, is now, after half a century of evolution, a diversified jazz language, spoken by hundreds of internationally prominent musicians. This analogical reference to language is hardly new. Westerners have called music an \"international language\" for generations, and jazz musicians often speak of \"telling a story\" when they play. Barry Velleman makes this suggestion: Much of the enchantment of jazz results from its similarities to conventional spoken language. Although not lacking in errors and hesitations, spoken language is often more dynamic than the cautious, elaborated written form. We can compare normal conversation to jazz improvisation through its individualism, creativity, endless possibility, spontaneity, thematic continuity, and inherent imperfection. (Velleman 1978: 31)\n\nIn a similar vein, Perlman and Greenblatt argue that the harmonic and melodic constraints a jazz musician deals with are \"in many ways analogous to the syntactic and semantic constraints of natural language and that playing an improvised solo is very much like speaking sentences.\" (Perlman & Greenblatt 1981: 169) The analogy between music and language does not include musical equivalents for verbs, nouns, and tenses, but each musical style does have its vocabulary of rhythmic, melodic, harmonic, textural, and timbral elements that all members of an ensemble must share if they are to make excellent music within the style. One of my main goals in this book is to explicate that vocabulary as it occurs in bebop. In the course of this explication, references to Charlie Parker's personal style abound. Because of his position as the most important role model in early bebop, I have written a relatively detailed summary of his style in Chapter 3. This summary, in turn, is the basis for the discussions of many other players throughout the book.\n\nPREFACE\n\nix\n\nMy other main goal is to discuss the individual styles of the most important bebop players. Sometimes that goal was easy to pursue. Every jazz historian agrees that the seven bebop pioneers listed earlier (Parker, Gillespie, Monk, and so on) played vital roles in establishing the idiom. And there are younger players that also would appear on any writer's list of important beboppers. Conversely, every writer would agree that some major figures are not part of the bebop world. Thus, they assign Count Basie and Benny Carter to the swing style, though these men made many fine recordings with bebop groups. The task becomes difficult, agonizingly difficult, when selecting the bebop players to omit. There are many hundreds of first-rate bebop musicians in the world; they deserve space in a book devoted to their music. But this book is a survey, not an encyclopedia. To treat fairly George Coleman, Buddy Collette, Junior Cook, Bob Cooper, Allen Eager, Booker Ervin, Joe Farrell, Frank Foster, Benny Golson, Eddie Harris, Tubby Hayes, Jimmy Heath, Joe Henderson, Buck Hill, Red Holloway, Plas Johnson, Clifford Jordan, Richie Kamuca, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Harold Land, Yusef Lateef, Charles Lloyd, James Moody, Oliver Nelson, Sal Nistico, Bill Perkins, Herman Riley, Ronnie Scott, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Stewart, Lew Tabackin, Grover Washington, Ernie Watts, Frank Wess, and the other tenor saxophonists that I have either omitted entirely or treated in a cursory fashion,1 I would have to write a book just on bebop tenor saxophonists. And then there would be other books to write on alto saxophonists, trumpeters, and so on. If I have delineated a representative array of individual styles in this overview of the bebop language, then I have done what I set out to do. Writers can discern the boundary between swing and bebop, and can point out the swing and bebop elements in early 1940s recordings, with relative ease. But the ending limit of the bebop idiom is more difficult to define, and writers have reached no general agreement on the matter. Some would restrict bebop to many, but not all, of the young players of the 1940s. On the other hand, A. B. Spellman extends the style to include Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor (Spellman 1966). Some say that Miles Davis was a \"cool\" player, not a bebop player. Others would say he was a bebopper until the late 1950s or early 1960s, when he moved into \"modal,\" or \"vamp style\" jazz (Kernfeld 1981). Or perhaps his bands left bebop in the middle 1960s, with pieces close stylistically to those of Ornette Coleman, or at the end of the 1960s, with the adoption of rock elements into the musical mix. My position on these matters unfolds throughout the book. Whether you accept or reject my view that a certain piece, player, or ensemble is within the bebop world, I hope you will agree that the music and musicians I\n\nx\n\nPREFACE\n\ndiscuss are worth discussing. Jazz is a world of great beauty, and if that beauty reaches you it should not matter what label we affix to it (or, as Gertrude Stein said, \"... a rose . . .\"). This book is by no means a comprehensive survey of bebop. I have not lived long enough to have heard all the relevant recordings. Indeed,' no one could possibly listen to, evaluate, and analyze everything in the vast literature of this music. Many readers doubtless will wonder why I omitted this or that recording. The omission may be a result of consciously selecting something else that I like better, or of selecting one that better suits the narrative of the moment. Or I may not know the recording in question. But usually jazz recordings represent arbitrary slices of the players' musical lives, and the jazz world attaches an importance to specific recordings that may have little or nothing to do with the players themselves. For example, Charlie Parker's Koko and Miles Davis's So What are important primarily because they were so widely imitated, not because they were intrinsically better than dozens of other recorded solos by these artists. Had I left out the discussions of those two performances my descriptions of Parker's and Davis's styles and their importance to jazz would be no different. Some jazz history books place primary emphasis on the early recordings of far too many players. Jazz is a complex music that requires time and maturity to master. Often the best work of players comes during his/her middle or late years; Benny Carter, Duke Ellington, Johnny Hodges, Sidney Bechet, and others come to mind from earlier style periods. In the world of bebop, Dexter Gordon, Milt Jackson, Gil Evans, Hank Jones, Tommy Flanagan, Lee Konitz, and Phil Woods are but a few who have recorded their best work years after making their initial marks in the international jazz world. For example, the album Stan Getz recorded during the week preceding his 50th birthday far surpassed anything he did during his twenties. I have tried to focus upon both the later and the earlier works of these great creators. The large central portion of the book, Chapters 3 through 9, presents players grouped according to their principal instruments. Leonard Feather (1957) and Joachim Berendt (1959) used a similar plan in their historical overviews of jazz, and Ira Gitler (1966) used it to discuss players of the 1940s. An additional model was the instrumentation of a typical bebop band: alto or tenor saxophone (Chapters 3 to 5), trumpet (Chapter 6), piano (Chapter 7), bass and drums (Chapter 8). These chapters on individual instrumentalists lead to Chapter 10, which focuses on some of the great ensemble performances of bebop. The final chapter is an overview of young bebop players, most of whom were born in the 1960s and 1970s, whose greatest work may well occur in the 21st century.\n\nPREFACE\n\nxi\n\nI fear that some will read this book without listening to the music under discussion. Words are dismally inadequate substitutes for the actual music. The notated examples are closer to the real thing, but are also inadequate no matter how carefully written, and are far too short and restricted to convey a sense of the complete performance. I hope that readers will use this book as a tour guide for exploring some of the greatest jazz ever recorded. Such an exploration takes dedication, time, and (unless you have some friends who collect jazz recordings) money. But the rewards go far beyond the monetary. Those of us who carry in our inner ears and memories listening experiences such as those described at the beginning of this preface and throughout the book are rich in ways that really matter.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI owe a debt of gratitude to many people for help of various kinds: To the Owenses—Karen, Holly, Scott, and Steve—for their forbearance during the past few years; To Sheldon Meyer, the supervising editor of this book (and many others over the years); he is a great cheerleader, an unbelievably patient man, and a gentleman; To Joellyn Ausanka, my associate editor, for attending to the many matters, small and large, connected with getting this book into print; To Stephanie Sakson, my copy editor, for her great skill in catching missing hyphens, misused prepositions, misplaced modifiers, and much more; To the members of the Department of Ethnomusicology at UCLA, for offering me a visiting professorship during 1991-92; the lighter teaching load provided much needed extra time for work on this book; To Theodore Dennis Brown, for letting me use information from his dissertation in Chapter 8; To Betty Price at UCLA and to Roger Quadhamer and Susan Dever at El Camino College, for giving me access to institutional laser printers to generate preliminary versions of this book; To UCLA students Fred Samia and Ethan Schwartz, for their proofreading skills; To Mel Gilbert and Joanna Bosse of Mark of the Unicorn, for their help with Mosaic, the notation program I used for the musical examples; To Gene Midyett, Charles Moore, and Gabe Kreisworth, for loaning some important recordings to me from their personal collections, and to Gabe for guiding me to some important players that I would have overlooked; To Safford Chamberlain, for sharing his insights into Warne Marsh's music; To Bill Green, for his valuable explanations of saxophone techniques and equipment;\n\nxiv\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nTo Bobby Shew, for his equally valuable explanations of trumpet techniques and equipment; To John Clayton, for his generous help with bassists and bass techniques, and to Richard Simon, for his equally generous help and for filling my ears with thousands of great bass lines during hundreds of rehearsals and gigs; To Gary Frommer, for his help with drummers and drumming techniques, and much more; during the countless jobs we have played together he has taught me more about jazz than any other person in my life.

It was just modern music, we would call it. We wouldn't call it anything, really, just music. (Kenny Clarke1) In the Onyx Club [1944], we played a lot of original tunes that didn't have titles. . . . I'd say, \"Dee-da-pa-n-de-bop . . .\" and we'd go into it. People, when they'd wanna ask for one of those numbers and didn't know the name, would ask for bebop. And the press picked it up and started calling it bebop. (Dizzy Gillespie2) [Bebop is] trying to play clean and looking for the pretty notes. (Charlie Parker3) The word \"bop\" is a most inadequate word. . . . (Ralph Ellison4) Let's not call it bebop. Let's call it music. (Charlie Parker5)\n\nParker's suggestion in that last quote is understandable, but modern man seldom settles for such broad, generalized categories. We subdivide things, then subdivide the subdivisions. Thus jazz, already a subdivision of African-American music, has its early jazz, classic jazz, New Orleans jazz, dixieland, Chicago dixieland, swing, prebop, bebop (also known as rebop or bop), cool, progressive jazz, West Coast jazz, East Coast jazz, hard bop, funky jazz, free jazz, freebop, fusion, and more. Admittedly, several of these terms are synonyms, but jazz does have its subcategories, and one of them is bebop. Although it is a silly-sounding name, originating from linguistically meaningless vocables used by jazz musicians,6 it is here to stay as the label for a primary jazz style. When bebop was new, many jazz musicians and most of the jazz audience heard it as radical, chaotic, bewildering music. But time and familiarity softened and even eliminated the objections. The firstgeneration beboppers became senior citizens enjoying worldwide acclaim. They inspired many great bebop musicians worldwide, musicians young enough to be their children and grandchildren. Each generation\n\n4\n\nBEBOP: THE MUSIC AND ITS PLAYERS\n\nof players has added to this musical vocabulary without altering its basic syntax. Bebop, in fact, is now the lingua franca of jazz, serving as the principal musical language of thousands of jazz musicians. It also affects the way earlier jazz styles are played, and is the parent language of many action jazz (\"free jazz\") and fusion players, who from time to time return to the idiom, not to parody it but to honor it and to reaffirm their musical roots. During the 1930s and early 1940s the predominant jazz style was swing. Swing, a dance-oriented style, typically was played in ballrooms by big bands of fourteen or more musicians (though small swing groups played in clubs). Swing rhythm sections provided a solid, basic accompaniment, built largely of long quarter-note strings embellished by the standard high-hat pattern:\n\nSwing harmonies cen-\n\ntered around mildly dissonant chords such as dominant sevenths, dominant ninths, and major and minor triads with added sixths. These harmonies supported the largely diatonic melodies of riff-dominated jazz tunes and of popular songs. These themes most often were either 12-measure blues songs or 32-measure melodies in aaba or abac form. The arrangement often was more interesting than the theme, for arrangers ingeniously altered the dull rhythms of popular songs, passed around the melody among the trumpet, trombone, and sax sections, created background patterns (often riffs) to be played during solo passages, and added original introductions, interludes, and codas to dress up the choruses. Often the arrangements left only short and discontinuous passages for solo improvisations, though Count Basic's band and a few others regularly emphasized solos more than written passages, especially in public performances. The first bebop recordings, which appeared in the mid 1940s, offered striking contrasts to the norms of the swing style. The music, mostly played by small groups (quartets, quintets, sextets), was generally more complex. In particular, bebop rhythm sections, using varied on- and off-beat chordal punctuations (known as comping) supplied by pianists and guitarists, and additional punctuations supplied by the drummer on drums and cymbals, were much more polyrhythmic than were swing rhythm sections. Also, bebop harmonies were more dissonant and the melodies improvised upon these harmonies were more chromatic and less symmetrical rhythmically. Bebop themes, while mostly 12-measure blues and 32-measure melodies in aaba form (just as in swing), often were more chromatic, disjunct, and rhythmically complicated. On the other hand, bebop arrangements were simpler than the often intricate arrangements of swing bands. The typical bebop arrange-\n\nTHE B E G I N N I N G S\n\n5\n\nment consisted of an improvised piano introduction, a theme chorus (played in unison by groups containing two or three wind instruments), a series of improvised solo choruses, and a closing theme statement. This simple design gave maximum emphasis to improvised melodies and to the rhythmic and harmonic interplay between soloist and rhythm section. In the late 1930s and early 1940s swing was extremely popular in the United States; many commercial recording artists of the time were either jazz musicians themselves or had close ties with the jazz world. The American public was familiar and comfortable with big-band swing. But the complexities of bebop bewildered most of this audience. When the first bebop recordings came out in 1944-45, the new music seemed to have come from nowhere. A national strike by the American Federation of Musicians against the recording industry from 1942 to 1944 precluded the recording of performances that might have shown the new style gradually evolving from the old.7 Today we can look back and recognize traces of this evolution in the studio recordings made before and immediately after the strike. Also, some private recordings made during that period and released on LP years later supply some missing evolutionary links. Bebop clearly had a firm foundation in the swing style that preceded it; several musical components are common to both styles. One swing element that bebop adopted was the tritone substitution—in essence, replacing the V7 chord with a dominant seventh on scale-degree 2, a tritone (three whole steps) away. Thus, in the key of C, the fundamental progression G7-C becomes D^-C. (Both chords in these progressions commonly contain one or two enriching notes such as the ninth, the augmented eleventh, or the thirteenth.) Duke Ellington built this substitution into some of his arrangements. Pianist Art Tatum used it in his florid reharmonizations of popular standard songs, and saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, trumpeter Roy Eldridge, and clarinetist Benny Goodman acknowledged it in their improvised melodies, most often by playing the melodic line ^9-8 or *\" 9-7-8. Bebop players regarded V7 and t ll 7 as interchangeable, and used the ^9-7-8 figure repeatedly. Soon they applied this little chromatic encircling figure to the third and fifth of the chord as well (see Charlie Parker's Fig. 5A in Chapter 3, p. 32). Several other melodic figures came to bebop from swing. One occasionally used by Hawkins became a common phrase beginning—a rising triplet arpeggio preceded by a lower neighbor (Fig. 1A in Chapter 3). Saxophonist Lester Young also used the rising arpeggio but reconfigured it rhythmically so that the goal of arrival was lower than the\n\n6\n\nB E B O P : THE M U S I C AMI ITS P L A Y E R S\n\nhighest note of the arpeggio (Fig. IB in Chapter 3). Another pattern was a simple ornament, the inverted mordent (Fig. 2A in Chapter 3). Hawkins and Young used (and Young eventually abused) this simple figure. Short chromatic ascents and descents consisting of two, three, or four half-steps (Figs. 4A-F in Chapter 3) appeared in solos by Hawkins, Young, Eldridge, guitarist Charlie Christian, and others. Occasionally swing players used a figure involving a rising dominant-minor-ninth arpeggio (Fig. 3 in Chapter 3), and a four-note chromatic encircling figure (Fig. SB in Chapter 3), both of which became extremely common in the bebop vocabulary. Vibratos are usually slower in bebop than in swing; on the average, bebop vibratos are about 4.7 oscillations per second, swing vibratos about 5.6 oscillations per second.8 Lester Young, who beboppers admired greatly, was probably the direct inspiration for this slowing. His vibrato speed—about 4.5 oscillations per second—may in turn derive from saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer's (about 4.8 oscillations per second), Young's early role model. Young also was almost certainly the inspiration for the \"beatstretching\" approach to ballads favored by bebop players beginning in the mid-1940s. For a few beats at a time Young would lag slightly behind the beat set by the rhythm section, setting up a subtle rhythmic .tension. It is an effective device when done well. But it can backfire on the player when overdone, as some young players showed in their early attempts to emulate him, and as Young himself proved in his last recordings. The harmonic vocabulary of bebop has a higher level of dissonance than that of swing. Bebop players did not add any dissonant chords to jazz at first, however; they merely used them more frequently than had their predecessors. One need only listen to Ellington's extraordinary Ko-Ko or to Tatum's Body and Soul to realize that the raw materials of bebop harmony were already in place in jazz, ready to be reapplied to the newer idiom.9 The bebop \"revolution\" (a common but suspect description) was primarily rhythmic; bebop rhythm sections produce a more complex, multilayered texture than their swing-era counterparts. One obvious change was the more varied rhythmic role of pianists. Swing pianists often played a striding left hand (imitating the \"oom-pah\" or \"boomchick\" of march accompaniments) and melodies in the right hand while soloing, and a \"boom-chick\" pattern divided between the two hands when accompanying. But Ellington, Count Basie, and Nat Cole sometimes flayed irregularly timed chordal punctuations while accompanying their wind players; that is, they \"comped\" before comping was the\n\nTHE B E G I N N I N G S\n\n7\n\nnorm in jazz. And Basic pioneered in the thin-textured solo style where the left hand plays soft sustained chords or occasional punctuations (\"comping\" again) instead of the automatic and full accompaniments of the ragtime and stride pianists. Basic's solo style, while built around simple chords and lean melodies, laid the foundation for bebop solo. piano texture. In the process he also lightened the texture of the rhythm section, making it easier to hear the bassist's lines. Most swing-style bassists emphasized roots and fifths of chords, or chordal arpeggios, played one note per beat (i.e., IC-C-G-G-ID-D-GG-l, or IC-E-G-A-IC-A-G-E-I).10 But Walter Page in the Basic band and Jimmy Blanton in the Ellington band regularly \"walked\"; that is, they emphasized stepwise motion, which became the norm for bebop bassists. Further, when Blanton played solos—and bass solos were rare in the swing era until this young giant appeared—he played melodic lines reminiscent of wind players, not of bass players. That is, he did not worry about touching on roots of chords, but instead floated his lines above some imaginary bass line. Finally, he found ways of playing pizzicato bass lines in a more legato manner. His tone quality, legato walking bass lines, and solo style were models for the best of the early bebop bassists.11 Bebop drumming was truly a revolution (and a revelation, when recording technology improved enough to capture it properly). The multiple rhythmic layers that many bebop drummers regularly produce differ markedly from the more monorhythmic norms of swing drumming. Yet some bebop rhythms came from earlier drummers. For example, Jo Jones, the great drummer in the Basic band, made exemplary use of the high hat. Not content to play endlessly the standard high-hat pattern\n\nhe created a repertory of small but\n\nimportant variations on it that bebop drummers adapted to the ride cymbal. He, and other swing drummers, occasionally would punctuate the music with snare-drum strokes, rim shots, or bass-drum strokes, a practice extended greatly by bebop drummers. The most important contributions that swing made to bebop, however, were the players themselves. The bebop pioneers, we must remember, grew up listening to swing, and when they began playing they played swing. Dizzy Gillespie's early recordings show no trace of the new idiom; he was a swing player heavily influenced by Roy Eldridge. Charlie Parker's early recordings also reveal a swing style player, albeit one with a distinctive personality. Similarly, Kenny Clarke and other members-to-be of the jazz avant-garde had their early professional experiences as swing-band musicians. They learned the technique, time,\n\n8\n\nB E B O P : T H E M U S I C A N D ITS P L A Y E R S\n\ntone, and improvisation of jazz within the swing tradition. Then gradually, and at first with little or no intent of altering jazz, they modified their manner of playing. Eventually, inevitably, there was a new way to perform improvised African-American instrumental music. Tracing the individual player's musical evolution from swing to bebop is not always easy; for several players it is impossible, since they began recording only after assimilating the new idiom. The clearest trail to follow is Dizzy Gillespie's (see pp. 101-4), for most of the essential recorded landmarks in his early career appear on one beautifully produced anthology, Dizzy Gillespie: The Development of an American Artist, 1940-1946 (Smithsonian Collection R 004-P4-13455), issued in 1976. The lengthiest samples of Gillespie's early style were recorded at Minton's Playhouse, one of two small clubs in New York City's Harlem—the other was Monroe's Uptown House—that served as focal points for the young players formulating the new style. Both clubs featured after-hours jam sessions that attracted traveling and resident musicians. Besides Gillespie, the frequent participants at these sessions were trumpeters Roy Eldridge, Joe Guy (who was in the house band at Minton's), John Carisi, and Hot Lips Page, alto saxophonist Charlie Parker, tenor saxophonist Don Byas, pianists Kenny Kersey, Thelonious Monk (the house pianist at Minton's), Al Tinney (the house pianist at Monroe's), and Mary Lou Williams, guitarist Charlie Christian (who kept an extra amplifier at Minton's to use whenever he arrived in town), bassist Nick Fenton (the house bassist at Minton's), and drummer Kenny Clarke (the house drummer at Minton's). According to contemporary reports by those present, the music at these sessions was small-group swing at first, but gradually changed to something else. Jazz fan Jerry Newman made some recordings on his portable disc recorder in 1941 that provide an imperfect glimpse back into those proceedings. Years later some of these informal recordings were issued commercially.12 Their fidelity is poor and the rhythm sections are seriously undermiked. But they are all we have, for none of these ad hoc groups made any studio recordings. The music in these Minton's recordings is swing, not bebop. Yet Gillespie's solos reveal a player searching for a new way to express himself. Still largely an Eldridge disciple, he nonetheless surprises us here and there with phrases that are foreign to the language of swing. As it turns out they are foreign to his future bebop language, as well. In the example below, from the beginning of his second chorus in Kerouac (based on the chords of Exactly like You), measures 2 through 6 are jarringly unconvincing, surrounded as they are by the tamest of phrases.\n\nTHE B E G I N N I N G S\n\n9\n\nIn a few years he learned to integrate augmented elevenths and altered dominant chords more smoothly into his melodic fabric.13\n\nCharlie Parker's early style, in contrast to Gillespie's, seems to have derived from several sources, no one of them primary. He was a great admirer of Lester Young, some of whose recorded solos he learned notefor-note. A snippet of Young's famous 1936 recording of Oh, Lady Be Good! appears in Parker's 1940 recording of the same piece,14 and a few other traces of Young's music (such as the phrase labeled 2B in Chapter 3) appear in the recordings Parker made in 1940 and 1942 with the Jay McShann band. He also admired alto saxophonist Buster Smith; the two were sidemen in a local band in Kansas City in the late 1930s. Sitting next to Smith night after night apparently had its effect on Parker, for his solo in Moten Swing is remarkably similar in tone quality and some melodic details to Smith's solo recorded three weeks earlier.15 And he obviously listened to Coleman Hawkins, a bit of whose famous Body and Soul recording he quotes in his solo on the same piece.16 In the private recordings he made with Gillespie and Oscar Pettiford (p. 102), he produces a tone quality on the tenor saxophone that is a curious blend of Hawkins's and Young's timbres. Ultimately the more lasting swing traces in Parker's style were a set of melodic formulae. The patterns such as those labeled Figures 1A, IB, 2A, 3, 4A-F, 5 A, and SB on pp. 31-32 were in the air during the late 1930s and early 1940s. Parker must have learned them from several sources, and applied them in his unique way. The key drummer in these early years of experimentation was Kenny Clarke, who played with Gillespie in Teddy Hill's big band and then served as house drummer at Minton's. He preferred to play the standard high-hat pattern on the ride (or top) cymbal. In addition, he stopped automatically playing the bass drum on every beat and began\n\n10\n\nB E B O P : THE M U S I C AND ITS P L A Y E R S\n\nplaying a variety of on- and off-beat punctuations on the bass drum and snare drum (\"bombs\").17 Moving his right hand from the high hat (situated on his left) to his ride cymbal (on his right) gave him more room to maneuver his left hand on the snare drum (directly in front). He abandoned the automatic four-to-the-measure bass-drum habit unexpectedly: Well, I never expected . . . things to turn out the way they did as far as modern drumming is concerned . . . It just happened . . . accidentally. . . . What really brought the whole thing about, we were playing a real fast tune once . . . with Teddy [Hill]. . . . The tempo was too fast to play four beats to the measure, so I began to cut the time up ... But to keep the same rhythm going . . . I had to do it with my hand, because . . . my foot just wouldn't do it. So I started doing it with my hand, and then every once in a while I would kind of lift myself with my foot, to kind of boot myself into it, and that made the whole thing move. So I began to work on that. . . . I played a long time with Diz [Dizzy Gillespie], from 1938 to 1942. Then I left for the Army, and during my absence, Dizzy, who plays the drums well, taught all the other drummers my way of playing.\n\nThese rhythmic changes are hard to hear on records, for drums were served poorly by the microphones and recording machines of the time. On most recordings one can hear only a fraction of what Jo Jones, Kenny Clarke, and others played. Bass drums and ride cymbals are all but inaudible, as are the subtler strokes on high hat and snare drum. Perhaps the best recorded sample of Clarke's work during the transition years is with a quintet led by Sidney Bechet. In the final exuberant choruses of One 0'Clock Jump,1* his off-beat bass-drum punctuations and ride cymbal patterns are unusually clear for recordings at the time. He is not playing bebop, but neither is he playing in the traditional New Orleans or swing styles. It is a fascinating moment. A year later the microphone for the recording machine in Minton's was near the drum set during the piece Swing to Bop,19 and captured a rare sampling of his richly varied and highly interactive playing on snare and bass drums. By 1944 a handful of young players had worked out their new musical vocabulary and were performing regularly, mostly in the small nightclubs on 52nd Street in New York City. During the same year the American Federation of Musicians settled their strike against the recording companies. And so the stage was set for the first recordings of the new jazz.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nEarly Classics\n\nIn the winter of 1943-44, the first small group organized to perform the still-unnamed new music debuted at the Onyx Club on 52nd Street in New York City. It was a quartet, then a quintet, co-led by Dizzy Gillespie and bassist Oscar Pettiford. The other members were pianist George Wallington, drummer Max Roach, and then tenor saxophonist Don Byas.1 The group remained intact only a few months and did not record as a quintet, though some of the members recorded as sidemen for other leaders. Pettiford's solo on Coleman Hawkins recording of The Man I Love was the first bebop bass solo on record.2 Two months later, Gillespie, Pettiford, and Roach recorded six pieces with Hawkins's twelveman ensemble, a big band without trombones (see below). And in April, Gillespie and Pettiford were part of Billy Eckstine's big band when it made its recording debut. Some melodically adventurous unison parts for Eckstine s trumpet section in / Stay in the Mood for You pointed toward the style the band was soon to follow.3 There were a few other recorded samples of the new style. In January, pianist Bud Powell recorded eight pieces with a sextet led by Cootie Williams and four more with Williams's big band. He comped effectively, and in Floogie Boo, I Don't Know, and Honeysuckle Rose he played brief solos using the texture that was to become the norm for bebop pianists: fluid, single-note melodies dominated by strings of two and three-eighth notes per beat in the right hand, and unpredictably timed chordal punctuations in the left.4 Later that year he played a jarringly modern two-chorus solo in the otherwise conservative performance by Williams's big band of Royal Garden Blues.5 And in September, Charlie Parker recorded with a quintet led by guitarist-singer Tiny Grimes (see below). None of these early recordings truly represents bebop, primarily because the young players were outnumbered sidemen\n\n12\n\nBEBOP: THE M U S I C AND ITS P L A Y E R S\n\nand not leaders. But they do help to paint a sketchy picture of how the new style emerged. The real bebop revolution (or evolution, as Gillespie preferred to say) was in the rhythm section. Recording techniques of the 1940s still captured only partially the sound of the string bass and drum set, so aural evidence of early changes in rhythm-section playing is skimpy. Art Blakey's playing in Blowing the Blues Away and Opus X by the Eckstine band is one of the least murky recordings of early bebop drumming.6 During part of each piece Blakey's ride-cymbal pattern and snare-drum fills project reasonably well and, combined with pianist John Malachi's modest amount of comping, provide an early recorded sample of a bebop rhythm section. The early recordings preserve the repertoire better than the performance techniques; one example is Gillespie's piece Woody 'n' You. He first recorded it with Coleman Hawkins in 1944, and soon it became a bebop standard.7 It is 32 measures long, subdivided into aaba form — the most common form used in the 1930s and 1940s for popular songs. The a section consists of three two-measure sequences on ii-V chords, ending on the tonic (D1\"); its harmonic plan is\n\nThe alternation between the half-diminished ii chords (one of Gillespie's favorite harmonic sonorities) and the dominant seventh-raised ninth V chords is a pungent mix of dissonances that appealed to the young modernists. Also appealing was the little figure involving scale steps *\" 9-7-8 (Fig. 5A on page 32, common to both styles) at the end of each a section. The only other bebop touch in this recording, however, was Gillespie's solo, with several of his favorite melodic gestures (see pp. 102-3). The forward-looking rhythm section (Pettiford, Roach, and pianist Clyde Hart) is too poorly recorded to reveal much beyond basic time-keeping. The dominating sonority in the record is the warm, vibrato-laden sound of swing-style saxophones. Similar comments on style apply to Parker's only- recording session of 1944. He was the lone bebop player in Tiny Grimes's quintet when Grimes recorded Tiny's Tempo (a blues), Red Cross (based on the chords of / Got Rhythm), and two pieces that feature Grimes's singing.8 Two aspects of this session are important to the early history of bebop. First, there are multiple takes of each of the four pieces, which provide a new perspective on Parker's skill as an improviser. His three different solos on Tiny's Tempo and two different solos on Red Cross are largely differ-\n\nEARLY CLASSICS\n\n13\n\nent from one another, showing that his command of the idiom was thorough and secure. He had no need for a worked-out, memorized solo. Second, the two all-instrumental pieces were prophetic, for the blues and the / Got Rhythm harmonic structures became the most common harmonic plans in bebop during the late 1940s. Entire recording dates by some leaders (not Gillespie or Parker) were devoted to these two harmonic structures. Further progress in documenting the new style came in early 1945, mostly in small group sessions led by Gillespie. First, Gillespie's sextet recorded four pieces, the most forward-looking being Tadd Dameron's Good Bait.9 Here, besides Gillespie's modern solo lines, are Clyde Hart's creditable comping, Pettiford's short bebop solo, and an inventive and complex second theme played in unison in the final chorus. In the other three pieces the stylistic balance still favors swing. Nonetheless, Salt Peanuts is the first recording of Gillespie's humorous classic, Be-Bop officially acknowledges the new name for the new music; and / Can't Get Started shows us Gillespie's important reharmonization of this popular song (discussed on page 103).I0 In January 1945, Gillespie recorded several pieces with Boyd Raeburn's big band, which was exploring bebop in the mid-1940s. The most important result of this temporary partnership was the Latintinged A Night in Tunisia,\" a piece that Gillespie had written in 1942 and arranged for Earl Hines's big band. Cast in the usual aaba mold, its most ear-catching features are its chord-derived main motive—\n\n—and its insistent use of the ''Il-i harmonic relationship (Etl3-DMi), the tritone substitution. The a section ends with V7-i, but the E^-D relationship moves into the melody, in the form of the ^9-7-8 figure that Gillespie brought with him from his Eldridge-inspired early style. Once the theme ends, the band abandons the Latin rhythms and plays a 12measure interlude that has been integral to the piece ever since. Gillespie's flashy two-bar solo break leads into his solo chorus, during which we can hear Shelly Manne's ride-cymbal pattern and snare drum fills. There will be better recordings of Gillespie's fine piece in future years, among them septet versions by Gillespie and by Parker, recorded a year later.12 But this one, the parent recording of the rest, is a respectable beginning.\n\n14\n\nB E B O P : THE M U S I C AND ITS P L A Y E R S\n\nIn February, Gillespie led two different sextet recordings of Groovin' High.13 The second is the better of the two, and is the first famous bebop recording. Here performing together are the two leading bebop spokesmen, Gillespie and Parker. Granted, their rhythm section, except for the timidly comping pianist Clyde Hart, is swing-oriented. But the nature of the theme, the primary soloists, and the fame of this piece make this an early bebop classic. First, the theme. Filled with explicit outlines of the ii-V progression in three different keys and of the iii7-''iii7-ii7 progression, it is significantly more complex than the typical swing-era theme. It has a stronger inner logic, derived from the frequent pairing of a simple twonote figure and a two-measure string of eighth notes:\n\nThe Groovin' High melody, an excellent and popular theme from the early years, is also a prime example of a common compositional procedure in early bebop. Gillespie built this engaging melody (officially he wrote it with Kirby Stone) to fit with the chords of Whispering, a popular song of the 1920s. By 1945 the use of a pre-existent chord structure was hardly new; there are many pieces in the swing repertory based on the chords of Tiger Rag, I Got Rhythm, and other earlier pieces. (For that matter, someone must have been the first to write the 12-measure blues chord structure, the basis for thousands of compositions.) But at that time Gillespie's melodic contrafact14 was the most complex jazz melody superimposed on a pre-existing chordal scheme. The arrangement is atypically elaborate for bebop performances, with its composed six-measure introduction (most bebop introductions are improvised and run four or eight measures), its modulations (most bebop pieces stay in one key), its choruses of varying lengths, and its dramatic half-speed coda. The performance is overly segmented because the soloists have only a half-chorus each; they play well, but they have too little time to express themselves. Two other pieces emerged from this second Groovin' High session:\n\nEARLY CLASSICS\n\n15\n\nAll the Things You Are and Dizzy Atmosphere. The first is a fragmented and lackluster performance of Jerome Kern's popular song. Its most lasting feature is its eight-measure introduction and coda, built upon two chords:\n\nGillespie derived this introduction from his arrangement of Good Jelly Blues, which he wrote for Billy Eckstine's big band.15 Ever since this early 1945 recording session, Gillespie's introduction has been a permanent feature of jazz performances of All the Things You Are. Dizzy Atmosphere is more spirited, and features excellent full-chorus solos by Parker and Gillespie. The rhythm section even approximates the bebop style, with drummer Cozy Cole playing the ride-cymbal pattern and some well-intentioned snare-drum fills. The theme is a simple and repetitive tune in aaba form, with the a section based on the a of / Got Rhythm and the b section based on chromatically descending dominant sevenths. But the nicest surprise of the recording is, as in Good Bait a year earlier, a second theme that Parker and Gillespie play in unison during most of the last chorus. Unlike the riff-filled main theme, it is inventive and varied, matching more closely the melodic styles used when these men improvised. The next landmark record date occurred in May, when Gillespie and Parker recorded the definitive versions of Salt Peanuts and Hot House. For these pieces they used the model bebop quintet instrumentation: trumpet, saxophone, piano, bass, and drums. Four of the players played important roles in defining and consolidating the new style: Parker, Gillespie, pianist Al Haig, and bassist Curley Russell. Only drummer Sid Catlett is of the older school. Still, he adapts creditably to bebop on Hot House, and his drive and musicality are strong enough on Salt Peanuts to override the stylistic discrepancies. Both themes are melodic contrafacts: Salt Peanuts is based on the chords of / Got Rhythm, and Hot House on Cole Porter's What Is This Thing Called Love? The melodies of these two pieces in aaba form represent opposite tendencies in bebop themes. Salt Peanuts is simplicity itself—a four-measure riff phrase played twice in each a section, and a slightly more complex bridge (which incorporates the ubiquitous ^9-7-8 figure twice). The main riff is really in swing style; perhaps that is why Catlett's drumming fits the piece so well.16 Hot House, on the other hand, is the most chromatic and angular melody that bebop had produced by that date. But in the complexity of overall design, these two performances switch roles. Hot House follows the simple norm in\n\n16\n\nB E B O P : THE M U S I C \\ \\ l ) ITS P L A Y E R S\n\nbebop—introduction, unison statement of theme, solo choruses, unison statement of theme. Salt Peanuts, on the other hand, is a full-blown arrangement: Introduction (16 measures)—8-measure drum solo, ending with Catlett playing the rhythm of the main theme; then 8 measures by the quintet Chorus 1 (32 measures)—unison theme statement Interlude (8 measures)—-unison phrase in the more complex bebop melodic style Chorus 2 (32 measures)—theme, with Parker playing the first two measures of the riff and Gillespie comically singing \"salt PEAnuts, salt PEA-nuts\" in response; Parker improves in the bridge Interlude 2 (16 measures)—8-measure solo by Haig; then another complex unison phrase, then a two-measure solo break by Haig Chorus 3 (32 measures)—Haig's solo Chorus 4 (32 measures)—Parker's solo Interlude 3 (10 measures)-—6-measure dialogue between Parker and Gillespie; then a flashy 4-measure solo break by Gillespie Chorus 5 (32 measures)—Gillespie's solo Half-chorus 6 (16 measures)—Catlett's solo Coda (16 measures)—a reprise of the introduction, with everyone singing the \"salt PEA-nuts\" figure at the end Throughout the piece the quintet plays well; the composed sections are precise and clean, driven by Catlett's conservative but impeccable drumming. Al Haig's solo is competent if uneventful, while Parker's is a model of a finely crafted solo and Gillespie's is a typically exuberant emotional high point. In Hot House we get to hear all the main ingredients of bebop assembled in one recorded performance for the first time. After a brief drum, introduction, the complex theme begins, with its chromatic melody hopping around within chords such as C13(*n> and FMI9(MA7>. Complementing this angular melody is Haig's energetic comping and Catlett's punctuating fills, all supported by Russell's relentless walking bass lines. This multilayered texture continues during Parker's and Gillespie's solo choruses and the concluding theme chorus. All that is missing is the more aggressive drum punctuations and the driving ride-cymbal pattern that Kenny Clarke, Max Roach, or Art Blakey would have provided. Parker and Gillespie create excellent samples of their rhythmically varied improvising styles. Both scatter unexpected accents here and there in their eighth-note-dominated melodies. Both interrupt these\n\nEARLY CLASSICS\n\n17\n\neighth-note passages with dazzling sixteenth-note phrases that are as expertly wrought as the phrases in which they have twice the time to think. Running through the performance is a unifying thread, derived from the opening notes of the hidden theme:\n\nTadd Cameron's melody Hot House begins with an elaboration of this phrase:\n\nIn measure 9 of his solo, Parker plays his own elaboration:\n\nThen he begins the bridge with another variant, transposed up a fourth to fit the new key of the moment:\n\nFinally, he uses this last variant to begin the final four measures of his solo:\n\nThen Gillespie, as though taking the baton in a relay race, opens his solo chorus with the same figure. The final leg of the relay race is the return of the Hot House theme (which is in abca form, although it fits a harmonic scheme in aaba form). On 26 November 1945, after several recording sessions as a side-\n\n18\n\nB E B O P : THE M U S I C AND ITS P L A Y E R S\n\nman, Charlie Parker had his first session as leader. Out of this session came two famous blues melodies entitled Note's the Time and Billie's Bounce, an / Got Rhythm contrafact entitled Thriving from a Riff (later to be altered and renamed Anthropology), and a monument called Koko.17 For the first three of these pieces Parker had the young and inexperienced Miles Davis as his front-line partner (see page 114), a rhythm team of Curley Russell and Max Roach, and pianists Dizzy Gillespie (an above-average comper) and Argonne Thornton. The best of these three is Billie's Bounce. It follows the typical bebop blues plan of piano introduction, two unison theme choruses, solo choruses, and two more unison theme choruses. Parker plays a fine four-chorus solo as expected, Davis is adequate, and Max Roach's fully idiomatic bebop percussion work is recorded well (although the ja/z world had to await the compact disc and sophisticated remastering techniques to hear how well). The fast Koko (J = 300) was an amazing and perplexing recording when first released. Today it stands as a classic of the jazz tradition. It begins with an unusually long introduction, 32 measures, played by Parker, Roach and Gillespie, the latter replacing Davis on trumpet. This introduction has four subsections of eight measures each: a unison melody, an improvisation by Gillespie, another by Parker, and another unison melody. Next come two masterfully executed improvised choruses by Parker on the chords of Cherokee, Ray Noble's popular song of the late 1930s. Each chorus is 64 measures long, on a chord structure in aa'ba' form. Roach follows with a half-chorus solo (32 measures). Then Parker, Gillespie, and Roach repeat the introduction, but stop abruptly three measures early, producing an enigmatic ending on the dominant. The story behind Koko is convoluted. In night-club engagements Parker and Gillespie had been playing a fast arrangement of Cherokee. Miles Davis did not know the arrangement, with its complicated introduction/coda, so when the players decided to record it, Gillespie took over on trumpet. After the introduction on take 1, Gillespie began to play the Cherokee melody, while Parker played a harmony part for four measures and then an improvised counterpoint for a few more measures. But soon he stopped playing and halted the recording. Evidently he felt that with the lengthy introduction and one chorus devoted to the theme, there would be little time left for his solo. So for take 2, the famous take, he discarded the theme, leaving space for the two solo choruses that saxophonists have been copying ever since (see also pp. 38-40). Since there is no trace of the Cherokee melody, and since Parker had collected $300 from the owner of the Savoy for four original compositions, the record producer Teddy Reig gave to this performance the name Koko,, and used it to complete the set of four originals.\n\nEARLY CLASSICS\n\n19\n\nThere is a question concerning who plays piano on Koko. According to Reig, Gillespie played piano during Parker's two choruses and trumpet during the introduction and coda. That explanation is plausible, but during the few extant measures of the Cherokee melody in take 1 someone plays piano while Gillespie continues on trumpet. That pianist could have been Davis, who had a moderate command of the keyboard, or Argonne Thornton, a marginally competent pianist who had already played on Thriving from a /^(unfortunately). So any of three people could have comped for Parker on take 2,18 The issue is incidental, however, for the comping is basic, functional, and entirely subservient to the stunning solo that Parker created. It would have mattered little if the entire performance had taken place without a piano player. By the end of 1945 a repertory of new pieces was on record and in use publicly by an ever-increasing number of polished players. In December, Gillespie, Parker, Haig, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bassist Ray Brown, and drummer Stan Levey took their music to Los Angeles, where bebop already was developing among a lesser-known group of players. During 1946, Gillespie and Parker, now leading separate groups in different parts of the country, added Confirmation, 52nd Street Theme, Anthropology, Moose the Mooche, Yardbird Suite, Ornithology, Our Delight, and others to the recorded repertory, and made important new recordings of 'Round Midnight and A Night in Tunisia. By this time Gillespie and Parker were no longer the main sources of the rapidly expanding inventory of bebop recordings. Don Byas already had begun to incorporate elements of bebop into his Coleman Hawkins-based style, and was continuing his recording career. Younger tenor saxophonists Sonny Stitt, Dexter Gordon, Wardell Gray, and Stan Getz each led recording sessions; so did Kenny Clarke, back from a three-year tour of duty in the armed services. Trombonist J. J. Johnson had his first session as leader and added some bebop flavoring to the Basie band. The swing bands of Woody Herman and Stan Kenton were evolving rapidly into bebop bands, as younger sidemen replaced their swing-oriented predecessors. And pianist Lennie Tristano, guitarist Billy Bauer, and their coterie began recording their own distinctive bebop dialect. Ornithology, written by Benny Harris and Parker, was an important addition to the repertory in 1946. In some ways it is a perfect symbol of early bebop: a complex melodic contrafact (the hidden theme is More High the Moon) with an erudite title that refers to a founding father of bebop (Parker's nickname was \"Bird\"). The Ornithology melody begins with a phrase that had been in Parker's improvising vocabulary since at least 1942 (Parker's Fig. 2B in Chapter 3), when he used it to begin his solos in the Jay McShann recordings of The jfumpin' Blues (a.k.a. Jump the Blues):19\n\n20\n\nB E B O P : THE M U S I C AND ITS P L A Y E R S\n\nThe original recording of the piece is from a productive session by Parker that also produced first recordings of Moose the Mooche and Yardbird Suite, and Parker's famous recording of A Night in Tunisia.20 However, it is a recording of a theme in progress, for the winds abruptly stop their unison playing at the end of measure 12, leaving the pianist to fill in for four measures until the theme (in aa' form) begins again. Near the end of the theme chorus the winds continue playing, but they simply toss the same triplet figure from one to another. In later public performances Parker used an improved theme, one in which section a is complete and section a' has a better ending. Later performances also preserve more extended solos. But this inaugural recording is important because it is one of three takes that offer us another chance to compare Parker's musical thought processes from one moment to the next. As expected, his solos on each take are quite different from one another. Ornithology and most other important pieces in the bebop repertoire came out of sessions by small groups (combos), because bebop is small-group jazz primarily. But almost from the beginning there have been some big bands devoted to the music. In 1944-45 the Eckstine and Raeburn bands played early roles in the music's evolution. And in 1945 Gillespie formed a big band, the first of several short-lived big bands under his aegis. The big bands were even less well served than small groups by recording techniques of the time. But Gillespie's second band, of 194650, made some noteworthy additions to the repertory. One piece carries the linguistically meaningless title Oop-Pop-a-Dah.21 A blues, it is a vehicle for the bebop-style scat singing of Gillespie and Kenny Hagood, and is the first of the bebop scat vocals on record. In it, trumpeter Gillespie, like Louis Armstrong two decades earlier, showed that he was also an important jazz singer. Even more than Armstrong, Gillespie infused his scat solos with ample doses of humor. But anyone who listens to the notes and rhythms and not just the funny vocal sounds will discover the same melodic ingenuity in his scat solos that exists in his trumpet solos. Manteca was another of his best big band recordings. Like A Night in Tunisia, it represents Gillespie's interest in Latin rhythms.22 He cocomposed it with Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo, whom he added to his rhythm section in the fall of 1947. Pozo, playing conga drum, and\n\nEARLY CLASSICS\n\n21\n\nbassist Al McKibbon begin the record with a rhythm based on straight eighth notes rather than on the swing eighths of 1940s jazz, and the trombones follow suit as they enter with an ostinato. The a section of the theme is repetitive and based on only three notes; one of those notes is scale step ^7 of the Mixolydian scale, a scale integral to many Cuban melodies. The hint of Mixolydian and the syncopated Afro-Cuban rhythms of the theme and its accompanying ostinato set this piece apart from most bebop of the 1940s. But Gillespie's irrepressible interest in moving harmonies surfaces in the bridge, suggesting that the embrace of the Cuban idiom is not complete. Sure enough, once the theme ends and the improvisations begin, the Cuban effect almost disappears as tenor saxophonist Big Nick Nicholas reverts to the enriched major mode and the / Got Rhythm chord changes of normal bebop. Gillespie and the full band continue the bebop mood, using swing eighths in spite of Pozo's continuing even eighths, until the final a section of the theme returns. Complete assimilation of Afro-Cuban rhythms and improvisations on a harmonic ostinato was still a few years away for the beboppers in 1947. Perhaps the finest example of big-band bebop in the 1940s came from the Woody Herman band. Herman, whose swing-style clarinet and saxophone playing hardly changed at all during his career, was nonetheless sympathetic to the new idiom. By late 1947 his was essentially a bebop band, though its repertory included his earlier swing-style hits as well. In particular, his baritone saxophonist, Serge Chaloff, was very much a Parker imitator, and his tenor players, Herbie Stewart, Stan Getz, and Zoot Sims, all had developed a similar stylistic blend of Lester Young and Parker. The playing of these four men inspired . arranger-saxophonist Jimmy Giuffre to compose a piece for them, appropriately titled Four Brothers.2* The melody of Four Brothers begins immediately, played in fourpart harmony by the featured saxophonists. Giuffre's theme is an attractive, arpeggio-filled melody in aaba form. The bridge (which is harmonically identical to Benny Carter's When Lights Are Low for the first four measures) moves rapidly through chords and key areas. In the first six measures the players visit B major, D major, and C major before easing back into the home key of A k when the final a returns. After the theme chorus each soloist has a half-chorus solo. Stewart and Sims each solo in the first half of the second and third choruses, where the chords are easier; Chaloff and Getz begin their solos in the thicket of bridge chords, and have some difficulty, Chaloff more than Getz. The last two choruses are written out for the band except for a bridge in which Herman solos on clarinet. His solo sounds assured and polished, but consists\n\n22\n\nB E B O P : THE M U S I C AND ITS P L A Y E R S\n\nalmost entirely of the roots of the chords.24 In the final chorus Don Lamond's drum fills are overstuffed, but otherwise his playing, captured with remarkable clarity by the recording engineer, is excellent and contributes greatly to the success of the performance. The piece ends with an exuberant coda in which each saxophonist has a final brief say. By 1946-47 the basic parameters of bebop were in place. But some players made music that differed from the norm in some ways. Two of them were pianists: Thelonious Monk and Lennie Tristano. Monk, little-known and even less appreciated in the 1940s, had a much larger impact on jazz in the 1950s and 1960s, so I will examine his music in Chapter 7. Tristano was better-known to the jazz audience, and had a small school of musical disciples by the end of the 1940s; among them were alto saxophonist Lee Konitz, tenor saxophonist Warne Marsh, and guitarist Billy Bauer. Tristano's bebop differed from mainstream bebop in three ways. First, the melodies he and his colleagues composed were more angular, less clearly related to their underlying harmonies, and less symmetrical in phrase lengths than melodies by Parker, Gillespie, Dameron, and others. Second, the harmonic textures created by his small groups, which usually included Bauer, were denser than those of most bebop groups. Both he and Bauer regularly comped energetically and with little apparent concern for staying out of each other's way. And third, he much preferred drummers to use brushes rather than sticks, even in lively pieces. To many listeners his music was intellectual, reserved, and \"cool.\" Subconscious-Lee illustrates his group style well.25 The title is a play on words, the composer being Lee Konitz. Another melodic contrafact of What Is This Thing Called Love? (the Tristano school's favorite harmonic structure), it has even more surprising rhythms and startling melodic twists and turns than occur in Hot House, the earlier piece on the same structure. The emphasized chord tones in several places are highly dissonant notes, such as augmented elevenths of major and dominant seventh chords (i.e., F* in C chords) and major sevenths in minor chords (i.e., E in FMI chords). The solos by Tristano, Bauer, and Konitz that follow, however, are less adventuresome. In fact, other than an almost total lack of syncopation, their improvisations are similar to those played by most beboppers of the time. Rhythmic interest here, instead of coming from the soloists, comes from the syncopated comping of Tristano and Bauer, and especially from the buoyant and creative brush work by Shelly Manne. Later in the year, Tristano, Konitz, Bauer, Marsh, and bassist Arnold Fishkin recorded some remarkable collective improvisations:\n\nEARLY CLASSICS\n\n23\n\nIntuition and Digression.26 These startling pieces are not part of the jazz tradition of that time. Neither piece swings, nor was it intended to; the time sense is much closer to that of European chamber music, with very little syncopation and with subtle gradations of tempo. The harmonic vocabulary, largely an incidental by-product of unplanned but interactive polyphony, is rich and varied, with a high level of dissonance. The through-composed form of each is radically different from the usual theme and variations of jazz. These two pieces are early examples of what came to be called \"free jazz\" in the 1960s, although their impact on \"free jazz\" players such as Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, and Archie Shepp was minimal or nonexistent. The pieces remain today as interesting anomalies, having only the most tenuous connection to the evolution of bebop. In 1948 a new type of ensemble formed, originally to rehearse some new arrangements by Gil Evans, Gerry Mulligan, and John Lewis. It had an unusual instrumentation: trumpet, trombone, French horn, tuba, alto and baritone saxes, plus the usual rhythm trio. In essence it was a reduced version of the Claude Thornhill big band, which also incorporated a French horn and a tuba. In fact, part of the group was from the Thornhill band, and Gil Evans was Thornhill's arranger. Miles Davis joined the group and soon became its leader. In September, they played an engagement at the Royal Roost night club in New York City. A few months later the nonet, with shifting personnel, did a series of three recording dates. The twelve pieces from these sessions attracted much attention. Since most of the pieces were in slow or moderate tempos and played with quiet dynamics, they seemed to signal the start of the \"cool era\" in jazz history. The importance of these recordings rests in the compositions, the arrangements, and the ensemble style of performance rather than in the solos, most of which are short and superficial, some of which are weak. And there are other performance flaws, chiefly in the fast pieces Move and Budo. These pieces, though well arranged by Lewis, suffer from a lack of rhythmic cohesion, for the ensemble has trouble keeping up with Max Roach. Perhaps they could not hear him well; a famous picture taken during the recording session shows his drums almost hidden from view behind some tall sound baffles, and widely separated from the bassist and everyone else. While the engineer captured his drum and cymbals sounds well, he may have forced the musicians to pay a price in the process. Flaws aside, this set of twelve performances is a remarkable and important contribution to the music. There is much to enjoy here, such as the surprising meter shifts (almost unheard of in jazz then) in Mulligan's\n\n24\n\nB E B O P : THE M U S I C AND ITS P L A Y E R S\n\njferu, and the recurring shifts from major to minor in John Carisi's bittersweet blues Israel. Above all there is the blended sound of those six winds. All the arrangers used the winds effectively, but the sound that Gil Evans extracted from them in Boplicity is extraordinarily beautiful. Here, as in his earlier arrangements for the Thornhill band, Evans revealed some of the creativity that he would bring to the masterpieces Miles Ahead and Sketches of Spain a decade later (see pp. 120-23).27 The Davis nonet is the best-known of the groups that are larger than a typical combo but smaller than a big band. There were other such ensembles. Bill Harris recorded with nonets in 1946 and 1949, Dave Brubeck recorded with a nonet in 1948 and an octet in 1950, Shorty Rogers led octets and nonets in the early 1950s, Gigi Gryce wrote for and recorded with groups of both sizes in 1953, and Dave Pell led an octet during most of the 1950s. But except for the Pell octet, these groups were unable to function over an extended period. Neither fish nor fowl, they were too large for small clubs with low budgets, yet not big and loud enough to match the power of the big band in larger venues. So bebop continued to evolve without them. Before leaving this overview of early bebop, let us look at two brief examples of ensemble playing by some of its best players. Drawn from late recordings by Charlie Parker on Verve, they are acoustically among the best recordings he made. The first shows the second eight measures of the opening theme statement of Confirmation.26 It is a fine example of a rhythm section—pianist Al Haig, bassist Percy Heath, and drummer Max Roach—finding ways to enhance Parker's interpretation of the melody. The quartet probably performed from memory, for Parker's composition had been in the bebop repertory since 1946. At most there might have been a lead sheet in the studio, but lead sheets are silent on matters of chord voicings, bass lines, and rhythmic punctuations. Those issues are left for the players to settle, either spontaneously or, as is more likely with these experienced players, on the basis of previous performances. Roach clearly knows this melody well. Besides keeping the time moving forward with his ride cymbal and high hat he plays a variety of punctuations that either reinforce important syncopations in the melody (measures 2, 3, and 4) or provide a rhythmic complement to the melody (measures 5 and 8). Haig also has two roles, to supply both harmonic background and rhythmic punctuation. He obviously knows the tune also, for his most assertive moments are during rests in the melody, when his syncopated comping is the most effective. Heath's jobs are to coordinate with the drummer in keeping the time moving forward and to coordinate with the pianist by sounding the roots of chords on down-\n\nEARLY CLASSICS\n\n25\n\nbeats (or on beats 1 and 3 if there are two chords per measure, as in measures 6 and 7). But here, he also participates in the rhythmic complement of the melody, by playing a well-timed syncopation in measure 1. Thus, the rhythm section functions as a team, with the members coordinating beautifully among themselves and with Parker. The result is a superb performance of Parker's fine theme.\n\nThere is a harmonic clash in the second measure. Heath plays A 7 /£ (a passing chord connecting F and DMI), while Haig uses an E1\" in his enriched A7 chord. There is also a clash in measure 6, between the D that Parker plays and the D1\" of Haig's E1\"9. Such clashes are nearly inevitable in bebop, with its rich assortment of 7th, 9th, 11-th, and 13th chords and\n\n26\n\nBEBOP: THE M U S I C AJIB ITS P L A Y E R S\n\nchord substitutions. Players often take different harmonic paths to get from one structurally important chord to the next; the resulting momentary clashes are accepted ingredients of this improvised art. The second example is from Laird Baird, a themeless blues in B1\".29 The central feature of this excerpt, besides Parker's rhythmically ingenious improvised melody, is the turnaround, a chord progression designed to connect the tonic of measure 11 with the tonic chord at the start of the next chorus. Pianists and bassists have several stock progressions from which to choose. Here Hank Jones and Teddy Kotick agree perfectly on a favorite bebop turnaround: a series of 5th-related enriched dominant sevenths (G+ 7 < 1>9 >—C 9 —F+ 7 < t9 >). It is Jones's moment; Parker leaves a large space for him to fill, and Roach's snare-drum\n\nEARLY CLASSICS\n\n27\n\nfills are quiet and supportive. Once past the turnaround, Jones recedes into the background to play the enriched blues progression that the players follow throughout the performance. Here again are harmonic clashes, at the start and near the end of the example, between Jones's passing chords and Kotick's more basic choices. But again, the clashes over harmonic details do not matter, for the players agree on the main harmonic events. Charlie Parker, the lead player in both of these excerpts, was a vitally important player during the early years of bebop. Without him the music would have been far different. To know his personal idiom is to know much about the language of bebop. Thus, the following discussion of his musical vocabulary serves as the central point of reference for the rest of the book.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nThe Parker Style Charlie Parker was the architect of the style. (Dizzy Gillespie1)\n\nJust as Louis Ar nstrong dominated jazz in the 1920s, so Charlie Parker (1920-55) dominated early bebop in the 1940s. His mastery of the new musical idiom was complete, and his style had a self-contained logic beyond that of any of his contemporaries. Like Armstrong before him, Parker was a principal role model for jazz players worldwide. Elements of his style were copied, not only by innumerable alto saxophonists, but by tenor and baritone saxophonists, clarinetists, trumpeters, pianists, and others. Countless players learned his recorded solos note for note, and sometimes even recorded them, or variations on them. Parker's musical beginnings in Kansas City foretold little of the greatness he was to attain. He received his meager formal musical training in public schools, where his abilities impressed no one at first. His jazz training came during his teenage years, and primarily consisted of listening to the Count Basie band and other jazz groups appearing in local night clubs, studying jazz recordings, practicing, and playing in some small groups. He progressed quickly, for at age 17, in late 1937, he joined Jay McShann's band. After a few months he quit the band to go to New York City, where he played intermittently. In 1940 he rejoined McShann and toured with him until July 1942. During visits to New York City he participated frequently in the seminal after-hours jam sessions at Monroe's Uptown House and Minton's Playhouse (see pp. 8-10). After leaving McShann, he worked in a variety of bands led by Earl Hines, Noble Sissle, Billy Eckstine, and others. By 1945 he was working mostly with small groups of bebop players. Late in the year he left New York with a group led by Dizzy Gillespie, to play his first Los Angeles engagement. He stayed on the West Coast for a year and a half.\n\nTHE PARKER STYLE\n\n29\n\nIn mid-1947 he returned to New York City to stay, although he often toured various parts of the country, and visited Europe briefly in 1949 and 1950. Parker's recorded legacy begins in 1940, with two unaccompanied solos recorded on amateur equipment, and some private recordings by the Jay McShann band for broadcast on a Kansas radio station. Other broadcasts and some studio recordings followed in 1941 and 1942, always with the McShann band. These few pieces plus a few from some jam sessions are the only known recordings from his early period.2 They reveal that Parker was learning his craft by using elements of the musical language of swing. Fascinating as these early recordings are for providing a glimpse into Parker's musical evolution, they had little impact on his colleagues. His influential recordings began in September 1944 with a Savoy recording date under the leadership of guitarist Tiny Grimes, and ended ten years later with a Verve recording of pieces written by Cole Porter.3 Over 900 samples of his art, ranging in length from brief aborted studio takes to four- or five-minute solos from public performances, date from those ten years. Within this corpus is a wealth of material for study.4 Perhaps the first feature of Parker's style to strike the ears is his tone quality; compared with that of his swing-era predecessors, it was harsh, hard-edged. Its stark beauty contrasted sharply with the sweet and mellow timbres used by Johnny Hodges, Benny Carter, and other older alto saxophonists. His vibrato also departed from the swing-era norm; he used a narrower pitch range (about 120 cents) and a slower speed (about five oscillations per second, compared with about six per second for most of his predecessors).5 Also, unlike his predecessors, he rarely played a note long enough to warm it with vibrato. Another striking feature is the rhythmic aspect of his solos. In tempos of J = 200 or more, he usually played long strings of swing eighth notes (or even eighth notes if the tempo was fast), articulated in a weak-to-strong manner:6\n\nFurther, he often accented the highest note of the moment, whether it fell on the beat or between beats, and thereby produced a rich variety of rhythms within those long strings of eighth notes. None of these fea-\n\n30\n\nB E B O P : THE M U S I C 1\\H ITS P L A Y E R S\n\ntures was new to jazz when Parker employed them; Armstrong often accented the highest notes of phrases, Sidney Bechet used the weak-tostrong phrasing of eighth notes, and Coleman Hawkins was fond of long strings of swing eighth notes. But the particular combination of these ingredients produced a distinctive sound. In more moderate tempos (J = 125—200) he usually intermingled eighth-note and sixteenth-note phrases in varying proportions. In tempos below J = 125 most of his phrases were in sixteenth and thirty-second notes. His skill in playing many notes per second and organizing them into coherent and interesting phrases was extraordinary in the 1940s, for few players could equal him in this regard. Parker, like all important improvisers, developed a personal repertory of melodic formulas that he used in the course of improvising. He found many w;.ys to reshape, combine, and phrase these formulas, so that no two choruses were just alike. But his \"spontaneous\" performances were actually precomposed in part. This preparation was absolutely necessary, for no one can create fluent, coherent melodies in real time without having a well-rehearsed bag of melodic tricks ready. His well-practiced melodic patterns are essential identifiers of his style. Because Parker's recorded legacy is extensive it is possible not only to compile a list of Parker's favorite figures but to see how he used these figures in different contexts. A study of his hundreds of choruses of the blues in B1\", F, and C and dozens of choruses of/ Got Rhythm, What Is This Thing Called Love?, Horn High the Moon, and others shows that his improvising was largely formulaic. The specifics of the theme were rarely significant in shaping his solo; instead, he favored a certain repertory of formulas for the blues in B1\", a slightly different repertory for the blues in F, a much different one for A Night in Tunisia in D minor, and so on. Some phrases in his vocabulary came from swing, either unchanged or modified; others he created. But whether using borrowed or original melodic formulas, his way of combining and organizing them was his own. Parker's formulas fall into several categories. Some are only a few notes long and are adaptable to many harmonic contexts. They tend to be the figures he (and his imitators) used most often, for they occur in many different keys and pieces. Others form complete phrases with well-defined harmonic implications, and are correspondingly rare. Most occur on a variety of pitches, but others appear on only one or two pitch levels; A few occur only in a single group of pieces in a single key. Included below are his most common figures plus a few of the rare ones that are particularly idiosyncratic.7\n\nTHE PARKER STYLE\n\n31\n\nTwo short figures, 1A and 2A, occur more frequently than any others. Each appears once every eight or nine measures, on the average, in his solos. The first (which Coleman Hawkins also used) is an ascending arpeggio, usually played as a triplet, as in the first two versions. When preceded by an upper or lower neighbor, as shown in the second and third versions, it frequently begins a phrase, although it may occur anywhere in a phrase. Figure 2A, an inverted mordent (shown in three different variants), is even simpler in construction and easier to play than the ascending arpeggio of 1A. Because of its brevity and simplicity the motive appears in almost any context, and is an incidental component in a number of more complex figures, such as 2B. Parker's early role model, Lester Young, also made extensive use of 2A, and even played 2B in his 1936 solo in Shoe Shine Boy.8 This latter figure occurs at the beginning of Parker's solo in The jfumpin' Blues of 1942, and reappears as the beginning of the Ornithology theme in 1946. Figure IB contains a rising arpeggio, as in 1A, but turns back on itself. Though it is as easy to play as 1A, it appears less than one-fifth as often.\n\nRanking third in order of frequency is the more extended Figure 3. It occurs in several different pitch shapes, all of which contain a characteristic feature of the harmonic minor scale: the raised 7th and lowered 6th scale degrees (B and A1\" in this example), which function as the 3rd and minor 9th of a dominant minor-ninth chord. Because of its strong harmonic implications this figure nearly always occurs where there is a V7-I harmonic relationship, especially a secondary dominant relation-\n\n32\n\nBEBOP: T H E M U S I C A N D I T S P L A Y E R S\n\nship, such as the [V7-I]ii progression in measures 8 and 9 of the blues (G7-CMi in the blues in B1\").\n\nThe chromatic motions of Figures 4A-F are hardly distinctive; pointing them out is rather like pointing out the frequent use of some common prepositions in literary works. For example, the five-note chromatic ascent of Figure 4F was a favorite of Lester Young as well as Parker. Yet these bits are important components of the language; in particular, the simplest of these Figures, 4A, is part of what David Baker has termed the \"bebop dominant scale\" and the \"bebop major scale.\"9\n\nThe chromatic Figure 5A appears occasionally in solos by Coleman Hawkins and Roy Eldridge, but often in the rhythmic configuration of quarter-eighth-eighth, not the three eighth notes that Parker favored. Figure SB is more distinctive and became one of the most frequently copied of Parker's figures. He may have learned it from the beginning of Ellington's Concerto for Cootie (or Do Nothin' Til You Hear from Me). Figure 5C is a combination of 1A and an extension of SB.\n\nTHE P A R K E R STYLE\n\n33\n\nBriefly, Figures 6A and 6B are common tonic chord embellishments; Figure 7—a short-note ascent or descent—is a frequent phrase beginning; Figure 8 incorporates both the raised 9th and lowered 9th of a dominant chord; Figure 9 became a bebop cliche for approaching the ii chord in measure 9 of the blues; Figure 10 occurs most frequently over the IV^l chord (as in measure 5 of the blues); and Figures 11A and 11B typically occur over the ii-V progression.\n\nThe famous \"flatted fifth\" of bebop played a relatively small role in Parker's playing; many solos contain not a single instance of it. But when he did use it he usually called attention to it in a striking way, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n34\n\nBEBOP: THE MUSIC AND ITS PL4YERS\n\nThe remaining figures shown above are less common but aurally striking, nonetheless: 13A and 13B emphasize the augmented 5th of a dominant chord, as in the progression [V7-I]IV; Figure 14 touches on the 13th, augmented llth, and 9th of a dominant chord; Figures ISA and 15B are built upon diminished 7th chords (although Parker was probably thinking of dominant sevenths with flatted ninths in 15 A); and Figure 16 is built upon a whole-tone scale. In addition to favoring the patterns shown above, Parker was fond of quoting bits of melodies, often with humorous intent. In doing so he was following a tradition well established in earlier jazz by Louis Armstrong and others. Usually these quotations appear in the informal performances, although some appear in the studio recordings as well. His favorites were the opening of the clarinet descant of High Society, the opening phrase of the Habanera of Bizet's opera Carmen, and the\n\nTHE P A R K E R STYLE\n\n35\n\nopening of Grainger's Country Gardens, which he used over and over again as a coda. Parker's solos often have an inevitability about them; they seem to have been created by a man who knew exactly where he was going and what to play next. His style seems to have internal logic and consistency. The great number of players who copied his style probably sensed this quality in his music, which is why they copied him in the first place. But what makes his style so consistent within itself? Much of the compelling nature of his improvising had to do with his command of the instrument and of his musical language. He had the technical equipment to play whatever he wanted to play, whenever he wanted to play it. And he had a sense of swing that almost never wavered.10 Even when his personal life and physical condition were in chaos his capacity to make coherent music was nearly unshakable.11 The sheer energy and self-confidence of his playing surely contributed to his music's impact on listeners. But lying beneath the surface of most of his improvisations is another factor that helps generate the sense of Tightness in his music. Typically entire phrases, and even entire choruses and groupings of choruses, are goal-oriented; they arrive on a final note that lies at the end of a lengthy stepwise descent. To see this scalar descent in microcosm, one need only re-examine some of his favorite melodic formulas. In Figure 3\n\nthere is a five-note scalar descent to the third of the dominant chord (B in this example), then a rise (sometimes filled in by chordal leaps, sometimes not) to the minor ninth of the dominant chord (A1\" in this example) and a final descent to the fifth of the tonic chord (G here). Thus, there is an underlying descent of a seventh, folded over to stay within the mid-range of the saxophone. In Figures 4A, 4D, and 4E the short descents are obvious, and they are only slightly veiled in Figures SA, SB, 5C, 9, and 10. In 11A and 11B they are embedded within broken chord figuration. In ISA the central descent is from E to E; but the initial high F and the final D are also part of this descent, though the octave shifts and chordal leaps hide this connection.\n\n36\n\nBEBOP: THE MUSIC AND ITS PLAYERS\n\nTo see fully how these scalar descents work, one must delve into a solo. Here is the opening chorus of his great solo in The Closer,\n\na blues from the Jazz at the Philharmonic concert of 18 September 1949.12 The downward stems indicate the actual rhythms of his improvised melody; the upward stems connected by an extended beam indicate the notes of the scalar descent, which begins in the third full measure. The breaks in the beam indicate places where he interrupts the scalar descent and then returns to the note on which he left off. He ingeniously disguises the descent with an unpredictable array of chordal leaps, shifts of register, and repetitions. The shifts of register, such as the A to G^ in measure 10, are dramatically effective. They are also necessary, for unfolded, the descent that underlies this chorus would span four octaves! Not all of his solos exhibit a scalar organization as clearly as this one. Slow solos, such as the beautiful Parker's Mood, take 1 (see below), mix scalar descents with other motions. And some faster pieces have upward as well as downward scalar activity. But the great majority of his solos contain extensive sections of scalar descents; they are among the most striking elements in his musical vocabulary. Further, this scalar organization is a device that he brought into jazz, for his predecessors' music does not contain it.\n\nTHE P A R K E R STYLE\n\n37\n\nWas he aware of this aspect of his music? He never spoke of it publicly, and his colleagues have not reported him discussing it with them. But surely he knew, if at a subconscious and nonverbal level, of the Tightness of certain choices of notes at certain moments in musical time. And just as it has been with other great makers of music, Parker's choices turn out to have a logic of their own, a logic that extends beyond simply applying melodic formulas at harmonically appropriate times (notice how effortlessly his melody in The Closer seems to glide from one pattern to the next, especially in measures 6 through 11). Sensitive listeners—including the many players who incorporated this procedure into their personal styles—may sense that logic intuitively, and analysis reveals at least part of that logic. The preceding discussion of Parker's techniques of improvisation may suggest that the individual performance was of little importance, that once he arrived at his system of improvising he could produce great solos consistently and almost effortlessly. There is some truth in this supposition; the many alternate takes available for study allows us to hear one brilliant solo after another, created within minutes of one another on the same chord structure. How does one decide which solo is the best among the various takes of Out of Nowhere, Chi Chi, or any number of other pieces? But there also were moments of particular brilliance when he surpassed himself. Here is a list of some of his finest recorded moments: Koko, take 2 (Cherokee)—26 November 1945; Savoy 597 (reissued on Savoy CD 70737) Ornithology, take 4 (How High the Moon) and A Night in Tunisia, take 5—28 March 1946; Dial 1002 (reissued on Spotlite 101) A Night in Tunisia, Dizzy Atmosphere (I Got Rhythm), and Groovin' High (Whispering)—29 September 1947; Roost 2234 (and a variety of bootleg reissues)—a broadcast performance from Carnegie Hall Embraceable You, 2 takes (ballad)—28 October 1947; Dial 1024 (reissued on Spotlite 104) Out of Nowhere, 3 takes, and Don't Blame Me (ballad)—4 November 1947; Dial 1021 and LPs (reissued on Spotlite 105) Donna Lee (Indiana)—8 November 1947; Spotlite 108—a broadcast performance Parker's Mood, the 2 complete takes (slow blues)—18 September 1948; Savoy 936 and 12000 (reissued on Savoy 5500) Perhaps, the 4 complete takes (blues)—24 September 1948; Savoy 938 and various LPs (including Savoy 5500) Salt Peanuts (I Got Rhythm)—12 December 1948; Charlie Parker Rec-\n\n38\n\nB E B O P : THE M U S I C A N D ITS P L A Y E R S\n\nords 70IB and other bootleg records—a broadcast performance from the Royal Roost Scrapple from the Apple (a section from Honeysuckle Rose, b section from / Got Rhythm)—15 January 1949; Charlie Parker Records 701C and various bootleg reissues—a broadcast performance from the Royal Roost The Closer (blues)—18 September 1949; Mercury 35013 (reissued on Verve CD set 837 141-2)—a Jazz at the Philharmonic concert performance Attprivave,™ 2 takes (blues)—17 January 1951; Mercury/Clef 11087 (reissued on Verve CD set 837 141-2) Anthropology (I Got Rhythm)—31 March 1951; Alamac 2430 and other bootleg reissues—a broadcast performance from Birdland What Is This Thing Called Love?—25 March 1952; Mercury/Clef 11102 (reissued on Verve CD set 837 141-2)—a big-band re-' cording Hot House (What Is This Thing Called Love?) and A Night in Tunisia— 15 May 1953; Debut 4 (reissued on many bootleg LPs)—concert performances in Massey Hall, Toronto Chi Chi, 3 takes (blues)—4 August 1953; Clef and Verve issues (reissued on Verve CD set 837 141-2) On pp. 17-19, I discussed some aspects of the first piece on this list, Koko. In the main, Koko is Parker's two-chorus improvisation on the chords of Ray Noble's Cherokee, which Count Basic's and Charlie Barnet's bands recorded in 1939. This harmonic structure looms large in the literature written about Parker, primarily because of an article that appeared in Down Beat in 1949. The authors, Michael Levin and John S. Wilson, wrote: Charlie's horn first came alive in a chili house on Seventh Avenue between 139th street and 140th street in December 1939. . . . Working over Cherokee with [guitarist Biddy] Fleet, Charlie suddenly found that by using higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related [chord] changes, he could play this thing he had been \"hearing.\" Fleet picked it up behind him and bop was born.14\n\nSoon other writers took this third-person description and rewrote it so that it seemed to come from Parker's mouth (see, for example, Shapiro/Hentoff 1955: 354). Since then it has become one of the key\n\nTHE P A R K E R S T Y L E\n\n39\n\n\"quotations\" used to explain the origins of bebop. It is a fuzzy statement, no matter who first made it. \"Higher intervals\" presumably refers to 9ths, llths"
