John Connolly is a mystery writer best known for his series starring private detective Charlie Parker. The Fictional Character works out of Scarborough, Maine and often spends time in the streets of Portland Maine. Starting with The Lovers, Charlie Parker became a bartender at the Great Lost Bear. We are delighted to have such a renown detective working at our establishment!

Many of the characters in working along side Charlie are not fictional, and do indeed exist at the Bear.
