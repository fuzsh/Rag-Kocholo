        "text": "Tonight's the night that a new batch of celebrities, politicians, and unsung heroes will be awarded a royal honour in the King's New Year's honours, but what do the titles mean?\n\nIt is one of the most respected honours in Britain - recommended by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and awarded by King Charles III. They often go to people who have made significant achievements, or committed themselves to serving their country. The government says the aim of the honours system is to credit people who \"made achievements in public life\", and \"committed themselves to serving and helping Britain\", who have \"usually have made life better for other people or be outstanding at what they do\".\n\nThe list is one of two which are published - one ahead of the new year, and the other coinciding with the King's official birthday in June. Although awards often go to famous faces, it isn't always the case; local heroes are also recognised for their efforts in their own community. Those on the list can end up with one of several different titles, so here's a breakdown of what they mean.\n\nCompanion of Honour\n\nThis honour - the highest available - goes to people who have made a significant contribution to the arts, science medicine or government over a long period of time. A maximum of 65 living people can be a Companion of Honour at any one time.\n\nCurrent recipients of this title - founded by King George V in 1917 - include David Attenborough, Ian McKellen, JK Rowling, Paul McCartney and Maggie Smith.\n\nCurrently there are four vacancies for a Companion of Honour due to the deaths of figures including Dame Vera Lynn.\n\nKnight or Dame\n\nReceiving a knighthood dates back to medieval times, as does the method used to confirm the honour; the touch of a sword on the shoulder by the king or queen.\n\nMen who receive a knighthood are given the title, Sir, while women are called Dame. The award is for making a major contribution in any activity, usually at national level.\n\nWell known Dames include Judi Fench, Helen Mirren, Kelly Holmes, Julie Andrews and Jessica Ennis to name a few, and Sirs including Lewis Hamilton, Michael Caine, Alex Ferguson, and Paul McCartney.\n\nCBE\n\nThe Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) is the next honour below a knighthood, and goes to people who have had a prominent role at national level - but slightly lesser than someone who receives a knighthood - or a leading role at national level.\n\nAnyone who has made a distinguished or innovative contribution to any area can also receive a CBE. The CBE is one of three Orders of the British Empire that were issued during the First World War, along with OBE and MBE, and is the highest of those three particular honours.\n\nOBE\n\nOBE stands for Officer of the Order of the British Empire and goes to people who have a major role in their line of work and made them known nationally or within their specialist subject.\n\nCricketer Ben Stokes, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, journalist Anne Diamond, and Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody all have OBE's.\n\nMBE\n\nThe third and final honour in this section is the MBE, Member of the Order of the British Empire. The government website says this honour is for \"an outstanding achievement or service to the community\". \"This will have had a long-term, significant impact and stand out as an example to others\", the description adds.\n\nBritish Empire Medal\n\nThe British Empire Medal, or BEM, is for those who have an active role in their local communities. That includes those who have done long-term charity or voluntary work, or \"innovative work of a relatively short duration (three to four years) that has made a significant difference\".\n\nThe BEM was scrapped in 1992 but brought back 20 years later by David Cameron. Around 300 people receive the honour every year.\n\nEveryone who receives one of the honours listed above is invited to an investiture ceremony, traditionally at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. There, a senior member of the Royal Family officially appoints them, however recipients can start using the title as soon as it's publicly announced."
