        "text": "A blue plaque has been unveiled in honour of Barnsley broadcasting great Sir Michael Parkinson.\n\nSir Michael, who died aged 88 on 16 August, interviewed the world's biggest names on his long-running chat show.\n\nThe Cudworth-born star, who started his career in journalism on the Barnsley Chronicle, went on to have a TV career spanning seven decades.\n\nThe plaque, organised by Barnsley Civic Trust, was unveiled by his son Mike Parkinson.\n\nHe said: \"I think it would have meant an awful lot to him, because he never actually forgot his roots at all.\"\n\nMr Parkinson said his father had \"loving parents\", but that the community he grew up in was also important to him.\n\n\"He never felt unloved, he never felt unsafe, he was able to go to a library, to be encouraged to read, he did listen to music.\"\n\nAttendees at the event at the Dorothy Hyman Stadium in Cudworth included cricketing icon and Parky's life-long friend Dickie Bird.\n\nMr Bird said the plaque meant a lot to him as he was still not over the loss of his friend.\n\n\"He was my closest friend we shared some wonderful, wonderful memories together.\n\n\"I shall miss him.\"\n\nSir Michael was born on 28 March 1935, the son of a miner.\n\nHis father, determined that his son would not follow him down the pit, took his son down into one of the narrowest seams in Grimethorpe Colliery - an experience that made him determined to seek an alternative career."
