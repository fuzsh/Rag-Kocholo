        "text": "Sir Michael Caine, CBE (born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite; 14 March 1933) is an English actor. He won Academy Awards for best supporting actor in both Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), and The Cider House Rules (1999).\n\nCaine is one of only two actors nominated for an Academy Award for acting (either lead or supporting) in every decade from the 1960s to 2000s (the other one being Jack Nicholson). In 2000, Caine was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, in recognition of his contribution to cinema.\n\nCaine was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in St Olave's Hospital, Rotherhithe, Southwark in South East London, the son of Ellen Frances Marie (n√©e Burchell), a cook and charlady, and Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, a fish market porter. His father was of part Irish and Irish Traveller ancestry, and a Catholic, though Caine was brought up in his Protestant mother's religion."
