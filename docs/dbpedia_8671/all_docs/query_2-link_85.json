        "text": "Newly crowned Olympic 100m champion Noah Lyles has already made history in Paris and he's aiming to complete a very special double on Thursday night. The 27-year-old American could become the first man since Usain Bolt to complete an Olympic sprint double if he picks up gold in the 200m final.\n\nHe won 100m gold by five-thousandths of a second from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a dramatic photo finish on Sunday. The 27-year-old, winner of three golds at last year's World Championships, became the first American to win an Olympic 100m title for 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nAlong with the medal, he'll also be aiming to smash Bolt's long-standing 200m world record of 19.19 seconds - further cementing his name in the history books.\n\nREAD MORE: Team GB star Keely Hodgkinson's tumour battle, not being a 'one-hit wonder' and dreaming of gold\n\nLyles is also expected to participate in the men’s 4×100 metres relay final, and has openly advocated for a spot on the men’s 4×400 team as well, in a bid to achieve something Bolt never did by winning four golds in one Games.\n\nRead on to find out more about the star.\n\nEarly life in Florida and track success\n\nNoah Lyles was born on July 18, 1997 in Gainesville, Florida to parents Kevin Lyles and Keisha Caine. He has a sister called Abby and a brother called Josephus, who is also an athlete.\n\nHe was a gymnast in his youth and started track and field at age 12, first taking up the high jump before switching to sprints. He's said of his sporting prowess: \"I was born into this sport. Me and my younger brother Josephus got into it together through our parents who used to run.\n\n\"We have always been surrounded by track. Track was what I loved from the start. If I can be on a track, then I can be happy. It always saved me.\"\n\nSince turning professional in July 2016, he has notched up an impressive string of accolades, including Olympic bronze, six world titles, and four Diamond League Final trophies. At the 2023 World Championship in Budapest he retained his 200m crown from 2019 and 2022.\n\nIn the process, he claimed a rare sprint treble, winning gold in the 100m, 200m, and the 4x100m relay - the first man to do so since Usain Bolt in 2015.\n\nMental health struggles\n\nLyles has been open with his struggles with mental health - a subject that other athletes have previously been reluctant to open up about. In August 2020, he said in a tweet that he had started to take antidepressant medication.\n\nHe later shared that his struggles began during a two-month stay in Europe for training and competition before the 2019 World Championships in Doha, Qatar - the prolonged period away from home leading to homesickness and depression. He said he was reluctant to continue training and family members noticed signs of distress during a Christmas visit.\n\nHe's said of this time in his life: \"So that's when I started ringing my personal therapist on a regular basis, and it was going well for a time, but once coronavirus hit and the Black Lives Matter movement started happening, it created the perfect storm. I didn't feel like it was very hard to share, as I'm constantly talking about mental health.\"\n\nLyles flew to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics with the 2019 world 200m title under his belt and was the favourite to become the first American to claim gold in that event since 2004. Instead, he finished third in a stadium that was near-empty stadium as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAfterwards, he opened up about his lifelong battle with anxiety and depression and the difficulty of balancing the benefits of antidepressant medication with side effects that led to weight gain and affected his ability to perform – ultimately electing to wean off the treatment before those Games.\n\nBefore heading to Paris he said: “I get to finally say, I’m showing up to an Olympic Games not depressed and it feels amazing. It’s a lot of joy, a lot of joy, even though there’s hard times in the moment I can always think back to the last Olympics and be like, ‘no, this one is not the same’. This one is way better and I’m ready to show it.\n\n“If I lose this time, it’s not going to be because I beat myself, it’s just gonna be that they had to be that much better. But to be honest, when Noah Lyles is being Noah Lyles – nobody (can).\"\n\nDealing with superstardom in Paris\n\nLyles has not shied away from courting attention, declaring his intent on recently-released Netflix documentary Sprint to become the face of his sport and elevate athletics’ appeal in the process. He freely admits he's showman who performs better in front of a full house.\n\nHe said he remembers the moment on the start line in Tokyo when he would usually say to himself “it’s showtime”, but instead found himself thinking “this is not it. This is not fun. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted”.\n\nHe says that “the line between confidence and cocky can be so blurred” but brushes off anyone who might not fully understand his “vision”, his signature bravado mitigated by memories of being the dyslexic kid with asthma, who struggled in school and was told he would never achieve his athletic ambitions.\n\nIn Paris he is one of the most recognisable faces in the Olympic athletes’ village and has spoken about the difficulties of managing his mental health with his new echelon of fame.\n\nHe said: “I’ve become kind of popular in the village. Unfortunately, that has come with its own set of challenges in being able to find my own space whether that’s eating or training in the gym. I know some athletes like to leave the village and have their own hotels but I like to enjoy the whole Olympic event, being with other athletes and stuff like that, but it has come with its own challenge of, you know, finding my own safe place.\n\n“It’s been kind of hard for me to find that within the village and I don’t want to leave. It’s definitely something I feel like after this Olympics, I’m gonna have to have conversations higher up than me, and whoever is in charge of that, making that more available or just more aware, because I’m not even the most popular person in the village.\n\n“I know I’m not the only one who’s had to deal with situations like this, and I just talked about that to bring that to people’s attention. We might be superstars in your eyes, we still are human beings, and we do want to be able to have our space and our time.\"\n\nFashion, love for LEGO and life outside sport\n\nThe sports star's official Paris Olympics profile notes that his hobbies include \"painting (especially shoes), watching anime, making music and building complex LEGO creations\". The fashion-forward star has walked the runway at Paris and Milan Fashion Weeks and likes to paint his nails to mark the big occasions and wears themed necklaces to match his hair.\n\nIn an interview in 2018, ahead of the Birmingham Diamond League, he said: \"I have a lot of interests and art is my biggest love. Lego is another one. I have a whole Lego city that I’m building piece by piece and brick by brick and box by box and people actually like it.\"\n\nBut when asked if there was anything he couldn't do, Lyles admitted: \"I’m not actually that good at traditional learning. Or math or writing. I actually have dyslexia, which actually makes things hard for me and people see in my tweets that I spell things wrong.\"\n\nHe said he uses an app to help him get his spelling right but added: \"There’s different words so I might end up putting a wrong word so the grammar is off. I do have my limits.\"\n\nStar wants his own shoe\n\nAsked what he wants next, Lyles told interviewers: \"I want my own shoe\". He added: \"I want my own trainer — I'm dead serious. There ain't no money in spikes, it's in sneakers.\n\n\"And even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker. I feel like for how many medals we bring back, for the notoriety we get … the fact that that hasn't happened, that's crazy to me. I was like, 'Yeah, that needs to happen.' \"\n\nThe new Usain Bolt?\n\nLyles has long been an admirer of retired sprint superstar Usain Bolt but has expressed his desire to break the Jamaican's longstanding records in the 100m and 200m events.\n\nHe said last year: \"I've always known that I'm the fastest man in the world. Well, in my head, I think I'm going to break it. I'm planning to break it.”\n\nHis profile is on track to be as big as Bolt's- with a beaming smile and personality to match - but Lyles is adamant that he isn't the next Bolt. The two stars met after a race in Bolt's homeland of Jamaica last year, with Lyles saying the star was nothing but encouraging to him.\n\nHe said: \"Bolt coming down and giving me his respects and me giving him my respects, it was kind of like, 'Wow', He said, 'Just keep doing what you are doing'.\"\n\nHowever Lyles is firmly his own man, saying: \"I am the new Noah Lyles.\"\n\nPersonal life and romance\n\nNoah Lyles' girlfriend is Jamaican track star Junelle Bloomfield, who's also an Olympian. The couple, who are both representing their countries at the Paris Olympics 2024, celebrated their second anniversary during the Games.\n\nThey first met through social media in 2017 but did not pursue their relationship after sparks failed to fly on their first date. According to Cosmopolitan, Bromfield originally reached out to Lyles via Instagram in 2017.\n\nLyles then contacted Bromfield again and asked for a second chance and they went Instagram official in December 2022. They now live together in Florida.\n\nThe men's 200m final will take place at the Saint Denis stadium at 7.30pm on Thursday night. It will be broadcast live on BBC One."
