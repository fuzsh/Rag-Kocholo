Proceeds from the gala ceremony support BAFTA Los Angeles’ ongoing education, scholarship, community outreach and archival projects.\n\nThe first Britannia Award was presented to Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli, pioneer producer of the James Bond films. Since the awards were first created in 1989 Britannia Awards have been given to Michael Caine, Tom Cruise, Robert De Niro, Clint Eastwood, Colin Firth, Tom Hanks, Dustin Hoffman, Anthony Hopkins, the late Stanley Kubrick (in whose name an award is now given), George Lucas, Sean Penn, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Dame Elizabeth Taylor, Chris Nolan, Emily Blunt, Sean Penn, Dame Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet and Denzel Washington.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter\n\nHelena Bonham Carter, a two-time Academy Award® nominee, earned her most recent Oscar® nod for her performance in 2010’s award-winning, true-life drama “The King’s Speech,” directed by Tom Hooper. For her portrayal of Elizabeth, the wife of King George VI, she also received Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award® nominations, and won BAFTA and British Independent Film Awards. Additionally, the stars of “The King’s Speech” won a SAG Award® for Outstanding Motion Picture Cast.\n\nBonham Carter also recently garnered a Golden Globe nomination and won an Evening Standard British Film Award for Best Actress for her performance as Mrs. Lovett in Tim Burton’s 2009 screen adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,” opposite Johnny Depp in the title role. In 2010, she reteamed with Burton and Depp for the fantastical adventure hit “Alice in Wonderland,” and they are currently reunited on the thriller “Dark Shadows,” based on the cult classic television series and slated for release in 2012.\n\nBonham Carter was honored with her first Oscar® nod, as well as Golden Globe, BAFTA and SAG Award® nominations for her work in the 1997 romantic period drama “The Wings of the Dove,” based on the novel by Henry James. Her performance in that film also brought her Best Actress Awards from a number of critics organizations, including the Los Angeles Film Critics, Broadcast Film Critics, National Board of Review and London Film Critics Circle.\n\nShe had made her feature film debut in 1986 in the title role of Trevor Nunn’s historical biopic “Lady Jane.” She had barely wrapped production on that film when director James Ivory offered her the lead in “A Room with a View,” based on the book by E.M. Forster. She went on to receive acclaim in two more screen adaptations of Forster novels: Charles Sturridge’s “Where Angels Fear to Tread” and James Ivory’s “Howard’s End,” for which she earned her first BAFTA Award nomination.\n\nBonham Carter’s early film work also includes Franco Zeffirelli’s “Hamlet,” opposite Mel Gibson; “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein,” directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh; Woody Allen’s “Mighty Aphrodite”; and “Twelfth Night,” reuniting her with Trevor Nunn.\n\nShe went on to star in David Fincher’s “Fight Club,” with Brad Pitt and Edward Norton; the Tim Burton-directed films “Big Fish,” “Planet of the Apes” and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”; and the actioner “Terminator Salvation,” directed by McG. In addition, she has starred in such independent features as “Novocaine,” “The Heart of Me,” “Till Human Voices Wake Us” and “Conversations with Other Women.” She also lent her voice to the animated features “Carnivale”; Tim Burton’s “Corpse Bride,” in the title role; and the Oscar®-winning “Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.”\n\nBonham Carter’s recently starred in “Toast,” directed by SJ Clarkson, where she plays Mrs. Potter, the stepmother of renowned food writer and chef Nigel Slater.\n\nIn her current film, Bonham Carter plays Death Eater and fanatical Lord Voldemort devotee Bellatrix Lestrange. She originated the role in the 2007 hit “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” and also played Bellatrix in “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” and “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1.”\n\nOn the small screen, Bonham Carter earned both Emmy and Golden Globe Award nominations for her performances in the telefilm “Live from Baghdad” and the miniseries “Merlin,” and a Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal of Marina Oswald in the miniseries “Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald.” She also starred as Anne Boleyn in the British miniseries “Henry VIII,” and as the mother of seven children, including four autistic sons, in the BBC telefilm “Magnificent 7.” More recently, she starred in the BBC biopic “Enid,” playing renowned children’s storyteller Enid Blyton.\n\nBonham Carter’s stage credits include productions of “The Woman in White,” “The Chalk Garden,” “The House of Bernarda Alba” and “Trelawny of the Wells,” to name a few.\n\nBonham Carter can be seen next starring as Dr. Julia Hoffman in Tim Burton’s “Dark Shadows,” in theatres May 2012.\n\nBAFTA Los Angeles\n\nThe British Academy of Film and Television Arts' outreach programs in Los Angeles benefit members and other professionals working within the entertainment industry, as well as the Los Angeles community at large.
