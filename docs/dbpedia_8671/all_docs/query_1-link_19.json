        "text": "It's set to be a good weekend for Benedict Cumberbatch, as it looks like the actor is due to be awarded a CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours on Saturday.\n\nAccording to* The Sun*, the Sherlock star is receiving the CBE in recognition for his services to drama. FYI this is just one rank below a knighthood.\n\nThe 38-year-old was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar in February for his portrayal as Alan Turing in The Imitation Game, but was beaten to the post by Eddie Redymane who played Stephen Hawking in* The Theory of Everything*.\n\nNot everybody is lining up to offer their congratulations for his CBE. Many have criticised the decision, claiming the actor has yet to win a major acting award and is too young to receive the lifetime achievement recognition.\n\n\"We shouldn't treat the honours system like the Tony Awards or an Oscar,\" said MP Nigel Evans. \"This is something which should be seen as for lifetime achievements, not an award because someone's last movie was good.\" He added.\n\n\"We do run the risk of dolling things out to people too early, perhaps in anticipation of some greatness they might achieve later on,\" he continued."
