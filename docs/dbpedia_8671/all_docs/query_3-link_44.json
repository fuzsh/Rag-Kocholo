        "text": "What's It All About? An Autobiography By Michael Caine Illustrated. 521 pages. Turtle Bay Books/Random House. $24.\n\nPerhaps the most amusing story the film actor Michael Caine tells in his autobiography, \"What's It All About?,\" which comes from the title of the song in his hit film \"Alfie,\" is the account of his first appearance as a professional actor. In 1952 at the age of 19, he stepped onto a stage in a small country town in Sussex, England, with his fly unbuttoned. The laughter in the audience that this provoked made him forget the single line he was supposed to speak, \"Come along with me, sir.\" He reports, \"When one of the actors whispered it to me, his voice was so soft I did not hear what he said and I replied, 'What?' in a normal voice.\" Though the play was not a comedy, the audience's laughter swelled.\n\nBorn in 1933 and named Maurice Joseph Micklewhite after his father, who was a fish-market porter in London, Mr. Cain knew as early as the age of 4 that he wanted to be an actor. But there were few in the profession with whom he could identify. Most of the ones he read about had first been taken to the theater by their nannies, which made them seem alien to him.\n\nWhat makes his story potentially of special interest is that he is part of an entire generation of British working-class artists who came to prominence in the 1960's and, in his opinion, even accounted for the decade's extraordinary vitality in England. They arrived with a chip on the shoulder, by Mr. Cain's account, and it was their anger that made England swing.\n\nUnfortunately, aside from dropping the famous names of his cohort and expressing resentment at being referred to in the British papers by \"that most insulting of all epithets -- 'Cockney actor Michael Caine,' \" the author has little of interest to say about this eruption of talent. There are not even many anecdotes to match the one about his clumsy debut. Mainly he mentions the more than six-dozen films he has made, boasts about the women he has slept with and lists the names of the many famous people he has got to know along the way. It is an astonishing coincidence how many of these figures are ones he had always admired and wanted to meet or work with.\n\nHe does relate how after changing his name to Michael Scott he discovered that there was already an actor by that name on the list of Equity, the British actors' union. Sitting in Leicester Square and racking his brain he noticed the movie-theater marquis where \"The Caine Mutiny\" was playing. \"Cain was the brother of Abel, who was cast out of Paradise, and I felt great sympathy with him at the time.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
