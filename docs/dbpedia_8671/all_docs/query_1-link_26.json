        "text": "In Michael Caine’s new movie, Youth, the 82-year-old actor gives a masterful performance, perhaps even the best of his career. He’s playing one of those brooding, ruminating life-meets-art-meets-life characters that are purpose-built for superannuated movie legends — think John Wayne in The Shootist, Marcello Mastroianni in 8½, or Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino.\n\nHe is Fred Ballinger, a classical composer holed up in an exclusive Swiss sanatorium, reflecting ruefully on his retirement (“I am retired, but I haven’t forgotten how it’s done”), on his epic career, the failures of his personal life and, ultimately, on the ageing process itself. At a key moment he wonders aloud, half-aghast, “I have grown old without understanding how I got here.”\n\nIt’s a breathtaking turn,"
