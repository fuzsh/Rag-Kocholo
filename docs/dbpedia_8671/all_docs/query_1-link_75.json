        "text": "Sir Michael Caine, Zandra Rhodes and John Frieda were among the stars who paid tribute to Vidal Sassoon at a memorial service in London on Friday.\n\nThe hairdresser, who invented the \"bob\" hairstyle which came to epitomise the Swinging Sixties, died at his home in Los Angeles in May, aged 84.\n\nSpeaking before the service at St Paul's Cathedral, fellow hairstylist John Frieda said: \"On a personal level he had so much enthusiasm and he was fascinated by everything that was going on and just really an extraordinary man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVidal Sassoon (pictured in 1964) styling Mary Quant's hair in his signature bob\n\n\"On a professional level I don't think there is anyone in our industry that has achieved what he achieved. He was a man that completely revolutionised the industry in a way no one else ever has.\"\n\nSassoon's widow, Ronnie Holbrook, was joined by a host of celebrities from the fashion, film, art and design industries.\n\nActor Sir Michael Caine said: \"It is a sad day but we get a chance here to celebrate his life.\"\n\nSassoon was married four times and was made a CBE in 2009. Some of his most famous clients were designer Mary Quant, the model Jean Shrimpton, actress Mia Farrow and film star Terence Stamp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSir Michael Caine was among those at the London memorial on Friday\n\nSassoon gave Farrow the pixie haircut for her role in Rosemary's Baby. He told The Telegraph last year: \"When I got to her there were bits that were about an inch and bits that were 10in.\n\n\"She didn't tell me what had happened. Her bone structure was beautiful. I told her that we had to go very short.\"\n\nSassoon's friend and colleague Nicky Clarke said: \"He was always an unbelievably humble man for what he created.\n\n\"I think that he never wanted to stop learning about his craft right to the end.\n\n\"He was a revolutionary. There is no doubt about it, the people that are around today, including myself, certainly owe a huge debt to him.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSassoon, who died after a battle with leukaemia, began his career as an apprentice during the Second World War.\n\nSassoon (pictured in 1977) was made a CBE in 2009\n\nBorn to Jewish parents, he also fought with the Israeli army in the War of Independence in 1948 and founded the Vidal Sassoon International Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism in 1982.\n\nOn his return to the UK after the Israeli war, Sassoon worked for famous London hairdresser Raymond \"Mr Teasy-Weasy\" Bessone before opening his own Bond Street salon in 1958.\n\nHe launched his own line of products in 1973 with the now-famous slogan: \"If you don't look good, we don't look good.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTelevision presenter Tania Bryer was the last person to interview Sassoon before he died.\n\nShe said: \"I think the secret of his success was his positivity. I don't think people realise what a tough childhood Vidal had. His father abandoned the family and his mother could not afford to keep him and his brother."
