I am not a remake.\n\nThere I am see, playing with my pals on Leith Links in the glorious sunshine when this geezer comes over wiv a camera. What's happening here I says to myself. What's 'is game? Is he goin' to get between me and the girl dogs?\n\nWell, wouldn't you know. Turns out he wasn't interested in stoppin' me chasing a bit of girly dogs round the park after all. Though he did grab my lead when I went shootin' off after one cute little thing that barked on by.\n\nNo, he just wanted to snap a few pics of my glorious cuteness for this blip thing he does. At least that's his story.\n\nWell, why not I say. After all, those girls out there need somebody gorgeous like me to look at now don't they?"
