        "text": "The British honours system rewards high-profile, celebrated people with Honours, Decorations and Medals for their achievements. From Hollywood film stars like Kate Winslet and Joanna Lumley to Second World War veteran, Sir Captain Tom Moore, these honours can be awarded to anyone for their outstanding achievements.\n\nThey are awarded twice a year by the reigning monarch. The first takes place a few days before the end of the year and is known as the New Year Honours. 2023 was the first issued by King Charles III.\n\nAlthough it has yet to take place in 2023, the King's Birthday honours list usually takes place on the monarch's state birthday in June. The recipients are announced officially in The Gazette.\n\nWho gets the awards?\n\nA special committee decides who gets the honours and the type that they will receive. This then goes to the prime minister before the King has the final say.\n\nAnyone can nominate someone for an honour on the gov.uk website.\n\nThe awards\n\nDifferent awards are received depending on the person's achievements. These are the awards in order of precedence:\n\nGBE, KBE or DBE (Knight or Dame) - Knight or Dame of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Both of these ranks allow the recipient to use Sir (for men) or Dame (for women) before their forename. Twiggy and Maureen Lipman are both Dames and so is Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nCBE - Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Kate Winslet has a CBE.\n\nOBE - Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Vivienne Westwood has an OBE.\n\nMBE - Member of the Order of the British Empire. Adele has an MBE.\n\nBEM - The British Empire Medal is awarded for military service.\n\nCompanion of Honour - This is given to people who have made a significant contribution to the arts, science, medicine or the government over a long period of time. Sir David Attenborough has one of these and so does Judi Dench.\n\nWhat is the Order of the British Empire?\n\nThe British honours system has various different orders, but the Order of the British Empire was created in 1917 by George V during WWI to honour the achievements of those on the front line.\n\nThe awards were first given to members of the armed forces but now are given out to members of the public too.\n\nMBE meaning\n\nAn MBE is awarded to someone for having a \"major local role in any activity, including people whose work has made them known nationally in their chosen area.\" Notable MBE winners include The Great British Bake Off's Nadiya Hussain, Adele, all of the Beatles, and TV chef Ainsley Harriott.\n\nWhat is an OBE?\n\nAn OBE is awarded to someone for \"outstanding achievement or service to the community. This will have had a long-term, significant impact and stand out as an example to others.\" Vivienne Westwood, actress Kiera Knightly, actor Eddie Redmayne, actress Naomie Harris, Downton Abbey's Jim Carter, actor Ewan McGregor, both David and Victoria Beckham and James Corden are all celebrities who have been given this honour.\n\nWhat is a CBE?\n\nA CBE is given to someone who has a \"prominent but lesser role at national level, or a leading role at regional level. You can also get one for a distinguished, innovative contribution to any area.\" Celebrities with CBE awards include Benedict Cumberbatch, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zita-Jones, Joan Collins and Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nWhat is a knighthood?\n\nWhile a CBE, OBE and MBE are some of the top-ranking honours, only the top two ranks can use the title \"Sir\" or \"Dame\". People awarded a GBE, KBE or DBE can use these titles.\n\nThe very top rank in the Order is a GBE - a Knight or Dame Grand Cross - but these are very rare. Since 2000, only 16 have been given out. Actress Emma Thompson is amongst the recipients who have received an award as well as Michael Caine, Julie Andrews and Rod Stewart,\n\nOnly British people can be made a Sir or a Dame, but foreigners can be given an honorary KBE/DBE. An example of this is fashion designer, Ralph Lauren, Bill Gates and also Angelina Jolie.\n\nThese are awarded to those who have made a major contribution in any activity, usually at a national level. They are traditionally presented using a touch of the sword by the King or Queen.\n\nSir David Attenborough awarded a second knighthood\n\nIn 2022, Sir David Attenborough was awarded a second knighthood for his services to television broadcasting and conservation. He was first knighted back in 1985, but he's now being appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael And St George which is a much higher accolade.\n\nWhat does an honour entitle you to?\n\nThose selected for an honour will be invited to attend an \"investiture\" ceremony where the King, or sometimes another member of the Royal family such as Prince William or Princess Anne, will award them with their insignia - a medal - of the order.\n\nThis usually takes place shortly after the honours list is announced, but recipients can start using their new title or letters after their name as soon as the awards are announced.\n\nThose with honours can also have their award added to their coat of arms showing their membership of the order.\n\nNew Years Honours 2023\n\nIn his first Honours list, King Charles awarded actor Stephen Graham an OBE for services to drama and an MBE Frank Skinner for services to entertainment. Frank admitted that he did not tell his family about the news due to believing it was \"some sort of administrative error\".\n\nLead guitarist of the rock band Queen and astrophysicist Brian May was knighted for services to music and charity.\n\nEngland captain Leah Williamson was made an OBE while her teammates Lucy Bronze, Beth Mead and Ellen White scooped MBEs.\n\nOther well-known names on the list of 1,107 recipients are artist Grayson Perry, athlete Denise Lewis and fashion designer Mary Quant.\n\nNew Years Honours 2022\n\nLast year saw actressesJoanna Lumley and Vanessa Redgrave become Dames. \"It was an extraordinary shock,\" Joanna told BBC News. \"I put my head in my hands and sobbed like a baby.\n\nJames Bond actor Daniel Craig was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.\n\nFinancial guru Martin Lewis was appointed CBE for services to broadcasting and consumer rights while EastEnders' June Brown (Dot Cotton) and William Roache (Ken Barlow) in Coronation Street - have been appointed OBEs, both for services to drama and charity.\n\nPresenter and activist Katie Piper was appointed OBE for services to charity and victims of burns and other disfigurement injuries and Good Morning Britain presenter Kate Garraway was appointed MBE for services to broadcasting, journalism and charity.\n\nHas anyone refused an honour?"
