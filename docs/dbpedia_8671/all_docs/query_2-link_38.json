        "text": "Sir Michael Caine has confirmed his official retirement from acting at age 90.\n\nThe veteran British actor announced the news in an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today show on Saturday.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nMichael Caine Doesn't Understand the Need for Intimacy Coordinators: 'In My Day, You Just Did the Love Scene and Got on With It'\n\nMichael Caine Says He's 'Sort of Retired Now': 'I Am Bloody 90, and I Can't Walk Properly'\n\nMichael Caine Slams U.K. Report Claiming 'Zulu' Could Incite Terrorists and Far-Right Extremists: 'Biggest Load of Bulls--'\n\n“I keep saying I’m going to retire. Well, I am now,” Caine said. He had previously suggested his retirement was imminent in an interview with The Telegraph last month, saying he was “sort of” retired.\n\nHis final turn on screen is in Oliver Parker’s “The Great Escaper,” a biographical film about World War II veteran Bernard Jordan breaking out of a care home to attend the 70th anniversary commemoration of D-Day in 2014. The film was released on Oct. 6.\n\nCaine reflected on the success of his career and the parts that are likely to be offered to him at his age.\n\n“I’ve figured, I’ve had a picture where I’ve played the lead and it’s got incredible reviews,” Caine said. “The only parts I’m likely to get now are old men, 90-year-old men, maybe 85. And I thought, ‘Well, I might as well leave with all this — I’ve got wonderful reviews. What have I got to do to beat this?'”\n\nHe added, “You don’t have leading men at 90, you’re going to have young handsome boys and girls.”\n\nHowever, he does find value in older people being portrayed on screen: “With me, it’s not quite as diminishing as you think,” he explained. “I remember when I was young talking to old men of 90 and they weren’t a little bit like me. They were little tiny old men with humped shoulders…And I thought, I’m not like that and it’s changed.”\n\nCaine’s career has spanned several decades and genres. He became a household name in the 1960s starring in classic films like “Zulu” and “The Italian Job.” He has collaborated several times with Christopher Nolan, playing Alfred Pennyworth in the director’s “Batman” films and also appearing in “Inception” and “Interstellar,” among other Nolan titles. He’s been featured in comedies like “Alfie” and “Austin Powers in Goldmember.”\n\nCaine has received several accolades throughout his career, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performances in “Hannah and Her Sisters” (1986) and “Cider House Rules” (2002). Caine was also knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nAwards Season Calendar (2023-2024): Key Dates and Voting Schedule for Upcoming Oscars, Grammys and Other Ceremonies\n\n50 Pop Culture Halloween Costumes for 2023: From Barbie to Ahsoka\n\nSign up for Variety’s Newsletter.
