        "text": "“My favourite city in the world is London. I am a Londoner by birth and have travelled to many countries but there is nothing better than dining in one of London’s fantastic restaurants with my family. We are spoilt for choice. I love dining at Nobu, Scotts, Oswalds, River Café to name but a few of the amazing places London has to offer. Then I prepare for a wonderful Christmas with my family. We keep it very simple but I am happiest surrounded by my wife, children and grandchildren. What more can a man want.”\n\nSir Michael Caine CBE, Actor\n\n\"This month’s hotlister is the fantastic Sir Michael Caine whose debut novel, Deadly Game, will be available in the UK and US from Thursday 23 November. This stunning and explosive thriller is an extremely compelling book and the perfect read for these longer winter evenings”.\n\nJenny Halpern Prince\n\nBook: Deadly Game by Michael Caine\n\nSince Debenhams closed, the beautiful Arding and Hobbs building in Clapham Junction has lain empty….until now. From the team behind Canova Hall, Serata Hall and Martello Hall, Botanica Hall is breathing new life into the iconic building once more. On the corner of St John’s Road and Lavender Hill, opposite Clapham Junction train station, the team has restored the 200-year-old department store back to its former glory. Botanica Hall is an all-day restaurant and late-night bar serving coffee and breakfast by day while people hotdesk and delicious cocktails and coal-fired pizza by night. On the weekends, these guys also host a fabulous bottomless brunch - as voted by Grazia, Elle and CN Traveller. Evenings at the venue mirror Clapham Junction’s liveliness with DJs playing from the balcony until early hours on the weekends. Their cocktail list is one of the best around and there is also a range of gins distilled in-house by the team. Having perfected their distilling skills with on-site gin distilleries at Serata Hall and Teatro Hall, the team have you covered. Head into the Urban Distillery & Tasting Room, which boasts a 200 litre copper still “Henry’ - they distill, bottle and wax seal their vodka by hand. Open seven days a week from early morning to 2am (Friday and Saturday), Botanica Hall will cater to your whole day and bring some much missed vibrancy to that special corner of town.\n\nDrinks: Dover Yard\n\nBefore the heartstopping events of the 80s, way before Mike, Will, Eleven & the gang embarked on their heroic journeys, Hawkins was just a regular town with regular worries. It’s 1959 and a young Jim Hopper’s car won’t start, Bob Newby’s sister won’t take his radio show seriously and Joyce Maldonado just wants to graduate and get the hell out of town. When new student Henry Creel arrives, his family finds that a fresh start isn’t so easy… and the shadows of the past have a very long reach. Stranger Things: The First Shadow invites us back in time to explore the history of Hawkins and the origins of some key characters from the iconic Netflix series. Brought to life by a multi-award-winning creative team, who take theatrical storytelling and stagecraft to a whole new dimension, this gripping new adventure will take you right back to the beginning of the Stranger Things story – and may hold the key to the end. Book tickets now and head to the Phoenix Theatre on Charing Cross Road, to catch the action.\n\nFestive: Wishmas: A Fantastical Christmas Adventure\n\nWe always feel half guilty about mentioning Christmas so early but also half giddy at the prospect of all things festive.

In this warm, practical and witty book, ‘The book you want everyone you love to read’, No.1 Sunday Times bestselling psychotherapist Philippa Perry shows you how to approach life's big problems. How do you find and keep love? What can you do to manage conflict better? How can you get unstuck and cope with change and loss? What does it mean to you to be content? Are other people just annoying or are you the problem? With a healthy dose of sanity, Philippa Perry's compassionate advice could help you become a happier, wiser person.

Taking place annually in November (the 10th to the 19th this year) it has long been acclaimed for showcasing a heady mix of talent from around the world. The festival was created in 1992 by live international music producers, Serious and emerged from the long-standing Camden Jazz Week which was created in 1970; with the active support of the Arts Council England. Taking a mix of international and British artists and a commitment to education activity, the London Jazz Festival began to spread its wings. The aims of the festival still remain the same today; celebrating the place of jazz in a city which is at ease with its rich cultural diversity, and drawing in a multitude of venues across London who present the music, week in, week out, throughout the year. Our personal highlights of this year's lineup include: The Opening Gala, A celebration of the human voice, the festival’s spectacular opener again finds arranger/conductor Guy Barker and the full-strength EFG London Jazz Festival Orchestra framing beloved classics and new compositions for a wealth of vocalists; Catrin Finch and Aoife Ni Bhriain- Finch was royal harpist to HRH Prince of Wales, playing at palaces and for assorted royalty before turning her virtuosic skills to experimentation and cross-cultural collaborations including award-winning partnerships with musicians from Colombia and West Africa. Her pairing with Dublin-raised violinist Aoife Ni Bhriain, a shining star of both the classical and Irish folk music worlds, is a match quite possibly made in heaven; and lastly Irreversible Entanglements- a Chicago free jazz collective performing at the EartH (Theatre) on the 15th November. Book tickets and check out the full programme here.\n\nChristmas: Miracle\n\nFestive recommendation number two! From November 13th to December 23rd 2023 Miracle at Henrietta (The exquisite Hotel in Covent Garden) will provide the perfect pitstop for a cocktail. Hidden away on the mezzanine, guests are transported back in time to Christmas past, with a nostalgic take on festive décor. Perfectly paired with Miracle's cocktail styling, the space is inspired by a 70's Christmas home' with retro decorations and colored lights. An army of throwback Christmas ornaments, colourful lights, and an oversized fireplace transform the Hotel into a ravishingly retro space. It’s outrageously over the top but also a staple of so many peoples' Christmas events calendar now, for that very reason. Drinks include: CHRISTMAPOLITAN - Wheatley Vodka, elderflower, Carpano Dry Vermouth, spiced cranberry sauce, lime, rosemary, absinthe mist, ELFING AROUND - Broker’s Gin, mulled wine reduction, grapefruit shrub, aromatic bitters, orange bitters and SNOWBALL OLD-FASHIONED - Buffalo Trace Bourbon, gingerbread, aromatic bitters, wormwood bitters, orange essence. All the drinks are served in gloriously tacky Christmas vessels and you can grab snacks from the Italian Supper Club at Henrietta to accompany your drinks.\n\nCharities of the Month: Magen David Adom and International Committee of the Red Cross\n\nSince Saturday 7th October, thousands of people have been killed in Israel and Gaza. Humanitarian needs will increase, and people will need much more support in the weeks and months to come. One of the quickest ways to help support those affected is to donate to the Magen David Adom and International Red Cross appeals. Donations made to these appeals will go towards helping people affected by the conflict. Staff and volunteers from Magen David Adom (MDA) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were already on the ground when the violence broke out and have been supporting people by providing urgent medical help, ambulance support and first aid. To donate click both here and here.\n\nApp of the Month: The Self Compassion App\n\nThe Self-Compassion App is for you if you want to feel happier, calmer & more connected. Whether you get caught up in cycles of stress and anxiety, regularly give yourself a hard time or struggle to relax and enjoy the moment – this app can help. We are often our own harshest critic, talking to ourselves in ways that we would never do our close friends. Given that we spend more time with ourselves than anyone else, isn’t it strange that many of us don’t treat ourselves with the same level of kindness, care and support as we do our close friends? Now is your time to start. With evidence based ideas and exercises from CFT, this app will teach you how to cultivate compassion for yourself and others. Through the course, you’ll learn how to strike a balance between self improvement & self acceptance: teaching you how to have a realistic but kind view of difficulties that arise in life, and giving you the confidence you need to achieve your goals in life, work and relationships."
