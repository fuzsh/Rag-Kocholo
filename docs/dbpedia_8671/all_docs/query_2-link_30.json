        "text": "Cardi B / Belcalis Almanzar\n\nTo the world, she’s known as Cardi B, the larger-than-life rapper at the top of her game. Cardi B. dominated the charts with her hit single “Bodak Yellow.” Her signature trill “Okurrr” has even found special mention on Dictionary.com. Fans can’t get enough of her quirky humor and realness.\n\nAnd in the spirit of keeping it real, the rapper is quite open about what her name was before she made it big. Meet Belcalis Almanzar. Who would’ve thought, right? This majestic, almost ancient-sounding name contains Spanish translations of Arabic words where Belcalis alludes to the Queen of Sheba and Almanzar (from “al mandhar”) loosely translates to “watchtower.”\n\nMeghan Markle / Rachel\n\nMeghan Markle is known as the Duchess of Sussex these days, for better or for worse. But before that illustrious title, Markle was also called Rachel. We don't mean Rachel Zane in \"Suits.\" Confused? Allow us to explain. Rachel is actually her real name. Surprise, surprise.\n\nPeople close to the Duchess say she’s always preferred being called Meghan since university. She rarely uses or talks about her full name – Rachel Meghan Markle. And she hasn't explained why either. The Duchess only used it recently for official documentation. This was when she and Prince Harry were still active members of the Royal Family.\n\nShania Twain / Eilleen Regina Edwards\n\nIt’s hard to imagine Shania Twain having a different name. But it turns out she used to be called something completely different. The singer shared the origin story during a radio appearance. She was born Eilleen Regina Edwards but became Eilleen Regina Twain after her adoption. When fate decreed that she would become a professional singer, it warranted another name change.\n\nShe needed something that didn’t remind her so much of her grandmothers, literally. She was actually named after both her grandmothers – Eileen and Regina. What she needed was a beautiful name – something ethereal to best represent her star persona. And thus, Shania Twain was born. An excellent choice, we say.\n\nGigi Hadid / Jelena Noura Hadid\n\nGigi Hadid is this generation’s ultimate “it” girl. She’s walked for every major runway and also appeared on the cover of pretty much all the Vogues that matter (French, Italian, British, and American). Although most of her life is in the public eye, many people don't know her real name – Jelena Noura Hadid.\n\nJelena is a variant of the more common “Helena.” So, how did she get the name Gigi? It’s actually an adorable story. A teacher at school would routinely confuse her with another girl named Helena. Her mother affectionately called her “Gigi” at home. A young Jelena asked her teacher to call her Gigi instead, and the name stuck.\n\nVin Diesel / Mark Vincent\n\nThink action films and the name Vin Diesel comes to mind instantly. He’s among the few who possess the screen presence, physical appearance, and rough but lovable charm necessary to make it as an action star. And his name adds to the appeal. But long before his Fast and Furious fame, the actor used to be called Mark Vincent. Vincent worked as a bouncer at some seriously questionable clubs in New York City during the ‘80s.\n\nHis job involved literally fighting violent clubbers, so violent that bouncers had to go back home in groups after hours for their own safety. Bouncers never told anybody their real name, and Vincent’s peers began calling him Vin Diesel. The name stuck. Why Vin Diesel? “Vin” was a shortened version of his father’s last name, and “Diesel” since his friends thought he had too much energy.\n\nMiley Cyrus / Destiny Hope Cyrus\n\nMiley Cyrus was born Destiny Hope Cyrus. Her parents, Leticia Jean and Billy Ray Cyrus were convinced she was destined for success. Destiny and Hope seemed fitting and they named their daughter accordingly. Of course, their parental instincts proved right. She eventually became “Smiley” after her infectious smile as a toddler.\n\n\"Smiley\" would become \"Miley\" soon enough, and the rest is history. Although she’s better known as Miley Cyrus, the singer had also adopted the name “Ray” after her late grandfather, Ronald Ray Cyrus. The two were very close and after he passed, Miley wrote the song \"I Miss You\" to mourn his loss and cope with her grief.\n\nBruno Mars / Peter Gene Hernandez\n\nBruno Mars is the very definition of electric with his genre-defying music and moves. The artist’s moniker certainly helps live up to the reputation. But how did Bruno Mars get his name and what was he called before? He was born Peter Gene Hernandez in Honolulu, Hawaii. Peter Gene Hernandez doesn’t quite have the same ring to it.\n\nBut the origin of “Bruno Mars” began early. The singer explained once that he used to be a chunky baby, and so his father gave him the nickname Bruno after a wrestler named Bruno Sammartino. Mars came in much later when girls would apparently come up and tell him that he was out of this world. He’s been Bruno Mars ever since and we wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nLady Gaga / Stefani Germanotta\n\nBefore she created chart-topping hits and wore meat dresses to make a statement, Lady Gaga was just your average girl in New York City. It’s hard to visualize but true. And the proof is in the name – she was born Stefani Germanotta. The artist went by her real name for a long time when she was starting out her career.\n\nThe name “Gaga” came about one day in the studio, when her music producer said she reminded him of the song “Radio Ga Ga” by Queen. Instead of Stefani, everyone began calling her Gaga in the studio. And when her career started taking off, she wanted a new way to reinvent herself. In the singer’s own words, Gaga was apt because it was “sort of crazy” and the Lady in front of it packed in layers of multiple meanings.\n\nEmma Stone / Emily Stone\n\nTrue-blue Emma Stone fans already know that she was born Emily Jean Stone. The name change might be subtle but there was plenty of back and forth before she arrived at it. Stone explained in an interview that she ended up adopting the name Emma since another SAG member had the same birth name.\n\nShe first went with Riley Stone, only to realize that when people began calling her Riley on set, she had no idea who they were referring to! The actor even contemplated using Emily J. Stone because it sounded cool, a-la Michael J. Fox. But could she pull it off? She didn’t think so and decided to go with Emma, because it was the closest to Emily.\n\nReese Witherspoon / Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon\n\nReese Witherspoon was actually born Laura Jeanne Witherspoon. Did the name Reese originate out of the blue? Not really. The actor has shared that her mother’s maiden name is Reese. She preferred the name Reese over Laura or Jeanne. Adopting the name Reese was also a way to always honor her mother and keep her close.\n\nWe're not sure when she started using the name officially. But she did appear as Reese Witherspoon at the wee age of 14 in her first film “The Man in the Moon” (1991). The technicalities cease to matter really. She will always be Reese Witherspoon, infinitely loved by her fans.\n\nLana Del Rey / Elizabeth Woolridge Grant\n\nThe line between truth and fiction can be blurry when it comes to Lana Del Rey. Stories about the singer (bordering on myth) tend to gain more traction than who she really is. But there are some undeniable facts about Lana Del Rey, such as her real name – Elizabeth Woolridge Grant or Lizzy Grant if you were feeling casual.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the mysterious and enigmatic persona she’s been able to craft today. The singer went through several stage names before settling on Lana Del Rey. Mary Jailer. Sparkle Jump Rope. We don’t know about you but we’re glad those days and names are behind her. She allegedly zeroed in on her current name after deciding she wanted something exotic that reminded her of the seaside.\n\nFrank Ocean / Christopher Edwin Breaux\n\nFrank Ocean isn’t just a musician but a storyteller bar none. Few artists can weave narratives into their music like he does. Where does he get the gift? The man has innate talent, that’s for sure. But a lot of it has to do with the artist before “Frank Ocean,” back when he was known as Christopher Edwin Breaux. He grew up in New Orleans and witnessed the full onslaught of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nKatrina was devastating but the storm left a crop of new, deeper-thinking musicians in its wake. Breaux found success as a songwriter who went by the name Lenny Breaux. But his life changed in 2010 when he met Tyler Okonma and Odd Future. Frank Ocean, the artist we know and love, was born during this time. He’s even changed his name to Frank Ocean legally.\n\nTina Fey / Elizabeth Stamatina Fey\n\nRaise your hand if watching Liz Lemon from “30 Rock” has turned around a bad day, week, or month at some point in your life. The world is forever thankful to Tina Fey for all the laughs. She made history as the first woman lead writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and transitioned to a role in front of the camera as the anchor for “Weekend Update.\"\n\nA little-known fact about her is that her real name is Elizabeth. Elizabeth Stamatina Fey. Stamatina has Greek origins from her mother’s side and would inspire the moniker “Tina” which would make her a household name. The actor has always gone by the name Tina since elementary school.\n\nSnoop Dogg / Calvin Broadus\n\nNo other artist has evolved and thrived with the times like the incomparable Snoop. He was born Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. in Long Beach, California. People called him “Snoopy” when he was a child because of how much he loved the cartoon character. Broadus developed a talent for rapping when he was in school.\n\nLarge crowds would gather and cheer him on. The encouragement spurred him on to pursue music. The moniker Snoop Doggy Dogg was born when he started recording professionally. Soon, he caught the attention of Dr. Dre, and the world has been better for it ever since.\n\nLorde / Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor\n\nLorde, also known as Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor, has been singing professionally since age 12 when she signed a contract with the Universal Music Group. Someone slipped a recording of Ella performing at a school talent show, and the rest is history.\n\nShe had always been fascinated with royalty as a child, which eventually inspired her stage name “Lorde.” The appended ‘e’ in Lorde was a conscious choice since she felt “Lord” was too masculine sounding. The singer has said that while she likes the name Ella, it wasn’t too grand and she liked the idea of having a powerful, more magnificent alias.\n\nRicky Martin / Enrique Morales\n\nRicky Martin was originally born Enrique Jose Martin Morales. As a young boy, Enrique started touring with Menudo, a well-known Latin boy band, and achieved enormous success. It was almost everything a young boy could wish for. Almost. His family life was in shambles.\n\nHe couldn't spend time with either of his parents who by then were divorced. His father apparently gave him an ultimatum – choose his career or his family, an impossible position that the boy resented. So, he adopted the name Ricky to sever all connections with his father and his birth name. Thankfully, father and son reconciled in 1994.\n\nIggy Azalea / Amethyst Kelly\n\nIggy Azalea, originally Amethyst Amelia Kelly, spent most of her childhood in Sydney, Australia before moving to the United States. How did she get her stage name? Iggy is in reference to a beloved dog she had growing up while Azalea comes from the street she grew up in while living in Australia. She prefers that the world call her Iggy.\n\nBut unlike most other celebs who leave their old name behind completely, Iggy keeps hers close. Only a few people in her life are allowed to use her real name Amethyst. These people are, in her own words, “elite.” This 1% of people comprise those who know her very well. When they use her real name, the singer says it reinforces their special connection.\n\nCalvin Harris / Adam Richard Wiles\n\nCalvin Harris, famous for hits like “This Is What You Came For,” has been ubiquitous in the music scene for decades. Although fans are familiar with his tracks, not many know that he goes by a different name in real life. Harris's original name is Adam Richard Wiles. Like many artists, he too decided to adopt a moniker.\n\nHe wanted something that would go better with his soulful music style. At age 22, he officially took on the name Calvin Harris, explaining that it was an open, more ambiguous name. One you couldn't quite peg down to a geography. A universal name that hoped to appeal across races and faces. It also resonated with the ambiguous quality of his own music, blurring genres and styles across the spectrum.\n\nJennifer Aniston / Jennifer Anastassakis\n\nJennifer Aniston as Rachel Green in “F.R.I.E.N.D.S.” definitively established TV and sitcom history. Aniston had appeared in other TV shows before, but being Rachel Green was the turning point in her career. Interestingly, \"Aniston\" is not her last name but a showbiz legacy. Her father, John Aniston, was born Yannis Anistasskakis in Greece. He moved to the United States when he was young.\n\nHe officially changed Anistasskakis to Aniston while looking for acting work in the 1960s. The family name has been Aniston ever since. It seems that John not only passed down the family name to his daughter but talent too. She’s taken Hollywood by storm and remains a fan favorite even today. Her father was himself quite the star, having played the likes of Victor Kiriakis on “Days of Our Lives.”\n\nAlicia Keys / Alicia Augello Cook\n\nJust as her song \"You Don't Know My Name\" implies, there's more to the story behind Alicia Keys’s stage name. When she started out as an artist, she sought a stage name to replace her birth name – Augello Cook. Augello was her mother’s last name while Cook was her father’s last name. She spent most of her childhood estranged from her father, which explains why she might’ve wanted to shed her past and reinvent herself.\n\nThe search for a new name began. She considered Alicia Wild but her mother thought it sounded inappropriate. The two settled on “Keys” to symbolize the piano (her instrument of choice) and the various doors that the name might unlock. Today this R&B queen is worth over $150 million.\n\nTom Cruise / Thomas Mapother IV\n\nBefore achieving impossible missions and becoming the face of Scientology, Tom Cruise was just your average guy. His original name was Thomas Matopher IV, born in 1962 to parents with regular jobs – an electrical engineer and a special education teacher. His father, according to Cruise, was not a kind person and mistreated his children.\n\nWhen the actor’s career took off, he decided to drop the name Mapother altogether to distance himself from his troubled past. But people close to the actor say that he still uses his full birth name in private. His cousin, William Mapother continues to use the family name. Fans might remember him as Ethan Rom in the TV series \"Lost.\"\n\nNatalie Portman / Neta-Lee Hershlag\n\nNatalie Portman’s diverse filmography appeals to fans across genres. Each performance is as stellar as the next, from \"Thor\" and “Black Swan” to \"Star Wars.” The actor was born Neta-Lee Herschlag in her home country, Israel. Even though she began her career with her original name, she changed her first and last names for several reasons.\n\nHer dad is named Avner Hershlag while her mom’s name is Shelley Stevens. Years ago, her mother’s side of the family changed their last name from Edelstein to Stevens when they came to the United States from Russia and Austria. Natalie chose to change her last name for privacy reasons. She also chose “Portman” for sentimental reasons since her paternal grandmother's maiden name was Portman.\n\nPortia de Rossi / Amanda Lee Rogers\n\nPortia de Rossi is a great name choice for Hollywood. It’s unique, memorable, and rolls off the tongue like a sweet melody. The actor changed her birth name Amanda Lee Rogers when she was just 15 years old. Literature fans will be pleased to know that her stage name was indeed inspired by Portia from \"The Merchant of Venice\" by William Shakespeare.\n\nAs for her last name \"de Rossi,\" she explained that it sounded exotic to her as a teenager. The actor later mused that the decision to change her name at such a young age stemmed from being conflicted about her sexual identity. A name change was a great start in the journey to discovering her true self.\n\nElton John / Reginald Dwight\n\nReginald Kenneth Dwight was born in England in 1947. Two decades later, the world would sit up and pay attention when the same person transformed into the inimitable Elton John. Dwight left school at 17 to pursue music. He had an undeniable talent. The lad could play a tune on the piano note for note after listening to it once or twice. At 15, he even formed a band called Bluesology. Back then, his fans affectionately called him Reggie.\n\nIn 1967, he responded to an ad and that’s when he met lyricist Bernie Taupin. The two began working together, and their first song was \"Scarecrow.\" In 1968, Dwight changed his name to Elton John, inspired by two people from his old band – Elton Dean (saxophonist) and Long John Baldry (vocalist.) On January 7, 1972, he legally became Elton Hercules John.\n\nNicole Richie / Nicole Camilla Escovedo\n\nRemember the time when an entire generation grew up watching Nicole Richie and BFF Paris Hilton live “The Simple Life?” Reality shows today pale in comparison. Richie is also known for having a really famous father in the iconic Lionel Richie. But it might surprise some people when they discover that the singer is actually adopted. She was originally named Nicole Camille Escovedo. Lionel and his ex-wife Brenda Harvey-Richie cared for Nicole when she was a toddler.\n\nHer parents (friends of Lionel) were under considerable financial constraints. He and his ex-wife decided to adopt Nicole officially when she was nine years old. The couple didn't always agree on everything, but they were always on the same page when it came to Nicole. Lionel called her “a godsend.” Nicole feels the same way about her adoptive parents and often expresses her love for them on Instagram.\n\nBono / Paul Hewson\n\nPeople assume they know everything there is to know about U2 by now. This holds especially true for the band’s frontman, Bono – whose real name is Paul Hewson. But did you know he would rather his fans call him Bono at all times? He explained in an interview that the last person to use his real name was his father.\n\nBono and his bandmates chose monikers when U2 took off. Public figures have their own ways of maintaining privacy. Using stage names was one of the ways Bono kept some things sacred, worlds away from the glare of the public eye. He says some fans call him Paul, mistakenly thinking it is a way to connect to the singer. But it implies a closeness and intimacy reserved only for family and friends.\n\nCarmen Electra / Tara Patrick\n\nNobody’s born with an awesome name like Carmen Electra. You can bet there’s an interesting story behind it. Her real name wasn't as exciting – Tara Patrick. And although we know her from \"Baywatch,\" Patrick originally wanted to become a dancer. She attended several schools for the performing arts and modeling after high school.\n\nIn 1990, her professional dance career began. Life took a historic turn when she moved to Minneapolis, a city known for Prince's influence. She crossed paths with the music legend eventually at an audition. He was impressed by her dancing and said she looked like an “Electra.” “That should be your name,” Prince said. The name grew on her. And that’s how Carmen Electra was born.\n\nJamie Foxx / Eric Marlon Bishop\n\nJamie Foxx surprised many fans on “The Late Show” when he revealed that his real name isn't Jamie Foxx but Eric Marlon Bishop. The story goes back to 1990 when he began performing at a bunch of local clubs to kickstart his stand-up comedy career. Life as a struggling comedian was hard.\n\nBishop never got stage time and he noticed that female comedians often had an advantage in getting slots. He decided to use an androgynous stage name to up his chances. He finally chose the most gender-neutral name, Jamie, and “Foxx” as a tribute to Red Foxx, a stand-up comedian he admired and loved immensely. The name change paid off and he’s kept it ever since.\n\nDemi Moore / Demetria Gene Guynes\n\nA 2007 profile on Demi Moore explained that Demi is actually short for “Demetria.” Her real name is Demetria Gene Guyes. Admittedly “Demi” has more of an “it” factor for a Hollywood star. But Demetria is quite unique in itself. The actor’s mother found the name in a shampoo advertisement while flipping through the pages of a magazine.\n\nThe name Guynes came from the man Demi believed to be her father, Danny Guynes. As a teen, she discovered that her biological father was a man named Charles Harman. Despite this revelation, Demi continued to use her stepfather's last name until she married her first husband, musician Freddy Moore, and adopted his last name.\n\nJohnny Knoxville / Philip John Clapp\n\nJohnny Knoxville’s rise to fame has been unconventional. Few people in the comedy business can pull off crude and often risky pranks. But fans have loved the humor on “Jackass” ever since it debuted in 2000. Would Knoxville have been as successful using his real name, P.J. Clapp? Seems debatable.\n\nAnd it was a risk he didn’t want to take. \"Johnny Knoxville\" was born out of career necessity when he needed a catchy and memorable name for his magazine writing career. And so, he chose the name Johnny Knoxville by combining his middle name with the city he grew up in, Knoxville.\n\nBrie Larson / Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers\n\nBrie Larson is full of surprises. She released a solo album in the mid-2000s. Her first acting job was on Jay Leno's show. She even appeared in the movie \"13 Going on 30\" with Jennifer Garner. Blink and you might miss her in it! But what’s even more intriguing is the story behind how she adopted her stage name, Brie Larson.\n\nHint: she got the name from a favorite American Girl Doll. In 2015, the actor mentioned to Jimmy Fallon that her real name was Brianne Desaulniers. She changed it because she was tired of everyone mispronouncing her French surname. She loved the American Girl Doll, Kristen Larson, and decided to go with Larson as a last name. That way, she felt Kristen would always be part of her “family.”\n\nAndrew Lincoln / Andrew Clutterbuck\n\nAndrew Lincoln is today synonymous with \"The Walking Dead.\" No other actor could have done justice to Rick Grimes on the show. But the Andrew Lincoln we know and love today was called something entirely different years before. His real name is, wait for it, Andrew James Clutterbuck.\n\nHe used the name Clutterbuck until high school. He joined the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art Drama School soon after finishing school. During this time, he switched to the stage name Andrew Lincoln. He thought Clutterbuck sounded old-fashioned and stuffy – like a down-and-out character from the novel \"Hard Times\" by Charles Dickens.\n\nLucy Hale / Karen Hale\n\nMost of us know Lucy Hale as Aria Montgomery – a teenage girl tormented by a stalker in “Pretty Little Liars.” But an interview on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" revealed an open but rather well-kept secret. Lucy isn’t her first name. She was born and raised Karen Lucille Hale.\n\nThe actor revealed Karen is her first name but she’s always gone by Lucy since she was a baby. Her full name reflects her true-blue Tennessee roots. Why Karen Lucille? Lucy says it was probably a Southern thing where mothers aim to please all the women in the family. Baby names can be a big deal where she’s from. Karen Lucille doesn’t leave anyone out.\n\nJason Derulo / Jason Desrouleaux\n\nNot all celebrities opt for stage names that differ dramatically from their real names. Some make teeny tiny but effective changes. Jason Derulo is one such. The artist is known for frequently uttering his name in songs, which makes it even more interesting given his real last name is Desrouleaux.\n\nThe only difference is in the spelling but otherwise, Derulo and Desrouleaux sound the same when pronounced. Interestingly, his stage name is also his son's legal name. This revelation has recently caught the attention of some fans who made a beeline to his Wikipedia page. No surprise that this information has been under our noses all along! Delighted fans who are just now discovering Desrouleaux have compared it to a Harry Potter spell.\n\nLily James / Lily Thomson\n\nLily James was born Lily Chloe Ninette Thomson and went by the name for most of her life. Unlike other stories, the choice of stage name later on in her career was for deeply personal reasons. Her father James Thomson succumbed to cancer during the early 2000s. The loss shattered her since the two were close.\n\nThey shared mutual respect and admiration for each other. Most of all, an intense love for film was the glue that held it all together. It was her father's sense of humor that inspired Lily to explore more comedic roles. She decided to become Lily James instead of Lily Thompson in his memory.\n\nMichael Caine / Maurice Micklewhite Jr.\n\nSome fans might remember Michael Caine from classics like \"Alfie,\" and \"Get Carter.\" Younger generations know and adore him as Alfred in Christopher Nolan's \"Batman\" series among others. The actor’s real name is actually Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, but he had to change it since another actor had the same name in London's West End.\n\nThe name \"Caine\" came to him when he saw a poster for \"The Caine Mutiny,\" a film starring Humphrey Bogart. He didn't fully use the name Michael Caine in his everyday life until 2016 when increased airport security checks had become the norm due to the ISIS threat. His passport still showed a different name even though he was known as Michael Caine. He then officially embraced the name Michael Caine to avoid the airport hassle.\n\nShane West / Shannon Bruce Snaith\n\nShane West stole our hearts as the lovable Landon Carter in “A Walk to Remember” (2002). But he’s made several other appearances in “ER,” “Once and Again,” “Salem,” and the critically acclaimed “What We Do Is Secret.\" His family moved to California when Shane was 10 in search of a better life. Back then, he was called Shannon Bruce Snaith.\n\nThe name Shannon embarrassed him as a young boy. He thought it was too feminine. In high school, he used his middle name Bruce to feel better. When an acting career beckoned, the boy decided to change his name permanently to Shane West. After a period of struggle, Shane West made his acting debut in “Picket Fences” where he portrayed the role of Dave Lattimore.\n\nDove Cameron / Chloe Hosterman\n\nAs lovely as the name Dove Cameron might be, the origins were deeply painful. The actor has gone on record to explain that her father, Philip Alan Hosterman used to call her \"dove.\" He took his own life when she was just 15 years old.\n\nShe changed her name from Chloe Hosterman to Dove in his memory since she never got to say goodbye. The loss was profound. He had died shortly before her debut on \"Liv and Maddie.\" The family discovered later that he had also struggled with his sexuality. He passed without ever coming out to anyone. Cameron hopes to make a movie about him one day.\n\nNathan Lane / Joseph Lane\n\nThree-time Tony Award winner Nathan Lane originally had a different name. The story is, of course, hilarious in keeping with his persona. He was born Joseph Lane, but when he joined Actors Equity, he chose to go by Nathan Lane. It was an homage to a character he admired – Nathan Detroit. During his Broadway debut, director George C. Scott persistently called him Norman instead of Nathan.\n\nLane didn't feel comfortable correcting Scott at first. He even contemplated changing his name to Norman to make life easier! The actor eventually mustered the courage to correct Scott. Since then, Nathan Lane's career has been nothing but illustrious. He’s a force to reckon with in the theater world. But most fans might know him better as the flamboyant and acerbic Pepper in “Modern Family.”\n\nJane Seymour / Joyce Penelope Wilhelmina Frankenberg\n\nJane Seymour will forever be Jane Seymour, Medicine Woman for her fans. But her original name is Joyce Penelope Wilhelmina Frankenberg – a delightful mix of her upbringing in England and her parents’ Polish, German, and Dutch roots combined!\n\nEven at 17, Joyce Penelope Wilhelmina Frankenberg knew her name was quite a mouthful, especially since she wanted to pursue acting. She adopted the stage name Jane Seymour, presumably inspired by King Henry VIII's third wife, Jane Seymour. The actor began afresh with a new identity. We think it is safe to say that the re-christening has served her well ever since.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg / Caryn Elaine Johnson\n\nWho doesn’t know Whoopi Goldberg? You can’t help but love her, whether she’s playing the lovely Oda May Brown in “Ghost” or the hilarious Deloris Van Cartier in the \"Sister Act\" movies. Her distinct name only adds to the appeal. But Whoopi isn’t her original name and neither was she born a Goldberg.\n\nHer birth name is actually super conventional and takes you right back to the ‘50s. Meet Caryn Elaine Johnson. Surprising, isn’t it? So, how did she get her wild stage name? Whoopi comes from (you guessed it) a whoopie cushion. People said she reminded them of one. “If you get gassy, you’ve got to let it go,” explained the actor. Goldberg was her mother’s choice as a nod to their family’s Jewish heritage.\n\nPaul Wesley / Paweł Tomasz Wasilewski\n\nAsk any fan of \"The Vampire Diaries\" and each one is either team Stefan or team Damon. Look, nobody hates Damon. He’s crucial to \"The Vampire Diaries.\" But there’s something about Stefan Salvatore that speaks to the soul and it has everything to do with the actor who plays him — Paul Wesley.\n\nPaul Wesley was born Pawel Tomasz Wasilewski though. He knew early on that his birth name would be difficult for audiences to pronounce. He decided to change his name and sought his family’s consent before going through with it. Safe to say that being Paul Wesley has benefitted his career a great deal.\n\nTravis Scott / Jacques Berman Webster II\n\nShortly after “Days Before Rodeo” was released, Travis Scott shared the origin story of his stage name. For the uninitiated, the artist’s government name is Jacques Berman Webster II after his father. He also had a favorite uncle named Travis who was his superhero growing up.\n\nUncle Travis was, in Webster’s own words, “incredibly cool” with a distinct swag about him. At the same time, Webster was also a big fan of Kid Cudi whose original name is Scott Mescudi. The moniker Travis Scott is an homage to the two men he admires the most. Quite a fascinating backstory to a seemingly ordinary stage name.\n\nDavid Tennant / David McDonald\n\nDavid Tennant was iconic as Doctor Who. But who is he in real life? That’s the question. We know for sure that he wasn’t David Tennant by birth. His original name is David McDonald. When he joined the actors' union, he had to change his name because someone else already had it. McDonald was just 16 at the time. Teenagers know nothing about choosing a stage name.\n\nSo, he did the next best thing – flipped through a music magazine for inspiration and ended up picking \"Tennant\" after Neil Tennant from the Pet Shop Boys. It was the first thing that struck him while reading the magazine. He expressed how getting young teenage boys to choose a stage name isn’t the best idea because it could’ve gone any which way – David Sade, perhaps, or even something crazy like Bojangles McDuff!\n\nNatasha Lyonne / Natasha Braunstein\n\nThe actor best known for her role in the loopy series “Russian Doll” was born Natasha Braunstein. She plays a character trapped in a cycle of repeated deaths — a theme that resonates with Lyonne whose life and career have seen various transformations. When she was eight years old, her father Aaron Braunstein moved the family to Israel where he spent several years organizing fights.\n\nHer parents’ marriage ended after a few years. While Natasha's older brother, Adam, stayed in Israel, she returned to New York with her mother, Ivette Buchinger. Around this time, she also started using her middle name, Lyonne, as her surname and soon, it became official.\n\nJulianne Moore / Julie Anne Smith\n\nChances are that older millennials grew up watching Julianne Moore at some point. Think cult films such as “The Big Lebowski.\" When rom-coms took over, Moore appeared in several of them. Remember gems like “Crazy Stupid Love” and “Laws of Attraction?” But even the most dedicated cinephile may not know that Julianne Moore isn't her real name.\n\nShe was born Julie Anne Smith. The story behind her stage name is similar to other actors' — find an appealing stage name since other people shared similar government names. The actor wasn't thrilled but it had to be done. She decided to use both her parents' names so that nobody’s feelings would get hurt. Her mother was called Anne Smith while her father’s name was Peter Moore Smith.\n\nNiecy Nash / Carol Denice Ensley\n\nNiecy Nash is a familiar face in comedy circles. In fact, she’s elevated several comedy shows with her humor and mere presence. She’s a joy to watch and there’s so much more to Nash than her impeccable comic delivery. For instance, Niecy Nash is just a stage name, albeit an excellent one that seems made for her fiery personality.\n\nIt’s hard imagining her with a different name but she was born Carol Denice Ensley. She once explained that Nash is her ex-husband’s last name. They were married from 1994 to 2007 and had kids together. Nash later fell in love with best friend Jessica Betts. The pair got married in 2020 and since then, her official name has been Carol Denice Betts. The people closest to her still call her Carol or “Cora.”\n\nMartha Stewart / Martha Kostyra\n\nMartha Stewart personifies gracious living, an image so deeply embedded in the popular imagination that many mistakenly believe she grew up in a rural utopia. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned about Martha Stewart, the lady is full of surprises. She was born Martha Kostyra in Jersey City.\n\nShe took on the name Stewart after her husband, Andrew Stewart whom she met in college. So, who was Martha Kostyra? By all accounts, a straight-A student hustling to get by in a rough-and-tumble city. She attended Barnard College in New York City on a scholarship. A modeling gig on the side helped pay her bills.\n\nMacy Gray / Natalie McIntyre\n\nCan you believe over two decades have passed since Macy Gray’s iconic hit “I Try” took over the airwaves? You couldn’t miss that raspy, soulful singing voice anywhere, and why would you want to? She’s always been Macy Gray to the world but wasn’t born with the name. She’s actually called Natalie McIntyre, which essentially means the sky is down and the earth is up.\n\nWho would have thought? How did she settle on Macy Gray as a stage name? The story is unclear but a childhood bicycle accident helped her notice a mailbox of someone named Macy Gray. Years later, when Atlantic Records would sign her (despite her thinking her unusual voice wasn’t good enough), she decided to reinvent herself as Macy Gray.\n\nJudy Greer / Judith Evans\n\nJudy Greer was born Judith Theresa Evans. She chose to use “Greer,” her mother’s maiden name as her stage name and it’s served her well. In a world where actors come and go, Greer has achieved the impossible in Hollywood — securing longevity, that elusive holy grail! She's done it by playing the role of the sidekick, arguably the best one by far.\n\nGreer has portrayed the quintessential best friend in feel-good flicks such as “13 Going on 30” and “The Wedding Planner.” She’s also come into her own in dramas like “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.” What's her secret? A lot of hard work and contentment with never having to land star roles.\n\nKevin James / Kevin Knipfing\n\nKevin James is most famous for playing Doug Heffernan on \"The King of Queens.\" Sometimes it’s difficult to tell when Heffernan ends and James begins. His immensely likable ways on the show endeared him to fans the world over. But before he made it big on the show, he was Kevin George Knipfing, an aspiring comedian.\n\nMost fans don’t know his actual government name. While working on \"King of Queens,” the actor became good friends with Richie Minervini, the owner of a comedy club. During this period, he decided to use the stage name Kevin James as a tribute to his favorite teacher.\n\nJohn Legend / John Stephens\n\nLike most things related to the Grammy-winning singer, the story behind John Legend's stage name is intriguing. He was born John Stephens, but a friend of his began calling him John Legend much before his career took off. Fun fact: Kanye West beat him to the chase by revealing the name in one of his own recordings. Meanwhile, Stephens was still torn between using his birth name or John Legend as a moniker.\n\nLegend was more memorable, he thought. Things took an interesting turn when he discovered there was someone else who went by a similar name — Johnny Legend, an adult film producer. Their respective managers reached out and negotiated a deal. John Legend and Johnny Legend would continue co-existing without ever having to meet.\n\nBlake Lively / Blake Brown\n\nBlake Lively never thought she would be in showbiz for as long as she has. There was a time when she wanted to continue studying rather than act. But all of that changed when she landed the role of Bridget in “The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants.” In 2007, she was cast as Serena van der Woodsen in “Gossip Girl” and TV entertainment hasn’t recovered from the mania since.\n\nLively and husband, Ryan Reynolds are always in the news. But did you know that her real name is Blake Brown? Her parents Ernie Brown and Elaine Lively named her Blake Ellender Brown when she was born. Deciding to forgo tradition, Ernie Brown decided to adopt his wife’s last name, Lively, meaning everyone in the family used the same name.\n\nAaron Paul / Aaron Paul Sturtevant\n\nAaron Paul is charming beyond a doubt. Who else can have you rooting for a meth-making drug dealer on screen? The proof is in the accolades. Aaron Paul has won two Emmys for his portrayal of Jesse Pinkman in “Breaking Bad.” What’s more, the name Aaron Paul doesn’t sound like a stage name, but it actually is.\n\nHe was born Aaron Paul Sturtevant in Emmet, Idaho before moving to Los Angeles for acting work. He shortened his name to Aaron Paul since his last name might be a doozy for fans to pronounce. Paul is among the lucky few who didn’t need dramatic, sometimes disorienting name changes to make it in Hollywood.\n\nTim Allen / Timothy Dick\n\nTim Allen’s government name is Timothy Alan Dick. There came a time when he felt compelled to change his name and not for the reason you’re thinking. The story goes back to the ‘70s when he was arrested for possession of illicit substances. A period of waiting before the trial began.\n\nTo pass the time, he began performing standup comedy under the name Tim Dick. Tim ended up serving a sentence and got out after two years. Redemption arrived on a local talk show that offered him a job. But there was a slight problem. The producer was reluctant to use a former felon's name on screen. And so, Tim Allen was born. You can't make this stuff up.\n\nKate McKinnon / Kathryn McKinnon Berthold\n\nIs there anyone Kate McKinnon can’t mimic? Her repertoire includes everyone from Justin Bieber to Betsy DeVos. She’s also appeared in movies and television, lest we forget. McKinnon is so much more than a comedian on \"Saturday Night Live.\" She consists of multitudes.\n\nBut like many TV personalities, she decided to get a moniker when starting out in the business. Her real name is Kathryn McKinnon Berthold. She goes by Kate McKinnon since Kate is short and familiar. It’s also easy to pronounce and remember for New Yorkers who don’t have enough time or head space for anything extra.\n\nBruce Willis / Walter Willis\n\nThink of the quintessential action movie and you’re likely to hear a chorus of “Die Hard!” across the universe. A large part of that is thanks to Bruce Willis. He’s been on the scene for decades and has come a long way from the days when he was called Walter Bruce Willis. Plus, very few people know that he grew up in West Germany.\n\nHis biographer suggests that the actor may have changed his name professionally to leave his childhood behind. It wasn’t easy growing up for a child with a stutter. As Bruce Willis, he underwent a complete revamp as the toughest, most dependable action hero who’s also unafraid to bare all quite literally.\n\nErykah Badu / Erica Abi Wright\n\nErykah Badu’s birth name is Erica Abi Wright. She was born in Dallas, Texas where she began singing at the wee age of four. Her godmother, Gwen Hargrove took charge of immersing the young girl in music from a young age. She was soulful even as a child, wise beyond her years.\n\nThere came a point when young Erica decided to change the spelling of her name to Erykah. She thought Erica was “a slave name.” “Kah” has Egyptian roots which loosely translated means “inner self” or “inner light.” She went a step further and adopted “Badu.” Badu was her favorite scat sound.\n\nElizabeth Banks / Elizabeth Mitchell\n\nElizabeth Banks's career began with small roles in shows before she graduated to more prominent parts in series like \"Scrubs\" and \"Modern Family.\" She's also been a part of some beloved big-budget movies, including the \"Hunger Games\" and \"Pitch Perfect\" franchises. What you may not know is that the actor owes her career to someone named Elizabeth Irene Mitchell.\n\nThat's her real name too incidentally, but she couldn't use it professionally. An established actress with the same name existed already. Fans of “Lost,\" feel free to jump in and explain. Meanwhile, this Elizabeth chose \"Banks\" because she wanted something shorter to contrast with her longer first name.\n\nMichael Ian Black / Michael Ian Schwartz\n\nMichael Ian Black has a dizzyingly extensive resume. The man has appeared in over 50 film and television projects, most of them as \"himself.\" The versatile actor has also taken on caricatured versions of himself in some instances, such as “Michael & Michael Have Issues” on Comedy Central.\n\nIt's worth noting an added layer of complexity to these credits if one knows the origin story behind how he got his stage name. He was originally born Michael Schwartz but adopted the last name Black to prevent possible confusion with anyone else in Hollywood who might share the same last name.\n\nOlivia Wilde / Olivia Jane Cockburn\n\nOlivia Wilde’s star has risen steadily and surely. It seems like only yesterday when the actor was starting as Remy Hadley in “House” and Alex Kelly in “The O.C.” Wilde today is one of the most recognizable faces in television. Like most stars, she had to find a stage name for herself but the story behind it is unique. She was born Olivia Jane Cockburn to a family of writers and journalists.\n\nWhen she began acting, her mother thought it a good idea for her daughter to have her own identity. A stage name would not only give her that but also distinguish her from their family of writers. Around this time, Olivia was playing Gwendolyn in “The Importance of Being Earnest.” So, she decided to adopt the last name Wilde after Oscar Wilde.\n\nZayn / Zain Javadd Malik\n\nZayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson first came together as One Direction on \"The X Factor\" in 2010. The world hasn’t been the same since, and that’s not even an overstatement. 1D saw enormous success. Zayn Malik was a founding member but left the group after five years.\n\nHis name is actually spelt “Zain” which is Arabic for “beautiful.” The singer changed the spelling to Zayn before auditioning for \"The X Factor\" since he thought it sounded more appealing. His full name is Zain Javadd Malik. After leaving 1D, he decided to drop his last name since it sounded too formal. Today he’s just Zayn and prefers it that way since it sounds more “personal.”\n\nNicki Minaj / Onika Tanya Maraj\n\nNicki Minaj has always hated her stage name. The rapper says it wasn't her first or last choice by a long shot. So how did she get the iconic moniker? She was somewhat strong-armed into it. In a 2012 interview, the rapper explained that her real name is Onika Tanya Maraj.\n\nWhen she was first signed to a label, a music record executive changed her last name Maraj to “Minaj” because he insisted it sounded better. She fought him on it but eventually gave in. Gradually, her first name Onika gave way to Nicki. She didn’t mind that bit. She had never liked her first name either.\n\nDrake / Aubrey Drake Graham\n\nThis name change is self-explanatory. It’s hard to imagine a credible rapper named Audrey or Graham, although it sounds like fun in theory. His middle name Drake was given to him by his father. As far as monikers go, Drake is one of the best ones out there. The rapper explained in an interview that he didn’t know why his father had given him the name.\n\nHe described his father as “a character,” so his reasoning behind the name could’ve been anything. But Drake loved the name and embraced it. It’s who he was every day. Aubrey was another individual for different settings – more proper and well-behaved which he couldn’t admit to being all the time.\n\nNina Dobrev / Nikolina Kamenova Dobreva\n\nIt’s hard to imagine Nina Dobrev as anyone but Elena Gilbert on “The Vampire Diaries.” And it's also strange to think that her name isn't actually Nina Dobrev in real life. She was born Nikolina Konstantinova (or Kamenova, depending on the source) Dobreva. The Bulgarian-born actor shortened her name to Nina when she started out in Hollywood.\n\nAs the story goes, she thought Nina Dobrev was easier to pronounce and remember. Many celebrities feel they need to change the beautiful names they were born with. Sadly, that’s the reality of show business. Whether as Nina or Nikolina, she's memorable either way and a fan favorite for the ages.\n\nBob Dylan / Robert Allen Zimmerman\n\nIt’s common knowledge that Bob Dylan is infinitely elusive. On the rare occasion that the artist agrees to an interview, typically more questions are raised than answered. Among those questions is why he changed his birth name – Robert Allen Zimmerman – to Bob Dylan. Several theories exist. Some people say the name is inspired by poet Dylan Thomas.\n\nBut the musician has vehemently disagreed on record, with choice words on the kind of people he thought enjoyed a Dylan Thomas poem. Bob Dylan was among several monikers he toyed with. He couldn’t decide between Robert Allyn, Bobby Dylan, or Robert Allyn. Bob Dylan was what stuck in the end. As for the reason behind it, we may never know.\n\nMichael Keaton / Michael John Douglas\n\nThe story behind Michael Keaton’s stage name is similar to many other actors. Union rules prevented two actors from sharing the same name. Unfortunately, a very famous Michael Douglas already existed in Hollywood back then. He thought about using Mike Douglas, but a TV show host had the same name. In the end, he decided to go with “Keaton” and it wasn’t for a specific reason.\n\nThe actor happened to be looking through names beginning with “K” and Keaton sounded “good enough.” Keaton says he’s trying to ease back into his birth name, not without misadventure. Say he’s at an airport and someone holds up a sign with Michael Douglas but Michael Keaton shows up instead. It’s amusing for him but confusing for the rest of the world still.\n\nKaty Perry / Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson\n\nKaty Perry started out as a gospel singer under her real name, Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson. Those are two facts about the singer that stump most people. She decided to use her mother’s name Perry as a moniker only in 2017 after signing with Capitol Records. She created the character “Katy Perry” for protection and self-preservation.\n\nThe singer explained in an interview that if she showed up as Katheryn Hudson, the world wouldn’t think she was glamorous enough. Plus, she no longer wanted to be Katheryn Hudson. She had been sad and lonely her entire childhood. Being Katy Perry was her shot at leaving all of it behind.\n\nAlice Cooper / Vincent Damon Furnier\n\nHow did Vincent Damon Furnier become Alice Cooper? The story goes back to when his band used to be called The Nazz. Another band was already using the name, so it was back to the drawing board. They decided to completely upend people’s expectations by forgoing the broody dark names for something all-American and wholesome-like.\n\nThe name Alice Cooper was born as if this band could’ve been somebody’s aunty. Remember that Furnier wasn’t named Alice Cooper. He was just the lead vocalist in the band. Everybody began calling him Alice, however. They assumed that must be his name. Alice stuck and at that point, he changed his name legally to Alice Cooper.\n\nDavid Bowie / David Robert Jones\n\nBefore Ziggy Stardust and The Starman, there was David Bowie. But before all three was a man named David Robert Jones. The star who would go on to become one of the most influential artists the world has ever seen grew up as boy-next-door David in London’s suburbs.\n\nHe began singing in a local band as a young boy, deeply taken by Hollywood and pop culture. At 18, he became David Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones, frontman for The Monkees. When an American fan first wrote to Bowie asking him why he changed his name, the singer said his manager had made the decision saying, “Nobody’s going to make a monkee out of you.”\n\nMeg Ryan / Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra\n\nMeg Ryan was born and raised Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra. She never intended to take up acting but fell into it out of necessity. After completing journalism at UConn, she moved to New York and enrolled in media studies at NYU. During this time, she started taking on roles in commercials to help pay the bills.\n\nHer talents soon landed her a role in “As the World Turns,\" after which there was no looking back. She decided to pour all her energies into becoming an actor. She dropped out of NYU and changed her name to Meg Ryan — her grandmother’s maiden name.\n\nDiane Keaton / Diane Hall\n\nBeing an icon seems to come easy for Diane Keaton. She’s been setting trends ever since her defining role in “Annie Hall” during the 1970s. Nobody else could’ve taken on the role, partly because it was actually written for the actor. Director Woody Allen reportedly wrote the part especially for her.\n\nHer real name was Diane Hall but she often went by a nickname, “Annie.” That’s how Annie Hall was born. That still leaves Keaton, and why she adopted the surname. There was already a Diane Hall in the union, so she ended up choosing “Keaton” since it was her mother’s maiden name.\n\nBrad Pitt / William Bradley Pitt\n\nBrad Pitt is arguably one of the most famous people on the planet. It’s hard to think that he could be anything other than Brad Pitt but long ago, in what seems like alternate reality, he used to be called William Bradley Pitt. This one takes some time to get used to.\n\nIn true Hollywood fashion, the actor decided to give his identity a complete makeover. A name change was the first step. He thought \"Brad Pitt\" sounded no fuss, to the point, and sweet. All of that was true. But Brad Pitt would come to be associated with many other adjectives and turns of phrases, such as “Sexiest Man Alive.”\n\nAudrey Hepburn / Audrey Kathleen Ruston\n\nIt's rare to find someone who isn't familiar with Audrey Hepburn. Hepburn was unlike anyone else in Hollywood. She had a rare talent and beauty. But some part of her uniqueness stemmed from her unusual childhood in the Netherlands where she was born Audrey Kathleen Ruston. Her parents had sympathies for the Nazi regime. During the war, she secretly aided the Resistance even as she grappled with acute malnutrition.\n\nThat legendary waif-like frame? It was a result of her having to eat ground tulips to survive. Much before she was discovered and landed the lead role in \"Gigi,\" she had already adopted the name Audrey Hepburn. It helped her break free from her parents' connections to fascism which she felt strongly about. It could've also harmed her career prospects.\n\nCary Grant / Archibald Leach\n\nWhen Cary Grant played a man with multiple identities in “Charade,” the story must have resonated a bit since he used to be called Archibald Leach in a previous life. He was born with the name and kept it until he decided to seriously pursue acting. In 1931, he met B.P. Schulberg, Paramount Pictures general manager who was impressed by his talents.\n\nLeach secured a contract with the studio on the condition that he find a name more appropriate and American sounding. Archie Leach just wouldn’t do for a leading man in Hollywood. Together they came up with Cary Grant and he adopted the name legally about a decade later in 1941.\n\nMarilyn Monroe\n\nBefore the world knew Marilyn Monroe as an actor, she was born with the name Norma Jeane Mortensen. She was later baptized as Norma Jeane Baker. But Monroe made a conscious choice to change her identity long before she joined Hollywood. She had been using the name Marilyn instead of Norma Jeane for about a decade before it became official.\n\nShe adopted the stage name to give herself a better start in the industry. When she signed with 20th Century Fox, a studio executive changed her name to \"Marilyn\" because she reminded him of the Broadway actress Marilyn Miller, and “Monroe” after Norma’s mother’s middle name.\n\nAlbert Brooks / Albert Einstein\n\nNobody in Hollywood would risk their career with the name Albert Einstein. The pressure to live up to the eminent scientist would’ve been crushing. The mad scientist jokes would’ve practically written themselves, and Albert Brooks was having none of it. He was born into a showbiz family as Albert Einstein, why the name we’re not sure yet.\n\nPerhaps it was some sort of inside joke since his father was a well-known radio comedian. His mother was a singer. His brother Bob Einstein didn’t have to go through the trouble of changing his name. When asked about why he became Albert Brooks, the comedian responded with, “Do I even have to answer?”\n\nMindy Kaling / Vera Mindy Chokalingam\n\nVera Mindy Chokalingam noticed that most emcees couldn't pronounce her last name. And so, they butchered it or (surprise surprise) made fun of it. For their sake and mostly her own, she decided to shorten her name to \"Kaling.\"\n\nShe also chose her middle name \"Mindy,\" given by her mother since she had watched \"Mork & Mindy\" on repeat while she was pregnant with her daughter. It paid off because who today doesn’t know Mindy Kaling? She slayed as Kelly Kapoor in “The Office.” She's a mother, a writer, and a producer. She also created and starred in her own show, \"The Mindy Project.\"\n\nSpike Lee / Shelton Jackson Lee\n\nSpike Lee’s real name is Shelton Jackson Lee, but everyone calls him, “Spike.” His mother gave him that nickname because he was a scrappy, rough-and-tumble kind of child. Nobody else could’ve found a truer name for the boy. “Spike” has been the core of who he is since forever.\n\nThe essence of \"Spike\" also comes through in his excellent body of work as a filmmaker. Today he’s known for creating compelling films that challenge stereotypes and address controversial issues of race with care and nuance. He’s played a significant role in opening up Hollywood to black talent more than anyone else before.\n\nHelen Mirren / Ilyena Lydia Vasilievna Mironov\n\nIf someone called Ilyena Lydia Vasilievna Mironov were on a guest list, you might think a Russian aristocrat was coming to dinner. But no, you would be having dinner with Helen Mirren! She was born into an immigrant family in London with an intriguing background.\n\nShe was the daughter of a former Russian diplomat (Vasily Petrovich) who preferred living a modest life in London instead of encountering the Bolsheviks. He began working as a cabby. Her father and British mother changed the family name from Mironov to Mirren. The anglicization was imperative to get by in London during the 1950s. She adopted the name Helen when she began acting."
