        "text": "Excellent and riveting\n\nAn insight into some fascinating heists and crimes, but, GeForce né, the last episode left me with more questions than answer. It feels like they’re only getting started!\n\nCan’t wait for more\n\nThis is a fantastic podcast, brilliantly narrated, and cleverly edited. I hope there are a lot more where this came from.\n\nGreat Story Telling\n\nNot suspenseful but that wasn't what they were going for. Great stories and Michael Caine is great as always. Worth your time.\n\nNeed more Michael Caine\n\nYEAH the music can be a little much sometimes but all around awesome story and presentation. I wish there were more!\n\nDoesn't Work\n\nI always get an error code when I try and download this podcast. I have tried many times.\n\nWonderful!\n\nThis series is great! The stories are so interesting, and Michael Caine does a very good job as narrator.\n\nMichael Caine's narration is wonderful!\n\nCaptivating stories, well written! Michael Caine's narration was wonderful, as though he was a witness. I'd love to see video footage of the performances.\n\nInteresting Look at Famous Heists\n\nThis was an interesting look at several different types of heists and includes interviews with the people who pulled them off, police who brought them to justice and some of the victims in addition to several journalists. Noted actor Michael Caine, who has played nearly all sides in his long and storied career, presents the tales. Also features an interview with the creator and several experts about the mindset of the people who pull them. Entertaining and informative.\n\nAwesome Tales\n\nOne of the best things I've found on here. Absolutely love Mr. Caines narrations with the always thrilling and intriguing stories of grand heists. The topic of heists along with counterfeiters has always been captivating to me whether told in movies or on these audio episodes, there are some great stories. I hope to see this continue with more episodes!!!! I mean who doesn't like a bunch of clever and cunning people pulling off the biggest heists in the world and with Mr. Caine doing the narrating it makes this an even better. Give it a whirl if you like true crime heists stories. You won't regret it!"
