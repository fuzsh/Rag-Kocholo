        "text": "Sports Roundup\n\nA round-up of the weekend's major sporting events\n\nFlorin Orban, 09.01.2023, 13:45\n\nThe women’s handball sides\n\nrepresenting Romania in the Champions League obtained some remarkable results\n\nlast weekend. On Saturday, in the competition’s group A, CSM Bucharest secured\n\na 35-26 win against Banik Most of the Czech Republic. Cristina Neagu scored\n\nmost of the goals for the Romanian side, nine, helping them to consolidate\n\ntheir first position in the group’s ranking with 17 points. They are followed\n\nby the last year’s winner of the trophy, Norwegian side Vipers Kristiansand\n\nwith 15 points. CSM will be up next against Danish side Odense.\n\nIn group B, Rapid on Sunday\n\nclinched a 39-29 home win against Montenegrin side Buducnost Podgorica. The\n\nDutch Estavana Polman scored six goals for the hosts, pushing them to the third\n\nplace in the group with 16 points, the same number of points as the team on the\n\nsecond place, Hungarian side Gyor, and a point less than the group’s leader,\n\nMetz of France. Rapid will be up against Esbjerg of Denmark on the latter’s\n\nhome turf.\n\nRomanian side SCM Râmnicu Vâlcea started\n\noff on the right foot in the European League with a home win against Hungarian\n\nside Vác, which they defeated 40 – 30, in group D. Iryna Glibko of Ukraine and Asma\n\nElghaoui of Hungary were the hosts’ best scorers each with nine goals. Valcea\n\nwill be taking on Paris 92 in an away game on Sunday.\n\nAustralia is these days seeing a\n\ncouple of tennis tournaments in preparation for the year’s first Grand Slam\n\ntournament in Melbourne. Irina Begu was the best Romanian player in the\n\naforementioned tournaments. Begu made it to the semifinals of the Adelaide\n\nInternational 1, with more than 826 thousand dollars in prize money. The\n\nRomanian was stopped in her tracks by Arina Sabalenka of Belarus, who won the\n\nmatch in two sets, 6-3, 6-2. Begu won 43, 323 dollars and 185 WTA points while Sabalenka\n\neventually won the tournament with a 6-3, 7-6 win against Linda Noskova of the\n\nCzech Republic. In the Adelaide\n\nInternational 2 tournament, Sorana Cirstea of Romania lost in the first round\n\nto Beatris Haddad Maia. The Brazilian won the match 7-6, 6-1. Irina Begu is\n\ndirectly qualified for the competition’s main draw and will be taking on Storm\n\nHunter of Australia.\n\n(bill)"
