        "text": "The North Peace Hockey League (NPHL) is a Canadian men's Senior ice hockey league based in Northern Alberta and North Eastern British Columbia. With a history that dates back to the early 1950s, the NPHL has the distinction of being the longest continually running senior hockey league currently in existence in western Canada. The league was down to two teams (Peace River Stampeders and High Prairie Regals) in the early 1970s, when it played an interlocking schedule with the South Peace Hockey League.\n\nContents\n\nNorth Peace Hockey League\n\nDefunct\n\nNotable players\n\nReferences\n\nPrior to the start of the 2009-10 season, the league voted to disallow any team playing AAA hockey from competing in the NPHL playoffs. This change affects teams competing for the Allan Cup. Despite this decision, the Fort St. John Flyers hosted, competed at, and won the 2010 Allan Cup.\n\nDespite its long-standing tradition, the NPHL and its teams have struggled to stay on the ice. The 2013-14 season saw the league lose two teams when the Hythe Mustangs folded near the end of the season and the Lakeland Eagles were removed from league play.\n\nThe 2014-15 saw the league lose two more teams when the Dawson Creek Sr. Canucks and High Prairie Regals opted out of the upcoming season. The result was a six team league.\n\nFor the first time in league history the 2015-2016 season seen the Grande Prairie Athletics take a leave of absence due to a lack of players. Fortunately both the Dawson Creek Canucks and High Prairie Regals returned making the league feature an East and West division once more."
