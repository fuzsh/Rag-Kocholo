Depending on the history of COVID-19 infection (between March 2020 and June 2021) patients were divided into two groups. The main group included 416 patients (63.2 %) aged 40 (33; 47) years who had history of COVID-19 (343 (82.5 %) with mild, 56 (13.5 %) with moderate-to-severe course, 17 (4 %) with severe course); the comparison group included 242 (36.8 %) patients aged 41 (32.8; 47) years who did not have COVID-19. Results. There was a statistically significant increase of systolic blood pressure (SBP) (from 127 to 129 mm Hg, p = 0,006), number of hypercholesterolemic (from 6,7 % to 48,3 %, p < 0.001) and overweight patients (from 40.1 % to 75.9 %, p < 0.001).

In addition large prevalence and direct socioeconomic losses, the potential impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is of particular concern since there is an evidence of a more severe course of the disease in both patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (RFs) and established CVDs. The results of numerous studies indicate the mutual aggravation of the COVID-19 course and cardiovascular pathology. It has been shown that from15 % to 70 % of deaths are registered in patients with cardiovascular pathology accompanying the COVID-19. The pathogenesis of cardiovascular damage in the background of inflammation are complex and include the effects of hypoxia, systemic proinflammatory effects, direct myocardial and vascular endothelial damage [1]. Currently, more and more data are being collected on the consequences of this infection — specifically, that the acute phase of COVID-19 is the beginning of the continuum on the way to recovery. According to a study by O'Hearn M. et al., most admissions due to new coronavirus infection occur in patients with concomitant cardiometa-bolic disease [2]. The authors estimate that among 906,849 admissions, 30 % occurred in patients with obesity, 26 % with arterial hypertension (AH), 20 % with diabetes mellitus (DM) and 12 % with heart failure. The mean age of admitted patients was 63 (51-74) years, including 1678 (61.2 %) males and 1063 (38.8 %) females.\n\nThe meta-analysis of 56 studies included 159,698 patients with COVID-19 and showed that acute cardiac injury (odds ratio (OR) 13.29, 95 % CI 7.35-24.03), arterial hypertension (AH) (OR 2.60, 95 % CI 2.11-\n\n3.19), heart failure (OR 6, 72, 95 % CI 3.34-13.52), cardiac arrhythmias (OR 2.75, 95 % CI 1.43-5.25), cardiac heart disease (CHD) (OR 3.78, 95 % CI 2.42-5.90), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (OR 2.61, 95 % CI 1.893.62) were significantly associated with mortality [3]. Cardiac arrhythmias (OR 7.03, 95 % CI 2.79-17.69), acute cardiac injury (OR 15.58, 95 % CI 5.15-47.12), CHD (OR 2.61, 95 % CI 1.09-6.26), CVD (OR 3.11, 95 % CI 1.59-6.09) and AH (OR 1.95, 95 % CI 1.41-2.68) were also significantly associated with the admission to intensive care unit in patients with COVID-19.\n\nData fro m the ACTIV international registry both involved outpatients (n = 1057, men 41.91 %, women 58.09 %) and inpatients (n = 4751, men 46.39 %, women 53.61 %) of the Eurasian region with COVID-19 showed more severe clinical couse in patients with comorbidities in admitted patients who were older than outpatients. The median age was higher in those with the more severe course of COVID-19 (lower and upper quartiles: Q1-Q3) 59.0 (50-69) and 49.9 (38-60) years, respectively]. Moreover, females tended to have the severe course of COVID-19 more often than males (53.6 %). Obesity (OR 1.079, 95 % CI (0.8291.404, p = 0.57) and AH (OR 3.123, 95 % CI 2.946-4.852, p < 0.01), along with DM, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer substantially affected the prognosis. The unfavorable cluster of 4 diseases in terms of prognosis can be determined: AH, CHD, heart failure, DM [4].\n\nGiven the available literature data on the prevalence of cardiovascular complications and its association with the history of infection, as well as the contribution of COVID-19 to the development of cardiovascular risk (CVR), we can assume that the number of patients with the above-mentioned complications will increase. In this regard, young and middle-aged patients (both with and without cardiovascular risk\n\nInternational Heart and Vascular Disease Journal.

The literature data on COVID-19 as risk factor for CVD in young and middle-aged individuals are currently scarce and contradictory due to different methodological approaches and inclusion criteria, which led to the conduction of this study.\n\nThe aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of new cases of CHD, AH, and diabetes mellitus in patients who underwent COVID-19.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nA total of 658 patients were included in an open comparative prospective study: 111 (16.8 %) men and 547 (83.2 %) women who underwent medical examination by a general practitioner. There were 432 (65.6 %) patients aged 25-44 years and 226 (34.4 %) patients aged 45-59 years. The SCORE score on the relative risk scale (RR) was 2.47 ± 2.5 % for people aged 40 years and older; 1.05 ± 0.4 for people under 40 years old. Low CVR was found in 202 (30.6 %), moderate in 389 (59.1 %), high in 48 (7.2 %), and very high in 19 (3.1 %) patients.\n\nInclusion criteria: men and women aged 25 to 59 years; compliance with all study procedures; signed written consent to participate in the study.\n\nExclusion criteria: mental disorder; alcohol dependence; participation in another study.\n\nPatients were divided into two groups based on whether they had COVID-19 infection (between March 2020 and June 2021): the main group included 416 (63.2 %) patients aged 40 (33; 47) years after COVID-19; the comparison group included 242 (36.8 %) patients aged 41 (32.8; 47) years without COVID-19 history.The groups were comparable by age (p = 0.324) and gender: the main group had 361 (86.8 %) women and 55 (13.2 %) men, the comparison group had 197 (81.4 %) women and 45 (18.6 %) men, p = 0.083. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by the positive oral and nasopharyngeal smear polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 and/or typical pattern according to chest computed tomography.Data on the history\n\nof infection and the severity of the disease were obtained from the patients' medical records.\n\nAt the first visit, all patients were assessed for demographic characteristics, the presence of risk factors (smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolemia), concomitant CVDs (AH, CHD, myocardial infarction history, DM), and laboratory data (total cholesterol, glucose). At the second visit, which took place one year after, in addition to the assessment of the above-mentioned indicators, new cases of AH, CHD, and DM diagnosed according to the existing guidelines were registered [5, 6]. The presence of CHD was performed by the history of myocardial infarction, revascularization or confirmed coronary atherosclerosis by coronary angiography (CAG).\n\nAll patients with new cases were advised to limit salt intake (less than 5 g/day), alcohol, to quit smoking if present, to control body weight, to exercise regularly (at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity dynamic activity for 5-7 days a week) and to receive appropriate medication therapy.\n\nThe period from recovery after COVID-19 to the development of outcomes lasted from 1 to 7 months [median: 3 months, interquartile range 25-75 %: 2-4 months].\n\nPatients with body mass index (BMI) value of 2529.9 kg/m2 were considered overweight and obese — with BMI over 30 kg/m2. CVR was calculated using Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) scale at the age of 40 years and over, and under 40 years — using OR scale [7].\n\nThe study was performed at the Internal Medicine Outpatient Department of the Faculty of Medicine of the Pirogov Russian State Medical University and the Outpatient Department of the City Clinical Hospital № 13. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics committee of the Pirogov Russian State Medical University. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nData were presented as medians with interquartile range for quantitative variables that significantly deviated from normal distribution. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to analyze the differences between the groups; Spearman correlation analysis was used to study the relationship between the studied parameters. To assess the risk factors for cardiovascular events we used\n\nOriginal Articles 30 Larina V.

It should be noted that patients included in the above study who suffered from COVID-19 had a median age of 40 (33; 47) years, predominately females (86,8 %), and every fourth person (24,5 %) smoked. Excessive body weight was present in 40,1 % of patients. Mean score by the SCORE scale was 2.62 ± 2.6 %, relative SCORE was 1.04 ± 0.48. Only 34.8 % of patients from low-risk group, 52.2 %, from moderate risk group, 6 % from high-risk group and 7 % of patients from very high-risk group had a low score by the SCORE scale\n\nThe registration of new cases of AH and CHD after COVID-19 can be mainly explained by the morbidity of elderly people, especially of those with initial cardiovascular pathology. Prediction of the consequences of this infection based on the degree of CVR in order to prevent the development of adverse outcomes at younger age is also relevant, since the delayed development of cardiovascular complications is considered to be one of the features of COVID-19 [10-12]. In this regard, prevention of life-threatening cardiovascular events by reducing the risk of CVD and identifying associated risk factors is the highest priority [13].\n\nBetween 1st and 7th months [median 3 (2; 4)] after COVID-19, one in four (23.3 %) young and middle-aged subjects developed the study endpoints: 8.6 % had AH, 6.3 % had DM, and 5.5 % had CHD. The estimated risk of premature cardiovascular events after COVID-19 was 74 % higher than in the population of similar age and sex represented by the comparison group. In the group of patients who developed new cases of AH, CHD and DM, a moderately severe (p < 0.001) and severe course (p = 0.002) of COVID-19 followed by admission was registered more frequently; in the group of patients who did not develop CV events — a mild course (p < 0.001) of COVID-19.\n\nOur findings are similar to those of other researchers. The study by Stefan N. et al. showed that comorbidities also increased the risk of COVID-19-related death among young adults (n = 3163). These findings come from the March 2020 Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 (LEOSS) aimed to examine the prevalence and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 in-\n\nOriginal Articles 32 Larina V. N. et al.\n\nCOVID-19 as additional cardiovascular risk factor in young and middle-aged patients doi: 10.24412/2311-1623-2022-36-27-34\n\nfection. It revealed an additional influence of obesity, DM and AH on the increased risk of adverse outcomes in young and middle-aged patients. Compared to patients aged 18 to 55 years without obesity, DM and AH (n = 593), the adjusted risk of death (OR 7.42, 95 % CI 1.55-27.3) in similar age group of patients with these pathologies was comparable with mortality risk in patients aged 56-75 years but without obesity, DM and AH (OR 8.21, 95 % CI 4.10-18.3) [14].\n\nThe results of the retrospective study also confirmed that excess weight and AH contribute to the development of adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in young and middle-aged individuals [15].\n\nWhile analyzing the group of patients who developed study outcomes, we noted that the age of these patients was higher compared with those without remote events. Patients in the main group were more likely to have CHD, AH and DM; baseline CVR, BP and BMI were higher than in the comparison group, which is consistent with data from other studies [16].\n\nA systematic review by Harrison S et al. that included data from 84 clinical trials conducted between January 1, 2020, and November 5, 2020 showed that chronic kidney disease (OR 3.07, 95 % CI 2.433.88), DM (OR 2.09, 95 % CI 1.80-2.42) were the RF of fatal outcome and severe COVID-19. AH (OR 2.50, 95 % CI 2.02-3.11), smoking history (OR 1.26, 95 % CI 1.20-1.32), cerebrovascular disease (OR 2.75, 95 % CI 1.54-4.89), and CVD (OR 2.65, 95 % CI 1.86-3.78) contributed to more severe outcomes. Liver disease was associated with higher odds of death (OR 2.81, 95 % CI 1.31-6.01), but not with the severe course of COVID-19. Smoking was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 (OR 1.80, 95 % CI 1.14-2.85), but not with mortality. Obesity was associated with a higher risk of death (OR 2.18, 95 % CI 1.10-4.34), but there was no evidence of the association with more severe COVID-19 course. Patients admitted with COVID-19 were diagnosed acute heart failure (2 %), myocardial infarction (4 %), deep vein thrombosis (7 %), myocardial damage (10 %), angina pectoris (10 %), cardiac arrhythmias (18 %), pulmonary embolism (19 %) and venous thromboembolism (25 %) [17].\n\nIt is pivotal for the practicing physician, especially in the outpatient setting, to identify the group of patients who need earlier additional examination in order to prescribe rational preventive therapy. According to the results of our study, the presence of factors such as sleep disturbance (OR 2.48), smoking\n\n(OR 3.09), three or more of any CVD RF (OR 11.01), high CVR (OR 42.7), the very fact of COVID-19 was associated with higher probability of cardiovascular events and could be considered as possible risk factors in clinical practice.\n\nThe likelihood of developing AH increased by 11.3fold those with high CVR, 3.59-fold in hypercholes-terolemic patients, and 3.16-fold in middle-aged patients. DM (OR 14.33), three or more CHD RF (OR 13.03), smoking (OR 3.67), hypercholesterolemia (OR 8.63), and excess body weight (OR 3.67) were significantly associated with the development of CHD after COVID-19. The development of DM in young and middle-aged patients was associated with smoking (OR 4.75), hypercholesterolemia (OR 6.04), excess body weight (OR 7.02) and the presence of three or more RFs (OR 11.70). All of the above-mentioned parameters are proven components of high CVR, are easily identified in routine practice, and are modifiable [18].\n\nOur results highlighted the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on human health and allow to consider a new coronavirus infection as a possible cardiovascular RF. This fact confirms the necessity of following the principles of prevention of non-infectious diseases as a priority of the health care system, starting at young age [20].\n\nIn the Russian Federation databases of COVID-19 patients were created, one of which named TARGET-VIP, studying clinical and medical history parameters, multimorbidity structure, treatment outcomes at hospital and outpatient setting in patients aged 58.0 ± 14.8 years, of 51.3 % which are males. It was shown that higher mortality was observed during the first months after the disease (31.4 %), especially in persons with severe course, indicating the need to improve the continuity between different health care units, as well as long-term complex, including outpatient follow-up of such patients [21].\n\nThis study allowed to identify risk factors associated with the development of AH, CHD and DM after the infection, which could be used for the development of multifactorial approach for timely detection and correction of cardiometabolic risk in young and middle-aged individuals that shouldinclude the healthy lifestyle principles.\n\nStudy limitations\n\nThe young and middle-aged patients included into the study underwent annual prophylactic examina-\n\nInternational Heart and Vascular Disease Journal.

Due to the course of COVID-19, it is not possible to completely exclude the fact that some of the study participants in the comparison group did not have this infection asymptomatically. Therefore, it is difficult to argue that the new cases of AH, CHD, and DM are the direct consequence of the infection and are not due to the risk factors and concomitant pathology that existed before COVID-19.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne in four people aged from 18 to 59 years may develop a cardiovascular event after COVID-19, with a 74 % higher risk those without the history of COVID-19.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
