        "text": "It has been described as one of the greatest films of all time, a masterpiece made by a director who has been compared to Shakespeare.\n\nYet Napoleon, a seven hour and five minute silent biopic directed by the pioneering French film-maker Abel Gance, has never been seen in its full version since it was released in 1927.\n\nAfter being “mutilated” by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Hollywood studio which bought the rights to the film about the French emperor’s early life, it was left to gather dust in an archive in a former military fort outside Paris."
