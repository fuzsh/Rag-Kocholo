I’m so dang excited that Peggy and Reid finally got their book. I’ve loved Peggy from day 1. She is one bad mamanama! She’s got a very rocky past, heartbreaking past and now, after being in the Las Vegas shifter town for last three years she’s able to open up and be the woman she needs to be. I also love that she got to resolve some of her old demons with Miguel.\n\nWe also get to see Reid, who on his own is a total\n\nBadarse, open up and expose his inner self. He’s the perfect companion to Peggy. He loves her, the Cubs she’s taking care of and he has turned out to be an awesome dude. Even if he’s a fae.\n\nI can’t wIt to see where they’re next adventure games them. You know there’s going to be more. There has to be!\n\nreview of Iron Master\n\nI couldn't wait for time to listen to this story. it moved pretty fast a nd you well I n formed about the motives of the character. I liked all the chapter in the village and would read about others in this extended family. I was very entertained and would like to know more about what happened next to them.\n\nAMAZING\n\nSince the beginning of Reids appearance in this series I been soo in love with him and this book it doesn't disappoint soo many factors to this story is amazing.\n\nhighly recommended.\n\nAnd new characters that are pretty badasses.\n\nAgain! One of my favorites\n\nI really loved Peggy and Stewart’s story. Despite the fact that it was so sweet, there was quite a lot of drama and adventure. I even found myself laughing at comments by the cubs. Really good story.\n\nAS ALWAYS I LOVED IT\n\nI FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER FOR THIS BOOK TO COME OUT, AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT AND CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT INSTALLMENT."
