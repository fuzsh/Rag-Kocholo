        "text": "Join Umberto Lenzi and George Eastman for a journey back to the dawn of time... hey what do you mean you're not excited? You should be, if you like long scenes of muscle bound men making swords. Well if not, maybe this movie is not for you. Although it does also feature people wearing very obviously fake monkey suits and some lepers in a cave. The concept of Ironmaster is the discovery of iron, which leads George Eastman to the invention of swords, which he then uses to conquer everyone in this big field he lives in. I'm assuming that the setting is meant to be Africa given that there's lions, but with the exception of the volcano scenes, most…\n\nThe Iron Age occurred around the collapse of the Bronze Age, in the 12th Century BC. Loin-cloth clad cavemen (typically associated with the Stone Age) went out a full 9000 years previous to that.\n\nAlthough lions typically make meals of Water Buffalo, they have never shared the same land mass as the American Buffalo.\n\nUmberto Lenzi does not care about your facts.\n\nUmberto Lenzi cares about cheap. Which is why this movie has a ten minute section that is just different characters staring off-screen, intercut with stock footage of about three different volcanic eruptions. It's why there are flashbacks to battles that, literally, happened 5 minutes previous. It's also why the main baddie spends most of the movie wearing a…\n\n\"Ironmaster\" is a 1983 adventure film directed by Umberto Lenzi. Set in prehistoric times, the film focuses on the elements of tribal warfare within the dawn of civilization. Early to mid 80's gives a platform to some of the cheesy Lenzi productions, and as this film is certainly one that holds plenty of shlock, it has quite a bit of charm as it progresses. There is a bit of energy conjuring some \"Land of the Lost\" (1974-1976) energy, as the budgeted design calls for plenty of novelty items as part of the films production value. Background set displays is a combination of real and fake, with not a larger blending of the two. You also get occurrences of miniature figurine…\n\nWhile not resorting to having all the characters grunt throughout the runtime, the screenwriters must have had an easy time with this one, writing the most basic sounding dialogue imaginable and then be able to get away with it sounding \"authentic\"!\n\nUmberto Lenzi certainly makes this look good though, with the choice of locations and some nifty model work of the volcano that gifts George Eastman's Vood the discovery of Iron. Which is exactly what he calls it incidentally. Just plucks the word right out of the air. Fair enough. Good word for it.\n\nDespite some intervals with lions, creepy ape people and some lepers, this is mostly scene after scene of Vood raiding neighbouring tribes, while our hero Ela…\n\nEvery single time I saw George Eastman wearing that lion's head cowl, it made me laugh. I mean there's some great sets and costumes (they even gave the ape men genitalia which was a nice detail), but someone spent all of 3 seconds on that cowl. So that was great.\n\nThere's a part when the 2 blondes are sleeping at night and the ape men are sneaking up on them and they pan up into the trees and there's ape men peering out through the branches. I kinda loved that scene, especially with a weird, creepy score (I loved a lot of the music in this movie).\n\nAnd the final battle with clanging iron and dudes swinging away at each…\n\nUmberto Lenzi’s epic caveman adventure was a lot more fun than I expected. Since this goes more in the ‘Quest of Fire’ and less the ‘Conan the Barbarian’ direction I somehow imagined this to be less entertaining, but it’s actually a nice ride. George Eastman is killing it as the villain – not only does he have the perfect physique for the part, he also seems to have a blast wearing his lion-head and killing people with his new invention - the sword. There is quite a bit of blood and minor gore, which definitely makes this feel more like a Lenzi film. The biggest flaw is lead actor Sam Pasco who has the most awkward screen presence, but also…"
