        "text": "In 1821 Ironmaster Charles Hays creates the first company town in Upper Canada, Marmora. The film tells the story of 200 years of Marmora history and the story of an industrial dream set in the wilds of a sparsely populated colony.\n\nFrom the start it should have been written off as an impossible dream in that it wasn’t, lies its romance .. time and time again the original ironmaster and his successors would beat their heads against bureaucracy, their bodies against the wilderness, and their fortunes against reality… by their success and more often their failures is written a story largely forgotten."
