On his own, exiled tribesman Vood (George Eastman; After the Fall of New York, Hands of Steel) discovers how to fashion weapons out of iron and use them against the enemies of his new tribe. But soon their rivals figure out his secret and create their own weapons of steel and now it will become the battle to the death between two barbaric and brutal forces. Who will and at what cost? Umberto Lenzi (Almost Human, Spasmo, Seven Blood Stained Shadows, Nightmare City) directed this Stone Age cult classic co-starring Danilo Mattei (Cannibal Ferox) and William Berger (Keoma, Sabata)."
