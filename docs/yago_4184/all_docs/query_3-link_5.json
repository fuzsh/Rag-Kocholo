Franklin and starring Reginald Denny, Lila Lee and J. Farrell MacDonald.[1] It was distributed by the independent Allied Pictures.[2] It was adapted by Adele Buffington from the 1882 novel The Ironmaster by Georges Ohnet, with the setting changed to modern-day America. An earlier American adaptation was the 1917 silent film American Methods.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nSteve Mason, a worker firing at the Stillman iron foundry rebukes the owner's daughter Janet for reckless driving. Instead of firing him as she demands, Stillman promotes the young man. Eventually he rises to be a trusted employee, and when Stillman dies he leaves Mason in control of the business. He faces deep resentment from the old man's snobbish children, who conspire with a rival businessman to launch a takeover bid. Janet joins in at first, but has a change of heart as her feelings for Mason develop.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nReginald Denny as Steve Mason\n\nLila Lee as Janet Stillman\n\nJ. Farrell MacDonald as J.C.
