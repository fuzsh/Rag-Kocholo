On his own, exiled tribesman Vudu (George Eastman; After the Fall of New York, Hands of Steel, Blastfighter) discovers how to fashion weapons out of iron and use them for his new tribe’s survival and demolishing their enemies. When the new leader of his former tribe Ela (Sam Pasco) figures out how his clan can survive by creating their own iron, it becomes a battle to the death between two brutal forces! Who will win, and at what cost? Directed by Umberto Lenzi (Almost Human, Spasmo, Seven Blood Stained Shadows, Nightmare City), now watch this stone age fantasy classic in HD!\n\nFEATURES:\n\n2016 HD Master\n\nInterviews with Director Umberto Lenzi, Star George Eastman and Art Director Massimo Antonello Geleng\n\nMost orders for in-stock items take less than 24 hours to ship (may take longer if you place an order over the weekend). Pre-orders are shipped as soon as the product arrives. International pre-orders may not come in before the street date. This is especially true with Australian pre-orders.\n\nAll items that come with a slipcover will say so in the product page.\n\nPre-orders will not say WITH SLIPCOVER until the product comes in.\n\nSlipcovers are not guaranteed to be in mint condition.\n\nIf you can order it, it's either in stock or a pre-order. If an item is out of stock you will not be able to add it to your cart. It's rare but our inventory may not be correct. So in some cases an item may have to be shipped separately."
