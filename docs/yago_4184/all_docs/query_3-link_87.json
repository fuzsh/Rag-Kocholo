        "text": "This is the ideal iron for use with aero-modelling covering films.\n\nWith two temperature settings, 5W and 10W, you can both attach and then shrink the covering.\n\nFitted with a 230V 3 pin BS plug.\n\nThe flat iron tip with sharp point allows you to get into those tight nooks and crannies around canopy openings and undercarriage mounting points, but also allows you to \"brush\" gently over large flat surfaces without danger of snagging.\n\nAlso included is a simple stand that keeps the iron off your work surface to prevent accidental burns.\n\nThis is the iron featured in our Youtube videos, so do check them out if you want to see it in action!\n\nUK SHIPPING\n\nMost orders are shipped via Royal Mail’s Tracked 48 service.\n\nWe are in the middle of nowhere and so our Royal Mail collection is at around 1pm.\n\nExample:\n\nAn order placed before 12pm on Monday should be with you on Wednesday.\n\nAn order placed after 12pm on Monday should be with you on Thursday.\n\nFor larger or heavier orders, we use UKMail/DHL to deliver your package on a Next Working Day service.\n\nExample:\n\nAn order placed before 10am on Monday should be with you on Tuesday.\n\nAn order placed after 10am on Monday should be with you on Wednesday.\n\nFor larger or heavier orders, we use UKMail/DHL to deliver your package on a Next Working Day service.\n\nShipping is free to UK Mainland addresses for orders over £30.00, otherwise we charge £6.00 for Royal Mail Tracked 48 parcels and £12.00 for UKMail/DHL Next Working Day.\n\nNORTHERN IRELAND, HIGHLANDS & ISLANDS\n\nRoyal Mail considers Northern Ireland, Scottish Highlands and UK Islands as part of the UK and so does not charge a premium for deliveries.\n\nPretty much all other UK couriers have surcharges for deliveries to the following postcodes: IV, HS, KA27-28, KW, PA20-49, PA60-78, PH17-26, PH30-44, PH49-50, ZE, BT, IM, TR21-25\n\nIf you live in one of these postcodes and the parcel size of your order is outside Royal Mail's dimensions, you will have to pay a surcharge.\n\nOur system is not clever enough to work this out and so if your order attracts a surcharge, we will contact you before despatch to see if you would like to pay the surcharge and proceed with the order or cancel and receive a full refund.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\n\nSmaller items\n\nItems that fit within Royal Mail International Tracked Medium Parcel parameters (59cm x 17cm x 15cm weighing less than 2kg) can be sent to most countries outside the UK.\n\nFor example up to 3 of our smaller 18” wingspan kits can fit into one of these parcels.\n\nA parcel like this currently costs around £14 to Europe and around £18 to send to the USA and will take up to 3 weeks to arrive. This is because Royal Mail hands over the parcel to the local Post Office service for your country who have to clear it through customs and then deliver it to you.\n\nThe Royal Mail tracking code also transfers over to the tracking for your country’s postal service.\n\nLarger items\n\nFor items that do not fit within Royal Mail International Tracked Medium Parcel parameters, we use standard international couriers such as DHL, FedEx and UPS.\n\nThese companies use something called volumetric weights to calculate the cost of shipping.\n\nFor example, a Balsa Basics RC bundle kit that measures 102cm x 34cm x 16cm and weighs 2.5 kg is actually calculated at 14kg!\n\nThis makes these very expensive to send outside the UK - a large kit can cost nearly £40 to send to France."
