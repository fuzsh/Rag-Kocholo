It was written by Arthur Honegger, a close collaborator of Abel Gance, and consists of twenty minutes of music. In the 1990s, Marius Constant composed a film score for a screening in Paris of the Kevin Brownlow cut, here performed by the composer himself conducting the Orchestre Philharmonique de Monte-Carlo, enhanced by the original compositions by Honegger."
