        "text": "The Iron Master is a book in the Ladybird collection. Written by John Grant and illustrated by Robin Davies. The book was released in 1984.\n\nSummary[]\n\nA peasant, attacked in the forest by the wild men, goes to the royal palace for help. He-Man decides to investigate, where Beast Man and his beast men attack him, knocking the sword out of his hands. When Beast Man tries to pick up the sword, it burns his hand, and He-Man soon disposes of them. Skeletor, watching them from afar, instructs the Skelcons to create a huge iron robot. He then gives life to it magically and orders it to bring him the Power Sword (his reasoning being that a metal hand might not be damaged in picking it up). He-Man, summoning the heroes, goes to Grayskull, finding the robot there waiting for them. As it begins to chase after the sword, He-Man throws it to another hero, which in turn throws it to another one, and so on, leading it towards a thunderstorm. Stratos drops the sword, but the robot catches it and holds it up just as a lightning bolt hits it. Afterward, the sword remains, not harmed at all.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nCharacters[]\n\nHeroic Warriors\n\nBattle Cat\n\nCringer\n\nPrince Adam\n\nTeela\n\nHe-Man\n\nRam Man\n\nStratos\n\nEvil Warriors\n\nSkeletor\n\nBeast Man\n\nBeast People\n\nSkelcons\n\nIron Master\n\nAllies\n\nKing Randor\n\nLob\n\nRoyal Doctor\n\nThe Sorceress Mentioned\n\nLocations[]\n\nEternia\n\nRiver of Doom\n\nCastle Grayskull\n\nSnake Mountain\n\nRoyal Palace\n\nVehicles[]\n\nBattle Ram\n\nWeapons[]\n\nPower Sword\n\nPower sceptre\n\nHavoc Staff\n\nCreatures[]\n\nGolden Horse\n\n√Årtifacts[]\n\nGallery[]\n\n[]\n\nHe-Man.org\n\nHe-Man.org - German edition\n\nThe He-Man and She-Ra Blog[]\n\nLadybird Transformation!\n\nBeast Man's allies\n\nBeast Man burn hand!\n\nThe Iron Master!\n\nSkeletor's neck\n\nIron Master into action.\n\nIron Master montage.\n\nTiger transformation!\n\nThe iron sunset.\n\nThe Iron Master attacks!\n\nHappy Birthday He-Man #11 - Iron versus stone!\n\nThrowing the blade.\n\nFly Stratos!
