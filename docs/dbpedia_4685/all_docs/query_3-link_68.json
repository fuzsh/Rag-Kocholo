        "text": "Summary+\n\nWild animals kept in zoos, aquariums, marine parks and theme parks, and other types of captive establishments endure severe mistreatment, both due to the inherently stressful nature of captivity as well as certain conditions within these facilities that exacerbate the mistreatment. The general views that society holds of animals, the ability for humans to profit from captive animals, inadequate monitoring of animal treatment, and inadequate worker training are all causes of this animal mistreatment. When animals suffer this mistreatment, they endure severe psychological harm (evidenced by chronic stress, stereotypic behavior, hyper-aggressive behavior, and maternal neglect) and physical harm (such as health issues and self-harm). They are also at risk of dying prematurely and harming or even killing humans. Environmental enrichment, captive release programs, and animal sanctuaries are practices currently being employed in an attempt to mitigate or solve the issue of animal mistreatment.\n\nKey Takeaways+\n\nThere are certain conditions within captivity, such as small enclosures and being forced to perform in shows, that can severely exacerbate the mistreatment that captive animals face. However, captivity itself is also a form of mistreatment because it goes against animals’ natural adaptations and thus is inherently detrimental to their well-being.\n\nHumans profiting off captive animals, especially when visitors are allowed to interact with the animals or watch them perform in a show, is the main driver of animal mistreatment.\n\nOne of the most common indicators that captive animals have low psychological well-being is stereotypic behavior.\n\nIt is very common for captive animals to die earlier than is normal due to the stressful and unhealthy conditions in captive establishments.\n\nWhile captive release programs may seem to be the most efficient way to free animals from the mistreatment of captivity, there are many limitations to this practice. Experts agree that sending captive animals to large animal sanctuaries is currently the best long-term and universal solution to this issue.\n\nKey Terms+\n\nCetaceans—Marine mammals such as whales and dolphins.1\n\nAPHIS—Animal Plant and Health Inspection Services; a federal body under the US Department of Agriculture that sets regulatory standards for facilities, operations, health, husbandry, sanitation, and transportation of zoo animals.2 They are also in charge of enforcing the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA)3 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).4\n\nWAZA—World Association of Zoos and Aquariums; an international body that creates guidelines for optimal wild animal care in zoos and aquariums. WAZA cannot enforce these guidelines; zoos and aquariums voluntarily join WAZA and choose to follow its guidelines.5\n\nAZA—American Zoo and Aquarium Association; a federal body that sets voluntary standards for animal care in zoos and aquariums and accredits organizations if they meet the credentials.6\n\nAWA—Animal Welfare Act; a federal law that protects captive animal welfare by establishing standards for care. These standards are enforced by the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Services (APHIS).7\n\nMMPA—Marine Mammal Protection Act; a federal law that limits the taking or importing of marine mammals except in the case of government-approved permits. The Animal Plant and Health Inspection Services (APHIS) is in charge of issuing these permits and enforcing the MMPA’s regulations.8\n\nStereotypies or stereotypic behavior—“Repetitive behaviors induced by frustration, repeated attempts to cope, and/or CNS dysfunction.” These behaviors have no apparent goal or function, and are uncommon in non-captive wild animals.9\n\nZoochosis—A condition in which a zoo animal frequently exhibits stereotypic behavior.10\n\nAnimal husbandry—The practice of tending to, feeding, and breeding animals.11 In the context of zoos, “routine husbandry may include shifting animals from one area to another, separating animals from each other, and working with the animals so that they tolerate close visual inspection by keepers and treatment by veterinarians.”12\n\nInbreeding depression—When a population’s ability to survive and reproduce is decreased due to frequent mating between relatives.13\n\nEnvironmental enrichment—“An animal husbandry principle that seeks to enhance the quality of captive animal care by providing the environmental stimuli necessary for optimal psychological and physiological well-being.’’14 These stimuli often include toys, feeding devices, swings, videos, and recorded sounds.15\n\nAllostatic load—“The cumulative adverse effect on the body when allostasis occurs too frequently (as when the body is subjected to repeated stressors) or is inadequate.”16\n\nConspecifics—Animals belonging to the same species.17\n\nLearned helplessness—“A mental state in which an organism forced to bear aversive stimuli, or stimuli that are painful or otherwise unpleasant, becomes unable or unwilling to avoid subsequent encounters with those stimuli, even if they are ‘escapable,’ presumably because it has learned that it cannot control the situation.”18\n\nLogging—Listlessness and immobility, such as when cetaceans will float on the surface of the water without moving for hours at a time.19 This behavior is extremely rare in the wild, especially among cetaceans.20\n\nZoothanasia—The practice of killing a healthy captive animal because the management of the establishment has defined the animal as “surplus” or “unneeded.”21\n\nA: Policies and organizations operate on the international, federal, state, and local levels to protect captive wild animals. There is currently no global body that regulates all wildlife tourism, but the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) provides guidelines for optimal animal care. However, joining WAZAWorld Association of Zoos and Aquariums; an international body that creates guidelines for optimal wild animal care in zoos and aquariums. WAZA cannot enforce these guidelines; zoos and aquariums voluntarily join WAZA and choose to follow its guidelines.5 is optional for all captive organizations, so they are not required to follow these guidelines.86 The same is true for the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZAAmerican Zoo and Aquarium Association; a federal body that sets voluntary standards for animal care in zoos and aquariums and accredits organizations if they meet the credentials.6) and the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (AMMPA), the two prominent animal welfare regulatory organizations in the United States.87 On the federal level, the Animal Welfare Act (AWAAnimal Welfare Act; a federal law that protects captive animal welfare by establishing standards for care. These standards are enforced by the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Services (APHIS).7) protects zoo animals88 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPAMarine Mammal Protection Act; a federal law that limits the taking or importing of marine mammals except in the case of government-approved permits. The Animal Plant and Health Inspection Services (APHIS) is in charge of issuing these permits and enforcing the MMPA’s regulations.8) limits the taking and importing of marine mammals.89 The Animal Plant and Health Inspection Services (APHISAnimal Plant and Health Inspection Services; a federal body under the US Department of Agriculture that sets regulatory standards for facilities, operations, health, husbandry, sanitation, and transportation of zoo animals.2 They are also in charge of enforcing the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA)3 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).4) is the federal body charged with inspecting captive facilities and ensuring their adherence to the AWA and the MMPA.90, 91 The limitations and efficacy of these policies and organizations will be discussed later in this brief.\n\nPartially due to the lack of accurate and regular record-keeping by governments and institutions—and partially due to the negative stigma that surrounds establishments known to mistreat animals and the secretive nature of many forms of animal mistreatment—there is a dearth of large-scale, quantitative research regarding animal mistreatment in captivity. As such, this brief will utilize a variety of qualitative and small-scale studies as well as reports from animal activist organizations in order to provide evidence for the occurrence of animal mistreatment and its causes and consequences, with the acknowledgement that the information in these reports may be biased.\n\nAnother significant contributor to the mistreatment of wild animals in captivity is the inadequate policies and implementation of policies regarding animal treatment. APHISAnimal Plant and Health Inspection Services; a federal body under the US Department of Agriculture that sets regulatory standards for facilities, operations, health, husbandry, sanitation, and transportation of zoo animals.2 They are also in charge of enforcing the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA)3 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).4 has been shown to be ineffective at ensuring that facilities are complying with the regulations outlined in the AWA and the MMPAMarine Mammal Protection Act; a federal law that limits the taking or importing of marine mammals except in the case of government-approved permits. The Animal Plant and Health Inspection Services (APHIS) is in charge of issuing these permits and enforcing the MMPA’s regulations.8, allowing animals to die from the negligence of their captive facilities.131 This inefficiency is likely due to the fact that APHIS is an extremely overwhelmed government body in charge of regulating a multitude of environmental issues.132 As of 2004, APHIS employed only 104 inspectors, but was in charge of inspecting over 2,000 facilities. The organization simply does not have the resources needed to adequately monitor animal treatment.133 When animal mistreatment goes unnoticed by those who have the power to enforce regulations, this allows mistreatment to continue because the establishments responsible are not facing the necessary consequences. Other organizations that set guidelines for animal mistreatment, such as the WAZAWorld Association of Zoos and Aquariums; an international body that creates guidelines for optimal wild animal care in zoos and aquariums. WAZA cannot enforce these guidelines; zoos and aquariums voluntarily join WAZA and choose to follow its guidelines.5 and the AZA, lack the power to enforce these guidelines, and gaining membership into these organizations is voluntary, meaning no captive establishment is forced to abide by these guidelines.134, 135 Moreover, less than 10% of American zoos are accredited by the AZAAmerican Zoo and Aquarium Association; a federal body that sets voluntary standards for animal care in zoos and aquariums and accredits organizations if they meet the credentials.6, meaning over 90% of zoos face very little oversight and do not have stringent guidelines to abide by.136\n\nAnother source of stress for many wild animals is the frequent handling by and proximity to humans. One study of captive wombats showed that wombats who were handled regularly demonstrated increased cortisol secretion, defecation, and stereotypic behavior (all indicators of high stress levels) as compared to wombats who were handled only for regular animal husbandryThe practice of tending to, feeding, and breeding animals.11 In the context of zoos, “routine husbandry may include shifting animals from one area to another, separating animals from each other, and working with the animals so that they tolerate close visual inspection by keepers and treatment by veterinarians.”12 purposes.152 These interactions often lead to learned helplessness“A mental state in which an organism forced to bear aversive stimuli, or stimuli that are painful or otherwise unpleasant, becomes unable or unwilling to avoid subsequent encounters with those stimuli, even if they are ‘escapable,’ presumably because it has learned that it cannot control the situation.”18, wherein the animals seem to “get used to” human interaction because they decrease their resistance to them over time, but in reality the animals have given up resisting because they learn that they have no control over these unpredictable and unpleasant experiences. Learned helplessness is a significant indicator of high levels of stress and low psychological well-being because it can lead to depression, anorexia, immune system dysfunction, and loggingListlessness and immobility, such as when cetaceans will float on the surface of the water without moving for hours at a time.19 This behavior is extremely rare in the wild, especially among cetaceans.20.153\n\nAnother indicator of poor physical health in captive animals is physical abnormalities. For example, the dorsal fins on orcas are made of fibrous tissue that is held upright by the deep water pressure and fast speeds at which wild orcas swim. Because of the inadequate tank sizes and depths, however, this tissue can wear down and cause the dorsal fin to collapse. This occasionally happens in wild orcas due to injuries, exposure to oil spills, or stress and old age; however, it has only been documented in less than 1% of wild orcas,192 whereas 100% of captive male orcas have collapsed dorsal fins.193 Another example of a physical abnormality is a crease that is commonly seen in the neck of captive dolphins; this is caused by dolphins having to unnaturally lift their heads above the water for much of their lives and remain vertical to perform tricks, when they would spend most of their lives horizontal and under the water in the wild.194 Both dolphins and orcas often experience oral degradation, which means that their teeth have been worn down from the stereotypic behavior“Repetitive behaviors induced by frustration, repeated attempts to cope, and/or CNS dysfunction.” These behaviors have no apparent goal or function, and are uncommon in non-captive wild animals.9 of chewing on the concrete; over 60% of captive orcas in the US and Spain have fractured teeth and 24% have teeth worn down to the gingiva.195 This oral degradation puts the cetaceansMarine mammals such as whales and dolphins.1 at risk for infections and often means they have to undergo an extremely painful pulpotomy procedure as well as face routine treatment with antiseptics and antibiotics that can alter their immune system functioning.196, 197"
