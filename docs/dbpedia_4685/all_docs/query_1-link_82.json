        "text": "Coyotes are very adaptable, secretive canines that occur in a diversity of habitats all across the state. They are dog-like in appearance and somewhat resemble a small German Shephard.\n\nDescription: A large mammal with an elongated muzzle with a black nose, long legs, and a long, well-furred tail with a black tip that is carried down as it runs. Ears are erect and triangular-shaped.\n\nThe long, thick, heavy, coarse fur is variable, but usually light gray to dull yellow with the outer hairs tipped with black. The backs of the ears and the outer leg color are typically reddish.\n\nA grey-black band of longer hair (typically five inches long) runs down the mid-back and forms a shoulder saddle or mane. Throat, belly, and under tail color is white.\n\nThe eyes are typically yellow or amber with round black pupils. Their eyesight is six times greater than men. Sense of smell is extremely well developed, more than 23 times better than men.\n\nCoyotes rely upon their sense of smell for hunting and detecting scent left by other coyotes. The coyote may run up to 30 mph for short distances. They are good swimmers; however, coyotes are poor climbers\n\n.Coyote tracks are oval in shape and the toenail marks tend to hook inwards. Dog tracks are more round and have deeper nail marks pointed outward. As typical with all members of the dog family, the coyote’s front foot is larger than the hindfoot. The front foot track of the coyote averages 2 ½ inches in length.\n\nCoyote droppings (scats) are quite variable but are typically large, strongly tapered and contain much hair, bones, feathers or seeds.\n\nLength: 39.5 - 54 inches\n\nTail: 10.8 - 16 inches\n\nEars: 4 - 4.8 inches\n\nWeight: 18 - 30 pounds\n\nSimilar Species: Red and Gray Foxes are smaller, have longer tails, and have vertical slits for pupils.\n\nSome domestic dog breeds may be very similar to coyotes.\n\nHabitat: Coyotes are found in many different habitats. They can live almost anywhere including fields, forests, farmlands, shrubland, and urban areas.\n\nDens are usually located in remote or unused fields, often in a bank, under a hollow log, in a rock cavity, or under a deserted building.\n\nDiet: Small mammals and rabbits compose a majority of their diet, but they eat a variety of other animal foods. Some plant matter, such as fruit, also eaten.\n\nBreeding information: Breeding usually takes place in February and March when the females are receptive.\n\nGestation lasts 58-63 days. Females produce between 2-19 (usually 5-7) pups in a litter.\n\nYoung are born with brownish-gray hair but are blind and helpless."
