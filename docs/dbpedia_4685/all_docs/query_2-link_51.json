        "text": "BACKGROUND\n\nTwo species of epauletted fruit bats (Epomophorus cryp- turus and Epomophorus wahlbergi) co-occur in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. Although the range of E. wahlbergi is quite extensive throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, E. crypturus is near-endemic to South Africa, oc- curring only marginally outside of South Africa in the extreme south of Tanzania (Monadjem et al. 2010). Mor- phologically, the species are very similar to each other and are only told apart after capture by opening the oral cavity and counting the number of palatal ridges that reside be- hind the last upper molar (see ‘Methods’ section below); however, an analysis of museum specimens also revealed that maxillary width of the skull is significantly wider in E. crypturus than in E. wahlbergi (Taylor and Monadjem 2008). Both species show sexual dimorphism with males being larger in body size than females (Bergmans 1988), and during the mating season, males of both species call from tree perches at night to attract females for mating (McCracken and Wilkinson 2000). Both E. crypturus and E. wahlbergi have a mating system in which year-round multi-male/multi-female groups copulate away from the roost (Wickler and Seibt 1976; McCracken and Wilkinson 2000). Although E. wahlbergi has a bimodal breeding sea- son (December and May) in the southern part of its range (Monadjem and Reside 2012), the breeding cycle of E. crypturus has not been thoroughly documented.\n\nThe mating call of male E. wahlbergi is described as a loud, audible, repetitive, monotone call (Wickler and Seibt 1976; Acharya 1992; Fenton et al. 1985) and ap- pears to serve two functions: a) to attract females and b) to space out male conspecifics calling in the same area (Kingdon 1974; Wickler and Seibt 1976; Adams and Snode 2013). Although the mating call of E. wahlbergi has been described, herein, we provide the first quantifi- cation of the male mating call of E.crypturus.\n\nThedetailed distribution of either species of epauletted fruit bat in Kruger National Park (KNP) is poorly known. Monadjem et al. (2010) reports no records for E.crypturus from the southern areas of KNP, but Bonaccorso et al. (2014) captured both species in southern and northern KNP between 2004 and 2007, but showed skewed popula- tion numbers with E. crypturus in higher abundance in the north and E. wahlbergi in higher abundance in the south. Fenton et al. (1985) captured and radio-tagged 10 male and 10 female E.wahlbergi near Pafuri, about 30 km north of Shingwedzi, where our study took place, thus showing that concentrations of this species can and do occur in the northern KNP. It also seems apparent that, al- though these species do occur in sympatry on a regional scale, one or the other appears to dominate at the local scale (Monadjem et al. 2010).\n\nSeasonal movement patterns of either species are not well documented. However, a study on E. wahlbergi in the urbanized environment of Pietermaritzburg campus, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, showed that males and females had larger home ranges in winter compared to spring and that males on average were rela- tively sedentary throughout the year (having relatively small home ranges). Females, on average, made longer flights and had much larger home ranges (Rollinson et al. 2013). Our observations that both species mate within the same timeframe and that males of both spe- cies set up calling perches in proximity to fruiting fig trees in KNP resulted in us proposing the hypothesis that the males of each epauletted fruit bat species should show differences in mating calls to avoid cross-mating with the other species even though, to the human ear, little to no discernible differences are evident.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAnalysis of mating calls of males recorded near Skukuza versus those calls gathered near Shingwedzi (separated by approximately 270 km) showed significant differences in basic call structure and thus supported our hypothesis. We found that the call structure of males around specific fruiting sycamore fig trees were consistent with single- species presence for males at a very localized scale. How- ever, there is also range overlap between the species, and because the male mating calls travel at least 0.5 km from the calling perch near where females are feeding on figs (Wickler and Seibt 1976, personal observations), there is potential for females of each species in the area to ap- proach calling males of the other species if there is not a discernible difference in call structure.\n\nFrom our data, we conclude that the male mating calls we recorded from each area depicted E. wahlbergi from Skukuza and E. crypturus from Shingwedzi. As men- tioned, the mating call of male epauletted bats appears to serve both the function of attracting females to their perch because male call rates increase as females approach, but secondly, male calls appear to act as a de- terrent to other conspecific males attempting to call from perches too close to other calling males (Wickler and Seibt 1976; Adams and Snode 2013). Although one could argue that because we could not definitively iden- tify individuals to species from which calls were re- corded, we could not make this determination. However, several factors help in corroborating our interpretation of results: a) there are unequivocal distinctions in the type of male mating calls recorded in different areas of KNP; b) the calls are consistently different in the two re- gions of KNP, with exceedingly small degrees of vari- ation in each of the call parameters; c) our capture data, as well as data from other researchers (Bonaccorso et al. 2014), indicate that E. wahlbergi dominates the area around Skukuza, whereas E. crypturus dominates the area near Shingwedzi; d) capture data from other studies in KNP (Fenton et al. 1985), and other areas in Africa, show spatial separation between epauletted fruit bat spe- cies on both local (Wickler and Seibt 1976) and, in some cases, regional scales (Kingdon 1974); and e) there are no records of mixed-species feeding groups of epauletted fruit bats at the same fig trees, and radio-telemetry data indicate that female E. wahlbergi from a particular col- ony moved to the same feeding area of ripe fig trees nightly (Fenton et al. 1985).\n\nAn alternative hypothesis to ours would be that males of either E. wahlbergi or E. crypturus alter their call structure in different areas of KNP, and thus, we were recording the same species in both areas using calls that were geographically distinctive within species. Although we could not refute this hypothesis with our study, from a theoretical perspective, this seems unlikely, and we can think of no benefits of such mating behavior. In addition, the extreme lack of variation in call structure in the vari- ables measured for this study suggests the possibility of stabilizing selection via mate choice that would not likely promote such strong regional differences in intraspecific mating calls. In fact, just the opposite would be expected (Ptacek 2000).\n\nIt should be noted that the call structure of male E. wahlbergi we recorded in KNP was substantially dif- ferent from those recorded by Wickler and Seibt (1976)in Kenya. Our recordings contained only a fundamental and single second harmonic, whereas they found a fun- damental with three harmonics (however, this could sim- ply be the distance away from a perch where recording was taken). In addition, the fundamental frequency re- ported by Wickler and Seibt (1976) equated to 1.7 kHz, whereas our recordings show the fundamental at a much higher frequency of about 7 kHz. Although there are no published descriptions of E. crypturus calls available for comparison, it is also curious to note that E. crypturus calls in KNP correspond in frequency to the second har- monic of E. wahlbergi calls. Tonal differences in the calls of each species may be the product of differences in the slope of the calls. Although both species produce relatively flat calls, the total slope of the calls emitted in the Shingwedzi area was twice that of the calls we recorded in the Skukuza area on average. Alterations in call structure attributes presented herein represent a relatively simple measure by which males of co-occurring species of epaulet- ted bats may use harmonic displacement to avoid call overlap with another similar species. The question of if species-specific differences in mating calls are learned or have inherent genetic components remains unanswered. However, our study raises the possibility that differences in mating calls between species of male epauletted fruit bats may serve to avoid hybridization between the two species of epauletted fruit bats."
