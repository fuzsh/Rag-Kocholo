        "text": "The Bald Eagle once ranged throughout every state in the Union except Hawaii. When America adopted the Bald Eagle as its national symbol in 1782, as many as 100,000 nesting Bald Eagles lived in the continental United States, including Alaska. – BH\n\nFor a long time, eagles were shot on a regular basis because they were a perceived threat to livestock and the salmon population. Bounties were given for eagle carcasses.\n\nBy 1940, the decline of Bald Eagles compelled Congress to pass the Bald Eagle Protection Act, which outlawed the killing and disturbing of eagles, as well as the possession of eagle parts, including feathers, eggs, and nests.\n\nAfter the insecticide DDT was used extensively after the mid-1940s, Bald Eagle populations declined catastrophically. DDT caused the eggshells to become so thin that they would easily break. By 1963, only 417 nesting pairs were found in the lower 48 states. DDT was banned from use in the United States in 1972 and in Canada in 1973, making it possible for recovery programs to be successful. – BH, National Geographic.\n\nSilent Spring is an environmental science book written by Rachel Carson and published in 1962. The book documented the detrimental effects on the environment—particularly on birds—of the indiscriminate use of pesticides. Carson accused the chemical industry of spreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims unquestioningly.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially environmental problems that she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to the American public. Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, but it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, led to a nationwide ban on DDT for agricultural uses, and inspired an environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nBy the end of 2021, AEF has released a total of 180 young Bald Eagles from its Douglas Lake, TN hack site, the largest number of any hack releases in the state. AEF has assisted the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency and other partners in the hacking of hundreds of other eaglets. Many eaglets that have been released from AEF’s hack tower (banded and fitted with patagial tags) have been spotted years later by people as far away as the Great Lakes.\n\nRead about ‘Lady Independence,’ the released eagle that came back to Tennessee!"
