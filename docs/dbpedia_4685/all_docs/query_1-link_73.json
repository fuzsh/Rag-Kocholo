        "text": "1. Vermontville (Route 3)\n\nAs you drive Route 3 from Saranac Lake to Plattsburgh, you will notice an influx of moose crossing signs. They're not kidding! Moose are frequently spotted by motorists along this stretch of road. Much of the drive runs parallel to the Saranac River and passes a number of wide open fields and grassy wetlands, all perfect habitats for a moose. To increase your chances of a sighting, and to keep yourself busy while you wait, try fishing on the river in the early morning hours.\n\n2. Meacham Lake (Route 30)\n\nEight miles north of Paul Smith's on Route 30 is Meacham Lake, a popular destination for boaters, campers, and moose as well! While they are often spotted from the road, the experience will seem more authentic if you actually get into the wilderness. Plus, the longer you stay, the higher your chances of seeing one of these incredible creatures. Spend the day canoeing or kayaking on the lake, or make it a multi-day endeavor by staying overnight at the Meacham Lake State Campground.\n\n3. Saranac Lake\n\nImagine a moose walking through your backyard. For many citizens of Saranac Lake, that dream has become a reality! Saranac Lake is located just off the shores of Lake Flower, the last in a larger chain of lakes that includes Kiwassa Lake, Oseetah Lake, and the Lower, Middle, and Upper Saranac Lakes. Surrounding these bodies of water are thousands of acres of wild forests. Connecting them are shallow channels filled with lily pads and lake grasses – a moose's favorite meal. Grab one of the island campsites along the Saranac Lake Chain and don't be surprised if you see a moose wandering through your site on its way to a tasty treat!\n\n4. The Limekiln Lake-Cedar River Road\n\nPart of the aptly named Moose River Plains, this backwoods road is a hot spot for moose sightings. At 23 miles long, extending from the Limekiln Gate near Inlet to the Wakely Dam Gate near Indian Lake, this tract of land is prime moose real estate. Due to the road's remote nature, moose in this region have room to roam without worrying about human encounters. That said, the road provides ample adventure opportunities for people hoping to encounter a moose. Take advantage of the Camping Corridor or paddle one of the easily accessible waterways, such as Helldiver pond, and your chances of seeing a moose will increase exponentially!\n\n5. Lake Lila\n\nMiles from any main road, Lake Lila is one of the more remote Adirondack lakes. Surrounded by the William C. Whitney Wilderness, NE-Ha-Sa-NE, and the expansive Five Ponds Wilderness, Lake Lila is a safe haven for all sorts of wild creatures. Motor use is prohibited on the lake, so both you and the moose can enjoy this beautiful oasis in total silence – only the sounds of fish splashing, bullfrogs croaking, and the wind rustling the trees will break the quiet. Unless, of course, the moose calls, in which case you will have experienced one of the most enchanting moments the Adirondacks has to offer."
