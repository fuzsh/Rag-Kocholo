The most often heard is a loud jeer, Also makes clear whistled notes and gurgling sounds. Blue Jays frequently mimic hawks, especially Red-shouldered Hawks.\n\nOther Sounds\n\nBlue Jays may snap their bills in intense aggressive displays. When caught in a trap or when nestlings are taken from nest, may hammer beak loudly on perch."
