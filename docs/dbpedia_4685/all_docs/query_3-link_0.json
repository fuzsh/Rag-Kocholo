        "text": "Steller sea lions are predatory and consume a wide range of prey, foraging and feeding primarily at night on over a hundred species of fish (including Atka mackerel, walleye pollock, salmon, Pacific cod, Pacific sand lance, arrowtooth flounder, Irish lords, rock sole, capelin, eulachon, Pacific sandfish, Pacific herring, rockfish, smooth lumpsucker, and Pacific hake) and cephalopods (including squid and octopus). Their diet varies in different parts of their range and at different times of the year, depending on the abundance and distribution of prey species. To meet their energy requirements to grow, survive, and reproduce, Steller sea lions likely depend on predictable prey that are readily available and sufficiently abundant so that they may forage efficiently throughout the stages of their lives and during different times of the year.\n\nSteller sea lions forage near and off shore, and in both benthic and pelagic zones. Different individuals may have different foraging strategies. For example, NOAA Fisheries’ research shows that in the non-breeding season, some adult females may spend long periods of time foraging well off the continental shelf while others forage much nearer to terrestrial sites. During the breeding season, a female must forage close enough to her rookery to return often and nurse her young, and her foraging range and trip duration will expand greatly as the pup grows. An adult female has very high energy demands—especially in the winter, when she must find enough food to feed herself and nurse her pup, possibly while pregnant with the next year’s pup.\n\nSteller sea lions, especially males, can travel long distances in a season. Diving ability changes with age. The deepest dive documented is about 1,400 feet in depth.\n\nSteller sea lions need undisturbed land habitat to rest, molt, socialize, mate, give birth, and nurse small pups during the breeding season. They are highly social and may rest in large groups, overlapping their bodies. At sea, they can be seen alone or in small groups, and sometimes gather in large \"rafts\" at the surface near areas of large prey aggregations. While at sea, they can sometimes be seen holding one or more flippers out of the water to thermoregulate. Flippers are a poorly insulated part of the body because the blood vessels are close to the surface of the skin. When floating on the surface of the water, sea lions can extend their flippers into the air to absorb heat, which is then circulated to the rest of the body, including areas near important seasonal prey resources.\n\nSteller sea lions are exposed to a variety of human-caused and natural threats. Some of the most pressing threats are discussed below.\n\nEffects of Fisheries on Prey\n\nCumulative and annual commercial fishery removals may result in temporal and seasonal changes in distribution and abundance of primary prey, prey reduction, and changes in prey size; they may also cause ecosystem effects. All of these may affect Steller sea lions' ability to reliably access sufficient prey to sustain the health, reproduction, and survival of individuals and support sustained increase and eventual recovery of the population.\n\nClimate Change\n\nGlobal climate change is expected to have profound impacts on arctic and sub-arctic marine ecosystems. This may affect the composition, spatial and temporal distribution, and abundance of prey available to Steller sea lions.\n\nSea Level Rise\n\nSea level rise caused by climate change will directly affect terrestrial rookery and haulout sites currently used by Steller sea lions as well as those that may be used by a recovering population. This may result in more deaths among small pups, and traditional sites on some islands with low relief may be submerged.\n\nTemperature Changes\n\nDecadal scale regime shifts, and shorter-term oceanographic anomalies such as El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and marine heatwaves, also can have large effects on distribution and abundance of Steller sea lion prey. Marine heatwaves have already shown to reduce Steller sea lion survival.\n\nOcean Acidification\n\nOcean acidification effects on Steller sea lions are uncertain but are likely to include serious impacts on ecosystems and may have adverse effects on specific species prey through food web effects.\n\nHarmful Algal Blooms\n\nHarmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins cause sickness and death in humans and Steller sea lions. Warming water temperatures increases toxic algae growth, prevents water from mixing, allowingalgae to grow thicker and faster, and algal blooms absorb sunlight, making water even warmer and promoting more blooms.\n\nDisease and Parasites\n\nSteller sea lions are exposed to a variety of diseases and parasites. Adult females and pups are likely the age-classes most vulnerable to disease and parasitism. Infectious disease and parasitism likely have a relatively low impact on the recovery of the Steller sea lion's western distinct population segment. However, climate-change-related shifts in distribution of other species may expose Steller sea lions to novel disease vectors or parasites that could have large-scale impacts. NOAA Fisheries works with a variety of scientists and veterinarians to monitor disease in animals that are found dead and to sample live animals.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nContaminants that might harm Steller sea lions can occur naturally in the environment and enter ocean waters from many sources, such as oil and gas activity (tankering and pipeline transport, production, etc.), vessel accidents and sinkings (leading to loss of cargo, fuel, etc.), local industrial development, atmospheric transport, wastewater discharges, at-sea processing, runoff, toxic waste sites, nuclear testing, industrial accidents, and natural sources. Once in the environment, some contaminants move up the food chain and accumulate in top predators. Certain pollutants that Steller sea lions are exposed to have been shown to damage the immune and reproductive systems of other mammals and to negatively impact their health and survival. Of particular concern now is information showing that mercury contaminant loads of some western DPS Steller sea lion pups are relatively high in some parts of the range where declines are still occurring. Exposure to organochlorines known to affect health impacts in other species have been found in parts of the western and eastern DPSs, though impacts on Steller sea lions are not clear. Emerging environmental contaminants, such as Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are known to bioaccumulate in marine mammals and thus are also a concern, though Steller sea lion exposure to these compounds is not well understood.\n\nHuman-Caused Injuries and Mortality\n\nSteller sea lions may be disturbed by humans in vessels (power, kayak, etc.), manned and unmanned (e.g. drone) aircraft, and on land. When disturbed, Steller sea lions may stampede into the water, which can injure or kill pups and juveniles when they are crushed by adults, and in extreme cases cause pup abandonment. Steller sea lions that are illegally fed can cause them to become habituated, aggressive, lead to more fisheries interactions, entanglements, and illegal shootings as a result of increased frustrations.\n\nInteractions with Active Fishing Gear\n\nHistorically, commercial fishing in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific Ocean incidentally killed many Steller sea lions. Changes in fishing techniques and areas and times fished are thought to have significantly reduced incidental take. Amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1988 and 1994 required observer programs to monitor marine mammal incidental take in some domestic fisheries and NOAA Fisheries provides estimates of mortality and serious injury of Steller sea lions due to US commercial fisheries in marine mammal stock assessments for the western and eastern DPSs. These estimates are likely an underestimate of the actual levels, since large segments of the fishing industry, (including fisheries near Steller sea lion rookeries, haulouts, and feeding areas, and fisheries with known past interaction with sea lions) have either no or very limited observer coverage. Thus, we are highly uncertain about the impact of this threat.\n\nDisturbance\n\nSteller sea lions may be disturbed by vessels (power boats, kayaks, paddleboards, etc.) approaching from the water, by manned and unmanned (e.g., drones) aircraft, and by approach from the land. Disturbance to Steller sea lions on terrestrial haulout sites can lead to individuals fleeing toward the water, causing mass stampedes during which pups and juveniles may be injured or killed when crushed by adults. Disturbance can also cause sea lions to flee from the tops of steep rocks or cliff faces, also causing injury or death. Disturbance can lead to interruption of important behaviors such as nursing, resting, breeding, and socializing. Repeated disturbances that cause lactating females to abandon rookeries or use them less often could impact the health and survival of pups by reducing normal nursing cycles. Steller sea lion feeding can also be disturbed by vessel traffic or underwater noise\n\nEntanglement\n\nEntanglement in marine debris and/or ingestion of fishing gear is known to contribute to Steller sea lion injury and mortality. Steller sea lions can become entangled in marine debris or fishing gear, either swimming off with the gear attached or becoming anchored. Once entangled, sea lions may drag and swim with attached gear for long distances, ultimately suffering fatigue, compromised feeding ability, or severe injury that may lead to reduced reproductive success and death.\n\nAvailable data indicate that the incidence of entanglement is greater in Southeast Alaska than in areas west of 144° west longitude. Entanglement rates to the west however are likely underestimated due to fewer observations in a less-populated area. Not all entangled animals strand (e.g., they may drown) and not all stranded animals are found or reported. This is true especially in the most remote parts of the range of this species.\n\nIllegal Feeding\n\nFeeding of sea lions is illegal and can lead to close interactions between humans and sea lions that pose risks to both. Feeding-related problems include changes in sea lion behavior; habituation; aggression toward humans; negative impacts to fisheries; and entanglement, injury, and death of animals. Learn more in the “Take the lead, do not feed” 45-second video.\n\nIllegal Shooting\n\nIt is illegal to shoot Steller sea lions unless you are an Alaska Native and the take is for subsistence purposes (food or handicraft) and is not accomplished in a wasteful manner. Historical accounts, especially associated with fisheries, documented substantial mortality to the western DPS due to illegal shooting. While there is likely much less illegal shooting than during the period of sharp decline in the 1970s and 1980s, documented illegal shooting of sea lions in the Copper River Delta area, as well as fishermen’s reports of greater interactions with fisheries are cause for concern. Subsistence use stuck and lost Steller sea lion carcasses further complicate efforts to estimate illegal shooting. Most parts of the range of the western DPS are not systematically monitored for carcasses, so there are no current studies evaluating levels of illegal shooting; large parts of the fishing industry, including fisheries near Steller sea lion rookeries, haulouts, and feeding areas, have either no or very limited observer coverage.\n\nVessel Strikes\n\nInadvertent vessel strikes can injure or kill Steller sea lions. There have been four documented cases of Steller sea lions being injured or killed due to nearshore vessel strikes in Alaska since 2007 (PDF: see Table 10). Nearshore vessel strikes are most likely to occur in areas where Steller sea lions are concentrated for feeding or rafting, or near large haulouts or rookeries from which large numbers of animals will be in transit.\n\nPredation\n\nThe primary predators of Steller sea lions are killer whales, sharks, and humans."
