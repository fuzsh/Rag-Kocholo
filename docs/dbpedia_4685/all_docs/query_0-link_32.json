        "text": "Canis rufus\n\nTaxon: Mammal\n\nRange: Eastern North Carolina\n\nStatus: First listed as “threatened with extinction” under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966 in 1967. Currently listed as an \"endangered species\" under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n\nPopulation estimate as of June 2024:\n\nKnown/collared (wild): 17\n\nTotal estimate (wild): 18-20\n\nRed Wolf SAFE (captive): 257\n\nRed Wolf Recovery Program Updates - June 2024\n\n2024 Releases\n\nIn February 2024, a wild female Red Wolf (2359F), fostered into a den in 2021, was captured by private trappers and handed over to Red Wolf Recovery Program biologists.To try and create a new breeding pair, she was placed in an acclimation pen on PLNWR with a male (2443M) born in 2022 at the Endangered Wolf Center as part of the Red Wolf SAFE Program.They did not have a litter in the pen. Based on results from previous releases under similar circumstances (e.g., no litter, a male Red Wolf from the SAFE Program with no wild experience and the fact that they were not in the pen together during the bonding period or the full mating period due to the timing of her capture), 2359F was released in June 2024, but 2443M was not and will remain in the pen for now.Attempts will be made in the future to pair him with a wild female Red Wolf and release him if it is a successful pairing.\n\nIn December 2023, a wild female Red Wolf (2413F) born into the Milltail family group in 2022 was captured by Red Wolf Recovery Program biologists and placed in an acclimation pen on ARNWR with a male (2444M), born in 2022 at the Endangered Wolf Center as part of the Red Wolf SAFE Program, to try and create a new breeding pair. In April 2024, the newly formed pair had a litter of 5 pups in the acclimation pen and they were all released in late May.Based on extensive monitoring using various methods (e.g., visual observations from a far distance, remote cameras, radio telemetry tracking from the ground and air, points from GPS collars via satellites), the family group moved a few miles away from the acclimation pen and settled in, including 2444M appearing to be transitioning well into the wild and as a new father.Tragically, his transition to the wild was cut way too short and he was a vehicle strike mortality on Highway 64 near Buffalo City Road on June 5.Monitoring of 2413F and the pups will continue, and feasible management actions will be taken to assist with survival of the pups, if possible, after the loss of the male.\n\nIn November 2023, a wild female Red Wolf (2409F), who had previously been released as part of a family group on Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge (PLNWR) in May 2023, and a wild male Red Wolf (2411M) born into the Milltail family group in 2022, were captured separately by Red Wolf Recovery Program biologists and placed in an acclimation pen together on ARNWR to try and create a new breeding pair. They did not have a litter and were subsequently released in June 2024. Both are fitted with orange GPS/VHF collars and will be monitored.\n\nWild Population Update\n\nOn April 18, 2024, Red Wolf Recovery Program biologists confirmed the birth of a wild litter of 8 Red Wolf pups in the Milltail area of Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (ARNWR).While this is the third year in a row for a litter in that area, it was far from a given that it would occur this year after the tragic loss of 2323M (the previous breeding male in the Milltail family group) in September 2023.In an attempt to create a new breeding pair, an acclimation pen was constructed in October 2023 within the home range of the resident wild adult female Red Wolf (2225F), who birthed the previous two litters.A male Red Wolf (2191M), born at Wolf Haven International in Tenino, Washington as part of the Red Wolf Saving Animals From Extinction (SAFE) program, was then placed in it.His release from the pen in late January 2024 was timed with mating season and he and 2225F soon appeared to become a pair.Close monitoring throughout the winter and early spring raised hopes that this new pairing would be successful, and it was.When the pups were about 9 days old, biologists went into the den to quickly examine the pups, microchip them for future identification and cheek swabbed for genetics before leaving the den, allowing 2225F to quickly return to continue caring for the pups.The family group continue to be monitored without disturbing them.\n\nOn April 15, 2024, a 2-year-old wild male Red Wolf (2410), born in the Milltail pack in 2022, was a mortality on Highway 64 in the East Lake area from an apparent vehicle strike mortality. Necropsy results are pending. Prior to his mortality, monitoring indicated that he had been crossing the highway in that area and efforts were ongoing to haze him away from the highway and to capture/relocate him.\n\nOn April 8, 2024, a wild female Red Wolf (2280) was captured after exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior for her, such as being visible close to open farm field roads, acting very lethargic, and appearing to have vision issues. After an initial evaluation at a local vet clinic, she was moved to the North Carolina State University (NCSU) Veterinary Hospital where she was diagnosed with an untreatable cancerous mass on her brain. The decision was then made to humanely euthanize her. Her medical care at the NCSU Veterinary Hospital was paid for by the Red Wolf Coalition.\n\nOn February 25, 2024, an adult wild female Red Wolf (2538) was captured on private lands and added to the known population. She is estimated to be 7 years old.\n\nOn January 26, 2024, 2191M and 2414F were released from the acclimation pen. Their movements and activity will be monitored closely over the coming weeks and months.\n\nIn January 2024, four of the Red Wolf pups (2499M, 2500M, 2502F and 2503F) born into the Milltail family group on Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in Spring 2023 were captured, fitted with orange collars with orange reflective material, and re-released. We did not capture the male pup fostered into the family group and have not been able to identify him on remote sensing camera footage for the last couple of months.\n\nRed Wolf ID Letter/Number on Collar 2191M T 2499M 2 2500M V 2502F 9 2503F 6\n\nActivities associated with the 2023-2024 release plan are currently being conducted throughout the ENC RWP, including capture operations and placement of wild red wolves and red wolves from the SAFE population into acclimation pens to attempt to create new breeding pairs in the wild.\n\nOn November 19, 2023, a female pup (2501F) born in the Milltail family group in spring 2023 was captured. She was radio collared with an orange radio collar with orange reflective material and re-released. Unfortunately, on December 22, 2023 she was killed on Highway 264 from what appears to be a vehicle strike.\n\nOn November 19, 2023 and the following day on November 20, 2023, the two remaining pups (2514F and 2515F) born in the Pungo family group in spring 2023 were captured. They were both collared with orange collars with orange reflective material and released within their family group’s home range where they have remained with the breeding pair (2361F and 2307M).\n\nRed Wolf IDLetter/Number on Collar2514FA2515F7\n\nIn October 2023 an acclimation pen was constructed on Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge within the territory of the Milltail family group breeding female (2225F) with the intention of trying to introduce a male Red Wolf. On October 30, 2023, a male from the SAFE population (2191M) was placed in the acclimation pen. The pen was constructed in a way to allow for the wild Red Wolves to be able to interact with and get familiar with the male in the pen with the hope that after release he would pair with 2225F. Soon after his placement in the pen, the Milltail pups began directly interacting with him through the fence and 2225F would come to the area periodically. In December 2023, one of the female yearlings (2414F) from the Milltail family group was captured and placed in the acclimation pen with 2191M. She was placed in the pen not with the intention that the two would pair but to increase the likelihood of him being accepted into the family group after release, both because the Red Wolves in the pen would be more familiar with one another and because it would likely increase the amount of interactions between the family group and the two in the acclimation pen. 2225F visited the pen more after her daughter was inside.\n\nGeneral Updates - 2023\n\nOn 7/5/23 during routine radio telemetry monitoring in the Pungo area of Pocosin Lakes NWR, a 7-year-old wild female Red Wolf (2197F) was in mortality mode and subsequently found on the shoulder of a road. Necropsy results are pending. She was the wild female Red Wolf female that pups were fostered with in 2021.\n\nOn 7/11/23 a Red Wolf pup (2522F) was reported injured on Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). That pup died as a result of her injuries, despite efforts to save her, including extensive efforts at the NCSU Veterinary Hospital. Later that same day a mortality notification was received for her father, the breeding male (2132M) of the family group from the SAFE population released on central Pocosin Lakes NWR in late May. Necropsy results are pending on both mortalities and are part of an ongoing law enforcement investigation. Shortly after these mortalities, the breeding female (2287F) released from the SAFE population as part of this family group dispersed from the refuge for the first time and later became involved with the depredation of chickens on multiple occasions. She was captured on 9/29/23 by the Red Wolf field team and placed back into the SAFE population. Monitoring to date appears to indicate that the remaining pups from this family group were likely abandoned after the mortalities and 2287F’s move off the refuge.\n\nOn 7/20/23 we received a mortality notification for the wild female Red Wolf (2322F) that was translocated from St. Vincent NWR and released in early May 2023 on Alligator River NWR. Necropsy results are pending as part of an ongoing law enforcement investigation.\n\nOn 8/7/23, Service law enforcement issued a press release requesting information and offering a $5,000 reward regarding the mortality of a newly released male (2326M) from the SAFE population that occurred on private land on 5/18/23, which has been confirmed to be from gunshot.\n\nOn 9/26/23, an orange collared Red Wolf was reported dead along Highway 64 on the section running through Alligator River NWR. Once on the scene, the Red Wolf team identified the mortality as the wild male Red Wolf (2323M) who was the breeding male of the of the Milltail family group. Necropsy results indicate that the cause of death was a vehicle strike.\n\nFamily Groups\n\nThe Milltail breeding female (2225F), 5 yearlings (2410M, 2411M, 2412F, 2413F and 2414F) and 6 pups (as of September 2023) remain within their expected area of use on Alligator River NWR.\n\nThe breeding pair (2361F and 2307M) and 2 pups (as of September 2023) remain within their expected area of use on and around Pocosin Lakes NWR.\n\nRecovery Planning\n\nOn September 29, 2023, the Service released the final Revised Recovery Plan for the Red Wolf (Canis rufus). This revised recovery plan was developed by the Red Wolf Recovery Team, a collaborative partnership consisting of Tribal Nation representatives, State and Federal agencies, County government, academia, zoos/conservation centers, non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations, and landowners, assembled in July 2021. The Red Wolf Recovery Plan was last revised in 1990.\n\nThe Recovery Team followed the Service’s Recovery Planning and Implementation Process, a three-document approach consisting of:\n\nA Species Status Assessment (SSA) – Completed in 2018, this document evaluates red wolf viability and provides the foundational biological information to develop and support a recovery plan.\n\nA Recovery Plan – A concise, visionary document that contains the elements required under section 4(f)(1)(B) of the ESA: recovery criteria, recovery actions, and time and cost estimates.\n\nA Recovery Implementation Strategy – An itemization of the prioritized on-the-ground activities needed to implement the actions identified in the recovery plan. Development of the Recovery Implementation Strategy is under way by the Red Wolf Recovery Team and is expected to be completed in 2024.\n\nAt the same time the revised recovery plan was released, the Service also released the Population Viability Analysis of the Red Wolf (PVA), which was used to inform the final recovery plan. Frequently asked questions can also be found on our website.\n\nThe plan underscores the Service’s commitment to working with others to conserve the Red Wolf. Collaborative conservation is foundational to the successful recovery of the species and the Service will continue to strive to align our work with the needs of communities and contributors involved in Red Wolf recovery.\n\nRed Wolf ID\n\nLetter/Number on Collar\n\n2322F\n\nF\n\n2344M\n\nG\n\n2359F\n\n4\n\n2326M\n\nE\n\n2361F\n\nD\n\n2307M\n\nH\n\n2287F\n\nI\n\n2132M\n\nJ\n\n2409F\n\nK\n\nOn December 1, 2023 the Service published the 2023-2024 release plan. The plan discloses efforts being undertaken from October 2023 through June 2024 in support of Red Wolf recovery in eastern North Carolina specific to the pairing and release strategies during that time frame.\n\nResearch\n\nStudies are underway to identify the possibility of Red Wolf ancestry still remaining in the wild in southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas. These studies follow-up on previous studies (Murphy et al. 2018 and Heppenheimer et al. 2018) that suggest Red Wolf ancestry may still exist on the landscape in Louisiana and Texas.\n\nProgram History\n\nThe recovery of the Red Wolf began as a remarkable conservation success story. By 1972, the species was reduced to a small coastal area in southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana (see map above). From 1973-1980, the Service began trapping wild canids in the area to prevent extinction of the species and establish a captive breeding program with the intention of reintroducing the species in the wild. In the early 1970’s, Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium, in association with the Service, established a captive-breeding program using 14 Red Wolves. After numbers continued to decline due to human persecution and habitat loss, the Red Wolf was subsequently declared extinct in the wild in 1980.\n\nIn 1984, the captive breeding program was approved by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) as the Red Wolf Species Survival Plan (SSP) program, which provides oversight for maintaining a healthy and genetically diverse stock under human care. By this time, there were approximately 63 individuals in the SSP population and the program was actively growing the population through the coordinated efforts of the SSP partner facilities, making reintroduction efforts possible.\n\nRecovery efforts in the wild began in northeastern North Carolina with the establishment of what is referred to today as the Eastern North Carolina Red Wolf Population (ENC RWP) under section 10(j) of the ESA and release of Red Wolves from the SSP population, on Alligator River NWR in 1987. Between 1987 and 1994, over 60 adult red wolves from the SSP population were released into the ENC RWP. By the mid-1990s, Red Wolves in the wild maintained territories, formed packs, and successfully bred. By 2011, this reintroduction effort culminated in a known population (e.g. radio-collared) of 89 Red Wolves and in 2012 an estimated population as high as 120 Red Wolves within the five-county ENC RWP area. This was the first time a large carnivore had been declared extinct in the wild and then reintroduced in the United States. It set the stage for several subsequent reintroduction efforts that were modeled after the Red Wolf Recovery Program, such as gray wolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho, Mexican wolves in the southwestern U.S., California condors, and black-footed ferrets. Several innovative recovery tactics were first attempted by this program, with a great deal of success, including pup fostering and coyote sterilizations.\n\nIn 1990, the Service established an island propagation site for the Red Wolf at St. Vincent NWR, an isolated island off the Gulf Coast of Florida. The role of this site is to propagate Red Wolf pups in a somewhat controlled, but natural environment that will provide them with a wild experience as juveniles for the purpose of being strategically translocated into the wild.\n\nRed Wolf SAFE Population\n\nIn 2018, the Red Wolf was named one of the Association of Zoo and Aquariums’ (AZA) SAFE (Saving Animals From Extinction) species. The SAFE program focuses the collective expertise within AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums and leverages their massive audiences to save species. The Red Wolf SAFE program’s goal is to support conservation efforts for this species by maintaining a healthy and viable population of Red Wolves under human care, growing education and awareness efforts, and aiding research vital to supporting recovery and management. Before the SAFE program, the Red Wolf population under human care (i.e., captive population) was overseen by AZA’s Species Survival Plan (SSP) program. Management of this population under the SAFE program is the same as it was under the SSP program.\n\nCaptive breeding saved the Red Wolf from extinction and is an essential component of Red Wolf recovery. Past releases of Red Wolves from the population under human care into the ENC RWP helped the wild Red Wolf population reach a peak of 120 animals in 2012. Although captive Red Wolves are located throughout the country at different Red Wolf SAFE facilities, they are managed as a single population. They are routinely transferred among the facilities to breed according to genetic management objectives to help maintain the health and diversity of an increasing population.\n\nHuman contact with captive Red Wolves is minimized to promote avoidance behavior and to support pair bonding, breeding, pup rearing, and healthy pack . They are evaluated and selected for release to the wild based on their genetic makeup, reproductive performance, behavior, and physical suitability.\n\nIn 2016, the Service made increasing the size of the Red Wolf population under human care (the captive population - see Red Wolf SAFE section) a priority. The Service stated it would provide resources and work with its partners to expand space capacity. To date, the Service has provided $771,000 through FY18, FY19, and FY20 Recovery Challenge Grants for the construction of additional Red Wolf enclosures. And to date, 30 new enclosures have been built or funded.\n\nAs of October 2023, there are approximately 267 Red Wolves in 50 Red Wolf SAFE facilities across the country. In the 2021-2022 breeding season, 28 breeding pairs were established and 46 pups in 13 litters were born - of which 29 survived, adding to the SAFE population. With additional space capacity, and to increase the population, the number of breeding pairs for the 2022-2023 breeding season increased to 40 pairs. This resulted in 18 litters and 78 puppies – of which 56 survived and added to the SAFE population. For the 2023-2024 breeding season, 33 breeding pairs have been suggested.\n\nWild Population\n\nUnder Section 10(j) of the ESA, the Service can designate reintroduced populations established outside of the species’ current range, but within its historical range, as “experimental.” This designation allows the Service to reestablish self-sustaining populations when doing so fosters its conservation and recovery.\n\nCurrently, there is only one wild population of Red Wolves, the ENC RWP in eastern North Carolina, which encompasses five counties of the Albemarle Peninsula in eastern North Carolina (Beaufort, Dare, Hyde, Tyrrell, and Washington counties). Management of the ENC RWP Red Wolves is conducted in accordance with the 10(j) rule published in 1995, as clarified by relevant court orders. Notably, this includes a permanent injunction prohibiting take of Red Wolves either directly or by landowner authorization, without first demonstrating that the Red Wolf is a threat to human safety or the safety of livestock or pets. Additionally, the 1995 rule recognizes the Service’s authority to release additional Red Wolves and conduct adaptive management within the ENC RWP.\n\nPast reintroductions into the ENC RWP helped support a wild Red Wolf population as high as 120 animals (89 radio collared) in 2012. After peaking, the population declined dramatically. Human-caused mortality (e.g., gunshots, vehicle strikes) has been the leading cause of this decline. Hybridization with coyotes, which is exacerbated by human-caused mortality, particularly in breeding pairs, and low Red Wolf population numbers also played a key role in this decline.\n\nDue to declining population size and the mortality of one or both Red Wolves in established breeding pairs, there were no known Red Wolf pups born in the wild in 2019, 2020 or 2021, which is the first time that has occurred in over 30 years. But on April 19, 2022, a wild Red Wolf litter of 6 pups (4F, 2M) was confirmed on Alligator River NWR from Red Wolf pair 2225F and 2323M – the first wild red wolf litter born since 2018!\n\nRed Wolf ID Letter on Collar 2410M S2411M R 2412F M 2413F O 2414F N\n\nToday, the total population is estimated to be between 21 and 23, with 11 known via active radio-collars. The total population is an estimate based on known radio-collared Red Wolves, adult Red Wolves with radio collars that quit functioning relatively recently that are likely still on the landscape, pups of the years that are too small to be collared, and an additional few un-collared adult Red Wolves that could potentially be on the landscape based on reported sightings and remote sensing cameras.\n\nThe Service is committed to seeing Red Wolf numbers increased within the ENC RWP. The Service will continue to collar all captured Red Wolves with bright orange collars to help the public distinguish them from coyotes. Currently, all known, collared adult Red Wolves have orange collars. The Service is also continuing releases of Red Wolves from the SAFE population into the ENC RWP and conducting adaptive management. See below for management activities implemented to attempt to create Red Wolf breeding pairs in eastern North Carolina.\n\nManagement\n\n2020-2021 Management Activities\n\n2021-2022 Management Activities\n\n2022-2023 Management Activities\n\nEastern North Carolina Red Wolf Population (ENC RWP)\n\nOn October 4, 2022 and May 9, 2023 the Service hosted in-person public meetings in Columbia, NC and Swan Quarter, NC, respectively, and on October 5, 2022 and May 10, 2023 the Service hosted virtual public meetings to talk about the status of Red Wolf recovery, the planned releases of captive adult Red Wolves, coyote sterilization, Prey for the Pack, and increased community engagement.\n\nIn late fall/early winter 2022, six Red Wolves (3 individual males and a family group of 3 – breeding pair and a pup) from the Red Wolf SAFE population were transferred to the Service for eventual release within the ENC RWP in Spring 2023. Additionally, a wild female Red Wolf was captured and translocated to eastern North Carolina from St. Vincent NWR in Fall 2022.\n\nOne male from the SAFE population was placed in an acclimation pen on Alligator River NWR with the wild female Red Wolf translocated from St. Vincent NWR. The other two of the males from the SAFE population were place in separate acclimation pens with wild female Red Wolves captured within their territories on Pocosin Lakes NWR. These two wild female Red Wolves were fostered into a den in 2021. The family group from the SAFE population was placed in an acclimation pen on Pocosin Lakes NWR. Acclimation pens were placed in areas where there were no existing Red Wolf pairs and the area provided adequate prey densities and security. All Red Wolves to be released were collared with orange GPS/VHF collars with orange reflective material prior to placement in the acclimation pens.\n\nThe plan was to leave them in the acclimation pens through the breeding and whelping season because the best available information and experience indicates that when trying to form new Red Wolf pairs, they are more likely to stay together and stay in the area of release when they have pups, even if the pups don’t survive.\n\nEach of the adults/juveniles were fitted with orange GPS/VHF collars for tracking purposes and to identify them as a Red Wolf and illegal to shoot, as well as orange reflective material to increase their visibility along roadways. Each collar has a black letter or number on it to help identify them on remote sensing cameras and during sightings.\n\nRed Wolf ID\n\nLetter/Number on Collar\n\n2322F\n\nF\n\n2344M\n\nG\n\n2359F\n\n4\n\n2326M\n\nE\n\n2361F\n\nD\n\n2307M\n\nH\n\n2287F\n\nI\n\n2132M\n\nJ\n\n2409F\n\nK\n\nIn January 2023, wild adult male 2101M was a mortality within his normal home range on private land. He was almost 9 years old and in poor health with mange and a heart condition. Not long before his death, we observed him with a substantial leg injury.\n\nIn January/February 2023 the 5 Milltail pups from the 2022 litter, 3 females (2412F, 2413F and 2414F) and 2 males (2410M and 2411M), were captured and fitted with radio collars. When captured they ranged in weight from about 40 pounds to almost 55 pounds and will continue to grow. They have orange radio collars to identify them as Red wolves to help with their protection and to allow for monitoring, particularly as some or all of them will naturally disperse over the next year or so. Each of their radio collars also has reflective material to increase their visibility along roadways and a letter to help identify them on remote sensing cameras and from sightings.\n\nRed Wolf ID Letter on Collar 2410M S2411M R 2412F M 2413F O 2414F N\n\nIn March 2023, wild adult female 1849F, one of the well-known and key wild Red Wolves on Alligator River NWR for more than a decade, passed away of natural causes. Born in 2010 on the Refuge, 1849F spent her life there and was the matriarch of the Milltail family group for many years, including having 3 litters and 14 pups over her 13 years of life in the wild.\n\nIn April 2023, 2029F, a 10-year old wild female Red Wolf, was discovered dead on private land during routine radio telemetry tracking. A cause of death cannot be determined.\n\nIn April 2023, the breeding female of the Milltail family group (2225F) on Alligator River NWR had a litter for the second year in a row. The litter was 5 pups (3 females, 2 males) born on approximately April 11, 2023. On April 20, 2023, USFWS located and entered the den to do a general health check of the pups, take genetic samples and microchip them for future identification. Through coordination with the Red Wolf SAFE program, it was determined that there was one litter born in a SAFE facility close enough in time to the wild litter to conduct pup fostering. Because the wild female already had 5 pups in the wild litter, it was decided to only foster in one pup so as not to overburden her. On April 23, 2023, a male pup from the SAFE population was flown to the ENC RWP and transferred to USFWS. On the morning of April 24, 2023, the foster pup was placed into the wild den creating a litter of 6 pups (3 females, 3 males).\n\nIn April 2023, one of the newly formed pairs consisting of a wild female within her territory and a male from the SAFE population, and the family group from the SAFE population, each had 4 pups while in the acclimation pens, though one of the pups was a mortality prior to release. The other newly formed pairs in acclimation pens did not have pups and were released in early May. The pairs with pups were released in late May when the pups were around 6 weeks old and mobile enough to ensure they would be able to follow their parents out of the acclimation pen. Releases from the pen consist of placing remote sensing cameras around the pen the day prior to document their release and then on the day of release simply opening the door and leaving. They are then free to come and go from the pen as they choose.\n\nEvery newly released Red Wolf was tracked, monitored and their status assessed on a daily basis following release. Newly released Red Wolves were also supplementally fed with natural prey items when and where feasible to help with their transition to the wild. Additionally, Service staff contacted private landowners where Red Wolves were known to be spending time, based on tracking/monitoring. This was done to make landowners aware of the presence of Red Wolves and to address any potential concerns or issues.\n\nOn May 18, 2023, the Red Wolf field team received, and subsequently verified, a mortality notification for 2326M, a male from the SAFE population who was released from an acclimation pen on Pocosin Lakes NWR earlier that month. On 8/7/23, USFWS law enforcement issued a press release offering a $5,000 reward for information regarding this mortality on private land that was confirmed to be from gunshot.\n\nIn May 2023, the male (2344M) from the SAFE population released from an acclimation pen on Alligator River NWR in May 2023, was captured by the Red Wolf field team due to substantial concerns regarding his ability to survive in the wild as a result of his unwillingness to leave a rural neighborhood and his complacency around people and pets, despite repeated hazing/harassment over several days. He was subsequently transferred back into the SAFE population.\n\nIn June 2023, the 14-year-old wild female Red Wolf (1743F) on Alligator River NWR was found to be in mortality mode during routine tracking. She was subsequently found to have died within a wood block in the Milltail area. Necropsy results confirmed she died of natural causes. She was born in the Milltail area in 2009 and spent the majority of her life on the bombing range which is surrounded by Alligator River NWR, but in recent years split her time between the bombing range and the Milltail area. She is the oldest known ever wild Red Wolf on record.\n\nIn July 2023, during routine radio telemetry monitoring in the Pungo area of Pocosin Lakes NWR, a 7-year-old wild female Red Wolf (2197F) was in mortality mode and subsequently found on the shoulder of a road. Necropsy results are pending. She was the wild female Red Wolf that pups were fostered with in 2021.\n\nIn July 2023, a Red Wolf pup (2522F) was reported injured on Pocosin Lakes NWR. That pup later died as a result of her injuries, despite efforts to save her, including extensive efforts at the NCSU Veterinary Hospital. Later that same day a mortality notification was received for her father, the breeding male (2132M) of the family group from the SAFE population released on central Pocosin Lakes NWR in late May. Necropsy results are pending on both mortalities and are part of an ongoing law enforcement investigation. Shortly after these mortalities, the captive- born breeding female (2287F) of this family group dispersed from the refuge for the first time and later became involved with the depredation of chickens on multiple occasions. She was captured on 9/29/23 by the Red Wolf field team and placed back into the SAFE population. Monitoring to date appears to indicate that the remaining pups from this family group were likely abandoned after the mortalities and 2287F’s move off the refuge.\n\nIn July 2023, the Red Wolf field team received a mortality notification for the wild female Red Wolf (2322F) that was translocated from St. Vincent NWR and released in early May 2023 on Alligator River NWR. Necropsy results are pending as part of an ongoing law enforcement investigation.\n\nIn September 2023, an orange collared Red Wolf was reported dead along Highway 64 on the section running through Alligator River NWR. Once on the scene, the Red Wolf team identified the mortality as the wild male Red Wolf (2323M) who was the male of the of the Milltail family group. Necropsy results indicate that the cause of death was a vehicle strike.\n\nAs of September 2023, the Pungo family group on Pocosin Lakes NWR consisted of the breeding pair (2361F and 2307M) and two pups.\n\nAs of September 2023, the Milltail family group on Alligator River NWR consisted of the breeding female (2225F), 5 yearlings (2410M, 2411M, 2412F, 2413F and 2414F) and 6 pups.\n\nService staff have continued to develop additional Prey for the Pack agreements throughout the ENC RWP and have completed some in key locations adjacent to Alligator River NWR. Prey for the Pack agreements are tailored to each landowner and include technical and financial assistance to them to implement habitat improvement projects that benefit the landowner and wildlife. Each agreement includes a commitment by the landowner to allow Red wolves to use their property without harassment. Depending on the comfort of the landowner, additional activities, such as trapping and coyote sterilization, may also be included. The Service and its partners are also continuing to look for ways to expand this program or develop sister programs suited to the needs of local landowners.\n\nSt. Vincent National Wildlife Refuge, Florida (SVNWR)\n\nThere is currently a pair of Red Wolves on St. Vincent NWR, but a successful litter was not documented in 2023 based on monitoring.\n\nSummary of Releases\n\nYear# of\n\nAdults\n\nReleased# of\n\nSubadults\n\nReleased# of Pups\n\nReleased\n\nw/Adults1# of\n\nPups\n\nFostered# of\n\nKnown\n\nPups\n\nBorn in\n\nthe Wild# of Known\n\nMortalitiesPopulation\n\nEstimate2\n\n(end of year)# of\n\nMortalities\n\nas a\n\nFunction of\n\nPopulation19878-C00001714%198802-C00241625%19891-C6-C2-C, 2-I0031520%19902-C06-C0063119%19911-C1-C5-C01393426%19922-I04-C021432%19932-C, 2-I2-C9-C01686612%19943-C, 3-I00034235145%19951-C1-S0022124129%19962-I3-I001975014%19971-I1-I001994420%199801-I0013156623%19991-I2-I0044168918%20001-S,1-I1-S,2-I0026169617%20011-S00035228626%200201-I07-C32228127%200301-I0035158717%20040002-I50219422%200501-I00381910318%200604-I04-C521811016%20070003-C31219422%200803-I0047219722%200905-I04-C40289430%20100002-C43179518%20110002-C402190-11019-23%20120002-C3920100-12017-20%20130001-C341590-11014-17%20140002-C191790-11015-19%20150000101950-7525-38%20160000111125-4823-44%201700004725-3520-28%201800004523-3017-22%201900000619-2227-32%202001-I000217-2010-12%20212-C,1-I2-C,1-I04-C0717-2035-41%20227-C3-C006619-2129-32%20235-C, 1-I1-C01-C131120-2350-55%\n\nC = Captivity\n\nI = Island Propagation Site\n\nS = Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\nAdults are categorized as Red Wolves 3 years of age or older.

The goal was to inform residents living in and around the ﬁve-county ENC RWP area in eastern North Carolina (Beaufort, Dare, Hyde, Tyrrell and Washington counties) about ongoing work and plans for canid management. Plans for additional sessions were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPrey for the Pack – Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program\n\nPrey for the Pack is a habitat improvement program through the Services’ Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, in collaboration with the North Carolina Wildlife Federation, and is available to private landowners interested in and committed to improving wildlife habitats on their property. The program helps provide both technical and ﬁnancial support to private landowners to help promote and implement habitat improvement projects that beneﬁt both the landowner and the wildlife that depend on the resource, speciﬁcally to promote habitat for Red Wolf prey species. To date, the Service has provided $350,000 worth of financial assistance, to date; $60,000 in FY19 and $290,000 in FY22.\n\nIn exchange for ﬁnancial and technical support, landowners will allow for the presence of Red Wolves on their private lands, un-harassed.
