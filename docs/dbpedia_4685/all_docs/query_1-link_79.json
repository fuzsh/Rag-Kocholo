        "text": "Frogs are amphibians, a group of animals that usually live part of their life in water and part of their life on land. A familiar part of the wildlife of Massachusetts, frogs are found across the state. Because of their diverse habitat needs and sensitive skin, these amphibians are good indicators of the health of our environment.\n\nHow to Identify Frogs\n\nAll toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads. There are two ways to identify a frog or toad: by how they look and how they sound.\n\nFrogs tend to have bulging eyes and long back legs that help them hop, climb, or swim. They range in color from bright green to brown and often have unique markings that help with identification. One group, the true toad family Bufonidae, has members that can be distinguished by large poison glands behind their eyes, shorter legs, and dry, typically warty skin.\n\nFrogs can be surprisingly vocal. They make calls for a variety of reasons, including attracting mates, telling competitors to back off, and expressing alarm. The calls are valuable identification clues and often mimic other animals like the quacking Wood Frog or the peeping Spring Peeper.\n\nTypes of Frogs in Massachusetts\n\nThe frogs of Massachusetts come in many colors, and they inhabit a variety of habitats, from lakes to trees to woodlands.\n\nFrog Lifecycle & Breeding\n\nFrogs generally breed in wetlands. Their mating behavior, called amplexus, involves the male grasping the female and fertilizing her eggs as she releases them. The jelly-like eggs are deposited singly or in masses on underwater plant material or in free-floating films.\n\nWhen the young hatch, they are tadpoles, breathing through gills and swimming with the help of a flattened tail. Over time they develop legs, lose their tail, and breathe air.\n\nWhat do Frogs Eat?\n\nMost tadpoles eat aquatic plants and algae, but some consume animal prey such as small fish. Adult frogs are important predators of insects.\n\nLarge frogs, such as bullfrogs, may eat other small animals such as mice, small birds, snakes, crayfish, dragonflies, and all smaller frogs.\n\nFrogs drink and breathe through their skin. Although they have lungs in their adult stage, they depend on the oxygen absorbed through their skin, especially when they are swimming underwater.\n\nThreats Facing Frogs\n\nLike all amphibians, frogs are sensitive to pesticides, changes in land use, and climate change. They depend on clean, unpolluted water to complete their larval stages and development, especially on or near vernal pools, can fragment their forested habitat and degrade the wetlands in which they breed.\n\nFrog Predators\n\nMany creatures eat frogs, including herons, Northern Water Snakes, minks, raccoons, and more. Frogs use several strategies to avoid predators. They may leap away, produce alarm calls, produce distasteful or even poisonous chemicals, hide underground, and/or or use camouflage colors.\n\nHow Mass Audubon Helps Frogs\n\nMass Audubonâ€™s work to protect and restore resilient landscapes, mobilize to fight climate change, and provide equitable access to nature has direct impact on frogs.\n\nMass Audubon regularly monitors the presence of amphibians, including frogs, to enhance our knowledge about the diversity and abundance of amphibians on our wildlife sanctuaries, particularly those of conservation concern. Based on what we learn, we determine if there are any management measures, we could be taking to enhance our wildlife sanctuaries as habitats for amphibians.\n\nFor example, in an effort to increase the populations of the once widespread Eastern Spadefoot Toad, Mass Audubon partnered with Zoo New England, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife to restore over 20 new breeding pools in fields as well as woodland and formerly cultivated land. Learn more about our work with spadefoot toads\n\nWhat You Can Do to Help Frogs\n\nOur wildlife sanctuaries help frogs and toads by creating safe ecosystems where they can thrive. Many of our sanctuaries have protected vernal pools and mixed habitats of forest and water. As a Mass Audubon member, you help maintain and grow our sanctuaries. Already a member?
