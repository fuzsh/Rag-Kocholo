        "text": "A Court of Wings and Ruin is the third installment in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series by Sarah J. Maas. It is preceded by A Court of Mist and Fury and followed by A Court of Frost and Starlight.\n\nThe book was released on May 2nd, 2017, alongside the A Court of Thorns and Roses Coloring Book. This book is the final book in Feyre's point of view. Sarah J. Maas has more books planned for the series, however, these books will not feature Feyre as the main protagonist.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nFeyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin's actions and learn what she can about the invading king threatening to bring her land to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit. One slip could bring doom not only for Feyre, but for everything-and everyone-she holds dear.\n\nAs war bears down upon them all, Feyre endeavors to take her place amongst the High Fae of the land, balancing her struggle to master her powers-both magical and political-and her love for her court and family. Amidst these struggles, Feyre and Rhysand must decide whom to trust amongst the cunning and lethal High Lords, and hunt for allies in unexpected places.[1]\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe book starts with a prologue as a flashback, from Rhysand's point of view, that takes place on a battlefield during the War that took place 2 years before the construction of the Wall. Rhysand is walking among the aftermath of that day's fight, looking around at the dead. When he spots a half-shredded Illyrian wing, he fears it might be Cassian or Azriel, and start picking through the corpses. He sees that the soldier's hair and complexion bear a resemblance to Cassian but the face shows that it isn't him. After a moment of relief, Rhysand spots another set of Illyrian wings poking up from the piled bodies. He does the same, seeing if that other soldier is one of his brothers and discovering it's not. Again and again, Rhysand looks and digs his way through corpses of dead Illyrians.\n\nThe book then picks up the present storyline, returning to Feyre's point of view. She is back in the Spring Court, in her old drawing-room in Tamlin's manor. She is trying to paint but ends up critiquing the paintings she did in the past weeks, comparing how she once was to who she is now that she's changed. She also starts thinking about not enjoying being in the company of those in the Spring Court, and recalling what happened to her sisters, Elain and Nesta, and Cassian the night they met the King of Hybern. She gets more upset at each thought of them to the point that she unconsciously breaks one of her paintbrushes in half. Luckily she destroys the evidence of her anger, right before Tamlin and Lucien comes to check in on her.\n\nThe three have a meeting with Ianthe, to talk to her about her leading the King of Hybern to abduct Elaine and Nesta. With Feyre and Lucien already aware and cautious of Ianthe's true nature, they listen to her and see the lies. While Feyre just thinks of all the discrepancies, Lucien voices out loud his questions against Ianthe. However, Tamlin tries to rush through the confrontation and move on to discuss his Spring Court being in alliance with Hybern. As part of the bargain, Tamlin made with the King of Hybern, Tamlin is letting Hybern forces come into his land. Feyre expresses her concerns about allowing Hybern in and how it will affect the people of the Spring Court. Tamlin believes that his people will be protected, by relocating most of them to the eastern border. Feyre next learns that Hybern is sending a small group, that includes Jurian, in advance to the Spring Court.\n\nAfter the discussion, the next morning Feyre sends information down her mating bond to Rhysand and asks about the well-being of the Inner Circle. They have a quick interaction; to avoid risking Tamlin or anyone else finding out. Rhysand's short assurance that everyone is fine helps hold Feyre over while feeling alone being in enemy territory.\n\nThe following day, Jurian and two Hybern commanders, Princess Brannagh and Prince Dagdan who are the niece and nephew of the King of Hybern, arrive at Tamlin's manor. They discuss creating an exploration party to go to the Wall and examine where the holes between Prythian and the Mortal Lands are.\n\nFeyre does end up succeeding in destroying Tamlin's court from within, later, using the fact that Tamlin sold out Prythian and his people. She causes mass chaos with a rift created between the High Lord and his subjects. The majority of the Faeries in the Spring Court have a loss of respect for Tamlin and the sentries start distrusting him and leaving their posts.\n\nLucien leaves the Spring Court along with Feyre once he realizes how terrible Tamlin is and wants to find Elain. They both leave through a secret tunnel that takes them into the Autumn Court and spend some time trying to travel through incognito. One day, Feyre and Lucien run into Eris and Lucien's other brothers and have to fight to escape. Due to Feyre and Lucien still having faebane in their system, they don't have full access to their powers. Feyre is able to call up some fire, which is a special power of the High Lord Beron and the rest of the royalty line of the Autumn Court, and fend against Eris and the others.\n\nAfter Feyre and Lucien make their escape into the Winter Court, Eris and his brothers do catch up to them and a battle on a frozen lake ensues. Feyre ends up fighting Eris and Lucien fighting his other brothers. In the middle of the battle, Cassian and Azriel arrive, flying in to crash-land onto the ice. It's then that Lucien, Eris, and the other brothers discover that Feyre is the High Lady of the Night Court. Eris and his brothers decide to back off and the battle concludes, due to Feyre's high status and that they sustained great injuries too. From there, the four, Cassian carrying Feyre and Azriel carrying Lucien, fly out of the Winter Court to head to the Night Court.\n\nOnce Feyre returns to Velaris, she and Rhysand seek to have a meeting between all of the High Lords of Prythian so that they can unite and fight Hybern as one. Feyre must also help her sisters come to terms with being High Fae. Nesta is bitter and angry, while Elain appears to be depressed and empty, and in a state even worse than Feyre's at the beginning of A Court of Mist and Fury.\n\nLuckily, Cassian and Azriel are fine, and despite the low probability of it happening, Cassian's wings heal completely. Feyre and the rest of the Inner Circle have a meeting about Hybern, deciding they should get Feyre's sisters to help them and try to fix the holes in the wall while stopping Hybern from getting help from allies from the Continent. Nesta comes to a meeting and agrees to help fix the wall and visit the Court of Nightmares to practice her powers, while the others ask for aid.\n\nFeyre trains with Cassian and Azriel begins to teach her to fly. Rhys and Feyre visit the library to find information about the Wall and decide to recruit the Bone Carver. Feyre and Cassian speak to the Bone Carver and he agrees that if they bring him the Ouroboros mirror then he will fight with them.\n\nKeir meets with the Inner Circle and is reluctant to offer assistance, Rhysand knew this and invites Eris, heir to the Autumn Court to the meeting. Keir says he will help if he can have access to Velaris and Eris will urge his father to attend their High Lords meeting if they support his claim to the throne. Morrigan is furious that Rhysand made a deal with Eris and Amren explains how the Bone Carver will need to be bound to a body, like she was, to be set free. Lucien sits with Elain, trying to heal her mind with their mating bond. Azriel trains Feyre to use her wings, telling her the story of how Nephelle saved Miryam even though her wings were small and deformed.\n\nNesta and Feyre are ambushed by Hybern Ravens in the library, they retreat to the pit where something evil lives. Feyre makes a bargain with the monster to bring it company if it kills the Hybern Ravens, it agrees.\n\nFeyre realizes that Elain has been made a seer after she tells everyone that there is another mortal queen. The queen was sold to an evil lord and is cursed to turn into a firebird every night, Lucien offers to go and find her.\n\nRhys hears word that the Summer Court is under attack, when they arrive no other aid has come and the court is being slaughtered. Mor and Feyre fight their way through the palace, killing any Hybern soldiers they find. Meanwhile, Rhys tracked down the King of Hybern but when he goes to strike, the king is nothing but an illusion.\n\nFeyre meets with Tarquin who is still furious with her for stealing the Book of Breathings and rejects her offer of further help. The Inner Circle arrive at the Dawn Court for the meeting with the High Lords. All the High Lords arrive, with Beron and Tamlin both making an entrance. Tamlin insists that he has come to help but throws insults at Feyre. The High Lords agree they must take a faebane antidote to protect their powers and evacuate the Spring Court immediately.\n\nFeyre finds out that Helion had an affair with Lucien's mother, and from there figures out that it makes him Lucien's father, possibly. Nesta warns Feyre that they must return home immediately because she senses danger. A huge wave of power ripples over the lands, Nesta becomes sick as it happens and Rhys informs everyone that the Cauldron has brought the Wall down.\n\nAmren and Feyre meet with Bryaxis in the library, offering it a second bargain in return for his help fighting against Hybern.
