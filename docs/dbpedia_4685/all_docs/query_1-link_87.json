        "text": "Population Size\n\nScoreF - 10,000-100,000 individuals\n\nCommentIn 2009 and 2010, the Montana colonial-nesting waterbird survey documented 5,938 and 4,866 breeding pairs in Montana, respectively (Wightman and Tilly 2010). So total adult population is greater than 10,000 and/or between 10,000 and 100,000 (F).\n\nRange Extent\n\nScoreU - Unknown\n\nArea of Occupancy\n\nScoreE - 100-500 km squared (about 25,000-125,000 acres)\n\nComment222 square kilometers based on Species Occurrence polygons with known breeding activity in the Heritage database\n\nLong-term Trend\n\nScoreE - Relatively Stable (±25% change)\n\nCommentLake and isolated island habitats are stable or increasing since European arrival.\n\nShort-term Trend\n\nScoreE - Stable. Population, range, area occupied, and/or number or condition of occurrences unchanged or remaining within ±10% fluctuation\n\nCommentNest trend data in the Heritage database (partially summarized by Hendricks and Johnson (2002)) and compared with recent waterbird surveys (Wightman and Tilly 2010) indicates stable trends in 4 Montana colonies with regular breeding and nest monitoring data within mostly a +/-10% range.\n\nThreats\n\nScoreF - Widespread, low-severity threat. Threat is of low severity but affects (or would affect) most or a significant portion of the population or area.\n\nCommentAltered hydrology as a result of climate change, nest site disturbance, and disease (Avian Cholera, Botulism, and West Nile Virus) probably represent the greatest threats to the species.\n\nIntrinsic Vulnerability\n\nScoreB - Moderately Vulnerable. Species exhibits moderate age of maturity, frequency of reproduction, and/or fecundity such that populations generally tend to recover from decreases in abundance over a period of several years (on the order of 5-20 years or 2-5 generations); or species has moderate dispersal capability such that extirpated populations generally become reestablished through natural recolonization (unaided by humans).\n\nCommentModerately Vulnerable. Species exhibits moderate age of maturity, frequency of reproduction, and/or fecundity such that populations generally tend to recover from decreases in abundance within 5-20 years or 2-5 generations. Species has good dispersal capabilities such that extirpated populations generally become reestablished through natural recolonization.\n\nEnvironmental Specificity\n\nScoreA - Very Narrow. Specialist. Specific habitat(s), substrate(s), food type(s), hosts, breeding/nonbreeding microhabitats, or other abiotic and/or biotic factor(s) are used or required by the Element in the area of interest, with these habitat(s) and/or other requirements furthermore being scarce within the generalized range of the species within the area of interest, and, the population (or the number of breeding attempts) expected to decline significantly if any of these key requirements become unavailable.\n\nCommentSpecies is dependent on very specialized nesting habitat (isolated islands which are limited in Montana).\n\nRaw Conservation Status Score"
