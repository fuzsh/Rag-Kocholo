        "text": "Owls are among the best-known birds in folklore and literature, yet they remain something of a mystery to most people. That's not surprising, though, since they are mainly nocturnal (active at night) and hide during the day.\n\nTheir striking physical appearance and unique behaviors make it easy to understand why owls have inspired centuries of myth and legend across cultures. Owls also possess some amazing adaptations—like the 14 different neck bones that allow them to turn their heads nearly three-quarters of the way around.\n\nIn fact, it's hard not to be amazed by owls\n\nOwl Behavior\n\nMost owls tend to focus their activities under a cloak of darkness, and do not begin hunting until shortly after dark. Long-eared Owls and Short-eared Owls often begin hunting just before sundown, and they can be seen coursing low over meadows in search of prey.\n\nDuring the day, most owls are likely to sleep or doze in the security of a thick evergreen or inside a tree cavity.\n\nMost species are especially vocal just after sunset and then again just before sunrise. However, during courtship and the early breeding season, they often can be heard throughout the night. Some species, such as the Eastern Screech Owl and Barred Owl, will vocalize during the day too.\n\nOwl Pellets\n\nOwls eat their prey (typically rodents) whole and then regurgitate the indigestible fur and bones as pellets. Sometimes you can find dozens of these pellets under a single tree if a bird has a favorite roosting spot.\n\nThe size of the pellets is often suggestive of the species:\n\nFinger-sized usually means a smaller owl such as a Saw-whet or Eastern Screech\n\nThumb-size is likely to be a Barred or Long-eared Owl\n\nBarn and Great Horned Owls can produce pellets larger than golf balls\n\nWhere Can I See Owls?\n\nCrows, Blue Jays, and other songbirds can sometimes lead you to a roosting owl. These birds engage in an instinctual behavior known as \"mobbing\" where they draw attention to a predator by harassing it while making loud alarm calls. If you approach the scene quietly, good views of the \"mobbed\" owl may be obtained.\n\nMany owls will use the same roost tree for several days, and evidence of this can be found in \"whitewash\" on branches and on the ground, and owl pellets.\n\nHow Mass Audubon is Supporting Birds in Massachusetts\n\nMass Audubon works at our wildlife sanctuaries and beyond to ensure that the nature of Massachusetts continues to thrive. By scientifically monitoring Massachusetts birdlife, Mass Audubon informs important conservation decisions and launches targeted initiatives to help at-risk species. In addition, fostering healthy habitats, supporting native species, and educating people about the importance of nature conservation is critical to our success.
