Caldaza is a Ph.D. student in the Geography Department of Rutgers University. He will undertake research in the Mayan Forest in Mexico where two ongoing projects — a reforestation program called “Sembrando Vida” (Sowing Life) and the construction of tourist train that will connect archeological sites throughout the forest — are concurrently being carried out. Calzada will use satellite imagery and engagement with farmers to study the long-term environmental and social impact of these plans\n\nJenny Dorsey, a professional chef and social justice advocate in the food industry. Dorsey graduated from Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education with a master’s in public policy. Her Fulbright-National Geographic project will study the impact of the Singaporean government’s policies towards open-air centers and wet markets and how they have influenced business outcomes for vendors and food security for residents. Dorsey will use photo essays, interviews, and videos to create a multimedia project that will expand awareness of the changing dynamics of Singaporean food, people, tradition, and governmental policy. Her work will be included in the National University of Singapore’s permanent digital archives.\n\nRachel Herring, a member of the Choctaw Nation, researcher for the U.S. Department of Energy, and interdisciplinary creator.

Her research aims to contribute to clean energy policies that protect and integrate both traditional culture and Indigenous knowledge. Her investigation and storytelling aim to narrate what a just energy transition looks like for Japan’s aging population and the genkai shūraku – one that builds social resilience, lowers emissions, and preserves traditional culture.\n\nDaun Lee, a sustainability consultant based in Boston, Massachusetts who received her B.A. in Anthropology from Washington University in St. Louis. Lee works toward equitable, holistic climate mitigation strategies. Lee will research the social impact of converting agricultural lands to solar farms on Jeju Island, South Korea, uncovering the cultural and heritage value disruptions which citrus farmers are facing due to the nation's greenhouse gas reduction goals. This research will provide insight into how to navigate future projects to ensure the longevity of important cultural values while progressing toward greenhouse gas reduction. Daun will share her findings through a journal article and short-form documentary film.\n\nJacob Ligorria, an ecologist studying seabirds, was selected by the Polish-U.S. Fulbright Commission to carry out research as part of an international team of scientists at the Polish Research Station in Hornsund fjord in Norway. Ligorria received a B.A. in Biology from Pomona College. He will investigate what adult seabirds called dovekies, or “little auks,” in the Arctic are feeding their chicks. By tracing where dovekies forage, his research will help clarify how climate change is influencing the entire Arctic food web.

As a Fulbright-National Geographic Storytelling Fellow she will travel around Ireland to understand how climate change-driven policies to preserve peat bogs are impacting people and the soil. Though covering only 3% of the world's landmass, peat soil holds as much carbon as all vegetation combined. Preserving peat bogs and keeping that carbon in place is seen as a low hanging fruit of climate change policy. However, in Ireland, bogs have a rich history of use and are tied to Ireland's energy economy. Emily's stories will be available through the Fulbright-National Geographic blog and other media outlets. Emily earned a geography M.S. and journalism M.A. at University of Wisconsin - Madison.\n\nWilliam Tyner: Romania\n\nWilliam Tyner is an anthropologist and filmmaker studying the role of civic technology in strengthening the relationship between civil society and government and redefining civic engagement.

As a Fulbright-National Geographic Storytelling Fellow, he will tell the story of deglaciation of the Northern Patagonia Ice Field in Chile, focusing on its vanishing aquatic insect diversity through images and stories of exploration, science and human connections. He will combine hiking, bikepacking, and packrafting to transect unexplored areas and secluded fjords in search of some of the rarest insects on the planet. This low carbon approach will utilize renewable energy sources to capture never before seen footage of remote glacial outlets and hidden valleys of wild Patagonia. Mr. Madriz will document the largely unknown endemic aquatic insect fauna of this vital region before Aysén’s biodiversity is transformed forever.\n\nAbby McBride\n\nNew Zeland\n\nSketch biologist Abby McBride once harbored aspirations of becoming a Victorian-era naturalist explorer. Adapting her career goals to the 21st century, she now travels globally to sketch wildlife and write multimedia stories about science and conservation. In New Zealand, home to the most diverse and endangered seabirds in the world, as a Fulbright-National Geographic Storytelling Fellow, Ms. McBride will report on extraordinary efforts to reverse centuries of human-caused harm to penguins, prions, storm-petrels, shearwaters, shags, gulls, gannets, mollymawks, and more.
