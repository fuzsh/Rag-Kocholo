        "meta_description": "The Barred Owl’s hooting call, “Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you-all?” is a classic sound of old forests and treed swamps. But this attractive owl, with soulful brown eyes and brown-and-white-striped plumage, can also pass completely unnoticed as it flies noiselessly through the dense canopy or snoozes on a tree limb. Originally a bird of the east, during the twentieth century it spread through the Pacific Northwest and southward into California.",

        "text": "Songs\n\nAlthough the Barred Owl is not technically a songbird, its distinctive \"Who cooks for you?\" call (see below) functions as a song.\n\nCalls\n\nBarred Owls have a distinctive hooting call of 8–9 notes, described as “Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you-all?” This call carries well through the woods and is fairly easy to imitate. During courtship, mated pairs perform a riotous duet of cackles, hoots, caws and gurgles.\n\nOther Sounds\n\nBoth adults and young may snap their bills during squabbles."
