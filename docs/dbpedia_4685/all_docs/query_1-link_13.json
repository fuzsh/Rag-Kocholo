        "meta_description": "The Indiana bat is a medium-sized Myotis, closely resembling the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) but differing in coloration. Its fur is a dull grayish chestnut rather than bronze, with the basal portion of the hairs on the back a dull-lead color. This bat's underparts are pinkish to cinnamon, and its hind feet are smaller and more delicate than in M. lucifugus. The calcar (heel of the foot) is strongly keeled. Summer Survey Guidelines for Indiana Bat and Northern Long-eared Bat have been released for 2022.",

        "text": "The Indiana bat is a small, insectivorous, migratory bat that hibernates colonially in caves and mines in the winter. The species was originally listed as in danger of extinction under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966 and is currently listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The scientific name of the Indiana bat is Myotis sodalis. Myotis means “mouse ear” and refers to the relatively small, mouse-like ears of the bats in this genus. Sodalis is the Latin word for “companion” and is a reference to the very social nature of the species. Indiana bats are colonial both in summer and in winter. During hibernation, clusters of up to 500 bats per square foot form in the hibernacula. The species is called the Indiana bat because the first specimen described to science in 1928 was based on a specimen found in southern Indiana’s Wyandotte Cave.\n\nIndiana bats require forests for foraging and roosting and are found in forested areas in the eastern half of the United States. In winter, Indiana bats hibernate in caves and mines. They are highly concentrated during hibernation, with 72% of the population hibernating in just four sites in Missouri, Indiana and Illinois. Other states within the range include Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2007. In spring, reproductive females migrate from hibernacula and form maternity colonies in wooded areas where each female bears a single pup that is raised within the colony. Females return to the same colony every summer. Maternity habitat ranges from areas that are completely forested to highly fragmented forest. Maternity colonies are not uniformly distributed across Indiana bat range; the highest density of maternity colonies occurs in the midwest. Males and nonreproductive females often do not roost in colonies and may stay close to their hibernaculum or migrate shorter distances to summer habitat. Summer roosts are typically behind exfoliating bark of large, often dead, trees. Both males and females return to hibernacula in late summer or early fall to mate and enter hibernation.\n\nThe 2019 winter census estimate of the population was 537,297 bats occurring within 223 hibernacula in 16 states. The current population has declined by half compared to when the species was listed as endangered.\n\nThreats to the species include human disturbance of hibernating bats, commercialization of caves where the bats hibernate, loss of summer habitat, pesticides and other contaminants, and most recently, the disease white-nose syndrome. The range-wide population has declined by 19% since 2007, when white-nose syndrome first arrived in North America.\n\nAs of November 2006, the Service had records of extant winter populations - positive winter occurrence since 1995 - of the Indiana bat at approximately 281 different hibernacula located in 19 states: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. However, most bats hibernate in just a few sites; in 2019 72% of the population hibernated in just four sites in three states.\n\nThe overall geographic range and distribution of winter habitat/hibernacula has changed relatively little since the Indiana bat was first listed with “extant” winter populations, meaning one or more positive records over past 10 years since 2009, presently occurring in 18 states. However, over the past 10 years, as significant population declines related to white-nose syndrome have occurred, there have also been considerable shifts in the spatial distribution and abundance of occupied hibernacula.\n\nIn summer, Indiana bats are largely found in the same states where they winter. In 2007, extant maternity colonies were thought to exist in 17 states. See appendix 2 in USFWS 2007. Historic summer distribution and range for this species is poorly documented, but is assumed to be similar to current summer distribution."
