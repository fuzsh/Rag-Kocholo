        "text": "Grizzly bears, Ursus arctos horribilis, are a member of the brown bear species, U. arctos, that occurs in North America, Europe and Asia. The subspecies U. a. horribilis is limited to North America and historically existed throughout much of the western half of the contiguous United States, central Mexico, western Canada and most of Alaska. Prior to 1800, an estimated 50,000 grizzly bears were distributed in one large contiguous area throughout all or portions of 18 western States, including Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Grizzly bears were probably most common in the Rocky Mountains, along the Upper Missouri River and in California. Grizzly bears were less common or did not occur in large expanses of the North American deserts and Great Plains ecoregions.\n\nWith the arrival of Europeans to North America, grizzly bears were seen as a threat to livestock and human safety and, therefore, an impediment to westward expansion and settlement. In the 1800s, in concert with European settlement of the American West and government-funded bounty programs which aimed at eradication, grizzly bears were shot, poisoned and trapped wherever they were found. The resulting declines in range and population were dramatic with rapid extinction of populations from most of Mexico and from the central and southwestern United States and California. Grizzly bears were reduced to close to 2% of their former range in the 48 contiguous states by the 1930s, with a corresponding decrease in population, approximately 125 years after first contact with European settlers. In the early 20th century, new regulations were designed to stop future extirpations. In some areas, the protections came too late. By 1975, grizzly bear populations in the 48 contiguous states had been reduced to between 700 to 800. Although significant numbers remained in Alaska and northern Canada, individuals were restricted largely to the confines of national parks and wilderness areas in Washington, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. Grizzly bears were relegated to these areas in the 48 contiguous states primarily because of limited human influences.\n\nThe 1993 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Recovery Plan identified six ecosystems, with recovery zones at the core of each, to further recovery efforts. Each recovery zone represents an area large enough and of sufficient habitat quality to support a recovered grizzly bear population. The plan recognized that grizzly bears will move and reside permanently in areas outside the recovery zones and that connectivity between recovery areas would be necessary for isolated populations to increase and sustain themselves at recovery levels.\n\nThe recovery zones identified are:\n\nThe Greater Yellowstone, referred to as GYE, in northwestern Wyoming, eastern Idaho and southwestern Montana\n\nThe Northern Continental Divide, referred to as NCDE, of north-central Montana\n\nThe North Cascades area of north-central Washington\n\nThe Selkirks, referred to as SE, area of northern Idaho, northeast Washington and southeast British Columbia\n\nThe Cabinet-Yaak, referred to as CYE, area of northwestern Montana and northern Idaho\n\nThe Bitterroot, referred to as BE, in the Bitterroot Mountains of central Idaho and western Montana\n\nCurrently, there are at least 1,923 individuals in the 48 contiguous states, with 727 in the GYE demographic monitoring area, 1,092 in the NCDE, about 60 in the CYE and a minimum of 44 in the United States portion of the SE, although some bears have home ranges that cross the international border, as documented by C.M. Costello and L. Roberts in 2021 and M.A. Haroldson and others also in 2021. In the GYE, this estimate does not capture the entire distribution of grizzly bears. In addition, grizzly bears have been verified in areas between ecosystems; however, there are likely few resident grizzly bears in the 48 contiguous states outside of the GYE, NCDE, CYE and SE. There are currently no known populations within the North Cascades or the Bitterroot Mountains of central Idaho and western Montana.\n\nEstimated distribution, or current range, represents areas in which grizzly bears are known to have established home ranges and continuously reside. Ecosystems are generally considered to be the larger area surrounding the recovery zones in which grizzly bears may be anticipated to occur as part of the same population. The Species List Area captures current range and additional areas of low-density peripheral occurrences and transitory individuals. Grizzly bears are expanding on the landscape, can disperse large distances and are not easily detectable. Developed through a standardized protocol, the Species List Area includes additional areas of verified outlier locations gathered by our state, federal and Tribal partner agencies, such as verified sightings, mortalities, conflicts and radio-collared individuals outside of current range.\n\nMap of current estimated occupied range for grizzly bears in the lower-48 States\n\nMap of Species List Area for grizzly bear used for consultation\n\nGrizzly bears in the 48 contiguous states are currently protected as a threatened species. It is illegal to harm, harass or kill these bears, except in cases of self-defense or the defense of others. Grizzly bear conservation is complex and only made possible through a variety of partnerships with the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, state wildlife agencies, Native American Tribes, federal agencies, universities and other organizations.\n\nBear Safety\n\nLearn the characteristics of bears and what you can do to prevent human-bear conflict.

Home range size is affected by resource availability, sex, age and reproductive status. Generally, females with cubs-of-the-year or yearlings have the smallest home range sizes. The large home ranges of grizzly bears, particularly males, enhance maintenance of genetic diversity in the population by enabling males to mate with numerous females.\n\nYoung, female grizzly bears usually establish home ranges within or overlapping their mother’s. This pattern of home range establishment can make dispersal of females across landscapes a slow process. Radio-telemetry and genetic data suggest females typically establish home ranges an average of 6.1 to 8.9 miles (9.8 to 14.3 kilometers) away from the center of their mother’s home range, whereas males generally disperse farther, averaging 18.6 to 26.0 miles (29.9 to 42.0 kilometers) away from the center of their mother’s home range. Maximum male dispersal distances of 42 to 109 miles (67 to 176 kilometers) have been documented in the Greater Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide ecosystems. Studies also indicate that females can and do disperse long distances up to 50 to 56 miles (80 to 90 kilometers), typically on the periphery of expanding populations. Although the frequency of long-distance dispersal by females is much lower than males, it can contribute to range expansion and demographic connectivity between populations.\n\nHome range sizes vary among the ecosystems because of population densities and habitat productivity, as well as methodology. In the 48 contiguous states, observed average annual adult female home ranges vary from 130 to 358 kilometers-squared and average annual adult male home range vary from 475 to 2,162 kilometers-squared."
