        "text": "Picture this: you're taking a walk on a warm day in June, admiring the sun's rays shining through trees swaying in the breeze. One collective sound rises above the rest of nature's symphony: the inescapable hum of hidden cicadas.\n\nThis iconic cicada cacophony can be heard most summers in Illinois, but 2024 is a particularly special year for these critters. Two broods, or groups of periodical cicadas, are emerging simultaneously for the first time in 200+ years (since 1803), and Illinois is one of two states (the other being Iowa) where both broods will be making an appearance.\n\nKeep reading to find out who will be a part of this year's cicada chorus, what they contribute to nature's band, where you can go to hear their songs in Illinois and more.\n\n\"These cicadas spend 16 years underground drinking the sap from tree roots, so you only find them near trees and forest habitat,\" explains Dr. Elizabeth Bach, the research scientist at TNC's Nachusa Grasslands Preserve (one of TNC's preserves that will witness a brood XIII emergence this year).\n\nOnce they begin to emerge, the symphony will begin. Illinois residents can expect to see, or more likely hear, trillions of cicadas this spring. This happens as a result of an evolutionary survival strategy called predator satiation. When a population of organisms shows up in mass, predators get their fill, but canâ€™t possibly eat all the creatures. This ensures that plenty of cicadas will live on and reproduce. For cicadas, there is certainly safety in numbers.\n\nAfter the cicadas mate, the females will lay their eggs in the branches of trees. Once the eggs hatch, the nymphs will crawl back into the ground near the tree's roots where they will spend years growing before emerging another 17 years from now. And just like that, the cycle repeats. Not much is known about what happens while they're underground since we can't see it, but they are likely not moving around or communicating with each other down there.\n\nThe exact emergence timing varies by location and other factors, the largest being soil temperatures. Soil must reach 64 degrees Fahrenheit before cicadas begin to come out. For example, soil is warmer near pavement, so areas in or near cities like Chicago are expected to see a faster emergence than other locations. Some cicadas have already begun to emerge at preserves like TNC's Indian Boundary Prairies Preserve and will continue to do so through mid-June.\n\nHow You Can Help Cicadas\n\nWith cicadas popping up all over the state, you may be wondering how they will affect your pets, plants or yard. Good news: cicadas are harmless on all counts.\n\nWhile they may emit a piercing screech to attract a mate, they do not bite or sting and are not poisonous to humans, dogs or cats. They also do not eat plants and will not kill mature trees and shrubs they may lay their eggs on. If you are worried about potential damage, the best thing to do is to cover your trees with netting. Spraying the tree with chemicals wonâ€™t stop the cicadas and may poison the animals that eventually eat them, so avoid pesticides.\n\nDespite the blaring mating calls yet to come, Illinois residents have many reasons to be excited for this rare combination of cicada broods showing up in huge numbers this year. Enjoy the concert!"
