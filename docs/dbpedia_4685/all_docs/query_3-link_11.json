Later, Rick answers questions from one of our young listeners.\n\nEpisode 30 - Currently Live\n\nNorthern White Rhino: A Race Against Time\n\nAfter spotlighting the southern white rhino, Amazing Wildlife explores a functionally extinct subspecies, the northern white rhino. “Functionally extinct” means there is no chance for the current population, as it is, to naturally reproduce. Hosts Rick and Ebone detail what led to the northern white rhino’s critically endangered status and the factors that make it impossible for this rhino to mate and reproduce on its own. San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance's Barbara Durant, director of reproductive sciences, and Marlys Houck, curator of the Frozen Zoo, join the show to discuss the reproduction technologies scientists are using to preserve and maintain northern white rhino genes to bring the subspecies back.\n\nEpisode 31 - Currently Live\n\nPrzewalski's Horse: Last of the Wild\n\nAmazing Wildlife uncovers fascinating facts about the last living \"wild\" horse, the Przewalski's horse! Hosts Rick and Ebone explain how the closest living relative of the domestic horse got its unique name, and its recovery from once being considered extinct in nature. Later, we’re joined by San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance’s Barbara Durant, director of reproductive sciences, and Marlys Houck, curator of the Frozen Zoo, to hear about the first cloned Przewalski's horse, conservation efforts to save the species, and the process of reintroducing it into its natural habitat.\n\nEpisode 32 - Currently Live\n\nFiji Iguana: Camouflaged Cutie\n\nWhat is the beautifully colored arboreal species found only on the Fiji Islands? We’re talking about the Fiji iguana!

Kim Gray, curator of herpetology and ichthyology at the San Diego Zoo, makes an appearance to explain the Species Survival Plan (SSP) program and the threats that impact the Fiji banded iguana.\n\nEpisode 33 - Currently Live\n\nCalifornia Condor: Soaring from Extinction\n\nThe spectacular California condor is the largest bird in North America. They are known for their enormous black wings that can stretch nearly 10 feet from tip to tip. At one time, there were thousands of California condors across the western United States and in Mexico. In the 1970s, biologists found that only a few dozen condors remained in their native habitats. On this episode of Amazing Wildlife, hosts Rick and Ebone will talk to San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance Associate Director of Recovery Ecology Nacho Vilchis, and to Ron Webb, lead wildlife care specialist for the condor project. We’ll explore how San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance worked with partners to save the California condor when there were only 22 left in the world!\n\nEpisode 34 - Currently Live\n\nCheetah: Made for Speed\n\nAs the fastest mammal on land, the cheetah can reach speeds of up to 70 miles an hour.

At nearly 6 feet tall, the southern cassowary isn’t the world’s tallest bird—and although males can weigh up to 121 pounds, that’s not enough to make the cassowary the heaviest bird. But cassowaries might hold the title of the bird with the fiercest reputation.\n\nEpisode 40 - Currently Live\n\nTasmanian Devil: Ghosts of Tasmania\n\nThey are carnivorous. They are marsupials. They are endangered. Amazing Wildlife explores what makes the Tasmanian devil so fascinating. Their powerful bite and ghostly snarl have led to the “devil” comparisons—but while they may look fierce, Tasmanian devils typically eat wildlife that has already died, instead of hunting. Hosts Rick and Ebone will discuss the disease outbreak that is behind a dramatic decline in the devil population.\n\nEpisode 41 - Currently Live\n\nKangaroo: Mighty Marsupials\n\nThis episode of Amazing Wildlife spotlights one of Australia's most beloved endemic species.
