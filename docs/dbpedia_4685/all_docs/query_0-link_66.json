        "text": "When the weather starts to warm up, we see frogs everywhere and it's no surprise with the rivers, lakes, and ponds that surround us in New York.\n\nI love to sit on my porch and just listen to the frogs and the crickets. I enjoy hearing the sounds of the spring peepers. Spring peepers are little tree frogs that can be found in New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the winter, the spring peepers hibernate but when the weather starts to warm up they come out and hide under leaves and sometimes on trees. They sing what a lot of people call the \"soundtrack of spring in New York.\"\n\nSpring peepers look like tree bark and they can even make themselves lighter or darker depending on their location so they're better camouflaged. The sound the spring peeper makes is its mating song which sounds like a high-pitched whistling sound that gets repeated about 20 times in 60 seconds. That's a lot of peeping!\n\nHere's another interesting thing about the sound they make, if they sing really fast and really loud, they have a better chance of attracting a mate.\n\nIt won't be long until you can hear the sound of the spring peeper in person but until then, here is a video to help remind you the spring peepers will be out soon and that means springtime!"
