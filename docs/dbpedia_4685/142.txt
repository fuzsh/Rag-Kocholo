[Mating Calls] Episode 145 - Sex Tourists

<< Pride 2024

It's a solo show for Martha Two Shakes today, and an upbeat summer kitchen episode of Mating Calls is coming your way. A little stony, a little prideful 🏳️‍🌈, and a lot in celebration of the season that brings us all out of the darkness and into the sun. Get ready for a fun, eclectic but endlessly glittery set featuring a brand new track from Mope Grooves, a classic by Brigitte Bardot, two from Mild High Club and BMSR, a dance set, a few reggae tracks, a fave from our friends in Big Soft Punch (@bigsoftpunch.music) and so! many! more.

Listen to Mating Calls Mondays from 4-6pm
