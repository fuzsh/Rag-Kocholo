The Two Mrs. Carrolls (1947)

Whatever you do, if you’ve never seen Humphrey Bogart in a movie, don’t rent The Two Mrs. Carrolls. You will never like him again, even when you see him in the adorable The African Queen. He plays such a bad guy in this movie, it’s hard to see why anyone thought to cast him as a good guy later in his career.

The opening scene shows Humph and Barbara Stanwyck in love and on holiday in Scotland. When we find out Humph is married and has a child, their bliss is cut short. And when he poisons his wife in the next scene to make way for the second Mrs. Carroll, he destroys any chances of the audience hoping he was just misunderstood. Poor Barbara has no idea what she’s getting into.

The Two Mrs. Carolls is extremely soapy, with tons of plot holes, cringe-worthy character decisions, and an overly dramatic theme from Franz Waxman. Humph isn’t the smartest criminal, and Barbara isn’t the smartest victim. From her tearful, frightened performance, it’s no wonder she was cast in Sorry, Wrong Number the very next year. The supporting cast in this movie isn’t spectacular; Alexis Smith plays the “other woman”, Nigel Bruce is the incompetent doctor, and Patrick O’Moore isn’t very convincing as being a romantic rival. Still, for some serious soap, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a more ridiculous movie from 1947.
