        "text": "Category: thriller\n\nSeven Deaths in the Cat’s Eyes\n\n(Antonio Margheriti, 1973) Another bonkers Italian horror set in a nebulously located Scottish castle. But where The Ghost was filmed entirely on an anonymous mansion set that could really have been anywhere in Europe and featured just one minor character with a Scottish accent, this film revels in its location, drawing on that old Scottish … Continue reading Seven Deaths in the Cat’s Eyes\n\nWhite Settlers\n\n(Simeon Halligan, 2014) This was billed as the “Indy Ref horror” on release because it came out around the time of the first Referendum and it’s about an English couple who move to Scotland and are driven out by angry locals. Given that semi-officially-endorsed tagline, I was expecting something nuanced, a film with things to … Continue reading White Settlers\n\nHunted\n\n(Charles Crichton, 1952) A really rather splendid thriller from Ealing luminary Charles Crichton, who had just directed The Lavender Hill Mob the previous year. It begins in media res, with young boy Robbie (Jon Whiteley) running rather startlingly straight into the camera, across a busy London street; we follow him into a bombed-out basement, where … Continue reading Hunted\n\nNew Town Killers\n\n(Richard Jobson, 2008) I thought this was going to be your basic “rich people hunt poor people for sport” thriller. Two New Town bankers pursue an unemployed kid from Leith through the Edinburgh night, revelling in the chase, intent on the kill. But while it absolutely is that, it also manages to be just a … Continue reading New Town Killers\n\nMadame Sin\n\n(David Greene, 1972) This is a lovely slice of lurid 70s pulp. Former intelligence agent Anthony Lawrence (Robert Wagner) is kidnapped by Denholm Elliott and spirited away to a secret castle on a tiny Scottish island, where he is introduced to the mysterious Madame Sin, played with aplomb – and clear relish – by the … Continue reading Madame Sin\n\nThe Two Mrs Carrolls\n\n(Peter Godfrey, 1947) The Two Mrs Carrolls opens in Scotland – vaguely, somewhere, by a river – but the action soon moves to the south of England, never to return. And I'm left with a decision on how comprehensive I want this list to be. I think the answer is, as comprehensive as possible – … Continue reading The Two Mrs Carrolls\n\nThe Girl with a Pistol\n\n(Mario Monicelli, 1968) When I started compiling a list of every film in Scotland, I knew there were a few cheap Italian horrors set here, but I had no idea Mario Monicelli had directed a film with Scottish sequences – and one starring Monica Vitti, no less. The Girl with a Pistol sees Vitti wronged … Continue reading The Girl with a Pistol\n\nA Lonely Place to Die\n\n(Julian Gilbey, 2011) A rather nihilistic thriller in which a group of mountain-climbers discover a young girl buried alive in a box in the Highlands and find themselves pursued by her captors. There follows a tense cat-and-mouse as they make their way across wild rivers, through sparse new forests, and down sheer rock faces, before … Continue reading A Lonely Place to Die\n\nThe House of Fear\n\n(Roy William Neill, 1945) It’s funny, given Arthur Conan Doyle was born and educated in Edinburgh, that so few Holmes stories take place in Scotland. Still, there are a few films set here, and two of them are Basil Rathbone ones, no less: proper Holmes. The first, The House of Fear, is very, very loosely … Continue reading The House of Fear"
