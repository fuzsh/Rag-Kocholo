        "text": "rev., March 22, 2016.\n\nThe Two Mrs Carrolls of the title of this movie are the first wife of Humphrey Bogart, whom we only see in a rather gothic realist portrait of her, and, then, after she dies, Barbara Stanwyck. The word is that the movie was delayed in its release because the studio didn’t think anyone would believe Bogart as an artist and Stanwyck as a beleaguered wife but those issues shake out now and one is only left to concede that now and then the writing gets a bit clunky, as, for example, when Bogie laments not meeting Stanwyck’s ex, he jokes I think I just missed the beginning of a long hatred (ha ha). Though the movie is not a horror movie per se it does have thriller sequences, and it is set in an English country house on a rainy night, and there is a mad artist, with mad portraits about, so it is a fairly close cousin. Overall the story is that he as an artist only seems to get the juices flowing when, after marrying a woman who supports him, he has an affair with another woman, to the extent that to move things along he plots to kill the current wife, and does, and in the interval of the killing, seems to do his best, darkest work. The minute things get OK again, as for example in the early days with Stanwyck, where he has moved entirely into her English country house living life, he does bad work. But then Alexis Smith comes along as a buyer of his art and she is so swell in her leopard skin and furs that Bogie falls for her and begins to plot again to serve the wife milk, who then gets sick, and then the switcheroo zone takes over, so he paint a gruesomely Charles Addams style portrait of Stanwyck that we see exactly once for a second. The primary pleasures of the movie have to do with repeatedly appraisals of his work, of the portrait of his ex, and of the use of other portraits scattered around his domain to signal changing moods. The country house is swell and very adept studio style is used to do up the mantel carving, the curtains, the pictures on the wall, and they even knew that little cameo pictures of Mary Shelley type ladies signaled that trouble was brewing for the woman of the house. Theres a nice bit when Bogart gets testy with his too adroit and grownup daughter talking about the insanity of Van Gogh, lots of good stuff with him hating the constant bell ringing in this all churched up English country town, and even Nigel Bruce shows up as the whiskey stealing doc and he is good too. The wrap up may all be a bit melodramatically pat as from the daughter Stanwyck finds out things that make her suspect Bogart, in the context of her suspicions they fetch the key to his studio to get a peak at the portrait of her, that makes her faint, then when we get wind of the fact that Bogart is being blackmailed by his poisoner chemist and there is a headline in the local paper about a local murder and then they are alone but Stanwyck refuses to let him in their room, he goes mad and comes through the windows, which is a great Bogart shot, only for the police to show up for Bogart, at the door of the bedroom, to explain, You wouldn’t understand, I had to do this, so I could go on with my work. Ok, its got its stiltedness, but its just classic Hollywood studio work also from a time when it did seem as if the American and English film cultures were entirely overlapping each other."
