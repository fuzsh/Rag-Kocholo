        "text": "Humphrey Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck had a friendly relationship on set. Producer Mark Hellinger, whom Bogart liked very much, agreed that Bogart would not be seen in any painter's wardrobe which would conflict with the tough guy image he had cultivated. When a painter's smock and beret with a tassel showed up on his wardrobe clothes rack one day, the actor was furious. The smock and beret were a joke perpetrated by Stanwyck, and the two performers had a good laugh afterward.\n\nIn this film, Humphrey Bogart says \"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful hatred\", which may be a nod to the famous line from Casablanca (1942)."
