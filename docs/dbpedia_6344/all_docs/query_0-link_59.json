When the two perform together in a production of \"Othello,\" the strain of playing Othello drives John insane, to the point of killing his mistress, Pat Kroll (Shelley Winters). John does not remember the incident, but is forced to face his actions when promoter Bill Friend (Edmond O'Brien) uses the murder to publicize the play.",
