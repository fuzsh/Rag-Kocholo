        "text": "Football season is near.\n\nPractice for private schools, 1A through 4A programs and 5A and 6A schools that didn’t hold spring camp kicks off on Monday. The rest of the 5A and 6A programs will start practice on Aug. 12. Game play begins Aug. 29.\n\nBetween a legendary coach coming out of retirement, players changing teams and the UIL’s biennial realignment and reclassification shaking up the high school football landscape, much is in store for the 2024 season.\n\nHere are 10 storylines to follow as Texas high school football returns.\n\nWill DeSoto, Duncanville three-peat?\n\nDeSoto and Duncanville swept the last two Class 6A state championships and look to become among the select programs in state history to complete a three-peat in football.\n\nBoth programs look primed to pull it off, leading the area with six athletes each in The Dallas Morning News’ top 100 recruits in the Class of 2025.\n\nDeSoto, the reigning UIL 6A Division II champ, has already won one state championship in 2024, going undefeated in pool play at the state 7-on-7 tournament in June before defeating Austin Anderson 38-20 for the Division I title.\n\nRelated:Duncanville, DeSoto schedule out-of-state powerhouses with Texas schools unwilling to play\n\nAt the tournament, three-star transfer quarterback Kelden Ryan and four-star SMU pledge Daylon Singleton showed off their budding connection that should only continue to grow throughout the fall. Ryan will also toss passes to Ethan “Boobie” Feaster, a sophomore wide receiver with 45 college offers, and will hand off to four-star Texas A&M commit Deondrae “Tiger” Riden in the backfield.\n\nOn defense, DeSoto returns three-star safety Sael Reyes and just added transfer star linebacker/edge rusher DJ Rumph.\n\nDefending UIL 6A Division I state champ Duncanville boasts The News’ top area recruit in five-star wide receiver Dakorien Moore, an Oregon pledge. He’ll catch passes from five-star Alabama commit Keelon Russell. Duncanville returns Javion Holiday at cornerback and Tyren Polley Jr. at safety. Both are SMU pledges.\n\nTodd Dodge makes his Lovejoy debut\n\nPerhaps the biggest story of the offseason was Todd Dodge’s return to coaching Texas high school football after a brief retirement. The addition of the legendary coach instantly made Lovejoy, a 5A Division II Region II finalist last season, more of a contender than it already was.\n\nDodge, a seven-time state champion as a coach (four at Southlake Carroll and three at Austin Westlake), will lead Lovejoy through a tough District 4-5AII and potentially through 5A Region I, which became one of the most difficult roads to state after UIL reclassification and realignment for the 2024-26 cycle.\n\nRelated:Why coaches like Todd Dodge returned to Texas high school football after brief retirement\n\nHe makes his game debut as Lovejoy’s coach on Aug. 30 against Lubbock Cooper. And no, Carroll, coached by Dodge’s son Riley Dodge, is not on Lovejoy’s non-district schedule. The father and son matched up once before — at the 2020 6A Division I state championship that Dodge’s Westlake won — and figured that would be the first and last time that happens.\n\nWill SOC return to the state championship?\n\nA late Port Neches-Groves touchdown in the dwindling minutes of the fourth quarter at the 5A Division II state championship game ended South Oak Cliff’s three-peat campaign, but SOC coach Jason Todd gave every indication that the two-time state champion will be back at AT&T Stadium in 2024.\n\nWith schools like Lovejoy and Melissa moving from Region II to Region I after reclassification and realignment, the path to state looks a bit simpler for SOC than it did in previous years. But SOC’s pre-district schedule won’t be. SOC meets 2023 6A Division I state runner-up Galena Park North Shore in Week 1, defending 6A Division I state champion Duncanville in Week 2 and state power Longview, which just moved up to Class 6A this year, in Week 3.\n\nThat three-game run alone should help SOC prepare for another run at state.\n\nIs Class 4A Division I Frisco Panther Creek’s for the taking?\n\nIn just its second varsity season, Frisco Panther Creek showed that it can hang with the best teams in Class 4A Division I.\n\nPanther Creek defeated eight-time UIL state champion Celina 31-27 in the 2023 regular season finale for the District 7-4A Division I championship, and lost 42-38 to eventual 4A Division I state champion Anna on a late touchdown in the third round of last year’s playoffs.\n\nWith Anna now competing in Class 5A and a win over Celina under its belt, Class 4A Division I could belong to Panther Creek this year.\n\nWhile Panther Creek lost a productive quarterback in Braxton Roberts, it returns all-state wide receiver Cristian Trickett and added four-star athlete Jalen Lott. Both turned in stellar performances at the state 7-on-7 tournament in June, where Panther Creek went undefeated in pool play.\n\nWill Highland Park dominate in Class 5A Division I?\n\nAfter spending the last two seasons in Class 6A, Highland Park moved down to Class 5A Division I, a familiar place.\n\nHighland Park won its last three state championships in 5A Division I, completing a three-peat in 2018 and advancing to the regional final in 2020. But the six-time UIL state champion has not won a football state title in Class 6A, where the program also competed during the 2014-16 alignment.\n\nOften on the cuff between 5A Division I and the state’s largest classification, Highland Park is one of the smaller 6A schools in Texas when it is assigned as such. As a 6A school, Highland Park has not made it past the third round of the playoffs.\n\nThis year could mark Highland Park’s next deep run now that it competes in 5A Division I, though Midlothian and Red Oak, both playoff teams last year, could pose challenges for the program in District 7-5AI.\n\nOne of the Frisco ISD schools (most notably, Lone Star, Wakeland and Reedy) could be the biggest threat to Highland Park in the Region II section of the playoff bracket, but 12-time state champion Aledo is certainly the goliath in 5A Division I and seeks another 3-peat.\n\nParish Episcopal tries for six in a row\n\nSeniors on the Parish Episcopal football team have won a state championship each year they’ve been in high school.\n\nThe private school won its fifth consecutive TAPPS Division I football title with a 40-29 win over Houston St. Thomas in the state championship last year and looks to extend that streak to six.\n\nWith senior quarterback Sawyer Anderson, a three-year starter and three-star Purdue pledge, leading the offense and three-star junior wide receiver Jaylen Pile catching his passes, Parish looks on track to complete another title run.\n\nPlano Prestonwood Christian and Argyle Liberty Christian, the 2023 TAPPS Division II champ, will be Parish’s biggest challengers in district play. Parish defeated Prestonwood Christian 49-40 for the TAPPS 1-I championship last season.\n\nWho is making it out of the “new District of Doom?”\n\nThe reveal of the new-look District 4-5AII after the University Interscholastic League’s latest biennial realignment in February was jaw-dropping.\n\nMembership includes 2023 4A Division I state champion Anna, state power Melissa, a Todd Dodge-led Lovejoy team and Frisco Emerson, a 5A Division II state semifinalist last year. The Dallas Morning News dubbed 4-5AII the “new District of Doom” in a comparison to District 11-6A, home to DeSoto and Duncanville.\n\nDistrict 4-5AII certainly looks like one of the toughest districts in the state and could be anyone’s for the taking.\n\nLovejoy was a regional finalist last year before Dodge became its new head coach and boasts a four-star wide receiver in Daylan McCutcheon, a Florida State pledge. Anna is fresh off a state championship and Melissa was the top-ranked 5A team in Texas for much of last season. Emerson, which has posted only winning seasons since starting varsity play just two years ago, looks to have another solid showing this fall.\n\nOG “District of Doom” deadlier than ever\n\nYeah, District 4-5AII is stacked, but the original “District of Doom” somehow got stronger after the UIL’s biennial realignment.\n\nThe staples remained. DeSoto, the reigning 6A Division II state champion that opted up to Class 6A despite turning in 5A Division I enrollment numbers, and Duncanville, the reigning 6A Division I champion, will likely battle it out for the District 11-6A title again this season. Waxahachie advanced to the second round of the postseason in 2023. Three-time state champion Cedar Hill went four rounds deep last fall.\n\nMesquite, Mesquite Horn and Lancaster took the place of the Mansfield ISD schools that moved to District 3-6A. Lancaster, which moved up to Class 6A this season, was a regional finalist last year and boasts four athletes on The News’ top 100 recruits for the Class of 2025. Due to the difficulty of District 11-6A, a solid team from this group that would likely qualify for the playoffs in any other district could very well miss the playoffs in 2024. That’s just life in the OG District of Doom\n\nWhat’s next for Anna?\n\nNo longer a small town, booming Anna has a football team to match.\n\nThe 2023 4A Division I state champion that moved up to Class 5A Division II in reclassification and realignment embarks on a new journey in 2024. Anna, which went undefeated in pool play at the state 7-on-7 tournament in June before losing to eventual champion DeSoto 33-19 in the Division I semifinal, could face some challenges during its first season in Class 5A.\n\nDistrict 4-5AII, the ‘new District of Doom’ will be a fight, and if Anna makes it to the playoffs, Region I postseason play will be just as tough with Argyle, Colleyville Heritage and Mansfield Timberview comprising part of that field. Anna’s offense should be in good shape. The team returns three-star, all-state quarterback Ziondre Williams and added three-star wide receiver Ashton Ansley during the offseason.\n\nWho will challenge the reigning 6A state champs?\n\nThe biggest threat to DeSoto’s three-peat hopes would likely come out of the Dallas-area, based on recent history. DeSoto survived eight-time UIL state champ Southlake Carroll 45-38 in last year’s 6A Division II state semifinal. In 6A Division I, Duncanville’s biggest challenger would likely be Galena Park North Shore, which lost the last two state title games to Reginald Samples and his juggernaut team.\n\nBut there are plenty more programs looking to unseat the champs.\n\nDenton Guyer, which graduated five-star quarterback Jackson Arnold in 2023, now has another elite signal caller in four-star Oklahoma pledge Kevin Sperry. Guyer was a state semifinalist in 2022 and made runs at state in 2019 and 2021, too. North Crowley went undefeated last season before losing to Duncanville in the 6A Division I state semifinal. Five-time state champion Allen advanced to the 6A Division I Region I final in 2023.\n\nOn Twitter: @t_myah\n\nFind more high school sports coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."
