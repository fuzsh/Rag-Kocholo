        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Thomas Job\n\nBased on the play by Martin Vale\n\nDirector: Peter Godfrey\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck, Alexis Smith, Ann Carter, Nigel Bruce\n\nCinematography: J. Peverell Marley\n\nMusic: Franz Waxman\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: March 4, 1947\n\n“The Two Mrs. Carrolls” is unusual in how terrible it is.\n\nUsually when I don’t like a movie, I can pinpoint a few parts of the production which caused the awfulness. But this is one of… perhaps the only?… time during this entire Odyssey when I have seen so many otherwise-competent filmmakers collectively shit the bed.\n\nThe plot concerns a tortured artist named Geoffrey (Humphrey Bogart) who, while vacationing in Scotland, falls head over heels for Sally (Barbara Stanwyck). The only problem is that he’s already got a wife and daughter Beatrice (Ann Carter) at home. So he buys poison from a local chemist (Barry Bernard) under an assumed named and kills his wife by administering the poison in her milk. Then he marries Sally, moves into her idyllic English country estate… and begins lusting after family-friend-twice-removed Cecily (Alexis Smith). And thus the cycle begins again. But will Sally figure it out in time to stop another murder from taking place… her own?\n\nIf you are reading that and thinking that it sounds eerily similar to noir films “Gaslight” and “Suspicion,” you would be correct. This is a blatant rip-off, but without the technical prowess of “Suspicion” or the emotional trauma of “Gaslight.” There’s even a motherfucking glass of poisoned milk delivered by the husband! I’m surprised it wasn’t glowing.\n\nScreenwriter Thomas Job (“Escape in the Desert”) assumes the viewer is a fool and that he has to repeat every pertinent bit of information to the plot at least three times in order for us to pick up on things. This includes small stuff, like when Geoffrey buys the poison from the chemist and uses a fake name. The Chemist repeats the fake name “Fleming” three times, each more intensely than the last… and the third is after Geoffrey leaves as he repeats the name while stroking his chin, suspicious of the name for literally no understandable reason except to make sure the audience understands that this story development will come back later.\n\nThen there are the big things, like the explanation of what Geoffrey is doing. It’s not enough that we see what he’s up to. No, we need recaps every few minutes during the second half. First Sally has a ten-minute conversation (not hyperbole) with Beatrice where the little girl handily explains everything her father was doing to his first wife and how that is being repeated now while Sally cringes in terror. But then, a few moments later, we get a scene where Sally is alone in her bedroom, haunted by voiceover of what we just heard while cringing and connecting the dots for us. But then, at the climax, Geoffrey stops just short of killing Sally and instead re-explains for four minutes (again, not hyperbole) what he is doing and why he is doing it.\n\nPlay a drinking game if you watch the film – every time information is repeated three times in dialogue, take a shot. You’ll be blacked out by the end of the third reel.\n\nThat said, to be clear, you shouldn’t watch the film.\n\nBogart and Stanwyck are grossly miscast in the lead roles, both hamming it up to a shocking extent, complete with hair-pulling, grabbing their foreheads as they struggle with something mentally and screaming for no apparent reason. It’s kind of baffling how they were both roped into such a stinker and honestly look embarrassed in certain scenes. There’s a coda where the filmmakers turn the entire proceedings into a joke (because of course they do) where Geoffrey asks the police arresting him if they want some milk, and you can all but see Bogart cringing onscreen trying to deliver the line. Smith is given nothing to do but slink around with obvious mustache twirling… why was she even cast in such a throwaway role? Carter is unfortunate playing the unfortunate clam of the little who speaks like an adult, and Nigel Bruce is also on hand to do a mustachioed version of his bumbling Doctor Watson… obviously cast because he was also in “Suspicion.”\n\nThe director is Peter Godfrey, who made the almost-good “Cry Wolf” and the almost-terrible “Woman in White.” Was he napping for the entire shoot? Or was he the guy encouraging Bogart and Stanwyck to overact? Whatever the case – how dare you, sir! His cinematographer is J. Peverell Marley, who is a good cinematographer elsewhere in movies like “Whiplash” and “Hound of the Baskervilles.” But here? Even a thunderstorm looks boring under his lens. In the entire (much too long) 100 minute running time, there is only one memorable shot – when Geoffrey breaks through the window into Sally’s room at the climax, but even that is undercut by having Geoffrey immediately start to monologue after.\n\nIt doesn’t help that the set-design is also terrible. Sally is supposed to be well off, not rich (as underlined three times in the screenplay), but we get essentially a castle for her and Geoffrey to live in… way overdesigned to the point where it’s funny. You can tell great care was taken at crafting it – all for naught. Hell, it doesn’t even shoot well, so maybe it wasn’t all Marley’s fault.\n\nDear reader, there were many, many moments where I considered turning off “The Two Mrs. Carrolls” because of its ineptitude. The only reason I made it through is to write this article. But you? You don’t have to put up with this torture. Run far, run fast… just run."
