        "text": "Growing up I was aware of who Humphrey Bogart was. In my youth I watched a great deal of television and many movies. However it was not until I was in my thirties that I saw my first Humphrey Bogart movie. That movie was Casablanca and I have been an enormous Humphrey Bogart fan since. Over the last decade and a half I have been making up for lost time. In that span I have viewed almost all of Humphrey Bogart’s films. I own many of his movies and I return to them regularly for repeated viewings. Casablanca was my introduction to the greatness of Humphrey Bogart. The movie also proved to be a gateway for a exploration into the movies of classic Hollywood circa the 1930’s, 1940’s and 1950’s. I have devoted a great deal of time delving into the movies of James Cagney, Bette Davis, Edward G. Robinson, Robert Mitchum and Joan Crawford, as well as others. Among so many great actors it is the work of Humphrey Bogart that consistently captivates me.\n\nThis top ten is not a list of Humphrey Bogart’s “best” movies. Rather it is a list of my favorite Bogart movies. These are movies that truly speak to me. I return to these movies again and again. In any given year it is guaranteed that at some point I will view at least one of this movies. It was a difficult task picking ten movies. Attempting to rank these ten would be even harder. The ten films are listed in order by release date.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941) – Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Mary Astor, Elisha Cook Jr. and Lee Patrick, what a cast! After years of playing supporting roles this was the movie that finally launched Bogart as an A- List movie star. He proved that he was far more than just a gangster, henchmen or flunky. Bogart excels as private detective Sam Spade. He brilliantly leads the strong supporting cast through this multilayered mystery.\n\nCasablanca (1942) – What more can be said about this all time classic. As the reluctant hero Rick Blaine, Bogart was never cooler. The Paris flashback is one of my all time favorite movie sequences. The focus for many is the romance between Rick and Ilsa Lund. But the strength of Sam and Rick’s friendship is often overlooked. For me the appeal of this movie seems to grow, as time goes by.\n\nSahara (1943) – One of Bogart’s best movies and one of his most overlooked. This extremely well written World War Two drama has Bogart leading an excellent cast across the desert in a tank. The rag tag crew consists of British, American, French, Italian, African and German soldiers. Tensions fly as this collective attempt to work together with a common, but short term, goal of finding a well in the enormous Sahara desert. Bogart is given a rare opportunity with this leading role. He is neither a gangster, an anti hero, a reluctant hero or a romantic lead. He skillfully portrays a man on a mission trying to safely lead the men under his commander.\n\nDead Reckoning (1947) A Humphrey Bogart film noir. Dead Reckoning has Bogart cast beside one of the queens of film noir, Lizabeth Scott. Allegedly Bogart wanted Lauren Bacall for this role, but I believe that Scott was the right choice. Bogart is attempting to discover why his friend and war buddy was murdered. The movie features a man with a mysterious past, voice over narration, flashbacks, and of course a femme fatale. Dead Reckoning is a great one-two punch. It is a great Humphrey Bogart movie and a great film noir.\n\nDark Passage (1947) – One of four movies to feature Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Whereas Key Largo can be characterized as a gangster/crime movie, Dark Passage is a great film noir movie. Bogart is Vincent Parry, a man falsely accused of murdering his wife. He escapes prison and sets out to prove his innocence. After a visit to a plastic surgeon Parry gets a new face. Despite the over the top premise, Bogart and Bacall and a solid supporting cast make it work. Agnes Moorehead is especially good in a supporting role.\n\nKey Largo (1948) – The second Bogie and Bacall film to make the list. Bogart portrays Frank McCloud, a former army soldier traveling to the Florida Keys. In Key Largo he visits a hotel owned by the widow and the father of his deceased friend, a fellow army soldier. Unbeknownst to McCloud the hotel has been taken over by gangster Johnny Rocko and his crew. Edward G. Robinson is phenomenal as Johnny Rocko. Bogart may be listed as the star, but Robinson just about steals the movie away from him. A stellar cast, a taunt story and fantastic execution from director John Huston. It is extremely cliched to say, but they just do not make movies like this one anymore.\n\nIn A Lonely Place (1950) – This is a dark film noir that features a tragic love story. The movie’s co-star is the wonderful Gloria Grahame as Laurel Grey. Bogart plays Dixon Steele, a screenwriter with extreme anger issues. Laurel Grey has just moved into the apartment complex where Dixon Steels also lives. The two meet when both are questioned by the police in regards to the murder of a young woman. That same woman was last seen alive exiting Steel’s apartment. Despite this fact Laurel is drawn to Dixon and he to her. Watching Bogart and Grahame fall in love is a glorious thing. Watching Bogart’s inner demons slowly destroy their relationship is a tragic and devastating experience. Bogart spent much of his career playing flawed characters. None were as flawed or as self destructive as Dixon Steele.\n\nSirocco (1951) – The first time I watched Sirocco I felt it was a bit slow. However there was something about the movie that warranted a second viewing. A second viewing prompted a third and a fourth, etc, etc. Repeated viewings have caused Sirocco to rise higher and higher on my list of Bogart favorites. The movie is an obvious attempt to recapture some of the magic of Casablanca. An antihero with a mysterious past, a beautiful love interest, an exotic locale during wartime and a multi-ethnic supporting cast filled with colorful characters. Overall Sirocco is a darker and more cynical film than Casablanca. Co-stars Lee J. Cobb and Marta Toren deserve special mention.\n\nThe Left Hand Of God (1955) – One of Bogart’s most overlooked movies. That is a shame because The Left Hand Of God is one of the best movies from the latter half of Bogart’s career. One of the few color movies to feature Bogart. Gene Tierney co-stars as Anne Scott, a nurse working at a Catholic mission in China. Bogart portrays Father O’Shea, a priest with a mysterious past and unconventional ways. The excellent supporting cast includes Agnes Moorehead, E.G. Marshall and Lee J. Cobb.\n\nThe Desperate Hours (1955) – Another overlooked movie from Bogart’s vast filmography. Late in his career he returns to playing the antagonist. Bogart portrays Glen Griffin, an escaped convict who leads two fellow escapees on the run. The group arrives in a small suburb and proceed to take over a house in a quiet neighborhood. The house is occupied by the Hilliard family. Griffin and his crew take the family hostage while awaiting the delivery of an important package. He assures the family that once he has the package he and his crew will leave. Griffin insists that the family resume their normal routine. Daniel Hilliard, the father, is sent to work. Cindy Hilliard, the teenage daughter, is picked up by her boyfriend. Eleanor and Ralphie Hilliard, mother and son, remain in the house to insure that Daniel and Cindy do not involve the police. The tension builds as the movie progresses. Griffin attempts to control a tight situation with far too many moving parts. Little by little the situation slowly unravels.\n\nTroy T."
