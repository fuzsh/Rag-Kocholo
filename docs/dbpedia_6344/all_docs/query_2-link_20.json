        "text": "I only saw this from half way through but it was easy to pick the storyline up. Also, this was the first movie I saw Barbara Stanwyck in and she’s an amazing actress. Humphrey Bogart gives an amazing performance as a bizarre killer. Bogart plays a artist who’s wife dies a mysterious death after he painted her as the Angel Of Death. He marries Sally (Barbara Stanwyck) and as the same strange urge to paint her the angel of death. As bizarre and strange as it may sound, it’s very entertaining and most definitely held my attention while I was watching. Even my mother, who doesn’t really like Mr. Bogart, sat down and watched it. Although at times you feel Barbara Stanwyck’s character is completely hopeless (she doesn’t put up any fight, quite weak), that doesn’t mean that you don’t care about what happens to her. You really do, and you feel a sense of triumph as she grabs the gun. I think the ending would have been much better if she actually put up a fight (how I would love to see Stanwyck kicking Bogart in the groin!! Then punching him before saying a witty line). Just my opinion. I would pay to see that!\n\nAnyway, I think The Two Mrs. Carrolls is a very much underrated film. I liked it, it’s quite exciting at times. Nice to see Mr. Bogart playing a different role – the villain. I’m getting this on DVD!\n\nThe 1947 mystery-thriller,”The Two Mrs.Carrolls”is considered by many critics to be a tepid,unrealistic film and one of Humphrey Bogart’s lesser works. This couldn’t be more false. The film contains brilliant performances by Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck,a great deal of eerie suspense,and delicious bits of English humor. The plot of the film is similar to that of Alfred Hitchcock’s “Dial M for Murder” and “Suspicion”,but has a uniqueness all it’s own. It tells the story of Geoffrey Carroll(Bogart),a struggling artist who marries a wealthy woman,Sally(Stanwyck), after his supposed invalid wife dies. Life is normal for them,until Sally begins to feel ill and restless quite often.A doctor says she’s suffering from nothing more than a nerve condition,and she believes that’s all it is. She is, unfortunately, in for a big surprise.She learns from Geoffrey’s precocious,young daughter,Bea(Ann Carter),some things about his previous wife.For starters,she was not an invalid and only got sick the last few weeks of her life.Geoffrey gave her milk at night to make her feel relaxed.This is exactly what he does for Sally.She also learns that a painting of his former wife,called “The Angel of Death”,was done while she was sick. Hearing this,Sally comes to the realization that she is Geoffrey’s next victim of a well-planned crime.Stanwyck has never been better as a panic-stricken wife,trying to survive her husband’s evil doings.Bogart gives a highly underrated performance as a psychopath,who gets brutal when his murder plot doesn’t go according to plan.His presence on screen is often frightening.The ending is wonderfully witty and comical.While not in the same league as “The Maltese Falcon”or “Key Largo”,this is still a highly entertaining Bogart film,that will not disappoint. I give it a strong 8 1/2 out of 10.\n\nOf all the Humphery Bogart movies I have seen, The Two Mrs Carrolls proved he could make a good, creepy villain.\n\nAfter the death of his first wife by poisoning her with milk he had spiked, Bogie, who plays a psychopathic artist meets another woman and marries her and he intends to do the same with her as he is having an affair with someone else. The second Mrs Carroll gradually gets suspicious of his behaviour and eventually finds out what he did to his first wife and manages to call the police. She refuses to drink a glass of milk he gives her and the police then arrive and he is arrested at the end, keeping calm despite this.\n\nAlthough Bogie only appeared in one horror movie, The Return of Doctor X, The Two Mrs Carrolls certainly has horror elements.\n\nJoining Bogie in the cast are Barbara Stanwyck, Dr Watson himself Nigel Bruce (appropiantly as a doctor and a very similar role to Watson too) and Alexis Smith. Excellent parts from all.\n\nThe Two Mrs Carrolls is a must for all Bogie fans and is certainly worth the £1.50 I paid for it. Excellent stuff.\n\nRating: 4 stars out of 5.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe Two Mrs. Carrolls did very poorly at the box office. The film also received generally poor reviews in the United States upon its release. Reviewers in the British press found the movie’s “quaint old English” atmosphere over the top and amusing.\n\nModern reviewers tend to be highly critical of the film, although some find redeeming elements in it. Stanwyck biographer Dan Callahan, writing in 2012, called the film a “dreadful adaptation of a derivative stage thriller” and far too similar to Alfred Hitchcock‘s Suspicion (1941). He found that Peter Godfrey’s direction exhibited “a whole new level of miscalculation and incompetence”, and had a very low opinion of the acting. Stanwyck, he concluded, was incongruously chipper early in the film, while giving a stilted, distracted performance in the second half. Bogart was “embarrassing” with his over-acted insanity, Nigel Bruce turned in a similarly hammy performance, and Ann Carter’s adult-sounding dialogue was delivered with “lugubrious” slowness.Stanwyck biographer Axel Madsen’s 2001 assessment of the film was similarly poor. He believed that Godfrey indulged Bogart as a director, “letting [him] mug outrageously”He though both Bogart and Stanwyck were miscast, and felt the script undermined any suspense in the plot by repeatedly alluding to Bogart’s madness. Film reviewer Barry Monush felt the script gave Alexis Smith so little to do that casting her hardly seemed worth it. Film biographer David Quinlan, writing in 1983, concluded that the film’s fundamental flaws extended from Godfrey’s shortcomings as a director and the miscasting of Bogart as an insane wife-killer."
