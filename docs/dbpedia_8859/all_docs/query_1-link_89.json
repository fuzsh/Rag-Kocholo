        "text": "This article analyzes the role and place of Amir Temur in the history of Azerbaijan. Amir Temur made a trip to Azerbaijan as a result of which it became part of the empire of Amir Temur.Amir Temur actively defended Shirvanshakhs, gave him more land for management. During Temur, the most peaceful life in Azerbaijan was and a number of structures were built. Baylakon city is newly built. Temur's army completely built the city in one month. They also dug up a large Nakhri Barlos canal. Despite the fact that Tokhtamysh with the help of Temur came to the throne, he raided Azerbaijan and claimed Iran. The article analyzes those events.We can say that Azerbaijan expanded and flourished during Amir Temur.\n\nThis study focuses on the importance of coinage as the only contemporaneous historical document to show the changes of the political relationships of the Salghurids under the overlordship of the Ilkhans.1 The coins’ legends are in four languages—Arabic, Persian, Uighur and Chinese—and they reveal the varieties of titles which reflect the position of the Salghurids within the hierarchy of the Mongol empire. The coinage of Fārs during the reign of the Salghurids presents an untapped historical source for its shifting alliances and relations with the Great Khāns and the Ilkhāns, as the coins were circulated for both regional money and as Ilkhan money. This study divides the relevant period into two main sections. The first, before Abish Khātūn’s reign, includes the reign of Abū Bakr ibn Saʻd (r. 623–658/1226–1260) and his grandson Muḥammad ibn Saʻd (r. 658–661/1258–1261). In the second section, during the reign of Abish Khātūn, six phases can be distinguished showing Abish’s position as ruler changing over time. The most important phase was when Abish Khātūn ruled as autonomous governor under the suzerainty of the Great Khāqān without any intermediary control of the Ilkhān. Then she was sent to the Mongol court in Qara Qorum, and Shīrāz was administered by a Mongol governor appointed by the Khāqān, but remained nominally a principality of Abish Khātūn as vassal of the Great Khāqān. This meant Abish Khātūn’s position within the hierarchy of the Mongol empire was formally at the same rank as the Ilkhān. Later she had to acknowledge the Ilkhān as overlord. These periods were reflected in the coin protocol as the only primary source, which provides extensive data, not just for the capital cities, such as Shīrāz, but also for a number of provincial and district towns, which served as mints for the Salghurids."
