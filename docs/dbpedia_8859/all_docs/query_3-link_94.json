        "text": "This article is about the founder of the Ilkhanate. For the head of the Chagatai khanate, please see Qara Hülëgü\n\nHulagu Khan, also known as Hülegü, Hulegu (Mongolian: Hülegü Khaan, \"Warrior\"; Mongolian Cyrillic: Хүлэг хаан; Turkish: Hülagû Han; Chagatai/Urdu: ہلاکو Hulaku; Arabicهولاكو خان/ هَلَاوُن ; Chinese language: 旭烈兀; c. 1218 – 8 February 1265), was a Mongol ruler who conquered much of Southwest Asia. Son of Tolui and the Kerait princess Sorghaghtani Beki, he was a grandson of Genghis Khan, and the brother of Ariq Böke, Möngke Khan and Kublai Khan. Hulagu's army greatly expanded the southwestern portion of the Mongol Empire, founding the Ilkhanate of Persia, a precursor to the eventual Safavid dynasty, and then the modern state of Iran. Under Hulagu's leadership, the Mongols destroyed the greatest center of Islamic power, Baghdad, and also weakened Damascus, causing a shift of Islamic influence to the Mamluks in Cairo.\n\nBackground[]\n\nHulagu was born to Tolui, one of Genghis Khan's sons, and Sorghaghtani Beki, an influential Kerait princess. Sorghaghtani successfully navigated Mongol politics, arranging for all of her sons to become Mongol leaders. She was a Nestorian Christian, and Hulagu was friendly to Christianity. Hulagu's favorite wife, Dokuz Khatun, was also a Christian, as was his closest friend and general, Kitbuqa. It is recorded however that he was a Buddhist[1] as he neared his death, against the will of Dokuz Khatun.[2]\n\nHulagu had at least three children: Abaqa, Teguder Ahmad, and Taraqai. Abaqa was second Ilkhan of Persia from 1265–1282, Teguder Ahmad was third Ilkhan from 1282–1284, and Taraqai's son Baydu became Ilkhan in 1295.[3] Mirkhond mentions two more children, given as Hyaxemet and Tandon in an early translation; Hyaxemet initially served as governor of Armenia and Azerbaijan, whereas Tandon was given Dyarbekir and Iraq.[4] The order of birth is listed as Abaqa, then Hyaxemet, then Tandon, and then Teguder and Taraqai.\n\nMilitary campaigns[]\n\nHulagu's brother Möngke had been installed as Great Khan in 1251. In 1255, Möngke charged Hulagu with leading a massive Mongol army to conquer or destroy the remaining Muslim states in southwestern Asia. Hulagu's campaign sought the subjugation of the Lurs of southern Iran, the destruction of the Hashshashin sect, the submission or destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad, the submission or destruction of the Ayyubid states in Syria based in Damascus, and finally, the submission or destruction of the Bahri Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt.[5] Möngke ordered Hulagu to treat kindly those who submitted, and utterly destroy those who did not. Hulagu vigorously carried out the latter part of these instructions.\n\nHulagu marched out with perhaps the largest Mongol army ever assembled – by order of Möngke, two tenths of the empire's fighting men were gathered for Hulagu's army.[6] He easily destroyed the Lurs, and the Assassins (the Hashshashin) surrendered their impregnable fortress of Alamut without a fight, accepting a deal that spared the lives of their people.\n\nSiege of Baghdad[]\n\nMain article: Siege of Baghdad (1258)\n\nHulagu's Mongol army set out for Baghdad in November 1257. Once near the city he divided the forces to threaten both sides of the city, on both the east and west banks of the Tigris. Hulagu demanded surrender but the caliph, Al-Musta'sim, refused. The caliph's army repulsed some of the forces attacking from the west but were defeated in the next battle. The attacking Mongols broke dikes and flooded the ground behind the caliph's army, trapping them. Much of the army was slaughtered or drowned.\n\nThe Mongols under Chinese general Guo Kan laid siege to the city on January 29, 1258,[7] constructing a palisade and a ditch and wheeling up siege engines and catapults. The battle was short by siege standards. By February 5 the Mongols controlled a stretch of the wall. The caliph tried to negotiate but was refused. On February 10 Baghdad surrendered. The Mongols swept into the city on February 13 and began a week of destruction.\n\nThe Grand Library of Baghdad, containing countless precious historical documents and books on subjects ranging from medicine to astronomy, was destroyed. Survivors said that the waters of the Tigris ran black with ink from the enormous quantity of books flung into the river. Citizens attempted to flee but were intercepted by Mongol soldiers.\n\nDeath counts vary widely and cannot be easily substantiated. A low estimate of the number of deaths is about 90,000 (Sicker 2000, p. 111). Higher estimates range from 200,000 to a million.[8] The Mongols looted and then destroyed. Mosques, palaces, libraries, hospitals — grand buildings that had been the work of generations were burned to the ground. The caliph was captured and forced to watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury plundered.\n\nIn the Il Milione, the book that covers the travels of Marco Polo, a Venetian merchant, it is stated that Hulagu starved the caliph to death, but there is no corroborating evidence for that. Most historians believe the Mongol and Muslim accounts that the caliph was rolled up in a rug and the Mongols rode their horses over him, as they believed that the earth was offended if touched by royal blood. All but one of his sons were killed. Baghdad was a depopulated, ruined city for several centuries. Smaller states in the region hastened to reassure Hulagu of their loyalty and the Mongols turned to Syria in 1259, conquering the Ayyubids and sending advance patrols as far ahead as Gaza.\n\nOne thousand northern Chinese engineer squads accompanied the Mongol Khan Hulagu during his conquest of the Middle East.[9][10]\n\nConquest of Syria (1260)[]\n\nSee also: Mongol raids into Palestine\n\nIn 1260 Mongol forces combined with those of their Christian vassals in the region, including the army of Cilician Armenia under Hetoum I and the Franks of Bohemond VI of Antioch. This force conquered Muslim Syria, a domain of the Ayyubid dynasty. They took the city of Aleppo and, under the Christian general Kitbuqa, also took Damascus on March 1, 1260 .[11][12][13] A Christian Mass was celebrated in the Grand Mosque of the Umayyads and numerous mosques were profaned. Many historical accounts describe the three Christian rulers (Hetoum, Bohemond, and Kitbuqa) entering the city of Damascus together in triumph,[13][14] though some modern historians such as David Morgan have questioned this story as apocryphal.[15]\n\nThe invasion effectively destroyed the Ayyubid Dynasty, theretofore powerful ruler of large parts of the Levant, Egypt, and Arabia. The last Ayyubid king An-Nasir Yusuf was killed by Hulagu in 1260.[16] With the Islamic power center of Baghdad gone and Damascus weakened, the center of Islamic power transferred to the Egyptian Mamluks in Cairo.\n\nHulagu's intent was to continue south through Palestine towards Cairo to engage the Mamluks. He sent a threatening letter to Qutoz, the great leader of Egypt, in Cairo. He asked Qutoz to open Cairo or it will be destroyed like Baghdad. Qutoz, who was a very religious commander, refused, killed Holagho messengers and assembled his army. Instead of waiting for the Mongol to come, he went out to them, and met them in northern Palestine at Ayn Jallut. The Mongol were about 100,000 and the Muslims were about 60,000 soldiers. The battle lasted for three days, after which the Mongol army saw, for the first time in its history, a devastating defeat where their second in command was killed, while Holagho escaped. Qutoz chased the Mongol army out of Damascus, Syria, and Baghdad. After the defeat at Ayn Jallut, the Mongol never dared to come back, and their tide started to secede. Ayn Jallut was the turning point in the Mongol empire, that lasted about 100 years of invasion and destruction, and no traces of civilization or building were left by them.\n\nBattle of Ayn Jalut (1260)[]\n\nMain article: Battle of Ayn Jalut\n\nThe Crusaders, traditional enemies of the Mamluks, regarded the Mongols as the allies. The Christians joined forces with the Mongols, but the Muslims defeated both of them. After a three-day battle, the Egyptian Muslim army commanded by Qutoz defeated the Mongol army of 100,000 soldiers at the Battle of Ayn Jalut. The Muslim Egyptian Mamluks achieved a decisive victory, Kitbuqa was executed, while Holagho escaped. The battle of Ayn Jalut established a high-water mark for the Mongol conquest. The Mongol invasion east and south came to a stop after Ayn Jallut. The Muslim army chased the Mongol out of Syria and Baghdad, and later on kicked the remnant of the Crusaders out of Lebanon. In previous defeats the Mongols had returned to re-take the territory, but they never did so after Ayn Jalut, since it was the first time they faced a serious fight after the Khwarizmi wars.\n\nLater campaigns[]\n\nSee also: Berke–Hulagu war\n\nHulagu returned to his lands by 1262, after the succession was finally settled with his brother Kublai Khan established as Great Khan. But when Hulagu massed his armies to attack the Mamluks and avenge the defeat at Ain Jalut, he was instead drawn into civil war with Batu Khan's brother Berke. Berke Khan, a Muslim convert, had promised retribution in his rage after Hulagu's sack of Baghdad, and allied himself with the Mamluks. He initiated a series of raids on Hulagu's territories, led by Nogai Khan. Hulagu suffered a severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the Caucasus in 1263. This was the first open war between Mongols, and signaled the end of the unified empire.\n\nCommunications with Europe[]\n\nSee also: Franco-Mongol alliance\n\nHulagu sent multiple communications to Europe in an attempt to establish a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Muslims. In 1262, he sent his secretary Rychaldus and an embassy to \"all kings and princes overseas\". The embassy was apparently intercepted in Sicily by King Manfred, who was allied with the Mamluks and in conflict with Pope Urban IV, and Rychaldus was returned by ship.[17]\n\nOn April 10, 1262, Hulagu sent a letter, through John the Hungarian, to the French king Louis IX, offering an alliance.[18] It is unclear whether the letter ever reached Louis IX in Paris—the only manuscript known to have survived was in Vienna, Austria.[19] The letter stated Hulagu's intention to capture Jerusalem for the benefit of the Pope and asked for Louis to send a fleet against Egypt:\n\n\"From the head of the Mongol army, avid to devastate the perfidious nation of the Sarasins, good-willing support of the Christian faith (...) so that you, who are the rulers of the coasts on the other side of the sea, endeavor to deny a refuge for the Infidels, your enemies and ours, by having your subjects diligently patrol the seas.\"\n\n—Letter from Hulagu to Saint Louis.[20]\n\nDespite many attempts, neither Hulagu nor his successors were able to form an alliance with Europe, although the 13th century saw a vogue of Mongol culture in the West. Many new-born children in Italy were named after Mongol rulers, including Hulagu: names such as Can Grande (\"Great Khan\"), Alaone (Hulagu), Argone (Arghun) or Cassano (Ghazan) are recorded.[21]\n\nDeath[]\n\nHulagu Khan died in 1265 and was buried in the Shahi Island in Lake Urmia. His funeral was the only Ilkhanate funeral to feature human sacrifice.[22] He was succeeded by his son Abaqa, thus establishing his line.\n\nLegacy[]\n\nHulagu Khan laid the foundations of the Ilkhanate State, and by doing so paved the way for the later Safavid dynastic state, and ultimately the modern country of Iran. Hulagu's conquests also opened Iran to both European influence from the west and Chinese influence from the east. This, combined with patronage from his successors, would develop Iran's distinctive excellence in architecture. Under Hulagu's dynasty, Iranian historians also moved from writing in Arabic, to writing in Persian.[25]\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nBoyle, J.A., (Editor).
