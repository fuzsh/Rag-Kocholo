        "text": "Size\n\nThe new map (Figure 4) confirms our initial hypothesis that the city stretched far beyond the areas documented since the 1930s. In this respect, Radloff's early map remained the most accurate, until now, and was thus a remarkable achievement. Due to time and access constraints, we were unable to ascertain fully the northern, eastern and south-eastern extent of the settlement. The inundation area of the Orkhon River sets a natural limit in the north-west and west. The area south of the monastery of Erdene Zuu, which was surveyed by the pedestrian crew, appears to be void of structures built during the time of the Mongol Empire. The survey did not yield any sites except for sherd scatters, which is unsurprising given the close proximity of the city. Satellite imagery, however, confirms that some of the features mapped by Radloff in 1891 remain visible today (Figure 4). We were able to identify single platforms shown by Radloff, but heavy ploughing activities have destroyed and flattened features once visible above ground. Taking these observations together, we were unable to estimate how densely these areas had been settled and when the occupation declined. The distribution of sites suggests intensive use of the surrounding areas during the Mongol era. This distribution extended as far as the eastern foothills—approximately 7–8km as the crow flies from the eastern gate—and demonstrates an absence of clear city boundaries (Figure 3). We documented 259 sites that cover several periods, 222 of which are artefact scatters and 61.3 per cent of which date to the Mongol period.\n\nExcavations between 1978 and 1980 identified a Muslim cemetery adjoining the northern outer wall of the city (Bayar & Voitov Reference Bayar, Voitov, Bemmann, Erdenebat and Pohl2010). This 0.3km2 area was surrounded by compounds featuring inner platforms similar to those inside the walls, which were probably residential areas and not part of the cemetery. By breaking the city into its component parts based on the volume of settlement layers and building characteristics—which seemed to be correlated—we obtained a differentiated picture of its spatial configuration (cf. Table 1 and Figure 5). The palimpsest of the remains of 200 years of occupation, however, hindered interpretation. Further excavations are needed to determine the temporal scale and trajectories of the use of the different parts of Karakorum.\n\nThe walled area of Karakorum comprised 1.33km2, only 60 per cent of which was built up. Areas within the northern part were notably devoid of definite buildings, being characterised by low walls that did not form typically rectangular ramparts. These areas were also conspicuously poor in surface finds, and the surface was covered with Orkhon gravel, rather than a cultural layer that was present (to varying degrees) in the built-up area. In this case, we have no grounds to suspect the area to be less well preserved. We would argue instead that these areas were not used as permanent campsites, although temporary occupation cannot be excluded.\n\nThe central parts of the city were distinguished by large volumes of settlement layers. These account for 13 per cent of the walled area, and are covered with a different type of vegetation, namely Achnatherum splendens (Trin.) Nevski. This grass favours loamy soils and therefore functions as an indicator of underlying brick-built structures. These thick layers were surrounded by areas of lower settlement volume, indicated by layers that were comparatively less thick. Both areas were difficult to subdivide into distinct building features. Some compounds containing distinct buildings partly overlay these otherwise undifferentiated areas, but were mostly confined to the southern area, between the thicker settlement layers and the monastery.\n\nWe delimited the external settlement area by outlining all built structures beyond the city wall. This area extended over 11.8km2 and was much less densely built-up than the walled area (at about 11 per cent). If burial areas are subtracted, this decreases to approximately 8 per cent. These empty areas may have been used for temporary camps during social gatherings, such as quriltais (assemblies of the ruling elite).\n\nDensity and thickness of settlement layers\n\nIn the northern parts of the walled area, the ground surface is characterised by Orkhon River gravel. Excavations showed that buildings were not set into the ground, but rather, were erected on the alluvial fan of the river. These observations allow us to level the absolute value and the long-wave slope of the topographic measurement data to zero and then calculate the volume of the raised, anthropogenic structures. The levelling of the topographic data was carried out by means of a set of nodes sampled at the minima of the whole measured terrain. The sampling raster, however, was not equidistant due to regions of high building density (such as the city centre) that prevented meaningful sampling. From the set of nodes, a terrain model of the fluvial gravel was gridded using the Kriging algorithm. Finally, the absolute topographic map was reduced by the calculated model. The resulting levelled map (Figure 6) sharpens the focus on the hidden building remains and the design of Karakorum.\n\nUsing this calculation, we find the largest volume of settlement layers lay within the geographical centre of the walled city area, confirming the findings of the early twenty-first-century excavations. Here, the rate of building renewal, combined with the levelling of previous buildings and the concurrent accumulation of settlement layers, was particularly high (see Reichert Reference Reichert2019). In contrast, the areas extending concentrically outwards from the centre demonstrate much less volume, as attested by less accumulated cultural material.\n\nThere are several variables responsible for the accumulation of the settlement layers, including time (duration of use, seasonality), practices of waste disposal (on-site, off-site), building techniques (differences in material, quality), intensity of use and practices of caretaking (or lack thereof). As we are unable to control for all of these variables in the unexcavated areas, we cannot use accumulated settlement volume as a proxy for duration of occupation.\n\nAccess routes to the city and streets\n\nIn 1254, William of Rubruck noted that the enclosed city had four gates, outside each of which regional goods—especially livestock—were traded (Jackson & Morgan Reference Jackson and Morgan1990: 221). The densely built-up area outside the east gate and the two streets leading to it, which were identified by Radloff (Reference Radloff1892) and Kato (Reference Kato1997), indicate this to be the most frequently used point of access (Figure 7). By combining Radloff's map with modern satellite images and our own measurements, we are able to trace the road leading from the east gate for approximately 3km; both sides were lined by buildings, over long stretches. A second road leading from the east gate heads east-northeast and can be traced in the satellite image to a loop of the Khögshiin Orkhon River, although doubts remain about its exact course due to interference by modern agriculture and the lack of survey opportunities. An unexpected finding was a second road to the east—a section of which had previously been mapped by Radloff—that passed through the city wall at the north-east corner of the palace (today the monastery), and which possibly served the palace district. The two eastern access roads merge to the south-east of the modern agrarian cooperative and head towards China.\n\nTwo paths also leave the northern gate. One of these, which is partly disturbed by the modern cemetery, leads to the north-west, where it forks. Its western branch ends at an ancient Orkhon River loop. The other branch heads almost directly north, bisecting the Muslim cemetery and passing a large compound featuring a high, substantial platform to the east, before disappearing in modern farmland. This road probably led to Ogii Nuur, a lake approximately 60km to the north (as does the modern tarmac road), where it joined a well-known west–east route mentioned in contemporaneous documentary sources (Bretschneider Reference Bretschneider1967: 54–55).\n\nTwo paths lead from the west gate and terminate at an ancient tributary of the Orkhon; there was possibly a ford here. Since no constructions for water supply have yet been discovered in the city, water from the river was probably transported into Karakorum on carts, in storage vessels or leather bags.\n\nA southern access point to the city has not yet been identified. It is likely that a path at the south-west corner of the enclosed Buddhist temple district ran along the southern wall of the complex. Since the western rampart did not reach the north-west corner of the modern monastery, the topography of the city, as seen today, suggests a wide entrance but, unlike with the other three gates, there is no path leading from this putative entrance into the city. Another possibility is that the southern entrance to the palace area was considered to be the southern gate. Juvaini (1226–1283), a Persian historiographer, reported that the palace area had four gates: “one for the passage of the World-Ruling Emperor, another for his children and kinsmen, another again for the princesses, and a fourth for the entrance and egress of the populace” (Boyle Reference Boyle1958: 236). This would have excluded public access to the city through the palace complex. A further possibility is that the southern part of the city wall may have run to the north of the lake surveyed by Radloff, terminating at the north-east corner of the modern monastery wall. This is supported by the fact that a strip to the north of the Erdene Zuu monastery remained undeveloped, and paths from the west, north and east join at this point. The fork in the southern road is 118m north of the Erdene Zuu monastery wall, so the southern gate may have been in this location. Furthermore, it is possible that the artificial pond (Figure 1) destroyed the older wall and the gate. If, however, the access road continued into the city, only this final option makes sense.\n\nInside the gates, the paths forked again. In contrast to previous research, which noted only a single, large road junction (Kiselev Reference Kiselev1965), bundles of paths can now be seen, especially in the magnetic survey (Figure 8). Five intersections can be identified along the north-northeast to south-southwest main road, with roads crossing from west-northwest to east-southeast. Only a small section of the southern road has been investigated, and was found to be 5.6m wide and paved with slate slabs. The courses of the roads from the city centre leading to the west and south are less defined and comprise fewer streets, which further underlines the importance of access to the city from the east and north (see Figure 7).\n\nClose examination of the magnetic representations from two segments of the main road—Sections A and B—between the east gate and the city centre reveals significant differences in the signal magnitudes and behaviours (Figure 9; locations shown in Figure 8b). In many cases, the road courses are defined by strong magnetic signatures that flank the road on both sides (Figures 8b and 9: Section A). These signals may arise from the construction of road edges or kerbs, or from the walls of buildings. High gradiometer signal magnitudes of up to 80nT/m indicate the use of fired bricks in construction. By contrast, only small magnitudes are detectable along the road surfaces. Sedimentary stone pavements—especially at a depth of several metres—may not produce strong magnetic signatures, although such signatures can be found approximately 400m to the east (Figures 8b and 9: Section B). Within the first 30m of Section B, high magnitudes occur within the middle of the road, suggesting that a different paving material or road filling was used here, even though the thinner sediment coverage compared with Section A (closer to the city centre) generally produces stronger signatures. Analysis of the surrounding building signatures provides a possible explanation. South of the road in Section B, an impressive complex can be identified within the wide-amplitude scaled magnetogram (Figure 10c). This probably represents a craft area with technical constructions, such as small ovens, used for metalworking. The stronger magnetic signals within the road area of Section B may have been caused by material debris from these activities."
