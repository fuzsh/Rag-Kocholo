        "text": "Cities within a steppe environment and in societies based on pastoral nomadism are an often overlooked theme in the anthro-pological literature. Yet, with Karakorum, the first capital of the Mongol Empire (AD 1206-1368), we have a supreme example of such a city in the central landscape of the Orkhon valley in Mongolia. In this paper, we ask, what is the city in the steppes? Taking Karakorum as our starting point and case of reference and to attain a better comprehension of the characteristics of urbanism in the steppe, we apply a list of urban attributes compiled by Michael E. Smith (2016) to provide a thick description of Karakorum. The discussion not only comprises comparisons to other contemporary sites in Russia and Mongolia, but also addresses in detail the question of city-hinterland relations as a fundamental necessity for the survival of the city in an anti-urban environment. The analysis shows that during the Mongol period we can identify urbanism but no urbanization: there is no process of independent, natural growth of cities carried out by the population, but cities are \"political\" in the sense that they are deeply intertwined with the authority and have therefore much to tell about the relation between power and authority on the one hand and the ruled on the other.

Erecting a city from scratch is even less typical. However, Khar Khul Khaany Balgas, situated north of the Khangai Mountains in central Mongolia, is such an exceptional example, never built over by subsequent settlements. Overlooked until now because researchers dated its latest settlement phase into the 17th century A.D., the first radiocarbon dates and material culture prove its existence during the Mongol empire only. During the past years, we conducted comprehensive geophysical and topographic mapping of the site, as well as a pedestrian survey, including its hinterland, and excavated a kiln. The layout of the city resembles that of the capital, Karakorum. Both cities together reveal that the Mongol Khans had a specific idea about the organization of a city. They were dependent on Chinese craftsmen to erect the buildings but not on Chinese city planning and ideology.

Outlining the patterns of construction, maintenance, and reconstruction of earthen architecture, I consider how the Mongol conquests would have impacted the urban occupation of cities that relied on this building material with a focus on examples from Merv, Turkmenistan, and Otrar, Kazakhstan. Given the need for continuous maintenance to mudbrick architecture to prevent decay, and the difficulties of reversing this process once it has begun, I argue that depopulation resulting from the Mongol conquest campaigns would have impacted the urban fabric more significantly than any deliberate demolition by invading Mongol armies. Based on archaeological analysis, I discuss the practicalities and difficulties of reusing mud as a building material to show that the abandonment of buildings and cities can be a conscious, pragmatic response to erosion or a shifting water supply rather than a catastrophic event. I conclude that thirteenth-century accounts describing the urban devastation and demolition of Central Asian cities should be reconsidered to include the collateral impact of the flight of populations and environmental change, as evidenced in the archaeological record. https://doi.org/10.1386/ijia_00118_1\n\nThe article covers the main points of the town-planning history of Karasubazar, the city of the Crimean khanate, and, most importantly, offers a graphic reconstruction of its master plan for the last quarter of the 18th century, the final stage of the state’s existence. Reconstruction of the historical topography of the late medieval city was carried out for the first time on the basis of three types of sources – written, cartographic, and archaeological. All the basic elements of the city’s historical topography as well as the plan of quarterly residential development and a network of streets are reconstructed. Characteristic features of the location of the quarters inhabited by the Greek, Armenian and Jewish population among the main population of the Tatar inhabitants are revealed. City mosques, bathhouses, fountains supplying the citizens with water, hotels-caravanserais, shopping malls, and production workshops are localized. It is found out that Karasubazar was the second larg...\n\nThis paper describes archaeological investigation of occupation dating to approximately the 12th-15th centuries AD at the site of Otrar in southern Kazakhstan. It primarily summarises excavation and survey carried out in the summer and autumn of 2021, which aimed to investigate the city’s economic, urban and environmental state in the decades preceding the Mongol Conquest of 1219/20 and the changes which occurred over the following two centuries. Focussing on test trenches dug in the shahristan and industrial areas as well as investigation of the defensive walls around the raised shahristan and lower rabad area, evidence for urban change and continuity was characterised and dated where possible. Initial data suggests that a defensive wall was constructed around the rabad in approximately the 11th or early 12th century. Renovation and conservation work provided the opportunity to study the shahristan wall which likely dates to the 14th century. This wall was repeatedly replastered, but probably represents the last major refortification of the city. Excavations in the shahristan revealed a period of non-architectural occupation or partial abandonment before a reoccupation in the 14th century, which may approximately coincide with renovation of the walls of the shahristan. The preliminary work described here hints at interesting changes in investment and occupation at the city between the 11th and 15th centuries by targeting data from across the site and taking advantage of extensive previous excavation. It forms part of our effort to quantify and describe changes in urban occupation at Otrar, forming a basis to investigate their causes.\n\nThe Orkhon Valley, perhaps more than any other region, is suitable as a research area to investigate in detail the phenomenon of the emergence and foundation of capitals – fixed points in otherwise nomadic cultures. What does settling mean and does this frequently-used term actually describe the new processes found there at that time? According to legend, Karakorum was founded in 1220 as the first capital of Genghis Khan’s Mongol Empire and, even today, it remains anchored in Mongolian national understanding as a place of extraordinary significance. Time and again, including recent examples, there have been discussions about relocating the capital to this location. Because of the many years of archaeological research by the KAAK, under the leadership of Hans-Georg Hüttel until 2011, and the comprehensive inspection of written sources, a more precise picture of life in the one-time steppe metropolis has been gathered. The Franciscan monk, William of Rubruck, spent several months in the city in 1254 and provided an exceptionally lively description of medieval life in Karakorum. He reports on the Saracen Quarter and the North-Chinese Quarter, in which permanent houses had been built, describes the palace district and mentions \"idolatric temples of the different nations\".\n\nThis paper introduces the phenomenon of urbanism in the context of the medieval empires of the steppe from a historical-archaeological perspective. Several of the Inner Asian empires that emerged from predominantly nomadic societies developed some degree of urbanization. However, it seems inappropriate to regard this as a transition from nomadic to sedentary societies. On the contrary, we argue that the cities of these polities represent a specific type of urbanism that could only exist in this form in a nomad environment and served to facilitate interactions between the nomad elites and their often-sedentary subjects, allies and enemies. In this paper we present some of the archaeological evidence from two of these sites: Karabalgasun, the Uyghur capital from around 745 until 840 and Karakorum, which was allegedly founded 1220 by Genghis Khan and came to be known as capital of the Mongol Empire. In the comparison of the archaeological remains and the representation of these sites in the written sources of different cultures lie the hints that provide an insight into the purposes these cities served for their builders 1 ."
