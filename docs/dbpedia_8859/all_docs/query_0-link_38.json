        "meta_description": "Naseer al-Din (or al-Naseer) al-Tusi (1201--74 AD, 597--672 AH) was a Muslim Persian polymath. He was born in Tus, Khorasan, in present-day Iran. Al-Tusi witnessed the great invasion of the Islamic world by the Mongols, whom he later joined. He was said to have been in the company of Hulegu Khan when the latter destroyed the Abbasid capital of Baghdad in 1258 AD. Al-Tusi, already a well-known scientist, later convinced Hulegu Khan to construct an observatory to facilitate the establishment of accurate astronomical tables for better astrological predictions. Construction of the Rasad Khaneh observatory began in 1259 in Azerbaijan, west of Maragheh, the capital of the Ilkhanate Empire. Based on the observations made there, al-Tusi constructed very accurate tables of planetary movements. This work is the first of two volumes that contains a collection of seven treatises by al-Tusi on works by Greek astronomers and mathematicians: On the Book \"Data\" by Euclid; On the Book \"Spherics\" by Theodosius; On the Book \"On the Moving Sphere\" by Autolycus; On the Book \"On Habitations\" by Theodosius; On the Book \"Optica\" by Euclid; On the Book \"Phenomena\" by Euclid; and On the Book \"On Days and Nights\" by Theodosius. The first printed edition shown here was published in Hyderabad, present-day Pakistan, in 1939--40 (1358 AH).",
