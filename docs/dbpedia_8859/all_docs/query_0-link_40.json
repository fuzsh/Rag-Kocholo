        "meta_description": "Naseer al-Din (or al-Naseer) al-Tusi (1201--74 AD, 597--672 AH) was a Muslim Persian polymath. He was born in Tus, Khorasan, in present-day Iran. Al-Tusi witnessed the great invasion of the Islamic empire by the Mongols, whom he later joined. He was said to have been in the company of Hulegu Khan when the latter destroyed the Abbasid capital of Baghdad in 1258 AD. Al-Tusi, already a well-known scientist, later convinced Hulegu Khan to construct an observatory to facilitate the establishment of accurate astronomical tables for better astrological predictions. Beginning in 1259, the Rasad Khaneh observatory was built in Azerbaijan, west of Maragheh, the capital of the Ilkhanate Empire. Based on the observations made in that observatory, al-Tusi constructed very accurate tables of planetary movements. This work consists of six essays from al-Tusi's book Kitab usul al-hindasa wa al-hisab (The book of the origins of geometry and arithmetic, also known as Commentaries on Euclid), an illustrated treatise on the Greek mathematician's work.",
