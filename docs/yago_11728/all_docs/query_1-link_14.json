He was 89.\n\nRankin ran the successful Rankin/Bass production banner with business partner Jules Bass, putting out a many popular cartoon series and specials in a period spanning the early 1960s through to the late 1980s. The pair won a Peabody Award for their work on The Hobbit in 1977.\n\nThe company was a pioneer in the use of stop-motion animation. Their cel-animated features were painstaking to make and known for their doll-like characters such as seen in Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964). Rankin also produced the classic 1980s animated series Thundercats, and worked on its 2011-12 revival as a consulting producer for 11 episodes."
