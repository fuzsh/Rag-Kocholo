After he loses his mother who tried to protect him for the cold and many other events he finds himself at a stable. While there he is chosen to be the donkey that Mary rides on before giving birth to Jesus.\n\nWhen it comes to the narrator of the story, the film follows the narrator theme in the Rankin/Bass Christmas specials. The narrator is a descendent of Nestors' .\n\nThis film comes after the sequel of the Little Drummer Boy. In keeping with the Biblical elements of the Little Drummer Boy, it was also drawing in the same popular elements of Rudolph. In many different ways, from the more literal scene with the cameo form Rudolph or to the story elements themselves. Both characters were ostracized due to their physical appearance, and only when they leave home they are able to find confidence in wo they are. they are also the only ones that can help a notable Christmas figure.\n\nThis film is also the last of the Rankin/Bass Christmas specials to rely on traditional Christmas elements. later films will branch off in different ways. However, they still incorporate Christmas even if the fundamental elements don't have to do with Christmas."
