The film is an adaptation of the 1937 book of the same name by J. R. R. Tolkien, and was first broadcast on NBC in the United States on Sunday, November 27, 1977.\n\nPlot\n\nA Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins lives peacefully in his hobbit-hole. He is visited by Gandalf, who informs him he is looking for someone to share an adventure, and introduces a group of thirteen dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield. They invite themselves into Bilbo's house, eat dinner, and play music. The magic in the music affects Bilbo, making him suddenly long for adventure.\n\nThorin explains Bilbo is to be a lucky number fourteen for them, and tells the story of how the once-prosperous dwarves were driven out of the Lonely Mountain by Smaug, who also stole their treasure. Gandalf accepts the mission before the Hobbit can speak. Bilbo decides not to argue, and departs with Gandalf and the Dwarves the next morning.\n\nThe company discovers a camp of three trolls, who promptly capture all but Gandalf. Gandalf uses his magic to hasten the dawn, and the daylight turns the trolls to stone. In the troll's cave, they discover stolen treasure, including two ancient swords and a dagger.\n\nGandalf shows Thorin a map of Lonely Mountain and a key, given to him by Thorin's father. The map shows a secret passage. When the travelers stay in Rivendell, Elrond discovers letters on the map visible only in moonlight, revealing instructions to find the entrance.\n\nTraveling through the Misty Mountains, the group shelters from a thunderstorm in a cave, and all but Gandalf are captured by goblins. The Great Goblin is slain by Gandalf, and the dwarves flee. Bilbo hits his head and becomes lost; he finds an underground lake, where he discovers a ring, and meets Gollum, who challenges him to a riddle contest. Bilbo wins by a trick, and Gollum goes to get the ring to use against Bilbo. Finding it missing, he suspects Bilbo stole it and hunts him, but Bilbo, having discovered the ring grants invisibility, follows Gollum all the way to the back door, rejoining the dwarves.\n\nThe Goblins pursue the company into a pine forest, setting it ablaze. The Lord of the Eagles rescues them, flying with them to Mirkwood Forest, where Gandalf leaves them. Bilbo is left in charge, and he and the dwarves are captured twice, first by giant spiders (whom Bilbo drives off) and then by the wood elves. Thorin refuses to answer any of the elf king's questions, not wanting to share the treasure. Bilbo uses the ring to pilfer the guard's keys, and floats the dwarves in barrels down the river into Laketown.\n\nThe people of Laketown feed and nurse the company back to health. The fourteen finally make it to the Lonely Mountain, and follow the map's instructions to enter. Bilbo goes in first, and meets Smaug, though he uses the ring to hide. He and Smaug converse, and the dragon assumes Bilbo must be a Laketowner. Bilbo discovers a patch of skin on Smaug not covered by protective scales. When Smaug attacks him for stealing, he escapes, and Smaug flies off to wreak vengeance on Laketown. Bilbo sends a thrush to tell Bard the Bowman about the bare patch, and Bard shoots and kills Smaug. Smaug completely destroys Laketown in his death throes.\n\nThe Dwarves reclaim their treasure, only to find that the Lakemen and the Elves have arrived, wanting recompense for Smaug's damages. Thorin refuses to share, and declares war. Bilbo immediately rebukes him for his nonsensical behavior, as they are outnumbered 14 to thousands, and Thorin in turn insults Bilbo as a coward, nearly ending their friendship. Thorin's cousin Dain arrives with more dwarves, but before the battle can begin, Gandalf arrives and warns all parties the Goblins are coming. The men, elves, and dwarves unite against the common foe, and Bilbo flees as a great battle rages.\n\nMuch later, Bilbo finds a dying Bombur, who informs him the battle has been won. Bilbo learns that only seven of his original thirteen dwarves are left, and is led by Gandalf to Thorin, who is also dying. Thorin and Bilbo say a tearful goodbye, regretting words spoken in anger before. Bilbo returns to Hobbiton with Gandalf, who warns him that the adventure is not over but is only just beginning, thanks to the ring he has found.\n\nBackground\n\nThe film was produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass of Rankin/Bass Productions in New York City, and was adapted for the screen by Romeo Muller, with Rankin taking on the additional duties of production designer. When interviewed for the film, Rankin declared that he would add nothing to the story that wasn't in the original. The New York Times reported that The Hobbit cost $3 million.\n\nIn a 2003 interview, Rankin stated, \"I love the Tolkien work,\" and explained that he was able to make the film because The Hobbit was still in the public domain at the time, despite claims to the contrary from the copyright holders.\n\nThe story's hero, Bilbo Baggins, is voiced by Orson Bean, backed up by noted Hollywood director and actor John Huston as the voice of Gandalf. In supporting roles, the comedian and performance artist Brother Theodore was chosen for the voice of Gollum, and Thurl Ravenscroft performed the baritone singing voices of the goblins. The gravelly voice of the dragon Smaug was provided by Richard Boone, with Hans Conried as Thorin Oakenshield, rounding out the cast of primarily American voice actors. The film was the final Rankin/Bass project to star the Australian actor Cyril Ritchard, here playing the voice of Elrond.\n\nThe Hobbit was animated by Topcraft in Tokyo, a now-defunct Japanese animation studio whose animation team re-formed as Studio Ghibli under Hayao Miyazaki, while some of the animators went to establish Pacific Animation Corporation. Topcraft successfully partnered with Rankin/Bass on several other productions in traditional animation, including 'Twas the Night Before Christmas (1974), The Stingiest Man in Town (1978) and The Last Unicorn (1982). According to Rankin, the visual style of the film took its basic cue from the early illustrations of Arthur Rackham.\n\nWhile Topcraft produced the animation overseas, the concept artwork was completed at the Rankin/Bass studio under the direction of Arthur Rankin. Rhode Island artist Lester Abrams did the initial designs for most of the characters; Rankin had seen Abrams' illustrations to an excerpt from The Hobbit in Children's Digest. Principal artists included coordinating animator Toru Hara; supervising animator/character designer Tsuguyuki Kubo; character and effects animators Hidetoshi Kaneko and Kazuko Ito; and background designer Minoru Nishida. The same studio and crew members were also used for The Return of the King.\n\nHarry N. Abrams published a large, illustrated coffee table edition of the book featuring concept art and stills.\n\nSoundtrack and story LP\n\nJules Bass primarily adapted Tolkien's original lyrics for the film's musical interludes, drawn primarily from the songs that feature prominently in the book. He also assisted Maury Laws, Rankin/Bass's composer and conductor-in-residence, in the composition of an original theme song, \"The Greatest Adventure (The Ballad of the Hobbit)\", sung by Glenn Yarbrough as the sole original song written for the film. This folk ballad came to be associated with Yarbrough, who reprised it in the soundtrack to 1980 animated film The Return of the King.\n\nThe Hobbit first aired as an animated television special in 1977 with the goal of producing an accompanying tie-in storybook and song recordings for children, as in other Rankin/Bass productions.\n\nThe Hobbit was released on LP with the soundtrack and dialogue from the film was also released in 1977 by Disney through its Buena Vista Records label, and an edited version, along with accompanying \"storyteller read-alongs\", was later issued for the Mouse Factory's Disneyland Records imprint. A second music album by Glenn Yarbrough of music \"inspired\" by The Hobbit was also released.\n\nOriginal Soundtrack Songs\n\nThe Hobbit: Original Soundtrack Songs Soundtrack album by\n\nMaury Laws\n\nReleased 1977 Length 26:46 Label Buena Vista Records Producer Rankin/Bass Productions Inc.\n\nSequel\n\nBefore The Hobbit aired on NBC, Rankin/Bass and its partner animation houses were preparing a sequel. Meanwhile, United Artists released J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings in 1978, an animated adaptation directed by Ralph Bakshi, originally intended as the first part in a two-part film.\n\nUnited Artists's sequel having been cancelled after a disagreement with Bakshi, Rankin/Bass proceeded to produce a television installment of The Lord of the Rings, bringing back most of the animation team and voice cast. Taking elements from the last volume of The Lord of the Rings which had not been used by Bakshi, they developed the musical The Return of the King. They were unable to provide continuity for the missing segments, developing instead a framing device in which both films begin and end with Bilbo's stay at Rivendell, connecting the later film directly to the better-received Hobbit.\n\nVoices\n\nOrson Bean – Bilbo Baggins\n\nRichard Boone – Smaug\n\nHans Conried – Thorin Oakenshield\n\nJohn Huston – Gandalf / Narrator\n\nOtto Preminger – The Elvenking\n\nCyril Ritchard – Elrond\n\nBrother Theodore – Gollum\n\nPaul Frees – Bombur, Troll #1\n\nJack DeLeon – Dwalin, Fíli, Kíli, Óin, Glóin, Ori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, Troll #2\n\nDon Messick – Balin, Goblin, Lord of the Eagles, Troll #3\n\nJohn Stephenson – Dori, Bard, Great Goblin\n\nGlenn Yarbrough – The Balladeer\n\nThurl Ravenscroft – Goblin (singing voice), Background voice\n\nCrew\n\nProducers/Directors – Arthur Rankin Jr., Jules Bass\n\nWriter – Romeo Muller\n\nBased on \"The Hobbit\" – J.
