The teleplay won a Peabody Award; the film received a Christopher Award.\n\nThe New York Times found the film \"curiously eclectic\", but felt that whatever its failings, it warranted attention.[2] The Tolkien scholar Douglas A. Anderson called the adaptation \"execrable\";[3] the author Baird Searles called it an \"abomination\" and an attempt that had \"failed miserably\", regretting the quality of the animation and of the soundtrack, and the omission of key plot points.[4]"
