        "text": "Today I am reviewing the greatest Tolkien screen adaptation of the twentieth century (not that there’s much competition…) and what remains the best screen adaptation of the book in question.\n\nI refer, of course, to The Hobbit, as adapted by Rankin-Bass in 1977. Why, yes, it beats Peter Jackson’s version comfortably, and it does it in a mere seventy-seven minutes. It is also topical, given the recent sad death of Orson Bean, the voice actor for Bilbo Baggins.\n\nUnlike Bakshi, I came late to this one. I first saw it in 2015, by which point I had suffered through nine hours’ worth of Jackson’s ponderous trilogy. Frankly, Rankin-Bass felt like a breath of fresh air by comparison, and while the studio’s later stab at The Return of the King is (justifiably) notorious, The Hobbit of 1977 works.\n\nIt works because there are no pretensions of Serious Epic Fantasy. It is a fun, fairy tale adventure about a comfortable little gentlemen and a quest for dragon gold. Sure, it takes the occasional liberty – we’ll get to that – but there is far less weirdness than the 1966 Snyder version (Bilbo doesn’t marry any princesses here!), or the 1985 Soviet Hobbit (there’s less dancing). The Rankin-Bass Hobbit sticks to the bread and butter of the book, and gets the themes across admirably. It never commits the cardinal sin of pretending the story is something it is not.\n\nI do think the shadow of Peter Jackson hangs over my interpretation of the 1977 Hobbit, in the sense that I keep seeing contrasts between the two adaptations. Recall that in An Unexpected Journey (2012), Bilbo takes until 40 minutes into the film before leaving Bag End. Here, including explanatory narrations, Bilbo is out and on his way after 10 minutes. The Rankin-Bass Hobbit is absolutely ruthless in cutting out the flab of the story – it’s not just Bag End either, because they axe the Master of Lake Town, amongst others. There is copious usage of cut scenes and narration, but don’t worry, they preserve most of the songs.\n\nSpeaking of the beginning at Bag End, whereas in Jackson, Bilbo (literally) signs up on his own initiative, Rankin-Bass Gandalf rather railroads Bilbo Baggins into the adventure. Indeed, Gandalf here comes across as someone who enjoys screwing with people for his own mysterious purposes. There is a more than a whiff of the Odinic archetype about Gandalf in the 1977 film, in contrast to the more lovable Ian McKellen version. You can trust Sir Ian’s Gandalf, but you need to keep your eye on the Rankin-Bass wizard, who is clearly much more powerful than he lets on. He can even mess with the rising of the sun.\n\nAnother point of contrast with Jackson is the focus of the Rankin-Bass film. Jackson’s Bilbo often feels like a side-character in his own story, with so much time being spent on developing the angsty, arrogant Thorin Oakenshield. As has been noted elsewhere by others, it’s less The Hobbit than The Dwarf. The Rankin-Bass Hobbit, by contrast, keeps the focus firmly on Bilbo, to a degree where the Dwarves are even more interchangeable than in Tolkien’s original. Thorin here is less “unique personality” and more “spokesman” for the wider group. Rather than being angsty or arrogant, he’s just like the rest… a bit cowardly, a bit greedy, a bit reliant on Bilbo to get him out of trouble, but still fundamentally a good person. His irritability about Bilbo is scaled right back. The downside is that we lose Balin as a distinctive character, and indeed all the Dwarves bar Thorin and Bombur are just Generic Bearded Gentlemen.\n\nSo I have been singing this thing’s praises at some length… are there any issues?\n\nA Purist might grumble at the omission of both Beorn and the Arkenstone. The former is obviously easier to justify, in that it’s an episodic chapter in a highly episodic story. Nothing much is lost by having the eagles carry the Company to the eaves of Mirkwood. The Arkenstone, however, is a trickier proposition. In the book (and in Jackson), Bilbo uses the Arkenstone as a bargaining chip to defuse the animosity between Thorin and Bard over the treasure. Jackson in particular goes to great lengths to portray Thorin’s descent into madness, and how badly he reacts to Bilbo’s actions. Here, in the absence of the Arkenstone, Bilbo tries to reason with the Dwarven idiot, fails, and then decides to sit the resulting Battle out via turning invisible.\n\nIn one sense, it is a convenient way to simplify the story: if you want to keep the run-time down, omitting a complicating factor like the Arkenstone makes sense. It also allows Bilbo to monologue a fair bit to himself about the stupidity of War. On the other hand, it also amounts to Bilbo straight-out washing his hands of the crisis, rather than trying to resolve it, which makes the character more passive, and even arguably a bit callous. Sure, he tries to persuade Thorin, and is more than happy to give Bard and Thranduil a share of the treasure… but once he fails, he is reduced to pointing out how idiotic everyone is being. Then the goblins turn up, the real Battle starts, and poor wounded Bombur collapses in front of him. Yes, it confirms the notion that War victimises even the nicest of people, but it gives Bilbo a whiff of cowardice in the circumstances. Bilbo isn’t a fighter, yes, but sitting on a rock, giving a match report? What happened to the active Bilbo we’ve been watching for the past hour?\n\nThe other major question-mark hanging over the 1977 film is some of its animation choices. Gollum, and there is no good way of saying this, looks like a stoned Frog (maybe that’s why he’s hungry?). The spiders of Mirkwood look vaguely cute. The Great Goblin looks like he prefers to eat his captives. Elrond has a beard and looks decidedly non-human. And Thranduil and his Wood Elves?\n\nYep. He’s green and bald. And a bona fide thief, what with turning up at the Mountain to get his hands on the treasure under the barest of pretences (something Bilbo tries, and fails, to hand-wave). Smaug himself is given a vaguely cat-like face, and is a bit on the heavy side for a flying dragon. As much as I like this film, there are some oddities.\n\nA couple of final things I spotted on my re-watch, that I am also rather unhappy with…\n\n(1) Bilbo is sufficiently fool-hardy during his conversation with Smaug that he actually takes off the Ring at one point. I am all for showcasing our Brave Little Hobbit, but that’s a bit much. I think they were going for the notion that otherwise Smaug would have had no idea where to point his fire-breath, but there are workarounds that don’t turn Bilbo into an idiot, surely?\n\n(2) More seriously, the film completely cuts Bilbo’s pitying of Gollum. Admittedly, it never occurs to the Rankin-Bass Bilbo to actually kill Gollum. He’s solely fixated on escape, so all he does is follow Gollum up the passage, then leap over him with a final “ta ta!” However, for obvious thematic reasons, it would have been nice for the film to include a musing about not killing the poor creature. Especially because the end of the 1977 film does make some rather unsubtle hints about the importance of that magic Ring, and Rankin-Bass did make an unfortunate stab at completing Bakshi with its 1980 Return of the King.\n\n**\n\nThat concludes our look at the 1977 Rankin-Bass Hobbit. While not perfect, and occasionally looking a bit weird, it’s the one adaptation that actually understands the heart of Tolkien’s book. It’s a children’s story, with darkness peeping around the corners, not another Lord of the Rings. Hell, in marked contrast to Peter Jackson, this is also one adaptation that you wish were another half-hour longer, and in contrast to Ralph Bakshi, this is a film where you aren’t reduced to hunting through dross in order to find the odd little jewel. If there’s another eventual cinematic shot at The Hobbit, the film-makers could do worse than using this as an inspiration."
