        "text": "Hardcover. Condition: Good. No Jacket. 1st Edition. First Thus. This is a first printing of the Harry N. Abrams Edition with illustrations from the television movie by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass. A previous owner has reinforced the joints by applying packing tape over the one inch tears at the head and heel of the spine. A six inch long piece of tape was also placed along the front edge of the spine and is peeling. There is also a .75 inch tear in the coated paper binding on the back edge near the heel and the binding remains sound. Corners are sharp and cover edges are smooth. Sprinkling of foxing on the fore-edges. The hinges remain intact. Light foxing on the endpapers and sprinkle of foxing on the page after the ffe. The large fold-out illustration of the dwarves captured by the wood elves has two creases. Otherwise, pages are clean, bright, smooth and unmarked. The other large fold-out of the battle with the wood elves is in pristine condition. The original text of the Hobbit profusely illustrated with the stunning illustrations from the movie. 220 pp. Please see all images.\n\nLarge Hardcover. Condition: Very Good. Dust Jacket Condition: Good. Arthur Rankin Jr; Jules Bass (illustrator). First Thus. First thus. Very good in good jacket. Large tear on rear jacket panel, 3 inch closed tear on front jacket corner, some loss from Smaug overlays on clear acetate jacket. 1976 Large Hardcover. 220 pp. Color maps and illustrations from the animated film, including several fold-outs. Clear acetate jacket with Smaug and white titles super-imposed over pictorial boards. The classic prelude to The Lord of the Rings. \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\" The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a 'little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves.' He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, 'looking for someone to share in an adventure,' Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure. The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, The Lord of the Rings, would eventually spring. Though The Hobbit is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader.\n\nLarge Hardcover. Condition: Good. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good. Arthur Rankin Jr; Jules Bass (illustrator). First Thus. First thus. Good in very good jacket. Hinges weakening, minor loss from titles and Smaug art on jacket, 1 inch stain on top page edge (does not affect margins/text/illustrations). 1976 Large Hardcover. 220 pp. Color maps and illustrations from the animated film, including several fold-outs.
