Ruled by the largest man-eating monster of all!!\n\n„\n\n— Tagline\n\nThe Last Dinosaur (極底探険船ポーラーボーラ, Kyokutei Tankensen Pōrabōra, lit. \"Sub-Polar Exploration Ship Polar-Borer\") is a 1977 Japanese-American tokusatsu kaiju film directed by Alexander Grasshoff and Tsugunobu Kotani and written by William Overgard, with special effects by Kazuo Sagawa. Co-produced by Tsuburaya Productions and Rankin/Bass Productions, it stars Richard Boone, Joan Van Ark, Steven Keats, and Toru Kawai. The film first aired in the United States on ABC on February 11, 1977, and was released to Japanese theaters by Toho-Towa on September 10 of the same year.\n\nPlot\n\nDuring an underwater oil drilling expedition, Thrust Industries' advanced submersible drilling vehicle, the Polar-Borer, accidentally burrows into a gigantic underground cavern. The vessel's crew ventures out to explore, with one member, Chuck Wade, remaining behind in the Polar-Borer. However, the crew soon find themselves attacked in the jungle by a colossal predator, a Tyrannosaurus rex. Wade manages to escape in the Polar-Borer, with all of his crew mates killed by the dinosaur. When Thrust Industries' CEO, multibillionaire Masten Thrust Jr., learns of the event, he orders a second Polar-Borer expedition to the strange underground world to investigate the presence of a prehistoric creature there, one on which he will be part of the crew. While as far as the public is concerned the expedition is for scientific purposes and grant closure for the crew members lost previously, Thrust - an accomplished big game hunter who had not faced a challenging hunt in years - intends to hunt the Tyrannosaurus himself and claim it as the ultimate trophy. Accompanying Thrust on the expedition are Wade, Japanese scientist Dr. Kawamoto, and an African tracker named Bunta. Francesca Banks, a journalist, convinces Thrust to bring her along on the expedition after seducing him.\n\nThe Polar-Borer is launched from Thrust Industries' oil platform Mother 1, and successfully bores through the polar ice and ocean floor until it surfaces in a lake within a jungle-covered underground cavern. Thrust, Wade, Bunta, and Francesca disembark to investigate, while Kawamoto remains behind to watch over their base camp. While exploring the jungle, they narrowly avoid being trampled by a stampeding ceratopsian. They later come upon a pond, where they find gigantic leeches, as well as a rock which they later discover is a giant turtle. Meanwhile, the Tyrannosaurus that killed the crew of the last Polar-Borer discovers the expedition's base camp, killing Dr. Kawamoto and trashing the camp before making off with the Polar-Borer. The beast deposits its new prize in its lair, littered with the bones of other prey. Suddenly, a Triceratops erupts from underground and charges at the Tyrannosaurus, goring it with its sharp horns. Despite sustaining injuries, the Tyrannosaurus kills its foe by biting down on its neck with its razor-sharp teeth, causing the Triceratops to bleed to death.\n\nThrust and the others soon find themselves stranded in the underground world, their every move stalked by both the Tyrannosaurus and a tribe of primitive humans. They are forced to camp in a cave and survive using the weapons they salvaged and hunting the local wildlife. Additionally, Francesca and Wade begin developing feelings for each other. When a large party of primitive men corner the trio, Thrust manages to kill their leader with a crossbow made from the ruins of Dr. Kawamoto's camp, convincing the others to stay far away from them from now on. However, a primitive woman takes an interest in the group, particularly Thrust, and follows them to their camp. Thrust is furious when the primitive woman tries to sleep with him and wants her thrown out of the camp, but Francesca decides to let her stay, naming her Hazel. One day as Hazel and Francesca are getting water from a lake, they are attacked by the Tyrannosaurus. They narrowly manage to avoid its attack, convincing Thrust that they need to kill it. Thrust and Bunta begin preparing an elaborate trap for the Tyrannosaurus, when Wade discovers the Polar-Borer in the monster's lair. He and Francesca try to convince Thrust to abandon his hunt and help them salvage the Polar-Borer, but find that Thrust's obsession has consumed him and that he wants nothing more than to kill the Tyrannosaurus himself. Wade and Francesca abandon Thrust to his hunt and manage to retrieve the Polar-Borer from the Tyrannosaurus ' lair using a pulley system, before finally pushing it back into the lake where it originally emerged. Wade begins repairs to allow the craft to escape, but Francesca goes back to try and convince Thrust to come with them.\n\nAs Wade nearly completes repairs on the Polar-Borer, the Tyrannosaurus finds and kills Bunta and prepares to do the same to Thrust and Francesca. Thrust is able to spring his trap, which catapults a gigantic boulder into the Tyrannosaurus ' head. While at first it seems to have been effective in bringing the beast down, the Tyrannosaurus soon gets back to its feet and destroys the catapult before escaping. Francesca begs Thrust to leave with her and Wade, but he continues to refuse to go home empty-handed. Francesca pleads with him to leave the Tyrannosaurus alone since it is \"the last dinosaur,\" but Thrust simply replies that so is he. Thrust sees Francesca and Wade off as the Polar-Borer submerges and returns to the surface world. As Thrust hears the Tyrannosaurus ' roar echo through the jungle, he prepares to continue his hunt and is surprised when Hazel approaches him. Rather than shoo her off like before, Thrust finally decides to let Hazel join him, and the two set off into the jungle together.\n\nStaff\n\nMain article: The Last Dinosaur/Credits.\n\nStaff role on the left, staff member's name on the right.\n\nDirected by Alexander Grasshoff, Tsugunobu Kotani\n\nWritten by William Overgard\n\nExecutive producers Noboru Tsuburaya, Arthur Rankin Jr., Jules Bass\n\nAssociate producers Kinshiro Okubo, Masaki Izuka, Benni Korzen, Kazuyoshi Kasai\n\nMusic by Maury Laws\n\nArranged and conducted by Kenjiro Hirose\n\nTheme song \"The Last Dinosaur\"\n\nPerformed by Nancy Wilson\n\nComposed by Maury Laws\n\nLyrics by Jules Bass\n\nArranged and conducted by Bernard Hoffer\n\nCinematography by Shoji Ueda\n\nEdited by Tatsuji Nakashizu, Minoru Kozono\n\nProduction design by Kazuhiko Fujiwara\n\nFirst assistant director Shohei Tojo\n\nDirector of special effects Kazuo Sagawa\n\nFirst assistant director of special effects Yoshiyuki Yoshimura\n\nVisual effects by Minoru Nakano, Michihisa Miyashige\n\nCast\n\nMain article: The Last Dinosaur/Credits.\n\nActor's name on the left, character played on the right.\n\nRichard Boone as Masten Thrust Jr., CEO of Thrust Industries\n\nJoan Van Ark as Francesca Banks, newspaper reporter\n\nSteven Keats as Chuck Wade, Polar-Borer crew\n\nLuther Rackley as Bunta, tracker\n\nMasumi Sekiya as Hazel, Primitive Woman\n\nWilliam Ross as Hal\n\nCarl Hansen as Barney\n\nTetsu Nakamura as Dr. Kawamoto, inventor of the Polar-Borer\n\nDon Maloney as Captain of Mother 1\n\nVanessa Cristina as Reporter\n\nShunsuke Kariya as Primal Man leader\n\nToru Kawai as Tyrannosaurus\n\nTatsumi Nikamoto as Triceratops (front end)\n\nJapanese dub\n\nShuichiro Moriyama as Masten Thrust Jr.\n\nMichiko Hirai as Francesca Banks\n\nKatsunosuke Hori as Chuck Wade\n\nAppearances\n\nMonsters\n\nTyrannosaurus rex\n\nTriceratops\n\nPteranodon\n\nCeratopsian\n\nGiant turtle\n\nGiant fish\n\nVarious skeletons\n\nWeapons, vehicles, and races\n\nPolar-Borer\n\nMother 1\n\nPrimitive Man\n\nMcDonnell-Douglas DC-10\n\nBell 205\n\nGallery\n\nMain article: The Last Dinosaur/Gallery.\n\nAlternate titles\n\nThe Last Dinosaur (最後の恐竜, Saigo no Kyōryū, alternate Japanese title, translated from English title)\n\nThe Last Dinosaur: Sub-Polar Exploration Ship Polar-Borer (最後の恐竜 極底探険船ポーラーボーラ, Saigo no Kyōryū: Kyokutei Tanken-sen Pōrābōra, Japanese video title)\n\nLast Dinosaur - King of Monsters (Viimeinen Dinosaurus - Hirviöitten Kuningas; Finland)\n\nTheatrical releases\n\nView all posters for the film here.\n\nWest Germany - July 7, 1977\n\nFrance - July 20, 1977\n\nJapan - September 10, 1977\n\nFinland - December 9, 1977\n\nColombia - May 24, 1978\n\nUnited Kingdom - July 7, 1978\n\nAustralia - July 10, 1980\n\nBrazil - December 25, 1980\n\nU.S. release\n\nThe Last Dinosaur was scheduled for theatrical releases in both Japan and the United States. However, it was decided at the last minute to release the film directly to television in the U.S. ABC aired the film and cut 11 minutes from it, while it was later released unedited theatrically in Japan by Toho-Towa, a subsidiary of Toho.

Emperor Tyranis) in Dinosaur Great War Izenborg (1977-1978) and later as Tyrannosaurus Jackie in Dinosaur Squadron Koseidon (1978-1979).\n\nThe Ururu / Emperor Tyranis version of the suit was faithfully recreated for the climactic segment of the 2017 documentary The Return of Izenborg.[2][3][4]\n\nThe Tyrannosaurus in this film is portrayed by Toru Kawai, who played Godzilla in Zone Fighter and Terror of Mechagodzilla, while the front end of the Triceratops is portrayed by Tatsumi Nikamoto, who acted opposite Kawai as Zone Fighter and Titanosaurus in the same two works, respectively.\n\nThe Tyrannosaurus utilizes a combination of Godzilla's roars and King Kong's roars from King Kong vs. Godzilla and King Kong Escapes.\n\nThe boneyard that litters the Tyrannosaurus ' lair contains the remains of a wide variety of prehistoric creatures that are not seen living onscreen in the rest of the film. Among the remains are the skulls of a two-horned warthog, numerous mastodons, an ox with a singular horn like that of a unicorn, a separate ox skull with three unusual horns, an unspecified giant reptile, a long-faced cow, a sitting pair of bull skulls, a large headless humanoid skeleton hanging from a dead tree, numerous Pteranodons, the scattered jawbones of prehistoric rhinoceros-like mammals such as Embolotherium and Arsinoitherium, and skulls heavily resembling those of the dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus), Archaeotherium, Pakicetus, and Daeodon.[5]\n\nReferences\n\nThis is a list of references for The Last Dinosaur.
