        "text": "At one time developing anything penned by J.R.R. Tolkien was considered a practice in futility. With little hope of successfully expressing the contents of a novel, no less than 320 pages, into a movie of 77 minutes is laughing in the face of death. That is until the team of Rankin & Bass optioned the rights to produce and direct an animated feature of The Hobbit for ABC television. Take that reality!\n\nThe Hobbit premiered Sunday November 27 1977 on ABC television produced and directed by Rankin & Bass and voiced by an all-star cast of: Orson Bean (Bilbo Baggins), Richard Boone (Smaug), Hans Conreid (Thorin), Otto Preminger (Elven king), and the great John Huston (Gandalf the Grey). With their cast set Rankin & Bass had the combined tools necessary to produce the latest seasonal treat of television film fiction history.\n\nWithout question or debate this TV movie is at best a cliff notes adventure of Tolkien’s Hobbit. TV movies have commercial interruptions, limited budgets, and compounded by the level of current animation technology in ‘77, the odds a Hobbit TV movie being remotely coherent to its source material is thin at best. Rankin and Bass not only acknowledged this fact but embraced the reality that 2/3rds of the famous novel will lay on a writer’s editing room floor long before story boards and cell animation is sent to Japan for completion.\n\nInstead of trying to bridge story and action Rankin and Bass chose scenes dedicated to Bilbo’s strongest individual moments of character growth. First, Bilbo “the scoundrel thief” surfaces in a game of riddles enabling his escape from Gollum’s crazed cannibal belly. Bilbo “the hero” brought about by focusing on two events: “Sting spider killer of Murkwood” and “the dwarf emancipator from a woodland elves keep.” Bilbo’s final hurdle is “Bilbo the brave” where Bilbo Baggins embraces his new-found courage in the world outside of Bag End to challenge adversity – and win. Although the adversity facing Bilbo Baggins is not entirely Smaug the dragon… just watch the third act, you’ll get it.\n\nFocusing on key plot elements of the original story allowed the narrative to find a voice to propel the dwarfs and their lucky 14 Bilbo Baggins forward to rescue the Dwarf stronghold from the grasp of Smaug the dragon. If you have read the novel you should notice that all but 1 song in the film was word for word lifted from the novel – all but the addition of the title song “The Greatest Adventure” this element is the only bad thing about this movie – and it is stinky cheese, stinky hippy dippy bad. Rankin and Bass also made it a point to include dialogue from the book in small 30 second to 2 minute dialogue nods to the original source material; they’re brilliant, if not preferred viewing, to spark the conscience to seek out this novel.\n\nWhat I love about this movie beyond the voice acting is Arthur Rankin’s character designs; he’s an artist of the highest level. The Goblins, Trolls, Wood Elves, and Dwarfs are so vivid on the screen it’s still hard to watch Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films and not wish to see the black frog like Gollum – sans the dreadful crushed-larynx-Donald-Duck-squawk we get from Andy Serkis. God, the modern Gollum is nearly unwatchable. Every character, no matter how brief the time spent on-screen, is just as imaginative if not more as the pictures painted by Tolkien himself. My favorites from the Hobbit aesthetically would be the background paintings and settings done in a wet technique reminiscent of water colors. Followed by the look and voice characterization of Gollum – he really scared the crap out of me when I got the WE-CAN-READ record with story book that Christmas, never before that moment did a cartoon frog-man-thing make my skin crawl.\n\nIn no way whatsoever do I feel guilty about loving this version of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit by the long time team of Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass. Universal Entertainment is dead and Rankin and Bass were the summit to fantasy adventures beyond the imagination. Many act crass and hold their nose up high if and when you interject a discussion about this movie, but I say Fuk’em! They had no clue about Tolkien or the Hobbit prior to being exposed to this movie or the horrible Ralph Bakshi Lord of the Rings 1978 (pot meet kettle, I know-shut up).\n\nIf Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, and now the theatrical release of The Hobbit have not motivated you to have read The Hobbit, and at the least seek out and watch this movie, I bless and forgive you. Ignorance and inexperience needs to be considered a hidden blessing to the diehard fans that will attain a steady stream of competent content based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth saga for decades to come. So come one come all, experience a small treasure of pop culture, and a gem of a long forgotten genre with Rankin & Bass’s The Hobbit."
