First of all this movie is a lot shorter than the TLoR movies. So obviously they couldn't fit in everything from the book. It was actually pretty funny seeing how quickly they rush the main story beats, especially after watching the newer Hobbit movies not too long ago.\n\nThis is a very fun, light hearted adventure movie from the 70's with no shortage of silly moments. However there a lot of cool ass moments as well and there is a lot to enjoy about this film. For starters the art is fantastic.…\n\nRankin/Bass, completely unconcerned with making Middle Earth fuckable, put a bunch of twisted freaks on screen and play the fuckin’ hits from The Hobbit, accompanied by the kind of 1970s folk that used to make me think that I hated folk music (because I was, once upon a time, a big dum-dum). It’s a fascinating amalgam of various fantasy styles, somewhat rough and ready due to its being produced for television, and guess what? It fucking ROCKS. G-d what I would give for science fiction and fantasy to be the recipient of this kind of treatment again, as opposed to the “respect” shown to those genres now in the form of the lifeless, glittering, $200M, three hour long adaptations we’re…"
