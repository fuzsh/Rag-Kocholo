        "text": "The Hobbit (1966 animated film)\n\nThe Hobbit is a cartoon based on J.R.R. Tolkien's book The Hobbit. A homebody hobbit finds himself going on a quest to save a dwarven treasure from a dragon in this loose adaptation of the classic novel. It took less than a month to create the cartoon. They did it in a terrible hurry. This is...\n\nThe Hobbit (1977 animated film)\n\nThe Hobbit is the name of a 1977 American animated television special from the Rankin/Bass studio, directed by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr. and based on J.R.R. Tolkien's book The Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins the Hobbit is smoking outside his house when suddenly Gandalf the wizard appears and tells...\n\nThe Lord of the Rings (1978 film)\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is the title of an animated film produced and directed by Ralph Bakshi, and released to theaters in 1978. It was an adaptation of the first half of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Bakshi's most ambitious effort (and his most famous after his...\n\nThe Return of the King (1980 film)\n\nThe Return of the King (subtitled A Story of the Hobbits) is a 1980 animated adaptation of the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien that was released by Rankin/Bass as a TV special. It has since been released on VHS and DVD. The film was created by the same production company that had worked on the 1977...\n\nI think that makes at least three alternate animated universes, since apparently only The Hobbit (1977) and The Return of the King (1980) are in continuity with each other\n\nSo I looked more into it. A while back there was a timeline posted on the Pottermore wiki\n\nFrom this I could take away 2 scenarios:\n\n1: Hogwarts Mystery is a divergent timeline\n\n2: Hogwarts Mystery takes place in the film universe as the Fantastic Beast movies are on there. (If we consider that the Cursed Child refers to the play and that the book universe does not have the Fantastic Beast movies as canon)\n\nOh I just noticed the symbols on the timeline below the entries. That would confirm that the Fantastic Beasts are movie universe for sure at least and Cursed Child play is dominant over the script in both universes.\n\nAs for Hogwarts Mystery, I would personally go with a diverged timeline. Many people said it contradicts some things from the main HP plot anyway, like the Quidditch tournaments, which of course we could look past, but ehh."
