(On the other hand, the Elf-lord Elrond, with his distinguished features and strange crown-halo, is far preferable to Bakshi’s dismally graceless version of the same character.)\n\nThe best-designed character is the dragon Smaug, whose obscene bulk and wolflike face are rendered with flair and imagination. The giant spiders, too, are genuinely menacing. Despite the fearful monsters, violence is suggested rather than explicitly depicted. The folk-tune soundtrack, though corny, at least tries to incorporate some of Tolkien’s poetry.\n\nThe Hobbit’s television debut was followed by Ralph Bakshi’s theatrically released The Lord of the Rings, which covered approximately half of Tolkien’s epic trilogy. A couple of years later, Rankin-Bass completed the story with The Return of the King.\n\nProduct Notes"
