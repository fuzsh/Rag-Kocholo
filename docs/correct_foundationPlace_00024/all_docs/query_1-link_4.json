Host Enabler allows you to conduct routine host-related tasks such as data entry and retrieval, while providing access to OnBase screen scraping and cross-referencing features. Cross-referencing provides the ability to retrieve OnBase documents by clicking on information on the host screen. Screen scraping allows you to index OnBase documents based on information entered directly on the host screen, eliminating the need to enter identical indexing information in the host\n\nHost Enabler supports IBM 5250 and 3270, ANSI, T-27 and VT terminal types running in a terminal window inside of the OnBase Client. OnBase supports DECLAT, File, HLCN, AS400, Mainframe, RUMBA UNIX, Serial, Telnet links and more. In addition, PC keyboards can be mapped to match the key positions of regular dumb terminal keyboards so users maintain familiarity with keyboard strokes and routines."
