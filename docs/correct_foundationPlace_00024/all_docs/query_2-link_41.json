        "text": "Mathematics is the study of pattern, structure, and change. Although it is one of the most ancient disciplines, new mathematics is being created every day. It can be found in everything from internet security to green energy technology to Wall Street investment strategies.\n\nClasses in the Department of Mathematics emphasize the analytical thinking and problem-solving skills that create a strong foundation not just in mathematics, but in many other careers including law, business, and a range of technical fields.\n\nWestern offers both a BS and BA in Mathematics. In comparison, the BS Mathematics major has more advanced requirements while the BA offers more flexibility in creating a course schedule.\n\nWestern’s Mathematics/Computer Science Program provides excellent preparation for graduate study or for careers in the technical, scientific, and mathematical application of computers.\n\nYou might also work on a research or independent study project with faculty.\n\nDuring their studies at Western, students have interned as Software Developers for companies like Attachmate and Emergency Reporting, and have received other internship opportunities through Moss Adams and Cypress Semiconductor.\n\nAccording to WαM: \"The goal for WαM is to break down the stereotype that math is this terrible, universally hated subject. Math is beautiful and incredibly useful in our everyday lives. Through panels, activities, and professor talks we hope to show everybody that.\""
