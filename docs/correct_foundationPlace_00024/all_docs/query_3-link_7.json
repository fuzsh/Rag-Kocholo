        "text": "Pat LaFontaine – President\n\nIn celebration of the Centennial of the NHL in 2017, Lafontaine was selected as one of the Top-100 players in league history. He currently is in 15th place All-Time in Points-per-Game (1.171) and 17th All-Time in Goals-Per-Game (0.541) in league history. A perennial All-Star in the National Hockey League, Pat LaFontaine was not only a great player, but also a great humanitarian in whatever city he represented. That combination was recognized in 2003 when it was announced that LaFontaine would be the first player inducted into both the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in Minnesota in the same year.\n\nIn 1998, after 15 years in the NHL, Pat retired prematurely as a result of a series of head traumas and concussions suffered through his career. With support and inspiration from family, friends and most of all, the kids in those hospitals, competing not for goals, but for life, Pat drew upon their courage and got through the most difficult time of his life. From that point on, Pat’s fight for children took on new meaning and clearly defined where all his time and energy were going to be focused: helping kids through this Foundation.\n\nHe currently is employed at the National Hockey League in New York as Vice President of Hockey Development and Community Affairs. He recently made history by leading the effort to encourage 17 hockey organizations from around the world to adopt a Declaration of Principles. In doing so, hockey became the first sport in the world to advocate this powerful platform for participants to build character, foster positive values and develop important life skills that transcend the game.\n\nPat splits his time between New York City and Long Island with his wife and 3 children.\n\nCarl Lombardi – Treasurer\n\nMr. Lombardi is a 1980 graduate of Hofstra University with a BBA in Marketing.

They work with top luxury cosmetic companies including Esteê Lauder, Clinique, Mac Cosmetics and Victoria’s Secret, and employ more than 200 people at its corporate headquarters and manufacturing plant.\n\nLombardi’s passion for work and eye for detail makes him a natural leader. As his firm continues to evolve, Carl looks to lend his business and interpersonal skills toward bettering the world around him. A long-time supporter of Companions in Courage Foundation, Lombardi has helped fund multiple programs and attended Lion’s Den room openings.\n\nHe lives on Long Island with his wife and two children.\n\nRichard Pluta – Merrill Lynch\n\nRichard Pluta began his career at Merrill Lynch in 1982.

In the area of philanthropy, he has many passions. He and his wife Deborah foster children through Catholic Family Services, and are Board Members for The Dwelling Place of NY, a homeless shelter for women, and the Mobile Trauma Unit, a rapid response team established in the aftermath of 9/11.
