They intend to run SUSE and Novell as two separate business units.\n\nSpeaking in the press release Novell CEO and president Ron Hovsepian speaks positively about the deal: –\n\n“We… believe the transaction with Attachmate Corporation will deliver important benefits to Novell’s customers, partners and employees by providing opportunities for building on Novell’s brands, innovation and market leadership.”\n\nWhat the deal will mean for the Linux landscape remains to be seen. The acquisition is certainly no great shock, with Novell the target of many acquisition rumors throughout 2010."
