        "text": "“Do you know Linux? WE AE HIRING!” That's what billboards from HostGator (http://www.hostgator.com) have been saying for the past several years. That company is not alone. Demand for Linux talent is high and getting higher. In a February 2014 report (http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/LinuxJobsReport_2014.pdf), the Linux Foundation and Dice detailed a picture that was already obvious:\n\nAnd that's not all:\n\nExactly the same could have been said of DOS in 1985 and Windows a decade later. It cannot be said of either today, even though both still are used all over the place. In 2012, for example, United Airlines moved its reservation system to SHARES (http://servicesangle.com/blog/2012/03/08/united-airlines-goes-from-the-web-to-dos), which runs on DOS. And Microsoft's sundowning of Windows XP (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/endofsupport.aspx) seems to have given cramps to nearly the entire retail banking industry (http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/20/5326772/windows-xp-powers-95-percent-of-atms-worldwide), which finally will move its ATM machines from XP to Windows 7 (http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/atms-face-deadline-to-upgrade-from-windows-xp#p2) or to Linux (http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article/129594/Brazilian-banks-look-to-Linux-for-ATMs). It's not going to Windows 8, which Supersite for Windows (http://winsupersite.com) guru Paul Thurrot calls “a debacle” (http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/threshold-be-called-windows-9-ship-april-2015) and says is “tanking harder than Microsoft is comfortable discussing in public”. He also says the next version of Windows, code-named Threshold, “recasts Windows 8 as the next Vista”, adding “there's no way to sugarcoat this. Windows 8 has set back Microsoft, and Windows, by years, and possibly for good.”\n\nAccording to Ali R. Babaoglan, who, presumably, pays to read Gartner's expensive reports (http://www.alibabaoglan.com/blog/gartners-technology-predictions-2014-2015-2016):\n\nIn today's world, the closest thing to Windows' longtime domination of PCs is Android's domination of mobile devices. There the only thing keeping Android from prevailing as utterly as Microsoft once did over PCs is Apple devices running iOS. According to comScore's January 2014 report (https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2014/3/comScore_Reports_January_2014_US_Smartphone_Subscriber_Market_Share), Android led smartphone platforms in the US with a 51.7% share, followed by Apple (iOS) with 41.6%, then Microsoft (Windows Phone, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone) with 3.2% and BlackBerry with 3.1%. More telling is the number of OEMs making phones for each operating system. Apple and BlackBerry have just one each: themselves. Microsoft has HTC, Nokia and Samsung. Android has HTC, Samsung and all the rest (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Android_devices), which are too many to list. According to Sundar Pichai (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai), the Senior VP who oversees apps at Google, more than a billion devices running Android have been activated (https://plus.google.com/+SundarPichai/posts/NeBW7AjT1QM).\n\nMicrosoft would be far wiser to join that juggernaut than to fight it. And, if it does, here are a few things Microsoft could bring to the Linux/Android table that nobody else will, including Google:\n\nRemember how Bill Gates didn't get the Internet at first, and then turned a 180 in 1995? Read the memo (http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/05/0526bill-gates-internet-memo/all). Linux wasn't on Bill's radar at the time, but BSD was. The top item under “actions required for the Windows platform” begins this way:\n\nToday the reality of Linux is of a piece with the reality of the Internet. Neither is going away. Both are co-evolving in the minds of every geek adding value to them. Both transcend the interests of every company contributing to them, including Google. If Satya Nadella (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella) looks at reality with the same clear eyes Bill Gates cast on the Internet in 1995, he might see the wisdom of embracing Linux with the same enthusiasm and commitment."
