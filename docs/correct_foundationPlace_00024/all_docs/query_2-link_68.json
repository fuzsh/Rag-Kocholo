        "text": "Added a login dialog in the Recorder for terminal connections using the Direct Connection provider and the SSH communication protocol. Previously, the recorder was disabled for such connections.\n\nThe Terminal Activities package now supports the Windows project compatibility (.NET 6.0) for native providers for various terminal emulators (previously available only in Windows - Legacy projects).\n\nFor Wait type activities (Wait Screen Text, Wait Text at Position, etc.), the text the activity is set to wait for is now added to the timeout exception message for an easier way of tracking the errors.\n\nThe UiPath.Terminal.Activities package is now compatible with .NET 5. Projects created with project compatibility Windows (.NET 5 with Windows support) and using 3rd party terminal emulators (EHLL, IBM Personal Communications, etc) require a 64-bit architecture.\n\nNew configuration options have been added to the Configure Connection window, VT terminals being available with the following options: VT100, VT101, VT 102, VT220, VT240, VT320, VT340, and VT420.\n\nThe Terminal Session activity now supports selecting the Screen Size of a session before creating it, thus enabling you to directly create a session with the screen size of your choice.\n\nYou can now use CTRL, ALT, and SHIFT keys in combination with F-keys when automating with the Terminals package.\n\nTo prevent issues when certain fonts are missing from the terminal machines you are automating, the default fallback font has been changed to Consolas.\n\nThe Terminal Session recorder can now be reopened at any point after dragging the activity to the Workflow Designer by using the Start Recorder button in the body of the activity.\n\nTo align with the Package Signing feature, the Terminal activities pack has been officially signed by UiPath.\n\nThis new year brings two more languages in the entire UiPath Platform - French and Russian. Since we layed down the foundations of localization in our previous release, we are continuing our efforts in bringing you a more immersive experience and lowering the language barrier bit by bit.\n\nThe moment is finally here - the entire UiPath Platform has been localized, so that you can have a truly immersive experience, from install to design and execution. Now, besides English, you can access everything, including our online documentation, in Japanese."
