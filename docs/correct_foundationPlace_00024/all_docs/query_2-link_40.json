        "text": "Farley, Peter x23353\n\nFrom a VTAM logon screen, this works for any screen size you can implement in your emulator, though I believe there is a limitation of maximum bytes per screen = 8192 (60 x 132 = 8184 bytes):\n\nlogon applid=TSO,logmode=D4C32XX3\n\nThat logmode is supplied by IBM by default unless your VTAM network administrator has deleted it.\n\nIf you have Netview Access or some other terminal distributor or interface this logmode may or may not be available to you. I only know that it works from a VTAM logon screen.\n\nCan't help with your Attachmate issue though, sorry.\n\nHTH\n\nPeter\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\nFrom: IBM Mainframe Discussion List [mailto:IBM-***@LISTSERV.UA.EDU] On Behalf Of George, ***@FTB\n\nSent: Friday, April 11, 2014 12:42 PM\n\nTo: IBM-***@LISTSERV.UA.EDU\n\nSubject: Re: Emulator Screen Size with Attachmate Extra X-treme 9.3\n\nNot real sure what you're asking so I'll go with;\n\nThe emulator offers the base models of: Model 2 (24X80) Model 3 (32x80), Model 4 (43X 80) and Model 5 (27x132).\n\nAs far as my site? We are on z/OS 01.13.00 (ISPF 6.3), VTAM 6.1.D so whatever these offer unless there is some system configuration member that limits modes.\n\nI understand there is a LOGMOD that allows for dynamic screen sizes but the emulator needs to be able to communicate with it. I do recall in the past successfully logging on with that mode (which escapes me at the moment) but the emulator could not set any screen size other than the base ones shown above.\n\nThis is outside my knowledge base but I have seen old posts on how to do it with other emulators but it seems Attachmate's Extra! X-treme does not have this ability as far as I can find. This is why I'm asking and hoping someone has found a means to do this.\n\nThanks\n\nBill\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\nFrom: IBM Mainframe Discussion List [mailto:IBM-***@LISTSERV.UA.EDU] On Behalf Of Mike Schwab\n\nSent: Friday, April 11, 2014 9:22 AM\n\nTo: IBM-***@LISTSERV.UA.EDU\n\nSubject: Re: Emulator Screen Size with Attachmate Extra X-treme 9.3\n\nWhat modes are available at the site you are trying to connect to?\n\nOn Fri, Apr 11, 2014 at 10:32 AM, George, ***@FTB <***@ftb.ca.gov> wrote:\n\n> Is anyone aware of a means to configure Attachmate's Extra X-treme (v9.3) emulator to display a screen size other than the base models (2,3,4,5)?\n\n> Checking the help and the Attachmate site I've not found any hints on this.\n\n> I was hoping there might be a config member that might allow tweaking beyond what is offered on the base \"Display\" setup screen of the four base models.\n\n> Note: I'm aware of other emulators that are quite flexible is screen size configuration and would LOVE to be able to install such however we are locked into using what is given us and app installs are shut off.\n\n>\n\n> Thanks\n\n> Bill\n\n>\n\n--\n\nThis message and any attachments are intended only for the use of the addressee and may contain information that is privileged and confidential.
