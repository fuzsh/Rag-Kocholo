Jeff has commented that SUSE is an important brand and business that he wants to strengthen. What are his thoughts about the community and what does he see for SUSE and openSUSE? Here below are the questions I put forward and Jeffâs current thoughts. âJos > > > > 1. **Open Source** > > What is Attachmateâs history with open source projects? > > Attachmate does not have a corporate track record in the open source business. However, we recognize the importance of open source technology, particularly Linux, and the growing value it brings to enterprises globally. We also recognize and value the openSUSE project, the contribution that the community makes to the SUSE business and most importantly, the many ways in which the community benefits SUSE customers. > > At the end of the day, we are a technology company that is customer-driven, made up of engineers and technology enthusiasts. We have a lot of individuals that are long-time users of open source and participants in the open source movement. We recognize and understand what the community has developed, particularly over the last decade, and we are excited to be part of its future. > > What is Attachmateâs view of open source software? > > Attachmate recognizes that enterprises all over the world are utilizing more open source technology in their infrastructures, data centers and desktops every year. We believe this is a trend that will continue and thatâs why we are excited about the Open Platform Solutions business and in particular, the SUSE Linux community. > > It is easy for people to assume that because we are not currently in the open source business, we donât value or understand it. This is far from the case. We are in the business of meeting customer needs and they see great value in utilizing open source technology solutions. Because of its open nature, open source is being adopted by enterprises in all industries around the world. Our intent is to keep it that way and continue to foster what has made it so successful for the Open Platforms Solutions business. > > 2. **SUSE** > > Ok, then what is the plan for SUSE? > > We cannot speak to specifics until after close, but what we can communicate now is our intention to establish a SUSE business unit on par with the existing Attachmate and NetIQ business units. We believe that establishing SUSE as its own business unit will give greater focus and flexibility to grow within a competitive market. We view SUSE as a well regarded and proven technology in the open source and enterprise Linux community and we want to further build upon that. We intend for SUSE to continue to provide the same high quality open source technology solutions, such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, needed to meet usersâ demands for scalability, interoperability and cost effectiveness. > > What will the SUSE business unit be â what do you mean by âbusiness unitâ? > > A business unit brings together all the resources, IP, people and infrastructure needed to operate â to build product, deliver solutions and support customers. So, what is known today as Open Platform Solutions will now be centralized within the SUSE business unit. In most respects SUSE will continue to operate as it did as OPS, but will benefit from being a dedicated and more visible brand with a focused business unit behind it. > > Does Attachmate intend to immediately sell the SUSE business? > > I want to be clear here: all of our efforts will be focused on doing the things necessary to make SUSE the highest performing business with the strongest openSUSE community that we can. This is a healthy, growing dynamic business. We want to continue to nurture this business and grow it. This is why we want to elevate the SUSE brand and operate that part of the business as a distinct unit where it will receive greater visibility and focus. > > How do you plan to compete in the Linux market? > > Weâre excited about SUSE because of the great competitive advantages it already has. With thousands of certified ISV applications, the best interoperability and unsurpassed scalability, it provides the best value and the lowest cost of ownership on the market. Attachmate intends to continue that commitment to high quality and cost-effective solutions. > > What are your intentions for open source initiatives sponsored by Novell today? > > No decisions have been made regarding any specific projects or sponsorships. Much more integration work needs to happen before discussions of changing the status of individual projects can occur. But we can say that the new SUSE business unit will stay committed to participating in the projects and initiatives that are most important to the SUSE business and its customers. > > Will Attachmate continue to support Linux kernel development by employees as Novell has done? > > Yes, we will. Key contributions to the Linux kernel are a benefit to everyone in the community. This sort of contribution is a key element of what makes the synergy between business and open source so successful and we intend to continue support it. > > 3. **openSUSE** > > Will Attachmate increase or decrease the investments in development and marketing for openSUSE? > > There is a lot of integration work to do before those decisions are made and some of that work cannot be done until after the transaction has closed. Our intent is to continue to sponsor and participate in the openSUSE project. > > Will this impact the initiative to create an independent foundation for openSUSE? > > No decisions on this initiative have been made. This is a complex topic that has been actively debated in the community for some time. We look forward to continuing that discussion with the community after the close of the transaction. > > Will Attachmate continue to support the openSUSE conference? > > No decisions have been made about the ongoing sponsorship of openSUSE conference. It is simply too early to reach conclusions on specific areas such as this â more integration work and collaboration with the SUSE team is needed. Our overall intent is to maintain the continuity of success we see within the SUSE business and that includes continuing to work closely with the openSUSE community. > > Will the acquisition have any other effects on the openSUSE project or community? > > We look forward to learning more about the project and working together with the community to figure out whatâs working well, what could be done differently or improved. This will be a highly collaborative relationship. > > Does Attachmate intend to shut down the openSUSE community project? > > No, we donât. Attachmate intends to continue the sponsorship and collaboration with the openSUSE project. We view the openSUSE project and its extended community as an important part of the overall SUSE business and we value its contributions to the technology that forms the heart of the SUSE offerings (see related statement on the Attachmate website here). > > 4. **Intellectual Property** > > What IP assets are being purchased by CPTN Holdings LLC? > > Attachmate cannot provide details on the IP assets being purchased, but we can clarify that CPTN is NOT purchasing products. They are purchasing 882 patents and patent applications as described in the initial 8-K filed by Novell. > > The purchase does not include the Novell UNIX copyrights (see related statement on the Novell website here). It does not include the product source code or product implementations. > > Attachmate would not buy a company and not preserve what is working nor hamper our ability to operate this business. So, SUSE will retain all the technology, rights and IP needed to continue and grow. > > Does the purchase by CPTN Holdings impact the openSUSE project or the SUSE enterprise business? > > After the merger is complete, the SUSE business unit will retain all the IP and technology rights needed to operate, continue its sponsorship of the openSUSE project and supporting SUSE customers. > > What happens to the Novell UNIX copyrights after the sale of IP assets to CPTN Holdings? > > No change. The purchase of IP assets by CPTN Holdings does not include the UNIX copyrights and the copyrights will continue to be owned by Novell (see related statement on the Novell website here). > > > > FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS > > This communication contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact (such as statements containing the words âbelieves,â âplans,â âanticipates,â âexpects,â âestimatesâ and similar expressions) should be considered forward-looking statements. Among others, the following risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: (i) the risk that the merger may be delayed or may not be consummated; (ii) the risk that the definitive merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require Novell to pay Attachmate a termination fee of $60 million; (iii) risks related to the diversion of managementâs attention from Novellâs ongoing business operations; (iv) risks regarding the failure of Attachmate to obtain the necessary financing to complete the merger; (v) the effect of the announcement of the patent sale or the merger on Novellâs business relationships (including, without limitation, partners and customers), operating results and business generally; and (vi) risks related to obtaining the requisite consents to the patent sale and the merger, including, without limitation, the timing (including possible delays) and receipt of regulatory approvals from various governmental entities (including any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on these approvals) and the risk that one or more governmental entities may deny approval. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Novellâs filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ), including Novellâs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2010, which are available at the SECâs website //www.sec.gov. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual results and events may differ materially from results and events currently expected. Novell expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change of expectations with regard thereto or to reflect any change in events, conditions or circumstances. > > ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MERGER AND WHERE TO FIND IT > > In connection with the merger, Novell filed a preliminary proxy statement regarding the merger with the SEC on December 14, 2010 and intends to file a definitive proxy statement regarding the merger and other relevant documents with the SEC in the future. Investors and security holders of Novell are urged to read these documents, including the definitive proxy statement, if and when they become available, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they contain or will contain important information about Novell, the merger and the other parties to the merger. Investors and security holders may obtain these documents (and any other documents filed by Novell and Attachmate with the SEC) free of charge at the SECâs website at //www.sec.gov. In addition, the documents filed with the SEC by Novell may be obtained free of charge by directing such request to: Novell Investor Relations at 1-800-317-3195 or from the investor relations portion of Novellâs website at //www.novell.com/company/ir/. **Investors and security holders are urged to read the definitive proxy statement and the other relevant materials when they become available before making any voting or investment decision with respect to the merger.** Novell and its directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from Novellâs stockholders in respect of the merger. Information regarding Novellâs directors and executive officers is contained in Novellâs proxy statement for its 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, dated February 26, 2010, and subsequent filings which Novell has made with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2010. Stockholders may obtain additional information about the directors and executive officers of Novell and their respective interests with respect to the merger by security holdings or otherwise, which may be different than those of Novellâs stockholders generally, by reading the preliminary proxy statement and the definitive proxy statement and other relevant documents regarding the merger, when filed with the SEC. Each of these documents is, or will be, available as described above.

To the question of what Clarkâs goals are he answered: > > 1. The top goal is as a Board to get the Foundation up and operational. As we continue to work towards this, Iâm sure that we will uncover other issues that we will need to address > > 2. Grow the Community > > 3. Is a personal goal: Tune up my decoder ring for all these alias cloaking and get to know as many people as possible -simply because that is the fun part of being in a community. > > 4. Let people get their work done; er âhave a lot of funâ > > Alan also provided his background experience with open source projects, both within Novell and outside Novell. > > **Foundation Creation** > > Several board members expressed a desire to develop a more open and transparent process in communicating the development of the openSUSE Foundation than what currently exists. Some believe there has been a disconnect in how we become aware of what everyone is doing and keeping the momentum of the process going forward, as well as ensuring that all those with a vested interest are able to participate in the process. > > We all agreed that we must begin to identify who are the stakeholders and take steps immediately to open up the process. To that end, a new open mailing list will be created and Alan will create a wiki page where we will collect all the relevant information for the foundation creation. Relevant points and concerns of the stakeholders will be listed and the progress of the creation will be documented. > > **Membership Approval Concerns** > > Membership approval team members expressed concern about the clarity of the rules for consideration and eligibility. > > In the current rules, it states that a membership application is processed after receiving four votes. It was unclear whether that meant four votes in sum or four votes of either positive or negative. With a minor edit of the rules, we stated that an application is considered processed once it has received either four positive votes or four negative votes. > > Additionally, there was concern about a recent email request to process a particular application expeditiously. Team members felt this was an inappropriate breach of protocol and that all applications are equal and that no single application should be placed ahead of existing applications. We agreed and declared that henceforth, such requests should not be honored. > > **Where do we fail?** > > Our regular topic to identify areas where we fail and can quickly remedy brought up a topic of concern regarding communication. To this, we agreed that the Board will begin regularly posting summaries of meetings (which is what you are reading now.) > > We also took a general board action item to review [opensuse.org product category in openFATE](https://features.opensuse.org/statistic/product/opensuse.org) to ensure we stay on top of âWhere do we fail?â concerns that are not brought up during board meetings. > > Read here for the [full meeting transcript](//community.opensuse.org/meetings/opensuse-project/2010/opensuse-project.2010-12-15-19.01.log.html). > > **Next Meeting** > > With the holidays coming up, we will have our next Board meeting on 12 January, 2011. > >\n\n** [openSUSE Announces Fifth Development Milestone with Kernel Interactivity Patch](//news.opensuse.org/2010/12/23/opensuse-announces-fifth-development-milestone-with-kernel-interactivity-patch/) ** > > The openSUSE project released the fifth of six milestones in the development of openSUSE 11.4 some days ago. **Milestone 5 (M5)** brings a wide range of updates, both major and minor. As usual, you can get it [here](//software.opensuse.org/developer/en). > > **Major Features**: > > * Kernel 2.6.37rc5-12 is the basis of M5, including the famous â200 lineâ per tty task groups patch to improve desktop interactivity, and featuring the almost-complete removal of the so-called âBig Kernel Lockâ, which should improve scalability. This kernel supports new drivers, including Broadcom wireless and updated open-source graphics drivers, and a host of the usual other improvements. > > * Libzypp 8.10.2 adds improved support and fixes for metalinks, the multiple download URL specification. > > * On the desktop, the KDE Platform makes the leap to version 4.6 beta with many improvements in the UI and underlying infrastructure. This includes a complete rewrite of Kontact and is undergoing heavy testing. There is a serious chance KDE PIM 4.6 will not make it into the final openSUSE 11.4 release, testing and development is needed! > > * KOffice is updated to 2.3 RC superseding beta1, including the exciting Krita natural media painting app. Meanwhile OpenOffice.org is removed, having been succeeded by LibreOffice which is updated to 3.3.0.1. > > * GNOME 2.32.1 is now available as the 2.32.2 is the final version planned for openSUSE 11.4, which is notable for being the last stable release before GNOME 3 in March. > > * GNUCash 2.4 RC comes with a new complete dress-up. > > * Pidgin updates fixes several MSN and ICQ issues. > > * In the Virtualization area, available now are kernel-xen 2.5.37 features and kernel-ec2 2.6.37 with improvements for cloud sync services and Virtual Box 4 Beta including USB devices support and more than 2GB RAM support on 32 bit guest, Intel HD Audio, asynchronous I/O for iSCSI, VMDK, VHD and Parallels image support. > > * systemd 15 provides aggressive parallelization capabilities to start multiple daemons at the same time with dependencies which offers improvements to the boot times on some systems. More testing (and porting of init scripts) is still needed for systemd, which will most likely make it into 11.4 as experimental and optional feature. > > **Get it!** > > A list of most annoying bugs is being compiled; please check it before installing. We look forward to your bug reports and test experiences!

Right before christmas, KDE has published the first candidate for the upcoming release of KDE 4.6.0. The focus at this stage is on fixing bugs and completing translations and artwork. As such, the rework of the Oxygen icon set is nearing completion, many bugs reported by testers in the past weeks have been fixed and stabilization is still in full swing. KDE's release team has decided to not include the new release of KDE-PIM, containing the Kontact groupware client and the new KMail2 which is based on the Akonadi groupware cache in this release due to open issue with migration of large sets of data from the traditional client. These bugs are being worked on as we speak, but the risk at this point is too high to include the new Kontact in the 4.6.0 release. Therefore, it has been decided to release KMail2 and its companions together with one of the subsequent 4.6 releases, likely 4.6.1 one month later. A 3rd beta version of the kdepim module is available already. As the other components of the frameworks, workspaces and applications are nearing release date, KDE encourages testers to give their favorite software some final thorough testing. The last chance for feedback will be the second release candidate, planned for January, 5th 2011. The final release of 4.6.0 will be [available](//www.kdedevelopers.org/node/4365) on January, 26th 2011. > >\n\n> ![](//kde.org/announcements/announce-4.6-beta2_thumb.png) >\n\n> > To find out more about the KDE Plasma desktop and applications, please also refer to the [4.5.0](//www.kde.org/announcements/4.5/), [4.4.0](//www.kde.org/announcements/4.4/), [4.3.0](//www.kde.org/announcements/4.3/), [4.2.0](//www.kde.org/announcements/4.2/), [4.1.0](//www.kde.org/announcements/4.1/) and [4.0.0](//www.kde.org/announcements/4.0/) release notes. > > KDE, including all its libraries and its applications, is available for free under Open Source licenses.

Some feel Ubuntu is dumbed down and oversimplified, while many others think it's innovative and user-friendly. Where ever you fall in the debate, one developer thinks some elements of Ubuntu should land into openSUSE. In fact, he has packaged up and pushed them to openSUSE:Contrib. > > **Nelson Marques**, Fedora and openSUSE contributor, thinks Ubuntu indicators are the bee's knees. Actually, since Ubuntu is the dominant distribution in his corner of the world he thinks using some of its more familiar elements might help users migrate to openSUSE.

Rather than rotting the brain, computer games are interactive, teach essential life skills, and can stimulate learning. They also have been proven to enhance skills such as creativity, cooperation, teamplay, as well as encouraging innovative and strategic thinking and improving hand-eye coordination. > > Linux is not championed as a viable gaming platform in many communities, in part because of its smaller user base and the relatively low number of commercially supported native Linux games that are released each year. However, there are a number of encouraging developments on this front. For example, the Unigine engine should enable developers to produce high-quality 3D games with up-to-date visuals and advanced rendering. One title to be released using this engine is OilRush. This eagerly awaited title fuses a classical real time strategy with a Tower Wars genre. > > Notwithstanding these developments, Linux has an ever-expanding library of tens of thousands of free games, many of which are released under an open source license.

In any case, here are my top five favorite Linux distributions for 2010, in no real order. > > > > 1. [MEPIS](//www.mepis.org/) > > SimplyMEPIS has always been one of my favorite distributions for several reasons. SimplyMEPIS was one of the first to understand that looks do matter and so does out of the box functionality. It includes proprietary drivers, codecs, and browser plugins that make using Linux enjoyable. It leans toward the conservative side concerning new version of its components, but that makes for an extremely stable operating system. In all its years I only ran into one release that gave me any trouble, and that was about three or four years ago - possibly when it went through its Ubuntu phase. It is truly one of the best. > > 2. [openSUSE](//www.opensuse.org/) > > openSUSE has been one of my favorites since it first opened up to community involvement in 2005. Novell's agreement with Microsoft did damper my enthusiasm a bit, but the distro itself remains one of the most polished and professional offerings we have. It just has a commercial feel to it. Like SimplyMEPIS, I only encountered one release that gave me any trouble. Otherwise, its been a slick and attractive distro. I don't run it full time mainly because I'd have to hunt up some one-clicks (that are available for openSUSE) or install codecs and stuff myself to get going and then worry about those updates. But it always remains high on my radar. I follow its development very closely. I'm a little worried about what will become of it despite assurances. But as long as it lives, so will my admiration.

As an example, Ubuntu uses its Synaptic, Fedora uses Yum, Gentoo uses Portage, and OpenSUSE uses YaST. > > YaST stands for âYet another Setup Toolâ. YaST is an easy to use package management system for Linux distributions that support rpm based packages. Although YaST features in many commercial Linux distributions, it is free and open source software released under GPL. Therefore, it is free to be used by any party interested. > > YaST features many functionality the advanced package management tools offer. Letâs take the appearance as an example. YaST offers the end users both a GUI front-end as well as CLI front-end. The CLI front-end is especially useful for the installation done through networks where everything is performed through a terminal or a command line interface. Due to this support, the installation of OpenSUSE systems can be done over slow Internet connections and while the X server is not present in the system (such as a server installation).

First, reports leaked out that Yahoo was shutting the site down. Then the Delicious team [fired back](//blog.delicious.com/) saying essentially don't worry, all is well â we're simply getting sold off. That's cold comfort if you use the service to manage and tag a large collection of links, though. If you're not comfortable with the uncertainty, what better solution is there than installing your own open source replacement? > > Running your own Web bookmarking application has two key advantages over a proprietary commercial service. First, you can change and adapt the system to fit your way of working. Don't care about sharing your collection with the world at large? You can run a single-user instance and keep your bookmarks private. Second, you can host it on your own server, whether a small box in your closet at home, or on a co-located hosting plan â either way, you're in control. > > There are several Web-based bookmarking applications suitable for running on a LAMP server setup, but the option that most closely matches the Delicious service is [Scuttle](//sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/). It implements the Delicious API, supports multiple user accounts, and even allows you to import your bookmark collection from Delicious. Scuttle requires MySQL and PHP, and the most recent release is version 0.8.0, from December 21st of 2010. That is recent enough that although some Linux distributions provide builds through their package management systems, most will not have caught up yet. > > That means you'll have to grab a [source package](//sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/files/) from the project's Web site if you want to run the latest and greatest, but don't let it frighten you away. As a pure LAMP app, you don't have to worry about compilation â the setup process is straightforward. We'll take a look at installing and configuring the basic Scuttle application, then talk about some alternatives, including an interesting Scuttle derivative.
