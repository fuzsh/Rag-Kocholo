If you didn’t hear yet, Novell has agreed to be acquired by Attachmate Corporation. What does that mean for the openSUSE Project? We don’t know exactly yet because our crystal ball is currently in the shop and therefore fortune-telling is not our greatest talent However, we have other talents: we are a software developer community and we’re here to work on one of the greatest GNU/Linux distributions and other world class software distribution tools to advance Free and Open Source software together with the global FOSS community!\n\nFor now, we don’t know much about Attachmate, we have had no dealings with them yet and, as Novell is a publicly traded company, all of this is as new to us as to anyone else. But the openSUSE Project has had, since its beginning, a very vibrant cooperation with Novell, especially with Novell’s SUSE business, and we are looking forward to continuing this once Novell and SUSE become part of Attachmate! Our best wishes go out to the people of our community that are employed by Novell and SUSE, may this bring nothing but good things for you and your careers.\n\nThe second part of the deal relates to the intellectual property that is changing hands. Our hope is that this does not add to the minefield that software patents are today for Free and Open Source software developers. The openSUSE Board generally believes, like the rest of the global FOSS community, that software patents impede innovation and are inconsistent with Open Source and Free Software.\n\nhttp://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/geekoandco21.png\n\nWhat makes us proud is that Attachmate wants to further and strengthen the SUSE brand, which is based also on products and technology built by the openSUSE Project. Furthermore we are more than willing and looking forward to teaching another corporation about the principles, values and strengths of the Free and Open Source software development model. If you are reading this as an Attachmate employee, we would like to encourage you to just swing by and talk to us about the opportunites we can offer you to participate in this project!\n\nAnd apart from all that it’s business as usual and we are continuing to work on, rather than predicting, the future of this project and have a lot of fun!\n\nBy the way if you wonder what that means practically, the next step into the future of this project is described in the post: Our great bug squashing day on Saturday. See you there!\n\nYour openSUSE Board\n\nAs in the original post, I first of all do hope everything works out okay for the people employed by Novell and who are effected by this, will be some worrying weeks for them I am afraid\n\nSecondly I am sure Opensuse survives, and by the post made by Attachmate I feel it will.\n\nThirdly the IP, and specifically the parts that Novell owned and that stopped the whole SCO case, even if it does not go to the CPTN Holding but goes to Attachmate then it still is a sword of Damocles, who is gone say that Attachmate will fight as hard and brave as Novell did to the likes of SCO. That whole part of the IP should end up with a FFOS organisation so that nobody has to worry about it ever."
