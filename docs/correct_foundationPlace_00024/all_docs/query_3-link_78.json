        "text": "VMware just announced the end-of-availability for a number of its products. The company just listed a large number of mainstream products that are now end-of availability due to the Broadcom acquisition and the transition to subscription models. Products on this latest announcement are going to be felt by a large number of STH readers.\n\nVMware End of Availability on Many VMware vSphere Editions\n\nWe are sourcing this from VMware KB 96168. All licensing options for the products below are end of availability (EOA) unless otherwise noted. When it comes to renewals, VMware is going to offer subscriptions for customers. Here is the EOA list from the VMware KB article:\n\nProducts (all editions and pricing metrics) VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus VMware vSphere+ VMware vSphere Standard (excluding subscription) VMware vSphere ROBO VMware vSphere Scale Out VMware vSphere Desktop VMware vSphere Acceleration Kits VMware vSphere Essentials Kit VMWare vSphere Essentials Plus Kit (excluding new subscription offering) VMware vSphere Starter/Foundation VMware vSphere with Operations Management VMware vSphere Basic VMware vSphere Advanced VMware vSphere Storage Appliance VMware vSphere Hypervisor VMware Cloud Foundation (excluding new VCF subscription offering) VMware Cloud Foundation for VDI VMware Cloud Foundation for ROBO VMware SDDC Manager VMware vCenter Standard VMware vCenter Foundation VMware vSAN VMware vSAN ROBO VMware vSAN Desktop VMware HCI Kit VMware Site Recovery Manager VMware Cloud Editions/Cloud Packs VMware vCloud Suite VMware Aria Suite (formerly vRealize Suite) VMware Aria Universal Suite (formerly vRealize Cloud Universal) vMware Aria Suite Term VMware Aria Operations for Networks (formerly vRealize Network Insight) VMWare Aria Operations for Networks Universal (formerly vRealize Network Insight Universal) VMware vRealize Network Insight ROBO VMWare Aria Operations for Logs (formerly vRealize Log Insight) VMware vRealize Operations 8 Application Monitoring Add-On VMware Aria Operations VMware Aria Automation VMware Aria Automation for Secure Hosts add-on (formerly SaltStack SecOps) VMware vRealize Automation SaltStack SecOps add-on VMware Aria Operations for Integrations (formerly vRealize True Visibility Suite) VMware Cloud Director Cloud Director Service VMware NSX VMware NSX for Desktop VMware NSX ROBO VMware NSX Distributed Firewall VMware NSX Gateway Firewall VMware NSX Threat Prevention to Distributed Firewall VMware NSX Threat Prevention to Gateway Firewall VMware NSX Advanced Threat Prevention to Distributed Firewall VMware NSX Advanced Threat Prevention to Gateway Firewall VMware NSX Advanced Load Balancer (excluding Subscription, SaaS) VMware Container Networking Enterprise with Antrea VMware HCX VMware HCX+\n\nThat is a massive amount of mainstream products that folks ask us about in reviews.\n\nWe wanted to see how this would impact onboarding new users. One prediction we made was that the Broadcom acquisition of VMware would follow a similar path to other VMware acquisitions and focus on squeezing more profit from larger customers at the expense of smaller customers. Something fun we tried was looking at our VMware vSphere 8 evaluation center that we used about two years ago, but never installed.\n\nThe trial for the product expired, and our options are now to do things like buy online. Since vSphere 8 perpetual is on the EOA list, our guess was that we would not be able to buy it from the online store’s “Buy Online” link. When we went to the store page, we saw only desktop options.\n\nAt this point, our option if we wanted to try VMware vSphere would be to contact a reseller or sales and get a subscription, which was not the model we evaluated a year or two ago.\n\nFinal Words\n\nIt seems as though the prediction when the deal was announced that smaller customers would be in for some churn is right. VMware’s shift to subscriptions is so abrupt that the simple small VMware buyer’s journey from evaluation to purchase for a core product like VMware vSphere is broken even a day after the EOA announcement went out.\n\nIf you are a smaller VMware customer and do not have a plan for migration, this might be a scary development. Of course, we would love to hear what our readers think."
