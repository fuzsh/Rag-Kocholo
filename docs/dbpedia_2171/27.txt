we walk for miles n′ miles

and we may never find the truth

if i only knew which way to go

in the next crossroads

see i told you we'll be alright

yeah i knew we′re gonna be okay

when life kicks you in the head

remember you're gonna kick back someday

no matter how.

how hard i try

i fail

to be the one that they hail

there's something about this city

something about that girl

something about the fever

thet′s gotten into me an′ her

we never go to sleep

and we never apologise

we're just tryin′ to make it through the night

tonight everything goes by the dice

yeah i know, we got a lotta nothing to do

but that's alright

let′s feed the seagulls

and take a dip in the sea

'cause there′s no one here who could see us

let's get it on
