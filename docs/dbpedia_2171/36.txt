That night I've been in every single street in this town And after that I took another round I was trying to get wasted in this abandoned station I thought I could trick myself away I was wrong and I acted like a stupid kid And I know I haven't changed I try to be brave but I wasn't okay I wasn't okay, not at all I kept it all inside, and began to fall chorus: Yeah, once upon a time Yeah, there was a boy who wanted to fly Yeah, one day he died trying Yeah, he said it was worth a try chorus2: Good morning everybody Oh how much I need to do I got to save the world and you know the rules I finally come back home (2x) It's getting harder all the time To get up in the morning You know I'm just trying to survive I got to take over my mountain and build up new bases Or I'm gonna get stuck in the mud I gotta get out, it's so empty here without you And I'm scared that you're not coming back My friends, I need you now so I wouldn't feel so lonely Lord, please give me something else to think about chorus chorus2 (2x) Oh yeah! Woo-oo! Hey! chorus chorus2 (2x)
