        "text": "Past and Present Press Reviews\n\n(Edited for all-ages audiences, readability, and this decade.)\n\nGeoff Carter, The Seattle Times\n\n“Attendees are encouraged to wear 1920s/1930s costumes, and you'll be treated to live dance and aerialist performances...and live music from the wonderful Nasty Habits, Seattle's best and likely only transgender cover band.”\n\nTJ Tranchell, The Seattle Weekly\n\n“The next time I throw a huge party, they are playing it. I can't think of anything better to start a party than a trans****** band that plays '80s cover songs. Billy Idol, R.E.M., the Cure, and more all were given the Nasty treatment.”\n\nJessica Price, The Stranger\n\n“The epic, transgender '80s cover band the Nasty Habits turned the room into an unhinged dance party after the girls took their bows and the rough-looking roadhouse crowd danced in harmony with the tran****s.”\n\nChuck Foster, Seattle Sinner magazine\n\n\"A few days later we found ourselves at El Corazon for Johnny Rae's \"A Fashion Nightmare.\" We jumped to the front, bourbon in hand, just in time to catch the tail end of The Nasty Habits. Talk about a mind-f***. 'They're a bunch of tran****s, g**damn freaks!' That's what some might say. But man, can these guys play! They returned to stage after a shouting encore to finish their set with \"I Wanna Be Sedated\" -- leaving a full house screaming and shouting for more.\"\n\nMax Mania, Peninsula Daily News\n\n\"Fans of any sort of pop, punk or metal from the previous three decades are sure to find much to enjoy in a typical Nasty Habits set, with the band doing killer covers of songs from dozens of bands. Songs by the Beatles, Blondie, the Ramones, Cheap Trick, AC/DC, Joan Jett, the Kinks and David Bowie are all in the mix, blasted out with passion by a band that knows how to get a crowd moving...never ones to give less than 100%.\"\n\nPast and Present Client Reviews\n\nKyle LeMaire, Executive Director, Juan de Fuca Foundation of the Arts, Port Angeles WA\n\n\"Electrifying, Nostalgic, and Irresistibly Fun - The Nasty Habits Deliver!\n\nFrom the moment The Nasty Habits hit the stage, you know you're in for an extraordinary night. They resurrect the spirit of classic hits with a vibrant, modern twist. Each performance is a high-energy journey through time, blending the nostalgia of timeless classics with the excitement of today's sound. They are more than just a band - they're a musical experience. Whether you're a die-hard music aficionado or just looking for a fun night out, The Nasty Habits are a must-see. Prepare to dance, sing, and be swept away by their incredible talent and energy..\"\n\nScott Atherton, Lead AV Technician, 7 Cedars Casino, Sequim WA\n\n“The Nasty Habits have been a bright spot on the Club calendar since their first appearance here in 2009. Well-rehearsed and professional, the band has arrived for load-ins and downbeat on time and prepared to work. Slacking off is not a Habit with this group of musicians. Fully focused on entertaining the crowd that always fills our dance floor, they leave nothing on that stage as the final chords, lyrics and driving beat fades. Since 2009 The Nasty Habits have been a favorite for our venue and a professional favorite of mine.”\n\nOlympic Pride organizer, Port Townsend WA\n\n\"So much fun with The Nasty Habits on Saturday! Closed the day with a dance party for sure!\""
