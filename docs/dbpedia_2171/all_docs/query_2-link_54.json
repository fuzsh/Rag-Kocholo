        "text": "While mudding the walls of an empty room in my house today, I listened to the Beehive CD versions of both the first and second Flock of Seagulls albums. I can only concur with my earlier opinions that these versions are terrific. They have real presence, with great detail and wide dynamic range, which is what I believe made them sound so good in a makeshift echo chamber.\n\nEarlier I stated I would compare the three versions of the album Listen that I possess, but to be frank, doing so has only led me to discover what I perceive comes in a distant second place. The Beehive is clearly the best. The recent Cherry Pop re-issue presents a really uncomfortable...er...listening experience, which is sad because it contains the epic extended version of the hit Wishing, a truly great song. The Superfecta Recordings version of Listen from 2004 (UPC 825597000925) is perhaps a tad better, but is not in the same league as the Beehive. Safe is to say, my ears squirm when I listen to the Cherry Pop and Superfecta versions, but are at peace on hearing the Beehive.\n\nI think that Listen presents a difficult remastering challenge in that it was originally intended to have a wall of sound. But the Beehive has risen to this challenge simply by letting the music speak for itself.\n\nAt one point, I had that 12\" vinyl single in its full 9 plus minutes of glory--and listened to it a lot--but sadly the platter is now gone. I was not aware that a version of it was available on the Flock of Seagulls Best of CD. Thanks jamesc . Interestingly, according to Discogs, the length of the extended version varies from 9:08 to 9:36 depending on which Best of you get. In any case, I will give this avenue a shot.\n\nI do possess a 2017 set, Remixes & Rarities (Cherry Pop, CRPOPD 179), by the Flock of Seagulls, which contains various versions of Wishing, but alas the sound quality is not what I would hope for. Different ears than mine might like it, though, as its mastering does seem a bit better to me than what appeared on the reissued original albums under the same label.\n\nBut back to the Best of collection: Does anyone know if any particular version of this disc prevails soundwise over the others?\n\nDidn't realize there were different edits of the extended version but I can confirm my 1991 US edition of the CD has the 9:36 version. I'll compare with the vinyl and will report back.\n\nI'm thinking the same thing. The original vinyl is around 9:12 and the one on the early Best Of is 9:36 (although some are listed as 9:08 on Discogs so there may be some variations out there). Both versions seem the same until around 5:08 and then the 9:12 version has a couple of small sections edited out after that point as best I can tell.\n\n#1 is the early US Best Of: A Flock Of Seagulls - The Best Of A Flock Of Seagulls\n\nThat was the first place I remember seeing the extended version of Wishing on CD and this particular pressing has the slightly longer 9:36 version. I compared a couple of other tracks off the CD and they're very similar EQ to the album versions so I don't think pre-emphasis was applied to the entire disc. Maybe it just never got a proper EQ since it hadn't been released before? Just speculating here. I wonder how it compares to the 9:36 version found on the 2CD set that VeeDub mentioned.\n\nThe rest of the samples are:\n\n2 - Remixes & Rarities comp\n\n3 - original UK 12\" rip\n\n4 - 2010 Cherry Red CD of Listen\n\nI was very surprised that the Remixes & Rarities sample was closest to the original UK vinyl.\n\nThere's something weird going on with #4... maybe one channel is out of phase or something? When directly compared with the others it sounds wrong.\n\nThanks\n\nAnd of course that's the one I picked....\n\nOf course you know I tend to go with the 'warmer' EQ's but I really enjoyed the Cherry Red for some un-Godly reason-weird\n\nI can say that I already got rid of my 2010 Cherry Red CD of Listen because the whole darn thing sounded wrong (I've addressed this in prior posts on this thread and elsewhere, I think). Now, it is interesting that the Remixes & Rarities compilation is from the same label. I kept it because it does sound better to me, not perfect, but better. I think for Flock of Seagulls it is hard to beat original vinyl of Listen, or of the extended Wishing, since the music from this album was so dense owing to its wall of sound nature."
