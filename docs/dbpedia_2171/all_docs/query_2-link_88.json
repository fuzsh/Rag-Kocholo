It's actually my, MUST HAVE, guitar.\n\nI love my current Les Paul, best LP I ever had, but quality wise BCR blows Gibson away. Well the 80's one. Actually, my Mockingbird Calibre was a pretty special guitar as well.

Tone like no other axe I've ever played. I don't know how to identify it exactly because there is no paper trail (BC Rich warehouse fire).

I think we need to hear more about this.
