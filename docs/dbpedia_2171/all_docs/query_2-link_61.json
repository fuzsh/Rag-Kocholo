LOOK NO FURTHER FOR YOUR PREFERRED TOOLS OF FRUSTRATION RELIEF! Pitch forks and torches, only 1000 ISK a piece. Step right up! Don’t be shy! Why just tell CCP what you think? Show them!\n\nConsidering how underwhelming the so far visible changes on the AF are, that team must not have had any time at all to work on balance. I don’t envy Jin’taan for writing this after that meeting. Learning this and then writing this must have been a blast.\n\n@CCP_Falcon (since you can’t ping CCP_Seagull)\n\nI don’t generally get upset at CCP, but the stagnation of the meta with its few dominant ships is frustrating and chips away at my willingness to invest emotionally, monetarily and time-wise in the game. Although it won’t make me unsub now, it makes me more likely to unsub eventually and I can’t be the only one in this situation.\n\nThat’s not good for you. This is a huge step backwards. Disappointing… Making vets less bitter would help player retention, for new and old players alike, as not-bitter vets are the greatest content creators. Come on CCP, you should be able to realize this too…\n\nI don’t understand people, why not enjoying an OP ship while it’s there? Why should every ship in EvE be useful all the time? Balance is an illusion and boring, within imbalance lies the fun.\n\nA way better approach is to rotate, and make a set strong, and in the next cycle, focus on another set and so on. I don’t want to change my ships and fits every 2 weeks. But I’m fine to do so every year.\n\n… preparing to fly AFs exclusively from Feb 13th\n\nNot everyone wants to fly to Flavor-of-the-Year(s) ship. People enjoy different play styles and one ship dominating means playing any other way than with that ship and the play style it is most suited for is playing gimped. That’s no fun.\n\nFurther, while I agree that stagnation is the worst, it is essentially what the current state of things in EVE. Punctuated by the much too rare shakeup. Worse, it is a stagnating imbalance where a few ships dominate and a lot of others are left in the dust. Having a balance team means things would be shaken more often, which, as you said, would be good for the game and, if we ever get to the mythical “perfect balance”, which we wouldn’t, then at least we would be stagnating in a state where all ships are valid choices instead of one where only a subset of ships are.\n\nAnd module/ship tiericide needs to be completed so bad!\n\nTL;DR: regular iterations towards balance is better than stagnating in imbalance for years with a few occasional changes.\n\nI don’t know, but typing @CCP_Seagull brings nothing"
