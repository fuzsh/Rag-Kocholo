        "text": "Seagulls, Superintendents, and Gratitude. I‚Äôve discovered that expressing gratitude is a terrific therapy for stress - and doing so helps me put things into a much clearer perspective. I‚Äôm grateful that I have a terrific boss in Steve R. Brown, hands down one of the smartest builders I‚Äôve ever had the privilege of learning from. Fortunately for me, he also has a wicked, self-deprecating sense of humor - enjoying both the giving and taking of crap in equal measure, with good nature, grace and deep laughter. Last week, a minor incident really pissed me off. Steve let me vent steam and take out my frustration on him‚Ä¶He laughed at my analogy and explained the backstory, giving me the context I was missing and needed to be able to understand the root cause issue. Without taking anything I said personally. This is a feat because I teased him that he is so busy he‚Äôs in danger of managing by the Seagull Method: Whereby upper management swoops into a situation, squawking and flapping, stealing what little joy the team has left - their ice cream - and just as quickly flies off again, shitting all over everything as they depart and leaving their subordinates to clean up the mess. Yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve ‚Äúgot some cheek‚Äù as my British friend tells me. Later that same day, I had another handful of irritating incidents in rapid succession‚Ä¶ typical for a superintendent. I didn‚Äôt manage myself and my emotional reactions well. Not well at all. I didn‚Äôt behave with congruency to my professed values, particularly having Respect For People. I lost my cool, I got angry. I told a subcontractor‚Äôs foreman that I was done helping him, that his botched work wasn‚Äôt in my scope anyway, that he had to be accountable for the consequences of not building to plan‚Ä¶ I was a real jerk and shot off my big mouth. We both took deep breaths, apologized to each other, and started over. Five minutes later we shook hands, saying ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôll all work out, ain‚Äôt anything that we can‚Äôt fix. We‚Äôll tackle it Monday, have a great weekend.‚Äù But the fact remains: In that moment, I wasn‚Äôt nearly the manager that Steve is. Not even close. Thank you, Steve: you set a high bar for your team, yet you‚Äôre always there for us when we need that boost to help clear it. I‚Äôm grateful for you.\n\n‚ÄúWhat advice do you have for working with subcontractors?‚Äù Tanya Steele üá®üá¶ posed this question to me this week and it‚Äôs a good one, albeit one that quite frankly I didn‚Äôt have much of an answer for. And that‚Äôs a selfish shame; I really ought to be better prepared to help others, I think. I‚Äôm not one for handing out unsolicited advice - I sure don‚Äôt like it when folks do it to me - but I‚Äôm delighted to share the wisdom of others that has helped me enormously in my role as a field super. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs working for me, and who I am learning these skills and methods from: 1. Scrum. It‚Äôs not just a fetish for neon-colored sticky notes! If you want to get organized enough to accomplish four times the work in half the time, you NEED to follow Felipe Engineer-Manriquez. Invest in getting certified as a Scrum Master, the impact on your work life will shock you. 2. Last Planner System. Our job as supers is to get the project built per plan, budget and schedule, and the single best way I know to achieve that is through collaboration as a team. We don‚Äôt have time to reinvent the wheel, though, so swipe a system that works. The best place to start, IMO, is with Keyan Zandy and Joe Donarumo 's book The Lean Builder. I'll post the link in the comments. 3. Takt Planning. It‚Äôs the closest thing to a crystal ball to peer into the future that you‚Äôre gonna find in this business, and it‚Äôs my not-so-secret weapon for planning work on site. Jason Schroeder and Spencer Easton have amazing content. The only downside to Takt for me has been how much I have grown to loathe and resent those way-too-long CPM schedule update meetings every two weeks... Thanks Tanya for getting me to think on this, and to everyone who gives so freely of their expertise. Have a great week, all, and keep em safe out there!\n\nTrust. It pretty much all boils down to trust, doesn‚Äôt it? Take this character. He was installing exterior balcony doors last week, a job that involves important details for waterproofing and air sealing. The balconies don‚Äôt have railings yet so anyone stepping onto a balcony must be tied off. That‚Äôs not a safety rule I made up, that‚Äôs an OSHA regulation. An actual law we have to abide by when we think about it. This guy went to the effort of putting on his harness and dragging a lifeline around but wasn‚Äôt taking ten seconds to tie it off to the framing. I mean, come on, that‚Äôs not even THREE seconds of effort with the equipment he was wearing and the site conditions involved. Not because he didn‚Äôt know better. Not because he wasn‚Äôt trained on how to use the gear correctly. I‚Äôd like to say it was because he was lazy, but it took more effort trying to be sneaky than it would have to just clip the rope. He was trying to put one over on me. I guess he figured that I‚Äôd see his rope from outside and wouldn‚Äôt know he wasn‚Äôt actually tied off. Here‚Äôs the thing: Obviously this is a stupid safety violation, and there were consequences for him, his employer, the subcontractor who hired that crew‚Ä¶ and by extension for me and my project schedule. What REALLY happened here, though, is that these guys broke my trust. If they‚Äôre trying to sneak this past me, what else are they trying to get away with? What details are they skimping on with the installation? Did they really run three continuous lines of sealant under the threshold? Did they really seal the corners of the rough openings correctly? How you do anything is how you do everything, isn‚Äôt that how the saying goes? I maintain that trust has to first be given. Not earned. Given. Once broken, though, it‚Äôs very difficult to fix. Like gluing together that cracked ceramic cup; Might be serviceable but there‚Äôs always that line, the permanent scar we can‚Äôt quite hide. We can‚Äôt cover up that reminder it‚Äôs been broken. Trust but verify‚Ä¶ Lot of truth to that. For me, I‚Äôll be verifying a whole lotta door installs this week.\n\nLast week was hard. As in it left me questioning my role and life‚Äôs purpose hard. I got into construction because I love building big things. Not to be an asshole. Not to be an enforcer of rules. Not to be one of those power-tripping pince cabrons - yeah, that‚Äôs my nickname; I have a reputation on site for being a stickler about safety - I‚Äôll warn ya once, but ignore me and next time there‚Äôll be consequences you won‚Äôt like. I want to study building science, not psychology. I want to find ways to be more productive, not how to influence people‚Äôs behaviors into doing what‚Äôs in their own best interest. I want to be relaxed and calm, not pissed off and belligerent. Last week, instead of doing what I love I had to deal with this BS. With one text message to their boss, I had five guys fired and escorted off my site Thursday afternoon because they weren‚Äôt using their fall arrest gear while working on the leading edge of a four story roof, climbing in and out of a boom lift basket fifty feet in the air. This wasn‚Äôt their first warning. This wasn‚Äôt new work for them. They‚Äôve had all the safety training and certifications and endured countless toolbox talks on fall protection. This was them being reckless and stupid and defiant. I fined their company, too; I don‚Äôt mess around, they need to step up and fix this crap. Friday morning we had a safety stand down. I told everyone ‚ÄúBetter I send those guys home to their wives and families unemployed with some explaining to do than unemployed and in a box.‚Äù And I do believe that. But still, for the crew, five friends and their families now don‚Äôt have paychecks. I won‚Äôt kid you: job site morale took a hit. My own morale took a hit. Schedule took a hit too, and I‚Äôm accountable for that. Having respect for people also means having zero tolerance for safety violations, I get it. It‚Äôs hard sometimes for me to keep calm and stay respectful, though, I gotta admit. First time I fired somebody - years ago - it bothered me for a long time. It doesn‚Äôt faze me at all now. THAT bothers me. These are people with families to feed, and I have the power to take their livelihood away from them with less effort than making a phone call, and I don‚Äôt even give it a second thought‚Ä¶ Have I lost a piece of my own humanity along the way? Fellow supers and foremen, how have you handled and recovered from situations like this?\n\nPrecisely!! Bravo, Hayden, spot on. I‚Äôm going to catch an earful from some friends in the contech sector for this remark, but here goes: Construction IS slow to adopt ‚Äútechnology‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt bring enough tangible benefit to the job site. Maybe we‚Äôre not dim-witted technology dullards after all‚Ä¶ maybe your ‚Äúdigital solution‚Äù just isn‚Äôt solving any important issues for us. I think about all the technology being used every day on my site, and the people using it, and it blows my mind. I‚Äôm of the age when we used plumb bobs and water levels for what now we use lasers to do. Cell phone cameras with mark up tools, voice dictation, QR codes‚Ä¶ Nothing ‚Äúslow‚Äù about the adoption of technology that works for us. If we‚Äôre not buying your tech, maybe you just need to question your assumptions about what our ‚Äòpainful problems‚Äô actually are out here in the field. Oy, that was a rant‚Ä¶ ;-)"
