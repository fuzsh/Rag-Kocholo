        "text": "It's not so much that you need a ground, it's that birds are tiny so don't have much body capacitance. If an ungrounded bird touches a wire, current flows through the bird's feet in to the bird's body until the body is \"fully charged\" - i.e. has reached the same potential as the wire. That's not much current. Conversely if you, even if ungrounded in rubber boots, touch an electric wire, current flows through your arm into your body until your body is similarly fully charged. You have 500 to 1000 times the body mass of a bird, so the amount of current it takes to raise your body to the same potential as the wire, hurts like a sumbitch passing through your arm. And with alternating current, it happens over and over, 60 times per second.\n\nSo, I don't know if we are talking about mains voltage or the output of an electric fence? Electric fences are very different from line voltage. Something like an electric fence is what you would use to shock an animal. They send out a voltage pulse periodically. The pulse is a very fast rising very high voltage (thousands of volts) about once a second.\n\nI don't think you will get shocked from an electric fence if you are very well insulated from ground. I have been shocked by fences before when wearing rubber boots. But the ground was very damp and there was tall wet grass. I can't be sure I was well isolated. And the fences are well known to become ineffective against animals when the ground is very dry or in snow.\n\nBirds do land on electric fence wires all the time and it seems to not bother them at all. I will also say that bird feet may not be very conductive, at least when they are dry. This may also help them a little bit.\n\nI also don't think you actually can get shocked from 240 V 60 Hz if you are insulated. I did see that one post on EESE from voltage spike where he says he tried it and it didn't feel nice. But I am not totally convinced there wasn't some other alternate path. Anyway, I won't be volunteering to try it. It would actualy happen 120 times per second, not 60, though.\n\nUltimately, I guess what I am saying is that adding the ground WILL make the thing MUCH more effective. But you may be right that some critters (such as people) can get a bit of a shock just from their own capacitance.\n\nI was about 6 years old and was visiting my Grandfather on his farm over the Summer holiday I think it was. He got me up early one morning and told me to get dresses and I was going to walk the fence lines arounds his cattle pastures with him. I pulled on my jeans and a shirt and put on my PF Flyers and some cotton tube socks. I ran across the road to the milkbarn where Grandad was just finishing up milking a couple of his cows. There was still a heavy dew on the grass but we took off as the rising sun did its best to burn off the slight fog and dew. We hadn't hiked the length of the pasture before my shoes, socks, and jeans were soaked wet up to the knees from the dew. GrandDad was wearing heavy milkbarn shit and waterproof boots up to his knees as was his habit. When we got to the corner of the electric fence my GDad put one booted foot on the lower electric wire midways between fenceposts and then grabbed the upper wire with his bare callused hand and spread the wires apart and told me to duck and step between the wires taking care to not brush up against either one. No problem and I waited on the other side to see him then just push down on the top wire and swing a leg over the top and step into the next field. I asked why he could touch the wire as he had and not get zapped by the electric fence and he said that his heavily insulated boots prevented the current circuit from connecting him to ground and he was not getting shocked. I told him I just thought he was a real tough guy and he laughed and grabbed the wire again to show me how he was not getting shocked but I would because of my wet shoes. That finally made sense to me and just to re-iterate I asked, 'But what if I touched you while you are holding onto the hot wire like this...?' and reached out and lightly put my fingertip up near the tip of his nose. You should have seen him jump as the spark arced a good half inch to the hairs on his nose and you could even hear the sharp snap of the bright spark. I got a pretty good tingle myself but I guess the tip of ones nose is pretty sensitive. I think that was the closest I ever heard my GrandDad come to cursing and I saw a brief flash of anger in his usually kind calm eyes but he just kept rubbing the tip of his nose and you could even smell the burnt hairs...\n\nHe only said, \"I think you understand how this works now, lets go get some breakfast Son.\"\n\nI was about 6 years old and was visiting my Grandfather on his farm over the Summer holiday I think it was.

YOU MUST GET A COLLECTION GOING....\n\nI want to be able to read the @Rasputin22 experience of life stories....\n\nPlease....\n\nWell a couple of years after frying my GrandDads nose using the power of the electric fence, I was at the dairy farm on my Mom's side of the family. GrandDad with the rubber boots was my Dad's father and his dairy operation was a small part of a farm that predominately grew crops. My Mom's brother had taken over the operation of a fairly good sized and modern dairy. He had even more electric fences to keep his 200 head from getting lost in the woods. The more up to date and higher output electric fence apparatus was housed in his mechanical garage and my cousin and I were fascinated with why it would pulse a red light and make an angry buzz on a cycle of about a half second with about a two second pause in between each power pulse. Uncle Jimmy explained that it was a transformer that stepped up the voltage immensely and then used a capacitor or something to deliver a powerful but short jolt down the miles of electric fence. That was an effective way to reduce the actual electricity usage and not really cause any harm to the cattle, or us cousins...\n\nHe ever took us out to the fence and demonstrated in a safer manner than I had done with my GrandDad earlier. I had told Uncle about that time and he went into more detail as to how the electrical pulse coming down the wire ended up back at the garage to get a boost something like PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) which is now used in electric motors for boats. He said that no electricity was really lost until a connection to ground (literally) down an animals leg or my GD's nose or even the time my cousin pissed on a hidden electric fence in the bushes. He even nudged a tall stem of grass with his boot until it touched the wire and you could hear and see the current pulses arc and burn through the green grass stem. He said the whole unit was cleverly timed and regulated to prevent such sparking and arcing from starting grass fires inadverdently.\n\nSo left to ourselves cousin and I were soon taking turns at trying to briefly grab the wire in between the pulses just outside the garage window where we could look in and see the flashing red pilot light to ensure our timing. We each go a couple of zaps but that was part of the fun of it. We were howling in laughter and pain as we got bolder and held onto the wire longer but pretty soon had the rhythm figured out and could successful get away with our little stunt.\n\nIt didn't take long for his little sister to come see what all the fuss was about. She was two years younger that her big brother and I was right between them in age. As brothers will do, he was soon daring and teasing her to grab the wire and he and I both would grab it like it was nothing. She knew not to trust him but when I could do it without any sign of distress or pain she finally slowly reached out and closed her fist around the wire! She jumped about 5 feet straight up and the shock made her involuntarily clasp the wire harder as her hand muscles tightened down. During the short off cycle she had time to complete her near ballistic launch and then land in the bottom of the soggy ditch just as the next jolt arrived. She was pulling back her hand and arm over her head but she couldn't release the wire before the next jolt repeated the cycle. It took my cousin and I about three shocks before we grabbed her and dragged her into the dry dustly dirt road alongside the ditch and fence line and she came out of her near electrocution at the hands of her brother and I. Of course her screams brought Grandma, my aunt and Mom from out of the nearby farmhouse as well as Uncle Jimmy and the farm hand from the milk barn. Jimmy tried to the furious womenfolk that the fence pulse generator was not strong enough to kill even a young calf or he would have dead cows all over the place. The women were not convinced and my cousin and I were in the doghouse for a couple of days.\n\nRead the part about the only electricfied wire is the top one and this old boy is only pissing on the lower wires!"
