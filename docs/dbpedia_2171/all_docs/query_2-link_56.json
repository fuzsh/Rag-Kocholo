Heres the deal , whenever I go out to eat at a place that food, popcorn, fries, ect. can be tossed or dropped, a place that feeding the ducks is OK, there are a 100 or so seagulls or pidgons. At Disney, 0, ZIP NADA, not a one. What do you think Disney does to keep them away? With all the kids dropping food and feeding the ducks and other birds you would think they would be everywhere. Where are they?\n\nFor starters, there is no such place at WDW. They strongly discourage feeding birds anywhere on property. Unfortunately, a lot of guests think it's 'cute' to feed animals with foods that aren't good for them.\n\nAs for where they are, Disney regularly invests in ways to try to deter the various birds from harassing the guests for food. I guess they may have found one that works better! :shrug:\n\nWe just got back from Disney, had a great time, but I noticed something odd.

However, Disney doesn't get happy if guests start feeding them.\n\nWe just got back from Disney, had a great time, but I noticed something odd.

Where are they?\n\nReal seagulls are NOT cute, they are flying rats (like pidgons to new yorkers) and people feeding seagulls is one thing that bothers me. After getting used to people some will come down and take food from your hand. Like Monty says Disney use many methods of keeping the seagulls away from the parks. One of the methods is a speaker system that guests cannot hear but drives the gulls crazy. Last year the one in frontierland was broke or turned off and there was a notable increase in birds.\n\nThere is only one place in the parks that I don't mind seagulls and that is in front of Living with the Seas and they talk.\n\nWe just got back from Disney, had a great time, but I noticed something odd.

Where are they?\n\nApparently you haven't walked around World Showcase. The last two times we were there (October and January) the World Showcase promenade was teeming with those white birds. They were circling and swooping and dropping \"bombs\". It was a nasty mess and very annoying.\n\nOr, perhaps they've fixed the problem since January. If so, THANK GOD!\n\nI completely agree with you\n\nThe seagulls are normally also a big problem in Frontierland. Ugh. I've seen them dive-bomb people to steal food from their hands. Plus, they ________ on guests. It happened to Love. Twice actually. :hurl:\n\nSeagulls are flying rats. Nasty mean and NO ONE should be feeding them. Sometimes I dread walking through Frontierland because I don't want to deal with the damn birds everywhere.\n\nThe seagulls are usually at WDW on a more seasonal basis. They tend to come inland during the colder, winter months. During our cold winter here in January, there were hundreds of them in World Showcase alone. Once it warms up, most of them, not all, migrate back to the coast. If you came to WDW in the winter, you would see just as many seagulls as you do ducks, ibis, grackles, etc.\n\nThe seagulls are normally also a big problem in Frontierland. Ugh.

Guy across the street had just sat down with hotdogs for his family and he held his in one hand and turned to his toddler in the stroller and turned back and it was gone. Those birds are fast!!!:lol:"
