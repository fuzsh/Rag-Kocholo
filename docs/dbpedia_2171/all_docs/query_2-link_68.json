        "text": "Did you get a battery?\n\nI asked for a discount code for all that i went through and they at least replied and said no\n\nLooks like the black one is sold out\n\nSelf discharge is normal with bike batteries, especially when new. Takes a little time for cells to balance out. You can find lots of info on it everywhere. Mine loses a little sitting, so does my scooter if left for long periods, like a few months. I just always charge both after every ride. No big deal. No, black ones? They will get more in. I'm ordering a new white one in a few days. I'm on year 3 with this one so, before it goes down I'll go ahead and get a new one. I'm adding that Seagull back rack to carry it. 12 extra lbs. battery weight. But I can lose that weight riding. Not bad, $350.00 for a battery every 3 or 4 years. Everything still works great on this bike. Great little bike for the bucks.https://tritekbattery.com/battery-expiration-self-discharge-shelf-life/#Battery_self-discharge\n\nIn my experience, batteries do discharge, but nowhere like the 1% per month number I get when googling the topic. And even 3 months at that rate is less than a volt on a 36V battery. This winter, I have batteries out in the garage at 30% of full charge, I just checked yesterday and all appear close to where I left them last year,\n\n.\n\nYes, I agree with tom's \"No\". They're fuzzing you over with that self discharge,\n\n.\n\nOn the other hand, I have had two batteries self discharge, and one was an Ecotric. Not the whole batteru, just one cell in each one that died and went to zero, causing the whole battery to shut down. It's not normal, but due to cheap cells with bad QC, high infant mortality, bad juju, so you should be getting a replacement if their warranty is good. I've heard that it's good if you don't get them ticked at you,\n\n.\n\nAt least they are talking to me about this current battery\n\nI go in with a very soft approach when dealing with things like this.\n\nI was within a month of the first battery being under warranty. I get the warranty period but I wasn't around my battery to check it every month.\n\nI had videos i sent them before about the led brake lights not working and again they said as long as battery had 51 volts they won't do anything.\n\nThey just quit talking to me. So I show them all the negative posts and even on amazon.\n\nCheck my post #12. Their battery was poor workmanship and they didn't care\n\nYou may have just gotten a lemon. I did, from them. But the new one they sent me has worked fine going into year 3. I'm getting another one today from them for backup. Too hard to peddle up big hills with no power. lol. I would play nice with those guys. They will give you another one. Offer to send that bad one back and see what they say. They may think you're trying to scam a free battery from them. Sadly, people do. I was surprised they didn't ask me for the bad one back. I found their tech people real easy and fast to deal with. Hope those same people still work there now. Customer service nationwide has really gone downhill.\n\nEcotric will stand behind the bike and every part on it for 18 months. If you got a bad battery, controller etc. they will give you a new one. If possible keep the batteries indoors during the freezing weather. Then soon as possible, use the battery. Let the cells work. Do like they asked and ride it for a few weeks discharging and recharging. I would bet that battery is fine and will hold a charge after it gets put to use. Good it shows 51 volts. If not , it will get replaced, no problem. Ecotric makes a real good bike for under $2000.00 and some people that paid much more just can't stand that. We have 3 of their ebikes and love em. I just bought a new battery from them last night. I got the sale. Saved $100.00. $350.00 for 1000w. Nice. If it makes it 3 or 4 years like my last one, great. If it's bad, they send a new one. No problem. Based in Cali, shipping is fast and free. Hope the snow melts soon so you can get out there. We just lost the snow here. I will be taking my new battery for test rides when it gets here.\n\nEcotric will stand behind the bike and every part on it for 18 months.

It’s the line of BS that got my attention. Two mediocre bikes the second being a backup makes no sense TO ME. If it works for you, all the best. Another gas toy kept off the streets. I like that.\n\nMy experience doesn’t match yours. I’m confident that the sort of riding many here do would find the Ecotric weak spots quickly. But in the end it’s whatever floats YOUR boat.\n\nMy bad, I didn’t remember we’d been down this path before. This time I’ll just accept that a few come here with an issue, look for help and advice and then just turn around and insist their experience trumps everyone else.\n\nAt one time I was critical of both high and low prices being used as a gauge for quality. Looking back the only thing that’s changed for me is a willingness to be helpful and skip the critique of someone’s personal choice. That said a pigs ear purse is still a pigs ear. I just hate to see the unwashed get scrubbed down for their hard earned dollars and find out they won’t get anywhere near the miles the fellow that waited, saved up. Maybe cut down on some treat to stash a more cash and get a bike that will deliver 10,000 and even 15,000+ miles. That’s never going to happen on an ecotric ebike, and if the buyer is happy, thats great. But for every fella boasting about their $1000 Best Buy there’s another with a BSO unfixable without spending near the original purchase price to repair."
