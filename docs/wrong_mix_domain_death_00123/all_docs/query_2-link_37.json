        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor, the actress who dazzled generations of moviegoers with her stunning beauty and whose name was synonymous with Hollywood glamour, died on Wednesday of congestive heart failure at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, her publicist, Sally Morrison, told The Associated Press. She was 79.\n\nIn a world of flickering images, Elizabeth Taylor was a constant star. First appearing in film at the age of 9, she grew up on screen, never passing through an awkward age. It was one quick leap from “National Velvet” to “A Place in the Sun” and from there to “Cleopatra” as she was indelibly transformed from a vulnerable child actress into a voluptuous film queen.\n\nIn a career of more than 70 years and more than 50 films, she won two Academy Awards as best actress, for her performances as a call girl in “Butterfield 8” (1960) and as the acid-tongued Martha in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” (1966). Mike Nichols, who directed her in “Virginia Woolf,” said he considered her “one of the greatest cinema actresses.”\n\nIn a statement reported by ABC News, her son Michael Wilding said: “My Mother was an extraordinary woman who lived life to the fullest, with great passion, humor, and love. Though her loss is devastating to those of us who held her so close and so dear, we will always be inspired by her enduring contribution to our world.”\n\nRead the full obituary article for Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nView a photo slideshow of images of Ms. Taylor throughout her career.\n\nAnd explore a timeline of events from Ms. Taylor’s life."
