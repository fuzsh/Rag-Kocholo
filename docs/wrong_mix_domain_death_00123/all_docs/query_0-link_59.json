        "text": "“The last movie star died Wednesday,” New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis wrote of Elizabeth Taylor’s death from congestive heart failure March 23.\n\nJoan Rivers said, “She lived a great life and died wealthy, unforgotten, with her family around her. Where do I sign?”\n\nTaylor was 79. She had a lifetime of medical problems. She required a tracheotomy in 1960. She had brain cancer in 1997. She went through three hip replacements and four broken backs. In 2004, she was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. In 2009, she had surgery to repair a leaky valve by using a mitra-clip.\n\nIt seemed reasonable to ask for a definition of congestive heart failure from Dr. Robert Greenfield, a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute, part of Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley.\n\nAnd he confirmed, “It’s an umbrella term that covers a large number of cardiology diagnosis situations – problems when the heart can’t perform efficiently and can’t meet the body’s needs.”\n\nQ. Many people, as they age, seem to develop congestive heart failure. Why is that?\n\nA. It’s pretty common and as the population ages, expect to see an increase. It’s a major medical problem and a concern of those who monitor Medicare costs. There is tremendous effort to focus on appropriate therapy when a patient is discharged with this diagnosis. The emphasis is on careful follow-up and medically managed treatment so that the patient is well-compensated and does not have to be re-admitted.\n\nQ. If there is, as you put it, “a whole basket” of potential causes for congestive heart failure, what can a person do to prevent it?\n\nA. It’s important to control the risk factors. High blood pressure, for example. Or shortness of breath or a valve problem that needs to be closely followed. Surgery can be minimally invasive. In fact, Orange Coast Hospital is one place that specializes in minimally invasive valve surgery so the outlook for these patients treated here is usually better.\n\nQ. But Elizabeth Taylor had so many illnesses and problems.\n\nA. Certainly, and the doctors were doing a good job, which is probably one of the reasons she had a procedure for a leaky valve in 2009. She needed to be protected from heart failure at that time.\n\nQ. I know what you are going to tell me when I ask you for a lifestyle that will minimize the risks of congestive heart failure.\n\nA. Well, there are so many different causes for the problem, the lifestyle obviously is to have the proper diet and exercise, proper medical treatment, care and follow-up."
