        "text": "When Elizabeth Taylor was the biggest movie star in the world, she was also one of the most messed-up.\n\nThings were so bad that she lived in filth and even got sick from it, according to a new book.\n\nIn 1958, Taylor was cast in 20th Century Fox’s “Cleopatra” — becoming the first movie star to be paid $1 million for a role.\n\nFilming in England was immediately beset by problems, including Taylor’s seemingly non-stop health issues.\n\nIn October 1960, things got so extreme that her husband, crooner Eddie Fisher, was paid $150,000 by the studio to get Taylor to the set, watch her diet and walk her retinue of dogs.\n\nFisher has said that Taylor was “popping pills and drinking most of the day,” according to the new book “Erotic Vagrancy” by Roger Lewis.\n\nMeanwhile, Fisher himself was reportedly addicted to methamphetamine.\n\nWhen writer Truman Capote visited, he found Taylor’s rooms “crowded with shedding cats and unhousebroken dogs and a general atmosphere of disorderly paraphernalia.”\n\nThe slovenly atmosphere seemingly affected Taylor’s health, Lewis writes, as the actress was taken to the London Clinic, placed in an iron lung, and diagnosed with “Malta fever” or “brucellosis, which is caused by the ingestion of animal secretions — unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat.”\n\nTaylor possibly contracted the unusual ailment from “slobbering” over her “innumerable and terrible pets, which shared her bed,” Lewis writes.\n\nThe actress was released, only to return to the clinic the next month with severe migraines.\n\nFilming was halted — but Taylor’s health woes only worsened.\n\nIn March 1961, she came down with a severe case of pneumonia that left her comatose.\n\nNews outlets erroneously reported that the “National Velvet” actress had died.\n\nBy the end of the month, she was released and demolition of the “Cleopatra” sets began.\n\nAll the existing footage was chucked.\n\nProduction was moved to Rome and a new director, Joseph Mankiewicz, came on board.\n\nSeven million dollars had been wasted.\n\nWhen “Cleopatra” filming resumed, Welsh actor Richard Burton joined the cast opposite Taylor.\n\nThe book describes a mink-clad Taylor arriving on set with Fisher, “two secretaries, two maids, make-up people and hairdressers.”\n\nBurton later wrote in his diary that her “breasts [were] jutting out from that half-asleep languid lingering body.”\n\nThe two began a torrid affair behind the backs of Fisher and Burton’s wife Sybil, who brushed it off: “He’s had these affairs before,” she told Fisher of Burton, “and he always comes home to me.”\n\nAs the lovers/co-stars became more flagrant, even the Vatican weighed in on their affair — labeling it “erotic vagrancy.”\n\nBut Taylor, Lewis writes, was afraid that Burton would break it off with her that she once attempted suicide by “trying to break through a glass door and had to be restrained.”\n\nWhen Burton did try to end things — saying, “It was fun, while it lasted” — Taylor took an overdose of Seconal and had to have her stomach pumped.\n\nThe two eventually left their spouses and married in 1964, but their fights were legendary.\n\nAmong Burton’s put-downs for the actress: “Mss T-ts” and “that fat little tart.”\n\nTaylor called Burton “a boozed-up, burned-out Welshman!”\n\nHe often mocked Taylor over her lack of formal education and not knowing Shakespeare.\n\nHer reply was cool: “I don’t know anything about the theatre, but I don’t need to. I’m a star.”\n\nMeanwhile, Taylor’s housekeeping habits apparently didn’t change during the marriage.\n\nLewis writes how, “in their wake was the pillage of an invading army — dog shit and dinner trays at the Plaza, New York, the usual mess of dog shit and empty bottles at the Grand Hotel, Rome.\n\nThe clean up from the animal excrement from the carpets, curtains, mirrors, and furniture at the Four Seasons Hotel, New York, took days.”\n\nBurton and Taylor were married for nearly 10 years, divorcing in 1974, before remarrying in 1975 and splitting up again a year later."
