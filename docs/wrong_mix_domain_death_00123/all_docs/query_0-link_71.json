        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor’s expansive jewelry collection reflected a life filled with love and loss. The actor was engaged 10 times, married eight, divorced seven, and widowed once. Her personal life was only marginally less colorful than the precious stones that shone from her many rings, necklaces, bracelets, and brooches.\n\nThough she had been presented with three before it, Taylor’s first real gobstopper jewel came when Mike Todd proposed to the then 24-year-old with a “not quite 30 but twenty-nine-and-a-half” carat engagement ring in 1956.\n\nWhile for most women, their engagement ring is likely the showpiece of their jewelry collection, some of Taylor’s were modest compared to her non-matrimonial rocks—she had been married to Richard Burton for five years when the couple bought the famous $1 million stone that was christened the Taylor-Burton diamond."
