        "text": "Tailored to Taylor.\n\nThe 1994 live-action version of “The Flintstones” had a surprise cameo by Elizabeth Taylor — and she left with more than just a paycheck.\n\nThe late actress appeared as the character Pearl Slaghoople alongside an ensemble cast that included Kyle MacLachlan, John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, Halle Berry and Rosie O’Donnell.\n\nMacLachlan, 65, revealed a tidbit from the film, dishing that Taylor had one strict request if she appeared in the prehistoric story.\n\n“The cast was crazy. [Producer] Bruce [Cohen] got Elizabeth Taylor to do that movie. It was amazing,” MacLachlan said during Jesse Tyler Ferguson’s “Dinner’s on Me” podcast. “She had to have a gift every day.”\n\nThe “Modern Family” actor, 48, was shocked at the admission, chiming in: “Wait, wait, wait, stop! She had to have a gift?”\n\n“A gift every day,” the “Sex and the City” alum joked. “And she had to have, in the dressing room trailers, everything was green, she had to have greenery around her.”\n\nHe added that the acting legend loved to receive jewelry in particular.\n\n“This is secondhand now. Bruce probably told me and said, ‘Don’t ever tell anybody that.’ Too late. It’s too late,” MacLachlan quipped.\n\n“The Flintstones” was Taylor’s final movie role before her death in 2011 at the age of 79. She died of congestive heart failure.\n\nCohen, 62, opened up about working with her following her passing.\n\n“The moment she said yes, we wanted to make it a special experience for her,” he told the Hollywood Reporter at the time.\n\n“Lavender was her favorite color, so we made lavender stairs up to her trailer, and we filled the trailer with lavender flowers for her first day of work. I had also been told it was a tradition that you gave her lavish gifts for the first day of production, so we wanted to do that as well,” Cohen said.\n\nThe “Silver Linings Playbook” producer recalled going to Taylor’s house for wardrobe fittings two weeks prior.\n\n“She pulled me in very close and whispered into my ear, ‘Darling, you know that I like gifts on the first day of photography.’ I said, ‘Yes, I’ve heard of this tradition.’ And then she whispered, ‘I like Cartier, darling.’\n\n“We didn’t have an Elizabeth Taylor gift allotment in the budget, so I went to Mr. [Steven] Spielberg, who was the executive producer, and I said, ‘Steven, I need you to write me a personal check so I can go shopping for Elizabeth Taylor,'” he added. “He loved that idea and understood why we couldn’t put it in the budget.”"
