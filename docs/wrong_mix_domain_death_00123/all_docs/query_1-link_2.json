        "text": "Dame Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor, arguably the last great female star of\n\nthe Hollywood studio system, has died at the age of 79.\n\nThe Oscar-winning star died in the early hours of the morning at Cedars-Sinai medical centre in Los Angeles, from congestive heart failure, according to her spokeswoman Sally Morrison. She said Taylor's children were at her side.\n\nDame Elizabeth, who had been in ill health for a number of years, was taken to the hospital with heart failure six weeks ago. A spokeswoman for the hospital said: \"She passed away at 1.28 [0828 GMT].\"\n\nTaylor's luminous screen presence, allied to a colourful private life, made her a mainstay of US popular culture for more than 50 years. She won her first best actress Oscar for playing the self-styled \"slut of the world\" in 1960s BUtterfield 8. Her second came courtesy of an electrifying turn opposite then-husband Richard Burton in the 1966 drama Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.\n\nBorn in Hampstead, north London, Taylor relocated to the US in 1939 and made her screen debut as a nine-year-old in the 1942 Universal comedy There's One Born Every Minute. She found fame as the perky child star of Lassie Come Home and National Velvet before graduating to adult roles with the 1950 comedy Father of the Bride.\n\nThe following year she rustled up one of her most vibrant and vital performances in A Place in the Sun. George Stevens's melodrama cast her as a spoiled debutante who bewitches Montgomery Clift's ambitious social climber. According to the critic Andrew Sarris, the film's young actors were \"the most beautiful couple in the history of cinema. Those gigantic close-ups of them kissing were unnerving – like gorging on chocolate sundaes.\"\n\nOther notable roles were in Giant, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Suddenly, Last Summer and Reflections in a Golden Eye. Yet Taylor's on-screen prowess was often upstaged by the ongoing soap-opera of her personal life. She was married eight times to seven husbands and sparked a scandal when she began an affair with the British actor Richard Burton on the set of Cleopatra.\n\nThe couple wed in 1964 and divorced a decade later. They remarried in 1975 and then split again the following year. Throughout this period they were embraced as the hydra-headed emblem of Hollywood glamour, their lives a whirl of ritzy premieres, champagne receptions and indulgent movie collaborations. \"It was probably the most chaotic time of my life,\" Taylor would later recall. \"It was fun and it was dark – oceans of tears – but there were some good times too.\"\n\nThroughout her life, Taylor seemed drawn to fragile souls and those in need. She reportedly saved the life of the notoriously self-destructive Montgomery Clift following a car crash in 1956. Spurred on by the 1985 death of her friend Rock Hudson, she helped found the American Federation for Aids Research and went on to raise an estimated $50m to fight the disease. More recently, she rode to the defence of Michael Jackson after the singer was arraigned on charges of child abuse."
