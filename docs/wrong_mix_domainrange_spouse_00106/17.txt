Born on March 15, 1979, in Dunbartonshire, Scotland, Pollyanna McIntosh’s early life was steeped in the arts. Her father, David McIntosh, began his career as an actor before venturing into the textile business. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Portugal, later relocating to Edinburgh, and eventually settling in Colombia.

Pollyanna attended St. George’s School for Girls, where her mother, Judith McIntosh, nurtured her creative inclinations. Reflecting on her upbringing, Pollyanna mentioned in interviews that her mother enrolled her in acting classes at the age of nine. Even as a child, she frequently played leading roles in school productions. She continued to hone her acting skills throughout her college years, maintaining her dedication to the craft.

At 16, Pollyanna McIntosh made her debut in theater and independent films, also appearing on television in the series “Taggart” and “Casualty.” In 2004, she ventured into directing with the play “The Woolgatherer.” A year later, she starred in the horror film “Headspace,” alongside Christopher Denham, Larry Fessenden, and Olivia Hussey.

In 2007, Pollyanna landed the lead role in the film “9 Lives of Mara,” portraying a young stepmother suspected of witchcraft by her stepson. Her role in the 2009 horror film “Exam” earned her a BAFTA nomination for Best Newcomer. Two years later, she portrayed a wild savage in “The Woman” and subsequently appeared in the movie “Filth” with James McAvoy.

In 2013, McIntosh starred in the detective film “Love Eternal” alongside Emma Eliza Regan, Roisin O’Neill, Robert de Hoog, and Amanda Ryan. Following this, her filmography expanded with roles in series like “Lodge 49,” “Hap and Leonard,” and “The Last Tycoon.” She then joined the cast of “The Walking Dead,” working with David Morrissey, Norman Reedus, Kyle Gallner, and Zach McGowan.

In 2019, Pollyanna showcased her talents as a director and screenwriter. She penned the script and directed the horror film “Darlin’,” featuring Lauryn Canny, Bryan Batt, Nora-Jane Noone, and Maddie Nichols. That same year, another of her films, “Deathcember,” was released, starring Barbara Crampton, Clarke Wolfe, Tiffany Shepis, and Ryan Fisher.

Pollyanna McIntosh is candid about her personal life and frequently shares insights with her followers on social media. She married actor Grant Show in 2004, but they parted ways in 2011. Currently, having children is not a priority for Pollyanna. Although she has mentioned in interviews that she is open to the idea of motherhood in the future, it is not something she is actively considering right now.
