        "text": "Shreveport's comic con, Geek'd Con, is set to return August 19th-21st at the Shreveport Convention Center. The 2022 Geek'd Con will be the 7th show in Downtown Shreveport since 2015.\n\nGeek'd Con is Shreveport's version of events like San Diego Comic Con or Dallas Fan Expo. It's a huge event to celebrate fandoms in the Ark-La-Tex. You will be able to shop from hundreds of vendor booths, participate in cosplay contests, win prizes, and hang out with friends.\n\nInside the event, you will find vendors and celebrities representing fandoms from horror movies to anime, and everything in between. There will even be artists on hand who specialize in fandom art. Not to mention comic book artists who will be doing custom artwork that weekend.\n\nThere will also be a huge week-long set of events surrounding Geek'd Con as well.\n\nOne of the biggest parts of the event is the celebrity lineup. Celebrity guests from film, TV, and the internet will descend upon Shreveport to sign autographs and take pictures with fans. You can find more info on that process right here.\n\nThe list of celebrities changes throughout the year. Mostly additions are made, but sometimes guests have to cancel their appearances due to filming commitments. Sometimes there are other issues that come up, with family or travel restrictions, but those are rare. Most of the time a guest will have to cancel when filming schedules change. After all, these are professional actors, singers, actresses, comic artists, etc...not profession convention guests. So their primary job is most important.\n\nWith that in mind, there has been a change to the Geek'd Con 2022 lineup, as Steve Agee will no longer be able to appear.\n\nYou can see the updated guest list here:"
