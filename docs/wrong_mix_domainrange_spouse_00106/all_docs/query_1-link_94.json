While we're still not sure about Rick's fate – considering the condition and position he finds himself in going into his final episode – let's just say that the previews haven't done much to make us feel confident that Rick's coming back for Thanksgiving dinners and Super Bowl parties.\n\nWith this week's episode of AMC's The Walking Dead 'What Comes After,' we say goodbye to Rick Grimes in the best way possible – and usher in a new chapter for the series that already feels new and refreshing. Check out our review and see why this episode was the right move…at the right time…for both the future of the series and its fanbase.\n\nSpoiler Warning: I'll be covering some themes and takeaways involving major and minor plot points from the episode, so just keep that in mind. Definitely not looking for pitchforks and torches outside my apartment.\n\nThe Walking Dead Season 9, Episode 5 'What Comes After': Rick is forced to face the past as he struggles to maintain the safety of the communities and protect the future he and Carl envisioned.\n\nIn the following scene from this week's 'What Comes After,\" Jadis/Anne (Pollyanna McIntosh) finds her \"A,\" Rick finds a chance at not dying – and the Walking Dead universe as we know it is changed forever:\n\nIn the following AMC featurette, the cast and crew discuss how Rick's near-death hallucinations bring him both a sense of peace and urge him to keep fighting…to keep moving forward…to wake up!\n\nWith three episodes remaining before The Walking Dead's mid-season finale, here's a look at what viewers can expect:\n\nStay up-to-date and support the site by following Bleeding Cool on Google News today!\n\nAbout Ray Flook\n\nServing as Television Editor since 2018, Ray began five years earlier as a contributing writer/photographer before being brought onto the core BC team in 2017."
