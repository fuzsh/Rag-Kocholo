        "text": "“Snowpiercer” Season 4, which will be the show’s last, has set its premiere date at AMC.\n\nThe final season of the post-apocalyptic drama will premiere on AMC and AMC+ on July 21 at 9 p.m. ET/PT. Seasons 1 and 2 will become available to stream exclusively on AMC+ on June 1, while the third season will debut on the streamer on June 8.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nYle Sales Swoops on 'Linda's Room,' a Finnish Drama Thriller About Sexual Abuse, Ahead of MipTV (EXCLUSIVE)\n\nGiancarlo Esposito Can't Save AMC's Haphazard and Predictable 'Parish': TV Review\n\n'Snowpiercer' Season 4 Moves to AMC After Being Scrapped at TNT\n\nIt was announced in March that “Snowpiercer” would be moving to AMC for its final season. The show aired its first three seasons on TNT before it was scrapped at the network in a cost cutting move.\n\n“We can’t wait to share the final season of this thrill ride of a series with this vibrant fan community and new viewers starting July 21 on AMC and AMC+, with plenty of time built in to catch up on previous seasons on a variety of on demand platforms and AMC+ before then,” said Courtney Thomasma, executive vice president of streaming for AMC Networks. “’Snowpiercer’ is an entertaining drama with a great cast and seeing how the ride ends will be a highlight of summer viewing worthy of a 1001-car train.”\n\nThe series stars Jennifer Connelly, Daveed Diggs, Sean Bean, Rowan Blanchard, Alison Wright, Mickey Sumner, Iddo Goldberg, Katie McGuinness, Lena Hall, Sam Otto, Chelsea Harris, Mike O’Malley, Roberto Urbina and Sheila Vand. Previously announced new cast members for Season 4 include Clark Gregg and Michael Aronov.\n\nThe final season picks up in the aftermath of the Season 3 finale, which “left a split of the train with Melanie Cavill (Connelly) leading the Eternal Engine and those passengers who chose to stay aboard Snowpiercer for relative safety, and Andre Layton (Diggs) leading the others on Big Alice who chose to adventure to the unknown, outside world of New Eden,” per the official description.\n\n“Snowpiercer” is a television adaptation of the graphic novel series by Jacques Lob and Jean-Marc Rochette, and the film from Bong Joon Ho.\n\nSeason 4 is executive produced by Paul Zbyszewski, Christoph Schrewe, Marty Adelstein, Becky Clements and Alissa Bachner of Tomorrow Studios, Matthew O’Connor, Ben Rosenblatt and Scott Derrickson, along with the original film’s producers Bong Joon Ho, Miky Lee, Jinnie Choi, Park Chan-wook, Lee Tae-hun and Dooho Choi. The show is produced by Tomorrow Studios (an ITV Studios partner) along with CJ Entertainment. ITV Studios distributes the series internationally.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in May 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in May 2024"
