        "text": "Season 4 of Netflix‘s Outer Banks has some new cast members.\n\nPollyanna McIntosh, J. Anthony Crane, Brianna Brown, Rigo Sanchez and Mia Challis have joined the cast of the show, which has been a breakout show for Netflix over its past three seasons.\n\nCreated by Jonas Pate, Josh Pate and Shannon Burke, Outer Banks is a coming-of-age story that follows a tight-knit group of local teens — the “Pogues” — in the beach vacation destination of the Outer Banks of North Carolina.\n\nCrane (Dead Ringers, Billions) will play Chandler Groff, a man darkly grief-stricken over the loss of his wife, who is welcoming to the Pogues on their latest adventure. McIntosh (The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, Double Blind) will Dalia, a revolutionary-like leader and worldly baddie on a plunder who comes face to face with the Pogues.\n\nBrown (Dynasty, Eastsiders) will play the biggest realtor on the island who previously worked with Ward Cameron in a successful business deal, she now has her eye on Rafe for a new venture and Sanchez (Animal Kingdom, Station 19) will play an imposing stranger with a piratical nerve. Challis (FBI: International, Clickbait) will play Ruthie, a wild child with a toxic streak who develops a close relationship with Topper.\n\nThe young adult action-adventure drama stars Chase Stokes, Madelyn Cline, Madison Bailey, Jonathan Daviss and Rudy Pankow and follows a group called The Pogues in a coastal town in North Carolina where the wealth divide is stark.\n\nChallis is repped by Karli Doumanis at Zero Gravity Management, Stewart Talent, and Moore Creative Artists from Australia."
