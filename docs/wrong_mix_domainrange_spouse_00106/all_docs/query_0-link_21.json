Martha, known by her husband as “Marty,” was an area resident of Sodus for most of her life and an area resident of Rock Stream near Watkins Glen, where she spent her summers for her entire life. She graduated valedictorian of her class at Sodus Central High School and then attended and graduated from the University of Rochester. She married Charles Franklin Darling on September 19, 1953 and they were married for almost 70 years. It was rare to find the two apart.\n\nMartha was a lifelong member of the AMCA (Antique Motorcycle Club of America) and the EMPIRE Chapter. She was a member of the First Reformed Church in Sodus. Mrs. Darling was a dedicated educator, serving on the Sodus Central School Board of Education for almost 25 years, as well as the Scholarship Committee. She was a motorcycle enthusiast, and both she and Charles still have motorcycles on loan displayed at the Curtiss Museum in Hammondsport, NY.\n\nMartha was an avid gardener, and if she wasn’t sailing or watching boats and birds on Seneca Lake, you could find her out in the garden, reading a paper, or involved in one of the 100s of jigsaw puzzles she enjoyed greatly. Her family was everything to her, and her entire life, even into her 80s, you could see her at her children’s and grandchildren’s soccer games, running events, volleyball, basketball, Boy Scouts, etc.\n\nMartha was predeceased by her husband, Charles. She is survived by two children, Edward J. Darling and his wife Susan of North Rose, NY, and Julie Ann Darling Sissel and her husband Mark of Rock Stream; and three grandchildren, Jonah, Isaiah, and Seraphina. She recently was blessed to become a grandmother again to Mark’s son, Matthew Harmon Sissel, and his wife Seyeon.\n\nMartha was a devoted wife, mother, and grandmother, and she loved nothing more than to spend time with her family. Even the day before she went to be with her Lord, she was pointing and naming family members in a photograph collage made by her daughter-in-law, Sue. Family was her rock, and she was the rock of her family.\n\nVisitation will be held on Saturday, July 27, 2024 from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. with the funeral service immediately following from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the Royce-Chedzoy Funeral Home in Watkins Glen, NY. Interment will be at Rock Stream Cemetery at 3:15 p.m. after the funeral service. The family is having a reception with food and refreshments at the family cottage at 4256 Kent Klub Rd., Rock Stream, after the burial. We hope that everyone can stop and come together to celebrate, remember, and share their special memories of Martha and her life.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the Martha Valorn Darling Sodus Central School Scholarship Fund or the First Reformed Church at Sodus, NY. Checks can be made out to the church, or for the scholarship to Julie Sissel or Edward Darling.\n\nArrangements are by the Royce-Chedzoy Funeral Home, 212 East 4th Street, Watkins Glen.

June 25, 2024 would have been his 64th wedding anniversary to his wife, Lois Reta Chapman Cutton. There were many more dates or events that he was discussing just literally a few hours before his passing.\n\nDon was deeply spiritual and was very active for many years in the Odessa Baptist Church Family. His spiritual walk was a great example to those around him. Among all things, his immediate family was always at the forefront of his actions and thoughts, and his legacy as a husband, father, grandfather, uncle, brother and nephew is grand indeed! Those left to cherish his love are his wife, Lois, and his children Donna & Tim Philips, Kathy & Shawn Crane, and David Cutton.\n\nDon’s grandchildren were of great joy to him and brought him so many blessings and joys. They include Abigail Philips, Joseph Philips, Evan Crane, Joseph Crane, Caitlyn Crane, Michele Slaven, Rachel Cutton and Eliana Cutton. There are several great grandchildren: Gianni, Carson, Blake, Madalynn, Landon, Aubrey, Colton and Cassius.\n\nDon was a proud member of the U.S. Army, having served in Korea in two different signal battalions. When in the 26th Signal, he helped build and lay line in support of the Korean peace talks that stretched from the UN base camp to Panmunjom. The unit was given a Unit Commendation for its efforts. He learned many habits in the Army that he retained until death. For example: his “jump out of the bed early, make the bed so tight you couldn’t put your feet in it the next night, shave, and emerge with a resolve to tackle the world” daily habit. It was fun to experience that every day!\n\nAfter utilizing the GI Bill to further and finish his education, Don taught Industrial Arts for 34 years at Odessa-Montour Central School. During that time, he was very active in the Teacher’s Union, acting as president for 15 years. He became active in the Retired Teacher’s Association thereafter, receiving the admiration of all of those around him for his service and dedication.\n\nWe thank God for his infinite mercy during Don’s passing, and for allowing us to share our life with this wonderful man. We will miss him and will always consider his life an example and a great one to follow.\n\nRelatives and friends are invited to call on Saturday, June 29, 2024 from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the Odessa Baptist Church, 111 Fowler Place, Odessa, NY.

He enlisted in the Navy right after high school at the age 18. Jim referred to this period in his life as a time “when I knew everything and could do anything I put my mind to.” He had a fulfilling welding career in the Navy working in countries like Scotland, Japan, and Antarctica. Jim retired from the Navy in 1982 after serving his country for 21 years.\n\nAfter he retired from the Navy, he and his wife Anita owned and operated A & J Welding and was known as “the man who could weld anything.” His most common welding joke was “I can weld anything, but the crack of dawn.” His work can be seen all over Schuyler County and beyond; these stand as a testament to his skill and desire to do the best job possible. There are many times he helped others for free or at a reduced rate. Often he would not charge churches for his labor, telling them instead that “they could pay him by praying for him. We all need prayers.”\n\nJim was a serious student of the Bible and always looked for the deeper meaning of the “Living Word” that helped him love God and his fellow travelers in this world. He never judged people harshly and found that by listening to others, he could hear the Lord speak to him. He could always find God in the Word, in others, and in Nature. He expressed this through his deeds, thoughts, and how he lived his life. He was a true and faithful servant as evidenced in all his personal and business relationships. He was the most generous, kindhearted, and giving person anyone could ask for. One could just imagine God welcoming him home with the words “Well done good and faithful servant. Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” And Jim’s reply to God might be, “I need to work, you got anything that you need welded?” Mitch Albom once wrote “Strangers are only family you have yet to meet.” Jim has met many people in his life that he has traveled for 80 years, all are family.\n\nJim was preceded in death by his parents and his older brother, Frances (Fran) Affeldt. Jim loved his family very much and was often referred to as “little Affeldt” when he was of school age because of the times he tried to emulate Fran.\n\nJim is survived by his loving and dedicated wife of 40 years, Anita P. (Sanchez y Perez) Affeldt; his three daughters, Theresa (Tim) Warne, Kimberly (Keith) Walker, and Michelle (Paul) Temerowski; and one son, Raymond Affeldt (Debra); his two sisters, Kathleen Knab and Julie Osborn Taylor; Paula Affeldt (sister-in-law); 11 grandchildren; 19 great grandchildren; and many loved nieces, nephews and cousins in many states including Oklahoma, North Carolina, California and Arizona. He loved them all very much and would do anything for them. He influenced all of those close to him in his own quiet and prayerful way; and for that we thank him beyond any words that could convey our heartfelt gratitude for his life.\n\nJames will be sorely missed by his wife and children and many loved ones and acquaintances. In keeping with his wishes, there will be no public calling hours at this time. A celebration mass of his life will be announced in the fall.\n\nThe family would like to thank the EMT personnel, Schuyler County Sheriff's office, and Schuyler Hospital Emergency unit. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to St. Mary's in Watkins Glen, the Humane Society in Montour Falls, or helping a stranger you meet along the road.\n\nObituary: Sherry May Hubbard\n\nThe following obituary was submitted to The Odessa File by the Vedder-Scott & Zinger Funeral Home, Montour Falls.\n\nSherry May Hubbard\n\nAge 74, of Watkins Glen, NY passed away on Friday, June 7, 2024 at Arnot Ogden Medical Center, Elmira, NY.

She married the love of her life, Gene, in 1950, and started her family. She was a homemaker, working at Westinghouse and in her father-in-law's “Gardiners 5 and 10 cent Variety Store” in Montour Falls, until she had her four daughters. She then worked at the Odessa Montour School in the cafeteria, and soon she started driving bus and took the school census for many years. She also worked at the Harold Lee Liquor Store in Montour Falls. Pat started a restaurant in the late 1970's called “Pat's Place” in Odessa, serving breakfast and lunch six days a week. After she closed the restaurant, she worked for Bradlees Department Store in the Cash Office.\n\nPat was a lifetime member of St. John’s Episcopal Church in Catharine and served on the Vestry and as the treasurer.

She received the Presidental award for volunteerism.

Paradiso Jr.\n\nThe following obituary was submitted to The Odessa File by the Royce-Chedzoy Funeral Home, Watkins Glen.\n\nNick J. Paradiso Jr.\n\nNick J. Paradiso Jr. of Watkins Glen, NY passed on April 30, 2024.\n\nNick grew up in Watkins Glen, graduated from Syracuse University, married Terry, the girl of his dreams, in 1967 and together they had three children. He spent his working years at the State University of New York with stops in New Paltz, Albany and Syracuse before returning to Watkins Glen when he retired. He took great pride in his work with the University and when he left his last post at the College of Environmental Science and Forestry, the Board of Trustees granted him status as Vice President Emeritus.\n\nHe served on a variety of boards including school boards in Guilderland and Syracuse, planning boards in the Village of Manlius and the Town of Reading, the University Hill Corporation and the Metropolitan Development Association in Syracuse, the SUNY Business Officers and Human Resource Associations, the National Association of College and University Business Officers, the College and University Personnel Association, and was a founding board member of Habitat for Humanity in Schuyler County.\n\nNick especially enjoyed spending time with his best friend Terry and the rest of his family, having his sons grow to become his friends and watching his grandchildren mature from babies to adults with lives of their own. He and Terry took several great trips, going across country by both car and train, to Mexico, the Bahamas, Hawaii, Alaska, Italy, France, and Ireland. He was a fan of the late President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who taught him the virtues of public service; the author James Michener, yellow Mustang convertibles, the movie Field of Dreams, the New York Yankees and anything Syracuse Orange. In his spare time, he played a little golf, did some fishing, read hundreds of books, and managed to coach several little league baseball teams, each of which was a variation of the Bad News Bears. What the teams may have lacked in on-field success, they more than made up for with learning the value and joy of being a member of a team.\n\nHe was predeceased by his lovely daughter Kristen, his parents Nick and Lucy, his sisters Mary Lou and Rosanne, his brother Bill, and his in-laws, Ken and Jean Nusspickel. He is survived by his wife, Terry, their sons Nick (Cindy) and Dan (Heather), son-in-law Chris Ricci along with grandchildren Joshua (Kirsten), Taylor (Kody), Zach (Hannah), Dana (Josh), Samantha, Daniel and Max and great grandchildren Kennedy, Kanien, and Ren.\n\nIn honor of Nick’s love for the fall season in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, the family will hold a celebration of Nick’s life in Watkins Glen in September.\n\nNick was especially passionate about addressing hunger in our country. He believed that nobody should ever worry about where to find their next meal. He and Terry were proud to support the Food Bank of the Southern Tier. Should people wish to do so, contributions can be made to the Food Bank in memory of Nick. In addition, or in lieu of any such contributions, Nick simply asked for acts of kindness toward others, whether friends, family or strangers.\n\nCondolences may be offered to the family in his obituary at www.RoyceChedzoy.com.\n\nObituary: Rev.

The residents brought her as much joy as she brought them.\n\nDonna continued her support of the Humane Society by volunteering at their store Wags to Riches in Watkins Glen. Wags gave Donna purpose and she looked forward to going there every week. It was more than a job to her. She loved connecting with customers and the other volunteers who became her dear friends.\n\nDonna’s favorite place to be was home, her “Little Yellow House” as she called it.
