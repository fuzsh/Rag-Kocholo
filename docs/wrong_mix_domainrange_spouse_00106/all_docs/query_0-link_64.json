The decision to kill her off from the show was made and given 3 days before the shooting for the finale began. In addition to this, 3 weeks prior to the shooting of the finale, the script was changed, scrapping her position as new leader of Woodbury.\n\nAccording to her Q&A at 2014 Walker Stalker in Chicago, she was contracted 8 seasons for portraying Andrea, before the decision of killing her off was brought to the table.\n\nInterestingly enough, she and her on-screen sister Emma Bell share the same birthday.\n\nShe holds dual citizenship of both United States and Canada.\n\nOn Twitter, she has her own fans team called \"#TeamHolden\".\n\nShe follows most of the members.\n\nShe stars in The Boys alongside Laila Robins (Pamela), Colby Minifie (Virginia), Jessie T.
