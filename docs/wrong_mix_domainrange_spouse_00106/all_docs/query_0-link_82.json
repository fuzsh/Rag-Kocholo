        "text": "Contains spoilers for 'The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live'\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Pollyanna McIntosh returns as Jadis Strokes in Episode 2 of AMC's 'The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live'. She appeared in three different 'Walking Dead' shows and has become a significant character in the franchise.\n\nHer entry in the latest spin-off series indicates that she might have an important role in it.\n\nIn Episode 2, Jadis, the CRM warrant officer, meets Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) in his apartment.\n\nShe knows that Dana is not someone who she claims to be, but hints she may withhold this knowledge, using it as leverage. However, she warns Rick that any escape attempt could endanger his loved ones.\n\nJadis Strokes' backstory was explored in 'The Walking Dead: World Beyond'\n\nPollyanna McIntosh made her 'Walking Dead' debut in season 7 of 'The Walking Dead' and her character disappeared along with Rick Grimes in the fifth episode of the ninth season.\n\nJadis introduced herself as the tribalistic leader of a \"self-sufficient\" junkyard group, that secretly trafficked survivors to the CRM (Civic Republic Military).\n\nAfter failing to integrate into Alexandria, Jadis joined the CRM. She encountered Rick on the riverbank after the explosion and handed him over to the CRM.\n\nIn Season 2 of 'The Walking Dead: World Beyond,' the early connection between Jadis and the CRM is clarified.\n\nIn the original series, it was uncertain if Jadis was a CRM operative, possibly operating undercover at the junkyard. However, it becomes clear that Jadis truly joined the CRM's ranks after boarding the helicopter with Rick.\n\nWhy doesnâ€™t Jadis Strokes report Michonne to CRM?\n\nRick and Jadis' complicated alliance is evident in 'The Ones Who Live'. As Jadis confronts Rick about Michonne's (Danai Gurira) return, she emphasizes the need to maintain secrecy. This implies that Rick and Jadis have concealed their history from the CRM.\n\nThere seems to be a mutually advantageous agreement between them where they are withholding information about their past from the CRM.\n\nDespite issuing threats to Rick regarding Michonne and his family, Jadis refrains from disclosing everything to the CRM, fearing for her own safety.\n\nRevealing her past association with Rick would reveal that she had previous ties to his group and possessed knowledge of the whereabouts of his loved ones."
