        "text": "Hey ManNics! Tobias here again, I hope you are all keeping yourselves safe and isolated during the pandemic. Aside from casting the X-Men for the MCU on our podcast, I’ve done my own personal bit of casting recently.. whilst waiting for a phone call, in fact!\n\nIf you do listen to The ManNic Podcast, you’ll probably know that I was a big fan of the 80s cartoon series THUNDERCATS, I do tend to mention it from time to time. So, whilst I was waiting for the aforementioned phone call, I decided I’d pass the time by casting a Live action movie of my favourite cartoon.\n\nHere’s what I came up with!\n\nThe key thing to casting Lion-O is to remember that, whilst he’s got the body of a grown (athletic) man, he’s actually a child, with that mentality. Lion-O’s story arc is really just one big coming-of-age saga. You need an actor that can incorporate that element. For me, there were a few options, but I decided to go for CHRIS HEMSWORTH. Particularly films like THOR: RAGNAROK, MEN IN BLACK and even GHOSTBUSTERS shows that fun, childish side to him, whilst not detracting from his physical ability. Perfect for Lion-O if you ask me.\n\nCasting Lion-O turned out to be way easier than the actual adult ThunderCats. Panthro was the next one I managed to get someone for though. IDRIS ELBA is my choice here. I can see him as the older, gruff engineer of the Cats. I can also see Elba wielding some nunchucks! Tygra was a little trickier but I felt HUGH JACKMAN would fit the role quite well. He comes across intelligent enough to be a scientist, and again is pretty physically impressive. Cheetara was the most difficult of the main players to sort, mostly due to having too many options. Wanting someone I felt could fit alongside Jackman and Elba, I opted for KATE BECKINSALE.\n\nI actually decided to cast some villains next, but for continuity reasons, I’ll continue with the Cats themselves.\n\nAssuming a live action movie would deal with the same origin story from the cartoon, we can expect Jaga to be involved - both alive, and his Obi-Wan force ghost-esque spirit. Being a Trekkie, it didn’t take me long to reach the casting of one PATRICK STEWART. Give the man a beard and a pointy helmet and we’re in business. His casting was way easier that casting Wilykit and Wilykat. I’m terrible when it comes to casting kids, but these seem to fit the bill. GRACE MCKENNA (she plays a young Carol Danvers in CAPTAIN MARVEL, as well as a major part in THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE) and JACOB TEMBLAY from ROOM and WONDER. Both of the young actors are 13, and think would work. The last Cat I decided to cast at this point was GRUNE THE DESTROYER. Easy casting here, I simply went with JASON MOMOA.\n\nNow, with the name ‘the Destroyer’ you can probably figure out that Grune is a baddie, so we might as well move on to my casting for the villains.\n\nI couldn’t think of who could play the mutant S-S-Slithe, but one I considered JACK BLACK that casting just fell into place. My assumption is the character will be CGI, motion capture much like Hulk etc... but Black’s voices and character would work I think. As for his fellow goons, I simply chose WALTON GOGGINS as Jackalman and MIKE COLTER as Monkian. Both actors I could see embodying the characters from the cartoon - maybe adding a bit more depth if running time allowed for it.\n\nFinally we have the big bad - Mumm-Ra. Now, fans will know he comes in two forms. A decrepit old mummy and a massive cackling demon. I would assume both would be achieved through CGI again, but still with a need for an actor to pull off both versions. Now, who’s the king of mo-cap? ANDY SERKIS! From his character work as Gollum in LORD OF THE RINGS and Cesar in PLANET OF THE APES, I reckon he’d make for an awesome Mumm-Ra.\n\nSo there you have it, those are twelve casting options for a live action THUNDERCATS. Now, I think I did pretty well, but what do you think? Can you suggest someone better for any of the roles mentioned?\n\nIf I have to wait for another phone call I may end up casting a lot more from the show. In fact, my mind is already ticking some options over..."
