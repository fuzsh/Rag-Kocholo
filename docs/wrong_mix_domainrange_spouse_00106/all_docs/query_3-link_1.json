(I consider myself open-minded, but draw the line at interspecies throupling.) A decade ago, on our first date, a date that went from lunch to all day, I told Polly I loved her. She thought I was nuts. Which I am, but I knew I was in love. That big kind of love. I had never met anyone as amazing as her. We became a couple, but unfortunately, we broke up after a few starts and stops. Life went on, and we both found ourselves in and out of various long-term and short-term relationships. Through all of this, we have remained friends until now. The fire never went out for us, and Polly and I reunited after eight years. We got married last month while driving across the country, while moving my pet ducks from Chicago to Los Angeles. I have never met anyone as special as her. Polly is filled with love, kindness, and empathy. She changes a room for the better just by entering it. She’s hilarious and gorgeous and makes me laugh till I snort and my sides hurt. (She even smiles while cleaning duck sh!t off of a hotel carpet!) If I have any advice, it’s this: when your heart says, “This is the most amazing person I have ever met!” don’t waste your time listening to the logical, practical side of your brain. F*ck being logical. Logical is just another word for being scared. You’ll thank me later. I love Pollyanna McIntosh, and knew it on that very long first date. I got a second chance; you might not. And don’t feel guilty being happy as the world gets darker and darker. Remember, happiness is a form of radical protest because fascists hate joy. My daughter Tasha and her girlfriend Caroline flew in on a moment’s notice to Las Vegas and were saviors as we scrambled to put a wedding together in less than 30 hours. Tasha was my best man; Caroline was the witness. My ducks Sid and Nancy were in the wedding, too. Nancy as Maid of Honor. Sid, Best Mandrake. A big thanks to @thenickyurban for holding down the fort and to everyone else who pitched in and helped out. I truly have never been this happy. As I got older, I began to think my life was over, but it’s not, it’s just starting. I hope you all find yours.\".",
