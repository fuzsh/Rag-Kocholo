        "text": "Tales of Halloween is the latest horror anthology based on All Hallows Eve.\n\nReleased in DVD, Blu Ray and download last week, the film was a big hit this year at horror festivals and boasts an impressive lineup of talent both in front of and behind the camera.\n\nWe got to talk to one of the stars of this seasonal spectacle, Pollyanna McIntosh. Here she tells us about the inspiration behind her section of the movie, working with Lucky McKee and what sheâll be doing for Halloween this year.\n\nInterview with Pollyanna Mcintosh\n\nLove Horror: Tell us about Tales of Halloween and your character.\n\nItâs an anthology horror, so itâs ten stories in one film all set on the same night, Halloween and set on the same street.\n\nItâs been well received and the audiences have seemed to love it.\n\nMy segment is called ding dong and itâs written and directed by Lucky McKee And I got to work with Marc Senter who plays my husband. And weâre a couple who canât have children and in the face of that, on Halloween I decide to buck up and get my sexy witch costume on and get on with it despite all the children that are coming to the door.\n\nAnd it doesnât go as planned.\n\nAnd there are elements of the Wizard of Oz and Hansel and Gretle in there. And itâs a wild ride!\n\nThatâs what I really enjoyed about the film, the links to fairy tales and classic stories.\n\nYeah, itâs funny because Iâve been writing a lot more lately and speaking to Lucky about the process. And the bit that really stuck out for me was that he said always look at the ancient stories and fairy tales because theyâre the root of really good story telling and I think thatâs clear in his work. Heâs not afraid to make it clear either. He never patronises the audience.\n\nItâs quite a tense relationship that you and your on screen husband have. And in the film you display the full range of emotions, from happiness to sadness and rage. Was it a challenge because of that?\n\nI think it was a challenging script because thereâs so much in there and there some real tense, heavy and real horror with the grief of not being able to conceive, the domestic violence angle, the fury and the rage. But also the sadness of the whole situation. Then the script demanded the melodrama as well. The comedy.\n\nBut as with everything that Iâve seen Lucky do, and in my experience of working with him, it doesnât become difficult. It becomes fun to explore and discover. And he also puts a lot of faith in his actors. So Mark and I got to hang out and rehearse, giving us a relationship way before we started on set.\n\nAnd he said âgive me your notes, what do you think? Tell me about any lines that donât workâ.\n\nHe has confidence in you and I feel very safe in his hands.\n\nThe makeup was actually designed by Luckyâs wife. Sheâs an artist that does amazing digital paintings and she and Lucky are collaborating on all sorts of weird and wonderful stuff. But she conceived the look of that character, so I was being asked to take photos of my hands and I ended up doing a little video of something that I was playing with for the character, with all the grinning and scary smiles. And so that influenced it as well. So it was just a great experience.\n\nIt seems pretty obvious from the recepion of the films that youâve made with Lucky that you guys work well together.\n\nWell itâs great if you think that and thereâs a lot of trust there that is freeing and creative and heâs very respectful of crew aswell. We had the same DP from The Woman, Alex Vendler doing it, who is always brilliant and inventive and amazing under pressure.\n\nAnd we had a great set designer, Christa Gall, who worked on the Woman aswell. And I worked with her on Offspring too, so weâre all friends. And hard workers.\n\nThis is the first time that youâve been in an anthology. Youâll probably be a bit biased now, but how do you feel about horror anthologies?\n\nWell, I havenât seen any, other than Tales of Halloween. Iâm a wuss and I get very scared of watching horror movies. So I only watch them when Iâm feeling brave. So I havenât seen the ABCâs of Death, I mean, titles like that just scare me. Whereas Tales of Halloween is a bit more fun I think.\n\nSo on the subject of Halloween, do you celebrate it yourself?\n\nI love Halloween, absolutely love it. I mean obviously, it would be weird if an actress didnât like dressing up. I really love dressing up and being silly and enjoying the togetherness, like when everyoneâs in the same weird positionâ¦ Itâs a really lovely feeling of togetherness. So itâs a lot of fun.\n\nLast year I went to âa Halloween show in L.A. My ex boyfriend was hosting it and it was a riot. It was all Mexican wrestling and burlesque Dita was playing and she had her batwings on, and it was just brilliant. Sheâs amazing.\n\nAnd the year before I got to go to Camden to Power Ballads Halloween night which was hilarious. Everyone dressed up and singing along to power ballads. So yeah, I get right into it.\n\nHow about this year? Do you have any plans?\n\nIâm going to go to a party but Iâm a bit disappointed because I donât have anything weirder to offer. But things generally tend to come together. Iâm going to go as Diane Laddâs character in Wild at Heart â the mother when she gets all the lipstick all over her face and she has the old phone and the burnt nails, big hair.\n\nIf only you could have kept some of your costume from Tales of Halloween.\n\nYeah, the whole red faced thing and melodrama of wild at Heart influenced how I played my role, so sheâs been on my mind since then, so Iâm like âyes, itâs Halloween! I get to do her!â\n\nI always like to go as something really gross or really intense."
