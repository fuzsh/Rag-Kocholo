Assuredly a worthy addition to the director’s ever expanding horror catalogue, the series is framed by an opioid-pushing businessman Roderick Usher confessing to his sins after the sudden deaths of his six children. What follows is a character-driven exploration of family, karma, greed, corruption, and privilege told through a uniquely satirical and supernatural lens. Using the anthological format, the series walks us through the misdeeds of all the Usher children before killing them off in gruesome sequences that put “Final Destination” to shame. Although this series isn’t as buried in the horror genre as “The Haunting”, its production values are just as impressive and it has a consistently chilling atmosphere which makes it perfect for spooky season. What I find the most fascinating about “The Fall of the House of Usher”is the way it interweaves the entire canon of Edgar Poe's poems and short stories into its dialogues, visuals and episode titles which gives the viewers something to read up on after the end of each episode.\n\nGuiding us through “The Fall of the House of Usher” is a grand ensemble of both new and returning actors from the director’s previous works. Six Flanagan regulars play the Usher children — Henry Thomas, Samantha Sloyan, Kate Siegel, T’Nia Miller, Rahul Kohli, and Sauriyan Sapkota — each of who gets their time to shine as their character’s pasts and presents are plumbed to reveal the depths of their depravities. Equally captivating are the characters played by the newcomers to the Flanagan team: Mark Hamill, Willa Fitzgerald, Zach Gilford and Mary McDonnell. The main standouts, however, are Bruce Greenwood and Carla Gugino. Greenwood takes the spotlight as the patriarch of the Usher family who is equally sympathetic and despicable. Gugino, on the other hand, is a total scene stealer as the multi-faceted antagonist tying the whole tragedy together. \n\nWith “The Fall of the House of Usher”, Flanagan’s tenure with Netflix has ended on a triumphant note. If you’ve enjoyed any of Flanagan’s previous works, you are sure to get a kick out of watching this series.\".",
