        "text": "I had the pleasure to interview Pollyanna McIntosh. Pollyana stars as the community leader ‘Jadis’ on AMC’s “The Walking Dead”. She recently wrapped production as a lead in James Franco’s new film Blood on Wheels, which will be released later this year. Pollyanna also had a role in season one of Sundance TV’s “Hap & Leonard” as ‘Angel’, the spandex-clad killer. Pollyanna is also known for her multi-award winning lead in the Sundance Film Festival hit The Woman. Previous credits include her roles in Sex and Death 101 (opposite Winona Ryder), Burke & Hare (opposite Isla Fisher), Land of the Lost (opposite Will Ferrell), Filth (opposite James McAVoy), Love Eternal, Tales of Halloween and the BAFTA nominated Exam, among others. In addition to acting, Pollyanna is also an avid writer, having written opinion pieces in the magazines Loaded, Flux, Honeysuckle and her long-standing column for Crave. Her short film, the comedy Perfect, which she wrote, directed and starred in will soon become a feature film. Next up she will direct and star in an untitled horror feature. Pollyanna also co-wrote the crime drama Reciprocal Beat,which is currently in development with Traverse Media. In her free time, Pollyanna enjoys drawing, cooking, dancing, camping, boxing and traveling, and currently resides in Los Angeles."
