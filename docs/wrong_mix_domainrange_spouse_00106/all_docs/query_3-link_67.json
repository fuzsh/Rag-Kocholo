Marketing legend Theodore Levitt called out \"Marketing Myopia\" - the trap of focusing solely on features, not the bigger picture. His iconic quote sums it up perfectly: \"People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.\" Here's the spark of inspiration: People aren't buying products, they're buying a better life! They don't want a drill, they want the dream of a beautifully decorated home. Are YOU ready to ignite your Marketing? Unearth the WHY behind your product. What problem does it solve? What dream does it fulfil? Craft Messages that Sizzle with Emotion! Speak to your Ideal Customer's desires, not just their needs. Become the Hero in their story. Show them how your Product helps them achieve their goals. Remember, people buy on Emotion and Justify with Logic. Sell the Dream, not the Drill, and watch your Marketing soar to new heights! #india #leadership #marketing #management\n\nMost of us can't do what Simran just did. And yet she isn't trending or in the news. She is a blind runner and just won Gold for India üáÆüá≥ in 200m finishing in 25.95 secs at ParaAthletics World Championship. Go out and try running 200m at that pace. You will feel your lungs in your hand. Simran was born premature and was kept for seven months in an incubator. Doctors had given up hope and were not sure of her survival. But 22 years later, she became the first Indian woman to qualify for the 100-metre track event in Tokyo Paralympics. Remember the name Simran Sharma for Paris. Her husband is her coach who is a soldier in Indian Army. The family had to take a loan and sold their land to fund her training. The least we can do is talk about her. Share about her. She is not expecting that. But if we don't do that, her hard work and grit will go unnoticed.
