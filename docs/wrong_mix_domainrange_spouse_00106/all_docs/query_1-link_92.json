        "text": "For awhile there it really seemed as though the flagship Walking Dead series would go on forever.\n\nAMC probably would have preferred it do so as it’s one of the network’s biggest-ever hits. But some casting turnover and the lack of new adaptation material from Robert Kirkman’s original comic series finally spelled the end for the show after 11 seasons.\n\nEven though The Walking Dead as a TV show may be shuffling off its mortal coil, The Walking Dead franchise isn’t going anywhere any time soon. It’s almost as if it’s some kind of…reanimated corpse or something? The Walking Dead had already led to the creation of two spinoffs before it left the air and now AMC seems content to produce many more.\n\nWith so many Walking Dead spinoffs on the way, it can be hard to keep track of them all. So let’s do the work for you! Here are all the TV and movie projects set in The Walking Dead universe that have already aired or that are due to arrive soon.\n\nFear the Walking Dead\n\nNot only does Fear the Walking Dead have the honor of being the first-ever Walking Dead spinoff, its episode count is now quickly approaching the show it was spun off from! Fear the Walking Dead first premiered on Aug. 23, 2015 and was intended to tell the story of the zombie apocalypse from a more urban perspective.\n\nSince its premiere, however, the show has undergone many, many changes in narrative, setting, cast, crew, and all-around vibes. Original Walking Dead character Morgan Jones (Lennie James) joined the cast in the show’s fourth season and has operated as one of the show’s leads. Fear the Walking Dead is in the midst of its seventh season now with at least one more still to come. Notably, the show will soon reintroduce the long lost Madison Clark (Kim Dickens).\n\nThe Walking Dead: World Beyond\n\nThe Walking Dead: World Beyond was an interesting experiment for the franchise. While the flagship series and Fear kind of just dragged along indeterminately, World Beyond had an ending point in mind of 20 episodes spread out over two seasons. Those 20 episodes largely followed four youthful citizens of the Omaha Campus Colony as they set out on an adventure to find one of their own’s father in the Civic Republic.\n\nWorld Beyond‘s characters didn’t make a huge impact on The Walking Dead at large but some of the lore introduced in the series is sure to be important going forward. The Civic Republic Military (CRM) will certainly pop up again, as will the enigmatic post-credit scene that suggests the origin point of the zombie outbreak.\n\nTales of The Walking Dead\n\nOne of the first announced spinoffs in the post-TWD era is anthology series Tales of the Walking Dead. As its name suggests, this show will tell self-contained stories within The Walking Dead universe that feature both new and old characters. The show is currently pegged for six episodes and is set to premiere in the summer of 2022.\n\nAMC has announced some of the cast for Tales of the Walking Dead and it contains a surprising amount of familiar names and faces. Terry Crews, Anthony Edwards, Parker Posey, Poppy Liu, Jillian Bell, Olivia Munn, Danny Ramirez, Loan Chabanol, Embeth Davidtz, Jessie T. Usher, and Gage Munroe are all set to be series regulars in unconfirmed roles. We also know of one former TWD character that will feature in Tales. Whisperer leader Alpha (Samantha Morton) is set to return, reportedly in the finale.\n\nUntitled Daryl and Carol Spinoff\n\nWhen The Walking Dead‘s central hero Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) left the show in the midst of its ninth season, it created a real leadership void onscreen. The two characters who stepped into that void were fellow season 1 survivors Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride). Though this remains an ensemble effort, Daryl and Carol now represent the closest thing that the Walking Dead franchise has to main characters and AMC isn’t going to let the a silly little thing like a series finale get in the way of more of them.\n\nLittle is known about the untitled Daryl and Carol spinoff to this point. The series is set to premiere in 2023 with TWD content chief Scott Gimple executive producing and head writer Angela Kang running the show.\n\nIsle of the Dead (Maggie and Negan Spinoff)\n\nIsle of the Dead was a somewhat surprising announcement from AMC. Not only will the series take place in post-apocalyptic Manhattan, somewhere Kirkman’s comic book never attempted to depict, but it will star two characters who have every reason to hate each other. That’s right: Maggie Rhee (Lauren Cohan) and Negan Smith (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) will headline this new show.\n\nIsle of the Dead will feature six episodes and is set to premiere in 2023. Eli Jorné will serve as showrunner. AMC’s description of the project reads: “Isle of the Dead envisions the popular Maggie and Negan characters traveling into a post-apocalyptic Manhattan long ago cut off from the mainland. The crumbling city is filled with the dead and denizens who have made New York City their own world full of anarchy, danger, beauty, and terror.”\n\nUntitled Rick Grimes Film Series\n\nThe untitled series of Rick Grimes films has been in the works ever since Andrew Lincoln’s character departed The Walking Dead on November 4, 2018. Since then, however, new information on the project (first announced as one film and then clarified to be multiple) has been frustratingly sparse. The first film was reportedly due to start filming in early 2021 but did not, presumably due to the coronavirus pandemic. Walking Dead producer Greg Nicotero reported in July of 2021 that he had read “a variety of drafts of the scripts over the last few months” and that the team was “really making sure that they get it right.”\n\nWhenever the first Rick Grimes movie gets rolling it is still set to be directed by Walking Dead franchise czar Scott Gimple and produced by Gale Anne Hurd. Lincoln will obviously return as Rick Grimes. Pollyanna McIntosh will also reprise her role as Jadis, who was last seen flying in a helicopter with an injured Rick to parts unknown."
