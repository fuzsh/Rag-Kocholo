        "text": "The Fantasia Film Festival is taking place from July 18th to August 6th in Montreal and will feature over 100 films from around the world. We gave you a look at the initial lineup last month and now have an additional list of Fantasia 2013 films that will be screening, including Curse of Chucky, You're Next, and Frankenstein's Army:\n\nHORROR IS CHILD’S PLAY – DON MANCINI’S CURSE OF CHUCKY (WORLD PREMIERE)\n\nA rarity among genre franchises, the CHILD’S PLAY series (begun in 1988) has retained the sure-handed guidance of original screenwriter/creator Don Mancinithroughout killer doll Chucky’s decades’-long reign of horror. Mancini, who will be hosting our “scar-studded” world premiere, graduated to the director’s chair with 2004’s SEED OF CHUCKY, after having co-written or written every entry in the series. His longevity with the project is, of course, matched by the fiendish voiceover work by the incomparable Brad Dourif as Chucky, as well as the enduring input of producer David Kirschner (FRAILTY). For the new CURSE, SEED OF CHUCKY FX master Tony Gardner (ARMY OF DARKNESS, DARKMAN) brings the deadly doll back to life once more through ingenious puppeteering work. CURSE OF CHUCKY returns Chucky to the scarier roots of the series’ initial entries, going more for the jugular than the funnybone. World Premiere. Hosted by Writer / Director Don Mancini and select members of the cast.\n\nGET READY, GET WILD FOR GATCHAMAN (INTERNATIONAL PREMIERE)\n\nAt last, after years of rumours and dashed hopes, it’s here - the live-action feature film based onTatsuo Yoshida’s 1970s anime TV series SCIENCE NINJA TEAM GATCHAMAN… better known on these shores as BATTLE OF THE PLANETS!

Among his many accomplishments, Thibaudeau has written, conducted and performed silent film score accompaniment at the Cannes Film Festival (in 1998, for Paul Leni’s THE MAN WHO LAUGHS) and the Toronto International Film Festival (in 2005, for Robert Flaherty’s NANOOK OF THE NORTH) and his work appears on numerous DVD and Blu-Ray releases of silent cinema classics. No stranger to the Fantasia universe, Thibaudeau wrote and conducted the orchestral accompaniment for our gala METROPOLIS and PHANTOM OF THE OPERA events. For this new event, which we’re calling LES ROIS DU RIRE (the Kings of Comedy), Thibaudeau will be live-scoring Charlie Chaplin’s THE IMMIGRANT (1919), Buster Keaton’s ONE WEEK (1920) and Leo McCarey’s LIBERTY (1929). This special event is a co-presentation between Fantasia and the Just For Laughs comedy festival, in collaboration with Archambault and the Cinémathèque québécoise.Screenings will take place on JFL’s Videotron Stage in the Quartier de Spectacles in downtown Montreal.\n\nDOCUMENTARIES FROM THE EDGE RETURNS\n\nFantasia’s popular doc section is back.

Screenwriter Kankuro Kudo (ZEBRAMAN, PING PONG) builds his story as a relentless escalation of cases to be tackled, and it is in their cumulative effect that THE APOLOGY KING succeeds, defying expectations of scale and thrusting the viewer into a complex, absurd and hilarious supra-case in need of more fixing than a simple apology can provide. World Premiere.\n\nBAD FILM (Japan) Dir: Sion Sono\n\nA recently unearthed and completed early Sion Sono (LOVE EXPOSURE, SUICIDE CLUB) work and pieced together from more than 150 hours of footage shot on Hi-8 video in 1995, starring the young director in a lead role, and hundreds of members of Tokyo GAGAGA, the performance art collective he founded in 1993.
