        "text": "Shreveport's comic con, Geek'd Con, is coming back for another big year in Downtown Shreveport. The show started in 2015, and has grown into one of the premiere events in the Shreveport-Bossier area. Not only that, the show has been the largest consistently active comic con style show in the entire state of Louisiana.\n\nThis year's event is this weekend, August 19th-21st, at the Shreveport Convention Center.\n\nGeek'd Con is a mash-up of celebrity meet and greets, geeky shopping, cosplay, games, prizes, and fun. With more than 200 vendor booths set up, with vendors from across the US bringing collectibles, custom artwork, clothing, comic books, action figures, jewelry, and more.\n\nPlus the cosplay contest, brought to you by the US Marines, will feature $2,500 in cash prizes!\n\nAt the 2022 edition of Geek'd Con, you can meet stars like Matthew Lillard, Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy, Clint Howard, and more. They will be there to sign autographs and take pictures with fans.\n\nAlso appearing will be the voice of Rogue from X-Men The Animated Series, Lenore Zann!\n\nX-Men the Animated Series is one of the most iconic cartoons of all time (especially the theme), and Rogue was one of it's breakout characters. It's safe to say without the cartoon, and Zann's voice work, Rogue would have never achieved the success the character has. In fact, when IGN ranked their Top Animated Character's Of The 90's, Zann's performance as Rogue made the Top 50.\n\nIn fact, IGN ranked her ahead of legends like Stewie Griffin, Lisa Simpson, Squidward Tentacles, Chuckie Finster, Johnny Bravo, and Kenny from South Park. That's how important Rogue was in the 1990s, all because of Zann and X-Men the Animated Series.\n\nAlso appearing at Geek'd Con will be the creator of X-Men member Rogue, comic book artist Michael Golden. So you can meet two of the most important people in the history of Rogue in downtown Shreveport!\n\nYou can get your tickets to Geek'd Con right here."
