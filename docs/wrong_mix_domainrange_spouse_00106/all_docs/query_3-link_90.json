        "text": "Pollyana McIntosh was surrounded by giant walls of waste and trash, while a metal-coated zombie roamed the rubbish dump, looking for victims.\n\nThe Scots actress was making her debut in one of the biggest TV shows of all time. And considering the nightmarish vista, she would have been forgiven if she suffered apocalyptic levels of first-day jitters.\n\nInstead, she looked around at her new cast and crewmates on The Walking Dead and decided to just enjoy every mental minute of it.\n\nPollyanna, from Edinburgh , burst on to the smash hit series in February as Jadis, the leader of a bizarre group of plague survivors known as Scavengers who have created a camp in a rubbish dump.\n\nKnown for a diverse range of work, from CBBC hit MI:High to an adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s Filth and gory horror The Woman, the Scot became an instant fan favourite on the show that stars fellow Brits Andrew Lincoln and Lennie James. She became a series regular within months.\n\nAs the horror epic returns to screens for the eighth season on Monday on satellite channel Fox, Pollyanna plans to enjoy the ride.\n\nShe said: “It’s more of a privilege than a pressure. You always have the first-day jitters walking on to such an amazing set like the heaps where Jadis lives. That was just immense.\n\n“But at the same time, when you see a structure like that, and a group of people like that, you know that every single member of the cast and the crew are important and you’re just one small part of making it happen.\n\n“You can let yourself get stressed by the pressure but it is so much more fun just to enjoy it.\n\n“If I’d come in and people had been cold, it might have been different. But it was really lovely and so warm.”\n\nThis Life and Love Actually star Lincoln has been the lead character since the beginning.\n\nBut Pollyanna was thrilled to be the first Scot in the show.\n\nWhile Dougray Scott has had a small part in California-set spin-off Fear the Walking Dead, Pollyanna’s proud to be the first to represent the country on the main series.\n\nShe added: “I haven’t been home in a while and I am looking forward to getting home and meeting all The Walking Dead fans there.”\n\nPollyanna has been acting since she was a teenager, doing stage work and low-budget indies.\n\nHer UK telly work has covered most genres, from Taggart, Waterloo Road and Casualty to CBBC hits to Scots comedy Bob Servant, Independent with Brian Cox.\n\nBut she has made her biggest splash in movies and has become one of the best-known names in horror, with some stand-out parts. They include a breakout role as a vicious feral character in The Woman.\n\nPollyanna enjoyed her first US telly breakthrough last year with her eye-catching turn as crazily dressed killer Angel in the hit cable drama Hap and Leonard. But The Walking Dead has seen her profile jump to a new level.\n\nShe and her gang of Scavengers became fan favourites after their first appearance in the second half of the sixth series.\n\nThey played a crucial part in the action as rival groups did battle in a bloody finale earlier this year, setting up all-out war for the new season.\n\nWith the series launching on Monday, Pollyanna has gone from a guest star to become a series regular in one of the biggest programmes on TV. It’s second only to Game of Thrones in terms of popularity around the world.\n\nShe said: “I wear a hat a lot more than I used to. But it’s such a family atmosphere among the fans. As a fan of the show, I understand how into it they are.\n\n“I know how much it brings fans together and groups of pals. The show is something that stays with you afterwards. You are always wondering what’s going to happen next,\n\n“The fans quite enjoy hating Jadis. But mostly, it’s all in good fun, so they often say, ‘God, I hate your character, I’m so mad at her’. I’m happy because I am doing my job right. “\n\nBased on comic book author Robert Kirkman’s best-selling series, the show follows a group of survivors from a zombie plague who have to battle the undead monsters to survive, but find the biggest threats come from other humans.\n\nRecent action has been based around the battle between Lincoln’s original core cast against the cruel Survivors, led by Negan, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan.\n\nWhile the body count of the show means that few actors outside the surviving central cast can safely prepare for any length of time on Walking Dead, Pollyanna will be busy in the near future with her own projects and good causes.\n\nShe supports the Joshua Nolan Foundation ( www.joshuanolanfoundation.org ), who work to help address mental health issues and prevent suicides.\n\nIn December, she will start work on her directorial debut film.\n\nPollyanna has recruited some of her zombie-fighting co-stars for the as-yet untitled movie.\n\nShe said: “I can’t talk about what the film is about but I am very proud of it. It’s something I wrote and was asked to direct.\n\n“I have a fantastic cast and have asked a couple of the actors from the show who I really love. I’m making my own little film family on the side.”\n\nBefore that, there is lots of work to be done in Georgia.\n\nSo what can we expect from Jadis’s first full season in telly’s most successful zombie land?\n\nPollyanna said: “It’s explosive. We are getting the war we have been wanting and there will be deaths, there will be surprises.\n\n“Jadis is going to be on whichever side is winning.\n\n“You will discover a little bit more about her this season and I am really excited to see what people make of it because we are having a lot of fun with her.”\n\n● The Walking Dead season eight, Fox, Monday, 9pm."
