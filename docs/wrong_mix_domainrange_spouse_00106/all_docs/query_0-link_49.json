        "text": "I thought I was done with the Walking Dead Universe and I have felt this way several times about the universe as a whole when it comes to AMC's take.\n\nSPOILER ALERT!!!!!\n\nI thought the series was over when they killed off Carl. I for sure thought the series was done and dusted when Andrew Lincoln decided he was done on episode 5 of season 9. It was an epic character moment, I will say. Destroying the bridge built through the early episodes of the season, which was meant to join several survivor encampments. And that only served to usher in the \"Whisperers,\" and what I will refer to as twisted hero Negan. I thought it was over with The World Beyond, honeslty not a big fan of that spinoff. Although, despite \"losing\" star players in the universe time and again, I was often surprised by the stellar product that was still disseminated.\n\nAll that being said, I simply can't get enough of the twisted universe that Robert Kirkman created, and interesting minds like Tony Moore, Charlie Adlard, Frank Darabont, Greg Nicotero, and so many others have built upon and expanded.\n\nTake for instance the latest instalment which brings \"the widow,\" Lauren Cohens' Maggie Rhee, and Jeffery Dean Morgan's iconic Negan back for another round of fun, which seems to just be getting started in Dead City. The season's final episode sees a certain group of characters looking to resurrect, if you will, the untamable beast Negan of season 6's final episode. The charisma and brutality Negan has semi put away over the past few seasons may be on the way in a now confirmed 2nd season of Dead City.\n\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon,\n\nWhat I'm even more excited about is finally seeing Rick and Michonne finish their story. Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes was literally the Walking Dead for many years in my eyes and to see him return to the series that truly built him an on-screen legacy, is precisely what fans have been clamoring for. The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, is officially the return and end of the Michonne (Danai Gurira) and Rick story. The series will also see the return of betrayer and artsy trash queen, Pollyanna McIntosh's Jadis.\n\nOverall, the Walking Dead universe has provided a \"bloody\" good time. I'm excited, not only for season 2 of Dead City and the Daryl Dixon spin-off, but for the opportunity to see Andrew Lincoln finish what he started, so to speak. Look for The Ones Who Live, to arrive sometime in 2024.\n\nLOOK: TV Locations in Every State"
