        "text": "Norman Reedus is getting his own \"The Walking Dead\" spin-off this fall on AMC.\n\n\"The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon\" will follow Daryl as he mysteriously washes ashore in France.\n\nInsider rounded up every way we believe Daryl may wind up overseas (he's likely been kidnapped).\n\nDaryl Dixon's heading to France this fall. But how he gets there is anyone's guess.\n\nFirst announced in September 2020, Norman Reedus' \"The Walking Dead\" spin-off, aptly titled \"The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon,\" follows Daryl as he \"washes ashore in France and struggles to piece together how he got there and why.\"\n\nDuring an October 2022 appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", Reedus teased, \"I don't go there on my free will.\"\n\nThe last time we saw Daryl during the flagship series' finale, he rode off searching for former \"TWD\" protagonist Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln). Previously assumed dead, Daryl learned his friend was alive and missing somewhere in the world after getting scooped up by a group known as the Civic Republic Military years prior.\n\nAs fans await more info on the upcoming spin-off, Insider rounded up the many ways Daryl possibly could wind up so far from the East Coast â€” and how likely we think they are to happen.\n\n5. Daryl gets a lead on Rick and heads to France on his own.\n\nLikelihood: I doubt this is how Daryl gets to France.\n\nDespite Daryl's search for Rick getting underway in November's \"TWD\" series' finale, Reedus told Jimmy Kimmel that Daryl doesn't go to France of his own volition.\n\nUnfortunately, we doubt he's looking for Rick in France. It sounds like someone may send him on purpose.\n\n4. Someone Daryl loves is kidnapped and he follows them, winding up in France.\n\nDaryl's extremely loyal and if his bestie Carol (Melissa McBride) or someone he's close to goes missing, we can bet that Daryl will be among the first on the case. We could easily see Daryl getting knocked out while on the trail of someone's disappearance. In the process, Daryl's shipped off to Europe.\n\nThe only reason we think someone may be kidnapped is because McBride has been spotted in France with Reedus, presumably on set. \"TWD\" franchise actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan posted a photo on Twitter of the two back together seemingly confirming her appearance on the upcoming series.\n\nAdditionally, Cassady McClincy, who played Lydia on \"TWD,\" was spotted in France in late 2022, prompting fans to wonder if the actor may appear on the series as well.\n\nLikelihood: This is possible, but I think there are more plausible scenarios. We've just seen this exact storyline on \"The Walking Dead: Dead City\" with Maggie, Hershel, and Negan. It would feel lame if the Daryl spin-off did something similar.\n\n3. Daryl gets a whiff about a potential cure to the zombie apocalypse and winds up overseas as a result.\n\nThe series finale of the spin-off \"TWD: World Beyond\" ended with a scene suggesting the walker apocalypse may have started in France, with a scene taking place in the country. It also teased the existence of a breed of stronger, more aggressive walkers.\n\nIn 2021, \"TWD\" universe chief Scott M. Gimple told Insider the \"World Beyond\" scene was \"setting up a new story,\" adding that this was \"the start of a new chapter.\"\n\n\"I don't think people will expect at all what that chapter is from what they saw,\" Gimple said.\n\nScientists on \"World Beyond\" were working on a cure. Maybe Daryl gets kidnapped by someone running tests and he's shipped off to France in order to be further examined and he escapes. (Look, anything's possible at this point.)\n\nAnother thought is that Daryl stumbles upon some info about a potential cure and gets sent overseas when he finds something he shouldn't have.\n\nLikelihood: I'm not convinced \"TWD\" is taking this route because it sounds a bit goofy. But it seems impossible to rule anything out at this point when radiation is being used on \"Fear TWD\" as a way to slow down zombie bite infections.\n\nIt also seems like too much of a coincidence for Daryl to wind up in the country that was showcased on \"World Beyond,\" leading me to believe there's some type of connection between the two even if the walker virus doesn't directly result in his trip to France.\n\n2. Daryl's kidnapped, breaks free of his captors and winds up in France.\n\nThis wouldn't be Daryl's first time getting captured and imprisoned by another group. This could also align with Carol and Lydia winding up on the spin-off if they tracked him down to France.\n\nAs a fan, it's easy to want \"The Walking Dead\" universe to connect in meaningful ways; however, a vague mystery falls more in line with what fans have come to expect in recent years from \"TWD.\"\n\nLikelihood: I wouldn't be surprised if this happens, but I really hope it's not. Fans deserve better.\n\n1. Daryl gets close to discovering Rick's whereabouts and it leads to trouble, with someone sending him to France.\n\nSince we know Daryl left \"The Walking Dead\" in search of Rick it's easy to imagine that Daryl got closer than anyone to discovering where the Civic Republic Military took Rick years ago.\n\nDaryl's an excellent tracker so even if he's not following Rick's direct trail, he's probably searching for Michonne (Danai Gurira) who left \"TWD\" in season 10 in search of her love and is still in pursuit.\n\nI could see Daryl getting caught by someone recognizable from the Civic Republic Military like Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) who then sent him somewhere (Paris) where no one could find him.\n\nLikelihood: This feels like the most likely and believable scenario.\n\nAt the least, it would be the smartest tie-in if the series wants to connect to the larger \"TWD\" universe and the upcoming untitled \"Rick and Michonne\" series. There's a prime opportunity to bring back Jadis who flew off with Rick years ago only for her to rid of Daryl in another country.\n\nOtherwise, it seems foolish for AMC to have so many \"TWD\" spin-offs if there isn't a grand plan to eventually reunite everyone with Rick down the line."
