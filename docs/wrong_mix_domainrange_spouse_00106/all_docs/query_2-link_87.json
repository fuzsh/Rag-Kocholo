        "text": "THE glamorous career of Pollyanna McIntosh has taken her from Glasgow to London to Los Angeles …to Broughty Ferry.\n\nThe former model is starring in Bob Servant Independent, a new BBC comedy about the fight for the Tayside political hot seat.\n\nThe former Pirelli calendar girl views the BBC4 series – which also stars Brian Cox, Jonathan Watson and Greg McHugh – as another major step away from her old career.\n\nPollyanna, 33, said: “I now don’t mind if people know about my modelling because I don’t feel like it really matters. I feel like I have proved myself as an actress, to some degree.\n\n“I was acting before I was modelling, when I was very young, doing the Edinburgh Festival and that sort of stuff.\n\n“The worst fear you can have coming from a modelling background is that you’re going to be a model-turned- actress – a mattress, that’s what I call them, ironically, I hope.\n\n“I was spotted in Glasgow and asked to enter a competition to find the Highland Spring Face of 1995 by the Storm agency. I won the Edinburgh heat, then I won the title in London and moved there aged 16.\n\n“On the face of it, I was going to model –but for myself, I was going to act.\n\n“I’d take any little acting job I could find. The first one was a tiny, tiny role in Irvine Welsh’s The Acid House, so it was back up to Scotland.”\n\nThe passion for acting is no surprise as it is in her blood. Her dad David McIntosh was an accomplished stage performer and appeared with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in the 1967 film Dr Faustus.\n\nHe gave it up to focus on family life with his wife Judi, although his new career with textile company Coats and Clark still provided an exotic childhood for Pollyanna.\n\nBorn in Alexandria, near Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, she moved to Portugal when she was two, then on to Columbia when she was five before returning to Edinburgh when she was nine.\n\nShe said: “Dad started his career in the mills in Paisley and went to all these different countries in that job.\n\n“When we went back to Edinburgh, he was the manager for the blood transfusion service for the NHS.\n\n“When he was younger, he was an actor and played the Devil in Dr Faustus with Burton and Taylor.\n\n“But he gave it all up for my mum because he wanted to have some money, something I have never learned to do.”\n\nFilming in Broughty Ferry for Bob Servant Independent also saw her discover a family\n\nconnection she didn’t know she had. She said: “My mum Judi is from Broughty Ferry and I didn’t know until I did this job. I thought she was from Edinburgh. It’s a typical example of children presuming their parents didn’t exist before they were born.\n\n“My mum was raised in Broughty Ferry until she was 10 and I got to go back and see the house she grew up in.\n\n“She has been feeding me information about the area so I’d say to Brian Cox, who is from Dundee, things like, ‘Do you remember going to the arcades?’ And he would be like, ‘How do you know that?’”\n\nBob Servant Independent follows the trials and tribulations of would-be politician Bob, played by Cox, as he bids to win power in Broughty Ferry following the sudden death of the sitting MP.\n\nPollyanna – who divorced US actor Grant Show in 2011 after a seven-year marriage – plays Philippa, the wife and campaign manager of his rival, slick\n\nprofessional politician Nick Edwards, played by Rufus Jones. Bob dismisses Philippa as “basically a pretty Hitler”.\n\nPollyanna said: “I like to think of Philippa as the ventriloquist with the hand up the back of her husband’s jumper. Her world is Westminster and politics and she does very well in it.\n\n“Bob sees himself as the king of his castle and Philippa think she is queen of all she surveys so obviously they don’t get on very well. She thinks Bob’s a numpty.\n\n“As far as Philippa is concerned, there is nothing dark or overbearing about her – but I’m sure Hitler thought the same.”\n\nPollyanna is delighted to be doing comedy, all the more so since she could very easily have settled for being a horror “scream queen”. In controversial 2011 film The Woman, she played a ferocious, feral woman who is captured by a disturbed suburban dad and held hostage in the family basement.\n\nIt was a no-holds-barred performance which won both critical praise and audience acclaim and one she has been asked to repeat.\n\nShe said: “It’s that old thing, the woman uglies up, the man plays gay and you get taken seriously, which says a lot about what we think about men and women.\n\n“The Woman helped immeasurably because I looked so ferocious in it and so animalistic. It’s a horrifying story.\n\n“I still have the fear of being labelled a scream queen. Most of the publicity about me is connected to The Woman and most of the offers I get are for horror films.\n\n“I am constantly turning them down. I am not against doing another horror film, it just has to be really great.”\n\nDespite basing herself in London and LA for the last few years, she’s found herself more in demand than ever back home in Scotland.\n\nAs well as filming Bob Servant Independent, she’s also appeared in Waterloo Road and MI High on TV and in John Landis’s Burke and Hare on the big screen.\n\nShe is also in the forthcoming Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, alongside James McAvoy.\n\nShe said: “The bizarre thing is it all comes from being based in London and I am coming up to play English people in most of them.\n\n“I love working with Scottish crews because they have that dark, dirty, gallows humour, quite different from LA.”"
