It’s all over for Grant Show and Pollyanna McIntosh.

The wife of the former Melrose Place star and recent Burn Notice recurring player filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court yesterday. She cited “irreconcilable differences” in the documents.

McIntosh and Show were married in 2004 after meeting during a Lane Bryant photo shoot a year earlier. They have no kids.
