        "text": "NBA counterfactuals can get complicated quickly, and this one from Dan Le Batard in the Miami Herald is a doozy. It involves the Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Minnesota Timberwolves and Boston Celtics at the very least, and the untold ripples very well could have resonated with all 30 teams.\n\nAccording to Le Batard, who provides a detailed breakdown of the multiple facets of the current contract negotiations between the Heat and Dwyane Wade, the idea of taking a pay cut -- or not -- is a long and storied tradition in Miami. Wade himself reportedly took a cut to keep Udonis Haslem in the fold when the Big 3 came together in 2010. But none of that would have even been on the table if Shawn Marion had agreed to a smaller deal in Miami in 2007, Le Batard writes:\n\n\"Miami’s Big 3 would have never gotten together if Shawn Marion, of all people, had gotten what he wanted. Marion was so stubborn about wanting a max contract back in 2007 that his insistence helped blow up a three-team deal that could have sent Kevin Garnett from Minnesota to Phoenix. ... But Marion wouldn’t re-sign with a trading team that wasn’t offering the max, so he was instead sent to Miami for a disgruntled Shaquille O’Neal. Miami offered Marion a four-year contract that would have also kept Miami’s Big 3 from uniting, but not at the max. So Marion asked to be traded … and had to settle in Dallas for a five-year, $39 million deal that was far less than the max.\"\n\nThese kind of \"what if?\" scenarios are always hard to analyze, since, you know, none of it actually happened. But Garnett in Phoenix would have been fascinating. Those Suns teams of the aughts are often maligned for their less-than-stellar defense, despite the fact that they helped redefine modern NBA offense. A team with one of the greatest defensive players ever at center and Steve Nash leading the way on offense, though? That's the stuff that championships are made of.\n\nAnd that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the Miami side of things. If Marion takes the deal, is Wade left sans LeBron James and Chris Bosh when free agency hits after the 2009-10 season? Would the Heat have been able to package Marion and acquired the cap space to put the Big 3 together? Le Batard writes that the whole concept of the three joining forces in Miami was considered outside the realm of possibility until James brought it up. With the Heat not in the same shape cap-wise that offseason, would the thought have crossed LeBron's mind with the same sort of credulity?\n\nFor want of a pay cut, dynasties formed and dreams were dashed.\n\n(h/t Miami Herald)"
