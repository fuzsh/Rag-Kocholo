        "text": "Shawn Marion recently claimed he was a “better defender” than Draymond Green, and the Golden State Warriors forward didn’t take his comment lightly.\n\n“Draymond, I think I love his tenacity, energy, and heart, but I still think I was a way better defender than he was. The reason I say that is because when I had to guard point guards or when I actually guard you, I’ll guard you for the whole game,” Marion said on the Club 520 podcast.\n\nDraymond Green revealed his true feelings about Marion’s claim by commenting on Basketball Network’s social media post, saying that he had the unenviable task of defending two of the league’s best guards in the same postseason run.\n\n“Brother I guarded Jalen Brunson and Jaylen Brown back-to-back SERIES,” Draymond Green commented via Dalton Johnson.\n\nTo his credit, Draymond Green reminded fans why he’s arguably the best defender of this generation during their 104-100 win against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday, as he made the game-sealing block against Daniel Gafford late in the game.\n\nDraymond Green was looking back at the Golden State Warriors title run in 2022\n\nDraymond Green and the Golden State Warriors entered the 2022 NBA playoffs as the third seed with a 53-29 record. In the first round, they eliminated the sixth-seeded Denver Nuggets without Jamal Murray in five games.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors were up against the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference semifinals. Despite Ja Morant leading Memphis, Golden State was able to close them out in six games.\n\nAgainst the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals, the Golden State Warriors had the tough challenge of slowing down Luka Doncic and Jalen Brunson. Brunson averaged 18.0 points per game in the series, but Draymond Green and co. did just enough to put them away in five games.\n\nWhen the Golden State Warriors were down 2-1 against the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals, Draymond Green and co. tightened up their defense and Boston never scored 100 points the rest of the way. With Draymond Green as his primary defender, Jaylen Brown couldn’t shoot higher than 43 percent from the field."
