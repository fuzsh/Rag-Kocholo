        "text": "Shawn Marion wanted another shot at an NBA title. He’ll get it playing with LeBron James.\n\nThe free-agent forward agreed to a contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers, a person familiar with the negotiations told the Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nMarion, 36, informed the Cavs last week that he will take a minimum deal and play for them next season, said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the contract has not been finalized.\n\nESPN.com first reported the agreement.\n\nThe Cavs can only offer Marion a deal worth $1.4 million because they’re out of room under the salary cap.\n\nA four-time All-Star, Marion gives Cleveland another veteran with postseason experience to complement James, who is returning to the Cavs intent on winning the city’s first pro championship since 1964. The team has previously signed shooters Mike Miller and James Jones, who won two NBA titles with James in Miami.\n\nCleveland is also on the brink of adding All-Star forward Kevin Love, who is expected to come over from Minnesota in a trade on or after Saturday. While Love gives the Cavs size, another shooter and an excellent passer, he has never played in a postseason game as a pro.\n\nTennis:\n\nSerena Williams needed only 62 minutes to beat Ana Ivanovic, 6-4, 6-1, in the Western & Southern Open at Mason, Ohio. She’d never even reached the finals at the tournament until last year, when she lost to Victoria Azarenka on a third-set tiebreaker.\n\nTennis:\n\nRoger Federer won an unprecedented sixth championship at the Western & Southern Open near Cincinnati, overcoming one bad set to beat David Ferrer, 6-3, 1-6, 6-2. Federer improved to 16-0 against Ferrer. For the women, top-seeded Serena Williams needed only 62 minutes to beat Ana Ivanovic, 6-4, 6-1.\n\nDiving:\n\nJordan Windle is a national champion diver before he’s old enough to be a licensed driver. Windle, who doesn’t turn 16 until November, won the men’s 10-meter title with 527.8 points to cap the final day of the U.S. national diving championships at Knoxville, Tenn. Windle was born in Cambodia and lives in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nDetroit Free Press News Services"
