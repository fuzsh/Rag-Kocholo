That's not going to happen, by the way; he doesn't even have it with him. And good luck getting those sunglasses off his forehead. That's some exclusive-ass, Cubes-funded spirit gum keepin' those up there.\n\nListen, I'm not going to kill you for this, dude. Confusing a blonde-Mohawked Shawn Marion for \"Meteor Man\"-era Big Daddy Kane is a mistake that anyone who doesn't know what people look like can make. But you need to know that this is going to end badly, for all of us.\n\nOh, no, he's trying to do the Buff Love heavy-breathing beatbox. Oh, man.\n\nBest caption wins quiet contemplation of the Pandora's box this dude just opened. Thanks a heap, man. Jeez. Good luck. (To us all.)\n\nIn our last adventure: I came Back Like Cooked Snacks (the greatest Juelz Santana x Jerome James collabo never recorded), and Detroit Pistons head coach Lawrence Frank proved that the NBA Cares. (Maybe a little too much.)\n\n{YSP:MORE}\n\nWinner, Eric G.: Lawrence Frank: \"Five wins next year, okay? I'm willing to guarantee five.\"\n\nLittle Girl on Right: \"Not if you're still starting Charlie V.\"\n\nLF: \"I guarantee five.\"\n\nLGoR: \"You're probably only gonna play 50.\"\n\nLF: \"You know what? I'm gonna go up to seven, hater. Okay, no. I guarantee five.\"\n\nRunner-up, Jones6: \"And then a magic accounting hand appeared and made it look like our team lost money.\""
