        "text": "Even when past his prime on the Wizards, Michael Jordan came up clutch against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, Jordan sunk the Cavaliers (for the third time) with a game-winner. All eyes were on the GOAT again with the shot clock turned off on a final Washington possession. Teammate Richard Hamilton inbounded the ball to MJ, who had Marion in a defensive stance guarding him. Mike attacked to the paint area where he pump faked, catching Marion on a half-jump contest. On his way back down, Michael went up for the mid-range jumper. Swish. Much like his Cavs shot, Mike just held his fist up and scowled at the road crowd as the air left the building.\n\nThe shoe Mike wore for this game was the Air Jordan 17. This sneaker paired Zoom Air in the forefoot with the new Tuned Air unit in the heel to provide different support in different areas of the heel. The traction is made to look like a golf shoe to play up Jordan’s hobby. The chrome clip on the heel provides support, while also taking inspiration from MJ’s love for Aston Martin cars.\n\nThe white and blue Wizards home colorway worn in this highlight can be found HERE."
