        "text": "Dirk Nowitzki scored 25 points, and rookie Rodrique Beaubois added 14 points on 6-for-6 shooting to help the Dallas Mavericks beat Detroit 95-90 on Sunday night, snapping the Pistons' winning streak at three games.\n\nDrew Gooden had 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Shawn Marion also had 11 points, and Jason Kidd added 10 points and seven assists for the Mavericks.\n\nRodney Stuckey led the Pistons with 28 points, and Will Bynum had 27, including 17 in the fourth quarter. Ben Gordon, though, went 1 for 16 and missed a 3-pointer that would have tied it with 2 seconds left.\n\nThe Pistons led late in the third quarter, but a turnover let the Mavericks get back-to-back dunks at the end of the period for 71-66.\n\nDetroit tied it at 78 with 6 minutes left, but Nowitzki answered with a three-point play. After Charlie Villaneuva made a free throw for Detroit, Nowitzki made a jumper and Jason Terry hit a 3-pointer to give the Mavericks a 86-79 lead with 4:21 left.\n\nNowitzki added a running jumper with 35.3 seconds left, but Bynum's jumper and Terry's miss gave the Pistons the ball with 5.7 seconds left, down 93-90. Gordon then missed an off-balance jumper.\n\nSUNS 101\n\nRAPTORS 100\n\nPHOENIX -- Amare Stoudemire followed one of the worst games of his career with his best game of the season, scoring 30 points to lead Phoenix over Toronto, the Suns' 11th straight win over the Raptors.\n\nThe Suns improved to an NBA-best 9-2, winning their 13th in a row at home.\n\nThey are the only team in the league to score at least 100 points in every game this season and they have scored at least 100 in 30 straight home games. They also are 18-3 at home since Alvin Gentry became coach.\n\nSteve Nash had 23 points and nine assists, and Channing Frye added 20. Chris Bosh led the Raptors with 25 points and 10 rebounds. Hedo Turkoglu scored 20 points.\n\nCLIPPERS 101\n\nTHUNDER 93\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- Baron Davis scored 24 points, including a key 3-pointer in the final minute, to help the Los Angeles Clippers snap a three-game losing streak with a victory over Oklahoma City.\n\nChris Kaman added 25 points on 10-for-15 shooting and had seven rebounds for Los Angeles (4-7), which avenged a loss to Oklahoma City (5-5) on the Clippers' home court four days earlier.\n\nKevin Durant scored a season-high 40 points and had eight rebounds for Oklahoma City, which was seeking what would have been only its second three-game win streak since the franchise moved from Seattle before last season. Oklahoma City had road wins over the Clippers and San Antonio in its previous two games.\n\nIn a game that had 25 lead changes and 18 ties, Kaman put the Clippers ahead for good at 94-93, taking a pass from Davis and scoring with 1:46 left. After the teams traded turnovers, Russell Westbrook missed an 18-footer for Oklahoma City, and Davis followed with the 3-pointer to give Los Angeles a 97-93 lead.\n\nJeff Green missed a 3-point attempt for Oklahoma City, and Al Thornton scored on a breakaway dunk for the Clippers with 29.2 seconds left to seal the win."
