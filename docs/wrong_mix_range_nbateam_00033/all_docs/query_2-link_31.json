        "text": "Shawn Marion was a really solid NBA player over the course of his career. From the 1999-2000 season through the 2014-15 season, Marion was a decent scorer and a good rebounder. Also, in his prime, Marion was as athletic as you can get. Because of Marion’s success in the NBA, especially for the Phoenix Suns, he ultimately earned enough money in his career to buy a professional basketball team.\n\nShawn Marion was great for the Phoenix Suns\n\nAfter playing two seasons at Vincennes University, Shawn Marion transferred to UNLV, according to UNLV’s site. He was really good in his lone season at UNLV too as he averaged 18.7 points per game, 9.3 rebounds, and 2.5 steals. This led to him becoming a top-10 draft pick in 1999.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns selected Marion with the ninth overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft. Marion ultimately ended up being really successful for the Suns too. After averaging 10.2 points per game and 6.5 rebounds during his rookie season, Marion scored 17.3 points per game and pulled down 10.7 rebounds in 2000-01. Then from 2001-02 through 2005-06, Marion averaged 19 points per game or more each season. His best season came in 2005-06 when he averaged 21.8 points per game and 11.8 rebounds.\n\nMarion was on some really good teams too. The Suns went to the playoffs six of the eight seasons from 1999-2000 through 2006-07. They also made it to the Western Conference Finals two seasons in a row in 2004-05 and 2005-06. That is in addition to winning over 60 games in 2004-05 and 2006-07.\n\nThe Suns then traded Marion to the Miami Heat in a deal for Shaquille O’Neal in 2008, according to ESPN. He ultimately earned four All-Star selections and averaged 18.4 points per game along with 10 rebounds in eight-and-a-half seasons with the Suns.\n\nBecoming a role player\n\nMarion spent some time on the Heat and Raptors during the next two seasons. However, the Dallas Mavericks traded for Marion in 2009, according to ESPN. He then spent the next five seasons there.\n\nMarion became a nice role player with the Mavericks. He ultimately averaged 11.6 points per game and seven rebounds during his time there. Additionally, he helped the Mavericks win an NBA championship during the 2010-11 season. He had some big games in the playoffs too. Marion scored 26 points in the series-clinching Game 5 win against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals. He also scored 20 points in a Game 2 win against the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\nMarion then later signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014. He only scored 4.8 points per game that season but was a part of a team that reached the NBA Finals.\n\nAfter 16 seasons, Marion confirmed his retirement in 2015, according to ESPN.\n\nMarion’s net worth is so large he bought a pro basketball team\n\nBecause of all of his success, Shawn Marion has racked up a really large net worth.
