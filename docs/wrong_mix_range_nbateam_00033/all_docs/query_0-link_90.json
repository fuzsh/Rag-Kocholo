(AP Photo/Mark Duncan) ORG XMIT: CDA104\n\n(Mark Duncan)\n\nCLEVELAND - Shawn Marion has been plagued with a troublesome left hip flexor for months and the Cavaliers are hoping that an MRI on Monday will reveal the severity.\n\nThe small forward arrived in Cleveland this afternoon for the MRI while the team headed to Detroit for Tuesday's game against the Pistons.\n\nDue to his ailment, Marion has not played in the last two games and he also missed two games during the January West Coast trip because of the injury.\n\nIn the past few months Marion has downplayed the magnitude of his ailing hip and even chalked it up to age, being that he's 36 years old. But it has apparently reached the point to where he needs to thoroughly examine the problem.\n\nThe results from the MRI have not been released.\n\nIn 50 appearances this season, the 16-year NBA veteran is averaging 4.9 points and 3.5 rebounds in 20.0 minutes per game."
