In a lot of ways, he doesn’t exactly scream NBA role player. He’s not an awesome shooter. He's an average defender. He didn't pass or make a ton of plays for his teammates this past season. But when I watch his game, he reminds me a lot of some of the good role players who have recently exceeded their draft value as they scale down into a different role. Think of guys like Caleb Martin and Dillon Brooks, both of whom were primary options in college and don't exactly have immense measurables, but figured it out in the NBA as impactful players who did whatever it takes to work. I think Wilson will just do whatever it takes and become an NBA rotation player. There is some downside here if the shooting doesn't come along quite as much as you'd hope. But there is real upside to being comfortable handling the ball at the level Wilson can, even for role players in today’s NBA. There's upside to being this big and strong while also being able to do things at speed and make plays as a passer.

It is difficult to find shot creators this gifted. But he must totally change his style of play to make it work. He needs to get better at playing without the ball in his hands. Make an impact when you’re away from the ball. Become a good defender. Become a good mover without the ball. Understand what’s happening on the court beyond just getting buckets. It’s asking a lot. He needs a lot of work. But there is a talented basketball player here for his age. Hopefully he buys into showing it and doing the type of things that will get him on an NBA court.\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers have selected Miami wing Jordan Miller with the No. 48 pick.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on Miller: I think Miller is an awesome candidate for a two-way contract and is one of my priority players there. I love the idea of him being a cutter, spot-up shooter and defender who just keeps things simple and plays the right way. But I'm worried enough about the shooting that I don't know how great I'd feel about him right now as a fully guaranteed roster player. If it takes him time to adjust to the NBA line as a shooter, he turns 24 midway through next season and might not have a ton of time to figure it all out.\n\nI love his length, and I love how direct his game is. He’s one of those guys who just gets stuff done out there, and I have an immense appreciation for how he forces his will upon the game despite being relatively low usage. The fact that he doesn't need the ball to be productive is a huge plus. I just would like to see a bit more shooting evidence.\n\n(Photo: Carmen Mandato / Getty Images)\n\nThe Indiana Pacers have selected G League Ignite guard Mojave King with the No. 47 pick.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on King: I think King makes a lot of sense on a two-way contract right now. He’s in the ballpark of 6-foot-5 in shoes, has a legitimate 8-foot-5 standing reach and should have the size to play at the two. He’s also already an impactful defensive player, and he’s clearly an NBA-caliber athlete even if it’s not wildly functional because his hip flexibility could stand to be better, and he needs to really load up to access his vertical leap. The swing skill is the jumper. If he ever becomes a 38 percent 3-point shooter beyond the NBA 3-point line, he’ll have a chance to play in the NBA. The only question is how long it takes to get there. Can he become a consistent 3-point shooter before NBA teams move onto different, younger players in the future? If he does, he has a chance to stick. But, again, being a non-shooter, non-creator and non-passer is a tough way to stick as a guard in the NBA. He needs to tick some of those boxes sooner rather than later.\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nA college coach who played South Carolina this season dishes on G.G. Jackson, the No. 45 pick by the Memphis Grizzlies. As told to David Aldridge.\n\nYou’ve got to understand this guy gave up prom, he gave up his senior year. He didn’t go to Overtime Elite; he went to college. And that’s tougher than what (Scoot) Henderson did. Because the game is different. The game is wide open at G League Ignite. (Jackson) played in college schemes, and South Carolina’s program wasn’t a good program. What he’s saying is, I’m not afraid of going to a bad franchise. If he had stayed in high school, he would be going to college right now. He’d be on campus right now for the first time. I commend his folks for attempting to speed up the process, but it’s almost like he will get his advantage from it when he signs his second contract, because he’ll have a year ahead of the (incoming) class that’s now in high school, not in college. He passed up being a McDonald’s All-American. He passed up a lot to do it.\n\nHe’s very talented. He needs a point guard. He needs shooters (around him). But he’s a good athlete. He can create his own shot, especially off the bounce, he’s Shawn Marion. That’s who he can become. He’s got to accept that, though. Shawn Marion was rebounding the ball, so he has to embrace rebounding the ball, and defending. And Shawn Marion had Steve Nash. He was running like a track star when it was conversion time from defense to offense. That’s a skill. That’s a talent. He’s got to have self-awareness as to what the next phase of his career is, because he did speed up the process. … mentally, was young, immature. And there were some things that took place I’m sure he regrets, as he admitted. But, again, he was 16 going on 17 when he decided to go to college. We would be talking about a top-10 kid if he went to UNC (this year).\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks have selected Penn State guard Seth Lundy with the No. 46 pick.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on Lundy: Lundy is the kind of player I really want to buy into, given the importance of shooting in today's NBA. Being able to knock down shots is essential. He's also a hard worker on defense with real length and tools. He has experience taking on difficult assignments and making life harder for good players. I also think he has the makings of being able to attack closeouts and take on the occasional mismatch off the bounce.\n\nBut he's still a bit of a developmental player in a lot of respects due to his feel for the game. The fact that he's never shown real ability to make consistent passing reads is a worry. His overall physical profile is a bit stiff, upright and boxy and also begs questions on the defensive end in terms of switchability.\n\nI see him as a two-way guy, but he'd be one of my top priorities on the two-way market.\n\n(Photo: Stacy Revere / Getty Images)\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies have selected South Carolina wing G.G. Jackson with the No. 45 pick.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on Jackson: Jackson is all about how strongly you value the ability to create shots. Jackson can get his own shot and is one of the more polished players I've seen in that regard playing at the college level at his age. He's creative with his footwork and handle and has real shiftiness and change of pace. There is a lot to like there. I think, long term, he will make shots.\n\nBut everything else right now is at such a deficit that Jackson is about as much of a project as one will find in the draft. Teams will need to be exceptionally patient with him. He will not be a positive NBA player until at least Year 3, and I think he should spend most of, if not his entire, rookie season in the G League working on what he needs to improve. On top of that, a big concern here is the lack of explosiveness with his first step and lateral quickness. Can he get to the rim enough to be efficient? Does he have the upside to separate consistently to where all his shots are not contested opportunities?\n\nThe other big question is maturity. Jackson did not deal well with adversity this past season, between his poor body language on the court, his separation from his teammates at times in huddles and his Instagram Live outburst questioning the coaching staff. Is Jackson mature enough to overcome the adversity that will come from playing against grown men? He went through real struggles playing against less talented competition than professionals.\n\nIf you value shot creation above all and you think Jackson's upside as a shooter is high enough, you can see a world where Jackson has high upside if the issue was simply getting him out of the South Carolina environment. If you think Jackson's feel for the game just isn't high enough and he’s still multiple years away from being mature enough to overcome his issues as a player, then you probably shouldn’t take him. I rank players based off what I think their value will be to the organization that drafts them. Much like I felt about Talen Horton-Tucker, I don't think Jackson will bring much return on investment for that first team. But also, like Horton-Tucker, I think Jackson will probably become something valuable in the future. It’s just likely to take a couple of stops to get there.\n\n(Photo: Justin Casterline / Getty Images)\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers have selected New Zealand Breakers wing Rayan Rupert with the No. 43 pick.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on Rupert: Rupert's length gives him an awful lot to be excited about as a long-term investment. He has a terrific frame and tremendous upside on defense due to his physical tools and lateral quickness. He's a former point guard who is at least comfortable handling the ball and making plays, which should allow him to continue to build on those skills to the level he needs them in the NBA. He is your patented 3-and-D type prospect if the shooting comes through. But his season as shooter was not good enough to instill a whole lot of confidence on that piece of his game coming through. It'd be ambitious to expect him to turn into a 15-point-per-game scorer or to provide much offensive value in the first three years of his career. But he's likely going to be a very difficult problem for offenses when he’s defending due to his rotational instincts, motor and on-ball potential.\n\nIf all his skills hit, you can squint and see a starter down the road. But that requires you to really have a plan for how to work through his issues with his shooting base. If you're going to make a developmental bet as an NBA team, I get buying into Rupert. I just couldn't really do it before the end of the first, and I'd probably have preferred it more in the early second round given how much work is required on the offensive end.\n\n(Photo: Masanori Udagawa / Getty Images)"
