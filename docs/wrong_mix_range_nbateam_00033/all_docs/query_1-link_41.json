        "text": "AUBURN HILLS -- Joe Dumars was neither surprised nor disappointed that the Detroit Pistons will pick ninth in next month's NBA draft.\n\nWith long odds of landing one of the top three picks via Wednesday's lottery, the Pistons' president of basketball operations and his staff have spent their draft preparation anticipating they'd have the ninth pick after Detroit finished with the ninth-worst record in the NBA last season.\n\nThe Pistons had a 1.7 percent chance of landing the No. 1 pick, which went to the New Orleans Hornets. New Orleans (21-45) shared the NBA's third-worst record last season with Cleveland.\n\nThe Pistons were 25-41.\n\n\"All of the work that we've been doing for months and months has been geared toward us having the ninth pick,\" Dumars said in a conference call with reporters at The Palace. \"When your chances are 1.7 percent of moving up to the No. 1 pick, you don't put a lot of stock in that.\n\n\"You put all your work into what the ninth pick will be. Without getting into any names right now, it's the names you've probably been seeing in that range for quite some time.\"\n\nThis is the third straight year the Pistons have been in the lottery.\n\nTwo years ago, they took center Greg Monroe of Georgetown with the No. 7 pick and last year they used the eighth overall selection on Kentucky point guard Brandon Knight, who represented the Pistons at this year's lottery in New York City.\n\nDumars wasn't frustrated after failing to land the No. 1 pick for the third straight year.\n\n\"I'm fine with staying at nine,\" he said. \"You can't get frustrated when you have a 1.7-percent chance. It wouldn't be the smartest thing to do to put your hopes into hitting that. It would be nice.\n\n\"But like I said, our preparation was for the ninth pick.\"\n\nThe Pistons were in the market for a big man last season but when Knight was still on the board when it was their turn to pick eighth, they couldn't resist taking him.\n\nThey'd like a big man again this season to play alongside Monroe but if there's a player available who doesn't necessarily fit their needs but is too good to pass up, he could be their man.\n\n\"The depth from the bigs this year is a little bit deeper,\" Dumars said. \"From a depth standpoint, it probably gives you more of a chance. It's gonna come down to who that guy is, those guys coming in to work out and interviewing those guys.\n\n\"You go in with a priority of addressing your needs. If that player doesn't meet the needs you have in terms of the type of player he is or fitting in to your team, we absolutely take the best player. We still have needs but as you saw with us last year, if we don't feel that player is there, we're going to take the best player available.\"\n\nSome of the players who have been projected as possible No. 9 picks in various mock drafts include Ohio State power forward Jared Sullinger, Duke shooting guard Austin Rivers and Baylor power forward Perry Jones.\n\nOther players who have been projected to be available around the ninth pick include center Tyler Zeller and power forward John Henson of North Carolina, power forward Arnett Moultrie of Mississippi, shooting guard Jeremy Lamb of Connecticut and power forward Thomas Robinson of Kansas.\n\nSome mock drafts also have Lamb and Robinson going in the top five.\n\nThe last five No. 9 picks in the NBA draft were Kemba Walker of Connecticut to Charlotte last year, Gordon Hayward of Butler to Utah in 2010, DeMar DeRozan of Southern California to Toronto in 2009, D.J. Augustin of Texas to Charlotte in 2008 and Joakim Noah of Florida to Chicago in 2007.\n\nOther No. 9 picks over the years have included Amare Stoudemire in 2002, Rodney White (by the Pistons) in 2001, Shawn Marion in 1999, Dirk Nowitzki in 1998, Tracy McGrady in 1997, Charles Oakley in 1985, Dale Ellis in 1983 and Cliff Levington (by the Pistons) in 1982.\n\nStoudemire and McGrady were selected straight out of high school.\n\nThe draft is June 28.\n\nEmail Brendan Savage at\n\nand follow him on Twitter at"
