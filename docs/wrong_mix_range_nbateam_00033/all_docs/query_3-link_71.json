        "text": "It sounds like The Matrix will not be showing at NBA arenas after this season.\n\nCavaliers veteran forward Shawn Marion says he will retire after this season — his first in Cleveland and 16th overall in the NBA.\n\nThe 36-year-old Marion, who told the Arizona Republic of his decision, did not make himself available to the media prior to Wednesday night’s game against the Utah Jazz at Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nMarion cited wanting to spend more time with his 8-month-old son — his first child — as the main reason for wanting to step away.\n\n“I wanted to go out on my terms,” Marion said in the Arizona Republic’s story. “The biggest thing is having a son. I got attached to him. Seeing him periodically is hard. Watching him grow up on pictures and videos is hard.”\n\nCavs head coach David Blatt spoke before Wednesday’s game as if he did not know of Marion’s decision.\n\n“This is a great professional that’s played the game at a high level for 16 years and is a terrific teammate,” Blatt said. “A great guy. A super performer. At the end of the day, with Shawn, whenever that day comes (for him to retire), whether it be this year or next year, he’s going to have to be in the discussion for the Hall of Fame. This is just a great pro.”\n\nMarion chose the Cavs this offseason to make another run at a championship ring and because of the proximity to Chicago, where his son lives.\n\nAfter signing for the veteran’s minimum, Marion was considered a bargain. Although a player whose value has always needed to be measured through the intangibles that he brought to the floor, Marion’s stats have been a bit disappointing this season in Cleveland. He entered Wednesday’s game averaging 5.6 points on 42.3 percent shooting and 4.0 rebounds. He has never averaged single-digit points in a season. Marion is primarily playing off of the Cavs bench after starting earlier in the season.\n\nBut this is not the version of Marion that made the 6-foot-7 forward one of the NBA’s most unique and versatile players for more than a decade.\n\nA ridiculous athlete in his younger days and someone who patterned his game after Scottie Pippen, Marion features a short-arm jumper and an unorthodox array of floaters and running shots.\n\nHe guards multiple positions and always has rebounded well for his size. In fact, Marion is one of eight players 6-7 or shorter in NBA history to accumulate 10,000 career rebounds.\n\nMarion helped Dallas to the 2011 NBA championship, but his best years individually happened in Phoenix. The Suns drafted him ninth overall in 1999. In 8 1/2 seasons in Phoenix, the versatile Marion averaged 18.4 points, 10.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.9 steals and 1.4 blocks. His best season came in 2005-06, when he registered career bests of 21.8 points per game, 11.8 rebounds per game and a 52.5 field-goal percentage.\n\nMarion is one of four players in NBA history to accumulate 17,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals and 1,000 blocked shots, joining Hall of Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone and future Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett.\n\nMarion is a four-time All-Star and a two-time All-NBA third teamer.\n\nBIG FELLA CAN PLAY\n\nTimofey Mozgov’s overall game has impressed LeBron James, who found one ability of Mozgov’s particularly surprising.\n\n“How fluid he runs the floor,” James said at the Cavaliers morning shootaround for Wednesday’s game against the Utah Jazz. “He doesn’t look like a 7-foot-2 guy when he runs the floor. He’s very polished. He can get up and down. He changes end to end better than any big I’ve seen at that size. It’s huge for our team.”\n\nCavs head coach David Blatt coached Mozgov for four years (2009-12) with the Russian National Team, a time capped by the Russians winning the bronze medal in the 2012 London Olympics.\n\n“He just got better and better every year,” Blatt said. “… Timo has worked very hard and progressed at every stage of his career. Obviously, now he’s a bona fide NBA player.”\n\nNEW BLOOD\n\nJames feels the recent addition of Mozgov, J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert to the Cavs has provided a boost of energy. Shumpert, coming off a dislocation of his left shoulder, should make his Cavs debut before the end of the week.\n\n“Just having these three guys here, they’re all about team and they want to play well,” James said. “They want to do what’s best for the team. They play hard. They just have no sense of entitlement. You can love that when you have guys come on your team that just all they care about is how we can be successful as a team and everything else comes second.”\n\nCANTON CONNECTIONS\n\nThe Cavs recalled rookie guard Joe Harris for Wednesday night’s game after he played with their D-League affiliate, the Charge, in a 109-107 double-overtime loss to Delaware in Canton in the morning. Harris played 39 minutes and scored 18 points on 6-of-22 shooting, including 3-of-12 from 3-point range in the D-League game, which tipped at 11 a.m. Harris was active for the Cavs’ 7 p.m. game. Tristan Thompson joked with Harris that he should get paid time-and-a-half for his workday. … Former Charge head coach Alex Jensen is in his second season as an assistant coach with Utah. Former Walsh University guard Lamar Skeeter also is with the Jazz as a player-development coach. Skeeter spent the 2012-13 season as a basketball operations intern for Jensen with the Charge. Last season, Skeeter was a player-development/video intern for the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nTHIS AND THAT\n\nBlatt coached Utah guard Joe Ingles in Israel last season with Maccabi Tel Aviv. Ingles is a native of Australia. … Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona and general manager Chris Antonneti attended Wednesday’s game. … During Monday’s win against the Bulls, each Cavs’ starter scored at least 15 points (James 26, Smith 20, Kyrie Irving 18, Kevin Love 16 and Mozgov 15). According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the last time the Cavs did that was March 16, 1993 (Mark Price 20, Gerald Wilkins 19, Larry Nance 19, Brad Daugherty 19 and Craig Ehlo 16). … James tied Price for sixth place in franchise history Wednesday in games played at 582.\n\nReach Josh at 330-580-8426 or josh.weir@cantonrep.com"
