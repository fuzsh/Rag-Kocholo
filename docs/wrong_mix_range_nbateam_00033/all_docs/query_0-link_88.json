        "text": "by Jack Maidment\n\nSo apart from the fact that they have the most divisive owner in the entire NBA, what else do the Dallas Mavericks have to arrest your attention?\n\nSure everyone is talking about the Los Angeles Lakers and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Boston Celtics and San Antonio Spurs are also receiving a large amount of heat. Even the Portland Trailblazers, Orlando Magic and the Denver Nuggets are at the very least on people’s Championship radar. Dallas Mavericks as actual viable contenders? Not for most people.\n\nSince their capitulation in the Finals against Miami swiftly followed by their, uh, capitulation to the Golden State Warriors the Mavericks are very much the NBA’s forgotten team.\n\nThey make the Western Conference Semi Finals and yet are rewarded by just about no faith in their ability to go any further this coming season. Boston, LA and Cleveland closely followed by San Antonio, Portland, Orlando, maybe Denver. It will be one of those teams that gets their hands on Larry in June.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nThe core that pushed Denver so close returns with the exception of their back up big man Brandon Bass who has signed with the Magic. That means that the best scoring power forward in the NBA today, Dirk Nowitzki, will try to lead a squad forward that has done just about nothing but improve since their exit in the 2009 playoffs.\n\nThe Spurs may have added Richard Jefferson. The Cavaliers may have added Shaquille O’Neal. But don’t sleep on the move that the Mavs made to bring Shawn Marion to Dallas this off season.\n\nRegardless of his past two seasons in which his production has suffered as a result of changing locations and team members The Matrix remains one of the most versatile players in the League today. A combination of size, quickness and athleticism realistically allow Marion to cover any player on the floor and create a tricky match up problem on offense. Points, rebounds, assists, steals. You name it, Marion does it.\n\nImagine the unique skills of the former Phoenix Sun and imagine the possibilities of him playing with Jason Kidd on the fast break.\n\nNow imagine the offensive capabilities of a squad made up of Jason Kidd, Josh Howard, Marion, Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Terry and JJ Barea.\n\nThe one piece that the Mavericks lack is a legitimate athletic big man to hold down the middle as was exposed by the ultra mobile front three of the Denver Nuggets in last years playoffs. Marion’s defensive prowess helps relieve this problem slightly, but the lack of absolutely quality big men in the West and the league in general should allow the Mavs to live with the best teams in the paint.\n\nThey will hope that their offense can counteract their defensive deficiencies.\n\nWill the Mavericks win the title next year? The talent on their roster suggests that writing them off completely would be foolish and such a dismissal would only put you in the horrible position to receive an ‘I told you so’ from Sports Most Gracious Owner, Mark Cuban, if Dallas prove everybody wrong.\n\nI’m playing it safe.\n\nby Jack Maidment\n\nShawn Marion has agreed to join the Dallas Mavericks in a sign and trade deal with the Toronto raptors which also includes involvement at least one other team.\n\nMarion will move to the Mavs on a 5 year, $40 million contract, with Jerry Stackhouse and his enticing contract moving to the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nBy signing Marion and then trading him the Raptors will receive around $3 million from Dallas: important cash when considering the amount of money Toronto has committed just recently.\n\nMemphis will give up one draft pick to Dallas for Stackhouse’s contract which guarantees him just $2 million for next year, giving the Mavs the elbow room to sign a player who they hope can send them over the top.\n\nBy going after Marcin Gortat and Shawn Marion, the Dallas Mavericks will certainly move up in people’s Conference predictions especially given the strength of their returning core: Jason kidd, Josh Howard and Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nMemphis are also actively pursuing Allen Iverson, offering the guard a 1 year, $5 million contract.\n\nSuch an offer only serves to illustrate the extent to which Iverson’s stock has dropped in recent times: only a brave man would have betted on Iverson’s demise when he left Philadelphia for the snow of Denver.\n\nThe fact is that nobody really wants to take a gamble on Iverson who harmed his reputation substantially during his time in Detroit. There was a time only a year ago that Iverson would not have even considered a trip to Memphis; widely considered one of the least desirable locations in the League.\n\nQuite simply there is not the money around to spend, but more than that team’s just do not want him.\n\nA sad time for basketball."
