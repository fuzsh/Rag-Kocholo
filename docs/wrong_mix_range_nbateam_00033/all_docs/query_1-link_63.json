        "text": "Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker is one of the top 35 home grown basketball players in our great nation, USA Basketball announced on Friday.\n\nBooker is the youngest buck in the pool of potential Team USA players. The 35 will be whittled down to 12 by the time the Olympics rolls around, but even being in the 35 is a huge boost for Booker and the Phoenix Suns, who have not had a player on this roster since the days of Shawn Marion and Amare Stoudemire.\n\nBooker is one of five new players added to the USA Basketball pool. He joins C.J. McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers), Khris Middleton (Milwaukee Bucks), Isaiah Thomas (Los Angeles Lakers), and Myles Turner (Indiana Pacers).\n\nHere’s the rest of the list:\n\nHarrison Barnes (Dallas Mavericks)\n\nBradley Beal (Washington Wizards)\n\nJimmy Butler (Minnesota Timberwolves)\n\nMike Conley Jr. (Memphis Grizzlies)\n\nDeMarcus Cousins (New Orleans Pelicans)\n\nStephen Curry (Golden State Warriors)\n\nAnthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans)\n\nDeMar DeRozan (Toronto Raptors)\n\nAndre Drummond (Detroit Pistons)\n\nKevin Durant (Golden State Warriors)\n\nPaul George (Oklahoma City Thunder)\n\nEric Gordon (Houston Rockets)\n\nDraymond Green (Golden State Warriors)\n\nBlake Griffin (Detroit Pistons)\n\nJames Harden (Houston Rockets)\n\nTobias Harris (Los Angeles Clippers)\n\nGordon Hayward (Boston Celtics)\n\nKyrie Irving (Boston Celtics)\n\nLeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\nDeAndre Jordan (Los Angeles Clippers)\n\nKawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs)\n\nDamian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers)\n\nKevin Love (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\nKyle Lowry (Toronto Raptors)\n\nVictor Oladipo (Indiana Pacers)\n\nChris Paul (Houston Rockets)\n\nKlay Thompson (Golden State Warriors)\n\nKemba Walker (Charlotte Hornets)\n\nJohn Wall (Washington Wizards)\n\nRussell Westbrook (Oklahoma City Thunder)\n\nUSA Men’s National Team managing director Jerry Colangelo on what’s next:\n\n“While we do not have an official competition that we need to prepare for in 2018, the selection and announcement of our new pool of national team members and this year’s July minicamp are important first steps in our preparations to defend the FIBA World Cup and Olympic titles we won during the last two quadrenniums,” said Colangelo. “This year’s minicamp is an opportunity for us to continue and expand the culture, brotherhood and camaraderie that has been built.\n\nThat July minicamp will be held in spectacular Las Vegas, Nevada at UNLV’s Mendenhall Center. Daily practices will be held from 7/25-27.\n\nGregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs is still the coach of the National Team. Twelve of the guys above will compete in the 2019 USA World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nBooker was a member of the USA Basketball Select Team in 2016. That team trained against the USA National Team.\n\nWill he be one of the 12 competing internationally in 2019?"
