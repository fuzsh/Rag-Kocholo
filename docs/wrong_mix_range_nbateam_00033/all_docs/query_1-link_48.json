        "text": "HOUSTON -- A push from the Detroit Pistons plus an MVP performance by LeBron James decided an NBA All-Star game that went down to the final seconds.\n\nTrailing by 21 points, the East rallied for a 122-120 victory Sunday night behind King James and the Pistons' Fab Four.\n\nThe East didn't wrap it up until hometown hero Tracy McGrady of the Houston Rockets missed a jumper with the clock ticking down. Kobe Bryant had the ball slip out of his hands for a turnover, and it hardly mattered that Vince Carter missed a breakaway dunk on the other end just before the buzzer.\n\nMcGrady led all scorers with 36 points. The 21-year-old James, playing in his second All-Star game, scored 29 and led the comeback.\n\nDetroit teammates Chauncey Billups, Rasheed Wallace, Ben Wallace and Richard Hamilton, all selected as reserves from the team with the league's best record, came off the bench together to help the East rally.\n\nLooking forward to next year\n\nHOUSTON -- The curtain hadn't dropped on All-Star weekend in Houston, and already players were thinking about next year's game.\n\nWho could blame them? Las Vegas is on the itinerary.\n\nThe NBA is taking its midseason showcase to the Strip next season, and it figures to be a good time. The basketball? Maybe not so good.\n\n\"We might have to cancel practice next year,\" Boston's Paul Pierce said.\n\nNo matter. All-Star weekend is no longer about basketball, anyway. Rather, it's a chance for athletes and entertainers to party.\n\nThe NBA players were hardly the only stars around Houston, not with Eva Longoria, Diddy and Julianne Moore taking in the All-Star Saturday night events from courtside seats, and Beyonce, Jay Z and Terrell Owens out on the town afterward.\n\nLas Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman said bringing the game to his city will be like \"the heydays of a great Tyson fight.\"\n\n\"Hollywood and entertainment people are in Las Vegas on a regular basis,\" said Rossi Ralenkotter, the president and chief executive of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. \"Sports stars and legends from all sports are in our town, and now you bring in the best basketball there is in the world, the NBA All-Star game. Combine that with their legends, it is going to be a tremendous weekend for all the participants.\"\n\nCommissioner David Stern called the event a \"celebration,\" and no city is more synonymous with living it up than Las Vegas.\n\n\"It's going to be crazy out there,\" Phoenix forward Shawn Marion said.\n\nMarion played in college at UNLV, and he'll be back in the city in July when the U.S. national team holds training camp there.\n\n\"They got plenty of venues out there for places to have big parties and just to hang out and do whatever you want to do out there,\" he said. \"Vegas is just a city that never sleeps, so it's going to be a blast.\"\n\nThis will mark the first time the NBA is holding the event outside a league city. While there are risks in holding the game in a city overloaded with temptations, Stern also knows that plenty of rewards are possible.\n\nHe praised the job Houston did in preparing for this year's game but emphasized that Las Vegas, with its 135,000 hotel rooms, can make a big event bigger.\n\n\"We were so oversubscribed here,\" Stern said. \"What started out as 13 hotels went to 25 hotels, and on Thursday of this week I got the call that we are still 100 rooms short. I don't think we're going to have a room shortage in Las Vegas.\"\n\nTies between athletes and betting have always been a concern, highlighted of late by the gambling ring said to involve an assistant coach on Wayne Gretzky's Phoenix team and the NHL great's wife. Before committing to Las Vegas, Stern insisted there be no betting lines on All-Star weekend events in 2007.\n\nHe said he has no problem with people legally gambling. But he stressed that the presence of gambling is the reason he can't put an NBA team there -- even if Las Vegas officials eager for a major pro team hope the 2007 game will make him reconsider.\n\nThere's another benefit for Stern in putting the game in Las Vegas. While some players often find an excuse to get out of All-Star games in order to get a few days off, that seems unlikely next year."
