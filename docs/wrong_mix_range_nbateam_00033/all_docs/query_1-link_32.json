        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. - Shawn Marion had 20 points, and O.J. Mayo and Vince Carter scored 15 apiece as the Dallas Mavericks fought off a late Orlando surge and beat the Magic 111-105 on Sunday night.\n\nThe Mavericks led by 13 in the fourth quarter, before the Magic pulled within a basket in the final minute.\n\nDallas earned its seventh straight road victory in its series against Orlando. The Mavericks now have five days off before hosting division-leader San Antonio on Friday.\n\nGlen Davis led Orlando with 24 points, followed by Jameer Nelson with 20 and J. J. Redick's 18.\n\nMavericks coach Rick Carlisle said Dirk Nowitzki, who played in his 15th game following offseason knee surgery, may need until February to get back to full strength. The former MVP finished with 12 points and seven rebounds. He scored six points in the first half, but was active with some early assists as Dallas built a small cushion after digging out of an early hole.\n\n¦ Nuggets 121\n\nThunder 118 OT\n\nDENVER - Kenneth Faried scored the go-ahead layup in overtime, and the Denver Nuggets overcame 30-plus point games from Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook to beat Oklahoma City, snapping the Thunder's six-game winning streak.\n\nCorey Brewer scored 26 points, including 15 in the fourth quarter, to lead the Nuggets, who reversed a 20-point loss to Oklahoma City last Wednesday. Danilo Gallinari added 18 points and Faried finished with 16 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nThe Thunder, who beat Dallas in overtime Friday night behind a career-high 52 points from Durant, lost for the first time in five overtime games this season. They got 37 points from Durant and 36 from Westbrook.\n\nThe game was a difficult one emotionally as well for Thunder coach Scott Brooks, whose 79-year-old mother, Lee, died on Saturday.\n\n¦ Raptors 108, Lakers 103\n\nTORONTO - A worn-down Kobe Bryant called it a \"sub-par\" performance. For the Los Angeles Lakers, it was the latest in a string of similar efforts by a struggling team.\n\nLandry Fields had a season-high 18 points and 10 rebounds as the Toronto Raptors sent the Lakers to their fifth straight road loss.\n\nBryant scored 26 points and Pau Gasol had 25 for the Lakers, whose road skid is their longest in six years. Dwight Howard was ejected after drawing his second technical foul with 1:18 left in the first half.\n\nHoward got his first technical for arguing after a missed jump shot with 4:43 left in the first quarter. The star center was tossed after he and Anderson were called on a double technical when they got tangled up after a free throw. Howard finished with five points in 17 minutes.\n\n¦ Pistons 103, Celtics 88\n\nAUBURN HILLS, Mich. - Rookie Andre Drummond had 16 points and seven rebounds, and the Detroit Pistons returned from Europe with a victory over the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe Pistons lost to the New York Knicks in London on Thursday, but they didn't look particularly weary in their first game back. Detroit blew an 18-point second-quarter lead before pulling away again in the second half. Boston never led.\n\nDrummond went 5 of 6 from the field, repeatedly slipping free for dunks. He also made 6 of 8 free throws after entering the game shooting 39 percent from the line.\n\nKevin Garnett scored 16 points for Boston, and Rajon Rondo had eight points, 15 assists, nine rebounds and nine turnovers."
