        "text": "As the summer progresses, I'm going to write about what I think would benefit the Pistons most as they look to rebuild from such a forgettable ending to a prodigious era of Detroit basketball.\n\nJoe Dumars has made it known that each and every player is going to be evaluated and potentially used to improve the team:\n\n\"When you're at this point in your transition, you have to use whatever resource you have to get better. When I say resource, I'm talking players, too.\"\n\nWhile there have been numerous rumors about players that the Pistons could try to obtain, they are not set on just one player. Carlos Boozer leads the free agent class of 2009, and the Pistons have been rumored to be a potential suitor for the forward.\n\nI, however, no longer have any interest in bringing the forward to Detroit.\n\nIt's not that Boozer isn't a good player, because I'm sure he could come in here and make an immediate impact, but it's going to take more than one player to rebuild this team. Every dollar of the approximate $20 million that the Pistons will have to reconstruct the team must be spent wisely, which brings me to my first trade possibility.\n\nThe New Orleans Hornets are in dire financial trouble, and have made it clear that they are looking to shed salary. Before the trade deadline, they traded Tyson Chandler for two expiring contracts, but it was later rescinded due to health issues with Chandler. The Pistons are prime candidates to rescue the Hornets this offseason with the following potential trade offer.\n\nThe Pistons can do this by offering to trade Tayshaun Prince, Kwame Brown, their 2009 first-round pick and the Timberwolves' 2009 second-round pick for David West and Tyson Chandler.\n\nAt first sight, this seems a bit lopsided, but New Orleans would definitely entertain an offer similar to this. Many executives around the league value Prince highly and would be interested in his services, but David West is an all-star and will require a bit more than just Prince.\n\nThe Hornets would probably accept something along the lines of Chandler for Brown due to the immediate $7 million relief in salary from the trade, as well as Brown's $5 million expiring contract at the end of the year.\n\nThis year's draft is very top-heavy and is one of the weaker classes in recent memory. Yet, the Pistons would still have both their own and Toronto's second round pick in the draft as well. The trade would add roughly $6 million to the Pistons' salary for next year.\n\nWith this trade, the Pistons would have a lineup of Rodney Stuckey, Rip Hamilton, David West and Tyson Chandler with a hole at small forward. There are a few players in this year's free agent class that could help the Pistons immensely if they were to bring in West and Chandler.\n\nShawn Marion is high-profile player that will be looking for a big contract this summer. He's been an important part of the many successful seasons that the Suns have had in recent history and is one of the best defenders in the game today. Though I have no clue what he will demand this summer, chances are the swingman would be looking for $10-12 million per season; a salary that the Pistons could afford to pay.\n\nLamar Odom is also another player that, similar to Marion, is looking for a rather large payday. He would play the same role that Marion would, and could act as another scoring option to take the load off of Hamilton and West. He will also be looking for a contract similar to Marion.\n\nThe Pistons could also look to bring in another scoring guard and shift Hamilton to the three spot. Ben Gordon would be a prime candidate to fill the role and the Pistons have the money to lure him here.\n\nWith the economy in it's current standing, Carlos Boozer will probably earn around $15 million per season from his new team. Gordon will be a bit cheaper than Boozer and the Pistons have the money to offer.\n\nRegardless of what the Pistons will do, there are plenty of options for Joe Dumars to explore. Whether he plans to make this a one-year plan or extend it with hopes of signing a big name in 2010, nobody knows. However, the city of Detroit will not stand for another year of mediocrity."
