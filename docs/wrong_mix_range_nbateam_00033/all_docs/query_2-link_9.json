        "text": "Shawn Marion, the do-it-all pogo stick forward for the Phoenix Suns’ groundbreaking Seven Second or Less era, was inducted into the franchise’s Ring of Honor on Friday.\n\nThe ninth overall pick in the 1999 Draft, Marion was a mainstay of Suns playoff teams and nightly double-double despite plays rarely being called for him. A four-time All-Star, he spent the first 8 1/2 seasons of his career with the Suns, teaming with fellow stars Amar’e Stoudemire and Steve Nash to advance to the Western Conference Finals in 2005 and 2006.\n\nMarion’s combination of athleticism, shooting and rebounding allowed Phoenix to play him at power forward and Stoudemire at center, a precursor to the smaller and offense-oriented lineups that have become commonplace since.\n\nMarion averaged 18.4 points and 10 rebounds with the Suns, and ranks among the franchise leaders in minutes (2nd), rebounds (2nd), steals (2nd), blocks (3rd) and points (5th).\n\n* * *\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
