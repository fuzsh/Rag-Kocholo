        "text": "Atari officially divested itself of Star Trek Online and Champions Online developer Cryptic Studios. Chinese company Perfect World purchased the developer for 35 million Euros, or roughly $50 million.\n\nPerfect World Entertainment has made a lot of money in the free-to-play space, and may yet push Star Trek Online in this direction as well. As for Atari, they’ll use 21.6 million Euros ($30 million) to help pay off their debt to BlueBay credit facility with the rest going towards the companies efforts in social, mobile and licensed gaming efforts.\n\nWhen the PS Vita releases, Sega will be right there with a new version of Virtua Tennis. Sega West CEO Mike Hayes is, in fact, very bullish on the system overall.\n\n“We had Virtua Tennis World Tour on PSP when it first came out. It was one of the biggest 3rd party sellers – obviously bigger in Europe than it will be in the States, but we’ve managed to use a lot of the functionality of Vita. And we’ve made it very clear we’re going to support Sony with that title,” said Hayes. “It’s interesting on Vita – technically it’s brilliant, it’s beautiful, and it’s really great to play. And Sony has made it very clear they want to target core gamers primarily. So we take that on board with the titles that we’re going to bring out.”\n\n“The nice thing about the Vita, I think, is ultimately going to be the range of software pricing types that you can put on it so it’s not just the high end game at the high end price, said Hayes. “You can do the mid-point, more like your XBLA or PSN titles and of course maybe even a small bite size of more app type software. For me, the strength of that device is the whole spectrum of software, that will either sell as physical or as digital. That, I think, is a big point of difference for us as a developer.”\n\nSource: IndustryGamers {link no longer active}\n\nReports are that executive vice president of Electronic Arts’s Play Label Jeff Karp is leaving the company after 11 years to join Zynga. He was most recently in charge of EA’s social efforts and he joins former EA chief operating officer John Schappert at the social giant.\n\nThis promotion comes after a management shuffle at EA that saw executives like Peter Moore, Andrew Wilson and Frank Gibeau promoted. Karp is among the many high profile departures from EA of late, including NBA Jam co-creator Mark Turmell, Madden producer Phil Frazier, an unnamed EA Tiburon boss before that, and EA Easy Studio boss Ben Cousins resigning one day after Visceral Games boss Scot Amos.\n\nSource: develop-online.net\n\nModern technology played a part in organizing the recent series of London riots, with Blackberries and Twitter used by riot instigators, with hacks threatened against RIM if they give out customer information to law enforcement. However, those same forces are being used to unite clean up efforts by the local community.\n\n“After everything that happened last night, it’s good to see people can come together for something other than looting,” said resident Jina Creighton.\n\nClean up efforts have been has been improvised but enthusiastic. People read about the effort on twitter and have been showing up by the dozens.\n\n“The police are stretched to the limit, so it’s down to them doing what they can and the people helping out,” said Alex May, a 32-year-old software engineer and clean up volunteer. “But the problem is that the riots happened in the first place. It’s something that has to be dealt with in the longer term.”\n\nTwenty-one-year-old bartender Charles Jupiter set up a “Liverpool Clean Up” Facebook page put 100 volunteers onto the streets Tuesday morning. I thought, ‘Not in my city’,” Jupiter said. “People were posting, ‘I’m embarrassed to be English, I’m embarrassed to be from London or Liverpool.’ I reposted and said, ‘I’m not. That’s why I’m going out there to help clean up.'”\n\nMost of the volunteers vowed to return to help with the clean up if the riots erupt again.\n\nSource: AP {link no longer active}\n\nNintendo has suffered from communication problems with the 3DS, since it is hard to convey its 3D capabilities without actually looking at the device. Wii Sports designer Katsuya Eguchi indicates that Nintendo faces a similar struggle when it launches Wii U late next year.\n\n“You’re absolutely right, those are just some of the huge challenges ahead of us – getting people to really understand what Wii U can offer,” acknowledged Eguchi. “We have some experiences here right now – with Chase Mii and ‘shield Pose’ – and we have a great opportunity to give people time to play the games, so we’ll take advantages of expos, conferences and in-store demos.\n\n“But we really want people to understand how the TV screen and controller screen interact and how that changes the experience. And we’ve come up with a variety of uses, he added. But you’re right, we can’t explain them all, and I don’t even think we’ve thought of them all. I’m sure there are many uses that haven’t been thought of yet.”\n\nSource: Edge\n\nA survey by Telenav found that 50 percent of Americans would rather give up caffeine, chocolate or exercise for a week rather than their smartphones. Interestingly, a third would give up sex as compared to their smartphones and 22 percent would be willing to part with their toothbrushes.\n\nPeople are increasingly connected to social networks and online means of communication adults increasingly admit to sleeping with their phones and checking them often for fear of missing anything. Psychologists even discovered that most people would rather use their cellphones than directly interact with other human beings.\n\nSource: businessinsider.com\n\nNintendo has had to cut the price on the 3DS as a way to revitalize its portable gaming business. However, M2 Research analyst Billy Pidgeon says that selling hardware is not enough for the company.\n\n“Nintendo needs to change its business fundamentally … Selling in hardware is important, but Nintendo must increase attach rates and third party opportunity dramatically,” said Pidgeon. “Lower 3DS hardware prices only address part of the problem. It’s more important to sell more software as packaged goods and paid digital downloads to each customer who buys a hardware unit.”\n\n“I would like to see Nintendo cut the retail price of packaged software to a range of $20 to $25 for the 3DS. DS software should be $20 or less, adds Pidgeon.\n\nSource: IndustryGamers {link no longer active}\n\nNielsen is looking to push out its long-awaited internet Campaign Ratings, which will be the equivalent of GRPs for television. They will also include Facebook users along with select Nielsen homes.\n\nThis is a large feather in Nielsen’s cap, and online reaches audiences that the television just doesn’t anymore. Advertisers crave the stability that the GRP offers for television in an online standard.\n\n“For packaged-goods, insurance, financial services, quick-serve restaurants and movie studios, this is your bread-and-butter and how you spend 80 percent to 90 percent of your budget,” said Dave Morgan, CEO of Simulmedia. “You cannot sell advertising to these folks unless they have a sense of the total audience they are reaching.”\n\nIssues that have to be dealt with for online, however, are improper targeting, cluttered environments and fraudulent impressions. “We find most of our CMOs are less and less concerned with audience buys and more concerned about the performance of that investment,” said Wes Nichols, CEO of Marketshare partners.\n\nHopefully the move will help expand online advertising budgets from the world’s largest advertisers towards online, which is a change long overdue.\n\nSource: AdAge\n\nThe NPD Group has long been the best source of games sales data, though an increasing large blind-spot they’ve had is with digital sales.
