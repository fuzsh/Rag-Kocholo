        "text": "Until he wandered into The Baltimore Sun in the fall of 1959 and found his calling in life, it would be fair to say that my father suffered from an acute identity crisis. Though his given name was George Melvin, no one called him that, if only to avoid confusion with my grandfather. Around the rowhouse in East Baltimore where Dad grew up, everyone always called him Sonny. As a high school athlete who lettered in three sports, he was known as Otts, the origins of which are unclear. In his incarnation in later years as a fledging bush-league baseball player, he adopted the sobriquet Randy because he felt it created the illusion that he could run faster. I’m not kidding. He actually thought that.\n\nDad was an uncertain work in progress during those years. When his baseball career was snuffed out by a beanball in an independent league game in North Dakota in 1956 — or so he always said — he had no portfolio on which to fall back.\n\nHe had graduated 10th from the bottom of his class in high school and had dropped out of college by Thanksgiving of his freshman year. He worked various blue-collar jobs until he landed a gig at a radio station in Washington, where he provided the “crowd noise” for Brooklyn Dodgers game re-creations by the announcer Nat Allbright. As Allbright cobbled together the play-by-play from wire dispatches, Dad chimed in from the background: “Peanuts! Peanuts here!” It was only when Allbright found Dad’s on-air skills wanting and let him go that Dad found his way to a low-level reporting position at The Sun, where he began writing under the byline of Mark Kram and became an accidental palindrome — his full name was spelled the same backward as forward.\n\nI use the word accidental because Dad always swore that, far from any intention on his part, it just sort of happened. My mother, Joan, backs him up on that. “You were born and we named you Mark because I always liked it,” Mom explained. “It just so happened that I married a man named Kram. Neither of us knew then what a palindrome even was.”"
