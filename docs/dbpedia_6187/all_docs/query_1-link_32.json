        "text": "jenna wortham\n\nI’m Jenna Wortham.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI’m Wesley Morris. We’re two culture writers at The New York Times.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd this is Still Processing.\n\n[music]\n\nwesley morris\n\nJenna.\n\njenna wortham\n\nYes.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI want to run something by you.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAll ears.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWell, first of all, how much of that Derek Chauvin trial did you watch?\n\njenna wortham\n\nYou know, not much. I did catch clips that were shared through social media. So I did catch bits and pieces of the testimony. But I did not have my TV on, catching the coverage full time. Absolutely not. How about you?\n\nwesley morris\n\nOnce it was clear that I was seeing a thing that I’d never seen before, I just — I couldn’t not watch it. I was struck by the gathering of all of these people who witnessed Derek Chauvin being atop George Floyd that day on the corner of 38th and Chicago in Minneapolis, Minnesota and their explanation of what their relationship was to the incident, why they were there in the first place. But one of the first things that came to mind was “Sesame Street.”\n\njenna wortham\n\n[LAUGHS] My mans, what are you talking about? That is the wildest thing you could have said. That is the — I trust in the thought process, but you have to understand that’s the wildest thing you could have said.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI know. And the reason was that there was something about this idea of a community announcing itself or being formed in the presence of this awfulness. And I thought about who are the people in your neighborhood, right? You know, the song, (SINGING) who are the people in your neighborhood, in your neighborhood?\n\nAnd I thought about Mr. Hooper, who owned the grocery store on Sesame Street. Louise and Gordon and Big Bird and Grover and Maria and all these people, they’re not just individuals, right? Together, they form this ecosystem that becomes what we, in the audience, understand to be Sesame Street. And these are the people in this neighborhood who happen to be there on the corner of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, where the gathering spot was one of those one-stop mini marts. It was called Cup Foods. And there was the store clerk and the police officer, and some MMA fighter and a firefighter. These people were grown-ups, and they were 20 and 17 and 8 years old. And you just had this gamut of life.\n\nAnd watching them there that day on the stand, I just was struck by how this disparate collection of human beings united to tell a story about how a man lost his life.\n\njenna wortham\n\nRight.\n\nwesley morris\n\nJenna, I don’t know if you happened to see Donald Williams, who is the mixed martial arts fighter. He was a voice in the video, but I didn’t know who he was. But he testified. And the defense attorney asks him what he’s saying to Derek Chauvin while Derek Chauvin is on top of George Floyd.\n\narchived recording (eric j. nelson)\n\nYou called him a tough guy.\n\narchived recording (donald williams ii)\n\nI did.\n\narchived recording (eric j. nelson)\n\nYou called him bogus.\n\narchived recording (donald williams ii)\n\nI did.\n\narchived recording (eric j. nelson)\n\nYou called him a bum at least 13 times. And those terms grew more and more angry. Would you agree with that?\n\narchived recording (donald williams ii)\n\nThey grew more and more pleading for life.\n\narchived recording (eric j. nelson)\n\nAll right.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThat’s actually what got me interested in the trial, to be honest, because the way he’s talking about how his emotions will and will not be used against him. The spatial awareness he has around what the defense is going to try to depict him as, and his refusal to play into these dynamics of stereotypes of an angry Black man, blew me away.\n\narchived recording (eric j. nelson)\n\nSo, again, sir, it’s fair to say that you grew angrier and angrier.\n\narchived recording (donald williams ii)\n\nNo, I grew professional and professional. I stayed in my body. You can’t paint me out to be angry.\n\njenna wortham\n\nHe was not going to play into it. I felt really proud of him for what he was trying to do in terms of voice his upset and not have his emotions used against him, which is such an old historic tactic for Black people in this country, right?\n\nwesley morris\n\nYes.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd it felt old and new in the same moment in this way that was so powerful to me.\n\nwesley morris\n\nRight, and the next day, Genevieve Hansen testified. And she is the firefighter who was off-duty that day. And she tried to use her professional training with respect to C.P.R. and life-saving to direct the police in how to care for George Floyd.\n\narchived recording (genevieve hansen)\n\nI would have checked his airway. I would have been worried about his spinal cord injury because he had so much weight on his neck. I would have opened his airway to check if there are any obstructions.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd her offers were obviously rebuffed.\n\narchived recording\n\nWhen you couldn’t do that, how did that make you feel?\n\narchived recording (genevieve hansen)\n\nTotally distressed.\n\narchived recording\n\nWere you frustrated?\n\narchived recording (genevieve hansen)\n\nYes.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI didn’t see that testimony, but hearing you talk about it is making me think so much about why people are calling for less policing, right? I mean, this person is a firefighter. They are trained to save lives, full stop. Ask questions later, right? The police actually did the opposite. They show up, they assess a threat and sometimes people die. And it’s interesting to think about this woman describing what she would have done had she been able to give the chance. She would have given him medical care. She inherently saw his life as valuable.\n\nAnd I mean, that is embedded in what the organizers of Minneapolis want from police reforms. They actually want there to be emergency responders sent out — not police — in emergencies, because of that approach in their training and that orientation and their mindsets. And it was just so, so clarifying to me to hear that.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThen there was Christopher Martin, who was 19 and was the Cup Foods clerk who told his manager that George Floyd was trying to use a fake $20 bill to buy a pack of cigarettes. And in his testimony, he talked about how he had tried two times to get George Floyd to come back into the store to settle things before the manager called the police. And he says at some point, if I would have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided.\n\narchived recording\n\nI saw you standing there with your hands on your head for a while, correct?\n\narchived recording (christopher martin)\n\nCorrect.\n\narchived recording\n\nWhat was going through your mind during that time period?\n\narchived recording (christopher martin)\n\nDisbelief and guilt.\n\narchived recording\n\nWhy guilt?\n\narchived recording (christopher martin)\n\nIf I would have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided.\n\nwesley morris\n\nHe just seemed so heavy. And he was as regretful as everybody else who took the stand in those first couple of days who was there on the scene that day. And there was more heaviness when Darnella Frazier testified. And she was there outside the Cup Foods with her cousin when they happened upon the scene. And she, of course, shot the video that the world saw. And during the trial, the camera doesn’t show her face. It doesn’t show the faces of any minors as they testify. And yet you could hear her and her testimony was incredibly emotional.\n\narchived recording (darnella frazier)\n\nWhen I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad. I look at my brothers. I look at my cousins, my uncles, because they are all Black. And I look at that, and I look at how that could have been one of them.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI’ve been thinking so much about Darnella Frazier and the Darnella Fraziers of the world, because she’s not the only one. Thinking also of Ramsey Orta, who shot Eric Garner’s death in Staten Island in 2014. And just the trauma of playing that role that is so integral and so important, but also so devastating, I mean, the most important thing you can do while someone loses their life is hold up your cell phone, thinking about this young person who is still a child. 17 is still a baby. I’m sorry, it is. And I think in that moment, all she can think about is her fear for her community because everybody’s Black, including her. And she is naming the existential fear that all Black people share when something like this happens.\n\nWe understand that, to some degree, the person in the film, the person in the photo, the person in memoriam is interchangeable with all of us. So just keeping in mind, right, this is someone who is now 18 years old, someone who has yet to go out into the world, figure out who they want to be in life, and yet, here they are, on the stand, grappling with these huge existential questions of being and rightness and wrongness and morality.\n\nBut there’s something about the way the actions of one man have ruined not just the life that he took, but the lives of every single person in that blast radius on that day because they all feel devastated. And this is why even though your “Sesame Street” reference kind of bedevils me, it actually makes a lot of sense. Because it’s not like this was an arbitrary corner.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYes. The other thing, Jenna, that I was struck by while I was listening to all of this testimony was that they were all, in their different ways, trying to stop what was taking place from getting worse. And they all were trying to —\n\nI don’t know — inflict themselves upon the incident. I mean, not physically, but morally prevail upon the incident as a collective. And it just reminded me that what they were doing was essentially functioning as a Greek chorus.\n\nAnd Greek choruses, their job is essentially to underscore the truth by saying what’s happening. By the way, just to be clear, this is a very ancient form of artistic expression of dramatic expression. And it’s usually a group of people. You’ve seen these things function in plays and operas and that sort of thing, where it’s a bunch of people usually in robes or togas with a mask on. And they are functioning and moving as a group together. And in these plays, whether they were by Sophocles or Escalus or Euripides, and their point is to basically comment on the action for the audience and verify for it that what they’re watching has meaning and to prevail upon the characters to behave differently.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI see it. I see it now. I see what you’re saying, mm-hmm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYou can see this playing out in an opera, right? These figures in however they’re going to be dressed, standing on one side of the stage, while Derek Chauvin and George Floyd and the other three officers are on another side of the stage. And one side of the stage is pleading with the other to do a different thing.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThat’s right.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd the other additional sort of Greek concept that came to mind while thinking about the chorus was that fate brought this chorus together, you know? And how in these ancient plays the chorus was also the community. What you’re watching in this moment is this community get formed. And I’m not a really big fan of the term “community.” I don’t love it in that like I feel like it’s overused and misused.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThat’s right.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThere’s a golfing community. There’s a space community. There’s, I mean, obviously, the Black community, but used to explain Black people all over the country and every region. I think what people are talking about racialized communities, where we’re talking about A.A.P.I., well, that is an extremely varied group of people. And I mean, I do understand that there’s a aligned interest there. But I also find it incredibly reductive to have to use these shorthands to describe complicated things that aren’t entirely representative of the individual people or communities within these communities.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI hear your outrage, and I agree. What you’re responding to, of course, is the collapsing of nuance that has happened. Again, for the sake of convenience, we talked about this many times on the show. It has been appropriated by every app, software developer, platform, person in Silicon Valley to describe the group of users that use their thing. It’s like the Facebook community, the Instagram community. And I think it’s a term whose definition is very malleable. And I think that community means many things to you. There’s the community that encapsulates the geographic area within which you live. And there’s the role that you play in it, right? Because there can be multiple communities functioning within that neighborhood. I live in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.\n\nThere are so many communities under my nose that I’m not a part of. And I also think something has happened in the last year, though, where because we’ve been dealing with Covid-19, who was in your life became something that you had to be extraordinarily intentional about. So many people have had to think about who they want to be adjacent to and what that means. And then also this bigger question of how communities are responding to and meeting whatever is happening in this moment.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd I think what was so thrilling to me about seeing these people come together over the course of this trial was that it seemed in their gathering at 38th and Chicago that day that they were meeting a classic rational definition of what a community is, which is basically a group of people with some kind of common interest or characteristic living with each other in some larger society.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThe way I experienced that gathering, Wesley, was through social media, right? I made a very intentional choice not to watch the trial in real time. But of course, I wanted to know what was going on. And social media really offered so many perspectives. They were contextualizations by scholars, lawyers, academics, former journalists, current journalists, people who had been wrapped up in the court system following cases like this for decades, offering nuances and just so much more information.\n\nIt was really interesting for me as well, right, coming out of last year and all these discussions around abolition and what it meant to get rid of police institutions. How does that square with, then, the sort of push towards a shared outcome in this trial? And to hear people grapple with those two ideas in really philosophical, engaging ways, I mean, it was just so — it was so enriching in a way that I would not have gotten, had I just been reading the daily dispatches.\n\nwesley morris\n\nRight, they were doing the work for you in some ways.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd with me, right? Because otherwise, I’m just alone in my home, trying to make sense of what’s happening. And there was something so affirming about basically taking my seat in the Greek chorus and turning to my left and turning to my right and hearing what everybody wanted to whisper in my ear. So I always imagined — in my mind, I’m always imagining the Greek chorus as fluttery, gauzy fabric-wearing entities that are whispering truth into the main character’s ear.\n\nPeople were mapping out the geographical proximity of George Floyd’s death to Philando Castile’s death, to Dante Wright’s death. And just another thing that really moved me, there was a series of tweets about how interconnected, right, all these people were and are. So one example was George Floyd’s girlfriend was Dante Wright’s teacher. These aren’t isolated events. These are affecting a larger community.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYes, I think that one of the reasons that I was so fascinated by the trial was that it was astonishing to realize what it took to achieve what ultimately wound up happening with respect to the verdict of Derek Chauvin being convicted on all three counts, right? And many people have made this point. This is what it took. It took a community of people coming together, remaining united in their purpose, all telling a consistent story about a thing they saw.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThat’s right.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd that gathering of people for that trial was doing a lot of the work that certain artists claimed to be doing in their films and television shows when it comes to telling stories about Black people in Black life. Jenna, I’m not saying that the trial was a work of art. I’m just saying that there’s an art to conducting a trial. And part of that art involves people being convincing and telling a strong story. Putting on this trial is a production. And I was much more compelled by its outcome than lots of other things I watched that were meant to entertain and thrill me in some way.\n\nSo we’re going to take a break. And when we come back, we’re going to talk about a couple of works of art that have tried to meet their moment without seeming to exploit the moment at the same time.\n\n[music]\n\nOK, so we’ve talked about Sesame Street as being a kind of easily digestible, easily understood idea of community. But then there’s this conversation that you and I are having now about community is reminding me of a movie that you and I have talked about at least twice on this show. And that’s Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing,” a movie he wrote and directed and was released in the summer of 1989. That, to me, is the greatest American movie ever made about community or about a community. And the way the community functions in this movie is so crucial to what happens from the first scene to the last scene.\n\nAnd it’s set in a Brooklyn neighborhood called Bedford Stuyvesant. And the action basically is located to about one block. And just like on “Sesame Street,” which had Mr. Hooper’s grocery store, and in the George Floyd tragedy, there was Cup Foods as the locus of the action, in “Do the Right Thing,” it’s Sal’s Pizzeria. And there’s a guy who goes there pretty often, the way George Floyd was a known customer at Cup Foods.\n\nAnd there’s some tension that eventually arises with the police, mostly because this one character is insistent that the neighborhood pizzeria reflect the people who live in the neighborhood and not these people who don’t live in the neighborhood, which, in the case of Sal’s, is a bunch of Italian people.\n\narchived recording (buggin' out)\n\nHey, Sal, how come you don’t got no brothers on the wall here?\n\narchived recording (sal)\n\nYou want brothers on the wall? Get your own place. You can do what you want to do. But this is my pizzeria. American Italians on the wall only.\n\narchived recording (buggin' out)\n\nRarely do I see any American Italians eating in here. All I see is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI mean, it’s interesting because the movie does feel like a play in so many ways. I’m just thinking of —\n\nwesley morris\n\nSo many ways.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI’m thinking so much about how Mother Sister’s just kind of always hanging out of the picture window, like in this kind of exaggerated cartoon window to represent the very real phenomena of elderly women hanging out their window, commenting on the action. But the way it looks in the movie, it is very “Sesame Street” as well.\n\narchived recording (mother sister)\n\nGood morning, Mookie.\n\narchived recording (mookie)\n\nGood morning, Ms. Mother Sister.\n\narchived recording (mother sister)\n\nNow, Mookie, don’t work too hard today. The man says it’s going to be hot as the devil. I don’t want you falling out from the heat. You hear me, son?\n\narchived recording (mookie)\n\nI hear you, Mother Sister. I hear you.\n\narchived recording (mother sister)\n\nGood.\n\njenna wortham\n\nBut the movie’s about so many things happening around this pizza shop. It’s about ideas of ownership. It’s about racial tensions. It’s about how this business functions in a historically Black neighborhood. The sons of the owners in the pizza shop really seem to loathe the Black residents of the neighborhood, and it creates this tension, right?\n\nwesley morris\n\nRight. Well one does, yes, yes.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd the tension is about access to fresh foods. It’s about how reliant this neighborhood is on this pizza place and also the role that this pizza place plays. And how it is that it is a reluctant part of this community, but isn’t really invested in supporting the community, just making money off of it. And this is all unfolding at a moment in time when this neighborhood is becoming desirable. And there’s this great scene that aims to capture all those conflicting interests and social histories, the confluence of them in the film. And so, there’s this white guy who’s walking his bike through the neighborhood. And they’re like —\n\narchived recording (buggin' out)\n\nWho told you to walk on my side of the block? Who told you to be in my neighborhood?\n\narchived recording (clifton)\n\nI own this brownstone.\n\narchived recording (buggin' out)\n\nWho told you to buy a brownstone on my block in my neighborhood on my side of the street?\n\njenna wortham\n\nHe’s a gentrifier. And the way that this interaction unfolds is still so pertinent to this day. I mean, that movie is so timeless. And we did make a whole episode about it. So if you want to listen, check it out because we really go into it deep. But I do think there are so many parallels between the Sal’s Pizzeria in “Do the Right Thing” and the Cup Foods that exists in Minneapolis, in the sense that it is at the center of so much commerce and life.\n\nAnd I’m just speaking from my own experience of having gone and spent a week or so there. So I spent a lot of time at the memorial for George Floyd. I spent a lot of time right outside that Cup Foods. I spent Juneteenth at a barbecue on that block. You know? I spent a lot of time there last summer.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWow, yeah.\n\njenna wortham\n\nPeople live there. There’s a Dairy Queen right there. There’s a Performing Arts Center. There are laundromats, barbershops, barbecue joints, I mean, apartments. So it is really interesting. I think “Do the Right Thing” is a helpful comparison to think about how important this place was and how really complicated in terms of the neighborhood. I mean, it’s a neighborhood where people are desperate for more grocers and access to healthy foods. But all they have is this place that’s Cup Foods that has this contemptuous relationship with the community. Something I heard when I was there quite a bit was this place has been racist. They treat us all like garbage. And it already was creating this tension in the neighborhood between the store owners and the people that live there.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI mean, a lot of the people who were sort of citing Do the Right Thing last summer, when George Floyd actually died, went right to the fact that that movie culminates in the death of a character, who’s Sal’s regular. His name is Radio Raheem. He makes his way around the neighborhood with a giant boombox that plays one song. It’s called “Fight the Power” by Public Enemy.\n\narchived recording\n\nYo, that’s the only take you got?\n\narchived recording (radio raheem)\n\nYou don’t like Public Enemy, man? That shit’s dope.\n\narchived recording\n\nI’m down. But you don’t be playing nothing else.\n\narchived recording (radio raheem)\n\nI don’t like nothing else.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd this is the guy who dies, a guy who — I mean, I think he’s liked in the neighborhood. I mean, for the movie’s purposes, he’s kind of polarizing in some ways, because he just sort of walks around the neighborhood with his radio and just blasts music all day.\n\narchived recording (radio raheem)\n\nTwo slices.\n\narchived recording\n\nNo service till you turn that shit off!\n\nwesley morris\n\nI mean, he’s part of the assault on the pizzeria, right, where he goes in with the radio and “Fight the Power” is blasting. And Sal basically trains his anger at Radio Raheem and has this bat. And the thing that starts the melee is when Sal takes his bat and beats Radio Raheem’s boombox.\n\narchived recording 1\n\n[SHATTERING]\n\narchived recording 2\n\nI just killed your fucking radio.\n\nwesley morris\n\nSo the customers standing in the pizzeria at that moment start to tear it apart. And by the end, what we have is a community that is, if not destroyed, then definitely in incredible disrepair. Businesses are damaged. Houses are burned. In the middle of this climax as Radio Raheem is losing his life, there are people screaming at the cops, stop it! You’re killing him. He can’t breathe.\n\narchived recording (crowd)\n\nYou’re killing him!\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd it does nothing. And at some point, one of the other officers is like, yo, let him go. At some point, there’s a shot of Radio Raheem’s wiggling sneakers. He’s been lifted off the ground by this cop, who’s got him in that chokehold.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd that scene with the shoes, it’s so devastating because you really understand how helpless Raheem is in that moment and how helpless everybody is in that moment. You know, Wesley, I really, really, really appreciate the space we hold together and the ability to have this conversation with you because I haven’t been able to grasp the enormity of the trial and the scope of it.\n\nAnd talking about it through the lens of these fictional properties, whether it be trying to understand through something like “Sesame Street,” which is really trying to teach viewers about responsibility, shared responsibility, shared respect, shared rules, about ethics and community guidelines and what it means to be in proximity to other people. And then an entity like “Do the Right Thing,” which is also trying to explore what it means to be in a community that can also turn into a pressure cooker. It’s trying to explore how these micro explosions and then macro explosions happen within these incredibly intimate and familiar spaces that, typically, the people involved in these moments are not strangers to each other.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWell, one thing about being able to use “Do the Right Thing” as a way to think about the Derek Chauvin trial is the fact that “Do the Right Thing” is 32 years old.\n\njenna wortham\n\nOh, god.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThe ultimate tragedy of this movie is that it is going to be ageless, right? It’s not going to need any help from a plastic surgeon to look as good now as it did in 1989. Its age has given it a kind of wisdom, whereas when it came out, it was received as being incredibly incendiary and troublemaking. And —\n\njenna wortham\n\nSure, I can see that.\n\nwesley morris\n\n— people were complaining about the fact that it was going to cause riots of its own and that Spike Lee wasn’t trying to solve the racial gap in this problem. He was driving it further apart —\n\njenna wortham\n\nOh, god.\n\nwesley morris\n\n— rather than just reflecting what was actually going on. And in all that discourse, Spike Lee winds up the winner, obviously.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThat movie was ahead of its time, but it’s perfectly primed for right now because all people seem to want is art that explains what’s happening right now.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI mean, we’re drowning in things that are trying to capture the feeling of what racism is like in this country and what a constant danger it is for Black people. And a lot of it is violent. And it’s set within a genre. And sometimes that genre is horror. And sometimes it’s science fiction. Sometimes in the case of a show like “Lovecraft Country,” it is both. But the predominant theme that’s at work in a lot of this stuff is racism. And some of this stuff is trying to be realistic.\n\nBut a lot of it ends up being violent, or they’re redundantly violent, often for the genre’s sake. The best live action short Oscar this year went to a movie called “Two Distant Strangers” that basically takes this dynamic between a young Black man and a white police officer and turns it into “Groundhog Day,” where every time the Black man gets shot by the white officer, the day resets, and he has to sort of eventually figure out a way to not get shot. On the one hand, it’s a great metaphor for the problem, right? And on the other hand, if you’re not prepared to watch that sort of thing, you have to watch a Black man get shot by a police officer many, many, many times.\n\njenna wortham\n\nJesus.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd in addition to “Two Distant Strangers,” which is still playing on Netflix, I believe, and “Lovecraft Country,” which is on HBO, there’s “Them” on Amazon. There’s ‘Queen Insulin” from a few years ago and, to a certain extent, “Judas and the Black Messiah,” which is built around the F.B.I. and its attempt to bring down Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party in Chicago. And these are all movies and television shows that are written by, directed by, created by, produced by, starring Black people. And they purport to speak to an aspect of what’s so difficult about being Black in this country.\n\nAnd I mean, immediately, what all these movies together remind me of is the 1970s, the Blaxploitation, what we call now the Blaxploitation era, when you had this vanguard of Black people in movies and often making movies about Black life. A lot of the movies were the same in that they were telling similar stories about crime and drug dealing and sex. And so, you fast-forward 50 years to now. And you ask the question, what are these movies having in common? It’s not crime and sex and drugs. It’s racism.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAlso, I just think we have to acknowledge, too, that there are a lot of other forces contributing to this work getting made, right? There’s just a lot of money and interest in funding things and getting things created and just meeting our appetites. And I would say that I’m intrigued by how much more stuff there is than historically. But it also means that we end up with this glut of material that doesn’t feel quite right.\n\nThe point I’m trying to make is, it has been really interesting to watch the proliferation of what people think we want to watch and consume about this moment, right? That we want more violence, that we want more horror. There is a huge case to be made for Black horror, and I’m actually very excited for “The Candy Man” remake coming out later this summer, because I just feel like we live in a type of horror movie anyway. And so but what I don’t have a lot of tolerance for right now is just being subject to watching brutality on screen as a way to somehow legitimize the violence that we’re experiencing in our regular lives.\n\nI don’t need to see Black people brutalized. I don’t need that in my newspaper, and I don’t need it on my screens at night. No, thank you. It’s not just that I don’t want work that deals with trauma. But it has to be more than that. It has to do something else with it, more than just, let’s watch these traumatized people as a way to validate their experience. That’s not validating for me.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI think that the genre in most of these properties is coming first, right? And so you’re not really having this conversation among everyday people. And the achievement of a movie like “Do the Right Thing” is, there was no genre for it, right? It was a movie about people. And the people were the problem. And the problem was the people. But what this work that’s happening now is really not doing in a lot of cases is really pitting human beings against each other. They’re like aliens and monsters and the F.B.I.\n\njenna wortham\n\nExactly. I mean, the reason that so much of what purports to be Black horror or, I don’t know, Black realism — whatever you want to call it — the reason it doesn’t nail it is because these properties think the scariest thing about racism is the violence of it. There was this great tweet by the author Brit Bennett. She tweeted this a few days ago that really encapsulated exactly what worked about “Get Out” and why — and this was her terminology — why all the Jordan Peele knockoffs aren’t successful.\n\nWhat Brit tweeted was, the scariest thing about a movie like “Get Out” is not the white family. Sure, that family is really creepy and that auction is creepy. I mean, all the things in that movie are genuinely terrifying. But the horror in that movie is the Sunken Place. The idea that there is a place that whiteness can send you where you cannot be retrieved, as both a literal space and a metaphor, is absolutely terrifying because it has to do with what happens to your mind. Not the horror of what can happen to your body, but it’s about the total annihilation of your existence. And that’s why that movie works. It gets that.\n\nwesley morris\n\nRight, and I don’t know. There’s something about the search for empathy in art that I find rewarding and fruitful. And that is definitely not happening in a lot of the stuff we’re talking about. There’s no empathy. There’s no humanity. There’s just jolts and scares and thrills and blood and monsters and demons and blood and — I don’t know. I don’t know what kind of metaphor those things are when the metaphor is actually happening in that courtroom, for instance.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd I think for me, what the trial did was recenter the survivors, recenter the victims, recenter all the people who got waylaid, as that murder just touched off this protest, right? All these things were done in George Floyd’s name, but also, the trial was a reminder of who this person was within a community and within a world. He wasn’t on trial, but it recentered the fact that he lost his life. It recentered the survivors around him and what they were coping with in the aftermath. It just unmetaphored the metaphor. This was a real person whose life was lost, full stop.\n\n[music]\n\nStill Processing is produced at The New York Times by Elyssa Dudley.\n\nwesley morris\n\nOur editors are Sara Sarasohn and Sasha Weiss.\n\njenna wortham\n\nMarion Lozano mixes the show.\n\nwesley morris\n\nDigital production by Mahima Chablani, Des Ibekwe and Julia Simon.\n\njenna wortham\n\nA special thank you to Lisa Tobin and Wendy Dorr.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd our theme music is by Kindness.
