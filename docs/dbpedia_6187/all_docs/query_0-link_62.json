        "text": "In the past five years, how talent gets paid and who’s writing the checks has changed dramatically. As deals continue to evolve, the money managers on THR's annual power list help industry A-listers navigate the new normal.\n\nFrom making smart choices in the stock market to building a business empire, THR’s annual list of Power Business Managers highlights the people keeping finances on track for the entertainment elite.\n\nProfiles written by Winston Cho, Kirsten Chuba, Aaron Couch, Mia Galuppo, Caitlin Huston, Katie Kilkenny, Sydney Odman, Christy Piña, Georg Szalai, Etan Vlessing and Alex Weprin.\n\nJustin Stiegemeyer\n\n818 Management\n\n“If COVID taught us anything, it’s that you never know what to expect in life,” says Stiegemeyer of being a business manager (to clients like Lauren Graham, Riley Keough and Taylor Kitsch) in these uncertain times. “It can change without any notice. The idea of having money saved for a rainy day and to have ample cash to cover expenses is a valuable life lesson.”\n\nThe best place to buy a second (or third) home in 2023:\n\n“We’ve seen such a run-up of real estate prices. My best advice might be to sit tight for the next little while and see how things play out.”\n\nBelva Anakwenze\n\nAbacus Financial\n\nPointing to the push for IP ownership as this year’s biggest trend, Anakwenze — whose clients include Insecure’s Jay Ellis and Entertainment Tonight’s Kevin Frazier — also notes, “We are seeing clients get more brand deals and at larger amounts.” To boost her own brand, she has launched a YouTube show following her passion for “education in the world of financial literacy.”\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry:\n\n“There are always espresso beans in my pantry. I make a latte every morning before starting my day. It’s like the meme, ‘But first, coffee.’ ”\n\nHoward Krant and David Levin\n\nAdeptus Partners\n\nThis year Adeptus Partners, which counts Levin’s DL Business Management as a division, has added many new clients in the sports space, as well as influencers, notably TikTok star boywithuke. This rounds out a roster that includes the likes of John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, Hailey Bieber, Melissa Villaseñor, Imagine Dragons and Lake Street Dive. Says Krant of an ongoing trend among music clients, “So many are selling their catalogs to monetize their assets.”\n\nMy theme song would be …\n\nKRANT: “A Hard Day’s Night”\n\nLEVIN: “There’s a Place in the World for a Gambler” by Dan Fogelberg\n\nDavid Altman, Anthony Bonsignore, Tom Carr & Frank Selvaggi\n\nAltman Greenfield & Selvaggi\n\nTimothée Chalamet, Donald Glover, Steve Martin, Dakota Johnson, Sterling K. Brown, Sarah Jessica Parker and Jimmy Fallon are among the big-name clients of the bicoastal boutique firm, which recently elevated Josh Work, 32, to partner. The past year has been “very status quo,” notes Bonsignore. “With the way the world is, maybe people are taking a breather. I think people are a little freaked out with the way the stock market is.” Crypto also continues to attract attention, says Altman. “Some, especially younger clients, have been wanting to get more involved in Robinhood and Coinbase kind of stuff.”\n\nThe best piece of advice I’ve ever received:\n\nALTMAN: “Get an accounting degree.”\n\nCatherine Catherine, Craig Manzino & Marc Rosen\n\nArmanino\n\nRosen observes that his clients are seeing more consistency with work as pandemic shutdowns come to an end, but it’s not all good news. He says, “We are seeing less episodes being produced in TV and shorter-term development deals.” To compensate, Catherine says clients are setting their sights on “investing in themselves” by building their brands to “open up new streams of income through podcasts, TikTok and Cameo.” Their clients come from throughout Hollywood, including Oscar-winning actors, writers, choreographers, influencers and athletes.\n\nIf I could trade places with anyone in Hollywood for a day, it would be …\n\nCATHERINE: “Denzel Washington”\n\nMANZINO: “George Lucas”\n\nROSEN: “Anyone whose job it is to greenlight shows.”\n\nEvan Bell & Liza de Leon\n\nBell and Company\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic fades, Bell says that among his clients (who include Steven Soderbergh and Will Hochman), “people have been reevaluating what’s important to them.” Whether it’s a new home or “the types of projects they might take,” the pandemic’s impact on the entertainment business continues. For the firm, which also reps Cary Fukunaga and Baz Luhrmann, the focus has been on its future, with Bell noting that they’ve named three new partners in the past year.\n\nMy theme song would be …\n\nBELL: “Feelin’ Alright” by Joe Cocker\n\nPeter Stoll\n\nBills & Stoll\n\nStoll, who along with Steve Bills launched the Encino firm in 2016 after splitting off from Philpott Bills & Stoll, offers his big-name clients accounting and advisory services that run from day-to-day cash management to long-term financial planning. “We have seen a surge in how clients make substantial amounts of money through influencing,” says Stoll, whose firm has been linked with the likes of Matt and Ross Duffer, Sam Raimi and Henry Winkler. “In addition, the value of licensing deals for older TV shows has increased substantially.” Personal highlights for Stoll include holding outdoor social gatherings for his staff and his son Alec recently being elevated to partner.\n\nThe best place to buy a second (or third) home in 2023:\n\n“I generally don’t encourage clients to buy second or third homes, [but] Europe would be good as the currency rates are great for our U.S. clients.”\n\nTerry Bird & Craig Tessler\n\nChapman Bird & Tessler\n\nBird and Tessler shy away from publicity, and they certainly don’t need it. Still, Hollywood’s elite — including Tom Cruise, Angelina Jolie and Kaley Cuoco — manage to find their way to them, and other reps often refer business to them. Says Rob Strauss, a trusts and estates lawyer at Weinstock Manion who shares clients with the firm: “Craig Tessler is incredibly practical and thoughtful. He takes a no-nonsense approach when helping his clients, whether to manage their affairs or deal with their taxes. Anyone who works with him instantly knows they are in great hands.”\n\nChristopher Fank\n\nChristopher Fank CPA\n\nOscar winner Brie Larson and prolific producer Jessica Rhoades (Station Eleven) turn to Fank for their financial advice. Fank, who has appreciated getting back to face-to-face interactions as Hollywood has started its return to the office, says that the past couple of years have included fielding increased interest in cryptocurrency trading as well as juggling new and increasingly lucrative income avenues, from podcasts to onscreen cameos.\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry:\n\n“Blueberries and jalapeno-stuffed olives.”\n\nArnie Herrmann, David Leventhal, Wayne Mejia, Marc Rottenberg, Matthew Segreto & Sharon Sullivan\n\nCitrin Cooperman\n\nDespite more and more of the firm’s Hollywood A-list clients picking up lucrative — and increasingly compelling — opportunities in streaming, Herrmann says he’s still advising those he represents to avoid high-risk bets. “We have encouraged our clients to invest a bit more conservatively, with a focus on preservation of capital along with a judicious allocation to alternative investments,” he says. In addition to recently picking up Savannah Guthrie, the firm counts Jim Parsons, Ana de Armas, Guillermo del Toro and Sam Mendes as clients.\n\nThe best place to buy a second (or third) home in 2023:\n\nHERRMANN: “Jackson Hole, Wyoming”\n\nMEJIA: “Any Mexican beach resort”\n\nROTTENBERG: “Darby, Montana”\n\nShane Glass\n\nColony Business Management\n\nAfter years of bull market gains, Glass says he’s telling clients to rein in their spending. “People are remembering that the equity and fixed-income markets don’t always go up,” explains Glass, who works with clients across the entertainment industry, including Oscar- and Emmy-winning actresses, songwriters, producers, social media influencers and Nobel Peace Prize winners. Another trend he’s seeing: More of his non-Hollywood clients are trying to land roles in film and TV shows on streaming platforms.\n\nMy theme song would be …\n\n“I’ve Been Everywhere” by Johnny Cash\n\nCarrie Malcolm\n\nCRM (A division of NKSFB)\n\nMalcolm, who handles finances for talent ranging from newly minted Academy Award winner Ariana DeBose to Marvel Cinematic Universe mainstay Benedict Cumberbatch, has noticed clients are\n\nmore interested in diving into personal and creative passions outside of the traditional Hollywood mold. Whether those passions involve acting in live theater, directing opera or producing documentaries, Malcolm says, “COVID has brought us more inside ourselves and people are looking to find work that will make them happy.”\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry:\n\n“Casa Dragones Tequila Añejo and organic French-roasted Peruvian coffee beans from the Porto Rico brewing company. I believe in balance.”\n\nDavid Weise\n\nDavid Weise & Associates (A division of NKSFB)\n\nUsher, Lil Wayne and Coldplay collectively have more than 45 million followers, all of whom Weise is looking to leverage. The firm founder, who represents those Grammy-winning artists along with The Weeknd and Carole King, says there are more opportunities than ever for artists to take advantage of their massive fan bases. “These guys aren’t just musicians; they’re entrepreneurs,” Weise says. “The assets they have are being exploited now more than ever because of their fans. Their IP is a valued asset, not unlike someone with real estate or a stock portfolio.”\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry:\n\n“Almond milk”\n\nEleanor Burke, Pat Dunn, Mark Pariser & Tony Peyrot\n\nDunn Pariser & Peyrot\n\nThe team says the COVID-19 pandemic was a financial wake-up call for clients across Hollywood, including Randall Park, Giancarlo Esposito, producer David Permut and musician Justin Furstenfeld, who all look to them for financial wisdom. “Clients have finally realized that the bottom can drop out of their earning capacity overnight,” Dunn says. Adds Peyrot, “Clients are understanding the importance of maintaining a diversified asset allocation and that our approach to managing risk has paid off in this era of rising interest rates and stock market volatility.”\n\nMy theme song would be …\n\nBURKE: “Runnin’ Down a Dream” by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers\n\nDUNN: “Don’t Stop Believin’ ” by Journey\n\nPARISER: “That’s the Way of the World” by Earth, Wind & Fire\n\nPEYROT: “Gimme Shelter” by The Rolling Stones, or “Callaíta” by Bad Bunny\n\nAndrew Meyer & Steves Rodriguez\n\nFreemark Financial\n\nIn the past year, the firm has added three new partners and also saw clients take on their dream projects — like director Jon M. Chu, who’s helming the Wicked movie. Other in-demand clients include Anna Kendrick, Ramy Youssef, Dune DP Greig Fraser, Ellen Pompeo, Adam Driver and Kathryn Hahn. Meyer says it’s exciting that both domestic and international production are back in action but notes, “All eyes are carefully watching a possible looming recession and what is happening geopolitically.” Meanwhile, Rodriguez adds, “The Latin sector is being taken more seriously than ever, particularly on the music front.”\n\nThe best place to buy a second (or third) home in 2023:\n\nMEYER: “Chileno Bay [Cabo San Lucas]”\n\nRODRIGUEZ: “Montecito [California] or Telluride [Colorado]”\n\nEric Fulton, Matthew Gilbert-Aranoff & Elizabeth Ricin\n\nFulton Management\n\nIn addition to managing finances for A-list talent such as Taika Waititi, Jennifer Morrison, Channing Tatum and Liam and Chris Hemsworth, as well as pro athletes like Conor McGregor, the firm looks after top YouTube duo Rhett & Link, underscoring the growth in the influencer sphere. Says Fulton: “We were one of the first firms to enter that space a number of years ago, but we’ve seen the number of new clients signing up from that industry expand faster than most other entertainment industries.”\n\nThe best piece of advice I’ve ever received:\n\nRICIN: “Enjoy each day. The days can feel very long, but the years fly by.”\n\nTyson Beem, Andrew Crow, Todd Gelfand, Melissa Morton, Rick Mozenter & Michael Stern\n\nGelfand Rennert & Feldman\n\nThe long-running firm, which counts Jordan Peele, Judith Light, Zack Snyder, James Corden, George R.R. Martin and Bob Dylan among its clients, saw some change of its own, naming Beem its new CEO this year. Beem notes that the opportunities for artists have been growing as the number of platforms multiply, “whether that be branding\n\nand partnership opportunities, equity ownership or licensing for multiple platforms.” And Crow says that the firm’s clients “have been reflecting on how they can contribute to society,” noting that they “have been having more and more discussions about ESG-type [environmental, social and corporate governance] investing.”\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry:\n\nBEEM: “Maldon Sea Salt.

The firm counts prolific creators J.J. Abrams, Ava DuVernay and Reservation Dogs’ Sterlin Harjo as clients. Through all of the commotion — whether it be bringing fine art into an investment portfolio or helping clients upgrade a house in a hot market — “It’s been wonderful to see there is hope for return to movie theaters,” says Seth Gettleson.\n\nIf I could trade places with anyone in Hollywood for a day, it would be …\n\nH.

I would love to be a Jedi master.”\n\nWITZER: “Clint Eastwood. It would make my day.”\n\nLaura Gordon\n\nGordon & Associates\n\nAfter 31 years in the business, Gordon says her firm’s work with high-net-worth clients (including athletes, filmmakers, musicians and such actors as Nick Cannon and Amandla Stenberg) to build businesses and wealth continues to be “one of the joys and values of my life.” Over the past five years, she’s seen clients’ longtime interest in ESG investing pay off, with those stocks overperforming during the COVID pandemic: “It has [been] proven that when corporations are good corporate citizens, it helps their bottom lines.”\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry:\n\n“This past summer, for some reason, I’ve been hooked on mangoes.”\n\nHoward Altman, Corey Barash & Warren Grant\n\nGrant Tani Barash & Altman\n\nThough their firm has been connected with some of the biggest names in the business (Tom Hanks, Dwayne Johnson and Brad Pitt have been linked to them over the years, but their lips are sealed), Grant says their clients haven’t been immune from the stress of the pandemic, nor from the unsettled financial environment. One solace? Grant says many of his clients are accumulating cash, and, “Lately, short-term treasury bill yields are up, making it comfortable to keep cash reserves in short-term treasury bills after years of near-zero returns.”\n\nMy theme song would be …\n\nGRANT: “What a Wonderful World”\n\nBrett Anderson, Jeff Bacon, Chris Bucci, Rachel Martinez & Steve Savitsky\n\nGround Control Business Management\n\nMartinez is excited about how this year brought “a little bit of a return to normalcy” from the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic at the newly rebranded firm, which always remains tight-lipped about clients’ names (the unnamed cohort includes Emmy-winning showrunners, Oscar-nominated writers and top digital creators). In 2022, Bacon adds, “We’re seeing less panic and more patience from clients dealing with the market downturn and volatility” who are embracing a long-term approach to investing more wholeheartedly than in previous years.\n\nThe best place to buy a second (or third) home in 2023:\n\nANDERSON: “Camarillo, California — the last relatively affordable beachfront property town close to L.A.” BACON: “Texas”\n\nMARTINEZ: “Kauai”\n\nMarie Ambrosino\n\nGursey | Schneider\n\nOutside of helping clients like Mindy Kaling, Jenji Kohan and Seth MacFarlane navigate the ever-shifting financial landscape, Ambrosino has spent the past year focused on getting back into the office. While some pandemic habits are holding over — the firm has hired multiple remote employees — Ambrosino is back in the throes of a forever constant: tax season. As for newer trends, she says endorsements are becoming more of a cornerstone of earning power: “[Talent] can earn more with one tweet or Instagram post than with 10 episodes of television.”\n\nThe best piece of advice I’ve ever received:\n\n“Run your own race.”\n\nMara Hofman\n\nHolthouse Carlin & Van Trigt\n\nThis year, Hofman has seen her clients grow more “intentional in evaluating investment opportunities,”\n\nwith an emphasis on real estate, building liquidity and “an increased focus on asset allocation and overall risk management.” Her client base includes box office and television stars as well as behind-the-camera writers, producers and film financing companies. As for how Hollywood players are earning, Hofman says there’s been a shift toward more “equity-based compensation” in endorsement deals.\n\nThe best piece of advice I’ve ever received:\n\n“From my mother and grandmother: ‘You can’t always control what is happening around you, but you can control your attitude.’ ”\n\nLiz Kenney\n\nL&L Business Management\n\nKenney’s clients range from Oscar winners to box office stars, including Tiffany Haddish, Awkwafina and Dustin Lance Black. The best part of the job? Getting “to see dreams come true and people living their best life,” says Kenney, who runs her full-service firm out of Burbank. Over the past year, she has noticed that her clients have become more and more interested in moving outside of California, a trend that seems to have gained traction amid the pandemic.\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry:\n\n“Red licorice.”\n\nLiz Campos\n\nManhattan West\n\nCampos is director of business management at investment firm Manhattan West, where she advises A-list clients including Hollywood stars, music producers and NFL players and focuses on financial literacy. “We have clients thinking twice about their purchases and the power of a dollar,” she says. “For instance, they can spend thousands of dollars at a nightclub, something that provides no value, or invest that money and benefit from the compounding effects of interest/dividends.”\n\nMy theme song would be …\n\n“All the Way Up” by Fat Joe and Remy Ma featuring French Montana\n\nSteve Gelon, Van Lee, Alex Smith & Justin Sroka\n\nMann Gelon Glodney Gumerove Yee\n\nThe firm, which advises clients ranging from Chuck Lorre and Riz Ahmed to Logan Paul, has seen an increase in setting up out-of-state ING (incomplete non-grantor) trusts, which Smith says help to “realize certain types of income events outside of California so they can remain here while minimizing taxes.” Sroka also notes the trend of “content creators to become multiple-platform celebrities working with the largest talent agencies and brands,” and Gelon has seen “showrunner clients who have made a living running network TV shows only wanting to run shows for streaming companies.”\n\nIf I could trade places with anyone in Hollywood for a day, it would be …\n\nGELON: “Justin Timberlake”\n\nLEE: “Charlize Theron”\n\nSMITH: “Leonardo DiCaprio”\n\nSROKA: “Bob Iger”\n\nJohn McIlwee\n\nMcIlwee & Associates\n\nMcIlwee aims to create a sense of financial safety and security for clients, who include Jane Lynch, Matt Reeves, Caleb Landry Jones and TikTok star Chris Olsen. “Your finances play into your psyche, both with the public perception and a personal perception,” he says. “The world is on the verge of chaos and spinning off its axis. So the last thing anybody needs is to be disconnected from their financial state.”\n\nIf I could trade places with anyone in Hollywood for a day, it would be …\n\n“Can I do the obvious one? Harry Styles.”\n\nJohn Blakeman & Anna Levin\n\nMGO\n\nLevin notes that this year, like in all years, she’s enjoyed the “intellectual feast” of her work, allowing her to tackle different types of projects and investments for clients. This duo keeps their star client names close to the vest, but Blakeman says he’s excited his group will be “making [an] impact on humanity through creative projects” in the coming year and that their “activism is thriving.”\n\nMy theme song would be …\n\nBLAKEMAN: “Lose Yourself” by Eminem\n\nMark Landesman, Scott Landesman, Jessica Mooney & Paul Zukowsky\n\nML Management\n\nThe firm, which reps such A-list talent as James Cameron, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot, also has a stronghold on the comedy scene, with Chris Rock, Tina Fey and Jason Sudeikis among its clients. Mark Landesman sees growth opportunities in podcasting, in particular for comedians, some of whom had to be off the road for the past few years because of COVID. “It’s the Wild West, where everyone is doing it now,” he says. Meanwhile, Mooney notes it’s easier than ever to get branding opportunities “separate from their regular work in entertainment.”\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry:\n\nS. LANDESMAN: “Chocolate chip cookies”\n\nMOONEY: “Sparkling water”\n\nGary Kress & Brian Murphy\n\nMurphy & Kress\n\nServicing such a diverse group of top-tier talent, it’s no surprise the professionals at Santa Monica-based Murphy & Kress prefer keeping their eyes on the books and private money flows rather than stepping onto red carpets. THR has linked the Hollywood moneymen with clients like Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez, Denzel Washington and Jeff Goldblum. The fact that Kress and Murphy fly under the radar is a selling point — some of Hollywood’s most well-connected players name the duo as trusted advisers — and their firm has been strong since the 1980s.\n\nRyan Conlon & Harley Neuman\n\nNeuman + Associates (A division of NKSFB)\n\nWith clients like Scarlett Johansson, Zoe Saldaña, Alexandra Shipp, Ryan Murphy and John C. Reilly, just\n\nto name a few, Conlon and Neuman had a busy year, especially as talent continues to explore new kinds of work. Conlon notes, “I really enjoyed watching our clients branch out into other areas of entertainment they haven’t traditionally worked in, like podcasting or Broadway, and finding a lot of success and personal fulfillment.”\n\nThe best place to buy a second (or third) home in 2023:\n\nCONLON: “Ireland”\n\nNEUMAN: “Montecito”\n\nDavid Bolno, Bernie Gudvi, Michael Karlin, Michael Oppenheim, Matt Segal, Mickey Segal, Larry Tyler, Dian Vaugh\n\nNKSFB\n\nTimes of economic uncertainty are when business managers shine, and the current environment is no exception. For NKSFB, which has clients at the top of their game across entertainment, including Justin Timberlake, Jessica Biel, Beyoncé, Drake, Bruno Mars and Conan O’Brien, that means they “want and need more services to feel that their financial positions are protected and can withstand these declining markets,” Mickey Segal says. But there are still pockets of opportunity — take live music. Notes Karlin, “A lot of the uncertainty of touring is in the rearview mirror.” And, adds Gudvi, seeing clients “in their atmosphere and succeeding means a lot.” Meanwhile, Bolno says, “As the digital economy expands, the diversity for places to grow wealth becomes more robust.”\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry\n\nOPPENHEIM: “Ice cream with sprinkles”\n\nMATT SEGAL: “String cheese”\n\nTYLER: “Coconut water”\n\nMartin Meeks & Aaron Philpott\n\nPhilpott Meeks\n\nMeeks says that, until this year, low interest rates combined with higher-than-normal market returns have allowed for people to increase their spending without seeing their wealth drop. He now advises, “Time to get back to the basics: Spend less, save more.” Hollywood’s most influential power players, including Dick Wolf, Jerry Bruckheimer and Nicolas Cage, turn to Meeks and Philpott to manage their finances. The duo are proud to say most of their clients haven’t bought into the crypto craze. Says Meeks, “All the crypto fanatics have been awfully quiet.”\n\nThe best piece of advice I’ve ever received …\n\nMEEKS: “You can have anything you want, you just can’t have everything.”\n\nMichael Ullman\n\nPlatinum Financial\n\nFor Ullman, sustainability is at the forefront of this year’s financial trends. “I see more clients buying electric vehicles, installing solar panels and making sure part of their investment portfolio is in green markets,” Ullman notes. With a client list including Margot Robbie, Miles Teller, Linda Cardellini and Brooke Shields, Ullman is grateful that his firm continued to expand this year amid the ongoing uncertainty of a postpandemic landscape.\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry:\n\n“Pickles and sparkling water”\n\nBarry Siegel, Jeff Turner & Bill Vuylsteke\n\nProvident Financial Management\n\nAfter the live music industry took a major hit due to the pandemic, Vuylsteke — who reps such big-time bands and musicians as Green Day, Weezer, Sheryl Crow and Red Hot Chili Peppers — says that “getting everyone back on the road is really exciting.” With offices in California and Nashville, Provident’s clients also include Al Pacino, Elijah Wood, Lucy Liu and Angela Bassett.\n\nMy theme song would be …\n\nVUYLSTEKE: “You Can’t Always Get What You Want”\n\nTara Beaudine-Moore, Abner Monegro & Phil Sarna\n\nPS Business Management\n\nAs artists return to the stage, Beaudine-Moore has seen an increase in residency-style performances, which she expects to continue. “Fans can make traveling to a destination to see their favorite artist part of the fun,” she says. This firm has a keen eye on the entertainment space thanks to an in-demand roster including Billie Eilish, Halsey, Lizzo and Benny Blanco. Sarna adds that clients’ cultural relevance is creating opportunities with corporate partners.\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry\n\nBEAUDINE-MOORE: “All the cheese.”\n\nJason Brown, Anna DerParseghian & John Power\n\nPTD Business Management\n\nDuring the past year, DerParseghian, who advises the likes of Yvonne Strahovski and Uzo Aduba, says she’s seen more artists taking control of and monetizing their own content. “Female clients are writing roles for themselves and creating material that was not available to them previously,” she notes. She’s also a proud investor in the Angel City Football Club, which she says is “exhilarating and eye-opening.” Meanwhile, Brown says his comedian clients are reinvigorated to be back on tour, “which led to them recording fantastic hourlong specials in front of diehard fans.\n\nIf I could trade places with anyone in Hollywood for a day, it would be …\n\nBROWN: “The Rock”\n\nDERPARSEGHIAN: “Geena Davis”\n\nLia Sweet & Bill Zysblat\n\nRZO\n\n“Post-COVID attitudes have changed dramatically,” says Sweet. “We are seeing less spending on the most extravagant items, like boats and planes, as the industry realizes there are events beyond anyone’s control which can put an immediate stop to earnings.” The duo, along with RZO partner Tom Cyrana, advise a who’s who of music acts: The Rolling Stones, Sting, Lady Gaga and U2. As touring picks back up, Zysblat notes, “The trend to work and tour in a bubble, limiting guests backstage, limiting the leaving of hotels, is becoming the norm.”\n\nMy theme song would be …\n\nSWEET: “Money Changes Everything”\n\nZYSBLAT: “Taxman” by The Beatles\n\nMatthew Burke\n\nSinger Burke\n\nBurke is a go-to adviser for behind-the-scenes power players including showrunners and other creatives involved with The Handmaid’s Tale, Yellowjackets, The Witcher and Bridgerton. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Encino-based firm, which is a pioneer in using database technology and software. “The pandemic accelerated adoption of technology that has facilitated not only more flexibility in our work but also tremendous growth,” Burke says. “We’ve increased our headcount around 20 percent and grew our investment assets under management beyond the $1 billion mark.”\n\nSteve Campeas\n\nSJC Business Management\n\nL.A.-based Campeas works with influencers and stars like Chiwetel Ejiofor, Katee Sackhoff, Lana Condor, Rebecca Romijn, Lala Kent and John Stamos. He prioritizes both building long-term wealth and covering short-term financial needs even in volatile markets. Campeas notes a “continued increase in the sums of money being made by social influencers,” and adds that “clients are becoming more aware of world issues and the effects they have on them personally and financially.”\n\nThe best place to buy a second (or third) home in 2023:\n\n“Valencia, Spain”\n\nJoel Mandel, Rob Mandel & Erica Wright\n\nThe Management Group\n\nThough they avoid talking to the press about themselves and their clients, this trio has built key relationships in Hollywood and comes highly recommended by reps for some of the biggest names in the industry. Through public records and other research, the firm has been linked to a starry client roster of actors (Michelle Williams, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bryce Dallas Howard), directors (Judd Apatow), writers (Steve Levitan, Greg Daniels) and producers (Brad Falchuk, Evan Goldberg and Peter Chernin).\n\nPhil Ramos\n\nThxPhil Business Management\n\nCelebrating his firm’s seventh anniversary servicing Hollywood talent, Ramos has noticed that clients are becoming more fiscally conservative. “Work includes making sacrifices, like being away from home for long periods of time,” says Ramos, whose clients like John Wick helmer Chad Stahelski and action movie duo David Leitch and Kelly McCormick (Bullet Train) are always in demand. “It has created a deeper sense of appreciation for the fruits of that labor — and less interest in unnecessary spending.”\n\nOne thing that’s always in my refrigerator/pantry:\n\n“Cocoa Pebbles has been my guilty pleasure for years.”"
