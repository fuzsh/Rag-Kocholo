        "text": "Destination USA\n\nThe Founder’s\n\nGuide to US Expansion\n\nRead the book\n\nThe Index Ventures experience\n\nOur insight\n\nIndex Ventures partners with founders, across both Europe and the US, who are building world changing businesses. Operating at this level of ambition requires dedication, grit, and a relentless focus on doing what is best for your company. In the majority of cases, taking on the behemoth that is the US market is a necessity to achieve global leadership.\n\nWe have supported more than 40 European tech companies that have expanded to the US, including 9 that have gone on to become public companies. Being involved at every step of the journey - planning, launch, and scaling - has taught us a great deal about the opportunities and pitfalls.\n\nIndex also has personal experience of crossing the Atlantic, being the only European-born VC firm that has successfully expanded to the US. We now have a team and portfolio equally balanced across both continents. Much of the advice in this book therefore reflects not just the learnings of the entrepreneurs we work with, but our own first hand experience of launching and scaling in the US.\n\nTransforming into a global tech player by making it in the hyper-competitive US environment is a daunting challenge. This guide has been written to help you. We provide frameworks you can use to plan and execute the right combination of strategic, tactical and practical moves. We aim to help you understand what you need to do, when you need to do it, and how to do it, in order to win in the US.\n\nChanging landscapes\n\nFifteen years ago, building a major tech business in Europe was extremely difficult. Faced with a paucity of tech-savvy customers, talent and capital, founders often chose to relocate their businesses to the US as early as they could. Zendesk and MySQL are prominent examples of European-born companies that moved over in their entirety at Series A, and continued to build their companies successfully from there.\n\nToday, conditions are very different. Europe has many success stories, including two tech leaders, Adyen and Spotify, approaching $50bn valuations. At the same time, building an engineering team in the Bay Area is more challenging and expensive than ever. With these forces in play, founders have more choices about how long, and in what capacity, to remain in Europe.\n\nStarting in Europe nowadays can have advantages; technical talent is more available (and affordable) than in the US, and employees tend to be more loyal. Europeans, with smaller domestic markets, also tend to think internationally from day one, which is much less common in the US. And certain sectors, including finance, luxury, travel, and gaming, have a rich heritage in Europe, offering domain expertise and partners that can actually give Europe a competitive edge versus the US.\n\nAs a result of this evolution in Europe, we are seeing four distinct trends.\n\ni) Startups are further along in terms of scaling at the point they expand to the US than they were 5 or 10 years ago, in terms of funding, customers, and headcount. US expansion is primarily for commercial roll-out. Our survey of European and Israeli founders who have expanded to the US validates this, with 78% ranking ‘access to customers’ as their #1 reason.\n\nScore from 1-5 shows average weighting of each response\n\nii) Europe has built global B2C successes with limited US team presence by leveraging online distribution channels. For example, King, Supercell, and TransferWise achieved significant scale from their bases in Sweden, Finland, and the UK, respectively.\n\niii) Europe is building B2B successes which do not operate at all in the US. Broader adoption of digital and cloud services means that market opportunities outside of the US have widened, and we are seeing regional B2B companies on trajectories to $5bn+ valuations. iZettle, a point-of-sale payments company for small merchants, is an example of this emerging trend. Retaining its HQ in its birthplace in Sweden, iZettle raised €273m and established a strong presence across Europe and Latin America, The company was acquired by Paypal in 2018 for $2.2bn.\n\nA cohort of promising European-focused B2B companies are now addressing markets that are sizable, yet don’t necessarily translate to the US context. For example, Swile (Series C) is disrupting and digitising the market for meal vouchers - an employee benefit that does not exist in the US. Others operate in regulated sectors which are fundamentally different in the US from Europe - for example, KRY (Series D), offers remote access to primary healthcare services.\n\niv) European founders are increasingly securing funding from top US investors without needing to move to the US. US investors are increasingly willing to come to Europe looking for entrepreneurs to back. It is no longer necessary to be on the doorstep of Sand Hill Road to forge these relationships, nor to commit to moving to Silicon Valley as part of any fundraising with them. Not to mention the extraordinary growth in funding available to entrepreneurs from increasingly sophisticated European-based VC’s.\n\nSome European founders will still choose to relocate from day one, and to build their entire business in the US, following the examples of Stripe (the Collison brothers moved from Ireland), or Datadog (Olivier and Alexis moved to New York from France). While this can be a valid and exciting proposition, it is not our focus here.\n\nWe will instead focus on companies that base themselves, and build their product, initially in Europe, and that only later expand to the US.\n\nOutlier Successes\n\nOur research identified 33 European-born tech ‘unicorns’ created since 2008, and a further 23 from Israel, that have gone on to achieve success in the US. Success has been defined through a combination of total US revenues, US growth, US percentage of overall revenues, and US category leadership (top three). They span different sectors, business models, and expansion strategies. Of these 57 outliers, 43 (75%) are B2B, and 14 (25%) are B2C.\n\nColour logos indicate Index investments.\n\nOur take\n\nWe are confident that Europe will produce more and more tech success stories in the years ahead. The ambition is there, and the essential elements are coming together: strong talent pools; experienced leaders, investors, and service providers; excellent infrastructure; and generally well-regarded legal systems and regulation.\n\nSome of these startups will succeed without looking to the US, achieving a scale beyond anything we have witnessed to date, and creating tech leaders that will list on European stock markets. But the majority will still operate in global markets, with global ambitions. Europe can support the R&D and investment needs of these startups, and they will be able to sell to consumers across the world.\n\nHowever, in one area, Europe continues to slip further behind. Its corporations are still too conservative when it comes to innovative technology. They invest less in technology, and when they do, it is too often focused on compliance, rather than on business transformation. European software companies selling into enterprises are therefore forced to succeed in the US, before they are given the chance to do so in Europe. Until this changes, we will continue to see entrepreneurs crossing the Atlantic to scale and to list software companies. And the global competitiveness of European corporates will continue to be eroded.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe recommendations in this handbook are based on the most extensive research ever undertaken into US expansion by European tech startups:\n\nAnalysis of 353 European (275) and Israeli (78) VC-backed startups that have expanded into the US over the last 10 years\n\nExtensive survey covering US expansion strategies, completed by the founders of 104 of these startups\n\nDeep-dive research into the 33 European unicorns that have succeeded in the US\n\nIn-depth interviews with the founders of 23 European companies at different stages of US expansion, including 11 unicorns\n\nInsight and experience drawn from the Index team across Europe and the US\n\nAdvice from leading service providers, including lawyers, recruiters, tax advisors, and investors\n\nArchetypes for expansion\n\nOnly a small proportion of European tech companies that expand into the US grow to the scale of global category winners. For those that have succeeded, what are the strategies and factors that enabled success? And how did they design their organisations to maximize their potential?\n\nA lot of my time is spent working with founders on where they are headed, thinking ahead and helping them chart the course to where they want to get to.\n\nAri Helgason\n\nIndex Ventures\n\nWe have synthesised our analysis and case studies into four distinct archetypes. These are organisational templates that startups can follow as they expand into the US.\n\nThe archetype that is right for you will depend more than anything on how you would answer these two questions:\n\nHow large is the US as a percentage of your total addressable market (TAM), and to what extent are you focused on capturing this market?\n\nDo you need boots on the ground in order to either acquire (sales) or serve (operations) customers?\n\nOther factors can also influence which archetype is right for you, but the classic business tenet ‘follow the customer’ is still usually true today, even as software continues to eat the world.\n\nRemove all patriotism from the discussion. Be coolly rational, not emotional, and go where it makes sense for your business.\n\nMårten Mickos\n\nFormer CEO, MySQL\n\nRegardless of which of the following four archetypes is applicable, for the purpose of this book, startups tend to share similar beginnings. The founder, or founding team, is based in Europe. They have a vision for a new product or service. Europe is where they build their early product, raise angel or seed funding, and make their initial hires. Typically, the first users or customers are in Europe. Sometimes there might also be early US users or customers, either introduced via the personal networks of the founders or early investors, or acquired from marketing activity in Europe. By working with these early users, the team finds its way towards product/market fit (PMF).\n\nIt is after this phase that we start to see forks in the road, as different companies chart different courses.\n\nFirst we will outline the Compass - the extreme pivot to the US.\n\nSecond, the Anchor - a more modest expansion model.\n\nThird we will cover the ‘middle way’, or Pendulum.\n\nAnd finally the Telescope, relevant to self-serve and marketing-based models of customer acquisition.\n\nCompass\n\nAnchor\n\nPendulum\n\nTelescope\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we also mention two other approaches (neither is treated as an Archetype): Transplant, where the full team relocates from Europe to the US early in the journey, and Regional, where the company chooses not to enter the US market at all.\n\nTo determine which archetype your company is, and to visualise what you journey to US expansion might look like, check out our ExpansionPlan web app, available on the Index Ventures website, in the Resources section.\n\nSummary of Archetypes - organisation at point of listing or IPO\n\nCompass\n\nBuilt in Europe, sold in the US.\n\nFor companies with a large (>50%) US TAM, as well as the ambition to pursue it, the organisation and leadership as a whole needs to pivot to the US as its new ‘true North’. You will gravitate towards a setup where the bulk of R&D (engineering & product) remains in Europe, but the CEO moves to the US, and your GTM (go-to-market) teams are focused there. Over time, a new set of global functional leaders is hired in the US.\n\nCompass is the dominant archetype for enterprise software startups.\n\nB2B examples: Collibra, Mimecast, Algolia, Nexthink, UiPath, Unity Technologies\n\nB2C examples: None\n\nCompass - Typical Journey\n\nRaise Seed funding, and build product from Europe, establishing product/market fit.\n\nAcquire customers from the US and service them remotely.\n\nRaise Series A led by transatlantic or US investor.\n\nRefocus efforts on US versus Europe - both for sales, and for product roadmap.\n\nStrengthen product management, so the CEO can step away from day to day involvement.\n\nCEO moves to (or spends more time in) the US.\n\nBuild a small sales team in US, led by a player/coach.\n\nRaise Series B led by US investor.\n\nScale your GTM team in US - including CMO and CRO.\n\nCEO relocates (if they haven’t already).\n\nRaise Series C.\n\nAll non-technical leadership is now in the US, with the exception of a dedicated GM EMEA.\n\nRaise Series D.\n\nHire CTO and/or CPO in the US, as it’s hard to find candidates in Europe with proven experience at this scale\n\nConsider a secondary engineering centre in US.\n\nBuild customer-oriented product team in US, to complement technically-oriented product team in Europe.\n\nFurther fundraising, as required for continued expansion.\n\nList in the US.\n\nAnchor\n\nTethered, like an anchor, in Europe\n\nFor companies with a larger opportunity in Europe and the rest of the world, and a US market representing 15-30% of TAM, the centre of gravity will likely remain in Europe.\n\nThe Anchor archetype is common in situations where US expansion comes later in the journey. At this point, you will have a substantial European business to protect and grow, and a more mature leadership team in place. It will take some time for the US to become as significant a market, so you don’t want to pivot your attention and organisation there, at least initially.\n\nThe Anchor archetype is often appropriate for markets with cross-border value propositions, where Europe’s patchwork of wealthy national markets presents more opportunity than the borderless US. In the Anchor model, you leverage the leadership and expertise built in European markets, in order to launch a localised version to capture market share in the even larger US market.\n\nB2B examples: Adyen, Funding Circle\n\nB2C examples: Farfetch, TransferWise, Revolut, HelloFresh, Secret Escapes\n\nAnchor - Typical Journey\n\nRaise Seed funding, and build product from Europe, establishing product/market fit.\n\nFocus on domestic customers. If you operate cross-border, localise in English.\n\nRaise Series A led by European investor.\n\nFocus on European expansion for now, rather than on US and expand into an additional European market.\n\nRaise Series B led by European investor with strong US network.\n\nExpand into further European markets.\n\nResearch the US market, with frequent visits, and preparing a launch plan.\n\nRaise large Series C, led by transatlantic investor.\n\nSend a landing team to launch the US, and support them on product as you’ll need early US localisation to succeed.\n\nRetain your leadership team in Europe. It is likely to include one or two executives relocating from the US.\n\nRaise Series D, led by transatlantic or US investor.\n\nHire US President as traction becomes clear.\n\nRetain all other leadership in Europe, and founders remain in Europe.\n\nRaise Series E.\n\nListing in Europe (maybe in US).\n\nPendulum\n\nDistributed customers, distributed organisation\n\nFor companies whose US market size falls somewhere between 30-50% of TAM, it can be challenging to decide which continent should hold the centre of gravity. You need to balance these demands by embracing distributed leadership, ambiguous prioritisation, and organisational complexity and duplication. It is still possible to achieve exceptional growth in this scenario. But it requires more discipline in strategic decision-making, and in leadership communication.\n\nPendulums are usually companies that have delayed their launch into the US market. This may reflect an attractive opportunity to consolidate a leadership position across Europe (and potentially other geographies too). Alternatively, US market entry may require a level of funding that isn’t available early in the journey (particularly in B2C), or complex product localisation that cannot be tackled earlier. However, delayed US launch can also be the result of poor strategic decision-making, or poor execution.\n\nBy the time that attention turns to the US, the organisation is more mature, with an established leadership structure in Europe. Competitors in the US may have also moved ahead, limiting the landgrab opportunity.\n\nAs traction builds in the US (often following the Anchor archetype in the early days), and the growth potential is proven, the company needs to divide its attention: Retaining focus on its existing and dominant European markets, but needing to prioritise the US opportunity to stand any chance of winning there. Over time, the organisation and leadership spread out. Founders may split their time (ie their lives) between the US and Europe, and functional heads will be hired in either geography. A global mindset is essential, plus a tolerance for extensive travel, and calls at all hours of the day or night.\n\nB2B example: Criteo\n\nB2C example: Spotify\n\nPendulum - Typical journey\n\nRaise Seed funding, and build product from Europe, establishing product/market fit.\n\nFocus on European customers, but establish English as primary language, for product and internally.\n\nRaise Series A from a European investor with strong US network.\n\nFocus on European expansion, launching into 2 additional European markets.\n\nBut research US market, with frequent visits and preparing a launch plan.\n\nRaise large Series B led by transatlantic investor.\n\nSend a landing team to launch the US, supporting them on product as you’ll need early US localisation to succeed.\n\nStrengthen product leadership to free up time for CEO. Likewise for European commercial leadership.\n\nFounder spends extensive time in the US to oversee the ramp-up.\n\nRaise Series C led by US investor.\n\nFounder potentially relocates to the US as traction proven, else splits time.\n\nHire leadership, and build functions, based on where you find the best talent (US or Europe).\n\nRaise Series D.\n\nUS probably single largest market by now.\n\nIf the right CTO/CPO candidates can no longer be found in Europe, relocate execs from US as it’s hard to find candidates in Europe with experience at this scale.\n\nLeadership team now distributed across Europe and US.\n\nRaise Series E.\n\nConsider a US engineering centre.\n\nList where it makes most sense for your business - US or Europe.\n\nTelescope\n\nFocus on US, through a lens located in Europe\n\nThe US might represent the majority of your overall TAM, but you have a GTM model that is self-serve; ie customer acquisition is through marketing and growth. And your product is also purely software, so you don’t need an extensive distribution or fulfilment structure. Without the need to build out a complex sales or operations organisation on-the-ground, the bulk of your leadership and headcount can remain in Europe. The US - and if applicable, Asia - only requires a smaller team, focused on customer support, plus potentially business development. The organisation is like a telescope, able to focus on the US market and customers, through a lens located back in Europe.\n\nThis is the main archetype for B2C startups when distribution is through app stores or digital marketing channels. In B2B, even if software companies start with a self-serve GTM model, few stick with it as they scale. Self-serve can work for selling to small businesses, or to individuals within larger enterprises. But with success and ambition, companies usually move up the value chain, selling larger deals, to larger customers - requiring an increasingly sophisticated sales model. At Index, we have witnessed this evolution first-hand at Zendesk, Dropbox, and Slack. So in practice, the Telescope archetype tends to morph into the Pendulum or Compass in the most successful B2B companies, albeit postponed by a few years.\n\nB2B examples: Typeform, Pipedrive, Gett\n\nB2C examples: King, Supercell, Skype, Lightricks, Waze\n\nTelescope - Typical journey\n\nRaise Seed funding, and build product from Europe, establishing product/market fit.\n\nAcquire customers globally, but localise in particular for US users.\n\nRaise Series A from transatlantic or European investor.\n\nFocus on growth metrics across the whole funnel, optimising in particular for US users.\n\nMake frequent visits to the US to cultivate relationships with strategic distribution partners.\n\nEstablish small business development team (likely in the Bay Area) as you’ll probably have major channel or product partners in the US.\n\nRaise Series B led by transatlantic investor.\n\nHire business development lead in US.\n\nBuild US support team in secondary hub, or remote.\n\nExplore ways of moving up the value chain with higher ACVs and larger organisations, using inside sales (B2B only).\n\nRaise Series C led by US investor.\n\nScale-up inside sales in US secondary hub (B2B only).\n\nLeadership team mostly in Europe, but likely to include several executives relocating from US (eg VP Growth or VP Product).\n\nRaise Series D.\n\nSet up enterprise sales function, if you continue to move up the value chain (B2B only). If this happens, you’re likely to morph into the Compass archetype...\n\nIf the right CTO/CPO candidates can no longer be found in Europe, relocate execs from US as it’s hard to find candidates in Europe with experience at this scale.\n\nRaise Series E.\n\nListing probably in the US.\n\nFor completeness, we can identify two other archetypes. However, these fall outside the scope of this handbook:\n\nTransplant\n\nAs noted earlier, European founders targeting sectors with a large (>50%) US TAM may choose to relocate entirely to the US at an early stage, and build the company wholly from there. Effectively, they are creating a US company from day one. As they scale, these companies often leverage their network and brand to rebuild a European team, with significant, but secondary, engineering and GTM teams.\n\nB2B examples: Zendesk, MySQL, Stripe, Datadog\n\nRegional\n\nFor European companies with zero US TAM, there is of course no need to expand to the US at all. As noted earlier, we predict a lot more European-focused success stories, in B2B as well as B2C, in the years ahead. Particularly in regulated sectors such as financial services, insurance, property, healthcare, and education.\n\nB2B examples: Personio, Alan, KRY, Swile, Payfit\n\nB2C examples: Deliveroo, Just Eat Takeaway, Delivery Hero, Zalando, BlaBlaCar\n\nHow Important is the US Market?\n\nTo determine which of our proposed archetypes offers the best roadmap for your startup, you need to quantify the importance of the US market to your success. What percentage does the US represent of your Total Addressable Market (TAM)?\n\nWe were driven by the view that the US would be the biggest market eventually, so our GTM plans were heavily based around this consideration.\n\nJoshua Jian\n\nHead of Corporate Development, Credit Benchmark\n\nStartups should think of TAM in terms of primary markets - where you need to succeed, in order to achieve category leadership. This usually means:\n\nNorth America\n\nEurope\n\nJapan\n\nAustralia\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSingapore\n\nDoes winning mean winning the US? This is a huge question and I keep asking it. If it does, it requires a huge change in my life and in the organisation.\n\nChristophe Pasquier\n\nCEO & co-founder, Slite\n\nSecondary markets are those where your product is still relevant, but where the opportunity is likely to be smaller, and more fragmented. These usually include:\n\nMiddle East\n\nLatin America\n\nSouth East Asia\n\nSouth Asia\n\nAfrica\n\nYou should not expand into these regions if doing so could reduce your chances of success in core markets. Expansion is usually best delayed until you are close to, or following, listing.\n\nChina and Russia are out-of-bounds for most (but not all) startups, due to embedded domestic competitors, and barriers to doing business (regulation, political risk, or the need for local JV partners).\n\nThere can be exceptions to these general rules. For example, Farfetch (luxury B2C) has been very successful in China, and TransferWise (cross-border B2C payments) is highly relevant to immigrant communities from emerging markets. Even in B2B, core markets can vary, particularly for SMB-focused propositions. For example, iZettle scored major successes in Brazil and Mexico, as did Mimecast in South Africa. You therefore need to adjust which countries are core versus secondary, according to the dynamics of your sector.\n\nRecasting data from IDC’s Global IT Spending 2020 report leads to the following TAM breakdown across core markets:\n\nNorth America 53%\n\nEurope 31%\n\nJapan 11%\n\nAustralia 3%\n\nSouth Korea 2%\n\nFrom this ‘base case’ of roughly 50% US TAM, we expect most European B2B companies will therefore continue to fall into our Compass archetype, particularly in enterprise SaaS.\n\nFigure out where the opportunity is, figure out where the money is, and grow your business there.\n\nJan Hammer\n\nIndex Ventures\n\nWe see more openness to new and innovative technologies from US corporates, relative to those in Europe. Where US corporations see technology as an investment, and as a source of competitive advantage, Europeans are still more likely to view it as a cost.\n\nThis is reflected in much higher US corporate IT budgets. According to Gartner, expenditure on B2B software in North America will be $240bn in 2020, compared to $106bn in Europe. Over the next four years, they forecast growth of 15.4% CAGR in North America, compared to just 8.6% in Europe. And this doesn’t even capture differences between on-prem and cloud software, where we suspect the gap would be even wider.\n\nCorporations headquartered in the US generally recognize two important things earlier than their European counterparts. First is that technology is a source of competitive advantage. Second is that, to be competitive in the war for tech talent, you have to enable your people to access and use the best technology. These two forces have resulted in a swifter adoption of products from early stage companies in the US.\n\nJacob Jofe\n\nIndex Ventures\n\nUS businesses are more likely to increase IT spending in order to upgrade outdated infrastructure (whilst) European ones are more likely to turn on the boosters due to regulations like GDPR.\n\n2020 State of European IT\n\nSpiceworks\n\nEuropean corporates tend to be more risk-averse, avoiding startups and preferring instead to buy legacy solutions from established software providers. Early-adopters are therefore concentrated in the US. We also see shorter average US sales cycles and higher ACVs, even in the metrics of later-stage SaaS businesses.\n\nOnce you have US case studies, you can sell more easily to corporates in Europe.\n\nFelix van de Maele\n\nCEO & co-founder, Collibra\n\nWe’ve just landed a European blue-chip after 3 years. In the US, the same decision would have taken 3 months - they are just more open to innovation.\n\nSacha Herrmann\n\nCFO Nexthink\n\nFor enterprise B2B startups, these factors can make the US an even more important market than the 50% US TAM headline suggests. This is less true for SMB-focused startups, which may therefore align more closely with the Pendulum archetype, rather than the Compass.\n\nOur US users are more savvy, more engaged, and monetise better across all use-cases.\n\nChristophe Pasquier\n\nFounder and CEO, Slite\n\nYou get media and PR attention from top tier outlets once you make inroads in the US market.\n\nRan Peled\n\nFormer VP marketing, Trigo\n\nCorporate conservatism is one of the biggest weaknesses in Europe’s innovation ecosystem, and it needs greater attention from Europe’s corporate CEOs and CIOs.\n\nDominic Jacquesson\n\nIndex Ventures\n\nThe Archetypes in B2B\n\nThe most successful B2B startups sustain exceptional revenue growth year-after-year. However, using public listing as a milestone of having achieved true scale and success, the journey from founding is still a long one. Whilst every company’s route is unique, we have summarised a whirlwind, but credible, 9 year timeline for an ambitious SaaS startup today, in terms of funding, headcount, and ARR (annually recurring revenue).\n\nIn the sections which follow, we will present a case study that illustrates each of our four archetypes for US expansion. In each case, we will explore how headcount and revenue metrics might break out between Europe and the US.\n\nB2B Compass\n\nArchetype Compass\n\nCollibra - A playbook for European enterprise SaaS success\n\nAbout: Collibra helps organisations unlock the value of their data, turning it into a strategic asset.\n\nFounded: Brussels, 2008\n\nFundraising: 2009 €1.2M Seed\n\n2012 €1M Series A\n\n2015 $23M Series B (Index)\n\n2017 $50M Series C\n\n2017 $58M Series D\n\n2019 $100M Series E\n\nFundraising to date: $234m, Series E\n\nUS as % of TAM: >50%\n\nUS % revenue: >50%\n\nHeadcount split: 660. 50% US, 40% Europe, 10% RoW\n\nGTM: Enterprise sales\n\nLeadership location: COO moved to US after Series A, and CEO after Series B. Entirely US now\n\nEngineering location: Entirely Europe. US engineering centre planned for 2020\n\nFounder location: New York\n\nFounder/CEO: Felix Van de Maele\n\nBuilt out of Europe (2008-11)\n\nCollibra was building a new category of enterprise software, which required early-adopter customers. They found five early European test customers, including international banks in London, but the founders always knew that the US was the real prize.\n\nEarly US Traction (2012-14)\n\nCollibra began to sell remotely into the US, sponsoring conferences and sending over team members to attend. They added 10-12 new clients this way, servicing them remotely.\n\nIn 2013, to ramp up US sales, they set up a New York WeWork office, with a team of five. New York was the obvious location, since at the time they were primarily selling into banks.\n\nCo-founders Stijn (COO) and Pieter (Chief Science Officer) relocated, with co-founder Benny (VP sales) also spending 60% of his time there.\n\nThe biggest difference in the US is that enterprises see the value of paying more for software. We saw more US traction once we were present in NY, and were able to close our first $1m deal.\n\nFelix van de Maele\n\nCEO & co-founder\n\nFelix, CEO, stayed in Belgium, overseeing engineering & product. He was too immersed in day-to-day product decisions to be able to also move to NY.\n\nThe first 10 US hires were AE’s - individual contributors, rather than managers. With hindsight, it was clear that these were mis-hires. The company lacked the capital, or brand-name investors, to give it credibility to hire the talent that was really needed. Furthermore, they found it challenging to evaluate US candidates - something that other European founders have also admitted.\n\nEveryone appears to be amazing. We used to ask candidates how they rated themselves on a scale of 0-10. In Europe people would say between 6 and 8. Iin the US they were giving us 11’s and 12’s!\n\nFelix van de Maele\n\nCEO & co-founder\n\nCommitment and Scaling (2015-17)\n\nIn 2015, following an Index-led Series B, Felix moved to NY. He was already in the US 50% of the time, and by this point, he had been able to relinquish his product responsibilities.\n\nPre-Index, we were pretty much bootstrapped. It was only post-Index that we could properly scale, with the mental shift to create a really big company.\n\nFelix van de Maele\n\nCEO & co-founder\n\nEverything is much more expensive in the US - everything. Salaries, housing, office space, travel. So you need decent fundraising first.\n\nFelix van de Maele\n\nCEO & co-founder\n\nKnowing how to hire effectively in the US was a challenge, as was localising HR policies and practices established in Europe. Hiring a Chief People Officer, Jarlath, in 2016 was extremely valuable. Originally European, he could effectively translate cultural expectations.\n\nThe European team used to share hotel rooms at conferences - a practice that was not common for US employees.\n\nJarlath Doherty\n\nChief People Officer\n\nCollibra was scaling beyond a level that any of the European leadership had experienced. To prepare for the next growth phase, Felix hired seasoned US global functional executives, including a CFO, CRO, and CMO. All these hires had an international flavour of some kind - having lived in London, run global teams, or worked at European companies.\n\nInternational outlook or experience is a key criterion for all our exec hires. And these types tend to be attracted to us too.\n\nJarlath Doherty\n\nChief People Officer\n\nIn 2020 Collibra set up a secondary hub in Atlanta, a much lower-cost location than NY, with strong talent pools across SDRs, customer success, plus marketing and finance ops.\n\nThe understanding of SaaS selling, including customer success, is way better in the US. There is still cloud hesitancy in Europe, and more of a licence orientation.\n\nFelix van de Maele\n\nCEO & co-founder\n\nProduct & Engineering Leadership (2018-20)\n\nThe product function was still entirely located in Belgium, close to engineering. Felix communicated and translated market requirements to this team. But with a 500 person organisation to lead, and a majority of US-based customers, this became unworkable. A Chief Product Officer was hired in the US in 2018. There is now a small but experienced team of customer-facing product managers in the US, to complement the engineering-facing team in Belgium.\n\nIt has been important to have product people close to sales, to make sure that what we’re promising is deliverable.\n\nJarlath Doherty\n\nChief People Officer\n\nAll engineering to-date has been located in Europe (Belgium, Poland and the Czech Republic). However, with a team over 200 strong, Collibra had to search in the US for a CTO with the requisite experience, who will soon also be opening a US engineering centre.\n\nBalancing cultures, levelling and communicating\n\nMaking sure that teams across all offices felt valued has been a constant challenge. Poland used to feel secondary to Belgium. Later, with the move of Felix and decision-making to NY, morale in Belgium fell.\n\nThe leadership has learnt the importance of being thoughtful in its efforts to level the playing field. They pay careful attention to the locations of all-hands, board meetings, offsites, etc.\n\nCollibra introduced core manager training that included cultural awareness content to create a common internal language and approach. Four day long global employee summits were held each year, in ‘neutral’ locations - Vancouver, Malta, Lisbon, New Orleans - which promoted bonding and unity.\n\nCollibra’s top tips for European founders looking at US expansion:\n\nMake sure you have PMF (product market fit) before you move\n\nYou can achieve a lot through travel\n\nRaise a big round before you expand\n\nHave investors that understand the US and can help you scale\n\nBe prepared to make mistakes, but fix them quickly\n\nB2B Anchor\n\nArchetype Anchor\n\nSpectacular global success, anchored in Amsterdam\n\nAbout: Adyen is a global payments company that allows merchants to accept e-commerce, mobile, and point-of-sale payments.\n\nFounded: Amsterdam, 2006\n\nFundraising: 2011 €16M Series A (index)\n\n2014 $250M Series B\n\n2015 $50M Venture Round\n\nFundraising up to listing: $316m, Series C\n\nListing: June 2018, Euronext (Amsterdam)\n\nUS as % of TAM: <30% for cross-border payments\n\nUS % revenue: 30%\n\nHeadcount split: 1,200. 75% Europe, 17% US, 8% RoW\n\nGTM: Enterprise and mid-market sales\n\nLeadership location: Entirely in Amsterdam (except for COO)\n\nEngineering location: Entirely in Amsterdam\n\nFounder location: Amsterdam\n\nFounder/CEO: Pieter van der Does\n\nStarting small with a long term vision (2006-10)\n\nAdyen was founded in Amsterdam in 2006, by a founding team with deep experience in the payments sector. They built an end-to-end payment platform, optimised for a wide range of international payment methods. The company went into hypergrowth early on, resonating particularly with e-commerce clients.\n\nAdyen opened a small office in Boston, in 2008, hiring someone from their network to help with the set-up. Although this was very early from a commercial point of view, it was necessary in order to acquire US regulatory licenses.\n\nEuropean companies understand how to operate in a complex environment (legislation, currencies, etc) early on, so expanding to the US is less of a leap.\n\nIngo Uytdehaage,\n\nCFO (since 2011)\n\nCommitment: US Leadership (2011-15)\n\nIn 2011, following their Index-led Series A fundraise, Adyen realised that they needed to be closer to key US tech players on the West Coast. A small SF office was opened at the end of 2012 - a couple of salespeople with payments experience were hired locally, supported by someone from Adyen’s Amsterdam team. Uber was their first big tech account, with Adyen chosen to process all non-US payments.\n\nThey then conducted a search for a heavyweight US president, and in 2014 hired Kamran Zaki, previously global payments lead at both Netflix and PayPal. Kamran’s product and merchant experience made him the perfect fit for the role, and also resonated well with customers and talent. Roelant (employee #15 and CCO) moved to SF for Kamran’s first year, which was critical for helping him to ramp up. After Roelant returned to Amsterdam in 2015, Sam Halse (COO from 2011-19) went to SF in his place. All executives, including Pieter (CEO), made regular visits to the US.\n\nHaving a member of our Management Board based in the US continuously from 2014 [Roelant and then Sam], working alongside Kamran, was critical to ensuring our success there.\n\nIngo Uytdehaage,\n\nCFO (since 2011)\n\nEuropean IPO (2016-18)\n\nAlthough Adyen had originally planned a NY listing, they found that institutional investors (even from the US) were open to an Amsterdam one. They could see other advantages to listing in Europe - a scarcity of opportunities to invest in tech stocks, and inclusion in the main index, which would not have been the case in NY. It also positioned them next door to their banking regulator. All this shifted their decision towards listing in Amsterdam, and they haven’t looked back. With a market capitalisation in excess of $40bn, Adyen has set a new bar for the ambitions of European B2B tech companies.\n\nMore than 50% of the institutional shareholder register is US-based... Adyen proves that if you have a great business, then exchange location doesn’t matter.\n\nJan Hammer\n\nIndex Ventures\n\nGlobal P&L but leadership in Europe\n\nAdyen operates as a unified company, with a single global P&L. The leadership team sits in Amsterdam with the exception of Kamran, who in 2020 stepped-up from US President to become COO.\n\nAs the company has scaled, they have hired and relocated experienced leaders into Amsterdam, from the US and elsewhere. As an international hub where almost everybody speaks English, they haven’t felt disadvantaged in attracting the right calibre of people.\n\nCulture and Collaboration\n\nAdyen prides itself on being a global company, and they never talk about Amsterdam as an HQ. They encourage all employees to travel and move between offices, with an extremely empowering travel policy. T&E is their second biggest cost item, after salaries.\n\nRoles and responsibilities are more fluid than is typical in the US. Working across timezones can create tension and misunderstandings, so Adyen has a core principle of “don’t hide behind email.” They continuously communicate why picking up the phone is so important, which is particularly important for avoiding language miscommunications. Investing in communication tools like Zoom has also made a big difference.\n\nAdyen’s top tips for European founders looking at US expansion:\n\nStart early if you have regulatory barriers to overcome.\n\nLocate yourself close to your key customers.\n\nHire local leadership, but make sure they are aligned with your long-term vision.\n\nDon’t assume that a US listing is the only, or even the best, way to go.\n\nB2B Pendulum\n\nPendulum Archetype: Illustrative journey from Founding to Listing\n\nArchetype Pendulum\n\nGlobal leadership for a global company\n\nAbout: Criteo is the global leader in digital performance display advertising, partnering with over 3,000 international advertisers to deliver highly-targeted campaigns.\n\nFounded: Paris, 2006\n\nFundraising: 2007 €3M Series A\n\n2008 $10M Series B (Index)\n\n2010 $7M Series C\n\n2012 $40M Series D\n\nFundraising up to listing: $61m, Series D\n\nListing: September 2013, NASDAQ\n\nUS as % of TAM: 50%\n\nUS % revenue: 30-50%\n\nHeadcount split: 3,100. 62% Europe, 25% US, 13% RoW\n\nGTM: Enterprise and mid-market sales, plus publisher partnerships on supply-side\n\nLeadership location: Distributed across Europe and US, plus EVP Americas\n\nEngineering location: Majority Paris, but also elsewhere in Europe and the US\n\nFounder location Moved to Palo Alto, then to London\n\nFounder/CEO Jean-Baptiste (JB) Rudelle, until 2019, now Chairman\n\nPMF and Growth in Europe (2006-09)\n\nThe early years were a struggle, hunting for product/market fit. In 2008, Criteo found its business model, and raised a Series B led by Index. In 2009, revenue grew to €16m and headcount to 70, with mostly French customers, plus a few inroads into the UK and Germany.\n\nAt this point, we faced a decision; should we stay concentrated in Europe, or conquer the world - ie the US?\n\nJB Rudelle\n\nChairman & founder (former CEO)\n\nUltimately, a decision in favour of US expansion was made, because there was a landgrab opportunity, with no embedded US competitor yet.\n\nUS clients favour local players enormously. As an outsider, you need a vastly better product to compete.\n\nJB Rudelle\n\nChairman & founder (former CEO)\n\nCommitment and teething pains (2009-10)\n\nJB’s research found that European success in the US always involved the founder moving. His co-founders were both technical, so it made most sense for him to relocate, whilst they led the R&D team in Paris. By now, Criteo had strong sales and business development leaders in Europe, so JB felt he was leaving it in safe hands.\n\nThe US office was designed to be a commercial subsidiary, with JB’s role to seed the market. But the first 18 months proved extremely difficult.\n\nManaging the US as a European is a complete shock. It took several years for me to understand how they work. You feel so European when you’re out there!\n\nJB Rudelle\n\nChairman & founder (former CEO)\n\nCriteo had only been able to sign US subsidiaries of their European clients. Closing Zappos proved to be a pivotal moment in changing perceptions.\n\nJB pushed back against the US sales team who were arguing the need for major US product localisation. Being on the ground meant he had the local insight to know that this wasn’t as high a priority as they thought it was, which was critical for staying focused.\n\nUS Location and Leadership (2011-14)\n\nThe biggest early mistake in the US had been starting on the West Coast rather than the East Coast. This decision had been made for family, rather than for business reasons, and it created extra friction in terms of timezone and travel. Criteo’s US clients ended up being distributed across the US, so there was no advantage to being in Silicon Valley.\n\nI would advise European entrepreneurs against setting up in SV. It is very shiny, but it is much harder.\n\nJB Rudelle\n\nChairman & founder (former CEO)\n\nI thought one advantage to being on the West Coast was that I could pilot APAC - but in reality, you’re no closer to Asia than you would be in Europe.\n\nJB Rudelle\n\nChairman & founder (former CEO)\n\nThe team started to build across four hubs - Paris, London, Palo Alto, and New York. This was great for tapping into a broad talent pool, but it put a high burden on management time and personal lives.\n\nDespite incredible growth, Criteo were still struggling to hire senior talent in the US, and supplemented with a landing team from Europe.\n\nAfter closing 2010 with €70m in revenue, Criteo was able to make a transformative hire: Greg Coleman, who joined as US President, from the Huffington Post. He stayed until 2014 and rebuilt the US team, shifting the centre of gravity from Palo Alto to New York.\n\nGreg had a media pedigree that could attract the best people.\n\nDom Vidal\n\nIndex Ventures\n\nThe distributed leadership model at Criteo persisted (in fact, through to today). JB was managing six direct reports in four locations. Functional teams (except for engineering) were also distributed. It required extreme trust, because you can’t micro-manage across continents. But despite the challenges, JB feels it could not have been any other way.\n\nIf the whole management team had been in Paris, I don’t think we would have been able to hire Greg, and there were certain skill-sets that just didn’t exist in Europe. But having the leadership entirely in NY wouldn’t have worked either - as a European company, the people you are able to hire in the US are lower quality than those you can access in Europe.\n\nJB Rudelle\n\nChairman & founder (former CEO)\n\nThe key to making the distributed model work was having a very clear vision of what needed to be achieved, and being crystal-clear on KPIs. In 2011, Criteo closed on €140m revenues, growing to €270m in 2012.\n\nThis pace of scaling with a distributed team was only possible because we were focused on 1 product, which had already achieved great product market fit. At an earlier stage, you need lots of iteration, and later on, you need to diversify.\n\nJB Rudelle\n\nChairman & founder (former CEO)\n\nThe US is now the largest region for Criteo, but revenues are globally spread, including significant contribution from JAPAC.\n\nIPO (2012)\n\nIn 2012, Criteo went public on Nasdaq. The primary reason for choosing the US was to be seen as a local player. It opened doors in the US that had been closed before.\n\nStrangely, it was much harder for us to get a CEO meeting in the US than in Japan.

From the outset, and through to their US expansion, the US has been their largest market, although less than 50% of revenues or users. In the run up to raising a Series B, the company started forming their expansion plan.\n\nThey explored the pros and cons of being in San Francisco, New York, Denver, Austin, Atlanta, and Phoenix. They decided on San Francisco for access to potential partners, and the start-up ecosystem. Typeform sent over a few European employees as a landing team, including their customer success lead. However, there wasn’t a clear objective behind the expansion - supporting US customers, trialling inside sales, or partnering? This became clearer as they made a number of US hires. Typeform regrouped, and has now hired a small team of experienced specialists in the SF office, focusing on product & reseller partnerships, and on developer advocacy around their API offering.\n\nIt’s very important to have a general manager who possesses the skills you actually require. You can support culture by sending people from your HQ to the US. But do not optimise for culture first, unless you are creating an office with 50+ people.\n\nRobert Muñoz\n\nCo-founder\n\nAlmost all our important partners or potential partners are in the US (eg Mailchimp, WordPress), and many of them are in the Bay Area - Slack, Intercom, Hubspot, Salesforce, etc. Being here gives us credibility and a chance to form deeper, personal relationships with the key people.\n\nFrancois Grenier\n\nHead of Tech Partnerships\n\nRenewed US strategy\n\nThis new strategy made very clear what the team needed in a US leader, and it was a profile that they neither had in the Barcelona team, nor one that was accessible there.\n\nWe have reshaped our strategy to focus on partnerships. We started too wide with the US, trying to build a critical mass there, without realising why we were doing it.\n\nRobert Muñoz\n\nCo-founder\n\nThey had the benefit of a very well-known and respected brand, which helped them to hire a seasoned partnerships lead in San Francisco, with previous experience at Hubspot.\n\nHiring our Global Head of Business Development in the US is proving to be critical. Now, with bigger goals and clearer plans, we are strongly considering having a more full stacked team in the US.\n\nJoaquim Lechà\n\nCEO\n\nGetting meetings with decision-takers in companies we would like to partner with has been easier than we expected.\n\nJoaquim Lechà\n\nCEO\n\nTheir US team is about 20 strong, and growing. The SF team is focused on partnerships, resellers, developer advocacy, and product marketing. These are all areas where being in SF is necessary to access the ecosystem, and talent with relevant experience. They have also hired a few engineers, who focus on technical integrations with partners. Customer support also has a number of people in the US, although these are remote, rather than being centralised, or in SF.\n\nHaving support coverage in the US has been critical for our success and reputation here.\n\nNicolas Grenié\n\nDeveloper Advocate\n\nTypeform’s growth since day one has been powered by growth mechanics and bottom-up adoption, including a high degree of product virality. As the company has matured, it has broadened its product offering. They are now experimenting with selling company-wide licences, and have hired an inside sales leader in SF to lead this effort.\n\nLeadership in Barcelona\n\nThe rest of Typeform’s leadership remains in Barcelona. They have been able to relocate experienced talent from elsewhere in Europe and the US, supported by their brand, design ethos, and the attractiveness of Barcelona as a place to live and work.\n\nIn Barcelona we do not have that many SaaS experienced professionals who have ‘been there and done that’. Therefore it is necessary to relocate them so that we can learn and scale our business faster.\n\nJoaquim Lechà\n\nCEO\n\nB2B Transplant\n\nAlthough the Transplant archetype is outside of the scope of this book, it is instructive to explore why founders have chosen it.\n\nArchetype Transplant B2B\n\nEuropean founders who relocated early, and built a global leader in San Francisco\n\nAbout: Zendesk is a customer service software company.\n\nFounded: Copenhagen, 2007\n\nFundraising: 2008 500k Seed Round\n\n2009 $6M Series A&B\n\n2010 $19M Series C (Index)\n\n2012 $60M Series D\n\nFundraising up to listing: $86M, Series D\n\nListing: May 2014, NYSE\n\nUS as % of TAM: >50%\n\nUS % revenue: >50%\n\nHeadcount split: 4000. 50% US, 24% Europe, 26% RoW\n\nGTM: Mix of enterprise and inside sales, plus self-serve\n\nLeadership location: All US based\n\nEngineering location: Initially all in the US, but now multiple engineering sites (Dublin, Copenhagen, Krakow, Singapore, and Melbourne)\n\nFounder location: San Francisco\n\nFounder/CEO: Mikkel Svane\n\nExpansion to access funding, customers and talent\n\nWhen Zendesk was founded in a Copenhagen loft in 2007, the startup climate in Europe was very different to today. There was very little infrastructure, and no strong B2B role models. They acquired a small but highly engaged customer base through a self-serve model, which was growing fast. They had no permanent employees at this point.\n\nNo Danish lawyer had even seen a venture term sheet back then!\n\nMikkel Svane\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nThe three co-founders Mikkel, Morten (CTO), and Alexander (CPO), tried to raise funding in Europe but were unsuccessful.\n\nIndex was the only proper VC in Europe, and you turned us down at Series A!\n\nMikkel Svane\n\nCEO & Founder\n\n(Yes, we make mistakes, and we try to draw lessons from every one of them)\n\nThe US investors they spoke to made it a condition that they move to the US. All three co-founders relocated to Boston, raising a Series A from Charles River Ventures. After they flipped the company to a Delaware topco, Benchmark pre-empted a Series B.\n\nAfter this fundraise, they moved to San Francisco, to be a part of the local ecosystem, and to access start-up talent.\n\nSilicon Valley has far higher talent quality and density than anywhere else on the planet. Even people who are mediocre here would be considered stars in Europe, across all roles.\n\nMikkel Svane\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nTaking advantage of European roots\n\nZendesk capitalised on being a European-born company, celebrating their Danish heritage as part of their brand.\n\nWe are not a US company - we have broad international DNA because of our roots. Half of our revenue is outside the US, and the same with our employees.\n\nMikkel Svane\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nZendesk was also steadily moving towards larger deals, building teams initially for inside sales, and then enterprise sales. Self-serve acquisition was a smaller proportion of the overall business. Pre-Series D, with a global team of 60 and 2,500 EMEA customers, they hired a VP EMEA based in London, to drive sales expansion.\n\nAs their team grew, and the SF engineering talent market got tighter, they opened a Copenhagen engineering centre in 2011, and another in Dublin in 2012.\n\nZendesk now has almost 1,000 employees across Europe, a quarter of their global workforce.\n\nThe Archetypes in B2C\n\nTech journalists in Europe love to ask “Why don’t we have any tech giants at the scale of Google, Amazon or Alibaba?” Europe is fragmented by language and regulations, and these twin challenges aren’t going to disappear any time soon. They slow down blitzscaling relative to B2C startups in the US or China. Some specific friction points they generate are:\n\nLocalisation\n\nBrand-building\n\nWord of mouth marketing\n\nNetwork effects\n\nPhysical distribution\n\nThese same issues conversely create a ‘moat’ against US entrants, and there have been multiple pan-European B2C winners. For example, Just Eat Takeaway, Delivery Hero, Zalando, and Deliveroo. But scale is inevitably limited if you are not operating in the world’s two biggest global markets.\n\nIt would have been hard to convince brands, customers and investors that we were a global marketplace if we didn’t have the US.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO, Farfetch\n\nHowever, there are many B2C sectors where Europe has inherent advantages, and in these we have seen the emergence of global tech category leaders:\n\nMusic\n\nSweden offered labels a low-risk laboratory for adapting to streaming (Spotify).\n\nGambling\n\nUS laws were restrictive for domestic startups (Betfair, Fanduel, Bet365).\n\nLuxury\n\nEurope globally dominant for both supply and talent (Farfetch).\n\nTravel\n\nA huge category in Europe, particularly cross-border (Booking.com, Skyscanner).\n\nGaming\n\nLanguage much less of an issue, and global distribution through app platforms (King, Supercell, Rovio).\n\nMoney transfer\n\nHigh cross-border charges in Europe made it ripe for disruption (TransferWise, Revolut, WorldRemit).\n\nTelecoms\n\nExpensive international calling across Europe offered consumers huge cost savings (Skype).\n\nRide sharing\n\nUS cultural anxiety about riding with a stranger, relative to Europe (BlaBlaCar).\n\nEuropean B2C founders with global ambitions would be wise to identify and target categories where they can leverage their European home base, versus being held back by it.\n\nHistorically, European startups have sold up before they could reach massive scale. Otherwise they have ended up listing in the US. But ambition is increasing year upon year. If built in Europe today, we can be confident that Booking.com would not be sold for $135m (Priceline 2005), or Skype for $2.6bn (eBay 2005).\n\nAnother feature of many globally successful European B2C startups is to scale ‘via London’. In effect, these companies have followed a modified ‘Compass’ archetype, establishing GTM and leadership in the UK rather than the US, but with R&D teams based elsewhere in Europe. In many cases, one or more of the founders was based in London from day one (Farfetch, King, Revolut, TransferWise). In others, the centre of gravity shifted over time (Skype, Spotify, Just Eat). This partially reflects the access to customers, talent, and investors that London offers, relative to elsewhere in Europe - although these advantages are narrowing over time, as other major tech hubs emerge across the Continent. But beyond that, the UK offers an attractive test-case ahead of US expansion - English-speaking; closely aligned to the US in terms of culture, and legal framework; physically accessible; but lower-risk in terms of capital requirements for launch.\n\nThe UK can be a great on-ramp to test product propositions and branding, before you take on the US.\n\nDanny Rimer\n\nIndex Ventures\n\nMarketing talent in London is used to running international campaigns.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO, Farfetch\n\nDigital pure-plays, where acquisition and fulfilment don’t require boots on the ground, usually follow the Telescope model, only building a small US team. Businesses which involve physical distribution, such as e-commerce, or with regulatory hurdles, tend to be Anchors; they need to mirror their operating models within the US, with a strong local leader and a multi-functional team. These types of companies are also capital-intensive, so they tend to expand to the US at a later stage of maturity, when they have proven unit economics. If they scale beyond 30% US revenues, pressure develops to evolve from the Anchor archetype to the Pendulum, with leadership distributed across Europe and the US.\n\nAs predicted by these archetype journeys, no founders of B2C outliers from Europe have fully relocated to the US - it’s just not an essential requirement for success. Conversely, there are no examples - at least not yet - of successful B2C Compasses, which do require a founder move.\n\nGiven the different balance of B2C versus B2B companies falling into the different expansion archetypes, we will present B2C case studies in a different order:\n\nTelescope - King\n\nAnchor - Farfetch\n\nPendulum - Spotify\n\nArchetype Telescope\n\nBuilt in Europe, closely connected to strategic partners on the West Coast\n\nAbout: King is an interactive entertainment company creating mobile games including the Candy Crush franchise.\n\nFounded: Stockholm and London, 2003\n\nFundraising to listing: $9M\n\nListing: March 2014 on NYSE, then acquired by Activision Blizzard in November 2015 for $5.9bn\n\nUS as % of TAM: >50% (for revenue not users)\n\nUS % revenue: >50%\n\nHeadcount split: 2660. 12% US, 80% Europe, 8% RoW\n\nGTM: Mobile app platforms\n\nLeadership location: Europe (London and Stockholm)\n\nEngineering location: Multiple engineering centres in Europe\n\nFounder location: London through to present\n\nFounder/CEO: Riccardo Zacconi until 2019\n\nBuilding out of Europe\n\nKing was founded in 2003, with product and tech in Sweden, and commercial and marketing based in London. King’s early years were as an online casual gaming portal. They started marketing web based games through distribution partnerships. These would see games embedded with a co-brand in the online properties of their partners. The first partners were in Germany, and in 2005 they signed an exclusive deal for Europe and the US with Yahoo, the largest portal at the time. To manage these distribution partnerships, they first opened an office in Germany, and then in the US. This was in Los Angeles, initially led by a British expat who already knew the King team. By 2006, Yahoo US was their largest distribution partner, and King became their largest partner in games.\n\nIn 2009 the business was disrupted by the exponential growth of Facebook; Yahoo games lost 40% of their users in one year. They had to go all-in on cracking Facebook. They put half the development team on reinventing how to bring games to market on the Facebook platform. The other half maintained the existing business and revenues to sustain the company. Reinvention also meant bringing in highly-experienced marketing talent in London in 2010 and in 2011, and closing down the marketing-focused office in Germany.\n\nAfter two and a half years of experimentation they finally landed their first successful game on Facebook in April 2011, Bubble Saga. With a second Facebook game, Bubble Witch Saga, they learned more about how to monetise and market on Facebook. The game climbed up the rankings to become the largest Facebook game in terms of players within a year. In 2012 they launched Candy Crush Saga, first on Facebook web and later in the year on mobile. As Candy Crush Saga started growing exponentially, they fuelled the growth by massively ramping the marketing, up to $100m investment per quarter. Candy Crush Saga became the world’s top grossing mobile game. From the outset, the US accounted for a majority of revenues and they focused a large part of the marketing budget on the US, including working with US ad agencies for TV commercials.\n\nStephane was introduced to Riccardo in 2010 by investors, Apax, as a seasoned operator who they knew and respected. He joined just ahead of the release of Bubble Saga.\n\nKing tried to keep efficiency high by centralising engineering in Sweden. But as they outgrew the Stockholm talent pool, they opened engineering centres in London and Barcelona in 2013-14. They opened additional gaming studios in Malmo (2011), plus London, Barcelona, and Bucharest (2013-14), and acquired studios in Seattle and Singapore.\n\nGaming is one of the hardest industries to crack, because it requires a blend of creative, quantitative, and engineering. To get these three constituencies aligned and working for the business is challenging.\n\nStephane Kurgan\n\nVenture Partner at Index Ventures, and former COO of King (2011-18)\n\nUS strategy\n\nKing’s primary goal for US expansion in 2013 onwards was to become the most influential content partner to their key distribution platforms - Apple, Google, and Facebook. Rather than Los Angeles, they now needed a small but senior team in the Bay Area, who had close relationships with the tech platforms. In 2014, King was able to hire two platform partnership leads, including the highly respected former Head of Platform relations from Zynga, who built out the remainder of the partnership team.\n\nThe only reason for gaming businesses to have local offices is for distribution partnerships - and this doesn’t need large teams. This basically means the US and China.\n\nStephane Kurgan\n\nVenture Partner at Index Ventures, and former COO of King (2011-18)\n\nStarting in 2013, the CEO and COO would travel to the US for quarterly platform meetings. It took a while to establish this rhythm, but it enabled them to forge close relationships. The discussions allowed a valuable sharing of thinking about platform product roadmaps, based on a raft of data collated by King’s partnership team.\n\nThey really appreciated our data, even though we stripped the numbers themselves from our charts. They were interested to learn from us.\n\nStephane Kurgan\n\nVenture Partner at Index Ventures, and former COO of King (2011-18)\n\nThe rest of the business team remained mostly in London, and this worked well. The greater challenge was scaling and managing the technology and studio teams across multiple locations.\n\nThe US team increased, including some studio and technical staff, but in total it still remains below 10% of global headcount.\n\nThe London advantage\n\nKing found it very effective to build out of London, particularly due to the availability of world-class talent in performance marketing, media and advertising. Collaboration between the marketing and product teams was essential when it came to the mechanics of player reactivation and viral growth. This reinforced the decision to keep marketing centralised in Europe, rather than hiring locally in the US.\n\nMost of King’s leadership team was hired from within Europe. The European gaming sector has a strong talent pool, which made this possible. However, as they prepared for an IPO in New York, they found an experienced CFO in the US, who relocated to London.\n\nArchetype Anchor\n\nFarfetch is the leading global platform for the luxury fashion industry\n\nAbout: Farfetch is the world’s biggest online marketplace for independent fashion boutiques.\n\nFounded: Porto and London, 2007\n\nFundraising: 2010 $4.5M Series A\n\n2012 $18M Series B (Index)\n\n2013 $20M Series C\n\n2014 $66M Series D\n\n2015 $86M Series E\n\n2016 $110M Series F\n\n2017 $397M Corporate round\n\nFundraising to listing: $952M\n\nListing: September 2018, NYSE\n\nUS as % of TAM: c.30%\n\nUS % revenue: US largest market, but % undisclosed\n\nHeadcount split: c.4,500. 5% US, 90% Europe, 5% RoW (estimates via LinkedIn, unverified)\n\nGTM: Primarily online marketplace\n\nLeadership location: London & Porto, plus regional leads including US President\n\nEngineering location: Majority in Porto, but also London and Sao Paolo\n\nFounder location: London through to present\n\nFounder/CEO: José Neves\n\nStarted in London and Porto\n\nThe company was founded by José in London (where he was living), and Porto (where he was from). Europe dominates in luxury fashion, and José had a rich network from his previous shoe-focused startup. Launching in 2008 during an economic downturn helped, because retailers were under pressure, and were drawn to Farfetch as a route to increase sales.\n\nFarfetch began life with supply from boutiques in five countries, but with customers from across the globe.\n\nWe always saw Farfetch as a global marketplace. And the US is ¼ to ⅓ of the global luxury goods sector, so we anticipated it being our largest market.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO\n\nPre-Series A, and with minimal localisation, the US was already the top market. The key was offering curated access to exclusive stock - with good pricing, and ‘good-enough’ logistics. This proved to be enough of a draw for customers, despite hassles with duties and import taxes.\n\nThe key is whether you have a strong enough proposition to win.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO\n\nCustomer acquisition was a mix of affiliates and performance marketing. For branded goods, there was an SEM/SEO focus, and for non-branded, it was more about building the Farfetch brand and social media strategy. London was an excellent base for digital marketing expertise.\n\nEntering the US via a joint venture\n\nHaving a physical US presence was deemed strategically critical by José, to avoid US-based copycats from locking them out, and also to secure US boutiques on the supply side.\n\nOne of our values is ‘Think Global’. We needed it in our DNA to succeed. This pushed us to go deeper as we scaled.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO\n\nOnce established, the supply-side is fairly defensible - big luxury brands want to be be seen together with their peers.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO\n\nThe initial US scaling was done through a joint venture. In 2009 (pre Series A), Farfetch signed a 50/50 JV with Revolve, a $1bn GMV bootstrapped fashion e-commerce business in LA. José found himself seated next to Michael, one of the co-founders of Revolve, at a dinner, and they clicked. José invited him to the Farfetch launch, after which they wrote out terms for a US JV on a napkin. José flew out to LA the following week to sign the deal. Revolve provided logistics and equity funding, and Farfetch provided the supply, brand, and tech. José and Michael jointly banged on the doors of top US boutiques to sign them up.\n\nThe hardest thing about the US is finding a good leader - the JV solved that for us.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO\n\nManagement of the JV was purely driven by José and Andrew - which involved lots of travel, but minimised disruption for the rest of the Farfetch team. Revolve sold their stake steadily as Farfetch scaled (Series B-D), making the JV a win-win.\n\nLA was chosen simply because it was Revolve’s base.\n\nLA’s not a recognised fashion hub but it does have cost-advantages.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO\n\nScaling the Team in Europe\n\nFashion talent can be largely found in Europe. But as they uplevelled their leadership, Farfetch always ran global searches including the US. The CPO and CMO both relocated from the US.\n\nFarfetch kept almost all development in Portugal. They ramped up recruiting efforts from domestic universities, supplemented in particular by relocating engineers from Brazil. The product team was mostly in London, together with data science.\n\nUS Scaling\n\nFor the US, the team began to build local leadership, first in Customer Service, and then in Private Clients, in 2014.\n\nIt took a certain type of person to fit with our model - someone ok with late-night calls and global travel.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO\n\nOriginally they had looked for an e-commerce expert to lead the US, but then pivoted to fashion sector expertise, realising that the marketing levers were largely in London.\n\nWe revised the hiring spec to match what the US MD had most control over in our case supply.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO\n\nIn 2016, they hired Jeffery as President USA. He had known Andrew from business school, and had a very international outlook. He was based in New York, and Farfetch used this opportunity to further build their NY presence. His role is to oversee US supply, customer operations, and private client business. So overall 25% of US revenues, and 10% of global supply. This is tough given the matrix structure, as not all levers of control fall under one person. It requires flexibility, trust, and a broader set of metrics than simply US GMV.\n\nNYSE IPO\n\nNY was the obvious choice for Farfetch’s IPO. Research showed that UK retail analysts weren’t as familiar with the marketplace model. Plus the US was more open to growth versus profit, with better liquidity and lower free float requirements.\n\nThe cornerstone US institutional investors are all active in Europe, so you can access them. But for the long-tail, which supports liquidity, you need to be in the US.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO\n\nThere are administrative burdens around compliance and quarterly reporting, but these are outweighed by the advantages. The CFO sits in London with the leadership team - but with a small reporting & IR team in the US.\n\nUS travel for investor relations is tough, but we’re in a rhythm now, we just had to develop the muscle.\n\nAndrew Robb\n\nFormer COO\n\nFarfetch’s Top tips for US expansion\n\nBe really clear on why you’ve got an edge / strategic advantage - in the US or elsewhere\n\nExpect to make mistakes with your leadership hires. So hire and fire early and quickly - you don’t have many cycles to get it right\n\nDon’t go overboard on early localisation - just do what is absolutely required, and get going\n\nYou can run digital marketing globally from London - no local US presence is required\n\nIt’s not that hard to set up US operations - you just have to pay the right advisors\n\nArchetype Pendulum\n\nFounded in Sweden, winning in the US and worldwide\n\nAbout: Spotify is the world’s most popular audio streaming subscription service.\n\nFounded: Stockholm, 2006\n\nFundraising to listing: $1.1bn\n\nListing: April 2018, NYSE\n\nUS as % of TAM: 50% (Index estimate)\n\nUS % revenue: 38% US\n\nHeadcount split: 4405. 32% Sweden, 48% US, 20% RoW\n\nGTM: Mobile app platform\n\nLeadership location: New York & Stockholm\n\nEngineering location: Europe & US (multiple engineering centres)\n\nFounder location: Splits time between US and Sweden\n\nFounder/CEO: Daniel Ek\n\nEarly ambitions thwarted for US launch\n\nFrom day one, I was trying to license in the US, but we just couldn’t afford the labels’ fees.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder\n\nRight at the start, Daniel travelled to the US to negotiate with the labels, but he couldn’t afford the financial guarantees they demanded for a global licensing deal. However, the music labels were facing the threat of P2P file-sharing, and were willing to test out a new strategy for survival. The tech-savvy consumer markets of Sweden and the Nordics were ideal. But even to cover this limited market, Spotify had to provide guarantees that were more than they could afford.\n\nThe only reason we are alive today is because we started in a market no-one cared about. In the beginning, we were lucky, rather than it being part of a master strategy.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder\n\nIn the early days, you need to build good product/market fit - and that needs a limited market. In our case, this was a geographic limit. For lots of industries, going global on day one is too capital intensive - you can’t address all use-cases. This isn’t often talked about.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder\n\nNext, Spotify was able to extend into the UK, France and Spain. It was only four years later that they tackled the US.\n\nEverybody else thought that being global from day one was the only way to launch an internet business.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder\n\nVia London\n\nLondon was chosen as the commercial hub - for relationships with record labels (second HQ’s after NY), advertising agencies, and brands, as well as having Europe’s deepest pool of commercial and marketing talent. Stockholm remained the R&D hub.\n\nThere’s a benefit to growing in concentric circles. If we hadn’t expanded via London, and had come straight to the US, we’d be dead now.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder\n\nGoing to the US\n\nSpotify made its first US hire in 2010. At this stage, they had proven the streaming model, and labels could see the value of their proposition.\n\nIn 2011, they were able to raise $100m, led by Goldman Sachs, making them one of only ten tech unicorns at the time. This was the capital they needed to get the major labels onboard, and launch effectively in the US.\n\nSpotify needed to uplevel the team with local US hires, and selected New York for its hub - for similar reasons to London previously.\n\nIn 2012, they launched with a novel distribution mechanic – a Facebook partnership.\n\nStack up everything you need to give you an advantage in distribution (talent, partnerships, etc) - especially when going after a market as large as the US.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder\n\nBuilding the US team\n\nSpotify had been investing in influencers, getting to know talent, and hiring people as consultants for the previous few years, so they were confident about building the team.\n\nDaniel spent a lot of time in the US, and made the first five hires personally. Two big hires were the Chief Content Officer and the US MD. Daniel was introduced to a lawyer from EMI, who he managed to recruit.\n\nOriginally, he didn’t want a full time role, but then said this is way too much fun to pass up.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder\n\nWhen the US office was 12 people, a 7 person landing team moved over, from Sweden and the UK. These were top commercial performers, who wanted to spread their wings. Two came over as Head of Sales and Head of Marketing, to run the functions for 6-12 months, with the goal to hire successors thereafter.\n\nUnderstanding the different dynamics across the US was a huge breakthrough. Originally, the team assumed no one in the US would be sharing mobile devices. However, after a fortunate accident, when they enabled multiple accounts on mobile, this ended up becoming a huge growth driver for them, across the midwest in particular.\n\nThe US is a continent, not a country. We found that the Midwest had levels of 3G connectivity comparable to Eastern Europe. You haven’t visited the real US if you’ve only been to the coasts.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder\n\nFounder travel and distributed leadership\n\nDaniel travels extensively, ensuring that no locations feel like satellite offices. He spends 10 days a month in the US, between NY and Silicon Valley. The rest of his time is spent in Europe, mostly in Stockholm.\n\nIt’s a multiverse life, and kind of weird. But I believe success for Spotify comes down to my spending time in the US.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder\n\nDaniel believes that the viral distribution days of B2C are over now, and that above-the-line marketing is essential. This requires deeper time spent in the US, to understand media and consumer behaviour.\n\nAs of 2020, Daniel has half his direct reports in the US, and half in Sweden. It has been a long journey but Spotify has gotten to a cadence that works. There is a monthly management meeting in Sweden, and a bimonthly one in the US. Functional teams are now also split between continents, so that it doesn’t matter where the leader is.\n\nIt’s been very painful to get here, to be honest. Multiple years.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder\n\nThe organisation relies on decentralised decision making - hiring the best people, and giving them autonomy and accountability, to make the right judgement calls.\n\nEverything comes down to people! The right person in the Sahara will figure out how to sell umbrellas there.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder\n\nThis strategy has paid off, as Spotify has been successfully navigating changing trends, from desktop to mobile, as well as the world’s most formidable line-up of competitors.\n\nWhen to Expand\n\nEven if you have global ambitions, and the US represents a large percentage of your addressable market, you still need to decide when is the right time to build your US presence.\n\nOur research into European expansions to the US revealed that 59% of startups between 2008-14 expanded to the US pre-Series A. This dropped to just 33% for the cohort from 2015-19. So most European founders are now holding back expansion until after Series A.\n\nChoosing your moment\n\nThis will be one of the toughest choices in the life of your company. If you expand too soon, you risk spreading yourself too thin - failing in the US, and losing leadership in Europe. Expand too late, however, and you could have handed US market leadership to a competitor, who is later able to challenge you back in Europe too.\n\nRisk is more about going too late versus going too early. The longer you stay in France (or wherever), the more French speakers you hire, the more French is incorporated in your product…you get calcified.\n\nMartin Mignot\n\nIndex Ventures\n\nRemembering which archetype you are can help you to determine the right timeline for US expansion, including your first boots on the ground.\n\nTypical timing for US expansion, for each archetype\n\nFunding Round Series A Series B Series C+ Archetype Compass Telescope Pendulum\n\nAnchor\n\nCompass\n\nThe case for going to the US early is compelling. Following Series A, if not before. Don’t get distracted with a pan-European rollout. Although, if you are not in a major European hub, or if you sell into banks or brands, it may still be worth considering expanding ‘via London’ - for example, to prove your enterprise GTM model closer to home.\n\nWe used a decision matrix, aiming to be closer to capital, to access a bigger talent pool, to be closer to other key people, to where the PR is, and looking at timezones. We first decided on London, but when we removed the timezone constraint, the decision snapped to San Francisco.\n\nDavid Helgason\n\nFormer CEO & co-founder, Unity Technologies\n\nYou need balance between going to the US too early without enough proof points and going when you have built out too many geos and have too much surface area to manage launching another massive new territory and being spread too thin.\n\nNeil Rimer\n\nIndex Ventures\n\nTelescope\n\nIt is still important to push hard and early for US users and customers. But this is a question of where you focus your product, growth and optimisation efforts. The US percentage in your overall user population should be at least equal to the US percentage in your TAM. And if you operate a freemium model, concentrate on US monetisation, which should be higher than elsewhere. It’s important that you spend a lot of time in the US, learning about user needs, and building partnerships, but you probably won’t need a permanent team on the ground until post Series B.\n\nAnchor & Pendulum\n\nBe more cautious. You don’t want to risk losing leadership in your domestic market, and you may need to decide, for example, between launching in the US, or rolling-out to other major European markets. Even after raising a Series B, giving you deeper pockets, you may still need to choose between pushing for pan-European dominance, or winning a foothold in the US.\n\nHowever, you should be thoughtful in building a product and an organisation that is primed for US-launch. For example, ensuring that your GTM team (particularly senior hires) includes individuals with significant prior US experience. You will also need to closely monitor competitor activity in the US. Carefully qualify the US opportunity, and prepare a launch plan.\n\nIf you are founded in a smaller and non English speaking hub in Europe, it can make sense to build more international coverage before going to the US. This would allow you to get proof of the business, and raise further financing, ahead of the US expansion.\n\nTackle the big European markets first, before the US (UK, Fr, Ger). Something tells me that this will enable you to see nuances and learnings, and be able to raise the capital required, to go after the US. You will see 10x the competition in the States, and you have to be ready for that.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder, Spotify\n\nWinning a second European market proves that your product is flexible enough to adapt.\n\nSofia Dolfe\n\nIndex Ventures\n\nUK-specific advice\n\nIf you are founded in the UK, the argument for going directly, and earlier, to the US is more compelling than it is for elsewhere. Launching elsewhere in Europe will require translation and localisation beyond what is required for the US.\n\nIt’s really hard to have too many geographies early on. Sticking to a US / UK strategy makes sense.\n\nSamir Desai\n\nCEO & co-founder, Funding Circle\n\nBrexit may strengthen the argument for UK startups to expand directly to the US, as EU market access from the UK is eroded, and regulatory regimes diverge.\n\nDominic Jacquesson\n\nIndex Ventures\n\nDelaying Factors\n\nRegardless of your archetype, there are three sets of factors which could limit your ability to consider expansion at a given point in time. By forcing a delay to US expansion, these factors may also nudge your optimal archetype, from Compass to Pendulum, or from Pendulum to Anchor.\n\ni) Localisation & regulation\n\nCertain sectors require minimal localisation for the US market, beyond translation of product and sales & marketing collateral. Mobile gaming, for example, or in B2B, productivity tools (e.g. Typeform). If you are already picking up US users or customers, or at least inbound US leads, you have a market signal that you are close to product/market fit for a US audience.\n\nIn our survey of European founders, the US was already the largest single market for 32% of startups before their US expansion, and was in the top three markets for over 60% of them.\n\nHowever, launching into the US often requires more radical localisation, which stands in the way of acquiring any US customers at all. This is self-evident if you have a physical or service component to your business model (eg local e-commerce). Likewise if you operate in a regulated sector, and need to obtain licences to operate in the US. Regulation in the US may be determined at a federal, state, or local level - or even a combination of these, and approvals can take 12-18 months.\n\nThe US isn’t a simple, single market. People flagged this to me, but I didn’t fully appreciate it until I experienced it. Each state has its own regime, and our compliance team had to pitch each one separately, in-person, for regulatory approval.\n\nJoe Cross\n\nFormer GM US, TransferWise\n\nFor regulated or quasi-regulated sectors healthcare fintech, music (because of labels) - going global from day one is too capital intensive. You could lose a fortune. Start with a ‘wedge’ market, then leverage that advantage. For example, the UK FCA sandbox is a great advantage for fintech startups.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder, Spotify\n\nEven in unregulated sectors, US customer requirements may be very different from what you’re used to in Europe. The US may require additional product features and functionality - or alterations to existing features. Further, your GTM approach may need to be heavily localised to work in the US. This could be as obvious as a brand name which fails to resonate in the US. Or it could be more subtle, reflecting differences in decision-making by your target US clients.\n\nThere is a lot of talk in tech about starting with an inferior product, but in many sectors you cannot do that. For example, you don’t have a viable fintech product without fraud detection.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO & founder Spotify\n\nii) Competitive environment\n\nYou may have a totally new and innovative product, with no direct competitor in either Europe or the US. This opens up a landgrab opportunity in the US. Alternatively, you may offer a superior product, but need to dislodge incumbents. You could also be faced with (one, or multiple) new entrants, who have already successfully launched. If these competitors are in Europe, you have to decide whether a US expansion risks losing an early lead in your ‘home’ market. If your competitor is from the US, and already growing strongly there, you will have to decide whether to go up against them, and if so, how to differentiate yourself.\n\nThe US is much more competitive, and the companies you compete with there are much better, and much better-funded.\n\nSamir Desai\n\nCEO & co-founder, Funding Circle\n\niii) Human & financial capital\n\nThe year after raising a Series A, you may have a team of 50 people, half of whom are focused on product development. On the GTM side, you’ll have a small team. If the two factors discussed above suggest that your path to a successful US launch will be complex, it is unlikely that you’ll have the capacity yet to execute a successful US expansion. It’s better in this case to build bench-strength in your team, optimise your GTM approach, prove your unit economics, and raise your Series B or C with a clear objective of US expansion.\n\nBuild a strong foundation in Europe first, so that you have enough cash to expand, or can raise enough at a good valuation; US expansion will take longer, and will be more expensive, than you think.\n\nDr Gero Decker\n\nCEO & founder, Signavio\n\nTen steps to qualify the US\n\nIf there is still uncertainty around whether, or when, is the right moment for US expansion, this is evidence of a knowledge gap. The solution in this case is to educate yourself through a more rigorous qualification process. This needs to be conducted without distracting you from more immediate priorities. The end-goal is a ‘go / no-go’ decision on whether to expand into the US. In the case of a no-go, you may determine that this is just a matter of timing. You can return focus to pan-European expansion. But the research will have given you a US launch roadmap, ready to pick up once you have a stronger product offer, deeper team expertise, and the necessary financial firepower.\n\nWe started too wide with the US, trying to build a critical mass there, without fully grasping why we were doing it. Now we have refocused our strategy to know we are in the US for partnerships. That gives us a clearer idea of what to do, and who to hire.\n\nRobert Muñoz\n\nco-founder, Typeform\n\nWe made our US jump when I knew that I could move, without worrying that this would slow down our European business.\n\nJB Rudelle\n\nChairman & Founder (former CEO), Criteo\n\nHere is our ten-step guide to successful US market qualification:\n\n1. Create a research brief\n\nDevelop a 3-4 month US research timetable which will end with a go/no-go decision. Key research elements:\n\nValue chain comparison\n\nCustomer research\n\nCompetitor research & positioning\n\nProduct localisation\n\nLocation recommendation\n\nRegulation\n\nOperations (legal, financial, HR, IP, subsidiary, etc)\n\nPre- and post-launch timetable\n\nYear one budget, and staffing plan\n\n2. Find a researcher\n\nIdentify a freelancer or team member to conduct GTM research. They should bring a blend of analytical and GTM experience, and have US insight. They should be US native (or even better, a European expat).\n\nImmerse your researcher in your European HQ for a month. They need to get to know the product, GTM approach and team. They can also spend this time conducting initial desk-research.\n\n3. Assess product readiness\n\nDesignate a team member to be responsible for the US product.You will need to be very clear about whether the product is US-ready and what localisation will be required. Can you win competitive pitches? Can you deliver an equivalent NPS score to US vs European customers? Can you retain customers, and be ready to land-and-expand?\n\nFind a niche in the US, and grow from there. Try to select the smallest segment you can. Not the largest. Don’t be tempted to market to everyone. Once you have your niche, talk to as many people in this niche. Show them your product, test it, get feedback and iterate.\n\nGil Sadis\n\nVP Product, Lemonade\n\nUS expansion often means going through the process of finding product/market fit again. It’s rare that no product tweaks are needed.\n\nAri Helgason\n\nIndex Ventures\n\n4. Create a squad and work in sprints\n\nCreate a ‘US squad’ with weekly or biweekly targets and updates. The CEO or another exec can champion the project but should not oversee day to day research. The squad should include the lead researcher, plus a representative from each of product, engineering, sales, and marketing.\n\n5. Conduct US research in-market\n\nHave your researcher spend time in the US to gather more insight. They should plan to immerse themselves there for a few months (more effective), else plan a sequence of week-long trips. The founder or other squad members may join for some of the time. Spending this time interfacing with potential customers and partners will allow you to tailor your GTM for the US audience.\n\nAmerica is so big that we needed to re-think our GTM completely. I knew this intellectually, but it took me a long time to really get it.\n\nPeter Holten Mühlmann\n\nCEO & founder, Trustpilot\n\nLeverage your US network for intros. Particularly for connections to target customers. Ask your co-founders, wider team, advisors, investors, suppliers, and existing customers.\n\nSpend a lot of time there to meet people; potential customers, partners, talent, and other founders - to get to know the context really well.\n\nTeun van den Dries\n\nCEO & co-founder, GeoPhy\n\n6. Draw up a budget\n\nYou need to allocate sufficient cash to finance your US expansion. This needs to satisfy not only your base case, but also sequenced ‘quadruple-down’ (ie more aggressive than double-down) milestones in case of early success. In other words, be prepared to landgrab in the US, if a window of opportunity opens up.\n\nIn enterprise SaaS, where customers often pay upfront for a full year, capital outlay could be lower. But you may choose to follow a beta-strategy with early US customers, whilst building confidence that your product is ready to roll-out. With monthly-billed SaaS, it will take much longer to get to positive cashflow. So your cash outlay will tend to be highest in scenarios where you achieve the most success.\n\n7. Go / No-Go decision\n\nOnce you are ready to make this call, convene the CEO, leadership team, and the board. While the CEO’s commitment is the most important, all three must be aligned and supportive.\n\nDefine metrics for success.Develop a timeline, with sequenced milestones for decisions to quadruple-down versus withdraw from the US. Milestones should include customer number and revenue goals, at 3, 6, and 12 months, with a commitment to stick to these. Share them with the board, to ensure alignment, and to keep you honest.\n\n8. Prepare your landing team\n\nEach person you select for your landing team needs to combine having an essential core skill-set, plus being a DNA-carrier for your culture. We typically see 2-4 individuals, senior & junior, with a commercial orientation, that may move over a six month timeframe. If you are pursuing a Compass archetype, it is essential that the landing team is led by a founder. For the Pendulum, it is desirable. For the Anchor, it is less important. If lots of localisation is required, it might be good to have a developer join the squad. Clarify with each member of your team whether this will be a “tour of duty” versus a potential permanent move.\n\nGet the US visa application process in motion asap. Plan for 6 months from the process of application to verdict. The less experienced or specialised your landing team members, the harder it may be to get visas, so get your lawyers involved early on, and have contingency plans in case of delays or rejections (see the section on visas in Chapter 8 for more detail).\n\n9. Create your launch plan\n\nBased on your product, competitive positioning, and GTM, you will need to decide on whether to have a big or small launch. If you need minimal localisation, you could go for a soft launch, learning and optimising in iterations. If you need a lot of localisation, it could be worth spending dedicated time beta testing, leading up to a big launch. Assess the importance of referenceable launch partners, and prioritise efforts to acquire them accordingly.\n\nWhile waiting for visas, conduct frequent US visits to prepare for launch. You can use these trips to support beta customers, and for product testing, identifying office space, and developing marketing collateral.\n\n10. Plan for success\n\nOnce you have made a clear commitment to go, make sure you are appropriately resourcing the plan, both financially and with the right people. You are not going to succeed by dipping a toe in the market. If there is massive growth, would you, as CEO, be willing and able to move? And if not you, what is the alternative US leadership plan? This is the reverse of disaster planning!\n\nTesting the waters for US product market fit\n\nAbout: Spendesk is rethinking the way employees make company purchases, and the way businesses manage all expenses.\n\nFounded: Paris, 2016\n\nFundraising: 2017 $2.2M Seed\n\n2018 $8M Series A (Index)\n\n2019 $38.4M Series B (Index)\n\nFundraising to date: €45M, Series B\n\nHeadcount split: 190 (100% Europe)\n\nGTM: Inside sales\n\nLeadership location: Europe\n\nEngineering location: Europe\n\nFounder location: Paris\n\nFounder/CEO: Rodolphe Ardant\n\nAmbition and opportunity\n\nSpendesk has a huge opportunity within Europe, already launching beyond France, into Germany and the UK. However, the team also has global ambitions for the business, so they are balancing the pan-European focus, with careful preparation for US expansion.\n\nIndex Ventures has worked closely with Spendesk over the last 2 years, helping them to qualify the US market. The Index team in San Francisco made introductions to three specific groups: CEOs and CFOs in mid-market company prospects; CROs in US SaaS companies to learn about recruiting and organisation design; and specialist advisors such as lawyers. Rodolphe made multiple trips to SF to build his US network and insight.\n\nCommercial research hire and onboarding\n\nSpendesk was approached by a Vancouver-based sales professional with relevant sector knowledge, and who had lived in Europe previously. He was excited by the product offering. Rod hired him on a 12 month contract to start researching the US opportunity.\n\nThis researcher spent six weeks in Paris HQ, becoming knowledgeable with the product, getting to know people, and embedding himself in the sales team. He conducted desk research on Spendesk’s US competitors (Brex, Divvy and Procurify), and drafted a 12 month US roadmap.\n\nUS Squad\n\nA six-person squad was formed, responsible for US expansion. This included Rodolphe, the researcher, and senior individuals from sales, marketing, product/banking, and growth. They worked in two-week sprints, with a weekly status call between the US and Nico, and an alternating biweekly squad call with Rod. This rhythm worked well.\n\nProduct Build-Out\n\nEstimating that they would need 12 months to line up the right banking partnerships and infrastructure, a pair of senior individuals from the product and compliance teams got to work, whilst the GTM research was conducted in parallel.\n\nCustomer Feedback\n\nThe US researcher spent the next few months on the West Coast, conducting 60 discovery calls with target customers, after getting kicked off with introductions from Index Ventures, the Spendesk team, and suppliers. His target persona was CFOs of tech companies or agencies with 50-1,000 headcount. He offered $50 Amazon gift cards to kick off referrals, but ended up needing only five.\n\nHe had a serendipitous breakthrough when he was introduced to a CFO who was expecting a sales call rather than a research one. This conversation led to a major insight on how to initially position Spendesk for the US.\n\nResults of Analysis\n\nThe US customer research validated that Spendesk could solve the same core problems in the US as in Europe. They would however need to introduce a new US specific persona, with a more targeted initial pain-point and target company demographic.\n\nIn terms of location, the team conducted a comparison between NY and SF. They chose SF despite the timezone challenges, because of the higher density of customers in their target segments. SF is also where all potential direct and indirect competitors are based, enabling Spendesk’s proposition to be proof-tested faster. They anticipate a ramp-up of sales capacity in a secondary location, if and when they prove traction.\n\nPlan for Beta Launch\n\nSpendesk had been launched in the UK, so they had already integrated multi-currency, and an English language version. They concluded that their European VAT framework was capable of supporting US state and local tax complexities.\n\nWith the US product ready ahead of schedule, the team could focus on the GTM. They identified targets for initial beta customers, and the integrations required. They also identified leadgen, channel, and hiring requirements. The goal of the beta launch was to accelerate the path to learning, with 10-15 non-paying customers.\n\nThe proposed landing team included three team members from HQ, covering growth (Jeremy), sales, and a developer. As employee #5, Jeremy could also carry cultural DNA. Their plan was to set up the US, hire locally, and then return to Europe.\n\nConviction Journey\n\nThe company’s focus is to establish market leadership across Europe, which presents an enormous opportunity given the size of the market. There is a small first-year (2020) US revenue target, but nothing beyond that as yet.\n\nOur US expansion is a startup within our startup: learning what the path from $0-10m looks like.\n\nNico Marchais\n\nSales & Revenue Director\n\nSpendesk has developed a ‘double down or retreat framework’ including marquee logo milestones. The Spendesk CFO has developed a clear US expansion budget.\n\nThe Spendesk board insisted on retaining the company’s core focus on European expansion, but were supportive of setting-up a team on-the-ground to validate the US market opportunity.\n\nLaunch\n\nSpendesk have recently launched their US beta.
