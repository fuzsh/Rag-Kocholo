The property is proposed to increase from 25 feet wide to 27 feet wide through a boundary line adjustment and the two-story home is proposed to be 3 feet from each side property line. The structure will meet the minimum front and rear setbacks. A variance to the number and type of parking spots is requested to allow for three parking spots, all unenclosed, instead of two enclosed and two unenclosed. The final two variances are to allow the parking pad to be in the front, which is not allowed in the R-3 zone, and to use 100% of the front yard for the driveway instead of the maximum 60%.\n\nLOCATION:\n\nThe Skagit County Assessor describes the site as parcel P54841; the site is located on the South side of East Section St between 6th and 7th streets within a portion of the NW ¼ of Section 29, Township 34 North, Range 04 East, W.M.\n\nFILES: Click HERE to be directed to the City’s permit portal.
