We ask that students and families to check their state's COVID website prior to their visit for quarantine restrictions and plan accordingly.\n\nParking will be located on the Visitors Side of the Floyd Street Parking Garage. 9 a.m. - 5 p.m EST, you may proceed to the East side of the Student Activities Center, outside of the Campus Store. Complete the self check-in at the welcome desk and pick up your guide and map.\n\nUse the University of Louisville Campus Map to find your way to each stop.\n\nAlthough you will be enjoying campus with your own family we ask that you follow these guidelines while on our campus. View full safety procedures for visitors.\n\nIf you would like to explore the University of Louisville's campus from home or another off-campus location, please check out our Virtual Tour. And if you haven't already participated in an in-person or virtual campus visit, be sure to schedule one soon! It's the best way to learn about UofL and what awaits you as a Cardinal.\n\nEnjoy the view in the Belknap Academic Building Quad, newly renamed the 2020 Quad in honor of the graduating class of 2020. Remember not to step on Louie the Cardinal if you see him!"
