These exhibits are a magnificent opportunity to bring the magic of the Latin GRAMMYs to the public,\" said Manuel Abud, CEO of the Latin Recording Academy. \"We invite all music lovers to join us in New York City, Los Angeles and Miami to enjoy these exhibits, which are filled with unforgettable moments and important achievements that have marked our history.\"\n\nThe 2024 Latin GRAMMYs, officially known as the 25th Annual Latin GRAMMY Awards, will air live from the Kaseya Center in Miami on Thursday, Nov. 14. The three-hour telecast, produced by TelevisaUnivision, the world's leading Spanish-language media and content company, will broadcast live on Univision, Galavisión, and ViX on Thursday Nov. 14, beginning at 8 p.m. ET/PT (7 p.m. CT), with a one-hour pre-show starting at 7 p.m. ET/PT. This year’s nominees will be announced on Tuesday, Sept. 17.\n\nThis year, the Latin GRAMMYs will debut a new Field and two new Categories: Best Latin Electronic Music Performance, housed within the new Electronic Music Field, and Best Contemporary Mexican Music Album (Regional-Mexican Field). Ahead of the 2024 Latin GRAMMYs, the Latin Recording Academy will host the official Latin GRAMMY Week 2024, which includes multiple events throughout Miami-Dade County including the 2024 Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year gala, which this year honors 18-time Latin GRAMMY winner and two-time GRAMMY winner Carlos Vives.\n\nLearn more about the new Latin Recording Academy exhibits taking place in New York City, Los Angeles and Miami below:\n\nThe Paley Museum, New York City\n\nSept. 13 - Nov. 3\n\nThe Latin GRAMMYs kick-off exhibit at the Paley Museum showcases the remarkable 25-year history of Latin music, celebrating the vibrant cultural tapestry that has shaped the awards show into a global phenomenon. Visitors can explore priceless artifacts, glamorous costumes, and iconic instruments from music superstars like Ricky Martin, Rosalía, Carlos Santana, and Shakira — all Latin GRAMMY and GRAMMY winners — as well as celebrated New Yorkers such as Celia Cruz and Rúben Blades, whose influence has left an indelible mark on the music world. The exhibit will highlight some of the most unforgettable moments from the Latin GRAMMY Awards telecast, trace the show’s incredible evolution, and demonstrate why Latin music has become an essential part of our culture.\n\n\"It is a tremendous honor to partner with the Latin Recording Academy and to have the privilege of hosting this historic 25th anniversary celebration of the Latin GRAMMY Awards at the Paley Center,\" said Maureen J. Reidy, President & CEO of The Paley Center for Media. \"This must-see exhibit will honor the indelible impact of Latin music and its visionary artists, whose innovative rhythms, poignant lyrics, and extraordinary contributions have redefined the global musical landscape and have had a profound impact not only on music but on entertainment and culture worldwide.\"\n\nGRAMMY Museum, Los Angeles\n\nSept. 19 - Dec. 18\n\nHosted on the 2nd floor of the GRAMMY Museum as part of its permanent Latin Music Gallery, this exhibit will enhance the museum's extensive Latin aisle by featuring artifacts from global Latin superstars like Shakira, Carlos Santana, Karol G, and Rosalía, among others. The exhibit will explore the last 25 years of Latin GRAMMY history and the diverse musical genres and cultures that have graced its stage.\n\nAt its core, the exhibit underscores how Latin music has evolved into a powerful commercial force in the international music landscape over the past quarter-century, with the Latin GRAMMYs playing a pivotal role in its global rise. The exhibit will also explore the history of the institution and its most significant moments, highlighting Latin music's creative complexity and enduring cultural impact.\n\n\"The Latin GRAMMYs have undeniably established themselves as a cultural landmark and a powerful influence in global music over the past 25 years,\" said Michael Sticka, President and CEO of the GRAMMY Museum. \"This fall, we eagerly anticipate commemorating more than two decades of musical excellence, memorable highlights, and extraordinary moments from the Latin GRAMMYs at the GRAMMY Museum.\"\n\nGary Nader Art Centre, Miami\n\nSept. 26 - Dec. 20\n\nMiami will host a first-of-its-kind collection of 25 years of Latin GRAMMY official art, featuring original paintings by renowned artists including Romero Britto, Walter Goldfarb, Michael V. Rios — who also designed the cover of Carlos Santana’s multi-GRAMMY-winning album Supernatural —and Patssi Valdez, among others. From mixed media to collage, murals and oil paintings, the collection includes renowned visual artists from several countries. In addition,Brazilian muralist Aline Bispo, the official artist for the 24th Annual Latin GRAMMY Awards, will unveil a new piece to inaugurate the festivities.\n\n\"It is a profound honor to host the art exhibition commemorating the Latin GRAMMYs at our gallery in Miami. This city, with its vibrant culture and deep Latin roots, is the perfect setting to celebrate the rich heritage and artistic achievements of Latin music. We are thrilled to bring together art and music in such a dynamic fashion, highlighting the synergy between these two powerful expressions of creativity,\" said Gary Nader, founder of the Gary Nader Art Centre.\n\nIn 2005, South Korean producer and songwriter Bang Si-Hyuk (aka \"hitman\" Bang) founded Bit Hit Entertainment. Only eight years later, he finished assembling what would come to be the label’s groundbreaking boy group, BTS. The rest is history, now chronicled in \"HYBE: We Believe In Music,\" the first full-floor K-pop exhibit at the GRAMMY Museum, which runs through Sept. 15.\n\nFollowing the success of Bit Hit’s premier act, and that of other artists under acquired labels SOURCE MUSIC and PLEDIS Entertainment, the company eventually evolved to become HYBE in 2021. \"I think HYBE is very special in that they have gone beyond being just a K-pop company,\" says Kelsey Goelz, curator of the exhibit. \"They have many different sub labels. They’ve come to America and gotten involved in the music business here, and then they’re also working in AI and gaming.\"\n\nBut beyond its global presence, one of K-pop’s ever-captivating elements is the sheer amount of blood, sweat, and tears that goes into making it possible, even when HYBE artists like ENHYPEN, SEVENTEEN, and LE SSERAFIM make it look easy. There’s a core humanity to this work ethic and dogged tenacity — to the level of artistry in general — that speaks to K-pop fans around the world.\n\nWhile HYBE’s growth shows no signs of slowing down yet, the GRAMMY Museum exhibit takes a look back on the entertainment company’s legacy thus far. Read on for the five things we learned from the \"HYBE: We Believe In Music\" exhibit.\n\nAll photos Courtesy of the Recording Academy™️/photo by Rebecca Sapp, Getty Images© 2024.\n\nIn A Decade, BTS Built Themselves IntoA Global Phenomenon\n\nHYBE’s proffered ethos is \"we believe in music\" — this motto gives the special exhibit its name, while also serving as a mission statement.\n\nIn a series of recorded interviews on view in the exhibit, HYBE’s idol songwriters share their process for and perspective on making music. The main takeaway: Inspiration comes in different forms. While writing, BTS’s j-hope pictures ideas as tree branches that sprout outward, while RM sees his rap verses as a realized world to live inside.\n\nLiterally, too, their lyrics mark the passage of time. If you’ve ever wondered why Suga circles back to motifs across the years, the rapper has all the answers for you here.\n\nThere’s also a conversation with WOOZI of SEVENTEEN, one of the K-pop industry’s most prolific idol composers with more than 150 credits to his name. It’s a penchant for plain language, he says, that makes the lyrics he writes really sing; the band’s beloved B-side \"Hug,\" for example, gets its potency from everyday words and phrases. TOMORROW X TOGETHER’s Yeonjun likewise fills visitors in on the origin story behind co-written \"Maze in the Mirror,\" a misty reflection of their tough trainee days.\n\nThis isn’t to say they haven’t had help, of course. Nearby, clips of HYBE producers Pdogg, BUMZU, and ZICO, settled in their respective studios, walk us through how the instrumentals for songs like BTS’s \"ON\" and SEVENTEEN’s \"Lilili Yabbay\" came to be. Peruse at your leisure — for those curious about the creation of K-pop’s biggest hits, this corner of the exhibit could easily take up the better part of a trip.\n\nFans Make K-Pop Special\n\nThe GRAMMY Museum joins forces with HYBE to present its newest exhibit, HYBE: We Believe In Music, A GRAMMY Museum Exhibit. This interactive exhibit chronicles the history and impact of HYBE, and showcases its legacy of unparalleled innovation and creativity as a trend-setting global entertainment brand.\n\nThe exhibit opens on Aug. 2 in downtown Los Angeles and features spotlight moments with K-pop stars BTS, SEVENTEEN, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, ENHYPEN, LE SSERAFIM, and many more. \"HYBE: We Believe In Music\" runs through Sept.15. The exhibit will kick off on Aug. 1 with \"Global Spin Live: TWS,\" a program featuring a moderated conversation with K-pop group TWS, followed by a performance.\n\nThe exhibit traces HYBE's evolution and influence by showcasing instantly recognizable artifacts from its roster of artists, creators, and fans. The displays notably feature original outfits worn in iconic music videos such as \"Yet To Come (The Most Beautiful Moment)\" by BTS, \"MAESTRO\" by SEVENTEEN, \"Sugar Rush Ride\" by TOMORROW X TOGETHER, \"Sweet Venom\" by ENHYPEN, and \"EASY\" by LE SSERAFIM. HYBE: We Believe In Music also boasts accessories and performance gear donned by ZICO, fromis_9, BOYNEXTDOOR, TWS, &TEAM, and ILLIT. The exhibit marks the first time these artifacts will be on display together in one location.\n\nOther highlights include interactive sing-along and dance rooms, a dedicated Fan Section celebrating the endless support between HYBE artists and their fandoms, a Mono to Immersive room featuring BTS's 2022 GRAMMYs performance of \"Butter,\" and a Photoism Booth that allows visitors to pose alongside their favorite K-pop artists. The GRAMMY Museum exhibit will also feature exclusive video content with producers, artists, music videos, and more.\n\n\"HYBE and their artists represent the present and future of the global music landscape, and our goal with this exhibit is to deepen the appreciation and respect for its creators and performers,\" says Michael Sticka, President/CEO of the GRAMMY Museum. \"HYBE has contributed to creating a playground of innovation that inspires fandoms that transcend age, gender, geography and beyond. The GRAMMY Museum is thrilled to provide a space where fans can express their love for K-pop and feel closer to their favorite idols.\"\n\nRead more: 11 Rookie K-Pop Acts To Know In 2024: NCT Wish, RIIZE, Kiss Of Life & More\n\nHYBE Chief Operating Officer Taeho Kim added, \"Putting out an exhibition that captures HYBE's journey is a new experience for us. We're very excited about this partnership with GRAMMY Museum, and we look forward to welcoming music fans who visit the museum to enjoy and connect with our historical pieces.\"\n\nThe exhibit highlights the roots of HYBE's meteoric rise. In 2005, South Korean producer, composer, and songwriter Bang Si-Hyuk, known as \"hitman\" Bang, changed the trajectory of Korean pop music by launching the record label Big Hit Entertainment. He soon signed a talented 16-year-old rapper named RM, which became the first step in creating the label's groundbreaking boy band — BTS. With the group's global success, \"hitman\" Bang and Big Hit Entertainment became known as musical trailblazers and record industry innovators. Big Hit Entertainment has now evolved into HYBE, which only continues to break boundaries in music and beyond."
