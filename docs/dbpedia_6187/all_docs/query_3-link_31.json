        "text": "During the same week of spring break, a third group of students visited Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the two largest emirates making up the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Forty students from the full-time, fully employed and executive programs participated in the sixth global immersion course to focus on and travel to the UAE. The course, which focused on “Dubai and Its Evolving Role in the United Arab Emirates, Middle East and the World,” was taught by Eric Sussman, adjunct professor of accounting and real estate. This was the fifth time that Professor Sussman led a course to the Middle East. The last time he accompanied a group to the region was in December 2021.\n\nThe UAE, a country consisting of seven emirates, has experienced significant volatility in the last decade, as it emerged as a significant economic and transportation hub, whose growth trajectory and even its existence were impacted significantly by the Great Recession and declines in oil prices, along with the consequences of debt-financed growth. How did this extraordinary growth and transformation occur? How has the country been able to balance its (constitutional) monarchal structure, Islam, and Sharia (Islamic financial law), with capitalism and economic transparency? How has Dubai managed its growth with its increasing cost of living? How have Dubai, its far more oil-rich neighbor Abu Dhabi, and the other five emirates (Ajman, Fujairah, Ras-al-Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al-Quwain) maintained their economic and political affiliation, holding the UAE together? In many ways, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and the UAE in general are places of great contradiction, blending and maintaining some equilibrium of both east and west. The global immersion course explored these topics through on-campus lectures that were complemented by the immersion week in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. During the in-country week, students heard from and engaged with many prominent and influential business leaders, academics, entrepreneurs and members of the civil society in the UAE, including UCLA Anderson alumni, and visited places of historical significance and cultural importance. The series of lectures, presentations and moderated discussions helped illuminate the UAE’s political, economic and business environments, and the substantial changes that have occurred over the last several decades. Students explored policies and initiatives to balance accelerated economic growth with environmental and distributional concerns in the context of an emerging global economic powerhouse. The course also provided students with a working knowledge of economic activity and policy, capital markets, real estate investment and sustainable development, and technology innovations in the UAE.\n\nDuring the inaugural morning sessions in Dubai, which were held at the Intelak, a technology and innovation hub that supports early and late-stage start-ups, students heard from Jad Damaj and Brendan Noonan. Jad Damaj is group head of investments for Majid Al Futtaim, a Dubai-based Emirati holding company. Damaj spoke about the family-owned conglomerate that owns and operates shopping malls, retail, and hotel establishments in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Students learned about the conglomerate’s performance and various properties in the region, its retail, leisure, entertainment and lifestyle businesses and its robust governance structure. Damaj also highlighted some of its impressive sustainability efforts. Majif Al Futtaim is best known as the owner of the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai and for being the franchisee of French hypermarket chain Carrefour in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia. Brendan Noonan is former senior vice president of learning and development at the Emirates Airline Group. Noonan provided a highly informative overview of Dubai’s history and evolution over the years. He also shared the fascinating story of Dubai-based Emirates Airlines, one of the two flag carriers of the UAE, where he worked for almost 25 years, from its beginnings in 1985 to today, one of the world’s most valuable airline brands. He spoke about Emirates strategy, the future of the airline industry, global greenhouse gas emissions and the outlook for worldwide air travel. He also addressed the importance of travel and the significance of tourism, a major source of revenue for Dubai’s economy. This session was of particular interest to students who had completed a case in class on Emirates Airline. Following the morning sessions, students visited the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding (SMCUU), located in a beautifully restored wind tower house in the historic Al Fahidi Historical Neighborhood in Bur Dubai. Here the group had an opportunity to engage in an interactive conversation and learn more about Emirati culture, customs and traditions, while enjoying some traditional Emirati food. SMCUU is a non-profit organization that educates and promotes awareness of Emirati culture, customs, traditions and religion among expatriates and foreign visitors in the UAE. With its motto Open Doors, Open Minds, all questions – no matter how sensitive – were welcomed. In 2015, the SMCCU became a member of The Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Global Initiatives and continues to be a bridge between the many different nationalities living, working and visiting the UAE through its award-winning programs. The experience also included a visit to the Diwan Mosque, with its distinctive ornate flat dome and slender minaret that watches over the Al Fahidi Historic District. These sessions provided an excellent foundation and context for the week’s program.\n\nAt Jumeirah Emirates Towers, on the bustling Sheikh Zayed Road, students heard from Ghaith Rahman, senior projects lead for the Dubai Future Foundation. The Foundation, which was formed in 2016 by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice president and prime minister of the UAE, and ruler of Dubai to institutionalize future-shaping, is a reflection of the city in which it was born, starting with humble beginnings yet driven with ambitious goals, with the vision to make Dubai a leading city of the future. The Foundation’s strategic areas of focus include building a cohesive innovation ecosystem with accelerator programs, incubators, labs, regulatory sandboxes and knowledge platforms. Its activity can be broadly categorized into five strategic business units: future, foresight and imagination (its research arm); content and knowledge dissemination; capacity building; future design and acceleration (facilitating collaborations between the government, private sector partners, start-ups and individuals and encouraging the testing of new ideas); and future experience (with the iconic Museum of the Future, that showcases what is possible). Students also had the opportunity to see the Dubai Youth x Hub which welcomes youth from all walks of life, aged between 15 and 35, and serves as a platform to connect youth with each other and develop and launch-spring their ideas. Later, the group visited the Museum of the Future, the futuristic landmark whose goal is to inspire and empower people to positively shape humanity’s next chapter, and using virtual reality, augmented reality, and other modern technologies helps visitors peek at the future.\n\nIn keeping with one of the key themes of the course, during a panel discussion with representatives from Jacobs, students learned about environmental and sustainability projects in the region. Jacobs is a U.S. international company, that provides engineering, technical, professional and construction services, as well as scientific and specialty consulting for a broad range of clients globally, including companies, organizations and government agencies. Students learned about Jacob’s role in the delivery of Expo 2020, the largest event ever to be staged in the Arab world, as program management consultants and its joint venture with Mace (Jacobs Mace JV). They also heard how Jacobs supported multinationals in their build and sustainability of the site. One of the key objectives outlined in the bid to host Expo 2020 was to build a legacy with a global destination that offered a new alternative for urban living. More than 80% of the physical infrastructure has been retained and the site transformed into an innovation-driven and people-centric city of the future - Expo City Dubai (Expo City), which the group visited and toured later in the week with representatives from Jacobs. During the tour, they learned about Terra - the sustainability pavilion as well as the Expo City Farm where organic farming can be seen in action. Expo City’s sustainability strategy builds on the legacy of Expo 2020 Dubai and is targeting net zero by 2050. Having worked closely with Expo 2020 Dubai since 2015, it was natural for Jacobs to continue to support the transition and evolution of Expo City Dubai. Jacobs continues to provide support as the program manager, as well as provide strategic support in a number of areas to help shape the sustainability strategy and decarbonization roadmap.\n\nAt the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) Innovation Hub, students learned about the start-up and fintech environment in Dubai. DIFC is a special economic zone in Dubai, established in 2004 as a financial hub for companies operating throughout the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA) markets. DIFC is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority, an independent regulator exclusive to the zone, and by its own court system, which is separate from the Emirate of Dubai's legal system and that of the federal government of the UAE. It also follows the common law framework and operates in English. In addition to learning about the start-up and fintech environment, students were educated on the DIFC Innovation Hub itself which is the largest financial innovation ecosystem in the region, and home to more than 700 growth-stage tech firms, innovation and tech firms, established innovation companies, digital labs, venture capital firms, regulators, and educational entities. The Hub is also home to the first and largest fintech accelerator in MEASA, and provides fintech, insurtech, regtech and Islamic fintech start-ups with the ability to capitalize on opportunities in front of the region's most established financial service organizations. The community includes accelerator programs, licensing, co-working support, a community of like-minded individuals, and a supportive and comprehensive regulatory framework. This session was complemented by many presentations and interactive discussions during the week that provided students with a deeper understanding and appreciation of the finance and investment environment in the Middle East. Abdelaziz Chazi, professor of finance at the American University of Sharjah, provided an extremely informative session on Islamic finance (or Sharia-compliant finance), a way to manage money that complies with Sharia (Islamic law) and keeps within the moral principles of Islam. The most famous rule in Islamic finance is the ban on usuary. In economic terms, this means lender and borrowers are forbidden from charging or paying interest or riba. Sharia-compliant banks don't issue interest-based loans. Bans on gharar (translated as “uncertainty” or “ambiguity”) also tend to rule out derivatives, options and futures. However, while the prohibition of riba is absolute, some degree of gharar is acceptable. Only conditions of excessive gharar need to be avoided. Professor Chazi has several publications in the area of finance and serves on the editorial board and as a reviewer for a number of academic journals. His past industry experience includes eight years with ExxonMobil Corporation while his current teaching and consulting interests are in the areas of Islamic finance and corporate finance.\n\nThe group also visited the headquarters of Careem to hear the story of the Dubai-based super-app and one of the most prominent consumer internet brands in the Greater MENA region. Founded in 2012, Careem began its journey with the launch of Rides and has successfully transitioned to become a leading Everything App for the region, making it easier than ever to move around, order food and groceries, manage payments, and more. Today, the super-app has operations in over 70 cities in ten countries across the Middle East and South Asia regions from Morocco to Pakistan. The company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber after being acquired for $3.1 billion in January 2020, the largest tech exit in the region. This solidified Careem’s position as the biggest unicorn in the Middle East and provided new opportunities for startups in the region. In the UAE, the super-app currently offers a number of digital services, including ride-hailing, food, grocery, micromobility, DineOut, and a subscription-based service - Careem Plus, among others. Students learned how the market in MENA has favorable demographics with a large percentage of its population under the age of 30, a high urban population, as well as high smartphone penetration and digital adoption rates. The region also faces challenges that provide opportunities to massively simplify people’s lives, for example weak infrastructure, a low percentage of the population with bank accounts, low penetration rates of digital payments, and challenges for women in some markets. Digitization is also still slow in some markets. The opportunity to progress the region and advance its communities is massive.\n\nIn further alignment with a key theme of the course, students visited Atlantis – The Palm where they learned the remarkable Atlantis story and full scope of its world-leading luxury hospitality. Atlantis, The Palm is a Dubai icon and a world-renowned ocean-themed resort located on the tip of Palm Jumeirah, a manmade island shaped like a palm tree. It was the first resort to be built on the island and is themed on the myth of Atlantis but includes distinct Arabian elements. The 1,500+ room nautically themed resort is complemented by the Aquaventure water park, the world’s largest waterpark, and the immersive and themed Lost Chambers Aquarium. The Poseidon and Neptune Underwater Suites at Atlantis - The Palm are two of only a tiny handful of underwater hotel rooms around the world, and regularly appear in lists of the world's most unique accommodation. The group also had the opportunity to tour and explore the impressive resort.\n\nMid-week, the group traveled to Abu Dhabi where they visited Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City (SSMC) and Mubadala Investment Company. Established in 2019, with a vision to be the leading integrated health care destination in the region, SSMC is one of the largest tertiary hospitals in the UAE that specializes in complex care. As one of the most important healthcare developments in the region, SMCC operates state-of-the-art medical care, education and research departments in Abu Dhabi. SSMC was established as part of the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 to elevate healthcare services in the Emirate. It offers comprehensive and interdisciplinary care across 10 clinical departments, 30 divisions and over 46 specialties. Mubadala Investment Company is an Emirati state-owned holding company and sovereign investor with an entrepreneurial mindset. Mubadala manages a diverse portfolio of investments in the UAE and abroad, with a mandate to generate sustainable financial returns for its shareholder, the Government of Abu Dhabi, while delivering positive change and lasting impact on the communities in which it deploys capital. In line with the UAE Government’s commitment, Mubadala is committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions across all scopes of its global portfolio and corporate emissions by 2050. Mubadala was established to accelerate efforts to help diversify Abu Dhabi’s economy by investing in both traditional and non-traditional global sectors. From its first investment in Dolphin Energy, a processor, producer and supplier of natural gas in Qatar, to the successful creation of national champions in renewable energy, health, satellites, manufacturing and technology, Mubadala has achieved significant milestones for the UAE’s economic diversification. During the day trip to Abu Dhabi, students also had the opportunity to visit the impressive and inspiring Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, the largest mosque in the country. The Grand Mosque incorporates architectural styles from different Muslim civilizations and celebrates cultural diversity by creating a haven that is truly welcoming and inspirational in its foundation. Students explored its amethyst-and-jasper-embedded columns, white marble domes, reflective pools that engulf the courtyard, gold-plated Swarovski chandeliers, iconic prayer hall, and courtyard featuring one of the largest marble mosaic artworks in the world.\n\nThe week concluded with a series of presentations that connected many of the dots and complemented the earlier sessions. Michael Bruck, advisor for the Arabian Asian Investment Company, talked more about what is happening in the UAE in a broader context, global geopolitics, UAE’s evolution into a global hub, and explained how technology is evolving in the UAE, including how firms and leaders need to think differently about how to build businesses and start a fund. UCLA Anderson alumnus Ibrahim El-Khalil (’13) associate partner of McKinsey & Co. shared his own observations on the key strategic challenges and opportunities for businesses, general perceptions of the region and discussed his career path from UCLA Anderson to the UAE. Professor Sussman engaged in a moderated fireside chat with Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive officer of Yabi by Souqalmal. She discussed her entrepreneurial journey founding Souqalmal in 2012, a pioneer in digital financial product comparison in the Middle East and spoke about its acquisition in 2022 by Dubai-based investment bank Shuaa Capital. Musa also shared the background around the idea for her second start-up, Yabi by Souqalmal. The financial literacy start-up and first financial education platform in the region, Yabi by Souqalmal, also backed by Shuaa Capital, is an app that offers structured personal finance masterclasses to employees of companies that have signed up for the service, which cover topics such as budgeting, asset allocation, investing in cryptocurrencies, how to buy a home, calculating retirement income and how to invest. The objective is to increase financial literacy by encouraging companies to incorporate financial literacy as part of their employee well-being program. UAE companies that signed up for Yabi by Souqalmal include Careem and Majid Al Futtaim. Musa also spoke to the struggles and successes of businesswomen in the region. Ambareen Musa was named one of the Top 50 most influential women in the Arab World by Arabian Business as well as the Woman Entrepreneur of the Year by The Entrepreneur magazine. She has been a member of the UAE National Debt Panel and the UN Task Force on Digital Financing for the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). On the final day, UCLA Anderson alumni from the FTMBA, UCLA-NUS EMBA and PGPX programs joined the group for a networking lunch.\n\nDuring their time in Dubai, students had the opportunity to visit the Dubai Mall, one of the largest shopping malls in the world, and enjoy a trip on one of the world’s fastest elevators to the 125th floor of the iconic Burj Khalifa skyscraper, the world’s tallest building. At its observation deck, they experienced a bird’s eye view of the surrounding emirate with 360-degree panoramas and learned about the architecture and technology behind this Middle Eastern icon that dominates the skyline and towers over Downtown Dubai at over a staggering 2,720 ft. The week concluded with a late afternoon Desert Safari. In 4x4 land cruisers, students were driven through the red sand dunes and were able to ride a camel across the sand. Sunsets from the dunes are spectacular. Dubai is and has been a titan of trade for centuries and to get a sense of what commerce was like back in the day, students had an opportunity to take a stroll through the city's traditional souks, such as the Gold Souk, one of the most renowned gold jewelry trading centers in the world located on Dubai Creek's south bank in the Deira. At the Spice Souk, located on the other side of the creek, vendors hawk flavors from across the globe, including cinnamon, ginger and chili. The group got to experience some of the local Middle Eastern cuisine through traditional Lebanese and Emirati lunches and dinners. The week truly illuminated the UAE’s political, economic, and business environment, and the substantial changes that have occurred over the last several decades, as well as the region’s rich traditions and history. There was much to be studied and much to be learned!\n\nDuring the same week of spring break, 40 students from three of UCLA Anderson’s MBA programs visited Singapore for the in-country week of the CGM’s Greater China region Global Immersion course. The course, titled: “A Technology Driven Transformation of Society, Enterprises and Consumers,” was led by Terry Kramer, faculty director of the Easton Technology Management Center and adjunct professor. This was the sixth Global Immersion course, taught by Professor Kramer, with this same overarching them and the second time that the course included travel to Singapore. The first course, back in 2019, traveled to Shenzhen and Hong Kong. After successfully redesigning the course and offering exciting and creative alternative formats during the pandemic years, the CGM was happy to be able to reintroduce a travel component once again with travel to Singapore in 2023, and another successful return visit in 2024.\n\nTechnology driven transformation in the Greater China region has been enabled by Government policy, changes in consumer preferences and enterprise driven innovation. With growing political and economic tensions between the Greater China region and the United States, Singapore has emerged in a unique and pivotal role: first, as a “bridge” between the U.S. and the Greater China region; second, as a growing location for regional headquarters both of U.S. and Chinese technology companies; and finally, as a regional hub for technology in the growing Southeast Asia region. Singapore’s importance has recently increased as a result of the many uncertainties around the future role of Hong Kong and the current tensions between the Greater China region and the United States. The course included and utilized travel to Singapore to anchor discussions and visits around Chinese companies that have offices there; Singapore’s perspectives on Chinese consumers and tech offerings and the differences with the U.S.; and to better understand the impressive areas of innovation and dynamic role of technology in the Greater China region as well as its impact on surrounding regions and the world.\n\nTechnology-based innovation themes centered around three key sectors--fintech, technology-based manufacturing and internet services specifically drawing upon contextual leadership—identifying the “cause and effect” of the successes in the region and the likely future outcomes and areas of innovation. During the week, students heard from many prominent business and technology leaders, founders, academics as well as successful entrepreneurs. They met with successful and influential UCLA Anderson alumni and experienced firsthand the power, influence and connections of the UCLA Anderson network in Singapore. The group visited a number of local tech companies – both Chinese and Singaporean and heard from leaders and executives working at Ant Group, NIO, She Loves Tech, Squirrel AI, Temasek and Tencent, among others. Students also visited Alibaba Group, Grab, Meta, SHEIN and OneConnect, among other organizations, that were important in telling the story.\n\nA number of the sessions took place at the National University of Singapore (NUS), UCLA Anderson’s dual degree executive MBA program partner. For the inaugural session, the group heard from Maoyu Lin, director of AI investments and ventures at Temasek, a Singaporean state-owned conglomerate owned by the Government of Singapore. Lin previously worked as head of finance and operations at minden.ai – a Temasek-founded technology venture that seeks to redefine the engagement between brands and consumers in Southeast Asia. Lin explained how AI Pod, part of Temasek’s development engine, builds future capabilities via venture building and investing, and identifies and captures opportunities in AI in the broader portfolio ecosystem. Lin highlighted the mega trends in China, addressed China’s technology landscape, and contrasted China’s leading B2C and B2B tech companies with those in the U.S. He also spoke about Southeast Asia’s digital economy. During the sharing session, he addressed Generative AI and its evolution, its expansion of modalities and described some future potential use cases and how big tech is investing heavily in GenAI. Students were honored to have the opportunity to hear from full-time MBA alumna, Hwee Hua Lim (’89), a CGM founding board member, former Cabinet Minister, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore and co-chairman of Tembusu Partners Pte. Ltd. Lim addressed the varying roles of business and government and the intersection between them, and the importance of working across boundaries and creating a common understanding. Students benefitted immensely from hearing her unique insights and seeing things from the public sector perspective. Lim, who has a unique background in government, business and academia, and a multi-sector view, bought to life how certain economies may be better positioned or lesser positioned in areas of technology-based innovation, such as mobile devices, payment platforms and crypto currencies. She highlighted how crucial the collaboration is between regulators and businesses and how important it is to have a long-term vision, and to proactively manage change. These were two terrific opening sessions that helped to provide a solid foundation and set the stage for the week.\n\nAt NUS Business School, Professor Kramer engaged in a fireside chat with Leanne Robers, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of She Loves Tech, a global acceleration platform for women and technology. Founded in 2015 in Beijing and focused on women-led or women-impact businesses, She Loves Tech is committed to closing the funding gap for women-led and women impact entrepreneurs. During COVID-19, the organization relocated its headquarters to Singapore. After sharing more about her fascinating background, the conversation quickly moved on to address AI and GenAI. She Loves Tech operates around the globe and Roberts described the trends she is seeing across countries and how AI and GenAI are being used in medtech, edtech and fintech across regions. The breadth of topics covered from technology, successful entrepreneurship and the role of both women and men in advancing woman in tech was a major source of inspiration for students that created an incredible set of learnings. Later in the week, students had the opportunity to hear from Derek Li, founder and chairman of Squirrel AI. A Chinese online education technology company that specializes in intelligent adaptive education, Squirrel AI was one of the first companies to offer large scale AI-powered adaptive education solutions in China. Li shared his views on the tech landscape in the Greater China region from first generation C2C to second generation B2C, and provided his unique insights on the present and future of technology-based innovations, allowing a comparative look with the U.S. He described his entrepreneurial journey and shared the remarkable story and impressive innovations of Squirrel AI which enriched the group’s understanding of how technology innovation and AI solutions are disrupting traditional ways of teaching and learning and highlighted the important advances in AI, edtech and entrepreneurship overall.\n\nAfter completing a case in class on Tencent, students were keen to learn more about the multinational technology conglomerate, how it has grown in the Greater China region, and its presence in Southeast Asia. Chermaine Tong, corporate communications manager for Tencent, described some of company’s key milestones as well as Tencent’s digital ecosystem on both the consumer side with games, digital content, utilities, communications and social, and fintech, and on the business side with Tencent Cloud. She also explained how Tencent Singapore plays a central role in the company’s international growth and localization strategy. Stephen Wang, associate director of WeChat, who leads WeChat's operations team for users outside of the Chinese mainland, described WeChat’s history and evolution over the years, the addition of WeChat Pay in August 2013, and its jump from 100 million registered users in March 2012 to over a billion monthly active users in the fall of 2023. Wang described its different online and offline payment options to cover most scenarios and the more recent launch of Weixin channels and live streams which provide a platform to record lives and share creations, allowing users to build their own brands online. Students were interested to understand the business model for WeChat. Adam Najberg then discussed the consumer gaming side. Najberg is responsible for global communications and content at Tencent Games Global, the video game publishing division of Tencent Interactive Entertainment Group Global or IEGG. Launched in 2003, Tencent Games has since grown into a leading global platform for game development, publishing and operations and is dedicated to providing high-quality interactive entertainment experiences to players. It offers games such as Call of Duty Mobile and League of Legends and leverages the rich IP resources within Tencent that span across literature, anime, film, and television. Limitations on the video gaming sector in China in 2021 created some challenges for the gaming sector, however gaming revenue continues to be a strong and important revenue driver for Tencent. The Tencent sessions provided an impressive look at the technology-based innovations at Tencent and brought to life the magic of what Tencent has done across all of its businesses. The speakers brought to life the notable successes and future areas of innovation at Tencent and the role that its super-app plays in user engagement and service delivery.\n\nAt Workcentral, a co-working space on Clemenceau Avenue, Jackal Ma, partner, co-founder and executive director of Tongdun Technology discussed the evolution of fintech in emerging markets – financial inclusion, credit risk assessment, fraud detection and regulation. Tongdun Technology is a Chinese fintech company, a professional third-party intelligent risk management service provider, that integrates technologies such as AI and blockchain to provide intelligent risk control and anti-fraud services to clients from P2P lending, microfinance, banking, insurance, e-commerce, gaming, social media, and live streaming, among other sectors. He described the development of fintech in China, shared some key observations, addressed what he believes to be some of the key battlegrounds, and provided some case studies. This session nicely complemented what the group had learned earlier in the week. Students also heard from Chengchen Hu, head of technology planning and associate vice president for NIO, a Chinese multinational automobile manufacturer. Headquartered in Shanghai, NIO specializes in designing and manufacturing premium smart electric vehicles, and develops battery-swapping stations for its vehicles, as an alternative to conventional charging stations. The automotive industry is on the cusp of profound change, not just with products and technology, but also with the change of user experience and innovation of the products. Hu described the history and evolution of NIO, and its product matrix and technological innovations with EVs, personal assistants and intelligent driving. He also shared how NIO thinks about technology in cars evolving and competitive dynamics on a global scale, as well as entering new geographies. Hu’s ability to communicate the technological foundation of NIO’s EVs with the desired customer experience was invaluable – a great example of hardware and software coming together for enhanced solutions.\n\nGuest speaker sessions during the week were complemented by many fascinating and educational site visits. This year, students were excited to have the opportunity to visit the headquarters of Grab, Southeast Asia’s leading super-app that provides everyday services such as ride-hailing, deliveries (food, packages, groceries), mobile payments and financial services to millions of Southeast Asians. Students learned from UCLA-NUS EMBA alumnus, Jerry Lim (’14), group managing director, and regional head of sales and support, about the evolution of Grab and how Grab’s core technology and AI allows the company to build both a trusted and customized platform. Grab has an amazing way of understanding what’s going to drive value and what is not. Lim shared a number of use cases to demonstrate how GenAI is transforming the whole customer experience. The Grab story as well as his own leadership story represented invaluable learnings for the class.\n\nAt Alibaba Group’s offices, students learned about the story of the Chinese multinational technology company, how it started in e-commerce and then with continuous development and innovation, has formed all-round infrastructure in the digital economy era, from business to finance, to logistics, to cloud computing. They also learned about its success in the Greater China region, its expansion into Southeast Asia, and were given a terrific overview of Alibaba Group’s six main business groups and its ecosystem, with presentations and use cases from the enterprise side (Alibaba Cloud) and the consumer e-commerce side (Taobao). Students heard from Ken Xu, solution architect lead for key account and enterprise (Singapore). Alibaba Cloud’s Model as a Service (MaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) were explained in depth. MaaS extends the limits of what is possible. The group heard how, as a MaaS platform, Alibaba Cloud’s GenAI solution, together with its extensive suite of cloud products and solutions, will be a key differentiator and enabler in helping companies accelerate innovation, create new customer experiences, transform business processes, and capture new market opportunities. Ferdin Joe John Joseph, Alibaba Cloud Certified Expert Cloud Computing, provided a fascinating demonstration of its GenAI products. James Liu, director of new business and head of innovation alliance then briefly talked about Alibaba Cloud’s Singapore Innovation Accelerator which recognizes the need to seed the ecosystem and provides a platform and support system for startups. Jing (Jean) Zhao, country head of Singapore for Taobao presented again this year. She spoke about the history and evolution of Alibaba’s Taobao, the Chinese online shopping platform and mobile shopping app, known as China’s eBay. Taobao focuses on optimizing the user experience and provides logistics solutions to third party providers according to customer needs. The platform facilitates convenient shopping on Taobao and Tmall for Chinese consumers outside mainland China. The visit to Alibaba provided a great set of learnings from its many successes and ongoing successful innovation.\n\nStudents were also excited to visit the headquarters of SHEIN, a global online fashion and lifestyle e-retailer that is committed to making the beauty of fashion accessible to all. Jarrell Ng, associate director of global public affairs, described the company’s history and explained how the company’s online only business model (with no physical stores) empowers customers, creators, independent suppliers and individual entrepreneurs, and leverages its digital-first supply chain and agile, small batch on-demand production model to limit excess inventory. This innovative, customer-driven model allows for more choice at more affordable prices while minimizing waste. By analyzing consumer behavior and measuring customer preferences more accurately and efficiently, SHEIN is able to stay ahead of the trends. This approach also allows SHEIN to understand unique consumer preferences specific to different geographies and enables the company to localize product offerings. Students were intrigued with the power of the platform and impressed with both the breadth and depth of topics covered – – distribution, sales and marketing, manufacturing innovation, design, governance, etc. which created an important set of learnings. A visit to Meta’s impressive offices was also a treat for the class. At the Visitors Experience Center, the group had fun trying Meta’s hardware products, e.g. the Oculus Meta Quest 3 immersive VR headsets. UCLA-NUS EMBA alumna, Cindy Tan (’17), managing director, global clients welcomed the group again this year. In the impressive People Over Pixels room, students enjoyed the very dynamic and engaging presentation and discussion with Tawana Murphy Bennett, head of top accounts and agencies, APAC around the theme of AI powering innovation, creativity and connection. She described the evolution of AI at Meta and how AI powers its family of apps and advertisers’ tools. Murphy Bennett explained how the company is building for the metaverse and provided a great set of learnings regarding the use of AI in the metaverse to create deeper user engagement and enhanced outcomes for advertisers.\n\nThe group also visited OneConnect, established in December 2015 and the fintech arm of the Ping An Group, a Chinese financial services holding company. In its Customer Experience Center, students were given a demo of some of OneConnect’s technologies and applications, including its eKYC, an AI-powered identity verification technology that utilizes facial recognition and is used to optimize the customer experience, and mitigate risks and fraud. Frank Tan, chief business solutions, international group provided a holistic picture of how technology has matured in financial services and the various innovations and technology platforms. He also described how OneConnect drives adoption at a customer, bank and societal level, and touched on differences between markets, the ability to scale, and data privacy. Backed by the strong support of the Ping An Group, OneConnect serves as a one stop end to end technology partner for financial institutions through its solutions, such as digital identity verification, smart lending platform, digital banking and insurtech. Later in the week, the group heard from Derrick Loi, general manager, international business of digital technologies (business unit) at the Ant Group. Loi has a very interesting background working for U.S., European, Singaporean and Chinese-based technology companies with experience in fintech, cloud computing, enterprise data center, digital transformation, data security and data protection. His presentation focused on AI and how it is transforming and reshaping banking and the finance industry, and the role of predictive AI and GenAI in reshaping the finance industry. He described the unique innovation opportunities that AI presents juxtaposed against the risks and challenges, and most importantly how successful innovation leaders manage this important balancing act.\n\nWhile the week’s sessions were noticeably more focused on the fintech and internet services sectors and less on the third vertical, high-tech manufacturing sector, the program included a terrific educational visit to the Jurong Innovation District (JID) and the facilities of JTC Corporation (formerly the Jurong Town Corporation). JTC is a statutory board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry that champions sustainable industrial development and develops industrial infrastructure to support the growth of new industries in Singapore. The country’s manufacturing sector is a significant contributor to the country’s GDP, employs close to half a million workers, and is highly valued and supported by the Singapore Government. At JTC, students learned about the JID, Singapore's advanced manufacturing hub that houses the full value chain of manufacturing activities from research and development (R&D), test-bedding, design and prototyping to production, logistics and manufacturing services. JID is home to a rich and growing ecosystem of corporations and partners including researchers and R&D centers, technology and training providers (e.g. Nanyang Technological University (NTU)), and advanced manufacturers, supporting collaborations as manufacturing enters the era of Industry 4.0. (which is synonymous with smart manufacturing). In addition to advanced manufacturing, key target sectors for JID include the future of mobility, urban solutions, medtech and start-up. Following a presentation, the group visited the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Center (ARTC), located in the JID and led by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), in partnership with NTU. Fannon Lim, deputy director, research development office of the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech), a research institute of A*STAR, discussed the ARTC’s public-private partnership model. ARTC provides a collaborative platform that brings together industry players, public sector research institutes and academia to bridge technological gaps in the adoption of advanced manufacturing and remanufacturing processes. The class was also taken on a tour of the additive manufacturing workshop and next-generation hyper-personalization line. The visit was educational and demonstrated the advanced manufacturing ecosystem at the JID and the clear strategy in place to position Singapore as a global hub for innovation in high-tech manufacturing, while being particularly mindful of the national net-zero target. It was impressive to see the areas of innovation in manufacturing and the ecosystem that has been built, and an inspiring example of the type of successful outcomes that a partnership between business and government can achieve.\n\nMid-week, UCLA Anderson alumni and other guests gathered at the NTUC Center, for a networking event and UCLA Anderson alumni discussion on the impact of AI and digital transformations. Three UCLA-NUS EMBA alumni joined Professor Kramer for a moderated conversation. UCLA Anderson’s Singapore Alumni Chapter President Ken Siow (’14), regional manager director of Southeast Asia for Tencent Cloud, was joined by Cindy Tan (’17) and Ryan Tan (’19), director of the Philanthropy Asia Alliance, part of the Temasek Trust ecosystem. The discussion addressed the impact of AI and digital transformation, and how it is being employed in their own organizations and other organizations. The talented and impressive alumni also shared insights on the impact on consumers, enterprises and society globally and what is currently “top of mind” for them in their respective arena and the greatest opportunities and challenges they see. Over 30 guests attended for an evening of discussion and networking. Both the event and week’s program were a clear demonstration to students of the strength, power and influence of the UCLA Anderson alumni network in Singapore and UCLA Anderson’s strong partnership with the National University of Singapore.\n\nDuring their time in Singapore, students also experienced local culture, visited key sites of important historic significance and enjoyed local cuisine. UCLA-NUS EMBA alumnus Kevin Yap (’19) hosted the group at his Straits Chinese Restaurant and served authentic Peranakan cuisine epitomizing the region. Before the start of the academic sessions, students enjoyed a Sunday afternoon tour of the island city-state where they explored the Marina Bay area and visited the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and its Ce La Vi Singapore: Restaurant, SkyBar & Club Lounge. The SkyBar, located on the 57th floor, provided spectacular panoramic views of Singapore's skyline and astounding views of the bay. Students were also able to see the Marina Bay Sands infinity pool where guests were enjoying a soak in the world’s largest rooftop infinity pool. The group took photos at the famous Singapore landmark Merlion Park and strolled down Arab Street. At the conclusion of the week, students spent time at Gardens by the Bay, a showpiece of horticulture and garden artistry, and enjoyed wandering around its the two cooled conservatories: the Flower Dome, that was featuring the Sakura, or cherry blossom trees, and Cloud Forest, that features a lush “Cloud Mountain” clad with the most exotic plant species from around the world and one of the tallest indoor waterfalls. It was an extremely enjoyable way to end the week. Students thoroughly enjoyed their time and experience in Singapore. They learned a great deal about and experienced firsthand the innovation and tech transformation in the region and for China and Singapore more broadly in areas such as fintech, internet services and high-tech smart manufacturing - they were inspired, made good friends, and shared a truly immersive top quality learning experience together.\n\nDuring spring break, 39 students from all four of UCLA Anderson’s MBA programs visited Germany for the in-country week of the CGM’s Germany Global Immersion course, titled: “Berlin the Startup Hub: From Division to Development.” The course, which was led by Nico Voigtlander, professor of global economics and management, familiarized students with Germany’s broader business environment and explored how entrepreneurial activity takes place in the country. This was the second Global Immersion course, taught by Professor Voigtlander. The last time a Global Immersion course focused on Germany was back in 2016.\n\nBerlin’s history resembles a roller coaster. After being one of the world’s cultural centers in the “Golden Twenties,” the city witnessed the darkest period in German history under the Nazi regime (1933-45). After World War II, the city was divided, and the Berlin Wall became the symbol of the Cold War. The city lost most of its industry and saw immense divergence between its East and West. After the fall of the wall, cheap rents and a vibrant atmosphere attracted young creative minds from around the globe. Over the past two decades, Berlin has become one of the biggest startup hubs in the European Union. During the one-week travel component of the course, students had the opportunity to view this unique setting through meetings and presentations from business leaders, founders, academics and entrepreneurs, in addition to visits to many local tech startups. The group heard from founders from GovMind, Minimal VC, Riddle & Code and Bliq, among others. They also visited Taxfix, SumUp, Spectrm, Heartfelt and Cisco, among other organizations, that were important in telling the country’s startup story.\n\nThe inaugural session was hosted at the Berlin campus of ESCP Business School. As a state-recognized university, ESCP counts among the leading business schools in Germany. Goncalo Pina, an associate professor whose teaching and research focuses on international economics and finance, delivered the inaugural lecture. He provided a macro perspective that compared and contrasted Germany’s highly developed social market economy with capitalism, the economic system in the United States, and addressed the business implications. He reviewed Germany’s GDP, unemployment, inflation, property prices and fiscal space since its reunification in 1990 with those of the U.S. and China and shared his observations of the country’s challenges as well as its silver linings. Pina also explored the economy from a micro perspective, describing its key exports and trends in manufacturing, and provided a sense of what it is like to do business in the most populous member state of the European Union, explaining its culture and barriers to entry. Pina described entrepreneurship and the startup ecosystem in Berlin, highlighting the capital’s relatively low rents, good universities and openness to foreigners. The class learned more about its’ strengths, including human capital and good vocational training, large number of patents, high-tech industries and its robust small and medium enterprise sector (Mittlestand) – the hidden champions. As well as its weaknesses, including its old-school entrepreneurial culture, high aversion to risk, relatively small domestic market and stringent data and privacy laws, and a lack of venture capital. Economic security, “derisking,” and the challenge of fostering an innovation economy in Germany were also topics covered by Jakob Hensing, a research fellow at Global Public Policy Institute (GPPi), a Berlin-based independent non-profit think tank. One of GPPi’s main areas of expertise is data and tech policy. Hensing explained that Germany is facing a fundamentally different security and geoeconomic environment than it did a few years ago as a result of many factors, including the Ukraine war, the changing perspective on China, concerns about the future of the transatlantic relationship, global re-alignments in a more “multipolar” world, and the rise of a “derisking” agenda. On critical and emerging technologies, he suggested that Germany’s strategic perspective is still at a nascent stage. Berlin, in particular has gained “buzz” as a hub for digital startups, but only gradual progress has been made on conditions for scaling. Even with the progress in recent years, many challenges still remain, including lack of venture capital, gaps in the EU single market for capital and services, difficulties of recruiting and retaining tech talent, and cultural obstacles. Hensing suggested that many German unicorns are “tech enabled” rather than technology leaders in their own right, and that fostering startup-led innovation in German will require further efforts by public and private actors. Both sessions provided an excellent introduction, context and framing for the students’ time in Berlin.\n\nMany sessions during the week took place at Ahoy Berlin, a coworking space that transformed an old industrial building into a 4,500 square meters hub for innovation. Students had their first opportunity to hear directly from two founders, when Manuel Kilian and Marc Penkala spoke about the investment climate and entrepreneurial scene in Berlin and the EU and provided insights from their own experiences founding and funding startups. Kilian and Penkala complemented much of what students had learned during the first morning about why Berlin is such a good hub for startups. They spoke to the changes in the startup environment over the last five years, including the impact of COVID-19 on the home of one of Europe’s most vibrant tech ecosystems. Manuel Kilian is founder and chief executive officer of GovMind, a Berlin-based technology startup that collects, analyzes and interprets information for the public sector in an effort to ensure that more innovations are used in government and administration. Marc Penkala is managing director and founder of Minimal VC GmbH, a Berlin-based venture capital investment firm. At Heartfelt’s headquarters, later in the week, students were given another opportunity to learn about the venture capital industry, general VC environment in Germany, and why Berlin is such a great place to invest in startups from Teddy Kim, one of the company’s partners. Heartfelt Capital is a Berlin-based early-stage venture capital firm, founded in 2018 that focuses on investments in pre-seed startups from Europe and European founders abroad, often as their first investor. These two sessions were complemented by a session with UCLA Anderson alumnus Eugene Kim ('11), director of SaaS product marketing and strategy at Cisco AppDynamics. Kim, who spoke about Cisco’s innovation strategy and evaluating startups for acquisitions, was involved in several M&As for Cisco in the EU for its business units and responsible for the integration of acquired companies into Cisco. He addressed some of the challenges and risks associated with integration, including culture adaptation. Cisco is a U.S. multinational digital communications technology conglomerate, headquartered in San Jose, California. AppDynamics, powered by Cisco, helps companies see their technology through the lens of the business and delivers full-stack observability that allows organizations to see, understand, and optimize what happens inside and beyond their architecture, aligning teams around shared priorities.\n\nAt Betahaus, one of the best-known coworking spaces in the city, students were fascinated to hear from Torgen Hauschild, co-founder and chief technology officer at Bliq on how the company empowers gig workers in the transport industry (drivers in the on-demand mobility sector) to manage their workflow across multiple platforms. Bliq aggregates incoming jobs from Uber, Bolt, and FreeNow into one mobile app interface for drivers, allowing them to conveniently offer their time to multiple on-demand consumer brands at the same time. The company’s overarching mission is to help drivers make more out of their time and take advantage of the opportunities that the booming on-demand economy has to offer. Over 60,000 drivers are driving with Bliq in more than 400 cities. Hauschild also addressed the recent successful launch in Berlin of Bliq for passengers, allowing passengers to compare prices and book trips. He described the startup process in Germany and the country’s business environment and provided insights into the company’s funding history. Hauschild imparted his knowledge and shared some key learnings over the years relating to product, investors, co-founders, and company phases, and described his own startup and personal journey.\n\nDuring the week, students had many other opportunities to hear firsthand from founders in the tech startup space. John Calian, founder and chief executive officer of Riddle&Code described his journey into blockchain and spoke in depth on blockchain technology and bitcoin. He shared his thoughts on how to create an innovation culture, and how to manage risks and learn from mistakes. Riddle&Code is a software and product-led services company that specializes in onboarding industries to Web3. It offers various solutions to tailor industry-specific hardware wallets and an application suite to build on decentralized blockchains. Students also gained an understanding of the artificial intelligence market in Germany and learned about startups in the space from Max Fuchs, associate partner at Limebit where he consults clients on data management strategies, machine learning, and data-science-related projects. Founded in Berlin in 2016, Limebit is an owner-operated software company that specializes in the development of AI for the medical sector helping pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, research institutions and health insurance companies develop new treatment options. This session was followed and complemented by a presentation from Dimitrios Kapagiannidis, vice president of search automation and growth hacking at HomeToGo. Founded in 2014 (IPO in 2021) and headquartered in Berlin, with a vision to make incredible homes easily accessible to everyone, HomeToGo has since grown to become the SaaS-enabled marketplace offering the world’s largest selection of vacation rentals and helping to solve pain points for both travelers and suppliers in a highly fragmented market. HomeToGo’s AI-powered marketplace enables users to search and compare vacation rental options worldwide and helps travelers find the ideal vacation rental property by seamlessly searching across multiple platforms, such as Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com among others. Kapagiannidis explained how the HomeToGo AI-powered App is the best way to experience its brand. He described the trends in the global travel industry and how online sales channels increasingly dominate revenue in the sector, and explained how HomeToGo is leading AI innovation in the vacation rental space with its AI Mode. Launched in 2023, AI Mode - powered by Generative AI - enables travel planners to describe exactly what they’re looking for and receive highly personalized recommendations, going far beyond what is currently possible with traditional online search. Kapagiannidis addressed the company’s investment timeline and explained how M&A, which will be selective, disciplined and value-accretive, will continue to be an important element of the HomeToGo growth strategy.\n\nGuest speaker sessions during the week were complemented by many exciting company and site visits where students learned more about, and experienced firsthand, Berlin’s startup ecosystem. The first company visit of the week was to the Berlin headquarters of Taxfix, a software fintech company, with unicorn status. Taxfix connects customers with an independent tax advisor, allowing customers to file quick and paperless taxes from anywhere, via app or browser. Taxfix is available for taxpayers in Germany, Italy and Spain. Alexander Beresford, chief growth officer at Taxfix compared and contrasted the process of filing taxes in the U.S. with that in Europe. He explained the data privacy laws and regulations in Europe, the pricing model for the business, the company’s marketing and customer acquisition strategies and described the funding and investors of Taxfix. He also spoke about his own entrepreneurial journey, which provided students with even greater visibility into the country’s startup environment. Later in the week, the group visited the headquarters of SumUp, a global fintech company whose mission is to empower small merchants around the world. SumUp is driven by the purpose of leveling the playing field for small businesses and provides small business owners with access to financial services and easy-to-use payment solutions that they may traditionally be considered too small for by banks and traditional payment providers. Founded in Berlin in 2012, today, over 4 million merchants in over 36 markets around the world use SumUp to accept cashless payments. From taking payments and processing orders, to customer acquisition and managing money, SumUp has a variety of product offerings. During the visit, students gained an enhanced understanding of the fintech industry in the EU and Germany, and the rise of alternative payment methods post COVID-19. With fierce competition in the small-to-medium-sized businesses space, it’s a challenging industry in which to operate. Federico Negro and Pawlin Marwah from SumUp explained how the company started expanding is product offerings to help mitigate some of the challenges. They described SumUp’s product ecosystem and its journey over the years, including its global expansion, M&As and its various product launches. SumUp has been continuously adapting and evolving and today employs AI for the benefit of both merchants and SumUppers. A visit to the headquarters of Spectrm provided students with additional insights into Berlin’s dynamic tech startup community. Founded in 2015, Spectrm is a conversational marketing automation platform that helps businesses automate one to one conversations with consumers on social messaging channels, and increase customer conversion and revenue. Consumer marketers use Spectrm to engage and convert customers with AI chatbots on popular messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Messenger. Max Koziolek, co-founder of Spectrm spoke about the company’s journey, how it had to pivot along the way, and shared his thoughts on how the company will adapt to, and leverage breakthroughs in, AI technologies to help the startup strengthen its position in the industry.\n\nDuring the week, students also had the opportunity to visit Berlin TXL, on the site of the former Tegel Airport. Located on the outskirts of Berlin, the site is being rebuilt and repurposed. Berlin TXL – Urban Tech Republic, one of Berlin’s most important economic and infrastructure projects for the next 20 years - a smart city - is being created from repurposing the airport buildings and adjacent areas. The site, approximately 500 acres, dedicated to research, innovation and technology, has been designed as a climate-friendly community full of sustainable technologies, with integrated university campus and innovation hubs to propel these technologies into the future. The site will focus on six topics: mobility, energy, materials, water, recyclable materials, and information and communication technology (ICT). It is intended to be a home for the next generation of innovators and where start-ups meet investors. This was an excellent example of how Berlin is constantly changing and a demonstration of how new ideas and concepts are emerging everywhere in and around the city.\n\nStudents thoroughly enjoyed their time and experience in Germany’s capital city. In addition to the business visits and discussions, students also visited some of the sites of Berlin to better understand the history of the city and country. Reminders of the city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War, its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification. Students visited Checkpoint Charlie, the best-known Berlin Wall crossing point between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War, walked around Museum Island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and enjoyed the city’s beautiful architecture. The group also visited Schloss Charlottenburg, a Baroque palace built at the end of the 17th century and was greatly expanded during the 18th century. During the Second World War, the palace was badly damaged but has since been reconstructed. Once a royal summer residence, the palace with its gardens is a major tourist attraction. Students also got to experience some of Berlin’s art scene, enjoy traditional Bavarian food, network with local-based alumni, and successfully navigate the Berlin U-Bahn, the city’s rapid transit system, while enjoying their time experiencing the vibrant startup scene in one of Europe’s top startup hubs.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 20, 2024, UCLA Anderson honored Ed Bastian, chief executive officer of Delta Air Lines with the John Wooden Global Leadership Award, at a gala dinner held at the Beverly Wilshire in Los Angeles. First presented in 2008, the award is named for legendary UCLA basketball coach, author, and leadership expert John Wooden (1910–2010). It is given each year to an exceptional business leader whose leadership style and service to the community reflect the high standards of performance, integrity, and ethical values for which Wooden was known. The recognition was last bestowed to Brian Cornell (B.A. ’81, CERT. ’91), board chairman and chief executive officer of Target.\n\nAs the most successful coach in U.S. men's college basketball history, John Wooden left a legacy of leadership that transcends athletics and spans generations. As a legendary coach, prolific author, and inspiring speaker, he dedicated his life to motivating individuals to achieve their highest potential. Wooden instilled in others a sense of pride, a commitment to ethics and a respect for teamwork. These fundamental principles translate seamlessly from the sports arena to the realms of business, management and leadership. And they provide the cornerstone on which the John Wooden Global Leadership Program is built at UCLA Anderson.\n\nThe 2023 John Wooden Global Leadership Award honored a corporate leader who personifies the ideals of achievement, principle and character associated with Coach John Wooden. Coach created the timeless, inimitable blueprint for achieving success in sports, business and life: The Pyramid of Success. It connects ethics, team spirit, skill, hard work, loyalty, competitive greatness and many more attributes in a unique way and has served as a map for many contemporary leaders. Coach Wooden stands in the record books for winning seven NCAA titles in a row and 10 in 12 seasons. For his leadership, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004. UCLA Anderson embraces the principles of character-based leadership taught by Coach, and gives the award each year to a global influencer who will ensure that his tenets live on and inspire millions of people.\n\nBastian was chosen as the 2023 Wooden Award recipient in recognition of his visionary leadership of the nation’s oldest continuously operating airline. In his many leadership roles at Delta over the past 25 years, Bastian has helped steer the company through the most challenging periods of its history, building confidence and community among its 100,000 employees. During his tenure as CEO, Delta has become the world's most awarded airline.\n\nUCLA Anderson Dean Tony Bernardo opened the evening's festivities, alongside Caroline W. Nahas (B.A. ’70), Korn Ferry senior advisor and chair of the UCLA Anderson Board of Advisors. In bringing Bastian to the stage to be recognized, Bernardo said that the Delta leader's many achievements and awards told just part of the story of his distinguished career. \"During his tenure, Ed has guided Delta's employees through some of the most intensely challenging periods of the company's history, including 9/11, bankruptcy and the COVID-19 pandemic. Tonight, we honor him not only for all he has done as a leader, but how he has done it. Throughout, he has put people first — setting up profit sharing, swearing off job cuts or furloughs, championing equality and safeguarding employee and customer health and well-being,\" Bernardo said. \"Like Coach, Ed is team-centered and purpose-driven. He is a true champion of Delta's shared values of honesty, integrity, respect, perseverance and servant leadership.\"\n\nAt the banquet, 2021 Wooden Award recipient Kenneth C. Frazier engaged Bastian in an on-stage conversation about leadership, values and the Wooden legacy. Frazier is chairman of health assurance initiatives at General Catalyst and former CEO and executive chairman of Merck & Co. He has described Bastian as \"a true exemplar of what it means to be a visionary, resilient, purpose-driven leader.\" Frazier asked Bastian to list his core leadership values. \"Integrity, accountability, resilience, care — caring for other people, our customers — and servant leadership, putting yourself at the bottom of the pyramid,\" said Bastian. He described values as \"the fabric that holds companies together, through good times and challenging times.\" Frazier paid tribute to Bastian by calling him \"an active and vocal champion\" of diversity, equity and inclusion. Bastian explained his commitment to inclusivity and giving employees incentives as well as a sense of security. \"If you can't bring your best self to work, you can't bring your best service to work. If you have a platform of winning together, people will come with you.\"\n\nIn accepting the John Wooden Global Leadership Award, Bastian said, \"I am humbled, and I'm honored to accept something in Coach Wooden's name.\" He recounted how proud his father was when Wooden's UCLA team took on St. Bonaventure — the alma mater of both Bastians — in a basketball game. Bastian recalled that Wooden's Bruins won the game and that his father considered it an honor to merely compete with the great coach's team.\n\nA tribute to John Wooden began the program and featured the remarks of former NBA point guard Earl Watson (B.A. '19), who earned first team all-conference during his decorated UCLA basketball career. Watson, a longtime devotee of Coach Wooden's leadership philosophy, said that in his many conversations with Coach Wooden, his mentor stressed four essential qualities: love, imagination, skill and will. Following Watson's remarks, Coach Wooden's grandson Greg Wooden spoke on behalf of his family. The younger Wooden recalled how his grandfather once received a standing ovation from a roomful of Anderson students, a moment that influenced his decision to endorse a leadership award honoring Coach's legacy. \"What we realized that day in that auditorium, is that my Papa's lessons on leadership transcended the basketball court, and even the athletic arena,\" Greg Wooden said. \"Integrity, honesty, passion and teamwork were equally relevant in the world of management. We also realized that recognizing business leaders who emphasized character-based leadership was very important.\"\n\nAs CEO of Delta Air Lines, Ed Bastian leads 100,000 global professionals who are building the world’s premier international airline, powered by a people-driven, customer-focused culture and spirit of innovation. A 25-year Delta veteran, Bastian has been a critical leader in Delta’s long-term strategy and champion of putting Delta’s shared values of honesty, integrity, respect, perseverance, and servant leadership at the core of every decision. Since being named Delta's CEO in May 2016, Bastian has expanded Delta's leading position as the world's most reliable airline while growing its global footprint and enhancing the customer experience in the air and on the ground. Bastian's values-based leadership propelled the airline to become the industry leader and a trusted global brand, guided by empathy, humanity, and devotion to service, which has served Delta well in good times and bad.\n\nThe audience of over 500 included UCLA Anderson Board of Advisors members and other generous supporters, along with members of Coach Wooden’s family, members of the Anderson family joined current and past Wooden Fellows, UCLA Anderson students, alumni, faculty and senior leadership from across the UCLA campus for the ceremony. Net proceeds from the annual event support fellowships for UCLA Anderson students who embody Coach Wooden’s leadership ideals and commitment to improving the lives of others.\n\nDuring the ceremony, the four 2023 fellowship recipients were recognized and awarded the John Wooden Global Leadership Fellowship, which is among the most prestigious honors Anderson students can receive. The 2023 John Wooden Global Leadership Fellows include: Andy Cofino (FEMBA ’25), assistant vice president of diversity, belonging and well-being at Princeton University; Ryan Hayes (EMBA ’24), captain in the U.S. Navy; Tiffany Lin (FEMBA ’24), senior solution engineer, enterprise communications and media at Salesforce; and Juhie Rathor (FTMBA ’24), president of the Anderson Student Association Each of the four 2023 John Wooden Global Leadership Fellows will receive a $35,000 fellowship.

The course was taught by Romain Wacziarg, Hans Hufschmid Chair in Management and professor of economics. This was the seventh global immersion course to focus on and visit India, and the third time that a course visited Mumbai and Hyderabad. The last time was in December 2022.\n\nSince experiencing a severe balance of payments crisis in 1991, India has engaged in several waves of economic reforms that have resulted in high rates of growth over the last 30 years. Aided by strong fundamentals such as a democratic political system, a vast and youthful population, a culture of entrepreneurship and a large cohort of well-trained engineers and scientists, India is emerging as one of the major economic powerhouses of the 21st Century. Yet challenges remain. The course explored both the risks and opportunities offered by the Indian market for foreign investors and domestic entrepreneurs alike, and provided students with a general understanding of the business environment of India and specificities of the market and non-market environments of business in the country, as well as the risks and opportunities afforded by the Indian market to global investors and business actors. The course provided detailed knowledge of critical sectors of the Indian economy, namely finance, entertainment, high technology and biotech/ healthcare. The sessions in India featured meetings with business leaders and entrepreneurs, including UCLA alumni, academics, and relevant members of the civil society. Due to the destination cities being centers of finance and entertainment (Mumbai) as well as tech and biotech (Hyderabad), these sectors were also the subject of some emphasis during the in-country week. The time in India also included visits to places of historical significance and cultural importance.\n\nWhile in Mumbai, the group was exposed to a wide range of sessions that covered the full spectrum of financial services and access. Students learned about microfinance, its history and current landscape in India from Vineet Chattree, managing director of Svatantra Microfin Pvt. Ltd. Svatantra is a microfinance institution that helps its women customers in rural villages become economically self-sustainable by providing micro-loans. Chattree described the financial landscape in India, the evolution of the microfinancing sector, and the importance of financial inclusion in the country. On a more macro level, students visited the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Headquartered in Mumbai, the RBI is the country’s central bank, responsible for India’s monetary policy, and charged with regulating the country’s currency and credit systems. It also manages the country's main payment systems and works to promote its economic development and create financial stability. Students heard from some of the RBI’s senior staff members, including high-level representatives from the departments of economic and policy research, regulation, monetary policy, and fintech. They learned about India’s monetary policy and financial regulations, the modernization of the country’s financial infrastructure, policy making, technological advances and the progress made towards payments and access to finance.\n\nStudents had an opportunity to hear from Navneet Munot, managing director and chief executive officer of the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Asset Management Co. Ltd, a publicly owned investment management firm that serves customers in India, and offers portfolio management and advisory services to individuals, institutions, trusts, private funds, charitable organizations, and investment companies. The mission of HDFC is to be the wealth creator for every Indian. Munot spoke about the asset management business and described the trends and growth in India’s mutual fund business and future opportunities for the industry in the country. He also shared some important economic and demographic data and trends, highlighting the digitization of India and how it is transforming existing industries and creating new markets and specifically how technology is changing the banking landscape. Students visited Axis Bank, the third largest private sector bank in India that offers the entire spectrum of financial services for both personal and corporate banking, to learn about its strategy, new initiatives, and talent management. The group also had an opportunity to visit the headquarters of fintech company Upstox. Founded in 2009, Upstox is one of India’s fastest growing online investment platforms that provides securities brokerage and stock trading services with a goal to disrupt the brokerage industry by drastically bringing down costs associated with online stock trading. The company’s vision is to create a world where everyone has financial security without barriers and is financially literate and empowered, reducing the wealth gap and increasing the GDP per capita. Students heard from the company’s three founders, Ravi Kumar, Kavintha Subramanian and Shrini Viswanath. They shared their personal journeys, spoke about the history behind Upstox from its humble beginnings all the way to becoming one of India’s largest trading platforms, the challenges and opportunities for the company along the way, and future aspirations.\n\nOn the entertainment side while in Mumbai, students visited the headquarters of Jio Creative Labs. The company, which works with numerous Bollywood celebrities and is the advertising and communication arm of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, functions as a strategic business unit and was established with the vision of becoming the new-age creative agency to service the ever-evolving needs of brands. Aditya V. Bhat, head of Jio Creative Labs spoke about the media and entertainment landscape in India and the role of advertising and branding in the sector. He discussed the importance of establishing and building a brand and spoke about some of the company’s different campaigns and advertising methods which include mainline advertising, digital advertising, social media management, influencer outreach and tech-driven content. Bhat also addressed some of the innovations now taking place with artificial intelligence. Students learned about consumer behavior too. Following the session and to continue with the entertainment theme, students visited the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre (NMACC), founded by Nita Ambani, philanthropist and chairperson of the Reliance Foundation). Located in the Jio World Centre complex, the NMACC, which opened in 2023, is a performing arts and multi-disciplinary cultural and exhibition space with programming ranging from large-scale global and Indian productions to community-based programming, spoken word events, comedy shows, educational initiatives and workshops for children. The Centre includes a number of spaces, such as the Grand Theatre, a 2000-seat space across three levels that hosts major traveling productions. During the visit, the NMACC was hosting Mamma Mia! The Centre also hosts prominent public art installations. Students were welcomed by Yogesh Manwani (’19), head of marketing for Reliance Industries Ltd. and learned about NMACC’s aim to preserve and promote India’s rich art, culture and heritage through varied art forms.\n\nIn Mumbai, the group also enjoyed a visit to Yash Raj Films, one of the biggest film production and distribution companies in India that predominantly produces and distributes Hindi films. It is the only privately held and fully integrated studio in India producing and having produced over 80 films. Akshaye Widhani, chief executive officer, led a Q&A session which was greatly appreciated by the group. He spoke about the company’s evolution, sourcing of content, marketing strategies, representation in film, and the introduction of artificial intelligence. Vijay Daya, head of sound also spoke about the importance of music in Bollywood films. Students were taken on a tour of the sound studio, had the opportunity to see the dressing rooms of some of Bollywood’s stars, and learned about the process and evolution of set design.\n\nIn Mumbai, to complement the visits and presentations, students enjoyed a panel discussion at the historic Royal Bombay Yacht Club where various industry leaders, including UCLA Anderson alumni, talked about the Indian economy and its growth prospects and environment for entrepreneurs from their own industry and personal perspectives. Panelists included UCLA Anderson alumnus Abhishek Agarwal (’10), co-founder and chief executive officer of CreditVidya, a big data underwriting platform and a leading player in the alternative credit scoring space in India that leverages alternative data, AI and machine learning to facilitate institutional credit for the underserved. Later in the week, the group visited CreditVidya in Hyderabad. Agarwal was joined on the panel by Jehil Thakkar (’98), partner and media and entertainment sector leader for Deloitte India and Vikas Choudhary, partner at Pivot Ventures, a leading multi-family office focused on alternative investments in India, and former president of Jio, an Indian telecommunications company. The panel was moderated by Professor Romain Wacziarg. A networking event followed. Alumni from UCLA Anderson’s full-time and fully employed MBA and PGPX programs joined the evening. Recent full-time MBA admits also attended.\n\nLater in the week, the group flew to Hyderabad where the focus of the sessions was centered around health care, biotech and technology. At Dr. Reddy’s Labs, students heard from Deepak Sara, the chief executive officer of active pharmaceuticals ingredients (API) and services, who provided an overview on the health care sector globally and described some key health care parameters and India’s contribution to global health care. He spoke about the evolution of Dr. Reddy’s Labs, an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company, headquartered in Hyderabad, which manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. He explained how the company, which serves over half a billion patients worldwide, leverages its research and development expertise, end-to-end manufacturing knowledge and progressive digital technology to accelerate and provide access to affordable and innovative medicines and health care solutions. He also described the company’s sustainability goals and commitment to environmental stewardship. Students were taken on a tour of Dr. Reddy’s campus and its research and lab spaces.\n\nStudents also visited the LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), a World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Prevention of Blindness, and comprehensive eye health facility. With more than 280 eye-care centers in India, LVPEI’s mission is to provide equitable and quality eye care to all sections of society. In 1987, LVPEI was established in Hyderabad by Dr. Gullapalli Nageswara Rao, an academic ophthalmologist, with a generous contribution by L.V. Prasad, an Indian film producer, actor, director and businessman. LVPEI is managed by two not-for-profit entities - Hyderabad Eye Institute (HEI) and Hyderabad Eye Research Foundation (HERF) and has ten active arms to its areas of operations, including clinical services, education, research, vision rehabilitation, rural and community eye health, eye banking, advocacy and policy planning, capacity building, innovation and product development. Students received a fascinating tour of the facility and observed the waiting area, treatment area and the rehabilitation center while learning more about LVPEI’s tiered payment model that ensures equitable quality of services to all patients, irrespective of their socio-economic status.\n\nOne afternoon, the Indian School of Business (ISB) hosted the group at its Hyderabad campus. Students received a fascinating presentation by Anjal Prakash, clinical associate professor and research director of ISB’s Bharti Institute of Public Policy who spoke about sustainability and climate change: a view from the global south, and the growing threat of climate change in India. Students visited the I-Venture@ ISB to learn about India’s tech start-up scene and ecosystem, and the role of I-Venture@ISB from Professor Bhagwan Chowdhry, faculty director of I-Venture and professor emeritus of finance at UCLA Anderson. I-Venture@ISB fosters entrepreneurship and nurtures start-ups and has programs that cater to entrepreneurs and ventures at all stages. The group heard how it is constantly working towards creating a strong ecosystem of mentors, VCs and academicians to ensure the startup’s reach to market and their growth. The group heard from the founders of two start-up companies: Centella AI therapeutics, an AI-driven drug discovery company and XMachines, a robotics and AI company that was founded to bridge the technology gap in Indian agriculture.\n\nDuring their time in Hyderabad, the group had the opportunity to hear from Chandra Balani, head of global enterprise at Amazon Web Services (AWS) India, and learn about Amazon’s history in India, its culture of innovation in the context of India, and local expansion of AWS. Students were also hosted at CreditVidya by Abhishek Agarwal (’10), its co-founder who they met earlier in the week in Mumbai. They met with members of the leadership team of CreditVidya, including both Agarwal and Pochadri Ariga, president of technology. Students were fascinated to learn more about how CreditVidya accelerates financial inclusion in India and leverages alternative data, AI and machine learning to facilitate institutional credit for the underserved. Agarwal and Ariga were joined by members from the leadership team at CRED, an Indian multinational fintech company that recently acquired CreditVidya. CRED is a credit card bill payment platform that rewards its members for their timely credit card payments and allows users to manage multiple cards along with an analysis of their credit score.\n\nDuring the week, students also got to experience the culture, cuisine and sights of India and learn about its history. In Mumbai, they visited the Colaba and Fort areas, and had the opportunity to see the iconic Gateway of India, erected to commemorate the landing of the United Kingdom’s King George V, for his coronation as Emperor of India in 1911, and other landmarks such as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, a historic railway terminus and UNESCO World Heritage Site, Flora Fountain, an ornamentally sculpted architectural monument depicting the Roman goddess Flora, and the High Court of Bombay, one of the oldest high courts in India. In Hyderabad, the group enjoyed a fine-dining experience at the Jewel of Nizam in the Golkonda Hotel located at the foot of Banjara Hills. At the conclusion of the week, some students headed home for the holidays, while other students remained in India to explore other parts of the world’s most populous country.\n\nDuring winter break, 40 students from three of UCLA Anderson’s MBA programs visited Havana, Cuba for the in-country week of the CGM’s first Global Immersion course to focus on and visit the island country. The course, titled: “Cuba: An Economy in Transition,” was taught by Gonzalo Freixes, associate dean of the fully employed and executive MBA programs and adjunct professor of accounting. Freixes is a native Cuban who immigrated to the United States with his parents in the early 1960s as refugees of the communist regime in the country.\n\nThis course looked at Cuba’s history and economy both before and after the Castro brothers assumed power in 1959. The Cuban Revolution of 1959 led to the establishment of a traditional communist economy in Cuba in the early 1960’s. Following a Soviet model, Cuba seized most major landholdings from its foreign or domestic owners, promulgated a centralized economy, abolished private ownership, and strictly controlled any kind of private enterprise. These reforms led to a mass migration of many in Cuba’s upper and middle classes, and the retaliatory imposition of an economic embargo by the United States. Cuba’s economy struggled due to these factors and relied on sizable subsidies from the Soviet Union to maintain itself economically. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia, P.R. China, Vietnam and other communist nations charted a different economic path, embracing private enterprise for economic gain. Cuba resisted these changes until after Fidel Castro stepped down from power in 2008. Thereafter, Cuba slowly adopted limited free market reforms, leading to a new 2018 constitution that recognized private ownership and foreign direct investment for the first time since 1959. Two trends emerged from this economic path: (1) The proliferation of small to medium size businesses across the island, and (2) government partnerships with foreign companies to develop Cuban industries, such as tourism, agriculture (tobacco, sugar), distilled spirits (rum) and mining. These initiatives have accelerated since Raul Castro stepped down as the country’s president in 2018. In pre-travel classes, students discussed the successes and failures of the Cuban Revolution, analyzed the trajectory of economic reforms in recent years, learned about Cuba’s rich culture, and gained an understanding of the impact of the Cuban diaspora on the United States. The week in Havana featured business visits and speakers in the energy, mining, agriculture, tobacco, rum, hospitality and tourism industries, while also educating students on the country’s health care system, government initiatives for small businesses, and the rich ancestry of Cuba’s population. The group also visited the countryside.\n\nFor the inaugural session, students heard from Matias Barcena, finance manager at Petro Australis Energy and former finance manager – oil, gas, and power at Sherritt International Corporation who spoke about foreign investment in Cuba's energy sector. “Sherritt goes to Cuba” was an assigned case for the course so students had good familiarity with the company. Barcena provided a helpful overview and described Cuba as a largely centrally planned economy dominated by state-run enterprises overseen by the Cuban government. Since 2011, he explained that the government has taken several measures to update the economic model. While Cuba is moving to a mixed economy, it is still recovering from the pandemic, U.S. sanctions, monetary instability, as well as the cost of repairs and recovery from the 2022 deadly fire at a large oil storage facility in Matanzas, and Hurricane Ian. Sherritt International has been the largest foreign investor in Cuba's energy sector over the last 30 years with investments in nickel and cobalt, oil and gas, and power. Barcena spoke about the renewable energy sector and explained how concerns over Cuba's dependence on oil imports are translating into the need for a fundamentally redesigned energy sector and more flexibility for investors. The pandemic also accentuated Cuba's need to diversify and move from oil-generated energy to renewable energy sources.\n\nStudents also learned from professors during the week. Luis Rene Fernandez Tabío, professor and researcher at the University of Havana’s International Economics Research Center, delivered a presentation focused on Cuba’s economic challenges for international inclusion. He addressed the adverse world economic context for the inclusion of Cuba in the global economy; how the Cuban economic situation is in the middle of a complex process of reforms; and the reinforcement of a U.S. economic and financial blockade of Cuba with the Trump and Biden policy of “maximum pressure.” He explained that in absolute terms, the blockade has adversely affected every sector of Cuba’s economy and the growth of the economy is in a very bad situation right now. The group also heard from Jorge Mario Sanchez, professor of the Center for Research in International Economics at the University of Havana. He spoke about the transformation of the Cuban economy and society, the country’s development challenges, its economic profile and current reforms. Since Fidel Castro’s ascent to power in 1959, there has been a long U.S. embargo and persistent hostilities. While the diplomatic relationship thawed under President Barack Obama, many restrictions have since been renewed. Cuba is currently dealing with inflation and economic contraction and many Cubans have been facing extreme shortages in food, medicine, fuel and power for the past few years. Sanchez spoke about U.S.-Cuba relations and provided a brief historical background. He discussed the legal framework and domestic and international implications. These two sessions were extremely helpful in providing context and a foundation for the week and represented valuable learnings for the class.\n\nSome sessions also took place at the University of Havana, a public university located in the Vedado district of Havana. Founded on January 5, 1728, the university is the oldest in Cuba, and one of the first to be founded in the Americas. On the campus, students heard from Gerado Rodriguez Fuente, professor and researcher at the University’s Institute of Material Science and Technology, scientific consultant to International Zeolite Corp. (a Canadian-based company that operates as a mineral exploration company that covers the complete value chain from zeolite production and supply to direct consumer capabilities), and creator of NEREA Technology. He spoke about natural zeolite engineering and the development of new materials and utilization of technologies. Cuba has major reserves of zeolite, a mineral whose properties and uses in products and technologies contribute to protecting the environment. Currently, zeolites are widely used in various fields of the Cuban economy. Ana Maria Galvez, head of the department of health economics of the National School of Public Health in Cuba, addressed in detail Cuba’s national health system: its history, development, and results, and compared the major differences between the situation in 1959 when life expectancy at birth was under 60 years of age to present day when life expectancy at birth is 77.7 years (2022). She shared that Article 72 of the Cuban Constitution notes that everyone has the right to be healthy, attended to and protected, and that the state guarantees access to and quality of health care at no cost to the population. Galvez also spoke about the principles of Cuba’s public health system, the various levels of health care, how primary health care is organized and the main features of the Cuban model. She also explained the main changes in the Cuban economy over the last ten years, described its current complex economic conditions, and the challenges to ongoing transformation in the sector. Students were also taken on a guided walking tour of the campus.\n\nThe tourism and hospitality sector is a key pillar of the Cuban economy, and one where foreign MNCs operate, in partnership with State-owned companies to provide their services. At the University of Havana’s Faculty of Tourism, Alejandro Delgado Castro, vice chancellor and former dean spoke about tourism in Cuba. He shared some general facts about the island country, which has over 6,000 km of coastline, and reviewed its tourist regions. He also discussed destination brands, and explained how the tourism market is dominated by Canadians who make up over 26% of tourist traffic. Castro described how occupancy rates have dropped considerably in recent years and addressed some of the challenges facing the sector, including the ongoing fuel crisis and the U.S. embargo which restricts significant American visitors. Alberto Alfredo Matos, managing director of the Grand Aston La Habana later explained the different approaches in Cuba, for example a joint venture with the government or a management agreement. Grand Aston La Habana is part of the Archipelago International Group, Southeast Asia's largest privately-owned hotel management group. Matos spoke about Archipelago's main competition in Cuba, its growing portfolio on the island nation and expansion plans. New and important tourist markets for Cuba are Russia, Turkey, and Asia, including China.\n\nAt Loft Havana, a B&B, located in the center of Old Havana, students experienced Afro-Cuban traditions and cultural richness. They were greeted by rhythmic beats of drums while observing dance performances by artists adorned in colorful orisha costumes. This experience left the group with a deep appreciation for the cultural heritage of Cuba and the passion that fuels the Beyond Roots initiative, a venture focused on promoting Afro-Cuban culture from different perspectives, including organizing Afro-Cuban experiences that educate people who visit Cuba about Afro-Cuban heritage, traditions and culture. Students had an opportunity to hear from inspiring young Cuban women entrepreneurs who are trailblazers of entrepreneurship in the country. They discussed their respective startups, shared the unique stories behind their respective organizations and talked about the opportunities in Cuba’s unexplored marketplace. They also addressed some of the challenges they have faced along the way and how they have navigated these challenges, especially related to scaling and access to raw materials and financing. Professor Freixes moderated the panel discussion with Adriana Heredia, co-founder of the Beyond Roots Project (promoting Afro-Cuban culture); Ilse Anton Rodriguez, co-founder and Mabel Musa Acosta, marketing coordinator of Dador (a Cuban fashion and lifestyle brand); and Cintia Nuñez, founder of Agua de Marzo (a Cuban venture that designs, customizes and manufactures hair accessories).\n\nThe Cuban sugar economy is the principal agricultural economy in Cuba. The students visited the National Training Center of the Sugar Enterprises Group of Cuba (AZCUBA) where they heard from Raul Sabadi, director, engineering division of the Cuban Research Institute on Sugarcane Derivatives (ICIDCA), which is under the aegis of AZCUBA. AZCUBA is the state-run sugar agroindustry business group, that replaced the Ministry of Sugar in 2011. AZCUBA is in charge of directing and controlling the entities that make up the sugar agroindustry for the development of the production of sugars, electric energy, sugarcane derivatives and food for human consumption and agriculture. Sabadi spoke about the Cuban sugar agroindustry and its importance to Cuba, and all the various sugarcane derivatives. He described the importance of the bio-circular economy of sugar cane and explained how today, the sector is highly vulnerable to climate change. Students were also taken on a guided tour of the training center and learned more about the history of the sugar cane industry in Cuba and its importance to Cuba’s culture and identity. Students were also excited to visit the Havana Club (Pernod-Ricard) San Jose rum factory, a state-of-the-art distillery that produces dark rums. Havana Club is a brand of rum that was created in Cuba in 1934. Originally produced in Cárdenas, Cuba, by family-owned José Arechabala S.A., the brand was nationalized after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. In 1993, French-owned Pernod Ricard and the government of Cuba created a state-run 50:50 joint venture called Corporación Cuba Ron. They began exporting this version of Havana Club globally, except to the United States due to the embargo. Students learned about its successful strategic alliance with Pernod Ricard, and its progress and development over the last thirty years. Rum is a very important part of Cuban culture and traditions, and there are many specific regulations around how rum should be made. A rum master led the group on a walking tour of the distillery, where they heard about the aging process in the white oak barrels, and the "
