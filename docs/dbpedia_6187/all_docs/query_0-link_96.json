At the height of the AIDS epidemic, Brent refused to watch his friends suffer due to government inaction and public ignorance about the disease.\n\nHis audacious response in 1986, was to embark on a 10,000-mile run around the perimeter of the United States to draw attention to the toll AIDS had taken on his community; to comfort patients, raise funds for local organizations and honor the friends he had lost. He performed this remarkable feat amid public backlash, a homophobic media blackout, his own health challenges, and an inconvenient lack of prior long-distance training. After enduring blisters, exhaustion, ignorance, and fear, he returns home to a life of activism. Though the run finishes, Brent’s fight never stops.\n\nYour web browser is not supported\n\nPhoto: Brent Nicholson Earle • Photo provided by APT\n\nTells the story of Bob Coomber, an intrepid adventurer who sets out to become the first wheelchair hiker to cross the 11,845 foot Kearsarge Pass in the Sierra Nevada of California.\n\n4 Wheel Bob airs Thursday, June 13 at 5 p.m. on WXXI-TV.\n\nThe one-hour documentary follows the inspirational journey of Bob while encouraging us to look at our own self-imposed limitations and perhaps reach beyond what we think is possible.\n\nThis film is presented as part of Move to Include™ , a national initiative in partnership with WXXI and The Golisano Foundation that uses the power of public media to promote inclusion.
