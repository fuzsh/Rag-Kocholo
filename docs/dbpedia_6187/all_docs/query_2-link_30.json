        "text": "If you are a regular reader, you probably think that I’m a big planner and that I have my whole life and business mapped out for me.\n\nNot so.\n\nI love planning! But like many creative entrepreneurs, I find planning can be confining.\n\nA Time for Planning\n\nPlanning has its place in any business.\n\nI believe in strategizing an income plan. I believe in planning my months, weeks, and days based on my income plan and big-picture ideas.\n\nBut there is no such thing as a fool-proof plan. I believe in planning a little and then taking a lot of action.\n\nThe As-Soon-As Plan\n\nI’ve seen many of my students and clients paralyzed because they are looking for The Perfect Plan. What they end up with is an “As-Soon-As Plan,” which sounds like this:\n\nAs soon as I find the right business plan to follow, everything will fall into place.\n\nAs soon as I take this class, I’ll know what to do.\n\nAs soon as my kids are old enough, I’ll have more time to work on my art.\n\nAs soon as I add this new section to my plan, I can get started.\n\nIf they just tweak this or that, then they can start taking action.\n\nThis is just delaying. It’s excuse-making, not planning or acting.\n\nThe One-Page Business Plan\n\nOne of my favorite chapter’s in Chris Guillebeau’s The $100 Startup is “The One-Page Business Plan.” In it, Chris says:\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with planning, but you can spend a lifetime making a plan that never turns into action. In the battle between planning and action, action wins.\n\nI agree with the action bias, but you have to take action, not just think about it. You have to act consistently and with purpose if you want to turn your art into a successful business.\n\nYou must have regular studio hours. You must market your art consistently. You must evaluate lack of sales. You must network and meet new people.\n\nStop over-planning and start taking action. Over-planning is killing your art business.\n\nFree Book and Feature to the Best Artist Business Plan\n\nI’ll give away a copy of The $100 Startup (free shipping USPS to anywhere in the world) to what I think is the best artist business plan left in a comment on this post no later than midnight ET on Friday, May 25. Here are the rules:\n\nYour plan must be 200 words or less.\n\nYou must use your real name.\n\nYour plan could be for a specific period (e.g. the next 6-12 months) or for a special project such as an exhibition.\n\nYour plan should include these six areas: 1) your art or product, 2) audience, 3) promotions, 4) money, 5) how you will overcome challenges or obstacles, and 6) how you will know if you’ve succeeded.\n\nFor a framework, you can (but aren’t required to) use Chris’s One-Page Business Plan as featured here.\n\nThis is not a democratic process. My selection is the final word."
