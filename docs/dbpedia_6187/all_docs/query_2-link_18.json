        "text": "Why do you work for BAC?\n\n“I recently came across this quote that perfectly captures my why: ‘The most radical act in a sick society is to heal yourself then gently help others heal too.’ - I believe the arts are the catalyst for this transformational healing and see Brooklyn Arts Council as being a creative conduit and connective tissue of this healing throughout Brooklyn and beyond; supporting this work is exactly where I want to be, where I know I am meant to be, and why I feel so lucky to be part of the incredible BAC team!”\n\nWhat Brooklyn neighborhood(s) do you feel most connected to and why?\n\n“Fort Greene and Clinton Hill have been my home for the past 10 years, and while there have been a few short moments of living elsewhere, I can confidently say there is no other place that has felt like home quite like Brooklyn. My father grew up in Sheepshead Bay after immigrating from Cuba and trips to Brooklyn visiting family from my childhood home just outside of the city are potent memories of my upbringing. Moreover, my parents met and had their first date in Downtown Brooklyn (Junior’s!) and Bensonhurst was their first home together; where I lived for the first 6-months of my life. All that to say, for me, there is truly no other home than Brooklyn!”\n\nBio\n\nMelissa Caballero (she/her) is a Native New Yorker, arts administrator, and operational contriver whose work is anchored in her firm belief that radical introspection of mind, body, and soul are interdependent components vital to reimagining more equitable, prosperous, and healthy communities. She is captivated by the cultural influence that institutional design has in shaping our society and the interconnectedness of community, business, and the arts. Bridging her previous experiences in Media Buying Activation for Proctor and Gamble with Publicis Media and Operations and Client Experience at Barry’s LLC, with her personal experiences as a hospice caretaker and a second-generation immigrant of Cuban descent, she seeks to heed her inner calling to participate in unraveling the social injustices embedded in our society and facilitate collective community healing through the power of the arts. Melissa graduated from Baruch College in December 2022 with an MA in Arts Administration where she subsequently went on to work as the Administrative Assistant at Downtown Brooklyn Arts Alliance. She also holds a BA in Economics from Binghamton University and is a certified Reiki Healer.\n\nWhy do you work for BAC?\n\n“I have always believed in the role the arts has to play in shaping and enriching communities and I have been fortunate to have spent my entire career in public service, seeking out opportunities in which I can support this important work. You will hear me say time and time again, there is nowhere quite like Brooklyn and it is an honor and a privilege to be able to serve the artists and communities of Brooklyn through my role at Brooklyn Arts Council.”\n\nWhat Brooklyn neighborhood(s) do you feel most connected to and why?\n\n“It was love at first sight for this Northern British girl. From my first visit to Brooklyn in 2006, (a very different DUMBO) to moving to Bed Stuy in 2021, this vibrant, energetic, full of life, crazy borough captured a piece of my heart that can never be replaced. It is no coincidence that Brooklyn Arts Council was my first port of call when I arrived from the UK and I will be forever grateful to this borough for the career, community and forever friends it has given me. There really is nowhere quite like Brooklyn!”\n\nBio\n\nEmma Cookson is an arts manager and cultural programmer with over 13 years of experience leading and influencing local, national and international cultural programs and policies. With a BA (First Class Hons) in Drama and English and a Diploma in Leadership & Management, Emma started her career in the British Council's Arts Team, before spending 8 years at an outer London borough arts service where she worked with artists & creative practitioners, community organizations, development agencies and civic leaders to develop and deliver high quality and innovative cultural programs and projects with the aim of increasing and improving access to arts and culture.\n\nUnderpinning all of Emma's work is the belief that arts & culture should be available to everyone. She is committed to advocating for artists & the arts and excited by the role they have to play in improving and enriching people, place and community.\n\nOriginally from the north of England, New York City is one of Emma's lifelong passions. Others include food, travel, books, running and her rescue pup Delilah.\n\nWhy do you work for BAC?\n\n“I work for the BAC because I am inspired by the mission and in the transformative power of the arts to inspire, connect, and uplift communities. The team’s dedication to fostering artistic expression and cultural enrichment resonates deeply with me both personally and professionally. By contributing my skills and passion to BAC, I see myself playing a meaningful role in nurturing Brooklyn's vibrant creative ecosystem and making the arts more accessible to all.”\n\nWhat Brooklyn neighborhood(s) do you feel most connected to and why?\n\n“Maybe a cop-out answer, but all of them! I have a story or experience in just about every corner of Brooklyn that has influenced me so much in life. I grew up around Flatlands and went to schools in Midwood, Park Slope, and Downtown Brooklyn. I also worked in Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and Crown Heights. I have spent time with friends everywhere from East New York, to Dumbo, to Bay Ridge, and to Coney Island. But if I had to pick one, I’d say Flatbush for the culture, vibrancy, and community.”\n\nBio\n\nStanley Delva is an artist and arts administrator who believes deeply in building equitable communities and offering resources to strengthen underserved communities. He is passionate about supporting emerging filmmakers, visual artists, and small businesses through his freelance fundraising work. He has previously worked in Fundraising and Development with arts non profits like Haiti Cultural Exchange, El Museo del Barrio, and Cool Culture. Stanley has been a supporter of getting the arts funded through his grant writing as well as previously serving as a grant panelist for the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA), New York City’s Department for Cultural Affairs (DCLA), the Brooklyn Arts Council (BAC), and the Awesome Foundation New York City’s chapter. A Brooklyn bred, native New Yorker of Haitian descent, Stanley cherishes the Caribbean heritage seen across the city. He has received a Bachelor's degree in English and African American Studies from Brooklyn College and a Master’s degree in Museum Studies from CUNY School of Professional Studies.\n\nWhy do you work for BAC?\n\n“I work for BAC because it is an organization that allocates funds and resources to sustain and empower communities and artists. BAC serves as a crucial entry point to funding pipelines, making a tangible impact on artists and cultural heritage communities. This mission resonates deeply with my commitment to serving artists and cultural heritage, aligning perfectly with my professional goals as a producer and cultural heritage practitioner.”\n\nWhat Brooklyn neighborhood(s) do you feel most connected to and why?\n\n“As for Brooklyn neighborhoods, when I first arrived in the US, I settled in Flatbush, Brooklyn, which felt like the perfect fit as an Afro-Panamanian woman. The vibrant Caribbean culture, people and cuisine made me feel very much l at home. I also spent significant time in Crown Heights, where many Panamanians in NYC reside. Despite gentrification, the Panamanian community's influence remains strong through events like the Panamanian Parade.\n\nAnother neighborhood I feel connected to is South Williamsburg, historically home to a thriving Puerto Rican community. While the area has undergone significant change, I cherish memories of being there for work as a musician and enjoying the vibrant nightlife and cultural scene.\n\nThese neighborhoods have not only shaped my personal experiences but also enriched my understanding of Brooklyn's diverse cultural fabric.”\n\nBio\n\nMai-Elka Prado Gil is the creator of the Afro Latino Festival of New York. The Festival is one of the most genuine and influencing spaces for culture and community in NY.

Her work has been an integral part of the representation and conversation about Afrolatinidad in the US since 2011.\n\nWhy do you work for BAC?\n\n“As a South African that was born during Apartheid, I am driven by the value of the arts to humanity. The arts and creativity are the lifeblood of my country of birth, this can be clearly seen in any form of protest that we employ. I grew up in a household where we didn’t always know what was for dinner, if there was dinner, but our love of music and dance kept us fed and nourished beyond the flesh. There is no way for me to separate myself and what makes life rich from the arts and the contributions of artists. I consider this work part of my calling. Artists give so much in seen and unseen ways, and I consider myself truly fortunate and wealthy for being in a role that allows me to support artists and arts organizations in little and big ways daily. It is an honor.”\n\nWhat Brooklyn neighborhood(s) do you feel most connected to and why?\n\n“Bedstuy – it is the first place I called home when I moved to New York. The memories of braais, gardening in the pocket park, dancing in the street, exchanging music recommendations, giving and receiving care packages are still vivid. The bond I share with those neighbors has remained despite many moves.\n\nBayridge – Brooklyn’s best kept secret.\n\nDumbo – I've always dreamt of having a cozy-chic apartment there.”\n\nBio\n\nDidintle Ntsie, a Project Manager, Arts Administrator, dot-connector, writer and educator, originally hails from Ga-Rankuwa, South Africa.

Having grown up in NYC, with both parents hailing from Brooklyn, my roots are deeply embedded in this vibrant borough. I've also been a visual artist from a very young age and have witnessed, time and time again, the power of the arts to inspire, bring people together, and shape communities. Working for BAC has allowed me to immerse myself in the creative world I love so much, support other artists, and play a part in impacting the creative future of a place I will always call home.\"\n\nWhat Brooklyn neighborhood(s) do you feel most connected to and why?\n\n“Bushwick is the neighborhood I feel most connected to. I love everything about it—the food, the art, the nightlife, the weirdness, the list goes on. Spending time there has also made me cross paths with the most inspiring, driven, supportive, creative, out-of-the-box, people; many of whom now feel more like family than friends.”\n\nBio\n\nMarie Szalkiewicz (she/her) is an arts administrator and artist by way of New York City.

Prospect Park is a beautiful green space that has a strong sense of community. I love participating in local events, farmers' markets, and going to the summer concerts, this all helped fostering a feeling of belonging. One of my fondest memories was finishing up a run in the park to be greeted by one of the goat there to help restore the park woodlands.”\n\nBio\n\nM’Kina Tapscott’s fifteen year career in arts education, access, and curation.
