        "text": "ALLY HUTCHINS HAS SPENT MOST OF HER LIFE behind the bar at 1919. On a Wednesday evening in late October, the 60-year-old Baltimore native stands with her back to the register, taking drink orders from patrons who arrive as soon as the door opens at 5 p.m.\n\n“Hi, Dominic—what can I get for ya?” she shouts to a regular, her gray braid swinging as she lets out a raspy laugh and The Young Rascals’ 1967 “Groovin’” plays softly on the stereo.\n\nBy all accounts, Hutchins is at home here, as her family bought the place and its blue neon sign back in 1984, and she now lives upstairs with her husband, John, and their bull terrier, Sniffy. Usually, though, she’s downstairs, amidst the tchk of beer cans and above the other loose-leashed dogs who mosey in through the alley of this neighborhood hangout, tucked back from busy Fleet Street on the eastern edge of Fells Point. In fact, blink, and you can miss it. Though not once you’re inside.\n\n“Put something up and it never comes down,” she says, looking around the shrine-like walls, where every inch is covered in fading photographs, folk art, bumper stickers, cattle skulls, and Christmas lights that glow year-round—an eclectic patina that reflects the cast of local characters who have made this place their bar.\n\n“We’ve had two deaths here, one wedding, and some people have even told me that they got pregnant because of my drinks,” says Hutchins. “But at the end of the day, it’s just a bar. Sometimes magic happens. Sometimes nothing does.”\n\nOf course, such stardust does not grace every drinking establishment, and bars like 1919 have become an endangered species. Today, we call them dive bars, which was once heard as an insult but is. now an undeniable term of endearment, particularly in these changing times. As longtime owners age out, new developers increasingly move in, leaving a sleek homogeny of high-end cocktail bars and hipsterfied microbreweries in their wake.\n\nDive bars, by contrast, defy definition, ranging in the eye of the beholder from simple, old-school, corner taverns, beloved for their bouffanted barkeeps, to rough-around-the-edges drinking dens, with loud music and dim lighting. Always, they sell affordable drinks and lack most modern amenities. Maybe there’s a jukebox, or a dartboard, and often, a well-worn pool table. The faint whiff of cigarette smoke is commonplace. As is Keno. Don’t expect a website or social media—just know that they close late (or at a last-minute time of their choosing) and a handful still open at sunrise. Night and day, there are regulars, many of whom live within crawling distance.\n\n“People would probably strike if we closed, so we keep going,” says Ana Marie Cushing of Cat’s Eye Pub on Thames Street, even as neighbors like BAR and The Wharf Rat fall like dominoes.\n\nIn Baltimore, neighborhood bars were once a dime a dozen—some straightlaced, some rowdy—with seemingly every block offering a beer and a shot to a mix of shift workers, sailors, artists, newspapermen, and other street-roving souls. In 1968, there were 2,200 liquor licenses to today’s 1,221, and by 1979, Baltimore magazine predicted that, soon enough, “New bars will all look the same, and how a drinker is to tell one hanging-fern/exposed-brick/butcher-block-tabled spot from another escapes [us].” That proved alarmingly prescient. Then the coronavirus pandemic closed even more of these one-of-a-kind haunts for good.\n\n“When one place goes, a little piece of you goes with them,” says Andy Norris, second-generation owner of Bertha’s Mussels, which will shutter on South Broadway this month after 50 years in business. “People come here from other places and find their own families. Which epitomizes Charm City.”\n\nIndeed, these bars are intertwined in Baltimore’s identity—frayed tethers to its underdog spirit and blue-collar roots, crumbling temples of simpler times. Here, conversation conquers digital scrolling, and community is formed over strong-pour communion. At their best, these are everyman spaces—where regardless of age, class, race, or gender, everyone can come together over the Orioles, Utz, and Natty Boh. Though some have undoubtedly opened their arms to outsiders more than others.\n\n“We welcome everybody,” says Ben Franklin, veteran bartender at the Mt. Royal Tavern in Mid-Town Belvedere. “That is, until you become an asshole—then we throw you out.”\n\nNo nonsense. No nostalgia. No irony. No frills. No fuss. Baltimore dives hold the line between the past and future, where behind brick glass and Formstone facades this city can remember where it came from, and, with a good buzz, consider where it wants to go.\n\nAt the very least, we can still pull up a barstool and push the limits of last call just a little bit longer, particularly at watering holes like those featured below.\n\n“This place has given me life,” says Hutchins, noting that her daughter, Zana, who manages 1919’s live-music lineup, hopes to take over the bar one day. By 6 p.m., it’s standing-room only, and no one seems to mind.\n\n“I’ll probably stay until I can’t get up and down the steps anymore,” she says. “Besides, what else am I going to do?”\n\nBUCK FOWLER’S TAVERN\n\nOVERLEA\n\nGoogle might say that Buck’s on Belair Road—pronounced “b’lair” in these parts—is permanently closed. But past northeast Baltimore’s autobody shops and car dealerships, on the literal city-county line, you’ll find this circa-1950 tavern is still kicking, though just barely. Into the ’90s, the family-run, former “stag bar” (aka men only) was a popular hangout for Colts players like Art Donovan and Bruce Laird, but many of its biggest fans have kicked the bucket in recent years. Even so, the Coors Light sign turns on daily at 11 a.m., with WBAL on the TV, a Sun on the oak bartop, and perhaps the city’s best dartboard in the back room. During a recent lunch beer, one local, whom the tenured bartender referred to as “the mayor,” topped off his own tequila and talked about how bustling the place used to be. Take his advice: “If you’re not looking for a lot of wild and crazy excitement, come on down, sit with the old farts, and have a beverage.”\n\nAll In The Family: The second-generation proprietor, Chuck, passed away in 2004, when he was eulogized in The Sun as “the host with the most,” leaving the business to his son-in-law.\n\nCAT’S EYE PUB\n\nFELLS POINT\n\nIf Baltimore had an official honky-tonk, it would be down the cobblestones of Thames Street and up through the turquoise portal of Cat’s Eye Pub. Seven days a week, this Fells Point anchor cranks out a serious roster of live music—from rock-and-roll and blues to funk and jazz by notable local and regional favorites like Nothin’ But Trouble, Sean K. Preston, and Ursula Ricks—luring a rug-cutting crowd, always ready for a good time. Maritime memorabilia nods to the neighborhood’s past, when watering holes like this old faithful were safe harbor for the tugboat captains and visiting sailors of a working waterfront. As fancy hotels, valets, and bouncers move in on the surrounding blocks, Cat’s Eye, circa 1975, keeps the salty-dog flame burning. Pick one of the 35 beers on tap, ogle at the old oil-painting homage to Ireland, and ask for second-generation owner Tony Cushing, who is often behind the bar and ready to pour a round of shots.\n\nLove Letters: After several coats of paint, management has conceded that the bathroom graffiti is a rite of passage. Grab a Sharpie and leave your mark.\n\nFRAZIER’S ON THE AVENUE\n\nHAMPDEN\n\nThere’s a decision that must be made when visiting Frazier’s on 36th Street in the heart of Hampden: to enter the cavernous Cheers-like hall to the left, with its back billiards, compact bar, and shlumpy leather couch amidst a cacophonous swirl of ’80s music and ole Bawlmer odes—Pimlico, Memorial Stadium, Arrow Beer. Or to enter the small, rock-ish side bar to the right, with its single pool table and fading framed posters from the 1979 City Fair. “It’s crazy over there, isn’t it?” said one regular on a Thursday evening, referring to the former as we sidled into a green laminate booth in the latter. The side bar opens at 5 p.m., while service starts at breakfast or lunch with hangover-curing comfort food next door. Both spaces draw a diverse mix of locals for $2.50 happy-hour drafts and a late last call of 2 a.m. Karaoke is over, but trivia now takes place on Tuesday nights.\n\nBack In The Day: Circa 1939, the original Frazier’s used to be located on the now-residential corner of West 33rd Street and Elm Avenue.\n\nIDLE HOUR\n\nRIVERSIDE\n\nOne might not expect to find a corner bar best known for its devotion to Chartreuse on a list of local dives, but next year, Idle Hour turns 20, and all along, the beloved South Baltimore haunt has straddled its good taste with an unpretentious irreverence, making it right at home in the once-working-class neighborhood of Riverside. For certain customers, house pickleback shots are preferred over that signature green liqueur that has been made by French monks since the 1700s (and which this bar was once apparently the top-seller of in the entire United States). On your way in under its tiny tin awning, smack a favorite bumper sticker on the collage-like door, then grab a well-worn stool and listen to the record player spin all night. A few years back, their loyal following helped raise over $50,000 to keep the red lights glowing on Fort Avenue. Here’s to another 20, at least.\n\nRock On: The bar hosts BYO vinyl and DJ nights, with listening sessions currently in collaboration with WYPR’s Essential Tremors radio show.\n\nMARY’S TAVERN\n\nUPPER FELLS POINT\n\nSearching for a dive bar in Upper Fells, you’ll likely walk right by Mary’s on its sleepy corner of Gough Street on your way toward its neighbor, Butts & Betty’s. Don’t come looking for loud music and sticky counters. Instead, owner Jim Poniatowski keeps his pint-size parlor impeccably tidy, and he’s always on call, either in his backroom recliner or at the bar watching technicolor TV shows. Walking inside is like stepping back in time to the bygone days when every Baltimore block had its own standby, tended to by the folks who lived upstairs. We stumbled upon this multi-generation, circa-1959 treasure years ago and have kept it close to the chest ever since, in hopes that it would stay as unchanged as it was that first evening. Red awnings and wood paneling wrap the room in warmth, and cold cans of Boh are served with an itty-bitty beer glass, like the shift drinks of yore.\n\nGreatest Hits: Mary’s has one of the last legit jukeboxes in the city, spinning classics like Elvis and Patsy Cline.\n\nMT. ROYAL TAVERN\n\nMID-TOWN BELVEDERE\n\nIn our eyes, the Mt. Royal Tavern might be the best dive bar not just in Baltimore, but the entire world. In this city, though, it is the ultmate granddad of such institutions, where locals know it as MRT, or even more aptly, the “Dirt Church”—that unorthodox mecca congregating all walks of city life for nights of bacchanalian revelry along its long blue bar and beneath its Sistine Chapel-replica ceiling. “Beware pickpockets and loose women,” one sign warns, though the clientele is largely an amicably inebriated MICA-meets-buccaneer bunch. Follow the red neon sign inside, where cheap beer, hefty shot glasses, and bags of Utz are in stock seven days a week, starting at 10 a.m. Pay your hand-written tabs with cash only and chat up your barkeeps, who are full of colorfully R-rated stories. (The bar once installed a “cuss bucket,” which didn’t last long, of course.) The back smoking alley is a party in its own right, and the real-deal jukebox is one of the best in town, featuring everything from The Misfits to Tom Waits and Howlin’ Wolf.\n\nPen Pals: Ask your bartender for the gift pack: a house postcard to send to someone special and a matchbook that dubs the bar “where art is bullshit and good bullshit is an art.”\n\nVENICE TAVERN\n\nHIGHLANDTOWN\n\nOn the corner of Conkling and Bank streets, a white sign with a giant green arrow points down sidewalk steps to one of the last basement bars in Highlandtown, if not Baltimore. Born when Prohibition was repealed in 1933, Venice Tavern was founded by Italian immigrants Mary and Frank DeSantis, who sold spaghetti and 15-cent beers out of this subterranean lair beneath their own home. Now run by fourth-generation great-grandson, Dominic, the bar’s black-and-white photographs reveal that not much has changed. A portrait of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the patron saint of Repeal Day, still presides over the bar, which is open Monday through Saturday, starting as early as 8 a.m., but now craft beers have been added to the taps, like Diamondback’s Green Machine and Brewer’s Art’s Resurrection. Imbibers range from Gen Z pool players aiming for the corner pocket to blue-collar barflies betting their luck on video slots.\n\nLocal Lore: Baltimore’s boxing history is on full display here, with vintage fliers and a hand-drawn mural celebrating the lightweight achievements of Dominic’s grand-uncle.\n\nANOTHER ROUND\n\nNEW BARS KEEP THE OLD CHARM FLOWING IN BALTIMORE.\n\n29TH STREET TAVERN\n\nREMINGTON\n\nThere was a moment when we foolishly wondered where else we’d go in Remington for a shot of Pikesville Rye and off-key karaoke once the green-and-yellow light shut off for good at Long John’s Pub. But in 2018, Baltimore native Aaron Reinhart eased our worries when he purchased the bar. Sure, the white-label bottles and mic-sung standards might have gone the way of the buffalo (and luckily, the carpet floor, too), but Reinhart kept the old Formstone, and the new neon sign has quickly become a neighborhood beacon, drawing a diverse crowd for affordable drinks—more than 50 offerings in total, from Coors Banquet bottles to Charm City Meadworks’ honey brews—and a sizeable menu of down-home pub fare. On a recent Friday happy hour, every seat was taken at the J-shaped bar.\n\nHeading North: Reinhart also took over Belvedere Square’s old Swallow at the Hollow watering hole back in 2011, and it’s busy as ever today.\n\nMELANIE’S AT GRIFFITH’S TAVERN\n\nHAMPDEN\n\nThere was a collective sigh of dismay among many Hampdenites when it was announced that the neighborhood’s last authentic dive bar, known by locals as “the Ice House,” would be sold. But since reopening in April with a fresh coat of paint, new owners Allison Crowley and Hannah Spangler have made minimal changes to the Hickory Avenue hangout, originally a men-only stag bar and always a mainstay for the neighborhood’s dwindling working-class crowd, though the vibe has certainly evolved. Natty Boh now mingles with natural wine, but, more importantly, the atmosphere has grown increasingly inclusive for younger patrons and the LGBTQ community. On a recent Thursday night, a baby and its beer-sipping parents were down the bar from a gray-haired old-timer fiddling with a pack of Winstons.\n\nFun And Games: Past customers can rejoice in knowing that the Pac-Man and Skee Bowl games live on in the bar’s left corner.\n\nOLD MAJOR\n\nPIGTOWN\n\nA stone’s throw from Carroll Park, this Pigtown corner bar has become a welcome addition to the Southwest Baltimore community since arriving in 2018. The former Cockeyed Cow Saloon got an upgrade under owner Candice Bruno, who has transformed the classic cop hangout on Carey Street into a Black-owned, open-armed meeting place for a medley of neighbors— first, through its rum-based tropical cocktails and Caribbean-themed food menu, then through its recurring events, from yoga classes to board game nights. Still, in true dive fashion, plenty of beers, both ubiquitous and rare, are on offer, plus a house punch that packs a one-two.\n\nLooking Back: Old Major is named for a central character in George Orwell’s seminal Animal Farm, and, of course, the neighborhood’s swine-strewn history, when pigs were once paraded from the nearby B&O rail lines through the streets to local slaughterhouses.\n\nTHE ROYAL BLUE\n\nSTATION NORTH\n\nRandy Coffren and Rich Pugh know how to open a Baltimore bar. From their flagship Johnny Rad’s on the Fells-Canton border to its sister Snake Hill in Highlandtown, the duo strikes the right chord in creating hip hangouts that are suffused with the city’s scrappy soul. At their new digs on Maryland Avenue, the old Gallery One bartop has been updated with punk concert bills from the late Charm City Art Space venue, located next door, and the genre’s heyday gets a hat tip throughout, from ’70s-inspired décor to a disco-balled dance floor for late-night debauchery. Order a Narragansett tallboy and the slam-dunk smash burger to sustain you through the night. Says Coffren, a self-proclaimed dive bar expert, “I’m going to end up buying one of those tiny six-tops and tending bar until I croak.” We hope he means it.\n\nSide Hustle: Slink off to the side lounge, where a neon sign beckons “The Party” to its analog TV and retro sofas.\n\nSOUTHPAW\n\nFELLS POINT\n\nCocktail aficionados know that bartender Doug Atwell helped change the city’s drink game when he co-ran the original Rye cocktail bar on a sliver of South Broadway in Fells Point. That era ended in 2016, but luckily for the rapidly skyscraping neighborhood, the veteran barkeep has now opened a new corner bar at the crossroads of Bond and Fleet streets. Its nonchalant space hawks fresh takes on classic concoctions, plus budget-friendly libations like Coors Banquet bottles or High Life ponies (which can be easily converted into Atwell’s pride-and-joy Dr. Pepper shots). An old-school jukebox will be up and running any day now. All we ask is that he brings back “Thunderstruck.”\n\nWhat’s In A Name? Southpaw’s nom de plume is not because Atwell is left-handed but rather combines the owner’s three favorite things: baseball, dogs, and Southern food. What’s more Baltimore than that?"
