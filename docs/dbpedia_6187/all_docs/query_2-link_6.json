        "text": "Tim Leiweke, the president and C.E.O. of the Anschutz Entertainment Group, likes to show off the view from his office window in downtown Los Angeles. Fifteen years ago, the area was an urban wasteland: thirty acres of flophouses, bars, strip clubs, and empty lots, forlornly situated near the 10 and 110 freeways. Now Leiweke can point to Staples Center, a twenty-thousand-seat arena, and to L.A. Live, a bustling entertainment district, which are almost entirely owned by A.E.G. Beneath flashing billboards advertising L.A. Live sponsors like Coca-Cola and Toyota, there are dozens of restaurants, a J.W. Marriott/Ritz-Carlton Hotel, the Nokia Theatre, the Grammy Museum, and a multiplex Regal Cinema. Across the plaza from Leiweke’s office window is the entrance to Staples Center, home to the Lakers (partly owned by Philip Anschutz, the chairman of A.E.G.) and the Kings (majority-owned by A.E.G.).\n\nLeiweke, a bearish man of fifty-four, with rugged good looks and an unruly cowlick, is an inspired salesman, not given to modesty or understatement. He used to proclaim that one day L.A. Live would be “Times Square West,” an outsized fantasy he has since abandoned. But he characterizes Staples as “probably the most profitable building in the world”—a boast he can make without fear of contradiction, since the Anschutz company is privately owned. “Carla!” he called out to his secretary. “How long is the line outside Starbucks?” He uses the length of the line to gauge how busy his “campus” is. A.E.G. is so dominant in downtown Los Angeles that some refer to it as “Leiweke country.”\n\nOne may wonder why it is not “Anschutz country.” Philip Anschutz, who is seventy-two, owns A.E.G. and has an estimated net worth of seven billion dollars, according to Forbes. He has made his fortune in oil and gas, real estate, railroads, telecommunications, and sports and entertainment. He is one of the largest landowners in the U.S., and his empire of more than a hundred and fifty companies, nearly all privately held, is worldwide. He is philanthropically active and has donated more than a hundred million dollars to create the Anschutz Medical Campus, at the University of Colorado, in Aurora. But Anschutz, who lives in Denver, is intensely private and does little to publicize his ownership of A.E.G. or any of his other business activities.\n\nWhen he visits Los Angeles, he is accompanied by no chauffeur, personal assistant, or bodyguard. He does not use a cell phone, or e-mail, and once showed up so late to an event at one of his own arenas that Leiweke called the police. Anschutz had turned back because he’d forgotten his tickets at the hotel and was worried he wouldn’t be let in. He often goes to see the Lakers or the Kings play at Staples, where he may go unrecognized. Last November, he watched his soccer team, the L.A. Galaxy, compete against his fifty-per-cent-owned team, the Houston Dynamo, in the Major League Soccer Cup finals at the Home Depot stadium, which he built and owns, south of L.A. The Galaxy won, 1-0, and the midfielder David Beckham hoisted the giant sterling-silver Philip F. Anschutz trophy.\n\nCity officials recall having been introduced to Anschutz on only a few occasions since 1997, when the Staples Center deal was completed. Friends say that the larger the gathering the more quiet Anschutz becomes, content to leave Leiweke to work the room. Such self-effacement has created some bafflement in a city that takes personal aggrandizement for granted. According to Steve Soboroff, a businessman who was an adviser to former Mayor Richard Riordan during the building of Staples Center, “Anschutz, assisted by Tim, is the most important Angeleno of the last fifty years, and he’s not even an Angeleno.”\n\nLeiweke is not as sanguine about L.A. Live as he is about Staples Center. The project was approaching completion when the recession hit, and new ventures like the luxury condos at the Marriott/Ritz-Carlton have struggled. But Leiweke wants to create what he calls “the final piece of the puzzle for L.A. Live”: an N.F.L. stadium, to be built adjacent to Staples Center. With a deployable roof, the stadium is intended to house—in addition to football games and Super Bowls—concerts, international soccer games, wrestling and boxing matches, N.C.A.A. Final Fours, and major religious gatherings.\n\nLos Angeles has not had an N.F.L. team since 1995, when the Rams and the Raiders, tired of playing in antiquated stadiums, left the city and their disconsolate fans; the Rams went to St. Louis, and the Raiders to Oakland. Over the years, many businesspeople and politicians have tried to bring back the N.F.L., an exercise dramatized in the HBO series “Entourage.” (The owner of the Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones, appeared as himself, telling the Hollywood agent Ari Gold character, “We’ve been wanting a team in L.A. for a long time.”) But none of the proposed venues and financial offers found favor with the N.F.L.\n\nLeiweke began his campaign last February, with a lavish public event to announce a deal he had made with the Farmers Insurance Company: in exchange for a reported seven hundred million dollars over thirty years, the planned stadium would be named Farmers Field. It was the largest naming-rights deal in sports. On a mini-football field that A.E.G. created for the occasion in downtown L.A., guests sipped mimosas, watched a Farmers Insurance blimp float overhead, and listened to Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and other city politicians rhapsodize about the stadium and the return of the N.F.L. There have been vocal dissidents, many of whom don’t like the stadium’s downtown location, because it will affect traffic and air quality, or the fact that public funds will be needed to finance part of the project. To this, Leiweke said on the day of the naming-rights party, “It’s easy to throw darts, it’s easy to tear down, it’s easy to cast fear.” Since then, he has overcome any opposition that might have blocked the project.\n\nThe next step will be the most challenging. Anschutz has pledged to spend more than a billion dollars to build the stadium, but he and Leiweke must reach a deal both with the N.F.L. and with one or two teams to move to L.A. “How does the No. 2 city in the country not have an N.F.L. team!” Leiweke exclaimed when I met with him last July. Some have suggested that the N.F.L. is content with things as they are, but Leiweke insists, “It’s not a lack of interest. It’s a lack of facilities.” And, he went on, A.E.G.’s résumé proves it can be done. “We’ve built more arenas and stadiums than anyone in the world, ever—including the Romans!”\n\nAnschutz and Leiweke first met in the early nineties, when Leiweke was president of the Denver Nuggets, and they made a deal on some of Anschutz’s land in Denver for what ultimately became the Pepsi Center. “I think he had fun screwing me out of twenty million dollars in that purchase,” Leiweke said. Anschutz was impressed, though, and in 1996 he asked Leiweke to move to Los Angeles, to take over the Kings and create something akin to the Pepsi Center project. When Anschutz’s multiple entities were rolled into Anschutz Entertainment Group, in 1999, he put Tim Leiweke in charge of the global brand. Today, A.E.G. owns or operates about a hundred venues around the world, including the O2 arenas in London, Berlin, and Hamburg, and controls much of their content.\n\nAnschutz and Leiweke have transformed the sports and entertainment industry. The N.B.A. commissioner, David Stern, who has known both men for more than twenty years, told me, “Their footprint and their areas of expertise don’t seem to have boundaries.” The N.B.A. is a partner with A.E.G. in an arena in Shanghai, and N.B.A. teams play in A.E.G. arenas around the world. “Tim really didn’t become the Tim he is today until he went to work for Phil Anschutz,” Stern continued, noting that Leiweke is “a sort of modern-day P. T. Barnum.” He entered the sports industry during a time of rapid change. “We went from a league playing in beat-up buildings to this model of video boards and sound systems and restaurants and suites and clubs and, oh yes, there’s a basketball game in here somewhere!” Stern pointed out that in Europe corporations don’t entertain clients at indoor arenas. They take them to the opera or to a fine restaurant. “America is different. All our major cities have these entertainment palaces where citizens can gather.” Leiweke, he said, is “taking the American model and exporting it.”\n\nAnschutz and Leiweke had a specific model in mind. “When we started thinking this up, we went to Universal Studios and Disneyland,” Leiweke said. “The theme parks have a very brilliant concept. If twenty million people go through Disneyland, why can’t we build hotels, restaurants, and retail that service the twenty million people? That’s all we did here.” L.A. Live attracts only thirteen million people a year so far. “But twenty million, soon!” he added—a prediction based on the assumption that the football stadium will be built.\n\nLeiweke is drawn to challenging entrepreneurial ventures, and he sees the same impulse in Anschutz. “I have a guy that loves to drill oil wells,” Leiweke said, referring to Anschutz’s early incarnation as an oil and gas baron. Regarding the football stadium, he went on, “There has never been an oil well as deep, as risky, and as controversial as this project.” If it succeeds, A.E.G. will have substantial control of about a hundred acres in downtown Los Angeles. But Leiweke, no doubt sensitive to a concern in some quarters of L.A. that A.E.G. already controls too much of the metropolis, added, “This is not about monopoly for Mr. Anschutz. This is not about owning the board.”\n\nHe broached the stadium idea to Anschutz in the spring of 2009, and “he turned me down for six months,” Leiweke said. At the outset, the challenges appeared almost insurmountable. To be near Staples Center and L.A. Live, the stadium would have to be built where one of the Los Angeles Convention Center halls now stands. The city, therefore, would have to issue about three hundred million dollars in bonds to pay for tearing down the hall and relocating it, a prospect that caused heated public discussion in early 2011. Los Angeles has a budget shortfall of seventy-two million dollars, and it is expected to exceed two hundred million dollars for the fiscal year starting next July. Police and firefighters’ budgets have been slashed, and libraries and parks have either closed or had their hours curtailed.\n\nThe costs of the stadium project were daunting for Anschutz, too. Stadiums are much more expensive to build than arenas because they are so much bigger, and although the most successful arenas are occupied two hundred and fifty nights a year, the busiest stadiums are used thirty to forty nights a year. As Leiweke has said, “Trust me, it’s hard to spend a billion and a half dollars. Phil reminds me of that every day.” Furthermore, Leiweke had no team, and he knew that negotiating with the N.F.L. would be tortuous.\n\nHe also realized that the project could be personally difficult for Anschutz, who has had a partner in Staples Center since its inception: Edward Roski, Jr., the chairman and C.E.O. of Majestic Realty, one of the oldest privately held real-estate companies in the country. Roski, who is seventy-two, has the close-cropped hair, fit physique, and bearing of a marine officer. (He received two Purple Hearts when he served in Vietnam, in the sixties.) He played football for U.S.C. and has been committed to bringing the N.F.L. back to Los Angeles since 1996. By 2008, he had plans to build a stadium on six hundred acres he controls in the City of Industry, a commercial enclave with only a few hundred residents, about twenty miles east of downtown Los Angeles. His project was progressing smoothly when Leiweke proposed to Anschutz, in effect, that they become Roski’s competition.\n\nLeiweke, who describes himself as “the world’s greatest optimist,” says that Anschutz constantly argues with him and tests his premises. “Phil would probably say that we disagree more than we agree,” and perhaps never more than on the stadium. “Phil’s not a huge football fan. This is not a man who has dreamed all his life of owning a football team.” In July, 2010, when Leiweke met with Farmers executives over the naming-rights deal, he says he told them, “We don’t have a team, we don’t have city approval, we don’t have a deal with the league, we don’t have financing yet—and, by the way, my owner hasn’t said yes yet, so would you like to spend a record amount of money on that?” When he won the deal, Anschutz began to come around.\n\nLeiweke assiduously cultivates allies. In 1994, he presented President Clinton with a basketball at a Denver Nuggets game, and the two became friendly—Leiweke calls Clinton “an amazing, amazing man.” Less than a year after Staples Center opened, Clinton helped to make sure that the 2000 Democratic National Convention was held there.\n\nLeiweke has relied on Clinton for his stadium project, too. From the start, Leiweke worried about opposition by environmentalists, since the stadium would be built at what is already the most congested convergence of freeways in the country. He pushed hard for—and ultimately won—legislation that will provide A.E.G. with procedural exemptions from the California Environmental Quality Act. A.E.G. is scheduled to complete an environmental-impact report early this year (“the most extensive, expensive E.I.R. ever,” Leiweke says), which the city must approve before it finalizes a deal with A.E.G. on the stadium. During the period of public debate on the report, it will be useful for A.E.G. to have the imprimatur of the Clinton Global Initiative. At the Clinton conference in New York last September, Leiweke promised that Farmers Field would be “the most environmentally sustainable stadium in the world,” and Clinton described A.E.G. as “the world’s most environmentally conscious venue operators.”\n\nPhilip Anschutz and Bill Clinton seem like unlikely cohorts. Anschutz is a major donor to the Republican Party, and he hosts an annual dove hunt for friends, business allies, and politicians at Eagles Nest ranch, a forty-seven-thousand-acre property in eastern Colorado. It has twenty-five hundred head of cattle, and a golf course designed by Anschutz. Clinton has never attended. “Probably because he’s afraid they’d shoot him!” Leiweke said, laughing.\n\nAnschutz, a devout Christian, has contributed to the Institute for American Values, whose founder, David Blankenhorn, opposes same-sex marriage, and who testified in the trial on the constitutionality of California’s ban on same-sex marriage, known as Proposition 8, in 2010. Anschutz has been a frequent contributor to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which provides legal aid to employees opposing “compulsory unionism,” and he has been a major supporter of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, in his fight against a recall, after his efforts, last February, to eliminate many collective-bargaining rights. Anschutz has been a guest at the twice-a-year political gatherings of David and Charles Koch, the secretive anti-government oil billionaires. He has contributed to Americans for Prosperity, backed by the Koch brothers, which lobbies against global-warming science and for reducing regulation of the oil and gas industry. Anschutz Exploration Corporation recently filed suit in upstate New York to overturn a ban on “fracking”—a controversial practice in which chemical-laced water and sand are injected into the ground to extract natural gas.\n\nAnschutz has also sued the Internal Revenue Service at least seven times since 1987. Most recently, in 2010, a U.S. Tax Court judge sided with the I.R.S. Anschutz’s company appealed that decision, but in late December a federal appeals court upheld the ruling. Anschutz was required to pay the government more than seventeen million dollars in taxes, and his company was liable for at least seventy-seven million dollars.\n\nIn 2004, Anschutz entered the newspaper business, buying the San Francisco Examiner. He now owns the Washington, D.C., Examiner, a conservative daily; Examiner.com, a network of local-news Web sites, with eighty-five thousand contributors; and the Weekly Standard, which Anschutz bought from Rupert Murdoch in 2009, and which published an extensive defense of the Koch brothers last April. (When the Philanthropy Roundtable honored Charles Koch, last fall, Anschutz introduced him to the gathering as “a great warrior and a great American,” who engages in political battles despite “knowing of course in advance that he is going to be attacked and he’s going to get beaten up in the process.”) In October, Anschutz bought the Oklahoma Publishing Company, which owns the newspaper the Oklahoman, and NewsOK.com. He sold the San Francisco Examiner in November, and the paper’s new president and publisher, Todd Vogt, has said, “The ultra-right-wing Christian conservative slant the previous owner insisted on having is gone.”\n\nI asked Leiweke how Anschutz felt about A.E.G.’s affiliation with the Clinton Global Initiative. “Phil thinks I’m essentially nuts,” he said. “Phil says to me, ‘You know, Tim’ ”—he imitated Anschutz’s sonorous way of speaking—“and I’m like, ‘Stop! The governor’s Democratic, speaker’s Democratic, senate pro tem leader’s Democratic, treasurer’s Democratic, lieutenant governor’s Democratic, mayor’s Democratic, one person on the City Council is a Republican. Phil, has it occurred to you yet that . . . California is the bluest state in the Union?’ I get along well with Democrats, I get along equally well with Republicans,” he said, adding that he has a good relationship with House Speaker John Boehner. (They share a propensity for tearing up during speeches.) But Leiweke is careful not to antagonize local Democrats. Although the Anschutz newspapers belong to a division, Clarity Media Group, that is affiliated with A.E.G., Leiweke insisted that Clarity is not under his aegis. “I don’t need any more loss leaders. The Examiner in D.C.—not good.” He added that he stays as far away from the newspapers as he can. “I don’t write editorials, I don’t have a voice on editorials. I don’t get the Weekly Standard.”\n\nGiven Anschutz’s political profile, his lack of visibility in Los Angeles can make Leiweke’s job easier. In December, 2009, shortly before John Pérez, a former union official, was elected speaker of the California State Assembly, an article about him appeared in the Los Angeles Times. It mentioned that Pérez, who is openly gay, had revived a bill to help A.E.G. (by allowing alcohol advertisements inside A.E.G.-owned Club Nokia), and went on, “Pérez admits to actively disliking the company’s billionaire owner, Philip Anschutz, a significant backer of the Proposition 8 gay-marriage ban, but says he ‘looked beyond my personal dislike for the man to do what was best for a downtown business.’ ” Leiweke told me that he called Pérez to tell him that Anschutz had not backed Proposition 8. “Quite frankly, I don’t agree with Prop. 8, so I tend to view it the same way John does,” Leiweke said. “Phil not only has no opinion, would not render an opinion, would not get involved in it.” Pérez told me that he had heard from a reporter that Anschutz had helped to fund Proposition 8, but that Leiweke swore it was not true. “I take him at his word,” Pérez said. Pérez sponsored the legislation that granted A.E.G. its procedural exemptions from the California Environmental Quality Act, and his commitment was critical to its passage.\n\nStill, a faint public unease has lingered about Anschutz. Last August, at a homeowners’ association meeting in Sherman Oaks, in L.A.’s San Fernando Valley, where Leiweke was trying to build support for the stadium, he said, “Everyone thinks we’re a quiet, mysterious company. We’re really not. It’s just I happen to have an owner and a chairman who is a quiet man—lives in the same home, married to the same wife.” Crossing himself, he added, “Thank goodness he gets along with his wife every day, he owns sports teams”—an allusion to the messy divorce of Jamie and Frank McCourt, who own the Dodgers, and to the near-destruction of the team, which is now for sale. “He has three kids, lives in Denver, comes out here quite a bit. He just has never done a media interview in twenty-five years. He’s low-key, doesn’t have an ego. And so, because of that, a lot of people speculate. What I will tell you is, we’re a company that is privately held. We are a five-to-six-billion-dollar company. This man has funded us out of his pocket. He has today almost three billion dollars invested in Los Angeles*. . . .*{: .small} And we paid about a hundred million dollars in taxes in the calendar year 2010 to the city, the county, and the state. So we have no horns. We’re not out trying to pull a quick one.”\n\nLeiweke grew up with three brothers and two sisters in St. Louis, Missouri, and his childhood was consumed by his mother’s lengthy battle with cancer; she died when he was twelve. He says that the tragedy became the generative force of his life: “When you sit there for five years and watch your mom die, you either learn to do the doggy paddle or you sink. You build a real passion to make sure you don’t abuse or waste your life.” After he graduated from high school, his father, an insurance salesman who had played for the California Rams football team, helped Tim get a job with the New England Life Insurance Company. He attended college at night for one semester. “I remind myself on a daily basis I didn’t go to college,” he says now. “On the one hand, it keeps me humble, but on the other it’s something I feel I must overcome.”\n\nAfter three years, he got a job with the St. Louis Steamers, an indoor soccer team. His brother Tod, who is the president of the Tampa Bay Lightning, said, “Tim was always a brilliant organizer. He loved the idea of a show and a full house. Fireworks, smoke, inflatables, music—Tim was a pioneer in those things.” In St. Louis, Tim Leiweke said, “we made steam because we were the Steamers. We turned the lights out, shone spotlights on this little entryway, and then we had little strobes, and the players would come running out of the steam, with a song that became our theme song, ‘Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now.’ We were out there doing clinics every night, we did a ton of giveaways, we were very driven and very loyal to our fan base.” The N.B.A.’s David Stern recalled that Tim and his brothers were “the kings of promotion. I used to call them the Flying Wallendas. And Tim came of age at a time when the granddaddy of us all, the N.F.L., would fine you if you gave away a promotional item.” Looking back at that point in his career, Leiweke said, “We ended up selling out every night, and I have been unable to get out of this vicious cycle ever since.”\n\nAnschutz, too, has been consumed by business throughout his life. He grew up in central Kansas, where his father made and lost money as a wildcatter. “Oil and gas was an up-and-down business, at best,” Anschutz said in 2000, when he was inducted into the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans. He said that his father had “a drinking problem . . . struggled with it all his life,” and that led to chronic, debilitating illness. But he was a man of “enormous entrepreneurial skill who taught me about taking risks and the advantages to be found in failure.” His mother, he went on, “had strong moral values—Christian values.” When he graduated from the University of Kansas at twenty-one, his parents divulged that his father’s business, Circle A Drilling, was on the verge of bankruptcy. He gave up law school to try to save it. Nearly four years later, having stabilized and sold it, he went into the oil and gas business on his own. He was preternaturally focussed. “It becomes almost like alcoholism,” Anschutz said in a 1974 interview with the State Historical Society of Colorado. “You can’t break the habit. You eat and drink this kind of work.”\n\nHe pursued collecting Western art with a similar intensity, making his first major acquisitions in 1972, by trading oil leases for paintings. Steve Rose, who owned the Biltmore Galleries in Los Angeles, said, “I showed Phil photographs of thirty or forty paintings—there were a lot of Russells, and Remingtons, some Taos paintings—and he said, ‘I’ll take them all.’ He picked out the leases for me, and I tell Phil when I see him that I might be the only guy that ever got the best of him on a deal! I cash big checks every month.” Today, Anschutz owns paintings by Ernest Blumenschein, George Catlin, N. C. Wyeth, Georgia O’Keeffe, Frederic Remington, and Charles Marion Russell. His collection of American Western art is among the finest in private hands. Sarah Anschutz Hunt, a daughter of Anschutz and his wife, Nancy, wrote a forward to a 1999 book about her father’s art collection, “Painters and the American West.” Hunt noted that her father had chosen “to collect a type of art that embodies themes to which he, and most Americans, can relate”—that is, “a sense of adventure into the unknown, the triumph over adversity, a passion for exploration, and the desire to create something of lasting value.”\n\nIn Denver, in the eighties and nineties, Anschutz twice tried and failed to build an arena and entertainment district. Los Angeles has proved to be a better market. No one had created a major sports venue in Los Angeles since Jack Kent Cooke built the Forum in Inglewood, in 1967; the Lakers and the Kings were still playing there when Anschutz bought the Kings in 1995, and the N.F.L.’s Rams and Raiders had just left the city. “The business of sports was quite frankly underdeveloped here,” Leiweke said. Still, he hesitated when, in 1996, Anschutz offered him the job in L.A. He had been running the U.S. ski team and had married a few years earlier. His wife, Bernadette, wanted to remain in Denver because of their daughter, Francesca. Anschutz invited the Leiwekes to see his new team, the Kings, play the Colorado Avalanche. “At the first intermission, Phil goes like that to me”—Leiweke beckons with one finger—“and he takes me out to the concourse and says, ‘Now, you’re not stupid enough to turn this job down, are you?’ And I’m, like, ‘No, sir, I’m not stupid at all!’ I sit back down for second period and my wife says to me, ‘What did you just do?’ I said, ‘I couldn’t help it! He called me stupid!’ ”\n\nFor the nation’s second-largest city, L.A.’s downtown was shockingly underdeveloped. By the late nineties, many of its biggest firms—First Interstate, Union Oil, Security Pacific—had been bought by other companies and their headquarters moved elsewhere. It was the perfect place for Anschutz, a confirmed bottom-fisher, to buy low and build a new empire. Real estate was an integral part of his plan. He and Roski, who decided they would build a downtown arena together, wanted the city to seize through eminent domain thirty acres at the intersection of the two freeways. Unlike Anschutz, Roski was politically connected in Los Angeles, and was active in civic affairs and philanthropy. By the time Leiweke arrived, in late 1996, Roski had laid the groundwork for the arena with city officials.\n\nRoski’s pitch found favor with an overwhelming majority of the City Council, but Councilman Joel Wachs objected to the way that A.E.G., then the L.A. Arena Company, proposed that it subsidize the development, which he estimated would use about a hundred million dollars of tax revenue. When the City Council voted 13-2 in favor, Wachs threatened to introduce a ballot initiative to stop the project. At that point, “it really got hardball,” recalled Wachs, who now heads the Andy Warhol Foundation, in New York. Leiweke, a tireless combatant who sometimes tailors facts to his advantage, became a major Wachs antagonist. (That reputation has dogged Leiweke. In 2002, the Los Angeles Times sports columnist T. J. Simers wrote a couple of columns in which he referred to Leiweke as “LIE-weke.”)\n\nLeiweke was especially deft at recruiting every political group he needed. “In the end,” Wachs said, “we were fighting the unions, the business community, the L.A. Times, the Cardinal.” But polls showed that, if the issue went to a ballot, A.E.G. would likely lose, and after a battle that lasted nearly a year Wachs got what he wanted from A.E.G.: the funds to pay off the city’s bonds would come out of A.E.G.’s pocket. Leiweke, who makes a concerted effort not to leave enemies behind (an Anschutz dictum), still seems to carry a grudge against Wachs—perhaps because the Staples episode represented the only time in his history in Los Angeles that he fought hard for something and lost. “If Joel Wachs had his way,” Leiweke told a luncheon group recently, “the Lakers would be playing in Shickshinny.”\n\nRoski had expected to lead the construction of Staples Center. But, once the deal was finalized, Anschutz decided to take control. He put Leiweke in charge of everything related to Staples Center, and Roski withdrew. Although Anschutz and Roski had started out as roughly equal partners in the Kings, the Lakers, Staples Center, and the surrounding thirty acres that would become L.A. Live, Roski’s stake has dwindled to less than eight per cent. “Ed Roski was involved at the beginning of this,” Leiweke said, “but the fact is, Phil had the resources and the vision.”\n\nNot everything has worked out so well for Anschutz and Leiweke. In 2008, A.E.G. committed to building twelve arenas in China. That year, the company helped develop an arena in Beijing (the MasterCard Center), and in 2009 built one in Shanghai (the Mercedes-Benz Arena). But A.E.G. recently withdrew as an equity investor from the Beijing arena; Leiweke said that the company had trouble getting its profits out of China, so it is not making any new equity investments there. It operates as a consultant instead. “I took a beating from our board on China,” Leiweke said. “That was not a favored project of anyone on our board except for me, and so we persevered, but have we learned lessons? Yeah!”\n\nBecause Anschutz wanted not only to control facilities worldwide but also to have a stake in their content, in 1999 he and Leiweke formed a concert division, later named A.E.G. Live. (A.E.G. Live is now second only to Live Nation as a concert promoter.) The strategy was to own a piece of everything, cross-promote, and reap the benefits, in a synergistic conglomerate for the new century. They learned that Céline Dion and her husband and manager, René Angelil, were looking for a backer for an unusual project in Las Vegas, where she would perform at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace—“in residence,” for five years. In November, 2000, Anschutz and Leiweke met with Dion and Angelil at their home in Florida. After a few hours, Angelil told me, they shook hands on a deal for a hundred and fifty million dollars. Dion’s “A New Day” opened in 2003, and sold out for seven hundred and twenty-three consecutive shows; Anschutz told Angelil he saw it thirty-five times. (In December, 2010, Dion made a surprise appearance at a benefit for the Denver Art Museum, singing “Because You Loved Me” to Nancy and Phil Anschutz, the evening’s honorees.)\n\nAngelil said of that first meeting, “Mr. Anschutz showed us some TV commercials for the Foundation for a Better Life, which he funds. We were very impressed and touched by the quality of that.” Anschutz had recently launched the Foundation for a Better Life campaign, which has grown enormously in subsequent years. The F.B.L. Web site declares that its purpose is “to promote positive values.” Thousands of billboards in cities and towns across the country show photographs of individuals, some famous, some not, accompanied by short messages. Mother Teresa: “Reaching beyond yourself. Compassion. Pass it on.” An image of rescue workers and the American flag in the ashes of the World Trade Center: “No setback will set us back. Determination. Pass it on.” A smiling, one-legged boy in a baseball uniform: “Threw cancer a curve ball. Overcoming. Pass it on.”\n\nThe TV spots are now broadcast in more than two hundred countries, according to Anschutz, and the ads also appear on the radio and the Internet and on more than six thousand movie screens in Regal theatres; Anschutz is the largest shareholder of Regal Entertainment Group. His foundation contributes about three million dollars a year to produce the ads; networks and media companies donate TV time; billboard companies contribute space. Anschutz measures results through the ratings agency Nielsen, and has determined that billions of people see the ads.\n\nAs part of a memorandum of understanding with the city on the stadium, A.E.G. is to have forty-one additional billboards in the expanded L.A. Live complex. Most of these advertising displays will appear on the curving turquoise wall of the L.A. Convention Center’s main building, facing the interchange of the 10 and 110 freeways—an area through which about a hundred and thirteen million vehicles move in a year. The question is inevitable: Will those people, captive in their cars in gridlock intensified by Farmers Field, be called upon to “pass it on”? Anschutz’s name appears nowhere, not even on the F.B.L. Web site, but his messages, increasingly, are everywhere.\n\nIrving Azoff, a longtime music impresario, had a twenty-per-cent partnership in A.E.G. Live. However, his relationship with Anschutz quickly deteriorated after Azoff chose not to participate in the Céline Dion project, and within a year he had sold back his piece of A.E.G. Live. He recalled that when he went into partnership with Anschutz one of Anschutz’s other partners “pulled me aside, put his arm around me, and said, ‘Son, you don’t want to be Phil Anschutz’s minority partner. You’ll learn the hard way, just like I did.’ ”\n\nAzoff, who is now the executive chairman of Live Nation, added that he had learned from entertainment icons like Lew Wasserman and Steve Ross, and admired their “skills and benevolent attitude in dealing with both creative executives and talent.” In contrast, he went on, “Mr. Anschutz appears to deal in a far more aggressive and competitive style. At the end of the day, his legacy in the entertainment business will get a failing grade.”\n\nIn 1999, Anschutz began giving friends copies of a Christian self-help book, “Half Time—Changing Your Game Plan from Success to Significance.” For years, Anschutz had found contemporary culture dissonant and vulgar, and blamed the degradation of spirit on the preponderance of R-rated movies. In 2000, he started his first movie-production company, Crusader Entertainment; Crusader was renamed Bristol Bay Productions and was followed by Walden Media. The companies are affiliates of A.E.G. Anschutz has had only a few major successes, including a 2005 film of C. S. Lewis’s “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,” a Christian allegory. “Ray,” a 2004 biopic about the musician Ray Charles, was another. “Phil was very stringent about profanity—absolutely none. Even the word ‘shit’ was taboo,” the film’s director, Taylor Hackford, recalled. “He said, ‘For centuries, artists have come up with ways to express themselves without using the word “fuck,” so you should use your ingenuity to make a mature film without profanity.’ ” Hackford said he quit the project twice over Anschutz’s profanity prohibition but ultimately was able to use “hip jargon that sounded authentic and profane.” About Anschutz, Hackford said, “Although he was very heavy-handed in this one area, he gave me total autonomy in every other creative facet of the film. Anschutz is a man of his word, a mensch.” Anschutz recently bought the rights to Laura Hillenbrand’s book “Unbroken,” a story of extraordinary endurance by an American prisoner of war in Japan.\n\nAnschutz acknowledges that he does not just want to send uplifting messages; unlike the Foundation for a Better Life, this is business. In February, 2004, when he received the Adam Smith Award from Hillsdale College, in Michigan, Anschutz spoke about his movie business, saying his goal was “to attempt some small improvement in the culture.” But his move was opportunistic, too. He said he believed that digital production, distribution, and exhibition would bring about a restructuring in the film industry. (Events at Staples Center, the O2, and other A.E.G. venues can be simulcast at Regal movie theatres and at other digital-projection venues.) He also said he had learned how important it was to “control the way the film is marketed and watch over the distribution and the exhibition sides of the business. . . . Being just a producer isn’t good enough.” He was echoing the early studio bosses who fought to protect vertical integration but were ultimately ruled to be violating the antitrust laws, and were forced to sell their movie theatres. At the time that Anschutz established his first movie-production company, he also began assembling Regal Entertainment Group, the world’s largest theatre chain.\n\nA recurrent theme in Anschutz’s movies, his F.B.L. ads, his art collection, and his business life is the ability to overcome setbacks. “It helps to have your back against the wall,” Anschutz said, when he became a member of the Horatio Alger Association. “Adversity is a huge advantage—as long as you think of it as an advantage—because it helps you do things you never thought you were capable of doing.” Anschutz recounted how an oil well he was drilling in Wyoming in 1967 had exploded in flames, threatening to ruin him financially. He wanted to hire the legendary firefighter Red Adair but did not have the money. He quickly offered to sell Universal Studios the rights to film the conflagration—it was shooting “Hellfighters,” with John Wayne playing Adair. Anschutz received a hundred thousand dollars from Universal, and paid Adair to come fight the blaze.\n\nSurely the greatest business trouble Anschutz has encountered, which he does not speak about publicly, is the collapse of Qwest Communications International, Inc., a telecommunications company that he started in the late eighties. Anschutz took Qwest public in 1997, and its stock soared; in 2000, his net worth was estimated at eighteen billion dollars. By August, 2002, the tech/telecom bubble had burst, and Qwest’s shares sank more than ninety per cent. The S.E.C. charged that accounting fraud was rife at Qwest from 1999 to 2002, and the company eventually settled by paying a fine of two hundred and fifty million dollars. In the spring of 2001, Anschutz’s C.E.O. got more than fifty million dollars from illegal stock sales (he was later sentenced to almost six years in prison); in the same period, Anschutz sold a large block of his shares, netting roughly two hundred million dollars. Anschutz was never charged with insider trading. (He was, however, charged by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer with having received initial-public-offering shares from a Wall Street firm in exchange for having sent investment-banking business there; Anschutz settled that suit by donating $4.4 million to law schools and charities.)\n\nIn 2002, Fortune named Anschutz the country’s “greediest executive,” at the top of a list of corporate chieftains who sold off shares as their companies collapsed, leaving other shareholders to suffer devastating losses. The Fortune article was radically at odds with the inspirational messages that Anschutz was projecting on millions of billboards, and on TV and movie screens. A spokesperson for the Anschutz Corporation released a statement saying that the article was “inaccurate and unfair.”\n\nAnschutz resigned as nonexecutive chairman of Qwest that year, and eventually sold his remaining shares. At the company’s headquarters, in Denver, a huge blue neon sign lit up downtown for miles. After the collapse, the Qwest sign was removed, to the relief of many Denver residents, and A.E.G. replaced Qwest as Anschutz’s most favored enterprise.\n\nLeiweke says that it was Casey Wasserman, a grandson of the late Lew Wasserman and a friend of the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, who brought the current stadium project to him. Wasserman is close to Leiweke, and in March, 2009, Wasserman met with officials in the mayor’s office to discuss the plan. Leiweke was exhilarated by the prospect. He discussed it with the N.F.L., but he said nothing publicly. That October, Roski won an exemption from California Environmental Quality Act litigation, and declared that his stadium project for City of Industry was “shovel-ready.” Still, Leiweke made no public statement. He had met with Roski to discuss A.E.G.’s selling the naming rights and sponsorships for Roski’s stadium in 2008, and Leiweke’s team continued to meet with Roski’s people in 2009. In 2010, Leiweke finally disclosed that A.E.G. was thinking about building a stadium in downtown L.A., and, according to someone who knows Roski well, “Roski felt that Tim misled him and became a competitor.”\n\nBy this time, Leiweke had made the rounds of politicians and people he would most need. One of the first he went to see was María Elena Durazo, the executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, A.F.L.-C.I.O. Durazo, who used to be the head of Unite Here, the hotel and food service workers’ union, had supported A.E.G.’s proposal to build Staples, and helped A.E.G. with the City Council, but disagreements emerged when she and her colleagues began negotiating with Staples’s major food-service company. Union members picketed Staples Center while Leiweke was trying to persuade the Democratic Party to hold its 2000 national convention there. Leiweke and Durazo had many acrimonious meetings. “Tim was very hard—a very hard negotiator,” she told me.\n\nBut she regarded him with grudging respect. “I had to give him credit for doing something in an area that was a desert,” she said. “Nobody even wanted to get near that area in downtown.” After they reached a settlement, she continued, “Tim called me and said, ‘Let’s sit down and talk, one on one.’ He said, ‘Look, I got my butt kicked in this fight, and you taught me something—that we’re better off working together than we are at odds with each other. I pledge to you that from now on we’re going to work as partners in these projects.’ ”\n\nWhen Leiweke told her about his plan to knock down part of the convention center to build a stadium, she thought it was “wild.” Durazo had just come from helping Roski win his exemption from C.E.Q.A. litigation in a difficult battle in the state legislature, and she didn’t want Roski “to feel that we were turning on him.” But, Durazo said, “Tim is extremely persistent, very ambitious, doesn’t take no for an answer. So I wouldn’t dare either discourage him or disbelieve him. It was like, My God, if anybody could pull it off, it would be Tim!”\n\nBy the time Leiweke started his public campaign, he had fine-tuned his pitch. City officials might or might not care about a football stadium, but everyone welcomed the idea of more convention-center business. “Believe it or not, I’m very committed to the N.F.L., but I’m more committed to the convention business,” he told a Century City business association, last May. Leiweke declared that Los Angeles is fifteenth among most sought-after convention cities and that, with a new, updated convention-center space, it could become second or third. Four or five new hotels would be built, he said, to accommodate the conventioneers. “If we can simply use the winds of the N.F.L. stadium as the economic engine to fix our convention center, it will be the driver that for generations will make sure that we once again prosper as a city.”\n\nLeiweke vowed that the project would rescue the ailing city economy, “for our children’s children.” And even though the city would have to issue about three hundred million dollars of tax-exempt bonds, he said that “it won’t cost you a penny.” Leiweke made this argument countless times, and soon politicians like Villaraigosa and City Councilwoman Jan Perry were echoing him. But repetition did not make it true. Although revenues generated by the stadium project would theoretically repay this debt, covered by various guarantees from A.E.G., a substantial portion of the bond payments would come from new tax revenues that typically would go to the city’s General Fund, which pays for essential services, including police and fire departments. Moreover, the city’s financial analyst emphasized that if A.E.G. were to struggle financially over the thirty-year life of the bonds, with their increased annual debt-service payments, the risk to the city would increase. The analyst also found that the project would not create the numbers of ongoing jobs that Leiweke claimed, and that convention-center business was not likely to improve very much.\n\nDuring the spring and summer, Leiweke campaigned as though he were running for office. He took his message to neighborhood councils and the Chamber of Commerce and business luncheons and the Rotary Club and homeowners’ associations and community activists. He stressed that he, too, is an Angeleno, and that Francesca, who is now twenty-seven, and works for A.E.G. on the football project, went to school there; that he, too, is angry about the cutbacks in the budgets of the L.A.P.D. and the Fire Department, and about the traffic between his office downtown and his home in Brentwood, and about getting flat tires from the potholes on Sunset Boulevard, which the city can’t afford to fix. But the stadium and the new convention center, he argued, would solve many of these problems; the private sector would step up to do what the public sector cannot. He artfully flattered people who asked questions, and put himself in their shoes.\n\nStill, certain issues tended to ruffle him. Many studies have shown that stadiums, after the construction period, do not generate new economic activity for a community; a dollar spent at a stadium is a dollar taken from somewhere else. At a town-hall meeting, one member of the audience said that the last time Leiweke had been asked about these studies he had said he would cite academics on his side of the argument. Who were they?\n\n“I’d be more than happy to show you that,” Leiweke responded. “And I’ll make you a deal. I’ll buy you dinner one night at L.A. Live, and we can sit there, look at three billion dollars in development, and we can question whether the professor that came in and said there will be no economic development that will come from Staples Center was right. I can show you studies—but how about I show you brick and mortar?” His questioner pressed about the research, and Leiweke, raising his voice, replied, “You bring your professor, who never has invested one penny in this community, and then I will bring all the union guys, who are sitting here with forty-per-cent unemployment, and you ask them, Do they want to let those people that have never spent a dime of risk in this community sit there and preach that there’s no economic development and impact that’s going to come from stadiums and arenas?”\n\nLeiweke threatened that if he didn’t get a City Council vote on the memorandum of understanding by early August the deal could fall through, and the Council unanimously voted in favor. (The memorandum is nonbinding, but it provides a template for the final agreement, which is expected this year.) The city’s negotiators wrested better financial terms from A.E.G. than the company had initially proposed, but it is hard not to see the straitened city as a supplicant, and A.E.G. as a self-described benefactor: the country’s second-largest city, and yet a company town. Some have suggested that A.E.G. buys its influence—since 2000, the company has spent almost $2.7 million in political contributions in California—but its dominance is far greater than that amount of money would suggest. “It’s that they have pop,” one longtime elected official said, “and everybody wants to feed a fat pig.”\n\nAnother important factor in the project is the stadium’s impact on traffic, and its risk to the environment. What A.E.G. will do to mitigate already crippling traffic, and whether downtown roads and freeway ramps will have to be rebuilt, and who will pay for them, will be resolved only after the release of A.E.G.’s environmental-impact report. “I spoke at various meetings and encouraged the city to deal with traffic issues up front, but I got absolutely nowhere,” said David Pettit, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, who had supported A.E.G. in its effort to win certain procedural C.E.Q.A. exemptions. “I think at the end of the day the city was so excited about this project that it didn’t want to put any roadblocks in A.E.G.’s way.”\n\nThrough the summer, Leiweke created such momentum for Farmers Field that it began to seem inevitable, and Roski’s project appeared correspondingly moribund. But Leiweke was dealing with city and state politicians, not with the N.F.L., which is far less malleable, and favors competition among bidders. For many months, the N.F.L. had privately expressed a lack of enthusiasm for Roski’s City of Industry site. By early October, though, the league was sending a clear message to Roski and also to Anschutz, who had reportedly been trying to acquire a minority share of a team at a discount of fifty cents on the dollar. As the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, Jim Irsay, told the Los Angeles Times, regarding Farmers Field, “I think it could be a tremendous deal. But . . . no one’s going to steal a minority interest for an outrageous price.”\n\nIn the midst of the ferment, Al Davis, the owner of the Oakland Raiders, died. The San Diego Chargers have for some time appeared the most likely team to move to L.A., but, with Davis’s death, speculation increased that the Raiders might return to the city they left sixteen years ago. (Other possible candidates include the St. Louis Rams and the Minnesota Vikings.)\n\nAnschutz was seeking a unique concession from the N.F.L. Generally, a stadium is owned by a team, or leased to it, and the team is in charge of game-day revenues; with Farmers Field, Anschutz would own the stadium, selling sponsorships and premium seating, controlling parking and concessions, and paying the team a percentage of revenues—much as he does in Staples Center. “Can we get a team?” Leiweke said. “I have a lot of faith that if we could find the right place with Roger”—Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner—“we would get to the right place with a team. And one thing you have heard from me consistently is Roger, Roger, Roger, Roger!” He added, “I am a very big fan of the commissioner.” (Leiweke says that Goodell calls him “the Energizer Bunny.”)\n\n“This is not about doing a deal with the commissioner,” Eric Grubman, the N.F.L.’s executive vice-president of business ventures, said. “This is about finding a structure and terms that will attract a team.” In the league’s view, the deal that Anschutz was proposing was doubly flawed: not only was he trying to get a share of a team at a discount but he wanted a landlord-tenant relationship that, in its control of revenues, amounted to a kind of asset-stripping. “It’s unlikely the league or a team would approve this proposal,” Grubman said. Six weeks earlier, Grubman continued, he had given Leiweke an outline of elements that he thought would persuade a team to sign with Anschutz. “Since they haven’t quit, I have some optimism they’re working toward it,” Grubman said.\n\nIn October, Roski, energized by A.E.G.’s difficulties, reportedly restructured his offer. John Semcken, Roski’s point man on the stadium, recently expressed high confidence, saying that “we believe timing has never been better.” But, according to Grubman, Roski, too, has not gone far enough to interest a team: “Roski’s site is attractive on several fronts, but, to get something across the goal line at that site, the deal for a club owner would have to be very good and very low-risk.”\n\nLeiweke’s contract with Anschutz will end this year. He has a stake of about four per cent of A.E.G., including the arenas and sports teams, according to a close friend. When I asked Leiweke about it, he replied, “I don’t have lawyers or anyone who negotiates on my behalf. That’s just Phil and me having a conversation, and I think I’ll keep it that way.” In the past, Leiweke has mused publicly about running for office, and at one of the neighborhood councils he commented, “The reality is, I wish I could run for mayor, but I can’t afford to.” His brother Tod told me not to rule out the possibility that Leiweke will enter politics.\n\nWhen asked about the subject, Leiweke offered a cursory denial, but then began talking about how deeply involved he intends to be in the coming Presidential campaign. Last time, he said, he gave money to Barack Obama, but he believes that the President has engaged in class warfare. “Look, I personally came from nothing,” he said. “Someone making me look like a bad guy because I’m making money now? I resent that. I’m really upset about the way he is positioning this now about protecting the rich. I was never rich in my life. I earned everything, built my life from the ground up, and never got one damn break in my life! I resent the fact that when my mom was sick, and my dad had to pay for her treatment, it took every dime from my dad and broke him as a human being and he was never the same. And then, after we have overcome that, now to make me look like I’m bad, I’m evil, I’m greedy, I don’t give. Terrible!” He went on, “I hugely admire Phil for putting everything back in. This is a man that’s never pulled anything out of this campus. Double down, triple down, quadruple down. And then people take shots at him because, they say, ‘He’s a billionaire.’ He’s the most humble man I know.” When people attack Anschutz, he continued, “I take it personally, almost like I was his son.”\n\nIf Anschutz builds the stadium, he will be gambling that L.A. Live will become what he’d initially hoped, and that other downtown areas, where he also owns land, will prosper. In his 1974 interview, he described how, after the fires had started, he had invested more heavily in the Wyoming oil wells, by buying out his partner. “There’s always a point that if you go forward you win, sometimes you win it all, and if you go back you lose everything,” he said.\n\nLeiweke explained how he had persuaded his football-averse boss to come this far: “You’ll have a seventy-thousand-seat football stadium, a twenty-thousand-seat arena, a seven-thousand-seat theatre, a two-thousand-three-hundred-seat music club, a fourteen-screen cinema. You’ll probably have five thousand hotel rooms right next to the campus by the time we’re done here, twenty-four restaurants, night clubs, bars, and bowling alleys, the Grammy Museum, and public space for festivals and parties. And then you’ll have a convention center next door. If you’re the Super Bowl, if you’re the N.B.A. or N.H.L. All-Star game, if you are ultimately anyone that wants to be big and important, it will be a hundred-acre campus and the only one of its kind.” He paused for breath. “There’s nothing like it in the world.”\n\nThe convention center sounded almost like an afterthought. Leiweke shrugged, and smiled. “I think the convention center is going to be the single largest project economically in the history of L.A.,” he said. “There are many critics that don’t buy it. I’m all right with that. I forget who said it—sometimes being visionary is a very lonely thing.” ♦"
