        "text": "After a few years off the grid, Brendan Fraser's career in Hollywood witnessed a rebirth.\n\nFraser first rose to fame in the early '90s with roles in comedy films such as Encino Man (1992) and George of the Jungle (1997) but achieved massive commercial success starring as Rick O'Connell in The Mummy (1999) — which spawned two sequels in 2001 and 2008, an animated series, a spinoff prequel (2002’s The Scorpion King) and celebrated its 25th anniversary on May 7, 2024.\n\nFollowing a string of box office successes in the late 1990s and 2000s, the actor stepped out of the spotlight amid various personal issues, including multiple surgeries and the death of his mother, Carol.\n\nSince 2018, Fraser's career has taken off again (dubbed the \"Brenaissance\" on TikTok) with roles on TV shows like Doom Patrol and in movies such as Steven Soderbergh's No Sudden Move (2021) and Darren Aronofsky's The Whale (2022). The latter film — which marked the actor's first major role since 2013 and earned a six-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival — landed Fraser an Oscar for Best Actor.\n\nFrom his rise to fame to his recent successes, here's everything to know about Fraser's career and comeback.\n\n1991: Brendan Fraser makes his feature film debut\n\nFraser got his start in Hollywood in the early '90s, with his first feature film being 1991's Dogfight. The following year, he scored his first leading film role in the comedy Encino Man, as well as earned notice for his acting skills in the drama School Ties (1992).\n\n1997: Brendan Fraser stars in George of the Jungle\n\nFraser had his first major box office success with the 1997 comedy film George of the Jungle, which costarred Leslie Mann and earned nearly $180 million at the box office. Fraser played a spoof of Tarzan, that was based on a cartoon series from 1967.\n\n1998: Brendan Fraser receives critical acclaim for his role in Gods and Monsters\n\nThe following year, Fraser received critical acclaim for his role in Gods and Monsters, which was based on the life of Frankenstein (1931) director James Whale. While the film only made $6.5 million at the box office, it received countless award nominations and won an Academy Award for Writing (Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published).\n\n1999: Brendan Fraser skyrockets to fame for The Mummy franchise\n\nOn the heels of the Gods and Monsters buzz, Fraser had another big success as he portrayed Rick O'Connell in 1999's The Mummy (which turned 25 in May 2024). The film was a commercial success, grossing more than $416.4 million worldwide and later getting two sequels, The Mummy Returns in 2001 and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor in 2008, with Fraser reprising his role in each.\n\nEarly 2000s: Brendan Fraser continues to star in a number of film projects\n\nIn the early 2000s, Fraser continued to star in many popular films, including Bedazzled (2000) with Elizabeth Hurley, Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003) and the Oscar-winning film Crash (2004). Additionally, he made several guest appearances on TV shows such as Scrubs, King of the Hill and The Simpsons.\n\nAmid his TV and film roles, he was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2006, making him the first American-born actor to receive the honor.\n\n2008: Brendan Fraser undergoes multiple surgeries\n\nIn his GQ profile from 2018, Fraser noted that by the time he was filming his third Mummy feature in 2008, the effects of doing his own stunts for years were taking their toll on his body, and he was \"put together with tape and ice\" as a result.\n\n\"I needed a laminectomy. And the lumbar didn't take, so they had to do it again a year later,\" he told the publication. Over the next seven years, multiple surgeries followed, including a partial knee replacement, work on his back including \"bolting various compressed spinal pads together\" and having his vocal cords repaired.\n\nLate 2000s: Brendan Fraser slowly steps away from the spotlight\n\nAround the time Fraser was undergoing multiple surgeries, he was also dealing with some personal struggles as well. In December 2007, Fraser and his wife Afton Smith — with whom he shares three children — announced their divorce after nine years of marriage.\n\n\"I changed houses; I went through a divorce. Some kids were born. I mean, they were born, but they're growing up,\" Fraser told GQ about that time in his life. \"I was going through things that mold and shape you in ways that you're not ready for until you go through them.\"\n\nDuring that period, Fraser slowly stepped out of the spotlight, scaling back on TV and movie projects in the late 2010s.\n\n2016: Brendan Fraser gives his first interview in years\n\nIn late 2016, Fraser gave his first interview in years as he appeared on AOL's BUILD series to discuss his role on The Affair. The video later went viral with many noting how morose Fraser seemed.\n\nFraser later explained that at the time he spoke at the BUILD series, he was grappling with the death of his mother Carol, who had died just days before the interview. \"I buried my mom,\" Fraser told GQ. \"I think I was in mourning, and I didn't know what that meant.\"\n\nHe added that he hadn't done press in a while and was taken aback by the way the interview was structured: \"I wasn't quite sure what the format was. And I felt like, 'Man, I got f------- old. Damn, this is the way it's done now?' \"\n\n2018: Brendan Fraser claims he was sexually assaulted and blacklisted in Hollywood for coming forward\n\nIn his GQ interview from 2018, Fraser claimed that the former president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (the non-profit organization that votes for the Golden Globe Awards), Philip Berk, sexually assaulted him in the summer of 2003, while at a luncheon at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Berk has denied Fraser's claims.\n\n\"I felt ill,\" Fraser said of the alleged incident. \"I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry. I felt like someone had thrown invisible paint on me.\"\n\nThough he told his then-wife about what had happened at the time, Fraser told GQ that he didn't have \"the courage to speak up\" earlier, \"for risk of humiliation, or damage to my career.\"\n\nFraser added that his alleged experience with Berk \"made [him] retreat\" and \"feel reclusive.\" \"[I] became depressed,\" he said, recounting how he told himself he deserved what happened to him. \"I was blaming myself and I was miserable — because I was saying, 'This is nothing; this guy reached around and he copped a feel. [Work] withered on the vine for me. In my mind, at least, something had been taken away from me.\"\n\nHe added that he felt as if the HFPA had blacklisted him following the incident. \"I don't know if this curried disfavor with the group, with the HFPA. But the silence was deafening,\" he said, adding that he was rarely invited back to the Globes after 2003.\n\n2018: Brendan Fraser begins his \"Brenaissance\" with various TV roles\n\nIn 2018, Fraser began to book a number of TV roles, most notably voicing Robotman on DC Universe's Titans, a part he later reprised on Max's Doom Patrol. The string of projects was quickly dubbed the \"Brenaissance\" on TikTok, with many fans noting their excitement about Fraser's return to acting.\n\nOctober 2021: Brendan Fraser is cast in the Batgirl film\n\nIn October 2021, Fraser continued to work with DC Comics as he was cast as the villain Firefly in the Batgirl film starring Leslie Grace, Michael Keaton, and J.K. Simmons.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding the film, Batgirl was later canceled by Warner Bros. Discovery in August 2022.\n\nThe film's directors, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, reacted to the cancelation with a heartfelt tribute to the cast and crew saying: \"Our amazing cast and crew did a tremendous job and worked so hard to bring Batgirl to life. We are forever grateful to have been part of that team. It was a dream to work with such fantastic actors like Michael Keaton, J.K. Simmons, Brendan Fraser, Jacob Scipio, Corey Johnson, Rebecca Front and especially the great Leslie Grace, who portrayed Batgirl with so much passion, dedication and humanity.\"\n\nSeptember 2022: Brendan Fraser receives critical acclaim for his role in The Whale\n\nIn January 2021, Fraser was announced as the lead in Darren Aronofsky's film The Whale, marking one of his first leading roles since 2013. (The same year, he also acted alongside Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Toro and more in Steven Soderbergh's No Sudden Move.)\n\nThe film later premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in September 2022, receiving high praise from critics including a six-minute standing ovation that left the actor in tears.\n\nAronofsky specifically sought out Fraser for the role of a reclusive, morbidly obese English teacher who struggles to connect with his daughter and others — in part because the role was so unexpected for Fraser. \"He said he wanted an actor to reintroduce,\" Fraser told Vanity Fair in August 2022. \"And I wanted to be reintroduced.\"\n\nSept. 11, 2022: Brendan Fraser takes home the Tribute Award at Toronto International Film Festival\n\nFraser was overwhelmed with emotion while accepting the Tribute Award for his role in The Whale at the Toronto International Film Festival gala.\n\n\"Wow, this is new for me because normally I am the guy at the podium who hands these things out,\" Fraser said. \"I think that the last time I waited to hear my name called out loud to receive an award was in grade 4 and it was from the peewee bowling league.\"\n\nOct. 12, 2022: Brendan Fraser gets a 5-minute standing ovation at the London Film Festival\n\nOnce again, Fraser was moved to tears as he received a five-minute standing ovation at the London Film Festival following a screening of his film The Whale.\n\nNov. 16, 2022: Brendan Fraser reveals he's not attending the 2023 Golden Globes\n\nDuring an interview with GQ published in November, the actor revealed that he will not attend the Golden Globes following his dark past with the HFPA and its former president Berk (who was expelled from the association after sending a racist email in 2021).\n\n\"I have more history with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association than I have respect for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association,\" Fraser said, citing the nonprofit organization that votes for the Golden Globe Awards.\n\nHe added, \"It's because of the history that I have with them. And my mother didn't raise a hypocrite. You can call me a lot of things, but not that.\"\n\nNov. 29, 2022: Brendan Fraser makes a rare appearance with his sons\n\nAfter stepping out with his girlfriend Jeanne Moore at the 2022 Gotham Awards, the actor made a rare appearance with his sons Holden and Leland at a New York City screening of The Whale.\n\nFraser posed for photos with his boys ahead of the screening, where he was also joined by Moore.\n\nDec. 11, 2022: The Whale has a record-breaking debut at the box office\n\nIn December 2022, Entertainment Weekly reported that The Whale had the best limited opening of any movie that year after it debuted in Los Angeles and N.Y.C.\n\nThe movie sold out screenings at all six movie theaters it played in over that weekend and grossed $360,000 total, according to the outlet.\n\nThe Whale averaged $60,000 in ticket sales for each screen it played on in that time period, which makes for director Darren Aronofsky's best box office opening since his 2010 film Black Swan (for which star Natalie Portman won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role) — according to EW, which cited production company A24 and Comscore.\n\nDec. 12, 2022: Brendan Fraser receives a Golden Globe nomination for The Whale\n\nDespite publicly saying he would not be attending the 2023 Golden Globes, the actor received a nomination for his role in The Whale in December 2022. Fraser earned a nod for performance by an actor in a motion picture – drama alongside eventual winner Austin Butler (Elvis), Hugh Jackman (The Son), Bill Nighy (Living) and Jeremy Pope (The Inspection).\n\nJan. 4, 2023: Brendan Fraser opens up about his movie-star comeback\n\nDuring an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, the actor opened up about his role in The Whale and the audience's reactions to it.\n\n\"I just broke out crying. That solved all the problems,\" Fraser said of the reportedly six-minute standing ovation.\n\n\"I think it depends on who's holding the stopwatch to tell you the truth,\" he joked in reference to the varying reports of how many minutes of applause.\n\nHe added, \"I feel like I'm still waiting for someone to walk in and tell me that the jig is up, you know.\"\n\nJan. 24, 2023: Brendan Fraser receives first-ever Oscar nomination for The Whale\n\nThe actor scored an Oscar nomination (his first) on Jan. 25, 2023, when he was named among the five nominees for Best Actor in a Leading Role, recognized for his performance in The Whale. The drama was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress for costar Hong Chau and Best Makeup and Hairstyling for the team that transformed Fraser into his 600-lb. character, Charlie.\n\nFraser reacted to the news in a statement obtained by PEOPLE, saying he was \"absolutely overjoyed and deeply grateful to the Academy for this recognition and for recognizing Hong Chau's beautiful performance and Adrien Morot's incredible makeup.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have this nomination without [director] Darren Aronofsky, [writer] Samuel D. Hunter, A24 and the extraordinary cast and crew who gave me the gift of Charlie,\" the actor continued. \"A gift I certainly didn't see coming, but it's one that has profoundly changed my life. THANK YOU!\"\n\nMarch 12, 2023: Brendan Fraser wins Best Actor at the Oscars\n\nDuring the 2023 Oscars, Fraser took home his first Academy Award as he won Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance in The Whale. The actor was overcome with emotion as he thanked his cast and crew as well as his three sons, two of whom were proudly watching his speech in the audience.\n\n\"I started in this business 30 years ago, and things, they didn't come easily to me, but there was a facility that I didn't appreciate at the time until it stopped,\" he said during his speech. \"And I just want to say thank you for this acknowledgment.\"\n\nMay 20, 2023: Brendan Fraser appears in Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nAnnounced in August 2021, Fraser joined the cast of Martin Scorsese's adaptation of David Grann's 2017 nonfiction book, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2023.\n\nNominated for 10 Academy Awards, Killers of the Flower Moon takes a look back at the historical \"Reign of Terror\": a series of violent murders against wealthy Osage people in Oklahoma in the 1920s. Fraser appeared in the film as the loud attorney W.S. Hamilton who represents influential landowner William Hale (Robert De Niro) in court."
