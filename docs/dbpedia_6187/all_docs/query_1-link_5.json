Ever wondered what it's like to be the barrier between David Letterman and a TV studio? Our guest not only had to stop the late-night legend from crashing the Live at 5 set but also witnessed a surprising turn of events that left everyone shocked. And it involved cake and ice cream! From a life-changing assignment in DC to moonlighting as a roadie on Saturday Night Live, our guest's journey is a mosaic of unforgettable experiences. Imagine rubbing shoulders with David Johanson and other legends at Madison Square Garden—it's not a dream; it's just another day in the life of an NBC Page. But the excitement doesn't end there. Picture this: a snapshot with NBC President Jack Welch and a heartwarming tale of camaraderie with talk show host Phil Donahue. And our guest spills the foot-stomping story that made him so happy when he received his official NBC Page uniform! For all you 30 Rock enthusiasts, get ready for a backstage pass as our guest shares how NBC Pages like himself roamed free, exploring the studios, and all their tape machines, cameras, and lighting equipment. His friendship with a Lighting Supervisor even led to an education that rivals the best film schools! But that's not all—he was able to tell Mr. Schwarzenegger, SHE'LL BE BACK! It's not a made-up story! He worked with the legendary Don Pardo, whom he tracked to produce a voice-over for NBC stations nationwide. From CNBC to the BBC, his journey is a whirlwind of fascinating tales that will leave you hanging on every word. So buckle up and tune in for an enthralling conversation with Mr. Ben Hoffman!
