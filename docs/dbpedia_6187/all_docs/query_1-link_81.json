        "text": "This was Rick’s last real Rock & Roll album. Subsequent albums to this one too a far more easy listening sound. This however is a pretty good Rock & Roll album and personally is one of my favourite album from him. Rick was joined by his usual studio musicians including Keith Thomas whose keyboard work I always enjoy. I really hate to just classify this as “another Rick Cua” album because it’s quite good but there’s just not a lot to say about this album. Rick had making an album down to an art at this point so you knew you were going to get a great album if you bought one of his albums from this era. Probably the highlight of the album for me is Young Boy Young Girl on which he is joined by Rebecca Sparks wife of Greg Sparks on vocals.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Streetwise – 3:45\n\n2 – I Can I Will – 4:09\n\n3 – Young Boy Young Girl – 4:13\n\n4 – I’ll Be Satisfied – 4:26\n\n5 – Dedicated – 3:33\n\n6 – Somethin’ You Got – 3:35\n\n7 – No Man Will Know – 3:43\n\n8 – Plenty Of Love – 4:11\n\n9 – Tear Down The Walls – 3:17\n\n10 – The Lost Can Still Be Found – 3:30\n\nCredits\n\nAcoustic Guitar, Electric Guitar, Drum Programming, Percussion, Keyboards [Additional] – Tom Hemby\n\nArranged By – Tom Hemby\n\nBacking Vocals – Bob Halligan Jr., Jimmy Lee, Kim Fleming, Michael Mishaw, Ron Hemby, Vickie Hampton\n\nDrums, Percussion – Mike Mead\n\nEngineer – Bill Deaton\n\nGuitar – Dave Perkins\n\nKeyboards, Synthesizer – Keith Thomas\n\nProducer – Tom Hemby\n\nVocals, Bass – Rick Cua\n\nVocals – Rebecca Ed Sparks\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nDistributed By – Word (Uk) Ltd.\n\nPhonographic Copyright ℗ – Reunion Records\n\nThe Compassion All Star Band was a collection of great CCM artists recorded live at 1989’s Creation Festival. The album was a fund raiser for the charity organization Compassion International and though recorded in June the album includes a few “Christmas” songs as the album was scheduled as a Christmas release. The band was Phil Keaggy, Randy Stonehill, Margaret Becker, Rick Cua, Joe English, Mike Mead and John Andrew Schriner. I had read about this album but honestly hadn’t listened to it when it was released. That’s too bad because I really enjoyed it. It’s not a musical wonder by any stretch as I’m guessing there wasn’t much rehearsal BUT that’s what makes projects like this so great. The unpolished sound gives the tracks more meaning and you can really get a feel for what was a fantastic performance. Strangely the crescendo track “Who Will Save The Children” had to actually be recorded in studio as the concert was rained out. These types of compilation albums are my favourites and it’s too bad CCM music didn’t have more of them.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Randy Stonehill – Defender – 3:022\n\n2 – Rick Cua – You Can’t Stand Too Tall – 4:07\n\n3 – Margaret Becker – Sacred Fire – 7:06\n\n4 – John Andrew Schreiner – Silent Night – 4:54\n\n5 – Randy Stonehill – Christmas Must Be Tonight – 3:58\n\n6 – Margaret Becker – Find Me – 3:31\n\n7 – Joe English – Yield To The Spirit – 4:18\n\n8 – Phil Keaggy & Randy Stonehill – Ain’t Got No – 3:35\n\n9 – Randy Stonehill – Crossroads – 6:12\n\n10 – Randy Stonehill – Rap – 5:11\n\n11 – Randy Stonehill & Phil Keaggy – Who Will Save The Children – 5:04\n\nCredits\n\nBass, Vocals – Rick Cua\n\nCo-producer [Production Assistance] – John Andrew Schreiner\n\nCrew [Stage Assistance] – Bill Goings\n\nDesign [Cover Design] – Kugizaki Design, Inc.\n\nDirected By [Musical Director] – Lynn Nichols\n\nDrums, Percussion – Mike Mead\n\nDrums, Percussion, Vocals – Joe English\n\nEngineer – Gary Heddon\n\nEngineer [Additional] – Jim Kaiser\n\nEngineer [Live Monitor Engineer] – Jody Nachtigal\n\nEngineer [Live Sound Engineer] – Mike Nachtigal\n\nExecutive-Producer – Devlin Donaldson\n\nGuitar, Vocals – Margaret Becker, Phil Keaggy, Randy Stonehill\n\nKeyboards, Vocals – John Andrew Schreiner\n\nPhotography By [Cover Photos] – Russ Harrington\n\nPhotography By [Inside Photos] – Keith Baum\n\nProducer – Gary Heddon\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nPhonographic Copyright ℗ – Compassion International\n\nCopyright © – Compassion International\n\nDistributed By – Sparrow/Star Song Distribution\n\nDistributed By – Sparrow/Star Song Distribution\n\nPublished By – Stonehillian Music\n\nPublished By – Word Music, Inc.\n\nPublished By – Undone Tunes\n\nPublished By – Screen Gems-EMI Music Inc.\n\nPublished By – MCA Music\n\nPublished By – His Eyes Music\n\nPublished By – John Andrew Schreiner Music\n\nPublished By – Medicine Hat Music\n\nPublished By – Norman J. Clayton Publishing Co.\n\nGlass Mastered at – Nimbus, Virginia\n\nThis is the third album from Rick and his first with Sparrow records. We get a hint of bad things to come from Ric as he transitioned to a more Easy Listening sound. I’m not saying Easy Listening is bad, I’m just saying if you were a fan of Rick’s at this point you probably weren’t a fan of his later work. That said there are still some great Rock & Roll tunes on this album. Probably the best track on the album is “Don’t Say Suicide” as it was a bit of a touchy subject and I’ll be honest I loved songs that talked to their listeners. Maybe just maybe this song prevented a self deletion. Relatively unknown guitarist Jock Guthrie does a great job on the track. I also quite liked the title track as it had a more of a early 80’s rock feel. anyway this is a good Pop Rock album with some good guitar work. Definitely a must listen to from the era.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Don’t Say Suicide – 3:30\n\n2 – You’re My Road – 3:54\n\n3 – One Child In Pain – 3:40\n\n4 – We Are The Chosen – 3:51\n\n5 – You’ve Only Got One Life – 3:40\n\n6 – House Calls – 3:14\n\n7 – Runaway – 3:33\n\n8 – We Are Yours – 3:22\n\n9 – The Old Man – 4:12\n\n10 – Cant’ Stop – 3:07\n\nCredits\n\nJeff Balding – Engineer\n\nNiles Borop – Songwriter\n\nBarbara Catanzaro – Background Vocals\n\nLisa Cates – Percussion\n\nBuz Cua – Guitar\n\nDiane Cua – Songwriter\n\nRick Cua – Producer, Songwriter, Bass, Vocals\n\nRon DeRollo – Guitar\n\nDavid Dix – Drums\n\nRob Frazier – Background Vocals\n\nJock Guthrie – Guitar, Background Vocals\n\nBob Halligan, Jr. – Producer, Songwriter, Keyboards, Guitars, Background Vocals\n\nJim Horn – Saxophone\n\nRichard Langford – Background Vocals\n\nDwight Liles – Songwriter\n\nChris McCollum – Engineer\n\nMike Mead – Drums, Background Vocals\n\nDino Pastin – Synthesizer Programming\n\nJanna Pastin – Background Vocals\n\nDave Perkins – Songwriter, Engineer, Guitar, Background Vocals\n\nBrett Perry – Assistant Engineer\n\nSam Tritico – Synthesizer Programming\n\nWendy Waldman – Duet (We Are Yours)\n\nPeter York – Guitar\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nProduced For – Koo-Ah Productions\n\nRecorded At – Gold Mine Studio\n\nRecorded At – Oak Hill Assembly\n\nSometimes these Sparrow samplers bewildered me and this one is one of them. How you can have Rez Band, Steve Taylor, and John Michael Talbot on the same sampler? I well remember us buying these samplers for 1 or 2 tracks and I bet a lot of people bought this one with the same intent. Anyway below I have listed all the tracks and their associated albums;\n\n1 – Steve Camp – Help Is On The Way – Shake Me To Wake Me\n\n2 – Connie Scott – Spirit Mover – Spirit Mover\n\n3 – Silverwind – I’m Gonna Follow You – I’m Gonna Follow You\n\n4 – Rick Cua – You’ve Only Got One Life – You’re My Road\n\n5 – Steve Taylor – I Just Wanna Know – On The Fritz\n\n6 – Michael Card – Come To The Table – Known By The Scars\n\n7 – Terry Talbot – Mighty Rushing Wind – Face To Face\n\n8 – AD – The Only Way To Have A Friend – Art Of The State\n\n9 – Debby Boone – Teach Me How To Love – Choose Life\n\n10 – Phil Driscoll – Jesus I Love You – Power Of Praise\n\n11 – Wendy & Mary – Around The Walls – Battle Of The Heart\n\n12 – Sheila Walsh – Light Across The World – Don’t Hide Your Heart\n\n13 – Rez Band – Souls For Hire – Hostage\n\n14 – Michele Pillar – Look Who Loves You Now – Look Who Loves You Now\n\n15 – Steve Green – Praise To The King – He Holds The Keys\n\n16 – John Michael Talbot – Lord Every Nation On Earth Shall Adore You\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Steve Camp – Help Is On The Way – 4:03\n\n2 – Connie Scott – Spirit Mover – 3:20\n\n3 – Silverwind – I’m Gonna Follow You – 2:59\n\n4 – Rick Cua – You’ve Only Got One Life – 3:37\n\n5 – Steve Taylor – I Just Wanna Know – 4:37\n\n6 – Michael Card – Come To The Table – 3:48\n\n7 – Terry Talbot – Mighty Rushing Wind – 4:11\n\n8 – AD – The Only Way To Have A Friend – 4:15\n\n9 – Debby Boone – Teach Me How To Love – 4:15\n\n10 – Phil Driscoll – Jesus I Love You – 4:36\n\n11 – Wendy & Mary – Around The Walls – 3:17\n\n12 – Sheila Walsh – Light Across The World – 3:23\n\n13 – Rez Band – Souls For Hire – 3:30\n\n14 – Michele Pillar – Look Who Loves You Now – 3:18\n\n15 – Steve Green – Praise To The King – 2:31\n\n16 – John Michael Talbot – Lord Every Nation On Earth Shall Adore You (Psalm 72) – 4:14\n\nThis was Rick’s first album after the formation of his new label “United Christian Alliance”. Well technically he did release a compilation album first but I generally don’t classify compilation albums the same. Unfortunately the label didn’t appear to have been a success having only ever signed one artist, Morgan Cryar, and only to a one album deal. I am assuming Rick was seeing the decline of the CCM market and thought he could step in and help but alas the industry was in a decline that was not within artists reach to fix. Rick also produced this album and did a real good job. If the industry hadn’t been tailing off I think he could have done some real good production work. The album itself is pretty good but suffered from lack of distribution. I hadn’t heard any of Rick’s later work and I was pleasantly surprised. It’s a good pop rock album and had the industry been healthier it likely would have had a few singles. “Build A Bridge” definitely would have been a fan favorite and a top 40 single.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Italo Americano – 4:17\n\n2 – Never Give Up – 4:07\n\n3 – High Country – 3:57\n\n4 – Slow Salin’ – 4:32\n\n5 – Build A Bridge – 3:26\n\n6 – Brothers & Sisters – 3:52\n\n7 – Whenever I – 2:59\n\n8 – Can’t Come Down – 3:28\n\n9 – I Know You’ll Be There – 4:08\n\n10 – Bull By The Horns – 4:05\n\n11 – Italo Americano (Reprise) – 0:49\n\nCredits\n\nLeonard Ahlstrom – Songwriter\n\nLarry Arlotta – Piano\n\nMike Caputy – Drums\n\nChris Carmichael – Violin, Cello\n\nGeorge Cocchini – Guitars\n\nRick Cua – Producer, Songwriter, Bass, Vocals\n\nTony DeCrescenzo – Translation\n\nBob Halligan, Jr. – Songwriter, Background Vocals\n\nRobert White Johnson – Background Vocals\n\nAndreas Krause – Technical Assistance\n\nTom Lane – Acoustic Guitar\n\nRandy Leroy – Mastered\n\nRuss Long – Engineer, Mixed\n\nPhil Madeira – B3\n\nWill McFarlane – Guitars\n\nTerry McMillan – Harmonica\n\nMike Mead – Drums\n\nDino Pastin – Accordion\n\nDave Perkins – Engineer, Guitars\n\nEmedin Rivera – Percussion\n\nPino Squillace – Translation\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nPhonographic Copyright (p) – Salt Incorporated Music, Inc.\n\nCopyright (c) – Salt Incorporated Music, Inc.\n\nRecorded At – Dave’s Garden Of Eden\n\nRecorded At – The Carport\n\nMixed At – The Carport\n\nMastered At – Final Stage Mastering\n\nIn 1986 Randy woke up his recording sessions and brought us back to a sound he was always good at. Randy can create a rock concert just by showing up, and for the Wild Frontier, he showed up. Side 1 starts off with a slough of tracks that are almost Springsteen-esque but since we remember Randy’s roots from Welcome To Paradise in 1976, we know he was always capable of this. The Wild Frontier is in some ways a triumphant return. Side 2 is a little more of Randy’s personal style, but still much edgier than the two albums that he released before this one. DA’s Jerry Chamberlain provides guitar for this album, and a most of the other musicians are his familiar band-mates. Rick Cua plays bass on some tracks, as does Dave Perkins, who also produced the album. Tom Howard is on keys as usual, as well as Rob Watson.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – The Wild Frontier – 4:12\n\n2 – Here Come The Big Guitars – 3:45\n\n3 – The Dying Breed – 4:21\n\n4 – Words On The Wind – 5:47\n\n5 – What’s My Line – 3:13\n\n6 – What Do You Want From Life – 3:54\n\n7 – Get Together – 3:54\n\n8 – Defender – 3:05\n\n9 – Evangeline – 5:45\n\n10 – Hope Of Glory – 4:55\n\nCredits\n\nAcoustic Guitar – Dave Perkins, Randy Stonehill\n\nArranged By [Brass Arrangement] – Tom Howard\n\nArt Direction [Cover Art Direction], Design – Roland Young\n\nBacking Vocals – Chris Harris (2), Dave Perkins, Gary Chapman, Jerry Chamberlain, Peter Case, Peter Noone, Tonio K.\n\nBass Guitar – Dave Perkins, Rick Cua\n\nContractor [Horn Contractor] – John Lunden\n\nDrums – Mike Mead\n\nElectric Guitar – Dave Perkins, Jerry Chamberlain, Jerry McPherson, Randy Stonehill\n\nEngineer [Additional Engineering] – Malcolm Harper\n\nEngineer [Engineered By] – Dave Perkins, Dave Schober\n\nEngineer [Second Engineers] – Bob Salcedo, Casey McMackin, Dan Garcia, Gene Ford, Jon Ingoldsby, Matt Freeman\n\nExecutive-Producer – Ray Ware\n\nKeyboards – Reese “Mr. B-3” Wynans\n\nMastered By – Bernie Grundman\n\nMixed By – Dave Perkins, David Schober, Randy Stonehill\n\nPercussion – Alex MacDougall, Dave Perkins, Keith Edwards\n\nPhotography By [Cover Photography] – Howard Rosenberg\n\nProducer [Produced By] – Dave Perkins\n\nProgrammed By [Programmer] – Peter Robb\n\nSynthesizer – Dave Perkins, Rob Watson, Tom Howard\n\nVocals – Randy Stonehill\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nPhonographic Copyright (p) – Word, Inc.\n\nCopyright (c) – Word, Inc.\n\nManufactured By – Word, Inc.\n\nRecorded At – Music Grinder Studios\n\nRecorded At – The Reelsound Truck\n\nRecorded At – Bill Schnee Studios\n\nRecorded At – Whitefield Studios\n\nMixed At – Mama Jo’s\n\nPressed By – DADC – DIDX-010665\n\nPublished By – Stonehillian Music\n\nPublished By – Word Music\n\nPublished By – Undone Tunes\n\nPublished By – Irving Music, Inc.\n\nThis was Rick’s 5th album and his first with Reunion records. It is rumoured that Rick was a very diligent negotiator with his record deals so I think we can assume this album was a good earner for him. That said this album unfortunately falls into “that Cua album with that song” category. I don’t feel that way as I think this is a very good album. Furthermore this album introduced Rick to the CCM magazine charts. “Forever Yours” made it to #5 and “For The Love Of God” to #25. Now it almost goes without saying that these are not the best tracks on the album. My personal favourite is Hard Times which was written with Dino and John Elefante. Personally I love the female vocal (scream) at 22 seconds, it feels like we’re about to hear a metal song but alas it’s a good Rock & Roll tune in which you can definitely feel the Elefante brothers influence. To sum it up a great album, perhaps not his best but I still think it’s great.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Hard Times – 4:43\n\n2 – Can’t Stand Too Tall – 3:45\n\n3 – Tunnel Vision – 4:08\n\n4 – For The Love Of God – 5:31\n\n5 – Reckless Faith – 4:43\n\n6 – Crash The Party – 3:42\n\n7 – We Are All The Same – 3:56\n\n8 – Shakedown – 4:07\n\n9 – Forever Yours – 4:01\n\nCredits\n\nJoey Cigainero – Programming\n\nRick Cua – Songwriter, Bass, Vocals\n\nBill Deaton – Engineer, Mixed\n\nNick Distefano – Songwriter\n\nDino Elefante – Songwriter\n\nJohn Elefante – Songwriter\n\nMichael English – Background Vocals\n\nRob Frazier – Songwriter, Background Vocals\n\nBob Halligan, Jr. – Songwriter, Background Vocals\n\nVicki Hampton – Background Vocals\n\nChris Harris – Songwriter, Background Vocals\n\nMark Heimermann – Songwriter, Background Vocals\n\nRon Hemby – Duet Vocals (For the Love of God)\n\nTom Hemby – Producer, Songwriter, Arrangements, Programming, Guitar\n\nTerry Hemmings – Executive Producer\n\nWayne Kirkpatrick – Songwriter\n\nMary Lee Kortes – Songwriter\n\nCarl Marsh – Fairlight\n\nDonna McElroy – Background Vocals\n\nMike Mead – Drums, Percussion\n\nJeff Moseley – Executive Producer\n\nDenny Purcell – Mastered\n\nChris Rodriguez – Background Vocals\n\nRon Sorbo – Percussion\n\nKeith Thomas – Songwriter, Synthesizers\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nPhonographic Copyright (p) – Reunion Records\n\nCopyright (c) – Reunion Records\n\nManufactured By – A&M Records\n\nDistributed By – A&M Records\n\nRecorded At – Gold Mine Studio\n\nRecorded At – 16th Avenue Sound\n\nRecorded By – Down Stage\n\nRecorded At – Digital Recorders\n\nRecorded At – Reflections\n\nRecorded At – OmniSound Studios\n\nThis was the 4th album from Whitecross and it is a great Rock & Roll album. If you just started listening to it may I suggest you turn it up to 12. It’s just my opinion but I think this is their best album. Scott Wenzel’s vocals are outstanding but I’m pretty sure the tour for this album must have destroyed his vocal cords. Rex Carroll’s guitar stands out as usual, he really was one of the best guitarists in the Hard Rock/Metal Christian scene. The surprise of the album is that Rick Cua plays bass on all but one track. I was really surprised to read this and a part of me really doesn’t know if it’s actually true but wow. I respected him before but my opinion of him just went up a notch. The album reached number 13 on Billboard’s Top Contemporary Christian Albums chart and actually won a Dove award for Hard Music Album of the Year.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Attention Please – 3:55\n\n2 – Red Light – 4:32\n\n3 – Straight Thru The Heart – 3:57\n\n4 – Down – 4:01\n\n5 – Behold – 4:35\n\n6 – Shakedown – 4:16\n\n7 – Flashpoint – 1:30\n\n8 – Simple Man – 4:21\n\n9 – Over The Top – 4:18\n\n10 – Heaven’s Calling Tonight – 4:16\n\nCredits\n\nBacking Vocals [Additional] – Caroline Nieto, Jonathan Pagano\n\nBass – Rick Cua (tracks: 1,2, 4-10)\n\nBass, Vocals – Rick Armstrong (tracks: 3)\n\nDrums – Frank Liva\n\nDrums, Vocals – Mike Elliot\n\nGuitar, Vocals, Producer – Rex Carroll\n\nKeyboards – George Small\n\nLead Vocals – Scott Wenzel\n\nProducer – Joey Powers\n\nAnother great production by Dave Perkins makes this a great Rock & Roll album. Excellent guitar riffs and shout along choruses make you want to turn this album up to 12. This was (in my opinion) the peak of Ric’s Rock & Roll style. His stuff after this is good but he started to turn the dial down after this album. The first single and title track is a fantastic arena rock song that will have you singing along. Point of trivia is that Rob Frazier did some background vocals on the album.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Wear Your Colors – 3:53\n\n2 – Flex – 3:27\n\n3 – This Raging Fire – 3:50\n\n4 – Hungry – 3:22\n\n5 – Lemme At ‘Em – 3:36\n\n6 – Got The Rock – 3:03\n\n7 – Unchained – 3:41\n\n8 – Nightfall – 4:02\n\n9 – Hats Off To You – 3:06\n\n10 – Line Of Fire – 4:10\n\nCredits\n\nLarry Arlotta – Keyboards\n\nGeorge Cocchini – Songwriter, Guitars\n\nRick Cua – Songwriter, Bass, Vocals\n\nRon DeRollo – Additional Engineer, Guitars\n\nRob Frazier – Background Vocals\n\nLynn Fuston – Engineer\n\nTommy Greer – Keyboards\n\nBob Halligan, Jr. – Songwriter, Keyboards, Background Vocals\n\nDave Hanlon – Percussion\n\nMalcolm Harper – Engineer\n\nJB Baird – Additional Engineer\n\nGlen Marchese – Additional Engineer\n\nDon Martell – Additional Engineer\n\nChris McCollum – Additional Engineer\n\nMike Mead – Drums, Percussion\n\nDino Pastin – Keyboards\n\nDave Perkins – Producer, Songwriter, Engineer, Guitars, Keyboards, Synthesizers, Background Vocals\n\nMarc Ribler – Songwriter, Guitars\n\nDavid Schober – Engineer\n\nDave Shirley – Additional Engineer\n\nJohn Sinclair – Keyboards\n\nChad Welling – Synthesizers\n\nShawn Welling – Background Vocals\n\nNo Mystery is the second solo album from Rick after his departure from the Outlaws. His first solo album was very well received and received pretty good airplay on Christian radio. While nothing on this album singled on the CCM charts apparently there were a couple charting singles on the more rock oriented charts which unfortunately I can’t find an archive of. Guest guitarist on this album was Ian Bairnson from Alan Parsons Project. My personal picks from the album are High School Reunion and A.S.S.E.F.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – He Lives In Me – 3:55\n\n2 – One Way Out – 4:37\n\n3 – Changed – 3:54\n\n4 – Just Visiting – 4:10\n\n5 – The Power – 3:10\n\n6 – High School Reunion – 3:22\n\n7 – Create In Me A Heart – 4:18\n\n8 – A.S.S.E.F. – 2:52\n\n9 – Bright Light – 3:17\n\n10 – Help Me Out – 4:14\n\nCredits\n\nBacking Vocals – Bob Halligan, Jr., Diana Cua (tracks: A3), Rick Cua\n\nCover – Buddy Jackson\n\nDrums – David Dix\n\nEngineer, Mixed By – Don Martell, Johnnie Schinas\n\nExecutive-Producer – Ray Nenow\n\nGuitar – Freddie Salem, Ian Bairnson, Ron DeRollo\n\nIllustration – Buddy Jackson\n\nLead Guitar – Buz Cua (tracks: B5)\n\nLead Vocals, Bass Guitar, Producer – Rick Cua\n\nMastered By – John Skinner\n\nPhotography By – Mark Tucker\n\nPiano – Bob Halligan, Jr.\n\nProgrammed By [Synthesizer] – Don Martell, Ed Vivenzio\n\nSynthesizer – Andy Richards (tracks: A5), Bob Halligan, Jr."
