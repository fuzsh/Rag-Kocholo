Written By Oliver Stone and starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant who quickly rises to power in Miami's drug underworld, is a neon-soaked vision of 80s excess. Struggling to balance power with paranoia, Tony finds out that holding on to his newfound empire is harder than building it, and he must be willing to do the unthinkable to keep it safe within his grip.\n\nView Event →\n\nHundreds of Beavers\n\nThe film industry’s biggest cult hit of the year has invaded Cinema Underground!

The surrounding film, a deeply spiritual work from a filmmaker attempting to rediscover his country’s once-utopian wonder, follows two young sisters whose mother is recovering from illness. In moving to be closer to the hospital, they find escape in their new house’s surrounding forests, where a community of spirits whisk them away on exciting adventures.\n\nView Event →\n\nAmy\n\nMoving and tragic in equal measure, Amy chronicles Amy Winehouse’s short but singular career.

Unflinchingly honest but never exploitative, Amy honors one of music’s lost icons by telling her story with authenticity and vulnerability.\n\nOther showtimes:\n\nAugust 19 at 8:30 PM\n\nView Event →\n\nAmy\n\nMoving and tragic in equal measure, Amy chronicles Amy Winehouse’s short but singular career.

After two years in hiding, Psycho Gun-wielding bounty hunter Cobra is brought back into the fray by Jane Flowers, a fellow hunter who believes he is the only one who can help save her two lost sisters. Filled with hilarious writing and fast-paced action, this psychedelic sci-fi romp is anchored by its protagonist’s Han Solo-meets-James Bond swagger.\n\nView Event →\n\nAraya\n\nPoetry on celluloid. Praised as being a harbinger of Latin feminist cinema, Margot Benacerraf’s landmark film depicts salt laborers in Venezuela.

Meanwhile, a resistance plots to sabotage the race as an act of defiance against “Mr. President” and his regime. Outlandishly campy and violent, Roger Corman's uproarious screenplay set a standard for the explosion of grindhouse films in the 1970s.\n\nView Event →\n\nBoard Game Night\n\nA weekly casual gathering in the Atrium of the 100-year old Williams Center of Rutherford, NJ.

An IMAX film for the ears, PAKT takes its listeners on an improvised sonic voyage with no preconceived destination, minimal pre-planning and little use for forms and conventions. Rare is the musician who can thrive in such a spontaneous environment but Percy Jones (fretless bass guitar), Alex Skolnick (guitar), Kenny Grohowski (drums) and Tim Motzer (guitar and electronics) are all up to the task. Armed with enough tastefully used effects to stock a small music store, Motzer and Skolnick create sounds so atmospheric and ethereal that one might not guess their source is a guitar. Meanwhile, Grohowski and Jones approach their instruments in textural manners that seamlessly intertwine with each other and the quartet as a whole. The music runs the gamut from highly sensitive to intense, with all four musicians’ listening skills so strong that their collective playing is as cohesive as it is unpredictable. Welsh bassist Jones (now a New York resident) is known for his tenure in the legendary jazz fusion group Brand X (whose classic lineup included drummer Phil Collins, yes that one) and extensive studio work (especially with Brian Eno). Skolnick is a diverse improviser whose jazz and world playing and instrumental associations (including bass virtuosos Stuart Hamm and Michael Manring) forms a Jeckyll & Hyde dynamic with his high profile as lead guitarist of the metal band Testament. Grohowski's many recent associations include John Zorn, a reincarnated version of Brand X and masked avant-metal outfit, Imperial Triumphant. Motzer has a long background in free improvisation, including the bands Bandit65 (with fellow guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel) and Orion Tango, plus many other recorded collaborations for his 1k Recordings label.\n\nJane Getter Premonition has carved out a niche at the intersection of jazz, metal, rock and singer-songwriter with masterful playing of Getter’s “complex, sophisticated, and dynamic” compositions (All About Jazz). On tour, JGP has dazzled audiences at ProgStock, Outreach Music Festival (Austria), San Francisco Jazz Festival, bFlat Bar (India), Guitar City (Poland), Borderline (UK), North Sea Jazz Club (Netherlands) Iridium, and opened for Allan Holdsworth and Brand X. According to the ProgReport, JGP is “a stunning prog rock/jazz fusion outfit reminiscent of stylistic darlings like King Crimson and The Mahavishnu Orchestra”. The all-star band is led by guitarist, singer and award winning composer Jane Getter and features keyboardist Adam Holzman (Miles Davis, Steven Wilson), guitarist Alex Skolnick (Testament, Trans-Siberian Orchestra), Rutherford resident bassist and singer Paul Frazier (David Byrne, Nile Rodgers) and drummer Gene Lake (David Sanborn, Nile Rodgers and Chic).\n\nView Event →\n\nOffice Hours: A Roundtable Discussion for Rounding Out Ideas\n\nWilliams Center Presents:\n\n'Office Hours: A Roundtable Discussion for Rounding Out Ideas'\n\nDo you feel like you have an idea for a script / book / poem / song, and you just don't know how to get it off the ground?

Cursed to live with a pig’s head, he remains on the run from government forces while taking down local pirates, that is until a new pilot challenges him to a dogfight that forces him to confront his past. As much a showcase for Miyazaki’s knowledge of period aircraft as it is a rebuke of fascism, Porco Rosso is a lesser-seen gem in Miyazaki’s filmography.\n\nView Event →\n\nOn the Bowery\n\nAmerican neorealist Lionel Rogosin documents three days in the drinking life of Ray Salyer, a railroad worker, as he passes from bar, to church, to homeless shelter in New York’s Bowery community.

Instead, a then-young but still experienced animator, Tomomi Mochizuki, was tapped to direct this high school romance about two friends, Taku and Yutaka, who befriend and eventually develop feelings for the same transfer student, Rikako. Naturally, tensions flare between the trio, however the film’s impressionistic animation makes for a subtle, moving drama that stands in contrast to the genre’s mostly melodramatic fare.\n\nView Event →\n\nFilmmaking Workshop with Gerard Amsellam\n\nJoin us for our 2-hour introduction to filmmaking documentary workshop.

Dancing in 7/8, indeed, is left to fans who are accustomed to calculating high math in their heads. It’s easy to assume — because even the massive force of Apple Music doesn’t feature a decent Prog option — that the genre is dead. Alas, the Internet is largely credited for bringing together Prog’s most loyal and growing fandom.\n\nThis three-day volunteer-run festival was founded to solve a few positive problems. First, even though a handful of fun Prog gatherings exist around the globe, artists are eager to play in the Northeast United States during the autumn months, where and when not much else in Prog circles takes place. Second, we know that Prog fans are seeking a comfortable, classy venue to see their favorite bands perform. Add in a great arts-friendly environment that’s close to a huge airport and regional rail transportation…and that’s most of ProgStock’s story. The only thing we need for this to be complete is…You! And with you, there will be much rejoicing at The American Northeast’s Only International Progressive Rock Festival, ProgStock.\n\nWe are incredibly pleased to bring this festival to you together with our partners at the House of Prog Internet Radio station, and the NJProghouse Progressive Music Series. We are enormously grateful for their support for, endorsement of, and participation in this Herculean endeavor.\n\nVisit 2024 Schedule Here | Check 2024 Artists Here\n\nView Event →\n\nRocco and His Brothers\n\nClocking in at over three hours, this epic Italian family drama went on to influence Italian-American directors like Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese.
