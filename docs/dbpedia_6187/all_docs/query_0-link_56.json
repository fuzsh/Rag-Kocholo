        "text": "By John Lyle Belden\n\nI’ll never forget the moment a few years ago during a show when Claire Wilcher shouted, “That just happened!” as she rolled with the comic chaos, ever one of this city’s biggest talents.\n\nAs the Phoenix Theatre Cultural Center sought to revive its traditional “Very Phoenix Xmas,” it was entrusted to Wilcher, who directed and wrote the whole show with “& Friends,” which include costars Shawnte P. Gaston, Carlos Medina Maldonado, and Ben Asaykwee, who co-wrote songs with her. Putting aside lame wordplay (for a moment) this is simply, “A Very Phoenix Xmas Returns: The Return of the Very Phoenix Xmas.”\n\nYeah, it’s happening.\n\nA quick warning: In the edgy spirit of the Phoenix Theatre, there are a fair number of F-bombs dropped among the fake snowflakes, though as usual nothing blasphemous for this holy season. This fun is for high schoolers and older.\n\nThe overall theme is Christmas season in central Indiana, with some comic shots taken at traditions including the IRT “Christmas Carol,” the Symphony’s “Yuletide Celebration,” and the Carmel Christkindlmarkt. To start the second half of the show, we even get a look at actual Yelp reviews for local attractions.\n\nBetween scenes, we get “greetings” from various Hoosiers throughout history, from Col. Eli Lilly to Madam C.J. Walker to Kurt Vonnegut. (And by the way, Claire, Wendy and I have always called that freeway “the Babyface.”)\n\nAll four have their moments to shine, including Gaston as an infamous billionaire, Maldonado and his “box dance,” and Asaykwee as a disaffected member of whatever today’s generation is called. Order the theme cocktail before the show or at intermission, and you, too, can be part of the performance!\n\nOnce again, the Phoenix balances engaging in tradition with thumbing its nose at it. This ‘Xmas’ is fresh, funny, heartfelt, and entertaining with deftly delivered satire and all the feelings – from fun to frustration – of the holiday season.\n\nPerformances run through Dec. 23 at 705 N. Illinois St., downtown Indianapolis. Get tickets at phoenixtheatre.org. And at the show, tell Gustav we said “Hi.”\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nIt’s that time of year, when many of us have been, or had to put up with, houseguests.\n\nIn a small Ohio city in early December 1939, Sheridan Whiteside – famed writer, lecturer, radio personality, and the toast of any town – visited the home of factory owner Ernest Stanley. It was to be only for dinner, but a slip on a patch of ice left the injured celebrity guest recovering at the Stanley home for the rest of the month.\n\nThis fictional incident is the basis for “The Man Who Came To Dinner,” a comedy that Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman based on numerous showbiz personalities whom they knew. This play comes to life in Noblesville courtesy of The Belfry Theatre, directed by Eric Matters.\n\nTwo weeks into his convalescence, Whiteside (Robert C. Boston Jr.) decides to take charge of the Stanleys’ living room for his business needs, threatening to increase the amount of his pending lawsuit against Mr. and Mrs. Stanley (Tom Smith and Kim O’Mara) if they don’t yield. As for the hosts, he is more than fed up while she is still a bit starstruck. Ernest’s sister Harriet Stanley (Janet Borcherding) regards their guest with a strange fascination.\n\nWhile “Sherri” Whiteside is an absolute pill to the elder Stanleys, as well as Dr. Bradley (Gene Burnett) and nurse Miss Preen (Chloe Vann), he is friendly to the nearly-grown Stanley children June (Anabella Lazarides) and Richard (Jericho Franke), as well as the butler John (Aaron Budde) and talented cook Sarah (Grace McKinnies). Faithful secretary Maggie Cutler (Amanda Falcone) seems immune to his verbal jabs and handles work details which mainly involve frequent contact with numerous celebrities. Aside from the characters written to appear in the play, an avalanche of real names from the era are dropped throughout the show.\n\nLocal newspaper reporter Bert Jefferson (Eric Dixon) matches Whiteside in a verbal joust, earning respect and an interview, and entry to Maggie’s heart. As it turns out, Jefferson is also a promising playwright.\n\nThe plot then largely turns on Whiteside’s efforts to keep the local journalist from taking his secretary, involving various showbiz people who come by the house including ambitious actress Lorraine Sheldon (Hannah Partridge), suave acclaimed actor Beverly Carlton (Drake Walker Smith), and Marx Brother-inspired comic Banjo (Daniel Dale Clymer). Some actors take more than one role; Melissa Reid rounds out the cast. A few children (unlisted in the program) make a cameo.\n\nAdd to all the human foibles the presence of a “Roach City” in the living room, an octopus in the basement, and penguins in the library, and you have the fun makings for a classic comedy, a rather unique take on the Christmas season.\n\nBoston excellently portrays Whiteside much like a wily housecat, presenting charming softness or sharp claws (or both) to any person he wishes, with engaging wit that makes his personal celebrity and connections believable. Falcone presents a savvy sweetness that is endearing and worthy of respect. Dixon convincingly plays intelligent with unflappable Midwest charm. Partridge is a force of nature as a B-list actor feeling entitled to A-plus accommodations.\n\nThis wild and entertaining farce with sly insight into the rich and famous of the mid-20th century has another weekend, Thursday, Nov. 30, through Sunday, Dec. 3, at Noblesville United Methodist Church, 2051 Monument St. (enter on the west side of the building), Noblesville. For info and tickets, visit thebelfrytheatre.com.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nFootlite Musicals is an all-volunteer organization, and it’s in that spirit of community that, rather than a single-story musical, everyone pitches in on a singing revue with aspects of Radio City Spectacular to create a familiar-feeling yet new holiday celebration, “A Footlite Family Holiday.”\n\nYou know this is going to be a little different when the first singer enters crooning “Pure Imagination” from Willy Wonka. However, after this invocation of holiday whimsy and magic, we get a variety of old favorites, carols, and newer songs of the season – from traditional, to Irving Berlin, to Pentatonix – performed with the Footlite pit orchestra, acapella, and even one number with kazoos. There is plenty of swaying and dancing with numerous costume changes, trees, a train, an audience sing-along (lyrics provided), and a sacred moment.\n\nNods are given to different celebrations: Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, and, at most performances, a tribute to Diwali presented by Indy Bollywood Group (Sana Suresh Kumar, Deeya Jain, Haleigh Lincey, Usha Sirimalle, Raaga Yoga, and Tamara Yoga).\n\nFor additional artistic flair, there are a couple of impressive moments with aerialist Molly Campbell performing above the stage on silks.\n\nIt seems that nearly everyone else does a little of everything – some of the singers dance, some of the dancers sing – so I’m hard pressed to give any single credits. Here’s how the program lists the ensemble: Featured singers Anya Andrews, Zach Bucher, Aprille Goodman, Logan Laflin, Carolyn Lynch, Leigh Query, Danny Roberds; featured kick-line dancers Renee Callahan, Claire Gray, Bailey Ray Harmon, Paige Penry, Megan Raymont, Lindsey Schaecher, Ashley Sherman, Amelie Zirnheld; ensemble players Susan Bott, Jeremy Crouch, Jarred Harris, Jenn Kaufmann, Nancy Laudeman, Nicole MacLean, Libby Munson, Grace Rehmel, Lydia Rivers, Chris Vojtko, Sparrow the Poodle, youngsters Elsie Daunhauer and Leo Daunhauer (who appears as a breakdancing Elf on the Shelf); and, at least during the first act, Santa Claus himself.\n\nWhile the format is familiar, this particular collection of songs and performances stands apart, making it a fresh entertaining addition to local holiday traditions. Join the “Footlite Family Holiday” through Dec. 3 at 1847 N. Alabama St., Indianapolis. Get tickets and info at footlite.org.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nIf contentious family members join you for the holidays, just be glad there’s not the inheritance of a European empire on the line.\n\nIn “The Lion in Winter,” by James Goldman, King Henry II of England – and a whole lot more – is spending Christmas in his castle at Chinon, in one of his French lands (the King of France only controlled a fraction of what is in its borders today). His mistress is a sister of the French King, who is also invited; two of his three sons present had not long before led a rebellion against him (during which another son, the heir Young Henry, died) with the third son, his favorite, a whiny spoiled brat; meanwhile, estranged wife Eleanor of Aquitaine (perhaps the era’s most powerful and influential woman) has been let out of her dungeon for the holiday.\n\nSouthbank Theatre Company presents this classic drama with catty comic overtones, directed by Becky Schlomann. A stellar local cast take the stage: Doug Powers presents the stubborn confidence of Henry, ever showing the clever, calculating mind that helped win and keep an empire, but his willingness to use love and relationships as weapons has cost him any family unity. Miranda Nehrig as young Alais shares his bed but, she fears, not his heart, as she realizes her place in the nobility is imperiled the longer she stays unmarried – and eventually to whom she is wed, she has no control.\n\nThe three sons couldn’t be more different: Richard (Thomas Sebald) is all about war and fighting, and truly a man’s man. Geoffrey (Jo Bennett) is highly intelligent, charming, and conniving – which means no one is trusting him with the crown. Then there’s John (Garrett Rowe), a teenager, but really, the baby of the family.\n\nJean Arnold is a complete fox – beautiful and sly – as Eleanor. With expression and bearing that hints she’s always a chess move or two ahead, she easily matches Henry in their battle of wits.\n\nKaya Dorsch is impressive as Philip II of France. The young king recently succeeded his father, whom he saw as being too easily taken in by Henry’s shrewd negotiations. Though the underdog in both real power and statecraft, he’s learning quickly.\n\nAside from the gifts wrapped in pretty boxes, what everyone wants for this Christmas is resolution to issues such as control of various parts of the Angevin Empire, including who will inherit the crown from Henry. Basically, Eleanor backs Richard (which is what had gotten her under castle arrest) while the King favors John. Throughout the play schemes and maneuvers abound, with clever arguments and retorts the weapon of choice.\n\nThose who know history, or Robin Hood legends, know who will eventually prevail as King in a few years. However, we – and others in the audience – couldn’t help but reference Disney’s “Robin Hood” for the portrayal here of Prince John. Rowe’s tantrums are so epically immature we expected him to pop his thumb in his mouth like the film’s animated lion.\n\nIf you were unaware of this show, but the plotline seems familiar, note it is also the basis for the television series “Empire” (Cookie Lyon = Eleanor). If you are missing that drama, you will find a similar sassy spirit here.\n\nPerformances of “Lion in Winter” are Thursday through Sunday, Nov. 16-19, at Shelton Auditorium, 1000 W. 42nd St., in the southwest corner of the Butler University campus. Get info and tickets at southbanktheatre.org.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nAfter many delays, Monument Theatre Company finally brings “Elephant,” by Lewis Morrow, to the stage.\n\nThe workplace comedy tackles serious topics as a diverse team of employees anticipate a visit from the new CEO. They work in an unspecified occupation that involves customer service and measurable performance, both of which are important numbers to continued employment and advancement.\n\nKing of both metrics is Marcus (Kass Dowell), a proud Black man who feels a little stung by being passed over for promotion to the team supervisor. Mayra (Yolanda Valdivia), a Latina who likes to give opinions but not make waves, says she understands his complaint but that Clarissa, the white woman who got the job, was more involved with teammates. Rae (Rayanna Bibbs), a Black woman, doesn’t seem too perturbed unless it’s said there’s no racial tension involved. White guy Paulie (Brant Hughes) is late as usual, cracking wise to cover any discomfort.\n\nClarissa (Becky Larson) sweeps in, chipper as ever, and soon talks about the team’s presentation for the CEO, which she has composed. This is, in reference to the play’s title, the “Elephant in the room” that must be addressed. It turns out a different animal’s representation is involved, and the entire team explodes in their reaction – especially Marcus, who has to leave the room to control his rage.\n\nDirected by Dowell, this play hits on many topics of unacknowledged privilege and racial offense, as well as sexism and toxic workplace secrets. As it turns out, the room has a whole herd of pachyderms to unpack.\n\nVerbal barbs are slung among all the members of the group, reminiscent of ensemble squabbles like “…Virginia Woolf,” with each giving as good as they get. It’s an exhilarating exercise for the actors, I’d guess, and fascinating to watch with this talented team. There are many intriguing points made and debated – worthy of thought long after the curtain call – and the play also includes two strategically placed personal flashbacks to give insight into stands the characters take.\n\nThomas Burak makes an appearance as a police officer, bringing a climax that’s far too relevant to events of recent years.\n\n“Elephant” has three more performances, Friday through Sunday, Nov. 17-19, on the Indy Eleven stage at the IndyFringe Theatre, 719 E. St. Clair St., Indianapolis. Get tickets at indyfringe.org. Get info at fb.com/MonumentTheatre.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nCarmel Apprentice Theatre is a resident company at, naturally, The Cat venue in downtown Carmel. Everyone who shows up for rehearsal gets a part, as well as mentored by the more experienced performers. This makes for a relaxed easy-going atmosphere on and behind the stage that translates easily to the audience. In this mode, it’s good to take on a production that welcomes aspects of the silly and unreal.\n\nCAT now presents the stage version of the musical “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” based on the book and movie by James Bond creator Ian Fleming. It originated in stories the author told his children, into which he couldn’t help but add some kid-friendly international intrigue. This translated well into the 1968 film musical starring Dick Van Dyke. Music and lyrics are by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, the story adapted by Jeremy Sams from the script by Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes.\n\nTo keep things going smoothly, stage veterans take key roles including Evan Wang as inventor Caractacus Potts, Brook-Glen Gober as sweets heiress Truly Scrumptious, Duane Leatherman as Grandpa Potts, Allison Hermann as the rebellious Vulgarian Toymaker, and Hannah Janowicz as the sinister Childcatcher. Other roles have two or even three actors in rotation, while others are in the chorus or dancers. Notable performances include Gober’s precision recreation of the music box scene, and the antics of David Ralstin and Elaine Endris as bumbling Vulgar spies Goran and Boris. Hopefully you will be at a performance with Leroy Delph, looking like a cartoonish king from a playing card, as the immature Vulgarian ruler Baron Bomburst.\n\nAnd yes, there is the car! Locally fabricated by Scott Osborn of Brown Hound Studios, “Chitty” is an excellent recreation of the movie’s automobile. Does it really float and fly? You’ll have to see for yourself, but don’t forget to say “Please!” when you ask.\n\nWill Wood directs, with Wang as music director, Ashley Thibodeau the choreographer, and Amanda Lund stage manager.\n\nFeaturing classic songs including “Toot Sweets,” “Hushabye Mountain,” “Me Ol’ Bamboo,” and, of course, the title tune, this production is as delightful as a seaside picnic by your favorite roadster. Performances are 7 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 2 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays, through Nov. 19 at The Cat, 254 Veterans Way (a couple of blocks south of Main St. in the Arts & Design District), Carmel. Get info and tickets at thecat.biz.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nWhen your happily ever after isn’t going so well, or otherwise you’re at your cottage during the day, you tune into what’s happening on the Fairy Tale Network. And in the spirit of those non-magical folk who obsess over celebrity and true crime stories, you get the eyewitness accounts of Real Talk with Fairy Tale Legends.\n\nThis is the set of “The Snow White Variety Show,” by Brian Taylore, presented by KidsPlay Inc., the Greenfield-based program for young performers in grades 3-8. Directed by founder Christine Schaefer and Amy Studabaker, with choreography by Frances Hull and stage-managed by Blair Connelly and Ethan Stearns, once again we get a fairly polished and professional production, giving us a glimpse of real budding talent mixed in with youthful exuberance, giving a show that you don’t have to be related to one of the cast to enjoy.\n\nOur Announcer (Anthony Stunda) introduces “Real Talk…”, hosted by Heidi Perbole (Ellie Stearns), who is eager to get the Grimm truth about Snow White. Seven dwarves are on hand to tell what really happened – not the seven you’ve heard of, we get Wordy (Nora Smith), Rowdy (Reid Connors), Nerdy (Charles Wallace), Weepy (Aria Studabaker), Creepy (Everett Sumpter), Howdy (Alexandria Ellis), and Bob (Asher Ortman). As is routine with “true crime” TV, all the scenes are presented on stage by reenactors, giving us characters including Snow’s parents (Kayte Reasoner and Ben Erwin), the Evil Queen (Chloe Elkins), The Huntsman (Jack Joyner), the Magic Mirror (Audra Speicher), and Snow White herself (Reese Weitekamp). As each dwarf relates a part of the story, in his or her own quirky way, the “actors” perform it in the same manner – Wordy’s bits are verbose, for instance, while Howdy’s has a cowboy flavor.\n\nEven mythical folk have to pay the bills, so the broadcast is peppered with commercials for things like the Big Bad Wolf’s (Carter Pipkin) house-flipping business, Rumpelstiltskin’s (Nora Jeter) gold investments, or Cinder-sella (Kyndall Watkins) offering you a great price on a new or used carriage (deals end at midnight). KidsPlay has posters by these “advertisers” for auction in the theater lobby.\n\nThis enchanted set also has appearances by Tanner Pipkin, Elliott Holms, Molly Wallace, Amelia Melby, Sawyer Erwin, Addalyn Torres, Abilene Kaucher, Spencer Pipkin, Essie Ortman, and Josie McConnell, in various roles.\n\nA funny and charming fresh take on a familiar story, with twists you may not expect, performances are this weekend only, Nov. 10-12 at H.J. Ricks Centre for the Arts, 122 W. Main St. (US 40) in downtown Greenfield. Tickets are still only $5 each. See info and pictures by searching “KidsPlay” on Facebook.\n\nOnyxFest is Indy’s first and only theater festival dedicated to the stories of Black playwrights. These one-act celebrations of Black life and culture are presented by IndyFringe and the Africana Repertory Theatre of IUPUI. After an initial weekend at the IndyFringe Theatre, upcoming performances are Friday through Sunday, Nov. 10-12, at historic Crispus Attucks High School, in the Auditorium at 1140 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street, Indianapolis. For information and tickets, visit OnyxFest.com.\n\nBy Wendy Carson\n\nDelores Thornton brings us the story of her mother’s life and arduous journey from Georgia to Indiana in search of a better life and freedom from the racial oppression of the South.\n\nWe first meet Babe (Leondra Radford) at the forming of a new mental health support group in the year 2000. The therapist, Dr. Davis (Chris Sears), has assembled clients who all have different issues, but have personalities that complement each other.\n\nThey include a young alcoholic wrestling with moving on with her life (Kim McMurray); a former drug addict who still gambles (Gene Howard); and Babe, of course, who has been experiencing migraines and nightmares. Thornton plays an older woman who suffers from anxiety, especially when driving.\n\nOn her own with Dr. Davis, Babe participates in several sessions of hypnosis – despite the warnings from the voices of her friends and family, neatly channeled by the spirit of her old friend Octavia (Dr. Cheryl Talley-Black, who also provides some beautiful spiritual songs that cover the scene changes).\n\nAs the show progresses – with memories from 1989, through the decades, back as far as 1922 – we are given glimpses of the traumas Babe experienced and insight into how her brain coped with this knowledge for all of these years.\n\nDirector Trease Sears does a great job of keeping each character true to their story as well as having the unenviable task of directing the author of the work itself. The play is a searing indictment of the mental toll Jim Crow and the Civil Rights struggle took on so many. Thornton hopes that this will also encourage a more open attitude among Black communities to seek help when needed.\n\nOnyxFest is Indy’s first and only theater festival dedicated to the stories of Black playwrights.

For information and tickets, visit OnyxFest.com.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nAs one might guess, the name of the title character of “Tigone,” by Levi Frazier Jr., is a reference to the mythical princess in Sophocles’ play “Antigone” (part of a trilogy with “Oedipus Rex”). That character met a tragic end while trying to act justly. In Frazier’s play, Tigonie (Michelle E. Mitchell) also seeks justice.\n\nOn a pleasant day in Memphis, a local church Bishop (Lawrence Blackwell) is relaxing on a park bench when an attractive young woman walks by with two coffees. One of them is just the way he likes it, but the significance of the coincidence doesn’t dawn on him until they are well into their conversation.\n\nAs their discussion continues and intensifies, we learn more about her, and more about him. They share a connection, and it is so much more troublesome than you would guess.\n\nMitchell and Blackwell (who also directs) keep the tension taut and the portrayals believable, riveting us to the bitter end.\n\nHow much can one leave in the past? What can be forgiven? And even if one repents, what about accountability? The exploration into these questions builds to a conclusion that would have impressed the old Greek playwright.\n\nOnyxFest is Indy’s first and only theater festival dedicated to the stories of Black playwrights.

Playwright D.L. Patrick returns us there with a look at family dynamics that ring true no matter the source.\n\nThe family Matriarch (Faye Holmes) lies in her hospital bed wondering where her daughter is, the one who, as the ambulance took her away, promised to be “Right Behind You.” Days pass, and as she slips into a coma, her consciousness gets up to look around. Family eventually visit, offering frustrated apologies for the delay, but their stays are brief due to Covid protocols. However, it is more than the virus keeping one daughter away.\n\nIn conversations and flashbacks, we see how each family member deals with both this crisis and past issues. Performed by the ensemble of Beverly Harney, LaToya Jay, Kaitlynn Nailon, Alicia Sims, and Tamara Taylor, we see the issues of multigenerational living and how caring for one another can be as much a burden as a joy – yet it all gets thrown into perspective when it’s possible Mom may never wake up.\n\nDirector Megan Simonton does an excellent job of keeping the personalities of these proud women from overshadowing each other while also keeping the interpersonal family dynamics exceedingly true-to-life.\n\nGo see “Right Behind You,” then consider visiting Grandma – maybe bring a jigsaw puzzle."
