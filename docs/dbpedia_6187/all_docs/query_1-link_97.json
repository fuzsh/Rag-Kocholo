        "text": "“Coreena Hazelett has proven again-and-again that intelligent, good-spirited people don’t necessarily need a degree or a decade of experience to succeed and become effective leaders and a credit to our world,” Barger said.\n\nIn 1998, Coreena moved to Waterman Broadcasting’s KTSA/KTFM as Traffic Director.\n\nSeeing the income earned by salespeople, she applied for a sales position with General Manager Joe Ernest and Sales Management Consultant Rex Tackett.\n\n“I counseled her not to get into sales…that time did not permit her to be trained…that there was a ‘high mortality’ rate of sales wannabes…that she would be out of a job,” Tackett said. “She persisted. So, I gave her a few books on selling Radio and access to RAB. She read them all and more. She was determined to succeed,”\n\n“Coreena is a remarkable person. In 50 years, I’ve never seen anyone have greater success learning and starting from ‘zero’. She is ‘self-taught’ more than anyone I’ve ever met,” Tackett said.\n\n“Coreena Hazelett is a credit to the radio industry. Her ‘no nonsense’ approach to broadcast advertising sales and management has provided Success (with a capitol ‘S’) for both clients and stations alike.”\n\nWithin one year, Coreena was the top biller. In two more years, she was Sales Manager. And, in that position, she survived the transition of KTSA/KTFM from Waterman to CBS Radio to Border Media to Alpha Media.\n\nRanch Radio Group’s (RRG) Mark Grubbs made two attempts to hire Coreena. Once in 2011 and again in 2015.\n\n“My offers were met with a resounding, ‘No, Thank You.’ In 2018, I tried again…with the same opening for Sales Manager. Thankfully, on July 2, 2018, Coreena joined Ranch Radio Group And, that’s when my life changed for the better,” Grubbs said.\n\nIn December 2019, Coreena was promoted to Vice President & General Manager.\n\nShe embraced all aspects of engineering and programming along with her mastery of sales and administration. She led her team to reduce a one-million-dollar debt within four years of her hire.\n\nIn 2021, RRG promoted Coreena to President and Chief Operations Officer.\n\nWith Coreena at the helm, RRG successfully launched is fifth radio station, “The Raptor – Classic Rock.”\n\nOther successes/milestones, under her leadership, include “Shop, Stay and Play” and “Hill Country Strong” (two Covid-19 economic rebound initiatives) and Hill District Stock Show Radiothon.\n\nThis Radiothon fundraising event (over the past three years) along with RRGs donations of scholarships has provided 4-H & FFA students in area counties in excess of $133,000.\n\nIn 2022-23, under Coreena’s leadership and commitment to maintaining our “Debt Free” status, a $300,000 building expansion was paid for in cash – all the while establishing a six figure Emergency Fund for the company as well as a Quarterly Employee Profit Sharing program.\n\nCoreena has experienced, fostered and provided a path for her team members to harvest the Radio industry’s promise of a viable, profitable and secure future.\n\nCoreena’s 32 years in broadcast Radio have taken her from single mother of three boys and bookkeeper for John Barger to President/COO of the leading Hill Country’s Ranch Radio Group.\n\nCoreena Hazelett is an exemplary role model of a successful Radio broadcaster and a true example of TAB’s Broadcaster of the Year.\n\nDan started in the newsroom, working on the assignment desk and serving as a weather forecaster.\n\nHe eventually made the switch to production and worked his way up to Production Manager, then Operations Manager.\n\nBecause of his background, Dan has a unique understanding of both journalism and the technical side of TV.\n\nHe demands excellence from his Control Room and Creative Services people.\n\nHis Commercial and Promotions teams have a long history of award-winning work that truly impacts the community.\n\nDan trains his staff to execute at an elevated level.\n\nHis team is the perfect partner for the newsroom staff, ensuring the station puts strong work to viewers on a regular basis.\n\nHe can jump into any technical problem and solve it.\n\nHe even jumps in to do fill-in weather when needed!\n\nHe is a major player in KAMR-TV’s election coverage, working closely with the newsroom to ensure the graphics and tickers are spotless and the coverage is in-depth.\n\nDan has overseen programming for several years now, as well.\n\nHe has served on the Children’s Miracle Network of Amarillo board for many years, serving as President in recent years.\n\nWest Texas A&M University inducted him into the Communication Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\n“Dan has seen our station through so many changes in our industry and in our community. He has managed to stay up to date on the ever-changing technology and needs in broadcasting,” said General Manager Brandy Sanchez.\n\n“Of our current employees, Dan has worked the longest at KAMR-TV, and we would not be as successful as we are without his experience, knowledge, passion and care for our employees and viewers.”\n\nFrom being a voice for the community to selling the partnerships – Sarah strives to showcase the power of Radio to her listeners in the Greater Houston area.\n\nEquipped with a keen business mind and a full heart, Sarah led the crafting of an astoundingly successful 2021 Audacy business plan and exceeded ALL expectations – from revenue to expense control and cash flow.\n\nShe accomplished these goals with her ever present positive energy – even in the face of the ongoing pandemic impacting her team, their families, audiences and advertisers.\n\nAt the same time, Sarah re-engineered her leadership team to smartly maximize performance within a challenging hybrid work environment.\n\nHer focus and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is matched by few others.\n\nShe has always worked to empower women and show them they deserve a spot at the corporate media table.\n\nHer innovative thinking has ensured Audacy Houston a prominent presence in the market over the last 10 years.\n\nShe continues to be extremely engaged with the Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Barbara Bush Literacy Foundation and many other groups – including serving as TAB Board Chair in 2019 and many additional years as a director.\n\nNot surprisingly, Sarah has proved to be a dynamic and effective advocate for Texas broadcasters in DC and in Austin.\n\nShe has made the industry’s case to Congress opposing a Performance Tax on Radio stations and helped lawmakers understand the increasingly unfair advertising competition we’re facing from Big Tech.\n\nHer enthusiasm for public service informs her passion for Open Government and for broadcasters’ leading role as the backbone of the nation’s emergency communications system.\n\nIn times of crisis, she has endeavored to ensure her stations were doing whatever was necessary to keep the community informed – yes, even partnering with other stations to provide listeners wall-to-wall reporting on dangerous conditions.\n\nAnd her operation is a national model for stepping up to help the Houston community recover from a disaster or celebrate a milestone!\n\nAlways leading, Sarah’s stations have routinely been one of the strongest supporters of TAB’s Public Education Partnership program throughout her tenure, extending TAB’s ability to provide invaluable services to member stations across the state.\n\n“I couldn’t be more fortunate to have Sarah lead one of Audacy’s key strategic markets that I oversee as Regional President,” said Audacy’s Brian Purdy.\n\n“I trust her ability to exceed financial targets and lead a culture of growth and ever-present transformation. She truly embodies our Audacy company values of Community, Curiosity, Courage and Creativity.”\n\nHe an excellent engineer, announcer, fundraiser, programmer, copy writer, newsman, public relations manager, general manager…you can just keep adding things.\n\nIn 1983, the Diocesan Telecommunications Corporation, a subsidiary of the Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi, decided to apply for a non-profit radio license and their first move was to hire Marty Wind to assist in the application.\n\nWhen the FCC approved their application, they hired Wind to be their “one-man band.” He began the engineering process and in March 1985, KLUX-FM 89.5 went on the air.\n\nBut before they flipped on the transmitter, Wind had to devise a programming format – no easy chore.\n\nHow do you take a faith-based radio station, licensed to the Catholic Church, and make it a mainstream station that could be enjoyed by all? Wind did it and called it “Good Company.”\n\nThey can’t sell commercials – so much of their existence depends on fundraising from the public.\n\nIt all began with one paid employee and today, 36 years later, they have ballooned up to five full time and one part-time paid employee.\n\n“Marty Wind has always been a master at getting something for nothing,” said former TAB Chairman Bob White.\n\n“He has a group of 20+ volunteers, myself included, who assist in the fundraisers, read public service announcements and many other things.\n\n“And just so you know, KLUX 89.5, “Good Company,” is a highly rated station, especially with 35+ and has a TSL that will make your eyes water.”\n\nWind introduced digital radio broadcasting to the Coastal Bend area in 2006 and today, non-commercial station KLUX is a market leader in public service with a long list of achievements highlighted by courageous endeavors to remain on the air during hurricanes and the disastrous 2021 freeze.\n\nKLUX was the only radio station to broadcast hourly reports consistently, 24 hours a day, during all these emergencies.\n\n“Marty’s heartfelt commitment to fellow broadcasters and listeners is unmatched. He has programmed KLUX to be the gold standard in ‘positive’ radio,” White said.\n\n“The commercials they aren’t allowed to broadcast are replaced by announcements regarding area events and positive messages that make you feel good about living in a world that is so filled with dissent and anger.\n\n“That’s why he calls it ‘Good Company.’”\n\nWind retired on May 31, 2021 but says he’ll always be available for station needs, even as he keeps up with all his additional volunteer commitments and work for the Diocese.\n\n“The 2019 Radio Broadcaster of the Year is not only an example to enterprising young broadcasters – men and women alike – she is an inspiration to us all as the SOLE owner of her hometown station – KLVT-AM Levelland,” said TAB Chairman Sarah Frazier\n\nTania Moody started in broadcasting in 2006 as a rookie sales rep for the High Plains Radio Network.\n\nShe had no broadcast experience, but she took the opportunity and ran with it.\n\nIn two years, she advanced to sales manager and became the station manager in 2010.\n\nShe started her own LMA in 2012 and went into business for herself – purchasing KLVT-AM just one year later.\n\nIn just three short years, Moody’s Cute Boots Broadcasting had paid for the station.\n\n“Here’s someone with no industry interest (other than needing a job), who took an opening and turned it into an opportunity to own and operate a successful business…and it happens to be in our broadcast Industry,” said Monte Spearman, President High Plains Radio Network.\n\nMoody not only manages her broadcast team of three, but also handles more than 50% of the sales for the station, performs day-to-day administrative duties and hosts/produces a very successful morning show.\n\nMoody and her team recently launched the “Good Morning Texas Show” via Facebook Live and on a media streamer to the KLVT webpage. The 90-minute program airs every Monday-Friday.\n\n“I have been in the Radio business nearly 20 years and I have never worked for somebody as plugged in to her business, her community and her employees like Tania,” said Michael Wiiest, KLVT Station Manager/Sports Director.\n\n“She is amazing in every way and truly embodies what Small Market Radio does for small communities. With her it is all about her listeners, her clients, and her community.”\n\nInvolvement in her community is an understatement.\n\nMoody serves as Board President of the Levelland ISD Board of Trustees and President of the Wallace Theater Foundation (in efforts to restore an old theater in downtown Levelland).\n\nShe also has served as President of the Hockley County Foundation, the Levelland Marigolds, Levelland Main Street Program, and has served on the Levelland Chamber of Commerce.\n\n“Tania is a great example of a local business owner who is truly invested in their community. Her biggest asset is she’s an ACTIVE member of these organizations and giver her time and resources, whether or not she is in a leadership role,” said DeEtte Edens, Levelland ISD School Board.\n\n“In this industry, we hire people constantly and hope they will learn the business, like the business and stay in the business.\n\n“I will always argue that Small Market Radio is the hardest level there is to operate Radio stations to the point of not just paying the bills, but also being profitable and growing a real business,” Spearman said.\n\nThrough her accomplishments, business growth efforts, attitude, commitment to her station and community and her diligence – Tania Moody continues to be a shining example of what it means to be a local, Texas broadcaster.\n\nLassberg’s passion for impactful local journalism is reflected in his support for growing the station’s investment in its newsroom, his appreciation for outstanding storytelling and his insistence that the station’s journalists be responsible, ethical and fair in their reporting.\n\nEight years ago, Lassberg laid out a vision for KXAN to become an impactful investigative news station, focusing on reporting that leads to positive change in our community.\n\nToday, the station is consistently recognized for stories that help change laws, hold the powerful accountable and address public safety.\n\nDuring the 2019 legislative session, more than a dozen bills were filed after KXAN investigations into problems such as maternal mortality and morbidity statewide, harassment in the workplace and toll drivers frustrated by exorbitant late fees and other vexing billing issues.\n\nUnder Lassberg’s leadership, KXAN has received numerous awards for journalism excellence.\n\nAmong those awards are several Emmys, Texas Associated Press Broadcaster Awards (including the Freedom of Information Foundation Award), Headliners Foundation of Texas Awards, Edward R. Murrow Awards and an Alfred I. duPont Award from Columbia University.\n\nIn 2019, KXAN was awarded its third Walter Cronkite Award for Political Television Journalism for a special broadcast of political program, State of Texas, which focused on one long-form investigation into the Texas Railroad Commission Chairman and the conflicts of interest related to her politically prominent family.\n\nNever one to be waylaid by adversity, Lassberg was moved to embrace the mission of the American Heart Association after the cardiac arrest of an employee, launching an initiative across all three stations known as Simple Health.\n\nLassberg utilized the stations’ multiple platforms to help provide Central Texans tools and resources to live healthier lives, particularly in advancing the AHA’s hands-only CPR training events which have trained more than 1,400 Central Texans.\n\nHis passion led to his selection as an AHA Board member and is reflected in his leadership on the TAB Board of Directors and his history of Board service for the Boys and Girls Club of the Austin Area and Family Elder Care.\n\nHe also is a member of the Longhorn Advisory Council.\n\nLassberg is the ideal example of what a broadcaster may achieve through hard work, core principals and a true belief in what television stations may achieve within a community.\n\nHis belief in investigative journalism and community involvement makes the KXAN team proud to work for him, though he is the first to credit the team for the stations’ accomplishments.\n\n“All I’ve done is surround myself with a team of people who are a lot smarter than I am. That’s a recipe of success for anyone,” he said.\n\nHis reflexive recognition of his team’s insightful leadership and dedication has created a culture in which everyone truly feels they are part of something that can make Central Texas better each day.\n\nBy creating such a culture, Lassberg has crafted one of the most respected television stations in the country whose impact is felt throughout the Lone Star State.\n\nUnder her leadership, the station has been recognized nationally with three of the most prestigious journalism awards in the country:\n\nan Emmy for News Excellence,\n\nthe Alfred DuPont Columbia University Award for investigative reporting on TWO separate occasions, and\n\nan Edward R. Murrow Award for Social Media.\n\nIn 2009, she was named Broadcasting & Cable’s General Manager of the Year in the large market category.\n\nHer passion for the city of Houston, dedication to the station, and knack for creative problem-solving all came to bear in the past year as Houston and the station itself confronted one of the greatest natural disasters in the city’s history.\n\n“I watched from our broadcast studios on the 19th floor as Hurricane Harvey’s rains swept over much of the city and inundated KHOU, and watched in real time as the the brave news team realized the station would be forced off the air,” said Sarah Frazier, General Manager of Entercom Radio Houston.\n\nAs if living proof that “chance favors the prepared mind,” McEldoon had worked months before the storm to plan for such an emergency.\n\nShe ensured her team had shelter and food, sleeping at the station for days…consoling and coaching those who had lost their own homes or cars.\n\nIn the days following the storm, she formed a partnership with Houston Public Media to temporarily relocate the station. Now orchestrating operations across multiple sites in Houston and Dallas, she continues to work tirelessly to stabilize, restore and advance KHOU-TV’s commitment to the community.\n\nOut of 47 Television stations in 39 markets across the country, TEGNA presented McEldoon with the company’s Manager of the Year Award in April.\n\nShe had been planning to retire at the end of 2017. But after the cascading impact of Harvey on her station’s operations, her heartfelt sense of obligation made her reconsider. Instead, she’s helping plan the station of the future at KHOU-TV’s new location.\n\n“Since the day I rolled into Houston I have admired her,” Frazier said.\n\n“She is a strong and confident business leader who serves as a model to her team, her fellow broadcasters and the people of Houston.”\n\nPurdy began his Texas broadcast career with Clear Channel Houston, serving in various management roles, including Market Manager, from 1996-2001.\n\nHe orchestrated one of his team’s most successful years in 2016.\n\nHaving spent three years re-imagining his products to better meet the needs of the marketplace, his portfolio of stations enjoyed three stations in the Top 10 Adults 25-54, which had never happened before.\n\nBoth the legendary Classic Hits KLUV and a re-tooled JACK-FM ranked in the market’s Top 5, while Sportstalk The Fan (KRLD-FM) beat heritage sports leader, The Ticket, for the first time in station history.\n\nWith additional ratings strength at legendary Newsradio KRLD-AM, CBS Radio’s 2016 revenue outperformed the DFW market tenfold and lead the company in financial performance.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, they again hit their stride serving the DFW community, raising more than $1.26 million during their “Christmas is for Children” Radiothon this past December.\n\nOne hundred percent of the funds raised over the two-day period, support pediatric patient care at Dallas’ Children’s Health.\n\nRadio Ink magazine recognized Purdy as one of the “Best Managers in Radio,” in 2016 and also was nominated for Market Manager of the Year by the Dallas-Fort Worth Media Alliance Awards.\n\nAlways looking to innovate, Purdy created a new model for sports play-by-play broadcast partnerships.\n\nFollowing a 2006 departure of the Dallas Cowboys from CBS Radio, Purdy won the rights back in 2009 by creating a pioneering radio station/team agreement featuring an asset exchange instead of rights fees.\n\nThe new structure was the foundation for a symbiotic relationship that was cost-effective for both the team and radio station.\n\nIn 2011, Purdy brought the idea to Houston, which resulted in a 10-year extension with the Houston Texans on SportsRadio 610 and KILT-FM, converting it from one of the most expensive NFL radio broadcast contracts in the company to one of the most efficient.\n\nBoth franchise partnerships are extremely profitable for CBS Radio and are now being replicated across the NFL.\n\n“Brian went above and beyond to develop a true partnership and not just a contract, that was fair to all concerned,” said Jamey Rootes, President of the Houston Texans.\n\n“As our rights holder, Brian not only worked diligently with us to create world class programming that would inform, entertain and engage our fans, but he consistently maintained a positive spirit of collaboration between our two organizations that inspired trust and led to additional opportunities to create value for both us and the station.”\n\nPurdy has spent the last 20+ years in Texas mentoring his staff, many who have become Senior Executives in their own right.\n\nHis network reaches throughout the state and beyond, and he is widely regarded as one of the best coaches in the radio industry.\n\nHis management teams are built on merit, without bias of gender, ethnicity or lifestyle.\n\nPurdy has served several terms on the TAB Board of Directors, taking the time for multiple trips to Austin and Washington DC to lobby on behalf of his fellow broadcasters.\n\nHe also commits significant time to local charities and is an Executive Board member of the Circle Ten Boy Scout Council of North Texas.\n\nFollowing industry consolidation during the early 2000’s the Market Manager role changed dramatically.\n\nHowever, with the additional responsibilities Purdy has continued to be visible and active outside the CBS Radio Tower in Dallas.\n\nWell-known throughout the market, he’s often out selling and promoting radio and local broadcasting.\n\n“The war is being fought on the ground every day in Dallas, and Brian is leading the charge. He also makes sure to fight to keep live and local on-air announcers, as he believes that is the cornerstone of a great broadcaster,” said TAB Treasurer Sarah Frazier, CBS Radio Houston.\n\n“Brian knows the best way to advance our industry is to be a great broadcaster and use your products to serve the community well.”\n\nJohn Kittleman graduated from the University of Texas-Austin in 1983, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Radio-Television & Film.\n\nHe continued at UT to get his Master of Arts Radio-Television-Film and Master of Business Administration degrees. After a stint at the Financial News Network in Los Angeles, Kittleman joined KRGV-TV Rio Grande Valley as the marketing director in 1989.\n\ne steadily rose through the ranks at the ABC affiliate, becoming general manager in 2008. Throughout his 27 years in the Rio Grande Valley, Kittleman has made a focus on the local community his number one priority.\n\nThe station has been recognized with a variety of National and RTDNA Regional Murrow Awards and Texas Associated Press Awards Broadcast, including most recently, the AP’s highest statewide broadcast honor, “Overall Excellence Award.” TAB also has honored KRGV-TV with numerous Bonner McLane Public Service awards.\n\nKRGV-TV is a unique station. The station is a market leader in Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville-McAllen, where more than 90 percent of the population is of Hispanic origin, according to BIA/Kelsey.\n\nAt least a third of the homes in the market are Spanish-language dominant and many others receive a station signal from the Mexico side of the border.\n\nIn June 2015, KRGV-TV began providing live Spanish-language translation of all the station’s newscasts on viewers’ secondary audio channels.\n\nThose watching “Channel 5 News” in English see no change, while viewers who wish to watch the newscast with Spanish audio can click on the SAP button on their remotes.\n\n“The community told us they did not want a second newscast. They didn’t want it on a second channel or another time. They wanted our newscast when it airs, but with the translation,” Kittleman said.\n\n“Once our viewers learn how to choose the SAP option on their TV, they have the choice of listening in English or Spanish.”\n\nThe station provides more than 39 hours/week of news.\n\n“Mr. Kittleman is a manager who believes in his people, supports their efforts and helps them be all they can be as individuals and station leaders,” said News Director Jenny Martinez.\n\n“He has foresight and curiosity. Thanks to him, we have an 18-member Spanish translation team. It’s the first of its kind in the country and just the beginning of what this team will one day accomplish!”\n\nThe station also recently launched a new series, “Heart of the Valley:” a station-wide initiative to use the power of KRGV-TV to make a positive change in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThe station aims to not only shine a light on critical issues but also offer solutions to community challenges.\n\nThe program goes in-depth to illuminate one critical issue, need, or cause, to help make positive changes in viewers’ lives by utilizing the station’s vaunted investigative news team, working hand-in-hand with local charities and airing public service announcements that deliver important messages.\n\nKRGV undertakes the two week “Heart of the Valley” series four times a year. The first series focused on diabetes which has reached nearly epidemic proportions in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nHEB partnered with the station to offer free screenings and provide store tours led by certified dietitians. More than 7,000 people were tested for diabetes because of the project.\n\nThe news team produced 29 educational stories about the different types of diabetes, explaining how it starts and why.\n\nThey also explored juvenile diabetes and methods available to deal with it, and the consequences of failing to deal with it.\n\nKRGV-TV connected doctors and other experts with viewers on Facebook Live to give viewers the opportunity to ask questions.\n\nOutside the station, Kittleman has served multiple terms on the TAB Board of Directors and consistently volunteers to accompany TAB’s legislative delegation on visits to DC.\n\nHe also works tirelessly with Nielsen to ensure the measurement system is valid, especially in minority-majority markets like the Rio Grande Valley.\n\n“I’ve known John for more than 20 years and he’s always impressed me as someone who’s truly committed to the essential ethics and goals necessary to run a great and effective television station,” said Patti C. Smith, former TAB Chairman.\n\n“His work speaks volumes and his staff can attest to his dedication to the community and to the principles we all hold dear within the broadcasting business.”\n\nPhil Hurley personifies what it means to be a “Local Broadcaster.” In his distinguished 30+ year career, he personally has been involved in building multiple television stations from the ground up and making them community service leaders.\n\nHurley attended Austin College in Sherman on an academic scholarship and subsequently earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Marketing with Honors from the University of Texas at Austin in 1971.\n\nHe entered the business world with Southwestern Bell Telephone in 1971 and held several top management positions with the company before joining Interfirst Bank in Tyler in 1979 where A.W. “Dub” Riter asked him to build a marketing department. He served as Senior Vice President for five years.\n\n“I spent a lot of time with financial statements and in lending and learned exactly what it takes to run a business from that standpoint,” Hurley said.\n\n“Dub Riter also taught me the value of community, of participating in it…those things you don’t necessarily get a check for.”\n\nHe entered the broadcast industry in 1983 with the ABC affiliate in Tyler (KLTV-TV) and served as General Manager until 1986 when he left to form the Lone Star Broadcasting Company, the owner of Tyler’s NBC affiliate.\n\nHe organized and built KETK-TV and KLSB-TV in Tyler and Nacogdoches and sold these stations to Max Media in 1997, remaining with the stations through 2000.\n\nHurley left Texas in 2001 to serve as President for Max Media of Montana, a group of four ABC stations and one NBC station.\n\nBut the Lone Star State was his true home and Hurley returned in 2003 to manage the Nexstar Broadcasting Group’s NBC affiliate in Beaumont.\n\nIn 2004, Hurley rejoined the Max Media family as President and General Manager of Max Media of Texas.\n\nIn addition to KETK/KLSB-TV, Hurley managed KFXK-TV Longview (Fox), KLPN-TV Longview (UPN) and KWTL-TV Tyler (Warner).\n\nIn 2004, Hurley signed on the air with KYTX-TV Tyler-Longview, adding a CBS affiliate to the market. CBS 19 became the first station in the region to broadcast in High Definition.\n\nHe subsequently sold the station to London Broadcasting Company in February 2008 and joined LBC as EVP/COO, overseeing the operations of all of LBC’s television properties.\n\nLondon Broadcasting grew to 12 stations in five Texas markets representing all four major English language networks. Dallas-based LBC also created production company, 41 Entertainment, and BE Music & Entertainment, a musical artist management firm. He eventually added independent station KTXD-TV Dallas to the fold.\n\nAs Hurley described it, LBC was to be a multi-dimensional entertainment and broadcasting company concentrating on Texas television broadcasting and Texas music. The company’s motto was “Texas born. Texas proud. We are Texas.”\n\nHe built out digital networks, added original programming and introduced HD broadcasting and multi-cast channels to stations in several markets, including local news at the Bryan-College Station property and additional news offerings at the Abilene and San Angelo stations.\n\nGannett purchased London Broadcasting Company in July 2014.
