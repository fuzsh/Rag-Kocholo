        "text": "Published on Monday, February 26, 2024\n\nBy: Annie Oeth, aoeth@umc.edu\n\nPhotos By: Lindsay McMurtray/ UMMC Communications\n\nThe 2024 Mississippi Miracles Radiothon starts on leap year day, a fitting date because the annual fundraiser is all about leaping.\n\nDuring Mississippi Miracles Radiothon, set for Feb. 29-March 1, there are leaps in donations and celebratory leaps when the total amount raised is announced at the broadcast’s end.\n\nThe 6 a.m.-to-6 p.m. event, which broadcasts from the BankPlus Community Room of the Kathy and Joe Sanderson Tower at Children’s of Mississippi, raises funds for the care and comfort of pediatric patients and their families.\n\n“Every year, Mississippi Miracles Radiothon starts as a leap of faith, but the people of Mississippi never let us down,” said Jen Hospodor, senior director of strategic partnerships at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. “Mississippians are known for their generosity, and children are close to their hearts. Every year, our Miracle Giving Club members work miracles in supporting Children’s of Mississippi.”\n\nThe pediatric arm of UMMC, Children’s of Mississippi, includes Mississippi’s only children’s hospital as well as clinics around the state.\n\nSince the first Mississippi Miracles Radiothon in 2001, the annual event has raised more than $8 million for Children’s of Mississippi. Businesses in the state join in as partners, providing matching funds and in-kind donations such as food to fuel the marathon broadcast. Gifts and pledges of any amount are accepted. Those who pledge $15 a month are Miracle Giving Club members.\n\nThirteen stations representing The Radio People – Y101, Mix 98.7, U.S. 96, 93.5 The Legend, 102.1 The Box and Blues 93.1 in Jackson; Vicksburg stations K Hits 104.5, River 101.3 and 92.7 The Touch; and 97 OKK, Q101, Kiss 104.1 and 95.1 The Beat of Meridian – will take to the air waves for two memorable days of interviewing Children’s of Mississippi patients and their families as well as the children’s hospital’s care team.\n\nFisher Alexander, production director and an on-air personality at U.S. 96, is a perennial pilot of the airwaves during Mississippi Miracles Radiothon.\n\n“Radiothon is truly a magical time for all of us,” he said. “Watching children overcome the unimaginable and grow up, talking to the amazing staff and seeing their love for Children's pour out of every word, and hearing my gifted coworkers tell the Children's of Mississippi story, makes each year’s Radiothon memorable.”\n\nThe six Jackson stations will broadcast from the Sanderson Tower, while the other stations will participate in the Mississippi Miracles Radiothon from their broadcast studios in Vicksburg and Meridian.\n\nKristel Taylor-Robinson of Brandon has supported Mississippi Miracles Radiothon for 13 years as a volunteer and 12 years as a spokesperson, sharing her family’s story.\n\n“I keep coming back year after year because I want to give back to the hospital that gave my child the life he has today,” she said. “Without Children’s of Mississippi, I wouldn’t have the healthy child I have today! He is able to live a fairly normal life thanks to the amazing doctors and nurses. This is a second home, and I can’t think of a better place to call home.”\n\nAiden Robinson, now 13, was diagnosed with sagittal craniosynostosis, a condition in which some of the bones of the skull fuse together earlier than they should, as an infant.\n\n“Aiden was only 7 weeks old the first time we walked through these doors,” she said. “I was a ball of nerves and filled with worry. The nurses immediately helped calm my nerves and made me realize that we were right where we needed to be. He was just 10 weeks old the first time I handed him over to a surgeon. He’s had countless MRI and CT scans, surgeries and appointments, but when you are here, it’s as if you’re visiting family.”\n\nLaurel Donahoo agrees. Her son, Dempsey, received cochlear implants at Children’s of Mississippi in 2019.\n\n“Dempsey loves Radiothon,” she said. “It is such a fun experience for him! Every time we pass the Sanderson Tower, he says ‘That’s where I go on the radio!’ It is a joy for us to get to sing the praises of the wonderful people at Children’s of Mississippi, because they have taken such great care of us. We could not be more pleased.”\n\nTo give during the Mississippi Miracles Radiothon, call 888-681-5437 from 6 a.m. Feb. 29 to 6 p.m. March 1."
