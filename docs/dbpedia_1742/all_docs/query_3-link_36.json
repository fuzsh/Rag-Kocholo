As we will see pulsed techniques are fundamentally different from the CW-DNP methodology and require a different array of instrumentation, spin physics, and radicals. Hence, in addition to the underlying theory, we discuss the specifications of the microwave sources, DNP probes, and optimal radicals for pulsed DNP. The review ends with a summary of the current and future applications of pulsed DNP and conjectures as to the development of the pulsed methods for experiments at increasingly higher magnetic fields.\n\nFermer\n\nThree-spin solid effect and the spin diffusion barrier in amorphous solids Article de journal\n\nKong Ooi Tan; Michael Mardini; Chen Yang; Jan Henrik Ardenkj√¶r-Larsen; Robert Guy Griffin\n\nScience Advances, 5 (7), p. eaax2743, 2019, ISSN: 2375-2548.\n\n@article{Tan2019a,\n\ntitle = {Three-spin solid effect and the spin diffusion barrier in amorphous solids},\n\nauthor = {Kong Ooi Tan and Michael Mardini and Chen Yang and Jan Henrik Ardenkj{\\ae}r-Larsen and Robert Guy Griffin},\n\nurl = {http://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aax2743 http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aax2743 https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aax2743},\n\ndoi = {10.1126/sciadv.aax2743},\n\nissn = {2375-2548},\n\nyear = {2019},\n\ndate = {2019-07-01},\n\njournal = {Science Advances},\n\nvolume = {5},\n\nnumber = {7},\n\npages = {eaax2743},\n\nabstract = {Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) has evolved as the method of choice to enhance NMR signal intensities and to address a variety of otherwise inaccessible chemical, biological and physical questions.
