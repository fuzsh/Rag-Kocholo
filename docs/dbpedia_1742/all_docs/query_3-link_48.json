        "text": "While many prospective students will crave large campuses and the anonymity of a bustling student body, others will be attracted to the experience that a smaller institution can offer.\n\nTimes Higher Education has once again revealed the best small universities across the globe – from the US, China and South Korea to India, Japan and France.\n\nTo be eligible for the ranking, universities must appear in THE’s World University Rankings 2024, teach more than four subjects and have fewer than 5,000 students.\n\nThe average number of students at institutions in the 2024 best small universities ranking is 3,215. In contrast, the average number of students at an institution in THE’s main global ranking is 25,000.\n\nTop 20 small universities in the world 2024\n\n1.
