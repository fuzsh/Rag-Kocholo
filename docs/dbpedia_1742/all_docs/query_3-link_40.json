        "text": "As this year’s Nobel Prize Winners are announced, there’s an opportunity to consider an entirely different kind of college ranking that focuses more on the ultimate achievements of the alumni of a university. Though some might argue that the PhD granting institution is often the most influential for one’s career – especially for the more academic awards – the role of the undergraduate institution attended as having a formative role is less appreciated. Quantifiable achievements such as Nobel Prizes could potentially be a better measure of university quality than typical factors considered such as alumni donations, graduation rate, faculty and financial resources, or reputation.\n\nA brief history of rankings\n\nIn his book Ranking, Peter Erdi notes that rankings are in some ways socially understandable, in that “Human beings are competitive. We want to know who is the strongest, who is the richest, and who is the cleverest of all.” One of the very first college rankings was conducted in 1911 by Kendric Charles Babcock, and the sociologist Kieran Healy examined the relationship between Babcock’s ranking and the U.S. News ranking, noting based on his analysis that in regards to college rankings “there is a substantial degree of stability over the course of the century.”\n\nRankings from U.S. News first appeared in 1983, and its Best Colleges have become one of the most influential. There are many other rankings that have various criteria on which institutions are compared, including one by The Economist, which sought to determine the value of a college or university based on how well it helped students—with similar background characteristics—improve their earnings.\n\nHowever, research has shown that going to a highly selective university does not appear to matter in relation to long-run earnings, once SAT scores are taken into account. In some of my own work with colleagues Matt Brown and Christopher Chabris we simply ranked 1,339 schools by their average standardized test scores (ACT scores were translated to SAT scores to have a unified metric). In doing so, we produced the following graph which shows the structure of the SAT and ACT score distribution across a wide range of schools.\n\nMost of the variation in the graph occurs between the highly selective and elite schools, or scores of 1300 to about 1600 (on the SAT math plus verbal scale). A correlation of 0 indicates no relationship between two variables and a correlation of 1 indicates a perfect relationship between two variables. It turns out that when we correlated this test score ranking with numerous other rankings that used a wide variety of formulations, test score rankings correlated between 0.659 to 0.890 with other rankings. In other words, schools that end up at the top of one set of rankings also will tend to end up at the top of another set of rankings. This helps explain why so many rankings appear to provide so much of the same information. College rankings in some ways may end up simply being student rankings, or a reflection of how students end up sorting into different schools.\n\nA Nobel Prize ranking of global colleges and universities\n\nOne limitation of prior rankings has been that outcomes have been on short-term factors that are all closely tied to the already longstanding reputation or brand of the university. It seems that long-run earnings are the exception. However, another way to think about how to rank schools is how many alumni they have graduated who have achieved something extraordinary – such as a Nobel Prize. Of course, the rarity of earning a Nobel comes after many years of hard work that may have very little to do with where one attends school for their undergraduate education. On the other hand, colleges and universities are often a key point of selection and training across the world, and winners of these prizes have often gotten their start by being admitted to schools that may have helped set them on the track towards their ultimate trajectory.\n\nIn prior work in collaboration with Stephen Hsu and discussed in Nature News & Comment by Tom Clynes, we examined all of the undergraduate institutions that Nobel Prize winners across all fields had attended from 1901 through 2015. To account for the fact that some institutions have many more graduates throughout history than others, we sought to roughly rank schools by the proportion of their undergraduates who went on to win a Nobel Prize.\n\nThat analysis estimating Nobelists per capita found that the top 10 schools were:\n\n1. École Normale Supérieure (France)\n\n2. California Instiute of Technology (US)\n\n3. Harvard University (US)\n\n4. Swarthmore College (US)\n\n5. Cambridge University (UK)\n\n6. École Polytechnique (France)\n\n7. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US)\n\n8. Columbia University (US)\n\n9. Amherst College (US)\n\n10. University of Chicago (US)\n\nTo add to this analysis, I examined all Nobel winners from 2016-2019, and note here the schools that showed up more than once. Cambridge University was the clear leader having six winners, with six other schools having just two winners each: California Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Kyoto University, University of Edinburgh, University of Texas Austin, and Yale University. Among the remaining schools that made the top 10 from 1901-2015, Amherst College, Columbia University, École Normale Supérieure, École Polytechnique, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Chicago each had one winner. Overall, this suggests that the top 10 schools have largely remained the same. However, given that there are only a tiny group of new Nobel winners each year, these rankings are unlikely to shift simply because the majority of the sample is from the past.\n\nSo far in 2020, only physics prize winner Andrea Ghez attended one of the top 10 schools listed above, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Overall, these findings point to the idea that more attention to what undergraduate institutions, in particular those in the top 10, are doing during these formative years in terms of selection and training may be worthwhile. Additionally, this also provides a different way of ranking colleges and universities focused on ultimate achievements. Finally, it’s important to note that of the U.S. universities that made it to the top of the Nobel Prize rankings, these are all schools found at the top of many other rankings, perhaps pointing to the stability of rankings across time as Healy pointed out.\n\nThe role of the undergraduate years in the development of extraordinary expertise\n\nAs noted earlier, research has indicated that outcomes may be due less to the school attended and more due to selection. Thus, one core limitation of this ranking is that by focusing on the Nobel Prize winners themselves, we are only seeing the tiny handful of survivors, not the many failures along the tortuous and perhaps often serendipitous road to doing the work that eventually warrants a Nobel. One way of improving this kind of ranking might be to broaden the set of low-base rate outcomes examined. For example, in a recent paper with my colleague Harrison Kell, we point out that being able to predict ultimate achievements requires attention to the adequate measurement of both the predictors (e.g., cognitive abilities), as well as the outcomes (e.g., Nobel Prize winners, Fortune 500 CEOs, billionaires) examined."
