        "text": "Andrew Pell\n\nElected Junior Member, Fundamental Chair Laureate\n\nProfessor, Department of Chemistry at ENS Lyon, Head of the Master 2 research course\n\nMember of the Centre de RMN à Très Hauts Champs de Lyon (CRMN, CNRS/ENS de Lyon/Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University)\n\nAndrew Pell joined the ENS de Lyon in 2020. His current work aims to determine in detail the structure of complex (para)magnetic materials using solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and to relate these characteristics to the function of the materials as components of their devices.\n\nIt is a great honor to have been elected IUF Junior and I warmly thank my colleagues for this recognition. I plan to use this time to pursue my research into the development and application of solid-state NMR to study (para)magnetic materials, which combines the disciplines of NMR spectroscopy, spin physics, computational chemistry and materials chemistry.\n\nNikolay Tzvetkov\n\nElected Senior Member, Fundamental Chair Laureate\n\nProfessor, Mathematics Department at the ENS de Lyon, responsible for the Master 1 year.\n\nMember of the Pure and Applied Mathematics Unit (CNRS/ENS de Lyon/Inria)\n\nNikolay Tzvetkov will join the ENS de Lyon in 2022. His current research focuses on the statistical description of the flow of Hamiltonian partial differential equations, and more specifically on the interaction between temporary oscillations and the random oscillations present in this framework. He was elected Junior Member of the IUF in 2010.\n\nThe nomination to the IUF will enable me to devote even more energy to the project which aims to construct a canonical dynamic of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, posed on the two-dimensional sphere, on the support of the Gibbs measure. I've been working on this project since 2006, and I dare to believe that it now has everything it needs to come to fruition soon. What's more, the IUF nomination will enable me to leave my comfort zone more often in terms of my research activities."
