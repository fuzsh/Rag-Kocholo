        "text": "Marie Skłodowska Curie ( KEWR-ee, French: [kyʁi], Polish: [kʲiˈri]; born Maria Salomea Skłodowska; 7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win the Nobel prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields. She was part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon in Paris. She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and physicist Henri Becquerel. She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Her achievements included the development of the theory of radioactivity (a term she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms using radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today. During World War I she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals. While a French citizen, Marie Skłodowska Curie, who used both surnames, never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland. She named the first chemical element she discovered polonium, after her native country.Marie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at a sanatorium in Sancellemoz (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anemia from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during World War I.\n\nCarla Bruni, an Italian-French supermodel turned singer-songwriter, is a woman of many talents and roles. Born in Turin, Italy to wealthy Italian industrialists on December 23, 1967, Bruni was educated in Switzerland and France, where she transitioned to international modeling at the age of 19. With her striking beauty and elegance, she soon graced the covers of Vogue and Elle, and walked the runways for designers like Versace and Christian Dior. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, she became one of the world's most successful fashion models, earning an impressive reputation in the industry. In the late 1990s, Bruni transitioned from modeling to music, showing off her singer-songwriting skills. Her debut album, Quelqu'un m'a dit\" (Someone Told Me), released in 2002, was a massive hit, selling two million copies. Her melodic tunes and poetic lyrics resonated well with the audience and established her as a formidable presence in the French music industry. Following albums like No Promises and Comme si de rien n'était continued to demonstrate her musical prowess and versatility, securing her place as a respected artist. Beyond her successful career in entertainment, Carla Bruni is also known for her role in French politics. In 2008, she married Nicolas Sarkozy, then president of France, becoming First Lady of France until 2012. This role added another dimension to Bruni's public persona as she took on various philanthropic duties and advocacies, particularly AIDS research and prevention. Carla Bruni's fascinating journey from supermodel to singer-songwriter, and from high-fashion icon to First Lady, makes her a unique figure in contemporary culture. Her ability to reinvent herself while staying true to her passions demonstrates her resilience and versatility."
