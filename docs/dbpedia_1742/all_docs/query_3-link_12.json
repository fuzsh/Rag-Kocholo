        "text": "It was established during the French Revolution to provide the Republic with a new body of professors. Since then it has developed into an institution for a select few of France’s students to pursue careers in government and academia.\n\nThe École Normale Supérieure was founded in 1794. ENS has two main sections: Literature and Science. In addition to the classic double curricula (mathematics-computer sciences, mathematics-physics, etc.), many links with literary departments also exist. Among The École Normale Supérieure alumni, there are 13 Nobel Prize laureates including 8 in Physics and 11 Fields Medalists.\n\nQS World University Ranking positions The École Normale Supérieure in the 43rd position and number 32 in the Ranking by subject in the field of Mathematics. However, the university is also very strong in modern languages, computer science and information systems, philosophy, history, physics and astronomy, statistics and operational research.\n\nWhile ENS is a considerable small university (around 1,000 students every year), its students are selected among the bests with a very competitive selection process which involves written and oral examinations. During their studies at The École Normale Supérieure, some students hold the status of paid civil servants.\n\nThe ENS is primarily a research university, with more than 800 research staff and 600 Ph.D. students. Over 80% of its students move into a Ph.D. program. Students in Sciences programmes benefit from 7 training years to construct their own scientific career while interacting with tutors and being in contact with laboratories and researchers."
