        "text": "Grants are awarded for a maximum duration of 24 months. Grantees must satisfy the academic requirements of the first year of the master's program to be eligible for the second year of funding.\n\nGrants will generally begin on September 1 through August 31 for university attendance. Grantees may also attend an optional summer school prior to beginning the degree program.\n\nBeing a Fulbrighter in France is an unforgettable experience! When not engaged in their project, Fulbrighters enjoy the benefits of the French lifestyle: wonderful food, excellent life-work balance, and enthusiasm for lively debate and discussion. We encourage Fulbrighters to travel the country (and discover its many amazing heritage sites, museums, landscapes, and diverse society), and to get involved in community service or other local activities. They are thus able to build strong cross cultural ties between France and the United States.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that while the Fulbright Commission is dedicated to assisting Fulbrighters as much as possible to make their transition to France as smooth as possible, Fulbrighters are responsible for securing their own housing and making other administrative arrangements themselves. We recommend that Fulbrighters prepare their stay well ahead of time.\n\nFor more information on daily life in France, see: https://www.usa.campusfrance.org/daily-life\n\n\"Through Fulbright, I have the opportunity to continue my studies in environmental science and expand my professional network. Living in France has helped me improve my communication skills and has exposed me to new perspectives on environmental challenges and resource management.\"\n\n-Fulbright-ENS Rennes alumna\n\nInterested candidates should first get in contact with the ENS Rennes International Office by sending an updated résumé and short statement of purpose in English or French.\n\nENS Rennes International Office will forward the request to the appropriate academic department.
