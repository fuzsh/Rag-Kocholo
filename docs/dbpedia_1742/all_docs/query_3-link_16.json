It encompasses fifteen teaching and research departments, spanning the main humanities, sciences and disciplines. Unique among France‚Äôs grandes √©coles for its training in the humanities and sciences, the ENS prepares its students for their role as future leaders in every imaginable professional field: in research, media, public service and private industry. As a central actor in the training of French elites for more than two centuries, it has nourished the majority of the great intellectual movements of the 20th century and has considerably widened the scope of French scientific influence. The impressive achievements made possible through the training it dispenses, distinguish the √âcole normale sup√©rieure from all other French establishments of higher learning. Former students include all eight French winners of the Fields Medal, thirteen Nobel Prize winners and half of the recipients the CNRS Gold Medal. The success of ENS alumni results from the quality of its research-based training, which includes individual tutorials and personalized attention for the full four years of study. This ‚Äútraining-by-research‚Äù model is the hallmark of the √âcole normale sup√©rieure. It is the best preparation for innovation and creativity.\n\nAbout Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure\n\nThe √âcole normale sup√©rieure (ENS) is an elite higher education institution (graduate school) for advanced undergraduate and graduate studies, and a prestigious French research center.
