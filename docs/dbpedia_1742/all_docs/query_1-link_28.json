        "text": "Pierre Vernier\n\nPierre Vernier (1584-1638)\n\nMacTutor | Wikipedia | Galileo Project | Encyclopedia Britannica (1911)\n\nFrench mathematician, military engineer and instrument-maker, born in Ornans (near Besançon, Franche-Comté, now in France) where a collège is named after him (so is a public institute for technological innovation, located in Besançon). Pierre Vernier served the King of Spain who was ruling Franche Comté at the time. In 1623, he was awarded the title of citizen of Besançon for his work on the fortifications of the city.\n\nIn a treatise entitled La Construction, l'usage, et les propriétés du quadrant nouveau de mathématiques (Brussels, 1631) Pierre Vernier published a description of the sliding scale named after him and used in quadrants, sextants, calipers and other precision measuring instruments. Originally, he described a quadrant allowing angular measurements to a precision of one minute, using a main scale graduated in half-degrees and a movable sector divided into 30 equal intervals spanning 29 half-degrees.\n\nThe underlying idea can be traced to the multiple fixed scales of the nonius invented by the Portuguese mathematician Pedro Nunes (1502-1578) which Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) dismissed as unpractical (the multiple scales were also difficult to engrave to the required precision). Improvements were attempted by Jacob Curtius (1554-1594) and by the Bavarian Jesuit Christopher Clavius (né Schlussel, 1538-1612) who is best remembered as the astronomer who engineered the modern Gregorian calendar.\n\nBy replacing the full-length fixed scales of the nonius with a short movable scale, Pierre Vernier eliminated the need for auxiliary tables and invented a truly practical device (which would become popular early in the eighteenth century). That innovation was properly named after Vernier by Lalande in 1771, but the earlier etymology (nonius) survives in some languages.\n\nIn modern times, the most common Vernier scales are decimal ones, featuring 10 intervals spanning 9 intervals of the main scale. If the two scales coincide precisely after n Vernier intervals, then the measurement exceeds by n/10 whatever is indicated on the main scale (just before the zero of the Vernier scale):\n\nIsmaël Bullialdus\n\nIsmaël Bouillaud; Bullialdus (1605-1694)\n\nMacTutor | Wikipedia | SEDS | Biblical Cyclopedia\n\nThe correct French spelling is Bouillaud with a trailing \"d\", as evidenced by the learned Latinized version Bullialdus. However, that final consonant is silent and the alternate spelling Bouillau is often found, not only in English texts.\n\nIsmaël Bouillaud was born in Loudun to French Calvinist parents. His father was a notaire and an amateur astronomer who was also called Ismaël (so was an elder sibling who died in infancy). Ismaël the younger converted to Catholicism at the age of 21 and was ordained a Catholic priest at the age of 26.\n\nOur subject was an early advocate of some of the ideas put forth by Copernicus (1473-1543), Galileo (1564-1642) and Kepler (1571-1630).\n\nIsmaël Bullialdus didn't accept Kepler's second law (and never discussed the third). He wouldn't use the (correct) description of planetary motion given by Huygens (1629-1695) as forward motions curved sideways by the Sun's pull. (Bullialdus once believed that the force exerted by the Sun was attractive at aphelion but repulsive at perihelion.)\n\nNevertheless Bullialdus was credited by Newton (1643-1727) for the idea of a central force of gravitation in the Solar system.\n\nIsmaël Bullialdus had proposed the inverse-square law for several physical phenomena, including gravitation, as early as 1645. He didn't follow through as much as he might have and is thus still mocked as being the finder but not the keeper of the inverse-square law. Yet, his original words were crystal-clear:\n\nAs for the power by which the Sun seizes or holds the planets, and which, being corporeal, functions in the manner of hands, it is emitted in straight lines throughout the whole extent of the world, and like the species of the Sun, it turns with the body of the Sun; now, seeing that it is corporeal, it becomes weaker and attenuated at a greater distance or interval, and the ratio of its decrease in strength is the same as in the case of light, namely, the duplicate proportion, but inversely, of the distances that is:\n\n1 / d 2\n\nIn the main, the only dubious part in this was the guess that the gravitational influence of the Sun would depend on its own rotation. (General relativity later taught us that such rotational dependence, albeit nonzero, is utterly negligible.)\n\nBullialdus was duly made a Fellow of the Royal Society on 4 April 1667.\n\nHe was a key figure in the informal République des Lettres, which was bringing about the fermentation and exchange of ideas in French, mostly through the circulation of handwritten letters. The network included the likes of Peiresc (1580-1637) and Gassendi (1592-1655).\n\nShortly after the death of Bullialdus, his entire library was dispersed. His books, manuscripts and correspondence were known as the Archive Boulliau (so spelled). A major portion of the papers was acquired by the Bibliothèque du Roi sometime before 1782. Those were later collected in 41 volumes (23000 pages) which now form the Collection Boulliau at BNF (FF. 13019-13059). Another 7000 pages of manuscripts are scattered over some 45 different archives, in a dozen countries.\n\nThe Archive Boulliau once had so much prestige that it attracted a flurry of thieves and forgers, including Guglielmo Libri (1803-1869) and the infamous Denis Vrain-Lucas (1818-1882) who would defraud Chasles (1793-1880).\n\nInverse-square law (1645) | Astronomia Philolaica (Paris, 1645)\n\nRobert Hooke\n\n(by Rita Greer, 2004)\n\nRobert C. Hooke (1635-1703, FRS 1663)\n\nMacTutor | New World | Britannica | WP | Berkeley | Robert Hooke Society [ deeds ]\n\nBorn at noon on Saturday, July 18, 1635 (that's July 28 in the Gregorian calendar) in Freshwater, on the Isle of Wight. Youngest child of John Hooke, a curate in charge of All Saints Church (Freshwater) and his second wife (1622) Cecelie Gyles, a local merchant's daughter. They had 4 children: Anne (1623), Katherine (1628), John Jr. (1630) and Robert (1635).\n\nRobert Hooke was at first expected to become a minister himself (all three of his father's brothers were). However, his sickly constitution and frequent headaches, hindered Robert's normal schooling and, eventually, he was pretty much left on his own devices at home. His depressed father hanged himself in 1648.\n\nThe way young Robert was reproducing pictures hanging in his home had impressed a visiting artist, John Hoskyns, who encouraged him to pursue drawing. In 1648, Hooke was thus sent to London for an apprenticeship under a prominent portrait painter of that era, Peter Lely (1618-1680).\n\nHowever, Robert soon decided that his youth (and a small sum from his father) would be better spent on a formal education. John Wilkins (1614-1672) made him a pupil of Westminster School, where Robert boarded in the house of the headmaster, Dr. Richard Busby (1606-1695).\n\nIn 1653, he went to Christ Church, Oxford on a choral scholarship, learning astronomy from Seth Ward (1617-1689) the third Savilian Professor, future founding member of the Royal Society (1659) and Bishop of Salisbury (1667).\n\nWilkins recommended Hooke's mechanical talents to other scientists belonging to an invisible college of London scientists meeting at Oxford: Thomas Willis, Robert Boyle, John Wallis, Christopher Wren and William Petty. He worked for them as a paid assistant in 1655 and 1656.\n\nRobert Hooke was hired before hefore he could graduate from Oxford: From 1657 to November 1661, he worked exclusively as the assistant of Robert Boyle (1627-1691). His first task was to build a vacuum pump for Boyle. He also designed a long (4 m) J-tube which allowed a precise verification of Boyle's law (1662).\n\nIn 1660, Hooke first observed the linear variation of tension with extension in an elastic spring. That's the basic law of elasticity now taught in high-school: The elongation of a spring is proportional to the force applied to it (a special case of a general principle Hooke formulated in 1678, now known as Hooke's law). By producing a practical way to measure forces in a variety of circumstances, this freed the force concept from the familiar notion of weight (which is the force exerted by gravity on any massive body near the surface of the Earth).\n\nC'est pas bien malin.\n\nLucien Refleu (1975).\n\nIn 1661, King Charles II of England (1630-1685) commissioned Sir Christopher Wren for a series of microscopical studies of insects. After accepting the commission, Wren found he lacked the time for the project and passed it on to Hooke because of his knack for drawing. On 1 January 1663, out of sheer curiosity, Hooke turned his microscope to thin slices of cork and he discovered a network of walls surrounding what he immediately termed pores or cells. The latter term stuck!\n\nIn November 1661, Hooke was appointed Curator of Experiments of the newly-formed Royal Society (formally leaving Boyle's employement). It was an unpaid position until 1665-01-11; it's unclear whether Boyle supported him in the interim or not. Hooke would serve in this capacity for over 40 years. As such, he was responsible for all experiments performed at the Society's weekly meetings. He was elected FRS in 1663.\n\nIn March 1665, the merchants of London appointed Hooke Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College, London (founded 1597). A clause in this appointment, forced him to remain a bachelor (although, unlike Newton, Hooke wouldn't always lead a celibate life). He had been provided with lodging at the College since 1664 and would live there for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1666, Robert Hooke and Giovanni Alfonso Borelli independently expounded gravitation as an attractive force, following Bullialdus (1645):\n\n\"On Gravity\", lecture by Robert Hooke at the Royal Society (1666-03-21).\n\n\"Theory of the Planets\" (1666) by Alfonso Borelli (1608-1679).\n\nThen, London burned and the course of History was changed...\n\nAfter the Great Fire of London (September 1666) Hooke became one of three city surveyors and he undertook personally more than half of the needed surveys to rebuild the city (partly on old fundations to save money that couldn't be diverted from the war effort against the Dutch). He supervised the reconstruction with Christopher Wren, until it was almost done (1674). He became quite wealthy.\n\nIn 1670, Hooke gave a lecture at Gresham College explaining that gravitation applies to all celestiall bodies and that its strength decreases with distance. He remarked that, in the absence of gravity, said bodies would move in straight lines.\n\nIn 1679, Hooke wrote a letter to Isaac Newton where he speculated that the strength of gravity might decrease inversely as the square of the distance. He later felt that Newton didn't properly credit him or others. This fueled a bitter feud between the two men.\n\nIn all fairness, Newton's Principia (1687) does acknowledge that Hooke, along with Wren and Halley, had separately appreciated the inverse-square law in the solar system. Newton also gave credit to Bullialdus for the seminal idea.\n\nIn 1678, Hooke published the general principle now known as Hooke's law (ut tensio, sic vis): A disrupted stable equilibrium tends to be restored by a force directly proportional to the extension therefrom. Stress and strain are proportional. It's approximatively so in a multitude of practical cases, including masses on springs (Hooke, 1660) and pendulums (Galileo, 1581). It's this fight between inertia and restoring forces that creates simple harmonic motion (at least as a first approximation).\n\nHooke's health degraded over the last decade of his life and he died in London on March 3, 1703. Biographical details about him are mostly due to his two friends Richard Waller (16??-1715) and John Aubrey (1626-1697).\n\nRobert Hooke was arguably the greatest experimental scientist of the 17-th Century.

[ ... ]\n\nAll that Hooke's literary executor Richard Waller found among his old friend's personal papers to flesh out the skeletal autobiography was a few schematic paragraphs about Hooke's boyhood and early life. They begin:\n\nDr. Robert Hooke was Born at Freshwater, a Peninsula on the West side of the Isle of Wight, on the eighteenth of July, being Saturday, 1635, at twelve a Clock at Noon, and Christened the twenty sixth following by his own Father, Minister of that Parish.\n\nJames Bradley\n\nJames Bradley (1693-1762)\n\nBritannica | Wikipedia | MacTutor | Select Surnames\n\nJames Bradley was born in Sherborne, Gloucestershire, but his family still owned the ancestral Bradley Castle near the market town of Wolsingham in County Durham. That land had been in the family for centuries. E.g., Roger de Bradley (1183). William de Bradley (1341).\n\n[2] Father : William Bradley (b.1640)\n\n[3] Mother : Jane Pound (born in 1656, married in 1678).\n\n[1] Siblings :\n\nGuillaume Rouelle\n\nGuillaume François Rouelle (1703-1770)\n\nWikipedia | Wikipédia (French) | France pittoresque\n\nGuillaume Rouelle was born on September 16, 1703 to a farming family near Caen, in the village of Mathieu, reputedly the birthplace of the famous poet François de Malherbe (1555-1628) after whom would be named, in 1892, the Lycée of Caen (which still hosts the Taupe Laplace).\n\nGuillaume was the oldest of 12 children. His younger brother Hilaire Rouelle (1713-1779) also became a chemist and is credited for independently discovering urea in 1773 (although Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738) had isolated it from urine as early as 1727). The two brothers are known in chemical literature as l'aîné and le cadet (i.e., the Elder and the Younger).\n\nAfter starting medical school in Caen (at Collège du Bois) Guillaume went to Paris where he specialized in pharmacy. From 1725 to 1732, Rouelle was apprenticed in Paris, in what had been the laboratory of the famous chemist Nicolas Lémery (1645-1715) under the direction of Lémery's successor, the German apothecary Johann Gottlob Spitzley (1690-1750). In his spare time, Rouelle kept studying botany and drew the attention of the leading botanists Antoine & Bernard de Jussieu, who mentored him.\n\nIn 1738, Rouelle established his own apothecary shop near place Maubert (la Maube, an infamous location of public tortures and executions). He started teaching chemistry privately and his class acquired a solid international reputation.\n\nIn 1742, he became professor of chemistry at Jardin des Plantes (then called Jardin du Roi). He was elected to the French Académie des sciences in 1744.\n\nRouelle firmly supported the variant of phlogiston theory put forth in 1703 by Georg Ernst Stahl (1659-1734). This had been introduced in France by Geoffroy the Elder (1672-1731) whose lectures at Jardin du Roi were published as Nouveau cours de Chymie in 1723, when Rouelle was still a student.\n\nIn 1754, Rouelle formally defined a base as any chemical substance which could neutralize an acid to form a salt. (Thus generalizing the theories of alkalis and acids formulated by Lémery in 1680.)\n\nMost chemists and a few luminaries of the era attended the lectures and chemical demonstrations which Rouelle put forth from 1742 to 1764, including:\n\nDenis Diderot (1713-1784) who took notes he used in the Encyclopédie.\n\nAntoine-Augustin Parmentier (1737-1813).\n\nAntoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) who attended the last lectures, in 1763-64.\n\nHe resigned on account of ill-health in 1768 and died in Passy, on 1770-08-03.\n\nAbbé Joseph-François Marie (1738-1801)\n\nBNF | Wikipedia\n\nBorn in Rodez (France) on 1738-11-25. Died in Memel (Germany) in 1801.\n\nHe revised and augmented several influential mathematics textbooks by his senior colleague et Collège Mazarin, l'abbé Nicolas-Louis de La Caille (1713-1762).\n\nL'abbé Marie taught mathematics at Collège Mazarin (Collège des Quatre-Nations) where his star student was Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833). Several essays by the young Legendre were published in Marie's own treatise on mechanics (1774). Legendre didn't want his name printed there but Marie did use the book to bring attention to his former pupil (who had graduated in 1770).\n\nTraité de Mécanique (1774)\n\nEtienne Midy (c. 1775, fl. 1846)\n\nMidy's theorem (1835) | Midy à quatorze heures (Forum in French, 2010)\n\nHis name is spelled Meidy in some records. He was probably already teaching when Napoléon instituted the lycées, in 1802. Midy himself advertised he had taught mathématiques spéciales at Cahors (1821-1826) and Orléans (1826-1832) before moving to Nantes.\n\nAt the Collège Royal de Nantes (future Lycée Clémenceau) Midy taught mathématiques élémentaires from 1833 to 1837. That post was entrusted to a young normalien (Alexandre Lepord, ENS 1834) when Midy was promoted to teach mathématiques spéciales again in 1837-1838 (after M. Dorveau resigned). Midy would be replaced in this capacity by M. Gascheau (previously, professor of physics) when a ministerial decree (1838-11-17) allowed him to retire.\n\nIn Nantes, Etienne Midy lived 3, rue Richebourg, next to his workplace.\n\n\"De quelques propriétés des nombres et des fractions décimales périodiques\" ( Forest, Nantes, 1835). 21 pages.\n\n\"Du théorème de M.

He was educated at Centrale-Auxerre and Centrale-Rouen. He entered Polytechnique at the age of 16.\n\nHe became a physician and worked as a chemist with Berthollet in Arcueil. Dulong discovered the explosive properties of nitrogen chloride in 1811, losing an eye and two fingers in the process.\n\nHe worked as a répétiteur (scientific coach) at the Ecole Normale Supérieure and was a chemical technician at Polytechnique under Louis Jacques Thénard (1777-1857) a famous teacher who had invented cobalt blue in 1802 (that pigment is still known as Thénard's blue or bleu de Thénard ). Dulong was an examiner for the entrance exam of Polytechnique (1813). He taught physics at the veterinary school of Maison-Alfort until 1827.\n\nIn 1820, Dulong and Berzelius determined that water was an oxide of hydrogen.\n\nAfter the death of Alexis Petit (1791-1820) Dulong held the chair of physics at Polytechnique from 1820 to 1829. He was thus the third holder of the chair of physics at Polytechnique, following Hassenfratz (1794) and Petit (1815).\n\nA second chair of physics would be created for Jules Jamin (1818-1886) who taught at Polytechnique from 1852 to 1881. The sixth holder of that second chair, from 1936 to 1969, was Louis Leprince-Ringuet (1901-2000; X1920N) who was instrumental in obtaining the creation, in 1958, of a third chair of physics at Polytechnique for Bernard P. Grégory (1919-1977; X1939) who would become director-general at CERN (from 1965 to 1970) after the retirement of Viki Weisskopf (1908-2002).\n\nFor his joint work with Petit (including the formulation of the Dulong-Petit law, in 1819) Dulong was elected to the physics section of the French Académie des sciences (of which he would become president, in 1828).\n\nDulong was director of scientific studies at Polytechnique from 1830 to 1838. His successor in this capacity was Gustave Coriolis (1792-1843; X1808).\n\nMaître de conférences à Normale (1830), il est professeur de chimie en Sorbonne (1832).

(Babinet would later become an examiner there.)\n\nAfter a one-year initial formation at Polytechnique, Babinet chose to specialize as an artillery officer and went through the Ecole militaire de Metz (1813) before being briefly assigned to the Fifth regiment of Artillery, in Strasbourg.\n\nAt the Restoration (1814) he left the Army to become a teacher. He was professor of mathematics in Fontenay-le-Comte and professor of physics in Poitiers (near his birthplace) before being awarded the chair of physics at Saint-Louis in 1820.\n\nFrom 1825 to 1828, Babinet delivered a course of lectures on meteorology, including meteorological optics, at ???\n\nIn 1838, he succeeded Félix Savary (1797-1841; X1815) at the Collège de France. In 1840, Jacques Babinet was elected to the Académie des sciences (General Physics section).\n\nThe primary focus of his research was the study of diffraction, which he used to measure wavelengths more accurately than ever before. In 1827, he proposed a standardization of the ångstrom based on the wavelength of the prominent red Cadmium line. (Babinet's idea was used to define the meter, between 1960 and 1983, in terms of the wavelength of a ray in the spectrum of Krypton.)\n\nHe also constructed a hygrometer and improved the valves of air pumps to achieve a high vacuum.\n\nJacques Babinet achieved considerable fame as a popularizer of science, in public lectures and popular articles on a wide range of topics: geology, mineralogy, astronomy, meteorology... He passed away in Paris on 1872-10-21, at 78.\n\nJean Hippolyte Verron-Vernier (1800-1875)\n\nThèse de mécanique (1824)\n\nHippolyte Vernier made his mark as an elite teacher. In particular, he was the very first mathematics instructor Evariste Galois ever had (starting in February 1827). At the time, Vernier was boldly shunning Euclidean tradition in favor of Legendre's textbook Elements de Géometrie (1794).\n\nVerron-Vernier entered the Ecole Normale Supérieure in 1817. (Well, it was just called Ecole Normale in those days.) He was one of only three scientists to do so that year. The other two were Joseph Avignon (1799-1867) and [Henri] Jean Adolphe Faure (1799-1879) about whom little is known.\n\nUpon graduation, in 1820, he was named agrégé en mathématiques élémentaires à Angers. This was the year before the agrégation of French professors became a national competition (it still is). Vernier's direct appointment to teach high-school seniors indicates that he was highly esteemed. His classmate, Joseph Avignon was likewise appointed in Caen at that same time, to teach science to high-school seniors and also physics to mathématiques spéciales students. When Avignon moved on two years later (1822-11-09) Vernier succeeded him in that position at the Collège Royal of Caen, where he made time to write his doctoral dissertation.\n\nIn his doctoral thesis entitled \"Distribution de l'électricité à la surface des corps conducteurs\" (July 1824) he made a modest extension to three spheres of a two-sphere result recently obtained by Poisson. His doctoral examination committee comprised Poisson himself, Cauchy and Lacroix, among others.\n\nBy the time he was appointed to Louis-le-Grand (1826) Vernier had made several other publications at the research level (analysis, electrostatics, mechanics, astronomy). A few months later, the young Galois walked into his class...\n\nIn October 1835, Véron-Vernier was promoted to the chair of mathématiques spéciales at Henri IV to replace M. Navarre (himself agrégé in 1811 and promoted inspecteur d'académie for Paris).\n\nLater in his career, Véron-Vernier became a popular writer of textbooks for primary and secondary education (weights & measures, arithmetic, geometry).\n\nHe married M. Neveu in Paris, after 1850. When he passed away in 1875, the official title of Véron-Vernier was inspecteur honoraire d'académie à Paris. He had been inspecteur d'académie at Melun, covering Seine-et-Marne.\n\nAccording to a fantastic literary legend, possibly a hoax with some elements of truth, Hippolyte fathered a mysteriously plagiarized poet called Hugo Vernier (1836-1864) born to Sarah Judith Singer on September 3, 1836 in Vimy. Legend has it that Hugo Vernier secretly married (1863) Virginie Huet, a beautiful pianist who was the younger sister of Honorine Huet, a well-known overweight French spiritualist (Théophile Gautier hired first Honorine then Virginie as preceptors for his daughters, Estelle and Judith). Hugo Vernier died a few months before Virginie gave birth to a little Vincent, in Vernon, late in 1864... The legend is still afloat to this day !\n\nPierce Morton (1803-1859)\n\nProof of the focus-directrix characterization of conics, using Dandelin spheres | Genealogy\n\nPierce Morton was born on 27 November 1803 in County Cavan, Ireland.\n\nAt Cambridge, he was a pupil of George Biddell Airy (1801-1892) who described him as \"a clever gentlemanly man, and a high wrangler, but somewhat flighty\".\n\nAround 1825, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy and also Fellow of King's College in Nova Scotia (Canada). He left the Province suddenly in April 1826.\n\nIn the first volume of the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions (1829) Morton published a new proof of the focus-directrix property of conic sections using Dandelin spheres. Earlier on, Hamilton (1805-1865) had remarked that the circle where a Dandelin sphere touches the cone defines a plane whose intersection with the plane of section is a directrix of the curve.\n\nOn 1 June 1839, Pierce Morton married an Irish lady, Louisa Somerville (1808-1850) in St. Peter's Church (Dublin, Ireland). They had four children:\n\nFrances Armytage Morton was born in 1840. She married Henry Meredith Cruise on 26 September 1857 in Anglesey, Wales (they had a son, named Meredith II, around 1860). Widowed, she married Mr. Brown in 1878. Later court documents (Morton's Trusts, 3 March 1888, pp. 310-313) refer to her as Mrs. Frances McDonald Brown. Her nickname was Fanny.\n\nPierce Edward Morton (a.k.a. Pierce Junior ) was born on 3 February 1842, in Le Havre (France) where his father was teaching. He served as a Midshipman in the Royal Navy, before moving from Cape Town to Canada, in the autumn of 1860. He was living in the household of his uncle Dr. Edward Morton, in East Gwillimbury, at the time of the 1861 Census. He drowned with two other people on August 12, 1861 in the shipwreck of the yacht Wave at \"the Eastern Gap off the Island, Toronto\" (according to a note written by his cousin in the family bible).\n\nJohn D'Arcy Morton was born on 10 January 1843.\n\nArthur Pratt Winter Morton was born in 1844 and died in 1871, leaving a widow and two children.\n\nAll four children were born in France as British subjects. At the time of the 1851 census of Wales, they were living as wards in William Griffith's home (in Holyhead, Anglesey). Their father was living nearby at the time, but he was planning a move to South Africa...\n\nAiry was instrumental in having Pierce Morton sent as Magnetic Assistant to the Cape Observatory. Morton arrived in South Africa on November 27, 1851. He passed away on April 18, 1859 and was buried in the Cape.\n\nPierce Morton is listed as the head of the Morton of Kilnacrott family in Burke's Landed Gentry. He was one of the 14 children of Charles Carr Morton and Charlotte Tatlow. His paternal grandfather was the physician Charles Morton (1716-1799) principal librarian of the British Museum from 1776 to 1799.\n\nIn the orthodox blazoning style which forbids repetitions of tinctures, the description of their coat-of-arms is quite convoluted (the punctuation is mine):\n\nErmine, on a chevron, between three ogresses,\n\neach charged with a martlet of the field,\n\nas many mascles Or, a chief, Gules.\n\nMy understanding is that the field and the three martlets are Ermine, the ogresses are Sable, the chevron and the chief are Gules and the three mascles are Or.\n\nGeometry, Plane, Solid, And Spherical, In Six Books (1830) by Pierce Morton & S.W.

He dedicated his doctoral work to a normalien (1813, agrégé in 1816): [Servien Abailard] Armand Lévy (1795-1841) maître de conférence à l'Ecole Normale (1831-) and professeur de mathématiques élémentaires (1831-1841) at Collège Charlemagne.\n\nBigourdan was awarded his agrégation on 1832-09-24 (ranked third in France) shortly after obtaining his doctorate in Paris, on 1832-08-13 (which is quite unusual) defending the following set of three theses (spanning 23 pages) in front of a committee presided by the chemist Louis-Jacques Thénard (1777-1857).\n\n1. Equation de la surface capillaire.\n\n2. Composition intérieure des fluides.\n\n3. Sur les éléments d'un sphéroïde.\n\nEtienne Bigourdan served as professeur agrégé at Louis-le-Grand (c. 1836) and professeur de physique in Limoges (-1840) just before his promotion to mathématiques spéciales in Rennes (1840-1842) and Rouen (1842).\n\nHe is correspondant de l'Académie des Sciences in 1847 (listed as professeur de mathématiques spéciales à Paris).\n\nIn the later part of his academic career, Bigourdan would fall back to less prestigious positions in mathématiques élémentaires at lycée Saint-Louis (-1852) and, finally, at lycée impérial Bonaparte (1852-1865).\n\nGuillaume Bigourdan (1851-1932) was an unrelated French astronomer who famously invented a procedure for setting up a telescope (Bigourdan method).\n\nEt.

He was also the founder of French meteorology.\n\nFrom 1827 to 1830, Le Verrier prepared for the Polytechnique entrance exam at the Royal College of Caen, when the headmaster was Jacques-Louis Daniel (1794-1862, future recteur of Caen and bishop of Coutances). His professor of mathematics was Antoine François Donat Bonnaire (1777-1839) whose son Charles Antoine Donat Bonnaire (1799-1886; X1819) taught him physics.\n\nAlthough Urbain was the most brilliant student of his class in Caen, he failed in the Polytechnique entrance competition of 1830. His father then decided to sell the family home in Saint-Lô to pay for tuition at a fancy preparatory school in Paris (Institution Mayer) which allowed Urbain to succeed in 1831.\n\nThe Institution Mayer had been founded in 1824 by Mathias Mayer-d'Almbert (1786-1843; X1805) and it employed the mathematician Charles Choquet, who would later become Urbain Le Verrier's father-in-law :\n\nCharles-Adrien Choquet (1798-1880) had been a mathematical coach at La Flèche and he would later obtain a doctorate in astronomy (1842). Mayer and Choquet published three editions (1832,1836,1841) of their Traité élémentaire d'algèbre which Choquet updated twice (1845,1849) after the death of Mayer. Then, he wrote under his own name two editions of a complement (1851,1853) and a consolidated version with a simpler title: Traité d'algèbre (1856). All edited by the dominant French scientific publisher of the era, Mallet-Bachelier (called Gauthier-Villars after 1864 and acquired by Dunod in 1971). Charles Choquet came from a family of renowned painters and engravers established in Abbeville, including his father (or uncle?) Pierre, Jean-Baptiste, Isidore Choquet (1774-1824) and his grandfather Pierre-Adrien Choquet (1743-1813).\n\nAll Mayer boarders were auditing classes at Louis-le-Grand, so that Urbain Le Verrier was taught by the legendary Louis Richard (1795-1849) professor at Louis-le-Grand (from 1822 till his death) whose students have included the likes of Evariste Galois (1811-1832), Joseph Serret (1819-1885; X1838) and Charles Hermite (1822-1901; X1842).\n\nIn 1837, Urbain Le Verrier married Lucile Marie Clotilde Choquet, (the only daughter of his former teacher Charles Choquet). They had 3 children. Their two sons became polytechniciens too: Jean Charles Léon Le Verrier (1838-1875; X1856) and Louis Paul Urbain Le Verrier (1848-1905; X1867). So did a grandson of theirs (son of the latter) Pierre Victor Joseph Le Verrier (1882-1964; X1902). Their daughter Geneviève Joséphine Lucile Le Verrier (1853-1931) was a talented pianist who studied under César Franck (1822-1890).\n\nDiscovery of Neptune | Heraldry: Roma | 72 names on the Eiffel Tower\n\nEvariste Galois (1811-1832)\n\nMacTutor | The Evariste Galois Archive | Math93 | Fictionalization | Stamp\n\nAt the age of 20, Evariste Galois was mortally wounded in a duel (against Perscheux d'Herbinville, not Ernest Duchâtelet) over a young lady called Stéphanie-Félice Poterin du Motel. Left for dead, Galois (who had no seconds) was discovered by a local peasant and transported to the Cochin hospital in Paris, where he died from peritonitis the next day (May 31, 1832).\n\nTo his brother Alfred, he had whispered:\n\nNe pleure pas, Alfred. J'ai besoin de tout mon courage pour mourir à 20 ans.\n\nPlease don't cry, Alfred. I need all my courage to die at twenty.\n\nHeld on June 2, the funerals of Galois were attended by more than 2000 people and served as a focal point of republican riots which lasted for several days. His dubious status as a martyred activist could have remained Galois' main claim to fame had it not been for his wish to have his last mathematical papers reviewed by Gauss or Jacobi... His brother, Alfred Galois and his closest friend Auguste Chevalier did send out copies of the work, which were apparently ignored by the originally intended recipients. In 1842, one of these copies reached Joseph Liouville (1809-1882) who finally published what is now known as Galois Theory, in 1846.\n\nThe story is poignant enough as it is, but some biographers are perpetuating the myth that Galois wrote feverishly all he knew about Group Theory on the night before the fateful duel, apologizing again and again for not having the time to do it better... The leading offender is clearly E.T. Bell (1883-1960) who wrote an emphatic chapter in his popular 1937 collection of biographies entitled Men of Mathematics. Actually, there's only one occurrence of such a statement in all the mathematical manuscripts of Galois (an \"author's note\" about an incomplete proof). Otherwise, the myth seems entirely based on the following sentence which appears in the letter known as \"Galois' Testament\", dated May 29, 1832 and addressed to his friend Auguste Chevalier. The passage is about extending ambiguity theory (Galois theory) from rational to transcendental functions.\n\nMais je n'ai pas le temps, et mes idées ne sont pas encore\n\nbien développées sur ce terrain, qui est immense.\n\nBut I am running out of time, and my ideas are not yet\n\nsufficiently developed in this field, which is immense.\n\nGalois' Testament ends with the following words:\n\nUntil the age of 12, Galois had been schooled entirely by his mother, Adélaïde-Marie Demante-Galois. Galois was then enrolled at Louis-le-Grand (the most prestigious lycée of Paris) as a boarder in the quatrième grade, on 6 October 1823 (or 1 April 1824, according to one Louis-le-Grand record).\n\nFor the first couple of years, Galois showed no particular interest for mathematics, in the class taught by Charles Camus (1797-1865). Born in \"Sailly-Zèle\" (Somme) Charles Louis Constant Camus had entered Polytechnique in 1815 and placed third in the scientific Agrégation for 1821 (which was the first year it took the form of a national competition).\n\nGalois became enthralled with mathematics only in February 1827, thanks to an exceptional instructor, Hippolyte Vernier, who had decided to teach from Legendre's Elements de Géometrie (1794). That textbook was then spearheading the liberation from traditional Euclidean teaching in Europe. Legend has it that Galois read the textbook in two days. After that, he neglected all other subjects.\n\nIn 1828-1829, Evariste Galois was a Mathématiques Spéciales student under Louis Richard (1795-1849) at Louis-le-Grand.\n\nAlthough he never published anything himself, Louis Richard (1795-1849) was an outstanding teacher of mathematics, in the French Grandes Ecoles tradition which is still enduring to this day (see Lucien Refleu, 1920-2005). Besides Galois, Louis Richard also taught Urbain Le Verrier (1811-1877; X1831), Joseph Serret (1819-1885; X1838) and, above all, Charles Hermite (1822-1901; X1842) whom Richard saw as most similar to Galois and who would go on to achieve the long, brilliant and prestigious career of which Galois had been deprived by a stupid early death. (Hermite also had a lasting impact by teaching the likes of Jules Tannery and Henri Poincaré.)\n\nIn April 1829, on the recommendation of Louis Richard, Galois published his first paper (Proof of a Theorem on Periodic Continued Fractions) in the Annales de Gergonne. On May 25 and June 1, 1829, he submitted to the Academy his early research on equations of prime degree (such an equation is solvable by radicals if and only if all its roots are rational functions of any two of them). He was 17.\n\nTragedy struck on July 2, 1829 when his father hanged himself in an apartment located close to Louis-le-Grand. The elder Nicolas Gabriel Galois (1775-1829) was an ardent republican who had been elected mayor of Bourg-la-Reine in 1815 (where a street now bears his name). His nemesis, the new right-wing priest of Bourg-la-Reine, had managed to frame him by forging his signature on malicious epigrams directed at Council members. The ensuing scandal was more than what Mayor Galois could take. His suicide sent the young Galois in a tailspin. The new priest officiated at the burial of the beloved Mayor, which turned into a riot... (That priest wasn't a Jesuit, in spite of what's often reported.)\n\nEvariste was scheduled to take the Polytechnique entrance exam later that month for the second and last time. Of course, he failed. Louis Richard then insisted that he should attend Normale. So, all was not lost...\n\nEvariste Galois befriended fellow republican Ernest Duchâtelet (Ernest-Joachim Armynot du Châtelet, born 19 may 1812 to a famous noble family) an effeminate law student at the time, he would later become a student at the Ecole des Chartes, a learned journalist, an absinthe alcoholic and a constant companion to one Louis-Achille Boblet (most notorious for collecting coins rescued from the Seine River). Duchâtelet had also just lost his father (1829) and his mother had passed away years earlier (1820).\n\nNormal Subgroups | Galois Rings. | Galois Fields\n\n\"Galois, le mathématicien maudit\" by Norbert Verdier (Belin, 2011).\n\nFrench dueling pistols gunsmiths (c. 1830) : Nicolas-Noël Boutet (1761-1833)\n\nLe Page | Gastinne-Renette | Le Faucheux\n\nLes condisciples de Galois en Maths spé by Olivier Courcelle (2016-08-09)\n\nYvon-Villarceau, 1883\n\n(by Eugène Pirou)\n\nAntoine Yvon Villarceau (1813-1883)\n\nSerge Mehl (French) | Villarceau circles | Wikipedia & Wikipédia\n\nBorn Antoine François Joseph Yvon, he later transformed his last name to Yvon Villarceau (which he spelled without an hyphen). Villarceau was the name of a land he once owned and bequeathed to the town of Vendôme. He became known simply as Villarceau (this avoids the confusion brought about by the fact that Yvon is a popular first name, but it wasn't his).\n\nVillarceau graduated from Ecole Centrale (1840). He is best remembered for discovering or rediscovering, in 1848, an amazing elementary fact: The intersection of a torus with a doubly-tangent plane consists of two intersecting circles (Villarceau circles).\n\nHe was a member of the French Académie des sciences.\n\n\"Théorème sur le tore\", M.

He graduated from high-school in Toulouse, first as bachelier ès lettres (1834) then bachelier ès sciences (1835).\n\nAuguste Miquel then went to Paris to prepare for the Grandes Ecoles entrance competition. He attended Saint-Louis and was also coached privately at Institution Barbet, where he proved to be extremely brilliant.\n\nLocated 3, impasse des Feuillantines (Paris V) from 1827 to 1864, the Institution Barbet was one of several competing private preparatory schools (other examples include Collège Rollin and Institution Mayer). The founder of this particular institution of higher learning was Jean-François Barbet (1799-1880) who was one of only four students who entered the scientific section of the Ecole Normale in 1820. The other three were: François Artaud (possibly the son of Alexis-François Artaud de Montor, 1772-1849), the geometer Georges Ritt (1800-1864) author of several textbooks, and Roch Roustan (1801-1870) future recteur of Aix.\n\nThe Barbet boarders were auditing the Mathématiques Spéciales lectures given at Saint-Louis, by either Delisle or Vincent. Known to his students as \"père Pancu\" (because he'd mispronounce \"perpanculaire\" instead of perpendiculaire) Augustin Delisle [Delille] had been appointed \"agrégé en mathématiques au collège royal de Henri IV\" in 1817, before agrégation became a formal competition (1821). He taught at Saint-Louis until his retirement in 1852 (he died in June 1881). On the other hand, Alexandre-Joseph Vincent (1797-1868) was a former student of Ecole Normale (1816) who had originally been appointed \"agrégé en physique à Reims\", in 1820.\n\nIn 1836, while still a student at Barbet, Auguste Miquel proved several clever theorems about intersecting circles. At that critical stage of his curriculum, such specialized research may have taken too much of a toll: Miquel didn't make the cut for Polytechnique or Ecole Normale. Shortly thereafter, he would start earning a living as a high-school teacher, with the lowly rank of régent, without ever becoming an agrégé or obtaining a doctorate.\n\nMiquel was a staunch republican. He published his anti-royalist views in social-democratic journals. In those days, that didn't do much good for his humble career, which can be summarized as follows (from scattered nomination records):\n\n-1838 : Régent de mathématiques, Collège de Nantua.\n\n1838-1840 : Régent de mathématiques, Collège de Saint-Dié.\n\n-1842 : Régent de mathématiques élémentaires, Collège de Castres.\n\n1842- : Régent de mathématiques, Collège de Bagnols.\n\n1842-11-09 : Granted a one-year sabbatical.\n\n-1846 : Professeur, Collège de Castres.\n\n-1849 : Régent de mathématiques, Collège du Vigan.\n\n1849- : \"... appelé à d'autres fonctions.\"\n\nNOTE: In the same period, an unrelated \"Miquel\" held positions in primary education at Seyne (1840) Barcelonnette (1841) and Toulon (1843-1855).\n\nMiquel called syntrepent curves two planar curves which rotate about two fixed points as they roll on each other without slipping. He coined the word isotrepent for a curve syntrepent to itself (the ellipse is a great example).\n\nAuguste Miquel's first scientific publication appeared in 1836 on page 486 of the short-lived monthly journal Le Géomètre, founded that same year by the liberal activist Antoine-Philippe Guillard (1795-1870) a former student at Ecole Normale (1813) who had been appointed \"agrégé de mathématiques au collège royal de Louis-le-Grand\", in 1819.\n\nMiquel's subsequent work was mostly published in Joseph Liouville's Journal de mathématiques pures et appliquées (founded in 1836) including:\n\n\"Sur quelques questions relatives à la théorie des courbes\",\n\nJournal de mathématiques pures et appliquées, III, pp. 202-208 (1838).\n\n\"Théorèmes de Géometrie\", JMPA, III, pp. 485-487 (1838).\n\n\"Théorèmes sur les intersections des cercles et des sphères\",\n\nJournal de mathématiques pures et appliquées, III, pp. 517-522 (1838).\n\n\"Mémoire de Géometrie\", JMPA, IX, pp. 20-27 (1844).\n\n\"Mémoire de Géometrie (deuxième partie)\", JMPA, X, pp. 347-350 (1845).\n\n\"Mémoire de Géometrie (troisième partie)\", JMPA, XI, pp. 65-75 (1846).\n\nHe also used the pedagogical counterpart (1842-1927) of Liouville's journal:\n\n\"Problème d'Optique\",\n\nNouvelles annales de mathématiques, 5, pp. 235-238 (Paris, 1846).\n\nAuguste Miquel died in 1851, at age 35, in obscure circumstances.\n\nEnseigner les mathématiques au XIXème siècle | Miquel point | Miquel's pentagram | Miquel's Theorem (Dutch)\n\nVictor Alexandre Puiseux (1820-1883)\n\nPh.D 1841 | MacTutor | Academic career (French) | Weisstein | Wikipedia\n\nVictor Puiseux was born in Argenteuil (where a lycée and a street now bear his name) but his family relocated to Lorraine when he was three years old. Victor received his secondary education at the Collège de Pont-à-Mousson.\n\nUpon graduation from high-school (1834) Puiseux was awarded a scholarship to attend Collège Rollin, a top-notch Parisian preparatory school where Charles Sturm (1803-1855) was still professeur de mathématiques spéciales (1830-1838). Rollin students also attended lectures in lycée Louis-le-Grand. Puiseux entered Ecole Normale Supérieure in 1837 and obtained his agrégation in 1840 (ranking first nationally, ahead of his older classmate Charles Toussaint, 1817-1892).\n\nThat stellar performance earned Puiseux a position of chargé de conférence at Ecole Normale in Paris for one year (1840-1841). That gave him enough free time to prepare for a doctorate, which he duly obtained on 1841-08-21, at the ripe old age of 21, with two reportedly uninspired theses (23 pages total) entitled:\n\n1. Sur l'invariabilité des grands axes des orbites des planètes. [Updated in 1878.]\n\n2. Sur l'intégration des équations du mouvement d'un système de points matériels.\n\nPuiseux was then nominated (1841) professeur de mathématiques élémentaires au collège royal de Rennes. where he was promoted professeur de mathématiques spéciales the next year (1842-11-14) thus succeeding Etienne Bigourdan who went on to a similar position in Rouen.\n\nThe job Puiseux thus left in 1842 was given to one Mr. Thiébault, coming from Bourges. In 1844, Puiseux (possibly foregoing an offer of a University position) would be officially ordered to hold on to his position in Rennes, because his own suppléant (Mr. Paignon, agrégé in 1844) would himself be called upon to teach in mathématiques élémentaires for the duration of a leave of absence (1 year) then granted to the aforementioned Thiébault.\n\nVictor Puiseux then became professor of pure mathematics at the University of Besançon for two years (1845-1847). Elected secretary of the Faculty in 1847.\n\nThe occupation of Victor Puiseux in 1848 is unknown to this writer at this time.\n\nIn 1849, Puiseux went back to Paris as a maître de conférence in Ecole Normale, replacing Jean-Marie Duhamel (1797-1872; X1814). He would hold this position until 1855. Simultaneously (in 1853), he was appointed to the Collège de France as suppléant of Jacques Binet (1786-1856; X1804) in the chair of astronomy.\n\nIn 1856, Victor Puiseux is chargé de cours at the Sorbonne and soon succeeds Augustin Cauchy (1789-1857) as professor of mathematical astronomy and celestial mechanics. He held that chair for 26 years (1857-1883) until his death.\n\nPuiseux was the doctoral advisor of Camille Jordan (1860). On 1878-01-18, his only other doctoral student (Spiru Haret, 1851-1912) defended a thesis bearing the exact title Puiseux himself had used for his own doctoral work, 36 years earlier, namely: Sur l'invariabilité des grands axes des orbites des planètes.\n\nWhat Haret established in his doctoral work, using third-order pertunation methods, was that the principal axes of planetary orbits undergo secular variations, which would seem to make them unstable in the long run. That surprising result was an inspiration for the chaos theory of Henri Poincaré. It was also the motivation for later work (1954) by Kolmogorov who was almost able claim the absolute stability of the Solar system for deeper reasons.\n\nSimultaneously, Puiseux served as maître de conférence from 1862 to 1868 at Ecole Normale, where he taught probabilities and differential calculus. He held a post at the Bureau des Longitudes (in the bureau des calculs service) from 1868 to 1872.\n\nHe was elected, by a unanimous vote, to the geometry section of the Académie des sciences on 1871-07-10.\n\nVictor Puiseux also rose to the administrative rank of inspecteur général de l'Instruction publique, hors cadre. As such, in 1880, he was put in charge of inspecting \"all primary schools educating holders of State scholarships\". This strange parlance was the way all public elementary schools were called, just before the momentous 1881 reforms famously instigated by Jules Ferry (prior to which, all families who could afford it were paying full tuition to educate their children, even in the public system).\n\nPuiseux died at the age of 73, on 9 September 1883, in Frontenay, the village of the family of his new daughter-in-law, shortly after her wedding (1883-06-21) to his eldest son, Pierre. He had requested that no speech should be made over his dead body. He had six children but was survived by only two sons, both of them astronomers: Pierre Puiseux (1855-1928) and André Paul Puiseux (1858-1931).\n\nPuiseux series 1850 (Newton, 1676) | Bertrand-Diquet-Puiseux theorem | J. Dieudonné on Algebraic Geometry\n\nGuillaume Jules Hoüel (1823-1886)\n\nMacTutor | Wikipedia\n\nJules Hoüel was born on April 7, 1823 in the small town of Thaon (10 km NW of Caen, spelled \"Than\" before 1843, which is the way the name is still pronounced). He was educated at the Lycée Royal de Caen and at the Collège Rollin in Paris, which housed one of the top preparatory schools.\n\nThe private Collège Rollin took that name in 1830. It had been founded in 1821 by Joseph Planche and l'abbé Charles Nicolle (1758-1835) as a \"new\" Collège Sainte-Barbe and was once called Sainte-Barbe Nicolle or Sainte-Barbe Rollin to distinguish it from the older Sainte-Barbe revived by Victor de Lanneau (1758-1830) in 1798 on Montagne Sainte-Geneviève The latter, which lasted until 1999, was built on the same land as the historical Collège Sainte-Barbe founded in 1460, which gave it a much stronger claim to the prestigious historical name, as was legally recognized in 1830. Sainte-Barbe (Barbara) being the patron saint of miners, engineers, architects and mathematicians is also the patron saint of Polytechnique, which explains the great symbolic prestige of her name for a French preparatory school.\n\nIn 1876, Rollin would move from its original location (rue Lhomond) to its current address (avenue Trudaine). It lost its private status and was taken over by the municipality, becoming Lycée Rollin in 1919. The school was renamed in 1944 after the communist resistance fighter Jacques Decour (1910-1942) who had started teaching there in 1937, under his real name of Daniel Decourdemanche.\n\nHoüel became normalien in 1843 and agrégé in 1847 (7 out of 9 that year). He first taught in the lycées of Bourges, Bordeaux, Pau and Alençon (1851).\n\nOn 1855-08-18, he obtained a doctorate for a thesis in celestial mechanics which impressed Urbain Le Verrier who offered him to join the Observatoire de Paris. Hoüel turned down that offer. Instead, he spent a couple of years on independent mathematical research at his family home in Thaon.\n\nHe was appointed professor of Mathématiques spéciales at Caen for just a few weeks (January-March 1856) to replace Charles Toussaint who became censeur of the lycée at that time. In March, Antoine-Xavier Planes took over. Toussaint got his old job back in October.\n\nIn 1858, Hoüel was appointed to the chair of pure mathematics in Bordeaux, which he held until he retired (1884). He had a passion for non-Euclidean geometry and a gift for languages: In 1866, he learned Russian to translate Lobatchevsky and Hungarian to read Bolyai... In his translation of their work (1870) Houël published a proof of Beltrami (1868) which marks the high point of the subject.\n\nWith the younger Gaston Darboux (1842-1917) Jules Hoüel became founding editor of Bulletin des sciences mathématiques et astronomiques in 1870.\n\nBlog à Maths | Norbert Verdier | François Plantade\n\nThéophile Pépin (1826-1904) older brother ?? of...\n\nJean François Pépin (1829-??; X1849)\n\nWikipedia\n\nPépin's counterexamples to the Hasse principle for curves of genus 1.\n\nPépin's test\n\nLouis Paul Cailletet (1832-1913)\n\nGenealogy & Bio (French) | Britannica | Wikipedia\n\nBorn on 21 September 1832 in Châtillon-sur-Seine (Côtes d'Or; Eastern France). He was educated at Lycée Henry LV in Paris. He attended École des mines de Paris in 1852-1853, with his brother Camille (1834-1860).\n\nPaul Cailletet was the first person to liquefy oxygen (1877-12-02) using the Joule-Thomson effect for which he received the Davy Medal in 1878, with the Swiss physicist Raoul Pictet (1846-1929) who reported the same feat by different means on 1877-12-22.\n\nEmile Léonard Mathieu (1835-1890; X1854)\n\nMacTutor | Wikipedia | Mathieu functions | Mathieu groups | Mathieu transform\n\nBorn on 5 May 1835 to Nicolas Mathieu, caissier à la recette générale and his wife Amélie Antoinette Aubertin. He passed away on 19 October 1890 (aged 55) in Nancy where he had been holding a chair of mathematics since 1873.\n\nHe received his doctorate (Docteur ès Sciences) in 1859 for a thesis on transitive functions which would lead him to the discovery (between 1860 and 1873) of the five sporadic simple groups now named after him.\n\nThe personal address he gave when he entered Polytechnique (1854) was 12 rue Chevremont (Metz, Moselle). Emile Mathieu had been ranked 168 on the entrance exam and was 152 out of 158 students passing into the second year.

One teacher there was Oscar Schlömlich (1823-1901) who had studied at Berlin under Dirichlet and Steiner. Schlömlich noticed the mathematical abilities of Roch and persuaded him to switch his major to mathematics and physics. To accomplish this effectively, Roch had to take remedial courses at a private institution outside of the Polytechnic Institute.\n\nIn 1859, Roch published his first paper in Schlömilch's Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik (a journal founded by Schlömilch three years earlier). In the Spring of 1859, Gustav Roch entered the University of Leipzig.\n\nRiemann-Roch theorem (Riemann 1857, Roch 1865)\n\nFrançois Edouard Anatole Lucas (1842-1891)\n\nMacTutor | Wikipedia | Anne-Marie Décaillot (1999) | Roland Brasseur (2014)\n\nEdouard Lucas is the most prominent French number-theorist of the nineteenth century. As number theory wasn't fashionable in French Academia, Lucas made a living outside of his specialty.\n\nHe was born in Amiens (where a College and a street now bear his name) to a family of modest means. Of his 10 siblings, 2 were stillborn and 2 died young. Edouard was a brilliant student and would always be supported by scholarships.\n\nAfter graduating from high-school in Amiens (1859), Edouard Lucas attended mathématiques spéciales for two years at the lycée impérial de Douai, first under Claude David (1811-1864) then under Louis Painvin (1826-1875). On his second try, Lucas became a normalien in Paris (1861).\n\nHe got his agrégation in 1864, outranked only by Gaston Darboux (1842-1917). Because he was not yet 25, his official nomination as agrégé was delayed.\n\nLucas was an associate astronomer at the Paris Observatory from 1864 to 1869, in the midst of a long period of bitter tensions (1854-1870) between the scientific staff and the director Urbain le Verrier (1811-1877; X1831) the discoverer of Neptune (1846-08-31).\n\nStarting in 1867, Lucas would escape from Le Verrier's constant mobbing by studying mathematical problems in his hometown of Amiens. He became acquainted with the mathematics pertaining to the industrial weaving of fabrics (using Jacquard punchcards) through the work of another native of Amiens: Edouard Gand (1815-1891) who had founded the Société industrielle d'Amiens in 1861. This would provide the topic of Lucas' first publication (1867).\n\nLucas was sacked by Le Verrier in the Summer of 1869 and appointed to teach high-school seniors in Tours, with a decrease in pay (1869-09-08). His refusal of the position left him with only a low allocation and he joined the army as a junior officer. He served as a decorated artillery officer in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) and rose to the rank of captain.\n\nOn 1872-04-10, he was nominated professor of mathématiques spéciales in the small town of Moulins, where he stayed until he was offered more desirable positions in Paris, alternating between Lycée Charlemagne (1876-1879, 1890-1891) and lycée Saint-Louis (1879-1890). He was granted an extended leave of absence from Saint-Louis for two school years (1882 to 1884) after the death of his wife of 9 years (Marthe Boyron, 1852-1882, mother of his two children). During that time, he prepared an edition of the works of Fermat.\n\nHis last transfer from Saint-Louis to Charlemagne (1890-08-20) was actually a switch of equivalent positions between himself and Gaston Gohierre de Longchamps (1842-1906). Several students of Saint-Louis had threatened to leave the school if they were assigned to the class of Lucas, because they thought that his style would not prepare them adequately for the competition they were facing. Apparently, Lucas did not face the same (unfounded) rejection at Charlemagne, where he ended up spending the last year of his life.\n\nLucas died at the age of 49 (3 October 1891) from a severe infection following a freak accident: A waiter had wounded his cheek with a broken plate at a banquet of the Association française pour l'avancement des sciences (AFAS). Edouard Lucas is buried in Montmartre Cemetery.\n\nIn 1876, Lucas proved the primality of a 39-digit number (the 12th Mersenne prime) which would remain the largest known prime for 75 years (until 1951):\n\n2127 - 1 = 170141183460469231731687303715884105727\n\nTo do so, over the course of 19 years (he had started to work on the problem at age 15) Lucas eventually devised a specialized primality test for Mersenne numbers (i.e., numbers which come just before a power of two). That test was streamlined in 1930 by Derrick H. Lehmer (1905-1991) as part of his own doctoral dissertation at Brown University. The Lucas-Lehmer test remains, to this day, the most efficient way to prove the primality of some large numbers.\n\nThe most prominent publication of Edouard Lucas on Number Theory is:\n\nThéorie des nombres 528 pages (Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1891)\n\nLucas polynomials (1878) | Towers of Hanoi (1883) | Umbral calculus | Lucas pseudoprimes\n\nJules Tannery (1848-1910)\n\nMacTutor | Wikipedia | Dico Spé | Career\n\nLike his older brother Paul Tannery (1843-1904), Jules Tannery was an alumnus of the \"Taupe Laplace\" (Lycée Malherbe de Caen) where he taught briefly (1871-1872) early in his career. His star student at the time was Léon Lecornu (1854-1940) who later became a member of the Académie des sciences. Tannery earned his doctorate in 1874 at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) under Charles Hermite (1822-1901; X1842) [the man who had proved the transcendentality of e just one year earlier, in 1873].\n\nJules Tannery was first appointed at ENS-Ulm in 1881 and also took up lecturing duties at ENS-Sèvres in 1882, shortly after its creation (that counterpart of ENS-Ulm for girls had been created in 1881 and fused with ENS-Ulm in 1985). Tannery supervised four doctoral students, including Jacques Hadamard (1865-1963, who proved the Prime Number Theorem) and Jules Drach (1871-1949).\n\nOther students of Tannery's at ENS included the likes of Paul Painlevé (twice a Prime Minister of France, in 1917 and 1925) and Émile Borel (1871-1956). Jules Tannery was elected to the French Académie des sciences in 1907.\n\nTannery devised the teardrop-shaped surface of revolution pictured at left, dubbed Tannery's pear, as a single lobe of the two-lobe algebraic surface (degree 4) of cartesian equation:\n\n8 a2 (x2 + y2 ) = (a2 - z2 ) z2\n\nParametrically, for both lobes:\n\nx = (a / Ö32) sin u cos v\n\ny = (a / Ö32) sin u sin v\n\nz = a sin u/2\n\nEvery geodesic curve (like the bold line shown at left) is an algebraic closed curve that goes around the axis twice and crosses itself once!\n\nIf need be, the entire surface described by the above unrestricted equations can be called Tannery's hourglass (it consists of two distinct congruent Tannery pears sharing the same axis and the same cone-point ). The cone's half-angle is:\n\nArctg 1/Ö8 = 19.47122...°\n\nJules Tannery is also remembered for Tannery's Limiting Theorem which states that the limit of an infinite sum is the sum of the limits, under certain conditions...\n\nMathematical Genealogy | Teaching Geometry | Tannery's Limiting Theorem\n\nFrançois Proth (1852-1879)\n\nThe Prime Pages | Wikipedia | Up Closed\n\nProth was a promising self-taught French mathematician who made a living as a farmer. He died young. The causes of his death are unknown. Biographical details about him are scarce. He published 4 papers on number theory.\n\nHe is best known for Proth's theorem (1878) which provides an efficient primality test for integers of the form k . 2n + 1 with k < 2n (Proth numbers).\n\nIn 1878, eighty years before Norman L. Gilbreath, Proth formulated what's best known as the Proth-Gilbreath conjecture. Originally a simple doodle, that conjecture is ultimately a statement about the distribution of the primes (Proth gave an erroneous proof in 1878).\n\n2357111317 19232931374143 47535961677173 7983 1224242 4626424 6626426 46 1022222 2442222 0442242 2 1200000 2020002 4020220 0 1200002 2220022 4222020 1200020 0020202 2002222 1200220 0222220 202000 1202020 2000022 222000 1222222 2000200 00200 1000000 2002200 02200 1000002 2020200 2020 1000020 2222202 2220 1000222 0000220 002\n\nFrançois Proth was a farmer in the small village of Vaux-devant-Damloup (near Verdun, France) where the famous Fort de Vaux is located.

That's the only such revival in the infamous red zone of the Verdun battlefield (72 inhabitants in 2014).\n\nProth numbers | Proth primes | Proth's theorem | Gilbreath's conjecture (Proth, 1878.

Before graduation, he was appointed professeur de physique in a newly-created position at Collège de Barbezieux (1886-02-13) future Lycée Elie Vinet. Petit duly graduated from ENS in 1886 with an Agrégation in physics (again, taking the very last slot; 9/9).\n\nIn 1886, he became sous-directeur in the Laboratoire des Hautes-Etudes created by Berthelot. In March 1889, Petit obtained a doctorate in chemistry.\n\nThereafter, he spent his entire career in Nancy, where he was first appointed chargé de cours in chemistry on 1889-10-31. In 1893, Petit founded the Ecole de Brasserie de l'Université de Nancy, of which he was the first administrator. In 1894, he was appointed Professeur de Chimie Agricole. He later rose to the rank of Doyen de la Faculté des Sciences de Nancy.\n\nOn 28 March 1919, Paul Petit was instrumental in the creation of the Institut Métallurgique et Minier de Nancy, a major engineering school which everybody would soon call Les Mines de Nancy. The official name changed several times. Since 1985, it is: Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy. Paul Petit was its first academic director in 1919 (when it was part of the University of Nancy).\n\nEcole des Mines de Nancy (1919-2009)\n\nHenri Eugène Padé (1863-1953)\n\nMacTutor | Wikipedia | \"Asymptotology\" by Igor V. Andrianov & Leonid I. Manevitch\n\nHenri Padé was born on 1863-12-17 in Abbeville to a family hailing from the nearby rural village of Cahon (250 inhabitants; modern French postal code 80132). His father, Jean-Baptiste Domice Padé, was a rouennier (see below) born in Cahon on 1821-02-15, the son of a shepherd born in 1790 and the grandson of a weaver born in 1765. Henri's mother, Joséphine Pétronille Eléonore Thiébault was born in Cahon on 1831-09-27. She was the daughter of a weaver born in 1794. Jean-Baptiste and herself were married in Cahon on 1859-02-25.\n\nRouenneries are cotton fabrics in which threads were dyed in various shades of red before weaving. Such threads were first spun in 1787, on state-owned spinning machines operating in Rouen (hence the name). Weaving was mostly done in the Pays de Caux around Yvetot. That was the fashion for over 60 years, from the First French Empire onward. In 1863, about 60,000 looms were in operation in the Pays de Caux and another 20,000 were located in nearby Picardy, where Cahon is.\n\nPeople who worked the fields in summertime would work the looms in the Winter. A loom was attended by one weaver and one assistant (who was often a woman or a child). This occupation was more highly regarded than agriculture and those who did both called themselves weavers (tisserands). On Henri's birth certificate, Jean-Baptiste Padé said he was marchand de rouenneries, implying he would mostly trade or sell the merchandise, rather than weave it himself (unlike a tisserand, employed by a fabricant). Shortly after Henri's birth, the shortage of cotton brought about by the American Civil War (1861-1865) precipitated the downfall of this rural activity, which was subsequenly mechanized on an industrial scale, in Amiens and elsewhere.\n\nHenri Padé completed his secondary education in Lille at the age of 17 (his baccalaureate was officially awarded on 1881-09-30). He then underwent two years of preparatory school at Lycée Saint-Louis.\n\nPadé entered the prestigious Ecole Normale Supérieure in 1883, tenth of a list of 20, given below in order of merit. The first 11 were nominated on 1883-08-07 in a list of 20. Of those, 9 chose Polytechnique and were replaced by a list of 9 published on 1883-10-19. Only the next-to-last on that second list (Pierre Labarbe) chose Polytechnique and he was replaced by Paul Petit on 1883-10-27.\n\nUnexplicably, the 1884 summary of the results below showed only 19 names. Paul Franc was omitted (although his misspelled name is still in the current records of the ENS). My guess is that he passed away in 1883 or 1884. The only other trace of Paul Léon Félix Franc I could find is from Recueil des lois et actes de l'instruction publique (1883, p. 652) which says that he won a Prix d'honneur (1883-08-06) in the Concours Général for students competing outside Paris & Versailles, as a mathématiques apéciales student at the Lycée de Nancy under Alphonse Hervieux (1846-1906, ENS 1867).\n\nJules Riemann (1863-1941).

Founded Mines de Nancy school in 1919.\n\nThe star of that class, Jules Riemann, was ranked first overall upon admission and first in mathematics upon graduation (see below). He doesn't seem to be directly related to Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866). In physics, top honors went to Paul Janet, son of the French philosopher Paul [Alexandre René] Janet (1823-1899).\n\nAt least three of the above (Cor, Painlevé and Pad&eacute) would go to Göttigen after graduation, to study under Klein and Schwarz. Apparently, Padé had to take a longer route to do so (see below).\n\nHenri Padé was awarded two licence degrees in August 1885 (Mathematics on the 15th, Physics on the 20th). For ENS students, this was mostly a formality which served as insurance against the very real possibility of failing the agrégation competition later (back in those days, there were only 13 open slots per year in mathematics and 9 in physics).\n\nIn 1886, six \" élèves sortants de l'ENS \" got their Agrégation de Mathématiques. Namely: Jules Riemann (1) Eugène Cosserat (2) Narcisse Cor (5) Henri Padé (6) Maurice Lelieuvre (7) and Paul Painlevé (9/13). Two made it in physics: Paul Janet (1/9) and Paul Petit (9/9).\n\nThat wasn't the end of it, since you could compete any time after graduation. Among those who entered ENS in 1883, two made it in mathematics on their second attempt in 1887 (in a competition dominated by Vessiot and Hadamard) namely: Louis Régis (4) and André Puzin (12). Likewise, Lucien Poincaré was successful in the physics contest of 1887 (6).\n\nTwo of their classmates had to wait a bit longer: Raymond Le Vavasseur got his agrégation in 1889 (ranked 3rd, in Mathematics) and Colléatte was finally successful in 1893 (ranked 4th, in Physics). All told, 13 of the 20 students who entered ENS in 1883 ended up agrégés (9 in Mathematics, 4 in Physics).\n\nAt first, Padé was appointed professor of mathematics at the lycée de Limoges (which became lycée Gay-Lussac on 1889-02-09 ). Henri Padé's nomination, dated 1886-09-04, was said to be temporary as was the custom for junior faculty. He was indeed immediately reassigned to Carcassonne instead (1886-10-21, still temporarily, of course). The lycée de Carcassonne had been created in 1853 as an upgrade to the old collège communal (it took the name of Lycée Paul Sabatier in 1960, when it moved from its original location at 89, rue de Verdun).\n\nPadé's next appointment was at Montpellier (1887-10-29) in the Grand Lycée (of Medieval origin) which became the Lycée Joffre when it moved in 1947.\n\nAt that time, Henri Padé published his first scientific paper, which dealt with the irrationality of e and p (1888).\n\nIn 1889, he took a sabbatical from Montpellier to study in Germany. He first spent one semester at Leipzig, where he took the course of Adolph Mayer (1839-1908) on the differential equations of mechanics. (He registered on 1889-10-18 and passed his final exam on 1890-03-28.) Padé then transferred to Göttingen where he stayed for the entire year 1890-1891 (he was granted an unpaid leave of absence on 1890-12-03, as a former professor at Montpellier). On 1891-05-05, Padé obtained a degree in mathematics from Göttingen, having attended lectures by Felix Klein (1849-1925) and Hermann Schwarz (1843-1921). At that time, he translated into French Felix Klein's celebrated Erlangen Program (1872) for the Annales de l'Ecole Normale Supérieure (1891).\n\nBack to France, Padé undertook doctoral work under Charles Hermite (1822-1901) while resuming his teaching career with an appointment at the Lycée de Poitiers (1891-09-19) at a senior rank (2-ème classe) contrasting with his previous nominations (6-ème classe). A few months later (1891-12-11) he was appointed to the Lycée de Lyon to teach a preparatory class for Saint-Cyr.\n\nOn Friday 1892-04-08 at 14:00, Henri Padé defended his doctoral thesis on the theory of what we now call Padé approximants: Sur la représentation approchée d'une fonction par des fractions rationelles. Besides Hermite (thesis supervisor) the jury consisted of Emile Picard (1856-1941) and Paul Appell (1855-1930). Padé passed avec toutes boules blanches (i.e., by unanimous vote). His lesser thesis was entitled Formation des groupes fuchsiens. Fonctions modulaires. Padé officially received his doctorate on 1892-06-21.\n\nAlso in 1892, he published a small educational book, prefaced by Jules Tannery, entitled: Premières leçons d'algèbre élémentaire, nombres positifs et négatifs, opérations sur les polynômes (Gauthier-Villars & fils, Paris).\n\nIn 1893, he left his position in Lyons and was appointed (1893-09-02) to a newly-created position near his hometown, teaching high-school seniors \"A\" at the Lycée of Lille (which took its current name of Lycée Faidherbe that very year).\n\nIn January 1897, Padé became Maître de conférences at the nearby University of Lille, succeeding Emile Borel (1871-1956) who had been appointed to ENS in Paris. Padé taught rational mechanics at IDN from 1897 to 1901, putting to good use what he had learned from Adolph Mayer in Leipzig, 7 years earlier.\n\nIn 1901, Padé left Lille for Poitiers, as chargé de cours. In June 1902, he was promoted Professor of Rational and Applied Mechanics at the University of Poitiers, suceeding Antoine Henri Durrande (1831-1904; ENS 1851). In November 1903, Henri Padé accepted an appointment as Professor of Mechanics at the University of Bordeaux (as re-founded on 10 July 1896) where he would become Doyen de la Faculté des Sciences on 1906-12-07.\n\nOn 1906-12-17, Padé received the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences by winning a competition on \"better convergence criteria\" for algebraic continued fractions. His submission consisted of two sealed covers (plis cachetés filed in February and June 1903). This marked the peak of his research career.\n\nPadé ended his career as a university professor on 1908-11-17, at age 44, to become the youngest Rector in France (there were 13 rectors at the time) successively heading the Académies of Besançon (November 1908) Dijon (1917) and Aix-Marseille (1923) where he retired in 1934, at the age of 70.\n\nPadé became a Knight of the Legion of Honor on 1910-05-06 (decorated by Appell) and was promoted Officer of the Legion of Honor on 1927-03-09.\n\nHenri Padé passed away in Aix-en-Provence at the age of 89, on 1953-07-09. He was survived by his wife of 60 years, Hélène Caudron, whom he had married in Abbeville on 1893-08-12 (she was born on 1876-01-15, died on 1955-12-15 and is burried next to her husband). Both Henri and Hélène Padé were good musicians. He was fond of Schumann and Schubert. She played a grand piano. They had three daughters. The eldest married before 1922. The youngest, Odette, was the second wife of Georges Bonfils and the mother of Claude Bonfils.\n\nHélène & Henri Padé, at Beaucourt on 6 June 1922.\n\nBetween 1888 and 1907, Henri Padé wrote 42 scientific articles, without any co-authors. 29 of his papers are about continued fractions or Padé approximants.\n\nA Brief History of Padé Approximants :\n\nIn 1730, James Stirling (1692-1770) and Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) independently introduced Padé approximants. Around the same time, Euler (1707-1783) gave Padé-type approximations to the sums of some series.\n\nIn 1740, according to Claude Brezinsky (Birth and early developments of Padé approximants) one George Anderson stumbled upon three different rational approximations to the logarithm function. Anderson was apparently a resident of Twickenham who is only known through the eight mathematical letters he sent to William Jones (1675-1749) between 1736 and 1740 (at which time he said he was going to the University of Leyden, the oldest university in the Netherlands).\n\nIn 1758, Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728-1777) found some Padé approximants by direct computations of their coefficients.\n\nIn 1776, Lagrange (1736-1813) obtained such approximations from the convergents of continued fractions.\n\nIn 1837, Kummer (1810-1893) used approximants as convergence accelerators.\n\nIn 1845, Jacobi (1804-1851) expressed Padé approximants using determinants.\n\nIn 1861, Padé approximants appeared in the doctoral thesis of Hermann Hankel (1839-1873).\n\nIn 1870, the doctoral thesis of Frobenius (1849-1917) established some relations between Padé approximants. Padé was surely unaware of this in 1892.\n\nIn 1873, Charles Hermite (Padé's future thesis advisor) proved e to be transcendental by using simultaneous Padé approximants of several series.\n\nThe methods introduced by Padé in his 97-page thesis (1892) were used for divergent series in the book which Emile Borel (1871-1956) published in 1901.\n\nPadé approximants were given their modern name by E.B. Van Vleck (1863-1943) who also coined the locution Padé table in a 1903 paper. At a meeting of the AMS in Boston (1903) Van Vleck issued the following clarification:\n\nThe existence of approximants was, of course, well-known before Padé, but no systematic examination of them had been made except by Frobenius, who determined the important relations which normally exist between them. Padé goes further, and arranges the approximants, expressed each in its lowest terms, into a table.\n\nIn 1948, the subject was resurrected for good by Hubert Stanley Wall (1902-1971) who had earned his doctorate in 1927 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a thesis on that topic, under the aforementioned E.B. Van Vleck.\n\nIn 1987, a monograph of Adhemar Bultheel (c.1948-) extended the scope of Padé approximants from one-sided formal power series to two-sided Laurent series.\n\nMathematical Genealogy | Padé tables | Continued fractions | Ellipse perimeter\n\nErnest Paulin Joseph Vessiot (1865-1952)\n\nMacTutor | Dico Spé | L'œuvre scientifique de M. Ernest Vessiot by Elie Cartan (1947)\n\nIn the 1884 entrance exam to the Ecole Normale Supérieure, Vessiot was second only to Jacques Hadamard (1865-1963) who was subsequently a classmate of his. In the agrégation contest of 1887, he finished first and Hadamard second.\n\nAfter his brilliant graduation, Vessiot held several teaching positions, starting at Lyons in 1887, then Lille (1892) Toulouse, Lyons again and Paris (1910).\n\nErnest Vessiot obtained his doctorate in 1892, under C. Emile Picard (1856-1941) with a dissertation about the action of continuous groups of transformations (Lie groups) on the independent solutions of a differential equation. In that domain, he would later extend results of Jules Drach (1902) and Elie Cartan (1907).\n\nIn 1914, he succeeded François Cosserat (1852-1914; X1870) as president of the Société Mathématique de France. Vessiot would hold the post of director of the Ecole Normale Supérieure until his retirement in 1935. Anong his few doctoral students: Jacques Herbrand (1930) and Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin (1934).\n\nHe was elected to the Académie des Sciences in 1943.\n\nPh.D. 1892 | Picard-Vessiot theory | Mathematical Genealogy | Correlator\n\nJules Joseph Drach (1871-1949)\n\nMacTutor | Wikipedia & Wikipédia | Work of Jules Drach\n\nJules Drach did his doctoral work at Ecole Normale Supérieure under the supervision of Jules Tannery (just like Jacques Hadamard earlier).\n\nDrach was chargé de cours at the University of Poitiers when Henri Padé left for Bordeaux and he took over Padé's duties. In 1904, he was officially appointed as the successor of Padé in the chair of Mécanique rationnelle et appliquée.\n\nMathematical Genealogy | Rues de Ludres\n\nAndré Gérardin (1879-1953)\n\nChristian Boyer (2005)\n\nBorn in Nancy.

Those are now commonly called Poulet numbers in his honor (they're also known as Fermatians or Sarrus numbers ).\n\nIn 1918, Paul Poulet discovered the first aliquot cycle (where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of its predecessor) namely:\n\n( 12496, 14288, 15472, 14536, 14264 )\n\nIn 1925, Poulet published 43 new multiperfect numbers, including his discovery of the first two known 8-perfect numbers.\n\n\"Sur les nombres multiparfaits\" by Paul Poulet,\n\n49th conference of the Association française pour l'avancement des sciences (Grenoble, 1925)\n\n\"Tables des nombres composés inférieurs à 50 000 000 répondant au théorème de Fermat pour le module 2\"\n\nby Paul Poulet, 50th conference of the Association française pour l'avancement des sciences (Lyon, 1926)\n\n\"Tables des nombres composés vérifiant le théorème de Fermat pour le module 2, jusqu'à 100 000 000\"\n\nby Paul Poulet, Sphinx (Brussels), 8, pp. 42-45 (1938).\n\nJacques André Bloch (1893-1948; X1912)\n\nMacTutor | Wikipedia | The Mathematician in the Asylum of Charenton\n\nMathematics is a dangerous profession;\n\nan appreciable proportion of us go mad.\n\nJohn Edensor Littlewood (1885-1977)\n\nReally? In about 500 world-class thinkers whose biographies were srutinized to produce Numericana, only 15 have suffered serious mental disorders at some points in their lives (often unrelated to stressful thinking): Aitken, Baire, Boltzmann, Cauchy, Cavendish, Eisenstein, Gödel, Grothendieck, Heaviside, Nash, Newton, Perelman, Petryshyn, Tesla and Turing. Just 3% of them (or 5%, to allow for underreporting). If anything, that's less than the general prevalence...\n\nFortunately, very few go criminally insane, the way André Bloch did just before turning 24. Thereafter achieving mathematical productivity and ultimate serenity alone in the corridor of a lunatic asylum, for the remaining 31 years of his life...\n\nAndré Bloch was born on 20 November 1893, in Besançon (14, Grande Rue) to Alfred Abraham Bloch (1855-1910) and his wife Lucie Didisheim (1871-1912) . A year later, 13 November 1894, his brother Georges was born, who had similar mathematical abilities (Lucien Georges Bloch, 1894-1917; X1912).\n\nTheir mother, Lucie Didisheim, was from a wealthy family of Jewish watchmakers. She was the daughter of Jacques Didisheim (1834-1889) and his wife Fanny Juvenia Goldschmidt (1845-1917) after whom the Juvenia watchmaking house was called, which her husband created in 1860.\n\nThere was also a slighty older sibling nicknamed Riquet : Henry Bloch (1891-1972) who married Marcelle Marcita Henrieta Frankfurt (1904-1993) and had four children, including the literary critic Marie-Claude de Brunhoff (1929-2007) who was married for 39 years (1951-1990) to Laurent de Brunhoff (1925-) perpetuator of the Babar saga, created in 1931 by his father, Jean de Brunhoff (1899-1937) who was the maternal uncle to the future French Resistance fighter, Auschwitz deportee and communist politician Marie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier (1912-1996) née Vogel.\n\nFollowing the advice of Professor Sarrus (who taught them high-school mathematics in 1908-1909) André and Georges prepared together for the entrance exam to Polytechnique at the lycée of Besançon, under the excellent tutelage of Georges Valiron (1884-1955; ENS 1919) who had this to say about them:\n\nThe two brothers would spend two years (1910-1912) in Valiron's mathématiques spéciales class of about 11 students. Both failed the Polytechnique exam on their first try, in the Summer of 1911. They were orphaned when their mother passed away on 22 January 1912, 6 months before the next opportunity. They probably stayed in Besançon (and in Valiron's class) with the help of their uncle, as may be implied by the press clipping reproduced below. Both brothers were admitted to Polytechnique in the Summer of 1912. André ranked #151, thanks to the exceptional grade from Vessiot. Georges was #229. André was also brilliantly admitted to ENS (13th) but chose to enter Polytechnique with his brother.\n\nThey spent a year of military service and had a year of scientific studies. Then war broke out and they were both called to serve as artillery officers. After suffering a head injury and losing an eye, Georges was declared unfit for active duty and returned to Polytechnique in October 1917. Likewise, André had been assigned to the 117ème régiment d'artillerie lourde and had fallen from the top of his attacked observation post, sustaining a head injury which was impairing his return to duty. So it was that both brothers were in Paris in November 1917...\n\nOn 17 November 1917, between noon and one o'clock, André showed up for a fateful family lunch at the residence of his aunt and uncle (an important Swiss watch manufacturer) in Paris, 104 Boulevard de Courcelles. He shot all three guests (the maid escaped) but his uncle had enough life left in him to put up a fight and André stabbed him repeatedly with a table knife until he collapsed (about 50 wounds were reported). André's three murder victims were:\n\nHis 23-year old brother:\n\nLucien Georges Bloch\n\n(1894-1917; X1912).\n\nHis 43-year old uncle: Charles Didisheim (1874-1917).\n\nHis 33-year old French aunt: Clothilde Linda Didisheim, née Olivetti, (1884-1917). Daughter of Salvador Olivetti (1833-1902) and Emilie Angélique Falco (1852-1925) the second wife he wed on 1869-11-17.\n\nLinda Olivetti was the younger half-sister of the man who founded the Olivetti typewriter company in 1908 (a son of Salvador and his previous wife Elvira Sacerdoti, 1849-1919) Camillo Olivetti (1868-1943) whose own son Adriano Olivetti (1901-1960) would pioneer electronic printing and oversee the development of the first Italian mainframe solid-state computers, conceived by Mario Chou (1924-1961): the Elea series. About forty Elea 9003 were produced, paving the way for the release in 1964 (!) of the first commercial desktop computer, the Programma 101 (P101) of which 44000 units were manufactured over a period of several years; selling in the US for $3850 each. Such game-changing technological advances, with a huge future, attracted more than their fair share of nefarious attention and two wrongful deaths were even suspected by the investigative biographer Meryle Secrest (1930-) in her book The mysterious affair at Olivetti (2019). The technological spirit of innovation which the Olivetti family brought to their hometown of Ivrea (near Turin) arguably survives with the Arduino® platform, which was invented in Ivrea too, well after the demise of Olivetti as an independent company.\n\nAndré didn't resist arrest after the deed. His first words to the police were cryptic to them: Je me suis vengé de mon état atavique (I avenged my atavism). André was distressed by the history of mental illness which ran in the family of his mother (the Didisheim watchmakers) and blamed it for his own misery. More so than his war injury. He saw the murders as part of his own eugenic duty; a way to prevent his uncle from procreating. Or so he said:\n\nIt's a matter of mathematical logic.\n\nThere had been mental illness in my family.\n\nIn his book Des hommes comme nous ( [patients are] people like us) the psychiatrist Henri Baruk, who served at Charenton, describes the daily routine which was followed for 31 years by the person he only identified as the mathematician of Charenton :\n\n\"Every day for forty years [sic] this man sat at a table in a little corridor leading to the room he occupied, never budging from his position, except to take his meals, until evening. He passed his time [writing] algebraic or mathematical signs on bits of paper, or else plunged into reading and annotating books on mathematics whose intellectual level was that of the great specialists in the field. [...] At six-thirty he would close his notebooks and books, dine, then immediately return to his room, fall on his bed and sleep through until the next morning. While other patients constantly requested that they be given their freedom, he was perfectly happy to study his equations and keep his correspondence up to date.\"\n\nAndré Bloch came to the attention of the mathematical community at large through a brilliant note he sent to Jacques Hadamard (1865-1963) about paratactic circles, a term apparently coined by Julian Lowell Coolidge (1873-1954) in his 602-page authoritative book A Treatise on the Circle and the Sphere (1916).\n\nHadamard was so impressed by the note that he immediately proposed a dinner invitation to Bloch, who said he had to decline but would be delighted if Hadamard could come and visit him instead at \"57 Grande rue, Saint-Maurice\". Hadamard didn't realize until he actually arrived there that it was the address of the infamous Charenton house for the criminally insane (now carrying a lesser stigma as Hôpital Esquirol 12/14 rue du Val d'Osne, 94410 Saint-Maurice).\n\nHis situation as a Jewish inmate in an insane asylum was potentially a dangerous one during the Nazi occupation of France and Bloch published under the pseudonyms of René Binaud or Marcel Segond during that period. Bloch kept up an active correspondance with many well-known mathematicians of the day, besides Valiron:\n\nGeorge Pólya (1887-1985).\n\nDr. [Bernardo] Baidoff of Buenos-Aires,\n\nHenri Cartan (1904-2008).\n\nJacques Hadamard (1865-1963).\n\nEmile Picard (1856-1941).\n\nPaul Montel (1876-1975).\n\nGösta Mittag-Leffler (1846-1927).\n\nSzolem Mandelbrojt befriended him and was apparently his last visitor before he died from leukemia on 11 October 1948. Bloch died before the appointment he had with Binyamin Amira (1896-1968) who was visiting from Jerusalem.\n\nAmong the last works of André Bloch was a 141-page book written with Gustave Guillaumin (1886-1953; X1905) a retired ingénieur-en-chef des ponts et chaussées and former student of Joseph Valentin Boussinesq (1842-1929). Guillaumin had been active in research but stopped publishing when he fell ill in 1924 . He was momentarily hospitalized in Charenton too. Their joint work, entitled La géométrie intégrale du contour gauche, was published in 1949, by Gauthier-Villars with a preface by Elie Cartan (1869-1951).\n\nShortly before his death, André Bloch was awarded the Prix Becquerel from the French academy of sciences.

Hardy and Ted Titchmarsh. She first met J.E. Littlewood as he was sitting in her doctoral jury. With him, she pioneered the use of chaos theory in radio engineering (1945). She was the first female mathematician to be elected (1947) to the Royal Society. Mary Cartwright was Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge from 1948 to 1968 and was knighted in 1969.\n\nShe was born on 17 December 1900 at Church Cottage, Aynho, Northamptonshire, third of the five children of Rev. William Digby Cartwright and his wife, Lucy Harriette Maud, née Bury. Three days after the Birth of Quantum Theory.
