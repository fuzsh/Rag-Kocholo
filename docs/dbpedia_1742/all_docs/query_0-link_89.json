This decision was taken in a context marked by a deterioration in exposure figures for French plants and by the new recommendations issued by the ICRP. This document describes the policy adopted by EDF at both corporate and plant level to meet these objectives, by: (1) setting up management systems which were responsive but notmoreÂ Â» cumbersome; (2) a broad policy of motivation; (3) the development and use of suitable tools. The document then describes some quite positive results of EDF`s ALARA policy, giving concrete examples and analyzing the changes in global indicators.Â«Â less\n\nThe Evolution of Minehunting in France (L’Evolution de la Chasse aux Mines en France),\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1983-07-13\n\nThe Necessity of Minehunting in France And why are the French , Ohl such a small number of experts, interested in minehunting?

A new process to heat greenhouses with water at 303 K using a double-wall plastic mulching laid directly on the soil has been successfully used for a few years on several hectares. When necessary, heat pumps are utilized. Very good results have been obtained for tomatoes, cucumbers, flowers, and strawberries, etc. Outdoor soil heating with buried pipes has been tested in Cadarache near an experimentalmoreÂ Â» pressurized water reactor for market garden crops and forestry. Gains in precocity and yield have been excellent, especially for asparagus, strawberries, and potatoes. Growing of eels has been four times faster in warm water over one year.Â«Â less\n\nLow flows and reservoir management for the Durance River basin (Southern France) in the 2050s\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSauquet, Eric\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe Durance River is one of the major rivers located in the Southern part of France. Water resources are under high pressure due to significant water abstractions for human uses within and out of the natural boundaries of the river basin through an extended open channel network. Water demands are related to irrigation, hydropower, drinking water, industries and more recently water management has included water needs for recreational uses as well as for preserving ecological services. Water is crucial for all these activities and for the socio-economic development of South Eastern France. Both socio-economic development and population evolution will probably modify needs for water supply, irrigation, energy consumption, tourism, industry, etc. In addition the Durance river basin will have to face climate change and its impact on water availability that may question the sustainability of the current rules for water allocation. The research project RÂ²DÂ²-2050 \"Risk, water Resources and sustainable Development within the Durance river basin in 2050\" aims at assessing future water availability and risks of water shortage in the 2050s by taking into account changes in both climate and water management. RÂ²DÂ²-2050 is partially funded by the French Ministry in charge of Ecology and the RhÃ´ne-MÃ©diterranÃ©e Water Agency. This multidisciplinary project (2010-2014) involves Irstea, ElectricitÃ© de France (EDF), the University Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris), LTHE (CNRS), the SociÃ©tÃ© du Canal de Provence (SCP) and the research and consultancy company ACTeon. A set of models have been developed to simulate climate at regional scale (given by 330 projections obtained by applying three downscaling methods), water resources (provided by seven rainfall-runoff models forced by a subset of 330 climate projections), water demand for agriculture and drinking water, for different sub basins of the Durance River basin upstream of Mallemort under present day and under future conditions\n\nFrance Without NATO\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1966-04-08\n\nand unstable France .

To describe the epidemiological features of EV infections diagnosed during the year 2013 in the Greater Paris area (Ile de France). During 2013, 2497 samples taken from 470 patients in 33 hospitals of Ile-de France were tested for EV genome by RT-PCR. EV genotyping was performed by the National Reference Centre (NRC) laboratories. EV infections were retrospectively reviewed by retrieving clinical and genotyping data from the NRC database. Of the 2497 samples, 490 (19.6%) was positive for EV genome detection. These EV infections represented 88.7% and 24.1%, respectively, of all reported regional and national infections. Twenty-seven different genotypes were identified. Echovirus 30 (E-30) accounted for 54.1% of all characterized strains and caused a large outbreak. Four severe neonatal infections were reported, of which two were caused by EV-A71. Respiratory infections involving EV-D68 were observed in two adults. One fatal case of Coxsackievirus A2-associated myocarditis was reported. Monitoring EV infections in combination with EV genotyping via the French EV network characterized the epidemiology of EV infections in the Ile de France region in 2013 and documented severe EV infections associated with EV-A71 or CV-A2.

Therefore, earthquakes observed during the instrumental period (since 1962), and associated catalogs, cannot be representative of the seismic cycle for the French metropolitan territory. In such context it is necessary, when performing seismic hazard studies, to consider historical seismic data in order to extend the observation period and to be more representative of the seismogenic behavior of geological structures. The French macroseismic database SisFrance is jointly developed by EDF (ElectricitÃ© de France), BRGM (Bureau de Recherche GÃ©ologique et MiniÃ¨re) and IRSN (Institut de Radioprotection et SuretÃ© NuclÃ©aire). It contains more than 6,000 events inventoried between 217 BC and 2007 and more than 100,000 macroseismic observations. SisFrance is the reference macroseismic database for metropolitan France. The aim of this study is to determine, over the whole catalog, the completeness periods for different epicentral intensity (Iepc) classesâ¥IV. Two methods have been used: 1) the method of Albarello et al. [2001], which has been adapted to best suit the French catalog, and 2) a mathematical method based on change points estimation, proposed by Muggeo et al. [2003], which has been adapted to the analysis of seismic datasets. After a brief theoretical description, both methods are tested and validated using synthetic catalogs, before being applied to the French catalog. The results show that completeness periods estimated using these two methods are coherent with each other for events with Iepc â¥IV (1876 using Albarello et al. [2001] method and 1872 using Muggeo et al. [2003] method) and events with Iepc â¥V (1852 using Albarello et al. [2001] method and 1855 using Muggeo et al. [2003] method). Larger differences in estimated completeness period appear when considering events with Iepc â¥VI (around 30 years difference) and events with Iepc â¥VII (around 50\n\nEDF's studies and first choices regarding the design of electrical equipment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParis, Michel; Metzger, Gisele; Pays, Michel; Pasdeloup, Maurice\n\n1988-01-01\n\nIn the performance of its studies and in its first choices, Electricite de France has taken into account the three parameters that have been judged essential for its electrical installations: flammability and flame propagation; smoke opacity; and corrosiveness and toxicity of emitted gases. In this research, materials tests have been widely developed in order to insure simple manufacturing controls, and to decrease the costly testing of near to full size models.\n\n[Perceptions and attitudes regarding noise in urban areas: the example of the Ile-de-France region].\n\nPubMed\n\nGrange, DorothÃ©e; Chatignoux, Edouard; GrÃ©my, Isabelle\n\n2010-01-01\n\nNoise is the subject of increasing attention for the French, especially in highly urbanized areas where its sources are multiple. In this context, this article aims to gain a better understanding of the how the specificities of the Ile-de-France region influence perceptions, attitudes and expectations of its inhabitants with respect to noise. The article is based on the regional use of results extracted from the national Environmental Health Barometer 2007 study by the INPES, the French National Institute for Prevention and Health Education. First and foremost, noise is perceived as a source of discomfort and inconvenience, in particular in Ile-de-France, while the related consequences of noise exposure for health were of secondary importance and not necessarily influenced by the degree of urbanization. The preoccupation with noise was much more important in the Ile-de-France region than in the rest of the country. Furthermore, a significant proportion of young people, particularly the Paris region, are exposed to high noise levels during their leisure time. These results are useful to better understand the expectations and needs of Parisians in terms of policies needed for information and education, prevention and reduction of noise.\n\nHome-to-work trips during the transportation strikes in Ile-de-France at the end of 1995\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n1998-10-01\n\nIn November and December 1995, the region of Ile-de- France experienced strikes resulting in a virtually complete interruption of public transport.

During the observation period, 1970-1989, 4,151 new cases of cancer occurred. Each participant's cumulative exposure to magnetic fields was estimated based on measurements of current exposure of 2,066 workers performing tasks similar to those in the cohorts using personal dosimetry. Estimates were also made of past exposure based on knowledge of current loading, work practices, and usage. Workers who had more than the median cumulative exposure to magnetic fields (3.1 microtesla (microT)-years) had a higher risk for acute nonlymphoid leukemia (odds ratio (OR) = 2.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-5.44). The same observation holds for acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.20-8.27). There was also an elevated risk for mean exposure above 0.2 microT (acute nonlymphoid leukemia, OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.00-5.58; acute myeloid leukemia, OR = 2.25, 95% CI 0.79-6.46). However, there were no clear dose-response trends with increasing exposure and no consistency among the three utilities. Men whose cumulative exposure to magnetic fields was above the 90th percentile (15.7 microT-years) had an elevated risk for brain cancer (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 0.76-5.00) that was not statistically significant. No association with magnetic fields was observed for any of the other 29 types of cancer studied, including skin melanoma, male breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Controlling for potential confounding factors did not change the results.\n\nAssessment of the water balance over France using regionalized Turc-Pike formula\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLe Lay, Matthieu; GarÃ§on, RÃ©my; Gailhard, JoÃ«l; Garavaglia, Federico\n\n2016-04-01\n\nWith extensive use of hydrological models over a wide range of hydro-climatic contexts, bias in hydro-climatic data may lead to unreliable models and thus hydrological forecasts and projections. This issue is particularly pregnant when considering mountainous areas with great uncertainties on precipitations, or when considering complex unconservative catchments (e.g. karstic systems). The Turc-Pike water balance formula, analogous to the classical Budyko formula, is a simple and efficient mathematical formulation relating long-term average streamflow to long-term average precipitation and potential evaporation. In this study, we propose to apply this framework to assess and eventually adjust the water-balance before calibrating an operational hydrologic model (MORDOR model). Considering a large set of 350 french catchments, the Turc-Pike formula is regionalized based on ecohydrologic criterions to handle various hydro-climatic contexts. This interannual regional model is then applied to assess the water-balance over numerous catchments and various conditions, such as karstic, snow-driven or glaciarized and even anthropized catchments. Results show that it is possible to obtain pretty realistic corrections of meteorological inputs (precipitations, temperature or potential evaporation) or hydrologic surface (or runoff). These corrections can often be confirmed a posteriori by exogenous information. Positive impacts on hydrologic model's calibration are also demonstrated. This methodology is now operational for hydrologic applications at EDF (ElectricitÃ© de France, French electric utility company), and therefore applied on hundreds of catchments.\n\nCombustion of Schlamm in ACFB boilers -- The Charbonnages de France Group's experience\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSchroeder, M.; Rollin, J.P.\n\nWithin the context of the rehabilitation of Emile Huchet Power Plant Unit 4 owned by the ``SNET'', a company of the CHARBONNAGES DE FRANCE Group, a new CFB boiler with an electrical capacity of 125 MW has been commissioned in 1990 in replacement for an existing pulverized-coal boiler. This boiler constituted at the time an experimental unit on two accounts. It was an innovation through its size but also its specific design which allows to burn schlamm--a coal washing residue--in the form of pulp. The boiler design answered the CHARBONNAGES DE FRANCE Group's need to eliminate old settling ponds containingmoreÂ Â» schlamm which, from the technical and economic point of view, could not be burnt using conventional combustion techniques owing to its specific characteristics (fine, high-ash product with a very high moisture and clay content). This original method of injection as well as the pulp preparation process suited to this type of injection have been designed and developed by CdF INGENIERIE and the CERCHAR (CdF Group) after many investigations and tests. The experience gained at Emile Huchet Power Plant for more than 7 years confirms that the CFB boiler is a clean combustion technique which is perfectly suited to the combustion of schlamm injected in the form of pulp. The CFB unit burns exclusively schlamm conditioned in the form of pulp with 33% of moisture, and this with a high degree of efficiency, low emission values and a very good availability. This talk include a description of the CFB boiler and the pulp preparation plant as well as a presentation of the boiler performances and of the experience gained by the CHARBONANGES DE FRANCE Group since the new CFB unit has been commissioned.Â«Â less\n\nConservation and promotion of the geological heritage in the Â«Ile-de-FranceÂ» region (France): Establishment of a decision support-tool based on inventory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAuberger, Elise; GÃ©ly, Jean-Pierre; De Wever, Patrick; Merle, Didier\n\n2017-04-01\n\nBased on an initiative by the \"Regional Commission of Geological Patrimony\" (CRPG), the French state and the regional government of Ile-de-France co-financed the setting up of an inventory with the aim of safeguarding geological sites of patrimonial interest. This project forms part of larger scale policies, at the national and European level. Geological studies in the Paris region began as early as the 18th century, in the fields of cartography and paleontology. Later on, prominent scientists like G. Cuvier, A. Brongniart and A. d'Orbigny established the first concepts in sedimentology and stratigraphy through the description of Cenozoic fossil sites that rank amongst the richest in the world and geological formations in the Paris Basin. Eventually, later on, five historical stratotypes were established in the Ile-de-France region. Yet, at present, this geological heritage is constantly threatened by expanding urbanisation. To conserve this diverse geological patrimony, we have set up a protocol composed of 4 main actions: i) The exhaustive and objective referencing of geological sites in Ile-de-France. This information is centralised in a database, which currently comprises 639 sites (mainly of anthropic nature such as quarries) ii) The pre-selection of sites (298 out of the initial 639) based on sufficient accessibility and potential geological interest. iii) The use of a method of description and hierarchisation - following the guidelines of the National Geological Heritage Inventory Program (INPG) - on the pre-selected sites. iv) Establishment of a schedule specifying actions of geo-conservation which will take into account the patrimonial value of the sites, but also their threats, their juridical status and the socio-economic context of the region. The purpose of this program is to conserve a collection of geological sites that reflect the totality of the regional geology in Ile-de-France.

Instead of a chimney sweep competing during his free time (as in 1903), the recent winner is a highly trained, professional cyclist whose entire life-style has been dedicated to reach his pinnacle during this event. The TDF has been held successfully for 100 years, but the application of the physiologic sciences to the sport is a relatively recent phenomenon. Although some historical reports help to understand the unique physiological characteristics of this race, scientific studies were not available in Sports Science/Applied Physiology journals until the 1990s. The aim of this article is to review the history of the TDF. Special emphasis is placed on the last decade where classic physiology has been integrated into applied scientific cycling data.\n\nFibre optique Ã la maison en Pays de Gex et de Bellegarde\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNone\n\n2010-05-19\n\nLe Syndicat Intercommunal dâElectricitÃ© de lâAin(SIEA) dÃ©ploie un rÃ©seau FTTH (Fiber To The Home) de fibres optiques dans le dÃ©partement de lâAin vers lâensemble des habitations.

Project compares quantitatively outpatient drug prescriptions in France, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Data were obtained from national databases; the unit of measurement was defined daily dose per 1000Â inhabitants. The five most prescribed drug classes were compared in each country in 2009, then benzodiazepines and antibiotics from 2006 to 2012. A literature review was focused on the context of prescriptions for each country. In 2009, the five most prescribed drug classes in the four countries represented seven classes in total. France was not the biggest prescriber of drugs, but from 2006 to 2012 benzodiazepines and antibiotics were prescribed much more in France than in the other countries. The evolution of prescriptions was different for each country, and very stable in France. In 2009, France was not the biggest drugs consumer of all classes, but was characterized by high prescriptions in some classes.

A decade long history of infertility might have placed her at risk for condemnation, but her husband's known urologic abnormalities played in her favor. This presentation will address the penile deformity of her husband, Henry II, and how this likely played a crucial role in her eventual rise to power, the interventions undertaken with regard to her purported infertility, and the historical ramifications when Catherine de Medici went on to have children. A review of the literature of the lives of Catherine de Medici, King Henry II, and their children was completed. The inability to conceive an heir in the first decade of Catherine de Medici's marriage was attributed to Henry II, who was born with hypospadias and chordee. Through the intervention of Doctor Jean Fernel, the royal couple went on to have 10 children. When Henry II died in 1559 Catherine de Medici went on to rule France in the name of her sons for the next 3 decades, until her death in 1589. Henry II was born with hypospadias and chordee, and this contributed to the inability of Catherine de Medici to conceive a child for the first 10 years of their marriage. The cure of \"her\" infertility changed the course of history, as she subsequently ruled in the name of her sons following the death of Henry II.\n\n[History of clinical pharmacology in France: adaptation, evaluation, defense and illustration of drug in France 1978-1981].\n\nPubMed\n\nMontastruc, Paul\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis text illustrates some unknown aspects of the history and beginnings of clinical pharmacology in France in the late 1970s and early 1980s From the current situation, development and objectives of clinical pharmacology are recalled as well as obstacles necessary to overcome to change the paradigm in the field of drug evaluation and appropriate use in France.

Workshop from the SociÃ©tÃ© de Pneumologie de Langue FranÃ§aise (SPLF)].\n\nPubMed\n\nPatout, M; Zysman, M; Raherison Semjen, C; Perez, T; Cuvelier, A; Roche, N\n\n2014-10-01\n\nA workshop has been organized in April 2013 by the SociÃ©tÃ© de Pneumologie de Langue FranÃ§aise about COPD epidemiology and COPD screening in France and other European countries. This article deals with epidemiological data and their consequences on the French screening strategy. According to the most recent data, spirometric prevalence of COPD in France is 7.5% in individuals over 45 years old. During 2000-2002, COPD was responsible for 1.4% of all causes of death in France and was mentioned to be an associated cause of death in 3% of all death certificates. The average medical costs for one COPD patient is estimated to be 4366 â¬/year, until 7502 â¬/year in very severe COPD patients. All clinical studies that have been performed in France show that COPD screening via mini-spirometry is feasible in general practice or in an ambulatory setting; however, a mass screening proved to be difficult to perform. A simple technique like the Piko-6(Â®) implies a concomitant formalized training. The non-reimbursement by the French Social Security is also a limiting factor, as the absence of medical and economical validation of this strategy. Therefore, COPD screening should be focused to individuals at risk and should include tobacco issues and cessation. COPD screening strategies have to be medically evaluated and experiments have to take the specificities of the French health organization into consideration. Any COPD screening strategy should be considered as an overall fight against the tobacco epidemics.\n\n[Description of unused drugs collected in pharmacies in the Puy-de-DÃ´me region in France].\n\nPubMed\n\nMarchiset-Ferlay, N; Gerbaud, L; Sauvant, M P; Jaffeux, P; Manhes, G; Leblanc, N; Coste, F; Andriollo, O\n\n2001-12-01\n\nAn unused drug (UD) is defined as a drug which is purchased, after prescription or not, but which is not taken. Public health campaigns in France have requested people to return these drugs to their pharmacy. To data, few data have been available concerning the quantity of collected UD and their potential re-use. A study was performed in the pharmacies of the Puy-de-DÃ´me region in France to describe the UD circuit. A random sample of 1 out of 5 pharmacies in the Puy-de-DÃ´me region (France) were defined by single level stratified sampling from the list of all pharmacies operating in the region. An exhaustive record of all UD people brought back to these pharmacies was made in 1998 during three 1-week periods. The following data were recorded for each UD: the name of the drug, the pharmaceutical industry code (CIP), the price, the rate of social Security refunding, the mention of \"free specimen\" on the package, the inscription on the list of poisonous substances and on the list of essential drugs defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), the registration on the list of drugs reserved for hospital use, the packaging notice (opened or not), the therapeutic class, and the formulation. 10,254 US (717kg) were collected during the study period. The therapeutic classes of the UD were similar to those of drugs purchased in France. According to the selling price, these UD had an economic value of 405,845FF (i.e. 3.6% of Social Security refundings paid in the Puy-de-DÃ´me region during this same period). Only 20% of the UD were potentially reusable for humanitarian purposes. Their estimated economic value was 87,456FF (i.e. 0.78% of the annual Puy-de-DÃ´me Social Security refunding). Moreover, 43.4% of the reusable drugs were on the WHO list of essential drugs. Although the volume of collected UD is high, use by humanitarian associations is on the decline because of the cost of collection and low economic yield. Furthermore, UD must be collected in a systematic manner\n\nStrategy proposed by Electricite de France in the development of automatic tools\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCastaing, C.; Cazin, B.\n\n1995-03-01\n\nThe strategy proposed by EDF in the development of a means to limit personal and collective dosimetry is recent. It follows in the steps of a policy that consisted of developing remote operation means for those activities of inspection and maintenance on the reactor, pools bottom, steam generators (SGs), also reactor building valves; target activities because of their high dosimetric cost. One of the main duties of the UTO (Technical Support Department), within the EDF, is the maintenance of Pressurized Water Reactors in French Nuclear Power Plant Operations (consisting of 54 units) and the development and monitoring of specialized tools.moreÂ Â» To achieve this, the UTO has started a national think-tank on the implementation of the ALARA process in its field of activity and created an ALARA Committee responsible for running and monitoring it, as well as a policy for developing tools. This point will be illustrated in the second on reactor vessel heads.Â«Â less\n\nPhysical fitness levels of adolescents in the Ile de France region: comparisons with European standards and relevance for future cardiovascular risk.\n\nPubMed\n\nVanhelst, JÃ©rÃ©my; Fardy, Paul S; Chapelot, Didier; Czaplicki, GrÃ©gory; Ulmer, Zekya\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe aim was to assess physical fitness in French schoolchildren in the region of Ile de France and to compare the results with European countries. The relationship between physical fitness and future health profile was of particular interest. Participants were 1851 French youth in the Ile de France region. Cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular endurance, speed, flexibility and speed agility were tested. Independent t-tests were used to compare differences between different variables. Spearman's rho correlation coefficients assessed the relationship between body mass index, socio-economic status and physical fitness. Boys were physically fitter than girls with the most significant difference being in agility. Subjects of normal weight have significantly better results than overweight or obese adolescents (+10Â·9% to 56Â·1%) (P<0Â·05). Subjects with high socio-economic status had better physical fitness than those with low socio-economic status (+0Â·5% to 9Â·4%) (P<0Â·05). Results also showed that the percentage of adolescents at increased future cardiovascular risk was 15Â·3% and 10Â·2% for boys and girls, respectively. Physical fitness in French schoolchildren living in the region of Ile de France is relatively low and unfavourable, especially in girls, when compared with existing European test results. In contrast, the adolescent boys are generally fitter and also above the average of the European data. Introducing a health promotion curriculum in the schools of Ile de France is suggested to improve health and physical fitness.

The emissions simulated during the feedstock production stage were input to a life-cycle assessment of candidate biofuel pathways: bioethanol from wheat, sugar-beet and miscanthus, and biodiesel from oilseed rape. Compared to the widely-used methodology based on fixed emission factors, ecosystem modeling lead to 55-70% lower estimates for N2O emissions, emphasizing the importance of regional factors. The life-cycle GHG emissions of first-generation biofuels were 50-70% lower than fossil-based equivalents, and 85% lower for cellulosic ethanol. When including indirect land-use change effects, GHG savings became marginal for biodiesel and wheat ethanol, but were positive due to direct effects for cellulosic ethanol.

The Consortium of Bechtel, ElectricitÃ© De France, and Battelle, in cooperation with subcontractor ÐÐ¡Ð, recently completed the conceptual design for a New Safe Confinement (NSC) building to reduce Shelter corrosion, to mitigate the consequences of potential collapse, and to enable the safe deconstruction of unstable structures. The arch-shaped NSC will be constructed at a distance from the Shelter to minimize radiation exposure to construction workers, and then slid into place over the Shelter. After sliding, cranes and othermoreÂ Â» tools inside the NSC will be remotely operated for deconstruction of the Shelter. The NSC is designed for a 100-year life. Bechtel designed the arch structure and was responsible for project management functions. ElectricitÃ© De France designed the foundations and designed deconstruction of the Object Shelter unstable elements. Battelle performed safety analyses and environmental impact assessment.

France is one of the chosen countries for Spanish doctors to develop their professional career. The French health care system belongs to the Bismarck model. In this model, health care system is financed jointly by workers and employers through payroll deduction. The right to health care is linked to the job, and provision of services is done by sickness-funds controlled by the Government. Primary care in France is quite different from Spanish primary care. General practitioners are independent workers who have the right to set up a practice anywhere in France. This lack of regulation has generated a great problem of \"medical desertification\" with problems of health care access and inequalities in health. French doctors do not want to work in rural areas or outside cities because \"they are not value for money\". Medical salary is linked to professional activity. The role of doctors is to give punctual care. Team work team does not exist, and coordination between primary and secondary care is lacking. Access to diagnostic tests, hospitals and specialists is unlimited. Duplicity of services, adverse events and inefficiencies are the norm. Patients can freely choose their doctor, and they have a co-payment for visits and hospital care settings. Two years training is required to become a general practitioner. After that, continuing medical education is compulsory, but it is not regulated. Although the French medical Health System was named by the WHO in 2000 as the best health care system in the world, is it not that good. While primary care in Spain has room for improvement, there is a long way for France to be like Spain. Copyright Â© 2015 Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de MÃ©dicos de AtenciÃ³n Primaria (SEMERGEN).

Radiocarbon dated to â40,700 14C years before present, this specimen is one of the most recent Middle Paleolithic Neandertals. The diaphysis derives from an archeological level indicating alternating human and carnivore (mostly hyena) occupation of the cave, reinforcing the close proximity and probable competition of Middle Paleolithic humans with large carnivores for resources and space. Morphological aspects of the diaphysis and ancient DNA extracted from it indicate that it is aligned with the Neandertals and is distinct from early modern humans. However, its midshaft cortical bone distribution places it between other Middle Paleolithic Neandertals and the ChÃ¢telperronian Neandertal from La Roche-Ã -Pierrot, supporting a pattern of changing mobility patterns among late Middle Paleolithic Neandertals on the eve of modern human dispersals into Europe.

Analysis of this unusual event showed that it could recur on an even larger scale. The sanitary consequences were less frequently assessed in this analysis, particularly the risk of accidental collective carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning caused by the use of combustion engine drainage pumps. We retrospectively reviewed all cases of acute accidental carbon monoxide exposure observed in the Ile-de-France region, related to the use of drainage pumps in spring and summer 2016 and notified to the Ile-de-France CO poisoning surveillance network. Five events were identified, including 45 people exposed to carbon monoxide. Thirty-four of these people were poisoned, 5 were not poisoned and insufficient data were available for 6 people. Three people showed signs of severity and 2 were treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The other poisoned individuals were managed in hospital and treated by oxygen therapy. All were cured. Collective CO poisonings are common sanitary events during flooding and can be potentially severe. They can occur during the event or over the following days. Preventive measures may help to reduce the risk of CO poisoning, such as increased awareness among professionals, better information of individuals who rent these types of devices or even the use of CO detectors during their use.\n\n[Hypospadia and infertility of Henry II of France (1519-1559)].\n\nPubMed\n\nHatzinger, M; Al-Shajlawi, S; Sohn, M\n\n2014-03-01\n\nHenry II (1519-1559) of France was the second son of Francis I (1494-1547) and Claude de France (1498-1524) born in 1519 in St. Germain-en-Laye. After his older brother's and his father's death in 1547, he was anointed the French king in Reims. In 1533 already, as a 14-year-old boy, for reasons of state, he was married to the same aged Catherine de Medici (1519-1589), as her uncle was Pope Clement VII (1478-1534). The marriage remained childless for 11 years since Henry, due to a distinct hypospadia and a completely sexually inexperienced wife was unable to conceive children with her. His existing liaison to Diane de Poitiers (1499-1566) - a 19-year-older maid of honor of his father Francis I from 1537 until his death - influenced his sexual life immensely.The blame for the childless marriage was placed primarily on his wife, as Henry had become father of an illegitimate daughter with a mistress. Catherine then underwent all possible medical and alchemical procedures to finally give birth to the hoped Dauphin. Ironically, her rival for the favor of her husband, Diane de Poitiers was one of her greatest allies. She made clear that the cause lay with Henry and not with his wife. This was confirmed by the added solid physician Jean Fernel (1497-1558). His treatment of Henry and the simultaneous training of the unexperienced Catherine by Diane de Poitiers led to success.The result was the birth of Francis II (1544-1560) in 1544, the first of 10 children in 12 years. Thus, the dynasty was saved. After the death of Henry in a tragic tournament accident in 1559, three of his sons became kings of France. But the line of Valois remained without further descendants and was continued by Henry IV, the first Bourbon king in 1589.\n\nFrequency Dependence and Spatial Distribution of Seismic Attenuation in France: Experimental Results and Possible Interpretations\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1989-09-12\n\nand possible interpretations.

With its global coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution, satellite remote sensing can contribute to monitoring of such events through the development of appropriate techniques. This paper presents an extensive validation in the south of France of a hail detection tool (HDT) developed for the Middle Ebro Valley (MEV). The HDT is based on consecutive application of two filters, a convection mask (CM) and hail mask (HM), using spectral channels of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite. The south of France is an ideal area for studying hailstorms, because there is a robust database of hail falls recorded by an extensive network of hailpads managed by the Association Nationale d'Etude et de Lutte contre les FleÃ¡ux AtmosphÃ©riques (ANELFA). The results show noticeably poorer performance of the HDT in France relative to that in the MEV, with probability of detection (POD) 60.4% and false alarm rate (FAR) 26.6%. For this reason, a new tool to suit the characteristics of hailstorms in France has been developed. The France Hail Detection Tool (FHDT) was developed using logistic regression from channels of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor of the MSG. The FHDT was validated, resulting in POD 69.3% and FAR 15.4%, thus improving hail detection in the study area as compared with the previous tool. The new tool was tested in a case study with satisfactory results, supporting its future practical application.\n\nPetroliferous wastewaters treatment with water hyacinths (Raffinerie de Provence, France): Experimental statement\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCasabianca, M.L. de; Laugier, T.; Posada, F.\n\n1995-12-31\n\nThe production and purification abilities of the water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms., were tested on petrochemical wastewaters at Raffinerie de Provence, Total (La Mede, France), in controlled and in situ experiments.

In France, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been estimated from cohorts to be about 1-3 per 1000 inhabitants, but exhaustive data are scarce for the general population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of PD in the Hauts-de-France region and to assess PD-related healthcare consumption. A descriptive study was conducted to identify the parkinsonian population in the Hauts-de-France region (including the administrative districts of Pas-de-Calais and Picardie) for the year 2014. Parkinsonian patients were identified from health insurance fund reimbursement data using the following criteria: (i) reimbursement for a PD-specific medication; (ii) attribution of long-duration disease status coded as PD; (iii) hospital stay with PD diagnosis in the standard discharge report contained in the French medico-economic database on hospital activity (PMSI). The raw prevalence of PD in the region was 5.03 per 1000 inhabitants aged 20 years and older. The standardized prevalence by health territory ranged from 4.0 to 9.0 per 1000 inhabitants aged 20 years and older. During the 1-year study period, 33.5% of patients had a neurology consultation, 57.1% attended a physiotherapy session, and 7.7% received speech therapy. Most of patients (79.6%) were treated with levodopa, sometimes in combination with a catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor (14.4%). Dopaminergic agonists were prescribed in 33.5% of cases. A neuroleptic was prescribed for 6.9% of the population (clozapine for 25.9%). The prevalence of PD is high in the Hauts-de-France region with a heterogeneous distribution by health territory. Neurology consultations were attended by a minority of patients in 2014.

We analyzed a sample of 1684 individuals from Western France, who were genotyped at genome-wide level, from two cohorts D.E.S.I.R and CavsGen. We found that fine-scale population structure occurs at the scale of Western France, with distinct admixture proportions for individuals originating from the Brittany Region and the VendÃ©e Department. Genetic differentiation increases with distance at a high rate in these two parts of Northwestern France and linkage disequilibrium is higher in Brittany suggesting a lower effective population size. When looking for genomic regions informative about Breton origin, we found two prominent associated regions that include the lactase region and the HLA complex. For both the lactase and the HLA regions, there is a low differentiation between Bretons and Irish, and this is also found at the genome-wide level. At a more refined scale, and within the Pays de la Loire Region, we also found evidence of fine-scale population structure, although principal component analysis showed that individuals from different departments cannot be confidently discriminated. Because of the evidence for fine-scale genetic structure in Western France, we anticipate that rare and geographically localized variants will be identified in future full-sequence analyses.\n\nSterol Alkyl Ethers in Immature Callovian (Middle Jurassic) Sediments of Pas de Calais and Normandy (France): Environmental Constraints on their Potential Origins.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKenig, F. P. H.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nSteryl alkyl ethers (SAEs), steroids with C8-C12 alkyl ether substituent at C3have only been reported in a limited number of studies since their first identification in modern diatomaceous ooze (Boon and de Leeuw, 1979 Mar. Chem. 7, 117-132). These compounds were identified in Holocene to Eocene sediments, but only once in the Cretaceous, in the Valanginian sediments of Shasky Rise (Brassell, 2009; Palaeo Palaeo Palaeo 282, 45-57). The origin of these compounds remains unclear, though they have been proposed to be associated with diatoms and biologically productive environments and cold water. Here we report the occurrence of SAEs in Callovian (Middle Jurassic), thermally immature sediments of the Marnes d'Argences near Caen (Normandy, France) and near Le Wast (Pas de Calais, France), extanding their geological occurrence by 28 million years. These marls contain C36 to C41 SAEs with C9 or C10 alkyl moieties. The steroid moieties (C27 to C31) are saturated, unsaturated (at C5 or C22), or di-unsaturated (at C5 and C22). Some of the samples collected near Le Wast contain only 4-methyl substituted C27, C28 and C29 steroid moieties as well as steroid moieties typical of dinoflagellates such 4,23,24-trimethylsteroids saturated and unsaturated at C22, and diatoms such as 4-desmethyl-23,24-dimethyl-steroid. The origin of SAEs will be discussed in view of their novel identification in Jurassic sediments and considering the environment of deposition of the Marnes d'Argences and comparison with their stratigraphic equivalent in England (Oxford Clay) and Eastern France where none of these compounds were observed.\n\n[France, an attractive country for international clinical research: 2010 survey assessed by Leem (French association of pharmaceutical companies)].\n\nPubMed\n\nLassale, Catherine; Sibenaler, Claire; Behier, Jehan-Michel; Pletan, Yannick; Courcier, Soizic\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn order to evaluate the attractiveness of France for conducting international clinical trials, a survey is performed every two years among pharmaceutical companies that are based in France or have affiliates in France.

Fondees par vagues successives a partir de 1945, les cooperatives rurales d'electricite ont ete actives dans plusieurs regions du Quebec et elles ont electrifie une partie significative des zones rurales. Afin de comprendre le contexte de la creation des cooperatives d'electricite, notre these debute (premiere partie) par une analyse du climat sociopolitique des annees precedant la naissance du systeme cooperatif d'electrification rurale. Nous y voyons de quelle facon l'electrification rurale devient progressivement, a partir de la fin des annees 1920, une question d'actualite a laquelle les divers gouvernements qui se succedent tentent de trouver une solution, sans engager---ou si peu---les fonds de l'Etat. En ce sens, la premiere etatisation et la mise sur pied d'Hydro-Quebec, en 1944, marquent une rupture quant au mode d'action privilegie jusque-la. La nouvelle societe d'Etat se voit cependant retirer son mandat d'electrifier le monde rural un an apres sa fondation, car le gouvernement Duplessis, de retour au pouvoir, prefere mettre en place son propre modele d'electrification rurale. Ce systeme repose sur des cooperatives d'electricite, soutenues par un organisme public, l'Office de l'electrification rurale (OER). L'OER suscite de grandes attentes de la part des ruraux et c'est par centaines qu'ils se manifestent. Cet engouement pour les cooperatives complique la tache de l'OER, qui doit superviser de nouvelles societes tout en assurant sa propre organisation. Malgre des hesitations et quelques delais introduits par un manque de connaissances techniques et de personnel qualifie, les commissaires de l'OER se revelent perspicaces et parviennent a mettre sur pied un systeme cooperatif d'electrification rurale qui produit des resultats rapides.

[France's economy adjusts to a declining birth rate].\n\nPubMed\n\nInserra, P\n\n1984-09-01\n\nThis discussion of France focuses on regions and cities, age distribution, households and families, housing, labor force, consumption, education, and communications. France counted 54,334,871 citizens as of March 4, 1982. There were 250,000 more people than in 1975, yielding a 7-year growth rate of 3.3%. If present trends continue, there will be 56 million French by the end of the 1980s. Since 1975 when the last census was conducted, cities of more than 200,000 lost an average of 5% of their residents. For the 1st time in more than a century, urban areas of 20,000 or more did not gain population but merely held their own. France continues to experience the effects of the large-scale decimation of its male population during the 2 world wars. The World war i loss showed up March 1982 as a relatively smaller 60-74 group. Conversely the population aged 75 and over is growing, both in absolute numbers and as a percent of the population. There were 3.6 million aged 75 and over (6.6% of the population) in 1982 compared with 3 million (5.6%) in 1975. The 19 and under age group declined between 1975-85, from 31% (16.2 million) to 29% (15.6 million). The 20-59 year old group constitutes the largest segment of the population--about double the group aged 19 and under--and its growing. This group was 50% of the population in 1973 and 53% in 1982. The infant mortality rate has declined steadily in France, from 18.2 deaths/1000 births in 1970 to 13.6 in 1975 and 9.5 at present. The total fertility rate has continued to decline: 1.8 children/woman in the 1982 census a rate less than the number needed to replace the present French population. Between 1975-82 households grew 10.4% to a total of 19.6 million. The growth in the number of households is attributed to the increase in divorce and the tendency for French children to leave the parental home at an earlier age. France has nearly 23 million dwelling places. More than half of householders own their own homes.

Indeed, French participation does not match either its scientific importance or its financial investment. While France contributed 16.5 to 17% of the EU's 7th Framework Programme research budget, its return through the funding of coordinated projects in which French teams are participating stands at around 12.5 to 13%, a shortfall of 600 million euros. Although the situation depends on the type of activity, French participation in clinical research appears to be smaller than that of its neighbours, with fewer responses to European calls for proposals. While France has many assets, which include the assured funding of clinical research, structured thematic networks and the initiation of major national programmes, it suffers from the dilution of resources due to France's regional development policy, the lack of multidisciplinarity and the ignorance of both the medical and scientific community and the institutions to which they belong as to how Horizon 2020 actually works. We propose three types of strategy to encourage proposals for coordinated clinical research projects or projects involving French teams, and to help in the drawing up of applications: Broaden the vision of our children, students and colleagues, helping them to adapt to the globalisation of knowledge throughout their educational and professional lives. Recognise the value of European actions to influence the European landscape and change mentalities. Help and support project initiators by pooling skills within a limited number of expert centres designed to assist them in their funding application. â¢ Broaden the vision of our children, students and colleagues, helping them to adapt to the globalisation of knowledge throughout their educational and professional lives\n\n[Attractiveness of France for international clinical research: 8th survey conducted by Leem (French association for pharmaceutical companies)].\n\nPubMed\n\nGalaup, Ariane; BarthÃ©lÃ©my, Philippe; Pouletty-Lefebvre, Brigitte; BÃ©hier, Jehan-Michel; Zetlaoui, Jean; Borel, Thomas\n\n2018-04-18\n\nTheÂ Leem (French association of pharmaceutical companies)Â hasÂ conducted the eighth survey on attractiveness of France for clinical research. It serves to measure France's global competitiveness for international clinical trials and assess its strengths and areas of excellence. It also highlights the potential for progress and emerging trends at a time when the regulatory environment in France and Europe is undergoing change. This survey has been updated every two years since 2002 using the same methodology. It assesses the current status of research undertaken in France by the pharmaceutical industry between January 1st 2014 and December 31st 2015. Thirty companies (62% of the French market) have participated in this 8thÂ survey which involved 3474 centers (versus 2860 in 2014) and 16,622 patients (versus 14,634 in 2014) enrolled in France across 586 clinical trials (versus 613 in 2014). This survey shows a reduction in the number of phase I and phase II trials. It also confirms that the studies conducted in France are primarily concerned with oncology (45%). Despite improvements across hospital contracts times (due to the adoption of the sole agreement) and performance indicators in trials (such as the number of patients enrolled by center), trial setup times in France are still overly lengthy (with stable times by French authorities). Ensuring that clinical research remains a priority issue for country is crucial for patients because of rapid access to innovation but also for the vitality of the French economy. Constructive dialogue with stakeholders on the subject of clinical research is essential to enhance the attractiveness of France and to improve the continuum between research, innovation and care.

Regarding system organisation: procedures for triage, designation and certification of trauma centres are mandatory to implement trauma networks on a national scale. Data collection with registries must be created, with a core dataset defined and applied through all registries. Regarding surgical and radiology training, diagnostic-imaging processes should be standardised and the role of the interventional radiologist within the trauma team and the trauma network should be clearly defined. Education in surgery for trauma is crucial and recent changes in medical training in France will promote trauma surgery as a specific sub-specialty. Innovative training techniques should be implemented and be based on common objectives, scenarios and evaluation, so as to improve individual and team performances. The group formulated 14 proposals that should help to structure and improve major trauma management in France over the next 10 years.

The center of Hurricane Frances made landfall on the east coast of Florida on September 5 as a category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, then moved west-northwestward through central Florida before exiting Pasco County into the Gulf of Mexico on September 6 (fig. 1; National Weather Service, 2004). The hurricane moved across the Florida Peninsula generating 5 to 11 inches of rain over already saturated ground (table 1). Record flooding occurred in parts of Hardee, Hillsborough, Pasco, and Polk Counties (fig. 1). The hurricane and resulting floods caused an estimated $4-5 billion in damage to public and private property (Harrington, 2004), and 23 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Frances (National Weather Service, 2004). Several watersheds drain counties in southwest-central Florida that were affected by Hurricane Frances. De Soto, Hardee, and Polk Counties generally are drained by the Peace River system, which flows southwestward to Charlotte Harbor and the Gulf of Mexico. Hillsborough and Pasco Counties generally are drained by the Alafia, Hillsborough, Anclote, and Pithlachascotee River systems. Water in the Hillsborough and Alafia River watersheds flows west to Tampa Bay and water in the Anclote and Pithlachascotee River watersheds flows west to the Gulf of Mexico.

The pronounced maxillary incisor beveling of Aubesier 4 helps to extend the antiquity of nondietary use of the anterior dentition. The interproximal \"toothpick\" groove on the Aubesier 10 molar increases the sample for these lesions. The pathological loss of the mandibular dentition of Aubesier 11 indicates advanced antemortem masticatory impairment, at a level previously undocumented before the Late Pleistocene. These remains support a view of later Middle Pleistocene humans able to support debilitated individuals despite the considerable use of their bodies to accomplish routine activities.\n\n4TH International Topical Conference on High-Power Electron and Ion-Beam Research and Technology, held in Palaiseau, France, 29 June - 3 July 1981.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1981-10-09\n\nN.

SI-EPI was developed by the epidemiologists of the Occupational Health Department (180 physicians), and of the SÃ©curitÃ© Sociale Department (120 physicians). Several data bases constitute SI-EPI. The population data base contains demographic, socioeconomic and professional data about each worker. The health data base is an exhaustive register of sick leave, accidents, permanent disabilities, compensated diseases, causes of death and cancer incidence among active workers. The Occupational Exposure and Working Conditions data base includes the MATEX job-exposure matrix (30 potentially carcinogenic agents) and FINDEX files which record data obtained from the systematic individual surveillance of workers. The GAZEL cohort data base concerns a sample of more than 20,000 volunteer workers, followed since 1989; in addition to data from the data bases, it contains information collected from other different sources, including self-questionnaires. Numerous epidemiological studies based on SI-EPI data have been conducted by in-house epidemiologists as well as by external research groups.

To become a certified anesthesiologist and an intensive care physician currently requires six years' medical education, passing national medical examination, and five years' special training as an intern of anesthesiology and intensive care. This educational course was started in 1984. There are 7942 certified anesthesiologists in France in 1999. The average age is 45.9 years and the ratio of female is 35.3%. Approximately two thirds of certified anesthesiologists are working in public institutions. 89% is full-time workers. More than half of certified anesthesiologists actually participate in daily intensive care practice. The number of certified anesthesiologists has been increasing gradually totaling 10,062 persons in 2005. The number of certified anesthesiologists per ten thousands general population is 1.7 persons and the corresponding ratio to all medical doctors is 4.8%. Working hours and holidays are regulated by the French Labour Law. The anaesthesiologist often works in a team with a nurse anaesthetist. The number of certified anesthesiologists in France is larger than that in Japan. Management of anesthesia in France seems to have an advantage in manpower.\n\nEntre Reproduction et Mobilisation: les Rapports de Genre EN Formation Continue EN France et AU Canada\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFourner, Christine; BÃ©ret, Pierre; Doray, Pierre; BÃ©langer, Paul\n\n2009-01-01\n\nREPRODUCTION OR MOBILISATION? GENDER PROPORTIONS IN CONTINUING EDUCATION IN FRANCE AND CANADA - Initial education provisions for women have evolved greatly over the past 40 years. But what about their situation within adult education and training? This article, comparing Canada and France, shows that, while it is well known that more women than men participate in adult education, their greater presence in professional training courses is a new development. The analysis highlights certain particular findings, such as the growing demand for continuing education in Canada and the increased rate of participation by full-time employees in France. In both countries, a number of social factors continue to influence women's participation.\n\nThe \"cradle of glass\": incubators for infants in late nineteenth-century France.\n\nPubMed\n\nGreene, Gina\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis article examines the development of the incubator for premature infants in fin-de-siÃ¨cle France. During a period of widespread anxiety in France regarding infant mortality and its implications for population growth, physicians in Paris developed and widely promoted the lifesaving technology. This article explores the ways in which the incubator reflected new scientific and symbolic approaches to creating hygienic spaces as well as how it reflected new scientific and symbolic approaches to the traditionally feminine project of infant care. By creating such an isolating and protective milieu around premature infantsâan entirely new population of patientsâthe incubator, I argue, heralded a renegotiation of the boundary between motherhood and medical authority.\n\nIonising radiation and risk of death from leukaemia and lymphoma in radiation-monitored workers (INWORKS): an international cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeuraud, Klervi; Richardson, David B; Cardis, Elisabeth; Daniels, Robert D; Gillies, Michael; O'Hagan, Jacqueline A; Hamra, Ghassan B; Haylock, Richard; Laurier, Dominique; Moissonnier, Monika; Schubauer-Berigan, Mary K; Thierry-Chef, Isabelle; Kesminiene, Ausrele\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThere is much uncertainty about the risks of leukaemia and lymphoma after repeated or protracted low-dose radiation exposure typical of occupational, environmental, and diagnostic medical settings. We quantified associations between protracted low-dose radiation exposures and leukaemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma mortality among radiation-monitored adults employed in France, the UK, and the USA. We assembled a cohort of 308,297 radiation-monitored workers employed for at least 1 year by the Atomic Energy Commission, AREVA Nuclear Cycle, or the National Electricity Company in France, the Departments of Energy and Defence in the USA, and nuclear industry employers included in the National Registry for Radiation Workers in the UK. The cohort was followed up for a total of 8.22 million person-years. We ascertained deaths caused by leukaemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. We used Poisson regression to quantify associations between estimated red bone marrow absorbed dose and leukaemia and lymphoma mortality. Doses were accrued at very low rates (mean 1.1 mGy per year, SD 2.6). The excess relative risk of leukaemia mortality (excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) was 2.96 per Gy (90% CI 1.17-5.21; lagged 2 years), most notably because of an association between radiation dose and mortality from chronic myeloid leukaemia (excess relative risk per Gy 10.45, 90% CI 4.48-19.65). This study provides strong evidence of positive associations between protracted low-dose radiation exposure and leukaemia.

Their creation has been associated with several advances in access to psychiatric care for inmates in recent years. However, there is still only one means of involuntary hospitalization for prisoners in France: care by decision of a representative of the state (les soins sur dÃ©cision d'un reprÃ©sentant de l'Ã©tat [SDRE]). Interestingly, for SDRE to be recognized as legal by the French judge, the patient must be \"a danger to himself or to the others\". Thus, there is a major difference with involuntary hospitalization outside the prison, and there are specific criteria for involuntary psychiatric hospitalization for inmates in France. This situation questions the general framework of involuntary psychiatric care and is very inconsistent with French law. Indeed, the goal of the loi n o Â 94-43 du 18 janvier 1"
