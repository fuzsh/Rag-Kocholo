I came to the University of Arizona to pursue my master's in mechanical engineering, which I completed in 2010. Throughout my master's education I was increasingly drawn towards applying the mechanical engineering concepts to biological applications, and this culminated in my pursuing a Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering from the University of Iowa, where I researched novel methodologies to model blood cells at the micro-scale. I spent a year in Portland,OR at the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) researching hemodynamics in cardiac development, before moving to the UW. I am currently involved in determining the influence of hemodynamics on efficacy of heart failure therapies, and am also working on investigating blood flow in intracranial aneurysms. Outside of the lab, I love going on hikes, long drives, cooking (and eating good food!), painting, reading, and having philosophical discussions.\n\nRead more »\n\nCraig Hill\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher\n\nCraig joined UW and the lab in December 2015.

His research interests involve energy and fluid. Currently he is working on numerical simulation of tidal turbines, which convert the raw energy of tides (driven by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon on the oceans of the earth) to useful energy (mechanical power and electricity). He uses commercial software packages, such as FLUENT and Star CCM+, for doing a comprehensive numerical simulation of the flow behavior around the tidal turbine blades.\n\nTeymour did his undergraduate in the Sharif-Aachen (SUT-AcUAS) cooperation program in Mechanical Engineering. He studied for three years at Sharif University in Iran and then completed his bachelor thesis at Aachen University of Applied Science in Germany with emphasis on understanding and measuring reflectance and transmission degree of solar panel surfaces. He continued his education in the Master of Science program at Aachen University of Technology (RWTH-Aachen) in Germany.

He joined the University of Washington to do a PhD in fluid mechanics that Fall. His research is focused on understanding the hemodynamics of blood flowing in intracranial aneurysms, and in particular, he performs numerical computations on virtual models of patient blood vessels inside the skull (on or around the Circle of Willis) to develop a predictive algorithm that determines the success of endovascular treatment for intracranial saccular aneurysms: coiling and/or stenting. He works within a multidisciplinary collaboration between fluid mechanicians and neurosurgeons that apply state of the art fluid mechanics experiments, computational simulations and in vivo imaging (CT rotational angiography and intravascular Doppler ultrasound) to tackle this problem that has puzzled biomechanics and medical experts for several decades. This effort is funded by NIH (NINDS 5R01 HL115267) and has been published in multiple manuscripts ([1], [2], [3]\n\nAlicia Clark\n\nResearch Assistant\n\nAlicia graduated from the Lafayette College with a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2006.
