        "text": "Post by mygos on\n\nI first met Jean-Louis in a nature exhibition in Le Blanc (36 Indre, France) some 15 years ago ! I was immediatly fascinated by his hyper realistic paintings of insects, mainly beetles, and we start discussing for a while. I went to several of his exhibitions and we became friends. I bought some original and reproductions from him, as well as the Cymothoe oemilius painting he made for me that you can see in the post on \"Butterflies paintings by wellknown artists\".\n\nI visited his studio to observe how he practice its art : always with real specimens under a binocular microscope ...\n\noriginal in my collection\n\nenlargment from above\n\ndetails of Macrodontia cervicornis elytras\n\nFirst original I bought from the artist\n\nLimited number reproduction in my collection\n\ndeatails from above\n\nunpublished \"Etude\" he offered me ...\n\nA+, Michel\n\nP.S. : Sorry for the bad quality of pictures, but difficult as these paintings are framed, and luminosity is not good at this season here in France"
