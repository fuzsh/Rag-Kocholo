        "text": "Throwback to our France-Japan Evolutionary Social Sciences workshop in June at Tokyo University! It's always a pleasure to connect two countries through a shared field of research, exchange ideas, and bring people together over a common interest. I’m very grateful to have maintained a strong connection with Japan over the past 10 years, ever since my time as an exchange student at Keio University and hope I will be able to do so in the future. Thanks to Université Paris Dauphine- PSL, Université de Tokyo and CNRS - Centre national de la recherche scientifique for funding and hosting the event. Nicolas Baumard, Coralie Chevallier\n\nI had a wonderful time at Cambridge Judge Entrepreneurship Centre attending the intensive Ignite program. It was great to showcase Bunka.ai to a panel of specialists and to join the great Cambridge ecosystem. Thank Ann Davidson, Sayara Thompson and the ignite team for organizing this week. Thanks to Thibauld Enfroy and the team at PSL for the opportunity along with the p2i Network for their support.\n\nNew preprint on how Visual Topic Modeling and Frame Analysis can be used to better understand your data. Most Data Scientists do not know exactly the content of the textual data they train AI with because it is simply impossible for an individual to read millions of texts. It is a big issue because those AI will make decisions in the future based on those data. Visual Topic Modeling and Frame Analysis are great tools to increase the transparency of your dataset because they help your brain make sense of the distribution of your information and then make the necessary adjustments to refine fine-tuning datasets. Link to the preprint: https://lnkd.in/eBXhFKvS\n\nI almost missed it, but I'm super happy to see our BunkaTopics package included as one of the four tools for analyzing AI datasets before training and fine-tuning on (again) Maxime Labonne's goat repository about training datasets. It's nice to be mentioned alongside tools from big names in the AI industry such as Hugging Face, Nomic AI and Databricks, given how small we still are. Congrats to the Bunka Team\n\nWhen you train models or teach the model something about the world, you should ensure that the information you input follows some principles. Maxime Labonne gathered a great list of datasets and emphasizes what a high-quality dataset should be: - Accuracy: the content of the dataset should be relevant. - Diversity: the range of topics should be wide enough. - Complexity: the datasets should be formatted in different ways that are representative of the task at hand. Personally, I would merge Accuracy and Complexity into \"Relevance\" because sometimes you would like a dataset with many \"mistakes\" if you want your model to learn from those mistakes. I would also add the concept of \"Transparency\", meaning that datasets should be auditable by individuals, and \"Representativeness\" because sometimes diversity is not enough; you want some concepts to appear more clearly. Finally, he argues that datasets can be clustered to account for diversity, which I couldn't agree more with and it lies at the basis of what we do at Bunka.ai. Sources: https://lnkd.in/eg-FvTuZ"
