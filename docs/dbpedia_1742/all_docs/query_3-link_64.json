        "text": "In France, kids start school very early : school starts at age 2 (for 52% of children) or 3 (it is mandatory at 3) and children spend 2 or 3 years in maternelle (kindergarten). School is compulsory until age 16. In primary schools, French kids spend more hours a year (almost 900, like Italy and the Netherlands) than other European countries (less than 700 for Austria, Germany and Finland) : in France, less days of school (vacations are a national value) and more hours per day. (see detailed figures) Contrary to a frequent American stereotype, learning by rote does not exist or hardly (it was true in the 19th century). Read about parenting in France.\n\nAll professors in public schools and universities are employed and paid by the state. The Ministry of Education is, by far, the largest employer in France and (it is said) the second in the world (after the Red Army!) with more than one million employees. Writes Nadeau : \" An outstanding feature of French education is the authority of teachers. The French don't regard childhood as an age of innocence but see it as an age of ignorance. Children must be set straight and corrected.\"\n\nMost schools are public (85%) but there are also private schools throughout France (particularly in the very religious regions of Western and Eastern France). Separation of church and state was decreed in 1905 but Catholic schools continue to coexist alongside public ones - and get state funding for teachers salaries, social security costs, and scholarships. 13.4 % of elementary school children and 20% of high school pupils attend private schools. See French schools abroad and the comparison with other European countries.\n\nHigh school : see the (new) program of French high schools and note that there are few options and few extra-curicular activities. The final exam, the \"Baccalauréat\" or \"Bac\" is very important for French students because it gives them access to university studies, with no further selection. It is a rigorous exam with no multiple choice questions : it includes a written part and an oral part, with several subjects each. It lasts up to six days. Less than 20 per cent of those who take it fail (and now many people think it's too easy) and it does not mean anything except it gives access to the university, even for people whose level and motivation are too low. Every year, the \"bac\" is one of the major events of the month of June and newspapers publish and discuss the subjects in Philosophy and Literature. The French love it and refuse to change it. More in Paris Diary. Due to Covid, the bac was practically purely symbolic in 2020 and 2021 (most subjects cancelled, success rate >90%) and there is hope that this archaic ritual will disappear in the near future.\n\nFrance has a dual system for higher education : \"Universités\" and \"Grandes Ecoles\"; the latter (less than 5% of students) requires very competitive selection entry exams. Click to understand the \"Grandes Ecoles\" system, which concerns mostly science and business studies. For medical and law studies, there are no Grandes Ecoles but universities have developed selection systems in the course of the studies.\n\nEducation is almost free at all levels (zero from kindergarden to high school, tuition around $400 a year at Sorbonne : read below) except for private schools and business schools. 26% of university students receive scholarships. But it is a fact that French Universities do not offer as many services and facilities as American universities and from this standpoint, only Grandes Ecoles compare to the US system (an there, tuition represents a few thousand $). Compared to the US, student loans are rather unfrequent in France (see numbers).\n\nThe grading system goes from 0 to 20 with 20 being perfect. The grading system is extremely tough. Hardly anyone ever gets a 20 or even an 18 or 19. Teachers read the grades out loud when they hand back homework and tests. School is hard on French children : read in Baudry or in French Toast how it can impact the entire personality of the French. An important thing to know : in France, the grade you get is not aimed at stimulating you to improve but to punish you so you react and get better. This is why sometimes American universities are surprised when the best French student (from the Grandes Ecoles) apply when their grades in math are around 7 or 9 (a C- in France) and, when admitted, get an A+ in the USA!\n\nAfter High School, some students (among the best) apply to be admitted to a \"Classe Préparatoire\": these classes (located in some High Schools) prepare students (in two or three years) for a very competitive admission test to Ecoles d'Ingénieurs (Sciences), to Business Schools or to a few other kinds of schools. In these classes, students work like dogs (40 hours courses a week + constant tests + personal work, no week-end, etc..) to be admitted to the best possible school. Actually, they work twice more than college students (see numbers). Contrary to what the NYT wrote,most of these preparatory classes are free (read more.) and students enjoy very good working conditions. Writes Nadeau : ...\"French parents don't want to send their children to university. We could not believe this until we understood just what the Grandes Ecoles were. French parents do everything they can to make sure their child won't go to university but will go to a Grande Ecole....\"\n\nThe \"Grandes Ecoles\" are not part of the rest of the University system : they are smaller, they have much more money (they get 30% of the national university budget with only 4% of the students), they are kept apart from the rest of the educational system, they are based on fierce competition of the students among themselves and the schools between themselves. The most prestigious schools give access to the new French nobility : the \"Grands Corps\". Their graduates will always be the boss !\n\n\"Grandes écoles\" are close to the labor market and, contrary to the universities, their graduates have little (if any) problem to find a job.\n\nThe tuition is almost nothing (except in Business Schools where it is around $8 to 10,000 /year). In some cases (Ecole Polytechnique, Ecole Nationale d'Administration, Ecole Normale Supérieure), the students are paid a salary (around Euro 2,000 a month). There are many Grandes Ecoles (around 250) but they are very small ; the largest (Polytechnique, HEC, Centrale, Arts et Métiers, INSA,..) have around one thousand students each. The number of students in the Grandes Ecoles represents only a few % (around 5%) of the total number of students.\n\nIn a nutshell : here is the comparative cursus in Universities and Grandes Ecoles :\n\nSchools do not sponsor extra-curricular activities, or hardly any. The only thing that goes on at school is....schoolwork. This is a major difference with the US system. French universities have much less money than US universities and therefore offer much less activities to the students.\n\nAll French students study Philosophy in their last year of high school. France is one of the few European countries (with Spain, Italy and Portugal) which requires this. Questions for a 4-hour dissertation in 2003 : \"Is dialog the path to truth ?\", \"Why are we sensitive to beauty?\", \"Is happiness a private matter?\". Paris has many cafés where people discuss philosophical topics, with the help of a moderator.\n\nMath is the yardstick by which performance is measured. Even though a student may be of a literary bent, he or she will probably choose the \"Bac S\" (the math \"bac\") because it is seen as the best. The good side of it is that a quite high proportion of great mathematicians are French (10 Fields Medal winners out of 44) and math is still one of the domains where France can challenge the USA ! However, things have changed dramatically in the past 20 years or so and the level of math of French students has decreased significantly at all levels. Why ? Read a tentative explanation .\n\nFrench high school teachers are not in school all day long. They come to give their courses and then leave. They do not have office hours. In French schools it is common for teachers to tell children they are nuls (zeroes). This may become a thing of the past as the French come to grips with the problem of battered and abused children. Some psychologists and children's defenders are now making the link between negative treatment at school and child development.\n\nThe \" collège unique \" is an excellent example of France's rather dogmatic policies (in France, \" collège \" is junior high school) : in the 1970s, it was decided (Loi Haby) that all children in French high schools should be in the same classes whatever their respective level : you cannot have classes composed solely of children with learning problems, or immigrant children just arrived from their country, or particularly intelligent students, etc.. All classes must be mixed. The reason : priority to equality. The consequence : serious problems with classes, particularly in neighborhoods where the number of immigrants is high and their knowledge of French insufficient. In spite or because of the wish for equality, this law results in inequality. This is re-inforced by the \"carte scolaire\" : until an minor attenuation to the rule by N.Sarkozy, you must send your children to a school in the zone where you live. Thousands of parents do everything they can to escape this regulation (including renting a phony residence next to a better school).\n\nIn France, most schools are given the name of an illustrious personality. The decision is made by the local authorities on a proposal made by the teaching staff. It is interesting to see the names of the people the French think represent best their educational system. The most popular, with hundred of schools named after them, are Jules Ferry, Jacques Prévert, Jean Jaures, Jean Moulin, Jean de La Fontaine, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Jean Monnet, Pierre et/ou Marie Curie. Click on the names for more details and here for statistics about the names of schools.\n\nFrance is practically run by people who graduated from two of the \"grandes Ã©coles\", X or ENA (sometimes both) :\n\nthe President of France, and generally the Prime Minister, most of the cabinet members, most CEO of major companies (more than 30 out of the 40 companies of CAC-40, the index of the Paris Stock Exchange).\n\nENA (Ecole Nationale d'Administration) was created after WW2 to\n\nA callous pun about ENA... (credit)\n\n(the joke is that ANE means \"ass\")\n\nensure a democratic recruitment of top ranking civil servants. As of today, it has become an aristocracy in itself. Around 100 students graduate every year. Read a few quotes about ENA.\n\nThe Grands Corps : at the end of the studies at X (Ecole Polytechnique), there is a ranking and the students choose an \"Ecole d'Application\" (the first ten or so : Ecole des Mines, the next fifteen of so : Ecole des Ponts & Chaussées, etc...) ; at the end of ENA, same thing : first ten or so : Inspection des Finances, then Conseil d'Etat, etc.... Then, for the rest of their carreer, the best students belong to one of these powerful \"Grands Corps\" (literally : great bodies) : Corps des Mines (X + Ecole des Mines), Inspection des Finances (ENA), Corps des Ponts (X + Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées), Cour des Comptes (ENA). A \"Corps\" is a sort of association, in charge of managing the career of its members, in competition with the other \"Corps\" (once you're in a \"Corps\", the rest of the world does not exist...). To understand France, it is essential to know that, in this country, the political and economic power is largely in the hands of the members of the \"grands corps\".\n\nIn some countries, the most prestigious positions go to lawyers, in others to scientists, historians or architects : in France, most of the leading positions are occupied by people with an engineering degree, very often civil servants or former civil servants, members of a \"Grand Corps\" ! Read about working with the French and politics and see the detailed figures in 2008.\n\nSome of the best French \"grandes écoles\" have been successfully duplicated in China : read more.\n\nMore to come\n\nStudents are neglected : financially speaking, the French system has privileged high schools versus universities : in 2000, the ratio of expenses per university student/high schools student is the lowest in developed countries :\n\nSweden : 2,4\n\nUSA : 2,3\n\nJapan : 1,7\n\nUK : 1,6 Germany : 1,6\n\nSpain : 1,3\n\nItaly : 1,1\n\nFrance : 1,1\n\nDecline of universities : more and more students (2,7 million in 2018) but more and more in the Grandes Ecoles and in the shorter education cursus ; the dual system cannot address the new issues, since the Grandes Ecoles are too small and too specialized and short cursus do not contribute enough to research\n\nA failure of the mass educational system : too many drop-outs and people who did not get any degree : every year 90,000 out of 750,000 ; as a result, the vision of the future of young French people is one of the most negative among advanced countries (see a comparative poll)\n\nA serious loss of prestige for French universities : in spite of their 12% of foreign students (rank 2 in Europe after UK) , the French universities no longer attract the best students from the whole world; the recent ranking made by the University of Shanghai of the 500 best universities of the world is awful for the French national pride (the best one ranks 65th) : the good teaching and research centers are too small, and the big universities are not good enough ;\n\nThe competition from US universities : more prestige, more research and more services attract the best students and give them a better preparation ; in the US, the student/teacher ratio is similar to France (around 9) but the student/(service and technical staff) ratio is 3, compared to 40 in France (!!) ;\n\nLack of money : the cost of a student at the Sorbonne is 33 times less than the cost of student at Princeton. As J.R.Pitte, the former president of the Sorbonne, jokingly emphasized, each student has an average of 2,6 sq. meters (24 sq. ft) when a \"poulet de Bresse\" (a high quality chicken, with the AOC label) demands 90 sq. ft. to keep the precious label !\n\nnot enough preparation for active life (except in \"Grandes Ecoles\")\n\nWith the criteria of the University of Shanghai, the ranking of French universities is very disappointing : only 4 in the first 100 universities in the world. Apart the true fact that the French educational system does need to be improved, some of the main reasons for this poor ranking are the critera of the ranking and some specificities of the French organization (see below).\n\nThe detailed ranking for French universities is : Paris VI, Paris XI, Strasbourg I, Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris, Collège de France, Grenoble I, Paris VII, Toulouse III, Montpellier II, Bordeaux I, Bordeaux II, Ecole Polytechnique, Lyon I, Paris V, Ecole Normale Supérieure Lyon, Aix-Marseille II, Ecole de Chimie Paris, Aix-Marseille I, Nancy I, Ecole des Mines Paris, Clermont-Ferrand, Nice.\n\nIn France, research organizations are OUTSIDE the university. As shown on this page, the French system must be improved but still this Shanghaï ranking is adapted to American-type universities. It favors the number of publications in English - speaking reviews and the number of Nobel prizes ; French universities are smaller and French-public research is largely done in public agencies (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique CNRS, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale INSERM, INRIA for computer science, etc..) which do not belong to French Universities although many labs are common. For instance, two of the three last French Nobel Prizes (Chauvin, Chemistry, 2005 and Fert, Physics, 2007) do their research at CNRS and will not contribute to improve the Shanghaï ranking of any university! See the detailed ranking of French research institutions : it must be improved but it is not as bad as the Shanghai ranking might suggest !\n\nThe only field in which a French university is the world leader is Mathematics (Paris-6 is #1 and Paris-11 is #13). Read why the French are good in maths.\n\nAccording to an American study (2016), the ranking of colleges and universities based on the number of Nobel prizes per 10,000 alumni shows a dominations of US institutions but a surprisingly good ranking of the best French Grandes Ecoles (Ecole Normale Superieure #1 and Ecole Polytechnique #6).
