        "text": "For the baseball player, see Mike Herrera (baseball).\n\nMichael Arthur Herrera (b. November 6, 1976) is an American musician most widely known as the vocalist and bass guitarist for the pop punk band MxPx, as well as being the front-man of his new band Tumbledown.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n\n2 Career\n\n2.1 MxPx\n\n2.2 Tumbledown\n\n2.3 Other music\n\n3 Personal life\n\n4 Discography\n\n4.1 Studio albums\n\n4.2 EPs\n\n4.3 Compilations\n\n4.4 Live albums\n\n4.5 As producer\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nEarly life\n\nHerrera was born in Bremerton, Washington to Art and Michele Herrera and is of Mexican descent.[1] He is the middle of three children and has an older sister and a younger sister. His parents still live in Bremerton in the house he grew up in.[2] Herrera started MxPx while he was in high school with friends Andy Husted and Yuri Ruley with the band's first performance in his back yard.\n\nCareer\n\nMxPx\n\nHerrera was the primary songwriter and vocalist as well as playing the bass guitar in the pop punk band MxPx.Herrera started the band with Andy Husted and Yuri Ruley in the summer of 1992, just before starting high school. In time it became clear that Andy was unable or unwilling to go on tours. Andy left the band and was replaced by Tom Wisniewski who (at the time) had little experience playing guitar and was more proficient on the drums.\n\nTumbledown\n\nHerrera recently created the band Mike Herrera's Tumbledown with guitarist Jack Parker, bassist Marshall Trotland, and drummer Harley Trotland. The band draws influences from being on tour as well as from \"great American songwriters\" such as Hank Williams, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash. The sound of Herrera's new project differs greatly from MxPx taking a lighter, more country inspired sound. He says “It's all about the songs. What it sounds like depends on who you are,” and “I don't claim that we're a country band... we're just a band...I just like the fact that it's a different sound,” Herrera says. “Different than a country band, different than a punk rock band, different than a rockabilly band -- we're somewhere there in the ether, somewhere in between it all.”\n\nOther music\n\nHe has produced albums such as \"At Any Rate\" by Too Bad Eugene and \"Future Plans Undecided\" by Element (101). He sang backing vocals on some of the songs as well as on others such as \"Radio #2\" from The Ataris album \"So Long, Astoria\" and \"Runaway\" by Amber Pacific, on their album Truth in Sincerity..\n\nHe has been in several side projects. They are:Tumbledown, Arthur (MxPx plus their former bass tech Neil), The Cootees (Mike Herrera, Jiles Brandon, Tom Wisniewski, and Dale Yob).\n\nHerrera opened his own music production studio, Monkey Trench, in Bremerton on July 1, 2008. Herrera avidly endorses Ernie Ball/Musicman Stingray basses and strings and has used them on every Mxpx recording. For amplification he uses an Hartke LH1000 head and a Hartke 8x10 cabinet. Herrera is also endorsed by Takamine Acoustic Guitars, Sparrow Guitars, Mesa Boogie Amps, Samson Tech and Latin Percussion.\n\nHerrera is also part of the MXPX All Stars with Kris Roe of The Ataris on guitar and Chris Wilson of The Summer Obsession on drums.\n\nHerrera also appeared in the video for A Day to Remember's single \"All I Want,\" alongside musicians such as Andrew W.K., Pierce the Veil, Trivium, and Pete Wentz and many more.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHerrera married his wife Holli in 2001. The two currently reside in Bremerton, Washington, with their cat and two dogs. Herrera not only plays bass but guitar and piano as well.\n\nHerrera is a Christian, along with the other members of Mxpx, although they prefer to not be called a Christian band.[3] On the topic of their faith Mike Herrera has been quoted saying \"We are Christian. It’s not a cult or something. It’s part of our story and I guess it’s different and controversial. But it’s a personal thing. It’s what we choose to believe. That’s all there is to it. We don’t preach to anyone.\" [4]\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nMxPx — Pokinatcha (1994), vocals and bass guitar on the entire album.\n\nMxPx — Teenage Politics (1995), vocals and bass guitar on the entire album.\n\nMxPx — Life In General (1996), vocals and bass guitar on the entire album.\n\nThe Cootees — Let's Play House (1997), lead vocals on 7 songs, background vocals and guitar on the entire album.\n\nMxPx — Slowly Going The Way Of The Buffalo (1998), vocals and bass guitar on the entire album.\n\nMxPx — The Ever Passing Moment (2000), vocals and bass guitar on the entire album.\n\nMxPx — Before Everything & After (2003), vocals and bass guitar on the entire album.\n\nMxPx — Panic (2005), vocals and bass guitar on the entire album.
