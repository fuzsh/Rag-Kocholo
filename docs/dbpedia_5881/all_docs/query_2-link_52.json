        "text": "NYC-based American Patchwork Quartet (APQ) is on a mission to reclaim the immigrant soul of American Roots Music. Grammy-winning vocalist Falu Shah, two-time Grammy-winning guitarist/vocalist Clay Ross, three-time Grammy-winning drummer Clarence Penn, and Grammy-nominated bassist Yasushi Nakamura showcase the dynamic diversity of contemporary culture by reimagining timeless songs from America’s past. APQ draws on a repertoire of centuries-old American folk songs that highlight America’s immigrant roots. They showcase America’s dynamic present by combining the diverse talents of four U.S. citizens, each with a unique cultural background. In this quartet, old songs are made new through creative arrangements that highlight the exceptional and well-honed skills of each band member.\n\nImage credit: Jack Randall\n\nBarron Ryan’s love for music has always been divided. The son of two musicians, he grew up in a house filled with the sounds of artists ranging from Mozart to Michael Jackson. So when it comes to his own work, he’s not content drawing on just one influence. He combines them all into a musical adventure that’s vintage yet fresh, historical yet hip, classic yet cool.\n\nBarron is following in his favorite composers’ footsteps by publishing his original works in the public domain. He offers his work as a gift to the world, and as a chance to collaborate with artists from around the globe.\n\nImage credit: Andrew Saliga\n\nBlato Zlato is a contemporary folk ensemble in the lineage of Eastern European traditional music, with particular focus on Bulgarian folk songs and Bulgarian language compositions. Their music embodies the evolution of folk music as it intersects with the immigrant experience of building a new life in America while retaining the cultural practices and traditions of the old world. Blato Zlato’s mission is to reconnect listeners with their Eastern European ancestry and heritage, as well as to spark exploration and curiosity of the music of the Balkans.\n\nImage credit: Sarrah Danziger\n\nLed by Ryan Keberle, Jazz Times’ 2020 Trombonist of the Year, Catharsis has been hailed by the LA Times for its “potent blend of cinematic sweep and lush, ear-grabbing melodies.” The highly-acclaimed group brings together elements of chamber music, South American folk, and indie rock within a traditional jazz framework, resulting in a sound that has thrilled audiences across the globe for close to a decade. In Catharsis, the potent frontline rapport of Keberle alongside vocalist/guitarist extraordinaire, Camila Meza, and the unshakable rhythm of bassist Jorge Roeder and drummer Eric Doob combine in a sound full of drama and intrigue.\n\nImage credit: Amanda Gentile\n\nDayton Contemporary Dance Company (DCDC) was founded in 1968 to create performance opportunities for dancers of color. Five decades later, the tenth largest modern contemporary dance company in the nation remains rooted in the African-American experience and committed to the development of diverse movement artists on the global stage. A co-recipient of one of the dance world’s highest honors, the 2016 Bessie Award for Outstanding Revival, DCDC has been presented by American Dance Festival, Paul Taylor American Modern Dance, and Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival, and supported by National Endowment for the Arts and New England Foundation for the Arts, among others.\n\nImage credit: Jeff Sabo\n\nDendê is a percussionist, singer, composer, bandleader, teacher, and multi-instrumentalist. He’s been a professional musician since the age of 14, when he appeared in the frontline of Timbalada, Carlinhos Brown’s superstar percussion ensemble. Since 2001, he’s been splitting his time between the US and Bahia, focusing his efforts on his own ensembles.\n\nHis flagship group, Dendê & Band reflects his deeply rooted traditional sensibility with his eclectic musical appetite where Afro-Brazilian traditions like samba de roda and Candomblé meld seamlessly with other global rhythms like rumba, afrobeat and mbalax.\n\nImage credit: Leslie Macedo\n\nEunbi Kim (pronounced OON-bee, like book) curates programs that compel audiences to meditate on the parts of themselves that are deeply buried. Creating performances expressing dreamlike “liquid elegance” (Times Union), her intimate performances draw from collaborations with composers, filmmakers, and theater directors to create experiences beyond the boundaries of the traditional piano recital format.\n\nKim’s recent album It Feels Like debuted at #2 on Billboard Classical Charts. It features world premiere recordings of works written for her by Daniel Bernard Roumain, Pauchi Sasaki, Angélica Negrón, and Sophia Jani. Drawing from the album and its themes, Kim created a four-night performance and conversation series, also titled It Feels Like as an artist-in-residence at WNYC’s The Greene Space.\n\nImage credit: Shervin Lainez\n\nFounded by Kahlil Cummings in 2017, Extra Ancestral is a cultural movement dedicated to educating and entertaining audiences through the fusion of different cultural manifestations of the African Diaspora. Audiences experience the group's unique application and blend of artistic genres such as Afrobeat, Reggae, Jazz, Salsa, and many traditional musical and dance forms of the African Diaspora. Narrated through powerful ancestral dancing, Extra Ancestral provides an in-depth education of temporal and geographic borders from Africa to the Americas and back, illustrating lessons from the past that hone tools for the future. Music and dance are the ensemble’s healing tools and are led by some of the Los Angeles area's most dynamic and culturally validated artists.\n\nImage credit: Farah Stop\n\nJaninah Burnett’s artistry is profoundly carving her place as a preeminent soprano of this generation. Most recently making appearances on Broadway as Carlotta Giudicelli in the iconic musical theater masterpiece, Phantom of the Opera, Ms. Burnett has performed on some of the world's most notable stages including the Metropolitan Opera.
