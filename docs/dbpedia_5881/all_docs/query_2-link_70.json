        "text": "Para leer en español: Una Introducción a la Música Urbana en 50 Canciones\n\nThe history of música urbana is one of perpetual reinvention. Long before the ultra-polished Bad Bunny and Drake collaborations, before Diplo crashed the baile funk party and made millions, these genres were defined by experimentation—by scrappy sampling techniques, by off-the-cuff freestyling, by the movement and displacement of Afro-diasporic sounds and their people. They were born in Latin America’s marginalized communities—in favelas, in caseríos, in working-class and black neighborhoods across the region and its diasporic sister cities of New York, Miami, and beyond. From Puerto Rican rapper Tego Calderón’s affirmations of Boricua blackness to the sex-positive gospel of funk carioca luminary Tati Quebra-Barraco, música urbana has always provided space for multiplicity—for pleasure, for protest, for romance. It is the soundtrack of struggle and joy.\n\nAs a catch-all term, música urbana encompasses a wide range of styles that continue to shift in unimaginable directions; what were once hyper-regional, underground sounds have become some of the most popular styles of music across Latin America and have devoted fans across the globe. That’s not to say urbano hasn’t faced its share of prejudice. Across all its styles, these scenes have sparked important conversations on racism and classism, igniting targeted suppression campaigns in Puerto Rico, censorship bans from governments in Colombia and the Dominican Republic, and beyond. Women have criticized urbano, denouncing their objectification in lyrics and videos. But not unlike other genres where misogyny has reared its head, women artists like Ivy Queen have challenged those narratives for decades—and are still fighting for change today.\n\nHere, to open a discussion on urbano, we will focus on six of the movement’s pillars: reggaeton, hip-hop en español, Latin trap, dembow, champeta urbana, and Brazilian funk (or baile funk, as it’s Anglicized in the U.S.). These genres represent thriving movements with profound histories and specialized sounds: reggaeton’s driving riddims, melodic refrains, and rapid-fire rhymes; Dominican dembow’s addictive, hyperspeed hooks; champeta urbana’s collision of hip-hop and Congolese and South African folk; hip-hop en español’s rap reimaginings for Spanish speakers; Latin trap’s gritty bravado; and baile funk’s irresistible remixing of Miami bass and hip-hop. We’ve curated a collection of tracks for each of these genres, ordered chronologically, in an attempt to show how the music has evolved over time. While these include chart-toppers and social milestones, our writers also wanted to document an alternate history of these movements—one that shines some light on its black, queer, feminist, and political origins and futures, in the hopes of highlighting some of the voices who are often pushed out of the mainstream. There are endless sonic offshoots and subgenres that are also part of this story, like the brega funk-inspired styles dominating Brazil’s pop charts today or the bachata-reggaetón concoctions that once ruled airwaves in the mid-’00s. Our selection of songs is by no means definitive, but rather a curated introduction to a complex and ever-changing movement.\n\nWe hope this list allows you to reconsider the genealogies of urbano, get nostalgic for an old favorite, or think about this music’s new directions. In a world where Latinx artists are often only celebrated based on their legibility to Anglo listeners, and where many of urbano’s black and brown originators have been left behind, revisiting this movement’s history is an opportunity to recognize the barriers urbano has overcome, and to imagine a more radical and just future for our communities. –Isabelia Herrera\n\nEl General: “Tu Pum Pum” (1991)\n\nEl General is the face of a Panamanian movement that predates him, one rooted in talent from the barrios of Panama City and Colón. The country’s established scenes of plena (reggae en español) and dancehall are undeniably pivotal in urbano’s evolution story.\n\nThe sonic backbone of “Tu Pum Pum” is a familiar one, derived from Jamaican dancehall—only now, its rhythm was coupled with Spanish-language, dancefloor-ready words. It was one of El General (born Edgardo Franco)’s first hits, and the onset of a revolution: The riddim (in which we hear Jamaican producer Karl Miller heavily sample Little Lenny’s “Punnany Tegereg”) highlights the drum that bounces off the song’s dancehall core, whispering a blueprint that would later be refined into the reggaeton we know today. That rhythm served as a precursor to Puerto Rico’s underground, molded by plena and hip-hop en español. (This was just a year after Vico C started making moves in Brooklyn.) Underground would then coalesce into reggaeton in New York and Puerto Rico.\n\n“Tu Pum Pum,” as well as “Muévelo” and “Te Ves Buena,” are classics in Franco’s limited but impactful discography. Some erroneously called “Tu Pum Pum” “Latin rap cumbia,” while others anchored its place in history as the first Spanish-language dancehall song to make it onto U.S. radio. And while neither were quite on the nose in defining the nebulous sound, everyone agreed there was no going back. El General is considered a flag-bearer for the enormous scene that would unfold. He now evokes nostalgia as a pioneer and reminds us how important it can be to color outside the lines. –Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nListen: El General, “Tu Pum Pum”\n\nNando Boom: “Ellos Benia” (1991)\n\nOn “Ellos Benia,” the Panamanian MC Nando Boom debuted the pronounced boom-ch-boom-chick dembow beat that drives seemingly every reggaeton track to this day. The prolific riddim—created by a collective of Jamaican and Panamanian producers in New York—caused a since-unstoppable ripple effect and laid the foundation for Puerto Rican underground, reggaeton, and Dominican dembow. The Spanish-language take on Shabba Ranks’ 1990 dancehall track was the first and last time Nando Boom veered in this direction, and it’s the song he’s most known for—unlike his early romántico tracks, this song mimicks the homophobic, bullying nature of Ranks’ original. Problematic factors aside, though, its significance is undeniable in parlaying an early sound into a landscape-shifting new movement.\n\nNando Boom remained in his native Panama throughout his career and plateaued before the rest of the world could catch up to him. Similarly to Renato, Chicho Man, and other talents from his generation who turned barrios into creative hubs in Panama, Nando Boom had a lack of resources and industry investment. Like him, the then-nascent Panamanian scene never bloomed in the way it should have. –Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nListen: Nando Boom, “Ellos Benia”\n\nDaddy Yankee: “Donde Mí No Venga” (1992)\n\nReggaeton may trace its roots back to Panama, but it was in San Juan that the genre crystallized into the music we know today. In the early ’90s, the club and hip-hop collective the Noise released a series of influential mixtapes that would mark the dawn of reggaeton’s foundational style. In addition to the series engineered by DJ Negro, his peer DJ Playero created his own stream of mixtapes featuring local MCs from a ragtag studio setup at his home in San Juan’s Villa Kennedy projects. The eponymous series, released between 1991-92, blended hip-hop, reggae, and Spanish-language freestyling into a style called underground, an early precursor to reggaeton. “Donde Mí No Venga” (“Where I’m at Don’t You Come”), the opening track of the studio album Playero 37, is strong evidence of the direct link between reggae and reggaeton, sampling Red Fox and Screechy Dan’s “Pose Off” as Daddy Yankee fires off unironic patois (“Strictly raggamuffin comin’ at ya...lordamercy”). The iconic dembow riddim is prominent, but as reggaeton was still taking shape, it sounds as much Jamaican as it does Puerto Rican. Playero 37 is also significant in that it marked the first time a record label agreed to distribute the music, the first milestone on the way to reggaeton’s international dominance. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nListen: Daddy Yankee, “Donde Mi No Venga”\n\nLa Atrevida/Rude Girl: “Aventura y Romance” (1996)\n\nBefore Ivy Queen’s feminist perreo anthem “Yo Quiero Bailar” (“I Want to Dance”) and her 1998 album The Original Rude Girl, there was this Rude Girl: a Panamanian pioneer whose songs carried a serious femme power vibe. Though little of the artist (who also went by La Atrevida) is known beyond her recorded work, this hit and the entire record it’s on (La Atrevida 100% Latina) have aged like fine wine.\n\nFrom its inception, urbano has been a largely male-dominated scene. On “Aventura y Romance” (“Adventure and Romance”), a woman who is completely satisfied with her independence but eager to boost her love life sings this inner battle. “Tengo dinero, muchos hombres, pero eso no me hace/Lo que yo quiero es un gran romance” (“I have money and lots of men, but that does nothing/What I want is a great romance”), she sings. Rude Girl (born Excenia Knights) was riding a wave all her own, rapping over a plena and dancehall concoction that highlighted her spoken-sung vocals. Knights brought women into a conversation that was already happening about them, but had previously excluded them. While men sang about women’s physiques and libidos, Rude Girl confidently crooned about the intricacies of love and the duality of being 100% Latina and black. On La Atrevida 100% Latina, Rude Girl’s only record, the Panamanian Brooklyn resident makes the listener feel like being a woman—and a woman of color, at that—in this male-dominated industry is worthy of celebration. –Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nListen: La Atrevida/Rude Girl, “Aventura y Romance”\n\nTego Calderón: “Pa’ Que Te Retozen” (2003)\n\nFew sounds rouse a crowd like the high-pitched, staccato blast intro of “Pa’ Que Te Retozen” (loosely, “So You Can Get a Kick Out of This”). Tego Calderón’s strain of melaza (underground reggaeton) was instantly identifiable in the sea of tracks coming out of Puerto Rico in the 2000s, both because he was one of the first Afro-Latinos and one of the hardest rhymers in the scene. This glistening, sweat-imbued classic taps into and celebrates the scorned-upon perreo culture that flourished alongside reggaeton’s rise. In the single’s video, a large group of black Latinos and Latinas grind on the air and each other as Calderón raps over the now-established reggaeton rhythm.\n\nCalderón—and his genius producer here, Rafy Mercenario—were ahead of their time in more ways than one. In his experimental debut album, El Abayarde, Calderón incorporates rhythms like salsa and reggaeton to his familiar hip-hop style. “Pa’ Que Te Retozen” is an indispensable and progressive part of the genre’s history, because Calderón knew that fans of reggaeton were far from one-dimensional, and thus felt no need to assimilate into styles palatable to his white peers. The genre is all the better for it. –Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nListen: Tego Calderón: “Pa’ Que Te Retozen”\n\nIvy Queen: “Yo Quiero Bailar” (2003)\n\nIn the 1990s, one early reggaetonera came to save us all from urbano’s male minefield: “la caballota,” “la diva,” “la potra”—aka Ivy Queen. After getting her start working with the boys at the Noise, San Juan’s hip-hop collective and eponymous nightclub, Ivy Queen set out for a solo career. It was the best thing she could have done: By 2002, she’d gathered just enough unbothered energy to release “Yo Quiero Bailar” (“I Want to Dance”), a then-unheard-of feminist gem celebrating the joys of sexual agency and proclamations of dancefloor consent.\n\nIvy’s comically medieval overture—complete with icy harpsichord-plucks—sets the scene for her etiquette rulebook, but she soon launches into her rich, modern flow. “Porque yo soy la que mando” (“I’m the one in charge”), she insists—whether she’s talking sweaty club antics or pressures to take the party home. For a generation of young women whose perreo nights were so often spoiled by unwanted male advances, “Yo Quiero Bailar” is the affirmative anthem they still carry to this day. –Jenzia Burgos\n\nListen: Ivy Queen, “Yo Quiero Bailar”\n\nDaddy Yankee: “Gasolina” (2004)\n\nThere is perhaps no better testament to the legacy of “Gasolina” than this: Sixteen years later, some of us are still debating whether the song is about cum, a girl who likes to party, the Puerto Rican cocktail drink found at gas stations across the island, or maybe a combination of all of these things. (To be clear, the Big Boss himself has said over and over that it’s just about turning up.) Regardless, the ruthlessly addictive track marked a sea change for reggaeton, heralding the genre’s commercial transformation and global ascent. Peaking at No. 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2005, “Gasolina” quite literally announced reggaeton’s arrival into the mainstream with a tooth-baring snarl (“Who’s this? Da-ddy Yan-kee!”). The Luny Tunes production spliced up revving engine samples, a hyperspeed pre-chorus, and a sticky (though uncredited) hook from the iconic reggaeton chorus girl Glory, igniting a movement in the process. The video, which seemed to air endlessly on MTV, took the diesel motif to the next level, bringing the function to the racetrack alongside motorcycles and hot rods. A whole generation will remember “Gasolina” as the soundtrack to school dances, late-night car rides, and moist basement perreos, even if Anglo audiences still think it’s just a one-off novelty. –Isabelia Herrera\n\nListen: Daddy Yankee, “Gasolina”\n\nEddie Dee, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, Tego Calderón, Voltio, Vico C, Zion, Lennox, Nicky Jam, Johnny Prez, Gallego, and Wiso G: “Quítate Tú Pa Ponerme Yo” (2004)\n\nIn 2004, an army of stars revived a 1971 salsa sensation, “Quítate Tú” (“Step Aside”) by Fania All-Stars, to send a powerful message: Reggaeton is here, and it’s not going anywhere. They were recruited by the singer-songwriter Eddie Dee for his 12 Discípulos collaborative album, and were responding to the sad state of the genre: In the ’90s, reggaeton had been criminalized in Puerto Rico for its obscene lyrical and visual content. Cops raided stores selling its records, listeners were fined for blasting the music through their cars, and fans were targeted under the pretense of violence and drug use under the anti-crime initiative Mano Dura Contra el Crimen, which targeted poor neighborhoods. In the industry, it also received no love: The Latin Grammys dismissed reggaeton’s existence for years.\n\nEddie Dee and his collaborators challenged this. The song’s cryptic piano intro served as a warning for the masses to brace themselves. It dissolves once the conga-created tumbao—the traditional rhythm that characterizes salsa—rises, and Vico C sings, “Quítate tú pa’ ponerme yo/Vamos a ver aquí quién es quién” (“Step aside so I can step in/Let’s see in here who’s who”). Imitating the original salsa hit, the rappers jump in individually with their verses, overflowing with joy; with each talent, a signature salsa instrument is also highlighted, including the trombone and conga drums. Together, these displays of individual prowess coalesce into the spirit of a movement.\n\n“Quítate Tú Pa Ponerme Yo” is now known as one of the greatest reggaeton joint tracks of all time. It changed the game for reggaeton in the mainstream, cracking the Top 10 of the Billboard U.S. Latin Tropical Airplay charts and receiving several nods at the 2005 Billboard Latin Music Awards. And its prophecy has been proven more than correct: Reggaeton is here to stay. –Jennifer Mota\n\nListen: Eddie Dee, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, Tego Calderón, Voltio, Vico C, Zion, Lennox, Nicky Jam, Johnny Prez, Gallego, and Wiso G, “Quítate Tú Pa Ponerme Yo”\n\nJ Balvin: “6 a.m.” [ft. Farruko] (2014)\n\nThe video for “6 a.m.” starts with J Balvin and Farruko clinking their glasses in a cheerful toast over a sweeping city panorama. That simple gesture was symbolic of how the song tied two distant reggaeton scenes, in Medellín and Puerto Rico, together.\n\nMedellín is often seen as the place that brought reggaeton into wider commercial territory. While that’s frequently told as a success story in the industry, it also represents a dilution of the genre and a push away from its black roots. J Balvin, a white Colombian, became the most prominent ambassador of the Medellín sound, and he was determined to reach global terrain by breaking out of his country. “6 a.m.” offered that moment for him.\n\nBy collaborating with Farruko, Balvin signaled that he had the street cred of Puerto Rican artists, who represented a tougher aesthetic and gave him legitimacy in reggaeton, without abandoning a safer image for himself. Even the song, with its bright hook and playful lyrics about the morning after a wild party, kept his brand palatable and easy to market. The strategy was a success: “6 a.m.” became Balvin’s first Billboard No. 1 on the Latin Airplay charts and shot him into the mainstream. In the process, he flipped a switch on reggaeton, shifting its course toward the softer, radio-friendly fare that continues to dominate the industry. –Julyssa Lopez\n\nListen: J Balvin, “6 a.m.” [ft. Farruko]\n\nLuis Fonsi: “Despacito” [ft. Daddy Yankee] (2017)\n\nLuis Fonsi is no reggaetonero. The Latin pop chameleon was once best known for his ballads, and came up idolizing boy bands like Menudo and opening for Britney Spears. But nine albums into a 20-year pop career, reggaeton’s massive popularity drew him to Daddy Yankee, its biggest export. The reggaeton they made together is admittedly somewhat sanitized, with lyrics more suggestive than scandalous and Daddy Yankee’s considerable urbano cred toughening up Fonsi’s soft edges.\n\nWielding what reggaeton scholar Wayne Marshall dubbed a “weaponized chord progression,” Colombian producers Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo married the dembow riddim to the four most popular chords in pop music and made an inescapable hit. The song got an even bigger boost when Justin Bieber jumped on a remix, but by that point, it was already No. 1 in a dozen countries. It is more evidence that the dynamic in “crossover” hits has changed; when Anglo stars want to drift off of Latin pop hits, they’re now the ones asking—and usually, singing in Spanish.\n\n“Despacito” (“Slowly”) is often pointed to as the flashpoint for urbano’s explosion in the Anglo mainstream, though it’s more accurately a symptom of Latin music’s growing popularity rather than its cause. More than anything else, “Despacito”—the most-watched YouTube video of all time—is Exhibit A that pop music has fully consumed reggaeton and música urbana. It’s no longer just the sound of the underground, and there’s no going back. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nListen: Luis Fonsi, “Despacito” [ft. Daddy Yankee]\n\nSech: “Otro Trago” [ft. Darell] (2019)\n\n“Otro Trago” (“Another Drink”) effectively captures the story of reggaeton in 2019: over plaintive piano keys and a slow-whine dembow riddim, two Puerto Rican-Panamanian artists sing about a girl who’s trying to drown her romantic sorrows in fake friends and liquor. No longer the hard-hitting slick talk of yesteryear, today’s reggaeton is pure pop—engineered explicitly for the “discotheque,” as Darell cheekily puts it on “Otro Trago.” The song marks the direction that today’s urbano generation is headed; between high-profile features and the success of his own solo album, Sech’s soulful vocals have garnered him more than 3 billion YouTube hits in the last year, a rare occurrence for an industry that has often pushed out Afro-Panamanians from a genre they helped create. Few could have imagined that a genre born between the black and working-class communities of Panama, New York, and Puerto Rico would transform into what it is today, but this is the reality of 2020, and “Otro Trago” points to its future. –Isabelia Herrera\n\nVico C: “Tony Presidio” (1990)\n\nJuanito Alimaña, Pedro Navaja, Tony Presidio. For many Latinxs, each of these characters exist almost as a real being in our minds, with full-fledged lives and stories that feel as palpable as our own. Silhouettes of characters imagined by Héctor Lavoe, Willie Colón, and Rubén Blades are penned with invisible ink, brought to life through compact storytelling—an art form that feels like a relic in our era of God-awful bland mainstream pop.\n\nTony Presidio’s creator is one of the greats. In the early ’90s, the 19-year-old Brooklyn rapper Vico C scored a hit out of the gate with this track, a familiar tale of a well-intentioned fuck-up’s rapid rise to glory and the seedy demise that soon follows. The insistent loop in the chorus, coupled with the cryptic violin strings that hug the backbeat, lace in the listener until the very end of the narrative.\n\nVico C’s impassioned yet mellow delivery collided hip-hop and Caribbean sounds, opening the gates of possibility for hip-hop en español and marking yet another instance of Puerto Rico’s longstanding musical exchanges with mainland sounds. Cruz’s influence is evident to this day in stylish acts like Bad Bunny, who references the fellow Puerto Rican on his “Desde El Corazón” (“From the Heart”). And “Tony Presidio” lives on as the start of a new era in hip-hop, language differences aside. –Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nListen: Vico C, “Tony Presidio”\n\nIvy Queen: “Muchos Quieren Tumbarme” (1997)\n\nWhen Ivy Queen first auditioned for the Noise, the famed hip-hop collective and club in San Juan, Puerto Rico, she was so nervous that she rapped with her back to the group’s leader, DJ Negro. You wouldn’t suspect any such timidity after hearing the defiant, guttural intensity of her voice on “Muchos Quieren Tumbarme” (“Many Want to Knock Me Down”), one of her first songs with them. While her 2002 solo hit “Yo Quiero Bailar” (“I Want to Dance”) was her declaration of femme empowerment on the dancefloor, “Muchos Quieren Tumbarme” is a reminder that she was singing about her autonomy long before then.\n\nReggaeton was largely an underground phenomenon in the late ’90s, and rappers took their cues from hip-hop en español as they spit bars over dembow riddims and drum breaks. The harder a rapper could deliver, the more they stood out, particularly in collectives like the Noise. Ivy Queen’s message on “Muchos Quieren Tumbarme” was a subversive one, given how masculine and often misogynistic the scene was, but the song was significant because it emphasized her impeccable skills and flow as an emcee. In her verses, Ivy Queen has the attitude and braggadocio that came from hip-hop en español, and her agility doesn’t betray any of her strength as she dares her haters to just try and topple her. –Julyssa Lopez\n\nListen: Ivy Queen, “Muchos Quieren Tumbarme”\n\nControl Machete: “¿Comprendes Mendes?” (1997)\n\n“¿Comprendes Mendes?” (“Do You Understand Mendes?”) didn’t just become Control Machete’s most popular single; it catapulted Mexico’s hip-hop movement to the international stage. The song conquered airwaves in the biggest cities in Latin America, becoming the first Spanish-language rap to get a high rotation on MTV Latinoamérica.\n\nAs admirers of Cypress Hill and the Wu-Tang Clan, Control Machete similarly adopted an aggressive tone over traditional drum breaks. With this formula, lead rappers Pato and Fermin are unstoppable in “¿Comprendes Mendes?,” dispatching equal parts anger and street wisdom. Starting here, Control Machete created a blueprint for Mexico’s hip-hop scene and made Spanish-language rap’s popularity spike beyond the country. –Jennifer Mota\n\nListen: Control Machete, “¿Comprendes Mendes?”\n\nMexicano 777: “Hagan Ruido Las Pistolas” [ft. Tempo] (1998)\n\nPuerto Rican rapper Mexicano 777 was an unusual force in the ’90s hip-hop scene. While his peers Daddy Yankee and DJ Playero explored the proto-reggaeton movement, he supplied the masses with razor-sharp bars and music that reflected his relationship with crime and violence. “Hagan Ruido Las Pistolas” (“Guns Make Noise”) is an ominous early track that captures his talent.\n\nHere, Mexicano introduced himself to the game with anger, holding nothing back about his feelings toward other rappers. Joined by fellow Puerto Rican rapper Tempo—an ideal ally, who matched his tone and aggression—the pair unleashed their fury against those who dared to challenge or doubt them. “Pues voy a hacer un sacrificio con tu vida/Voy a dejar que tu misma gente decida si te mueres o respiras” (“I’m going to make a sacrifice with your life/And gonna let your people decide if you die or breathe”), Tempo rapped. Mexicano and Tempo seesaw their verses back and forth for the rest of the song, as traditional drum breaks meet the haunting sounds of bullets. Considered a classic hip-hop en español diss track, “Hagan Ruido Las Pistolas'' is part of a thrilling series of rap battles in the late ’90s that also involved veterans like Lito & Polaco and Arcángel. Mexicano 777 is now widely regarded as a pioneer in gangsta rap en español. –Jennifer Mota\n\nListen: Mexicano 777, “Hagan Ruido Las Pistolas” [ft. Tempo]\n\nTego Calderón: “Abayarde” (2002)\n\nWalking around with ankles out in Puerto Rico can mean getting pestered by un abayarde, a relentless little fire ant with no plans of letting go. For Tego Calderón, it’s also an inspiration; his 2002 debut effort, El Abayarde, is full of cunning wordplay and his booming drawl. On its title track, the MC raps steady over sprawling horns, repping seriously boastful bars and thoughtful tributes. “Desde la cuna/Agradecido de esta negrura” (“From my cradle/I’m grateful for this blackness”), he rhymes, offering gratitude for his black identity in a scene that often neglected to mention it.\n\nToday’s vocabulary of “Afro-Latinidad” wasn’t as mainstream in the early 2000s, especially on an island where the idea of “mezcla” or “tres razas” heritage—a blend of European, indigenous, and African roots—proliferated in popular culture. Yet Calderón unabashedly set his blackness on the table. He became El Abayarde with the flow—and back then, a proud ’fro—providing reggaeton with the social urgency of hip-hop’s proud and varied past. –Jenzia Burgos\n\nListen: Tego Calderón, “Abayarde”\n\nJoa el Super MC: “Calle es Calle” [ft. El Lápiz Conciente] (2003)\n\nSanto Domingo is famed as the center of the Dominican Republic’s urbano scene, and the early 2000s were undoubtedly some of the genre’s formative years. “Calle es Calle” (“Street Is Street”) is one of the most essential tracks to emerge from this era. El Lápiz Conciente and Joa el Super MC’s descriptive storytelling of underage pregnancy, violence, police corruption, and the other daily struggles in the barrios of the capital heavily resonated with the masses. Similarly to American gangsta rap, the track was both a product and a reflection of the brutal realities of densely populated neighborhoods with heavy economic burdens.\n\n“Calle es Calle” launched local underdogs El Lápiz Conciente and Joa el Super to mainstream fame and made an enduring impact; today, they are celebrated as pioneers in Dominican rap. The video for “Calle es Calle'” further illustrated the harsh realities of living on the streets of Santo Domingo, especially the overwhelming deaths due to gun violence. The song lives on as an anthem for Dominican youth, and it pointed to Dominican hip-hop’s future directions. –Jennifer Mota\n\nListen: Joa el Super MC, “Calle es Calle” [ft. El Lápiz Conciente]\n\nCalle 13: “Querido FBI” (2005)\n\nWhen the FBI murdered the revolutionary Puerto Rican pro-independence leader Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, they prompted island-wide protests and inspired the mouthpiece of a movement: Residente. The 27-year-old rapper penned a feverish response just hours after Ojeda’s death. “Querido FBI” (“Dear FBI”) was released under the moniker Calle 13, Residente’s alt-rap group with his stepbrother and producer, Visitante, and his sister and singer, PG-13—the same group who would go on to win the most Latin Grammys in history.\n\n“Querido FBI” went viral almost immediately, thanks to its clinking beat, Residente’s bellicose flow, and its shift in the atmosphere altogether: On an island where playful reggaeton reigned, here was a fresh taste of hip-hop en español’s utmost politicization. “Querido FBI” stands out as the genre’s earliest condemnation of the United States’ political relationship to the commonwealth (or colony, depending on who you ask). That earned Calle 13 equal parts clout and contempt, but the response only cemented their attitude of defiance—defiance of reggaeton’s cornier themes, of the standard dembow riddims, of everything you’d think to expect from an urbano artist in the aughts. Only legends have the audacity. –Jenzia Burgos\n\nYaga & Mackie: “El Pistolón (Remix)” [ft. De La Ghetto, Arcángel, and Randy] (2007)\n\nIf you’re looking for the flashpoint for Latin trap’s ascent into the mainstream, it’s hard to argue with the DJ Luian and Mambo Kingz posse cut “La Ocasión.” But if you ask De La Ghetto or Arcángel, it’s not the first Latin trap song: That honor belongs to “El Pistolón,” a decidedly more aggressive ode to gunslinging. Both Arcángel and De La Ghetto emerged out of Puerto Rico’s reggaeton scene, but they grew up between the mainland and the island; they rapped in Spanish, but hip-hop and trap were a part of their upbringing. De La Ghetto even lived in Memphis for a stretch. The track’s piano triplets and horns might have aped the style permeating the American South at the time, but the rapid-fire flows en español were all their own. “El Pistolón (Remix)” was ahead of its time—it would be almost a decade before De La Ghetto would jump on “La Ocasión”—and its influence is undeniable. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nListen: Yaga & Mackie, “El Pistolón (Remix)” [ft. De La Ghetto, Arcángel y Randy]\n\nMessiah: “Si Ta Bien” (2014)\n\nWhile many of the biggest names in Latin trap have come out of Puerto Rico, the genre was heavily influenced by the bicultural experiences of Spanish-speaking rappers living in cities like New York and Washington, D.C. The Dominican-born, Harlem-raised Messiah spent the early part of the 2010s experimenting with Spanish-language rhymes and American hip-hop beats. In 2014, he teamed up with his frequent collaborator, the Dominican DJ Flipstar, in a studio in the Bronx to remix Kazzie and Rick Ross’ “Yeah OK.”\n\nWithin 30 minutes, they’d laid down “Si Ta Bien,” a thundering, three-minute cut that distilled the relentless swagger of English-language trap songs into a pioneering Spanish exercise in brashness and bravado. It was an early entry in the Latin trap movement, and an introduction for many. Other details—like the fact that the song features a white-passing rapper dropping the n-word repeatedly—embodied the racial dynamics with which Latin trap still grapples. Today, other Spanish-language rappers from Spain and Argentina are also mirroring the style and trafficking in the same territory, complicating these racial dynamics further. –Julyssa Lopez\n\nListen: Messiah, “Si Ta Bien”\n\nFuego: “Se Me Nota” (2015)\n\nFrom the first few seconds of its bachata-suffused loop, “Se Me Nota” (roughly, “It Shows”) shows Fuego’s prescient approach to música urbana. Before Bad Bunny and El Alfa’s “La Romana” introduced trapchata sounds to mainstream urbano, on “Se Me Nota,” producer Sango collided a sample of Joe Veras’ ’90s classic “Se Te Nota” (“It Shows”) with a bassline designed to blow out your speakers. Released in the final days of 2015 as a lead-up to Fuego’s career-defining album Fireboy Forever II, the track foreshadowed the prolific future of Latin trap, harnessing the creative promise of the then-burgeoning genre.\n\nIn its early days, Latin trap was largely characterized by straightforward remixes of English-language rap songs. “Se Me Nota” proved that the movement could transcend these expectations; Fuego was not only able to translate and adapt the bravado of Atlanta trap into Spanish, but he could also draw on his Dominican roots to create artful, edgy anthems of his own. “Se Me Nota” will go down as one of the songs that helped foster a sound that would soon mushroom across Latin America and its diaspora, transforming the music industry in the process. –Isabelia Herrera\n\nListen: Fuego, “Se Me Nota”\n\nDe La Ghetto, Arcángel, Anuel AA, and Ozuna: “La Ocasión” (2016)\n\n“La Ocasión” felt like a passing of the torch in the Puerto Rican music industry. The track paired the reggaeton heroes Arcángel and De La Ghetto with the young upstarts Ozuna and Anuel AA; giving them equal billing signaled that the newcomers had the approval of their predecessors, and it propped them up as potential standouts in a new, brash generation.\n\nPerhaps more significantly, the beat—a slow, 808-driven riff on Atlanta trap produced by DJ Luian and Mambo Kingz—was a quiet signal that the sonic tide had started to shift in urbano, too. Mass-produced, often anodyne pop-reggaeton had lost some luster, and trap en español suddenly held the promise of expansion, experimentation, even danger. The verses of “La Ocasión,” overtly sexual and risqué, led some radio stations to ban the song. But that didn’t deter listeners: The track collected millions of views on YouTube and became the cornerstone of influential streaming playlists like Trap Kingz on Apple Music. A star-studded remix including Daddy Yankee, Nicky Jam, Farruko, J Balvin, and Zion seemed like a final transmission, announcing to the industry that the Latin trap era had arrived. –Julyssa Lopez\n\nListen: De La Ghetto, Arcángel, Anuel AA, and Ozuna, “La Ocasión”\n\nBad Bunny: “Soy Peor” (2016)\n\nDriven by Bad Bunny’s bellowing, morose baritone, “Soy Peor” (“I’m Worse”) chronicles the origin story of a sadboy destined to become a star. At the end of 2016, the Puerto Rican artist unleashed this breakout solo hit, which laments a doomed relationship over washed-out metallic hi-hats and pallid drums from DJ Luian and Mambo Kingz. Harnessing the trap aesthetics of Atlanta and the drug-addled, damaged sentimentality of R&B singers like the Weeknd, Bad Bunny announced his arrival as the poster boy of Latin trap, proving he was more than just a features king with co-signs from reggaeton royalty like Arcángel and Ñengo Flow.\n\n“Soy Peor” was Bad Bunny’s trap jeremiad; on it, he mourns the twisted romance that bred his insecurities, vowing never to fall in love again. And though it pretty much blamed the women in his life for his troubles, “Soy Peor” foreshadowed Bad Bunny’s flair for compelling, narrative-driven songs about the adversities of fame, the anguish of heartbreak, and the ecstasy of self-discovery—a talent that would soon catapult his career into unimaginable directions. –Isabelia Herrera\n\nListen: Bad Bunny, “Soy Peor”\n\nBryant Myers: “Esclava (Remix)” [ft. Anonimus, Anuel AA, and Almighty] (2016)\n\nOne of Latin trap’s early viral hits, Bryant Myers’ “Esclava” (“Slave”) centers around the idea of a motel-room tryst with love-slave roleplay. Lyrically, it’s a bit cringey, but also part of the schtick that contributed to Myers’ early success, solidified by his Maluma collab “Cuatro Babys” (“Four Babes”) which led to a petition calling for its removal from streaming services for excusing violence against women.\n\nSo even though Myers’ career has dovetailed with a Latin trap wave “Esclava” helped propagate, he seems to understand that the more egregious elements of his early hits could hold him back, so he has moved into a pop direction as he pursues mainstream success. His instrument is unique; as one of the few traperos who almost never uses Auto-Tune, Myers’ gravelly voice remains distinctive, even if this posse cut only hints at a range that spans from froggy depths to emo highs. And despite the cringe, “Esclava” is a certified banger, with a smoothed-out bassline, skittering 808 hi-hats, and a sinister horror-movie synth melody that’s the perfect vehicle for a trap flow en español. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nListen: Bryant Myers, “Esclava (Remix)” [ft. Anonimus, Anuel AA, and Almighty]\n\nMenor Menor: “Falsas Promesas” (2018)\n\nWhen Menor Menor dropped “Falsas Promesas” (“Fake Promises”) in 2018, he had already released “Ahora Sé” (“Now I Know”) with the Puerto Rican trapero Lary Over, becoming the first Honduran artist to rack up 1 million views on YouTube within 24 hours. “Falsas Promesas” was a softer, more melodic entry into his then-short repertoire that showcased his low, languid delivery. The track was also an opportunity for Carbon Fiber Music, the label founded by Puerto Rican reggaeton and trap artist Farruko and his manager, to position Menor Menor as a rising maverick who could bounce between different urbano styles.\n\nDJ Boyo: “Las Mujeres Andadoras” (1993)\n\nThe early ’90s were urbano’s formative years. As a transnational and Afro-diasporic movement, migration played a key role in the distribution of music in sectors like Kingston, Jamaica; Río Abajo, Panama; New York; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. In the Dominican Republic, imported sounds began to influence a new style, pulling elements from Jamaican dancehall, reggae en español, and “underground” (a predecessor to reggaeton) mixtapes and albums like DJ Playero’s self-titled series. This assisted the evolution of what is known today as Dominican dembow.\n\nInfluenced by Shabba Ranks and Nando Boom’s hits, DJ Boyo—a native of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic—was one of the first to experiment with the riddims. To echo the lively musical elements of styles like merengue and bachata, Boyo set out to create music that catered to the dynamic personality of his hometown. Manually spinning his turntables, amping Cutty Ranks’ 1992 track “A Who Seh Me Dun” to a hectic 115 BPM, he sparked the early experimental stage of dembow—one that sampled Jamaican riddims but tailored the songs to the rhythmic tastes of locals—and created the first Dominican dembow hit. As the father of the scene, Boyo paved the way for many dembow MCs (“dembowseros”), and initiated the rise of a homegrown style that is today synonymous with the Dominican Republic. –Jennifer Mota\n\nListen: DJ Boyo, “Las Mujeres Andadoras”\n\nLos Ando Locos: “Ando Loco” (2006)\n\nDJ Boyo’s experimental beats were not an overnight success; after them, it still took years for a dembow hit to spark. The urbano community largely regarded the music as unoriginal and disposable, and thought it was competing with the more mainstream rise of reggaeton. Still, dembowseros worked to define and organize the industry throughout the late ’90s and early ’00s. Then came “Ando Loco” (“I Go Crazy”), a diss track recorded in Santo Domingo. The lyrical attack, launched by the MC duo Los Ando Locos against their rap peer Jhon Distrito, felt fresh; rather than leaning into reggaeton or hip-hop, they delivered their punchlines and crafty bars over the snare drums of a traditional dembow beat.\n\nFor two years, the machuqueo—the distinctive boom-ch-boom-chick of the dembow riddim that underlines “Ando Loco''—saturated neighborhoods in all corners of the Dominican Republic. Its rapid popularity was significant in a time when reggaeton controlled urbano and club scenes, and when other musicians derided dembow for using decade-old samples. Dominican media also offered it no support on top television channels and radio stations, but it still became a hit thanks to its widespread dispersion on the internet and on USBs handed off between fans. The song propelled Dominican dembow to national success and is considered the awakening of a new era for the movement, motivating several artists to come. –Jennifer Mota\n\nListen: Los Ando Locos, “Ando Loco”\n\nPablo Piddy: “Si Tu Quiere Dembow” (2011)\n\nAn early pillar of dembow, Pablo Piddy revamped his nimble bars from his days with the rap crew DVC (Dominio Verbal Callejero) and affixed them to gritty beats. “Si Tu Quiere Dembow” (“If You Want Dembow”) is his calling card, an addictively repetitive single in which the boom-ch-boom-chick of Jamaica’s dembow riddim goes into earworm overdrive. The pace hurtles upwards of 110 BPM right as Piddy reminds us how he’s got us all “fasciná” (“fascinated”) by his dizzying flow. It’s borderline assaultive, but that’s the point. Piddy hopped on the attack relatively quickly, back when many Dominican rappers were still arguing over whether dembow was “real” music. If they only knew then: There’s nothing more real than a beat that won’t let up. –Jenzia Burgos\n\nListen: Pablo Piddy, “Si Tu Quiere Dembow”\n\nDoble T y El Crok: “Pepe” (2012)\n\n“Pepe” is rooted in Santo Domingo, where 16-year-old Anderson Miguel Álvarez González (Doble T) and 17-year-old Michael Valdez de la Rosa (El Crok) lived in the Capotillo barrio. When an uncle Pepe (a bumpkin from the countryside) came to visit, the teens watched women flee, and the hook was born: “Pepe Pepe, por ahí viene Pepe/Mira cómo corren cada vez que ven a Pepe” (“Pepe Pepe, here comes Pepe/Look at how they run every time they see Pepe”). Pepe’s name lent itself to the lyrical repetition that makes dembow so danceable, and the song quickly became a smash, leading the teens to become the first dembowseros to perform on the iconic variety show Sábado Gigante. The hit would climb as high as No. 5 on Billboard’s “Tropical Airplay” chart, proving the international commercial viability of the sounds of the Dominican Republic’s underground. Doble T y El Crok ultimately became one-hit wonders who lost their money in bad business deals, but “Pepe” lives on as a bellwether for dembow’s larger acceptance. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nListen: Doble T y El Crok: “Pepe”\n\nLa Delfy: “Dame Leche (Cocoro)” [ft. Jhon Distrito] (2012)\n\nEight years after its release, “Dame Leche” (literally, “Give Me Milk”) still stands as one of dembow’s most euphoric celebrations of queer sexuality. La Delfy, one of the genre’s first openly gay artists, sings the praises of good dick over a breakneck, blown-out fever pitch riddim, a percussive foundation of Dominican dembow. Produced by Bubloy, now a foundational figure in the movement, “Dame Leche” also displays the genre’s embrace of chopped-up, duplicative vocal samples, producing the sharp hooks that now comprise a prime ingredient of dembow, putting La Delfy’s influential flow on full display. A raspy verse from La Delfy’s collaborator Jhon Distrito reminds us of the carnal pleasures of doing it from the back.\n\nToday, there is an entire community of queer dembowserxs and social media personalities like La Pajarita La Paul, La Kisty, and La Shakatah Astoa who weave playful come-ons and salacious hooks into their music. The scene—and Dominican society at large—continues to suffer from homophobia and violence against the LGBTQ+ community, so predictably, many of these artists remain at the margins. But at the very least, the new generation can thank La Delfy for laying the first stone. –Isabelia Herrera\n\nListen: La Delfy, “Dame Leche (Cocoro)” [ft. Jhon Distrito]\n\nLa Materialista: “La Chapa Que Vibran” (2014)\n\nWhen the first few seconds of “La Chapa Que Vibran” (“Shaking Asses”) hits in the club, you know that some well-deserved culo-bouncing is in your future. La Materialista’s ode to vibrating ass cheeks was ubiquitous in the summer of 2014, soundtracking seemingly every after-hours Dominican function in New York. Aided by La Materialista’s sharp, staccato moans and a breathy, inquisitive hook, “La Chapa Que Vibran” fully embraces dembow’s proclivity for sex-positive bombast, with tough-talk, Dominican slang lyrics like “A tu jevo le gu’ta/cuida’o si te quilla’” (rough translation: “Your man likes it/Careful if you get irritated”) punctuating the beat, an addictive loop of a vibrating cell phone. The song produced a seemingly endless stream of reworks, too, an early sign of dembow’s contemporary eminence in underground global club music.\n\n“La Chapa Que Vibran” also arrived during the initial surge of women in Dominican urbano, when artists like Amara La Negra, Milka La Mas Dura, and La Insuperable started to command the attention of the industry, dropping pro-sex anthems left and right. In a male-dominated, oft-misogynistic business, songs like “La Chapa Que Vibran” provide a refreshing alternative—and finally put women’s pleasure at the center. –Isabelia Herrera\n\nListen: La Materialista, “La Chapa Que Vibran”\n\nEl Alfa: “Dema Ga Ge Gi Go Gu” [ft. Bad Bunny] (2016)\n\nBad Bunny was skeptical when DJ Luian first approached him with a Latin trap-dembow collab alongside El Alfa. He didn’t comprehend the movement at the time, making him feel uneasy about the song. It wasn’t until he flew to the Dominican Republic from his native Puerto Rico and stepped into a Dominican nightclub that he understood the genre’s power. He claims his life changed in that moment, and his union with El Alfa on \"Dema Ga Ge Gi Go Gu\" shifted how the urbano community viewed dembow and its global potential.\n\nIn dembow’s early years, artists were often criticized for facile lyrical structures and repetitive lines. In “Dema Ga Ge Gi Go Gu,” El Alfa presented punchlines and witty comebacks over trap 808s and snares, proving that both he and the genre had evolved since his playful 2009 dembow hit, “Coche Bomba” (“Car Bomb”). The song’s smooth fusion was coined “trapbow” by producer Chael Produciendo, whose transitions and layering came to define the subgenre. The title of “Dema Ga Ge Gi Go Gu” originates from the Dominican slang term “demagogo”—basically, a hater—and its vibrant chorus brings an extra intensity to that takedown. The quick-witted lyrical delivery, paired alongside the trapbow fusion, attracted rappers who were once skeptical of dembow and Latin trap artists who relished the beat, too. –Jennifer Mota\n\nListen: El Alfa, “Dema Ga Ge Gi Go Gu” [ft. Bad Bunny]\n\nRochy RD: “Trucho” [ft. Kiko El Crazy] (2019)\n\nWith “Trucho” (“Wavy”), Rochy RD and Kiko El Crazy highlight one of the many colloquial terms of el bajo mundo (or the underground scene of dembow). Dominican street codes and phrases like “rulay”—which equates to feeling “wavy,” “groovy,” or simply the coolest person in the room—have remained an essential aspect of the island’s rap and dembow movement since its early years. However, this jargon is often dismissed in elite Latin American spaces, deemed low-class and too “niche” or culturally specific for broader Latin American audiences. Because of this lack of understanding outside the Dominican Republic, many artists choose to remove the words from their lyrics and cater to the international market.\n\n“Trucho,” however, is a 2020 take on “rulay.” The track is a standout in the current “dembow underground” movement, a countercultural subscene that explores the opposite of mainstream dembow: While some of those singers have watered down and cleansed their lyrics to appeal to global audiences, underground dembowseros embrace their Dominican vernacular heartily. “Ahora es trucho,” (“now it’s trucho”) a voice growls before the traditional machuqueo beat drops. Then Kiko unleashes a breathless couplet, assuring listeners, “Hoy salgo pa’ la calle/Y me vo’a poner trucho” (“Today I’ma hit the streets/And I’m going to get nice”). The song is a pregame hit, a car stereo bop, and a club banger all in one. Perhaps most notably, this subscene of dembow sidesteps the fancy flute styles and beats of the mainstream scene. The collision of hip-hop and drum breaks creates a drier undertone, specifically highlighting the rap verses, and the result is electric. –Jennifer Mota\n\nDJ Marlboro: “Melô da Mulher Feia” [ft. Abdullah] (1989)\n\nBetween the 1950s and early 2000s, the population of favelas in Rio de Janeiro grew dramatically—the product of scarce public housing programs and unplanned urban expansion. At street level, the scenario was not so different from a subset of the South Bronx in the ’70s: a large, young, black population that wanted to party despite tough living conditions. This background laid the foundations for Brazilian funk, a genre that from its inception was deeply connected to club culture, also favoring danceable tracks, boiling-hot venues, and heavy soundsystems. DJ Marlboro was a high-profile figure in the early Brazilian funk scene, since he’d performed on many radio shows and gigs in Rio in the 1980s. In these sets, he dropped hip-hop anthems such as Afrika Bambaataa’s “Planet Rock” or DJ Battery Brain’s “808 Volt Mix,” which became rhythmic cornerstones for Brazilian funk (or, as it’s called in the U.S., baile funk).\n\nSoon, Marlboro teamed up with half-a-dozen prominent young vocalists in the scene to produce the first Brazilian funk album. Funk Brasil featured “Melô da Mulher Feia” (“Song of the Ugly Woman”), a seven-minute medley by Marlboro and a set of melôs (parodies that arose organically during funk parties when the public sang, in Portuguese, to the sound of American hits). Inspired by 2 Live Crew’s “Do Wah Diddy,” “Melô da Mulher Feia” delivers a simple set of snares and kickdrums interpolated by a syncopated drum attack. This structure became the essential sonic recipe of Brazilian funk.\n\nToday, listening to Abdullah’s lyrics will make you crack a wry grin. Just like its inspiration, “Melô da Mulher Feia” has grown old as a raunchy, subtly misogynistic song about women. In the years to come, the misogyny of this movement would become a center of public debate in the Brazilian media, whether as an important feminist critique or as a pretext to undermine a music movement born in black and marginalized communities. –Felipe Maia\n\nListen: DJ Marlboro, “Melô da Mulher Feia” [ft. Abdullah]\n\nCidinho & Doca: “Rap das Armas” (1995)\n\n“Rap das Armas” (“Guns Rap”), one of the most enduring examples of old-school Brazilian funk, is a snapshot of the narrative-driven rhymes, chin-jutted defiance, and globally appealing beats that grew out of Rio’s favelas. The track was first written and released in 1992 by the duo Junior e Leonardo, who rapped about the struggles in their neighborhood and denounced gun violence over a minimal, homemade beat. Their approach mirrored what many Brazilian rappers were using funk for: as an avenue to voice issues faced by the country’s marginalized, mostly black communities.\n\nHowever, the song took on a new, insolent tone when the duo Cidinho & Doca recast the verses into a blustering taunt that warned policemen to stay out of their home in Morro do Dendê, which was once regarded as one of the more dangerous favelas in Rio. The onomatopoeic chorus of “parapapa,” intended to evoke the pop of guns, was an upbeat yet lethal provocation that Brazilian officials quickly banned from radio. That didn’t stop Cidinho & Doca’s take on “Rap das Armas” from gaining popularity; when European electronic DJs began experimenting with Brazilian funk during the 2000s electronic wave, the song sprung up in remixes that caught on in Portugal and charted in Sweden and the Netherlands. –Julyssa Lopez\n\nListen: Cidinho & Doca, “Rap das Armas”\n\nMC Primo: “Diretoria” (2003)\n\nFrom the late-’80s to the mid-’00s, Brazilian funk was nationally and globally referred to as “funk carioca,” which translates to “funk from Rio de Janeiro.” Even though other Brazilian cities had their own movements, few built prominent local scenes. The exception was a coastal area close to São Paulo: the Baixada Santista. Starting in the mid-’90s, this region was the first Brazilian funk outpost that provided other venues and gigs for Rio's MCs and bred a pool of performers who were not cariocas at all.\n\nMC Primo was one of its biggest pioneers. “Diretoria” (“The Managers”), his first and only hit, delivers a conscious yet not vulgar statement about living and surviving the daily struggles in a favela—from avoiding gangs to seeking a way out. Sadly, Primo was shot to death in April 2012 at the age of 28, in a series of other murders that targeted MCs from the Baixada Santista, but his touch expanded the borders of Brazilian funk and resonates in the scene today. –Felipe Maia\n\nListen: MC Primo, “Diretoria”\n\nTati Quebra-Barraco: “Boladona” (2004)\n\nHailing from a Rio de Janeiro favela, Tati Quebra-Barraco uprooted any and all expectations the world may have had of funk carioca. The Rio MC is venerated as one of the first women to break through in the male-dominated genre, but she became much more than the movement’s token: She declared herself its empress, imbuing funk carioca with deliciously irreverent, feminist-as-hell verve. Tracks like “Boladona” (“Moody Lady”) are emblematic of her legacy. Sampling Layo & Bushwacka’s international house hit “Love Story,” which exploded in Brazilian nightclubs in the early ’00s, the track cut-and-pastes hazy piano stabs, four-on-the-floor rhythms, and funk carioca’s signature tamborzão beat into a slick funk fantasy. Quebra-Barraco developed a reputation as an iconoclast, penning subversive lyrics that denounced racism, sexism, and the stereotypical criminalization of favela culture. She put black women first in her lyrics, breaking ground for subsequent titans like MC Carol and Karol Conka. –Isabelia Herrera\n\nListen: Tati Quebra-Barraco, “Boladona”\n\nBackdi and Bio G3: “Bonde da Juju” (2008)\n\nSão Paulo and Rio are just an hour’s flight away from each other, but paulistanos and cariocas (people born in São Paulo and people born in Rio, respectively) have prided themselves as polar opposites of the Brazilian spirit. (The split is not unlike America’s East Coast–West Coast rap rivalry.) Funk really landed in São Paulo when the city organized parties fueled by local MCs and producers instead of creating a byproduct of Rio funk. This movement started to emerge in the mid-2000s, when cheap computers and internet access allowed kids in working-class districts to build their own makeshift studios and labels. Along with that, MCs pushed progressivism in their lyrics, avoiding the funk style of probidão (“prohibited funk”) from Rio and sexual and violent lyrics, and adding the social consciousness of local hip-hop. The result was an accessible form that resonated with a wide audience beyond the favelas.\n\nAnd so the subgenre of funk ostentação (“ostentation funk”) was born, devoted to an opulent lifestyle packed with designer clothes, fancy cars, and enormous villas. The beats, especially in the late 2000s, mirrored Rio’s baile funk productions. But what was distinctive for São Paulo MCs was their aggressive flow, structured over intricate rhymes, a style tied to the blunt cadences of the local rap scene. (São Paulo is home to many Brazilian rap pioneers such as Racionais MCs and RZO.) A district on São Paulo’s east side, Cidade Tiradentes, was the first neighborhood to really embrace this movement. Backdi and Bio G3 stood out in this nascent scene with a song that depicted a flashy dress code for funkeiros (baile funk fans) over a steady tamborzão beat. Young boys from São Paulo finally saw themselves in lyrics that made direct references to Oakley's Juliet sunglasses, the “Juju”—a symbol of champagne dreams realized. Backdi and Bio G3 were also entrepreneurs, since they promoted funk concerts in São Paulo favelas when many considered it simply a fad. “Bonde da Juju” was a beloved song during their performances. –Felipe Maia\n\nListen: Backdi and Bio G3, “Bonde da Juju”\n\nMC João: “Baile de Favela” (2015)\n\nBefore Brazilian funk grew to global prominence, it dominated in the largest city in Latin America. In the years after the ostentação movement mushroomed, funk was no longer centered in Rio; it was ubiquitous in every major favela in São Paulo. Hundreds of fluxos (block parties) sprung up around the city, fueled by itinerant sound systems and kids devouring new funk releases every week. MC João captures this zeitgeist in “Baile de Favela” (“Slum Party”), a straightforward homage to neighborhoods like Heliópolis and Marcone, which are still home to the largest parties in the city. João’s rhymes are driven by a minimal rhythmic section, the pontinho (a common melodic riff), and a grime-ish overdubbed voice—something that expanded on the makeshift sound of the late-’00s São Paulo funk tracks.\n\nDJ R7, the producer behind João’s song, was born in the north of Rio, in the state of Espírito Santo. He left his city as soon as his beats started making a buzz on YouTube (especially on the influential music channel KondZilla). In São Paulo, he had to face fierce competition, a reality that has become a commonplace dynamic of baile funk in Brazil. Every month, new producers from São Paulo, Rio, Recife, and many other cities reshape the music and set new trends, navigating the waters to build an enduring, successful career, or surviving the stigma of being a one-hit wonder. The latter was the case for João, but “Baile de Favela” is the sound of Brazilian funk as its epicenter shifted from Rio to São Paulo, paving the way for funk to grow in Brazil and around the world. –Felipe Maia\n\nListen: MC João, “Baile de Favela”\n\nMC Fioti: “Bum Bum Tam Tam” [ft. Future, J Balvin, Stefflon Don, and DJ Juan Magan] (2017)\n\n“Bum Bum Tam Tam” is the “Old Town Road” of funk carioca: It has at least five remixes, its collaborators are unexpected, and its first iteration is a real delight. On its first remix, São Paulo rapper MC Fioti shares space with an international roster of stars: Future (Atlanta), J Balvin (Colombia), Stefflon Don (England), and DJ Juan Magan (Spain), and they prove worthy of each other’s clout. Balvin acknowledges funk carioca’s birthplace in the favelas, Fioti admits the lilting flute is intended to get in your head, Future and Magan trade off boisterous bars, and Don delivers a cocksure message for all the women in the room. And they all have one thing in mind: getting you to back that ting up.\n\nFioti recorded the track at age 23, hitting a sample from a 1723 Bach instrumental composition, “Partita in A Minor for Solo Flute.” In the brilliant production, he stretches out a slice of its core and infuses it with carioca’s bass-bumping tamborzão beat. Then he adds a hypnotic flute intro and baritone vocals. The result is an instantly recognizable funk moment from the last decade. A four-star heavyweight spin like this could be humdrum, considering urbano’s current oversaturated state, but this piece was significant in further placing funk carioca in the limelight. –Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nListen: MC Fioti, “Bum Bum Tam Tam” [ft. Future, J Balvin, Stefflon Don, and DJ Juan Magan]\n\nAnitta, MC Zaac, and Maejor: “Vai Malandra” [ft. DJ Yuri Martins and Tropkillaz] (2017)\n\nAnitta has all the makings of a global pop star. She is arguably Brazil’s most promising triple-threat, savviest social-media figure (hello, 45 million Instagram followers), and most thoughtful funk collaborator today. She also boasts a humble origin story, having risen to fame from a Rio de Janeiro favela. We hear that history most on tracks like “Vai Malandra” (“Do It, Flygirl”), in which Anitta borrows the tamborzão-based rhythms of the favelas’ funk carioca.\n\nThis borrowing can get messy, of course—especially when you’re gunning for international stardom. By 2017, Anitta’s growing effort to appeal to Anglo audiences saw the launch of the English-titled Check Mate—a bold project in which she released a new song every month that year. “Vai Malandra” came last. Here, Anitta recruited fellow Brazilian MC Zaac and American rapper Maejor (who rhymes in English) for the effusive yet decidedly crossover-conscious funk club banger. It caught the lasting attention of fans and detractors alike—on the one hand for its undeniable earworm charm and, on the other, for Anitta’s murky commercialization of the Afro-diasporic genre. So goes the crossover curse. –Jenzia Burgos\n\nListen: Anitta, MC Zaac, and Maejor, “Vai Malandra” [ft. DJ Yuri Martins and Tropkillaz]\n\nMC L da Vinte e MC Gury: “Parado no Bailão” (2018)\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, “rap” had no clear definition among young black artists from Rio and São Paulo. Funk, after all, sounded like a Brazilian form of rapping, and baile funk anthems like “Rap das Armas” (“Guns Rap”) and “Rap da Felicidade” (“Happiness Rap”) contributed to the overlap. This “rap” label was eventually attached to hip-hop artists from São Paulo, whose music nodded to the boom-bap sound and social consciousness of American groups like Public Enemy.\n\nThe city of Belo Horizonte was the first place where funk beats were accompanied by conscious and political lyrics, back in the early 1990s. It took awhile, however, until the first funk songs from Belo Horizonte reached the top of the charts in Brazil. This happened in 2018 with MC L da Vinte and MC Gury hit. “Parado no Bailão” (“Standing Still at the Bailão”) is an emotional song about a teenager who, frustrated with love, decides to drown his sorrows at a baile funk party. The moaning isn’t melancholy, though; it’s more bittersweet. The song’s percussion is full of empty space and, along with the underlying horns, it creates a danceable yet not exactly carefree atmosphere. MC L da Vinte e MC Gury proved that even in the festive Brazilian funk scene, there is room for heartbreak, and other artists have started following in their footsteps. –Felipe Maia\n\nListen: MC L da Vinte e MC Gury, “Parado no Bailão”\n\nKevin o Chris: “Evoluiu” (2019)\n\nBefore Rio hosted the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, it instituted a new law enforcement program and placed police stations in several favelas. This led music makers in Rio to pull back, but not to quit: A new variety of funk started cooking in tiny studios and block parties—a style known as “funk 150 BPM.” This self-explanatory name describes a scene of producers who are shortening and reassembling funk rhythmic patterns with harsh, raw percussive attacks, heavy kick drums, and micro-sampled vocals. Just like in jungle or drum’n’bass, unexpected, slow-paced melodic vocals fit in quite well in this frantic rhythm. It is an evolution of funk, as Kevin o Chris has aptly titled his defining hit. When the 22-year-old sings “Eu sou o Rio” (“I am Rio”) he is staking a flag for his entire hometown: funk has returned to its birthplace.\n\nWganda Kenya: “Shakalaode” (1982)\n\nChampeta, the genre of percussive folk music known throughout Colombia, came directly from Africa. According to most accounts, boats from West Africa would dock in Colombia’s coastal, predominantly black neighborhoods, and an exchange of African traditions—South African mbaqanga, Congolese soukous, Caribbean dancehall—sprung from these transatlantic connections. Artists easily adapted these sounds into other popular styles of Colombian music, foreshadowing how strains of champeta have since wound their way into reggaeton and urbano formats in recent years.\n\nWganda Kenya, a mixed-raced group from Medellín, became one of the most well-known ensembles to record their version of African songs. Their repertoire included “Shakalaode,” a seven-minute rendition of the psychedelic B-side “Shakara” by the Nigerian activist and Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti. “Shakalaode” represented the way that Colombian artists would reinterpret rhythms and punctuate them with horn sections and congas, forming a rounder-sounding hybrid that continues to inform how champeta is played today. –Julyssa Lopez\n\nListen: Wganda Kenya, “Shakalaode”\n\nCarlos Vives: “Pa Mayté” (1995)\n\nCarlos Vives, a costeño (coast baby) from Santa Marta, Colombia, catapulted to stardom with his band, La Provincia, in the 1990s. The coquettish track “Pa Mayté” (“For Mayté”)—a celebration of Palenque (champeta’s city of origin) and its African roots—remains one of the most recognizable in his catalog. It’s a flirty, irresistible affirmation of life.\n\nIn his discography, Vives dips his toes into everything from accordion-driven vallenatos (folk music from Colombia) to típico (folklore), and concocts a breed of champeta that lives between its fundamental classic form and the more popularized version today. His approach strips the genre of local jerga (jargon) and pays homage to its origins while exposing the rest of the world to the rich styles that had been resounding from picós (local sound systems) for years. Like so many before him, Vives is a white artist doing what many melanin-rich creatives had already been doing with fewer resources, but he’s self-aware enough to pay respect where it’s due. –Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nListen: Carlos Vives, “Pa Mayté”\n\nEl Sayayin: “La Voladora” (2000)\n\nWhen Colombian producer José Quessep first took 14-year-old Jhon Jairo Sayas to Cartagena’s Bazurto market, a hotbed of the country’s African music scene, talent scouts deemed him too skinny to ever be a star. But that boy would soon power up—not unlike the Saiyan, a warrior race from the Japanese manga and anime staple Dragon Ball Z—and become the father of modern champeta.\n\nUnlike the cartoon from which El Sayayin drew his stage name, “La Voladora” (“The Flying Mother-in-Law”) is anything but kid-friendly: It’s an ode to the taboo act of seducing your mother-in-law. Its video acts as an instruction manual for champeta dancing, with a laid-back, circuitous grind that kicks into high gear midway. The sparse beat—all drums, guitar, and a tinny, synthesized horn section—can trace its roots to Jamaican dancehall and reggae, sampling the famous “Murder She Wrote” riddim from Chaka Demus & Pliers. Tragically, though El Sayayin’s influence looms large with contemporary champeta artists like Kevin Flórez and Mr. Black, he didn’t live long enough to witness his impact on the culture; he was gunned down in 2012 at just 30 years old. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nListen: El Sayayin, “La Voladora”\n\nMr. Black: “El Serrucho” (2013)\n\nIn 2013, Edwin Antequera Mercado—also known as Mr. Black—set out to create a banger for the people of his hometown of Cartagena, Colombia. The champeta artist envisioned a song that would motivate Cartagenians to dance during the Fiesta de la Independencia, a celebration that honors the city’s battle during Colombia’s 10-year fight for independence from Spain.\n\nDrawing on traditional Colombian folk music like vallenato—a style from the Caribbean region of the country—and cumbia—an emblematic fusion of African, European, and Indigenous musical influences—Mr. Black revolutionized the genre with “El Serrucho” (“Hand Saw”), adding new colors to traditional champeta with undertones of electronic music and sharp accordion sounds. The eclectic touches worked well with the Afro-diasporic style based on soukous from Congo and highlife from Nigeria, instantly becoming a national favorite and the signature song for Carnival that year. Furthermore, “El Serrucho” made Mr. Black one of the most important champeta artists of the decade. –Jennifer Mota\n\nListen: Mr. Black, “El Serrucho”\n\nSystema Solar: “Tumbamurallas” (2015)\n\n“Tumbamurallas” (“Tear Down Walls”) is a battle cry, no doubt: Its seven members sing “Con puño’ arriba/tumba ya toda’ la’ muralla’” (“With fists in the air, topple all borders”). But if its lyrics were expunged, it’d feel almost festive—because, to some extent, it is. It’s a preemptive celebration of the freedom that could be. The protest anthem is imbued with champeta’s sonic staples—wind instruments and varied percussion, heavy on conga drums—and the group’s mellifluous cries resound throughout. Its flair is in its simplicity, and its context hinges on the political roots of champeta.\n\nIn 2015, the vibrant communities on the Venezuela-Colombia divide were flooded by Venezuelan soldiers in an attempt to close the once-open border. As it so often has before, music soundtracked and mobilized this moment of political turmoil and protest in Latin America, metaphorically giving voice to a complex situation. Systema Solar released the most defining song of this conflict. It was popular throughout the latter half of the decade, helping awaken ears far beyond the border. –Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nListen: Systema Solar, “Tumbamurallas”\n\nKevin Flórez: “La Pikotera” (2019)\n\nWhat Colombian star Kevin Flórez does on “La Pikotera” (“Sound System”) isn’t so different from what Puerto Rico’s reggaetoneros did with the dembow riddim—he, too, is retooling a beloved and familiar sound. The vanguard of champeta urbana brings all of hip-hop’s bass, drums, and Auto-Tuned glory to champeta’s skittering rhythms, both on this track and across the album on which it appears, 2018’s El Rey de la Champeta Urbana. That’s an apt name, since this “king” of champeta urbana has popularized the genre both in Colombia and beyond, even collaborating with big-shot reggaetonero Nicky Jam for a “Con Ella” remix that boasts over 31 million views to date.\n\nFor all his international appeal, however, Flórez still looks to Colombia’s picós for inspiration. On “La Pikotera,” Flórez delivers reverent, breathily sung bars about someone dancing with all eyes on her at the picó (not unlike fellow colombiana Shakira’s memorable homage during Super Bowl LIV). It’s no coincidence that this hit marks the sound of champeta urbana’s global future, while also offering a knowing ode to the engine that keeps its picós going: the women who show up to dance. –Jenzia Burgos\n\nListen: Kevin Flórez, “La Pikotera”\n\nContributors: Jenzia Burgos, Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo, Isabelia Herrera, Julyssa Lopez, Felipe Maia, Jennifer Mota, Matthew Ismael Ruiz"
