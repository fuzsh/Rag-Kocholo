Learn more about them and listen to their track âStrong Enough.â\n\nAbout Pollyanna Blue: Pollyanna Blue was formed in the summer of 2019 by Zoe Collins (guitar and vocals) and Rich Earle (Bass and vocals). Their name was inspired by a self-help book âFeel The Fear And Do It Anywayâ, which talks about a nickname âPollyannaâ, typically given to a person who is deemed overly optimistic. That ethos, blended with the waves of difficult emotions life throws at you, creates a concept of musical juxtaposition within the 90s/00s alt-rock atmosphere which sees the now-three-piece wield their self-discovery, vulnerability and love of music to create something authentic and raw to connect with anyone experiencing some type of hardship.\n\nIntroduction and update: 0:45\n\nIntro to the band: 3:45Â\n\nBackground on the band and members: 3:59\n\nThe bandâs discography: 5:20\n\nThe bandâs sound: 5:35\n\nFor fans of: 16:03\n\nAccolades and mentions: 16:27\n\nMore information on the band:Â 17:17\n\nLearn more about Pollyanna Blue and their music in this episode.Â â â Get a full transcript of the show hereâ â ."
