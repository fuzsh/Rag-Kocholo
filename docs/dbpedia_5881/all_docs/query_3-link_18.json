        "text": "You know that saying about absence making the heart grow fonder? Well that‚Äôs pretty much my connection with the outdoors. I was born and raised in Queens so I quickly learned to cherish my family‚Äôs excursions to scenic areas like our timeshare at the Shawnee Inn near the Poconos. Swimming in the Delaware River was fun and so was learning about the different plants and animals but I was an only child. My fondest memories there consist of running around with other kids and constantly getting into trouble! A few months ago, we performed at our friend‚Äôs wedding at that very same Shawnee Inn. While her and her hubby created new memories, all of my childhood ones resurfaced along with some new realizations.\n\nOn the long drive back home after the wedding, Sadiki and I chatted about how different the same place can seem with a new perspective. The venue‚Äôs historic charm was so much more apparent, especially during the gorgeous wedding ceremony. Outdoor wedding ceremonies are always nice when the weather cooperates but this one felt particularly magical. As we started setting up under the protection of a majestic tree, I noticed a huge scar that I‚Äôm guessing was caused by lightning or a violent storm. I wish I had taken a picture of it but we still had to sound check and then setup for Cocktail Hour and the First Dance so time was limited. The scar was incredibly deep and almost as tall as the tree itself. We were absolutely stunned that the tree survived, somehow managed to heal and even continued to grow. Chills ran through my body as my inner child imagined the stories this tree would tell me if we were able to communicate‚Ä¶ and perhaps it did communicate. Our sound that day was noticeably different and we haven‚Äôt been able to duplicate it since. Sadiki is the more scientific one of our duo so he thinks it was the combination of warm, humid air and the strange acoustics of being under the tree‚Äôs canopy but my inner child has some other ideas. Later on, we entertained during Cocktail Hour on the Inn‚Äôs porch and then returned to a pavilion near the river to perform during the First Dance. Moving our equipment back and forth across the breathtaking lawn while wearing an uncomfortable dress and painful heels is a new Shawnee Inn memory that I can‚Äôt forget soon enough but it was well worth it. The romantic afternoon transformed into an unforgettable evening of celebration and we were honored to be a part of it.\n\nAfter wishing our love struck couple goodbye, I ended up chatting with one of the Shawnee Inn employees while we were packing up. I couldn‚Äôt help but tell her that I felt like there was something sacred about the area next to the tree where we performed. She said that there actually was. Apparently, Native Americans considered it to be a sanctuary and would gather there every year for a special religious ceremony. It‚Äôs easy to understand why they did and why our friends chose that exact location for their wedding ceremony. There‚Äôs something powerfully fitting about getting married under an enduring tree that has weathered several lifetimes‚Äô worth of storms and still remembers to flourish beautifully. Watch out. Having nature officiate your wedding may become the ‚Äúnew‚Äù trend! üòâ\n\neL\n\nI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs no surprise that most of our business comes from weddings. Romantic music performed live as two souls celebrate their union makes sense. Unfortunately, ‚Äúromantic music‚Äù isn‚Äôt very tangible or objective. It can‚Äôt be seen, smelled, tasted, touched, or even heard. The songs that one couple considers to be romantic will be different from the next, yet the romantic feeling these songs evoke are the same for both. eL and I like to think that the sounds of the upright bass and voice have been in love forever, and we‚Äôre just telling a bit of their story. Fortunately, those that are engaged are experiencing that same love story.\n\nAs children, we‚Äôve all done our fair share of imagining. We imagine everything from what we want to be when we grow up to what colors our fancy cars will be. Most of all, we imagine the things, events, and accomplishments that will make us happy. As we grow older and allegedly wiser, we begin to realize that some of our childhood dreams may not make us as happy as we had originally envisioned. We modify those dreams accordingly or let them go altogether. Our weddings are no different. Whether you‚Äôre five years old or thirty-five years old, our dreams of what our weddings will entail are constantly evolving. One of our friends, who was recently married, always wanted red roses for her ceremony. That all changed when she met her soulmate during a springtime stroll through Central Park while dahlias were in bloom.\n\nA similar scenario often unfolds when an engaged couple comes across our videos or catches one of our live performances. We hear about their initial plan to hire a string quartet for their ceremony and cocktail hour, but now they‚Äôve fallen in love with our style and aren‚Äôt sure what to do. We would love to say that everyone chooses to be bold and hire us instead, but many are uncomfortable being different and stick with their original plan. Fortunately for us, there are still a few brave and creative folks out there, and as the poet, Robert Frost said, ‚ÄúI took the road less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.‚Äù That difference is where we focus our attention and talents. As a duo with unconventional instrumentation, we know that we must handsomely reward our clients, so we‚Äôve put a great deal of thought into our wedding packages. We believe we‚Äôve come up with the most personalized form of wedding entertainment that currently exists, but it does require a couple to imagine as we all did as children.\n\nBudding relationships usually have soundtracks that go unnoticed. We often wonder if our couples would have ever remembered Taylor Swift singing her heart out during their first kiss or the Romeo Santos songs in the background of a memorable evening taking Bachata lessons. These are the memories we ask them to recall to ensure that their wedding‚Äôs soundtrack pays homage to their relationship‚Äôs journey. Once the songs have been selected, we help them choose the right place for them based on their messages. Some tunes have a more celebratory message and are perfect for the recessional, while others are more sentimental and better suited for the first dance. The challenge is not to let the style of the original song get in the way. We‚Äôre known for transforming club hits and pop songs into beautiful romantic ballads, thus exposing their deeper messages. We also enjoy learning and recreating music from all over the world. So far, we‚Äôve had the privilege of performing in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, Latin, and several African dialects. We‚Äôre looking to add Hebrew, Mandarin, and German to the list, so if you know anyone‚Ä¶hint, hint! ?\n\nWhile it‚Äôs my personal opinion that we should be hired for our music, eL, an unrepentant fashionista who needs shopping rehab, believes our look should be as compelling as our sound. At her request, it‚Äôs become vital that our attire always stylishly complement the wedding‚Äôs theme and d√©cor. We‚Äôve done everything from Gatsby inspired outfits to futuristic vestments she somehow purchased from 2081. Even I have been forced to admit the obvious. Our couples really do enjoy having control of how we look, as well as sound, on their special day. Just remember that I am an unwilling participant in this dressing up thing and will not crack the faintest of smiles if the client has demanded that I wear white pants or pretty much anything pink! -_-\n\nHere‚Äôs how we enhance a couple‚Äôs wedding day:\n\nCeremony\n\nWe start by performing love songs a half hour before the ceremony begins. It‚Äôs a wonderful way to set the mood as guests arrive. And since ceremonies rarely start on time, the least a couple can do is entertain their guests until they decide to show up. We then perform our renditions of the couple‚Äôs favorites during the processional and recessional. We conclude with another song or two as guests exit.\n\nCocktail Hour\n\nCocktail hour is where we have a bit more fun. We usually perform an upbeat set from all genres, but we can customize this as well. For example, one of our couples asked us not to play any reggae during cocktail hour since they hired a reggae band for their reception. When we first started doing weddings, we were consistently booked for just the cocktail hour, but those couples always offered the same feedback. Their guests loved our performances, but since the couples were busy taking pictures and greeting everyone, they never had an opportunity to enjoy us. We want our couples to be 100% happy, so we‚Äôve created our First Dance & Dinner package so they can have their own show.\n\nFirst Dance & Dinner\n\nAs you may have gathered, I‚Äôm not the most lovey-dovey type, but I can‚Äôt deny that our unique renditions are perfect for the First Dance. It‚Äôs a couple‚Äôs first dance together as one. Isn‚Äôt it fitting that they dance to a version of their favorite love song that no one has ever heard before? And isn‚Äôt it even more fitting that the sounds of just the bass and voice represent the harmony between two people with a profound connection? Speaking of connections, we want all of our couples‚Äô dance moves to be as smooth as our music. That‚Äôs why we send them recordings of their First Dance songs beforehand so they can practice and not embarrass themselves. If they would like, we also perform for the Mother-Son and Father-Daughter Dances. After the dances, the couple can finally sit down, eat dinner, and enjoy us perform. Once the guests are ready to get their booty shaking on, it‚Äôs time for the DJ or wedding band to take over.\n\nBeware of Boring Details\n\nNow it‚Äôs time for me to bore you with the decidedly unsexy but important technical aspects of how we make all of this happen. We own three separate high-end sound systems. That enables us to set up a sound system in the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception areas and quickly move between them. Our sound systems are so easy to use that some of our couples have decided to play their own playlists (via an iPod, cell phone, tablet, or laptop) through them for the reception and forgo the expense of a DJ. We provide wireless microphones as a courtesy, and they regularly come in handy for officiants during ceremonies and announcements and speeches during receptions. If the venue warrants it, we provide a small stage and lighting as well. Although it‚Äôs a lot of equipment for us to lug around, it‚Äôs necessary since we aim to make our couples‚Äô dealings with us as easy as possible. While we drive all over the Northeast for weddings, we‚Äôre also a fantastic option for those getting married abroad. We both love to travel, and my bass folds into a much smaller case (think The Jetsons) that‚Äôs airline friendly.\n\nMost couples recognize that we are luxury entertainment, but we occasionally get couples who are surprised by what we charge. Perhaps they spoke to a harpist or violinist who quoted them a few hundred dollars to perform for their wedding. That‚Äôs similar to the difference in cost and quality of buying a wedding dress off the rack from David‚Äôs Bridal versus commissioning Carolina Herrera to create a couture gown. Both options technically get the job done, but only the couture gown was created specifically for the client and will astonish all who lay eyes on it. It requires an exceptional amount of effort, skill, creativity, and time so naturally, there‚Äôs a higher cost. Our rates are not dramatically higher than the average musician‚Äôs but what we offer is infinitely more valuable. This is due to the unparalleled level of personalization we are known for. Ultimately, our ideal couple is not consumed with having the most economical wedding possible. Instead, they embrace imagining an incredible day celebrating their love and know we are the pen and paper they must use to compose their wedding‚Äôs soundtrack.\n\neL‚Äôs Loyal Manservant\n\nIn an age where most of our music is electronically enhanced (I‚Äôm trying to be gentle), it‚Äôs a really nice feeling to receive compliments for our natural sound. It‚Äôs interesting because most people have no idea how how much nature has shaped what we do. I could tell you about how fussy Sadiki is about eating organic foods, juice fasts and cleansing but I want you to keep reading. Instead, I‚Äôll start by telling you about our rehearsals outside on his magical deck.\n\nBeing born and raised in Queens and then going to college and working in Manhattan, Sadiki‚Äôs place in the middle of the scenic Hudson Valley has always been a relaxing paradise that seemed to be constructed from the pages of a novel. I have written most of my songs in noisy apartments, on the subway or on buses. I‚Äôve then rehearsed them in churches, theaters or studios. It was a new experience to create in an environment where the only things I could hear were birds and crickets engaged in a chirping competition while the wind blowing through the leaves provided a seamlessly disarming backdrop. At first, I had to learn to focus on whatever we were working on. It was SO easy to get distracted watching the hummingbirds chase each other or marveling at the stillness of the frogs who seemed completely at peace sitting right next to us as we rehearsed. Fortunately, I grew accustomed to nature‚Äôs charms and and before long, I too was in love with creating and rehearsing outdoors. I discovered a musical freedom there that I hadn‚Äôt felt since I was a child and it‚Äôs been a tremendous part of our identity ever since.\n\nAs much as we enjoy our outdoor songwriting and practice sessions, almost all of our gigs have been indoors at high-end events. We love performing on stage with fancy colored lighting and high-tech sound systems in front of hundreds of well dressed patrons but if I‚Äôm being completely honest, it always feels like we‚Äôre reenacting the magic that only truly emerges when we‚Äôre outdoors. I‚Äôve only realized this truth during the past few months. Last winter was a long and harsh one. It may have been the worst one of my life. If not, the fact that it is the most recent one coupled with my new-found adherence to lady-like behavior (no more sleigh riding or snowball fights) certainly makes it seem so. Like most New Yorkers, I longed for spring‚Äôs return. The change in weather brought with it the pleasant gift of several outdoor bookings.\n\nBecause we grew used to performing indoors, we initially looked at performing outdoors as a logistical nightmare. Where would we get power from? Would our sound get lost since there were no walls and ceilings? And of course, would the weather cooperate? To make matters worse, our first outdoor event was a rooftop wedding in midtown. While the view was fantastic, it rained on and off all day so everyone was understandably nervous. Fortunately, the rain stopped a few minutes before the ceremony was supposed to begin and we were able to get setup and start performing on time. Although the sun decided to make a fashionable entrance, there wasn‚Äôt enough time for it to dry anything including the chairs so all of the guests chose to stand. Although it appeared inconvenient, the ceremony became even more intimate. The puddled rooftop reflected the gorgeous sky and the sun‚Äôs rays shining through the moist air created a heavenly glow around everything. The stunning bride walked in to our rendition of Robin Thicke‚Äôs Angel and it was truly one of the most breathtaking moments we have ever seen. It certainly set the tone for our other outdoor events.\n\nSince then, we‚Äôve had a few outdoor performances in the Hamptons that were beautiful but pretty much everything out there is beautiful so that‚Äôs to be expected. The first thing I noticed was how perfect the temperature was. To be fair, I‚Äôm sensitive to temperatures since my biggest professional hazard is having to wear dresses made of about as much fabric as one of Sadiki‚Äôs ties. As a result, I‚Äôm usually uncomfortably cold whenever we perform. At these outdoor gigs, the sun‚Äôs warmth has been such a cozy reprieve. The gentle breeze has also been a welcomed participant. On more than one occasion, it has encouraged the trees to sway along with our music‚Ä¶or did it just seem that way because the legendary Hamptons traffic took a piece of our sanity?\n\nAfter one of our Hamptons performances, we were invited to perform on a yacht for a small dinner party. While watching a dazzling sunset, we performed a few tunes during dinner. Towards the end of our set, the ocean was so still that it seemed like we were sailing on a sea filled with stars. The yacht swayed ever so gently and it was during this peaceful juncture we performed My Funny Valentine for a couple visiting from Europe to celebrate their wedding anniversary. The hypnotizing setting inspired us to deliver our most heartfelt performance of the song to date. When we finished, the teary eyed couple was overwhelmed with gratitude. While we graciously accepted their thanks, we shouldn‚Äôt have taken all of the credit. We would never have performed the song that way without nature‚Äôs assistance.\n\nAnd for all of this, we say thank you to nature for the many ways it has and continues to inspire us. We just hope it forgives us for expressing our gratitude via a blog post!\n\neL\n\nElasea Douglas is a gifted singer, songwriter, dancer and actress. Like many other singers, she first started singing in church as a young child. For a short time as a toddler, she believed she was the reason everyone attended the services so she took full advantage of the choir‚Äôs pauses and other quiet moments to let her voice be heard. When she was a little older, she humbled herself by singing in her schools‚Äô glee clubs, choruses and musicals. In her teenage years, she attended Bayside High School Academy of Music where she primarily received classical vocal training. She was also heavily involved in dance and theatre, in addition to being introduced to jazz during this time. Because singing was her forte, Elasea decided to double major in dance and theatre at Hunter College while she still continued to do her fair share of singing with worship groups throughout the country.\n\nAfter graduating from Hunter College, Elasea performed in several Off-Broadway shows including Dreamgirls and most impressively, a one-woman show called A Role Once Played. She made her Broadway debut as part of the original cast of the Tony Award winning show, FELA! Even though she enjoyed theatre immensely, she somehow still felt unfulfilled. She was advised to channel her creativity into her own art so she began working with producers and writing and recording her own music. She‚Äôs performed these jazzy and soul stirring originals at numerous venues including The Knitting Factory, Nuyorican Poets Cafe, Cafe Wha?, Iridium Jazz Club and Groove Cafe. Although she still loves dancing and acting and will undoubtedly utilize these talents again, creating and singing her own music has been the second most rewarding experience of this flourishing star‚Äôs young career‚Ä¶obviously her legendary church performances as a toddler will always be first!\n\nSadiki Pierre is a talented upright bass player who is uniquely capable of playing and fusing almost any style of music including classical, jazz, latin, reggae and R&B. When he first started playing the upright bass, he had no interest in actually learning the instrument and instead was only looking for a way to get out of his sixth grade class. Fortunately, he chose the right distraction from his schoolwork. It soon became apparent that he was quite musically adept. Although his parents could not initially afford to buy him his own instrument and pay for private lessons, he was still chosen to perform with the New York State School Music Association‚Äôs All-State Orchestra in addition to performing with another prestigious student orchestra throughout Europe.\n\nDespite the encouragement of those closest to him to study at a school like Juilliard or Berklee to become a full-time musician, Sadiki chose to attend an aviation school called Daniel Webster College in order to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a professional pilot. Nevertheless, he still enjoyed playing in his spare time so he continued to perform with various community orchestras and string ensembles such as the Greater Newburgh Symphony Orchestra. He also occasionally trained with a few esteemed double bass teachers including a member of the New York Philharmonic. His focus on classical music inadvertently created a longing for musical freedom that drove him to study and master jazz. Since then, he‚Äôs performed at numerous jazz clubs throughout New York City, the Hudson Valley, Boston and New England.\n\nWhile Sadiki became a promising classical and jazz bassist, he wasn‚Äôt still musically satisfied. He tried his hand at several other styles by playing with blues, gospel, R&B, funk and latin groups but ultimately, they limited his freedom to move freely back and forth between the styles. Because of this, he decided to retire from music shortly after graduating college. After a ten-year hiatus, he has rediscovered his love for music. Most importantly, he has finally found the musical projects that allow him to freely mix the different styles that he loves and form the percussive, melodic and groovy style that he will surely be known for.\n\nThe clearest of skies and blinding sunlight tell a misleading tale. This was our first official photo shoot as a duo and it was quite an experience. Our photographer, Vitus Feldmann, was a German fellow who only takes photos with iPhones and iPads. On the other hand, my bass player is a part time techy so he isn‚Äôt the biggest fan of Apple products (he actually wants the new Blackberry!) because of how ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù they are. He also detests being photographed so it took several weeks of intense negotiations before he finally agreed to this project. The temperature on that lovely afternoon was supposed to be around forty degrees but the wind was in a particularly foul mood so it felt closer to the teens. I suspect I would have been warmer just wearing lotion rather than the stunning dress by Douglas Says‚Ä¶ but Vitus said that ‚Äúone must suffer to be beautiful‚Äù so I‚Äôll try to keep my complaining to a minimum. Our videographer, Mike Larry Ward, was dressed far more appropriately and I can‚Äôt remember ever being so jealous of someone simply for having a warm hat, scarf and gloves. Sometimes, it‚Äôs the little things in life‚Ä¶\n\nWe chose Brooklyn Bridge Park as the location for the shoot because of the contrast between the autumn foliage, water and city skyline. The combination is both breathtaking and a perfect visual representation of our music. I must confess that because of Sadiki‚Äôs reservations with all things Apple (except pie), I had my doubts that an iPhone would be able to fully capture those moments. Fortunately, Vitus and his iPhone wasted no time putting me at ease. The camera accurately picked up every color and detail and even had no problem with the challenging lighting of sunset. And despite Sadiki‚Äôs aversion to being photographed, he turned out to be a natural and he‚Äôs obviously photogenic. His gift (and sometimes curse) for joking around about any and everything made the time pass quickly but it also taught everyone involved a very useful lesson. He didn‚Äôt care for the initial photos because he felt that our smiles were insincere so he decided to address the situation with childish pranks like teasing and pinching me. This led to a lot of laughter on his end and because laughter is so contagious, everyone joined him. At first, I tried not to but there were times when his antics were just too funny not to laugh at and as you can see, the results speak for themselves. Keep that in mind the next time telling someone to say ‚ÄúCheese‚Äù before a picture isn‚Äôt doing the trick.\n\nA few weeks before the shoot, a great friend of ours suggested that we learn the classic, Autumn in New York. When I first listened to the greats like Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald sing it, I honestly thought there was no way I could do it justice. Somewhere near the top of the ‚ÄúThings That Annoy eL‚Äù list is hearing or seeing someone try to remake a song or movie and having the new version end up worse than the original. Fortunately, my cowardice was spotted right away by ‚Äúyou know who‚Äù and the tune became a huge part of the photo shoot negotiations. For some time, I really struggled to learn the first verse and feared that learning the entire song would be impossible. Luckily, there was a sudden shift and I ‚Äúgot it‚Äù. The rest of the song became a‚Ä¶.well I was going to say breeze but I‚Äôm going with ‚ÄúVeend!‚Äù in honor of our iPhoneographer, Vitus, and the wicked temperatures that day. We hope you enjoy our rendition of the song, the video of the photo shoot and of course, the pictures.\n\neL\n\nRobin Williams. For those of us born during the 1980s, he was as much a household name as Sesame Street. Although he was a comic genius and a phenomenal actor, I was always especially impressed with what he was able to do with his voice. My parents were stricter than most so as a young child, I often wasn‚Äôt allowed to watch the films and shows he starred in. Because of that, I ended up listening from hallways or other rooms (they never said I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúlisten‚Äù!) and it became a game for me to guess which voice was his. Robin was far too talented so I almost always lost but it was the most enjoyable losing experience of my childhood.\n\nLike all of his fans, news of his death was shocking to me. Hearing that he committed suicide struck an even deeper chord. It‚Äôs always difficult to accept death but Robin brought so much joy and laughter into our world that it seems like he violated an unspoken rule by moving on without warning. The more thought I gave the situation, the more unfair it seemed that he fell into such a dark place despite the bright light that shone through him. This led me to dig deeper into his story so I could attempt to understand this tragedy. I heard and read everything from ‚Äúhe was tormented by demons who possessed him while he performed and wouldn‚Äôt leave once the curtains fell‚Äù to the all too common struggles with drug and alcohol abuse, infidelity, loneliness, etc. In the end, I realized that understanding what he actually went through was impossible. All that matters now is a beloved man and quite possibly the most creative force of our era is no longer‚Ä¶and all because of suffering so heavy that it seemed like it could never be resolved.\n\nThere‚Äôs a song on our upcoming album called Resolve Me and its message is quite appropriate for this topic. The song is basically broken into two pieces. The first piece describes the factors that cause us to be stuck in an unhappy place. Some of these factors include habitually chasing unhealthy desires and embracing poor perspectives of our circumstances. The second half of the song is written from a place of awareness of where these choices are leading us and who we are inadvertently becoming. With that awareness, we can seek the truth and implement it by embarking upon the journey of letting go of the past, discovering, taking responsibility for and loving who we are each and every day and then making the decisions that are truly in our best interests. While we all hope that adopting a new mindset will lead to a change in our circumstances, what happens externally is ultimately out of our control. It may be cliche but all that we can control is how we react to whatever happens. Fortunately, choosing a brighter perspective means we are more likely to see the message and humor in situations that previously would have made us sad or angry. And if we can learn to find the light in life‚Äôs darker times, we‚Äôll ultimately be more joyful and at peace.\n\nOne last note about Resolve Me. It‚Äôs by far our most demanding song to perform. Its melodies, rhythms and lyrics are exceedingly difficult. When we perform it flawlessly, it leaves everyone who hears it feeling vulnerable, convicted and ready to take an honest look in the mirror and deal with their issues. But when our performance of it isn‚Äôt quite right, it leaves us feeling haunted and incomplete. This is ironic for several reasons but most of all because it‚Äôs so hard to perfect that it‚Äôs the last absolute last song we choose to perform whenever we are asked to perform some of our original music‚Ä¶\n\nIt‚Äôs difficult to find the proper words to end a somber post like this but first we would like to say thank you to Robin Williams. We can‚Äôt begin to express how thankful we are for captivating, entertaining and inspiring us all. You will always be missed and may you rest in peace. To those of us that are still here, may we all encourage each other to look inside ourselves, love all that we see, good or bad and accept the daily task of repeatedly solving ourselves. It‚Äôs tremendously hard work that may never truly be complete but the reward is well worth the effort.\n\neL\n\nI recently had the privilege of seeing Finding Fela. The film is directed by Alex Gibney and shows the life of Fela Kuti, his music and the Broadway musical that helped bring his story to the world. Before I get too far into this posting, I have to be honest and admit that I was initially quite skeptical about this documentary. I‚Äôm easily annoyed by people who hold onto things for too long and refuse to let them fade away when they‚Äôre supposed to. Because I was part of the original cast of the Broadway show from 2009 to 2011, I assumed that the production company may have been milking Fela‚Äôs story a little too long. I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong!\n\nAfter hearing a few testimonials as well as rumors of footage of the original Broadway cast being in the show, I became a bit curious. I then heard from a friend that the MIST Harlem was showing the film and it dawned on me that I couldn‚Äôt pick a more ideal theatre for me to see the film. Being a part of the show introduced me to so much in my life including the simple things like helping me afford to move out on my own to my first apartment in Harlem. When coincidences like that line up, I try to see the message they point to. In this case, the obvious message screamed ‚ÄúEl, put your preconceived notions to the side and go see the film!‚Äù I showed up early the very next day and noticed that it was the film‚Äôs Harlem premier (random coincidence?). After a few speeches, the lights dimmed and the film began. Enjoying footage of our cast performing the opening number led to me getting chills of excitement and smiling from ear to ear. I think I even squealed in delight and startled the unlucky souls seated next to me! I did get control of myself and behaved reasonably well for the rest of the film in case you‚Äôre wondering. The nostalgic memories faded away as my amazement for all of the things I began to learn about Fela grew. I saw how his experiences with corruption in his country helped to forge his determination and resolve. Watching his music evolve to Afrobeat was equally entrancing. Because he was bold, slightly outrageous and passionate, I‚Äôve always been a huge Fela fan but the film really helped open my eyes to how brave and strong he was in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. He always found a way to beat the odds and achieve his goals, even when those closest to him, including his family, believed he would fail miserably. The more examples of this the film showed, the more respect I felt for him and the more inspired I became to carry on his mission. Because he allowed his creativity to flow uninhibited by the existing genres of music, he created his own genre that is now studied and revered in addition to becoming the iconic trailblazer whose story continues to touch the souls of everyone who hears it.\n\nWhile reflecting on some of the film‚Äôs messages later that evening, I couldn‚Äôt help but think of some of the challenges Acute Inflections faces creating music that is rich but minimalistic, lyrics that are thought stopping and provoking while having the combination remain easily appreciated and understood by those who may not be musically inclined. It‚Äôs hard work and it‚Äôs taking us a while to perfect but to summarize one of Fela‚Äôs messages from the film, ‚Äúanything one creates to last must be done right.‚Äù We want our music to outlive us and the messages that it delivers to speak wholeness to all that are willing to listen.\n\nOne more pseudo random coincidence before I end this verbose post. Sadiki and I met because of Fela. He was a huge fan of the show and saw it several times. We officially met for the first time at a Fela Queen Concert I performed in after the show ended on Broadway and we‚Äôve been musically inseparable ever since. Obviously there‚Äôs a lot more to the story like me forcing him to end his ten year retirement from playing and demanding that he drive to Philadelphia and retrieve his bass but if I told you everything, you would have no reason to come back and read more of our posts!\n\nTo sum this up, Acute Inflections wouldn‚Äôt exist if it wasn‚Äôt for Fela and the incredible life that he lived. Thank you Fela Kuti. We fully intend on carrying on your legacy!\n\nPS ‚Äì And go see the film TODAY!\n\neL"
