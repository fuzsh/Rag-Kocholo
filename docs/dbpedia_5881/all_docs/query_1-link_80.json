        "text": "It's been a little while—roughly 3 years--since we last heard from MxPx, the Washington-based punk trio with over ten years of rocking notched under their belts. Well, now they're back with Before Everything and After, an album that continues to revel in the more mature sound that these guys have been developing over the last few years. \"Pokinatcha\" or \"Teenage Politics\" this ain't, so the hardcore, old-school punk fans might not like this one. However, I see this album as being extremely sound in terms of the band's musical and lyrically development. Yet it still contains a fun, free-spirited nature regardless of the amount of \"punk\" that it holds.\n\nWhile to some MxPx might not be classified as punk anymore, Before Everything and After still has its fair share of punk inclined moments. The first few tracks are a good indicator of this. The driving speed of \"Play it Loud\" will have even the stodgiest fans of older punk nodding their heads. There are screamed vocal lines (with the standard \"shouting crowd\" echoing in the background) exclaiming standard punk phrases such as \"raise your voice / shout it out!\" The theme of aggressive style continues with \"Well Adjusted,\" which has an attitude about it that makes you think of a crowd of punks thrusting their fists into the air in rebellion of nothing at all. What I mean by this is that the music sounds like punk rock fare, but the lyrics aren't calling for a revolution nor are they anti-anything. Heck, they're not even really angry, which is either one of the annoying or endearing aspects of the band - these guys just have a positive message to deliver and they're not angst-ridden nor do they have any major problems with the government or their country in general. Other notable examples of these kinds of songs include \"Brokenhearted,\" \"More Everything\" and \"Capitol.\"\n\nAnother type of musical theme running throughout the album is something that sounds half pop-punk and half emo. \"Everything Sucks When You're Gone\" is a prime example of such a blend. If frontman Mike Herrera had whinier vocals this song would fit in rather nicely on any emo album from the past few years. It's just those emotional kinds of songs, you know the kind saturated with lyrics about missing the girl horribly and how, well, everything sucks when she's gone. MxPx take the plaid pants and chains off and put a skirt on for the next track, titled \"Quit Your Life.\" Rife with acoustic guitars and—gasp--even a piano, this song has Herrera crooning about the girl he loves and how he just wants her to relax, hoping that she will just \"quit your life / and stay with me / we'll order in / and watch TV.\" Thankfully, this is the sappiest the album gets, but I still might have to complain just a little that it even manages to get this sappy. I mean there's only so much saccharine coated lyrics a guy can take, you know? There's maybe two other tracks on this record that fall into this category: \"On the Outs\" and \"Don't Walk Away.\" Each has their own take on the sound and vocal stylings I've described above.\n\nPunk and sappy emo numbers aside, there are a few songs on the album that don't really fall into either one of those categories, and because of this they're worth mentioning. Whether they're just rock songs or something closer to new wave, they have a unique sound. \"It's Alright\" has a keyboard part in it that makes one sit up and take notice, while \"First Day of the Rest of Our Lives\" is a straight rock song with nice hooks and a steady beat to it. \"Kings of Hollywood\" is a medium-tempo fun song, with a nice compressed-sounding lead guitar part running throughout.\n\nAll in all, this is a great, solid effort by MxPx. The boys never disappoint with album length, either. This one clocks in at almost fifty minutes and sixteen tracks. That's at least ten to fifteen minutes longer than most of their contemporaries' recent releases. Add to this the fact that they've been releasing albums of this length for over ten years, and you've got a band that's committed to their music. This album proves the point. I think pop punk and emo fans will love this disc, and so too will the open-minded true punk fans."
