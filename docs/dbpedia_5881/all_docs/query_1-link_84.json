        "text": "2009 was the year of the Bouncing Souls. They took the entire year to celebrate their anniversary as a punk rock band for 20 years by playing tons of live shows and also releasing a song a month available for download on their record label Chunksaah Records.\n\nOn January 12th all of those songs will be released on an album titled Ghosts On The Boardwalk for all the fans that never were able to download the tracks or pick up the limited edition 7″ vinyl records that the band pressed quarterly through the year featuring the songs.\n\nI have heard most of the songs already and without going into detail yet I can tell you that they are all amazing. The band may have two decades behind them now as a band but they have not slowed down one bit. The tracks on this CD contain catchy anthem tracks that all Bouncing Souls fans can sing along to proudly and loudly.\n\nMy friends and I were just talking about the first time we saw the Bounding Souls play in Cleveland. The foursome played a bill with NOFX and Hi-Standard at the Agora to rowdy crowd. I believe the year was 1996 and even if the show is still fresh in my memory that was 14 years ago. Ever since then I became a huge Souls fan and not one of their releases disappointed me. I am thrilled these guys are still doing what they do. It makes an aging punk rocker like myself appreciate them even more.\n\nRecently the band played a Daytrotter session (that I was unaware of) and the songs they played are available for free download. I love the version of Anchors Away” they bust out. Good stuff. Click HERE to check out their session on Daytrotter.\n\nHere are a couple tracks that will be appearing on Ghosts On The Boardwalk. Support this amazing band and buy their CD when it comes out!\n\n“Airport Security”\n\n“Ghosts On The Boardwalk”\n\nIt’s been a while since I have done an interview here on BHP but I thought I would make it up all you readers out there by creating a super interview. I have been wanting to do this for a while now and thank the fine women who make up the Northeast Ohio Rock ‘n’ Roller Girls.\n\nSeeing women of all shapes and sizes skate as a pack on a oval track is indeed something that everyone needs to see. With music playing, announcers calling out the match, and the fans cheering their team the bout is just as entertaining as any other sport out there.\n\nJust in case you have no clue what I am talking about, I speak of roller derby. Specifically women’s indoor flat track.\n\nIf you have not heard of roller derby you are missing out. Maybe you live under a rock or just don’t get out much but roller derby is a pretty big deal. Don’t agree? Check it out live at least once, I promise you will think differently.\n\nNot only do the girls skate their hearts out all season long but they also get involved with charity and local organizations. Honestly, out of all of the sporting events I have been to in my life I have never seen the wholeheartedness that is seen during a roller derby bout. When you go to a match you are also going to a fundraiser of sorts with the money collected from the raffle tickets and beer sales sold by the roller derby grils during and after the bouts.\n\nLast October I attended a roller derby match at the Summit County Fairgrounds. The bout was between the Northeast Ohio Rock ‘n’ Roller Girls and the Buffalo, NY Assault City Roller Girls. Along with a nice sized crowd, I cheered the home team on to a victory. It was actually the final bout of the season so not only was it a pretty important win for the team but also a start to a well deserved break.\n\nFor those of you who do not think roller derby is a sport you really need to reconsider. The girls wear helmets just like football players do, elbow and knee pads like pro skaterboarders wear, and mouth guards (do you see what I am going here?). To top that, their playing grounds are flat concrete surfaces where they compete to score points by pushing, blocking, and shoving the opposing team.\n\nI watched girls fall hard on to the concrete that night only for them to get back up and jump back in the game. A couple of them took falls so hard I don’t think I would have gotten up myself but they were in it to win it and brushed themselves off and jumped back in the game. It was an exciting event with the fans going crazy and both teams trying their hardest for a win. When all was said and done the final whistle was blown and the Rock n Roller Girls finished their final bout of the year with a victory.\n\nSo who are these girls? Some are moms and wives, some are students, and many carry successful full time jobs. They are people just like us and they do not hide their secret of roller derby status like they belong in Fight Club. They are good people with families and friends with their own lives outside of the rink.\n\nRegardless of what their day gig is or how they live their lives, they all are part of a sport where practice is mandatory and teamwork is key. When the team comes together they become their own supportive family not only helping one another but also helping the community.\n\nRecently I had the privilege to get some questions answered by a slew of the wonderful girls of the Northeast Ohio Rock & Roller Girls as well as a couple of their referees. Instead of interviewing one team member I decided to interview as many as I could. Be prepared, this is a long read…\n\nContinue reading Interview: The Northeast Ohio Rock ‘n’ Roller Girls →\n\nDuring a time of the year where people are buy-buy -buying things for everyone on their list sometimes we forget about the true definition of the holidays. It’s easy to get sucked up into all the chaos also know as the shopping season. I myself have had enough of the retail wars that go on and spite people out there who buy things just to buy. Take that wasted money and put it towards something meaningful, like a donation. Uncle Buck does not need a Sham-Wow or a Snuggie…seriously. Imagine donating money that will go towards a gift for a sick child that will not only make their day but also help ease the pain they are going through.\n\nMy pal and yours Kevin found this great website where a simple donation can really make a child’s day. During this holiday season try to forget about all the big sales and unnecessary gifts for a moment and think about what the reason of the season is all about. (Mom, calm down, I am still calling it Jesus Day…)\n\nTake it away Kevin and Happy Holidays everyone!\n\nI’m sure that many of our readers have dabbled in a little video game geekery in their days. You may have experienced the Tetris burn while trying to go to sleep after an eight-hour bender. Maybe you feel the real measure of a man is in his achievement points? Yeah, you know how awesome all of that is. Admit it.\n\nThere are many folks out there that would think that gamers are a blight on society with their lack of social skills and appreciation for violence. Gamers are good people who would just rather spend their free time with pixels rather than a putter. You might be a little tired of video games getting a bad rap. They’re just good old fun. The creators of the webcomic Penny Arcade, Gabe and Tycho, felt the same way. From their countless hours involved in the gamer community were aware that the caricature that was drawn by news fluff pieces and congressmen were not the people they knew. Gamers are a good, generous bunch. This inspired them in 2003 to start a toy drive for Seattle’s Children’s Hospital. From that toy drive the Child’s Play charity was formed.\n\nI first heard about Child’s Play about 2 years ago on digg. At that time they were pretty much in hospitals in North America. Now, Child’s Play is currently partnered with almost 70 hospitals, (and growing). It was one of those charities that made so much sense. These are some really sick kids that are stuck in a hospital who can’t do much outside–many of them can’t stray far from a bed. Why not give them the fun of playing a game, or possibly interacting (with the permission of the parents I assume) with other people on PSN (Playstation Network) or Xbox LIVE? I’m not trying to slight these kids, they’re pretty hardcore. They have done no wrong in their short lives to anyone still life seems to be socking them in the gut. Maybe the work of Child’s Play will let them know that the world isn’t totally evil. It may be a bitch, but even bitches can be sexy.\n\nThese guys are all about the giving. They’re an international 501(c)3 entity, so they’re legit. Also, they keep their administrative costs at a bare bone 2-3%, so that means just more good stuff goes to the kids. If you want to give there are a few ways you can go about it. The easiest way is to go to the Child’s Play website to make a PayPal donation. If you want to help out your local hospital, you can also click on a location on the interactive map on the Child’s Play main page. You will then be redirected to your chosen hospital’s Amazon page. That Amazon page lists all of the books, toys and games requested by the hospital, the quantities received, and still needed. Find something on the list that you’d like to donate, and check out as you would with any Amazon purchase. Your order will then be shipped right off to the hospital of your choice.\n\nThis is easily one of my favorite charities. You know that as much of your dollar as possible goes right to making as many kids in rough situations a little happier. You really can’t go wrong with that.\n\nIf you would like to make a donation CLICK HERE and select the state you wish to donate to."
