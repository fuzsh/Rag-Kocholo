        "text": "OTHER GREAT STORIES\n\nUncategorizedS.E.R.P.E.N.T. TOUR KOKA BOOTH AMPHITHEATRE NC August 14, 2024 Review by Jed Gammon While outer bands of a weakened Hurricane Debby produced sporadic showers to the area, Slash’s S.E.R.P.E.N.T. festival provided stellar blues for the fans in attendance at the Koka Booth Amphitheatre in Cary, NC. Robert Randolf, ZZ Ward, Larkin Poe, and Slash’s Blues Band thrilled the crowd with both original music and covers that had fans dancing in the rain and made the most of the rainy evening. Opening was Robert Randolf, he never disappoints and tonight was no different. While his band only had roughly 30 minutes to play, they made the most of it by starting with “I’m So Glad” and running through a few jams. An additional treat, they invited Greensboro resident – and tour supporting act – Eric Gales onstage to accompany them on an instrumental song Randolf and Gales co-wrote years ago, however, it was the very first time they played it live. Gales stayed on for the last song, a rousing version of “Foxy Lady” by Jimi Hendrix that thrilled the audience. After a quick set change, ZZ Ward was up and played through eight songs. Before her third song, “Mother,” she explained that she is on the road with her three-year-old and six-month-old, and was therefore exhausted. It was not apparent in her performance as her voice was strong, singing through a few originals, as well as a few covers. Songs like “My Baby Left Me,” “Ride,” Cannonball,” and “Put the Gun Down,” drew cheers from the crowd. Ward ended with an excellent cover of “Cadillac Man” by The Jesters and set the stage for Larkin Poe. With the rain getting steadier, Larkin Poe started off with “Summertime Sunset” and went straight into a cover of “Jessica” by The Allman Brothers. Larkin Poe is comprised of sisters Rebecca and Megan Lovell, who provide constant energy throughout the set, singing and playing guitar and lap steel, respectively, while dressed in matching denim. Many conversations in the crowd before the show centered on the excitement of seeing this group perform. As a first timer, I can see why. They really brought the intensity through their 10-song set with eight originals that featured “”Summertime Sunset,” “Bluephoria,” “Bad Spell,” “Wanted Woman,” and the covers – “Jessica” and “Preachin’ Blues” (Son House). Their finale was a gritty blues song called “Bolt Cutters & The Family Name,” complete with full audience participation. At long last, Slash’s blues band took to the stage and they were primed and ready to entertain the rain-soaked crowd. In the blink of an eye, the venue warmed up and electricity filled the air. They began the night with “Parchman Farm Blues.” Followed by covers of “Killing Floor” and “Born Under a Bad Sign.” Despite the weather, it was obvious the band and crowd were in sync; feeding of each other, in tandem to the sonic blues journey they were now partaking in. This was my second time seeing Slash in a smaller setting, and this blues setup was a great way to witness his incredible talent. The rest of the band – Johnny Griparic on bass, Teddy Andreadis on keys/harmonica/vocals, Michael Jerome on drums, and Tash Neal on guitar/vocals – were all equally impressive, sculpting the blues sound in a different way from the originals. Slash released his second solo album, “Orgy of the Damned,” in May and played many tracks from it including “Papa Was a Rolling Stone,” “The Pusher,” and “Crossroads.” Needless to say, the album is a fantastic selection of rocking blues covers and it was great experience for all to see them brought to life. As if the show couldn’t get any better, Eric Gales came back out to lend his guitar prowess on “Stone Free” before Slash wrapped up his set. It was an incredible moment to see both these guitar giants at work. For those who stayed through the rain, the two-song encore ended with covers of “It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry” and “Shake Your Money Maker.” And just like that, the show was nearing its end. Slash thanked the crowd, told everyone to “stay dry,” and walked down to the pit handing out picks to the crowd gathered in the front. If you are used to seeing Slash on the big stage, this made for an unbelievable experience to see him and his amazing band in a more intimate setting. The hope is he will do this again soon and you can check it out for yourself!

Whether it be the temperatures starting to ease, the incredible scenes of camaraderie – and memes – at the Olympics, or politics finally having some positivity, the world does not feel like a total dumpster fire. Perhaps that was why the crowd at Marathon Music was so joyful… or perhaps it was the vibe of euphoria Dirty Heads brought to the people of Nashville. I am not being dramatic when I say this show had me wanting the night to last forever. The crowd radiated so much positivity and there was a feeling of friendship that wrapped its arms around the room and pulled us together. I saw so many people stopping to hug others with a “Hey! How are ya!” Kids dancing around – with ear protection on – and having a blast. A chihuahua was even on hand, complete with a light-up harness. The 1500-capacity venue appeared full, but I saw not one negative person and the exceptionally long line for merch resembled a friend group catching up as they waited to get their hands on a coveted Dirty Heads poster. The evening began with Nashville locals Doublecamp, and their first song, “Daydream,” had the party vibes that perfectly kicked things off. Joe Neary (vocals, guitar) and Jordan Burmeister (bass, guitar) were assisted by drummer Kortney Grinwis for the evening and by the third song, “AMFAS,” the crowd was singing along to the chorus as if they had known it for years. “Go Ahead” had the crowd jumping, and as people continued to stream into the venue, they jumped right on in too. After a cover of Young the Giant’s “Cough Syrup,” Doublecamp kept the energy up with more of their originals with highlights being “Sweatshirts in the Summer” and “Seasons.” The band is hitting the road for a North American tour and SoCal residents can catch them October 3rd at The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles, or October 5th at House of Blues San Diego. The crowd went absolutely ballistic for the next set… the one and only ROME. I had obviously heard ROME perform with Sublime, but this was my first time seeing him perform acoustic, and holy hell… dude can SING. But starting from the beginning, as ROME walked onto the darkened stage, there were so many whistles and cheers, I did not think it could get louder. Of course, when the lights went up to reveal ROME, I was shown that yes, it CAN get louder. With an “I love you all so much! Thank you for being here. We are going to have a party tonight!” Rome kicked it off with “Tangerine Skies.” After stating he had some “special homies as guests,” ROME said the next song was “the second song I put together with Sublime,” “Take It or Leave It.” ROME did some of his new songs, which were damn impressive, and delivered on his “special homies” with John Oates (yes, from the legendary Hall and Oates!), Marty Schwartz (guitar extraordinaire), and Duddy B (from Dirty Heads of course) hopping on stage to sing and play guitar with him. After some inspirational words that I intend to live by – “We are too old for bullshit. I only want to do things I like with people I like.” – ROME absolutely crushed another original and I actually blurted out, “Holy shit.” The crowd loved it too and, as they had been all through his set, responded loudly with whistles and cheers, prompting ROME to exclaim, “The energy is locked in tonight!” Sublime with Rome is currently on the Farewell Tour and will perform through October. ROME said it has been an honor to play with Sublime for 15 years and that he would not be here without Bradley, Bud, and Eric. As he went into “Badfish,” the entire room sang along, enjoying the moment, which was continued with “What I Got.” The crowd was so loud, towards the middle of the song, ROME stopped playing and the voices of the crowd took over, yet it was the same volume. With his final song being his cover of Lee Field’s “Forever,” ROME was met with incredibly loud applause and cheers of approval. The party did not stop as we waited for Dirty Heads. Whether it was country, pop, or rock music played by the sound man, the fans danced away, keeping the energy and positivity up until the lights went off. Then… It. Was. So. Loud. As “Act I” was displayed on the screen behind the stage, the Huntington Beach band of Dustin “Duddy B” Bushnell (vocals, guitar), Jared “Dirty J” Watson (vocals), David Foral (bass), Matt Ochoa (drums), Jon Olazabal (percussion), Shawn Gonzalez (keyboards), Mark Bush (trumpet), and Ruben Durazo (trombone) walked out to whoops, howls, whistles, and shouts from the fans. Watson asked if we were ready to have some fun and they launched into “Cloudlifter” followed by “My Sweet Summer.” As their reggae sound took over the room, the crowd had their hands in the air, bouncing along. I confess to never having seen Dirty Heads live before and I was truly blown away by how solidly talented the band is. The horn section is fire. Percussion playing 1,746 different types of instruments, all of which sounded amazing. (Ok, maybe it wasn’t 1,746.) Both Bushnell and Watson had singing duties and rocked it out, and Watson was all over the stage. “That’s All I Need” drew a huge response, and this CA girl always loves a Catalina Island mention. A cover of “Life’s Been Good” from Joe Walsh was followed by “Neighborhood” and “Bright Side” and the crowd continued to bounce along in celebration. Rome came out to sing “Lay Me Down” with the guys and the room went psycho crazy. Again, the energy was insane! “Day by Day” closed out the first half and “Act II” appeared on the screen, followed by the band kicking into “Midnight Control.” As I watched the shark visuals on the screen during “Rescue Me,” it really hit me just how phenomenal the visuals were all night. If I could get a copy of those, that would be great please. From here on, the audience was even more pumped for each song – “Oxygen,” “Island Glow,” “Bum Bum,” “Burn Slow” – and jumped along or had their hands in the air. Dirty Heads finished things off with “Medusa,” “Sloth’s Revenge,” and “Vacation.” I walked out of the venue saddened that it was over, but feeling content to have experienced such a night. I am so used to attending shows where there is a drunken brawl, people getting in the way recording videos, people having full-on conversations during the performance. This was none of that and it truly left me so happy, I kinda think our world may not suck after all. If you need some of that vibe in your life, check for Dirty Heads as they continue their Slightly Dirty Summer Tour with Slightly Stoopid and The Elovaters when it hits Chula Vista’s North Island Credit Union Amphitheatre on August 24th. I guarantee it will be a party!

It was hyped to be a full throttle show and fans were ready. Fans eagerly filed into the venue, the air thick with anticipation for a night of powerful performances and emotional resonance. August 3, 2024 Being no stranger to the stage, The Dirty Nil kicked things off with their signature high-energy set, blending punk rock with a touch of classic rock flair. Their raw sound resonated well with the audience, igniting a palpable energy in the room. Tracks like “Rock and Roll Band” and “Doom Boy” showcased their ability to merge catchy hooks with anthemic choruses, setting a lively tone for the evening. Next up, Joyce Manor brought their unique take on melodic punk. This Torrance-based band, had a number of their own fans gathered up near the front and were feeding off the energy of the moment and a few even crowd surfed multiple times throughout the set. Their blend of earnest lyrics and infectious melodies captivated the crowd. Songs like “Heart Tattoo,” “Constant Headache,” and “Catalina Fight Song” had fans singing along, reflecting the band’s knack for crafting relatable and poignant narratives. Joyce Manor’s performance was both tight and exhilarating, leaving the audience craving more. They were a great choice to open before The Gaslight Anthem because by the time they took the stage, the crowd was ready to take the built-up energy to the next level. It was a short intermission and as the lights dimmed -the anticipation was palpable. It was only eclipsed by the roar of the crowd. The Gaslight Anthem took the stage, bringing their rich discography to life with an inviting mix of nostalgia and raw emotion. The band, celebrating the release of their latest album, “History Books,” played a handful of songs from that album, “Positive Charge,” “The Weatherman,” and “Autumn” being personal favorites. Other highlights of the night were “45,” “Handwritten,” “Old Haunts,” and “Keepsake.” The heartfelt storytelling in their lyrics resonated deeply with the sold-out crowd, as fans sang along passionately, creating a sense of unity. Their set showcased a great mix of songs across their storied career and closing out the night with “Great Expectations,” and “The ’59 Sound” left all those in that room with a sense of joy as they filed out into the Orange County night. The night was a celebration of punk rock’s roots and its enduring legacy, as each band brought their distinct sound and energy to the stage. The History Books Tour not only highlighted the individual talents of The Gaslight Anthem, Joyce Manor, and The Dirty Nil but also reminded attendees of the vibrant community that is live music and what makes it special. It was definitely a show that lived up to the hype! The tour continues, get your tickets when they come to a venue near you.

Supporting their 2024 album of the same name, the tour has sold out multiple cities and includes Phantogram as the opener. “Can We Please Have Fun” dropped in May, boosted by singles “Mustang,” “Split Screen,” “Nothing to Do,” and “Nowhere to Run.” Brothers Jared, Caleb, and Nathan Followill, and their cousin Matthew Followill will kick off the accompanying tour on Wednesday in Austin, popping by the Kia Forum on August 22. Upon the album’s release, Caleb told KROQ’s Nicole Alvarez, the album’s title came from a list of ideas he had, and “when I said, ‘can we please have fun,’ Jared was like, ‘Yeah, I like that one.’ We kind of went along and I didn’t really think that was gonna end up being the title, but I felt like the more the album came together, it felt like, like you said, like it was a bigger statement than just us wanting to enjoy ourselves in the process of making an album, it seemed like the whole world has kind of been feeling that way.” In addition to new material, we can expect the Kings of Leon songs that made us love them: “Use Somebody,” “Waste a Moment,” “Knocked Up,” “Revelry,” “Pyro,” “Wait for Me,” “Closer,” “Notion,” and of course, “Sex on Fire.” Tickets for the Forum show are still available and priced like reasonable concert tickets!

Early arrivers to the festivities experienced an amazing opener in the all-female group, Midnight Cowgirls. Dressed in matching cowgirl outfits, their mix of country, post-punk, new wave, and rockabilly won over the crowd thanks to their melodic songs and dynamic stage presence. M I D N I G H T C O W G I R L S Fronted by vocalist and guitarist Kandle Osborne, with additional vocals and rhythm section by Jennie Vee and Leah Bluestein, and guitarist Rex Elle, they kicked off the evening with songs from their self-titled debut record. Of course SoCal is no stranger to the musical legends of The English Beat. Dave Wakeling and crew took the stage and wasted no time breaking into classics, “Rough Rider” and “I’ll Take You There.” As soon as the intro to “Tenderness” began, any person that had been sitting got their butts out of their seats and started dancing. “Save It for Later” and “Ranking Full Stop” kept the party going, and then “Mirror in the Bathroom” kept the crowd dancing and singing along. Wakeling thanked the crowd and joked that they were trying to figure out how to be the house band, so they could “play here every night!” As the sun dipped into the ocean and the moon peaked out to overlook Pac Amp, it was time for Stray Cats to take the stage. You could feel the anticipation in the air before the band took the stage, and that restless sound reminiscent of the sound of a jet just before take-off. The crowd was prime and ready for this legendary band. As the lights dimmed, the roar of the crowd took over. The crew raised the Stray Cats’ banner with the iconic cat logo overseeing Pac Amp. Suddenly, out walked front-man Brain Setzer, bassist Lee Rocker, and drummer Slim Jim Phantom. The gents waved to the crowd and the venue was set for an incredible performance, it was a goosebump moment in the OC. Starting with “Too Hip, Gotta Go,” the crowd went nuts, then they segued into “Runaway Boys,” by then everyone was on their feet, singing along to every word as they danced their hearts out. The party continued through “Double Talkin’ Baby” and “Three Time’s a Charm,” but when they started “Stray Cat Strut,” WOW. Everything went up a notch – the band’s energy, the crowd’s response. Phantom’s booming drums kept an incredible beat, Lee Rocker dazzled with his standup bass, and Setzer was Setzer; he simply electrified the crowd! Their set was heartwarming, and it captured the sonic souls of all attending. The 21-song set included “Gene and Eddie,” “When Nothing’s Going Right,” “Cry Baby,” another big fan favorite was “(She’s) Sexy + 17.” The Cats delivered the cover made famous by Aerosmith – but Yardbirds before them and Tiny Bradshaw originally – “The Train Kept A-Rollin.’” PACIFIC AMPHITHEATRE Costa Mesa, California August 1, 2024 More crowd pleasers included “Blast Off,” “Summertime Blues,” “Rockabilly Rules,” and “Fishnet Stockings” before they closed out with worldwide anthem to coolness, “Rock This Town.” The band left the stage to a standing ovation, and being the accomplished showmen they are, they returned to even more cheers. Their encore featured “Rumble in Brighton” and “Built for Speed.” Bottomline, Stray Cats proved that after 40+ years, they are better than ever, with no signs of slowing down – proving Brian Setzer, Lee Rocker, and Slim Jim Phantom really are “Built for Speed.” In the end, their devoted fans got what they came for. They got an electrifying show from one of the greatest bands to come out of any era and genre. It was a sonic journey we will be ranting and raving for some time. The band continues on their Summer Tour 2024. You need to catch these living legends while you can. Tickets for their ongoing tour are available!

Whether it’s helping people make new friends, or even just a parent handing down a cherished piece of music to their kids, there is a never-ending love shared over music. When I found out I would see UB40 at the Greek Theatre, I knew this would be a special show. My best friend Brandon and I both lost our dads. My dad passed down his love for live music to me, and this show took place a couple days before the anniversary of his passing. Brandon’s dad shared UB40 with him often growing up, as it was one of his favorite bands. There was no one else I would want to experience this night with, and there was nothing but communal love in the air as fans packed in the theatre. Opening the show was a band known as Inner Circle. These guys have been helping to carry to groove of reggae since the ‘60s, and they were the best band to start the night off. Right from the get go, Inner Circle had the crowd dancing and grooving to their tunes. Founding brothers Ian Lewis (bass) and Roger Lewis (guitar) still continue to get lost in the vibes and flow of their music. Seeing these two just bumping onstage helps carry an ear wig into the crowd that got us all bumping with them. Bernard “Touter” Harvey (keyboards), Lancelot Hall (drums), Trevor “Skatta” Bonnick (vocals), and Andre Phillips (guitar) round off the rest of the band and brought the soul of reggae alive in the fans to kick off the show. Being someone who isn’t too familiar with the genre, when they played one of their biggest hits, “Bad Boys” (the theme to “Cops”), I was completely caught off guard. As there is no way to not picture yourself as Will Smith or Martin Lawrence driving down Miami streets singing along. Other songs Inner Circle played included “One Way,” “We ‘A’ Rockers,” “Games People Play,” “Sweet Jamaica,” “Boombastic,” and “Sweat (A La La La La Long).” The reggae vibes were already settling in, and I was all for the ride we were about to go on. Up next was The English Beat, who infuse their ska and new wave sound with reggae influences. Founding member Dave Wakeling, armed with his arsenal of teardrop shaped guitars, could feel the love from the crowd as they roared for him with each song. Wakeling sings with such joy and passion to his voice, which is only exemplified by the smile of pure happiness he radiates with unto the crowd. Wakeling was backed up by a horde of musicians including sax players, keyboardists, bass, drums, and a toaster known as Antonee First Class. Where Wakeling was the rock of the band that helped keep things moving and grooving, Antonee was the injection of adrenaline into the songs that brought up the pace and energy. Their different styles of singing melded together in perfect harmony to never step over one another, but instead get the audience ping ponging their ears from one to the other as they traded off lyrics. The English Beat gave us “Rough Rider,” “Tenderness,” “Save It For Later,” “Ranking Full Stop,” and ending with “Mirror in the Bathroom,” but they made the most of their limited time onstage. We still didn’t feel like we got enough as you could hear the sadness from fans when we realized their set was over. When it was time for our headliners, the crowd was more than excited to sing along with all their favorite UB40 songs. As the band walked on stage, I was astounded to see that UB40 is made up of 11 talented musicians. The core of the band features original members Jimmy Brown (drums), Robin Campbell (guitar), Earl Falconer (bass), Norman Lamont Hassan (percussion and trombone), and they are tied together with their vocalist, Matt Doyle, who has been with the band for three years now. Doyle’s singing style elevates the original vocals and comes across with a brightness to it and his camaraderie with the rest of the band makes it feel like he’s been performing with them for decades. The current formation of this band created an extra special moment for guitarist Robin Campbell, as his son Matt Campbell is now performing in the band as a backing vocalist. Getting to travel the world with your son and make these kinds of memories must be something sincerely cherished by both men. An aspect I loved about the show was that Doyle was not the only vocalist, as the MC Gilly G came from the backline to show off his vocal talents on many songs. But it was percussionist Norman Lamont Hasson’s lead vocals on “Johnny Too Bad” that really got the crowd excited and cheering. We even got a treat with two songs off their latest album UB45 called “Fool Me Once” and “Home.” Some of UB40’s biggest songs have been covers, so whether you were familiar with the band’s music or not, you could find yourself singing along to many of their biggest hits. They even split the set up with half the songs being covers, and the other half being originals: “Here I Am (Come and Take Me),” “Keep on Moving,” “Maybe Tomorrow,” “The Way You Do The Things You Do,” “Sing Our Own Song,” “Bring Me Your Cup,” “You Don’t Call Anymore,” “Cherry Oh Baby,” “Gimme Some Kind of Sign,” “Red Red Wine,” and even coming back for a three-song encore with “One in Ten,” “Kingston Town,” and ending with the Elvis classic, “Can’t Help Falling In Love.” I will be the first to admit I am not well versed on reggae, so walking into a show like this, I didn’t quite know what to expect. But the music was so good and so accessible that Brandon and I could frequently find ourselves dancing in the crowd and singing along with the music by the second chorus of many songs. We both found ourselves being a little emotional during this show thinking about our dads. The energy of the music and the joy and happiness of getting to have these experiences with each other. We know our dads were at this show with us. Dancing, singing, and grooving along with everyone else. And the epic tour continues, check out the UB40 website to see when they will play near you.

I mean, I did recently tear my meniscus in a mosh pit, but my roots are heavy in funk, R&B, and soul thanks to my mom’s love of Elvis, and watching “Soul Train” every Saturday morning. I spent those mornings religiously glued to the TV watching “Soul Train,” and it was there I discovered Kool & the Gang. Their song “Jungle Boogie” had me doing the “cowboy” dance, longing to be a “Soul Train” line dancer. Knowing that part of my childhood, you can understand how when I got the opportunity to catch Kool & the Gang with Morris Day & the Time at The Pacific Amphitheatre, I was ecstatic to say the least. The Pacific Amphitheatre is an iconic Orange County venue to see bands. Being an OC girl myself, I do enjoy seeing bands there thanks to the seating; no matter where you sit, you always get a good view of the stage and artists. If you enjoy animals, you will also get a glimpse of a llama, and maybe a mountain goat, grazing atop the grassy area, enjoying the tunes as well. MORRIS DAY Morris Day & the Time opened the night a little after 7 p.m. and judging by the crowd’s response, they were there to see them as much as the headliner! Everyone was up on their feet from the first song, “Cool,” right along with Morris, Jelly Roll, and the band. PACIFIC AMPHITHEATRE July 31, 2024 Costa Mesa, California Morris Day still exudes suaveness and style – he even brought out his infamous mirror to check himself – as he and the band sing and sway to his hits. As the crowd was mostly GenXers, in between songs they would sit, but that didn’t last long – each song simply made you want to join in and shake that booty, as the Time played their hits “Get it Up,” “Fishnet,” “777-9311,” “Oak Tree,” “Jungle Love,” and the most iconic song for them, “The Bird.” My inner child squealed with glee when the music started and the big screens lit up with videos of the “Soul Train” logo and dancers, with Kool & the Gang moving in sync. The video rolled through the decades, depicting a 50-year career of funk. As the video was coming to an end, the Grammy-winning band started to take the stage and once again the filled amphitheater was on their feet. Robert “Kool” Bell, the only remaining original member of the band, was on bass, longtime members (they have been with the group for multiple decades!) Michael Ray was on trumpet, Curtis “Fitz” Williams on keys, and Shawn “Shawny Mac” McQuiller was on guitar. The gentlemen started their engaging set with “Open Sesame.” The Godfathers of Funk continued with their many hits and had the whole crowd exuding the same energy that Morris Day & the Time did. It was seriously one huge party! Everyone was dancing and singing along to “Fresh,” “Misled,” “Jungle Boogie,” “Cherish,” “Ladies Night,” “Celebration,” and of course for us in Southern California, we got a special treat, “Hollywood Swinging.” It was such a fun, energetic night with the horns, the synchronicity of the bands’ moves, plus the songs that have been a part of our lives for many, many decades. I woke up the next morning still excited that I actually got to see Morris Day & the Time, and Kool & the Gang live – it was almost like a hung-over feeling, but with excitement. If you have a chance, check out these living legends – including when they perform later this year as they get inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

I received a call from our Editor-in-Chief. That in itself is not the story, but it was why he called me. He said there was a band he really liked, but felt he could not be un-biased in writing about them; he said he loves their music, and he thinks the bandmates are good people. He asked me to check them out and if I liked them, write a story on LA’s “best kept secret.” I smirked and said it sounds like it’s going to be Cinderella-like if they are that good and aren’t the next big thing. He laughed and asked me to give them a chance. I reminded him that fairytales are always draped in some kind of tragedy; a hero and a villain, and drama would always be around the corner. This possible fairytale band already has drama in their name. Please meet Drama Dolls. Photo Provided Courtesy of Drama Dolls by Andres Angulo Once upon a time there were four women who really loved music, punk rock music to be exact. Like Musketeers, they are fierce in their chosen craft. Appropriately, they come from the City of Angels – Los Angeles, California. Like most main characters in a fairytale, they had a dream of doing what they loved; for these ladies it was something as simple as playing music. Trust me, doing that is easy, but being good at it without a Fairy Godmother at the ready? Well, therein lies the challenge. The quartet features Egg. She’s a Leo, plays guitar, and sings like her hair is on fire. There’s Mama T, who is a Libra and slap the bass into submission. The Morgalorian is a Pisces who plays a wicked guitar. Then there’s Scrambles, the Taurus that bangs the drums all day. Collectively they are magical, and I rarely use that word to describe a band. Their rise to stardom took shape in early 2019; by October they put out their first digital EP, “Five.” Their debut music video was very funny, and it was just a small preview of not only their personalities, but their energy that translated to a sonic vision that cannot be denied. The lead single, “I Don’t Wanna Wait,” did well and gained the attention of the right people. Other songs that caused a ruckus were “Don’t Tell Me What to Do, Larry,” “Stop Fucking with Me,” and “All My Friends Are Freaks.” It was “I Don’t Wanna Wait,” was the bands first video that gave us the first glimpse into the minds, sonic souls and humor of Drama Dolls. Here’s the drama part: It was about the time they were making waves in the industry that a very tragic event was taking place in the world. COVID drastically affected so much – including the music industry – and bands like Drama Dolls had to wait for their day in the sun as we navigated a worldwide pandemic. But great artists find a way to make their music and Drama Dolls dropped singles throughout 2020. These tracks took their industry presence up a notch with “We Like to Party,” “Favorite Girl,” “Yes Man,” “I Hate Your Face,” and “Sometimes You Gotta Be a Bitch.” By now, the ladies displayed an attitude that was undeniable and developed a swagger. They even described themselves as being “Unapologetic alternative punk rock spreading infectious energy to audiences far and wide.” it’s their humor and social commentary you can pick up on through their music. Now let’s dive into just how good these ladies have become. Like all successful bands that have accomplished musicians, they often play with other artists. For example, Scrambles was also working with the band No Small Children. They had a single featured in the popular comedy/thriller starring Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively, “A Simple Favor,” A Paul Fieg movie, more on him later. The song, “Laisse Tomber Les Filles,” is a cover of a 1964 France Gall tune and it is not only very catchy, it is so well done, it draws you in. Swinging back to Drama Dolls, there is more happening in their camp. In July of 2023, they released a full album, “Hey Listen,” full of new material and previously released singles (make sure to check out “Horchata” and “Poof Be Gone”). Also noteworthy, Drama Dolls music is produced by Bob Marellete. If the name sounds familiar, he’s worked with Rob Zombie, Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper and Lynyrd Skynyrd, and the four ladies from LA. Drama Dolls’ music is also making it to the big screen. “Sometimes You Gotta Be a Bitch” will be featured in the upcoming movie “Jackpot” that features John Cena and Awkwafina. The film will drop August 15th on Amazon Prime, it is directed by Paul Feig; that same Paul Feig who directed “Bridesmaids,” “The Heat,” and “Spy.” The same aforementioned Paul Feig from “A Simple Favor.” As you can see, these ladies have been heard and are making waves. The word on the street is that we can expect more singles coming our way very soon. Until then what are some other barometer readers we need to consider? Holiday music can be nearly fatal for bands, but for this band turns out they can even make a holiday song fun. For anyone who says fairytales are just in the movies, pay attention to Drama Dolls because these ladies are making it happen. Make no mistake – this band has been LA’s best kept secret, but that secret is about to come out, big time. If you’re on the East Coast, you can catch them on their August Busy Beaver tour. If you are in SoCal and like your music loud and in your face with a great beat, follow this band. They will be back locally playing The Escondite in Downtown Los Angeles on August 24th. I guess if I had to describe them I would say think the Breeders meet the Go-Go’s and then they go on a date with Manic Hispanic, what could go wrong? Get ready, because this best kept secret just might be the next big thing.

Jonny “2 Bags” Wickersham may be the guitarist for punkers Social Distortion, but he keeps busy with his solo material as well. Running through his classics, Wickersham stopped in between songs to thank the crowd for coming out early saying, “I’m seeing friends out here I’ve had for 40 years!” Joining Wickersham and Salvation Town on lead guitar was Chris Masterson from The Wallflowers. Masterson made for a great addition to Wickersham’s already classic sound. Dallas’ Reverend Horton Heat brought his psychobilly sound to the stage next and earned a rousing cheer from the crowd. The audience was eager and excited, and made it known they were ready to partake in a religious ceremony, Reverend Horton Heat style! The fans were very into each song The Rev, aka Jim Heath, delivered. Some of the faves were “Baddest of the Bad,” “Psychobilly Freakout,” “Big Red Rocket,” and a Willie Nelson cover, “Three Days.” Around the end of his set, Heath said, “We got stop now. Sorry; Jimbo’s tired!” Obviously this was just a game as most people were on to it. The fans shouted back, “No! No! We want more!” It worked and Heath gave us one last song, Motörhead’s “Ace of Spades.” The crowd sang their heart out: “You know I’m born to lose, And gambling’s for fools, But that’s the way I like it, baby.” The combination of the Rev’s signature rockabilly mixes surprisingly well with Motörhead! What a fantastic set! Headliners – and Los Angeles punk icons – X walked out on stage and showed just why they are living legends. I’ve seen X many time since 1980 and the Whisky a Go Go days, and front-woman Exene Cervenka is still an icon and influence – then and now. PACIFIC AMPHITHEATRE Costa Mesa, California July 28, 2024 Billed as The End is Near tour promoting their final album, “Smoke & Fiction,” X has stated this is their last official tour. That being said, they haven’t ruled out playing shows in the future. Starting the set with “Your Phone’s Off the Hook, But You’re Not,” X tore through the classics “In This House That I Call Home,” “Because I Do,” and “Flipside,” before singer/bassist John Doe said, “Do you want to hear a new one?” A resounding “Yes!” came from the fans to which he said, “Ok, I’m relieved!” They broke into “Sweet Til the Bitter End,” the second song on the new record. Doe, Cervenka, along with drummer D. J. Bonebrake, and guitarist Billy Zoom took us through so many incredible songs: “The Hungry Wolf,” “Water & Wine,” “Smoke & Fiction,” “Ruby Church,” “Motel Room in My Bed,” and a Doors’ cover, “Soul Kitchen.” Of course there was a huge response for “Los Angeles” and “Johny Hit and Run Paulene.” Before they said a final farewell, X did an encore with “White Girl,” “Wild Thing” (a Chip Taylor cover),” and “Devil Doll.” What a phenomenal night of music with X, The Reverend Horton Heat, Jonny “2 Bags” Wickersham and Salvation Town! It was the perfect night of music to close out a fantastic weekend at the OC Fair.

Their music was way ahead of its time during their first wave of albums; you could even argue that it’s still ahead of its time and the world is still not ready to fully embrace it. This partially explains why during the 1980s they never had the huge commercial success of some of their successors. And yet, everyone from Nirvana (and later Foo Fighters), The Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, Weezer, and The Strokes – among countless others – name the Pixies as a tremendous influence. Discussing “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” Kurt Cobain was quoted as saying he was “basically trying to rip off the Pixies.” From the prolific and genius songwriting of Frank Black (aka Black Francis), the criminally underrated guitar playing of Joey Santiago, the iconic bass lines and vocals of Kim Deal, and Dave Lovering providing the solid backbeat keeping everyone in rhythm, it’s no wonder why this band basically provided the blueprint for ‘90s alternative and grunge music. Finally the Pixies started getting their recognition when all of these bands began name checking them as an influence, opening their catalogue to a whole new generation of fans long after they had disbanded in 1993. The band’s popularity got another boost in 1999 as David Fincher chose “Where is My Mind” to play during the closing credits of “Fight Club” as Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter watch buildings around them implode.’ With this new found popularity, as well as a decade passing, the band decided to reform with all four original members in 2004 with shows selling out in minutes. Since then the band has released four more albums, the last being 2022’s “Doggerel.” Deal parted ways with the band in 2013 and was soon replaced by the uber-talented Paz Lenchantin, formerly of A Perfect Circle fame. In May Lenchantin left the band, with Emma Richardson (formerly of Band of Skulls) taking up the reins. As for the latest news, the Pixies will be releasing their 10th album, “The Night the Zombies Came” on October 25th. This marks the first album Richardson will be part of, and only the second time Santiago has penned lyrics (having written a song for “Doggerel”), this time for “Hypnotized.” You can check out the lyric video for their latest single, “Chicken,” which is as bizarre as you have come to expect from the Pixies. The band is currently on a tour of Europe and the UK, with just about all shows already sold out. In November they will be heading to New Zealand and Australia with Pearl Jam, again with nearly all shows completely sold out.

As I sat in my seat and watched the crowd enter the arena, it was obvious some had come from the fair – with popcorn and stuffed animals in tow, dressed casually in their summer attire – and others were here just for the concert – several women donned glitter outfits and glamorous makeup – as they excitedly made their way to their seats. To my surprise, the crowd was a vast mix of GenX (with ‘80s band t-shirts), mid 30s, and fresh-faced teenagers, some looking like they were ready for Coachella, and others like homegrown OC surfer boys. In fact, I actually giggled seeing the surfers as they reminded me of my youthful days hanging at Huntington Beach Pier. Quinn XCII started the night and the crowd stood up as soon as he began the intro to “Georgia Peach.” Quinn sounds vaguely familiar to me; like a ‘90s boy band, but not one specific one. He was dressed casually in shorts and a t-shirt, and appeared to enjoy what he was doing. He is also proud to be from the Midwest and exudes a bit of humbleness. PACIFIC AMPHITHEATER July 24, 2024 Costa Mesa, California The crowd was really into Quinn and knew his songs. They stayed on their feet for the whole set, which in turn made me get up and dance. Quinn continued his set with “Straight Jacket,” “Always Been You,” and ends the set with “Candle” as he asks the crowd to turn on the flashlight on their phone and light up the venue in unity. When it was time for headliner Cannons, the dark stage glowed in a red haze, and the crowd was up again, a sea of cheers. The music to “Heartbeat Highway” began and the crowd exploded when they saw front-woman Michelle Joy, who looked like she was ready to walk the red carpet in her sequined, cut-out dress that highlighted her toned body. Formed in Los Angeles in 2013, the indie pop band includes Joy, guitarist Ryan Clapham, and Paul Davis on keyboards and bass. Childhood friends Clapham and Davis started the band and connected with Joy – a former cheerleader from Florida – when they answered a Craigslist ad for a singer looking for a band. Joy is engaging, full of energy the whole show, and she is a “show woman!” Every song she sings, she has her heart in it, and she doesn’t stay still as she is belting out the tunes. I saw many men in the crowd who, to my delight and surprise, spent the evening dancing as much as the women around them – even their dates. I can’t say I’ve ever been to a concert with this many men who truly enjoyed the music and dancing; not because they must impress their date, but because Michelle Joy lives up to her name! Of course the band plays the obvious hits: “Bright Lights,” “Hurricane,” and then the crowd really got involved singing along to the chorus of “Crush.” Following Quinn’s lead, Joy asked everyone to use their phones to light up the sky like an “Evening Star,” and she sang their hit with the same title. Cannons finished the set with their hit – which was also featured on Netflix’s “Never Have I Ever” – “Fire For You.” I was surprised that a LA-based band didn’t have an encore, but truthfully, a lot of people were starting to stream out during the last song, so they didn’t seem upset with the ending to the show. Everyone seemed pleased and in great spirits as they were leaving. This was such a fun show; the crowd loved both acts and was up dancing the whole time. I would definitely go check them out again, and invite my 30-something kids along. Cannons will be supporting Imagine Dragons October 26th in Los Angeles at the iconic Hollywood Bowl, so don’t miss your chance to catch the sparkle and joy!
