As of 2016, current members include Mike Herrera on lead vocals and bass guitar, Yuri Ruley on drums and percussion, Tom Wisniewski on lead guitar and backing vocals and Chris Adkins on rhythm guitar and backing vocals. The band's discography includes twelve studio albums, four EPs, four compilation albums, a live album, a VHS tape, a DVD and 20 singles. A number of the group's releases have charted on Billboard, including the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on Billboard Christian Albums.[2]\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly start (1992)[]\n\nMxPx was formed in July 1992 by Mike Herrera, Yuri Ruley, and Andy Husted, who were 15 years old at the time, and classmates at Central Kitsap High School in Silverdale, Washington. Initially, the band played music inspired by Descendents, Black Flag and other punk rock bands.\n\nThe name, originally Magnified Plaid, was a tribute to Husted's fascination with plaid shirts, but did not fit on the band's posters. Consequently, the name was abbreviated to M.P. on show posters. Yuri Ruley, who used Xs in place of periods, made the posters for the band, resulting in the four-letter moniker.[3]\n\nTooth & Nail years (1993–1997)[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"Labelled list hatnote\".\n\nMxPx caught the attention of Tooth & Nail Records when the band played a showcase for the label in 1993 in Herrera's parents' back yard. The band's first major album, Pokinatcha (1994), was released while the band members were still in high school. The album, though classified as Christian punk, incorporated the quick styles of hardcore punk,[4] and is composed of influence from skate/surf punk and punk underground. The songs are characterized by their raw punk sound, catchy rhythm, and classic punk three-chord guitar style.[5][6]\n\nGuitarist Andy Husted soon left the band and was replaced by Herrera's longtime friend, Tom Wisniewski. Despite only knowing power chords on guitar, Wisniewski was willing to be in the band. MxPx released two further albums with Tooth & Nail: Teenage Politics in 1995, and Life in General in 1996,[4] which features the single \"Chick Magnet\" and artwork by the artist Coop.[7]\n\nA&M years (1997–2004)[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"Labelled list hatnote\". MxPx received a major distribution deal with A&M Records. This deal first saw a re-release of Life in General. MxPx then released two more studio albums jointly distributed by Tooth & Nail and A&M: Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo was the first in 1998. It peaked at No. 99 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold on January 27, 2000, by the RIAA.[8] At the Show is a live album recorded by MxPx, released in 1999. At the time of the recording, the band was touring in support of Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo as well as the B-sides collection Let it Happen, also released in 1998.[9]\n\nThis was followed by The Ever Passing Moment in 2000. MxPx gained critical recognition for this album and landed a slot supporting for The Offspring and Cypress Hill on the Conspiracy of One tour.[10] \"Responsibility\" proved to be a minor radio hit, peaking at #24 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The video, which is directed by The Malloys, features the band messing around and causing mayhem while caddying at a golf course, and also includes an appearance by Cheers star George Wendt. The song was featured in the Daria Television Movie Is It Fall Yet?. After The Ever Passing Moment, the group had then fulfilled its contract obligations with Tooth & Nail and decided to part ways.[4]\n\nThe band's version of the song \"Scooby Doo, Where Are You?\" is in the soundtrack of the 2002 movie Scooby-Doo.[4] The group's studio album Before Everything & After was released by A&M in 2003.[4] The album achieved the band's highest ever chart position on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 51.[11]\n\nThe group provided the song \"The Empire\" for The Passion of the Christ: Songs, which won the Gospel Music Association 2005 Dove Award for Special Event Album of the Year.[12][13]\n\nSideOneDummy years (2005–2006)[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"Labelled list hatnote\".\n\nIn 2005 MxPx was dropped by A&M, signed with SideOneDummy Records, and the group released its seventh full-length album Panic.[4] This was a breakthrough album when the single \"Heard That Sound\" proved a minor radio hit. It also featured the Blink-182/+44 singer-bassist Mark Hoppus on \"Wrecking Hotel Rooms.\" It also leaves the pop punk sound off of the group's previous album and returns to the band's skate punk/punk rock roots.[14][15]\n\nIn September 2006, MxPx and the City of Bremerton started a marketing effort revolving around the band's song \"Move to Bremerton\". The band was given keys to the city by Mayor Cary Bozeman in recognition of the group's contributions to the city.[16][17][18][19]\n\nMxPx spent the majority of 2005 and 2006 touring in support of the band's 7th album Panic. On November 21, 2006, Tooth & Nail Records re-released \"Let It Happen\", an earlier rarities compilation, in a \"Deluxe Edition\" which included a bonus DVD featuring 12 music videos, new artwork, and two new songs. Let's Rock, MxPx's second rarities album, was released on Side One Dummy Records on October 24, 2006. The album consists of many previously unreleased songs, re-recorded B-sides and acoustic demos.[4]\n\nTooth & Nail and Rock City (2007–present)[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"Labelled list hatnote\". MxPx released the full-length album Secret Weapon in 2007, the band's first release on its original label Tooth & Nail since 1996's Life in General. The album debuted at No. 76 on the Billboard 200; it also went to No. 1 on the Billboard's Christian chart. The album's sound was a shift back to the group's original style.[20][21][22]\n\nIn 2009, the band released a six-song EP entitled Left Coast Punk EP,[23] which was the first record released by Rock City Recording Company, MxPx's own record label. Also in 2009, the group released a Christmas album, titled Punk Rawk Christmas.[24][25] In late 2009, Mike Herrera teamed up with frontman of The Ataris, Kris Roe, the drummer of The Summer Obsession, and Chris Wilson (formerly of Good Charlotte) for the MxPx All Stars tour in Japan and Malaysia.[26]\n\nThe band released a documentary entitled Both Ends Burning on December 1, 2011. In addition, Mike, Tom, and Yuri were working on their ninth studio album. On December 19, 2011, the band announced that the album would be called Plans Within Plans. It was released on April 3, 2012.[28] In 2012, drummer Yuri Ruley announced his retirement from touring. After a brief hiatus Ruley returned as a full-time member in 2015 and continues to tour with the band today.\n\nIn honor of the 20th anniversary of the album, the band released the re-recorded version of Life in General free of charge for a limited time on September 18, 2016.[29] Chris Adkins also joined as a second guitarist and touring musician in 2016.\n\nIn early 2018, the band announced a Kickstarter campaign to fund their twelfth studio album, although they advertised it as being their tenth album.[30][31] The album is titled MxPx and was released July 25, 2018. Before the release of their self-titled album, a music video for \"Let's Ride\" came out at the end of June 2018.[32] The album was performed live on Facebook on the date of its release.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band has been unable to perform live for much of 2020. On October 16, 2020, they performed a full concert via live stream. The event was titled \"Between This World and The Next.\"[33]\n\nArthur[]\n\nArthur is a side project of MxPx featuring all three members of MxPx and their former tech assistant Neil Hundt, who now techs for Good Charlotte. The group released an EP called Loneliness Is Bliss in 1999. The band members went by their middle names: Arthur (where the band name came from), Edmund, Zane, and Alexander (Mike Herrera, Tom Wisniewski, Yuri Ruley, and Neil Hundt, respectively). After over ten years since the inception of Loneliness Is Bliss, the band released a full-length album called Watch the Years Crawl By on December 7, 2010.[34] In 2013 those involved in the project announced that they would be discontinuing the project.[34]\n\nMusical style and influences[]\n\nMxPx is usually described as a pop punk band,[35][36][4] but has also been labeled as skate punk[37][38] and punk rock.[37][39][40] Originally a punk rock band, by the rise of popularity of pop punk in the late 1990s and early 2000s the group leaned more towards a more pop punk sound.[41] Albums like The Ever Passing Moment and Before Everything and After were criticized by some fans for its pop punk style.[1] MxPx's influences include Descendents, NOFX, Bad Religion, Rancid, Social Distortion, All, the Clash, the Dead Milkmen, The Who, Sex Pistols, Black Flag, and the Ramones.[42][43][44][45][46][47]\n\nMany of the band's early releases touch on Christian themes[48][49][50] and placed them in the front of the Christian punk scene.[51][52][53] However, by 2012, \"Christian punk\" was a genre classification that the band was trying to distance themselves from.[54] As of 2015, MxPx singer Mike Herrera has said he is no longer Christian. When asked about the topic he stated \"...do I believe in god? I'm not sure. Do I believe in this exact religion? No I don't.\"[55]\n\nBand members[]\n\nTemplate:BLP unsourced section Current members\n\nMike Herrera – lead vocals, bass guitar (1992–present)\n\nYuri Ruley – drums, percussion (1992–2010, 2012-present)\n\nTom Wisniewski – lead guitar, backing vocals (1995–present)\n\nChris Adkins – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2016–present)\n\nFormer members\n\nAndy Husted – lead guitar (1992–1995)\n\nDiscography[]\n\nTemplate:Main article\n\nPokinatcha (1994)\n\nTeenage Politics (1995)\n\nLife in General (1996)\n\nSlowly Going the Way of the Buffalo (1998)\n\nThe Ever Passing Moment (2000)\n\nBefore Everything & After (2003)\n\nPanic (2005)\n\nSecret Weapon (2007)\n\nOn the Cover II (2009)\n\nPunk Rawk Christmas (2009)\n\nPlans Within Plans (2012)\n\nMxPx (2018)\n\nLife in Quarantine (2020)\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"Side box\".\n\nScript error: No such module \"Official website\".Script error: No such module \"Check for unknown parameters\".\n\nTemplate:MxPx"
