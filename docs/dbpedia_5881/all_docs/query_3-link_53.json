        "text": "Note: This article was originally written in November-December 2013 as a serialized, ten-part feature. This post compiles all ten of the original articles into a single piece, running in the proper chronological order (e.g. the conclusion is at the bottom, not the top, as happens in blogs) to help avoid spoilers if you weren’t reading along with the original posts in real time. This version of the article preserves structural relics from the original series in noting things like “yesterday we did . . . ” or “tomorrow we will . . . ” and with re-introductions of each of the sections, so hopefully those aren’t a distraction. The entire piece is copyright 2013, J. Eric Smith, and should not be reproduced in digital or print formats without the author’s specific authorization, and proper attribution back to this website.\n\nPART ONE: FRAMING THE SCENE\n\nMuch of my internet notoriety (such as it is) stems from a series of articles that I wrote in the early 2000s that took interesting musical questions, and used them to frame NCAA-style, head-to-head tournaments, pitting records or artists against each other over a long series of blog posts to (in theory) reach arguably definitive answers to the questions posed.\n\nThe first one I did was called The Worst Rock Band Ever, and it ran in 2004, and generated no small amount of online fire. It blew up globally before we even had a settled term for web virality, and I still get hate mail from it. When that was over, I felt somewhat bad about wallowing in awfulness for as long as it took to produce the piece, so the next one I did evaluated a more enlightening scenario — the best band that few people have ever heard of — in a series called Beneath the Radar: Rock’s Greatest Secret Bands. Then, once again, I pivoted and evaluated Best of the Blockbusters: The Greatest (Popular) Record Ever, which sought to identify the highest quality album among the 64 most purchased records in history. I started a series called Slaughtering the Sacred Cows, designed to pick the most over-rated albums in rock history, but I aborted that one, since I decided that I knew what the likely answers were going to be before I wrote it, and I didn’t want to spend two weeks getting there. Then I took on a real labor of love: a 26,000-word essay called March of the Mellotrons: The Best Classic Progressive Rock Album Ever. That’s the defining gem of the bunch, if I say so myself. (After the fact editorial note: I later added Let’s Take It to the Stage: The Greatest Live Album Ever, as a collaborative tournament with two fellow music nerds).\n\nIn 2005, I decided that the next series I should run would be called “Great Out the Gate,” and it would analyze the 64 best debut albums ever, seeking to identify the greatest of the bunch. I spent a lot of time crafting the field of 64, incorporating input from two online communities in which I was active at the time, Upstate Wasted and the Xnet2 Liste. I finally came up with what felt like a good list . . . but just as I was about to start writing the series, I decided to take a blogging sabbatical instead, and the list of 64 albums went onto the back burner, where it has been sitting for the better part of a decade.\n\nThis week, though, I took that old list out, updated a few items, and plan to grind through a new list of 64 in the week(s) ahead to pick a best debut album ever.\n\nWhat made me resuscitate this old and abandoned piece? The fact that Rolling Stone recently did a “Best Debut Album Ever” feature on their website, and badly botched the job, naming the dire Licensed to Ill by The Beastie Boys as the greatest debut album ever. No freakin’ way!!!! Here’s what I think about the Beastie Boys (with all due appropriate respects to their recently fallen member, whichever one he was, as I am sure he was a very nice man, when he wasn’t hurting childrens’ ears by singing at them).\n\nSo I have a list of 64 contenders for the best debut album ever, and you know what? There’s not a Beastie Boys record in the mix. Before I give it to you, though, I need to lay down the ground rules used to select the opening list, so you know why I and my collaborators included or (more likely) excluded your favorite record(s):\n\nOnly long play albums are considered. No debut EPs, no debut singles.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame sets a “25 year after debut album rule” for qualification, and I and my Xnet2 colleagues modified that slightly to set a 20-year rule: until your album has been proven to have legs over two decades, you don’t deserve to be considered “best ever.” So nothing released after 1993 makes this list, as much as it pained me to drop Korn (1994) from the pool. I think this is also fitting because 1993 marks a period of time when changes in radio programming philosophy and the emergence of digital playback devices fundamentally altered the way that many people perceive and play albums as singular entities, rather than collections of songs. This is not to say that grand music and grand debuts are not still being made: if you want to know which debuts I find the most compelling from 1993 to now, see the lists linked from here (1992 to 2011) and here (2012). My last two “Albums of the Year” (Planningtorock’s W and Goat’s World Music) were both debuts, but I’m not ready to pit them against The Velvet Underground and Nico or Never Mind the Bollocks or Enter the Wu-Tang or anything else in this list as great releases for the ages.\n\nAs a general rule, a debut release had to be conceived as an album by the artist, not as a collection of singles put together with some filler by a record label. Admittedly, two of the early essential albums cited below (Elvis Presley and The Beatles’ Please Please Me) were bypassed through this particularly filter, largely because their nominal filler tracks are as good as the A-sides that most of their peers were releasing at the time. Somewhat arbitrarily (but no less authoritatively), we also decided that Bob Dylan’s and the Rolling Stones’ debut albums did not meet that “more than just a collection of songs” criteria. Because that’s how we roll here, the end.\n\nA debut release had to have a real impact: commercially, critically or creatively, there had to be some buzz and heat around its creation, and it should be regularly cited as an inspiration for groups that follow. And it should have some legs, too. Get the Knack and Foreigner were monster sellers out of the gate that spawned big radio hits, but nobody much cites them as musical landmarks all these years later, and neither group ever evolved much beyond what they were on day one, nor creatively influenced many people who followed.\n\nThe cited debut should be one of the creating group’s better records, if not the best. If a group really made it’s mark with a later release (Nirvana’s Nevermind, for instance), their long-playing debut (Bleach, in this case) generally won’t make the cut, even if it is pretty good. Which Bleach isn’t, just for the record.\n\nSupergroups with pre-built-in buzz (Emerson Lake and Palmer, Crosby Stills and Nash, Cream, Asia, Derek and the Dominoes and suchlike) don’t qualify. We wanted the impact of surprise. A debut is not really a debut if it has already sold two million copies before it ships to stores due to the band members’ prior famous careers.\n\nThe debut long playing record generally had to be the record that made the band in its audience’s and critics’ mind. For instance, bands like the Minutemen, Bauhaus, Black Flag, Tool, Clutch, Mission of Burma and Pavement didn’t make the list because their first LPs came well after definitive standalone EPs and singles that do not reappear on their debut albums had really gotten people interested in them already.\n\nFor solo artists emerging from bands, there has to be a clear difference between the work of the band and the work of the solo artist. Bob Pollard coming out of Guided By Voices would not qualify, since he is Guided By Voices, for all practical intents and purposes. Brian Eno coming out of Roxy Music, on the other hand, would qualify. (Though Roxy Music themselves didn’t make the cut, since their debut album was badly recorded and paled in importance when placed against their early singles, most especially “Virginia Plain.”)\n\n64 albums have been chosen for consideration. While I made the final call on which 64 made it, this list was developed far more collaboratively than any other ones I’ve done, with extensive suggestions, feedback and discussion via the aforementioned musical communities in which I am (or was) involved.\n\nThe 64 albums were sorted chronologically, oldest to newest. The list was then cut in half, with #33 (chronologically) going up against #1 on the calendar, then #34 vs #2, etc. As it turns out, this puts the masters of the early rock era against the masters of the punk revolution, and then some of those class of ’77 bands against the early hip-hop pioneers, which seems fitting, since those are arguably the three most important musical revolutions of the past half century in popular music. At each round until the final four, the list will be sorted and parsed this way again to set subsequent competitions.\n\nWhen we get to the final four, all four of the records will go head to head against each of the others in a round robin format. Two points awarded to a winning album, zero to a losing album, one point each in the case of a tie. The record with the most points after the round robin is declared the victor. In the event of a tie, a track-by-track analysis will be conducted.\n\nAs is the case with all of these sorts of essays, the opinions expressed in the reviews and commentary are mine. Yes, they are subjective. All music criticism is subjective. If I don’t pick an album you like, it doesn’t mean I think you are stupid or that I hate your group or you. I welcome and will respond to feedback of all varieties except this one: “Dude . . . [my favorite record] is awesome. You suck.” You can do better than that, right? Right.\n\nOkay . . . those rules covered, here are the contenders in their 32 initial head-to-head pairings:\n\nElvis Presley, Elvis Presley, (1956) vs. The Sex Pistols, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols, (1977)\n\nThe Beatles, Please Please Me, (1963) vs. Television, Marquee Moon, (1977)\n\nThe Byrds, Mr. Tambourine Man, (1965) vs. Wire, Pink Flag, (1977)\n\nMothers of Invention, Freak Out, (1966) vs. Richard Hell & The Voidoids, Blank Generation, (1977)\n\nLove, Love, (1966) vs. The Clash, The Clash, (1977)\n\nBuffalo Springfield, Buffalo Springfield, (1966) vs. Van Halen, Van Halen, (1978)\n\nThe Doors, The Doors, (1967) vs. The Police, Outlandos D’Amour, (1978)\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience, Are You Experienced?, (1967) vs. Devo, Q: Are We Not Men?

This one is going to be a tough slog, on some plane, because there are no patsies on this list, unlike some of the other analyses I conducted. So it may be ugly, but it should be fun. Stay tuned!\n\nPART TWO: THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE FIRST ROUND\n\nSo shall we kick this thing off and get going with the reviews? Yes, I believe we shall . . . as today I am going to try to get through eight of the 32 first-round contests on the road to “Greatest Out of the Gate.” Eight of these mini-essays are about as many as I can typically stand to do at a single sitting, so it’ll probably take four posts to get through the first round, two posts to get through the second, one to get through the Sweet Sixteen, and then it can start to accelerate from there, if I have the time to write. So probably a couple of weeks, soup to nuts, if all goes well. And without further ado, let’s start winnowing the herd . . .\n\nElvis Presley, Elvis Presley (1956) vs. The Sex Pistols, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols (1977): As noted in the intros, there are no patsies in this tournament, and we open with a head to head contest against arguably the bellwether albums of both the rock and roll era and its radical reinvention during punk’s reboot of the same. Both of these albums feature iconic cover images that have been widely parodied or imitated over the years. Both acts were highly divisive, often censored, and largely sniffed at by the musical powers that had been before them, but both found fervent audiences, and inspired countless other young people to embrace the power of three chords and a beat. Both Elvis Presley and Never Mind the Bollocks were highly anticipated in their home markets due to the impact of mass media: Elvis has garnered national attention through a series of appearances on the Dorsey Brothers Stage Show; the Sex Pistols, under the tutelage of skilled provocateur Malcolm McLaren, had deftly used radio, television and print media to raise both hackles and curiosity. Elvis’ debut was before my time, so I can’t attest first-hand to its impact, but I certainly remember living in the New York metropolitan area, desperately scanning the music trades to get a sense of what this “punk rock” thing looked and sounded like. Interestingly enough, once I actually got Never Mind the Bollocks, I realized that it sounded very little like what the Sex Pistols sounded like in the live snippets I’d caught on television. The recorded version of the Sex Pistols featured a veritable orchestra of over-dubbed mass guitars and basses (both played by Steve Jones, under engineer Chris Thomas’ direction) with Johnny Rotten’s spiky, spat vocal lines crisp and clear atop all of the riffage and roughage. And this, ultimately, is what makes me lean toward the Sex Pistols over Elvis in the first match of this contest: Elvis basically popped into the studio, did what he did live, caught it on tape, and off it went to the presses. We can wax effusive over the magic of early microphones or the sonic qualities of those classic Sun and RCA Record studios, but there’s not really a whole lot of production and engineering skill demonstrated on these early hits. Elvis was a product fully formed, and his debut album presents him, as he was. Never Mind the Bollocks takes a shambolic something clearly constructed to provoke, and pulls something magical out of the mess, something capable of inspiring even as it offends. The Better Debut Album: The Sex Pistols, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols (1977)\n\nThe Beatles, Please Please Me (1963) vs. Television, Marquee Moon (1977): Sure, Parlophone rushed Please Please Me onto the market to capitalize on the explosion of Beatlemania following the release of its title single and “Love Me Do.” And, yes, six of the album’s 14 songs (in its original U.K. edition) were covers of either classic rhythm and blues numbers, or cuts by polished professional songwriters (Carole King and Burt Bacharach among them), all well and enthusiastically played, but none really inspirational (with the possible exception of the John Lennon-helmed “Twist and Shout.”) And, absolutely, the Beatles public persona was as carefully, crassly conceived and managed at this stage in their career development as the Sex Pistols’ career was under Malcolm McLaren’s heavy guiding hand during their first (and last) year in the sun. But, boy, then there are those eight songs that Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote themselves, and the fact that the four Beatles played most of the instruments and sang most of the vocals on their own album, and that changed the way that music was made and marketed, forever. The Beatles were smart, sure, and they assimilated and incorporated from a variety of disparate literary and musical sources, but at the ultimate bottom line, on their debut album, they made a joyous, raucous, accessible, short and punchy noise, so universally liked that it’s almost a cliche when you encounter one of those “I don’t like the Beatles” people, who want to be different, just like all of the other “I don’t like the Beatles” people. On their debut album, New York’s Television went a different direction: Marquee Moon and its precursor single “Little Johnny Jewel” are defined by longer, solo-filled, complicated, angular songs, filled with evocative lyrics inspired by 19th Century Frenchmen, all exquisitely conceived and executed, but ultimately somehow off-putting, perhaps intentionally so. A Beatles lyric: “I saw her standing there!” A Television lyric: “There stood another person.” Similar words, but which one moves you most urgently? Exactly. The Better Debut Album: The Beatles, Please Please Me (1963)\n\nThe Byrds, Mr. Tambourine Man (1965) vs. Wire, Pink Flag (1977): The title track, and lead single, from the Byrds’ debut album is very much a product of its time: put a band together, find a Bob Dylan song, hire Terry Melcher to produce, get the Wrecking Crew to lay down your backing tracks, and sing tight three-part vocal harmony on top of it all. What made “Mr. Tambourine Man” sound so different from other similar studio products, then and now, was Jim (later Roger) McGuinn’s distinctive twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar, the only Byrd-played instrument allowed on the cut. (Note: If you describe the sound of this guitar as “jangling,” then I get to punch you in the head). By the time the group went into the studio to record the full album, Melcher had decided they could play their own instruments, though he only let them write five of the album’s original twelve cuts, and most of the songs that people remember from this album are ones penned by Dylan. It sounds gorgeous, sure, but it feels a bit more like a throwback to the studio machine days of yore than like the hippie revolution it presaged. Wire’s Pink Flag, on the other hand, was almost uniformly forward-looking: while they earned their early trips to stages and studios under the punk umbrella, by the time Pink Flag was released, they’d eschewed a lot of the trappings and topicality of punk (though Colin Newman still sang in the expected snotty voice), slowed down some of the tempos, and created fractured, minimalist songs that had virtually nothing to do with anything that came before them. “Three Girl Rhumba” and “Mannequin” demonstrate a particularly striking level of creative vision and execution, far ahead of virtually any of Wire’s punk peers, then or now. Wire’s producer, Mike Thorne, was an integral part of the group’s studio existence through their first three albums, and he did not make them play Bob Dylan songs, nor suggest that Larry Knechtel might be better at that bass part than Graham Lewis, what say we give that a try, fellas, huh? Plus, David Crosby was never a member of Wire, so that’s to their favor too. The Better Debut Album: Wire, Pink Flag (1977)\n\nMothers of Invention, Freak Out! (1966) vs. Richard Hell & The Voidoids, Blank Generation (1977): These seemingly disparate albums share one important, common trait: they reflect a point where their songwriters took a look at the world around them, right then, right where they were, and decided that they didn’t like it very much, at all. On the Mothers’ album, Frank Zappa’s sneered at California cool, Hollywood, Haight, advertising, hippies, suburbia, car culture, commerce. With the Voidoids, Richard Hell took a somewhat cooler, hipper, more French-poetry inspired view (he was in the original line-up of Television, after all), though he oozed just as much disapproval as Zappa did when he looked at the world on his stoop: junkies, urban blight, whores, vacant lots, trains, perpetual dives. Hell carried a commitment to intricate two-guitar interplay out of his time in Television, and Robert Quine and Ivan Julian make up one of the most improbably exceptional guitar tag-teams in rock and roll history, with just the perfect balance of abandon and skill, release and restraint, brutality and beauty. Like Wire’s Pink Flag, Blank Generation is largely composed of short, sharp shocks, with the exception of the stretched-out “Another World,” which takes up about 20% of the album’s sub-40 minute run time. The Mothers’ Freak Out!, on the other hand, was one of the very first double rock albums issued, running at just over a hour. Which seemed like a long time, then, even though that’s a short compact disc in these bloated days when bands often feel that more is more, even though more is less, most of the time. And that’s the case here too: there’s a load of brilliance on Freak Out! and many of the themes and styles that Zappa and his incredible cast of collaborators would pursue over the ensuing decades are here, in nascent form, but Side Four’s “The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet (Unfinished Ballet in Two Tableau),” with its sub-movements “Ritual Dance of the Child Killers” and “Nullis Pretii (No Commercial Potential),” really cause the album to end more in a “wore out its welcome” mode than with a feeling of triumphant accomplishment. Plus, Blank Generation is easily the best thing in Richard Hell’s relatively limited canon, while Freak Out! is nowhere close to the greatness that Zappa would ultimately attain. Game, set, match . . . on a broken television in an empty lot with a needle sticking out of its side, as a train goes by. Blankly. The Better Debut Album: Richard Hell & The Voidoids, Blank Generation (1977)\n\nLove, Love (1966) vs. The Clash, The Clash (1977): Our prior contest pitted pre-Summer of Love California against New York’s Lower East Side at the height of the Punk Era. This head-to-head finds one contender from that same mellow season in California, with the other representing yet another concussion from the punk explosion, one spawned by four chaps whose feet in modern times did walk upon London’s grey and unpleasant lands. Because they’re English, you see. Right. The Clash’s debut album has a messy release history; it was not issued in the U.S. at the time of its original 1977 release, sold well as a high-priced import, then was put out in the States in ’79 with a different collection of songs, after the Clash’s inferior sophomore slab, Give ‘Em More Rope, served as the first readily-accessible record of Clashdom in the Sam Goody’s and Records Bars of the day. In the U.K. though, the album was highly anticipated, sold well, and was critically acclaimed. Its incorporation of reggae styles and songs was hugely influential, as the emergence soon thereafter of the 2 Tone ska revival, and that movement’s ties to political punk, made clear. Where many of the early English punk bands’ politics were of the generic “down with the man” variety, the Clash’s targets were topical, specific, and very effectively skewered. This is a great disc, at bottom line, and it’s somewhat remarkable that they were able to produce an even greater one on this template two years later with London Calling (which, for the record, has an album cover inspired by that first Elvis album we talked about above). What’s nice about The Clash is that when you listen to it side by side with the later London Calling, the newer album doesn’t make the debut sound half-formed. You can hear that they are cut from the cloth, with the latter album just sewed into a larger, sharper suit. That’s not the case with Love’s self-titled debut album. It’s good, for sure, and a lot of the key elements of the band’s later greatness are in place: Arthur Lee was a visionary songwriter and arranger with an awesome voice, and the classic era Love line-up has got chops to spare, and deploys them across a wide variety of song styles and structures. But when you listen to Love side by side with the better known (and better) Forever Changes from 1967, it’s clear that this debut disc was simply an embryonic form of something that didn’t grow to full form until its creators had three albums under their belt. And that makes it hard for me to get excited about this particular debut album, where The Clash still invigorates me, even from deep within the penumbra of London Calling‘s formidable shadow. The Better Debut Album: The Clash, The Clash (1977)\n\nBuffalo Springfield, Buffalo Springfield (1966) vs. Van Halen, Van Halen (1978): Buffalo Springfield (the band) have spawned an incredible family tree of incredible musicians collaborating in an incredible number of configurations over the years, some of them involving David Crosby, but that happens later, so we can’t hold it against them here. Much. The line-up that appears on their self-titled debut album (Neil Young, Stephen Stills, Richie Furay, Bruce Palmer and Dewey Martin) had a reputation for fiery live shows, largely built on the ferocious interplay between the Mercurial, egomaniacal geniuses Young and Stills. Unfortunately, you don’t get much of that on their debut album, which finds the focus shifted to pretty harmonies (and, boy, they really, truly are gorgeous) and early country-rock crossover numbers of the sort that Furay would truly make his own with Poco, after he split from the Springfield with fellow traveler Jim Messina. Buffalo Springfield had a great hit song, “For What It’s Worth,” the year their debut came out, though it wasn’t actually on the album in its original configuration, but instead had to be grafted on after the fact in a rushed reissue. By all accounts, the members of Buffalo Springfield themselves were disappointed by this album, so that’s not a strong endorsement of it, despite the long reach it has maintained down the years through the knotted family tree it spawned. Van Halen’s debut, on the other hand, radically changed the way that a whole generation of players approached the electric guitar, with the two minute instrumental “Eruption” inspiring legions of teenage boys (mostly, Marnie Stern notwithstanding) to widdle and widdle and widdle away with abandon at the music store, desperately seeking sustain. Van Halen‘s album cover finds the quartet rocking out big like rock stars, even though they weren’t, yet, and they had a logo that looked great if you carved it into a school desk. Their debut has got plenty of bad attitude to spare, introduces their trademark pulsing bass and drum beat (you know it . . . you can just go “Womp! Womp! Womp! Womp!” at regular intervals in any Van Halen song, and it works), and instead of stopping, children, to figure out what that sound is, David Lee Roth is freakin’ RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL!!! I’m sold. The Better Debut Album: Van Halen, Van Halen (1978)\n\nThe Doors, The Doors (1967) vs. The Police, Outlandos D’Amour (1978): Do you remember back in the days before anybody knew just how much of a tool Sting really is? Yeah, I know it’s hard to believe, but it’s true! When Outlandos D’Amour first came out, it seemed at first to be a nice progression further down that jazzy-punky-reggae path that the Clash had first mapped on their own debut, and after a bit of a false marketing start, the album actually became popular on both side of the Atlantic, with “RAAAAAAAAACK-SAN” quickly entering the greater cultural vernacular as one of those words and voices that anybody can say, and everybody else will know where it comes from. (Eddie Murphy’s a capella with a Walkman rendition from 48 Hrs is probably the best example of this, of course, though I think Eddie was probably tapping a cultural meme that had already galloped out of the barn at that point, rather than making an original creative statement). And even before we got to see Sting all buff and sleek in a winged codpiece in David Lynch’s Dune, he and his two band mates certainly had that perky, edgy, spiky blonde thing going great guns on their broody album cover shot, which features what appears to be an electric exclamation point popping out of Andy Summers’ head, unbidden. Of course, we know that this was all well-machined styling, since Summers was actually much older than the group’s target audience and had once played with the Soft Machine (among others of a decidedly non-punk provenance), and drummer Stewart Copeland was the scion of a wealthy family of spies and record company executives, and Sting was a master of tantric sex who hoped the Russians loved their children too. Oh, did we mention that there’s a creepy piece called “Sally” about a blow-up doll, and it’s no “In Every Dream Home, A Heartache”? Do we need to? Can any of this compete with all the sexy baritone and swirly organ and electric sitar and poetry, man, not lyrics, and brushed cymbals and ticky-tock snares and all the other madness that was the Doors first album? C’mon baby, let’s light Jimbo’s fire and break on through to the other side, since this is the end for the Police. No appeal. No parole. And put your shirt back on, Sting. Nobody wants to look at that. Thank you. The Better Debut Album: The Doors, The Doors (1967)\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience, Are You Experienced? (1967) vs. Devo, Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! (1978): Most music geeks (is anybody reading this deep into this article who would not claim to be one?) can cite defining moments in their listening experiences, when they heard or saw or heard and saw things that fundamentally re-wired their brains with regard to how they (okay, we) perceive music. For me, the first time I heard Robert Fripp’s guitar solo on Brian Eno’s “Baby’s on Fire,” somewhere on Long Island, on then-progressive rock radio station WLIR (progressive did not mean then what it means now, by the way) was probably my own most amazing, a-ha moment as a music lover, and my subsequent record collection reflects the huge influence that both Fripp and Eno and so many of their collaborators have had on my listening habits over the years. (Though, for the record, at the time it was kind of embarrassing that in order to get “Baby’s on Fire,” I had to go buy Eno’s Here Come the Warm Jets at a suburban mall chain record store, where a slightly older, sort of slutty looking female cashier gazed at me with open derision, gum smacking loudly, as she rang up my purchase; click the link if you don’t know what the album cover looks like). But anyway, this piece is not about Eno (we get to him later), it is about Hendrix and Devo, and I can tell you about the second most influential moment in my life as a listener, another point where everything changed for me, for the better. It occurred when Devo appeared on Saturday Night Live in October, 1978 to play “Jocko Homo” and “Satisfaction.”I was horrified and fascinated, in equal measure, and I still think these are among the greatest live music performances I have ever seen, by anybody, anywhere. And then we get back to Eno: imagine my delight when I learned that the creator of “Baby’s On Fire” was also the producer of Devo’s debut album, Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! I hoovered it up quickly, and fell in love with its bizarre instrumentation, catchy (but hellaciously weird) songs, and the perverse worldview embodied in the concept of “devolution.” As I did research in those pre-Internet days (Readers Guide to Periodic Literature on microfilm, anybody?), I learned that Devo had been diligently practicing their highly eccentric fare in the post-industrial wastelands between Akron and Cleveland, Ohio since the early 1970s, and that they had ties to the Kent State shootings (!) and James Gang guitarist Joe Walsh (!!). When I listened to them, I truly had the feeling that I was looking decades ahead into the history of music, and that I was an early part of something very, very important, musically, socially, culturally, holistically. Oh, what’s that you say? What about Hendrix? Well, my introduction to him was when I went to see a late-night screening of Jimi Plays Berkeley at the Uniondale Mini Cinema on Long Island. As it turns out, I got to touch a girl’s boobs that night, in the back row, while Hendrix did his thing onscreen. Ummmmmmmmmm . . . . The Better Debut Album: The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Are You Experienced? (1967)\n\nOkay, so there you go, eight contests down, twenty-four to go in the first round, huttah! (You thought I was going to pick Devo, didn’t you?)(Go ahead, tell the truth . . . you were getting all puffed up with righteous indignation, planning your scathing comments, plotting the witty repartee with which you would skewer me . . . come on . . . admit it . . . you know you were). The following eight albums move on to the second round, though I cannot tell you what they will compete against, until we complete the entire field of 32. See you in a day or two, for the second quarter of the first round. Happy listening!\n\nThe Beatles, Please Please Me (1963)\n\nThe Doors, The Doors (1967)\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience, Are You Experienced? (1967)\n\nThe Sex Pistols, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols (1977)\n\nThe Clash, The Clash (1977)\n\nRichard Hell & The Voidoids, Blank Generation (1977)\n\nWire, Pink Flag (1977)\n\nVan Halen, Van Halen (1978)\n\nPART THREE: SECOND QUARTER OF THE FIRST ROUND\n\nZoom, zoom, zoom . . . let’s keep rolling on the road toward the best debut album ever! Today I will work through the second eight contests of the original 32 head-to-heads, and when I am done, half of the second round will be populated. Ready, steady . . . go!\n\nBonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Gorilla (1967) vs. Dire Straits, Dire Straits (1978): Before their debut album hit the racks, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band’s shambolic, frenetic, big band vaudeville act (see this 1966 clip of “Won’t You Come Home, Bill Bailey?” for a benchmark) had earned them friends in high places: they were cast as regulars on the popular U.K. television show Do Not Adjust Your Set (along with pre-Monty Pythons Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin), and Paul McCartney had invited them to perform their original number, “Death Cab for Cutie,” in the woefully misconceived Magical Mystery Tour television special. With a stripper onstage, no less, and front-man nutter Vivian Stanshall providing one of the most quintessentially pure versions of Vegas Lounge Lizard Sleaze ever captured on vinyl or film. “Death Cab” appears on the Bonzo’s debut disc, Gorilla, along with a delightful mix of originals by Stanshall and Neil Innes (who later earned additional cult fame for his work with Monty Python and The Rutles), and some truly disrespectful deconstructions of such then canon classics as “I Left My Heart in San Francisco” and “The Sound of Music.” The band had tightened considerably by this point, shedding extraneous horn players and percussionists, with Stanshall and Innes being joined by “Legs” Larry Smith, Rodney Slater and Roger Ruskin Spear as the core creative entity for the remainder of their unfortunately brief original run. But Stanshall and Smith were all over the place during the early ’70s, performing on loads of other people’s records, and being scenesters and bon vivants par excellence. “Cool Britannia” and “The Intro and the Outro” remain fresh to this day as perfect nuggets of jazz flavored weirdness, with Stanshall ever perfect in his role as (seemingly) straight man narrator above the frenzy around him. Gorilla (“Dedicated to Kong, who must have been a smashing bloke”) doesn’t much sound like anybody or anything else not named Bonzo, and it finds the sweet spot where their jazz and rock influences mingled most effectively, with rock taking the lead on later discs, after the McCartney-produced, Innes-penned “I’m the Urban Spaceman” became a big hit in ’68. When Dire Straits’ debut album came out a decade later, reviews often evoked its vibe with references to jazz clubs and other noir elements (the hit single “Sultans of Swing” certainly helped evoke such images), but this was cool jazz, not hot, with Mark Knopfler’s exquisite guitar work serving as the most engaging and memorable element on many of the disc’s songs. The Bonzos’ Gorilla features a song called “Jazz (Delicious Hot, Disgusting Cold)”. While I certainly wouldn’t go so far as to call the cool Dire Straits disgusting in any way, shape or form, I can clearly tell you that it is not as delicious as a hot Gorilla. The Better Debut Album: Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Gorilla (1967)\n\nCaptain Beefheart and His Magic Band, Safe as Milk (1967) vs. Pere Ubu, The Modern Dance (1978): Now this is an interesting contest, in terms of how we must consider cause and effect when evaluating albums from different eras that might have influenced each other. Pere Ubu’s stalwart frontman and visionary David Thomas is often cited as holding Captain Beefheart and Frank Zappa as key role models and inspirations during his formative years as a performer; in Clinton Heylin’s From the Velvets to the Voidoids, in fact, Thomas notes that Zappa’s Hot Rats and Uncle Meat and Captain Beefheart’s Trout Mask Replica were the first three albums he ever purchased. Thomas’ love for such wildly experimental fare contributed to the demise of his original band, Rocket from the Tombs: the rockers from the Rockets went on to form the punkier Dead Boys, while the weirdos in the group founded the arty Pere Ubu. At their artiest, though, even Ubu would be hard-pressed to hold a candle to that shining pinnacle of magical, musical weirdness, Trout Mask Replica, one of the most argued over albums in rock history, either a brilliant masterstroke or a masturbatory mess, or maybe both, depending on where you view it from. But Trout Mask was two years and many members removed from Beefheart’s 1967 debut, Safe as Milk; only Beeheart and drummer/arranger John French appear on both discs. While Safe as Milk is a great blues-based record featuring some hot licks from a young Ry Cooder, there are really only two songs that would generally be called “Beefheartian” in the sense that people would understand that adjective, post-Trout Mask: “Electricity” and “Abba Zaba.” Ubu’s The Modern Dance, on the other hand, is about as “Ubuesque” as you can get: its opening aural impression is of Allen Ravenstine’s squealing EML Synthesizer, which wails on like a old fax machine trying to connect down a bad phone line for far longer than is comfortable, before being joined by the loping rhythms created by Scott Krauss, Tony Maimone and Tom Herman, and Thomas’ instantly recognizable warble. It’s a better record than Safe as Milk, at bottom line, even if Safe as Milk had to happen for it to exist. Ubu got it right out of the box. It took Beefheart longer to get there. Sometimes the students surpass their masters. The Better Debut Album: Pere Ubu, The Modern Dance (1978)\n\nPink Floyd, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967) vs. The Cars, The Cars (1978): It has seemingly always been cool to love The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and to embrace the legendary, fractured genius of Syd Barrett, which pours out most lucidly on Pink Floyd’s debut album, the only one where he appears prominently. (By the time of the group’s sophomore disc, A Saucerful of Secrets, David Gilmour had joined to provide vocals and guitars as Barrett became more erratic, leaving Syd as essentially a guest cameo performer on three tracks, only one of which he wrote). As best I can remember, it has virtually never been cool to love The Cars, even though their album and the surprisingly deep series of hit singles that it spawned were absolutely ubiquitous on radio for the better part of two years as the Seventies wound to a close. The Cars were one of those groups that sounded great, and didn’t offend sensibilities, though very few people would have gone out of their ways to brag about having their debut album in their record collections, even though lots of them did. The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, on the other hand, would be a record that you’d readily pull off the shelf and show off to demonstrate your critical cred, ideally in front of impressionable members of the opposite sex. Piper makes you look cool, even as it offers a hodge-podge of sounds, both musical and non, ranging from the raging experimental guitar freakout of “Interstellar Overdrive” to the twee, childish sing-song of “Bike” and its mechanical clockwork closing sequence. There are brilliant bits, for sure, but also some dross, and early singles “Arnold Layne” and “See Emily Play” were not among the original track listings; the latter cut was added to the U.S. edition, replacing the clearly superior “Astonomy Domine.” The Cars, to compare and contrast, is slick and consistent: pretty much every song has the same great sonic sheen, and even having two lead vocalists (Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr) doesn’t make that much of a difference, since it was hard to tell them apart until you listened to their songs side by side. Which you rarely did, since you mainly heard them on the radio, singing along when you didn’t think anybody was paying attention, lest the Piper kids look up from their Dungeons & Dragons game in the school cafeteria to ooze disapproval at you. As you can probably tell, the iconoclast in me wants to challenge the unassailable mythology of look-back bore favorite Piper: it’s not Pink Floyd’s greatest album, the lyrics are almost universally dreadful (I can’t make it through the puerile “The Gnome”), it sounds very dated and of its time, and Syd’s genius is, I think, tragically over-stated in terms of what actually happens on this record vs what he did before it (scintillating, charismatic live performances) and after it (madness and isolation). We pity him, and we over-inflate the value of his limited recorded work as a result. But, sigh, I just can’t bring myself to credibly advance The Cars over The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, no matter how good The Cars sounded on Seventies rock radio, oftentimes side by side with superior later Gilmour-fronted Pink Floyd cuts. I guess that’s just what you needed, right, Grimble Crumble? Now get back to your Dungeons & Dragons game and shut up. The Better Debut Album: Pink Floyd, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)\n\nThe Velvet Underground, The Velvet Underground and Nico (1967) vs. The B-52’s, The B-52’s (1979): The B-52’s exploded at a time when quirky female singers were all over New Wave-flavored radio, and gems like “Planet Claire” and “52 Girls” and (most especially) “Rock Lobster” fit right in when snuggled up against tracks by the likes of Nina Hagen, Lene Lovich, Flying Lizards and others. If you’d asked me at that time, though, which of those quirky female-fronted groups would still be making a fortune on their back catalog 30+ years later, I am not sure that I would have picked the B-52’s as the group that could do it, especially after they lost founding guitarist-songwriter Ricky Wilson to AIDS. While Fred Schneider adds his instantly recognizable and distinctive nasal tone to the proceedings, the real magic in the B-52’s has always happened when Cindy Wilson takes the lead, with Kate Pierson offering tight harmony or counterpoint lines, and because of this “Dance This Mess Around” is, to me, the greatest song on the band’s greatest album. The B’s also get credit for putting Athens, Georgia on the nation’s musical radar screen, even though they had actually left it and moved to New York by the time they got famous. But as lovely and loveable and fun as they were (and remain), they’re competing against The Velvet Underground and Nico, which introduced us to the seedy underbelly of New York, and to Lou Reed, and to Andy Warhol, and Nico, and John Cale, and to the banana cover, and to so, so, so much more. The Velvet Underground did not dance any mess around. They did not do the Camel Walk. Their 52 girls were junkies, or transvestites, or whores, or masochists, or all of the above. The Black Angel will trump the Rock Lobster, every time. Eric says. The Better Debut Album: The Velvet Underground, The Velvet Underground and Nico (1967)\n\nLeonard Cohen, Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967) vs. Gang of Four, Entertainment! (1979): Leonard Cohen was, and remains, an extraordinary songwriter. His aptly-titled debut disc contains a beautifully rich and mature collection of lyrics and melodies that have been covered over the years by everyone from Fairport Convention to Nick Cave, Harry Belafonte to the Lemonheads, and Will Oldham to the Flying Lizards, among countless others. Cohen’s songs are so strong, and so universal, that they readily lend themselves to reinterpretation and assimilation into other artists’ canons, with the most famous example of that these days being his ubiquitous “Hallelujah” in either its John Cale or Jeff Buckley version. (“Hallelujah” is not on Songs of Leonard Cohen, but came much later, on 1984’s Various Positions, ably demonstrating the longevity of Cohen’s songwriting skill). Unfortunately, Songs of Leonard Cohen is sung with the Voice of Leonard Cohen, and that’s not quite as grand as the material itself, nor many of the later, superior cover versions. On his debut album, Cohen sort of sounds like a cross between Neil Diamond and Nick Drake, which might be good if he captured the best facets of those two singers voices, but he tends to mine the weaker facets instead: breathy delivery in a somewhat monotone baritone. The sparse horn and string arrangements on Songs of Leonard Cohen are also a bit on the studio hack side (Cohen himself is said not to have cared for many of them), so the overall listening experience is not particularly thrilling, despite the A+ caliber material. Gang of Four’s Andy Gill seems to have taken some pointers from Cohen’s vocal stylings, offering a similar flat, monotone, breathy delivery, only with the added burden of an exceptionally thick English accent. Fortunately, Gill sings only to offer occasional contrast with Jon King’s powerful tenor, spending most of his time spraying his incredibly distinctive, broken-glass and shrapnel sounding shards of guitar noise atop the gargantuan rhythm rumblings of Dave Allen (bass) and Hugo Burnham (drums). Entertainment! also offered strong songs, though very, very different from Cohen’s: politically astute, socially sharp, and rich with word play every bit as angular as the music itself. It was filled with smart music, and its frenetic, edgy energy was infectious in ways that the laconic Songs of Leonard Cohen could never, ever be, and it ends with Gill and King intoning this epic lyrical line: “Love will get you like a case of anthrax, and that’s something I don’t want to catch.” Hallelujah! The Better Debut Album: Gang of Four, Entertainment! (1979)\n\nThe Band, Music from the Big Pink (1968) vs. Joy Division, Unknown Pleasures (1979): The Band’s debut album, Music from the Big Pink has one of the longer periods of maturation and incubation to be found among the 64 contenders in this contest. Levon Helm, Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Robbie Robertson and Richard Manuel came together as a performing group between 1957 and 1962 in Toronto, serving as a backing band to Ronnie Hawkins until their band leader’s dictatorial ways led them to strike out on their own, as Levon and the Hawks, in 1964. In 1965, Bob Dylan was looking for a backing group for his first electric tour, and through a fortuitous series of introductions, the Hawks hit the road with him as “Bob Dylan and the Band.” On that long tour, The Band were often resoundingly reviled by folk purists who could not stomach the fact that Dylan had “gone electric,” an experience that traumatized Helm into leaving the group. After Dylan’s infamous motorcycle accident, the Band migrated to Woodstock to be near him during his convalescence, and during that time, they recorded the epic and widely-bootlegged Basement Tapes (which eventually received an official release in 1975), capturing over 100 tracks that incorporated new songs, classic American folk material, and covers by other contemporary artists, mostly delivered in intimate, acoustic, house-bound, homey settings. So by the time the Band (with Helm back in the fold) got around to recording their nominal debut, they’d achieved a level of notoriety, fame, touring and recording experience that far out-stripped the experiences most debut artists could ever bring to the table for their first studio forays. That depth shows in the finished product: Music from the Big Pink is filled with great songs and performances, and all sorts of Americana and Roots and No Depression and Neo-Folk musical threads trace their lineage back to this great, home-spun, story-tellers album. It was not quite rock, and not quite country, and not quite folk, but it forged something greater from the best facets of each of those genres. It’s a uniquely American album, made by Canadians. Go figure. In many ways, Joy Division’s Unknown Pleasures comes from, and represents, almost completely diametrically opposing creative positions. Where Big Pink is warm and inviting, Unknown Pleasures is cold, forbidding, austere. Where Big Pink offers gorgeous singing by five deeply talented, very distinctive vocalists, Unknown Pleasures features Ian Curtis’ plaintive baritone bleat, occasionally supplemented by the very same-sounding Peter Hook and Stephen Morris. Where Big Pink is rural, Unknown Pleasures is urban. Where Big Pink used simple recording technology to capture traditional instruments, Unknown Pleasures featured studio madman Martin Hannett using every processing trick at his disposal to create a soundscape that is still startlingly other-worldly. Big Pink‘s album cover featured a childish, colorful painting by Dylan, Unknown Pleasures came in a stark black sleeve with a white graphic rendering of radio waves emanating from a dying star. And so on, and so on, and so on. Neither album sold well upon release, though both were generally well received, critically. Joy Division, sadly, benefited in the marketing department after Ian Curtis’ tragic suicide, which retroactively added heft and menace to the claustrophobic words and images that fill Unknown Pleasures‘ lyrics. And it’s that retroactive reassessment following a tragedy that leads me to tip my hand toward Music from the Big Pink as the better album in this contest, though an hour ago, before I wrote this blurb, I probably would have considered Unknown Pleasures a shoe-in to advance. Big Pink is simply a joy to play and hear. Unknown Pleasures is important, but sad. I’m going to embrace the sunshine on this one. The Better Debut Album: The Band, Music from the Big Pink (1968)\n\nKing Crimson, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969) vs. The Specials, The Specials (1979): In the Court of the Crimson King offered a startling, unique musical vision, one where classical music motifs, techniques and themes were abused by abrasive cutting edge recording technology, stretched over ungainly rhythmic patterns, and topped with powerful vocal declamations of some of the most truly hippie-tastic lyrics even penned. The line-up that created In the Court (Robert Fripp, Greg Lake, Michael Giles, Ian McDonald and Peter Sinfield) had an unbelievable life cycle: they first rehearsed in January 1969, played their first live show in April 1969, won rave reviews for a blistering performance on the undercard of the Rolling Stones’ famed Hyde Park concert in July 1969, released their debut album in October 1969, and fell apart at the end of a U.S. tour in December 1969, never to play together again. Less than a one-year life, but they left behind a truly remarkable record that can readily be touted as the first great manifestation of the progressive rock movement. We must also note Barry Godber’s shocking red scream album cover painting, which somehow perfectly captured the frenzied, frightening energy within; Godber died young, soon after the band broke up, so there’s another example of how many of those associated with this record flamed fast and brilliantly, then were gone. Robert Fripp has soldiered on, intermittently, with King Crimson to this day, while Greg Lake went on to Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Ian McDonald went on to Foreigner, and Peter Sinfield went on to be a producer and lyricist for hire to everyone from Roxy Music to Celine Dion. Their impact, together and apart, has been huge and far-reaching. And, to be fair, so has the impact of The Specials, whose 1979 self-titled debut was one of the first records to fully exploit that great and perfect space where punk energy and Jamaican musical traditions fit together most effectively. The Specials were also visually powerful: a multi-ethnic band at a time when racial tensions ran high in England, dressed in porkpie hats, and distributed on keyboardist-songwriter Jerry Dammers’ own 2 Tone record label, whose products were almost all packaged in striking, retro-themed album sleeves. Elvis Costello, still young and angry himself at that point, produced The Specials, which features a blend of reinterpreted classic Jamaican ska songs, and topical original numbers by Dammers and his bandmates. This album was urgent, political, explosive and, best of all, crazy fun to listen to. As with the original King Crimson, though, the original Specials line-up was not built to last, and after a solid second album (that added interesting cocktail lounge music elements to the mix) and the epic Ghost Town single, vocalists Terry Hall, Neville Staples and Lynval Golding left to form The Fun Boy Three, while Dammers reorganized the band for one final record, which included the wonderful (and perhaps effective) “Free Nelson Mandela.” Any modern ska band, and many modern political bands, owe a debt to The Specials and their wonderful debut album. But, at bottom line, it was a reinterpretation of a musical idiom that already existed, while the best moments of In the Court of the Crimson King actually invented new sounds and styles that had never been heard before. We’ve gotta go with the innovators in this case, though I had to think about this one longer than I would have thought necessary to reach that conclusion. Hmmm. The Better Debut Album: King Crimson, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969)\n\nThe Stooges, The Stooges (1969) vs. The Pretenders, The Pretenders (1980): As noted multiple times already, one of the hard things about this series, compared to earlier series, is that there aren’t really any weak links, so there aren’t a lot of contests where I can just dispatch somebody with a witty line or two, because the outcome is so clearly obvious up front, given the relative objective strengths and weaknesses of the contenders. And because the albums cited here are, objectively, all pretty darn good, I actually enjoy listening to the vast majority of them, and get excited about pitting them against each other. But this particular contest does not fill me with that sense of miracles and wonders, since I don’t really like to listen to either of these albums. Oh, yeah, I know they’re good, and I know they’re important, but I just would never sit down in my office, look at the 12,000+ songs in my iTunes account and declare: “A-ha! I must hear ‘Brass in Pocket’ right now!” or “Gee! Tonight is a great night for ‘No Fun,’ isn’t it?” So as I ponder this contest, what I end up really thinking about is not what’s great about these two records, but why I find them off-putting. Let’s look at the Stooges first: they were an undeniably spectacular live band, but a lot of their schtick is just dead on arrival after having been processed through John Cale’s production on their self-titled debut album. I know there is all sorts of proto-punk and raw power happening here, but it all sounds thin and enervated to me, and no amount of sub-woofer bumping can improve that. For what it’s worth, David Bowie screwed up The Stooges’ third album in the production and mixing process, too, leaving their sophomore disc, Fun House, as the one that I actually really like to listen to, as it’s got great songs, recorded far better than anything else in the early Iggy canon. And what about the Pretenders? I really love their third album, Learning to Crawl, but much of their debut leaves me cold. I don’t care for any of the debut’s singles (“Brass in Pocket,” “Stop Your Sobbing,” and “Kid”), all of which feel too precious and processed to me, and the deeper album cuts that I like aren’t enough to draw me in deep enough to actively listen to them anymore. Chrissie Hynde is obviously an undeniable force of nature, and I always loved the fact that she managed to jump from the same geographic gene pool that produced Devo and Pere Ubu to the world of international superstardom. But, for me, her creative voice after the loss of James Honeyman-Scott and Pete Farndon is much more appealing to me than what she offered on her debut disc, as well-produced and well-performed as it is. So, you know, I’m not excited to write much about either of these two albums, so I’m going to defer to critical convention and pick Iggy over Chrissie, since he’s been doing his thing for a decade or more longer than she has. But there’s no enthusiasm in my choice, just for the record, as you look to round two. The Better Debut Album: The Stooges, The Stooges (1969)\n\nSo there we have it, with half of our second round field of 32 already in place.

Without further ado, let’s get to the matches . . .\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band, The Allman Brothers Band (1969) vs. X, Los Angeles (1980): As with The Band in yesterday’s contests, there was a lot more depth and history to The Allman Brothers Band at the time when they released their debut album than met the eye. Gregg and Duane Allman had been performing together in bands in Florida, most notably the Allman Joys, since the early 1960s. In 1967, they moved to California, formed a new band called The Hour Glass, signed with Liberty Records, and released two (flop) albums. After The Hour Glass broke up, Duane Allman moved to Muscle Shoals, Alabama and became a choice session guitarist for the legendary FAME Studios, while Gregg moved back to Florida and began working clubs with most of the other musicians who would form the original lineup of The Allman Brothers Band. In the same year that The Allman Brothers Band was released, Duane Allman appeared on albums by Boz Scaggs, Wilson Pickett, Clarence Carter, Otis Rush, King Curtis, and countless others whose albums generally sold a whole lot better than the first Allman Brothers Band record did. Which is surprising, really, because the Allmans’ debut contains six classic Gregg Allman compositions (including concert stalwarts “Dreams” and “Whipping Post”), plus a pair of covers from the Spencer Davis Group and Muddy Waters catalogs that fit perfectly among the originals. While Duane Allman’s guitar had already earned him acclamation beyond his own band, and his interplay with Dickie Betts on this and subsequent albums was truly the stuff of legend, Gregg Allman proved to be the real harbinger of the band’s sound, with his powerful vocals and swirling organ giving the proceedings a rich and powerful resonance, deeply tied to the South’s great rhythm and blues traditions. Duane Allman would be dead a couple of years later, and Gregg Allman would soon enter into a long-term struggle with Dickie Betts over creative and songwriting control of the band, but on this debut and the subsequent Idelwild South, they are a tight and deeply talented band, with far-reaching influence on “Southern Rock” (a genre they arguably founded) and the jam band scene that embraced them as heroes after the Grateful Dead expired post-Jerry. But don’t hold that against them. X emerged from the Los Angeles punk scene, but they, too, were not all snot-nosed newcomers, either, when they made their way into the recording studio: Billy Zoom had been an L.A. session player for a decade, working with the likes of Gene Vincent and others, and legendary Doors member Ray Manzarek provided keyboards and production on X’s paean to their adopted hometown, Los Angeles. While X certainly paid their dues in the trenches of L.A.’s particularly noxious punk scene (they were prominently featured in Penelope Spheeris’ The Decline of Western Civilization), they were never much like their peers and colleagues, musically: John Doe and Exene Cervenka’s powerful he-she harmonies and vocal call and responses, the country overtones of Doe’s songwriting, Zoom’s rockabilly guitar skills, and the tight rhythm section of Doe and D.J. Bonebrake were about as far from the Germs, Black Flag and Screamers as you could get, in L.A. or anywhere else. With Manzarek remaining in the producer’s chair, X released an extraordinarily high quality string of four studio albums in just over three years, with nary a sophomore, junior or senior slump among them. While I would not cite Los Angeles as the best of those first four X albums, it’s slightly more solid, beginning to end, than the excellent The Allman Brothers Band debut, so I’m awarding them the victory in this case, by the slimmest of margins. The Better Debut Album: X, Los Angeles (1980)\n\nBlack Sabbath, Black Sabbath (1970) vs. U2, Boy (1980): Black Sabbath pulled off the Spinal Tap-worthy coup on their debut by having a song called “Black Sabbath” on an album called Black Sabbath by a band called Black Sabbath. (See also “Bad Company” on Bad Company by Bad Company, and “Motorhead” on Motorhead by Motorhead, among others). This accomplishment notwithstanding, Sabbath’s album was almost universally reviled by critics upon its release, though it soared into the top ten album charts in the U.K., and sold a million copies the U.S. within a couple of years. While they probably didn’t do it intentionally, Black Sabbath now receive retrospective accolades for producing the first (name your poison) heavy metal, stoner rock, doom rock, death metal, whatever album in history, with its sluggish rhythms, portent-laden vocals, sludgy riffage, and design aesthetic pretty much guaranteed to offend parents, churchgoers, and other upstanding citizens of all stripes and flavors. Again: did Ozzy, Geezer, Bill and Tony mean to found a new genre of music? Probably not: they just came into the studio with unknown producer Rodger Bain and played their live set (which included two covers and five originals, none of which are particularly great or original, honestly) in a single day session, with virtually no overdubs. I personally think you can attribute their oddly slow and stilted performance to a bad case of “studio-itis,” but that’s the beauty of rock and roll, when such shortcomings somehow become magical once audiences get their hands on the fruits of a band’s labors. U2’s Boy (produced by then-hot hired hand Steve Lillywhite) was a far more tightly manufactured and marketed product, with legendary manager Paul McGuinness shepherding his adolescent charges through the early stages of their career, on their brisk way to global super-stardom of a level rarely achieved before or since. While Boy‘s opening single, “I Will Follow,” is a great, great song, very little that follows it on U2’s debut rises to the same level of engagement. In this case, I’ll take the glorious misguided accident over the earnest corporate product, any day. The Better Debut Album: Black Sabbath, Black Sabbath (1970)\n\nBig Star, #1 Record (1972) vs. The Feelies, Crazy Rhythms (1980): The random pairing generator did an interesting job on this particular match-up, which competes two true cult classics against each other. I really think you’d be hard pressed to find another pairing in this contest with smaller combined sales, but higher combined critical respect than #1 Record vs Crazy Rhythms. Which kind of bums me out, actually, since this is like when the NCAA basketball selection committee pits two scrappy mid-major, at-large teams against each other, lest they take down better known (but not actually better) squads from the money conferences. In a just world, both of these discs would get to thrill another day, but short of me kicking out the Stooges or Pink Floyd retroactively for rules violations or undue abuse of performance enhancing substances, that ain’t gonna happen, alas. Big Star’s debut album featured bassist Andy Hummel and drummer Jody Stephens backing the guitar-vocal-songwriting pair of Chris Bell and Alex Chilton, the latter of whom had provided lead vocals six years earlier for the legendary Top 40 hit “The Letter” as a teenaged member of The Box Tops. The album merged gentle acoustic numbers with guitar-heavy boogie rockers, Beatles-like harmonies with blue-eyed soul, and an earthy muscle with mystical aspirations, creating an album of great immediacy and warmth. The critics loved it, right from the get-go, but Big Star’s label, Ardent Records, botched the distribution, and it vanished largely without a (commercial) trace. Chris Bell left the group soon thereafter, and after a few troubled years as a solo artist, he died young in an auto accident. Chilton, Hummel and Stephens stuck it out to release Radio City in 1974, and to record what ultimately became Third/Sister Lover, though they lost interest in the project and went their separate ways long before it was actually released. Of Big Star’s recorded and released canon, #1 Record is the best sounding of the lot from a production standpoint, in large part because Chris Bell was more passionate about the technical aspects of recording than Chilton was. But as hard as it to say this, given how badly things turned out for Bell, his vocal performances are nowhere near the quality and clarity of Chilton’s, and I find myself wanting to skip some of the Bell-sung songs accordingly, to get to those smoother, less-strained Chilton leads. Though I feel guilty about that, honestly. As far as the Feelies’ debut goes, I have to admit that my initial and current take on it is somewhat influenced by the way in which I first encountered it. I really liked the band Felt in the mid-’80s, and while buying one of their discs at Olsson’s Records in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., the clerk asked me if I had heard the Feelies’ new album The Good Earth. He thought that I might like it, as it was inspired by the Velvet Underground, and featured nice guitar work and a vaguely Lou Reed-y sounding singer, like Felt did. I took his advice, and I really liked The Good Earth, a lot. So I looked up the Feelies back catalog, and discovered that it had been six years since their prior disc, Crazy Rhythms, which featured (gasp!) Anton Fier on drums, who I knew from his later stint with Pere Ubu and from the awesome Visions of Excess album by Golden Palominos. So I was stoked to hear this album, given that unexpected family tree twist (Fier was gone long before The Good Earth) . . . but then it left me wanting a little, I have to admit. The Lou Reed-y vocals of The Good Earth seemed to cross over from “inspired by Lou” to “imitating Lou.” And I found Fier’s rhythms to be, indeed, crazy, and itchy, and nervousness inducing, but a little bit of them went a long, long way. While the guitars on Crazy Rhythms were great, the album sounded thinner to me than the more lush and inviting The Good Earth. So since I came at their catalog backwards, Crazy Rhythms has always felt like a sophomore slump to me, because I didn’t hear it when I was supposed to, since it apparently didn’t make it to the record stores of North Carolina where I lived when it was first released. I’ve warmed to it a bit over the years, sure, but I still like The Good Earth and the latter-day Feelies line-up that made it much better. So I think in this case, my trepidation about Chris Bell’s lead vocals notwithstanding, I’m going to have to advance Big Star to the next round. Chilton had made a mark before it came out, and after he was lovingly name-checked by Paul Westerberg in the Replacements’ song bearing his name, he went on to inspire children by the millions just by walking by. Or so Paul said. What’s that song? The Better Debut Album: Big Star, #1 Record (1972)\n\nSteely Dan, Can’t Buy a Thrill (1972) vs. The Go-Go’s, Beauty and the Beat (1981): While the prior Big Star vs Feelies battle featured two somewhat obscure bands with obvious talents that coulda shoulda woulda made them superstars, had the planets aligned properly for them, this Steely Dan vs The Go-Go’s battle matches two of the most improbable superstar bands of the past half century. The Go-Go’s emerged from the foulest elements of the Los Angeles punk scene, as delightfully documented in Mark Spitz and Brendan Mullen’s We Got the Neutron Bomb: Belinda Carlisle was an early, non-performing member of the Germs, and all of the early band members were residents at the notorious Canterbury Apartments, nearby the Masque Club, which served Los Angeles punk community in the ways that the more famous CBGG served New York’s punks. By all accounts, the only people in the L.A. punk scene who thought the Go-Go’s had any chance of success in any way whatsoever were the Go-Go’s themselves. Amazingly enough, though, they were right: during a grinding tour in the U.K. supporting Madness, the original version of “We Got the Beat” was released as a single on Stiff Records, then improbably climbed up the English pop charts and U.S. dance charts. By the time Beauty and the Beat was released in the States, the Go-Go’s had eschewed all the filth and fury of their punk days, creating instead an epic and effervescent summer trifle, which became the first ever platinum-selling album to be entirely written, sung and performed by an all-female band. That’s quite a leap from there to here! Steely Dan was founded by Donald Becker and Walter Fagen, a pair of sardonic and ungainly jazz nerds from Bard College in New York, who after a pseudonymous performing apprenticeship with Jay and the Americans (Jay Black referred to them as “Manson and Starkweather”) and a stint as songwriters-for-hire in New York City, took their bearded and overalls-wearing guitar-playing buddy Denny Dias to Los Angeles, where they recorded their debut album with an impromptu band of session players pulled together under the direction of producer Gary Katz. They named the band after a famous literary dildo, as if they weren’t already off-putting enough to start with. Fagen and Becker wrote all the songs (as they have done throughout Steely Dan’s auspicious career), but neither of them particularly wanted to sing, so drummer Jim Hodder and ostensible front-man David Palmer took three lead vocals between them, with Fagen reluctantly singing the remainder of the album. Surprise, surprise, surprise: two of the Fagen-sung songs, “Do It Again” and “Reelin’ in the Years,” were big hits, and Can’t Buy A Thrill became an improbable best-selling album. Fagen and Becker would tour and record with that original band for a couple of years, but by the time of their fourth album, Katy Lied, they’d defaulted to using an army of crack session players to bring the sounds in their heads to fruition. (Though it is worth noting that even on Can’t Buy A Thrill, session players beyond the core band contributed heavily, with Elliot Randall’s guitar solo on “Reelin’ in the Years” standing as a particular highlight). While Can’t Buy a Thrill is not exactly representative of the Steely Dan canon as a while, it does set a tone that allowed Becker and Fagen to grow in directions recognizable from the sprouts on this first offering. The Go-Go’s, on the other hand, didn’t really grow much after Beauty and the Beat: that was their sound, it worked, and they stuck with it, to decreasing returns. I’m going with Becker and Fagen in this contest, as the (slightly) more improbable superstars who hit a completely unexpected creative home run in their first at-bat, even before they’d learned to work the saxophones. The Better Debut Album: Steely Dan, Can’t Buy a Thrill (1972)\n\nBrian Eno, Here Come the Warm Jets (1973) vs. R.E.M., Murmur (1983): Brian Eno’s solo debut caused a little bit of debate when I was trying to decide what qualified for inclusion on the list of 64 and what did not, since Eno had been a highly visible and well-known member of Roxy Music on their early singles and first two albums, so there was ample interest in and support for his solo career when he struck out on his own. I ended up deciding to include Eno because he had not been the primary songwriter or singer for Roxy Music (that was Bryan Ferry), so Here Come the Warm Jets represented the debut of his voice (both as a singer and as a lyricist/composer), in addition to being the first album to bear his name on its front cover. As it turned out, I actually then ended up removing the debut Roxy Music album from consideration; it has some incredible songs on it (though not Roxy’s brilliant “Virginia Plain” single in its original release), but it also has some clunkers, and the production (by ex-King Crimson lyricist Peter Sinfield) is pretty dire. Roxy hit their stride on their magnificent second album, For Your Pleasure, after which point Eno split. Or was pushed by Ferry, depending on whose stories you believe. However he came to be out on his own, though, Eno’s debut album is an absolute masterpiece, featuring members of Roxy Music, Hawkwind, King Crimson, and a variety of lesser-known studio players nailing track after track after track of weird and wonderful music, with Robert Fripp’s legendary “Baby’s On Fire” guitar solo standing as the highest point among a field of shining pinnacles. Eno put out three more ostensibly rock-oriented albums out over the years that followed, then gained acclaim as a producer of merit (Devo, U2, David Bowie, many others) as well the father of ambient music, for better or for worse. R.E.M.’s Murmur was ubiquitous on, and somehow seemed to play a role in the actual promulgation of, college radio at the time of its release, though their earlier Chronic Town EP and “Radio Free Europe” single had primed the pump to some extent, as had the B-52’s work a few years earlier to put Athens, Georgia on America’s cultural radar screen. While I liked (and like) Murmur, it was always an easy album to make fun of, right from the git-go: people called it Mumble (after Michael Stipe’s singing style), and I can remember a group of friends singing the phrase “two-headed cow” (a Stipe lyric) tunelessly over and over again in a bar or at a party on more than one occasion when an early R.E.M. song came on the jukebox or stereo, to great amusement from bystanders. Plus, some years later, I actually lived in Athens, Georgia, and their guitarist, Peter Buck, insulted my musical tastes when I purchased records by Einsturzende Neubauten and Fad Gagdet at Wuxtry, the record store where he once worked. And then there was the time that some friends and I got to the Uptown Lounge really, really early to get good booth seats near the stage for a gig by Adrian Belew’s Bears, and right before the show started, the bouncers made us move elsewhere, so Stipe and Mike Mills could have our seats. So I’m gonna go with Eno in this contest, despite the story I relayed earlier in the Devo vs Hendrix contest about being sneered at by a sexy cashier when I presented Here Come the Warm Jets for purchase. This contest is just filled with feelings of shame and mortification. The Better Debut Album: Brian Eno, Here Come the Warm Jets (1973)\n\nLynyrd Skynyd, Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd (1973) vs. Violent Femmes, Violent Femmes (1983): If the Allman Brothers Band founded the Southern Rock genre on their 1969 self-titled debut album (knocked out of the running above), then Lynyrd Skynyrd perfected it with their 1973 debut release, which helpfully informed us all how to say their name, lest all those y’s confuse the poor readers among us. Pretty much everything you know and either love or hate (and there aren’t a lot of people who split down the middle on this question) about Lyrnyrd Skynyrd is here from the git-go: the triple-lead guitar attack, the Al Kooper-produced choogle-boogie rhythms, the misguided attempts at writing socially relevant lyrics, the proud use of native Southern accents when singing, and, of course, “Free Bird.” While that song has become a punchline all these years on, just like “Stairway to Heaven,” (note: I have always wanted someone to cover the songs together . . . “and she’s buy-uy-ing a stair-air-way . . . to FREEBIRD [solo to fade]), it really was pretty awesome before it wore out its welcome, as were the slightly less-well-known “Gimme Three Steps” and “Tuesday’s Gone.” Kooper was a pro in the production seat, and the bar-tested band is tight and effective throughout. It’s better than most of you Yankee snobs think it is, honestly. The Violent Femmes’ self-titled debut is also quite an accomplishment, but in a lot of different ways. There’s no mellotrons on it, for starters, nor any of the other production tricks that Kooper used to give Skynryd some extra studio depth; Violent Femmes is pretty much a live studio rip through the set that the precocious trio had honed busking in Milwaukee, where they were discovered by Pretenders James Honeyman-Scott and Chrissie Hynde and offered an opening slot at a Pretenders show. Gordon Gano’s voice was also something of a shock the first time you heard it, passionate and raw and attention-getting, for sure. Where Skynyrd needed three guitars and an organ to get their point across, the Femmes did it with acoustic instruments and pots-and-pans style drum kits. Gano’s was a horny teenager living in a highly religious household when he wrote most of the songs on his debut album, and that sense of awkward repression still gives them a weird sense of uncomfortable urgency. Most amazingly, though, given Violent Femmes’ roots in traditional American folk and country gospel music, you could dance like hell to their stuff. Thirty years on, “Blister in the Sun” and “Add it Up” are pretty much guaranteed to get people out on a bar’s dance floor (if there’s been enough alcohol deployed, anyway), eagerly shouting “why can’t I get just one screw” and “big hands, you know you’re the one” as if they’d written those words themselves. And that’s an album with impact. The Better Debut Album: Violent Femmes, Violent Femmes (1983)\n\nMike Oldfield, Tubular Bells (1973) vs. Metallica, Kill ‘Em All (1983): Boy, here’s a study in contrasts, and I suspect I am one of a relatively small number of people anywhere, ever, who actually owns and knows both of these albums well. Tubular Bells was a truly audacious accomplishment for a gifted young composer and performer, with 19-year old Mike Oldfield playing most of the instruments on his 49-minute long, interwoven suite of songs. If you think you have never heard it, you are probably wrong: one of its tinkly opening themes was used in the score of The Exorcist, so the music you hear in your head when you think of that movie, well, that would be Mike Oldfield. The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band’s Vivian Stanshall makes a delightful appearance at the end of side one of Oldfield’s debut, effusively introducing all of the instruments used on the album, culminating, of course, with the tubular bells. (This is a nice mirror to Stanshall’s similar list of instruments in “The Intro and the Outro,” from the already advanced to the next round Gorilla). Tubular Bells, like the Who’s Tommy, has gone on to be released in a variety of formats over the years: orchestral, live, revisited, revamped, original ending, new mix, whatever . . . but it never sounded (or looked, what a great cover!) as good as it did when he put it out the first time. Metallica originally planned to call their debut album Metal Up Your Ass, with a record cover image depicting a dagger-wielding fist emerging from a toilet bowl. While Metallica made an important and influential sound on their first long-player, they were, and remain, fairly loathsome, self-important idiots whose best results usually seem like happy accidents, and whose purposeful actions usually turn out to be bad ideas. No contest, and this comes from a guy who counts Napalm Death as my favorite band, so don’t bother lecturing me about not understanding metal or being a prog sissy, okay? You’re wrong, I’m right. Period. The Better Debut Album: Mike Oldfield, Tubular Bells (1973)\n\nNew York Dolls, New York Dolls (1973) vs. Run-D.M.C., Run-D.M.C. (1984): The cover of the New York Dolls’ 1973 debut album depicts the quintet decked out in their normal on-stage drag outfits, with the band’s name scrawled in red lipstick. It was designed to shock and offend, and I imagine that it probably did so, introducing some number of impressionable youths to the concept of “glam.” But when you step back and look at it in context, it seems way late out of the gate in terms of being influential in that regard: by 1973, The Sweet, Slade, T. Rex, Elton John, Gary Glitter, Alice Cooper, Mott the Hoople, Roxy Music, David Bowie and countless others had already taken the glam thing to the stage and the recording studio, most of them looking and sounding better in the process. When the Dolls are cited as influences, it largely seems to be because the early U.K. punks embraced junkie Johnny Thunders when his post-Dolls band, The Heartbreakers, “toured” England, and I put “toured” in quotes, because by most accounts, Thunders’ performances and recordings were more about the Sid Vicious-like dysfunctional junkie loser with good hair view of punk than they were about the Steve Jones or Mick Jones approach to actually writing, playing and recording some good energetic songs, rather than dozing off onstage under the influence of the day’s chosen narcotic(s). So, you know, I’m not really a fan, shall we say, of the Dolls, nor of their debut album, which even the dependable Todd Rundgren couldn’t really make sound like much more than an amped-up set of bad Rolling Stones out-takes. While I am sure that the New York Dolls were quite entertaining onstage in their early days, if you liked copycat glam by a group that weren’t as good at putting their make-up on as David Bowie was, the bottom line is that you can’t see lipstick and mascara when you listen to a record, and absent the visuals, the Dolls music really wasn’t much of anything special. (Note for the record: many years later, I had the opportunity to interview Dolls guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, and he was absolutely delightful, shopping a demo tape that I wish I still had of punchy, well-written songs. I also appreciated the documentary some years back about Arthur “Killer” Kane, who became a librarian. But I find David Johansen to be among the most annoying human beings in rock music, and I have a hard time respecting the junkie contingent of the Dolls, so, you know, respect for Kane and Sylvain aside, I just go “yuck” at what’s left). Run-D.M.C’s debut album isn’t my favorite hip-hop or rap record, by a long shot, but it was one of the first to add a harder, rock-flavored edge to the beats and flow, and that made it accessible to an entirely new audience of folks who were never going to embrace the soul and funk-based loops of the Sugar Hill Gang and Kurtis Blow era. “Death to Disco” was still a recent memory in the early ’80s, so rocking up rap was a real creative coup in terms of its crossover success potential, and Run-D.M.C. were the first to capitalize on that. And they did it without lipstick and heroin, so there’s that too. The Better Debut Album: Run-D.M.C., Run-D.M.C. (1984)\n\nAlrighty, with that one done, we are now three quarters of the way through the first round, with the following 24 albums having survived to fight again.

Ready? Let’s do this!\n\nPatti Smith, Horses (1975) vs. Guns n’ Roses, Appetite for Destruction (1987): Back in 2005, I undertook one of these long-form competitive essay projects called “Slaughtering the Sacred Cows: An Abbreviated Look at the Most Over-Rated Records Ever.” I created a spreadsheet of other magazines’ “Best 100 Albums Ever” lists, and aggregated the points to get a list of the most critically beloved records ever. It was kind of amazing how quickly critical consensus and homogeneity were achieved, and if you are much of a music journalism reader, I’ll bet you could probably name 40 of the top 50 albums without thinking very hard. But in the next step, to capture the “over-rated” element, I also looked at the sales figures for each of those critically beloved albums, under the premise that if critics loved something to death, but nobody ever wanted to buy it, then the albums with the most skewed ratios of critical love to commercial failure can be considered the most over-rated albums ever. I came up with a list of the 64 critical-favorite albums with the worst ratios of critical admiration to commercial success, and I got ready to go at them, head to head, to identify the one album that most represented music critics being completely out of touch with the regular listening world of the average American human being. But then . . . I stopped. Because I looked at the list, and unlike any other of these tournaments that I have ever done, I knew exactly where I would end up when all was said and done, and I didn’t want to waste weeks of time and 20,000 words worth of effort explaining how I reached that conclusion. Because there’s not a shred of doubt in my mind that Patti Smith’s Horses is the most critically over-rated album in rock music history. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know all of the counter-arguments you can throw at me on this one (“Poetry! Mapplethorpe! Empowerment! John Cale! Jesus died for blah blah blah! Go Johnny! Nuggets! Lenny! Poetry! Mapplethorpe! [repeat, ad nauseum]”), so before you explain them to me again, go listen to this, then come back and keep reading. I’ll wait. Go ahead. I’ll read some of poet Patti’s Blue Oyster Cult lyrics while you are gone. Hmmm . . . “I had this bitch you see / She made lies to me / Her deceit ah, it gave me a chill / But I found out now /That baby, that baby ice dog.” Well, then. Okay, are you back? Yeah, I’ve heard it before, whatever it is you want to tell me about Horses. But more important from that video trip: Authority! Bullshit! Authority! Bullshit! I simply do not accept the rigid critical orthodoxy that labels Horses as a must-love, genius, landmark album, if for no other reason than its cover of Van Morrison’s “Gloria,” which immediately takes me back to every awful version I’ve ever heard of that song by every awful happy hour performer looking to connect with every awful frat house or fern bar audience via one of the most lowest common denominator crowd-pleasers ever. Well, this side of Morrison’s other great lowest common denominator hit, “Brown Eyed Girl,” anyway. (I am assuming the chord changes in the latter were too complicated for Patti’s Group, or they might have tried that one too). No sir, I don’t like it. At this point, I will pause to ask that you all observe one of the opening premises of this contest: just because I hate something you love, that doesn’t mean that I hate you, too . . . and that’s important to note right now, knowing just how many people who I admire and respect actually do love this album. But I do not. At all. The end. Now, let me tell you about the first time I heard Guns n’ Roses. I was out dancing at a sort of post-punk/New Wave bar in Washington, D.C. during the Summer of 1987 with a very fun group of friends (Marcia among them, though we were not romantically involved at the time), busting moves to some great dance numbers from faves like Shriekback and the Cure and New Order and Tones and Tail and the Cult and such-like. And then the DJ put on a song that first caused people to pause at its skittery guitar opener and rising background shriek, then caused pretty much the whole club to rush the dance floor once the riff kicked in. Holy crap! What the hell was this? We didn’t know, we didn’t care, we just knew that it sounded so, so, so good, with a long bridge that just built and built and built until the weirdo-sounding singer screamed “Do you know where you are? You’re in the jungle! You’re gonna die!” When it all ended, the crowd actually applauded the DJ, and he ended up playing “Welcome to the Jungle” a few more times before the evening was over. And when I finally figured out who the band was (Guns n’ Roses, obviously) and scored their awesome Appetite for Destruction, I was thrilled to discover that there was a whole album’s worth of songs that were that awesome, and that exciting, and that fun. And that is how a debut album should hit you, Johnny. Go. The Better Debut Album: Guns n’ Roses, Appetite for Destruction (1987)\n\nThe Dictators, Go Girl Crazy! (1975) vs. Public Enemy, Yo! Bum Rush the Show (1987): The Dictators’ Go Girl Crazy! is a really, really fun and entertaining album, wherein chunky Neanderthal riffage meets strongly accented New York City proletariat vocals waxing passionate about girls, teenagers, and cars, and also teenaged girls and cars. For which The Dictators lived, apparently. The cover of the group’s debut featured a fully-posed photo of roadie and sometime vocalist Handsome Dick Manitoba flexing in his best professional pose next to a sparkly jacket bearing his name, years before Cyndi Lauper popularized the link between professional wrestling and rock music. It was an image that was clearly designed to say “Pick this album up to have fun, because we, the Dictators, really do not take ourselves very seriously, at all, as evidenced by the fact hat we let our roadie pose on the cover, and sing lead vocals on our debut album, thank you very much!” And Go Girl Crazy! completely delivers on the message communicated by its cover: it is a lot of fun, it is very blue collar, it comes from a world with clearly-defined traditional gender roles, and (did we mention?) it’s a lot of fun. A whole lot of fun. More than a barrel full even. But does that much fun make a great debut album? Ennnhhh . . . I don’t really think so. Punk was such a complete and total game changer, circa 1977, that many music critics thereafter made a career of looking for commercially dead-on-release albums from the era between 1967 and 1977, and posthumously declaring them as proto-Punk masterpieces. See The Stooges. See The MC5. See The New York Dolls. See Eddie and the Hot Rods. And see The Dictators. And you know what? None of those bands’ critically-adored, but commercially bust, debut albums from that era between the Summer of Love and the Summer of Punk are particularly masterful, at all, if you aren’t depending on them to fulfill some sort of predestination punk prophecy linking that which was to that which became, world without end, amen. At bottom line, Go Girl Crazy! was a great and fun summer trifle, and not much more. Public Enemy’s Yo! Bum Rush the Show was also a great summer album, though a lot more people experienced it in the Summer of ’87 than experienced The Dictators in the Summer of ’75. Yo! Bum Rush the Show is not, by any stretch of the imagination, Public Enemy’s greatest record, but it was certainly riveting and influential in its first year of release, and it set the stage for Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Terminator X and the Bomb Squad to truly blow the roof off of every sucker with 1988’s It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. So if forced to choose between a near-novelty record that gained cult status years after it was released, and a seminal long player whose audiences didn’t really know what to make of it, because there was nothing to compare it to in 1987, I have to select the confusing later record over the easily-accessible earlier one. Even though I am 100% certain that Handsome Dick Manitoba would mop the floor with Flava Flav in a cage match, if given the opportunity to do so. The Better Debut Album: Public Enemy, Yo! Bum Rush the Show (1987)\n\nRamones, Ramones (1976) vs. Napalm Death, Scum (1987): As someone who writes and talks about music a lot, I am often asked to name my favorite band, and for probably the past five years or so, my response has been “Napalm Death.” I wrote about why, here, if you want the details, beyond the fact that they are a great, great, very important, very influential band, I mean. Napalm’s 1987 debut album, Scum, is widely regarded as one of the landmark albums of extreme rock music, as the first public offering of a genre that would become known as “grindcore” in the years ahead. But, for the record, as much as I love Napalm Death, I think that their debut is similar to Black Sabbath’s Black Sabbath: a happy accident of ineptness resulted in something monstrous emerging from what should have been a quickly forgotten studio session. Or, in Napalm Death’s case, a pair of studio sessions, as the group was in such tumult when this record was released that it actually features a completely different band on its A-side and its B-side: Nicholas Bullen (later of Scorn), Justin Broadrick (Head of David, Godflesh, Jesu) and Mick Harris (also later of Scorn) played the first side of the album, while Harris, Lee Dorian (Cathedral), Bill Steer (Carcass) and Jim Whiteley played the second. If you’re keeping score, that means the only person who appears on the entire album is Mick Harris, and he was the drummer. After one more album and EP with Dorian and Steer, Napalm Death was essentially reinvented on their third album, Harmony Corruption, around Harris, guitarists Mitch Harris and Jesse Pintado, bassist Shane Embury, and vocalist Mark “Barney” Greenway. And then Mick Harris was gone soon after that, leaving the longest-lasting and most widely known version of the band with nary a single member of the group(s) that played on Scum. So when I say that I love Napalm Death, who am I talking about? Clearly the latter day and current line-up of the band: Greenway, Mitch Harris, Shane Embury and drummer Danny Herrera. Do I love Scum? No, not really. I like it, and I appreciate its import and impact, but it’s not a record that I spin very often anymore, since so many latter-day Napalm Death albums are far superior to it, in terms of song-writing, production and performance. And then there’s The Ramones’ debut album, which is one of the few proto-punk albums from the 1967-1977 era that actually lives up to, and probably exceeds, its own reputation. This is pretty darn close to a perfect rock and roll album, all the way through, with iconic visuals, awesome songs, great production, the whole works. There’s so much to be said about The Ramones, and it so easily tops Scum, and I have already written over 15,000 words in the first round of this contest, that we’re just gonna advance it to round two, with nothing else needing to be said. For now. The Better Debut Album: Ramones, Ramones (1976)\n\nThe Modern Lovers, The Modern Lovers (1976) vs. N.W.A., N.W.A. and the Posse (1987): John Cale is one of my favorite musicians, songwriters, and all around influential artists. But he’s also one of my least-favorite producers when it comes to capturing other bands in the studio (except for his work with Nico, which was perfect), and several of his less-than-stellar production projects actually show up on the list we’re dissecting here this month. I begrudgingly advanced the Cale-produced The Stooges into the second round, even though I think it sounds lousy, and I kicked the over-rated Horses by the Patti Smith Group to the curb earlier in this post, and Cale’s muddled production plays a part in my distaste for that album, too. Cale also produced Squeeze’s and Happy Mondays’ dodgy-sounding debuts, and it’s probably worth noting how few bands and artists (again, Nico being the exception) worked with him in t"
