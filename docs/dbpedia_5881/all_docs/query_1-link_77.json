        "text": "Screeching Weasel is one of the seminal punk bands of the 1990’s and 2000s. Like the Ramones before them, they were often imitated but never duplicated. A core staple of the Lookout Records roster for years, the Weasels were a force to be reckoned with. Through various lineup changes and break ups, the band managed to release over a dozen full lengths of which two are considered pop punk canon – My Brain Hurts and Anthem for a New Tomorrow. On March 24th, Screeching Weasel digitally released its latest set of 14 songs entitled, Some Freaks of Atavism. Atavism was originally slated for an August release, however, with the country on lock down, founding member Ben Weasel made the choice to release the music now, “to give a captive audience a chance to hear new Screeching Weasel music.”\n\nSome Freaks of Atavism is a fantastic collection of songs that capture Ben Weasel at the top of his song writing game. Ben explained that the songs were from a pool of possibilities there were written over the course of the past few years. The first two songs on Atavism were recorded for some time while the vocals were recently re-recorded due to a revision of the lyrics. A few songs were originally written for inclusion on a potential Baby Fat 2 release (Act 2 of Ben’s rock opera) while Brain in a Jar was originally written during the First World Manifesto sessions but re-worked into the masterpiece found on Atavism.\n\nBen thinks quite highly of the new music. When asked which Screeching Weasel release he is most proud of, without hesitation he stated, “You can’t do better than Some Freaks of Atavism. This new record is by far the total package. The one that I would point to as this is what my band is and what it is supposed to be and encompasses everything that was ever good about the band. Usually there are fans that want to complain about the new music but I am only hearing great things from people about this one. It’s great and all but since this is the first time I am not hearing complaints, I almost feel like I must be doing something wrong.”\n\nWeasel credits the professionalism of his band-mates and the assistance from his long time producer, Mike Kennerty (guitarist for the All-American Rejects) for the success of the recent recording and the expanded musical dynamics on display. “What we are doing now with Mike is pretty different than we had done with producers in the past. He understands songs and he understands what is good about my songs when they are good and what is bad about them when they are bad. I can trust him to go through everything and pick out the best parts and move forward. He has an awful lot of latitude because he’s proved himself over and over.”\n\nIn addition to releasing Some Freaks of Atavism, Ben is keeping busy recording a daily YouTube cast, My Right. During these episodes, Ben discusses various topics and answers fan questions (participants in the daily chat be warned, if your question is not to Ben’s liking, you may find yourself receiving a steady diet of ridicule and public shaming). These episodes are entertaining and feature Ben Weasel unfiltered (as always) sharing his views on everything from social distancing, politics, literature, philosophy, and the state of music. Ben is currently exploring options for starting his own podcast in the near future based on the success he’s had with My Right.\n\nHere’s more information about Some Freaks of Atavism:\n\nBand line up:\n\nBen Weasel – vocals\n\nMike Hunchback – guitar\n\nPierre Marche – drums\n\nTrevor Jackson – guitar and backing vocals\n\nZach Brandner – bass and backing vocals\n\nTrack listing:\n\nShe Ain’t Your Baby\n\nBack of Your Head\n\nGod Help Us\n\nTo Hell with You\n\nSettle In\n\nNot Even Close\n\nLosing My Mind – vocal duties shared with Mike Herrera of MXPX.\n\nNever Been in Love\n\nTurn It Around – vocal duties shared with Josie Cotton.\n\nCrying Shame\n\nBrain in a Jar\n\nDead by Dawn\n\nProblematic\n\nBleed Through Me\n\nClick here for a comprehensive list of places to find Some Freaks of Atavism:\n\nOr go straight to:\n\nSpotify or Amazon Music\n\nComing Soon: An exclusive extended interview with Ben Weasel.\n\nOther punk pages on Underthought:\n\nScreeching Weasel 101\n\nMr. T Experience – Love Is Dead\n\nDirect Hit!\n\nPop Punk Crash Course Part 1\n\nPop Punk Crash Course Part 2\n\nPop Punk Crash Course Part 3\n\nI’ve been a huge pop punk fan for years and it’s great to see that the genre is still alive and kicking. When Lookout Records went under I had some serious concerns that some of the best music would become unavailable to the next generation of fan. Some of the key releases have become much harder to find on CD or vinyl but all the streaming services and access to music through Youtube and a million other apps and platforms, I am reassured that some of the best music ever made will continue to find a savvy audience.\n\nWhen I see the pop punk bands that are talked about today, it makes me feel old. Good Charlotte considered ‘old school’ just makes me feel OLD! There is a ton of amazing pop punk out there and I feel like I wouldn’t be doing my job unless I highlighted some of my personal favorite releases from decades past. I will do my best to not get too obscure with the recommendations, however, a few of these bands/releases may be tougher to find than others. Additionally, I am not here to split hairs and argue with people what is punk, pop punk, emo, etc… This post isn’t to define who is or is not in the pop punk genre, its only purpose is to highlight some melodic punk rock that may be overlooked by kids today that might really enjoy hearing some good music. With that said, here is part two of bands, albums, and songs that are worth chasing down and checking out (Bands L-R). To see Part 1, click here.\n\nWell known bands and bands currently releasing music with regularity are left off this list (Ramones, Rancid, NOFX, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Misfits, Menzingers, My Chemical Romance, Offspring, Operation Ivy, and Rise Against).\n\nLawrence Arms – These guys have a ton of amazing songs in their catalogue. Try there few and see why they should be your new favorite band of the week – The Devil’s Taking Names, Quincentuple Your Money, Porno and Snuff Films.\n\nLeft Alone – I’m not a huge fan of all of their stuff but they really put a really catchy and well written song together with their track Every Night.\n\nLillingtons – You like Teenage Bottlerocket? Well check out their origins. This is Spy-core and it is done really well. Check out Final Transmission and their version of Wait It Out.\n\nManges – A great pop punk band from Italy. Elvis Has Left The Building, I Will Always Do, and Yeah (Late Nite Song) are my three personal favorites from the band.\n\nMatches – I really love the song, Dog Eared Page.\n\nMethadones – Danny Vapid (of Screeching Weasel fame) has a million bands and a million releases. The guy just churns out punk rock anthems. Check out his band, The Methadones on tracks like Imperfect World, Bored Of Television, and Suddenly Cool. Also, check out another of his bands, The Mopes, and the tracks, My Heart Won’t Bleed For You and I Don’t Know How To Say Goodbye.\n\nMidtown – Rock N Roll is just about as good a straight ahead radio friendly pop punk song as I have ever heard.\n\nMighty Mighty Bosstones – Godfathers of ska-core. Check out Someday I Suppose, The Impression That I Get, and Jackknife To A Swan for a taste of what they do best.\n\nMr. T Experience – Dr. Frank writes some of the best lyrics the genre has ever known. Although there are a ton of MTX classics, I would recommend a first timer to check out Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa, Love Is Dead, Even Hitler Had A Girlfriend, I Fell For You, More Than Toast, New Girlfriend, and You You You.\n\nMuffs – Great band that never really received their due. Kim is my favorite female vocalist of all time. Check out Agony, I’m A Dick, and Best Time Around.\n\nMxPx – A ton of solid releases but Life in General was my favorite. Check out the Middlename and My Mom Still Cleans My Room for a taste of what they offer.\n\nNerf Herder – Dorkier than Weezer. These guys are a ton of fun. Check out How To Meet Girls and focus on the tracks Vivian, Courtney, and Lamer Than Lame.\n\nNo Use For A Name – A great band that brings it musically and lyrically. Check out International You Day and if you like what you hear, seek out their stuff.\n\nOsker – Epitaph band fronted by a young punk who had some serious song writing chops. Fast, aggressive, no fills and in your face. Treatment 5 is one of my all time favorite CDs. Check out Alright, 13, and I Cannot. Their follow up was a huge departure and took some time for listeners to get into. After that? Poof! Never to be heard from again. I’m bummed.\n\nPinhead Gunpowder – An all star line up featuring Billie Joe from Green Day. Melodic but raw. Check out Backyard Flames, Future Daydream, and Beastly Bit.\n\nPropagandhi – Like Kid Dynamite in my last post, these guys are not pop punk. However, some of their songs have a strong melodic component that people looking to broaden their horizons might want to explore. Less Talk, More Rock is their classic release but a ton of their other CDs are great as well. My personal recommendations to someone hearing them for the first time would be the tracks I Was A Pre-Teen McCarthyist and Ska Sucks.\n\nThe Queers – One of the main bands of the Lookout Records era. They started as raw, offensive, sloppy punk outfit and morphed into a truly genre defining pop punk powerhouse (keeping their offensive lyrics, at least for the most part). Check out Teenage Bonehead, Tamara Is A Punk, No Tit, and Daydreaming for their poppy side and Life This Life and Ben Weasel for when they show their edge.\n\nRiverdales – The guys in Screeching Weasel created this project to create three chord Ramones inspired pop punk. Their self titled debut was incredible and they continued to put out release after release of Ramones inspired goodness. Check out Rehabilitated, Outta Sight, She’s Gonna Break Your Heart, Plan 13, I Don’t Wanna Go To The Party, Riverdale Stomp, Last Stop Tokyo, and Diabolik.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter @Doctordaver\n\nYou may also want to check out stuff I wrote about:\n\nDirect Hit\n\nScreeching Weasel\n\nNOFX\n\nMr. T Experience"
