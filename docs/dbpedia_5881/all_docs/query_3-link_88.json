        "text": "Night Verses, one the best bands to have emerged in the last few years, composed of members from The Sleeping and The Sound Archives. Making an impressive landmark with the release of their EP Out Of The Sky and debut Lift Your Existence. Night Verses have truly created a colossal sound that's really pushing the boundaries and horizons of modern music.\n\nHere's my interview with the band.\n\nWhat is your full name and what do you play in Night Verses?\n\nDouglas Robinson, Vocals.\n\nReilly Herrera, Bass.\n\nAric Improta, Drums and Sampled Percussion.\n\nNick DePirro, Guitar.\n\nHow did Night Verses form and what creative elements does each of you contribute creatively towards the music you make ?\n\nReilly : Night Verses formed after Douglas saw Nick, Aric, and myself play an instrumental set while he was living in LA. He was still in his old band The Sleeping at the time and it took a while for us to officially become Night Verses, but without that night we would have likely never gotten together.\n\nCreatively we each bring something different to the band; Aric brings a lot of initial song ideas, skeletons, feel ideas, and rhythms to our songs. Douglas contributes his emotive style, passion, and natural sense of lyricism & melody. Nick always has a back-stock of riffs, songs, and ideas that we're constantly applying and pulling from.\n\nPersonally I try to creatively fill up space, compliment songs, stay locked in with drum parts, and just write cool sounding bass lines. Generally though - I like to think each of us using our own individual styles as artists/musicians while staying aware of Night Verses' overall goals is the most defining contribution to the music we write.\n\nHow does playing in Night Verses compare to your previous bands, The Sound Archives and The Sleeping? What do you want to do differently or achieve this time around ? -\n\nDouglas : I don't really compare the two when it comes to The Sleeping and Night Verses. However, when it comes to what I do differently… that's another story. I've grown a lot since The Sleeping. I have a whole different outlook and mindset on a lot of things in life, and that's all been from what I've learned throughout my growing process.\n\nReilly: To put it simply, Night Verses is much more focused than any other band I've ever been a part of. While there isn't one specific goal or achievement that comes to mind, I'd just like for us all to be satisfied creatively with each project we work on.. that and not to starve.\n\nHow do you feel that your approach to songwriting and the approach that you take with your instrument has changed since you started playing and whilst playing together in Night Verses?\n\nDouglas:I approach songwriting in a similar fashion as I always have, but I'm constantly learning with Night Verses. It's a great question because I really could go on forever and point out every single detail of what I've changed about myself and what I've taken with me along the way. Just know that I give my voice a much needed love and respect that I never really had for it in the past.\n\nHow are the songs in Night verse written? Please describe the process from A to B and how do you maintain a creative balance between the instrumental parts , dynamic changes and the vocals ? Is there a strict process or do you all have your own way that you prefer to write ? What are you trying to communicate to the listener or the audience with your music?\n\nAric: Our songs usually start with a concept and a rhythm or riff that goes with it. From there Nick, Reilly, and I build together, discussing in which directions we think the song should progress. We jam on it until we’ve exhausted all of each other's individual ideas, until we are completely satisfied with the piece instrumentally. We've spent two hours straight, working on the same section, just to make sure it sounds exactly the way we intended.\n\nThen we record it, listen to it for a week, re-write whatever feels like it could be improved, re-record it, and then send it to Douglas so he can develop initial melodies. We finalise the songs together in a room, bouncing our ideas back and forth and moving the piece into a direction that feels best to all of us. There have been a few exceptions to how we go about songwriting but that’s the process 90% of the time.\n\nAs mentioned in another interview Night Verses initially started as an instrumental band. Were there lots of changes that had to be made in order to fit the vocals in and what was your approach to adding lyrics to the already written instrumental songs? Did you ever think you would ever add a vocalist and how would you describe they way Douglas's involvement has benefitted the sound of Night Verses?\n\nNick: We did operate as an instrumental band for a few years, but always with the goal of finding a vocalist. We would write our songs with the assumption that someone would eventually sing over them, so there wasn’t much that we’d need to change in order to fit vocals in. We put a lot of ourselves into the music we write, but Douglas allows us to push our sound even further in a more intense and emotional way, that you really wouldn’t be able to achieve solely as an instrumental band.\n\nWhat inspired you to become a musician and what was the main focus that lead to pursuing music instead of other career options?\n\nDouglas: This is what I have wanted to do for as far back as I can remember. There was honestly never another career. I feel like when you're a musician… there's really no room for another career. You dive in and don't want to be saved.\n\nHow did you develop your skills as a musician, in terms of musical education or practice? What other musicians/artists/bands have made an influence on the way you play, write and think about music?\n\nAric: We set our personal standards impossibly high and then practiced until we gained enough leeway to set higher standards. All of us were very open to different types of music in our youth and as we got older we all paid close attention to what we naturally gravitated towards and then consciously continued in those directions. As opposed to forcing ourselves to get into music we didn't love, based on the inconsistent opinions of most of our peers.\n\nAs far as influences, we’re inspired by artists that create an undeniably unique aesthetic that helps escalate their genre to another level. We've learned to be as observant as possible and every time a piece of art moves us (whatever the medium) we find a way to recognise the captivating quality and attempt to integrate it into our music.\n\nDo you have a practice routine or any skills you are currently working on and what advice can you pass on to other musicians?\n\nReilly: Currently I'm just working on being a more creative bass player and writing memorable but complementary bass parts. Right now I'm working on my left hand's dexterity because we just wrote a really fast part that's giving me trouble. Advice depends on what your goals are as a musician. For example, when practicing for Night Verses songs I routinely play to Aric's drum tracks over and over so I know all my lines are locked in right and feel good.\n\nAs mentioned in a previous interview you said the film Beyond The Black Rainbow was one of the main inspirations behind Lift Your Existence? Can you describe how and how do you think the final content of Lift Your Existence would have turned out if you had not seen it? Where else did you draw inspiration or influence from? What also was the recording and writing process for Lift Your Existence and how does it compare to the way you worked on Out Of The Sky ?\n\nNick: The main difference between the writing of Lift Your Existence and Out of the Sky, is that we wrote the songs on Out of the Sky before joining with Douglas. When we began to write for Lift Your Existence we had a clear idea of the sound we wanted to achieve, and we were able to focus on pushing specific elements of our playing even more. We also lived in the studio for a month during the recording of Lift Your Existence, as opposed to a few days for Out of the Sky. It allowed us to go more in depth with the details of our songs and really focus on our performances while recording.\n\nAs far as Beyond the Black Rainbow being an influence, we did pre-production/demos for every song on the record before going into the studio so the film wasn’t an influence on the creation of the songs. It was more of an influence on our mood, certain sounds on the record, and the overall flow of the record from song to song.\n\nHow would you describe the reaction to Lift Your Existence and are there any plans to write a follow up? If so what can we expect to your next release to sound like? Will there be any chance of releasing any songs that didn't appear on the album as in your interview withBeardedGentlemen.Com Nick stated you had a collection of fifty songs or can these songs be found on Nick's soundcloud page?\n\nAric: The reception has been amazing. It is exactly who we were at the time we wrote it and it’s awesome to see that there are people who completely understand what we are creating and why we are creating it. As far as a follow up, we are always in the process of writing new material, both on the road and at home. It will definitely happen, it’s just a case of when we feel that it’s ready.\n\nWhen it comes to our b-sides, we are perfectionists, so if they didn't make the album it’s for specific personal reasons. There may be a few parts we update to fit into new compositions, but we love writing and are constantly evolving, so I think any old material would feel outdated in comparison to what will be featured on the next release. Currently, the next album sounds like a satellite falling from the sky, crashing into the ocean, and then sinking to the bottom.\n\nIn reference to Nick's soundcloud, that is a chalkboard of all the ideas Nick develops outside the practice room. So even with 5 days a week of writing w/ Night Verses, he still takes it upon himself to produce albums worth of material on his own. Our practices/writing sessions are very focused and concept driven. I think that for Nick his soundcloud is a way for him to get out whatever creative impulses he has without being hindered by the stern boundaries of expectation that we set for each other when collaborating. Fortunately for us it's usually all up for grabs. If there is something we hear from his page that we want to expand on, he’s almost always more than willing to develop it further at practice.\n\nIs there any chance of Nick creating a solo album since he has a lot of demos on Soundcloud or will these songs be used in Night Verses future releases?\n\nNick: Nothing I post on my Soundcloud is intended for Night Verses, but from time to time a riff or part will translate into one of our songs. I write the songs on my Soundcloud for fun, but I would like to eventually create a formal release.\n\nWill there be any chance of an official tab book for any of your releases?\n\nNick: Possibly in the future, but there is no official plan to release a tab book at the moment.\n\nWhat albums are you currently listening to and when was the last time you saw a band that surpassed everything you thought was possible with music?\n\nDouglas: Currently, I've been listening to The Cure nonstop. I hardly ever find new music that really satisfies me. I wish that wasn't the case, but it is. I've also been listening to The Life and Times a lot. They're an older band but they just put out a new record and it's really great.\n\nAs for anything new, the last band that surpassed everything I thought possible with music was seeing Nick, Reilly and Aric as their instrumental band. I genuinely fell in love with them as a fan of their band before any of this ever happened. I'm very fortunate. I feel like it was meant to be.\n\nReilly: I’ve been listening to The Menzingers album 'Rented World', Palms, 2Pac, Doomriders, and The American Scene a lot lately. The last time I saw a band that surpassed everything I thought possible with music was Godspeed You! Black Emperor in 2012.\n\nDo you think that progressive and experimental music is becoming more widely acceptable and that fans of music have a music higher expectation of what bands are expected to deliver? If so then why? How would you also describe the impact your music makes?\n\nAric: I think it's starting to bleed into fans of specific genres (metal, electronic, etc.) and those fans expectations definitely seem to be consistently lifting and evolving with each year's delivery of new material. Especially since the cycle of artistic evolution is rotating faster and faster with the accessibility that the internet provides. Today when someone comes up with a creative idea there are ten different tutorial videos a click away thoroughly explaining how an artist achieved their specific sound/vision/concept.\n\nHaving so many people obsess over dissecting a concept or technique forces artists to push themselves into evolving at an unnatural pace. With the current speed of production, and some artist’s lack of integrity, its sadly become all to common to see a beautiful piece of art become cliche' and outdated within the same year it's released. Ideas and styles are copied before they are ever fully realised/developed by their initial creators. Meanwhile, on a massive scale, progressive music is still quite distant from its full potential of public appeal.\n\nMost experimental/progressive artists haven't found a way to break through to the mainstream the way bands like Pink Floyd, Rush, and Tool did. As far as our impact, I think there is a handful of people who truly connect with what we are doing and we are beyond grateful to see that kind of reaction. However, the ultimate goal is to operate on a scale as admirable as those three bands though we don’t expect that to come until we are much further along in the process of developing our sound.\n\nHow do you feel music is changing for our generation and how do you think it will change in the next five to ten years?\n\nDouglas : It's a difficult question but what I've learned is to really pay no mind to where it is. I just want us to be a part of how it changes. Music, like anything else, always has its ups and downs but what matters to me is that I get to make art with three of my best friends and travel the world doing it.\n\nAric: I believe that musicians are becoming too dependent on computers to do a large portion of their work. And though I thoroughly understand the convenience, I feel as though it skips critical steps in the process of developing a unique style. Many musicians are now emulating the attack of a machine rather than feeling their way towards their goal. They're replacing their subtleties with samples and, often times, recording moments and dynamics that are physically impossible to recreate live.\n\nThere is definitely a time and place for computers in music. However, as time goes on, and more and more musicians accept this process as the standard instead of an aesthetic choice, I feel as though it will further dilute society's creativity and variety. Musicians will strive to imitate the same rigid perfection that they hear played back to them through their laptop speakers, rather than the emotionally charged & unifying pulse that's value has been present in nearly every form of music up until now.\n\nAs a vocalist how do you prepare for a live set as the the way you sing has a lot of dynamic range. Are there any exercises or warm up techniques you have to run through to ensure you don't damage your voice? Is there any advice you can give to vocalist too ?\n\nDouglas: I don't really do anything vocally. I just run a lot before our shows. I honestly think that's way better than sitting in a room singing for thirty minutes before you have to go out and sing for thirty minutes to an hour anyway. I've tried warming up my vocal chords like that and it just doesn't work for me. When you're in front of people and your nerves are going… the last place you want to pull inspiration or tactics from is a boring room that you're by yourself in. I feel more energetic and ready to sing when I go for long jogs and surround myself with the sights. Obviously, jogging is also great for breathing, which is great for singing.\n\nCan we expect a signature PRS guitar to be developed since you've signed to them as an artist? If so what features would you like to include on your own model?\n\nNick: If I were to have my own signature model, I would want to create a 24 fret baritone version of my Satin 22. That would be the only guitar I’d ever need.\n\nYou can download and buy Night Verses music and merchandise from:\n\nhttp://nightverses.bigcartel.com/\n\nFollow their Facebook at:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NightVerses\n\nTwitter\n\nhttp://www.NightVerses.com http://www.twitter.com/NightVerses\n\nYoutube\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/NightVersesOfficial\n\nInstagram:\n\nhttp://www.instagram.com/NightVerses\n\nTumblr"
