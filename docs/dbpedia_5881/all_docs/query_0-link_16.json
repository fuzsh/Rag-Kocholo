        "meta_description": "Live in Tulsa by Tumbledown, released 24 March 2016\n\n1. Intro\n2. I&#39;m Still Here\n3. Came Here to Fight\n4. Movin&#39; On\n5. Butcher of San Antone\n6. Son of a Gun\n7. Lonesome\n8. Let&#39;s Drink\n9. State Line\n10. Mini Tats Intro\n11. Mini Tats\n12. Rock &amp; Roll Girl\n13. Homeward Bound\n\nIf you get hooked on a band through their studio albums, you run the risk of being disappointed if they can’t pull off the same magic in concert. Luckily for me, Tumbledown’s Live In Tulsa proves that these guys are no studio creation, as they become even more talented and rowdy in a live setting. Recorded at The Marquee last September, Live In Tulsa perfectly captures four guys playing their brand of down home, country-flavored rockabilly for an enthusiastic crowd of club patrons. I admittedly wasn’t surprised that Tumbledown is an incredible live band since I’ve seen Mike Herrera in concert many times before with MxPx. - My So Called Soundtrack",
