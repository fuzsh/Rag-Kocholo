Any bully has more character-building effects on you than the most moving of books.”\n\nWhat books are currently on your night stand?\n\n“A Hedonist Manifesto,” by Michel Onfray, and the stupendous “Septimania,” by Jonathan Levi, are almost done. Han Kang’s “The Vegetarian” and “The Cosmic Web,” by J. Richard Gott, are next.\n\nWhat’s the last great book you read?\n\nI went back with a group of N.Y.U. students to Suetonius’ “The Lives of the Twelve Caesars” — still my favorite piece of journalism, published some 1,800 years before the invention of journalism. At a certain age, most of the true great books you read are books you are reading again. These days I am working through a long poem, “First Dream,” by Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz — a 17th-century nun who wrote in Mexico City to imperial acclaim. But there are, too, contemporary books that leave you the feeling that you read something great. I finished this past weekend Darryl Pinckney’s stunning “Black Deutschland.”"
