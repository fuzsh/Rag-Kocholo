        "text": "Shane Told, lead singer of Silverstein joins Mike this week.\n\nShane Told has a story to tell and he does it well, first with his band Silverstein, but second his solo material River Oaks, or now his recent endeavor into the fray of podcasting with a great show called Lead Singer Syndrome where he talks to… yup, lead singers about the craft, the life, the layers of the people you listen to sing their hearts out. It's a great concept and I'm gonna be on the program soon enough. Stay tuned for that as well. Here's a little bio from his page but the sure way to enlightenment is to listen to this episode.\n\n\"What is it like to be one of the most important members of a band? Shane Told, frontman of the critically-acclaimed rock band Silverstein, brings you candid interviews with all of your favorite singers on this podcast. Is it really all sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll? Find out for yourself on Lead Singer Syndrome.\" - http://www.jabberjawmedia.com/lead-singer-syndrome\n\nIn this episode we know we are being watched and listened to but you'll have to listen to really grasp the creepiness of what we are talking about.\n\nThis is also the first episode of the Mike Herrera Hour in collaboration with Jabber Jaw. It's a way to collaborate more on the podcasting end of things. I like what Shane is doing and I'm liking the Break it Down Podcast with Matt Carter. In terms of content, those two shows go with my show pretty well. So we're all in good company. Another easy way to get to the show and other great shows.

The benefit gig with Goldfinger, Mike and Travis. He also talks about recording with Matt Skiba after Tom Delonge’s exit. Business, Crossroads Restaurant in LA, family life with his kids, MTV reality show, how surviving a plane crash changed his life perspective, drug abuse, relationships and tons more!\n\nMHH153- Travis was on his way home from Blink 182 rehearsals when I got a chance to catch up with him on the phone. We talked about a ton of topics. We got into his day to day routines to bigger sweeping life changes and that includes some behind the scenes talk on making the new Blink 182 album with record producer and Goldfinger front man, John Feldmann.\n\nThey just released the first single off the album called, Bored to Death. It sounds really good and I love how open the verses are. Just go to Blink182.com to check it out.\n\nIf the photos below confuse you and you are wondering what this band is with Travis, Feldy, Frank (Feeble) and yours truly is. It was called Travis Barker and the Res-Erections (hehe). A one off cover band throwing down with some 80's and 90's music. A loose set of fun cover songs punked up and a few Goldfinger jams too. We got together for a benefit show to raise funds for the school that Travis' kids attend. It was a really fun night and rad times were had by all. The audience saw something pretty insane that night! And yes, sometimes you just get a phone call from a friend asking for a favor and you find yourself on a non-stop flight to Los Angeles to lay down some low end. I love this life and not really knowing what's gonna happen all the time is part of what makes it so exciting. Scary too but if you aren't a little afraid of the possibilities then maybe you aren't reaching outside your comfort zone enough.\n\nMike and Travis will talk why cruise ships are better than airplanes, killer remixes, and the new Blink-182 record. Forget Meet the Barkers you’re about to see a whole new side of Travis as he reveals the pleasures and the pain that shaped him into a music icon. Did we mention tune-in? Tune-in and tell your friends!\n\nFind him on Twitter: @travisbarker and @blink182.\n\nTopics-\n\nBlink-182 rehearsals, work ethic and passion for music, Travis’ love for hip-hop and his career into that after Blink- 182 and The Transplants broke up.
