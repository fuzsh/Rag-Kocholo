        "text": "By Bill Mickelson For The Kitsap Sun\n\nSome bands thrive in small, intimate clubs and venues. Others fit better in bigger rooms and concert halls. Some fit best in arenas or giant outdoor stages in front of thousands.Â\n\nSomewhere in the mix, there's also the awkward genre of summer festival and county fair bands. The top-40s groups. The tribute bands. The cover bands. The cover bands that mix in some originals. The aging local legends.Â\n\nOver the past 40 years, longtime Seattle band Jr. Cadillac ? which headlines Day 3 of Whaling Days in Silverdale July 25 ? has played them all.Â\n\n\"What happens is, the bars don't pay anything,\" Jr. Cadillac lead singer-guitarist-founder Ned Neltner said. \"And we're this sort of dinosaur in that we have a crew and seven musicians, so we have to make a certain small sum of money. And the clubs just don't do it. Â\n\n\"So these small town festivals ? you know, we do Whaling Days in Silverdale, we do the Renton River Days, we do this, that and the other days ? that has been our meat and potatoes for about the past 15 years,\" Neltner said.\n\nThey're the quintessential Northwest summertime festival band. On Whaling Days weekend alone, Jr. Cadillac is set to play the Anacortes Art Fair and Renton's River Days before coming to Silverdale on Sunday. Later this summer, they'll play a concert aboard a floating stage on Lake Couer d'Alene in Idaho.Â\n\nThey're one of only three bands residing outside of Kitsap on this year's locally focused Whaling Days lineup. But the storied Seattle band has history in Bremerton that date back decades.Â\n\n\"Nobody in the band is from that side of the water at all,\" Neltner said, \"but for some reason or another there were some seminal gigs there ... something that put memories in people's minds, and also in ours.\"\n\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary for the band, bringing a flood of reminiscence and \"I remember when's,\" which were abundant at the band's sold-out 40th birthday show July 10 at the Triple Door in Seattle (one night after opening Bremerton's Concerts on the Boardwalk series). That same nostalgia might well permeate the evening air on the last night of Whaling Days.Â\n\nHere's a rundown of the local talent which might inspire a whole new set of \"I remember when's\" for the next generation on for the main stage at this year's Whaling Days. All shows are free, all ages at waterfront park in Old Town Silverdale. More on on the whole shebang at www.whalingdays.com.\n\nwhalingdays.com\n\nJuly 23\n\nSoul Siren\n\nKitsap alt/rock band Soul Siren kicks off what Whaling Days entertainment co-coordinator Sunny Saunders-Housen describes as a distinctly locally focused main stage line up, crafted in response to crowd feedback from the festival calling for more local bands. 6 to 7:30 p.m.\n\nErotic City\n\nOne of just three out-of-town bands on the Whaling Days docket, Portland's Erotic City, a band labeled \"the West Coast's premiere Prince tribute,\" headlines the first night of festivities. Calling on the purplest of hits from \"Purple Rain\" to \"Little Red Corvette,\" all the way down to the song from which the tribute band takes its name, frontman-doppelganger Julian Stefon and crew flamboyantly invoke the artist formerly, fondly and forever known as Prince. 8 to 10 p.m. myspace.com/eroticcity.\n\nJuly 24\n\nSub-Serious\n\nThere comes a time in some musicians' lives when they must leave the music behind to focus on family or career. But most musicians can never fully leave the music behind ? like these guys: Sub-Serious, a classic Kitsap band whose members have mutual Navy ties and sonic hobbies of good tunes and good times. 12:30 to 1:15 p.m.. myspace.com/subserious.\n\nZ-Rexx and the Ninjas\n\nMatching hot licks and big riffs, classic covers and original songs, this Kitsap-rooted party rock band has been cranking it out for years in South Kitsap's small clubs, and on the small-town festival circuit. Zane Olesen ? the six-string-wielding Z-Rexx in the equation ? has been cranking for even longer, honing his chops in a host of hair bands over the past two decades, keeping the dinosaur alive. 1:30 to 215 p.m. zrexxandtheninjas.com.\n\nThe Soulstice Band\n\nDoubling as Kitsap's leading Fleetwood Mac tribute, Soulstice has strong roots in the south county, stemming back to and beyond the former House of Soulstice ? a South Kitsap style House of Blues, situated on the shore of Sinclair Inlet, along the back stretches of Bay Street, until it closed down a few years back. 2:30 to 3:30 p.m. myspace.com/thehouseofsoulstice.\n\nColdnote\n\n\"Coldnote creates dancing machines,\" the Kitsap-based funk-soul band's Web site reads under a picture of one of their infamous Filling Station gigs in Kingston. A Whaling Days returnee and band of North Kitsap kids, Coldnote has been a regular on Kitsap's summer festival circuit and the Seattle club scene over the past four years, bringing the party with its blend of funk, soul and classic covers on top of original grooves. 4 to 5:30 p.m. myspace.com/coldnote1.\n\nTumbledown\n\nLater this summer, Mike Herrera's Tumbledown ? the local alt-country-punkabilly project forged by the singer-songwriter of the seminal Bremerton band MxPx and the indelible talents of the former Rocky Point All-Stars ? will take its first tour across South America. The local music magnates are known to tour far more than they play locally, but before they head south for the summer, the band will bring its mix of drinking songs and Americana to the hometown crowd as the sun sets on Silverdale. 6 to 7:30 p.m. tumbledownhq.com.\n\nThe Joey James Dean Band\n\nNearly as much of a Whaling Days institution as the Great Duck Race, the Joey James Dean Band has been a main stage mainstay for as long as many can remember: Saunders-Housen couldn't put a finger on the exact number of years, but surmises it's been at least 10. Behind the local Top-40-seasoned frontman Joey James Dean, the group is Kitsap's own quintessential summer festival band, packing a keg-fueled combo of classic covers, party songs and dance numbers. 8 to 10 p.m. joeyjamesdean.com.\n\nJuly 25\n\nHD Fusion\n\nExemplifying the term \"fusion\" in both the musical and literal sense, HD Fusion was born in 1986 around the bond between then-16 year old classically trained pianist Mike Dullum and jazz-funk-R&B percussionist-bassist Tony Handy, a sixth-generation nephew of the father of St. Louis blues. The band has blended its own brand of progressive jazz, appearing in coffee shops and cocktail lounges around Kitsap. Noon to 1 p.m. hdfusion.com.\n\nThe Boot Hill Band\n\nA new project from distinguished and dynamic local musician-soundman Tom Pike, the Boot Hill Band will get some its first widespread exposure under the midday sun of Day 3. Expect roots, wisdom and deft musicianship from a band of local music veterans. 1:15 to 2:15 p.m.\n\nScott Kirby\n\nDrawing natural comparisons to Jimmy Buffet, Key West, Florida-based crooner Scott Kirby exudes both a love for music and the water ? which is fitting for the Whaling Days' stage perched along a backdrop of Dyes Inlet near the moorage in Old Town Silverdale. 2:30 to 3:30 p.m. scottkirby.com.
