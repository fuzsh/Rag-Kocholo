        "text": "I went to that tour, yeah... it was a weird lineup... vendetta red was the opener - then brand new, mxpx, dashboard. mxpx was great and they got a good reception from the crowd, but they were the odd man out on that bill for sure!\n\nThey just released a free song in their newsletter. I think it's a decent song, reminds me of \"Plans Within Plans\", maybe not at the top of their game, but decent though.\n\nsong\n\nOn topic: anyone have seen the \"Left Coast Live\" DVD? I know it was released back in May only for the backers, but there is no information online about it. I wish this band get more promotion once again.\n\nMike Herrera of MxPx (Encore Episode 158) • chorus.fm\n\nAs some of you may know, I started AbsolutePunk.net over 15 years ago as an MxPx and Blink-182 fan-page. Those were the first two bands I truly loved. They shaped my entire music taste and starting that website changed my life. I wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for those bands and those albums. Listening to “Doing Time” as a teenager gave me hope. Discovering pop-punk music and the community around it made me feel like I belonged to something special. Small, right outside of the mainstream, but undeniably special. The music was unlike anything I was listening to at the time and hit me right when I needed it most.\n\nLast week MxPx released their new, self-titled, album. It’s their first album since 2012. Today, I’m excited to debut a new episode of Encore featuring lead singer Mike Herrera. This episode is a joint episode with Mike’s podcast, “The Mike Herrera Podcast,” which I also recommend subscribing to and checking out. In this episode we go deep on the new album. We talk about the recording process, the inspiration behind the songs, and then I walk through each song with Mike and get his thoughts on different aspects. I share some thoughts too, but mostly I was trying to get at what made this album feel so fresh, and yet so wholly MxPx, here in 2018.\n\nSo I just started listening to the podcast... had to do a major double take when I saw Jason Tate as a guest. Lmao. Crazy\n\nBut I have to say idk if I'm totally feeling it. Honestly, mike's not that great of a host. At least, hes not that great of an interviewer. He jumps around a lot and goes off on tangents which can be fun but then we lose track of the stories.\n\nLike I listened to the tsunami bomb Emily interview and there's like a billion questions I wanted to hear...especially about the breakup, which she eluded to being a lot more interesting than I though... but the topic got dropped.\n\nIdk it's very close to being what I want... a behind the scenes look at punk life from a business and personal point of view... but its falling short"
