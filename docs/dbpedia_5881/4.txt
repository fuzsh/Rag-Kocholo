Mike Herrera — bassist, lead vocalist, and songwriter for pop-punk band MxPx — is usually known for his punk-inspired tunes. But Tumbledown, his alternative country band, shows a softer side. In an acoustic recording of Tumbledown’s song, “Son of a Gun,” Herrera shows off his skills on the acoustic guitar accompanied by his melodic vocals. Who knew that punk rock and country were so interchangeable?

While releasing the new track, Herrera took to YouTube to announced that the entire Tumbledown catalog will be rereleased to all streaming services, as well as unreleased recordings from their Empty Bottle sessions.
