Learn to spot bad weather and report it during a free training session on April 13. Llano County is hosting the National Weather Service Skywarn program at the Sunrise Beach Village Civic Center, 124 Sunrise Drive.

Participants completing the program can then report developing weather to the NWS through its online portal.

An NWS meteorologist will teach the class with support from Llano County Emergency Management Coordinator Gilbert Bennett.

“We’re looking for volunteers interested in the weather and helping their community,” Bennett told DailyTrib.com.

Training will focus on the basics of thunderstorm development and structure, identifying potential severe weather features, what information should be reported, how to report that information, and the basics of severe weather safety.

The National Weather Service started the Skywarn program in the 1970s and has since accumulated nearly 400,000 volunteer severe weather spotters. The program has drastically improved the service’s timeliness and accuracy when issuing severe weather warnings.

Llano County is no stranger to severe storms, Bennett said, and the ensuing flash floods that periodically cause devastation throughout the region.

Spaces in the training session are limited. To sign up, email Bennett at gbennett@co.llano.tx.us.
