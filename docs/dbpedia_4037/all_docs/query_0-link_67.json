        "text": "The threat of potential flooding has officials in Llano County on high alert. Llano Precinct 3 County Commissioner Mike Sandoval says crews are on standby throughout the county and barriers have been moved into place.\n\nBut while defenses are up, the level of concern remains low Tuesday afternoon. As water rushes underneath a small bridge along County Road 307, it shows a sign of the heavy rains hitting the area.\n\n“I hope no houses come down. No one up underwater,” says Nick George.\n\nGeorge is one of the managers of Wakepoint Properties in Kingsland. He’s hopeful the rains won’t cause any issues to the docks outside the property and nearby restaurant.\n\n“I think they’ll flood. I don’t think they’ll be downstream at the end of it no,” he said.\n\nGeorge adds to knock on wood and says if anything, the lingering rain in the area is just keeping customers from eating outside on the patio at the restaurant for the time being.\n\n25 minutes northwest, the heavy rains over Llano are something Mayor Marion Bishop says they’ve been preparing for.\n\n“Preparations are trying to close off low water crossings and so forth within the city and the surrounding areas of the county to make sure we don’t have anybody drowning,” said Bishop.\n\nSandoval says he’s not too concerned that the area he represents will be affected too poorly aside from some flooding. Officials are hoping to avoid a catastrophe like what happened in 2018.\n\nSix years ago, the FM 2900 bridge collapsed in Llano County due to severe flooding of the Llano River. George says his parents were there.\n\n“They watched it. They had a video of it and it was just loud,” he said.\n\nBishop says lessons were learned that day, and with water levels expected to rise and cause flooding overnight, there will be boat rescue teams on standby, along with road closures and barriers set up.\n\n“We have crews ready to take care of whatever needs we have,” said Bishop.\n\nOn its Tuesday afternoon, the city of Llano announced West Sandstone from Mallone to Lauderdale would be shut down due to expected flood waters.\n\nYou can keep track of the weather by downloading the CBS Austin Weather App. It’s available for free in the Apple and Google Play stores."
