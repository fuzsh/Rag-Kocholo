Black lines or No traffic flow lines could indicate a closed road, but in most cases it means that either there is not enough vehicle flow to register or traffic isn't monitored. Also, If you do not see traffic flow, you can zoom in closer to reveal localized data. If you are unable to pan the map, press here (to focus off of the map) and try again.\n\nTraffic Incidents (beta): Each image represents traffic event or incident such as road construction, closure (red circle with a white dash) or accident."
