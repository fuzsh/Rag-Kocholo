Use the menu to pick what information to show from USGS gauges along the rivers.\n\nUSGS | National Water Dashboard\n\nAccess river level and other water information and weather conditions in your neighborhood!

So some localized places got a LOT of rain in a short time.\n\nLCRA HYDROMET\n\nLCRAâ€™s Hydromet is a system of more than 275 automated river and weather gauges throughout the lower Colorado River basin in Texas. The Hydromet provides near-real-time data* on streamflow, river stage, rainfall totals, temperature and humidity."
