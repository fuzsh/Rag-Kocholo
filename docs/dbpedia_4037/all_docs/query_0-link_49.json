        "text": "Jaw-dropping awe, cheers of sheer joy and moments of reverent silence followed the path of a total solar eclipse across the country Monday.\n\nPeople in all 48 states in the continental U.S. had a chance to see at least a partial eclipse, with millions in the path of totality. Some spots were blocked by clouds, while others had amazing views.\n\nHere are our live updates as the eclipse played out from Mexico to Maine.\n\nF​rom weather.com senior news editor Dave Siff:\n\nBobby and Carrin Carlisle traveled from Atlanta to Mazatlan, Mexico, to experience totality in person. Here's how Carrin described it to us in an interview shortly after:\n\n\"The whole thing, it happened, 4 and half minutes. It felt like it was 25 seconds.\n\nEveryone started screaming to begin with. And then totality happened and we looked over the ocean, and the colors on the ocean, you didn't even know where to look.\n\nIt was so, almost overstimulating, just wanting to see everything. And people were hugging and kissing and yelling and it was just, it was an amazing experience.\"\n\nThe couple started laying out their trip right after a partial solar eclipse under cloudy skies in Atlanta in 2017.\n\nAnd now? They’re planning for the next total solar eclipse in the U.S. in 20 years. But in the meantime, they hope to “chase” eclipses in other parts of the world.\n\nIn a unique view, Red Bull aerobatic pilots Kevin Coleman and Pete McCleod flew above Sulphur Springs, Texas, as the moon's shadow passed across a cloudy sky. photographer Dustin Snipes of ‘Dunk the Sun’ fame captured them soar and stunt their way alongside the most visible US eclipse in 100 years.\n\nY​ou'll have to wait until August 2044 and the path of totality will only pass through Montana and the Dakotas. Another eclipse a year later will carve a coast-to-coast path of totality.\n\nF​rom weather.com writer Jenn Jordan:\n\nPeople in the path of totality in Strongsville, Ohio, didn't hold back in celebrating.\n\n\"Neighbors were shooting off fireworks and people were cheering, it was like a cooler Fourth of July,\" Allison Wrabel, watching from Strongsville, told us.\n\nWrabel added that the view of the sun's corona was crisper than she expected.\n\n\"The lighting was so different than a sunset or at night because the coverage happened so quickly and you could still see the sun from areas that weren’t in totality.\"\n\nStudents at teachers at D.A. Hulcy Middle School in Dallas watched the last sliver of the sun disappear. Outside in a parking lot, they yelled and cheered.\n\n“I’m a new person,” eighth grader Nia Modkins told The Associated Press.\n\nEighth grader Sky Johnson scrolled through her phone looking at video she took a​s daylight came back.\n\n“Two minutes of me screaming, literally,” she said.\n\nP​eople in Rangeley, Maine, and Houlton, Maine, are currently experiencing about 2.5 minutes of totality. They'll be among the last in the U.S. to see the total solar eclipse.\n\n\"​It was like a storm was coming in,\" Michelle DeCamp, who lives in New Haven, Indiana, told us. \"Kind of an eerie feeling.\"\n\nD​eCamp's area, right outside of Fort Wayne, experienced 99.9% totality.\n\n\"​You could hear all the dogs barking right at the moment of totality,\" she said.\n\nIn Carbondale, Illinois, Norma Klingsick watched with a crowd yelling cheers of awe and excitement.\n\n\"​It was so crazy how the temperature just dropped and a wind picked up,\" Klingsick told us. \"Just incredible.\"\n\nRetinal burns, or “eclipse blindness,” can happen after staring at the sun without proper eye protection for only a few seconds. The condition is called solar retinopathy, and can cause permanent damage.\n\nOne extreme example happened to a woman who watched the 2017 total solar eclipse in the U.S. for about 15 or 20 seconds. Doctors found a burn on her retina that closely resembled the crescent shape of a partial eclipse. The woman suffered permanent eye damage.\n\nH​ere's a look at some of the symptoms and what to do if you think your eyes are damaged from the eclipse.\n\nF​rom weather.com digital meteorologist Madeline Scheinost:\n\nWe are seeing some rain showers pop up in parts of the South and along the Gulf Coast. There is some cloud cover in the same general area, and in parts of the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.\n\nIn the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, a low pressure system is bringing some light rain and overcast skies.\n\nP​eople in Mazatlan, Mexico, just experienced more than 4 minutes of totality. Here's what it looked like in a photo from NASA.\n\nW​e're putting all the best photos from today into this slideshow. Be sure to check back often as we update while the path of totality crosses 15 states.\n\nT​he sun is starting to disappear along the path of totality in Texas and Arkansas. Meanwhile, people in other parts of the U.S. have staked out their spots and are waiting patiently.\n\n\"Very excited,\" viewer Carmen Russo writes from Rangely, Maine. \"Tons of people in this sleepy town and clear skies!\"\n\nT​he entire eclipse will last more than two hours in some spots.\n\nWe’re sharing NASA’s livestream for anyone who can’t watch the eclipse in person. You can view it here.\n\nT​he eclipse will enter skies over the U.S. in about 10 minutes near Eagle Pass, Texas. Totality will happen there around 2:27 p.m. Eastern time, or 1:27 p.m. local time. It will last for about 4 minutes.\n\n\"​Bill Nye The Science Guy\" spoke to The Weather Channel live in Fredericksburg, Texas. Here's his advice for anyone watching:\n\n\"​Everybody wants to take pictures, right? Everybody wants to take selfies, constantly, constantly. So just today, try to be in the moment.\"\n\nF​rom weather.com writer Renee Straker:\n\nDepending on where you live, you could see some changes in your outdoor plants during the eclipse.\n\nResearchers have found that some plants will react as if it’s dusk, and their flowers or buds may close. Leaves may also fold or curl up because of the change in temperature and light.\n\nNASA says there may even be changes in the sap flow of your plants.\n\nThe University of Missouri-Columbia studied a variety of plants during the 2017 eclipse and they’ll be collecting new data during today’s event.\n\nT​he start of the eclipse in Mazatlan, Mexico, is about 15 minutes away.\n\nF​rom there, the eclipse will spread into Texas and then across the U.S. up to Maine. It will take just over 90 minutes for the path of totality to race about 4,000 miles, according to The Associated Press.\n\n“How cool that we have the opportunity to experience it in this digital age, that we can share it with the world,” Valeria Rosas, watching in Mazatlan, told the AP.\n\nF​rom weather.com senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman:\n\nIn areas where there will at least be significant coverage of the sun, you may notice a bit of a chill during the eclipse.\n\nIn general, expect temperatures to drop at least 5 degrees in the path of totality during the peak of the eclipse. That will be most pronounced in areas with little cloud cover and low humidity.\n\nAs the eclipse ends, increasing sunshine should send temperatures right back up.\n\nAs weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Belles wrote, this is common in solar eclipses and was observed in southern Illinois in the August 2017 event.\n\nYou may have noticed this in your hourly forecast on The Weather Channel app. Computer models and forecasts take this “eclipse cooling” into account.\n\nIt’s one of the rare times you’ll see the temperature tick down in the heart of the day without a cold front, breeze off cooler water or precipitation falling.\n\nP​eople in Mexico's central coastal city of Mazatlan will be among the first in North America to see the eclipse. It looks like a beautiful day there.\n\nF​rom weather.com senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman:\n\nWhile monitoring weather in the U.S. and around the world, I usually don’t pay too close attention to the intricate details of clouds except in, say, tropical cyclones.\n\nToday is a notable exception. I’m watching several areas including the Plains, Midwest and Northeast where there are notable boundaries between clearer skies and clouds. That could be the difference between a clear view of the eclipse and one that is at least partially veiled or completely obscured.\n\nYou can monitor where clouds and rain are as the eclipse unfolds using our map tracker page.\n\n\"T​he word 'eclipse' comes from a Greek word which means 'to abandon.' During a total solar eclipse, when the sun gets dark during daylight, I can see how it looks like the sun has abandoned the earth,\" Greeley said.\n\n\"People have been studying and observing solar eclipses in various forms for thousands of years and they've passed down different descriptions and stories through the generations to describe this awesome phenomenon.\"\n\nW​hat eclipse watchers see today depends entirely on the weather.\n\nOur meteorologists have put together a series of maps and radar images to help you track what's happening in real time.\n\nC​heck it out here.\n\nF​rom weather.com writer Jenn Jordan:\n\nIn a double whammy of rare celestial timing, today's total solar eclipse will coincide with a super new moon.\n\nThe new moon part isn't surprising. This just means the moon's orbit puts it directly between the sun and Earth, which is the reason for the eclipse.\n\nIt's just good luck that this is happening at the same time as a Supermoon, which is when a full moon swings its closest to Earth during orbit. The closer proximity to Earth makes the moon appear larger. Usually a Supermoon glides just above or below the sun, but because it's also a new moon, it will line up, straight on. The moon's bigger appearance could add a few seconds, or even minutes to the eclipse, depending on where you are.\n\nOfficials in Burnet County, Texas, have called off an eclipse festival today over weather concerns. The announcement was made about an hour ago.\n\nB​urnet County is located in the path of totality northwest of Austin. The area will experience more than 4 minutes of totality, according to NASA.\n\nP​eople who flocked to the area are being asked to prepare to leave campgrounds and venues, and shuttle buses and other event-related activities have been halted.\n\nKansas Highway Patrol Trooper Ben Gardner has this advice for anyone who might be on the road during the eclipse: \"​Get off the ramp, find a parking lot. Take it in somewhere where there's not cars driving by really fast. And, in particular, don't get out of your vehicle on the interstate.\"\n\nT​his live map will update throughout the day.\n\nThe rockets will lift off from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia at 45-minute intervals starting at 2:40 p.m. EDT.\n\nEach about 55 feet tall, they’re carrying special equipment into the ionosphere.\n\nTemperature and other characteristics of the ionosphere shift at sunset. That process will be rapidly sped up during the eclipse, creating a rush of atmospheric waves that will help scientists learn more about disruptions in the ionosphere that can interfere with satellite signals and radio frequencies.\n\nY​ou can read more about the experiment here.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers aboard a Gulfstream V aircraft from the National Science Foundation will watch the eclipse from an altitude of 47,000 feet.\n\nD​ays ago, Vermont State Parks posted a list of parks that would be great for viewing the eclipse. However, on Friday, the agency said:\n\n\"​The following previously listed state parks are no longer recommended eclipse viewing areas: Emerald Lake, Little River.\"\n\nI​n a tweet sent this morning, Vermont State Parks revealed that the reason for excluding those two parks was because of tree damage following last week's snowstorm.\n\nA​s Masters Week gets underway in Augusta, Georgia, WSB-TV (Atlanta) sports anchor Zach Klein shared on social media that all patrons who enter the gates for viewing of today's practice round will receive eclipse glasses.\n\nI​n a tweet sent earlier this morning, the Masters Tournament said:\n\n\"​Today's solar eclipse will be visible from Augusta National starting at 1:50 p.m. Maximum obscuration will be 76.1% at 3:08 p.m. and the eclipse will end at 4:32 p.m. Optimal viewing position: Amen Corner.\"\n\nDogs, cats and even horses might be confused by the sudden change in daylight conditions. Human excitement over the eclipse might make them feel anxious, too.\n\nExperts recommend keeping pets inside with the blinds closed. Consider creating a cozy space and offering distractions like treats and toys.\n\nI​t's a common question right now; luckily, we have an answer.
