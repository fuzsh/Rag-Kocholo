        "text": "It has been a loud night for Texas’s Central, South-Central, and Southern portions. Thunderstorms have returned to the state, and they put on a show. Several inches of rain fell across parts of the San Antonio metro overnight, flooding the International Airport. Several low-water crossings across Central/South-Central Texas are closed. This first round begins what will be a week-long endeavor of precipitation chances across a majority of Texas.\n\nDense freezing fog coated the Panhandle and West Texas in a thin layer of ice overnight. As temperatures rise above freezing this afternoon, those accumulations will melt. The same goes for Texoma, North Texas, and the Ark-La-Tex folks. Temperatures should rise above freezing in those regions, at least south of the Red River. Any rain will ‘be rain’, and ice should be melting pretty quickly.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nHeavy Rain, Flooding, Rowdy Storms… Wellzy!\n\nNumerous showers and thunderstorms are expected this afternoon across the eastern half of Texas. More showers and storms are likely tonight into Tuesday across nearly all of Texas. Severe storms aren’t likely today. Stronger storms may produce gusty winds, small hail, and frequent lightning. Heavy rain will be the primary hazard, with localized flooding a possibility. As multiple rounds of precipitation continue through mid-week, more flooding may occur across the eastern third to the eastern half of Texas. Several inches of rainfall will likely fall across the eastern half of Texas through the work-week.\n\nThursday may be a down day for thunderstorm activity, but a cool front arriving on Friday may bring more chances for rain. We’ll firm up those details once longer-range weather model data agrees on the system’s timing. Unlike the last several fronts, this weekend’s cold front does not look to have an oversized attitude."
