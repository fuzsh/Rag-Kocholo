        "text": "More storms churning west of Austin area\n\nJust hours after a massive wave of showers and thunderstorms swung through Central Texas on Saturday, Doppler radar at 9 p.m. showed another similarly organized but much smaller line of storms churning west of the Austin metro area.\n\nStorms were training over Llano County, northeastern Gillespie County and northern Blanco County in the Hill Country west of Austin.\n\nTraining refers to how a series of storms can pass over the same area, much like a train passing over the same spot at a railroad crossing.\n\nA flood advisory was in effect for Llano County until midnight, the National Weather Service said. Minor flooding is ongoing or expected to begin there and an additional 1 to 2 inches of rainfall was likely, forecasters said.\n\nBecause so much rain is falling in watersheds that feed the Colorado River, the series of storms Saturday could bode well for the declining water elevation levels on the Highland Lakes, a source of fresh water and aquatic fun for many Central Texas communities, including Austin.\n\nFlood warnings for Austin area to end by 7:15 p.m.\n\nThe band of storms that prompted flash flood warnings in the Austin metro area on Saturday is expected to continue its northeasterly swing across Central Texas and leave the Interstate 35 corridor by nightfall, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBut the storms triggered one more flash flood warning for central and eastern Williamson County until 7:15 p.m.\n\n\"The band has and continues to produce excessive rainfall and renewed flooding,\" the weather service said in a bulletin Saturday afternoon. \"As a result, (we) will keep the flash flood watch going through 7 p.m. when the rain, showers and thunderstorms move east of our area.\"\n\nScattered showers and isolated storms are still a possibility as a system of low air pressure moves from West Texas and heads east across the state.\n\n\"With the faster movement, the flood threat is lower,\" the weather service said. \"However, ongoing flooding will be slower to recede in areas that get this additional rain.\"\n\nAustin's weather forecast for Sunday calls for a return of mostly sunny skies with a high temperature approaching 90 degrees. Sunday night should be partly cloudy, but the cloud cover will help keep overnight temperatures above a balmy 69 degrees.\n\nMORE: Waning La Niña could ease spring drought underway after dry March in Austin, forecasters say\n\nFlash flood warning for Travis, Bastrop counties\n\nA flash flood warning is in effect for Travis and Bastrop counties until 6 p.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nDoppler radar at 2:58 p.m. indicated thunderstorms producing heavy rainfall across the warning area, the weather service said. The rainfall rate is about 1 to 3 inches an hour, with additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches possible at night.\n\nA flash flood warning is issued when flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly, forecasters said.\n\nThe weather service warns that \"life-threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses\" are possible.\n\nAffected communities include Austin, Pflugerville, Elgin, Bastrop, Manor, West Lake Hills, Cedar Creek and Mustang Ridge.\n\nThe weather service received reports of flooded low water crossings on Old San Antonio Road in Southeast Austin around 3:10 p.m.; on Kenosha Pass in Southwest Austin around 3:15 p.m.; and on Spicewood Springs Road in Northwest Austin around 3:30 p.m.\n\nAustin Energy's outage map as of 3 p.m. showed only a few outages so far affecting only about 65 customers. Oncor, the utility serving parts of eastern Williamson County, northeastern Travis County and northern Bastrop County only reported a handful of outages with fewer than 20 customers affected.\n\nFlash flood warning for Hays, Caldwell counties\n\nA flash flood warning is in effect for Hays and Caldwell counties until 5:30 p.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nDoppler radar at 2:27 p.m. indicated thunderstorms producing heavy rainfall across the warning area, the weather service said. The rainfall rate is about 1 to 3 inches an hour, with additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches possible at night.\n\nA flash flood warning is issued when flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly, forecasters said.\n\nThe weather service warns that \"life-threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses\" are possible.\n\nAffected communities include San Marcos, Kyle, Buda, Lockhart, Martindale, Driftwood, Maxwell, Mountain City and Uhland.\n\nPedernales Electric Cooperative, which serves northern Hays County and parts of Blanco and Burnet counties reported only eight outages affecting about 1,000 customers as of 2 p.m.\n\nWave of storms inching northeast toward Austin\n\nDoppler radar images show a wave of storms inching northeast toward the Austin metro area. San Antonio and Bexar County was already under a flash flood warning until 3:15 p.m.\n\nAlthough the Austin area has only seen light to moderate rainfall so far Saturday, the National Weather Service says rain chances will remain high with a low pressure system sitting in West Texas, drawing moisture from the south. Sites from Bulverde to Seguin are reporting rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches of rain in an hour.\n\nBut as the low begins to move east, it should trigger more showers along the Interstate 35 corridor and in counties east of the highway.\n\nForecasters warn that any additional rainfall could pose a risk of flooding in areas already saturated by recent precipitation.\n\n\"Some of this activity could produce additional locally heavy rainfall and possibly a strong storm,\" the weather service said in a bulletin Saturday afternoon. \"Instability levels are lacking, given the cool temperatures and lack of any breaks in the clouds expected.\"\n\nForecasters said those conditions \"should tamper severe chances but a strong storm with small hail is not totally out of the realm of possibilities.\"\n\nAlthough the rain could last into the wee hours of Sunday, \"no heavy rainfall is really expected from this activity and will not make any changes to the expiration time of the flash flood watch, which is currently set to expire at 7 p.m.,\" the weather service said.\n\nThe outlook from the weather service continues to call for widespread rainfall amounts of an additional 1 to 3 inches by Sunday morning.\n\n\"Things finally dry out for Sunday with the sun hopefully making an appearance once again,\" and daytime high temperatures in the mid-80s to mid-90s.\n\nFlash flood watch for Austin until 7 p.m.\n\nA flash flood watch remains in effect for much of the Austin metro area — including Travis, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties — until 7 p.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service says.\n\nForecasters say a flash flood watch means that weather conditions could develop and lead to flash flooding of low water crossings, areas with poor drainage, as well as urban creeks and streams.\n\nUnder a flash flood watch, affected residents should monitor weather reports and be prepared to take action should flood warnings be issued, the weather service says.\n\n\"Numerous storms are expected through this evening,\" a weather service bulletin Saturday morning said. \"Some storms could produce heavy rain with localized flash flooding.\"\n\nForecasters are warning of \"additional rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with isolated higher amounts are possible through this evening.\" The highest totals will be west of the Interstate 35 corridor, they said.\n\nPossible threats also include isolated damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes, the weather service said.\n\nAustin has already been left soggy after a few days of significant rainfall. The city's main weather station at Camp Mabry set a new daily rainfall record on Friday with a reading of 1.37 inches that broke the old record set in 1904 by 0.06 inch.\n\nThe outlook for Austin on Saturday includes rounds of showers and thunderstorms throughout the day with temperatures staying below 74 degrees, which is about 10 degrees below normal for this time of year.\n\nEast winds blowing at 10 to 15 mph could include gusts as strong as 25 mph.\n\nShowers and storms all but certain to continue at night — forecasters literally put rain chances at 100% — but the overcast skies and humidity will help keep overnight temperatures above 63 degrees.\n\nMoisture-rich southeast winds from the Texas Gulf Coast, blowing at 5 to 10 mph, could have gusts as strong as 25 mph. New rainfall amounts of up to three-quarters of an inch are possible, forecaster say.\n\nThe weather service's extended forecast calls for a return to sunshine on Sunday and Monday but rain chances arise again by Tuesday:\n\nSunday: Mostly cloudy through mid morning then becoming sunny with a high near 86. South-southwest winds of 5 to 15 mph could include gusts as high as 20 mph. Partly cloudy at night with a low around 70.\n\nMonday: Mostly sunny with a high near 91. Partly cloudy at night with a low around 67.\n\nTuesday: A 30% chance of rain with a high near 80. At night, mostly clear with a low around 58.\n\nWednesday: Sunny with a high near 82. At night, mostly clear with a low around 59."
