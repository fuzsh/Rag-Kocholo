        "meta_description": "from mls: The Granite Basin Ranch is an attractive 12-acres just outside Llano, TX. There is an excellent mixture of pastureland and brush to provide the perfect habitat for your wildlife and cattle needs. A centrally located medium-sized tank has been more than sufficient in holding/supplying water. This tract is close to several Metropolitan cities, making it a great homestead or recreational weekend getaway. The Seller will consider selling more or less acreage if the buyer chooses. The Granite Basin Ranch offers 12 acres of wildlife-exempt land with over 500’ of HWY 29 frontage. A wet weather creek feeds the medium-sized tank on the property. The tank holds water and has been the primary water source for wildlife and livestock. Numerous wildlife species have been observed on the property, including whitetail deer, wild hogs, migratory waterfowl, and multiple varmint species. Throughout the property, you’ll find numerous Live Oaks, Mesquite, KR Bluestem, and other native trees and grasses in this area. With more than 20’ of elevation change, you have views for miles. The property is fenced on two sides with barbed wire. Electricity available on the property.",
