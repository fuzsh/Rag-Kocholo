The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases.\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nLlano experiences extreme seasonal variation in the perceived humidity.\n\nThe muggier period of the year lasts for 6.1 months, from April 19 to October 22, during which time the comfort level is muggy, oppressive, or miserable at least 20% of the time. The month with the most muggy days in Llano is June, with 23.0 days that are muggy or worse.\n\nThe month with the fewest muggy days in Llano is January, with 0.3 days that are muggy or worse.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in Llano\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in LlanomuggyJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%Jan 241%Jan 241%79%Jun 2379%Jun 23Apr 1920%Apr 1920%Oct 2220%Oct 2220%NowNowoppressiveoppressivemuggymuggyhumidhumiddrydrycomfortablecomfortablemiserablemiserable\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Llano experiences significant seasonal variation over the course of the year.\n\nThe windier part of the year lasts for 5.3 months, from January 20 to June 29, with average wind speeds of more than 10.1 miles per hour.

Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (906 feet). Within 50 miles also contains very significant variations in elevation (1,611 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Llano is covered by grassland (46%) and shrubs (43%), within 10 miles by grassland (48%) and shrubs (45%), and within 50 miles by shrubs (44%) and grassland (41%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Llano, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Llano.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Llano according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Llano is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Llano and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nLlano Municipal Airport (KAQO, 96%, 1.9 mi, northeast, 69 ft elevation change)\n\nHorseshoe Bay Resort Airport (KDZB, 2.8%, 24 mi, southeast, 62 ft elevation change)\n\nGillespie County Airport (KT82, 1.3%, 38 mi, south, 663 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Llano and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
