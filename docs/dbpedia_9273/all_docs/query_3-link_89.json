        "text": "Northern Regional Police Department Chief John Sicilia has retired after nearly 30 years of service in law enforcement.\n\nPine supervisors honored Sicilia at their meeting on Aug. 5, during which a scholarship in his name was announced.\n\nA native of Shaler, Sicilia graduated from Westminster College in 1995. He began his law enforcement career with the University of Pittsburgh and Franklin Park police departments.\n\nIn 1997, he joined the Pine-Marshall-Bradford Woods Police Department, which evolved into the Northern Regional department nine years later and now also includes Richland and Seven Fields.\n\nDuring his career, Sicilia was promoted to sergeant in 2008, captain in 2013 and chief of police in 2019. He played a crucial role in forming the North Hills Special Response Team, retiring as its commander in 2015. He also served as president of the Allegheny County Chiefs of Police Association.\n\n“From the moment you first put on that uniform, you have embodied the values of integrity, service, and excellence,” Audrey Mackie, who chairs Pine’s board of supervisors, said at the meeting.\n\n“Numerous accomplishments and a positive impact on countless lives have marked your journey through the ranks of the Northern Regional Police Department. Your leadership has guided this department, fostering a culture of accountability, respect and community engagement,” she continued. “As you step into your future, we know that you leave behind a legacy that will continue to inspire future generations of officers. On behalf of the township, we express our deepest gratitude for your many years of dedicated service.”\n\nTownship manager Jason Kratsas read a statement on behalf of Pine-Richland School District Superintendent Brian Miller:\n\n“We extend our appreciation to Chief Sicilia for his service to our community and school. For decades, we have maintained a positive and collaborative relationship with the NRPD. Chief Sicilia was a key contributor to that partnership through his various titles and roles. Thank you, chief, on behalf of all of the students, staff and families. Best of luck in retirement.”\n\nSicilia expressed his gratitude for the recognition and remarked on his career.\n\n“My predecessor, Chief (Robert) Amann, always told me about how supportive Pine Township was,” Sicilia said. “What a pleasure it’s been over the last four years to truly experience that for myself. You guys are really the jewel of Allegheny County. It’s been an absolute honor to work for you all. I have countless people to thank: the fire department, EMS. It’s just been a great collaboration.”\n\nPine Township and HM3 Partners Independence Fund collaborated to establish a scholarship honoring Sicilia’s commitment to the community and aiming to inspire the next generation of law enforcement professionals. Patrick Hampson, HM3 founder and managing partner, attended the meeting to help announce the scholarship.\n\nThe Chief John Sicilia Scholarship will support high school seniors pursuing a career in criminal justice. Fundraising for the program will start immediately, with the scholarship set to benefit the graduating class of 2025."
