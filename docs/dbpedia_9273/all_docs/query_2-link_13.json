        "text": "4.2/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserMy friend & I booked 2 single rooms with a sea view. We booked 6 weeks in advance and checked with reception by phone that we'd have a sea view room each, could park, and a full English vegetarian breakfast including plant based sausages would be available - all prior to booking. We were assured of all of these so booked 3 nights to include on site parking, chargeable at £6 a night, although we could have parked roadside outside the front door for the same price. The reality was that we had to park in another car park down the road, our rooms had no view, fit to be store cupboards - not bedrooms, my room smelt unpleasant and both rooms were dingy and cramped. We complained and were then allocated more spacious single rooms with a sea view, which is what we'd booked. Still my bathroom was cramped, you could rest your head on the sink when using the loo, the shower unit was old, broken rail, dated furniture, curtains carpet, etc etc. There were no vegetarian sausages at breakfast 2 mornings running, apparently the 'order hadn't come in'. No mushrooms either, just baked beans, hash browns, egg & tomatoes. Meat sausages and bacon were plentiful! Despite raising this at the desk there was no interest or solution offered from the staff. We asked what they'd expect of the rest of the customers if the meat order hadn't come in. They agreed there would be a riot. They got some veggie sausages for the 3rd morning after I pointed out that Asdas sell them 5 minutes up the road. By this time we'd lost confidence in them being prepared & handled seperately from the meat. The chef (if indeed he is a real chef) was so abrupt and unapologetic that we felt unsure about eating them. He brought us 2 each on the last morning, which we wrapped in napkins and fed to the gulls after checking out. Altogether the hotel service was indifferent, careless, rude, disorganised, they fobbed us and other guests off with lame excuses & contradictory information. We overheard another guest experiencing the same as us regards vegetarian breakfast, and complaints about the food & service in general from yet more guests. It was not good value, I'd describe it as a hostel, not a hotel. The location was pretty much its only saving grace as it was seafront and near town. The bar area was pleasant but service was very slow. We met a lady who had stayed at the Premier Inn in a double room, spacious, with a roomy ensuite, clean, modern & up to date, with a full cooked breakfast for £66.00 a night. Our experience was the opposite, forlorn furnishings & a meagre, limited choice of vegetarian options for breakfast. We paid £76.00 a night. No brainer, stay at the Premier Inn\n\nShow More\n\n4.1/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserIn the morning I received an email to allow me to fill in my personal details to speed up checking as well as a courtesy call to confirm my reservation and expected time of arrival. As someone who worries this was reassuring. When arriving at the hotel it was interesting getting into the car park. Once I got the code I found it very tight due to a car parked in one of the bays protruding much further than the lines. After some careful manoeuvring a member of staff informed me I could park lengthways against the wall instead. Which was a relief. When we walked round to the front of the building the first thing I noticed was the beautiful view and facade of the hotel. It has an attractive coloured glass porch with a lovely art deco design. The location is absolutely perfect. Across the road from the beach and pier and a short stroll from all the restaurants, bars and attractions. The lobby is calm and inviting. We checked in quickly and effortlessly once a very pleasant member of staff arrived. Our room was very spacious and accessible. Immaculately clean and comfortable. The hotel can cater for wheelchair users so there was a wheelchair accessible shower in the bathroom (on the 3rd floor). Due to the nature of the structure the floors are uneven which means there was a small gap under the door. The staff provided extra towels to block this for us. The bar was clean, calm, comfortable and well stocked with a good selection of drinks and snacks. For a hotel so close to the pier it was also reasonably priced (approx £8 for a large white wine). Breakfast was served between 8-10am with lots of choice. The room was spacious. Guests can help themselves to cereals, yoghurt, fruit and pastries etc. There is also a hot buffet. At busy times there was a short wait for some items as they are cooked in small batches. This means while you may wait a bit the items are all hot and fresh. The produce used is good quality and we enjoyed our meal. Other items such as poached and scrambled eggs are available on request. The staff were exceptionally friendly. Anna and Natalia in particular made our stay very enjoyable. My son was upset when we left and already wants to go back. We are looking forward to visiting again soon.\n\nShow More"
