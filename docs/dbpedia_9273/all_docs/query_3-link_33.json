        "text": "RIO GRANDE VALLEY – The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) football program announced on Monday the hiring of Ben Cox as video coordinator, Alexis Garcia as administrative assistant, and Reese Vogel as assistant strength & conditioning coach.\n\nBen Cox\n\nCox comes to UTRGV after three seasons as part of the football staff as Utah Tech, during which time he served as both video coordinator and an assistant in equipment operations. His responsibilities included recording practice and uploading footage to Hudl, cutting and tagging video, sharing video with coaches and players, coordinating with other teams regarding items such as video exchange and game day setup, training new video assistants, and assisting in ordering new equipment.\n\n\"Ben is taking on an extremely important role for us in the program, and the fact that Ben has held this position at another FCS school gives us the confidence he can do the job well,\" UTRGV Director of Football Operations & Administration John Simmons said. \"Ben is a creative thinker and a tireless worker. We are excited to see Ben grow in this profession and help build on the vision of this program.\"\n\nCox graduated from Utah Tech, then known as Dixie State, earning a Bachelor of Science in Media Studies in May 2021.\n\n\"Having the opportunity to work at UTRGV is an honor for me,\" Cox said. \"I am excited to work alongside a staff that has shown what it takes to be successful and grow as a team. Having the chance to really build a program and help make it into a successful team makes me eager to come in and get to work. I am excited and thankful for this opportunity.\"\n\nAlexis Garcia\n\nGarcia comes to UTRGV after one year at UTSA, where she served as an on-campus recruiting coordinator intern. Her duties included planning and organizing both official and unofficial visits, including flights, hotels, food, entertainment, ground transportation, decorations, snacks for hotel rooms, photo shoots, and tours of campus and the community.\n\nShe oversaw the home game day experience for recruits, ensuring they had name tags and itineraries while setting up a recruiting room and keeping in communication with coaches, recruits, and their families.\n\nGarcia also monitored the transfer portal to assist in identifying prospects for recruitment.\n\n\"We are excited to have Alexis return to the Valley and join our football staff,\" Simmons said. \"Her passion and work ethic will elevate the program in many ways. We look forward to her role growing as the program grows. Her future is extremely bright.\"\n\nGarcia graduated Summa Cum Laude from Texas State with a Bachelor of Science in Exercise Sports Science in May 2022. She graduated Summa Cum Laude with her Master of Science in Health and Kinesiology from UTSA in December 2023.\n\n\"As someone who was born and raised in South Texas, coming back home and working for UTRGV is extra special to me,\" Garcia said. \"This means becoming a part of something that has potential to shape the community's identity and future. It is an opportunity to contribute to the development of not only a brand-new football program, but to build a team that has my own personal contributions with a shared vision of success. I am eager to bring my experience and passion to this role and help build a strong foundation for UTRGV football.\"\n\nReese Vogel\n\nVogel, who will work with both the football and swimming & diving programs, comes to UTRGV from Tulane, where he served as a volunteer football strength & conditioning coach this past summer. He spent the spring as an assistant strength & conditioning coach and sports science coordinator at Abilene Christian following a year and a half as an assistant strength & conditioning coach at Central Oklahoma, where he implemented the football team's strength & conditioning program while serving as sports science director.\n\nVogel started working in strength & conditioning as an intern at Pittsburg State in 2020-21 before working as an assistant strength & conditioning coach and special teams coordinator for the varsity and junior varsity football teams at Casady School in 2021-22.\n\n\"Reese is a bright young mind in the field of strength and conditioning,\" UTRGV Head Football Strength & Conditioning Coach Don Sommer said. \"We're excited to welcome him to the Valley to help kick off our inaugural football season.\"\n\nVogel graduated from Central Oklahoma in May 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology and Exercise Science. He is a certified strength and conditioning specialist by the National Strength and Conditioning Association and a USA Weightlifting Level 1 Coach.\n\nBefore beginning his strength & conditioning internship at Pittsburg State, Vogel was a place kicker and punter on the football team. Originally from Carl Junction, Mo., Vogel was a Missouri Class 4A All-District selection as a senior at Carl Junction High School in 2019.\n\n\"I am very grateful for this opportunity from [UTRGV Head Football] Coach [Travis] Bush and Coach Sommer,\" Vogel said. \"V's up!\"\n\nSupport UTRGV Football | Become a Fan on Facebook | Follow us on Twitter | Follow us on Instagram | Follow us on YouTube"
