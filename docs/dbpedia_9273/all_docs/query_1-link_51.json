The event was also attended by former teachers.\n\nThe gathering of ex-pupils was a great success and £300 was raised during the evening for St David’s Hospice.\n\nEx pupil and organiser Janette Tristram said:\n\n“It was great to see everyone and support a very worthy local cause. “The event was over a year in the planning but it was worth it because we had such great fun.\n\n“We know a lot of people over the years who have been cared for by St David’s Hospice and we hope that the money raised makes the patients’ lives easier.”\n\nHospice Community Fundraiser, James Wilde said:\n\n“Thank you to everyone who attended the reunion. The event sounded like a great night and the money raised will help support the care offered here at St David’s Hospice.”"
