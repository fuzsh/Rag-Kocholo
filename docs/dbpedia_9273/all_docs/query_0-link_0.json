We understand that every child is an individual and as such requires individual learning, care, and guidance to enable them to thrive.\n\nWe want every student to feel that they belong, are learning new information, developing new skills and benefiting from new experiences. Underpinning all we do are our core values of equity, well-being, and excellence. We consider these to be our priorities in how we provide for our students and develop our committed staff.\n\nAs a school community, we are justifiably proud of our students and their success. We extend a warm welcome to you to Ysgol John Bright and look forward to sharing your child’s journey toward a successful future.\n\nMr H Parry | Headteacher/Pennaeth\n\nYsgol John Bright has an ethos that puts students at the heart of all we do. We are driven by a moral purpose that means we have high expectations and aspirations for all our students. We want students at the school to feel safe and happy; we want them to achieve their full academic potential and we want them to grow as decent citizens.\n\nWe aim to create an environment in which all students can flourish, regardless of their ability and where all students feel valued and rewarded for their endeavours. We want our student to enjoy learning and to have fun as they become well-rounded, successful young people who are equipped with the skills and qualifications to take up their place in the local or wider community.\n\nOur aim is to transform the life chances of all our students and to set them on their way to happy and successful lives. Educationalists suggest that all young people will learn, enjoy, succeed and thrive in a first rate educational environment, with the best facilities, the best teaching and the most up to date resources available to them. We strive to provide all of these.\n\n“Ceri started in YJB in September and her engagement and motivation to learn is at a level beyond my expectations and I put that down to the high standard of learning and support you have shown her over her first year. You have supported her in looking at her potential not just her current subject levels.”"
