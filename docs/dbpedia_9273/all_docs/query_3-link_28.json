        "text": "Help businesses grow. Consulting is a broad career with specialization areas from management to information technology. More than 30 percent of Johnson School graduates enter the field, often receiving offers from top firms before graduation.\n\nEach graduate program—from the executive MBA programs to the MPS in Management—offers a variety of project-based consulting courses led by faculty members with decades of professional experience. Graduate students also build skills through our student-run consulting firm and make valuable connections through campus organizations and company visits.\n\nIdeas are born here. The entrepreneurial ecosystem at the Johnson School is strong. Among our graduate business programs, you’ll find several ways to focus on new ventures, from elective courses to team-based projects for real-world clients. You can also participate in hackathons, pitch sessions, and student-led consulting services.\n\nCornell’s entrepreneurship spirit extends beyond the business school. Our students and faculty engage with peers from engineering, life sciences, and other disciplines with a healthy startup culture. This is especially evident at Cornell Tech, where graduate students participate in several studio-based courses.\n\nLearn to think like a banker. Johnson School graduates have a significant presence in the finance and investment banking sectors. In our well-rounded curriculum led by current and former practitioners, you’ll gain a solid understanding of financial markets.\n\nNot only does our immersive program give you the skills and knowledge to succeed in this field, but Cornell also maintains strong connections on Wall Street, opening you up to internship and career opportunities.\n\nBecome a tech-savvy leader. Technology touches everything we do in business today, from how we communicate with clients and colleagues to how we collect, store, analyze, and share data. While some business schools offer a tech-focused elective here or there, the Johnson School incorporates technology throughout the curriculum, from core classes to capstone projects.\n\nThe Johnson Cornell Tech MBA may be especially appealing for fintech professionals or those interested in how business and technology intersect. With our high-tech Roosevelt Island campus in New York City as our home base, this interdisciplinary program is unique among Ivy League business schools."
