        "text": "The changes to the sport have been swift, and coaches are coming and going at a near-record pace.\n\nThe 247Sports Coaching Carousel has tracked every move throughout the offseason, and will continue to do so as assistants move from team to team.\n\nWith movement atop programs seemingly finished with UCLA hiring DeShaun Foster on Feb. 12, let's take a look at each hire and examine within the context and challenges inherent and unique to those teams, whether these 30 coaches fit in their new homes.\n\nRELATED: Every hire and promotion on the college football carousel\n\nAlabama: Kalen DeBoer (Washington head coach)\n\nGrade — A\n\nDeBoer is/was the hottest head coach in the country, so it figures the top job in the country would at least kick the tires. He might not “fit” geographically at Alabama, but the Sioux Falls native is an absolute winner. He’s won big at every job and drastically improved every team he has inherited, whether as an offensive coordinator or head coach.\n\nAs OC, he turned a one-win team into a 10-win team in 12 months at Fresno State and also flipped Eastern Michigan from a one-win season to a seven-win record in a year. He won eight games as Indiana's 2019 play-caller. It was the best win total in 26 years.\n\nDeBoer is 37-9 in four years as an FBS head coach, including the 13-win season at Washington that ended in January as the national runner-up, and he owns three national titles as an NAIA head coach. He might not be Saban, but he at least has a championship pedigree (104-12 as a head coach) that has been backed by results year after year, regardless of his role or the inherent difficulties of the job.\n\nArizona: Brent Brennan (San Jose State head coach)\n\nGrade — B-\n\nBrennan has the connections to Arizona that seem perfect, but can he deliver some consistency to Tucson as the Wildcats transition to the Big 12? The Wildcats were a remarkable story — and perhaps the hardest-playing team outside Washington on the West Coast — but Jedd Fisch's departure for Washington is a blemish on a program that has also been in the news for financial woes and the firing of athletics director Dave Heeke.\n\nBrennan inherits a team worthy of a top-25 ranking next season, so he needs to reach a bowl game. Brennan led SJSU to a bowl game in three of the last four seasons (a first for the program) and was the MWC coach of the year in 2020, when the Spartans finished No. 24 in the AP poll following a loss in the Arizona Bowl.\n\nBoise State: Spencer Danielson (Boise State defensive coordinator)\n\nGrade — C+\n\nHow can you not promote the interim head coach who led your program to a conference title? Spencer Danielson is the first and only interim coach to win a conference title in the FBS, doing so in a three-game stint. He was promoted to head coach following the 44-20 win against UNLV in the MWC Championship Game. The defensive coordinator has spent the past seven years at Boise State, so the Broncos assured themselves of a calming hand on the program during the transition.\n\nThe issue, however, is the potential loss of offensive coordinator Bush Hamdan, who has been targeted by the SEC's Kentucky. Hamdan's offense averaged 38.7 points during that three-week run to the conference title. Danielson was great as DC, ranking in the top three of scoring defense each year in the MWC, but can he keep the offense rolling?\n\nBoston College: Bill O'Brien (Ohio State offensive coordinator)\n\nGrade — B+\n\nFor as late in the process Boston College joined the carousel (Feb. 1) after Jeff Hafley bolted for a coordinator job in the NFL, Boston College made the biggest splash possible by hiring O'Brien. The Boston native made a quick pit stop in January and February at Ohio State as offensive coordinator (he only held a couple of meetings) after his one season as the New England Patriots' offensive coordinator.\n\nHe's most remembered for his time as head coach with the Houston Texans, where he won the AFC South four times in seven seasons but had only two playoff wins. He took over Penn State following the Jerry Sandusky scandal, parlaying a pair of winning seasons into the NFL gig. He coordinated Saban's offense at Alabama but never won a national title. His task at Boston College? Just get to a bowl game.\n\nBuffalo: Pete Lembo (South Carolina special teams coordinator)\n\nGrade — C+\n\nLembo is back in MACtion after a nine-year hiatus. The former Ball State head coach was 33-29 from 2011 through 2015 with nine- and 10-win seasons in 2012 and 2013. He bounced around as special teams coordinator after he departed from Ball State, with stops at Maryland, Rice, Memphis and most recently South Carolina. South Carolina's special teams ranked No. 1 in ESPN's special teams efficiency in 2022 and Lembo was a semifinalist for the Broyles Award. Can anyone other than Lance Leipold, one of the game's best coaches, win at Buffalo?\n\nDuke: Manny Diaz (Penn State defensive coordinator)\n\nGrade — B\n\nDiaz returns to the ACC to lead a Duke program that needs to reload quickly to maintain the high watermark of the Mike Elko era. Diaz returns after a rehabilitation stint at Penn State, where he turned Penn State into one of the nation's top defenses. The Nittany Lions allowed only 223.2 yards per game in 2023, the best mark since Alabama in 2011. The former Miami head coach led the Hurricanes to a top-10 ranking earlier this decade but was fired after the 2021 season, his third leading the program. He was 21-15 during that time.\n\nDiaz has the experience and a history of hiring fantastic assistant coaches, but that might not be enough for Duke to be immediately successful after losing quarterback Riley Leonard to Notre Dame in the transfer portal. Diaz will need a couple of offseasons to reload Duke.\n\nHouston: Willie Fritz (Tulane head coach)\n\nGrade — A\n\nFritz was the best Group of Five coach in the country over the last half decade, and now he's tasked with lifting Houston into the big time as one of the Big 12's newer members. Fritz was an incredible 23-4 in his last two seasons at Tulane, which included a victory against USC in the Cotton Bowl after the 2022 season.\n\nFritz has long been a mentor for many in the industry, with his guidance and seminars a must-see for coaches at conventions. The two-time AAC coach of the year was the FCS coach of the year previously during his time leading Sam Houston State (2010-13) and most recently led the Green Wave to bowl games in four of the last five seasons.\n\nHe has ties throughout the sport, and his experience in Texas will obviously help with the transition from Dana Holgorsen. Will he have strong support for Houston players akin to the NIL structure at Tulane?\n\nIndiana: Curt Cignetti (James Madison head coach)\n\nGrade — A\n\nCignetti is not afraid to rustle feathers or challenge the big boys, even before coaching a single game at Indiana.\n\n\"I don't take a backseat to anybody and don't plan on starting now,\" Cignetti emphatically told Indiana fans during a basketball game at Assembly Hall in December. \"Purdue sucks. But so does Michigan and Ohio State.\"\n\nYou've gotta love the enthusiasm and approach, if for nothing else than the entertainment value.\n\n\"I win,\" he said in December. \"Google me.\"\n\nYeah, Cignetti is built differently. He has never coached a losing team in 13 years as a head coach, and he led James Madison to an 11-win season and top-25 ranking in the program's first year in the FBS last season. He's a stem from the Saban coaching tree, having overseen receivers for Saban when he arrived at Alabama in 2007 before leaving in 2010 for his first head coaching job at IUP.\n\nJames Madison: Bob Chesney (Holy Cross head coach)\n\nGrade — B+\n\nChesney may have been a hot name for the Boston College job had it come open in December, and for good reason: he is a winner. Chesney won five straight Patriot League titles while leading Holy Cross, where he was a two-time finalist for the Eddie Robinson Award as the best coach in the FCS.\n\nULM: Bryant Vincent (New Mexico offensive coordinator)\n\nGrade — B-\n\nULM might have the worst facilities in college football, and though Terry Bowden did what he could to drum up financial support during his tenure, this isn’t a promising job. Enter Vincent, who many believed should have been elevated to head coach at UAB after serving as the interim coach in 2021. He was the offensive coordinator at UAB when the program was restarted, and helped lead the Blazers to two Conference USA championships.\n\nMiddle Tennessee: Derek Mason (ESPN analyst)\n\nGrade — C\n\nMason is back in Tennessee for his second shot as head coach. The former Vanderbilt coach takes over for Rick Stockstill at Middle Tennessee, which advanced to 10 bowl games in his 18 seasons leading the program. Mason was 27-55 at Vanderbilt after taking over for James Franklin, and then coordinated defenses at Auburn and Oklahoma State for two combined years before taking a sabbatical from coaching to spend time with his family and work as an analyst for ESPN.\n\nMichigan: Sherrone Moore (Michigan offensive coordinator)\n\nGrade — B+\n\nMoore was the natural selection to lead Michigan after Jim Harbaugh's departure for the NFL. Yes, it was an easy choice but that doesn't necessarily mean it was an easy decision for Michigan’s administration. The Wolverines could have targeted and landed a big name but opted for continuity and familiarity after winning a national title.\n\nMore importantly, Michigan needs a man who understands the program as they navigate the muddy waters of an NCAA investigation. Moore was 4-0 as the Wolverines' gameday head coach when Harbaugh served in-season suspensions — Moore was incredibly emotional after the win at then-No. 10 Penn State — and his play-calling decisions against Ohio State were fantastic.\n\nThere will always be a multitude of questions about elevating a coach from within, particularly one with limited coordinating experience and no previous gigs as a head coach, but Moore checks a lot of boxes. The only issue that has popped up early in his tenure: he hasn't quite kept the staff together as many hoped. Four assistants have opted to leave for NFL jobs.\n\nMichigan State: Jonathan Smith (Oregon State head coach)\n\nGrade — A\n\nMichigan State may have jumped ahead of the line for Smith when it quickly pursued the coach in December. Smith seemed like an instant hire if UCLA had opted to fire Chip Kelly in November, but that didn't happen and Smith moved to East Lansing.\n\nHe's a great get for the Spartans, who hired the most underrated coach west of the Mississippi River. He led the Beavers to 10 wins in 2022, including a victory against Oregon, and followed it up with eight victories last season.\n\nThe Beavers were built in the trenches, particularly along the offensive line, and that's going to be critical for the Spartans in the new-look Big Ten. Offensive line coach Jim Michalczik is the key.\n\nMississippi State: Jeff Lebby (Oklahoma offensive coordinator)\n\nGrade — B+\n\nMississippi State absolutely had to hire a cunning offensive mind as head coach, and the Bulldogs did just that with Lebby. The Oklahoma offensive coordinator and former Ole Miss play-caller will certainly spice up the Egg Bowl rivalry, too, against his old friend Lane Kiffin.\n\nAnything will be better than a terrible one-year experiment with Zach Arnett, who won one SEC game and singlehandedly destroyed a high-flying offense he inherited from Mike Leach in less than one season (12.6 points per game). Lebby will correct that course, certainly, but he still needs to rebuild that roster, which has been hit hard by the transfer portal for the past three years.\n\nNevada: Jeff Choate (Texas special teams coordinator)\n\nGrade — A\n\nNevada hired a coach who understands the region, and that's a huge plus after Ken Wilson needed only two years to fall on his face as head coach. Nevada is a program that can and should win often in the MWC. Choate led Montana State to back-to-back FCS playoff appearances and finished No. 4 in the polls in his final year (2019) before jumping to join Steve Sarkisian at Texas in 2021.\n\nNew Mexico: Bronco Mendenhall\n\nGrade — A+\n\nMendenhall seemed frustrated with coaching college football, but he's back after two years away from the sport. His hiring at New Mexico shocked some — many believed that he could have landed a bigger gig out West, such as Boise State.\n\nSimply put, this might be the best hire of the carousel season. BYU never missed a bowl game in Mendenhall's 11 seasons, which included four straight finishes in the AP Top 25. Virginia won the ACC Coastal and advanced to the ACC title game in 2019. His stay at Virginia started to slide after that great run in 2019, but the flashes of brilliance were still there despite leading a program that is limited in resources.\n\nNew Mexico State: Tony Sanchez (New Mexico State receivers coach)\n\nGrade — D\n\nSanchez didn't get much done after jumping from the high school ranks to lead UNLV, where he was 20-40 in five seasons, but he somehow has his second shot in the MWC as New Mexico State’s head coach. Jerry Kill surprised the industry when he opted to retire as a head coach — he has since re-emerged as an analyst at Vanderbilt — following an incredible 10-win season, and NMSU opted to promote Sanchez, who served two seasons as the receivers coach. Sanchez won six straight state titles at Bishop Gorman, a Las Vegas high school that was also crowned national champion by a publication in 2014.\n\nNorthwestern: David Braun (Northwestern interim coach)\n\nGrade — A\n\nMuch has been made over the years about how difficult it is to win at Northwestern. The challenges are immense in the Big Ten, and yet the small private school advanced to the Big Ten Championship Game twice under Pat Fitzgerald.\n\nHired in the 2023 offseason as defensive coordinator, Braun was thrown into the fire as interim head coach in July after Fitzgerald was fired amid a hazing investigation. Braun, the former defensive play-caller at North Dakota State, excelled leading the program and was promoted to permanent head coach in November. He broke a 14-game losing streak and became the first head coach in school history to win seven games and his first bowl game.\n\nOregon State: Trent Bray (Oregon State defensive coordinator)\n\nGrade — B-\n\nHow does one feel comfortable grading a hire for a school with no conference? Oregon State is still part of the Pac-12 but will play a Mountain West schedule for the foreseeable future after 10 of its conference mates decided to bolt for greener pastures.\n\nSmith, a beloved former Beavers quarterback, also jetted to Michigan State. That left Oregon State to look inward, so it promoted one of its own.\n\nBray, who played linebacker at the school, is tasked with leading a program into No Man's Land as a first-time head coach. The defensive coordinator developed the Pac-12's top defense in 2022. Can he guide a program with no home through a turbulent and uncertain future?\n\nSan Diego State: Sean Lewis (Colorado offensive coordinator)\n\nGrade — B+\n\nLewis was a hot name early during Colorado’s quick start to the Deion Sanders era. Lewis' offense, led by quarterback Shedeur Sanders, was electric and never struggled to score points during a 3-0 start. Then, in November, Sanders ripped play-calling duties away from Lewis despite averaging 32.1 points per game.\n\nLewis' offense will excite fans at San Diego State. When he led Kent State, the Flashes had the nation’s top offense (606.5 yards) in 2020. His system might not be the famed Air Coryell, but SDSU fans will like it all the same.\n\nSan Jose State: Ken Niumatalolo (UCLA tight ends coach)\n\nGrade — B+\n\nNiumatalolo evokes memories of the triple-option at Navy, where he is the school's winningest coach. But more than that, he is a coach tied to consistency.\n\nHe won 109 games in 15 seasons at Navy, leading the Midshipmen to 11 bowl games. He inherits a San Jose State program with bowl appearances in three of the past four years.\n\nHe hired Texas State assistant Craig Stutzmann as offensive coordinator. Niumatalolo's wide-open scheme was developed under June Jones, so expect the Spartans to throw the ball often next season.\n\nSouth Alabama: Major Applewhite (South Alabama offensive coordinator)\n\nGrade — A-\n\nApplewhite was the obvious choice for South Alabama after head coach Kane Wommack left to be Alabama's defensive coordinator. The former Houston coach (and Texas quarterback) coordinated the Jaguars' offense under Wommack with the unit averaging 33.1 points last season.\n\nApplewhite has become a head coach twice via an in-house promotion. He was Houston's OC when Tom Herman left for Texas in 2016.\n\nSouth Alabama is equipped with incredible facilities, along with a robust recruiting footprint along the Gulf Coast. Applewhite is set up for success.\n\nSyracuse: Fran Brown (Georgia defensive backs coach)\n\nGrade — B\n\nIt's not quite a trend, but athletic directors in this carousel cycle were more willing to hire head coaches with no play-calling experience. Brown might be the most notable hire in that subset, as the Georgia defensive backs coach left the SEC for northern New York, where he promises to infiltrate New Jersey on the recruiting trail. Brown was the 247Sports National Recruiter of the Year for 2024. He has tremendous ties in the Northeast after previously coaching at Rutgers, Temple and Haddonfield (N.J.) Paul VI.\n\nTexas A&M: Mike Elko (Duke head coach)\n\nGrade — B+\n\nYou were expecting Mark Stoops? Elko always seemed to be the natural fit at Texas A&M, though the \"ties\" to ousted coach Jimbo Fisher may have been an anchor for some. Elko was fantastic as the Aggies' defensive coordinator (2018-21) and was even more impressive leading Duke as head coach, where he won 16 games in two seasons. His personality and coaching style fit the Aggies’ culture, and with a solid slate of returning players, the program could be in for a surprising season in the fall.\n\nTroy: Gerad Parker (Notre Dame offensive coordinator)\n\nGrade — B\n\nParker seems to check a lot of boxes at Troy. He played for his predecessors, Neal Brown and Jon Sumrall, at Kentucky and also coached alongside Brown at West Virginia. He has extensive experience as a coordinator and position coach with Power 4 programs, most recently at Notre Dame. He takes over a Troy program coming off back-to-back Sun Belt titles under Sumrall, who was 23-4 in two seasons. Parker has experience as a head coach, going 0-6 at Purdue’s interim head coach in 2016.\n\nTulane: Jon Sumrall (Troy head coach)\n\nGrade — A\n\nSumrall made the most of his two seasons at Troy, winning back-to-back Sun Belt titles with 23 overall victories and only two conference losses. He was an assistant previously on Fritz's Tulane staff a decade ago and understands the program. The Green Wave went 23-4 under Fritz the last two seasons and was buoyed by one of the stronger NIL collectives among the Group of Five conferences. Sumrall has everything he needs to be successful in New Orleans.\n\nWashington: Jedd Fisch (Arizona head coach)\n\nGrade — A\n\nWashington might experience a steep fall akin to TCU after a national runner-up finish. Still, at least the Huskies seemed to make one of the better hires of the carousel season by grabbing Fisch.\n\nArizona finished 10-3 with seven straight wins to end the season with a No. 11 ranking in the polls, the program's best finish since 1998. Many wondered if quarterback Noah Fifita and receiver Tetairoa McMillan would follow Fisch to Washington, but that didn't happen.\n\nWashington has a lot to figure out after losing every starter on offense and most of the two-deep on offense and defense. Interestingly, Fisch seemed primed to potentially one day be a candidate at Florida or UCLA, but the timing seemed right to leave for Washington, which is flush with NIL money as the program starts anew in the Big Ten.\n\nWyoming: Jay Sawvel (Wyoming defensive coordinator)\n\nGrade — B\n\nWyoming didn't go far to replace a legend, promoting Sawvel after Craig Bohl retired. Sawvel has been on staff since 2020 and was a coach on teams that have reached 14 bowl games and seven NCAA playoffs. He coordinated defenses at Minnesota and Wake Forest before joining Wyoming, where Bohl's son, Aaron, will take over defensive play-calling duties."
