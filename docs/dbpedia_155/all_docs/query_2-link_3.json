The Warhawks started the season 2-0 before dropping ten in a row.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Bowden released a statement to the media, which was shared to to social media by KNOE.\n\n\"This morning I was informed that I would not be retained as the head football coach at ULM,\" Bowden said. \"Although our record took a step backwards due to critical injuries, I feel we have continued to make progress and become more competitive in the Sun Belt Conference.\"\n\nBowden won five conference games in his time in Monroe.\n\n\"I want to thank ULM for the opportunity to coach here. I especially want to thank the players, assistant coaches, and support staff who worked so hard to turn this program around. I have fallen in love with this university community and the city of Monroe and they will always have a special place in my heart.\"\n\nFormer Grambling State head coach Broderick Fobbs will reportedly be the interim head coach. It was not immediately clear what other staff members will be retained."
