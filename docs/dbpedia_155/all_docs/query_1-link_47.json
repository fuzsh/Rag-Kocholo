        "text": "Head Football Coach David Hutchison and the Glenville State College Pioneer football team have announced the schedule for the upcoming 2011 football season. The eleven game schedule includes five home games and six road contests. The Pioneers will be facing two opponents that were ranked in the final 2010 NCAA Division II poll.\n\n“We are very excited to release our 2011 football schedule. We have put together a very tough and challenging non-conference schedule. All three teams spent time ranked in the top 25 last year and will most likely all be mentioned in this year’s preseason polls. Combined with our always competitive and always improving West Virginia Conference, we face some major challenges. With 16 returning starters, all of our specialists coming back, and 23 seniors we feel with a lot of hard work this offseason we have a foundation in place for a special season,” said Coach Hutchison.\n\nCarson Newman College (7-4) of Tennessee will visit Morris Stadium to open the 2011 season at 7:00 p.m. on Thursday, September 1st.\n\nThe Pioneers then head out for three consecutive road games starting with a trip to Florence, Alabama to meet the University of North Alabama, a Perennial NCAA Division II powerhouse, on Saturday, September 10th. The Lions have advanced to the NCAA Division II playoffs for six consecutive years. Last season UNA finished with a record of 9-4 after falling in the second round of the playoffs. North Alabama is coached by former Salem and Auburn coach and TV analyst Terry Bowden, son of former WVU and Florida State coach Bobby Bowden.\n\nGlenville will open up WVIAC action on Saturday, September 17th when they visit Fairmont State University (TBA). The Falcons were 5-6 in 2010 including a 17-14 loss to the Pioneers.\n\nThe road trip continues for the Pioneers with a visit to the University of North Carolina at Pembroke on Saturday, September 24th for a 2:00 p.m. game. The Braves were 5-5 last season and defeated GSC 28-14 at Morris Stadium.\n\nThe Pioneers return home on Saturday, October 1st to host the Hilltoppers of West Liberty University. WLU is coming off a disappointing 7-3 season in spite of beating GSC 47-21.\n\nThe Concord University Mountain Lions will visit Morris Stadium on Saturday, October 8th to battle the Pioneers at 1:00 p.m. Concord finished the ’10 campaign with a 8-3 mark that included a 49-14 victory over the Pioneers.\n\nOn Saturday, October 15th GSC will travel to Institute, West Virginia to meet the Yellow Jackets of West Virginia State University in a 1:00 p.m. contest. WVSU was winless in 2010 falling to the Pioneers 42-27.\n\nHomecoming for the Pioneers will be Saturday, October 22nd featuring a battle with the Bobcats of West Virginia Wesleyan College at 1:30 p.m. at Morris Stadium. Wesleyan won this bitter rivalry 31 to 24 en route to an outstanding 9-2 record last season.\n\nThe University of Charleston will host GSC on Saturday, October 29th at 1:00 p.m. The Golden Eagles (8-3) defeated the Pioneers 44-16 last season.\n\nThe defending WVIAC Champion Shepherd University Rams will visit GSC on Saturday, November 5th for a 12 p.m. kickoff. The rams (12-2) were ranked 7th in the final NCAA Division II Poll after losing in the semi-finals of the playoffs. The Pioneers stunned the Rams in the final game of the regular season 28-24 at Shepherdstown. It was the only WVIAC loss for Shepherd in 2010. The Pioneers have beaten the Rams for four consecutive seasons.\n\nThe Pioneers will close the regular season on Saturday, November 12th (TBA) when they visit the Griffins of Seton Hill University in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. Last season the Pioneers downed the Griffins 38-28 as SHU ended the year with a 2-9 record.\n\nThe Pioneers will open up spring practice on Tuesday, March 28th. The annual Blue-White Spring Game will take place at 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, April 28th at Morris Stadium."
