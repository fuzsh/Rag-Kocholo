We hope to see Morris Stadium packed for what should be some exciting games against excellent opponents. Our Schedule is very challenging, but the team is excited and working hard to prepare themselves for another run at the WVIAC Championship,” said Glenville State College Head Coach Alan Fiddler.\n\nThe Pioneers finished the 2009 season with a 7-4 record and runner ups in the WVIAC.
