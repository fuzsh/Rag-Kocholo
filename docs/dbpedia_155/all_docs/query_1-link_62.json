        "text": "Terry Bowden is reportedly out as Louisiana-Monroe’s head coach.\n\nRoss Dellenger of Yahoo Sports broke the news Sunday afternoon. Bowden had been the head coach at ULM since 2021, with the Warhawks going 10-26 in his tenure.\n\nBowden, who turns 68 in February, has had a long coaching career. The son of late Florida State legend Bobby Bowden, Terry’s head coaching experience spans multiple decades with previous stops at Salem, Samford, Auburn, North Alabama and Akron.\n\nDuring Bowden’s Auburn tenure (1993-98), the Tigers went 47-17, including a 30-14-1 mark in SEC play. Auburn was ineligible for postseason play, including the SEC Championship Game, during Bowden’s first 2 seasons when AU posted a 20-1-1 record. The Tigers went to 3 straight bowl games from 1995-97 as Bowden’s squad notched a 26-11 mark. Bowden resigned during the 1998 season, facing criticism for multiple off-the-field issues and a 1-5 start.\n\nAfter resigning from Auburn, Bowden was away from coaching and worked as a broadcaster until his return to the sidelines at Division II program North Alabama. Under Bowden, the Lions went 29-9 from 2009-11.\n\nBowden returned to the FBS ranks in 2012 accepting the job at Akron. The Zips were 35-52 in 7 seasons under Bowden, making bowl games in 2015 and 2017.\n\nBowden’s record as a head coach is now 185-140-2."
