        "text": "Scribblin' on Sports . . .\n\nWhen the story of Terry Bowden's comment from two years ago made the national wire service Tuesday, it grabbed a lot of attention. The Associated Press reported nothing new Wednesday, but the ugly rumors and innuendoes were a hot item among fans; especially on talk radio.\n\nFor those who wish Auburn ill will, it was fuel for a new flame and has quickly heated up. It has been like a late night rerun - or The Eric Ramsey Story, Part II.\n\nThose who have no desire to open old wounds would have preferred to let dead dogs lie, yet they can't help but be aware of what could become a sensitive situation.\n\nThe story, first reported by the Opelika-Auburn News Sunday, quoted former Auburn coach Terry Bowden saying that boosters were funneling thousands of dollars to football players when he became coach in 1993, a time when the Tigers already were on NCAA probation.\n\n\"They were paying players cash, $12,000, $15,000 to sign,\" Bowden said on the recording, reviewed and reported nationally by The Associated Press.\n\nThe tape was apparently made a year or two after Bowden had quit the team in mid season; and refers to a situation now 10 years old.\n\nBowden said he was told to just shake hands and say, \"Thank you\" but that he had put a stop to it.\n\nCurrent coach Tommy Tuberville spoke to the Huntsville Quarterback Club Tuesday night, but no one asked about Bowden's comments. Huntsville Times sports editor John Pruett said he talked with Tuberville after the meeting and was told whatever occurred years ago has nothing to do with what's going on at Auburn today.\n\n\"Wasn't all this discussed, investigated and put to rest way back then?\" Tuberville asked Pruett.\n\nThat's what a lot of Auburn people are wondering, but whenever something like this crops up, there is always apprehension; especially now that the basketball program is being investigated.\n\nWith the bad some good must fall, someone once wrote. If so, then perhaps the upset loss to North Alabama has Jacksonville State's next opponent, the Kansas Jayhawks, brimming with over confidence.\n\n\"It would be nice if they overlooked us,\" said quarterback Anthony Mayo. \"It would be great to go in there and get a win because they're asleep or whatever. But it would be even better to get a win if they are prepared for us.\"\n\nDespite JSU's embarrassing loss to the Division II Lions, the Jayhawks won't likely take the Gamecocks lightly. They are well aware of Jacksonville State's every move.\n\nAt his Tuesday press conference, Kansas coach Mark Mangino said his sources told him that Jack Crowe was making a change at quarterback and will start Mayo.\n\n\"He throws the ball a little bit better,\" Mangino said. \"From the tape I watched from last season, he runs around pretty well. That is a misnomer, that he is going to just sit back there and throw the ball. He can do some things with that ball under his arm. They are going to run the option and power plays. They will get into some control passing.\"\n\nMangino said Kansas is not taking Jacksonville for granted, that the team is approaching the game with the same preparation and work that it does for any opponent."
