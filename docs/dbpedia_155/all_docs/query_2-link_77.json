        "text": "Follow Akron Football on Twitter\n\nVeteran coach and Northeast Ohio native Mike Woodford is in his seventh season on Terry Bowden’s staff and second stint as a member of the program. In 2018, he takes over as special teams coordinator after tutoring the UA safeties for six seasons.\n\nIn 2017, the Akron defense was instrumental in winning the MAC East title, making a MAC Championship run, and appearing in the team’s second bowl in three seasons. In the final NCAA rankings, Akron was No. 7 in interceptions (19), No. 8 in defensive touchdowns (4), No. 19 in turnover margin (0.71), and No. 36 in red zone defense (0.800). Woodford guided the safeties, including senior Zach Guiser, a team captain, and sophomore Alvin Davis , who earned second-team All-MAC honors as he finished second on defense with 83 tackles, two break-ups, a TFL, an interception, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery.\n\nIn 2016, the Zips’ defense recorded 16 sacks, eight interceptions, and six fumble recoveries. For just the second time in program history (and first time since 1980), an Akron Zip earned Academic All-America honors. Junior safety Zach Guiser was a first-team selection, while redshirt senior captain James Turner was a second-team honoree. The duo headlined nine Zips on the Academic All-MAC team and were also awarded MAC Distinguished Scholar-Athlete honors.\n\nIn 2015, the Zips’ defense dominated Mid-American Conference play. Akron’s rushing defense (92.9) led the conference while ranking third nationally. Woodford mentored sophomore Zach Guiser, who moved into the starting line-up for all 13 games. He was the top defensive back, finishing fourth in team tackling with 59 tackles, two interceptions, five break-ups, and a fumble recovery. Once again, Guiser earned Academic All-MAC as well as MAC Distinguished Scholar Athlete honors.\n\nIn 2014, the trio of Johnny Robinson, Devonte Morgan and Bre’ Ford combined for 115 tackles (71 solo), four interceptions, three pass breakups, two fumble recoveries and a forced fumble for a defense that ranked in the top-40 nationally in eight defensive categories. Redshirt freshman Zach Guiser earned Academic All-MAC honors as well in 2014.\n\nDuring the 2013 campaign, Woodford saw a pair of players – Anthony Holmes and Johnny Robinson – anchor the Zips’ secondary. The pair combined for 92 tackles, four interceptions, five pass breakups, one blocked kick and one forced fumble. Additionally, Sean Graves earned Academic All-MAC Honorable Mention.\n\nIn 2012, one of Woodford’s pupils, Sean Graves, earned Academic Honorable Mention from the MAC.\n\nWoodford joined the Akron staff after spending the 2011 season at New Mexico following a three-year stretch at Illinois (2007-09).\n\nAs special teams coordinator at Illinois, Woodford was responsible for breaking in a brand-new kicking battery after the graduation of the squad’s kicker, snapper and holder from the previous season. Emerging in 2008 was placekicker Matt Eller, who broke the school record for field goals by a freshman and led the team in scoring with 84 points.\n\nWoodford’s tenure at Illinois marked the fourth time he and head coach Ron Zook had joined forces. The pair were part of the Kansas staff in 1983, the New Orleans Saints’ staff in 2001 and during Zook’s time as head coach at Florida. While at KU, the duo worked with Mike Gottfried, and Woodford has also studied under such coaches as Larry Smith, Lou Holtz and Jim Haslett.\n\nHe also helped a pair of Saints to Pro Bowl selections during his season with the NFL franchise, as safety Sammy Knight was a 2002 Pro Bowl starter and La’Roi Glover also was selected to the team.\n\nWoodford went to the Saints after spending two seasons at Middle Tennessee State as the defensive backs coach. Prior to that, he was the defensive coordinator at nearby Walsh University for the 1994-99 seasons and the defensive backs coach at Akron from 1986-91 with then head coach Gerry Faust (Terry Bowden was on the UA staff in 1986 as well).\n\nWoodford has a bachelor of liberal arts degree in history from Arizona and played safety for the Wildcats from 1978-81. After joining the program as a walk on, he later became a starter and was a member of the team that played in the 1979 Fiesta Bowl.\n\nWoodford, 58 (born Sept. 4, 1959), and his wife Lori were married in July 2014. He has two daughters, Michaela and Ellie, and two stepdaughters, Megan and McKenzie.\n\nWoodford's Year-By-Year Coaching Experience\n\n1982-83 – Arizona (graduate assistant)\n\n1983-84 – Arkansas (graduate assistant)\n\n1984 – Kansas (graduate assistant)\n\n1984-85 – Rhodes College (defensive backs)\n\n1985-86 – Middle Tennessee State (defensive backs)\n\n1986-91 – Akron (defensive backs)\n\n1994-99 – Walsh University (defensive coordinator)\n\n1999-01 – Middle Tennessee State (defensive backs)\n\n2001-02 – New Orleans Saints (defensive assistant)\n\n2002-03 – Florida (special teams/defensive backs)\n\n2007-09 – Illinois (special teams/defensive backs)\n\n2011 – New Mexico (defensive backs)\n\n2012-17 – Akron (safeties)\n\n2018- Akron (special teams coordinator)"
