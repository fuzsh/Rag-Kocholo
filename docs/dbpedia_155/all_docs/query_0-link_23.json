Bowden, who will complete his 34th season as coach at Florida State, will coach the Seminoles in the bowl game and finish his career as one of the winningest coaches in the history of major college football.\n\n\"The bowl game will be my last game as head football coach at Florida State,\" said Bowden. \"It's been a great 34 seasons.\n\n\"I'd like to thank my wife Ann and my family for their love and support. There were a lot of nights when I was on the road and not at home at the dinner table. We all know that's part of it.\n\n\"I'd also like to thank the coaches and their families who helped build the program into something that is special. You can't have a successful program without players and we have been blessed to have young men who are winners both on and off the field. I want to thank them and their families for committing 4-5 years of their lives to me and to FSU.\n\n\"Finally, I'd like to thank the University and FSU fans who have supported the Florida State program. We've got one more game and I look forward to enjoying these next few weeks as the head football coach.\"\n\nBowden was named National Coach of the Year six times (1979, 1980, 1991, 1992, 1996 and 1999), and a national award presented by The Fellowship of Christian Athletes bears his name. He led Florida State to national championships in 1993 and again in 1999, the latter being the first team in the history of the Associated Press poll to go wire-to-wire ranked No. 1.\n\nWetherell, who will retire from the presidency of Florida State when his successor is installed as president -- perhaps within a few months -- said Bowden's \"sterling personality and character\" personified Florida State University.\n\n\"Bobby Bowden is not only one of the most outstanding college football coaches in history but also a great man who you would want as a mentor to your children,\" Wetherell said.\n\n\"Every true Seminole fan appreciates all that he has done in service to the university and all that he has accomplished for its football program -- two national championships, 12 ACC championships, 14 straight seasons among the Associated Press' Top Five, two Heisman Trophy winners and a Rhodes Scholar, induction into the College Football Hall of Fame -- but more than that, he has been an off-the-field mentor to so many young men looking to their future.\"\n\nWetherell, who was one of those young men, said he hopes Florida State's Athletics Department will plan a celebration and recognition for Bowden during next year's football season.\n\nIn his own tribute to Bowden, Wetherell said:\n\n\"Bobby Bowden has served as our head football coach and inspirational 'friend-raiser' for more than 30 years. He led our football program to unprecedented success and established it among the nation's elite for many years. He set records of achievement on the field that will probably never be equaled.\n\n\"Bobby Bowden contributed in many ways to the overall success and advancement of a young and growing university, and the entire Bowden family is also a major part of this success story.\n\n\"I played for Bobby Bowden 45 years ago, when I was a young man, and he was an assistant coach under Bill Peterson.\n\n\"The bond between player and coach is strong enough, but our relationship forged even more powerful bonds as we worked hard for the university's advancement. With me and other presidents, Bobby Bowden helped raise public and private dollars to build some of the most impressive athletics facilities in the nation and to bring additional recognition to Florida State's academic achievements.\n\n\"Millions of Americans could see the good work and academic contributions of our university through the window of national television -- a window that winning football teams provide for their institutions.\n\n\"Bobby Bowden, in many ways, became the face of Florida State. It was his sterling personality and character that personified this university. And because his influence was so powerful, we were able to advance far beyond what many of us ever dreamed.\"\n\nAbout Bobby Bowden...\n\nBorn : November 8, 1929 in Birmingham, Ala.\n\nHigh School : Woodlawn High, Birmingham, Ala.\n\nCollege : Howard (now Samford) 1953\n\nCollegiate Football Experience : University of Alabama (QB), freshman; Howard (QB), sophomore-senior\n\nGraduate Degree : Peabody College\n\nWife : The former Julia Ann Estock\n\nChildren : Robyn, Steve, Tommy, Terry, Ginger, Jeff\n\nHEAD COACHING HONORS\n\n1977 Southern Independent Coach of the Year\n\n1979 National Coach of the Year (ABC-Chevrolet)\n\n1979 Southern Independent Coach of the Year\n\n1980 National Coach of the Year (Bobby Dodd)\n\n1983 Inducted - Florida Sports Hall of Fame\n\n1986 Inducted - Alabama Sports Hall of Fame\n\n1987 Region II Coach of the Year\n\n1991 National Coach of the Year (Walter Camp)\n\n1992 Neyland Trophy Winner\n\n1993 ACC Coach of the Year\n\n1996 National Coach of the Year (Home Depot)\n\n1997 ACC Coach of the Year\n\n1999 National Coach of the Year (Home Depot)\n\n1999 National Coach of the Decade Finalist (Home Depot)\n\n1999 ESPN College Team of the Decade (any sport)\n\n2006 Inducted - National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame\n\n2008 NCFAA Contributions to College Football Award\n\nCOACHING ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\nSecond winningest coach in major college football history with 388 career coaching victories\n\nThe only coach in the history of Division I-A football to compile 14 straight 10-win seasons (1987-2000)\n\nCoached the Seminoles to consensus National Championships in 1993 and 1999\n\nHis 1999 National Championship team is the first in college football history to go wire-to-wire as the Associated Press' No. 1 ranked team\n\nSet NCAA records with 11 consecutive bowl victories (1985-95) and 14 straight bowl trips without a loss (1982-95)\n\nRanks first among active coaches for winning percentage in bowl games and has led the Seminoles to 27 straight bowl games - the longest current streak in the nation\n\nHas guided FSU to 30 bowl appearances in 33 seasons, including 27 straight\n\nSince 1993, Florida State has played in the national championship game five times (1993 Orange vs. Nebraska, 1996 Sugar vs. Florida, 1998 Fiesta vs. Tennessee, 1999 Sugar vs. Virginia Tech, and 2000 Orange vs. Oklahoma)\n\nSince the inception of the BCS in 1998, FSU has reached one of the BCS bowl games six times\n\nPatriarch of the first father-son duo to lead Division I-A programs, let alone to lead them at the same time\n\nNational Citizenship Award (Fellowship of Christian Athletes) named after Bobby Bowden in 2004\n\nCOACHING STOPS\n\n1954-55 Assistant Football Coach/Head Track Coach at Howard (now Samford)\n\n1956-58 Head Football Coach and Athletic Director at South Georgia Junior College\n\n1959-62 Head Football Coach at Samford College\n\n1963-65 Assistant Coach (Receivers) at Florida State\n\n1966-69 Offensive Coordinator at West Virginia\n\n1970-75 Head Coach at West Virginia\n\n1976-2009 Head Coach at Florida State\n\n2009 Florida State Signees/Newcomers\n\nJustin Bright, 6-0, 180, S, Duncan, S.C. - RANKINGS: Ranked the 39th-best safety by Rivals and the 26th best player in the state of South Carolina...Prep Star All-Southeast selection...BIO: A three-star prospect according to Rivals and Scout.com who comes from one of the nation's top high school programs...named an AP All-State selection as a senior...registered 92 tackles and three picks in 2008...Byrnes won three straight state championships and was ranked No. 1 in the USA Today Super 25 to start the 2008 season...as a senior his Rebel squad went 14-1 and finished the year ranked eighth in the nation by MaxPreps and ninth according to USA Today...recorded over 100 tackles as a junior on top of four TFL, six PBU and four interceptions...according to ESPN, Bright 'thrives on contact' and he is a 'hard hitter'...recorded five tackles in the Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas...clocked at 4.47 in the 40...posted a high school GPA of 3.4...picked Florida State over offers from Texas A&M and Stanford.\n\nGerald Demps, 5-10, 190, S, Valdosta, Ga. - RANKINGS: Ranked the 27th-best safety by Rivals and the 33rd best player in the state of Georgia...a member of the ESPNU 150...the 72nd-best prospect in this year's class according to ESPN...

They have good players and we have good players. They just made more plays than we did in the end.\"\n\nThose late Miami (1-0, 1-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) plays put the Seminoles (0-1, 0-1) on the ropes in the fourth quarter as Miami held a 24-23 advantage early on in the final period.\n\nBlitzing from the cornerback position, true freshman Greg Reid violently slammed into 'Canes quarterback Jacory Harris and forced a wobbly pass that was intercepted and returned 31 yards for the go-ahead score by FSU defensive end Markus White.\n\nThe Seminoles then added a two-point conversion to go up 31-24.\n\nShowing his short memory and ability to bounce back from a big hit, Harris then led a scoring drive on Miami's ensuing possession that knotted the score at 31-31 with just over seven minutes to play.\n\nFollowing a 45-yard field goal by Seminoles true freshman kicker Dustin Hopkins with 4:11 remaining in the game, the Hurricanes marched down the field once again and Miami tailback Graig Cooper bounded into the endzone from three yards to give his team what would turn out to be the game-winning score.\n\nFor the game, the Seminole defense allowed Harris to complete 21 of his 34 pass attempts for a career-best 386 yards and two scores. Wide receiver Travis Benjamin accounted for 128 of those yards.\n\nThe one bright spot for the FSU defenders Monday night? Stopping the run as Miami mustered just 90 yards on 30 attempts.\n\n\"We held them against the run better than I thought we would because we've had tackle problems with injuries,\" Bowden said. \"We held them against the run better but boy, (there were) too many 'gimme' touchdowns. They deserve it because they schemed us. They put this guy here and that guy here so that we would mess up and we messed up.\"\n\nOffensively, Ponder finished with a career-high 294 yards on 24-for-41 passing. He tossed two touchdown passes but also had an interception.\n\nRichard Goodman and Bert Reed both had five catches apiece for the Seminoles for a combined 145 yards. Six other FSU players also grabbed a reception. On the ground, Ty Jones had a game-high 59 yards but the 'Noles had just 110 rushing yards.\n\n\"We fought, we never quit and that's good for the team character,\" FSU left guard and All-America candidate Rodney Hudson said. \"We had a chance to win the game and at the same time that (final) possession did not lose the game if we had done something better earlier. It's not one man's fault it's all of our faults. We played hard though.\"\n\nDown 14-10 at the start of the third quarter, Reid's 29-yard kick return sparked a scoring drive that allowed the Seminoles to recapture the lead.\n\nAfter completions to Goodman and Rod Owens put the 'Noles in scoring position, Ponder's nifty nine-yard touchdown run pushed the score to 16-14 before a missed extra point.\n\nA few minutes later, Reid once again served as the catalyst for a Florida State scoring drive. After his interception of Harris deep in Seminole territory, the FSU offense kicked into high gear.\n\nFirst Ponder hooked up with Goodman for a 28-yard gain and then a few plays later wide receiver Louis Givens took a reverse handoff 13 yards. Wide receiver Taiwan Easterling then proved the ruptured Achilles tendon he sustained in the spring was a thing of the past as he grabbed a pass and grinded out a 21-yard touchdown reception to put FSU on top 23-14.\n\nRated the consensus No. 1 kicker as a high school senior a year ago, Hopkins didn't wait long to make his presence known in a rivalry that has historically featured the kickers.\n\nThe Houston, Texas native put an exclamation point on a 64-yard drive as he set a new school record for an FSU player's first career kick with a 52-yard field goal. The lengthy three-point play put FSU on top 10-7 with 2:50 remaining before halftime.\n\nUnfortunately for the Seminoles, the excitement of Hopkins' successful debut was short lived as Miami had an answer.\n\nOn the ensuing drive, Harris orchestrated a 75-yard drive that was culminated by a five-yard Javarris James touchdown dive.\n\nFSU tried to answer but Ponder's attempted pass to Goodman in the endzone was intercepted by Miami safety Randy Phillips just before intermission.\n\nFlorida State scored its first touchdown of the young season on the team's very first offensive possession.\n\nAlready trailing 7-0 after an opening-drive Miami score, Ponder capped off a 13-play drive with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Piurowski in the back left side of the north endzone.\n\nIt's now a short week for the Seminoles as they will begin preparations to host Jacksonville State at home on Saturday at 6 p.m.\n\nESPN will air that ballgame online at www.espn360.com.\n\n\"I hope the guys see it as an opportunity,\" Ponder said. \"We have an opportunity to bounce back and what we saw tonight we have a good football team. We have 11 more games and this is game number one.\"\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Miami 7 7 3 21 38 Florida State 7 3 13 11 34\n\n1st 0- 7 Opp, 39, pass (kick), 12:02 7- 7 Caz Piurowski, 10, pass from Christian Ponder (Dustin Hopkins, kick), 4:55 2nd 10- 7 Dustin Hopkins, 52, field goal, 2:50 10-14 Opp, 6, run (kick), 0:42 3rd 16-14 Christian Ponder, 9, run (Dustin Hopkins, kick failed), 12:01 23-14 Taiwan Easterling, 21, pass from Christian Ponder (Dustin Hopkins, kick), 4:57 23-17 Opp, 18, field goal, 3:12 4th 23-24 Opp, 1, run (kick), 13:43 31-24 Markus White, 31, interception return (Richard Goodman, pass from Christian Ponder), 11:45 31-31 Opp, 24, pass (kick), 7:14 34-31 Dustin Hopkins, 45, field goal, 4:11 34-38 Opp, 3, run (kick), 1:53\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 21 22 Rushes-yards 30-110 30- 90 Passing 294 386 Att-Comp-Int 41-24-1 34-21-2 Total Yards 71-404 64-476 Punt Returns 0-0 3-7 Kickoff Returns 7-129 6-181 Interception Ret. 2-31 1-0 Fumble Returns 0-0 1-0 Punts 4-39.5 4-41.3 Sacks By-Yds 1-8 2-17 Fumbles-Lost 1-1 0-0 Penalties-Yds 5-35 9-74 3rd Down Conversions 6-15 5-13 4th Down Conversions 1-1 1-1 Time of Posession 31:25 28:35 Attendance 81,077 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Ty Jones 14 59 0 27 Christian Ponder 8 28 1 30 Louis Givens 1 13 0 13 Jermaine Thomas 7 10 0 6 --------------------------------------------- FSU 30 110 1 30 Opp 30 90 3 15 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Richard Goodman 5 82 0 28 Bert Reed 5 63 0 34 Jarmon Fortson 3 53 0 26 Caz Piurowski 3 33 1 15 Rod Owens 3 31 0 19 Taiwan Easterling 2 21 1 21t Jermaine Thomas 2 7 0 5 Beau Reliford 1 4 0 4 --------------------------------------------- FSU 24 294 2 34 Opp 21 386 2 40 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Christian Ponder 24 41 1 294 2 34 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 24 41 1 294 2 34 Opp 21 34 2 386 2 40 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------- FSU 0 0 0 Opp 3 7 0 6 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Greg Reid 3 100 0 51 Taiwan Easterling 1 19 0 19 Vincent Zann 1 8 0 8 Lonnie Pryor 1 2 0 2 Matt Dunham 1 0 0 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 7 129 0 51 Opp 6 181 0 63 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Shawn Powell 4 158 49 ---------------------------------------- FSU 4 158 49 Opp 4 165 48 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jamie Robinson 3 4 7 . . . 2 . . . . .

I never played a ballgame in my life where so many things went wrong.\"\n\nAnd Coach Bowden was right; the Seminoles just couldn't catch a break against the Gamecocks (0-2).\n\nA big third-down stand by the Seminoles midway through the fourth quarter was then wiped out when senior cornerback Patrick Robinson roughed the kicker on the ensuing punt.\n\nMcNeil blocked a field goal late in the third quarter but the offense couldn't turn it into any points. Senior wide receiver Louis Givens took a long pass-play down near the goal-line but fumbled at the end of the run.\n\nThat was just the type of night it was for an FSU team looking to rebound after a heart-wrenching loss to Miami just a few days prior.\n\nThe only real highlight for the Seminoles before the final few moments was Jones' seven-yard rumble into the endzone late in the first quarter. The scoring play, which put FSU on top 7-6, was set up by a career-best 53-yard reception by Piurowski.\n\nFor the game, Ponder broke the career-high he set against the Hurricanes as he finished the game against the Gamecocks with 324 yards passing.\n\nPonder's first-ever 300-yard passing game was made possible by his ability to spread the wealth. Just like he did against Miami, FSU's starting signal-caller connected with eight different pass-catchers.\n\nGoodman led the 'Noles with eight catches for 80 yards while Rod Owens had four grabs for 47 yards. Piurowski added 78 yards on two catches.\n\nIn addition to his 30 receiving yards, Jones led the Seminoles with 40 yards on eight carries.\n\nDefensively, redshirt freshman rover Nick Moody made the most of his first-ever start as he finished with 10 tackles. Senior Kendall Smith also posted 10 stops from his Mike linebacker spot.\n\nDefensive captain Dekoda Watson paced his unit with an impressive 3.5 sacks and nine tackles.\n\nFlorida State will now head to Utah for a tough matchup with No. 9 BYU on Saturday. That game will be aired nationally on the Versus Network and is slated for a 7 p.m. EST kickoff.\n\n\"You can't keep making mistakes if you expect to win any more of these games,\" Bowden said.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Jacksonville State 6 3 0 0 9 Florida State 7 0 0 12 19\n\n1st 0- 6 Opp, 28, pass (run failed), 11:03 7- 6 Ty Jones, 7, run (Dustin Hopkins, kick), 1:25 2nd 7- 9 Opp, 37, field goal, 7:47 7- 9 Dustin Hopkins, 47, field goal failed, 0:29 3rd 7- 9 Opp, 38, field goal blocked by Kevin McNeil, 4:03 4th 13- 9 Ty Jones, 1, run (Dustin Hopkins, kick failed), 0:35 19- 9 Kevin McNeil, 33, fumble recovery/return (Dustin Hopkins, kick failed), 0:21\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 15 15 Rushes-yards 26- 78 41- 97 Passing 324 213 Att-Comp-Int 35-22-0 27-12-0 Total Yards 61-402 68-310 Punt Returns 5-19 2-18 Kickoff Returns 2-54 3-66 Interception Ret. 0-0 0-0 Fumble Returns 1-33 3-3 Punts 6-44.2 8-40.1 Sacks By-Yds 7-36 2-25 Fumbles-Lost 5-3 2-1 Penalties-Yds 6-51 8-321 3rd Down Conversions 5-14 6-18 4th Down Conversions 0-1 0-1 Time of Posession 27:21 32:39 Attendance 71,420 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Ty Jones 8 40 2 19 Louis Givens 1 15 0 15 Jermaine Thomas 2 8 0 5 Christian Ponder 7 7 0 21 Chris Thompson 5 7 0 10 Bert Reed 3 1 0 4 --------------------------------------------- FSU 26 78 2 21 Opp 41 97 0 17 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Richard Goodman 8 80 0 24 Caz Piurowski 2 78 0 53 Rod Owens 4 47 0 16 Louis Givens 1 40 0 40 Jarmon Fortson 2 33 0 29 Ty Jones 3 30 0 12 Taiwan Easterling 1 19 0 19 Jermaine Thomas 1 -3 0 -3 --------------------------------------------- FSU 22 324 0 53 Opp 12 213 1 59 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Christian Ponder 22 35 0 324 0 53 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 22 35 0 324 0 53 Opp 12 27 0 213 1 59 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Greg Reid 3 16 0 12 Bert Reed 1 3 0 3 Mister Alexander 1 0 0 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 5 19 0 12 Opp 2 18 0 12 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Greg Reid 1 36 0 36 Nigel Bradham 1 18 0 18 --------------------------------------------- FSU 2 54 0 36 Opp 3 66 0 28 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Shawn Powell 6 265 64 ---------------------------------------- FSU 6 265 64 Opp 8 321 47 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nick Moody 7 3 10 0.5- 3.0 0.5- 3.0 . 1 . . . . .

STARTERS\n\nFlorida State 54, Brigham Young 28\n\n09/19/2009, Provo, Utah\n\nFrom the FSU Website, seminoles.com.\n\nFSU Blasts No. 7 BYU, 54-28.\n\nSeminoles go out to Provo, Utah and end No. 7 BYU's 18-game home winning streak as Florida State churns out over 500 yards of offense.\n\nPROVO, UT - The Cougars never had a chance...and now the Seminoles will be bringing some turf back to the east coast.\n\nUnderdogs to the seventh-ranked team in the nation, the Florida State football team went out to Provo, Utah Saturday night and blasted BYU 54-21 to put an end to the Cougar's 18-game home winning streak.\n\nIn doing so, senior team captain Dekoda Watson will bring home a chunk of the turf to bury in the program's storied Sod Cemetary on campus.\n\n\"It was a really an unexpected win, especially with that kind of score,\" said FSU head coach Bobby Bowden, whose team generated 511 yards of offense. \"I think tonight shows you we are getting back.\"\n\nFSU starting quarterback Christian Ponder was masterful in the mountains as he completed 21 of his 25 pass attempts for 195 yards, two touchdowns and no turnovers as the Seminoles (2-1, 0-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) moved to a perfect 7-0 when the redshirt junior doesn't throw an interception.\n\nWhile Ponder was efficiently moving the ball through the air, a stable of tailbacks held it down on the ground after struggling through the first two games of the year. Ty Jones led the way with 109 yards on 13 carries and Lonnie Pryor added 50 yards and two scores on seven rushes.\n\nEven Ponder had success toting the ball as he amassed 79 yards and a score on 11 carries as FSU rushed for a team total of 313 yards.\n\nThrough the air, Jarmon Fortson and Rod Owens had four catches each for a combined 90 yards. Bert Reed had 34 yards receiving and Caz Piurowski had 38 of his own for a Seminole offense that scored the second most points ever allowed by BYU (2-1) on its home field.\n\nDefensively, the Seminoles had difficulty stopping a talented Cougars offense as quarterback Max Hall's unit posted 475 total yards. Still, FSU made plays when it had to as the team forced five turnovers and scored 17 points off those takeaways.\n\nA week after a sloppy win over Jacksonville State, the Seminoles looked like a completely different offensive team right away against the Cougars.\n\nOn the first drive of the evening, FSU marched 80 yards and got on the board first as Jones dove into the endzone from three yards out.\n\nThe Cougars were then threatening to score on their first drive but Budd Thacker forced a fumble and last week's hero, Kevin McNeil, scooped it off the turf. The stellar defensive play was followed up by another fantastic drive for FSU.\n\nThe 'Noles were methodical as they picked and popped the BYU defense on a commanding 18-play drive. Lining up at fullback in front of Jones, Pryor then scored his first touchdown as a Seminole as he slammed in for a one-yard score to push the FSU lead to 13-0 early in the second quarter.\n\nBYU was able to respond on the ensuing drive with a touchdown but the FSU offense didn't care. After Greg Reid took the kick-off to the 40-yard line, Jones' highlight-reel run of 47 yards put FSU on the BYU nine-yard line.\n\nOn the very next play, Pryor danced into the endzone from nine yards away for his second score.\n\nUnfortunately for FSU, it became apparent very early that the defense was going to have trouble stopping a potent Cougar passing attack. Luckily, Ponder and the offense came prepared.\n\nAfter a BYU score cut the FSU lead to 20-14, Ponder orchestrated another beautiful drive. Playing in his first game for FSU, redshirt junior tailback Tavares Pressley's 12-yard run put the 'Noles on the BYU five-yard line and then two plays later Piurowski snared a five-yard pass in the back of the endzone as FSU jumped out to a 27-14 lead with 24 seconds left in the second quarter.\n\nAnd they weren't done.\n\nOn the following kick-off, true freshman safety Jajuan Harley forced a fumble and kicker Dustin Hopkins was then able to drill a 33-yard field as the first-half clock expired to give Florida State a 30-14 advantage at the break.\n\nLooking to add to the lead, the Seminoles did just that at the start of the third quarter.\n\nWith BYU moving down the field at ease, Reid stepped in front of Hall's pass and returned it 63 yards to pay dirt. The interception was Reid's second of his career and the score was his first.\n\nOn top 37-14 against a Cougars team that had allowed just an average of eight points per game prior to Saturday's contest, the FSU defense forced the first BYU punt of the night. The offense then scored again when Ponder dove into the endzone a few minutes later to extend the Seminoles' lead to a staggering 44-14.\n\nThe Cougars found the endzone again, however, as an 80-yard scoring pass trimmed the lead to 44-21.\n\nA first-career interception by linebacker Nigel Bradham and a Hopkins field goal later, FSU's 47-21 lead then ballooned to 54-21 when Ponder connected with Fortson on a 16-yard touchdown pass for the team's final score.\n\nNext up for the Seminoles is a home game against South Florida on Saturday. Fans are encouraged to come to Doak Campbell Stadium sporting white shirts as the team will don all-white uniforms at home for the fist time in program history.\n\nThat game is slated for a noon kick-off.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Florida State 7 23 14 10 54 Brigham Young 0 14 7 7 28\n\n1st 7- 0 Ty Jones, 4, run (Dustin Hopkins, kick), 10:05 2nd 13- 0 Lonnie Pryor, 1, run (Dustin Hopkins, kick failed), 14:25 13- 7 Opp, 12, run (kick), 9:39 20- 7 Lonnie Pryor, 9, run (Dustin Hopkins, kick), 8:25 20-14 Opp, 3, pass (kick), 5:11 27-14 Caz Piurowski, 5, pass from Christian Ponder (Dustin Hopkins, kick), 0:24 30-14 Dustin Hopkins, 33, field goal, 0:00 3rd 37-14 Greg Reid, 63, interception return (Dustin Hopkins, kick), 12:52 44-14 Christian Ponder, 6, run (Dustin Hopkins, kick), 5:11 44-21 Opp, 80, pass (kick), 4:59 4th 47-21 Dustin Hopkins, 35, field goal, 10:21 54-21 Jarmon Fortson, 16, pass from Christian Ponder (Dustin Hopkins, kick), 7:32 54-21 Dustin Hopkins, 42, field goal failed, 4:51 54-28 Opp, 29, pass (kick), 3:13\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 27 20 Rushes-yards 49-313 19-108 Passing 199 365 Att-Comp-Int 28-22-0 34-23-3 Total Yards 77-512 53-473 Punt Returns 0-0 0-0 Kickoff Returns 3-71 2-23 Interception Ret. 3-97 0-0 Fumble Returns 2-0 0-0 Punts 1-38.0 1-43.0 Sacks By-Yds 1-5 0-0 Fumbles-Lost 1-0 2-2 Penalties-Yds 9-74 3-24 3rd Down Conversions 12-15 3-6 4th Down Conversions 0-0 0-1 Time of Posession 39:51 20:09 Attendance 64,209 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Ty Jones 12 108 1 47 Christian Ponder 11 77 1 12 Lonnie Pryor 7 50 2 24 Tavares Pressley 7 25 0 12 Jermaine Thomas 6 23 0 6 Louis Givens 1 11 0 11 E.J.

We self-destructed but no taking anything away from them. They whooped us.\"\n\nBlame the turnovers and FSU's inability to make the most of its opportunities in the meltdown. In total, the Seminoles lost four fumbles and only scored once in the four times they reached the redzone.\n\nThe defense also allowed Tallahassee native B.J. Daniels to toss two 70-plus-yard scoring passes and also become the first opposing signal-caller to rush for over 100 yards since Nebraska's Steve Taylor did so way back in 1986.\n\nDaniels finished the game with 126 yards on 23 carries and had just eight completions but they totaled 215 yards. He also had two interceptions.\n\nHis counterpart, Seminoles quarterback Christian Ponder, was noticeably different after his heroics at BYU left him banged up and hurting. Ponder never had much time to throw on Saturday and completed 25 of his 37 passes for 269 with no touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\nBert Reed led the FSU receivers with career highs in both catches (nine) and yards (114). The Seminole rushing attack was non-existent as the team mustered just 19 yards on 27 carries.\n\nFor the game, USF out-gained FSU 368-288. Both teams had over 80 yards in penalties.\n\n\"I have been in their shoes so many times,\" Bowden said about the Bulls' upset victory.\n\nDesperately in need of anything to light a spark of momentum, defensive back Greg Reid just about did that.\n\nWith his team down 14-0 to start the fourth quarter, the electrifying true freshman's 54-yard punt return gave the Seminoles great field position and the offense finally made it count after a failure to do so all day.\n\nAfter a Ponder to Reed connection for 22 yards put the 'Noles on the three yard-line, Ty Jones bullied his way into the endzone and FSU cut its deficit to 14-7.\n\nBut that would be it.\n\nRedshirt junior defensive back Ochuko Jenije's second interception of the day with just a few minutes left in the fourth quarter appeared to be what FSU needed. But on the Seminoles' very first play of the resulting drive Ponder lost the ball on a sack and USF recovered.\n\nThe Bulls added a field goal and the resulting 17-7 score wouldn't change.\n\n\"When I look at this film, the way we got beat up-front on offense,\" Bowden said, \"I didn't know they could do that. I think a lot of it was them just beating the guy. They just beat our blockers.\"\n\nThe first half was certainly one that any one associated with FSU will soon want to forget.\n\nThe Seminoles got all the way down to the three yard-line early in second quarter after Ponder connected with Reed for a 27-yard gain. Unfortunately for FSU, the USF defense dug in its heels and forced a four-and-out to keep the game scoreless.\n\nWith a successful goal-line stand serving as a catalyst, the Bulls quickly flew down the field on their ensuing possession. After a few runs got USF away from their own goal, a 76-yard pass from Daniels to Theo Wilson on a blown FSU coverage got them into the redzone.\n\nOne play later, Daniels found tight end Ben Busbee for a nine-yard touchdown to put the Bulls on top 7-0.\n\nOn FSU's very next drive, Ponder scrambled "
