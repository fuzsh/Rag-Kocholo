        "text": "Three years ago, the former Auburn coach Terry Bowden arrived at North Alabama and began to jump-start the careers of former top football recruits.\n\nThe Lions, a Division II program in the Gulf South Conference, won a lot of games, and a number of their players were drafted into the N.F.L. The team even held Pro Day workouts for scouts, a rarity at that level. Yet for all its talent, North Alabama failed to win a national championship under Bowden.\n\nHe was hired by Akron last December, leaving North Alabama scrambling. As a result of accepting so many transfers, some of whom left campus immediately after the football season, North Alabama did not have a strong base of underclassmen to build around.\n\nIn response, North Alabama brought a familiar face back to its campus in Florence. Bobby Wallace, 58, who last coached at West Alabama in 2010, was hired in January, the university clearly remembering the three consecutive national championships he led the Lions to from 1993 to 1995.\n\nWallace’s mission is not to instantly win titles. (North Alabama is 3-1 heading into Saturday’s game against Shorter University of Georgia.) He must rebuild a program, one that has aspirations to move up to the Football Championship Subdivision, and shed the label of being a halfway house for troubled players, a Band-Aid for booted college stars who wish to repair their image before the pros.\n\n“There were 60 kids from the program last fall that aren’t here anymore,” Wallace said, “and a lot of that dealt with bringing in transfers because they came and played and then left.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
