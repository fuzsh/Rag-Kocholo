Former Pittsburgh Post-Gazette sports columnist Bruce Keidan would call these columns “loose items from a tight-leaf notebook.”\n\nAnd Peacock’s Michael Holley, late of the Boston Globe, said this style of writing was laziness in pursuit of glory when I went to Point Park College with him.\n\nBut I’m doing it today to advance future story ideas.\n\nAnd frankly, Tri-Cities sports fans need to be talking about these things.\n\nAnd even if this is lazy writing, I’m at least a good enough writer that I don’t have to devolve to write “if it’s peanut butter and jelly, I’ll take half.”"
