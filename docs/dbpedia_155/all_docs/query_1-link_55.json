        "text": "Former Florida cornerback Janoris Jenkins, who was dismissed from the team in April following his arrest on misdemeanor marijuana charges, is transferring to Division II North Alabama, Lions coach Terry Bowden confirmed Wednesday night.\n\nJenkins, an all-SEC selection in 2010, signed a scholarship with North Alabama on Wednesday. He will be eligible to play for the Lions this coming season under NCAA transfer rules and will have one season of college eligibility remaining. After injuring his shoulder late last season, Jenkins bypassed entering the NFL draft to return to Florida for his senior season.\n\nBowden, a former Auburn coach and son of former Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, said he talked to former Gators coach Urban Meyer, current Florida coach Will Muschamp and athletics director Jeremy Foley before deciding to extend Jenkins a scholarship offer. Jenkins also considered entering the NFL's supplemental draft.\n\n\"I talked to everybody that I could possibly talk to at Florida, who had a relationship with him,\" Bowden said. \"From Urban Meyer to Will Muschamp to Jeremy Foley, they all said he is a guy who made a mistake. But it does not represent his character or his time at Florida. They all thought he deserved a second chance.\"\n\nRead more: http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=6694712"
