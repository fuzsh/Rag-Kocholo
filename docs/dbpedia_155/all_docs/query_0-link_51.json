        "text": "The Alabama Crimson Tide football program represents the University of Alabama (variously Alabama, UA, or Bama) in the sport of American football. The team competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC).[6] The team is currently led by Kalen DeBoer. The Crimson Tide is among the most storied and decorated football programs in NCAA history. Since beginning play in 1892, the program claims 18 national championships,[7][8][9] including 13 wire-service (AP or Coaches') national titles in the poll-era, and five other titles before the poll-era.[9][10][11] From 1958 to 1982, the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, who won six national titles with the program.[8] Alabama then had a dominant run under head coach Nick Saban between 2007 and 2023, resulting in six further national titles.\n\nIt was not until 2009 that an Alabama player received a Heisman Trophy, when running back Mark Ingram II became the university's first winner. In 2015, Derrick Henry became the university's second Heisman winner.[12] The Crimson Tide won back to back Heisman trophies in 2020 and 2021, with DeVonta Smith and Bryce Young.\n\nAlabama has 965 official victories[lower-alpha 1][lower-alpha 2] in NCAA Division I (an additional 21 victories were vacated, and eight victories and one tie were forfeited). Alabama has won 34 conference championships (4 Southern Conference and 30 SEC championships), and has made an NCAA-record 77 postseason bowl appearances. The program has 36 seasons with ten wins or more (plus one vacated)[13][14] and has 46[b] bowl victories, both NCAA records.[15] The Crimson Tide lead the SEC West Division with 18 division titles and 15 appearances in the SEC Championship Game. The Associated Press (AP) ranks Alabama fourth in all-time final AP Poll appearances, with 61 through the 2023 season.[16][17]"
