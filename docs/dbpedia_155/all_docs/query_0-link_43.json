        "text": "College football celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2019, and coaches, players and teams from the state of Alabama were heavily involved in telling that story.\n\nEarlier this season, we counted down the 150 biggest moments — the greatest games, coaches, players, plays and controversies — in college football in the state of the Alabama. As part of looking back on 2019 and in case you missed it, we have compiled the complete list here.\n\nHappy holidays, and here's to 150 more.\n\n(NOTE: This list was compiled prior to the 2019 season, and thus does not include any “moments” from this fall.)\n\nSenior Bowl photo\n\n150. Tiger to Tider for Senior Bowl win (1994)\n\nThe Senior Bowl has been played in Mobile for nearly 70 years, but rarely has it had such a rich in-state flavor as did the 1994 edition of the annual North vs. South college all-star game at Ladd-Peebles Stadium. The North team held a four-point lead with less than three minutes remaining in the game, when Auburn quarterback Stan White fired a 50-yard touchdown pass to Alabama’s Kevin Lee to give the South a 35-32 victory. White was named the game’s Most Valuable Player after throwing for 174 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nBirmingham News file photo\n\n149. Kent Waldrep’s life-changing injury (1974)\n\nAlabama was on its way to a fourth straight SEC championship when it met lowly TCU at Legion Field in Birmingham on Oct. 26, 1974. The Crimson Tide ran away with a 41-3 victory, but one play in the second quarter changed Kent Waldrep’s life forever — along with that of Alabama coach Paul “Bear” Bryant. The TCU running back was paralyzed from the chest down after landing on his head while being tackled by several Alabama defenders and nearly died from complications of the injury. Bryant was at Waldrep’s bedside when he awoke after surgery, and the two became so close that Waldrep sat with Bryant’s family at the coach’s funeral in 1983. Waldrep later became an advocate for the disabled, and helped draft the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990.\n\nAP photo by Rogelio V. Solis\n\n148. South Alabama shocks Mississippi State (2016)\n\nSouth Alabama was widely viewed as a commuter school with a decent history in baseball and basketball before the football program launched in 2009. The Jaguars won their first 19 games while transitioning to FBS, then reached a bowl game for the first time in 2014. But the program’s signature win came in the 2016 opener, when they shocked Mississippi State 21-20 in Starkville. The Bulldogs led 17-0 at halftime, only to see the Jaguars storm back and take the lead on Dallas Davis’ 4-yard touchdown pass to Gerald Everett and the subsequent extra point with 57 seconds to play. Joey Jones’ USA team then held its breath as Mississippi State missed a chip shot field goal as time expired and the Jaguars were victorious.\n\nBirmingham News file photo\n\n147. Jacksonville State wins national title (1992)\n\nBill Burgess and the Gamecocks took home a national championship in their final season as a member of NCAA Division II, knocking off unbeaten Pittsburg State at Braly Stadium in Florence. JSU did it with defense, holding Harlon Hill Trophy winner Ronald Moore to just 83 yards rushing — less than half his average per game. Moore did return the opening kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown, but Jacksonville State rushed for 390 yards in rallying for the victory. Terence Bowens’ 5-yard touchdown run in the third quarter gave the Gamecocks the lead for good, and JSU’s Eric King batted down Pittsburg State’s last-second pass to clinch the victory. Though it would soon after move up to Division I-AA (now FCS), Jacksonville State became the first Division II program to win national titles in football, baseball and men’s basketball.\n\nBirmingham News file photo\n\n146. Alabama gets jobbed in Happy Valley (1983)\n\nWhat might have been one of the greatest comebacks in Alabama football history ended in bitter fashion on one of the most egregious blown officiating calls in recent memory. Facing reigning national champion Penn State at Beaver Stadium in State College, the Crimson Tide rallied from down 34-7 on the road against with three touchdowns to make it 34-28, and had the ball inside the Penn State 10 late in the game. Alabama quarterback Walter Lewis threw what appeared to be a go-ahead touchdown pass to tight end Preston Gothard in the back of the end zone, but officials ruled that he was out-of-bounds and the score was disallowed (there was no instant replay review in college football at the time). Penn State stopped Alabama on the next play and emerged with the six-point win. One of the officials on the crew (though not the one who ruled Gothard out of bounds) was later revealed to be Don Guman, the father of former Nittany Lions star Mike Guman, who was famously stopped by Alabama on the “Goal Line Stand” in the 1979 Sugar Bowl. Because Penn State was an independent at the time, the Nittany Lions supplied their own officials for home games.\n\nBirmingham News file photo by Joe Songer\n\n145. A Heisman hire at Auburn (1895)\n\nMost people know him only as the namesake for college football’s signature individual award, but John Heisman had a very successful career as both a player and coach in the late 19th century/early 20th century. After getting his coaching start at Oberlin and Buchtel in his native Ohio, Heisman came south to take over the program at what was then Alabama Polytechnic Institute in 1895. Playing schedules of only three or four games per year, Heisman’s Auburn teams posted a 12-4-2 record in five seasons. However, he gained notoriety as an innovator, developing such strategies as the “hard count” — calling dummy signals to draw opposing teams offsides — and the hidden ball trick, in which a player would hide the ball under the bulky sweaters commonly worn in the game of that time. Heisman was hired away by Clemson in 1900, then moved on four years later to Georgia Tech, where he achieved great acclaim as the “undisputed master of Southern football.” Upon Heisman’s death in 1936, New York’s Downtown Athletic Club (of which Heisman had served as athletic director) re-named its award for the outstanding player in college football in his honor.\n\nPhoto by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\n144. Rocky Block (2009)\n\nNational championships can often swing on one play at midseason, and that was certainly the case with Nick Saban’s first Alabama title team in 2009. The heavily favored Crimson Tide found itself in a 12-10 battle with Lane Kiffin and upstart Tennessee at Bryant-Denny Stadium, and a fumble by eventual Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram gave the Volunteers the ball back with a chance to take the lead and win the game. Tennessee quarterback Jonathan Crompton hit tight end Luke Stocker at the Alabama 27 to set up a potential game-winning field goal in the final seconds. That was when 350-pound Alabama defensive tackle Terrence “Mount” Cody stepped forward and blocked Daniel Lincoln’s 44-yard field goal attempt — his second blocked kick of the day — to preserve the two-point win. Alabama stayed unbeaten at 8-0, and went on the win its first national title in 17 years.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\n143. First Blue-Gray All-Star Classic held (1939)\n\nThe air was heavy with Civil War metaphors as the first college all-star game held in the state of Alabama took place some 74 years after the great conflict, in the city known as the “Cradle of the Confederacy.” Montgomery’s Cramton Bowl was the site of the first 62 of 63 editions of the Blue-Gray All-Star Classic, which pitted North vs. South and was typically contested on Christmas Day. The first game was played on Jan. 2, however, and Alabama’s Frank Thomas and Auburn’s Jack Meagher directed the Gray squad. Purdue’s Tony Ippolito scored the game’s only touchdown on a 2-yard run in the second quarter, giving the Blue a 7-0 victory before a crowd of 8,000. The Blue-Gray game was eventually outshined by Mobile’s Senior Bowl, and its position on Christmas Day meant that it rarely was able to secure Alabama or Auburn players (who were usually playing in bowl games the following week). The game survived until 2003, when a lack of a television sponsor ended its six-decade run.\n\nBirmingham News file photo\n\n142. Bill Curry and the brick (1988)\n\nAlabama fans have been known to take certain losses especially hard, and rarely was that more true than after a 22-12 loss to Ole Miss on homecoming in 1988. The Crimson Tide was held without a completion — with two quarterbacks combining to go 0-for-11 with three interceptions — and the Rebels scored twice in the final minute to win the game. When Alabama coach Bill Curry arrived at the football complex the following morning to tape his weekly television show, he found that someone had thrown a brick through one of the side windows of his office. The brick-thrower was never caught, and many wondered if Curry — a Georgia Tech man whose hiring at Alabama had been widely criticized — had staged the incident to engender sympathy from the more-reasonable portion of the fan base. Alabama bounced back to beat Tennessee the following week, and finished the season at 9-3. A little more than a year later, however, Curry resigned to take the job at Kentucky.\n\nBirmingham News file photo by Frank Couch\n\n141. UAB stuns Saban, LSU in Baton Rouge (2000)\n\nJust five years after forming its football program, UAB made an aggressive move into the FBS (then Division I-A) ranks in 1996. Having hired veteran coach Watson Brown to run the program, the Blazers slogged along as a semi-competitive team for the next four years. Brown’s program-building finally bore fruit in the third game of the first year of the new millennium, when UAB stunned LSU and first-year coach Nick Saban 13-10 on a September Saturday night in Baton Rouge. Tigers quarterback Josh Booty threw four interceptions, the last snared by UAB’s Chris Brown and returned to the LSU 17 with 25 seconds remaining. After two short runs and two timeouts, UAB’s Rhett Gallego drilled a 32-yard field goal on the game’s final play to give the Blazers the win. UAB would finish that season at 7-4, its first winning record on the Division I level.\n\nAP photo\n\n140. Re-born UAB wins Conference USA title (2018)\n\nIn just their second season since the program was restored after a two-year hiatus, the Blazers captured their first-ever Conference USA championship. UAB won its first seven conference games, but a 27-3 blowout loss at Middle Tennessee in the regular-season finale cost the Blazers home field advantage in the league championship game. So the Blazers went right back to Murfreesboro, Tenn., and were victorious the second time, winning 27-25 behind 156 yards rushing by Spencer Brown. Nick Holt’s 28-yard field goal with 3:03 remaining provided the winning points for UAB, which capped an 11-3 season with a 37-13 win over Northern Illinois in the Boca Raton Bowl.\n\nLSU Athletics\n\n139. Auburn loses ‘Earthquake Game’ at LSU (1988)\n\nAfter combining to win the two previous SEC championships, Auburn and LSU squared off at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge on Oct. 8, 1988. Auburn came in 4-0 and ranked No. 4 in the country, while LSU was 2-2 and unranked after back-to-back losses to Ohio State and Florida. In a near defensive stalemate, Auburn’s Win Lyle kicked a pair of field goals — one just before halftime and the other with 10:18 left in the game — to give his team a 6-0 lead. LSU quarterback Tommy Hodson then drove his team 71 yards for a touchdown, an 11-yard pass to a wide-open Eddie Fuller in the end zone on fourth-and-10 with 1:41 left. The crowd at Tiger Stadium erupted so loudly that the seismographs at the campus geoscience lab registered it as an earthquake, forever giving the game its name. David Browndyke’s extra point gave LSU a 7-6 victory. It would be the lone regular-season loss for Auburn, probably costing the Tigers a shot at a national championship.\n\nVincent Laforet/Allsport\n\n138. Shaun Alexander runs wild in Baton Rouge (1996)\n\nAlexander had never even started for Alabama when he suddenly became a household name on Nov. 9, 1996, against LSU at Tiger Stadium. Beginning the game as the Crimson Tide’s third-string tailback behind Dennis Riddle and Curtis Alexander (no relation), Shaun Alexander set an Alabama school record with 291 yards and four touchdowns on just 20 carries as the Crimson Tide routed LSU 26-0 for its 14th win in 15 trips to Baton Rouge. After a scoreless first quarter, Alexander ran for a 17-yard touchdown and a 7-0 Alabama lead at halftime. He added scoring runs of 73 and 72 yards — the former coming on the first play of the drive — in the third quarter to make it 19-0. He capped his evening with a 12-yard TD run in the fourth quarter, cementing his place in Alabama lore as a redshirt freshman. The win gave the once-beaten Crimson Tide the tiebreaker over the twice-beaten Tigers in the SEC West race, which it would need after a stunning upset loss to Mississippi State the following week.\n\nBirmingham News file photo by Philip Barr\n\n137. Tommy Tuberville escapes from ‘pine box’ to take Auburn job (1998)\n\nA week before his Ole Miss team was set to face arch-rival Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl, Tommy Tuberville denied rumors he would soon be headed to Auburn. Tuberville uttered the infamous phrase that if he ever left Ole Miss, it would probably be when he was carried out in a “pine box.” The Rebels lost to the Bulldogs 28-6 on Thanksgiving night, and two days later Tuberville was resurrected, er, introduced as head coach at Auburn. Tuberville’s first Tigers team went 5-6, but he then reeled off eight straight winning seasons, highlighted by a 13-0 finish and an SEC championship in 2004 and six straight wins over Alabama from 2002-07. He resigned following a 5-7 finish in 2008, but posted an 85-40 record overall in 10 seasons — 7-3 against Alabama.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\n136. Auburn’s unbeaten, nearly unscored-upon juggernaut (1913-14)\n\nLargely because he coached in the football dark ages of the pre-SEC era, Mike Donahue probably isn’t regarded among the greats of the game in the state of Alabama. But what his Alabama Polytechnic Institute teams did in 1913 and 1914 stands alongside what any team in the state has accomplished in terms of dominating the opposition. Donahue’s teams went a combined 16-0-1, outscoring opponents by a total score of 417-13. The 1913 team went 8-0, allowing its only points in a 14-6 win over Vanderbilt on Nov. 15 and a 21-7 defeat of Georgia in the regular-season finale a week later. The 1914 squad was even more defensive-oriented, not allowing a single point all year, but finishing 8-0-1 thanks to a scoreless tie with Georgia. Donahue also coached basketball, baseball, track and tennis at Auburn before leaving for LSU in 1923. His .743 winning percentage in football remains the best in Auburn history nearly 100 years later. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951, and Donahue Drive — which runs right past Jordan-Hare Stadium — is named in his honor.\n\nBirmingham News file photo\n\n135. Alabama’s last Rose Bowl championship (1946)\n\nThe Crimson Tide was a regular visitor to Pasadena in the 1920s, ’30s and ’40s, playing in the Rose Bowl a total of six times in 21 years and winning four of them (there was also a tie). Frank Thomas’ 1945 “War Babies” team — led by All-Americans Harry Gilmer and Vaughn Mancha — was as dominant as any of them, outscoring nine regular-season opponents by a combined score of 396-66. That set up a matchup with Southern Cal at the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day, and things didn’t go well for the Trojans. Gilmer ran for 116 yards and also caught a touchdown pass, as Alabama outgained USC 351 yards to 41 and built a 34-0 lead before the Trojans tacked on two meaningless touchdowns in the fourth quarter. Coincidentally or not, the Rose Bowl soon after made an exclusive agreement with the Pacific Coast Conference (the progenitor of the Pac-8/10/12) and the Big Nine (which became the Big Ten) to provide teams for the game each year. An SEC team would not play in the Rose Bowl game again until 2018, when Georgia beat Oklahoma in overtime in a College Football Playoff semifinal.\n\nBirmingham News file photo by Tom Self, Charles Nesbitt\n\n134. Derrick Thomas dominates Penn State (1988)\n\nThomas’ incredible 1988 season reached its zenith on Oct. 22 at Legion Field in Birmingham against Penn State. The All-America linebacker terrorized quarterback Tony Sacca and the Nittany Lions in an 8-3 Crimson Tide victory, totaling eight tackles and three sacks, breaking up two passes and recording a game-clinching safety in the fourth quarter. Alabama held Penn State to just 169 yards and eight first downs, but led just 6-3 before Thomas dumped Sacca in the end zone with 10:43 left to give the Crimson Tide a bit of breathing room. Thomas ended the season with an unofficial national record of 27 sacks (which didn’t become an official NCAA record until 1991) and 54 for his career. He won the Butkus Award as the nation’s top linebacker and enjoyed a legendary NFL career with the Kansas City Chiefs before his untimely death following a car accident in early 2000.\n\nTroy Athletics\n\n133. Troy State wins national title on Clem’s clutch kick (1984)\n\nIn what might be one of the most clutch kicks at any level in college football history, Troy State’s Ted Clem drilled a 50-yard field goal as time expired to give the Trojans an 18-17 victory over North Dakota State and the NCAA Division II championship in McAllen, Texas, on Dec. 8, 1984. Coach Chan Gailey’s Trojans finished that season 12-1, with their only loss 13-10 at North Alabama in October. But they won their final five games, including 42-39 thriller over arch-rival Jacksonville State to end the regular season, plus playoff wins over Central State, Towson State and finally North Dakota State. Quarterback Carey Christensen led the Trojans on the game-winning drive, which stalled out at the NDSU 32 with eight seconds left. Clem rushed onto the field and nailed the game-winner, giving Troy its first national title since an NAIA championship in 1968. Gailey left after that season to begin a long career as an NFL coach, but Clem was still around three years later in 1987 when the Trojans won their second — and last — Division II title, albeit in less-dramatic fashion with a 31-17 win over Portland State.\n\nAuburn Athletics\n\n132. Auburn stuns top-ranked Georgia (1942)\n\nThe Deep South’s Oldest Rivalry has known its share of stunning upsets over the years, but Auburn’s 27-13 victory over top-ranked Georgia ranks up there with any of them. Though technically a home game for Georgia, the contest took place at A.J. McClung Stadium in Columbus, which is far closer to Auburn than Athens. Wally Butts’ Bulldogs came in 9-0 and ranked No. 1 in the nation, having ripped through Florida and Chattanooga by a combined score of 125-0 the previous two weeks. Jack Meagher’s Tigers were 4-4-1 and coming off a 41-14 loss to Georgia Pre-Flight (a war-time team stocked with college stars). Georgia had a backfield featuring eventual Heisman Trophy winner Frank Sinkwich and all-time great Charley Trippi, but the Bulldogs’ legendary twosome was outshined on this day by Auburn’s Monk Gafford and Jim Reynolds. The Tigers rushed for 355 yards to just 37 for the Bulldogs, 31 of that by Sinkwich, who also fumbled in his own end zone to Auburn its final touchdown. The loss cost Georgia a shot at the national title; they instead settled for a 9-0 victory over UCLA in the Rose Bowl and a No. 2 finish behind Ohio State.\n\nAlbert Cesare/Associated Press\n\n131. Auburn beats Ole Miss on bad break (2014)\n\nAuburn and Ole Miss were ranked No. 3 and No. 4 in the initial College Football Playoff rankings in late October 2014, and it just so happened they were set to meet in Oxford on Nov. 1. The game played out as an instant classic, a 35-31 Auburn victory defined by one wild play — and wildly unfortunate, at least for Ole Miss — at the end. Rebels receiver Laquon Treadwell looked headed for a game-winning touchdown with 1:30 left when Auburn linebacker Kris Frost grabbed him from behind just before he crossed the goal line. Frost’s feet got tangled up with Treadwell’s, breaking his left leg and dislocating his ankle. Adding insult to (literal) injury, Treadwell fumbled the ball and Auburn’s Cassanova McKinzy fell on it in the end zone. A lengthy replay review overturned what was initially ruled a touchdown, and Auburn ran out the clock for the victory. The Tigers could not sustain their momentum, however, losing four of their final five games to fall out of the SEC and national championship races.\n\nVasha Hunt/AL.com\n\n130. AJ to T.J. for Alabama win over LSU (2012)\n\nAlabama and LSU had met twice in the previous year — splitting those two games — before the No. 2 Crimson Tide ventured to Baton Rouge to take on the No. 5 Tigers on Nov. 3, 2012. LSU led 17-14 when AJ McCarron and Alabama took over at their own 28 following a missed field goal with 1:24 remaining. Five plays later, the Crimson Tide was in the end zone, with T.J. Yeldon grabbing a swing pass from McCarron and rambling 28 yards for the touchdown with 51 seconds remaining. LSU could not answer, and eventual national champion Alabama had a 21-17 victory that remains one of the more exciting in the rivalry’s history.\n\nAL.com file photo\n\n129. Senior Bowl moves to Mobile (1951)\n\nThe first edition of the pre-eminent college football all-star game was actually played in Jacksonville, Fla., in 1950, but a group of businessmen led by Finley McRae secured the game the following year for Mobile’s then brand-new Ladd Memorial Stadium. The South beat the North 19-18 on Jan. 6, 1951, with Vanderbilt’s Bucky Curtis earning Most Valuable Player honors. Nearly 70 years later, the game is still played in Mobile, and still played at Ladd (which is now known as Ladd-Peebles Stadium). Over the years, it has featured the likes of Hall of Famers Bubba Smith, Terry Bradshaw, Dan Marino and LaDainian Tomlinson, as well as such Alabama and Auburn luminaries as Pat Sullivan, Bo Jackson, Derrick Thomas and Shaun Alexander.\n\nChris Graythen/Getty Images\n\n128. Troy scores an all-time upset at LSU (2017)\n\nAfter nearly pulling off a stunner at eventual national champion Clemson the previous year, Troy finished the job against No. 18 ranked LSU a year later. The Trojans jumped out to a 17-0 lead early in the second half and led 24-7 midway through the fourth quarter before LSU scored two touchdowns to get back in the game. Blace Brown intercepted LSU quarterback Danny Etling with 5 seconds remaining — the Tigers’ fourth turnover of the game — to seal a 24-21 victory for Troy. The Trojans continued their giant-killing ways the following year, winning 24-19 at Nebraska in Week 2 on their way to a third straight 10-win season under Neal Brown.\n\nRobin Conn/Huntsville Times file\n\n127. Auburn edges Mississippi State in forgettable 3-2 game (2008)\n\nIn a game that might have set college football back 30 years, Auburn edged Mississippi State 3-2 on Sept. 14, 2008, in Starkville. The Tigers’ only points came on a 36-yard field goal in the second quarter, while the Bulldogs didn’t score until Auburn’s Ryan Pugh was called for holding in the end zone — resulting in a safety — in the fourth quarter. Mississippi State was putrid offensively, gaining just 116 yards and going 0-for-14 on third down. Auburn was 3-0 and ranked in the Top 10 after the win over Mississippi State, but would finish 5-7. By season’s end, both coaches — Auburn’s Tommy Tuberville and Mississippi State’s Sylvester Croom — would be out of work.\n\nRick Stewart/AllSport\n\n126. Jay Barker leads Alabama to shootout win over Georgia (1994)\n\nAlabama and Georgia gave a sellout crowd at Tuscaloosa’s Bryant-Denny Stadium their money’s worth on Oct. 1, 1994, with the Crimson Tide scoring a 29-28 victory. In a rare passing display for that era, quarterbacks Eric Zeier for Georgia and Jay Barker for Alabama combined for 659 yards and six touchdowns in the game. The Bulldogs led 21-7 in the second quarter, but clung to a 28-26 lead when Alabama took over at its 49 with 2:10 remaining. Barker quickly moved the Crimson Tide into position for Michael Proctor’s 32-yard field goal with 1:12 remaining, which gave Alabama the one-point win. The Crimson Tide went on to finish 12-1, winning the SEC West championship for the third straight year. Barker finished No. 5 in the Heisman Trophy balloting. Zeier ended his career as the SEC’s all-time leading passer with 11,153 yards (he still ranks sixth).\n\nGlenn Baeske/Huntsville Times file\n\n125. Ray Perkins leaves Alabama for the NFL (1987)\n\nRay Perkins stepped into an all-time pressure cooker when he left the NFL’s New York Giants to take over at Alabama for his mentor, Paul “Bear” Bryant, in 1983. Perkins compiled a 32-15-1 record in four seasons in Tuscaloosa, winning a pair of memorable Iron Bowls, but never coming particularly close to an SEC or national championship. He resigned on New Year’s Eve 1986 to return to the NFL as head coach of the moribund Tampa Bay Buccaneers, of whom Alabama booster Hugh Culverhouse was owner. Perkins got a huge raise in the deal — his salary doubled from $500,000 to $1 million — but he didn’t make it through four years in Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers posted a 19-41 record, never winning more than five games, before Perkins was fired late in the 1990 season. He returned to college with one season at Arkansas State in 1992, then spent several more years as an NFL assistant. Most recently, he coached on the junior-college level and as a volunteer high school assistant in his native Mississippi.\n\nBirmingham News file photo\n\n124. Auburn's 'Amazin's' knock off No. 4 Tennessee\n\nNot much was expected of the 1972 Auburn Tigers following the departure of Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Pat Sullivan and All-America wide receiver Terry Beasley. Shug Jordan’s Tigers staggered through the season’s first two weeks, winning low-scoring games against terrible Mississippi State and Chattanooga teams before welcoming No. 4 Tennessee to Birmingham’s Legion Field on Sept. 30. The Tigers slammed Volunteers quarterback Condredge Holloway for a 10-yard loss on the first play of the game and never let up, claiming a hard-fought 10-6 victory. Terry Henley’s second-quarter touchdown provided all the offense needed for Auburn, which allowed Tennessee past its 30-yard line only twice all day. The Auburn team, dubbed “The Amazin’s” by fans and sports writers, finished 10-1 and No. 5 in the country.\n\nUniversity of Alabama athletics\n\n123. Alabama bottoms out under Ears Whitworth (1955-57)\n\nThere haven’t been many fallow periods for Alabama football in the last century, but the mid-to-late 1950s were the absolute nadir. Head coach Harold “Red” Drew was fired after a 4-5-2 showing in 1954, and replaced with J.B. “Ears” Whitworth, a popular former Crimson Tide player from the 1930s who had been coaching at Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State). Whitworth’s tenure at Alabama was an unmitigated disaster, plagued by player discipline problems and a series of embarrassing losses. His first Crimson Tide team went 0-10, the only winless full season in program history. The 1956 and 1957 teams each went 2-7-1, losing to Auburn by a combined 73-7. Whitworth’s Alabama teams also went scoreless vs. Tennessee for three straight years. Having seen enough, Alabama president Frank Rose confirmed in early November that Whitworth would not be retained for 1958. That move, of course, opened the door for the return of another former Crimson Tide player, this one much more successful — Paul “Bear” Bryant. In a sad postscript, Whitworth died a little more than two years later following a heart attack at age 51 while working as an assistant coach at Georgia.\n\nEric Schultz/Huntsville Times file photo\n\n122. Lutzie’s career cut short (2012)\n\nRarely has a more popular player come through the Auburn football program than Philip Lutzenkirchen, who played tight end for the Tigers from 2009-12. He scored five touchdowns as a sophomore in Auburn’s national championship season of 2010, none bigger than his 7-yard catch from Cam Newton in the fourth quarter at Alabama to cap the Tigers’ 28-27 comeback victory. “Lutzie” added another solid season in 2011 with 24 receptions and seven touchdowns, and looked poised to close out an historic career as a senior. But halfway through the 2012 season, Lutzenkirchen’s career was cut short due to a hip injury, which began as a torn labrum his junior year and developed into painful bone spurs. Despite his truncated career, Lutzenkirchen set the Auburn all-time record with 14 touchdown catches. Tragically, his life ended less than two years later in an alcohol related automobile accident on June 26, 2014 (Lutzenkirchen was a passenger in a vehicle being driven by a friend). His father, Mike, founded the “Lutzie 43” Foundation, and travels the country speaking to young people about the dangers of distracted and impaired driving.\n\nChip English/Press-Register file photo\n\n121. Alabama lands a whopper of a recruiting class (2008)\n\nThe Alabama dynasty under Nick Saban might have had its true beginning on Feb. 6, 2008, in various high school auditoriums around the Southeast. That was the day the Crimson Tide landed one of the greatest recruiting classes in college football history, a group that included Julio Jones, Mark Ingram, Dont’a Hightower, Marcell Dareus, Mark Barron, Courtney Upshaw, Barrett Jones and Terrence Cody, among others. Several of those players played major roles with the Alabama team that went 12-2 and snapped a six-game losing streak to Auburn in 2008, and some of them were still on the team when the Crimson Tide won its third national championship in four years in 2012. Alabama has piled on several more No. 1 recruiting classes in the years since, but it’s difficult to imagine any group having as long-lasting and deep an impact as the 2008 class, which set the foundation for arguably the greatest sustained run of college football dominance in the game’s history.\n\nBirmingham News file photo\n\n120. Bryant's student beats the master (1968)\n\nNot many of Paul “Bear” Bryant’s former assistant coaches had a great deal of success against him when they became head coaches, but a major exception took place in the Jan. 1, 1968 Cotton Bowl. Gene Stallings, who played for Bryant at Texas A&M and coached for him at Alabama, coached his Aggies to their first Southwest Conference championship since Bryant’s departure. The Crimson Tide, led by quarterback Ken Stabler, had failed to win the SEC for the first time in four years. Texas A&M took the lead just before halftime on a touchdown pass from Edd Hargett to Tommy Maxwell, then held on late for a 20-16 win when Northport native Curley Hallman intercepted Stabler in the final 30 seconds. A gracious Bryant eschewed a post-game handshake, instead raising a jubilant Stallings over his head in a “bear” hug.\n\nBirmingham News file photo\n\n119. At long last, Sullivan vs. Manning (1971)\n\nAuburn and Ole Miss didn’t play in the regular season between 1953 and 1972, which means two of the greatest quarterbacks in SEC history almost didn’t get a chance to face each other. Luckily, the Gator Bowl invited Pat Sullivan’s Tigers and Archie Manning’s Rebels to play square off at the end of the 1970 season, Manning’s senior year and Sullivan’s junior campaign. Ironically, neither head coach participated in the game, as Ole Miss’ John Vaught was recovering from a heart attack, and Auburn’s Shug Jordan had undergone an emergency appendectomy. Nevertheless, the game did not disappoint from either a competitive or quarterbacking standpoint. Auburn won 35-28 behind 351 yards and three touchdowns from Sullivan. Manning, despite playing with a brace on his broken left wrist, passed for 180 yards and a touchdown, and also ran for 95 yards and a score.\n\nScott Halleran/Allsport\n\n118. Tie with Georgia ruins Auburn's winning streak (1994)\n\nAuburn won the first 20 games of Terry Bowden’s tenure, going 11-0 in a probation-riddled 1993 season and then winning the first nine games of 1994. The Tigers looked to be well on their way to a 21st straight against Georgia, leading 23-9 early in the third quarter at Jordan-Hare Stadium behind 186 yards and two touchdowns rushing from Stephen Davis. The Bulldogs rallied, however, tying the game 23-23 on a pair of Eric Zeier touchdown passes in the second half. Auburn had a chance to win in the final seconds, but Matt Hawkins a 44-yard field goal attempt with 8 seconds left, and the game ended in a tie. Overtime would not come to the SEC until two years later. Auburn’s unbeaten streak — and its season — ended the following week against undefeated Alabama in Birmingham.\n\nAP photo by Dave Martin\n\n117. Tie with Tennessee ruins Alabama's winning streak (1993)\n\nAlabama was defending national champion, ranked No. 2 nationally and riding a 28-game winning streak when Tennessee rolled into Birmingham’s Legion Field Oct. 17, 1993. For most of the afternoon, it looked like Alabama was headed for its first loss in more than two years. Tennessee led 17-9 when Alabama took the ball at its 18-yard line with 1:44 to play. Jay Barker calmly drove the Tide 82 yards in 11 plays, keeping for a 1-yard touchdown to pull Alabama within 17-15 with 21 seconds left. The Crimson Tide then put the ball and the game in the hands of the best player on the field, as wide receiver David Palmer lined up at quarterback and kept on a sweep for a two-point conversion and a 17-17 tie. The Crimson Tide would go on to finish a mere 9-3-1 that season, but extended its unbeaten streak over one of its hated rivals to eight years.\n\nJulie Bennett/AL.com\n\n116. Turkey Day tradition is born in Montgomery (1924)\n\nIn what is regarded as the original “classic” between Historically Black Colleges & Universities, Tuskegee beat Alabama State 28-7 at Montgomery’s Cramton Bowl on Nov. 15, 1924. The Golden Tigers and Hornets would go on to meet every year through 1970, and then most years until 2012, playing the game on or around Thanksgiving Day. Tuskegee opted out of the Turkey Day Classic beginning in 2013, in order to participate in the NCAA Division II playoffs. Alabama State then moved the Turkey Day Classic to its own Hornet Stadium, and has has hosted a rotating group of opponents in recent years, including Stillman, Miles, Edward Waters and Mississippi Valley State. Tuskegee and Alabama State resumed their rivalry in 2017, but now play in early September.\n\nTodd J. Van Emst/Auburn Athletics\n\n115. Auburn makes an (at least initially) unpopular hire (2008)\n\nNine days after Tommy Tuberville’s resignation, Auburn athletic director Jay Jacobs got off a plane on Dec. 13, 2008, with Gene Chizik in tow to become the Tigers’ next head coach. Auburn fans were stunned, and one even went so far as the heckle Chizik and Jacobs in view of TV cameras. Chizik had been Auburn’s defensive coordinator from 2002-04 and had been part of a national championship staff at Texas in 2005, but had compiled a 5-19 record in two seasons as head coach at Iowa State. Chizik’s first Auburn team went 8-5, but his second went 14-0 and won the school’s first national championship in 43 years. Things went downhill from there, however, and Chizik was fired at the end of the 2012 season.\n\nBirmingham News file photo by Edward Jones\n\n114. Del Greco kicks Auburn to Sugar Bowl victory over Michigan (1984)\n\nOnce-beaten Auburn met 9-2 Michigan in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 2, 1984, a game overshadowed by Nebraska’s quest for perfection vs. Miami in the Orange Bowl that same night. The Tigers had managed just a pair of Al Del Greco field goals through three quarters, and trailed 7-6 when they took the ball at their 38 midway through the fourth. Auburn marched methodically with a 15-play drive, including a key 6-yard run by Lionel James on fourth-and-2. Del Greco lined up for a chip-shot 19-yarder with 21 seconds left, and drilled it through the uprights to give Auburn a 9-7 victory and an 11-1 season. No. 2 Texas — which dealt Auburn its only defeat of the season — had lost earlier in the day to No. 4 Georgia in the Cotton Bowl, and Miami beat top-ranked Nebraska 31-30 in the Orange Bowl. Despite being the highest-ranked team that won that day, the No. 3 Tigers were denied the national title when the Hurricanes jumped from No. 5 to No. 1 after beating the seemingly unbeatable Cornhuskers.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\n113. The Blue-Gray Classic integrates under pressure (1965)\n\nThe Blue-Gray All-Star Classic was an all-white affair for nearly 25 years, and like most institutions only integrated when it became an economic necessity. NBC dropped the game from its TV schedule in 1963 under pressure from sponsors, forcing the Montgomery Lions Club to finally join the 20th century and integrate. Two years later, four black players — Purdue end Jim Long, Iowa tackle Bill Briggs and the Florida A&M duo of halfback Eugene Thomas and tackle Johnny Holmes — participated in the 1965 Blue-Gray Classic, which was televised by CBS. The Gray team won 23-19 behind Texas A&I quarterback Randy Johnson, who became the starter for the expansion Atlanta Falcons the following year. Typically played on Christmas Day, Blue-Gray Classic continued on as a showcase for small-college players, including many from historically black schools. Mississippi Valley State’s Jerry Rice was Most Valuable Player of the 1984 game, when he caught two touchdown passes in a 33-6 Gray victory.\n\nVasha Hunt/AL.com\n\n112. Alabama 'steals' two hometown recruits from Auburn (2013-14)\n\nIf ever it appeared Auburn had the inside track to sign a pair of five-star recruits, it was with Auburn High School linebackers Reuben Foster and Rashaan Evans in 2013 and 2014. Evans was the son of a former Auburn running back, while Foster — a year older than Evans — merely had the Auburn logo tattooed on his arm. Nevertheless, the two both signed with Alabama. Foster’s recruitment was particularly circuitous, as he first committed to Alabama before de-committing and pledging to Auburn, before ultimately re-committing to Alabama. Evans kept his plans close to the vest, not announcing for either school before putting on a Crimson Tide hat on national signing day. Foster and Evans contributed to Alabama’s 2015 national title team, then Foster was a unanimous All-American and Butkus Award winner the following year. Evans then starred on the Crimson Tide’s national title team in 2017, when he was named All-American. Both were first-round NFL draft picks.\n\nBirmingham News file photo by Bernard Troncale\n\n111. Simply 'The Sack' (1986)\n\nAlabama had never beaten Notre Dame when the Fighting Irish visited Legion Field on Oct. 4, 1986. The Crimson Tide left with not only a 28-10 victory, but one of the iconic moments in program history. It was in the first quarter when Cornelius Bennett, Alabama’s All-America linebacker, slammed Notre Dame quarterback Steve Beuerlein to the turf in a play known ever after as “The Sack.” Beuerlein stayed in the game despite a concussion (sports medicine was different in those days), but the day belonged to Alabama. Greg Richardson ran a punt back 66 yards for a touchdown and Mike Shula threw three touchdown passes as the Crimson Tide improved to 4-0. The image of Bennett annihilating Beuerlein has since been immortalized as one of artist Daniel Moore’s most popular paintings.\n\nAL.com file photo\n\n110. Wallace Wade walks (1930)\n\nWade was the first great football coach in Alabama history, leading the Crimson Tide to four Southern Conference championships and three Rose Bowls from 1923-30. But he was by many accounts a disagreeable man, and never quite got along with university president George Denny. After back-to-back disappointing seasons in 1928 and 1929, Wade decided he’d had enough and agreed to a five-year contract at Duke, to begin with the 1931 season. That meant he had one last hurrah at Alabama, and his 1930 team went 10-0 and smashed Washington State 24-0 in the Rose Bowl. He coached a total of 16 years at Duke (minus four years of military duty during World War II), retiring after the 1950 season with 110 victories and six conference championships. Duke’s stadium was named in his honor in 1967.\n\nJulie Bennett/AL.com\n\n109. Auburn collapses under Gene Chizik (2012)\n\nThe Tigers were on top of the football world in early 2011, having just won the program’s first national championship in more than 50 years following an undefeated season under third-year coach Gene Chizik. The Tigers slipped to 8-5 in 2011, but still managed to win the Chick-fil-A. A turbulent offseason included the departure of both coordinators (including Gus Malzahn taking the head-coaching job at Arkansas State), the suspension and transfer of star running back Mike Dyer and the shooting death of former players Ed Christian and LaDarius Phillips. Things got no better once the 2012 season started, as the Tigers lost seven of their first eight games, many of them in blowout fashion. After getting blanked by arch-rivals Georgia (38-0) and Alabama (49-0) in November and finishing 0-8 in the SEC, Chizik was fired, a mere two years after winning a national title.\n\nBirmingham News file photo\n\n108. Southern Miss ends Alabama’s streak (1982)\n\nBy midway through the 1982 season, the cracks had begun to show in the Alabama dynasty of coach Paul “Bear” Bryant. The Crimson Tide lost to Tennessee and LSU, the first time in five years it had lost multiple SEC games in the same season. But the biggest shocker came on Nov. 13, when a Southern Miss team led by dynamic quarterback Reggie Collier beat Alabama 38-29 at Bryant-Denny Stadium. The Golden Eagles — who had tied Alabama 13-13 the previous year in Birmingham — scored the first four times they had the ball in dealing the Crimson Tide its first on-campus loss since 1963, snapping a streak of 57 straight victories. Alabama also lost to Auburn two weeks later, and Bryant announced his retirement a short time after that.\n\nPatricia Miklik/The Montgomery Advertiser via AP\n\n107. Auburn, Georgia go to overtime (1996)\n\nTie games were a matter of routine in major college football for more than 100 years, before the NCAA finally adopted an overtime system prior to the 1996 season. As it happened, the first overtime game in the SEC occurred in the Deep South’s Oldest Rivalry on Nov. 16 at Jordan-Hare Stadium. And it was a wild one. Georgia trailed by 14 points at halftime, but scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter — including a game-tying touchdown pass from Mike Bobo to Corey Allen on the final play of regulation. Both teams scored touchdowns and added extra points in the first three overtimes, then Torin Kirtsey’s 1-yard run gave the Bulldogs a 56-49 lead in the fourth extra period. Auburn had a shot to tie, but Dameyune Craig was stopped a yard short on fourth down to end the game. The two teams combined for not only 115 points, but 189 plays, 1,095 yards and 60 first downs. The game also remains famous for an incident that occurred in the first quarter, when Georgia’s live mascot, UGa V, tried to take a bite out of Auburn wide receiver Robert Baker on the sideline following a touchdown.\n\nMark Almond/AL.com\n\n106. Magic City Classic comes into its own (1945-1946)\n\nAlabama State and Alabama A&M, the two largest historically black colleges in the state, first met in football in 1924 (with ASU winning 30-0), but didn’t become annual rivals until the end of World War II in 1945. The game — by then dubbed the “Magic City Classic” — truly came into its own the following year, when it moved permanently into Birmingham’s Legion Field. Alabama A&M dominated the series in the 1960s and 70s, though Alabama State had the upper hand for much of the 1980s and 90s. The teams have been evenly matched most of this decade, alternating victories the last four years. The Bulldogs officially lead the all-time series 40-34, with four ties. The Magic City Classic is regarded as among the most successful annual HBCU games in the country, routinely drawing crowds of 60,000-plus on game day and more than 200,000 spectators for associated festivities such as post-game concerts, comedy performances, fraternity and sorority step shows, the pre-game parade and the always much-anticipated Battle of the Bands.\n\nAL.com file photo\n\n105. Richmond’s Revenge (1968)\n\nRichmond Flowers Jr. is one of the greatest athletes ever produced by the state of Alabama, a football star and world-class track and field star at Montgomery’s Sidney Lanier High School in the mid-1960s. In any other era, he’d probably have been a shoo-in to play football at Alabama. However, his father, Richmond Sr., was the state’s attorney general, and a bitter political rival of then Gov. George Wallace. After his father was booed during an appearance at a track meet in Mobile, the younger Flowers decided to leave the state and attend Tennessee, which was then a burgeoning track power. Flowers was a three-time All-American hurdler for the Volunteers, though a hamstring injury kept him out of the 1968 Olympics. However, he also made his mark on the football field, finishing his career as Tennessee’s all-time leading receiver and helping the Volunteers to wins over Alabama in both his junior and senior seasons. Flowers caught six passes for 57 yards in a 24-13 victory over the Crimson Tide in Birmingham in 1967, and scored the only touchdown on a 1-yard run in a 10-9 win the following year in Knoxville.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Paul W.

Lee Roy Jordan dominates Oklahoma (1963)\n\nThe Crimson Tide and Sooners had never played prior to a sunny New Year’s Day 1963 in Miami’s Orange Bowl, a game remembered because President John F. Kennedy was in the audience and because of an astounding defensive performance by Alabama middle linebacker Lee Roy Jordan. The All-American from Excel was credited with 31 tackles — 15 solo, 16 assists — as Alabama routed Oklahoma 17-0 to complete a 10-1 season. Sophomore quarterback Joe Namath also passed for a touchdown for the Crimson Tide, which finished No. 5 in polls, which were released prior to the bowl games. Alabama would not beat Oklahoma again until the 2018 Orange Bowl.\n\nPhoto courtesy of the Paul W. Bryant Museum\n\n103. Alabama knocks off powerhouse Penn (1922)\n\nSouthern college football was mostly an unknown quantity in the first 25 years of the 20th century, though Georgia Tech began enjoying success against teams from outside the region in the late 1910s. Alabama football began to mature in 1919, when the school hired a young Ohio native named Xen C. Scott to run the program. Scott’s first two teams went a combined 18-2, before backsliding to 5-4-2 in 1921. It was an otherwise non-descript 1922 team that put Crimson Tide football on the national map, scoring a 9-7 win over Ivy League power Pennsylvania at Franklin Field in Philadelphia on Nov. 4. So stunning was the Alabama win over Penn that Philadelphia Inquirer sports writer Perry Lewis wrote that the Crimson Tide \"[flooded] the eyes of the Quakers with tears, and [inundated] the new stadium beneath a Niagara of grief, desolation and blasted hopes.” Scott did not get to build on his breakthrough win at Alabama, as he was forced to resign following the season due to an advanced case of cancer. He died less than two years later at age 41.\n\nBirmingham News file photo by Frank Couch\n\n102. Legion Field hosts its first game (1927)\n\nBirmingham’s reputation as the “Football Capital of the South” began in earnest on Nov. 19, 1927, when Legion Field hosted its first college football game. Built at a cost of $439,000 (about $6.5 million in modern dollars) and with enough seats for 21,000 fans, the stadium was hailed as an architectural marvel. Though Legion Field would host numerous Iron Bowls and other games between college football powers over the years, the first game featured Birmingham-Southern and Howard College (now Samford). Howard emerged with a 9-0 victory, or as Birmingham News sports writer James Saxon Childers described it, “the lads from East Lake tied a rather hard knot in the tail of the Methodist Panther.” The assembled crowd of 17,000 apparently got itself into such a lather that Childers devoted two paragraphs of his front-page game story to the dangers of throwing seat cushions from the stands, which the patrons at that first game apparently engaged in quite lustily. Legion Field, of course, is still up and running, home each season to the Magic City Classic between Alabama State and Alabama A&M and — for one more year — the UAB Blazers.\n\nPress-Register file photo\n\n101. Bryant makes his Alabama debut in Mobile (1958)\n\nThe 1958 season marked the return to Alabama of one Paul “Bear” Bryant, who took over as head coach at his alma mater after several seasons at Kentucky and then Texas A&M. As it happened, his first game as Crimson Tide head coach was not in Birmingham or Tuscaloosa, but in Mobile, where Alabama was set to meet eventual national champion LSU at Ladd Memorial Stadium on Sept. 27. The Crimson Tide took an early lead on a Fred Sington field goal, only to fade in the second half as the Tigers claimed a 13-3 victory. Billy Cannon, who would go on to win the Heisman Trophy as a senior in 1959, ran for 86 yards and a touchdown in the game. More notable was what happened off the field, as a large section of the end zone bleachers collapsed late in the first quarter, injuring more than 80 fans (some seriously) and delaying the game for several minutes.\n\nRobert Adams/Birmingham News file\n\n100. An early Iron Bowl shocker (1949)\n\nWhen you think of great Iron Bowl upsets, naturally the ones that come to mind are 1972, 1984, 2001, 2002 and 2013, among others. But considering the relative strengths of the two teams, 1949 might top them all. The Alabama-Auburn rivalry had only been revived the previous year after 40-plus years of dormancy, and the Crimson Tide had trounced the Tigers 55-0 in 1948. Alabama came into the 1949 game at Legion Field with a record of 6-2-1, while Auburn limped in at 1-4-3. And yet, behind touchdowns from Bill Davis (on an 11-yard run) and Johnny Wallis (on an interception return), the Tigers stunned the Crimson Tide 14-13. Alabama scored late to pull within a point, but Ed Salem’s point-after was no good and Auburn had beaten the Crimson Tide for the first time since 1904. The Tigers pulled off what Birmingham News sports editor Zipp Newman wrote was the sweetest Auburn victory in the program’s first 58 years.\n\nG.M. Andrews/Press-Register file\n\n99. Alabama snaps Iron Bowl streak in dominating fashion (2008)\n\nFrustration was boiling over for the Alabama fanbase in the early days of the 21st century, with a series of coaching changes and NCAA sanctions compounded by six consecutive losses to Auburn from 2002-07. Nick Saban’s hiring in the final year of that streak promised better days ahead, and the Crimson Tide delivered in a big way at Bryant-Denny Stadium on Nov. 29, 2008. Top-ranked Alabama won 36-0 behind 210 yards and three touchdowns rushing from Glen Coffee and Mark Ingram to finish off a perfect regular season. Auburn, which came in guaranteed a losing season at 4-7, totaled just 170 yards of offense and fumbled three times. Alabama went on to lose the SEC championship game to Florida and then in the Sugar Bowl to Utah to finish 12-2, but won the national championship the following year. Tuberville resigned at season’s end after 10 years, but the Tigers won their own national title two years later.\n\nBlake Sims/Birmingham Post-Herald via AP\n\n98. Carnell Williams chooses Auburn (2001)\n\nCarnell Williams was already a star before he left Etowah High School, in part because of the nickname “Cadillac” that had been bestowed on him by Birmingham TV personality Mike Raita. The drama of his recruitment in 2001 only added to his burgeoning legend. Williams committed to Tennessee during an official visit in early January, but Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville visited him at home the next day. Williams then made an official visit to Alabama on the weekend before signing day, setting his commitment announcement for the following Monday. Before a packed house of media and fellow Etowah High students, Williams pulled off his letter jacket to reveal an Auburn jersey underneath. It is not overstating it to say Williams signing with Auburn helped flip the direction of the Iron Bowl rivalry. Though injuries knocked him out of the big game his first two seasons, he scored on an 80-yard touchdown on the first play of the 2003 Iron Bowl at Jordan-Hare Stadium, sparking a 28-23 Auburn win. The Tigers beat the Crimson Tide again in Williams’ senior year, and were halfway to their streak of six straight victories.\n\nAP Photo/Chris O'Meara\n\n97. Auburn’s twin upsets of Florida (1993-94)\n\nAuburn reeled off victories in the first 20 games of the Terry Bowden era, including a pair of victories over a Florida program that was then in the midst of four consecutive SEC championships. On Oct. 16, 1993, the Tigers showed that they could stick together through NCAA sanctions, pulling off a 38-35 victory over the fourth-ranked Gators on the strength of Scott Etheridge’s 41-yard field goal with 1:21 to play. Auburn won in even more dramatic fashion in Gainesville on Oct. 15, 1994, with Patrick Nix connecting with Frank Sanders on an 8-yard touchdown pass with 30 seconds left as the No. 6 Tigers stunned the No. 1 Gators 36-33. Nix had perhaps his finest game at Auburn, completing 28 of 51 passes for 319 yards and three touchdowns. Auburn finished that year 10-1-1 after tying Georgia and losing to Alabama, for a pretty solid 20-1-1 showing in their first two seasons under Bowden.\n\nBirmingham News file photo\n\n96. Namath’s first knee injury (1964)\n\nJoe Namath was acclaimed for his athleticism early in his Alabama career, as gifted a runner and thrower as many had ever seen in the college game to that point. But Namath’s long legacy of injuries began during a 21-0 victory over North Carolina State in Tuscaloosa on Oct. 10, 1964. On a second-quarter play in a scoreless game, Namath rolled to his right and went down without being hit. He was treated on the field and helped to the sideline, ceding the rest of the game to back-up quarterback Steve Sloan. The extent of Namath’s injury was downplayed by coach Paul “Bear” Bryant at the time, but later tests would reveal he’d torn cartilage and damaged at least one ligament. Amazingly, he started the following week against Florida, but left the game early when the injury flared up. He then sat out two weeks before coming off the bench in victories vs. Georgia Tech and Auburn. Sloan started the Orange Bowl vs. Texas, but Namath entered with No. 1 ranked Alabama down by 14. He led a furious comeback before being stopped at the goal line in the final minute of a 21-17 Crimson Tide loss. Shortly after that, Namath was on to the New York Jets and a legendary career in pro football.\n\nHal Yeager/Birmingham News file\n\n95. Auburn goes pick-six crazy vs. LSU (1994)\n\nPerhaps no game ever turned so sharply on defense and inexplicable coaching strategy as Auburn’s 30-26 victory over LSU at Jordan-Hare Stadium on Sept. 17, 1994. The Tigers trailed 23-9 early in the fourth quarter — with their only touchdown on a Chris Shelling fumble recovery in the end zone in the first half — before going pick-six crazy thanks to a big assist from LSU quarterback Jamie Howard and coach Curley Hallman. With 12:14 remaining, Ken Alvis picked off Howard and returned the ball 43 yards for a touchdown to make it a 23-16 game. LSU kept throwing, and Fred Smith pulled off a pick-six to tie the game 23-23 with 11:02 left. LSU took a 26-23 lead on Andre LaFleur’s 22-yard field goal with 5:26 left, then forced an Auburn punt. Facing third-and-four at the LSU 32 with two minutes left and no timeouts for Auburn, Howard threw the ball AGAIN, with Brian Robinson intercepting it and going 41 yards for the winning touchdown. Auburn won despite being outgained 407 yards to 165, thanks largely to the generosity of Hallman (who would be fired after the season) and the snakebitten Howard, who threw five interceptions.\n\nJoe Songer/Birmingham News file\n\n94. Alabama hires Shula over Croom (2003)\n\nAfter the sudden departure of Dennis Franchione to Texas A&M following the 2002 season, and the off-field meltdown of Mike Price less than six months later, Alabama did not have a wealth of choices in making its second coaching hire of the offseason. The Crimson Tide was also in the midst of NCAA sanctions, limiting the pool of realistic candidates even further. Consequently, Alabama athletics director Mal Moore looked to stay “in-house” by hiring a Crimson Tide alum, narrowing his final three choices to veteran NFL assistants Richard Williamson, Sylvester Croom and Mike Shula. Moore passed on the opportunity to make history by hiring Croom, who would have been the first African-American head football coach in SEC history. Instead, Moore chose the younger (and white) Shula, who had never coached in college or even publicly expressed a desire to do so. Shula had ups and downs in four years as Alabama’s head coach, going 26-23 before being fired at the end of the 2006 season. Croom was hired the following year by Mississippi State, and went 21-38 with just one winning season among five in Starkville (he did, however, beat Alabama in Tuscaloosa in 2006, which might have hastened Shula’s departure). Both Shula and Croom went back to jobs as NFL assistants after coaching in college, with Croom retiring following the 2017 season and Shula still working as offensive coordinator of the New York Giants.\n\nBirmingham News file\n\n93. Alabama runs wild vs. Virginia Tech (1973)\n\nBefore the Tua Tagovailoa-led teams of recent years at least, the 1973 Alabama Crimson Tide was regarded as the greatest offensive machine in program history. That team — which won the UPI national championship that season — reached its zenith on Oct. 27, 1973 against Virginia Tech at Denny Stadium. The Crimson Tide hammered the Hokies 77-6, grinding out 828 yards of offense, 743 rushing yards and averaging 11.8 yards per carry — all three school, SEC and NCAA records at the time. (Houston smashed the total offense record by rolling up 1,021 yards in a 95-21 victory over hapless SMU in 1989, while Oklahoma topped the rushing mark by posting 768 in a 63-14 win over Kansas the previous year). Against Virginia Tech, Alabama had four different players top the 100-yard rushing mark — James Taylor with 142, Wilbur Jackson with 138, Calvin Culliver with 127 and quarterback Richard Todd with 102. The rushing yards and yards per carry remain SEC and Crimson Tide records to this day.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Paul W. Bryant Museum\n\n92. Alabama rolls in the Rose Bowl … again (1935)\n\nAlabama enjoying success in Pasadena had become routine by the mid-1930s, as the Crimson Tide won Rose Bowls following the 1925 and 1930 seasons and had tied Stanford following the 1926 season. Led by All-Americans Don Hutson and Dixie Howell, Alabama rolled to another undefeated season under coach Frank Thomas in 1934, pitching five shutouts and again earning an invitation to the Rose Bowl. Facing a powerful 9-0-1 Stanford team, the Crimson Tide unleashed what the Los Angeles Times’ Braven Dyer called the “most amazing aerial attack ever seen in the Rose Bowl.” In a 29-13 Alabama win, Howell threw touchdown passes of 54 and 59 yards to Hutson and also ran for scores of 5 and 67 yards. The Crimson Tide trailed 7-0 after a quarter, but scored 23 points in the second period to take control of the game. As many know, the “other” end opposite Hutson on that Alabama team was none other than Paul “Bear” Bryant, who would go on to some acclaim as the Crimson Tide’s coach years later.\n\nDave Martin/AP photo\n\n91. Tre Mason runs wild vs. Missouri (2013)\n\nIn a 2013 Auburn football season that featured the “Prayer at Jordan-Hare” and the “Kick Six” — in addition to a narrow defeat to Florida State in the BCS national championship game — the greatest individual effort likely took place in the SEC championship game in Atlanta on Dec. 7. Auburn running back Tre Mason piled up 304 yards and four touchdowns on 46 carries rushing — part of a 575-yard day on the ground for the Tigers — in a 59-42 victory over Missouri. Auburn led just 28-27 at halftime, but outscored Missouri 31-15 the rest of the way, including 14-0 in the fourth quarter. Both those touchdowns in the final period fittingly came on runs by Mason, who was named SEC Player of the Year after finishing with an Auburn record 1,816 yards and 23 touchdowns in 14 games.\n\nTom Self/Birmingham News file\n\n90. Kenny Stabler’s Iron Bowl ‘Run in the Mud’ (1967)\n\nThe 1967 Iron Bowl wasn’t particularly meaningful in terms of SEC or national stakes, as neither Alabama nor Auburn were in any sort of championship race. However, the Dec. 2 game in Birmingham featured one of the more notable individual plays in Iron Bowl history — Kenny Stabler’s famed “Run in the Mud” that gave the Crimson Tide a 7-3 victory. Alabama came into the game at 7-1-1, but an early-season loss to Tennessee had moved the Crimson Tide out of the driver’s seat for a fourth straight SEC title (the Volunteers locked up the conference title by beating Vanderbilt 41-14 that same day). Auburn was 6-3 and had been blanked by Georgia 17-0 two weeks earlier. Wind and rain turned Legion Field into a quagmire, and Alabama’s offense was especially poor. The Crimson Tide turned the ball over twice, and didn’t cross midfield in a scoreless first half. Auburn finally broke the stalemate early in the third quarter, when John Riley connected on a 38-yard field goal. A bad punt snap by Auburn gave Alabama the ball on its 46 as the clock ticked inside 12 minutes. After a pair of short runs moved the Crimson Tide to the Auburn 47, the “Snake” called his own number on third-and-3. He faked a pitch and then cut inside before breaking free down the right side and racing for the touchdown. Alabama made its 7-3 lead stand up, and had one of the most hard-fought victories in Iron Bowl history.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Paul W. Bryant Museum\n\n89. Bryant plays with pain vs. Tennessee (1935)\n\nAny Alabama player who ever begged out of the lineup while Paul “Bear” Bryant was coach was no doubt reminded of how Bryant didn’t let any old injury keep him off the field during his playing days. During Bryant’s senior season of 1935, he suffered a fractured fibula in a season-opening 7-7 tie vs. Howard (now Samford). Three weeks later, he was back in the lineup at end against Alabama’s most-hated rival, Tennessee, in Knoxville. His injured right leg heavily taped, Bryant caught at least four passes for 60 yards that day, as Alabama won 25-0. Birmingham News sports editor Zipp Newman wrote that Bryant “on one leg was the best end this commentator has seen all year.” But was Bryant’s leg really broken? Apparently. Atlanta Journal Constitution columnist Ralph McGill composed a follow-up story on Bryant a few days later and wrote “I saw the X-rays.”\n\nAP photo by Dave Martin\n\n88. End of an Iron Bowl era at Legion Field (1998)\n\nAfter a half-century of memorable Iron Bowls in Birmingham, Alabama and Auburn tangled for the final time at Legion Field in 1998. It was not a stellar season for either team. Auburn came it at 3-7 under interim coach Bill Oliver, Terry Bowden having resigned at midseason. Alabama was a mere 6-4 under second-year coach Mike DuBose, having already lost to SEC West rivals Arkansas and Mississippi State. The Tigers came out inspired behind true freshman quarterback Gabe Gross, building a 17-0 lead early in the second quarter. The Crimson Tide scored a pair of touchdowns late in the half to pull within 17-14, then took the lead for good on a 43-yard pass from Andrew Zow to Shaun Alexander in the third quarter. Alexander’s third touchdown of the day capped a 31-17 Alabama victory. The Iron Bowl series has been played on campus ever since.\n\nAuburn athletics photo\n\n87. Auburn, Syracuse play to Sugar Bowl deadlock (1988)\n\nThe only tie in the 85-year history of the Sugar Bowl remains a controversial one. Auburn trailed Syracuse by three with only one second to play, but had the ball on the Orangemen’s 13-yard line. Rather than go for the touchdown and the win, Tigers coach Pat Dye sent in kicker Win Lyle for a field goal try. Lyle was true on his 30-yard kick, which end the game in a 16-16 tie (overtime would not be instituted in college football until 1996). Auburn — which had also tied Tennessee early in the season — ended the year 9-1-2. Syracuse, on the other hand, finished 11-0-1, its outside shot at a national championship dashed by the tie against Auburn (Miami beat Oklahoma 20-14 in the Orange Bowl that same night to finish 12-0 and claim the title). Egged on by a local radio personality, furious Syracuse fans mailed 2,000 neckties to the man they dubbed Pat “Tie” Dye. The Auburn coach — who told reporters that if Syracuse “wanted to win, they should have blocked the field goal” — ended up signing 200 of the ties and selling them for $100 each, raising $20,000 for the school’s general scholarship fund.\n\nYeatman King/Birmingham News file\n\n86. 'Too much Bama in me' (1954)\n\nTommy Lewis was a good enough fullback to have been elected an Alabama team captain and to have scored two touchdowns in the Crimson Tide’s 1953 Orange Bowl victory over Syracuse, but he’s best remembered for a momentary lapse of reason that took place a year later in a different bowl game. In the Jan. 1, 1954, Cotton Bowl vs. Rice, Lewis scored a touchdown to give the Crimson Tide an early lead. In the second quarter, Owls halfback Dicky Moegle — who had already run for a 79-yard touchdown earlier in the game — broke free for what looked like it was going to be a 95-yard score. Inexplicably, Lewis ran off the sideline and dove into Moegle’s legs as he crossed the 50-yard line, knocking him flat on his back. Moegle was awarded a touchdown on the play, one of three he scored in a 28-6 Rice victory. When asked by reporters why he came off the bench to tackle Moegle, Lewis — who was penalized five yards for illegal participation but was not ejected from the game — said “I guess I’ve got too much Bama in me.” Moegle, who was temporarily dazed but not seriously injured on the play, forgave Lewis almost immediately. The two later appeared together on the Ed Sullivan Show, where Lewis repeated the line that would stick with him until his death in 2014.\n\nAuburn athletics photo\n\n85. Auburn ends Georgia’s SEC reign (1983)\n\nGeorgia had won three straight SEC championships, 23 consecutive conference games and 24 home games in a row when the No. 4 Bulldogs welcomed No. 3 Auburn into Sanford Stadium on Nov. 12, 1983. Georgia had tied Clemson early in the season, but otherwise had an unblemished record. Pat Dye’s Tigers were 8-1, a mid-September loss to Texas their only disappointment. Auburn won 13-7 behind a Lionel James touchdown run, two Al Del Greco field goals and a defense that held Georgia to 51 yards rushing, clinching the victory when cornerback Jimmie Warren batted down John Lastinger’s fourth-down pass in the final minute. The victory secured at least a share of Auburn’s first SEC championship since 1957, a title the Tigers would win outright by beating Alabama 23-20 two weeks later in Birmingham. Auburn would finish off an 11-1 season by beating Michigan 9-7 in the Sugar Bowl, ending up No. 3 in the national polls behind national champion Miami and once-beaten Nebraska.\n\nTom Self/Birmingham News file\n\n84. Alabama wins national title after chaotic New Year’s Day (1966)\n\nA lot of things had to break perfectly for Alabama to win a second straight national championship following the 1965 season. The Crimson Tide shook off a one-point loss to Georgia in its opener and a midseason tie vs. Tennessee to carry an 8-1-1 record and a No. 4 national ranking into the Orange Bowl against unbeaten and No. 3 Nebraska. Alabama got some help elsewhere, as LSU beat No. 2 Arkansas 14-7 in the Cotton Bowl and UCLA knocked off No. 1 Michigan State 14-12 in the Rose Bowl. The Crimson Tide then throttled the Cornhuskers 39-28 in the Sugar Bowl, getting 296 yards and two touchdowns passing from Steve Sloan and 203 combined yards rushing from Les Kelley and Steve Bowman in one of the great team offensive performances of the Bryant era (Ray Perkins also caught nine passes for 159 yards and two TDs). When the polls came out a few days later, Alabama was indeed national champion for the third time in five years, garnering 37 first-place votes to 18 for Michigan State.\n\nMike Mercier/Huntsville Times file\n\n83. Stallings steps down following Iron Bowl thriller (1996)\n\nAlabama beat Auburn 24-23 in the Iron Bowl on a 6-yard touchdown pass from Freddie Kitchens to Dennis Riddle with 26 seconds remaining, and that was only the second most-dramatic thing that happened on Nov. 21, 1996, at Legion Field in Birmingham. Moments after the game ended, Alabama coach Gene Stallings announced his resignation effective at season’s end. Stallings cited family reasons for his decision, but over the years, stories have emerged of acrimony between the coach and the school's administration, including athletics director Bob Bockrath and president Andrew Sorensen. Alabama lost to Florida in the SEC championship game, but beat Michigan 17-14 in the Outback Bowl to cap a seven-year run under Stallings that produced 70 victories and the 1992 national championship. Though just 61 at the time, Stallings has never coached again. The Crimson Tide hired Mike DuBose as Stallings replacement, but fired him in 2000 after four uneven seasons.\n\nAP photo by Brynn Anderson\n\n82. Alabama, Auburn engage in offensive shootout (2014)\n\nAfter years of defense-first battles of attrition, the Iron Bowl entered a new age on Nov. 29, 2014 at Tuscaloosa’s Bryant-Denny Stadium. The top-ranked Crimson Tide emerged with a 55-44 victory over the No. 15 Tigers, with the two teams setting game records for total points (99) and combined yardage (1,169). The Tigers led 26-21 at halftime and 33-21 early in the third quarter before Amari Cooper and Blake Sims took over the game. Sims hit Cooper on touchdown passes of 39 and 75 yards, and also ran for an 11-yard score as Alabama stormed ahead early in the fourth quarter. Cooper ended the day with an Iron Bowl record 13 receptions for 224 yards and three touchdowns, more than enough to offset a 456-yard passing day by Auburn’s Nick Marshall. Sammie Coates (5 receptions, 206 yards, 2 TDs) and Duke Williams (7-121) also had big days catching the ball for the Tigers, while the Crimson Tide’s T.J. Yeldon ran for 127 yards and two scores.\n\nEric Schultz/Huntsville Times file\n\n81. Tyrone Prothro’s glory & agony (2005)\n\nTyrone Prothro was like a comet blazing across the sky for Alabama in 2005, shining brightly but briefly during a four-week span early in the season. The 5-foot-9 receiver turned in one of the great individual plays in college football history on Sept. 10 when he reached behind the back of Southern Miss defensive back Jasper Faulk to haul in a 42-yard pass from Brodie Croyle at the 1-yard line, sparking a 30-21 comeback win for the Crimson Tide (the catch won an ESPY for “Play of the Year”). Prothro caught seven passed for 134 yards in the game, and also totaled 133 yards in kick returns. The following week, he ran for 64 yards on just three carries in a 37-14 win at South Carolina. Alabama’s Oct. 1 game against Florida in Tuscaloosa would simultaneously be the best and worst day of Prothro’s football career. He caught five passes for 134 yards and two touchdowns — and also had a punt return for a touchdown called back by penalty — as the Crimson Tide routed the No. 5 Gators 31-3. But with Alabama up big in the fourth quarter, Croyle threw deep to Prothro in the end zone in an attempt for an exclamation point touchdown. Prothro landed awkwardly on his left leg, which collapsed inward as both lower leg bones shattered. Prothro underwent emergency surgery that night and was hospitalized nearly a month due to medical complications. He never played football again.\n\nAP file photo by Dave Martin\n\n80. North Alabama’s threepeat (1993-95)\n\nOnly one football-playing school in the state of Alabama has won three consecutive national championships. Coach Bobby Wallace and North Alabama pulled off the “threepeat” from 1993-95, posting a 41-1 record and winning the NCAA Division II championship all three years. The Lions’ only loss in that span came 17-14 in 1994 to Youngstown State, a team that went on to win the Division I-AA (now FCS) title that season. North Alabama’s signature player during their run was linebacker Ronald McKinnon, a three-time All-American who won the Harlon Hill Trophy (AKA the Division II Heisman) in 1995. McKinnon went on to play nine years in the NFL. North Alabama had some great teams after 2003, but never won another Division II title. The Lions moved up to Division I in 2018, and currently play as an FCS independent.\n\nFrank Couch/Birmingham News file\n\n79. Alabama’s Antonio Langham scandal (1993)\n\nAntonio Langham was one of the signature players of Alabama’s 1992 national championship team, a first-team All-America cornerback whose interception return for a touchdown provided the winning margin in the SEC championship game against Florida. Langham was again a star for the Crimson Tide in 1993, setting the school record for interceptions at midseason. However, he was declared ineligible during the week of the SEC title game when it came to light he’d received money to sign with an agent in the hours after the previous season’s Sugar Bowl. After the NCAA found that head coach Gene Stallings and athletics director Hootie Ingram were slow to act in reporting Langham’s violations, the Crimson Tide was hit with NCAA sanctions for the first time in school history in 1995. Alabama was forced to forfeit eight victories in which Langham played in 1993, was stripped of a number of scholarships and was banned from postseason play in 1995.\n\nBirmingham News file\n\n78. Auburn’s Eric Ramsey scandal (1991-92)\n\nThe most successful sustained period in Auburn football history was undone in part by a “pay for play” scandal that broke early in the 1991 season. In June of that year, former Tigers defensive back Eric Ramsey alleged in a term paper that was made public that Auburn’s football program was “racist and condescending” to African-American players. That September, Ramsey unloaded another bombshell, that he’d been paid by boosters under an elaborate incentive program, and that he had secretly recorded meetings with assistant coaches Larry Blakeney, Steve Dennis and Frank Young in which the scheme — which involved two Auburn boosters funneling money to players through the football staff — was openly discussed. The Birmingham News printed a transcript of several of the tapes in November, on one of which Blakeney can be heard telling Ramsey to keep the arrangement quiet, uttering the infamous phrase “keep it down home, cuz.” The NCAA’s Letter of Inquiry arrived in November 1992, charging the football program with nine violations. Head coach Pat Dye — who had also been the Tigers’ athletic director during the time the violations occurred — resigned a few weeks later on the eve of the Iron Bowl. The following August, Auburn was hit with a two-year bowl ban, a TV ban for 1993 and the loss of 13 scholarships over a four-year period.\n\nJohn David Mercer/Press-Register file\n\n77. The Frozen Iron Bowl (2000)\n\nOnce the Iron Bowl moved to Auburn in 1989, it was only a matter of time before the game was played in Tuscaloosa as well. Alabama’s contract with the city of Birmingham finally expired after the 1999 season, clearing the way for the Iron Bowl to be played at Bryant-Denny Stadium the following year and on the Alabama campus for the first time since 1901. Unfortunately for Crimson Tide fans, their team was in the midst of a 3-8 season and head coach Mike DuBose had already been fired by the time the Iron Bowl rolled around. Doubly unfortunate, the game was played in some of the most miserable conditions in the history of the rivalry — temperatures in the high 30s and freezing rain throughout the afternoon. The only scoring of the game came on three Damon Duval field goals, as Tommy Tuberville's Tigers took a 9-0 victory, clinching the SEC West championship in the process. Alabama hired Dennis Franchione a short time afterward, but wouldn’t beat Auburn in Tuscaloosa until Nick Saban showed up later in the decade.\n\nBirmingham News file\n\n76. Philip Doyle kicks it to Tennessee (1990)\n\nOne of the more unlikely outcomes in the “Third Saturday in October” rivalry came on Oct. 20, 1990, at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville. Alabama came into the game at 2-3, having lost the first three games of the season amid a pile of injuries under first-year head coach Gene Stallings. Tennessee was 4-0-2 and ranked No. 3 nationally. Not many gave Alabama a chance, with ESPN’s Lee Corso saying earlier in the week that the Crimson Tide was a glorified high school team compared to Tennessee. Alabama had won four straight over Tennessee at that point, leading All-SEC center Roger Shultz to utter the famous line “We ought to pay property tax on Neyland Stadium because we own it.\" Nevertheless, Tennessee appeared to be on the verge of victory, lining up for a 50-yard field goal with 1:35 to play and the score tied 6-6. Alabama’s Stacy Harrison blocked Greg Burke’s attempt, and the ball rolled so far that the Crimson Tide was virtually in field goal range. Moments later, Philip Doyle hammered a 47-yard game-winner for a 9-6 Alabama victory. The Crimson Tide’s streak over the Volunteers eventually reached seven straight victories before a 17-17 tie in 1993. Tennessee started a seven-game win streak of its own in 1995.\n\nTom Self/Birmingham News file\n\n75. Lawyer Tillman reverses Auburn’s Iron Bowl fortunes (1986)\n\nAuburn had lost back-to-back heartbreaking Iron Bowls and looked to be on the verge of a third in 1986, when the Tigers trailed Alabama by 10 points entering the fourth quarter on Nov. 29 at Legion Field. Auburn scored on the first play of the final period to cut Alabama’s lead to four, then took over at its 23 with 4:54 to play. The Tigers marched 77 yards for the winning touchdown, a drive that included a 9-yard pass from Jeff Burger to Trey Gainous on fourth-and-3. Auburn reached the Alabama 7-yard line, and called a reverse to Scott Bolton. The only trouble was that Bolton wasn’t on the field, back-up Lawyer Tillman was. Tillman had never repped the play in practice, but ran it to perfection, diving into the end zone to cap a 21-17 Auburn victory. The win — which also included 145 yards and two touchdowns rushing from Brent Fullwood — would be the first of four straight by Pat Dye’s Tigers over Alabama. The Tigers went on face USC in the Citrus Bowl, winning 16-7 to finish 10-2. Alabama ended up 10-3 after beating Washington in the Sun Bowl. A few days later, Crimson Tide head coach Ray Perkins left for the NFL.\n\nBirmingham News file\n\n74. Namath denied at Orange Bowl goal line (1965)\n\nAlabama has already been crowned national champion by the Associated Press at the end of the 1964 regular season, but had a chance to cap a perfect year when it faced No. 5 Texas in the first prime-time Orange Bowl on New Year’s Day. Steve Sloan started the game at quarterback with Joe Namath nursing a knee injury, but Namath limped onto the field after the Longhorns took a 14-0 lead early in the second quarter. Namath immediately led a touchdown drive, and pulled the Crimson Tide within 21-17 late in the game. Alabama drove all the way to the Texas 1-yard line, but Namath was stuffed short of the goal line on fourth down by Longhorns All-American Tommy Nobis (or at least that’s how officials ruled it; Namath and numerous teammates have been adamant over the years that Namath scored). Despite playing for the losing side, Namath was named the game’s Most Valuable Player after completing 18 of 37 passes for 255 yards and two touchdowns. The following day, Namath agreed with the American Football League’s New York Jets on a then-record $400,000 signing bonus.\n\nAP file photo\n\n73. Oliver pulls a stunner and heads to Auburn (1995)\n\nBill Oliver was considered the heir apparent to Gene Stallings as Alabama head coach by 1995, but any chance of that disappeared suddenly when Oliver jumped across the state to become defensive coordinator at Auburn shortly after the season ended. Oliver believed he’d been promised the Alabama job when and if Stallings stepped down, but any such arrangement was voided after athletics director Hootie Ingram resigned the previous summer amid NCAA sanctions. His relationship with Stallings having soured despite teaming up for the 1992 national championship, Oliver had filed retirement paperwork with the state of Alabama. Auburn coach Terry Bowden, who had fired defensive coordinator Wayne Hall at season’s end, quickly pursued the architect of Alabama’s legendary 1992 defense. Oliver — whose first job in coaching had been at Auburn under Shug Jordan in the late 1960s — signed on shortly after the new year. Stallings was apparently caught off guard by the move, but promoted Mike DuBose to defensive coordinator. Oliver was in his third year as Auburn’s defensive coordinator when Bowden resigned in the middle of the 1998 season, and finished that year as interim coach. Oliver retired when he was passed over for the permanent job in favor of Tommy Tuberville, and has not coached again since.\n\nJohn Horgan Jr./Wikimedia Commons\n\n72. The first Alabama-Auburn game (1893)\n\nIt wasn’t yet known as the Iron Bowl and it didn’t even take place in the fall, but Alabama and Auburn met for the first time in football on Feb. 22, 1893, at Birmingham’s Lakeview Park. Auburn had formed its team in 1892 under history professor George Petrie, the same year Livingston native W.G. Little had organized the first Alabama squad. In what the Montgomery Advertiser billed as “Auburn vs. Tuskaloosa” in the “Great Football Game at Birmingham,” Auburn won 32-22. Because the game was played in February, Auburn considered it the first game of the 1893 season, while Alabama considered it the 1892 finale. Thus began years of gridiron disagreement between the two schools. The game was moved to the fall in 1893, then stopped after 1895 before resuming in 1900 and being played every year through 1907. The rivalry was then called off for 41 years before being resumed at Birmingham’s Legion Field in 1948, and has been played every year since, nearly always in the regular-season finale.\n\nBirmingham News file\n\n71. Auburn makes a bold hire in Pat Dye (1981)\n\nAfter eight straight losses in the Iron Bowl, Auburn turned to a man who had been groomed by its two most hated rivals to turn the program around. Pat Dye, an All-America lineman at Georgia and a long-time assistant at Alabama, was hired as Tigers head man in 1981. Dye — 41 years old at the time — had been a head coach at East Carolina for six seasons and at Wyoming for one, finishing with a winning record every year. The plainspoken country boy from Blythe, Ga., proved to be a perfect fit at Auburn, and enjoyed one of the greatest periods of sustained success in the program’s history over the next decade. Dye broke Alabama’s 9-game Iron Bowl winning streak in 1982 — beating mentor Bear Bryant in his final regular season game — and later won four straight against the Crimson Tide. He won or shared in four SEC championships, and narrowly missed out on a shot at a national title in both 1983 and 1988. Most importantly, he put the Tigers on equal footing with the Crimson Tide, both in terms of recruiting and on the field. An NCAA scandal and failing health prematurely ended his Auburn tenure after the 1992 season, but Dye remains synonymous with the Tigers, who named the playing surface at Jordan-Hare Stadium in his honor in 2005.\n\nAlabama athletics\n\n70. Alabama’s first game (1892)\n\nSome 23 years after the first college football game was contested between Princeton and Rutgers, the University of Alabama got into the act on Nov. 11, 1892. The Cadets — as Alabama’s teams were then known — routed a team comprised of players from various Birmingham high schools 56-0 at Lakeview Park. William Little of Livingston — who attended prep school in New Hampshire — brought the game back south when he enrolled at Alabama in 1892. Little was appointed the team’s first captain, with E.B. Beaumont serving as head coach. Little also scored on a 30-yard run in the win over the high school team, which served as a warm-up for a game the following day against the Birmingham Athletic Club. The Cadets lost that game 5-4, but beat the Athletic Club 14-0 in December before finishing the “season” with a 32-22 loss to Auburn the following February.\n\nAuburn athletics\n\n69. Auburn’s first game (1892)\n\nAuburn also played football for the first time in 1892, but its inaugural game was a doozy. Auburn — then known as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama — opened its first season by beating Georgia 10-0 on a rainy February day at Piedmont Park in Atlanta. As the Atlanta Constitution put it, the Auburn students “stormed Georgia’s capital with their mercy yells, songs, jokes and extravagant jollity.” Presumably, a football game also took place. The game was the brainchild of Auburn’s George Petrie and Georgia’s Charles Herty, who met as graduate school classmates at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. It was told for many years that Auburn’s “War Eagle” cheer originated during this game, but that tale has since proven to be apocryphal.\n\nHal Yeager/Birmingham News file\n\n68. The Kick II/Third & Dumb (1997)\n\nHow you refer to the 1997 Iron Bowl depends upon which side your allegiances lie. For Auburn fans, it’s “The Kick II,” after Jaret Holmes’ 39-yard field goal with 15 seconds left, which gave the Tigers an 18-17 victory (Van Tiffin’s Iron Bowl game-winner in 1985 was “The Kick.”) For Alabama fans, it’s “Third & Dumb,” after the preposterous play call that set up Holmes’ game-winner. The Crimson Tide, which entered the game 4-6 and was already going to miss out on a postseason bowl, led 17-15 and was trying to run out the clock in the final minute. Rather than call a “safe” running play, Alabama offensive coordinator Bruce Arians called for a swing pass from Freddie Kitchens to Ed Scissum, who fumbled after a hard hit by Auburn’s Martavious Houston. The Tigers’ Quinton Reese recovered on the Alabama 33 with 48 seconds left. Auburn then got one first down to set up Holmes’ kick for the win. First-year Alabama head coach Mike DuBose said he didn’t know what the play call was on Scissum’s fumble, because he wasn’t wearing a headset on the sideline. Auburn clinched its first SEC West title with the win, and fans tore down the goal posts at Jordan-Hare Stadium.\n\nRoss D. Franklin/Associated Press\n\n67. Cam cleared by NCAA (2010)\n\nAuburn’s 2010 national championship run became engulfed in controversy late in the regular season, with star quarterback Cam Newton at the center of it all. Newton, who originally played at Florida before spending a year in junior college, signed with Auburn after also being vigorously pursued by Mississippi State (just how vigorously was the cause of all the consternation). In early November, news broke that the NCAA had been looking into Newton’s recruitment by the Bulldogs. A former MSU player alleged that Cecil Newton, Cam’s father, had solicited $120,000 to $180,000 in exchange for his son to sign with the Bulldogs. Auburn briefly declared Cam Newton ineligible during the week of the SEC championship game in early December, but the NCAA immediately reinstated him after no evidence was found of a financial arrangement between the Tigers and the Newtons. Within the next month, the younger Newton quarterbacked the Tigers to the SEC championship, won the Heisman Trophy and then led Auburn to its first national title in more than 50 years. Though “pay-for-play” suspicions continue to sully Newton’s Auburn career in some observers' minds, the NCAA closed its investigation into the matter the following October.\n\nDavid J. Phillip/Associated Press\n\n66. Franchione drops rope, heads for Texas A&M (2002)\n\nDennis Franchione was hired as Alabama’s coach under an NCAA cloud, the sanctions from the Albert Means scandal delivering a massive blow to the program a year into his tenure (rendering the Tide ineligible for the postseason in both 2002 and 2003). Franchione implored his Crimson Tide players to “hold the rope,” that is, stick together until the team emerged on the other side. A few days after Alabama ended its 2002 season with a loss at Hawaii, Franchione let go of the rope. He left Alabama for Texas A&M, a move the seemed unconscionable just a few years earlier. Worse, Franchione never returned to Tuscaloosa after accepting the job with the Aggies, telling his players he was leaving via videoconference. It was a move viewed as cowardly by Alabama fans, who never forgave Franchione — particularly after his replacement, Mike Price, was fired a few months later for off-field transgressions. Alabama fans got the last laugh on “Coach Fran,” who went 32-28 and never won a bowl game in five seasons with the Aggies (who were then in the Big 12) before resigning with a year left on his contract.\n\nJohn Bazemore/Associated Press\n\n65. Alabama blacks out Georgia's Blackout (2008)\n\nNick Saban’s Alabama program announced its presence with authority in the fifth game of the 2008 season, throttling Georgia 41-30 in Athens. The third-ranked Bulldogs were so confident entering the game that they decided to wear black jerseys, encouraging fans to also wear that color and “Blackout” Sanford Stadium. Alabama strength coach Scott Cochran, then not yet a Tuscaloosa folk hero, had been caught on camera having a little fun with the blackout concept earlier in the week (he told Crimson Tide players that Georgia was going to wear black because “they’re going to a [expletive] funeral\"). The Crimson Tide entered the game 4-0 and ranked No. 8, with double-digit wins over Clemson, Tulane, Western Kentucky and Arkansas to start the season. Still, college football pundits didn’t know what to make of the Alabama program, which had produced many “Bama is Back” false starts over the years. That narrative changed in less than two quarters against Georgia, as the Crimson Tide built at 31-0 halftime lead and cruised to a statement victory in what was eventually an unbeaten regular season. \"The bottom line,\" Georgia coach Mark Richt said after the game, \"is they whipped us.\"\n\nKelly Kline/Heisman Trust via AP\n\n64. Derrick Henry handles the Heisman (2015)\n\nWith spread offenses and hurry-up, no-huddle attacks proliferating across college football in 2015, old-school, three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust philosophy had perhaps its last gasp in the person of Derrick Henry. The Alabama junior bludgeoned his way to the second Heisman Trophy in program history, rolling up an SEC record 2,219 yards and 28 touchdowns for the eventual national champions. Beginning with a mid-October game against Texas A&M, Henry rushed for 236, 143, 210, 204, 271 and 189 yards against SEC opponents, including games of 38, 46 and 44 carries. Henry 46-carry, 271-yard performance in a 29-13 Iron Bowl victory over Auburn cemented his workhorse status, as he ran the ball 19 times in the fourth quarter and on 14 straight snaps to end the game. Henry was nowhere to be found on preseason Heisman projections, but secured 378 first-place votes to beat out Christian McCaffrey, Deshaun Watson, Baker Mayfield and Leonard Fournette — among others — for college football’s top individual honor. Henry left school for the NFL after helping Alabama past Clemson in the national title game, and was a second-round pick by the Tennessee Titans.\n\nBob Farley/Birmingham Post-Herald file\n\n63. Dye resigns on Iron Bowl eve (1992)\n\nPat Dye led Auburn to six Iron Bowl victories and four SEC championships in the 1980s, but pending NCAA sanctions and failing health had taken their toll by the end of the 1992 season. With the Tigers in the midst of a second-straight losing season and a day away from facing unbeaten Alabama in the Iron Bowl, Dye resigned on the eve of the Iron Bowl at Legion Field. His team played inspired football for nearly a half, before Alabama’s Antonio Langham broke the game open with an interception return for a touchdown and the Crimson Tide went on to win 17-0. Dye finished his 12-year Auburn tenure with 99 victories and a 6-6 record in the Iron Bowl, and was only 53 years old at the time. The Tigers were hit with major NCAA sanctions the following summer, keeping them out of the postseason in both 1993 and 1994. Though Dye has remained close to the Auburn program since stepping down (too close, some would argue), he has never coached again.\n\nChip English/Press-Register file\n\n62. Honk if you sacked Brodie (2005)\n\nOn the day Auburn renamed the playing surface at Jordan-Hare Stadium in honor of former coach Pat Dye, the Tigers turned in a defensive performance that warmed the heart of the old school coach and thousands of their fans. Auburn sacked Alabama quarterback Brodie Croyle 11 times — including on two of the first three plays of the game and five of the first 12 — on the way to a 28-18 victory that was not as close as the final score indicated. Alabama, which had begun the season 9-0 before an overtime loss to LSU, suddenly found itself no better than third in the SEC West. Auburn won its fourth straight Iron Bowl — a streak that would eventually reach six in a row — and exerted the kind of dominance over its instate rival that has existed only sporadically in Iron Bowl history. The Tigers ended the season 9-3 with a loss to Wisconsin in the Capital One Bowl, but showed up to play in the game that mattered most to their fans.\n\nRobert Adams/Birmingham News file\n\n61. Namath runs afoul of 'training' rules (1963)\n\nJoe Namath’s reputation for enjoying the nightlife isn’t something that began once he joined the New York Jets in 1965. Indeed, “Broadway” Joe’s college career was very nearly derailed thanks to an alcohol related incident that occurred in early December 1963, Namath’s junior year at Alabama. Namath was picked up by police in downtown Tuscaloosa for standing in the street directing traffic while under the influence, and immediately suspended by coach Paul “Bear” Bryant for “breaking training” (though reports at the time did not specify his infraction). Namath sat out the season-ending game at Miami (which had been re-scheduled from Nov. 23 due to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the previous day) and the Jan. 1 Sugar Bowl vs. Ole Miss, both Crimson Tide victories. Jack Hurlbut and Steve Sloan filled in for Namath at quarterback, as Sloan would do again when Namath injured his knee in 1964. Bryant let Namath back on the team for his senior year, and he responded by leading Alabama to a national championship, despite playing half the season on a bum knee.\n\nBirmingham News file photo\n\n60. Shug Jordan hired at Auburn (1951)\n\nJordan, who grew up in Selma, was a four-sport letterman at Auburn, and became the school’s head basketball coach and assistant football coach after graduating in 1933. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, receiving a Purple Heart for wounds received in the Normandy Invasion. After one post-war season at Auburn, he was hired as basketball coach and line coach at Georgia. He returned to his alma mater as head coach in 1951, taking over an Auburn program that had gone 3-22-4 the previous three seasons. After two mediocre years, the Tigers broke through with a 7-3-1 record and a Gator Bowl berth in 1953. Four years later, Auburn went 10-0 and claimed the school’s first national championship. That was Jordan’s lone SEC title team as well, though he had a number of very good teams in the 1960s and 70s as well. Auburn’s Cliff Hare Stadium was renamed Jordan-Hare Stadium in 1973, and Jordan retired following the 1975 season with 175 career wins.\n\nRobert Adams/Birmingham News file\n\n59. Alabama’s defensive dominance (1961)\n\nPaul “Bear” Bryant’s first national championship team did it with defense, allowing an astounding 25 points in 11 games on the way to a perfect record. Led by stars such as Lee Roy Jordan, Billy Neighbors and Darwin Holt, the Crimson Tide pitched six shutouts, holding opponents scoreless in the final five games of the regular season. In fact, Alabama’s first-team defense allowed just 13 points all season — field goals by Tennessee and Arkansas, and a touchdown by N.C. State. “Many times, we only played one quarter, maybe two quarters, maybe three quarters,” end Tommy Brooker remembered in 2018. “And then we went and sat on the bench.” Alabama was voted No. 1 at the end of the regular season, and then capped an 11-0 campaign with a 10-3 victory over Arkansas in the Sugar Bowl. It would be the first of six national championships won by Bryant teams in the next 19 years, a record unmatched until Nick Saban won six in 15 years at LSU and Alabama from 2003-17.\n\nTodd Warshaw/AllSport\n\n58. Terry Bowden resigns at midseason (1998)\n\nThe only midseason coaching change in the modern history of the Iron Bowl rivalry took place in 1998, when Auburn’s Terry Bowden stepped down after the Tigers got off to a 1-5 start. Bowden said he’d been told by Auburn trustee Bobby Lowder that he was going to be fired at season’s end, though Lowder denied that was the case. Defensive coordinator Bill Oliver stepped in as interim coach, guiding the Tigers to a 3-8 finish. Bowden’s tenure at Auburn ended with a 47-17-1 record, including 20 straight wins at the beginning while the school was under NCAA sanctions from the Pat Dye era. The Tigers also won the SEC West championship in 1997, and beat Alabama in three of Bowden’s five full seasons. Bowden moved into TV, serving as an analyst for ABC Sports. He returned to coaching at North Alabama in 2009, and also worked at Akron from 2012-18 (he is currently on staff as an analyst at Clemson). Auburn hired Tommy Tuberville to take over beginning in 1999.\n\nPhoto courtesy of the Paul W. Bryant Museum\n\n57. Pat Trammell dies at 28 (1968)\n\nOne of the more beloved figures in Alabama football history met his untimely demise in December of 1968, when former Crimson Tide quarterback Pat Trammell died after battling testicular cancer. Trammell, the starting quarterback on Alabama’s 1961 national championship team, was noted for his tough-minded play and was remembered as Paul “Bear” Bryant’s favorite player. He eschewed a chance at pro football to go to medical school, and was in his third year of dermatology residency when he fell ill. He left a wife and two young children behind, which spurred Bryant and Trammell’s former teammates to form the A-Club Charitable and Educational Foundation, a group that still provides funds for the families of former Crimson Tide players and others in need. Trammell was posthumously inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1975. The stadium at Scottsboro High School, his alma mater, is named in his honor.\n\nRobert Adams/Birmingham News file\n\n56. Shug Jordan dies at 69 (1980)\n\nLegendary coach Ralph “Shug” Jordan had been away from Auburn for nearly five years when he died from leukemia on July 17, 1980 at age 69, but his passing left an indelible mark on those around him. A war hero and a fine athlete in his day, Jordan won 175 games and a national title in 25 years at Auburn. The school re-named its football "
