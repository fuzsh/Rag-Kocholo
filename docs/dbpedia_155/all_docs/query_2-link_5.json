        "text": "Terry Bowden was fired as the head football coach at Louisiana-Monroe on Sunday, it was announced by athletics director John Hartwell. The Warhawks were 10-26 (.277) overall in three seasons under Bowden, including 5-19 (.208) against Sun Belt opponents. Louisiana-Monroe lost 10-consecutive games to close out the 2023 season. It is the fifth-lowest winning percentage (.167) for the program since it joined the FBS level in 1975.\n\n\"After a thorough review, we have decided to make a change in the leadership of ULM football,\" Hartwell said in a release. \"I want to thank coach Terry Bowden for all he has done over the last three years for our football program and our university.\"\n\nBowden, 67, is a longtime college football coach and son of the late former Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden. He is also the brother of former Clemson head coach Tommy Bowden and former Florida State offensive coordinator Jeff Bowden.\n\nLouisiana-Monroe suffered a 52-21 loss to rival Louisiana Saturday in the season finale. The Warhawks were out-gained 476 to 239 in total yards.\n\n\"It just slipped away from us,\" Bowden said postgame. \"Our guys have fought so hard and that one looks like it just slipped away from us. It's one of those years where you played your heart out and it didn't happen this year.\"\n\nLouisiana-Monroe ranks 128th in scoring offense (17.3) and 123rd in scoring defense (34.9) this season. The Warhawks were out-scored by an average of 22.5 points during the 10-game losing streak.\n\nTerry Bowden has nearly 30 years of head coaching experience at various levels of college football. He was the head coach at Auburn from 1993-98 and he recorded a 47-17-1 overall record with the Tigers. Bowden resigned from his position amid a 1-5 start to the 1998 season.\n\nBowden spent three seasons as the head coach at NCAA Division II North Alabama from 2009-2011, leading the Lions to three playoff appearances. North Alabama posted a 29-9 (.763) overall record. He returned to the FBS ranks as the head coach at Akron from 2012-18, leading the Zips to two bowl game appearances and a MAC East division title in 2017.\n\nBowden also served as the head coach at NAIA Salem in West Virginia (1983-85) and NCAA Division III Samford (1987-1992).\n\nBowden has an overall career record of 185-140-2 as a head coach.\n\nGet football and recruiting scoop on your favorite college team for $1 for first month.\n\nHartwell said a national search for the next head coach at Louisiana-Monroe has started. A press conference will be held Monday to discuss the change in leadership for the Warhawks."
