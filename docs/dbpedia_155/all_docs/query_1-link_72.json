        "text": "— The second time around wasn’t much better than the first for the Arkansas Tech Wonder Boys.\n\nNo. 5 North Alabama overpowered the Wonder Boys 41-28 on Saturday before 6,432 at Braly Municipal Stadium, knocking No. 21 Arkansas Tech out of the NCAA Division II playoffs in the second round.\n\nThe game was a rematch of an Oct. 3 game between the Gulf South Conference teams.The Lions (11-1) rolled at home in that one, too, winning 42-17.\n\nNorth Alabama was almost as dominant as it was in the first meeting, piling up 480 yards of total offense, including 341 yards passing and four touchdowns from senior quarterback Harrison Beck.\n\nThe Lions contained Gulf South Conference Offensive Player of the Year Nick Graziano for two quarters, limiting the senior quarterback to 85 yards passing in the first half. Graziano, a finalist for the Harlon Hill Trophy given to Division II’s top player, found his footing in the second half, and ended the day with 432 yards passing and 63 passes.\n\nBut it didn’t translate into enough points.\n\n“North Alabama could create turnovers,” Arkansas Tech Coach Steve Mullins said, referencing the Lions’ two interceptions and one fumble recovery. “We had to not give them so many possessions.”\n\nBoth teams traded touchdowns on their opening possessions, and the Wonder Boys (9-3) tied the game 14-14 early in the second quarter when Graziano threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Landon Turner.\n\nBut North Alabama took a 24-14 lead to halftime after the Lions recovered a fumble by Arkansas Tech running back Tim Childress and converted it into a 36-yard Kenny Spencer field goal in the final 20 seconds.\n\nBoth teams entered Saturday ranked in the top 10 nationally in pass offense, but have struggled to run the ball all season. Yet the Lions had 36 rushes Saturday for 139 yards.\n\n“In our week off, we added a little to our offense,” first year North Alabama Coach Terry Bowden said. “We took our short-yardage offense, with two tight ends, and took the backside tight end spot and used a wide receiver.When we had the numbers, we could run the ball.”\n\nOne of the Lions’ best defensive moments came after the opening kickoff of the second half, when Arkansas Tech was held to a three-and-out. North Alabama turned that opportunity into points on its first possession, with Beck throwing a 21-yard touchdown pass to Preston Parker.\n\nThe Wonder Boys were playing uphill from then on.The Lions outscored Arkansas Tech 17-0 in the third quarter, and didn’t allow a score until Graziano connected with Rolaundo Wright for a 16-yard touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter.\n\n“It changed the momentum,” Mullins said of North Alabama’s half-opening touchdown.\n\nArkansas Tech’s season ends with Graziano turning in one of the best seasons for a quarterback in state college football history. Going into Saturday, Graziano’s 35 touchdown passes led the state’s football-playing schools, as did his 4,300 yards of total offense.\n\nWith Saturday’s game, Arkansas Tech moved ahead of the 2001 Central Arkansas Bears for the most passing yards in a season in state college football history.\n\n“I’ve been in a good Wishbone offense where we led the nation in rushing,” Mullins said. “It wasn’t near as exciting as what the offense has been this year. As time goes, and you get the time to reflect, those things are going to be very special. Right now, it’s the burn of the last game of the season ending in a loss.”"
