        "text": "Alabama has added another analyst to its off-field staff.\n\nFormer Akron offensive coordinator A.J. Milwee has been hired as an offensive analyst, BamaOnLine has learned. AL.com’s Matt Zenitz first reported the addition.\n\nMilwee spent seven seasons on the Akron staff. Promoted to offensive coordinator in December 2012, he was the second-youngest coordinator (30) in the FBS at the time of his promotion. The Boaz, Ala., native also mentored Akron’s quarterbacks.\n\nMilwee came to Akron after one year on staff at East Mississippi Community College, helping the program to an NJCAA national championship. He spent the 2009 and 2010 seasons on Terry Bowden’s staff at North Alabama as a graduate assistant.\n\nCompiling a 33-5 mark as UNA’s quarterback during the 2006-08 seasons, Milwee set all-time school records for career passing yards (8,436), pass completions (677), passing attempts (1,030), touchdown passes (73) and total offense yards (9,401). At UNA, he was a two-time finalist for the Harlon Hill Trophy, awarded annually to the nation’s top player at the NCAA Division-II level.\n\nMilwee spent his freshman year of eligibility as a member of the Alabama football team. He holds an undergraduate degree in finance from North Alabama.\n\nMilwee is the latest former coordinator to join the Crimson Tide football program as an analyst. This offseason, Alabama has also reportedly hired former UA offensive coordinator and Houston head coach Major Applewhite and former Oklahoma defensive coordinator Mike Stoops.\n\n*** BOL staff members Travis Reier and Charlie Potter contributed to this report."
