        "text": "Jimbo Fisher is mixing old school with new methods of coaching a football team as he prepares for his first season as Florida State football coach.\n\nAnd while he is open to new ideas (sports psychologists, nutritionists and motivational speakers have been as much a part of the program since he took over Jan. 2 as mat drills and weightlifting), Fisher said he will embrace what's important about the 34-year legacy left by Bobby Bowden.\n\nThat falls under what Fisher likes to categorize as \"core values\" - hard work, strong faith and a willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of the team.\n\nAnd as long as those time-tested values remain in place, Fisher said all that is good about Florida State's tradition will continue.\n\n\"The core values of what we truly believe haven't changed,\" he said a few days after the Seminoles opened their preseason workouts. \"Prepare what you think is right, do what you think is right and be respectful of tradition, but when core values don't change, tradition doesn't change.\"\n\nFisher said he came to Florida State as an assistant coach in 2007 to learn about those values from Bowden. But in many ways, he's his own man, with alternative theories and practices to help the Seminoles extricate themselves from a prolonged period of too many 7-6 seasons and too many losses to in-state rivals Florida and Miami.\n\nAnd he said Bowden has been the first one to tell Fisher to do it his way. The two have communicated since Bowden's retirement but not enough to give the appearance that Bowden is looking over Fisher's shoulder - which happened to Bowden's son and Fisher's former coach and boss Terry Bowden when he took over for Pat Dye at Auburn.\n\n\"Coach Dye was always around, which made it hard on Terry,\" Fisher said. \"For that reason, coach Bowden said we wouldn't see him around here for about three years. He's told me, 'If you need me, call me. But it's your program.' \"\n\nFisher's program. Bowden's legacy. How much will that be a constant battle within and outside the program?\n\nFisher has the answer.\n\n\"All the guys who were great and successful did it their way,\" said the fast-talking, high-energy native of Clarksburg, W.Va., who labored 19 years as an assistant at four programs before being named FSU's coach-in-waiting in 2007. \"They did, 15, 30, 50 years ago, what was right for that time. I'm doing what I believe is right for this time. If I don't do what I think is right, it cheats the players.\"\n\nFisher also is mindful of the fate that has befallen many men who inherited a winning program from a revered coach. But Fisher's done his homework in that regard. If someone says, \"Ray Goff,\" Fisher might respond, \"John Robinson.\" If someone else says, \"Ray Perkins,\" Fisher could come back with \"Phil Fulmer.\"\n\nFor every example of a replacement for a legend who buckled under that pressure or was run off by boosters living in the past, Fisher will come up with coaches such as Robinson (who replaced John McKay at Southern California) and Fulmer (who took over for Johnny Majors at Tennessee), who trumped their predecessors by winning national championships.\n\nOr he might mention the man for whom he played quarterback at Salem College, then was given his first coaching job. Terry Bowden went 11-0 at Auburn the year after taking over for Dye.\n\n\"Sometimes, [the replacements] had success,\" Fisher said.\n\nFisher's transition also has been eased by the fact that the job was his the day he signed in 2007 under the coach-in-waiting concept. Players don't have to get used to Fisher because he's been there since most of them signed their letters of intent.\n\nRelated: Florida State defense fights out of corner\n\n\"There are a lot of similarities, but coach Fisher brings a new kind of energy,\" said senior cornerback Ochuko Jenije. \"He's younger, so there's a different energy and mentality. Coach Fisher looks up to coach Bowden and uses a lot of what he did. But there are a lot of different approaches he's taking.\"\n\nWhat kind of replacement coach Fisher becomes will be revealed soon enough. But he's already put his own stamp on the program.\n\nFisher has arranged for a steady stream of experts to work with players on the mental side of athletic competition, such as building confidence, how to rally from adversity, how to block out distractions and how, as he put it, \"focus on what they can control.\"\n\n\"They've got to learn how to train their mind,\" he said. \"Golfers do it. All the pro [NFL] teams do it.\"\n\n\"The stuff really works,\" said quarterback Christian Ponder, who said one tool is to simply repeat phrases such as \"calm, cool and collected\" over and over to help him put an interception behind him. \"It's helped me and I'm sure it's helped a lot of guys on this team.\"\n\nHe's emphasizing nutrition more than the Bowden regime, and each player has his own unique menu.\n\nRelated: College Football 2010: ACC team previews\n\n\"You're either on weight loss, weight gain or weight maintain,\" said center Ryan McMahon. \"For me, it was more fruit and vegetables than I used to eat. I can tell it's doing good. My body feels better, it recovers faster and I'm not as sore the next day.\"\n\nFisher said his players are like high-powered cars.\n\n\"If you don't put the right oil and gas in there and take of the engine, it won't work,\" he said.\n\nFisher also hasn't hesitated to tread a bit on the Bowden legend. Before the Gator Bowl last season, he joked that the tower overlooking the practice field that Bowden used to perch himself every day, \"might make a good deer stand.\" Players also saw the stern side of Fisher following the final practice before the spring game when he lashed out at them and said they were still \"accepting mediocrity.\"\n\n\"They've come a long way from an attitude perspective,\" Fisher said of the time between that day and the beginning of preseason practice. \"We're not interested in being average. We have to prepare every day not to be average. We're all creatures of habit and when pressure comes, habits come to the surface.\"\n\nWhile Fisher said he won't shirk from being judged in comparison to Bowden, he also said such comparisons really won't matter.\n\n\"It's not about me and it's not about coach Bowden,\" he said. \"It's about the players, their window, their four years.\"\n\nRegardless, the window on the first year of the Fisher Era will open Sept. 4 at Doak Campbell Stadium against Samford. And history shows that window sometimes closes quickly for coaches who follow the legend.\n\ngarry.smits@jacksonville.com,"
