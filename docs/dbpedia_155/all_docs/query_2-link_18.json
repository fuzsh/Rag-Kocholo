        "text": "Game 7: ULM (2-4 overall, 0-3 Sun Belt Conference) at Georgia Southern (4-2 overall, 1-1 Sun Belt Conference)\n\nSaturday, Oct. 21 | 2:02 p.m. ET/1:02 p.m. CT\n\nPaulson Stadium (25,000) | Statesboro, Georgia\n\nESPN+ | KLIP 105.3 FM\n\n2023 ULM Football Notes: Game 7 at Georgia Southern\n\nTerry Bowden Weekly Press Conference: Game 7 Preview at Georgia Southern\n\nFIRST-AND-10 –\n\n• After suffering its second one-point loss of the season, ULM plays the second game of a two-game road swing at 2 p.m. EDT/1 p.m. CDT Saturday against Georgia Southern at Allen E. Paulson Stadium in Statesboro. The Warhawks are coming off a 21-20 loss at Texas State last Saturday, after leading 20-9 with 8:57 remaining. The Eagles dropped their first Sun Belt Conference contest of the season at James Madison, 41-13, last Saturday. Saturday's game is Georgia Southern's homecoming contest.\n\n• Saturday's game marks the 11th meeting between ULM and Georgia Southern, with the Eagles having a 6-3 series lead (7-3 on-the-field record; 2014 win vacated), including a 4-0 record (5-0 on-the-field record; 2014 win vacated) at Paulson Stadium. It is ULM's first visit to Paulson Stadium since Nov. 16, 2019, a 51-29 victory for the Eagles. Georgia Southern won the last meeting between the two teams, 35-30, on Oct. 3, 2020, at Malone Stadium.\n\n• It's been 23 years since ULM head football coach Terry Bowden coached a game against Georgia Southern or visited Statesboro, Georgia. Bowden faced the Eagles in three consecutive seasons, from 1988-90, while serving as the head coach at Samford. Bowden is 0-3 all-time against Georgia Southern, including a 31-24 loss in his last trip to Statesboro on Nov. 17, 1990.\n\n• ULM's 2023 roster features seven players from the state of Georgia: wide receiver Jalen Jackson (Powder Springs/Hillgrove), right tackle Keydrell Lewis (Atlanta, Mallard Creek [N.C.], previously Dutchtown), linebacker Qway McCoy (Norman Park/Colquitt County), running back Brady Tillman (Newnan/East Coweta), safety AJ Watts (Columbus/Carver), safety Antwone Watts (Columbus/Carver) and wide receiver Dariyan Wiley (Atlanta/Douglas County).\n\n• ULM graduate quarterback Jiya Wright accounted for 202 yards of total offense and threw one touchdown pass to Isaiah Woullard in last Saturday's 21-20 loss at Texas State. He had a hand in all three of ULM's explosive plays (20 yards or more) from scrimmage. He threw a 41-yard pass on a reverse flea flicker to tight end Nolan Quinlan in the second quarter. He added a 20-yard rush and a 28-yard pass to wide receiver Tyrone Howell in the opening drive of the third quarter. However, the two drives that featured the three total explosive plays led to zero points for ULM.\n\nThrough six games, Wright has connected on 62-of-114 passes (.544) for 694 yards, six TDs and five interceptions. He leads the team with 59 rushes and ranks third on the team with 248 yards (4.2 yards per carry) while adding one rushing TD.\n\n• Running backs Hunter Smith and Isaiah Woullard have combined to rush for 613 yards and three touchdowns through the first six games. Woullard (57 carries for 314 yards and one TD) and Smith (45 carries for 299 yards and two TDs) have accounted for 56 percent of ULM's production on the ground (1095 yards).\n\nThe 5-9, 215-pound Woullard has picked up an impressive 73 percent of his rushing yards after contact (228 of 314) while forcing nine missed tackles. He has picked up 13 first downs on the ground. He scored his first rushing TD as a Warhawk on a 7-yard burst up the middle in the first quarter against App State. Woullard posted his second career 100-yard rushing game against Lamar, finishing with a team-leading 113 yards on 14 attempts. It marked his first since 100-yard performance since 2018 as a true freshman at Ole Miss (107 at Vanderbilt).\n\nThe 5-foot-11, 181-pound Smith leads the team in rushing yards per carry (6.6) after rushing for 299 yards on 45 carries. He leads the team with two rushing TDs and gains of 15 or more yards (6). He has gained 138 of his 299 yards after contact (46 percent), including no negative plays, and has produced 11 first downs. Smith opened with season with consecutive 100-yard games in wins over Army (seven rushes for 103 yards, including a 62-yard TD run in the fourth quarter) and Lamar (13 for 101, including a 27-yard TD run to open the scoring).\n\n• Biletnikoff Award candidate Tyrone Howell leads the Warhawks in receptions (29), receiving yards (313) and touchdown catches (five). The 6-foot-3, 204-pound Howell ranks among the Sun Belt leaders in TD receptions (third, 26th in NCAA FBS) and receptions per game (seventh at 4.8 per game). His 91 receiving yards after catch and 16 first-down receptions also lead the Warhawks. He has led the team in receptions in four of the first six games.\n\nA graduate student, Howell caught two passes for 38 yards, both for first downs, last Saturday at Texas State. He caught four passes for 41 yards and a touchdown on Oct. 7 against South Alabama. He hauled in eight passes for 62 yards against App State and matched his career high with three TD receptions, including scoring plays of 14, 3 and 8 yards from Jiya Wright. He had nine receptions for 67 yards against Army in the season opener, including his one-handed, game-winning 9-yard grab from Hunter Herring with 2:48 left in the fourth quarter.\n\n• The Warhawks lead the Sun Belt Conference and rank among the NCAA FBS leaders in both turnover margin (11th at +1.00 per game) and takeaways (20th with 12, including seven interceptions and five fumble recoveries). With 12 takeaways in six games, the ULM defense already has surpassed its 2022 12-game total of eight (six interceptions and two fumble recoveries). By contrast in 2022, ULM finished 130th in takeaways and 114th in turnover margin (-0.58 pg.) in the NCAA FBS.\n\nThe Warhawks have recorded multiple takeaways in three of their four home games (five vs. Army, two vs. Lamar and four vs. App State).\n\n• Outside linebacker Ja'Terious Evans and safety AJ Watts have been the biggest ball hawks for ULM in the first half of the 2023 season.\n\nEvans is tied for the Sun Belt Conference lead in interceptions with Coastal Carolina's Clayton Isbell with three each. The pair are part of a tie for 12th in NCAA FBS in total interceptions. Evans' third interception of the season resulted in a 76-yard return for a touchdown last Saturday against Texas State, putting ULM on top 20-9 with 8:57 to play. It was the first pick six for ULM since Quae Drake's interception return for TD at Georgia State on Nov. 12, 2022. It capped a 14-play drive for Texas State. Evans also has recorded interceptions against App State and Army. He also ranks second on the team in tackles with 36 (15 solos, 21 assists) and has three tackles for loss for six yards.\n\nWatts has seven passes defended this season, including five pass break ups and two interceptions. He is tied with Georgia Southern's Shemar Bartholomew for the SBC lead in passes defended per game at 1.2 per game. Watts' two interceptions, coming against App State and Army, is tied for third-most in the SBC and 43rd in NCAA FBS.\n\n• Junior middle linebacker Michael Batton leads the team with 50 tackles (16 solos, 34 assists) and ranks seventh in the Sun Belt and 43rd in NCAA FBS, averaging 8.3 tackles per game. The 6-foot-2, 215-pound Batton recorded double digit tackles twice this season, finishing with a team-high 10 stops (2 solos, 8 assists) against App State and also collected 10 tackles against Lamar. Batton has produced double-figure stops in four of his last nine games, dating back to Nov. 12, 2022, at Georgia State (career-best 16 tackles).\n\n2023 STAT LEADERS –\n\nULM (6 games):\n\nRushing – Isaiah Woullard (57 carries for 314 yards, 5.5 avg., 1 TD)\n\nPassing – Jiya Wright (62 of 114, 54%, for 694 yards, 6 TDs, 5 INTs)\n\nReceiving – Tyrone Howell (29 catches for 313 yards, 10.8 avg., 5 TDs)\n\nTackles – Michael Batton (50 tackles, 16 solos, 34 assists, 1.5 TFL, 0.5 sack, 1 QBH)\n\nGeorgia Southern (6 games):\n\nRushing – Jalen White (55 carries for 311 yards, 5.7 avg., 3 TDs)\n\nPassing – Davis Brin (197 of 289, 68%, for 1,882 yards, 12 TDs, 9 INTs)\n\nReceiving – Khaleb Hood (49 catches for 492 yards, 10.0 avg., 3 TDs)\n\nTackles – Marques Watson-Trent (56 tackles, 28 solos, 28 assists, 5.5 TFL, 1.5 sack, 1 INT)\n\nULM/GEORGIA SOUTHERN SERIES NOTES –\n\nSaturday's game marks the 11th meeting between ULM and Georgia Southern, with the Eagles having a 6-3 series lead (7-3 on-the-field record; 2014 win vacated), including a 4-0 record (5-0 on-the-field record; 2014 win vacated) at Paulson Stadium. It is ULM's first visit to Paulson Stadium since Nov. 16, 2019, a 51-29 victory for the Eagles. Georgia Southern won the last meeting between the two teams, 35-30, on Oct. 3, 2020, at Malone Stadium.\n\nTHE LAST MEETING –\n\nGeorgia Southern 35, ULM 30 (Oct. 3, 2020, in Monroe, La.): ULM came a long way back only to fall inches short Saturday night at Malone Stadium. As time expired, quarterback Colby Suits was stopped short on a first-and-goal scramble from the 9 and the Warhawks dropped a 35-30 decision to Georgia Southern.\n\nThe game appeared headed for a blowout in the third quarter when Georgia Southern blocked a punt and scored a touchdown to take an 18-point lead. But the Warhawks got two big stops from the defense and scored on two consecutive possessions to rally. Before his final run, Suits converted a fourth-and-6 with 23 seconds with a scramble out of bounds down to the 9. Suits met two defenders on the last play at the 2-yard line and stretched toward the goal but was ruled down as the clock hit 0:00. After a lengthy review, the call stood and the Warhawks fell to 0-4, 0-2 in the Sun Belt.\n\nSuits completed 31-of-54 passes for 334 yards and two touchdowns without a turnover and led ULM with 51 rushing yards on seven carries. ULM outgained Georgia Southern 426 to 369 and finished 5-of-5 on fourth-down conversions. Josh Johnson rushed for 40 yards and scored two rushing touchdowns and had five catches for 25 yards and another score.\n\nGeorgia Southern running back J.D. King was a royal pain for ULM for most of the game as he battered the Warhawks for 196 rushing yards and a touchdown. Georgia Southern (2-1, 1-1 Sun Belt) rode its triple option attack to 340 rushing yards overall while also benefitting from a shaky performance by ULM special teams. In addition to difficulties stopping the Eagles' ground game, ULM had two punts blocked, with one recovered for a touchdown and missed a PAT.\n\nDespite their troubles, the Warhawks made it interesting late by cutting the lead to five with less than five minutes left in the game. ULM's defense stiffened in the fourth quarter, using a big sack by Ivin White Jr. to force Georgia Southern's second punt and give the Warhawks a chance to make noise on offense. ULM capitalized with an eight-play, 80-yard drive that ended with Johnson smashing into the end zone for a 2-yard touchdown, his second on the ground and third of the game. ULM trailed 35-30 with 4:59 remaining. White came up big again with KeyShawn Johnson on a third-down tackle that forced a Georgia Southern punt with 2:42 to go.\n\nThe Warhawks started their final drive at their own 27 and crossed midfield on a 22-yard pass to Jevin Frett. Suits was hit as he threw incomplete to Chandler Whitfield in the end zone on third-and-6 from the 16, prior to converting on fourth down. ULM moved 72 yards in 13 plays before Suits gained 8 yards on his last run.\n\nULM, which hasn't led in a game this season, was playing from behind from the start. The Eagles needed three King carries to cover 68 yards and score on their opening drive. King's 62-yard run set up his 3-yard touchdown as Georgia Southern went up 7-0 with 11:25 to go in the first quarter. A sequence of special teams plays, one bad and one good, set up ULM's first score.\n\nAfter another quick defensive stop on ULM's second series, the Eagles partially blocked Daniel Sparks' punt and took over at the 50. But ULM's defense hung tough, then the Warhawks sniffed out and stuffed a fake punt to take over at their own 43. ULM converted a fourth-and-7 with a 22-yard Josh Pederson catch to keep the nine-play, 40-yard drive alive. Davis Hughes booted a 34-yard field goal with 3:21 left in the opening period for a 7-3 score.\n\nEarly in the second quarter, King converted on third-and-8 with a 41-yard run and topped 100 yards on just his fourth carry of the game. Wesley Kennedy's 4-yard touchdown run capped Georgia Southern's second scoring march and extended the lead to 14-3 with 12:47 to go.\n\nJohnson dodged a defender and scored his first touchdown of the season with a nifty 26-yard run at the 10:04 mark and pulled ULM within 14-10. Johnson also contributed a 14-yard rush and Suits was 3-for-3 for 34 yards on the six-play, 72-yard drive. Georgia Southern chewed up most of the remaining second quarter with a 75-yard, 15-play drive that consumed 8:27 off the clock. Kennedy's 5-yard rushing touchdown put the Eagles ahead 21-10 with 1:37 left before the half.\n\nThat was enough time for the Warhawks to collect points and pick up steam before the break. Suits had ULM on the 2-yard line with three seconds to go, where the Warhawks went for the touchdown instead of the kick. Suits, who completed 4-of-4 passes for 50 yards, hit Malik Jackson as time expired for a 21-17 halftime score.\n\nThe Eagles came out of the locker room with another strong offensive series to crank up the third quarter. Georgia Southern extended its lead to 28-17 on Logan Wright's 17-yard touchdown run, ending a nine-play, 75-yard drive.\n\nNaJee Thompson's second blocked punt against ULM turned into a quick Georgia Southern touchdown with 5:30 left. After a three-and-out series stalled at the ULM 18, Thompson batted down Sparks' punt and Rashad Byrd recovered in the end zone for a 35-17 advantage.\n\nULM's offense finally found a spark again on the next trip out while converting two fourth downs on the way to the end zone. Suits found tight end Tyler Lamm on a career-long 28-yard reception on fourth-and-2 from the ULM 45, then converted fourth-and-4 with a 6-yard pass to Malik Jackson before connecting with Johnson for a 2-yard touchdown reception, the first of the running back's career. The missed PAT by Hughes left ULM trailing 35-23 with 29 seconds to burn in the third with a pivotal fourth quarter to come.\n\nTHE LAST MEETING AT PAULSON STADIUM –\n\nGeorgia Southern 51, ULM 29 (Nov. 16, 2019, in Statesboro, Ga.): ULM couldn't get its act together on Saturday against Georgia Southern. The Eagles scored 21 points off turnovers and never trailed in a 51-29 win over ULM on a damp, chilly day at Paulson Stadium.\n\nULM actually outgained Georgia Southern, 370-325, but couldn't overcome the self-inflicted wounds. The Warhawks were a woeful 2-for-13 on third down and punted six times. Senior quarterback Caleb Evans passed for 285 yards and two scores but was also intercepted twice. ULM's 1,000-yard runner Josh Johnson was limited to 43 yards on 12 carries.\n\nGeorgia Southern (6-4, 4-2) became bowl eligible with the win while ULM fell to 4-6, 3-3 in the Sun Belt. A wobbly first half found ULM trailing by three touchdowns through two quarters. Georgia Southern's Rashad Byrd picked off Evans' second pass and the Eagles quickly converted the turnover into points. Byrd returned his interception 34 yards to the ULM 21, and quarterback Shai Werts scored on an 11-yard three plays later for a 7-0 lead. ULM's offense shook off the miscue and responded with a nice drive.\n\nAustin Vaughn powered in a 3-yard touchdown run to cap a 13-play, 75-yard march that tied the score at 7-7. Throw out the scoring drive, though, and it was a lethargic first half for ULM's offense. The Warhawks had three three-and-outs with four punts and the turnover to show for their seven possessions.\n\nTyler Bass kicked a 26-yard field goal early in the second quarter to put the Eagles up 10-7. Georgia Southern started the seven-play drive at the ULM 43 after a short punt. The Eagles needed six plays to cover 73 yards and Werts returned the end zone on a 24-yard run as Georgia Southern's lead grew to 17-7. Georgia Southern finished the half against ULM's tiring defense with a nine-play, 88-yard drive and extended its lead to 24-7 as Darion Anderson snared a 33-yard pass from Werts with 37 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Eagles outgained ULM in first-half yardage, 235-132, and held a 13-5 edge in first downs. Evans had just five completions until a 49-yard connection with Perry Carter Jr. on the second series of the second half. Johnson also had a 13-yard catch on fourth-and 6, and Carter's catch was the field-flipper in ULM's eight-play, 84-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run from Evans. ULM trailed 24-14 with 6:41 left in the third quarter.\n\nBut ULM lost traction quickly. Another turnover, this time on special teams, led to another Georgia Southern touchdown. Anthony Beck II's 51-yard punt was muffed by Carter and recovered at the ULM 6-yard line. A 6-yard touchdown run from J.D. King with 25 seconds left in the third quarter put the Eagles up 31-14.\n\nThe spiral continued as Evans threw a pick-six to Donald Rutledge Jr., who rumbled 42 yards to hand ULM a 38-14 deficit. Markis McCray's 1-yard touchdown grab from Evans and Josh Pederson's catch for a two-point conversion made it 38-22 with 12:15 left in the game.\n\nGeorgia Southern salted away its win with a fourth-quarter drive that included three ULM personal fouls and exceeded nine minutes, adding the exclamation point on Wesley Kennedy III's 1-yard touchdown run to go up 44-22 with 2:48 remaining.\n\nPederson grabbed his eighth touchdown pass of the year on a 16-yard pass from Evans with 20 seconds remaining. Georgia Southern's Monquavion Brinson fielded the ensuing onside kick and returned it 42 yards for a touchdown.\n\nWARHAWKS FROM THE PEACH STATE –\n\nULM's 2023 roster features seven players from the state of Georgia: wide receiver Jalen Jackson (Powder Springs/Hillgrove), right tackle Keydrell Lewis (Atlanta, Mallard Creek [N.C.], previously Dutchtown), linebacker Qway McCoy (Norman Park/Colquitt County), running back Brady Tillman (Newnan/East Coweta), safety AJ Watts (Columbus/Carver), safety Antwone Watts (Columbus/Carver) and wide receiver Dariyan Wiley (Atlanta/Douglas County).\n\nTHE LAST TIME OUT –\n\nTexas State 21, ULM 20 (Oct. 14, 2023, in San Marcos, Texas): Texas State overcame an 11-point fourth-quarter deficit Saturday night to squeeze past ULM, 21-20, at rowdy Bobcat Stadium.\n\nFacing a team that came in averaging 41.2 points and 497.8 yards per game, the Warhawks (2-4, 0-3 Sun Belt) kept Texas State out of the end zone until late in the game. But two late Bobcat scores and a final ULM drive that fell just short extended the Warhawks' losing streak to four games.\n\nClinging to a five-point lead, ULM's defense needed one last stand to close out the potential victory. After the Warhawks went three-and-out and punted, Texas State took over at the ULM 24 with 3:15 left in the game.\n\nWith 41 seconds remaining, quarterback T.J. Finley found receiver Joey Hobert for a 22-yard touchdown, completing an 11-play, 75-yard drive. The 2-point pass attempt was incomplete but Texas State (5-2, 2-1 Sun Belt) led by one.\n\nULM's offense, starting at its own 25, had 41 seconds to move the ball into field-goal range. Jiya Wright ran for 16 yards on first down, and Isaiah Woullard gained 19 yards on a flip pass from Wright. After an incompletion, Wright connected with Bugs Mortimer, who weaved his way to the Texas State 28. But ULM was penalized 15 yards for pass interference on the play, and instead ULM was moved back to its own 45 and out of field goal range. After a short pass that lost yardage, the game ended on an 11-yard scramble by Wright as time expired.\n\nWith a big crowd on hand, the atmosphere was charged. In the fourth quarter, Texas State fans tossed debris toward the ULM sidelines and receiver Tyrone Howell was taken off the sideline and escorted to the locker room for tossing a can back into the stands.\n\nTexas State claimed the early 3-0 lead after taking the opening drive 69 yards in 17 plays for a 29-yard field goal from Mason Shipley. The Warhawks launched their counterattack later in the first quarter with an 8-play, 52-yard drive, culminated with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Wright to Woullard. ULM led 7-3 with 3:24 remaining in the period on Woullard's first scoring catch of the season.\n\nThe Bobcats drew closer at 7-6 on Shipley's 34-yard field goal with 14:09 left in the second quarter after ULM's defense held Texas State out of the end zone again at the end of a 13-play, 58-yard drive.\n\nTexas State's 11-play, 58-yard drive sputtered as it approached the end zone and the Bobcats settled for a third field goal on their fifth offensive series. Shipley gave his team a leg up with a season-long 47-yard field goal that pushed the Bobcats ahead 9-7 with 7:06 remaining in the half.\n\nOffensive coordinator Matt Kubik dialed up a flea-flicker that gained 41 yards on a pass from Wright to tight end Nolan Quinlan with 5:01 showing before halftime. The big play set up ULM at the Texas State 4, but the drive ended on downs inside the 1 with 3:26 left in the period when the officials ruled that the Bobcats had held firm on two plunges inside the one-yard line.\n\nThe 9-7 Texas State lead held until halftime, with the Bobcats outgaining ULM 222-142 through the first two quarters. Wright completed 7-of-10 passes for 93 yards and the touchdown to Woullard but the running game managed just 49 yards on 20 attempts.\n\nTexas State's Finley was erratic in the half, completing 14-of-30 passes (47 percent) for 125 yards against the ULM defense.\n\nAfter the teams swapped punts to start the third quarter, ULM started its second drive of the half at the Texas State 33. The prime field position led to a career-long 47-yard field goal by Derek McCormick, giving ULM a 10-9 advantage with 8:24 remaining in the period.\n\nTexas State gambled on fourth-and-7 from the ULM 42, but Adin Huntington registered his second sack of the half and ULM took over at its own 48 with 4:27 to go in the third.\n\nAfter the big defensive stop, ULM faced fourth-and-2 at the Texas State 5-yard line as the fourth quarter began. Bowden elected to kick, and McCormick's 22-yard field goal gave the Warhawks a 13-9 lead with 14:58 left in the game.\n\nOn Texas State's next drive, Ja'Terious Evans made the defensive play of the night for ULM. He snared a Finley pass and raced up the sidelines with a 76-yard interception return for a touchdown that gave the Warhawks a 20-9 lead with 8:57 remaining.\n\nAfter the pivotal turnover, Texas State mounted a 13-play, 75-yard drive and the Bobcats scored their first touchdown on Finley's 11-yard touchdown pass to Hobert with 4:16 to go. The 2-point conversion pass was incomplete, however, and ULM led 20-15.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS –\n\n• Through six games, ULM continues to value the football. The Warhawks rank second in the Sun Belt Conference and rank 22nd in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision with just six turnovers lost.
