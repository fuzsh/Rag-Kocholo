        "text": "THE GAME\n\nWHEN: 5 p.m. Saturday\n\nWHERE: Veterans Memorial Stadium\n\nRECORDS: Akron (1-2), Troy (2-1)\n\nON THE AIR: Radio — WTXK-FM 107.5, WTXK-1210, WACQ-FM 101.1, WACQ-AM 580, WTBF-FM 94.7\n\nLINE: Troy by 15 1/2 (as of Tuesday)\n\nTWITTER: @AStacyLong, @MGMsports\n\nFOUR-DOWN TERRITORY\n\n1. Bowden back in Bama: Akron’s coach is no stranger to the state of Alabama, though Terry Bowden will be coaching a game in the Heart of Dixie for the first time in six years. Bowden, now 61, was 47-17-1 at Auburn from 1993-98, but he also coached at Samford (45-23-1 from 1987-92) and North Alabama (29-9 from 2009-11). “I’ve coached a lot of football in the state of Alabama,” Bowden said. He’s been to Troy a few times, too. While there was Samford’s 29-24 loss to the Trojans in 1992, his family also had a football camp at Troy from at least 1999-2004. “I’m sure this will be a special game for him,” Troy coach Neal Brown said.\n\n2. Further ties: Both offensive coordinators have a history, too. Troy’s Kenny Edenfield was the offensive coordinator at North Alabama from 2002-07 before joining the Trojans. In Edenfield’s last two years with the Lions, A.J. Milwee was UNA’s starting quarterback. Milwee is now in his sixth year on Akron’s staff, fifth as the offensive coordinator.\n\n3. Clock killers: The Trojans were giddy over their last drive in last weekend’s 27-24 win at New Mexico State, though it didn’t end with points. Troy, after taking over at its own 3-yard line, ran out the game’s final six minutes. “We’ve had a problem trying to close out games, run the ball when everybody in the world knows you’re going to run it and you know you’re going to run it, and we were able to do that,” Edenfield said. “That felt really good.” Eight of the drive’s 11 plays were runs, including two third-down conversions. It was easily Troy’s longest drive of the season. “It was a really good feeling, probably one of the better feelings that you feel in this sport,” receiver Deondre Douglas said. The Trojans regularly practiced such drives in the preseason, quarterback Brandon Silvers said. Just not very successfully. “I don’t think we got it right one time during fall camp. The defense always got us,” Silvers said. “It’s really hard to do especially when they know you’re going to run it most of the time. For us to take off six minutes is really great.”\n\n4. Military appreciation: Troy will celebrate the U.S. military Saturday. During pregame festivities, look for an F-16 flyover and an American flag that covers the entire field.\n\nPLAYER OF THE WEEK\n\nTrevon Sanders\n\nNG, Jr., 6-0, 310\n\nAkron coach Terry Bowden touted Troy’s rushing defense this week. If the Trojans want to back up such talk Saturday, that will start up front with Sanders, who has two tackles in three games.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n1-1: Akron coach Terry Bowden’s career record against the Trojans with both games while he was at Samford. The Bulldogs won 24-22 at home in 1991 and the Trojans took a 29-24 home victory in 1992.\n\n121: Number of wins for Bowden between Samford (45-23-1), Auburn (47-17-1) and North Alabama (29-9) in his career.\n\n165: Total wins in Bowden’s career against 101 losses and two ties.\n\n3: Percent body fat for Akron running back Warren Ball, who ranked 22nd nationally on Sports Illustrated’s 2017 Freaks List of Top 40 college football workout warriors.\n\n5.4: Average yards per carry this season for Ball, who has 239 yards and three touchdowns on 44 carries.\n\nPREDICTION"
