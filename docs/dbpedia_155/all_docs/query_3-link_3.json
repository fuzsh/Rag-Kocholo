        "text": "Terry Bowden has always been a builder, but he’s now embarking on perhaps the most challenging task of his career.\n\nBowden — who turns 65 next week — was hired in December at Louisiana-Monroe, a Sun Belt Conference program that went 0-10 and was outscored 420-163 in 2020. The Warhawks last had a winning season in 2012, but the ever-upbeat Bowden said he is looking forward to the challenge in Monroe.\n\n“I’m glad to be back down South,” Bowden said in an interview this week with Randy Kennedy and me on Mobile’s SportsTalk 99.5 FM. “You don’t have to be in Monroe, La., long to remember how passionate Southerners are about college football … It reminds me of coaching in Alabama.\n\n“This is the first job I’ve ever gone to where I didn’t plan on going somewhere else. This is where I want to finish up. … I can’t think of any job I’d rather take over and try to turn around than Monroe.”\n\nBowden is 175-114-2 in 25 seasons as a head coach at five different stops, three of those in the state of Alabama. One of four sons of Florida State coaching legend Bobby Bowden, he coached Samford to a 45-23-1 record and a pair of NCAA Division I-AA playoff berths in five seasons, which landed him the job at Auburn in 1993.\n\nAuburn went 5-6 and 5-5-1 under Pat Dye the two years before Bowden arrived, but went 11-0 in 1993 and won its first nine games in 1994 before a tie with Georgia and a seven-point loss to Alabama. Bowden’s Tigers reached the SEC championship game in 1997 (the 1993 Tigers were ineligible for the postseason), and went 3-2 against Alabama.\n\n“Jimbo Fisher was my quarterbacks coach, (older brother) Tommy Bowden was my offensive coordinator, Rodney Garner, Joe Whitt, Wayne Hall, Pete Jenkins — I had some great, great coaches that I worked with my during that time,” Bowden said. “And you really don’t know how good your coaches are until you look back and see where they are now. That was one thing I was blessed with.\n\n“The thing I wanted to be great at was bringing out the greatness in others — my players or my assistants, and trying to work off that. … We had a good, solid team, but we had a blue-collar team. Pat Dye was a very tough, old-school coach, and he left us a bunch of tough guys. And then we added a few guys, Willie Anderson, Dameyune Craig, guys like that, that weren’t bad either.”\n\nAt 36, Bowden was the youngest major-college football coach in the country when he went to Auburn. He declined to go into detail about his departure from Auburn (or the obvious parallels between his exit and the one recently experienced by Gus Malzahn), but said he still looks back with pride on what the Tigers accomplished during his tenure.\n\n“They were all great jobs at different levels,” Bowden said. “Coming through Alabama on I-20, I passed all those schools. … We were fortunate. We went 2-1 vs. LSU when I was at Auburn. And we play LSU this year, by the way.\n\n“I’ve always just wanted to coach football. I never cared where. But when you go 11-0 at Auburn and you’re the first coach ever to do that your first year and win your first 20 games as a head coach in the SEC and you’re not the best coach in your own family, you learn humility.”\n\nBowden worked in television as a studio analyst for ABC Sports from 1999-2008 before getting the coaching bug again, taking over at then-Division II North Alabama. The Lions went 29-9 and reached the playoffs in all three of his seasons, before the coach returned to the FBS level at Akron.\n\nIt took four years for Bowden to get the Zips into the postseason, as his 2015 team went 8-5 and beat Utah State in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl — the program’s first-ever bowl win. Akron fell off the next three seasons, and Bowden was fired at the end of a 4-8 campaign in 2018.\n\nThen past 60, it might have seemed logical for Bowden to finally hang up his headset. But instead, he worked for two seasons at Clemson, in a role alternately described as an analyst, graduate assistant and intern.\n\n“I had two full years on my (Akron) contract — the benefits, the salary and everything — and I wanted to be an analyst just to stay in the hunt,” Bowden said. “And (Dabo) Swinney, my brother Tommy hired him, and he told me ‘Terry, I’d like for you to be an analyst, but I’ve given all my positions away and you’d have to be a student.’\n\n“So I applied for graduate school at Clemson and got accepted. It was more for a key to the door and liability and those things. You can’t hardly volunteer to a major program, because of all the things involved. So I did take graduate school classes online. I did most of my work for (defensive coordinator) Brent Venables, crossover work. The last team I studied was Alabama, because I was working a week ahead.\n\n“So while we were getting beat by Ohio State, I was studying Alabama. And that was pretty ugly, how good they were. That wasn’t an easy one to watch and have to turn that report in.”\n\nULM fired Matt Viator after the former McNeese State coach posted a 19-39 record in five seasons. A number of high-profile coaches were mentioned in connection with the job before Bowden’s name surfaced, but news broke just before Christmas that he was headed to Monroe.\n\nThe Warhawks have some of the worst facilities and smallest football budget in the FBS, something Bowden said he’s hoping to improve during his tenure. He said that given the school’s location in one of the country’s fertile recruiting areas in the country, that there’s no reason they shouldn’t be able to field a competitive team.\n\n“It’s budget and funding at Monroe,” Bowden said. “You can’t say you don’t have good football players. You take a five-hour circle around Monroe, and you’ve got Dallas, Houston, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Mobile, Birmingham, Memphis, Little Rock. That’s the driving circle around Monroe. … There’s a lot of great football players come out of here, but the problem is, it’s a smaller school — 10,000 (enrollment) in a rural area, and they haven’t kept up with the other schools.\n\n“There’s been a building phase with every school in the (Sun Belt) Conference the last five to eight years, and that’s what we now have to go through. But I believe that because of recruiting and the ability to find recruits in this area, that we can be successful. At the same time, I’ve got to put on my fundraising hat, some of those same things we did at Samford when I was there.”\n\n“I’d like to be the first coach in the last 35 years not to go out of here in a coffin. I’d like to be able to turn it over to one of my assistants.”\n\nBowden isn’t the only coaching veteran to join the ULM program this offseason. Rich Rodriguez, the former head coach at West Virginia and Arizona and most recently the offensive coordinator at Ole Miss, has joined on as the Warhawks’ OC.\n\nBowden and Rodriguez go way back, with Rodriguez having coached under Terry’s brother Tommy at both Tulane and Clemson. Rodriguez’s son, quarterback Rhett Rodriguez, has also joined the Warhawks after transferring from Arizona.\n\n“I’m going to turn that offense over to him, and I’m going to be a fundraiser and recruiting coordinator,” Bowden said. “And I think together we’ve had a blast. … I told him ‘just slow down, you’ll be a head coach again, just come coach your son for a couple of years.’ And he’s done that.”"
