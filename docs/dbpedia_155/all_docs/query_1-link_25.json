        "text": "FLORENCE, Ala. | Terry Bowden, the NCAA Division I coach of the year in 1993 while at Auburn, has been hired as head football coach at the University of North Alabama, the Florence (Ala.) TimesDaily reported Wednesday night.\n\nBowden, 52, will be officially introduced to the media this morning during a news conference at 11 a.m., sources say.\n\nHe will replace Mark Hudspeth, who left UNA on Dec. 13 to become passing game coordinator at Mississippi State.\n\nBowden posted a 46-16-1 record in six seasons at Auburn. The Tigers were a perfect 11-0 in 1993, his first season at Auburn. At the end of the season, he was chosen the Division I national coach of the year by several organizations.\n\nBowden has a 111-53-2 overall coaching record but has not coached since leaving Auburn in 1998 under controversial circumstances. He resigned six games into the season after reportedly being told he would be fired at the end of the year.\n\nBowden, who lettered as a running back at West Virginia, has also been head coach at NAIA Salem College in West Virginia (1983-85) and Samford University in Birmingham (1987-92).\n\nHe is the son of Florida State football coach Bobby Bowden.\n\nMost recently, Bowden has worked for ABC Sports, Westwood One Radio network and ESPN.\n\nIn fact, Bowden was the color commentator for Westwood One Radio's broadcast of the NCAA Division II National Championship Game in Florence on Dec. 13.\n\nHe has also been a motivational speaker in recent years, working with numerous companies nationwide on a variety of issues.\n\nThe Lions were 12-2 this year, being eliminated in the national semifinals.\n\n[ Jeff McIntyre is the assistant sports editor for the Times Daily in Florence, Ala. ]"
