        "text": "Clemson experienced a down year for them, but the month of December has not been kind to them whatsoever. Dabo will report to a new AD (or does the AD report to Dabo? lol) and he will have to overhaul his coaching staff after losing both Coordinators. The recruiting class could also take a hit with these changes. We’ll see how good Dabo is now…\n\nI mentioned Minnesota at Iowa, so I can’t help but talk about the trophy at stake as well! The Floyd of Rosedale is a bronze statue of a pig honoring an actual pig. The original animal was the price of a bet on the 1935 game between Minnesota Governor Floyd Olson and Iowa Governor Clyde Herring. The pig, a prize hog, hailed from Rosedale, Iowa. The Golden Gophers won the real pig in a 13-6 decision, ultimately finishing the season 8-0 and capturing the second of their three consecutive national titles. (Info courtesy of FBSchedules)\n\nA couple of interesting FBS/FCS matchups this week that have garnered my attention: UMass at Maine - two former Yankee Conference teams that played every year from 1958 thru 2011 - a period of 54 years. The Minutemen lead the all-time series 41-18-1, but the Black Bears have won 4 of the last 6 meetings. And Bucknell at Army - Have played only six times (three since 1927), but met for the first time in 1900, with Army winning that game 18-10. The Bison have yet to beat the Black Knights - and they won’t do it this year as well.\n\nSad to think that Divisions II and III are wrapping up their regular seasons tomorrow. But their playoffs are exciting to follow! Just looking at Division III, there will be thirty trophies being handed out, eleven playoff bids will be decided via conference wins - and another five at-large bids that depend on Saturday’s games. Lastly, and perhaps most impressive, there will be four matchups (Williams/Amherst, Bowdoin/Colby, Monmouth/Knox, and Hampden-Sydney/Randolph-Macon) where opponents are meeting for the 125th or more times.\n\nLast night wrapped up the 2nd of four weeks of MACtion this month - though this week was the only “fully” scheduled one with all teams playing either Tuesday or Wednesday. A couple of highlights: Northern Illinois got a last-second field goal (right down the middle!) to beat Ball State, and the best moment was seeing the kicker, John Richardson, run straight to the Cardinal sideline looking for the Bronze Stalk Trophy. Meanwhile, Chippewa running back Lew Nichols III had another impressive stat line: 215 rushing yards and four touchdowns. And with Kent State losing to Central Michigan, it sets up an end-of-season battle between the Golden Flashes and Miami (Ohio) for the East Division.\n\nThe Huskies last-second win was their eighth game this year that has come down to one possession. Of those, NIU has won six of them - so they sit atop the MAC West Division with a record of 7-3. On the flip side, Toledo has been in four one-possession games, and they are 0-4 in those games, so they sit at 5-5 for the season. As far as I know, the two teams with the worst luck this year in close games: Nebraska (0-6) and UNLV (0-5)\n\nI read this morning that someone covering college football wrote that there will be no winless teams in college football this season. That comment comes after Arizona ended their 20-game losing streak against a depleted Cal team, and UNLV finally pulled off a win after losing five one possession games this year. By my count this morning, I see 24 winless college football teams - thirteen of them being in Division III, and that division is finishing up their regular season next weekend. So…yes, there will be some winless teams in college football this season.\n\nAnd while I have talked about firings, two schools have hired new coaches for 2022 already: Clay Helton was fired earlier this year at USC, but he has already been picked up off the scrap heap as he will now be the Georgia Southern head coach in 2022. And reports this morning are indicating that Texas Tech has hired their new coach for the next year. Joey McGuire had been hired away from Baylor after three years of being the Bears’ associate head coach. This will be McGuire’s first head coaching gig in college, but he has won three Texas state championships in Texas. Maybe the Red Raiders have found the second coming of Jeff Traylor.\n\nWorking on Saturdays is a killer when we have Army vs. Air Force kicking off at this moment in Texas. This season marks the 50th year of Commander-in-Chief's trophy competition, where the trophy goes annually to the winning academy with the best record in the round-robin competition. Earlier this year, on 9/11, the Falcons opened the series with a 23-3 win at Navy. Air Force can win a record 21st trophy title, their first since 2016, with a win over Army this week. If the Falcons win it, each Academy would have a title in the last three years. An Army win this week would put the Black Knights in the driver's seat to win its second straight and fourth in the last five years. I can’t stand that I am missing this!\n\nLast night there were three very interesting games - all for different reasons. Utah is now firmly in the driver’s seat for the Pac-12 South title after their big win over Stanford. Tavion Thomas followed up his 160 yards and four scores against the Bruins with 177 yards on twenty carries and four more touchdowns. Phil Jurkovec returned to lead Boston College over Virginia Tech, in a game that wasn’t very pretty. It gives the Eagles their first ACC win of the year, and lights a hot fire under Justin Fuente. And last, but not least, Dartmouth’s win over Princeton last night opened up the door for them to get their 20th Ivy League title. If they take care of business, as they should, against Cornell and Brown - and get help from either Yale or Penn, the title will be theirs outright.\n\nYou can tell November is here when looking at matchups. Here are my choices for viewing (if I were home!): Army vs. Air Force and Wake Forest at UNC early, Michigan State at Purdue and Auburn at Texas A&M in the afternoon. And in the evening: Tennessee at Kentucky and Oregon at Washington. Following at length: Liberty at Ole Miss, Kansas State at Kansas, Navy at Notre Dame, Penn State at Maryland, Colorado State at Wyoming, Texas at Iowa State, Boise State at Fresno State.\n\nThree quarterbacks I am looking forward to watching tomorrow: Sam Howell will be facing Wake Forest - a team that gave up 179 passing yards to Army. Howell has fallen of the Heisman watch, but Demon Deacon head coach Dave Clawson is convinced that Sam is playing better this year than last. Bo Nix travels with his Tiger teammates to College Station to face the Aggies. Nix has had an up and down career, and it would go a long way for this talented qb to beat A&M. It wasn’t long ago that he was benched in favor of TJ Finley when the Tigers trailed Georgia State. And lastly, Malik Wills will have a chance to throw against a SEC team when Liberty goes to play in Oxford. A lot of eyes and probably a lot of money will be riding on his performance against the Rebels.\n\nThe Cascade Clash between Washington and Oregon is rough and bitter. Two quotes are adding gas to the fire for this year’s game: Jimmy Lake, Husky Head Coach, says “Our battles are really the schools we go against, that have academic prowess like the University of Washington -- Notre Dame, Stanford, USC. We go with a lot of battles, toe to toe, all the way to the end, with those schools,\" U-Dub head coach Jimmy Lake said on recruiting against Oregon. \"So I think that’s made up and pumped up in [the media’s] world. In our world, we battle more academically prowess teams.” Oregon’s Presidents replies, “UW is a wonderful school with a great football history. I have great respect and affection for its president, its academic and football program and its former exceptional football coach, coach Petersen,\" added Oregon president Michael Schill. \"I look forward to our team meeting theirs on the gridiron this Saturday.” Put that headgear on a bit tighter tomorrow…and tune in at 7:30 on ABC…\n\nWith wins already this week, both Kent State and Eastern Michigan inched closer to being bowl eligible in 2021. The Golden Flashes won their first bowl in 2019, and are looking for their fourth FBS Bowl bid in fifty years. The first coach to take them bowling was Don James in 1972, and of course James is most famous for his time as the head coach of the Washington Huskies. Meanwhile, Chris Creighton is looking to lead the Eagles to their fourth FBS bowl game in six years - after not having been to one since 1971.\n\nLooks like it’s all MAC today in my written thoughts, as I saw that Tom Arth was fired as the Akron Zips coach this morning. On Tuesday, Akron fell to 2-7 on the season after their loss to Ball State, making Arth 3-24 as coach of the Zips. No big surprise. He is the third coach this week (1 FCS coach) after Gary Patterson stepped down at TCU (deserving of more space - probably a Rant and Rave blog) and Donald Hill-Eley was fired as Alabama State head coach after his team lost to Alabama A&M in the Magic City Classic this past Saturday for the fourth straight season.\n\nA couple of interesting notes regarding this week’s AP Top 25 poll: Wake Forest is ranked in the Top 10 for the first-time ever, the last Power 5 team to do so. The Demon Deacons also improved to 8-0 for the first time in their program history. And with that last second win over SMU with a kickoff return for a touchdown, Houston becomes the 45th different team to appear in the poll. Wonder if it will get to 50 by year-end.\n\nIn last night’s action, Nevada beat UNLV to claim the 545-pound Freemont Cannon trophy for the 2nd straight year. The Wolf Pack will now look forward to games against San Jose State, San Diego State and Air Force. Tulsa’s tough year continued as they dropped a home game to the Midshipmen, 20-17. It was the Golden Hurricanes 6th one-possession game of the year in which they have won 3 of them. Meanwhile, in Friday Night Ivy League action Princeton remains undefeated as they beat Cornell in New York, 34-16.\n\nSome of the luster for today’s Big Ten games was taken away with Penn State’s loss to Illinois last week, but there is still plenty at stake. The only way that the Michigan/Michigan State game could get any bigger was if it was played at Ann Arbor in front of 105k fans instead of “only” 75k in East Lansing. The Spartans have taken nine of the last thirteen matchups - including the “trouble with the snap” game six years ago. And don’t sleep on the Iowa at Wisconsin game. The Badgers could still find their way to the Big Ten Championship game, while Iowa has to rebound (from their loss to Purdue two weeks ago) on the road at Camp Randall Stadium - not an easy task.\n\nQuite a few critical games in the FCS for either one or both teams. In the Ivy League, Dartmouth at Harvard and Columbia at Yale are matchups where all teams involved have one league loss. The winners of today’s games will still be in the title picture, while the losers will take on a spoiler role. While in the MVFC, both North Dakota and Missouri State are trying to keep their playoff hopes alive, while Northern Iowa would like nothing more than to pad their resume with a big win over highly-ranked Southern Illinois. And lastly, the Pioneer League has a matchup of the leagues only undefeated teams - Davidson at Morehead State. The Wildcats are the defending champions, and have already beaten San Diego, while the Eagles are looking to stay on track for their first-ever playoff berth.\n\nWhile putting together my list of Games to Follow for the teams outside the FBS, I noticed that it had quite a list of Eastern teams. When it came down to my last entrant, I pushed aside my preference for the UMaine/Rhode Island game so that I could include the Illinois State/Western Illinois game. Now this game doesn’t have any relevance for the playoffs or conference title, but it’s an in-state rivalry that started in the 19th century, and has been played more than 100 times. Hard to not include that…\n\nNo surprise to see Southern Miss joining the Sun Belt Conference. Could be the start of a big week for the conference, because they might be adding three more schools when all is said and done - Marshall, Old Dominion (has now officially signed), and James Madison. The Golden Eagles were the last charter member of CUSA, dating back to 1995. We could be seeing the end of that conference unless they persuade independents to join and FCS teams to move up.\n\nArkansas State, a team that has had quite a bit of success in the Sun Belt, has struggled defensively so far in 2021. There have been three 99-yard touchdowns the last three weeks, and the Red Wolves have given up to of them. In fact, Arkansas State has allowed eight plays of 70 or more yards this season. Lastly, when trailing Louisiana by only one point in the fourth quarter, the defense couldn’t get off the field for the final 10:30 minutes of the game. Not good at all.\n\nIt seems like I am updating the Longest Tenured FBS Coaches document too often this year. Yesterday Texas Tech has dismissed Matt Wells, who has led the Red Raiders to a 5-3 start, three years after hiring him away from Utah State. I am sure that they have their eyes set on a couple of good candidates that know the state well: Sonny Dykes and Jeff Traylor. With what he has built in Dallas with the resources available, I hope Dykes stays put. As for Traylor, everything I have read about him is great, and I would think that he would make the Red Raiders a real threat in the new Big 12.\n\nA nice article on ESPN.com regarding the reranking of the 2019 recruiting class. No big surprise to see Oregon’s Kayvon Thibodeaux still ranked at the top - he is a stud. Of course not every big recruit pans out - case in point, only four of the original top 10 recruits are ranked now in the top 25. The biggest surprise to all: Breece Hall - who was unranked, was only the Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year last year. Other big jumpers (can’t call them over achievers) - USC WR Drake London, Alabama WR John Metchie III, Michigan State RB Kenneth Walker III.\n\nTerry Bowden has done a super job at ULM thus far in 2021! Coming off a winless season, the Warhawks hired Bowden - and across the board people gave it a thumbs down. After a win over favored South Alabama, ULM has a 4-3 record, and could possibly qualify for a bowl bid. On the flipside, Justin Fuente’s Hokies blew a late lead at home and let Syracuse escape with a victory. That drops VT’s record to 3-4 this year, and 22-22 since 2018 (Fuente’s recruiting - not Frank Beamer’s). The hot seat is very hot in Blacksburg.\n\nWhat a race in the Southern Conference (one of my favorites outside of the Ivy and Patriot Leagues) of the FCS! Four teams have one league loss: East Tennessee State, Mercer, Chattanooga, and my favorite - VMI. Quite a change from previous years where we would see Wofford and Furman fight for the lead. Looking at the remaining schedule, ETSU has the best path to a title, but fifteen of the Bucs’ last sixteen conference games have been decided by one possession!\n\nSpeaking of the Lions win over Dartmouth last night, I can’t get too upset because Columbia is having a very good season, and the win should pretty much ensure them of a winning season, as they are now 5-1. Since the Ivy League was formed in 1956, the Lions have had only seven winning seasons - with two of them in the last three years. I just wish that their big win didn’t come at the expense of the Big Green!\n\nThe Ivy League is well represented in FCS Top 25 polls. The Stats poll has Princeton at #22 and Dartmouth at #25 - in thanks to their respective victories over Monmouth and UNH. While the Coaches Poll has Princeton at #17 and Harvard at #16 - and Dartmouth is just outside the Top 25. Things will get serious the next two Saturdays when the Crimson first visit Princeton and then next weekend they host Dartmouth.\n\nSome streaks that teams are looking forward to extend this weekend: (5) Ohio State has won 25-straight over Indiana (last loss in 1988), (3) Oklahoma has won 16-straight over Kansas (last loss in 1997), Wisconsin has won 14-straight over (25) Purdue (last loss in 2003), and (4) Alabama has won 14-straight over Tennessee (last loss in 2006). When looking at this list - it’s more like the Boilermakers are looking to snap their losing skid against the Badgers so that they remain ranked.\n\nGreat action last night on all levels - except Division II which didn’t play a game. Oregon held off Cal with a last second goal line stand to keep their playoff hopes alive, while the San Diego State/San Jose State game went to double overtime before the Aztecs prevailed. In FCS action, Montana State might have ended Weber State’s playoff hopes with a defensive 13-7 win, while Cornell picked up their first victory of the year by beating their Central New York rival Colgate. Lastly, Muhlenberg held the highest scoring team in the nation to six points in their 21-6 win over Johns Hopkins - which allowed Susquehanna to take over first place on their own after defeating Gettysburg easily, 47-7.\n\nI might be a bit less windy than the last note as I talk about sharp uniforms expected for today’s games - though I must say that Oregon’s unis last night were sharp! Starting with the Big 12 - not sure I am a huge fan of the throwback Kansas uniforms, but I do like the angry Jayhawk on the shoulder pad, while Baylor’s Sailor Bear helmets are really cool! In the SEC, Missouri has their helmet finally right - and if A&M wears their white hats, this will be a great combo, In throwbacks, Montana and Washington are awesome looking, while Columbia’s 1961 throwback isn’t too bad and worth a look, especially since Penn has replicated a bit of their campus, the “Locust Walk”, on the top of their helmets for today. Perhaps the best uniform/helmet combination will be the Iowa and Purdue game - especially since the Boilermakers are going with their best helmet! And lastly, Washington State put out perhaps the best twitter video I have seen yet when they revealed their Family Weekend uniforms. It was so damn cute, I couldn’t help but smile and laugh!\n\nTurning my attention back to the Penn at Columbia game today…This will be the 100th meeting between the two schools in a series that dates back to 1878. If the Lions win, it will be the program’s 400th all-time victory (against 682 losses and 43 ties). And Al Bagnoli, who previously served as the head coach at Penn for 23 seasons (1992-2014), won his 260th career games last week against Central Connecticut State - his alma mater. He is currently the winningest active coach at the FCS level. These little tidbits are why I love this game so much!\n\nMinnesota and North Dakota have agreed to a two-game series with the games being played in 2028 and 2030. I like seeing this matchup because they first met on the gridiron in 1900 and have played 20 times overall - with the Gophers winning all the games. Unfortunately for the Fighting Sioux/Hawks, they have been outscored by a margin of 30 points in these games, but most of the matchups were from 1898 to 1927..\n\nDespite some outcomes that weren’t too favorable to my palate, I am still coming off my high from Saturday’s games! For me, it all started with watching some ESPN+ games: Akron at Bowling Green, Colgate at Brown, Bucknell at Lafayette, and Yale at Dartmouth. Then after some chores in the garden, I got to finish the Penn State at Iowa game. It was great watching the fans storm the field - much like Kentucky fans the week before. And what about the game of the year so far at the Cotton Bowl! I wish that the Longhorns had won - but what a game in a great rivalry!\n\nA&M ended Alabama’s streak of 100 straight wins over non-ranked teams and Saban lost his first-game ever against a former assistant, but does anyone believe that the Crimson Tide won’t be in the CFB playoff? The bigger question has to be whether Lincoln Riley can hold things together in Norman after the benching of Spencer Rattler and the comeback effort of Caleb Williams? This will be a fun development to follow for the next few weeks. And are CFB fans ready for the return of the Buckeyes?\n\nIt’s only Tuesday - and we can already get a little fix for our love of college football. The Sun Belt is giving us a fun game to watch tonight - Appalachian State at Louisiana. The Ragin’ Cajuns haven’t lived up to expectations this year, but would anyone be surprised if they beat the Mountaineers? On the other hand, App. State is going to be a handful down - even in the Bayou State.\n\nAnd, here are three FCS games that deserve mentioning in my eyes: Lafayette at Bucknell - these Patriot League teams meeting for the 99th time, first played in 1883, and have played each other every year since 1945 (76 straight years). Furman at Wofford - these two teams claim that their series is truly the “Deep South’s Oldest Football Rivalry” as they first met in 1889 - while Georgia/Auburn didn’t play until 1892. North Dakota at South Dakota - this will be the 98th all-time meeting between these teams that dates back to their first contest in 1903. The Sitting Bull Trophy was awarded to the winner starting in 1953, and the inspiration behind it was the dispute over which state was home to the final resting place of the famed chief. Unfortunately the trophy was retired in 2000.\n\nFCS games I will be trying to watch tomorrow: Yale and Dartmouth - probably my favorite Ivy League game of all - even more than Yale/Harvard. Villanova at James Madison - funny thing about this game - this is the Dukes third straight game against a ranked team whose nickname is Wildcats. Sticking with the CAA - Delaware at Rhode Island as the Rams are still undefeated and are led by a former Maryland quarterback (Kasim Hill). Southern Illinois at South Dakota State - this barely beats out the UNI/North Dakota State game, but I’m thinking that the Salukis might pull this out because the Jackrabbits are getting hit hard with the injury bug. And lastly. SE Louisiana at Nicholls - as the two qbs (Cole Kelley and Lindsey Scott) are going to produce some serious offensive numbers.\n\nTwo days ago I quickly mentioned UMass playing UConn this weekend. What I like about the Minuteman’s schedule this year is that they will be playing three former Yankee Conference rivals starting with the Huskies. UConn is their oldest opponent of the three, as the series started in 1897 - while they have played the Rams 86 times, winning 48 of those meetings. And you can’t sleep on the Black Bears series because UMass played UMaine for 54-straight seasons from 1958 through 2011.\n\nHave got to give some love to Kentucky and Pitt’s quarterback Kenny Pickett. Big news that the Wildcats beat the Gators at home for the first time in 35 years after being so close the last couple of times. After losing 31-straight years to Florida, Kentucky has split the last four with the Gators. So happy the crowd poured out on the field to celebrate - it was well worth the fine! Meanwhile, Kenny Pickett is trying to lead Pitt to the ACC championship as a super senior. So far in five games, Pickett has thrown 19 touchdown passes against only one interception. Seems funny to me that he is hardly mentioned as a Heisman candidate.\n\nEd Orgeron must be feeling the heat regarding his position as head coach of LSU. After the Tigers won the National Championship in 2019, they went 5-5 last year to end their streak of 21-straight winning seasons. Now in 2021, they are 3-2 after a home loss to Auburn, and they still have to play Kentucky, Florida, and the SEC West, except for Mississippi State and Auburn. A losing season is not out of the question - and it might cost Orgeron his job.\n\nWhile I am on the topic of ugly…Bowdoin football. JB Wells was fired at the end of the 2018 season after compiling a 3-31 record over four years. The Polar Bears then hired BJ Hammer from Allegheny - but he has fared worse if possible, going 0-11 in just over two years. Today they play the William Ephs in Brunswick - and they might be the best team in the NESCAC this year. Looks like Bowdoin will lose its 13th straight, and their 36th out of 37 games.\n\nGreat games today! The noon time slot might be the best: Arkansas at Georgia, Michigan at Wisconsin and Texas at TCU. Three under the radar games for me to watch/follow: Louisville at Wake Forest, Auburn at LSU, and Arizona State at UCLA. And the Aggies…will they bounce back and get back to winning with their game against Mississippi State? And will K-State make it three-straight over the Sooners? October is starting off red-hot!\n\nIf I were to pick a game to watch at the 12:00, 3:30, and 7:00 start up times, the games would be: Oregon at Ohio State, Air Force at Navy, and Texas at Arkansas. And if my eyes were to wander I would grab the remote and see Pitt at Tennessee, Iowa at Iowa State and NC State at Mississippi State. Again - there are a whole bunch of games to keep one busy…\n\nThree games are being played in Division III tonight to go with the four FBS matchups. I’m thinking that I will stream Western New England at Westfield State. It will be the 33rd edition of the Presidents' Cup – the annual trophy game between the two schools. The Golden Bears outscored the Owls 56-35 in 2019 at Alumni Field, the last time these two teams met, and WNE has won 9 of the last 10 meetings to take the series lead 18-14.\n\nA Friday night matchup got a bit more interesting after week 1 results. North Dakota easily beat Idaho State on the road, while Utah State pulled an upset over Washington State in Pullman. The Fighting Hawks (still want to say Fighting Sioux), are the defending Missouri Valley Football Conference champions, while the Aggies may have gotten a big boost with new head coach Blake Anderson, and his former quarterback at Arkansas State Logan Bonner. One of these teams will be very happy to be 2-0 after this key matchup for both teams!\n\nI haven’t seen it on the NCAA Statistics website, and it might be because of an oversight, but a couple of different sources have mentioned that Fordham’s senior linebacker Ryan Greenhagen recorded 31 total tackles against Nebraska on Saturday. It has been reported that it is a NCAA Division I record, but upon a bit of research - it looks like a NCAA record because Divisions II and III have their tackle records as 30.\n\nThursday night I watched the first Division III game of the year: Defiance at Capital. The Crusaders got Brian Foos his first win as head coach of the team - and it was Capital’s first win since November 10th, 2018. And a victory of sorts for Defiance as they scored for the first-time ever against the Crusaders. Their scoreless streak ended after almost 15 quarters - but it was over a period of 98 years…\n\nA nice read from Dave Wilson and Harry Lyles, Jr. on ESPN regarding what to watch for in this weekend’s games. No doubt - there are a lot of great games to get into the next FIVE days! One could also see the debut of two mascots - the next Ralphie (only 500lbs) and Reveille X. And I will have to be on the lookout for SMU’s 6-8, 232 lb. kicker on Saturday night against North Texas!\n\nDivision III is in action starting tonight - and by the end of the year they will have played probably close to 1,200 games! Defiance, with an enrollment of less than 500, will visit Capital to get the division going at 6:00 tonight. This will be their first meeting since 1942 (Capital won 33-0), and Defiance is still looking for their first points against the Crusaders. The first two meetings, in 1923 and 1929, ended in a scoreless tie.\n\nI have to admit that I had forgotten how many great games there will be this weekend until I read through the schedule again! And to get ready for the season, I highly suggest Bill Connelly’s “How to get the most fun out of the 2021 college football season” - as I was really enjoying it even before getting to the end and seeing his plug for the lower divisions!\n\nI didn’t realize similar Frank Solich’s situation at Nebraska was to Earle Bruce’s at Ohio State. Both had been recruited as fullbacks - but Bruce’s career was ended by a torn meniscus before he could play a down for the Buckeyes. Each followed a legend - Bruce replaced Woody Hayes and Solich took over for Tom Osborne. And both were fired even though they averaged nine wins per year. Seems to me like the administrations at Ohio State and Nebraska made a mistake.\n\nCarnegie Mellon head football coach Rich Lackner has announced that he will retire following the 2021 season. This season marks Lackner’s 36th year at the helm of the Tartans, his 43rd as a coach at his alma mater and 47th on campus. He is one of 16 active head coaches among all divisions with 200 career victories, and he is third among active Division III head coaches in total career wins. He became the 34th coach ever to win all 200 games at the same institution, and just the 11th to do so at the Division III level.\n\nSince the theme today seems to be coaches, and my brother and his wife are celebrating their 40th anniversary out near Mount Rushmore - how about I give my Mount Rushmore of all-time head coaches? There are many worthy candidates, but four came to mind pretty quickly: Pop Warner, Bear Bryant, Bobby Bowden and Nick Saban. Can’t find fault with any of them, but I’m sure that someone would tell me that another coach or two belongs with the best.\n\nTook a moment to get through a couple of chapters of Herbstreit’s new book. Didn’t take long to realize that things weren’t handed to Kirk on a golden platter, and that he certainly didn’t have the best home life while growing up. And starting the book talking about the birth of his premature twin sons was a punch in the gut. I say soak it all up Kirk - because you have earned and deserve every special moment that comes your way!\n\nSome interesting developments for SEC East rivals Tennessee and Kentucky recently. Six Wildcats are being charged with burglary based on a March incident at a party, and one of their quarterbacks has entered the transfer portal - and already has found a new home. Meanwhile the Vols lost one quarterback back in June due to their second off-field incident this year, and now another is leaving. Brian Maurer, who was getting fewer reps in camp, is planning on entering the transfer portal, leaving Tennessee with three scholarship quarterbacks in 2021.\n\nThe one-season partnership between the ASUN and Western Athletic Conference will be interesting as they will go their own ways after 2021. Defending FCS champion Sam Houston will have to hold off stiff challenges from both Jacksonville State and Central Arkansas - who are both ranked in the FCS Preseason Top 25 (actually in the Top 15). Throw in a game Eastern Kentucky team, some former Southland rivals (Abilene Christian and Stephen F. Austin), and a couple of FCS newcomers, and the results might bring a surprise or two.\n\nSaw a piece on the Athletic about teams that draw the largest viewers. No surprise to see Alabama, Ohio State and Michigan at the top, nor was it a surprise to see Michigan-Ohio State, LSU-Alabama or Auburn-Alabama as the most watched matchups. What did surprise me was not seeing one Army-Navy game in the most watched games from 2015-2019. And outside of Oklahoma and Clemson, the teams that had the most games with 4 million or more viewers were all from the Big Ten and SEC.\n\nAs I stepped out the door to walk the dog yesterday afternoon, I was excited to see a package from Amazon. Not wanting to cut the walk short for Griffin, I patiently waited for him as he kept his nose to the ground throughout our wandering. After taking care of his stomach, I ripped open the box and instantly read the inside flap and the quotes on the back. It was hard putting it down last night, so Herbie’s “Out of the Pocket” is a must for all college football fans.\n\nThe AP Top 25 preseason poll was released yesterday, and to no one’s surprise, Alabama was at the top. Three things I liked seeing: The Crimson Tide got a majority of first-place votes, but votes for the top team were spread out among five different teams. Nice to see Iowa State and Cincinnati ranked 7th and 8th. And perhaps best of all - two Sun Belt teams are ranked, which is amazing to me. Teams just outside the Top 25: Oklahoma State and Ole Miss.\n\nQuick moment on schedules - as I hope to have a bit more on it tomorrow - but it looks like two more games for Week Zero in less than two weeks. One of them a Division II matchup taking place in Columbus, OH and the other is I believe a NAIA matchup with newcomer, the North American Stallions taking on Louisiana College - a school that just dropped to NAIA.\n\nI can’t believe that it has been almost a week since my last entry - but because of commitments, I had to step away for a bit. Perhaps it has re-charged my battery. Nah - that will never be needed because my love for the game is very, very, strong. I must admit I have followed a story or two about people that have taken a part in making the game the way that it is today.\n\nBecause I can never get enough Lee Corso stories, I was very excited to see that Kirk Herbstreit has written a book that is going on sale tomorrow. Of course - I couldn’t wait, I had to pre-order, Reading the excerpt on ESPN made me laugh, made me cry, and then laugh again many times over. I love listening to Kirk, so I look forward to the book. College GameDay won’t be the same again.\n\nThe Preseason Coaches Poll is out, and there are no surprises with the Top Five. What is surprising is that Alabama received 63 of 65 votes for first place - while Oklahoma got the other two. In another bit of bad news for teams hoping to get to the top - three of the four top teams will have a new starting quarterback.\n\nToday I read a piece on the Athletic about planning weddings in the fall - and how it can cause issues for the wedding party and the wedding guests. Thirty-two years ago, my wife and I got married on October 14th, and I have to confess - I never even thought of the college games played on that day. Of course that would never happen again. And if I am invited to a fall wedding, my eyes will be glued to either my phone or a television, but not during the wedding ceremony.\n\nLooking back at 10/14/89 again in regards to college football: The three top teams on that day were Notre Dame, Miami, and Colorado. There were two Top-25 matchups: (1) Notre Dame at (17) Air Force and (5) Michigan at (21) Michigan State. Best game of the week: Texas vs. Oklahoma. And since Conference realignment has been a big topic the last week or two - back in 1989 we still had the Big 8 and SWC…\n\nAs I read on ESPN about what Coach Bowden wanted to do as the head coach of West Virginia for Marshall after their tragic plane crash in 1970, it got me to thinking that someone needs to get the West Virginia-Marshall game going again. The series got started in 1911, and was played every year from 2006 thru 2012, but those were the last games. Not sure why the two Division I teams from West Virginia can’t get together…\n\nWhen Hawaii and Wyoming reunited in the Mountain West Conference in 2012, they had to do it with a new Paniolo Trophy. The original trophy had gone missing in the late 90s while in the possession of the Cowboys - perhaps it was sent to a repair shop to get fixed, and lost from there. Seems to me that the trophy doesn’t have too much meaning to one team in this rivalry…\n\nI can’t believe that I just remembered this evening that I have a subscription to BTN+ that I got last year, along with Flo Football - which carries CAA football. Something I discovered is that you can go back to 2015 and re-watch every Big Ten game that’s been played since then! I have found myself checking out Indiana/Purdue games - and I particularly liked listening to Tom Allen in the locker room before the 2019 game. Unfortunately, the network doesn’t go back to 2011 - the last time Michigan beat Ohio State. :(\n\nA new project has been on my plate for a while, which has left me short of time to prepare something exciting about rivalries and/or trophy games. But my love of the game has helped keep my sanity during these crazy times. Every day I am looking at numerous websites looking for any nugget of news that will make me smile or even tear up - which has happened on more than one occasion. And of course I am on this website every day looking at the number of people who have taken the time to check out something that I have posted on this site the last five years.\n\nThe other day I met and talked to a new neighbor, who I found out was a head coach and athletic director at Elmhurst College - a small college in Illinois. As we got deeper into his time there, he talked about hiring a coach who brought the team to the Division III playoffs for the first time in 32 years! That coach….Tim Lester - the current coach of Western Michigan. Before finishing my walk with the dog, I turned to Paul and said “Elmhurst plays in the CCIW right?” And he nodded. Then I said, “And their nickname is the Blue Jays?”. He nodded again and smiled. I hope it is the first of many conversations we have - both about football and about life!\n\nOff of rivalries again today (sorry!) because of limited time - so I will try to touch on three things quickly. Starting with Nick Saban’s new contract! If all goes according to plan, Saban will be the first head coach in college football history to earn $10 million or more a year. Also - if he stays the length of his contract (which I don’t think is likely), Saban will probably reach 350 NCAA recognized wins - which will be good for fifth all-time in all of college football behind Bobby Bowden. I am betting on him reaching 10 National Championships before he’s done though!\n\nQuinn Ewers enrolling at Ohio State this year has gotten a lot of press. He may redshirt, but don’t be surprised if he is pushing the other Buckeye quarterbacks (C.J. Stroud, Jack Miller, and Kyle McCord) for some playing time this fall. Ryan Day is going to have his hands full with his quarterback room - as he might lose one or two sooner than later. A big test for this upcoming coach.\n\nESPN’s piece on College Football’s best traditions, mascots, rivalries, and more was a fantastic piece. Hearing ESPN writers talk about what they love most gave me goosebumps thinking about the game! Realignment is coming, but it’s nothing new because it has happened for over 100 years, and the game continues to grow. Some rivalries and tradition might be lost, but we will see the rebirth of a couple and maybe the start of another one or two. The important thing to remember is that there are over 600 college football programs across three divisions, and many, many rivalries and traditions that won’t be affected by this change! Sit back and either read or watch the games this fall with nothing but pure joy in your heart and a blood-curdling scream for your significant other (or neighbors) to hear when your team either wins or loses…\n\nFlorida - Florida State: This rivalry was at its pinnacle in the 1990s, but the seeds for this in-state battle began decades before their first game in 1958. Florida State College in Tallahassee first played football in the early 1900s, and was considered the best team in the state, but the school was turned into an all-women’s college. So that was the end of football at FSC for the time being. The head coach, Jack Forsythe, moved on to become the head coach of the new program at the University of the State of Florida, and several of his former players followed him to Gainesville. Eventually, Florida State would become coed in 1947, and the two schools clashed for the first time in 1958.\n\nClemson - South Carolina: One of the great in-state rivalries, this Battle for the Palmetto State began in 1896, and had been played every year since 1909 until last year. The string of playing 111 straight years (2nd longest streak in the FBS - behind Minnesota/Wisconsin), is now off the books as a “current streak”. This is one game that I look forward to seeing again in 2021! The Tigers have won six straight, and lead the all-time series with the Gamecocks 71-42-4.\n\nColorado - Utah: The name of this rivalry is enough to get this game mentioned in my blog: Rumble in the Rockies. The two teams first met in 1903, and were league rivals in the Mountain States Athletic Conference, until the Buffs left for the Big Eight in 1948. Between the two programs, they won a combined 27 conference championships. Unfortunately the rivalry was discontinued in 1962 for the better part of four decades, until both teams became conference rivals again in the Pac-12. After four straight Ute victories, the series is now knotted 32-32-3.\n\nBecause it is so late today (no time to play until now), I will skip the rivalry pieces, and talk about today’s big and not surprising news. Oklahoma and Texas were officially welcomed to join the SEC in 2025 (though I think it will be sooner), so the latest round of realignment begins. I am hoping that realignment is kept to a minimum, and maybe the remaining Big 12 teams get welcomed into the AAC. I know that there will be discussions about the Pac-12 or Big Ten taking a couple of teams, but frankly I hope they don’t. And if the Big 12 teams go to the AAC - maybe the Power 4 conferences could have a champion, and the Group of Five conferences have one as well. This will keep rivalries pretty much intact, except for the Bedlam Rivalry between OU and Oklahoma State. One can hope that they figure a way to keep the game going though - and if they don’t, there will be more than an offset with the return of Texas vs. A&M, the Longhorns vs. Arkansas, OU vs. Missouri and the possibility of OU vs. Arkansas developing into a good rivalry. For me, the less change the better so that we don’t have a major disruption of rivalries and traditions…\n\nUCLA - USC (Part Two): This rivalry is worth a couple of different entries. Originally mounted atop a Southern Pacific freight train, the 295-pound brass bell came to symbolize the rivalry — after a bit of chicanery. The UCLA Alumni Association had donated the bell to UCLA in 1939, and Bruin cheerleaders marked each UCLA point with a resounding clang. After two seasons, some USC fans had enough of the ringing so some members of a USC fraternity stole the bell and kept it hidden for more than a year. UCLA students retaliated by painting Tommy Trojan blue, and USC students struck back by burning their school’s initials into a lawn on UCLA’s campus. The USC president threatened to cancel the annual football game if any more mischief occurred. Then, in 1942, the student body presidents reached a deal: The winner of the football game would keep the bell for the rest of the year. Since that 1942 showdown — a 14-7 UCLA win — students from the victorious school have sandblasted and painted the bell’s carriage cardinal (43 times) or blue (32 times).\n\nCincinnati - Louisville: Although both schools are known more for an intense basketball rivalry, the University of Louisville and University of Cincinnati have a football rivalry that has stretched the span of three conferences. Since the first game in October 1929, a traveling trophy, known as the Keg of Nails, has been awarded to the winning team and it signifies that the winning team is “tough as nails.” Unfortunately the original keg was misplaced during construction at the University of Louisville, so the present trophy is a replica. After the Cardinals moved on to the ACC, the series became dormant because their are no games currently scheduled between the schools.\n\nFresno State - Cal Poly: For the first time in almost a decade, these former rivals will meet this year and next. The teams played almost every year after World War II, and introduced the Victory Bell as a trophy around 1956. Unfortunately, continual thefts were the cause of the trophy being retired twenty years later, and the rivalry itself came to a halt once the Bulldogs moved up the the FBS. Fresno State leads the all-time series 32-9-2, and they have won seven straight since their last loss in 1979.\n\nUCLA - USC: Speaking of Victory Bells, the one in this rivalry might be one of the most recognized trophies in all of college football, but it is also the least seen. The bell is only on display for the first three quarters of the game, and on the Monday following the game when it is delivered to the winning team. All other times of the year it is in a warehouse or in a vault - depending on which school possesses the prized trophy.\n\nBowling Green - Toledo: The Falcons’ first football game was against Toledo in 1919, but after a 63-0 Rocket win in 1935 triggered an on-field brawl and fan riot, the series was suspended for 13 years. When the teams resumed play in 1948, the story goes that players from the two teams smoked a six-foot peace pipe at halftime of the annual basketball game, and the Peace Pipe trophy was born. Apparently that spirit didn't last long, as the 1951 game brought about another brawl involving both teams and at least 100 fans. Toledo has won 10 of the last 11 meetings to take the all-time series lead 41-40-4\n\nBaylor - TCU: Like the Baylor/A&M series, this rivalry also got its start in 1899. These schools are two of the most prominent religious schools in Texas, so this game is one of many dubbed the “Holy War.” What’s most interesting about this evenly matched rivalry is the fact that TCU was located in Waco before relocating to Fort Worth in 1910, so for almost a dozen years it was a city rivalry. The Horned Frogs have won five of the last six meetings to take a 56-53-7 series lead.\n\nBaylor - Texas A&M: I’m not sure that a rivalry that hasn’t been played in ten years deserves to be a part of this, but I’m making an exception to this one - and probably many others in the next few days. These teams first met in 1899, and played almost every year until the Aggies left for the SEC. It is believed that the rivalry got its beginnings because A&M was an all-male college until 1911 and Baylor (90 miles away in Waco) happened to be the closest school at that time to admit women. The Aggies lead the all-time series 68-31-9, but currently there are no games scheduled between these two old rivals.\n\nThis morning I was reading a piece about how the author would rather have Notre Dame play Michigan State than Purdue. The Spartans versus the Fighting Irish is a good matchup on just mascots alone, but I lean on the in-state Boilermaker matchup a bit more even if it’s a bit less competitive. What’s funny is that Michigan wasn’t even mentioned, and that’s a game that qualifies for prime time. All three of these Big Ten teams are perfect opponents for Notre Dame, and they deserve to show up on the Irish’s schedule more often than ACC teams…\n\nWay behind my reading on theAthletic website because of the furor caused by Oklahoma and Texas. So far that I had to click on the “show more” button to see where I left off. The more I visit the site, the more I enjoy the content as the authors of the blogs are obviously very knowledgeable and experts on their topics.\n\nThe Athletic is loaded with pieces to read. I chose a blog about the MAC, where a dozen of players were asked questions ranging from favorite stadiums to toughest player they have faced to who they predict to win - without choosing their own team. The most interesting part was talking about mid-week games. Almost all liked the TV exposure, but some mentioned that they miss the weekend crowds, and others struggle with classwork. I enjoyed it very much.\n\nLastly, the biggest news - OU and Texas has contacted the SEC about membership, which has angered Texas A&M. As nice as it would be to see Texas renew hostilities with both A&M and Arkansas, I would like to see the Sooners and Longhorns in the Pac-12 South Division - and move Utah to the North. Then the Big 12 could bring in Houston and SMU - as well as maybe BYU and Boise State.\n\nA good read at collegefootballnews.com about potential Group of Five wins over Power 5 teams. The part that didn’t make sense to me, and it could be just my perspective on the piece, is how any win by a Group of Five team would be considered an upset. I can see that with expected close games between Nevada at Kansas State, Louisiana at Texas - and even Oklahoma State at Boise State. But if Cincinnati beats Indiana, and Coastal Carolina beats Kansas for the third time - those aren’t upsets. Neither would be a UCF win over Louisville.\n\nI’m not surprised that Bryce Young is going to make a lot of money via endorsements. I am surprised at how much already! This is great news for him and it’s great news for Alabama in terms of what potential recruits could earn while playing for the Crimson Tide. My hope though is that it doesn’t cause a division in the locker room - wouldn’t wish that on any team (except maybe the Buckeyes - LOL). Time will tell about NIL…\n\nInteresting to see that two ACC teams (Clemson and UNC) are supposedly against playoff expansion. I wonder if we will hear more about that - either from coaches or from the players. The more I noodle it, the more I like the idea of the college football playoff being more inclusive. You don’t hear from anyone that March Madness is too big - though I’m not big on the play-in games.\n\nI really enjoyed reading Adam Rittenberg’s piece on Nebraska football at ESPN.com yesterday. Hard to believe that it has been a decade since the Cornhuskers joined the Big Ten. It was also a reminder of how great a coach Tom Osborne was in Lincoln - as he had a record of 255-49-3 over 25 seasons. I for one, hope that Nebraska finds its way back to national prominence in the next few years.\n\nSeeing the mention of Joe Tiller’s name today made me realize how good of a coach he was - not only at Purdue but also at Wyoming. While the head coach of the Cowboys, he led his teams to a .500 or better record from 1993 thru 1996. In 1997, he moved on to West Lafayette to take over the reins of the Boilermakers. Prior to Tiller’s arrival, Purdue had only one winning season in sixteen years from 1981 thru 1996. In Joe’s twelve years at the helm, Purdue had nine winning seasons and ten bowl invites. That’s pretty damn impressive.\n\nIt took me until this evening to read Adam Wittenberg’s piece on ESPN.com where he ranked all 130 FBS head coaches based on their playing days. My guess was that Pat Fitzgerald would be the man at the top, but I forgot about the NFL career that Jim Harbaugh had with the Bears and the Colts. I couldn’t help but laugh when I read that Jedd Fisch hadn’t played football, but instead was an all-state tennis player.\n\nCharlotte offensive lineman Ty'Kieast Crawford has called the Hogs for a second time, pledging himself to the Razorbacks out of the transfer portal. Crawford committed to Arkansas and Chad Morris in April of 2019 but the commitment did not last. The tackle decommitted from Arkansas after the Hogs' lost to Kentucky on the road, a couple weeks before Morris was fired during the 2019 season. Maybe the second time will work while playing for Sam Pittman.\n\nIn fifteen years, Nick Saban has won almost 90% of his games as head coach of Alabama. His Crimson Tide teams have lost two conference games in a season only twice since 2010. The following years, Alabama won the National Championship. Excluding his time in the NFL, he has built winners at each of his collegiate stops, and I’m convinced that he could eventually have winners at any of the FBS schools - including UMess. He might already have the title “Greatest College football Coach”.\n\nSkimmed through PFF’s ranking of all 130 FBS quarterbacks, but I’m not sure I am in agreement. I will probably copy and paste it to a Word document and track it throughout the year. Who knows - I might be eating crow. A piece I enjoyed more this morning - CBS Sports ranking all 130 head coaches in regards to being on the Hot Seat. I think that they nailed it.\n\nSaw today that the “Battle for Greater Baltimore” has been extended through the 2027 season. This rivalry between Towson and Morgan State doesn’t resonate with FBS fans - or even the casual FCS fans, but it’s a game that has always held my attention. The reason or reasons being that the city has always meant something to me since I went to school at Maryland, and my roommate’s sister attended Towson - a few years back. LOL\n\nAnd sticking with the FCS for a moment…yesterday I talked about gathering series information for each game to be played this year in the division. The reason for this is so that I can give the division a bit of attention that it deserves with a weekly Games to Follow - much like I do for the FBS. Unfortunately, when trying to put together games for Week 2, I am struggling to find just 6 to 8 games that are more meaningful than the others - and just maybe a more thorough review of series records might just do the trick for me.\n\nI wish that there was a database like mcubed.net for FCS series record. This database gives me so much information about FBS opponents that will be meeting on the gridiron, that having the same for FCS teams would save me so much time. In the meantime if I want to put together a FCS Games to Follow each week, I need to create my own temporary database be visiting each school’s website and cross my fingers that they have a decent history on their opponents.\n\nColorado announced some additional games that they have scheduled. The Buffs will face former Big Eight opponent Oklahoma State for a home-and-home series in the distant future (2036 and 2037). They will also face SMU for the first time in another home-and-home series in 2030 and 2031. I do look forward to this matchup. And finally, Wyoming will cross the border and visit Folsom Field in 2025. This was a fairly regular matchup up through the 40s, but has been played only a handful of times since then - the most recent game being in 2009. I would like to see this game scheduled a bit more often…\n\nA quick moment about two SEC schools and their recruiting. Eliah Drinkwitz has done a great job with Mizzou and it’s showing in his recruiting. Not only does he have a firm grip on the St. Louis area, but he has received commitments from 4-star recruits in Georgia, Texas, and Nebraska. Meanwhile, Vanderbilt has picked up six commitments last week and now they have 15 recruits for 2022 from eight different states. If the Commodores keep this up, we might see a solid program playing in Nashville.\n\nSad to see that Terry Donahue passed away yesterday. I remember him as being so young on the sideline for the Bruins. I knew that he was the winningest coach for UCLA with 151 wins, but I didn’t realize that he has the most Pac-12 wins in history at 98! Lastly, I also didn’t know that he was the first person in Rose Bowl history to play, be an assistant coach and be a head coach. Impressive resume.\n\nThe deadline for entering the transfer portal and be eligible to play this fall has come and gone. In the SEC, three players entered the last few days - not including Dare Rosenthal out of LSU. Darel Middleton, who is leaving Tennessee, was a force on defense for the Vols, and his leaving is strictly because of a new coaching staff. Alabama linebacker King Mwikuta could be a force for someone, but he was just buried on the depth chart, while Missouri LB Gerald Nathan is just wanting to play more after limited action in 2018 and 2019 (took 2020 off).\n\nSaw someone’s thoughts and predictions about the twelve FBS teams in Texas. No surprise that Texas A&M was considered the top team in the group as they are a playoff hopeful this year. Seeing TCU ahead of Texas was interesting, but they are returning a ton of talent and Max Duggan is a solid quarterback - and the Horned Frogs seem to have the Longhorns number currently. Lastly, seeing SMU ahead of former SWC members Baylor, Texas Tech, and even Houston made me smile. Go Ponies!\n\nStarting with Transfer Portal news…two recent additions to the pool is good news for whoever lands them. Dare Rosenthal, who is 6’7’ and 325 lbs., started five games for LSU last year at left tackle. He was also suspended for two games - and is a rulebreaker. If he were to play up to his ability, Rosenthal would be an early-round draft pick. Baylor might be the lucky duck to receive his services. And linebacker Isaac Slade-Matautia is leaving Oregon after starting every game for them the last two years. In that time he had 107 tackles, 10 TFLs and 16 pass breakups. Seems like a stud to me - and McKenzie Milton (a fellow Hawaiian) has been rumored to be recruiting Slade-Matautia to FSU.\n\nSticking with FCS, something I haven’t seen on this level in regards to scheduling happened yesterday. Northern Arizona and Southern Utah announced a 12-game football series that is to start in 2028 and run through 2039. The two teams are both current members of the Big Sky Conference and compete annually in a matchup dubbed the Grand Canyon Rivalry, but the Thunderbirds are leaving the Big Sky for the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) beginning with the 2022 season. So there will be seven year gap in the rivalry because the Lumberjacks have filled their non-conference schedule thru 2027, but once it gets restarted the trophy will again be exchanged annually for years to come.\n\nTo win a national championship, a team must be able to recruit the top talent in their own state, as well as getting top recruits from other regions of the country. Then they must be able to develop that talent and survive the rigors and speed bumps of the season. Teams that are there: Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State and Oklahoma. Teams getting there: Georgia, Oregon, and Texas A&M. The Tigers at LSU are kind of a tweener between these two groups. USC is accumulating talent from California as well as the East Coast (Georgia), but do they have the coaching staff to develop these players? Penn State has owned Pennsylvania - but are Maryland and Rutgers fighting them off in their respective states? And are the Nittany Lion coaches getting the most out of their talent on the field? In a short time we will see if these teams are able to be mentioned the groups above - or will they need to undergo changes in the coaching staff…\n\nI can’t believe that an article at theanalyst.com was out eight days before I read it, but the piece on Taylor Heinicke’s game for Old Dominion against UNH in 2012 was a fantastic read. An amazing performance in an amazing game. Heinicke still holds the FCS record for most passing yards in a quarter (293), in a half (480) and in a game (730). Taylor is currently under contract with the Washington Football Team (how I wanted to write Redskins!).\n\nLate entries - so I might be a bit brief….247sports had a piece on the dangerous teams of 2021. I really liked their selections, and completely agree: TCU, Washington, Ole Miss and LSU. I would add to the list Miami because of their QB - if he’s healthy. And if Michigan beats the Huskies in Week 2, you might have to add the Wolverines Each of these teams are capable of damaging playoff hopes of higher-ranked teams.\n\nAfter leading the LIU Pioneers/Sharks for more than twenty years, Bryan Collins has retired as the coach of the Sharks after just one year full year in the FCS. Collins was tabbed as LIU's head coach in 1998, became the program's all-time winningest leader and for a while he was the school's athletics director. His teams posted 16 winning seasons and captured seven conference championships prior to the school's leap to the D-1 level. A big loss to the program.\n\nAs for Justin Fuente, things started off nicely for him in Blacksburg as he went 19-8 in his first two seasons. Since then he’s 19-18, and many players have been leaving the team, so the Hokies are bordering on mediocrity - which won’t be acceptable to the fans or the school. This year they get the Tar Heels straight out of the gates at Lane Stadium - where Carolina has won only twice since 2004. For Fuente, I believe that this crucial ACC clash is a possible do-or-die game for him to continue as the Hokie coach beyond 2021.\n\nFor a majority of years between 1983 and 2003, the Miami Hurricanes were a threat to win the National Championship. Since 2004 though, they have not had a season with less than three losses and they are still looking for their first ACC title. Now they are a dark horse candidate for a playoff spot in 2021. Can they prove the oddsmakers wrong and defeat the defending national champions in the spotlight of Atlanta on September 4th? History doesn’t favor the Hurricanes though as they lost to Clemson and North Carolina last year by a combined 61 points.\n\nSo far Stetson, out of the Pioneer Football League, is the last (or maybe we should say latest) to complete their Fall 2021 football schedule. The Hatters announced that they will play the Warner Royals on September 4th. In their most recent matchup in 2016, the Hatters defeated the Royals 30-15 to extend their unbeaten record in the series to 3-0. Warner is a NAIA team who plays in the Mid-South Conference, along with the Ave Maria Gyrenes (love the name!) - another Stetson opponent in 2021.\n\nI was reading this morning that the Holiday Bowl will be played at Petco field this year - the home of the San Diego Padres. One of the more enjoyable bowls for me, I have always associated it with BYU, as they played in eleven of the first sixteen games from 1978 to 1993. The biggest being the 1984 game against Michigan that gave them the disputed National Championship that year In 2021, the game will feature an ACC team versus the Pac-12.\n\nYesterday, Lehigh released their 2021 football schedule that culminates on November 20th with the 157th edition of The Rivalry with Lafayette. In addition to their conference schedule against their patriot League foes, the Mountain Hawks will play two CAA teams (Villanova and Richmond) and three Ivy League members (Penn, Princeton and Yale). Looking closer at their Ivy League opponents, Lehigh has played both the Quakers and Tigers 61 times, while they have lined up against Yale only 25 times. But when one looks closely at the history, all three series started between 1885 and 1890 - with Penn being the oldest of these. A bit of history there between these opponents.\n\nMike Farrell on Rivals.com listed his top 20 FBS coaches, with his top five being no surprise: Nick Saban, Dabo Swinney, Jimbo Fisher, Lincoln Riley, and Brian Kelly. Just on the outside is Ryan Day, who I feel will crack this list very shortly - though it’s tough to predict who he will displace. The question I have with Mike’s rankings: Why isn’t Pat Fitzgerald in the top 10? His case is that Fitzgerald is not a great recruiter, but he gets the most out of his talent and almost always exceeds expectations.\n\nI really enjoyed the piece on Greg Coleman and the newest inductees to the Black College Football Hall of Fame on ESPN.com. The list of new members was quite impressive: Winston Hill (New York Jets), Coy Bacon (Rams/Chargers/Redskins), Greg Coleman (Vikings), Jimmie Giles (Bucs), Roynell Young (Eagles) and Coach Willard Bailey. Seeing the accomplishments Coach Bailey certainly caught my attention. He has the most college football wins in the history of Virginia college football, but more importantly Bailey is the only coach in history to be a tenured professor at three universities simultaneously: St. Paul’s College, Virginia Union, and Norfolk State. Wow!\n\nI really like where the playoff is going, especially if the six best conference champions and then the best six teams remaining is agreed upon by the committee. The Pac-12 has been used as an example, as they would have missed last year’s playoff if there were twelve teams, but 2020 should have an asterisk because of the pandemic. Working out the details about how to incorporate the bowl games will be a big challenge - especially the biggest one of all, the Rose Bowl.\n\nThe height of the Clemson-Georgia rivalry in my eyes was from 1977 thru 1987 when nine of the eleven meetings were decided by seven points or less. The biggest game of that era was in 1982, when the defending national champion Tigers (ranked 11th!) took on the 7th-ranked Bulldogs on Labor Day. Georgia had won the 1980 national championship, so it was a meeting of the last two champions. But when these teams kickoff the season in Charlotte on September 4th, this game will be the biggest game they have played. For the first time, these schools will play each other while ranked in the top 5, and to top it all off - there are serious playoff implications for both the winner and the loser. Bring it on!\n\nHopefully I will be updating my longest tenured FBS head coaches to include all 130 head coaches, but will I be updating it again with a new coach for Arizona State? Allegations don’t look good for the Sun Devils an Herm Edwards, which is too bad because they were building something solid in Tempe. Will that effort all be for naught? And, if so, how soon will it take for players to jump off this potential sinking ship?\n\nEach decade has had certain teams dominate. Perhaps it’s because of the College Football Playoff that makes it more unpalatable for fans who follow teams outside the inner circle. Playoff expansion will help these fans a little bit - but I have to tell you, it probably won’t help in the long run. Take a look at the major players right now: Alabama, Clemson, Oho State and Oklahoma. They all have one thing in common - and it’s not just 5-star recruits getting them to the top: Great head coaches and coaching staff. They bring the talent in - and more importantly they develop it. Oregon, Georgia, and Florida may crash the party because they have really good coaches - but Michigan, USC, Texas and Florida State, you coaching staffs need to step it up because there is no excuse for you to be where you are now……outside in the cold.\n\nGlad to see another game added for Week Zero in 2022 - Wyoming at Illinois. What a great spotlight Week Zeroes are for teams! Earlier I felt bad for the Illinois vs. Nebraska getting moved from Ireland to Champaign, IL - but now that I think about it, how wonderful for the Fighting Illini! They will now get to host the first college football game and the first “full capacity” game in twenty months. What a way for Bret Bielema to start his coaching career at Illinois.\n\nTwo charter members of the WAC in 1962, Arizona and BYU will face off in Las Vegas for the second time (2008 Las Vegas Bowl) on September 4th this year. This will be the fifth time in the last sixteen years that they have kicked off the season against each other. The Wildcats lead the all-time series 12-11-1 but the Cougars have won three of the last four. The two have a home-and-home series scheduled for 2026/27.\n\nSpending some time on the Athletic website…it was interesting to read that Ohio State would be the only team to qualify for a twelve-team field the first seven years of the playoff - a streak I am sure that they will continue for a few years. The expansion will be good for Penn State, Georgia - and maybe eventually Michigan, USC and Texas, but they have a ways to go before getting there.\n\nI was also reading how there is a call to have ESPN GameDay be a little less focused on expected playoff teams and bring more attention to other games to keep all fanbases tuned in to the show. I love the concept, because what is best about being a fan of this wonderful sport and keeps me focused on the sport 365 days a year is the attempt find a story or tidbit on every game being played no matter the level or importance.\n\nSpeaking of bringing attention to a game……Appalachian State vs. East Carolina in Charlotte on the first Thursday of the season - September 2nd. This will be the 32nd meeting between the two teams since the series started in 1932, but only the third meeting since 1979. The peak of the series was from 1948 thru 1979 when they met 23 times. Lastly, the Mountaineers lead the series 19-12, but the Pirates have won the last six games.\n\n247 sports came out with the ten most hostile environments for visiting teams this fall. The SEC had the most hostile (Tiger Stadium at LSU) and three of the top four (Kyle Field at College Station and Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville) The Big Ten got some stadiums listed as well - with Beaver Stadium coming in number two (Ohio Stadium and Camp Randall the other two). And the longest name for a stadium made it at #10 - Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium in Norman, OK.\n\nI have been waiting many months for the NESCAC football schedule for this fall to be posted - and when I visited the site today it was there. A huge smile appeared on my face as I realized that yes, there would be a Fall 2021 season! To make things even better - Bowdoin will have five home games, but I’m guessing that they won’t be favored in one of them. That’s alright, I just want to get back to Whittier Field!\n\nSticking with 50 - ESPN has a piece out today talking about the top 50 receivers from the last 50 years. A very impressive list - but I must admit, I scrolled through it pretty quickly because I wanted to get to the #1 receiver. No surprise that it was Randy Moss. There was also one player that I got to see play in person while at Maryland: Michael Irvin (1985 in Baltimore).\n\nAs one who loves trophy and named rivalry games, I have to say that Week 2 (9/11) has its fair share of these games. The first week has only three of them (two are FCS), but the following week has twelve between the two divisions. Headlining them all is Air Force at Navy on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 for the first leg of the Commander-In-Chief’s Trophy.\n\nA Week Zero game that should not be overlooked: Alcorn State at North Carolina A&T. Two HBCU programs that have had a lot of recent success, as well as two teams that have a lot to prove this fall after taking the 2020 season off. The Aggies are playing in a new conference (Big South), while the Braves will probably have a chip on their shoulder after the way they were treated by the SWAC this spring.\n\nThree quick notes regarding football news out of the northwest: 1) Eastern Washington football will not be cut for budget purposes, so the red carpet at Roos Field will continue to be used. 2) Oregon State announced that they will host Montana State in 2022 at Providence Park in Portland. It will be the first meeting between the schools, which is surprising since the Beavers have played Montana 16 times. 3) Lastly, other news for the Beavers - ex-Colorado quarterback Sam Noyer has declared his intention to play in Corvallis this year. Noyer is from Beaverton, Oregon.\n\nChris Hummer on 247sports.com has run 12 team playoff scenarios from 2014 thru 2020. What’s interesting is the Big Ten would have received more bids than the SEC. Also, the Pac-12 was the only Power 5 Conference to be excluded in any of the playoffs, courtesy of Oregon upsetting USC in 2020. Lastly, for Group of Five conferences, the AAC had five bids (with four different teams), which surprised me, as I thought Boise State would have made playoff more than once. A nice read!\n\nCan’t help but find a lot of articles today about the proposal put forward by the CFB playoff working group. A lot of different perspectives, thoughts and opinions. It wasn’t long ago that I was a proponent of an eight team playoff, but I have grown to like the twelve team model - especially if the first round of games is held on campus. Three things that I wonder about this current proposal: Notre Dame is unable to get a first round bye - so will this be amended (ranked 4th or higher), or will it push them to join a conference. How will the kids hold up playing more games (up to 17). And lastly, how detrimental will it be to the bowl system overall - and will it make New Year’s bowls better.\n\nYesterday, fbschedules.com reported some good news. The Big Sky Conference reached a deal with ESPN where all their games will be streamed on ESPN+, but two games will also be televised on ESPNU. It will be fun to follow the Big Sky via ESPN+. The website also had a piece on FBS head coaches that will play their alma mater this year. The number is fifteen, but what I like most is that three of them were also a head coach at one time for their alma mater: Bill Clark (UAB/Jacksonville State), Karl Dorrell (Colorado/UCLA), and Willie Taggart (Florida Atlantic/Western Kentucky).\n\nPutting together my Week 1 Games to Follow piece (under Best Games 2021), it made me realize how special the start of the season (not taking anything away from Week Zero) will be starting on Wednesday with UAB vs. Jacksonville State in Montgomery, AL. There should be five ranked vs. ranked games headlined by Clemson vs. Georgia, but two will be conference matchups (Indiana at Iowa and Penn State at Wisconsin). In addition you have Miami (Ohio) playing Cincinnati for the 125th time, two great first-ever meetings (Boise State/UCF, LSU/UCLA - beautiful setting and sharp uniforms) - and lets not forget about a big Group of Five/Power 5 matchup in Austin! And, I haven’t yet brought up defending champ Alabama going up against Miami. Throw in Stanford vs. K-State and West Virginia at Maryland - and you have an exciting week!\n\nRead a Group of Five mailbag this morning on theathletic.com, and enjoyed each question and answer. Got me even more excited about the Mountain West and how open the race will be for the conference championship. The top teams (Boise State, Nevada, San Jose State, and Wyoming) are all bringing back a ton of experience - plus Hawaii and Air Force should be solid. I am also looking forward to the MACtion in November! Not the best Group of Five conference, but each year it seems like almost all the teams can win the conference. After all, ten different teams have played in the MAC title game the last six years.\n\nInteresting to read the rivals.com Sting Factor for recruits decommitting - which is happening with official visits now taking place again. Georgia has had two significant recruits back out (Deyon Bouie and Keithian “Bear” Alexander), and Florida State has now felt the effect as local product Gabriel Harris has backed off his pledge. The Bulldogs’ recruits are now looking at all the options after both visited College Station - another SEC threat to Athens. As for Harris, the “sting” for the Seminoles is the possibility of losing someone in their own backyard - which is an indication that the product on the field is less than desirable.\n\nMore than thirty years ago, I was watching some great ACC basketball games from the student section of Cole Field House. Visiting it years later when the facility was no longer in use still brought chills as I recalled the brilliance of Len Bias. Now it’s called the Jones-Hill House, named after Billy Jones and Darryl Hill who were the first two black men to integrate football and basketball at the school, and it’s the new home of Maryland football. The price tag of this conversion: $149 million. It’s quite impressive - and I can only hope that it attracts major recruits to the school so the Terps can compete in the Big Ten.\n\nHero Sports writer Sam Herder took a crack at predicting each FCS conference champion for the upcoming season. Hard to argue with his choices, but I’m not sure that Princeton will win the Ivy League - and I like his choice of VMI in the Southern Conference, but I’m thinking that they won’t repeat this fall. All kinds of changes with the addition of the one year merger of the WAC and Atlantic Sun (strong teams), and North Carolina A&T to the Big South. What might be the most interesting conference to follow is the SWAC. Alcorn State’s return (revenge tour?), another year of Deion at Jackson State, and the addition of Florida A&M and Bethune-Cookman. It’s going to be a fun season!\n\nIt looks like this month is going to be big in regards to 2022 recruiting. As kids get out and visit schools, I think that we will see kids that have committed, reconsidering their choices and perhaps going elsewhere. And probably the rich will keep getting richer. The sooner the CFB playoff gets expanded the better since recruits understandably want to go where they have a chance to compete for a national championship.\n\nSpent some time on theathletic.com website reading a couple of recent entries - both have ties to the old Southwest Conference. The first piece I read talked about the quarterback situation at Texas, Texas A&M, and SMU - teams that lost their starting quarterback. The Aggies might be turning to freshman Haynes King, while the other schools like their freshman, but might go with more experience at the position to start the year. The other article of interest talked about Arkansas, and how it would be better for the fans if the Razorbacks were in the Big 12. Better rivalries (hatred with the Longhorns), reasonable road trips to games, and likely more wins. Can we unwind things a bit and bring back the SWC and Big Eight?\n\nIt’s not official yet, but Stetson will shortly announce that they have hired Brian Young, a former longtime assistant coach for the Hatters, to replace Roger Hughes - who left coaching to become president at his alma mater, Doane University. This should bring an end to the coaching carousel of 2020-2021 for all of Division I. It all started on Labor Day of last year when Jay Hopson left Southern Miss and has continued for the last nine months with Kansas and Stetson finding their new coaches.\n\nWhile it took the head coaching ranks nine months to finish before the start of the 2021 season, there is still one 2021 recruit that hasn’t made a decision as to where he will play this fall. Ironically, it is the year’s No. 1 recruit J.T. Tuimoloau. He had his first official visit at Washington a couple of days ago (45 months after their offer), and will continue with USC, Ohio State, Oregon and lastly Alabama. The Buckeyes have been the leader for his services right along - but the certainty of it has dropped a bit. Can Saban steal him - or do the Ducks have what it takes to keep him in the Northwest?\n\nOn Friday I finished updating my spreadsheet that gives All-Time Team records for all teams, all divisions. When I first started this spreadsheet, I would take the all-time records listed on each team’s website - if they published it. Over time, I have found myself digging through records kept by the NCAA, so to make sure I have an apple-to-apple comparison whenever with using NCAA records, I have decided to use their All-Time Records by Team. A lot of data I can use in the coming months…\n\nWith bedtime hour approaching fast tonight - one entry, and two words: Dump Truck. Cain Madden, the grad-transfer guard, who was a one-time walk on, from Marshall with the illustrative nickname, is expected to choose Notre Dame to play his final collegiate season in 2021. How exciting for him to end his college career playing at South Bend! I remember seeing him for the first time against Eastern Kentucky last fall, and I knew he was good, but moving on to the Irish in 2021 is special. Is the NFL next in 2022?\n\nCaught a glimpse of projected wins for FBS teams this fall from DraftKings. Eight teams are predicted to win ten or more games: Alabama (11.5), Clemson (11.5), Ohio State (11), Oklahoma (11), Georgia (10.5), North Carolina (10), Cincinnati (10), and Coastal Carolina (10). Am surprised to see North Carolina on this list, and would expect Louisiana to be on the list. The Power 5 teams with the least amount of wins projected: Kansas (1), Arizona (2.5), Syracuse (3) and Vanderbilt (3).\n\nWith Ohio State expected to win eleven games, people must not be very optimistic about the Wolverines beating the Buckeyes in Ann Arbor on November 27th. That will make Jim Tressel very happy. When speaking at a charity event in Youngstown, OH, Tressel expressed his desire to see the Buckeyes take over the series lead against their rivals from the state up north. With the way the series has been going these last few years, he might get his wish by 2028.\n\nIn the “Never Too Early” category, I have already looked ahead to the Week Zero schedule in 2022. Going out just a bit further, I came across some very exciting games for the first couple of weeks that fall: Notre Dame at Ohio State (9/3), Oregon vs. Georgia in Atlanta (9/3), and Alabama at Texas (9/10). Might have to start posting the schedule for 2022 (at least September) on this site…\n\nI have been working on my Week 1 schedule making adjustments to games that have moved forward to either Thursday or Friday, as well as starting to give brief details about each FBS game (FCS later). In the three weeks since posting my last schedule, it appears as though nine games have changed dates - so we now have 25 games during the week, with one of them being on Wednesday.\n\nWith the move of Michigan State at Northwestern to Friday night, it provides a solid doubleheader on ESPN that night with two crucial conference games for the teams involved. First off you have UNC visiting Virginia Tech at Lane Stadium. The Tar Heels will be trying to establish themselves as a Top Ten team, while Justin Fuente will try to cool down his hot seat. Then we move on to Michigan State at Northwestern. The Spartans are predicted to finish near the bottom of their division, but a win in Evanston over the rebuilding Wildcats would go a long way in helping their season.\n\nThe passing of Frank Navarro initially caught my attention because the article mentioned that he was a former Ivy League head coach. Digging deeper there were a few more finds that I found very interesting. Navarro went to Maryland and was an offensive lineman on the Terps 1952 Sugar Bowl team. He also cut his teeth in head coach at Williams College (1963), eventually leading the Ephs to an unbeaten season in 1967. And Navarro was a head coach at two Ivy League schools - Columbia and Princeton. Lastly - the thing that I find most interesting is that I would have been a fourteen-year-old kid in the stands behind Princeton’s bench at Memorial Stadium in Hanover NH when he brought the Tigers to Dartmouth in September 1979.\n\nBoy, did things change quickly in one day (or should I say - 17 minutes) regarding the national championship picture. Folks were high on the Bulldogs to begin with, but now it seems to many that it’s national championship or bust for Smart at Georgia. Two big commitments yesterday from the transfer portal (Arik Gilbert and Derion Kendrick), and the game against Clemson is now going to be crucial for the group in Athens! Not only are these solid, if not great, players, but they (along with former West Virginia safety Tykee Smith) have filled the gaps in Georgia’s roster. The CFB playoff in 2021 is starting on September 4th this year.\n\nSeeing the recent exodus of Buffalo players (7 now?) heading west to Kansas this week has made for some interesting reads. First off - this is a significant hit to the Bulls as they try to hold off Miami (Ohio) in the MAC East this fall. There is no mention of the players on Buffalo’s website, but I’m thinking that they were expected to play significant time this season. At best, this is a big hit to their depth. As for Kansas, these players are just what the Jayhawks needed in terms of building back their depth, after all they have lost 26 players to the transfer portal this year! It also speaks volumes about the impact that Lance Leipold has had on his players - a culture that they would love to re-establish in Lawrence. Lastly, what a great opportunity for these kids to play at a Power 5 school, and compete against Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa State, and in-state rival Kansas State! I feel for the Bulls, but I am happier for the Jayhawks and these kids making the move.\n\nA bittersweet day, as today’s entry will not be college football related. First off I want to express my joy in spending a long weekend with all my immediate family - I enjoyed every minute of my time with them. Secondly, today would have been my Dad’s 91st birthday. Happy Birthday Dad - you are greatly missed! And lastly, congratulations to the Terp’s lacrosse team, who were on the wrong side of a one-goal game. It kept them from having a perfect season - but it was a special season nonetheless.\n\nI arrived home yesterday to find two college football preview magazines at my door: Lindy’s and Athlon sports. Always hard for me to find a place to start, as I am not a person who starts with page one in these magazines. I will pick them up probably a hundred times in the next few months and still not see the entire magazine.\n\nToday marks the day when potential recruits can make on campus visits. This is going to change the game for both coach and player. I am thinking that we are going to see some commitments flipped by coaches, who again can show their facilities - and there will also be kids who will benefit as coaches get to see them in person and put them thru drills. I see the contenders getting richer with recruiting getting back to normal.\n\nBall State is coming off a very successful season - one in which the Cardinals claimed their first conference championship since 1996, their first bowl win and their first ranked finish at No. 23 in the final AP poll. For a team that accomplished so much - there are even higher expectations this year, and their major goal is to retain the MAC title. With a target on their back for the first time in a long time, it will take more to win the conference again. But, they are returning 20 of 22 starters (ten on both sides of the ball), and a ton of experience as they have 16 returning seniors out of the 22 who were given the option of an extra year of eligibility by the NCAA because of the pandemic. It’s not going to be easy though - just like for San Jose State in the Mountain West. In fact, Athlon has predicted that they will lose 3 conference games and finishing second behind Toledo in the MAC West. Head coach Mike Neu will earn his money this year - and perhaps a new home in 2022…\n\nAnother game that I find intriguing is the Syracuse at Ohio game on Saturday, September 4th. This will be their first meeting in 100 years - as they last met in 1921. In their first two meetings, the Orange outscored the Bobcats 111-0 - so Ohio will be looking to score their first points against Syracuse. And, this was supposed to be a one game series, but it was amended to a home-and-home series that will conclude in the Carrier Dome in 2024.\n\nHave to hand it to future Buckeye quarterback Quinn Ewers, when he answered the question as to why all the high-rated prospects out of Texas were leaving the state. He candidly said that it was because Texas hasn’t competed for a national championship in years. In fact - no Texas team has sniffed the playoffs since 2014. Steve Sarkisian will have to change this trend for Texas schools if he wants the top talent to stay and commit to the Longhorns.\n\nFive days ago when talking briefly about FCS title contenders for 2021, it was mentioned that South Dakota State looks like they lost their two top quarterbacks for Fall season with knee injuries. Barring transfers and other injuries, the Jackrabbits are stacked at all the other positions - so they will be contenders no matter their quarterback situation. Luckily, a few days ago they landed a potential starting quarterback via the transfer portal. Chris Oladokun, a graduate transfer from Samford, has announced that he will be joining the Jackrabbits. In 2019, in which he started 8 games, Oladokun accounted for 26 touchdowns (18 passing and 8 rushing). Thing are looking up again for South Dakota State’s run for a title in ‘21.\n\nThe winner of the above mentioned rivalry game gets the Victory Bell - one of nine bells awarded between FBS teams. I went back and looked at the FBSchedules article detailing each of the different bell trophies, which is a very good read - in fact I have probably gone back and read it/referenced it at least five times already. Sadly as I scanned the different games, I noticed that only four of the nine will be played this year, and TWO of them (Georgia Tech - Vanderbilt and Nebraska - Missouri) have no future games scheduled. Not right!\n\nI have a feeling that I will be making quite a few entries in the coming days (maybe weeks or months - lol) talking about the television schedule for the upcoming season. This entry is regarding the Nebraska at Oklahoma game being played on 9/18. The Sooners AD expressed disappointment that the game will be broadcast at 12:00 on Fox (11:00 am local time). Frankly, as a fan, I like the noon start a lot better than primetime.\n\nOn another tv scheduling note, it has been confirmed that Nebraska at Illinois will be the first game on the Fall 2021 season, as they will kickoff the season at 1:00 on Fox. And before that game concludes, one can begin to view Hawaii at UCLA at 3:30 on ESPN. Watching a Big Ten matchup, and seeing the Bruins in Pasadena at the Rose Bowl is a great Week Zero!\n\nLooking forward to a few days break from my every day work to sit back and assess where things need to go with this site for the next few months. I have no doubt that there will be a tasty beverage or two that will help guide me in any decisions or directions that I might go - and I only hope that it’s not the wrong way.\n\nGlad to see that North Dakota State has gotten another chance to play at Autzen Stadium after their 2020 game against Oregon got canceled. In another couple of scheduling tidbits: UCF and Florida Atlantic have signed up for another home-and-home series after just completing one in 2019. The Owls are still looking for their first win over the Knights. And FCS rivals North Carolina A&T and NC Central take their hatred for each other to Charlotte in 2022 and 2027. That will be great for both programs.\n\nGreat article out there by Andrea Adelson regarding the upcoming roster management issues facing college football programs for the next couple of years with the NCAA granting an extra year of eligibility. And with all the players in the transfer portal, the high school kids are going to suffer because coaches will want “established” players. What burns my butt is the thought that coaches are out there convincing players to transfer to their program. The rich will only get richer as the Group of Five teams and FCS teams now become the minor leagues for the Power Five schools.\n\nHero Sports, which might be my new go-to website for FCS info, listed their ten favorite FCS teams to win the title - with Sam Houston leading the way as they are returning their key parts, including Jequez Ezzard, which surprised me. The Jackrabbits are next, but that worries me a bit because freshman quarterback Mark Gronowski appears to have torn an ACL in this spring’s title game. To make matters worse, his backup, J’Bore Gibbs, also suffered a knee injury and appears to be out of action this fall as well. My guess: North Dakota State.\n\nBryan Harsin, new to the Power Five coaching ranks, has been ranked by CBS Sports as being the 27th best Power Five coach out of 65 coaches - a pretty impressive feat without having coached a game for Auburn. But the most impressive thing I saw in this list was Kansas hire Lance Leipold being ranked 35th out of 65 - ahead of in-state rival Chris Klieman at Kansas State as well as new Texas coach Steve Sarkisian. How things actually transpire over the course of the season will be very interesting.\n\nThe first Thursday just got a little better as the Temple at Rutgers game got moved up to the 2nd of September. These teams first met on the gridiron in 1948 in Piscataway and have played 35 times overall. The Scarlet Knights have won four consecutive games in the series, including a 23-20 victory at home in 2013, which was their most recent matchup. Rutgers currently leads the overall series 20-15.\n\nThe first college football rivalry trophy/trophies for the Fall 2021 season will be handed out on August 28th. The rivalry is dubbed the “The Battle of I-10” and has two traveling prizes: (1). The Silver Spade – an old prospector’s shovel from an abandoned mine introduced in 1947 and upgraded to the current version in 1955 and (2). The Brass Spittoon (officially the Mayor’s Cup), which debuted in 1982 after a collaboration by the mayors of El Paso and Las Cruces.\n\nThis morning I came across an article that talked about the seven best first-time meetings coming up this fall. One that I hadn’t thought about is the Liberty at Ole Miss game - which feature two very interesting coaches, with the added feature being that Hugh Freeze coached the Rebels for five years before resigning. Add in two quarterbacks (Matt Corral and Malik Willis), who should get some Heisman votes and this should be a very exciting game.\n\nAnother day, another bunch of quality readings on the upcoming college football season - this time on the cbssports website. This site has more than I can mention in a few brief words, so it will suffice for me to just say “go to the site and enjoy the many articles”. Out of the three sites mentioned the last few days - I spent the most time on this site.\n\nFor a while now there has been a discussion about expanding the FBS playoffs. Ironically, I came across some information that I printed from the NCAA Record Book - and it detailed the expansion of the FCS playoffs, which also started at four teams in 1978. In 1981, it jumped to eight teams, but that format lasted for one year, before the playoffs expanded to 12 teams. By 1986, the playoff field included sixteen teams, and this figure lasted for I believe 24 years. In 2010, it was 20 teams, until finally reaching the current 24 teams in 2014. Here’s to hoping that the FBS gets to 12 teams…\n\nA couple of future schedule additions that I have to mention. It’s twelve years out, but Ohio State and Oregon have agreed to a home-and-home series in 2032 and 2033. I also say that the Buckeyes will pay the Ducks $3.5 million since last year’s game in Eugene was postponed. South Carolina also announced that they have scheduled two FCS opponents: South Carolina State and Wofford. In regards to the Wofford game, the Gamecocks and Terriers first met on the gridiron in 1895 and have played a total of 24 contests. In their most recent contest in 2017, the Gamecocks defeated the Terriers 31-10 and now lead the series 20-4.\n\nAs another summer approaches - it’s time to again rummage through my college t-shirts and see how many I have and if they are an accurate representation of the teams I like and the schools that loved ones have attended. Each time I do a count, it will probably be different, but today I am settling on 25 different t-shirts. My biggest representation is the Big Ten - with six different schools. Maryland leads the way of course, but i will admit that my Wisconsin t-shirt with a mean Bucky the Badger is my favorite. The next addition to my collection will have to be a Brown t-shirt, not because of the beautiful design and colors (lol), but because my dad attended Brown University (he was there while Joe Paterno was at the school).\n\nIn another bit of scoping around, I was reading about Scott Frost and how long his leash will be the next couple of years. What surprised me the most though was seeing that Nebraska hasn’t qualified for a bowl game since 2016! We are talking the Cornhuskers here - a team that always seemed to be in a New Year’s bowl for a period of twenty years from 1979 through 1999. They also played in a NCAA-record 35 straight bowl games from 1969 to 2003. Currently, 112 FBS teams have played in a bowl since Nebraska’s last appearance!\n\nI unintentionally (or to be truthful it was intentional) looked ahead to see how many games were to be played in Week Zero of 2022 after it was announced that Northwestern and Nebraska would play in Dublin, Ireland on August 27th, 2022. Here are the games in addition to Nebraska/Northwestern: Vanderbilt at Hawaii, Nevada at New Mexico State, Austin Peay at Western Kentucky and Duquesne at Florida State. I am sure there will be another added - especially a FCS matchup.\n\nI haven spent part of my morning combing over the first six weeks of the Fall 2021 FCS schedules, and there have been a few additions, both conference and non-conference, in the last few weeks. And, not all teams or conferences have announced their complete schedule yet. I should learn to wait for all games to be visible before putting together my schedule, but I just can’t help myself to jump in early. But I am waiting for all Division II and III teams to post before doing anything with all those games.\n\nThe long and winding road of a college football season has ended with a very exciting FCS Championship game won by a Sam Houston touchdown with sixteen seconds left in the game. Unfortunately for the Jackrabbits, starting quarterback Mark Gronowski was knocked out of the game in the first quarter. South Dakota State fought their way back from 17-7 fourth quarter deficit to take the lead 21-17 with a little more than five minutes to go, but the ensuring Bearkat drive won K. C. Keeler his second FCS Championship. I’m not sure if either team deserved to lose this one!\n\nAnd it’s not taking me long to look ahead to the Fall 2021 season that begins on August 28th. It’s only 104 days away (less than fifteen weeks) if my math is correct. And if my hunch is correct, he first game of the season will be Nebraska at Ilinois. The game was scheduled to be played at Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland, but the game will now be played at Illinois’ Memorial Stadium in Champaign. These teams last met during the 2020 season at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Neb. where the Fighting Illini defeated the Cornhuskers 41-23. Bring on the new season with fans back in the stands!\n\nOn Sunday, a first-time FCS champion will be crowned for the first time since North Dakota State won their first of eight titles in the 2011 season. After Appalachian State won the last of their three straight titles in 2007, there were three other first time winners before the Bison in 2011: Richmond (2008), Villanova (2009), and Eastern Washington (2010). This will be the Jackrabbits first championship game in any division and Sam Houston is hoping that the third time is a charm.\n\nAnother great storyline about the FCS Championship participants is the head coaches. South Dakota State head coach John Stieglmeier has a career record of 166-105 with the Jackrabbits since 1997, and his hoping for his first championship to go with with conference titles. While K. C. Keeler was voted by an ESPN panel as one of the 150 best all-time head coaches in college football. Since 1993, Keeler has won 233 games at three different schools (Rowan, Delaware, and Sam Houston). Two great coaches that are both well-liked in the profession.\n\nNo offense to the NFL games, but football got a lot more exciting when it was announced that the Egg Bowl between Ole Miss and Mississippi State will be played on Thanksgiving night for the next two years. Although I have always preferred the Texas-Texas A&M game after a big helping of turkey, the Egg Bowl game is also pretty special. These two teams from Mississippi have met 117 times in a series that goes back to 1901, with the Rebels leading the series 63-47-6.\n\nRecently I read an article about the MEAC looking to add schools to their conference - which is no surprise since they have lost four teams in the last few years. It appears as though the targets are Virginia State and Kentucky State - both currently in Division II. I believe that both schools have done feasibility studies, but are concerned that they would have to raise both athletic fees and enrollment. In reality, the MEAC could be in trouble.\n\nI was excited to see that lsufootball.ne"
