        "text": "By Justin Williams, Bruce Feldman, Brody Miller, Manny Navarro, Mitch Sherman and Chris Vannini\n\nNick Saban, widely regarded as the greatest college football coach of all time, announced his retirement last week.\n\nThe impact of a 50-year coaching career that featured seven national championships and numerous head coaching gigs ranges from the Mid-American Conference to the NFL. As college football reckons with Saban hanging it up, we took a trip through his back pages, including lessons learned and legacies left, from small-town West Virginia to the pinnacle of college football.\n\nMarion County, W.Va.\n\nSaban’s grease-stained fingerprints are all over the 300 square miles of Marion County. He was born in Fairmont — the county seat and “the city,” as he refers to it. But he grew up in the country, a nearby census-designated place dubbed Carolina, which was a no-stoplight mining town of about 500 people. The area football field is named for Saban’s father, Big Nick, who started the youth football league in the early 1960s. Big Nick also owned a service station down the hill in Worthington, along Route 19, where his son would pump gas, check oil and change tires.\n\nSaban went to Monongah High a couple of miles east, a small Class A school where his under-the-hood work ethic translated to the football field. He played quarterback and led the undefeated Lions to the 1968 state championship. He returned a decade later as an assistant coach at West Virginia University, about a half-hour northeast.\n\nBut those Marion County roots run deep. Saban’s wife, known as “Miss Terry,” was from the same area and became an indelible off-field partner.\n\nShe grew up Terry Constable from Fairmont — Queen Bee of the East Fairmont High Busy Bee Band and, as her now-husband claims, wouldn’t give a young Nick Saban the time of day.\n\nA couple of years back, Saban told a story about Miss Terry dating a guy named Mickey Shaffer. Once Shaffer was out of the picture, Saban was finally able to land a date. A few decades and national championships later, their small enclave of West Virginia held a homecoming celebration for Saban. And as fate (legend?) would have it, Shaffer was still living in town and now had a service station of his own.\n\n(Indeed, a Michael “Mick” Shaffer born in 1950, a year earlier than Saban, graduated from East Fairmont High and co-owned a hydraulics shop. He died in Dec. 2020.)\n\nAs Saban tells it, he used this visit to drive by Shaffer’s service station and remind Miss Terry that she made the right choice. See honey, if you would have stayed with him …\n\nTo which Miss Terry replied, “Bulls—. If I married him, he’d be the head coach at Alabama.” — Justin Williams\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nMandel: Kalen DeBoer is ideal replacement for Nick Saban facing near-impossible position\n\nKent, Ohio\n\nSaban had plans to attend the Naval Academy until Kent State coach Don James offered a scholarship. Saban arrived as a quarterback in the fall of 1969; that spring, he was on campus for the tragic shootings on May 4, 1970. During a rally opposing the Vietnam War expanding into Cambodia, the Ohio National Guard shot and killed four students and wounded nine others. Saban wrote in his autobiography that he had lunch with a friend on campus when the shootings occurred. They made their way toward the quad where the rally was held.\n\n“I could see people lying on the ground, all covered in blood,” Saban wrote. “My heart sank into my chest.”\n\nSaban was classmates with one of the students who was killed. He finished out the rest of his freshman year from home.\n\nIn December 1971, he married Miss Terry, also a student at Kent State. On the field, Saban moved to defensive back for three seasons, including the 1972 Golden Flashes’ MAC championship team. After his graduation the following spring, with Miss Terry still a year from graduating, James convinced Saban to stay on as a graduate assistant.\n\nOn Sept. 22, 1973, during the second game of the season, Saban’s father, Big Nick, died suddenly of a heart attack at age 46. The last time Saban spoke to his father, just before the season, he told him he wanted to pursue coaching. Saban later wrote about the last piece of advice his father gave him: “The expectation, no matter what you choose to do, must always be to do your best and to be the best.” — Williams\n\nToledo, Ohio\n\nSaban got his first head coaching job at Toledo before the 1990 season, leaving his role as defensive backs coach for the NFL’s Houston Oilers. The Rockets opened 6-0 before a 13-12 road loss to Central Michigan.\n\n“Saban wasn’t famous for being a defensive mastermind just yet, but I remember they ran that stunt 4-6 defense. His goal was to stop the run, and we beat them on two long touchdown passes,” said Jeff Bender, the starting quarterback for CMU. “Toledo had four field goals in that game if I recall, and with the wind, their kicker missed one in the final seconds.”\n\nBender, now a doctor in Bryan, Ohio, was inducted into the CMU athletics Hall of Fame in 2002. He didn’t realize he was the talisman for Saban’s first loss as a head coach — “First loss? Geesh.” Bender has followed Saban’s career and recently watched the NFL Films’ “A Football Life” documentary on Saban with his high-school-aged son, which featured a clip of Saban coaching at Toledo against CMU.\n\nBender, who also grew up and remains a Michigan fan, was begrudgingly pulling against Saban in what turned out to be his last game in the national semifinals.\n\n“The Rose Bowl, I was still rooting for Michigan, but I’ve always rooted for coach Saban because I played against him and he came out of the MAC,” he said.\n\nThat first loss for Saban back in 1990 proved to be significant. The Rockets finished 9-2 and shared the MAC championship with CMU, but because the Chippewas won the head-to-head, they received the invite to the California Raisin Bowl.\n\nThat was Saban’s lone year at Toledo. He resigned in February 1991 and took a job as defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns under head coach Bill Belichick. — Williams\n\nEast Lansing, Mich.\n\nGeorge Darlington remembers the Italian dressing that Terry Saban served.\n\nEarly in 1996, Nick Saban had recently completed his first season as the head coach at Michigan State, his first major college job. Nebraska stomped the Spartans 50-10 in the 1995 opener. After the season, Darlington, a longtime defensive assistant with the Huskers, traveled back to East Lansing to conduct a private clinic for the Michigan State defensive staff.\n\nWhen he finished his presentation, Darlington accepted Saban’s invitation to eat dinner at the coach’s home.\n\nSaban, 44 at the time, and Darlington, 56, discussed their shared roots in West Virginia. They talked about Nebraska’s practice regimen.\n\n“To my understanding,” Darlington said, “he adopted the way we used to practice.”\n\nBut it was the salad dressing that got him.\n\n“It was really tremendous,” he said.\n\nMiss Terry concocted the mix. Darlington asked her for the recipe.\n\nHe and the Sabans have not crossed paths since. But Darlington, now 84 and retired in Lincoln, always has that night — and the Italian dressing — to stoke his memory of Saban’s two games against Nebraska. The Huskers also defeated Michigan State 55-14 in the 1996 season, making them the only team Saban has coached against more than once and never defeated.\n\nThe Huskers gained 666 yards, including 552 rushing, against MSU in that first game in 1995. Afterward, Nebraska coach Tom Osborne famously told Saban, “You’re not as bad as you think.”\n\n“Tom was nice to him,” Darlington said. “Basically, he said, ‘Hang in there. You have a good team,’ which he did. And then Tom said, ‘We are awfully good.’”\n\nThe 1995 Huskers finished 12-0 and beat four top-10 teams by an average of 31 points during a second consecutive national championship season. — Mitch Sherman\n\nSaban took over a Michigan State program that hadn’t had a winning season since 1990 and was dealing with NCAA sanctions. But he knew what it took to win there, serving as defensive coordinator from 1983 to ’87, winning the Rose Bowl in that final season.\n\nMichigan State is where Saban developed his media skills, both for himself and to send a message to his team, fans or bosses. Saginaw Valley State athletic director John Lewandowski was a longtime Michigan State sports information director.\n\n“Early on, media was almost a necessary evil for him,” Lewandowski said. “Over time, he grew an appreciation for what it could mean for exposure for the program, how he could use media to portray aspects of his program.”\n\nSaban was always adamant about creating the complete infrastructure for a program. The coach played an integral role in the construction of the Clara Bell Smith athletics academic center, which opened in 1998 and still sits next to the MSU football operations building.\n\n“The environment he created, you walk into certain organizations and you feel the excellence,” Lewandowski said. “He pushed the right buttons. Different coaches and players respond in different ways. It was a gift for him to find a way to connect with a very diverse group.”\n\nSaban produced a winning regular season in each of his first three seasons. In year five, MSU went 9-2 in the regular season with wins against Notre Dame, Michigan and Ohio State for the first time since 1965. Despite MSU’s head-to-head win, Michigan finished one spot ahead in the BCS standings and was selected by the Orange Bowl. Saban was frustrated with being No. 2 in the state and also clashed with MSU administration over money. He often bypassed athletic director Merritt Norvell and dealt directly with president M. Peter McPherson.\n\nSaban met with LSU about its coaching vacancy late in 1999, and Saban and MSU couldn’t mend the relationship.\n\n“It was obvious Dr. McPherson didn’t have an appetite to get in a bidding war with (agent) Jimmy Sexton,” Lewandowski said. “Sure enough, he goes to LSU and wins a national championship.”\n\nFamously, Saban sent a plane to East Lansing for any assistant coaches who wanted to join him. None got on. That staff included coaches like defensive backs coach Mark Dantonio and graduate assistants Brian Daboll and Josh McDaniels. Student assistant Adam Gase eventually joined him in Baton Rouge. Lewandowski downplayed that, noting that Bobby Williams was promoted to head coach and retained most of the staff.\n\nCould Saban have won a national championship at MSU? Dantonio would prove 14 years later that the Spartans could get near the top of the sport with university alignment. Saban never quite found that in East Lansing.\n\n“I think he could have won a national championship with the right personnel at Michigan State,” Lewandowski said. “He was going to be successful wherever he went, as long as the institutional commitment was there.” — Chris Vannini\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nRecounting the final hours of Nick Saban as Alabama's coach\n\nBaton Rouge, La.\n\nIn 2000, Saban’s first season at LSU, the Tigers had gone 7-4 and earned their first bowl appearance in three years. A few weeks before the Peach Bowl, Saban was discussing the Tigers bowl schedule with LSU trainer Jack Marucci. The coach told Marucci that he wanted to practice around the team’s finals week.\n\nMarucci told his boss he didn’t love that idea, saying the players needed some time off to clear their minds. “To decompress,” he said. Marucci pointed out that before coming to LSU, he’d spent eight years at Florida State. Bobby Bowden did it that way, and they had won eight bowl games in a row.\n\n“I said, ‘Coach, with all due respect, you haven’t won a bowl game,’” Marucci said.\n\nSaban had lost his three bowl games at Michigan State, all blowout losses.\n\n“Yeah, Nick wasn’t crazy about that,” Marucci said.\n\nThe next day, Saban called Marucci and was much calmer. They reworked the bowl schedule.\n\n“The thing with Nick was, he might get mad at you, but if you had the data and the reasons why to back something up, he’d listen. But I was thinking, if we lose this bowl game, I’m done.’”\n\nFortunately for Marucci, LSU defeated Georgia Tech 28-14. — Bruce Feldman\n\nSaban arrived at LSU with something of a shrug from Baton Rouge. Most hadn’t heard of him. The big claim to fame was a nine-win season at Michigan State after going 34-24 in five years. Shoot. The Tigers had just fired a coach for going 32-24.\n\nLSU hadn’t won a title in 40 years. It had just two conference titles in 30 years. But what Saban understood was how to unlock the power of an uber-talented state with no other major schools to compete with. By year two, Saban led the Tigers to a surprise SEC title. By year four, they were national champs.\n\nYet to many within and around the program, like longtime LSU video coordinator Doug Aucoin, it’s Saban’s dry sense of humor they look back at most fondly. Aucoin and Saban would pass each other just about every morning in the LSU football ops hallways. Every time, without fail, Aucoin would say, “Good morning.” And every time, for months, Saban didn’t say a word back.\n\nThat rubbed the ever-polite Aucoin the wrong way. He would often tell co-workers, “Tomorrow, I’m not gonna say good morning!” But he couldn’t help himself and said it anyway.\n\nFinally, there came the day, whether from courage or shedding himself the responsibility, Aucoin walked by Saban without saying a word.\n\nSaban took about three steps past Aucoin, turned around and said: “What’s the matter, Doug? You can’t tell people good morning?” — Brody Miller\n\nMiami, Fla.\n\nChanning Crowder was the third player the Miami Dolphins drafted after Nick Saban took over as coach on Christmas Day 2004. Crowder, an All-American linebacker at Florida, started 13 games as a rookie and saw firsthand why Saban, then 53, was a better fit for the college game.\n\n“He’s undeniably the best college football coach of all time. But the NFL? I would say it was kind of an ego check,” said Crowder, who spent six seasons starting for the Dolphins. “He wasn’t ready to be called Nick because he still wanted to be coach Saban.”\n\nCrowder, now a radio and podcast host in Miami, said Saban was a great defensive mind, but there were many instances when he clashed with veteran players.\n\nThere’s the time Saban tried to force three-time Super Bowl champion Keith Traylor, a 35-year-old defensive tackle with bad knees, to run sprints in practice despite the fact he had a non-conditioning clause in his contract.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nMueller: Being Nick Saban’s GM was far from easy, but I'm forever grateful. Here's why\n\nAs Crowder tells it, Traylor followed his teammates to the line expecting Saban to wave him off. Saban just ignored him despite the fact Traylor shouted, “Hey Nick!” repeatedly. The coach finally yelled back, “Just run!” It sent Traylor off on a tirade.\n\nAnother time, Crowder said, linebacker Zach Thomas and Saban got into it in the middle of practice because Thomas kept changing the defense Saban called pre-snap. Saban wanted his offense to practice against a two-high safety look, but Thomas kept putting the defense in eight-man fronts to stop the run out of pride.\n\n“What Saban needed to do was pull these guys to the side and talk to them,” Crowder said. “But he didn’t want to be friends with those guys. He wanted to be a dictator that just tells his little peons what to do. It works at Alabama, LSU. He wins national championships. But in the league, his approach could not work with these established all-pro, hundred-million-dollar contract guys.”\n\nCrowder is convinced Saban would have been a Super Bowl winner had he been able to adjust.\n\n“Now, in his older age it seems like he’s trying to relate more with other human beings,” Crowder said. “But, I really believe, in his younger years of coaching, you weren’t Channing Crowder. You were weakside linebacker 1. You weren’t Daunte Culpepper. You were QB 1. He looked at you as a cog in the system.”\n\nThings might’ve been different, too, had the Dolphins opted to sign free agent quarterback Drew Brees instead of trading for Daunte Culpepper prior to the 2006 season. Whose call was it?\n\n“Knowing Saban and the dictator he is, I think it was Saban,” Crowder said. “I see the thought process. Revisionist history makes it the wrong decision. But if you think about it at the time, I can have an All-Pro quarterback with a knee injury (Culpepper) or a little bitty quarterback who was released coming off a shoulder injury (Brees). I’d have gone with Culpepper, too.”\n\nSaban went 15-17 in two seasons in Miami before taking the Alabama job. The Dolphins have had eight different head coaches since Saban’s departure for a 128-148 overall record and 0-4 playoff mark. — Manny Navarro\n\nTuscaloosa, Ala.\n\nThere is no scene or story from Saban’s 17 years at Alabama that could do justice to the enduring impact he’s had on the university, community, state and sport.\n\nTuscaloosa is where he became a folk hero, and the details and day-to-day movements of his life and profession gradually transformed into the trimmings of that mythology.\n\nSaban established a reputation for being superstitious and a creature of habit, a lovingly cantankerous perfectionist. The more titles he won, the more exaggerated those traits became. He’s talked about the lucky penny he receives from his daughter before every game. Former staffers claim that he would keep some of those coins in his pocket during the week and jingle them loudly as he walked the halls of the football offices, a helpful warning that the boss was making the rounds.\n\nIt was always about the details for Saban, and by extension, those who worked for him. Visitor parking on campus is always a challenge, particularly on football or basketball game days. So when football recruits and their families would take unofficial visits on game day, maybe there would be a recruiting staffer in a golf cart who just so happened to be pulling out of a convenient parking spot as a family arrived. And maybe that family would find their way into that golf cart as it made its way to the stadium or the arena.\n\nAlabama had plenty to sell recruits on under Saban’s leadership. The wins. The championships. The NFL Draft picks. Those undoubtedly mattered most. But it probably didn’t hurt when that sales pitch came with a parking spot right out front. — Williams\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWest Coast football in 2024: Optimism and concern for each former Pac-12 program\n\n(Photo of Nick Saban in 2004: Brian Bahr / Getty Images)"
