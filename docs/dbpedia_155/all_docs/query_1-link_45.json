        "text": "There are no players from Louisiana on Akron’s roster and no players from Ohio on UL’s roster.\n\nYet the ties that bind the Ragin’ Cajuns and the Zips, who meet Saturday night at Cajun Field, are plentiful — and it’s all because of the coaches.\n\nEx-Auburn and current Akron head coach Terry Bowden succeeded UL head coach Mark Hudspeth as head coach at NCAA Division II North Alabama in 2009, when Hudspeth left after a long stay with the Lions from 2002-08 to become wide receivers coach for two seasons at Mississippi State.\n\nHudspeth’s offensive coordinator at North Alabama was Alan “Tank” Arrington, who stayed with the Lions when Bowden arrived and followed him to Akron. Arrington was assistant head coach and offensive line coach for the Zips until December of 2013, when he tragically died in an automobile accident in his native Mississippi.\n\nHudspeth’s last North Alabama quarterback was A.J. Milwee, who stayed with Lions as a graduate assistant coach and now is offensive coordinator for Bowden at Akron.\n\n“I know what A.J.’s about,” Hudspeth said this week. “Not only was a great player; (he was) a very smart player, and obviously now it’s transcending over into coaching. … He’ll be a head coach one day.”\n\nA transfer to North Alabama after spending one season as Alabama as a preferred walk-on, Milwee 33-5 as UNA's QB from 2006-08.\n\nHe set all-time school records for career passing yards (8,436), completions (677), touchdown passes (73) and total offense yards (9,401).\n\n“Crazy stats. High numbers. He was a winner too,” Hudspeth said. “We won a lot of games with A.J. as our quarterback.\n\n“He’s a guy that studied the game. He was a coach on the field for me. We (were) always on the same wavelength, and he’s a guy you can count on to make the right decisions.”\n\nMilwee earned honorable mention All-America honors as a senior.\n\n“He didn’t make a lot of foolish mistakes,” said Hudspeth, whose Cajun’s beat Bowden’s Zips 35-30 at Akron in 2013.\n\n“He would throw the ball away when needed, but, boy, when needed he could pull a rabbit out of the hat too to make a great play and extend a drive or to get a touchdown to get you back in the game or to win the game.\n\n“We won a lot of games late with him,” the Cajun coach added. “I think the world of that guy and his family.”\n\nWhat impressed Hudspeth most about the small-but-mobile Milwee, he said, was that “he had that ‘it’ factor.”\n\n“When plays broke down, he could nothing into something,” Hudspeth said. “In the pocket, he could find you. Just great touch on the ball. Strong arm too. I’m a big A.J. Milwee fan.”\n\nHudspeth’s not so big of a fan, however, that he’s talking a lot with Milwee this week. In fact, they may not have talked at all.\n\nThat can, and must, wait.\n\nOnce they do chat again, however, stories may be swapped and insight likely will be shared as well. The two sides, after all, have no future games currently scheduled against each other.\n\n“After the game I’ll sure we’ll exchange a text or too,” Hudspeth said of the Akron coaches he knows, “then the week after the game maybe try to catch up and say … both sides … ‘What did you see when y’all were scouting us?’ We’ll probably exchange a couple of things.”"
