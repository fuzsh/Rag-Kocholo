        "text": "Turner Easterbrook didn't start for his high school football team, but he didn't let that stop him from landing a college scholarship.\n\nEasterbrook, the back-up quarterback at Greene County High School the last two seasons, recently signed with Division II North Alabama and will join the Lions this fall. It was the culmination of several years of hardship and disappointment for the Fruitdale, Ala., native, who refused to let circumstances keep him from achieving his athletic dreams.\n\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Easterbrook said. \"I've dreamed of playing college football since I was a kid, but things didn't really work out in high school. But I feel really blessed to have this opportunity.\"\n\nTo fully appreciate where Easterbrook is now, you have to understand from where he's come. His early life was far from typical and might even be described as tragic.\n\nThe long high school road\n\nEasterbrook was just eight years old when his younger brother, Jeremiah, was involved in a near-drowning accident that left him in a semi-coma. Jeremiah required around-the-clock care by his parents, meaning Turner couldn't break away to participate in youth sports and other extra-curricular activities.\n\nJeremiah died just before Turner's ninth-grade year, and Turner enrolled at UMS-Wright Preparatory School in Mobile, with plans to eventually play high school football for the Bulldogs.\n\nBut just before his sophomore season of 2008, Turner was hit in the back during practice, an injury his father, Brett Easterbrook, said was initially diagnosed as muscular in nature. Brett Easterbrook suspected something more was wrong and took his son to the emergency room after Turner passed out in the middle of the night due to pain.\n\n\"They X-rayed him and his back was broken in two places,\" Brett Easterbrook said. \"He went through the surgery fine, but then he got a staph infection, a bad one. This happened right before football season started, so he missed most of that first semester. He passed (his classes), but he had missed a lot of school, so we decided to hold him back. And I didn't think anything about it.\"\n\nThe Easterbrooks eventually learned that because Turner had repeated a grade in high school, his junior football season would be his last of eligibility according to the Alabama High School Athletic Association. There was no appeal process in place in Alabama, so the family began to look elsewhere for Turner to continue his high school career.\n\nBetsy Easterbrook, Turner's mother, gets her hair done in Leakesville, where the family owns a second home. The husband of Mrs. Easterbrook's hairdresser happened to be Bill Ricks, the athletic director at Greene County.\n\nBrett Easterbrook said Ricks told him that if Turner wanted to enroll at Greene County, Ricks would appeal to the Mississippi High School Activities Association to get his senior-year eligibility restored. Brett agreed and Ricks followed through on his promise to appeal, which the MHSAA granted.\n\nEasterbrook arrived at Greene County just before the 2009 season and got on the field only sparingly behind starting quarterback Mitchell Brown. Turner completed 5 of 14 passes for 43 yards with one interception. Brown graduated after that season, leaving Easterbrook to compete with fellow senior Tyler Summers.\n\nBut Easterbrook played even less as a senior, attempting only three passes (completing two) in mostly mop-up duty. Turner (6-3, 210) was a starter for the Wildcats in basketball and averaged 9.6 points and 4.7 rebounds as a senior. He started to wonder what might have been in football.\n\nThe real work begins\n\n\"I was very frustrated,\" Turner said. \"I felt like I deserved to play and had earned the right to play, but there was nothing I could do about it.\"\n\nStill, Turner and his father believed he could play college football, but the trouble was in convincing someone else of that. His luck changed when he was serving as an assistant coach at a youth football tournament in Leroy, Ala., and was throwing the football with players between games.\n\nAfter seeing Turner throw 50-yard bombs on the field, Johnny Mott -- a perfect stranger -- approached Brett Easterbrook and asked him where his son was playing college football. Brett explained that Turner wasn't playing anywhere, but he said Mott was adamant that Turner had a future at the next level.\n\nThrough Mott, the Easterbrooks eventually connected with David Morris, a former Ole Miss quarterback and Mobile native who now operates \"QB Country,\" a private coaching service that specializes in quarterbacks. Among those who have worked with Morris in the past are Alabama's AJ McCarron, 2011 Florida State signee Jacob Coker and Floridian Thomas Sirk, who verbally committed to Duke last month.\n\nMorris asked to see Easterbrook's game film, but his father explained that there wasn't any. Nevertheless, he agreed to pay for two sessions with Morris.\n\n\"(I told Morris) 'after two sessions, you tell me whether or not he has the potential to play college football,'\" Brett Easterbrook said. \"'I don't want to mislead him and have him work out for six months when you really don't think he has a chance.'\"\n\nIt was now January, and most schools had already finished their evaluation of 2011 recruits. Morris admits he was skeptical at first, but immediately saw potential in Easterbrook.\n\n\"The only way he could get a real look was for us to do a workout tape,\" Morris said. \"I had a guy out there film his workout, doing all the throws it takes to play at the major-college level and show what kind of feet he has. We kind of fixed some things and that's how he got some exposure. Teams starting thinking that maybe he was one of those guys who was just in unfortunate circumstances. And here he is.\"\n\nTurner Easterbrook said he also saw immediate dividends from working with Morris.\n\n\"He's a great teacher,\" Turner Easterbrook said. \"I learned more about playing quarterback in the four or five months I've been working with him than I have in my entire life. He really knows the concepts of the game, and about footwork and all the things you need to do to be a good quarterback.\"\n\nFinally, a college shot\n\nThe Easterbrooks made tapes that they sent out to 15-20 schools, but only a few responded. One of those was Florida State, which had signed fellow Morris pupil Coker and where Dameyune Craig -- a Prichard, Ala., native and former Auburn star -- is quarterbacks coach.\n\nCraig told Brett Easterbrook that while it was too late to get a scholarship, Turner Easterbrook would have a chance to walk on with the Seminoles this fall (Miami also offered him a chance to walk on). But because his fifth year of high school would not count on his transcript, Turner's high school GPA fell below the 3.0 required to enter FSU as an out-of-state student.\n\nThe Easterbrooks began looking for another place for Turner to land. Soon, Brett Easterbrook got a phone call from North Alabama coach Terry Bowden. Craig had called Bowden -- his old Auburn coach -- on Easterbrook's behalf, and Bowden invited Turner up to visit campus in late May and work out for Lions coaches.\n\n\"When he got up there, he fell in love with the school and the area,\" Brett Easterbrook said. \"He offered him a scholarship and he took it on the spot. He didn't wait; he accepted it then.\n\n\"Terry Bowden told me that Turner looked exactly like (former Kentucky star) Tim Couch when he came out of high school. He told me Turner would be a multi-year starter at North Alabama.\"\n\nEasterbrook signed a few days later with North Alabama, a long-time Division II power that will soon begin the transition to Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA). Morris said that despite Easterbrook's inexperience, Bowden's declaration of his potential was not mere recruiting hyperbole.\n\n\"He can make pretty much every throw on the field,\" Morris said. \"He has some things to work on, but his upside is tremendous. I think he's definitely going to need a redshirt year, where he can really learn more about the speed of the game. But he's got to where he's got good feet and he's strong and accurate naturally. That's the thing you want in a quarterback, is accuracy. There's a lot of guys out there who can throw it far and hard, but he can place it.\"\n\nTurner left Sunday for Florence, Ala., and is set to begin classes today and begin participating in summer workouts with his new teammates. The Lions return senior starter Lee Chapple, who threw for 3,051 yards and 21 touchdowns in 2010, but otherwise are inexperienced at quarterback.\n\nUNA coaches have told Easterbrook that he will redshirt in 2011, but will be given an opportunity to win the quarterback job in the spring. Considering that he had no football future just six months ago, Easterbrook said he's filled with optimism these days.\n\n\"This is the best opportunity I've had in my life, sports-wise and school-wise,\" Easterbrook said. \"I'm excited about it and feel blessed with it.\""
