        "text": "For the past 10 years or so, as a sports broadcaster and columnist covering Division I college football,\n\nTerry Bowden\n\nwas an unabashed proponent of a playoff.\n\n\"I'd been to four playoffs before, twice (as head coach at) Salem and twice at Samford,\" said Bowden, the head coach at Auburn from 1993-1998.\n\n\"I know it can be done.\"\n\nBut being for a playoff is one thing.\n\nSaturday, Bowden, in his first season back on the football field as head coach at North Alabama, actually gets the chance to participate in one again.\n\nBowden's No. 5-ranked North Alabama Lions (10-1) begin play in the NCAA Division II College Football Playoffs against No. 23 Arkansas Tech (9-2) at Florence's Braly Municipal Stadium.\n\nThe college football playoff debate rages at the only level in the country that doesn't have a playoff -- the biggest and most profitable level of them all, Division I.\n\nNorth Alabama lost its final regular season game 31-28 to West Alabama (in four overtimes). Bowden knows that losing one game at the Division I level can be enough to knock a team out of the national championship picture. He also knows winning every game is no guarantee of playing for a Division I national championship.\n\nBut since he coached in the Southeastern Conference, winning one divisional title and at one time winning 20 consecutive games while Auburn was on probation, I wondered how it felt for Bowden to realize, once again, that his team could lose a game and still be very much in contention for a national championship.\n\n\"It's amazing, just what it does, how it changes your thinking,\" Bowden said. \"We were 10-0, No. 1 in the country, with a chance to go undefeated, and we lost to West Alabama (a team the Lions would play next week if both win this weekend). It was devastating to me. I know how hard it is to go undefeated, and I wanted it so bad for my players.\n\n\"But the next day we go to a pairings party, and we're still a No. 1 seed in our region. We still got a first-round bye. We still have home field advantage. It's exactly the same as if we'd gone 11-0. And you begin to understand the attitude of the NFL coaches, who see the most important thing is just getting there.\"\n\nImagine Alabama or Florida or even Texas being able to rest its best players this week, knowing that even if they did lose, it wouldn't matter. Imagine what it would be like to be at TCU or Cincinnati or Boise State and know an undefeated season could be rewarded with a chance to play for it all despite not being one of the top two teams in the national polls.\n\nBut you know the story. The best and the brightest of college football can't agree on anything other than keeping the economic status quo -- and that includes Boise State and TCU, whose conferences had a chance to back an SEC-ACC proposal for a \"Plus One\" playoff in the spring of 2008 but voted against it, which is why it's tough to have much sympathy for the Mountain West and Western Athletic Conference now.\n\nThat discussion doesn't concern Bowden anymore right now.\n\nUnlike the high profile coaches in Division I, the ones with the multi-million dollar contracts and the even bigger TV deal, he's got a playoff game to get ready for."
