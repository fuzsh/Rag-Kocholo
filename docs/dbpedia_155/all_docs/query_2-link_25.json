ULM head coach Terry Bowden, defensive lineman Adin Huntington and quarterback Jiya Wright will participate in the West Division Media Session 1, with the team's formal press conference on the main stage, beginning at 11:30 a.m. CT.\n\nTo enhance your viewing experience, download the ULM Football | 2023 Sun Belt Media Days Notes packet (top preseason storylines, personnel breakdown, numerical and alphabetical rosters, preseason depth chart and 2022 final statistics).\n\nTOP PRESEASON STORYLINES –\n\n• Heading into his third season as ULM head coach, Terry Bowden has overhauled his 2023 roster, adding 45 scholarship newcomers (26 defense, 19 offense). The Warhawks are one of four NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision programs that have added 40 or more scholarship newcomers for the upcoming season, joining Colorado (68), Colorado State (47) and fellow Sun Belt Conference member Old Dominion (40).\n\n• Following the 2022 campaign, Terry Bowden and his coaching staff made a commitment to upgrade the explosiveness and athleticism on the 2023 roster. An examination of the Iron Hawk summer test results provides a strong indication that major strides have been made in those areas.\n\nThe Iron Hawk program provides an overall score based upon the results of nine different tests (for example: clean, squat, bench, Pro Agility, Flying 10, L drill, broad jump and vertical jump). Prior to the start of the 2022 season, a total of 15 players scored 85 percent or higher. Heading into the final week of the Iron Hawk summer program, that total has grown to 23 players, with two more within striking distance to join that exclusive list.\n\nULM's Sun Belt Conference Media Day representatives, defensive end Adin Huntington (101 percent) and quarterback Jiya Wright (97.2), currently rank 1-2 on the Iron Hawk leaderboard. Huntington has posted personal bests of 665 pounds in the squat, 435 on the bench, 4.44 in the Pro Agility as well as a 38-inch vertical jump. Wright has recorded personal bests of 485 pounds in the squat, 330 on the bench, 4.03 in the Pro Agility as well as a team-best 39-inch vertical jump.\n\n• Graduate student Jiya Wright, who has appeared in six games and played a total of 87 offensive snaps over the last two seasons (2021-22), enters his first season as ULM's starting quarterback in 2023. The 6-foot-1, 205-pound Wright was sidelined for most of the 2022 campaign after suffering a rib injury late in the third quarter of the season opener at Texas. His last three starts under center came during the abbreviated 2021 spring season at Fort Scott (Kansas) Community College.\n\nULM's three scholarship quarterbacks – Wright, sophomore Hunter Herring and true freshman Blake Murphy – have combined for zero career starts. The Warhawks are one of seven NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision programs that have no returning starting experience at the quarterback position. That list features Michigan State, Penn State, Virginia as well as fellow Sun Belt Conference members App State, Georgia Southern and Old Dominion.\n\n• ULM super senior Tyrone Howell, who led the team in receptions (50), receiving yards (852) and touchdown receptions (6) in 2022, has been named to the preseason All-Sun Belt Second Team, as selected by the conference's head coaches and media panel.\n\nHowell also has earned preseason All-Sun Belt recognition from Pro Football Focus (first team), Athlon Sports (first team) and Phil Steele (second team).\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 204-pound Howell led the team in receptions in five of the last six games in 2022 and finished with three 100-yard receiving games.\n\nIn Sun Belt Conference games, Howell led the league in receiving yards per game (98.3), receiving yards (786), yards per catch (20.7) and TD catches (6; tied with Georgia State's Jamari Thrash). He tied TCU's Taye Barber and Nebraska's Trey Palmer for the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision lead with three receptions of 70 or more yards, including an 89-yard reception against the Ragin' Cajuns and 75- and 83-yard TD receptions at South Alabama. He ranked 32nd in FBS and sixth in the SBC in yards per reception at 17.04.\n\nHe had 39 of his 50 receptions over the last seven games, going for 668 of his 852 yards and all six of his TDs. Howell also led the team in first down receptions (33), explosive receptions (12, 20-plus yards) and yards after catch (459). His 459 YAC total was good for fourth among SBC receivers (No. 23 in NCAA FBS).\n\nThe Idabel, Oklahoma, native had a career-best 12 receptions for 176 yards and two scores (46 and 18 yards) in ULM's 31-30 come-from-behind victory over Texas State.\n\nHowell set career highs for receiving yards (244) and TD receptions (3) on nine catches at South Alabama. He scored on receptions of 75, 25 and 83 yards from Chandler Rogers. He picked up 151 of his 244 receiving yards after the catch. With ULM trailing 41-20, Howell caught three passes for 104 yards and one score in the fourth quarter alone. His three TD catches (tied for third) and 244 receiving yards (fourth) ranked among the top single-game totals posted in the NCAA FBS in 2022. For his effort, he was named to the Pro Football Focus College National Offensive Team of the Week.\n\nHis 244 receiving yards marked the second-highest single-game total in ULM history, trailing only Stepfret Williams who caught 10 passes for 264 yards at Nevada in 1995. His three TD receptions tied the third-highest single-game total in school history – just one shy of the record shared by Brent Leonard (4 vs. South Alabama, 2012) and Williams (4 vs. Nevada, 1995).\n\nHe posted his first 100-yard receiving game as a Warhawk against the Ragin' Cajuns. Howell caught three passes for 124 yards, including an 89-yard catch-and-run to set up ULM's go-ahead TD in the fourth quarter. His 89-yard reception ranked as the fourth-longest pass play in school history.\n\n• ULM will feature a retooled rushing attack in 2023 after losing 87 percent of its ground production (1,258 of 1,448 rushing yards). Gone are the top three rushers from a year ago, who combined for 1,183 yards and 15 rushing touchdowns.\n\nThe Warhawks will build the ground attack around sophomore Hunter Smith, who had an impressive spring, as well as a pair of transfers, in Isaiah Woullard (Ole Miss) and Thad Franklin Jr. (Miami-Fla.). Both Woullard (5-9, 215) and Franklin (6-0, 235) provide ULM with the option of utilizing a \"bigger back\" in short-yardage and goal-line situations.\n\nHunter (5-11, 181), who saw action primarily on special teams in 2022, had two carries for 9 yards last season.\n\nA four-year letterman at Ole Miss (2018-22; redshirted 2021), Woullard rushed 103 times for 472 career yards (4.6 avg.) and four TDs. He gained notoriety at Presbyterian Christian School in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, setting the state's all-time rushing record with 8,294 career yards.\n\nIn 13 career games with the Hurricanes (2021-22), Franklin gained 381 yards on 73 attempts and scored seven TDs.\n\n• ULM will rebuild its offensive line around three veterans, in right tackle Keydrell Lewis (20 career starts), center Zarian McGill (12) and left guard (moving from right guard) Elijah Fisher (10), who have combined for 42 career starts. In addition, left tackle Stacey Wilkins (3) and right guard Tellek Lockette (3) also have starting experience.\n\n• On the defensive side of the football, ULM returns 11 lettermen, including five of the team's top eight tacklers from 2022.\n\nRover Tristan Driggers, who led the Warhawks with three interceptions, finished second on the team in tackles with 63 (37 solos, 26 assists), including 4.5 for losses (19 yards). The 6-foot-1, 207-pound Driggers was named to Phil Steele's preseason All-Sun Belt Fourth Team.\n\nDefensive end Kenard Snyder, who led ULM in tackles for loss (10 for 22 yards) and ranked third overall in tackles with 61 (36 solos, 25 assists), was selected honorable mention Freshman All-American by College Football News in 2022. The 6-1, 257-pound Snyder averaged 6.3 tackles over the last eight games since entering the starting lineup. He received preseason All-Sun Belt honors from Lindy's (second team) and Phil Steel (fourth team).\n\nMike linebacker Michael Batton (45 total tackles: 31 solos, 14 assists) and cornerback Lu Tillery (44 total tackles: 29 solos, 15 assists) finished fifth and sixth in tackles, respectively. The 6-2, 215-pound Batton averaged 10.3 tackles over the last three games of the season, including a pair of double-figure efforts at Georgia State (career-high 16 stops) and against Southern Miss (10) in the home finale. The 5-10, 180-pound Tillery contributed four sacks for 34 yards, with three of those coming in back-to-back road games at Georgia State (2 for 18 yards) and Troy (1 for 12).\n\nCar'lin Vigers, who started the last three games of the season at free safety, ranked eighth in tackles with 39 (25 solos, 14 assists). The 6-2, 198-pound Vigers displayed a knack for delivering big plays when the game was on the line. He dropped Jamari Thrash 2 yards shy of a first down on a fourth-and-12 play in the closing seconds to secure ULM's 31-28 win at Georgia State that ended a 19-game road losing streak and came up with a fourth-quarter interception in the Warhawks' 21-17 victory over the Ragin' Cajuns in the Sun Belt Conference opener. Vigers, who is expected to transition back to his normal position of cornerback, was named to preseason All-Sun Belt Third Team by Pro Football Focus.\n\n• ULM's coaching staff features four new faces in 2023, including assistant head coach/running backs coach Broderick Fobbs, special teams coordinator Jason Rollins, defensive line coach Cody Grice and tight ends coach Davis Lewandowski. Both Fobbs (Grambling, 2014-21) and Rollins (Southern University, interim 2021) previously served as HBCU head coaches.\n\n• ULM's 12-game football schedule features six home games for the third time in the last five seasons (previously in 2019 and 2021). Overall, it marks just the sixth time that the Warhawks have played a six-game home schedule in Malone Stadium since joining the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly known as Division I-A).\n\nThe Warhawks' 2023 opponents went a combined 74-76 (.493) last season, with six opponents posting .500 or better records, including two teams that posted double-digit win totals, in South Alabama (10-3) and Troy (12-2). In addition, six foes also participated in postseason bowl games a year ago, South Alabama (New Orleans Bowl), Georgia Southern (Camellia Bowl), Southern Miss (LendingTree Bowl), Troy (Cure Bowl), Ole Miss (Texas Bowl) and the Ragin' Cajuns (Independence Bowl).\n\nA closer look at the schedule reveals that ULM will play four of its first five games in Malone Stadium before hitting the road for five of its last seven contests.\n\nTerry Bowden says \"November is for contenders,\" and ULM closes out the 2023 regular season by facing four consecutive bowl participants, in Southern Miss, Troy, Ole Miss and the Ragin' Cajuns. The Warhawks' November opponents produced a combined worksheet of 33-20 (.622) in 2022.\n\n• ULM opens its third season under head coach Terry Bowden against Army West Point on Saturday, Sept. 2, with kickoff scheduled for 6 p.m. CT in Malone Stadium on the NFL Network. Army becomes the first United States service academy to play a football game on the ULM campus.\n\nIt marks ULM's third meeting against Army (0-2) since the 2020 season, with the Black Knights winning the two previous games (37-7, on Sept. 12, 2020; and 48-24 on Oct. 22, 2022). It also marks the Warhawks' first season opener played at home since Aug. 31, 2019, against Grambling.\n\nThe Warhawks will play their second-straight home game on Sept. 9 against Lamar at 7 p.m. on ESPN+. The last time ULM opened a season with consecutive home games came in 2014 when the Warhawks started 2-0 with back-to-back victories over Wake Forest (17-10) and Idaho (38-31)."
