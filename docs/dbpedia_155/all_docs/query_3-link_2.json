        "text": "FLORENCE, Ala.  The Bowden brand is tattered these days, left nicked and scarred by the turmoil that can come with coaching college football.\n\nBobby Bowden, the Florida State football coach who is second on the career list for major-college victories behind Penn State’s Joe Paterno, could be stripped of 14 wins by the N.C.A.A., pending an appeal, because of an academic scandal.\n\nHis son Tommy resigned from Clemson in the middle of the 2008 season. Tommy’s brother Terry was snubbed by his alma mater, West Virginia, when he pursued the coaching job there after the 2007 season, which was taken as a sign that the Bowden coaching tree had wilted.\n\nThere was disgrace when disgruntled boosters forced Jeff Bowden, another of Bobby’s sons, to resign as the offensive coordinator at Florida State in 2006. His father’s clout could not save him.\n\nAll that seems to remain is the gong to be wheeled out to get the Bowdens off the stage. Except, they refuse to go quietly.\n\n“This game ain’t over yet,” said Terry Bowden, who starts his first season as the head coach of Division II North Alabama on Saturday at Southern Arkansas. “There is nothing less important in life than the score at halftime. Well, it’s halftime with the Bowden family. I’m ready for the second half, and Dad has a finish on his career that has yet to be written.”\n\nHe added: “Who else has three family members that coached teams that were undefeated in Division I? Who else had a father-son coach at the same time, or coach against each other? Nobody, and they never will. Who has 70 years of head coaching in one family and 500-and-something wins? Darn it, heck with y’all.”\n\nTerry Bowden, 53, spent 10 seasons as a college football television and radio analyst before being named the North Alabama coach on Jan. 1 with a $100,000-a-year salary. His last coaching job was across the state, at Auburn, where he was 47-17-1 from 1993 to 1998, including 11-0 in 1993.\n\nWhen the Tigers started 1-5 in 1998, influential boosters pressed for Bowden’s ouster.\n\nNorth Alabama is not a novelty item, something to be used merely as a steppingstone back to the game’s highest reaches. The Lions have won three Division II national championships and have been to the playoffs 14 times, including the past four seasons.\n\nThe university has hosted the Division II national championship since 1986, and, considering the talent Bowden has amassed in the eight months since taking the job, North Alabama could welcome the title game in December  and be its guest of honor.\n\nBowden has signed 25 Division I transfers to help make up for the loss of 15 starters from last season’s 12-2 team.\n\nDefensive end Brandon Fanney was a starting linebacker for the University of Alabama in 2008, but he transferred after disagreements with the Crimson Tide coaching staff. Quinton Andrews, a three-year starter at defensive back for West Virginia, transferred to North Alabama after some contentious seasons in Morgantown. Harrison Beck, the starting quarterback, transferred from North Carolina State after he was nudged out as the starter.\n\nSeven transfers are on the roster from Florida State alone, including Preston Parker, a leading receiver for the Seminoles in 2008. He was dismissed from Florida State after being arrested and charged with driving under the influence. That came after an arrest on drug and weapons charges prompted a two-game suspension to start the season.\n\n“We didn’t invent the idea of kids transferring down to Division II from Division I,” Terry Bowden said. “Some of these kids have been run off by new coaches who think they recruited better players.”\n\nMichael Johnson, a senior all-American middle linebacker, said: “The guys that have been here can’t be mad about it. They have to beat these new guys out.”\n\nNorth Alabama is more than a sanctuary for players. It collects coaches, too. Jeff Bowden, still being paid by Florida State, is a volunteer coach. Pat Carter, an all-American tight end at Florida State who was let go by the Detroit Lions in an off-season overhaul, is drawing an N.F.L. salary while working here for free.\n\nThe Bowden coaching tree seems to have new blooms this fall, a revival that began July 14, which was Bowden Day at North Alabama. All four Bowdens served up their best stories and one-liners, and the brand still showed it had some cachet by raising $25,000 for the program in just a few hours.\n\nThey still have their sense of humor, too. On the practice field this week, Jeff teased Tommy about standing on the sideline in casual clothes and not helping out with the coaching. Tommy said it was fun to see Terry sweat, especially after his brother had written a column last fall arguing why he deserved to lose his job at Clemson."
