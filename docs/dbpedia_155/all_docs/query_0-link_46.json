        "text": "(Photo courtesy of Birmingham Stallions website services)\n\nAlabama is football country. They love their college teams, which for most of our lives was all we had when it came to football. But there have been years when start up “minor league” professional teams have come to Birmingham. My question to fans today is simple.\n\nAre you a fan or do you root for the Birmingham Stallions and why or why not?\n\nThe first time around the USFL came to Birmingham in 1985, fans were flocking to Legion Field to back the team. My father and I were two of the regulars when I was much younger and I’m 66 today. That team had a plethora of Alabama, Auburn and other local players. That first year they packed as many 42,212 folks in the old grey lady. That was only second to Oakland who managed over 47,000. That’s a far cry from the stadium attendance for today’s version of the Stallions.\n\nWith the Stallions doing well, by 1986 they had over 62,000 pack Legion Field. They loved a winner and you began see folks wearing Stallion gear for the first time.\n\nWhen news came out the league was in financial trouble, attendance started dropping as fans could see the end coming and it did of course. Each successive time it was “revived”, attendance was never the same. Folks didn’t see it as a long term thing.\n\nSo far this season in the latest version of another professional league, the UFL, the attendance high has only been 14,153. So clearly the state is not backing them with the same enthusiasm as before. And why should they?\n\nIt’s not that they’re not a team worth backing, in every version of the Stallions had, they were either the top team or one of the top contenders. The problem must be with the old adage, fool me once and shame on you, fool me twice, (or in this case three times) and shame on me! Folks across the country still aren’t sure if this latest configuration of “Spring Football” will stick around.\n\nToo many times have they seen it sputter and go away.\n\nBut that just a theory on attendance. So what of allegiance?\n\nSince 1985, the cable choices have exploded and one reason for lower attendance could be fact that like me, you don’t have to show up to see them anymore. All the Stallions games are readily available to you. They weren’t in 1985. The viewership numbers are good for the new league and show increases as the season progresses.\n\nI can tell you I haven’t attended a version of this newest league’s team. But that does not mean that I don’t follow them closely and watch the games on TV. If I’m traveling, I even record them.\n\nI have learned to like the coaching staff of this team, who won the last two championships with two different quarterbacks and are now leading once again with a third. Head Coach Skip Holtz has certainly found his niche and is the proven to be the best coach in the league. They play tough defense and opportunistic offense. Yes, I am a fan.\n\nTo the folks that say it’s not really an “Alabama” team, as the players come from all over and there isn’t a huge group on the roster from Alabama schools, I have to remind the rabid Alabama and Auburn fans that their teams too have players that come from all over and in the same sense aren’t really an “Alabama” team.\n\nThis league does fill a niche I think is important. It gives us diehards football during the spring and it gives both the “could’ve / should’ve” players that didn’t make the NFL cut a chance to prove they were wrong and it gives the “retreads” one last shot at playing professional football. And indeed, it has worked out for some.\n\nSo here’s the question folks, do you consider yourself a fan of the Stallions or a fan of your local team, and why or why not? There’s a comment section below to let us all know.\n\nLarry Burton has been writing for over 20 years, has been a credentialed writer for Alabama, and has been published in almost every college football venue. After being in the pressbox for years, at 66 years old he was going to retire from writing completely, but is going to add a few more thoughts to that book.

Here’s some schools that are going into the 2024 football season with a lot of pressure on them for decisions that they have made and the decisions they have allowed their coaches and staff to make.\n\nOhio State\n\nOhio State has assembled a team that has cost the school millions in NIL deals and proclaimed itself as the most talented team in all of college football. They are one of preseason top rated teams and are the team to beat in the Big 10 this season.\n\nAfter two consecutive losses to Michigan, their biggest rival, the loss of many of Michigan’s players as well as their coach almost assures that there are few teams in either their own conference or for that matter, any conference that should be able to stand in their way of having the phenomenal season they think they will have.\n\nSo what happens if it all doesn’t pan out? It’s not just the coach who will be on the hot seat, but the school and future coaches as well. How can they sell their school as a winner when they pay out this kind of money, nab top players from other schools, and start out as the team of the century and not win it all?\n\nColorado\n\nThe Deon Sanders experiment could not have started off better, but as the season went on, those first three wins was just about all there was to that hire because they eight of the remaining nine games last season were lost, despite assembling a decent team.\n\nThis season there has to be more success, much more. There’s little room for excuses now. Everybody is entitled to a so-so season, but now it’s put up or shut up time in Colorado. Are they going to be a team of destiny like they thought, or just return to that other ho-hum team from Colorado?\n\nTeams, coaches, social media posters, and the media will have a field day heaping puns on them if all this goes wrong. This season, with Texas and Oklahoma gone from the Big 12, big things are expected from the Buffs this season to offset last year’s 4-8 record.\n\nIf they don’t work out, the school and especially the man who hired him, will look foolish. Yes there’s a lot of pressure for Colorado this season, an awful lot of pressure.\n\nAuburn\n\nLike Colorado, the Hugh Freeze move was supposed to be a big one. Instead, they went 6-7 with the six wins coming against only the worst opponents in the SEC and a Div. II team. There was really nothing to hang their hat on last season. But everyone is entitled to a so-so first year.\n\nYet if Freeze has a bad second year, especially after a good recruiting season bringing in new talent, the school will soon be actively looking again and Auburn will resume its title as the school that keeps paying coaches to sit on the couch at home with millions in their pockets.\n\nAuburn is trying desperately to shed that terrible reputation. They are really banking on this Freeze experiment to pan out.\n\nTexas and Oklahoma\n\nLet’s just lump these two together, because the reasons are all pretty much the same. Did they do the right thing in joining the SEC or will they be shown to be just a couple of middle-of-the-road teams in the conference?\n\nTexas had a great year last year and is a front-runner for one of the top teams in the country this year. Oklahoma beat Texas last season, but then unexpectedly got hammered in some games they shouldn’t have lost.\n\nSo what happens if the SEC schedule week in and week out is too much for them to bear? I can already read the memes on social media. Boy, will the Texas and Oklahoma haters have a field day making fun of them with jabs like, “Welcome to full-time big boy football.”\n\nYes, there’s a lot of pressure there for things to go right. If they get off to a rocky start in the SEC, it could affect recruiting for the future, and that could only compound their problems.\n\nAlabama\n\nAlabama has been the Gold Standard in college football yet again since Nick Saban raised his first of many national championship trophies over his head. No school has ever come close to the kind of success that Alabama has enjoyed during that time.\n\nFew ever thought that Alabama could catch lightning in a bottle for a second time following the “Bear” Bryant years, but they did. Now it is not wanted, but expected to happen again.\n\nThe hire of Kalen Deboer was questionable to many Alabama fans. Many felt his “pedigree” wasn’t up to Alabama standards. If indeed, Deboer bit off more than he can chew by accepting this position, then the school and AD Greg Byrne will feel the heat.\n\nAgain, everybody has the right to a less-than-stellar first year, but a less-than-stellar season at Alabama would be other schools’ dream season. Plus, future recruits are looking to see if Alabama will be Alabama of old. Even a shaky first year may cost the school some big-time names.\n\nIt is almost a foolish thought for Alabama to keep “Rolling” as it has in the recent past, but then this is Alabama, where magic has not only happened before and then twice, and could again. Still, there’s pressure to see if lightning can strike the same place a third time.\n\n(End of article)\n\nFor a story you may have missed, see The Pendulum Swings Back scroll down or go to https://wordpress.com/post/collegefootballnowme.wordpress.com/2889\n\nLarry Burton has been writing for over 20 years, has been a credentialed writer for Alabama, and has been published in almost every college football venue.

That it was going to be tough to replace Paul “Bear” Bryant and Nick Saban when they retired. They were afraid both would mark the end of a dynasty.\n\nIn the first case, it did for a while and let’s compare the logic behind the hires of coaches that followed these two men.\n\nFollowing Bryant there came Ray Perkins. Bryant knew that whoever followed him would be picked to death and he thought Perkins could handle it. Perkins was to coach a few years and then return to the NFL and then the next coach would take over.\n\nBryant had talked to Bobby Bowden and Bowden had agreed to come and coach the Tide, but because Alabama fumbled that by making Bowden submit to a silly interview process, he said no. This all came after Perkins’s firing. Who knows what Bowden could have done with this team.\n\nBut looking at Perkins, he was a “Bear” guy and that’s what the fanbase wanted. The problem was, that Perkins was a lousy head coach in the NFL with only one winning season and never finished higher than third in his division in that one winning year. He was not a winner by any stretch of the imagination. But he was a native son and a “Bear” guy.\n\nHe finished his time at Alabama with a 32-15-1 record, the highlight of which was his last season where he won 10 games and finished second in the SEC.\n\nAfter fumbling Bowden, Alabama decided on Bill Curry to be the next coach. Fans hated him, he wasn’t a “Bear” guy and not one of “us”. Despite this, in his three years at Alabama, he posted 7-5, 9-3, and a 10-2 record including an SEC Championship and coach of the year honors.\n\nHowever, the fanbase still hated him because he never beat Auburn and wasn’t a “Bear” guy. Someone even threw a brick through his office window. When Alabama came to him for a contract renewal they fumbled it badly and made him feel not wanted. They wouldn’t allow him to hire and fire staff and they offered no raise. He quit.\n\nWhat did he and Perkins have in common? Neither had ever been a winning coach. His prior head coaching job was a Georgia Tech where he only posted three winning seasons including a 6-5 campaign and a 6-4-1 season. His winning percentage was far under 50% which left the fanbase scratching their heads about how he even got the job.\n\nBama fans demanded another “Bear” guy to come in and Gene Stallings was talked into the job. Not only was Stalling one of Bear’s “junction boys” at Texas A&M, but he had been an assistant to Coach Bryant as well.\n\nBut his coaching record was abysmal. In seven years at Texas A&M, his record as head coach was a pitiful 27-45-1. His NFL coaching record was about the same, in his four years with the Cardinals, he never had a winning season. This marked the third coach without a winning pedigree behind him.\n\nHowever Stallings did manage to get Alabama back in the limelight and he never posted a losing season at Bama in his 7 seasons there. He finished his time there with a 70-16-1 record including a 1992 National Championship. But he left the program in shambles following an NCAA investigation that caused him to step down.\n\nThen came Mike Dubose. He had no winning record because his first head coaching job was at Alabama, but he was a “Bear” guy and a Stalling’s guy too. The keys to Alabama should never have been handed over to a man who had never been a head coach before. And indeed it was both Alabama’s and Dubose’s undoing. The job went to his head, he was caught in a scandal with his secretary and was caught lying about it to the administration as well.\n\nHe only had one good season where he won an SEC Championship and coach of the year honors, leading Alabama to a 10-3 season in 1999. The rest of the years were not so good and Dubose finished his career at Alabama with a .500 record.\n\nLike Stallings, Dubose left the program in NCAA troubles and that mired the next man coming in from doing all he could do.\n\nThe good thing to come out of that hire however was that Dubose’s failure got Bob Bockrath fired as athletic director and Mal Moore put in his place. Moore wanted to hire a winner and he didn’t have to be a “Bear” guy. It was all about getting someone with a winning background.\n\nSo in comes Dennis Franchione, with the school on probation. Except for one stop in New Mexico, where nobody has really ever won, Franchione was a proven winner and was considered the “Master of the turnaround”. In fact just before his hire at Bama, he turned the TCU Hornfrogs from chumps to a 10-1 team and a powerhouse.\n\nIn two seasons despite being ineligible for a bowl game the second year due to the NCAA probation. He went 7-5 the first year and 10-3 the next and had indeed “turned around the Tide” where they were predicted to be a powerhouse in the next season.\n\nBut Franchione was enticed by Texas A&M to leave Alabama for a huge contract to become their coach and the Tide was sent looking again.\n\nMike Price was hired to become the next coach. He was hired from Washington State who had no reputation of being a winner, but under Price made it to two Rose Bowls and three 10-win seasons. The thought from Moore was that if Price could do all that with an underachieving team, he could do wonders at Alabama.\n\nHowever, he was fired before he even coached one game for dalliances with a hooker at a strip club.\n\nWith little time to find a replacement before the season started, Moore turned to a former Alabama quarterback and NFL assistant coach, Mike Shula, son of coaching great Don Shula of the Miami Dolphins NFL team to take the reigns.\n\nSeveral players left the team before the season started and Shula had a tough first year losing so many close games in the fourth quarter. Shula’s hire was a last-minute move as all the good coaching hires were already locked in for the next season.\n\nIn four years, Shula posted a 26-23 on-field record despite severe NCAA restrictions and penalties including one 10-win season that ended with a Cotton Bowl win. But with player defections, NCAA penalties, and more he finished his last season at 6-6 and was terminated.\n\nMoore was now intent on hiring the best, the most winning coach he could find and he went after Nick Saban hard. The school put a lot of pressure on Moore to make a quick hire and not have to hire a coach just before the season started like they were forced to do with the Shula hire. Offers were made and thankfully turned down and Moore simply kept trying to talk Saban into the job, but Saban was intent on honoring his contract to Miami. So Moore went to work on Saban’s wife, Terry, who knew Nick wasn’t enjoying his NFL job as much as he did his college coaching days. Finally, the owner of the Dolphins, Wayne Huizenga told Saban he knew he wasn’t happy and that if he really wanted to leave it would be OK, so Saban finally said yes at the end of the NFL season. The rest is history.\n\nMoore saw that hiring a winning coach was much more important than where he coached, what his coaching pedigree was, and if he had any ties to Alabama. Moore knew winners keep winning.\n\nWhen it came time to make this hire Greg Byrne knew from his own good judgment, his own past hires, and the wisdom of Mal Moore to only go after a proven winner and he picked DeBoer, who had been a big winner at every stop along the way to Alabama.\n\nSaban and DeBoer have a lot of important things in common. Neither had coached in the South until their first jobs there, but we know how that worked out for Saban and I suspect it will for DeBoer. Both had championships before coming to Alabama. Both are men who build around a team concept and are both excellent builders of players or in other words, are men who can “coach ’em up”. Lastly, both men came to Alabama hoping it would be the last stop in their coaching journey. It’s not a stepping stone to a bigger job.\n\nDeBoer, in his first speech to the Alabama nation, said as much when he said, “There is only one job I would have considered to take me away from Washington, and it was Alabama.” Both men saw Alabama as the pinnacle job for a college coach.\n\nAs one of the old men writing college football stories, I know my history. It was my greatest fear that Alabama would revert to their old ways and demand a “Saban man” be hired to try and keep the past glory alive and glowing with the same old ways and as little change as possible. I wrote many articles warning the fanbase of that position. It was good to see that this didn’t happen and history repeated itself with a hire that was only based on winning, not pedigree.\n\nNow Tide fans only hope that it garners the same results.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOnce a coach leaves a team, players have a 30-day window in the portal to seek other opportunities. When Nick Saban announced his retirement, the floodgates opened and some players decided to seek other teams or a bigger payday. With that time running out, the pendulum swings the other way now as other coaches leave and Alabama can add players from those teams and the pendulum which swung so badly for the Tide, now swings its way.\n\nTo see what’s happening, who they’re adding, and what may happen, keep reading.\n\nOnce Kalen DeBoer accepted the Alabama job, the pendulum swung in Washington and players there began eyeing the possibility of joining their coach at Alabama and some have already made it known. Some will be godsends to the Alabama program and fill important voids from recently departed Tide players.\n\nNo one who loves the Crimson Tide knows the team needed a good center. With starting center Seth McLaughlin a starter all season kept having trouble with snaps all season it seemed, his leaving now seems like a great thing to fans. It opened the door for Washington’s brilliant center, Parker Brailsford, to come in and give the Tide a great center for a few seasons to come. At least to this old writer, that seems like a trade I’d make every day.\n\nBrailsford, as just a freshman, made second-team All Pac 10 honors and was part of the highest-rated offensive line in all of college football.\n\nThey also got Washington’s freshman quarterback, Austin Mack, who will add important depth to the quarterback room, especially since Alabama lost one of their backups in the portal, Julian Sayin to Ohio State in the portal. Neither player saw action as a freshman for either team. Sayin was a more highly recruited player, but with a 6′-6” frame and a great winning pedigree, who knows what the ceiling may be for Mack.\n\nWe all know the value of Isiah Bond, Alabama’s talented receiver who made the biggest catch of the year in the famous “Grave Digger” play against Auburn to win the game. He left in the portal, but Alabama pulled in another Washington player, Germie Bernard, a gifted wide receiver that may fill the hole left by Bond. Bernard was expected to be one of the Huskies’ main receivers this coming year.\n\nYou can be sure there are more to come in the portal, though lips are tight on which targets they covet, you can bet that they are great ones.\n\nNow I won’t go into who is being recruited from high schools. Anything can change until they show up on campus, but according to “experts” Alabama is behind only Georgia in the race for the next best class.\n\nIt was very clear what an impact first-year starters made on the Alabama team this past season. They may once again dip into first-year starters for help and once again it may be ready to supply it again.\n\nAs for the new coaching staff, “experts” around the country are saying it is one of the best of any of the Division One teams. That pendulum swung swell for the Tide and the remaining players seem to feel the same way.\n\nIn fact, Matrix Analytical college football analyst Dave Bartoo said, “Kalen DeBoer was the highest graded coach in 2023 and that the staff Coach DeBoer has constructed at Alabama is trending to be the highest graded on-field coaching staff in the country.”\n\nNow we wait to see what coaching changes at other schools such as Michigan, Tulane, Middle Tennessee, UTEP, South Alabama, Arizona, and others will do to players who wish to be looked over. Then as new jobs get filled and other coaches leave their present jobs to take them, they too will have people to look over and our staff is doing a good job at getting the talent they need.\n\nBy the time spring rolls around, the overall effect of the portal losses should wind up not near as frightening as fans feared, and with the quality of the core that Alabama retained along with the great commitments coming in, it’s easy to see why people feel this next version of the Crimson Tide will certainly be a contender.\n\nDeBoer was asked about the mood of the team and he said he was proud of how they are “buying in” to his vision of team building. The more I study this man, the more I’m convinced the powers that be in Tuscaloosa got the right man. The more I study the staff he’s put together, I see a crew that can not just recruit, but teach and “coach ’em up”.\n\nBut you can’t win with X’s and O’s, you win big games with Jimmies and Joes, and Nick Saban did not leave the shelves bare in Tuscaloosa and this new coach and staff are making sure that these shelves stay stocked with the same quality they are used to. At sixty-six years of age, I’ve seen more than my share of the Tide’s teams come and go, and rarely does my gut feeling of the capabilities of the team get overridden by Homerism, and I think this team is going to be one we’ll all enjoy watching and we may like the results as the season gets underway.\n\nSo the pendulum is indeed swinging, but contrary to what some fans and people who wish bad tidings to the Alabama team wish to believe, it may end up swinging Alabama’s way in the end.\n\n(end of story)\n\nAs an experiment, I wish to see how many of my friends will post this story on a page they belong to.

We all knew the Tide would lose him sooner or later. And the players that are off seeking bigger paydays through the portal don’t mean an end to the Tide. Just like Saban, we all knew that sooner or later we’d lose them too, just to early draft in the NFL or graduation.\n\nThis is college football and nothing stays the same year in and year out. This is just more change than this fanbase is used to and for them, that’s a shock.\n\nBut this is Alabama, the place that coined the phrase, they don’t rebuild, they reload.\n\nThis is the place that has had a champion crowned in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s. No one else has done that, no one else may ever have a legacy such as that. Tuscaloosa and the Crimson Tide are a unicorn, a thing of legend and wonder. There have been times when they were down, but they were never out. Nor will they ever be.\n\nSome people chase paychecks, good luck to them. That is the crazy world that NIL has created. But there are still true-hearted men who chase greatness, and just like they always have, they will be attracted to Alabama.\n\nDeBoer and his staff may still have some things to prove to doubters. I remember folks saying that Saban was a one-hit wonder with his championship at LSU, yet it all worked out as we all so well know. DeBoer has multiple championships and while the naysayers say it was “second tier” championships, it was Paul “Bear” Bryant that famously said, “I ain’t nothing but a winner.” So far in his career, so is DeBoer.\n\nI do not know this new coach personally, have never interviewed him or even shaken his hand yet, but I’ve done so much research into his life that I know a little bit of the metal of the man. To that end, I can assure you that he’d rather have a team chasing greatness with a united goal-oriented team than half a team doing that and the other half chasing the biggest paychecks or personal notoriety. And I know the men who are remaining on this team are doing so for all the right reasons.\n\nThe news is upsetting to fans because of the inane rules that govern the transfer portal. Right now the portal works against the Tide. Any team can poach any player on our roster now and induce them with whatever NIL deal they can come up with. But right now, that water is only flowing one way for the most part. Alabama can not add players through the portal right now, unless, like Alabama, their coach has just left his job at their school.\n\nBut when open season with the portal begins again, you can bet your bottom dollar that Alabama will have players lined up to look over to plug the holes they are losing right now. Alabama in the past has always been the recipient of the good things that can come from the portal and they will again. But now and for a little while longer, it’s going to be more one-sided against them.\n\nEven with this drain from the portal, this team remains one of the strongest in the SEC and still remains a team favored to make next year’s playoffs. They still have amazing recruits lining up to become future stars and as we just discussed, the portal will soon swing back open for Alabama to add even more firepower.\n\nThe fans of the Crimson Tide need to be like the fans from all the decades back to the 30s, who didn’t look back and long for the glory Alabama had in the ’20s but were looking toward the future to write their own glory “In Crimson flame” as it says in their fight song.\n\nMy advice to the fanbase is simple, put away your fear and doubts in the present and look forward to what lies in front of you. Have faith in your school, have faith in its legacy, and take pride in the fact that this is not a normal place. This is Tuscaloosa, Title Town, the pride of the Southland. Our time has not come and gone, our time has been going forward since 1925 when Alabama shocked the world for the first time and beat an “unbeatable” and in present day, ironicly, the University of Washington.\n\nSo no Chicken Little, I assure you the sky is not falling, we are simply waiting for the dark skies to part and bring yet another inevitable championship. You should not be less optimistic than the other 20 decades of fans who saw a champion crowned.\n\nLarry Burton has been writing for over 20 years, been a credentialed writer for Alabama and been published in almost every college football venue.

I may have doubts about you as an individual, I don’t know you either. But what I don’t have doubts about is that this is Alabama, the holy grail of college football, it’s a winner, and if each of us lives up to our potential, then it will continue to be a winner.\n\nIf good enough is good enough for you, clean out your lockers, we’re not going to get along. To quote the greatest coach I’ve ever seen, and you all know who that is, “High achievers don’t like mediocre people and mediocre people don’t like high achievers.”\n\nFolks, life is like a book, I just closed a chapter in my book and so did you when you ended the last season of where ever you came from, whether it was here or someone else.\n\nNo one writes the next chapter in your book but you. What your next chapter says and how your book ends depends on choices you make and things you do. It depends your actions and the actions of the people you decide to be your colleagues, and the people you choose to be around you.\n\nThat book will last beyond your lifetime, beyond any money you may make and be will read, good or bad, by the generations that will come after you.\n\nI want every man in this room to be part of my book and I want to be part of yours. I want our tales to be told in the future that like the ones they’ll tell about coaches and players who were here before us.\n\nI am going to give you 100% to make that happen and all I ask is for you to do the same.\n\nThey say that history can never be brighter than the glory days that have just passed. So to whoever “they” are, I say, You aren’t writing this book, you don’t have a say in how it’s written and you don’t know shit! I can’t wait to see how see how these stories continue. Nothing’s over, we’re still going to add our own chapters and have our own say in that book.\n\nStarting today, we start writing. Are you going to be in our books? Are you going to be part of the next chapter? That’s a yes or no question and deserves a yes or no answer. I had to decide where my next chapter would be written and here I am, ready to give you all I have.

He had no SEC ties, hasn’t even played against Alabama and hasn’t really got a clue about Alabama culture. But the biggest knock I had on him was he’s not recruited in the area like we all know he’d have to. He has few inroads and contacts “down here”. His whole career has been “up North”.\n\nBut why Alabama and even Saban likes the guy is simple. To coin a phrase from another Alabama legend, Paul “Bear” Bryant, “I ain’t nothing but a winner.” And DeBoer is a winner and has been everywhere he’s been.\n\nAs for the shortcomings, at least as I see them, and I’m certainly not a coaching expert, can be remedied by one simple statement I heard Saban make this week. He is going to keep an office in the stadium and maintain some sort of role with the University.\n\nThat means it’s in Saban’s plan to continue to contribute in some way to help keep Alabama in the forefront of college football. This doesn’t mean showing up at practices and sticking his nose in, and being “in the way” as a new coach tries to make this program his own. What it would mean is that Saban could guide him in and maybe even do some recruiting trips with him and help with making contacts and inroads into recruiting, something Saban certainly knows something about.\n\nBut recruiting is becoming less and less about knowing the high school coaches and the programs to watch and more about being a negotiator with prospects and their parents on NIL deals. Something both coaches have learned to deal with in the last couple of years.\n\nSaban believes in his heart that while NIL money is important, so is Alabama. Alabama is the gateway to the NFL and Alabama is a legendary school that has always attracted the best. Saban can coach him how to sell Alabama, which boosters to kiss up to and give a better “lay of the land” program than a new coach could learn on his own in years. Saban may also land money to be used in the NIL program here. He has developed such a network of folks who would still take suggestions from Saban to be a part of the program.\n\nAnd that may be all the help an “outside” coach may need who has the “winning ways” that DeBoer has.\n\nPut this together with DeBoer’s history, work ethic, and knowledge of football and now I can see how this would work and why it’s so appealing to the power brokers at Alabama.\n\nIt’s also why it may be interesting for DeBoer to consider. That and a salary that should double his 4.2 million dollar base salary.\n\nDeBoer has just signed up with Jimmy Sexton, agent for Saban and so many other SEC coaches. This can’t just be a coincidence.\n\nYears ago, I wrote an article on the troubles I hoped we’d not face when Saban retires. I hoped that the backers wouldn’t demand a “Saban Man” as previously was done when Bryant retired. Then it had to be a “Bryant Man”. That led us through many hires that just didn’t work out.\n\nMal Moore was able to see that we didn’t need a “Bryant Man” to bring back the winning ways, we simply needed a winner and Saban was that man. Remember, Saban hadn’t coached “Down South” until he went to LSU, where he won a championship.\n\nApparently, the powers that be now realize that a “Saban Man” isn’t a necessary requirement. And they know more than most of the fanbase who like past ones, really wanted a student of Saban to grab the reins.\n\nI can not only go along with Deboer, should he accept the job, but would be happy to see if winning ways continue at Alabama.\n\nHere’s his “Pedigree” per Wikipedia.\n\nEven the most hard-put, stubborn fan can’t look at that history and disagree with one sure fact, at least up to now, he ain’t nothing but a winner and if he’s picked I’d be happy.\n\nLarry Burton is a semi-retired college football writer who now just writes when the mood and the stories present themselves.

Most may not know it’s his first gig as a head coach, where he’s from, and what his coaching tree is. So here we go.\n\nLanning played for a small college team, in his home state of Missouri, at William Jewel College. He played linebacker there and was never a major college or pro prospect. It was coaching in his blood, not playing that was Lanning’s main focus.\n\nSo following his playing days in college, in 2007 he started his career as a lot of young coaches do in the high school ranks. Park Hill South High School in Kansas City Missouri was where he went and he did lots of jobs, coaching different positions and learning coach/player interactions. But his burning desire was to coach in Division One football at the college ranks so after leaving his high school coaching day behind, he did what so many other do, he became a graduate assistant at Pittsburg under Todd Graham.\n\nGraduate Assistant is the flunky of college coaches but it’s crucial to building the foundation of a coaching career because you may be asked to do so many different things. As of 2024, a typical graduate assistant makes about 20 bucks an hour, so it’s a hard life financially and Lanning served in this role at Pittsburg, then Arizona State where his coach from Pittsburg moved to take that job. After paying three years of dues in this role, he was hired by Sam Houston State as a defensive backs coach and co-recruiting coordinator.\n\nFinally, in 2014, at 28 years of age, he had a good paying gig, but he knew he needed to up his resume and what better way to do it to put yourself in the Saban tree of coaches. Even it was technically a step backward to graduate assistant again.\n\nHis year at Alabama made an impression on Saban and his coaches as they all saw a young man with the energy and drive to make contributions beyond the job he was doing. Hearing what a good job he had done at all his stops, Mike Norvell, the current head coach at FSU, but then was the head coach of the Memphis Tigers, snapped him up to be his inside linebacker coach and recruiting coordinator, where once again his work ethic and results did not go unnoticed.\n\nKirby Smart, starting his third year as head coach at Georgia, plucked Lanning from Memphis for his first big-time college job. Smart remembered him from his year at Alabama and saw him as a real up-and-comer. He was hired to be the outside linebacker coach, a job he did so well he was subsequently raised to outside to defensive coordinator and outside linebacker coach. He was also a great recruiter for Georgia.\n\nFinally at the age of just 32 he was entrenched with one the top teams in college football at a coordinator level making the living he had once only dreamed of. He didn’t sit on his laurels but instead kept grinding and being a defensive coordinator for a team with a national championship under its belt, his name was being tossed about for head coaching jobs despite his young age.\n\nHe sized up options but remained at Georgia until a great job at a preeminent program became available. That happened when Oregon called and at 35 became the head coach of a major college franchise. He went from 1.25 million with Georgia to a six-year contract with Oregon for over 29 million dollars, far from the not-so-distant ago 20 dollars an hour graduate assistant jobs.\n\nHe quickly turned around Oregon’s fortunes and right until the Pac-12 championship game this year was in the hunt for one of the four college football championship slots.\n\nNow at just 37, Lanning is the top name to head up college football’s Maquis institution, Alabama. Whether he lands it or not will come out this week, but he is by far the leading name being tossed about at this time. And now, Bama fans, you know why. He could give a school over 30 years of production and that too is a reason for Bama wanting to kick his tires and perhaps offer him a job that would double his annual salary.\n\nLarry Burton is a semi-retired college football writer who now just writes when the mood and the stories present themselves.

And you never know until it’s oftentimes too late, who’s playing and who’s not, who’s motivated and who’s not, so I may have picked a bad time to stop biting my fingernails.\n\nIf there’s an SEC team in finals, then we’ll have one more Larry’s Losers, if not, then this is the season’s swan song. We thank each and every reader whether this is your first time to read us or you’ve been here for the whole 25-year ride. It has been a journey that I’ve enjoyed taking and you the readers are why I’ve done it.\n\nSo with all that behind us, let’s get to picking some of these games and see if we can end on the same high note that we’ve had all season long. Here we go.\n\nThursday, Dec. 28th, 2023 – Texas A&M vs Oklahoma State – Tax Act Texas Bowl – NRG Stadium – Houston, Texas\n\nThe Aggies lost their coach this season, but not their desire to win so when they travel over to Houston to take on the Cowpokes from Oklahoma State, they’re going to try and go out on a high note and start next season with renewed vigor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cowboys are hoping to move up into the top 20 a little higher and show that they are a team to keep your eye on next season too.\n\nBut only one team can finish on top and we’re going with SEC muscle in this tussle and that means the loser is Okie State at the top of the loser’s list.\n\nFriday, Dec. 29th, 2023 – Clemson vs Kentucky – Taxslayer Gator Bowl – Everbank Stadium – Jacksonville, Florida\n\nHere are two neighbors that rarely get together, but this party in Jacksonville will get these two back together to renew their relations. They’ve played three times in bowls before with Clemson holding a slight 2-1 advantage and every game was decided by a score or less.\n\nClemson’s clearly the class of the field, but Kentucky is one of those teams that you better not let them get going or they’ll power peck you so dizzy you don’t recover.\n\nI actually think that this could be another close game and I’ll be watching it for sure. But a Tiger should slay a Chicken in a fair fight so we’ll put Kentucky on the loser’s list and see how it goes.\n\nFriday, Dec. 29th, 2023 – Missouri vs Ohio State – Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic – ATT Stadium – Arlington, Texas\n\nMissouri is the SEC’s Cinderella. No one saw them playing a team like Ohio State in a bowl as big as the Cotton Bowl, sitting in the top 10 and smiling like a lottery winner. It has been a season to remember and one we’re all proud of for you.\n\nBut this is put your big boy pants on time and Ohio State is not pleased to be playing you and they plan on showing the world they deserved better, so as good as the season has gone for those Midwest Meeyowers, it’s time to face the music in Jerry’s World.\n\nBut with the Buckeye ball slinger that led them so well this season jumping ship, it’s making us feel like the Cats can catch a break and best the Buckeyes in this bowl and put Ohio State on Larry’s losers list.\n\nSaturday, Dec. 30th, 2023 – Ole Miss vs Penn State – Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl – Mercedes Benz Stadium – Atlanta, Georgia\n\nSolid second-tier teams in their respective conferences get together for conference pride and a secure hold on a top-ten finish and while the boys in Vegas see this as a big win for the Nittany’s, I’m just not seeing it that way.\n\nLane Kiffin seems to rise for the occasion and we’re seeing a hard-fought contest from beginning to end. The Rebs have been crack shots this season and there are visions of Lion’s skin rugs in front of the fire, but these Lions know how to spring from nowhere and pounce on a player or two.\n\nStill, we see the Penn Staters edging out the Rebels, so that makes Larry’s loser – Ole Miss\n\nSaturday, Dec. 30th, 2023 – Auburn vs Maryland – Transperfect Music City Bowl – Nissan Stadium – Nashville, Tennessee\n\nAuburn swings up to Song City to take on a Terrapin tribe from up crab cake way, and they hope to end to season on a high note and Coach Freeze tries to be only the second coach in Auburn history to win a bowl game in his first season.\n\nMeanwhile another Tagovailoa takes on the Tigers and little brother Taulia hopes to be like his big brother and send the Tigers home in tears.\n\nBut Auburn’s got a lot more to prove than just getting to a bowl and after years of failing to make the SEC proud of them in bowl season, they’ll finally get their act together and ring on up for the SEC. Or so we hope. Larry’s loser – Maryland\n\nSaturday, Dec. 30th, 2023 – Georgia vs Florida State – Capitol One Orange Bowl – Hard Rock Stadium – Miami Gardens, Florida\n\nHere are two teams with major butt hurt over not making the big time. The Seminoles have talked quite the talk as to what an injustice was served on them. After Georgia rips them two new butt holes to hurt from, maybe they’ll shut up when they see firsthand they didn’t deserve to be there after getting clobbered by the Dogs who were rated beneath them.\n\nNow the Seminoles deserve a hand for the great season they played, but thinking they’re one of the best four teams in football is just ridiculous as we shall soon see.\n\nKirby’s Canines will beat them like a Seminole war drum and even that won’t be enough to shut some of those whining war painters up. Larry’s loser – Florida State big!\n\nMonday, January 1st, 2024 – Wisconsin vs LSU -Reliaquest Bowl – Raymond James Stadium – Tampa Bay, Florida\n\nWisconsin had a decent season and flies South to Florida to try and upset the Bengals from Bayou Country in front of a big national audience. But Brian’s Bengals are aiming to end on a high note and they’ve got the muscle for this tussle.\n\nThis one could get to blowout status quickly if the Badgers try and risk too much too quick, but whether blowout or boring, the loser is pretty well written in cement before this kickoff.\n\nSo let’s just ring up another one for the SEC and put Wisconsin on Larry’s list of losers and move right along.\n\nMonday, January 1st, 2024 – Iowa vs Tennessee – Cheezit Citrus Bowl – Camping World Stadium – Orlando, Florida\n\nIowa had another typical Iowa season, winning just enough to look good and then look awful when the big games at the end rolled around. So when they go to Orlando to celebrate a ten-win season, the smiles disappear once the ball is kicked off, ‘cuz these Vols came to win, not to celebrate.\n\nTo look good in big games you need something called offense, and the Vols understand this while the Hawkeyes scratch their heads and say, “What the hell is that?”\n\nSo unless the Vols hit the moonshine hard before the game even starts, this is gonna be a bore fest to anyone looking for some lively competition and that’ll make Iowa the person on Larry’s Loser list.\n\nMonday, January 1st, 2024 – Alabama vs Michigan – The Rose Bowl – Pasadena, California –\n\nMichigan usually stinks up bowl season like a porta potty on a busy construction site and this year, despite being number one in all the polls, they pulled Alabama, and another stink-up seems destined to happen once again.\n\nAlabama in the Rose Bowl is like fighting a shark in the ocean. It’s their home turf, it’s even in their fight song. “Remember the Rose Bowl, we’ll win then.” Alabama has been killing good teams in the Rose Bowl since 1926 and no matter the odds, they win.\n\nSo unless coach Harbaugh has found a way to steal some players, stealing the signals won’t be enough to keep from being yet another notch in Alabama’s Rose Bowl belt. Larry’s loser – Michigan\n\nLarry has been writing for over 25 years and his sports articles have been published in most all the leading sites. He was Bleacher Report’s number-one college football writer and was the senior writer for Touchdown Alabama.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThere are some sharp minds writing articles for college football these days, but sometimes it’s good to take an old guy’s perspective into account because we’ve not only learned history and trends but seen them with our own eyes. That said, here’s one of the oldest sportswriter’s take on the upcoming Rose Bowl where Michigan takes on Alabama.\n\nThese are not historians or old men playing this game, they were born on average, 20 years ago or so, therefore history to them is limited to what they’ve seen with their own eyes or things that have happened in their lifetime, so let’s start there.\n\nIn these player’s lifetime, Michigan and Alabama have only played twice, both with disastrous losses to Michigan. The first was the 2012 game in Arlington, Texas where Alabama absolutely stomped them into the ground with the final score 41-14 Alabama. I remember that game and it could have been worse. Michigan looked like a high school team playing a college team.\n\nThe second game was just a few seasons ago in 2020 where the Tide once again spanked the Wolverines by a score of 35-16. Once again, Bama played the entire bench and let the majority of the team enjoy playing in a bowl game or it could have been worse.\n\nThe other thing that these players remember from their lifetime of the last 20 years or so is Alabama’s dominance over other teams from the Big Ten in general. Perception does stick in the minds of young men, and the lifetime perception of Alabama most always makes teams from their conference, the Big 10, their bitches in blowout losses. Only once in their lifetime did a Big Ten team beat Bama in a big bowl or title game and it wasn’t their team that did it.\n\nI remember when Michigan State had a great year and many thought they would have a chance to upset the Tide. Kirk Cousins was at the top of his game, and the hopes of the Big Ten were with Michigan State. Alabama was going to finally be taught a lesson. Cousins couldn’t finish the first half, he was beaten in the dirt time and time again, then Bama beat down the second-string quarterback and they ended up playing a receiver at quarterback to finish the game. I was in the press box that day and after the game when we interviewed Kirk Cousins, he hardly could answer questions. It was a pitiful 49-7 thrashing in the 2011 Capital One Bowl at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium in Orlando, Fla.\n\nSay what you will, but these things are in the back of their minds going into this game whether they’d ever admit it or not. In their lifetimes, Bama just doesn’t beat Big Ten teams, they beat the hell out of them. I forget the coach who once was quoted as saying, “Those Crimson jerseys are worth 14 points when they just walk out on the field. Whether you admit it or not, that’s how intimidating they are.”\n\nI saw the looks on the faces of Michigan’s players when the announcement came from the playoff committee that Alabama got into the playoffs and would be playing Michigan. There was an audible and collective groan and a lot of “Oh shit!” looks on lots of faces of the Michigan players. Many on television and in print say the same thing, so it’s not my opinion alone.\n\nSo while the actual stats are not the tell-all many think, the stats were mostly from each of their own conferences, and most would agree that top to bottom, the SEC is a tougher conference. But then, that is a debatable issue.\n\nWhat is not debatable, is history. One team has a history of stepping up and shining bright in big games and post-season play and one does not. The question is, how much weight does that history put on the backs of the players of each team? I’m saying it places some on both teams.\n\nMichigan feels it has a stronger run defense than Alabama and can force Alabama to be more one-dimensional. However, teams that have tried to force Jalen Milroe to beat them with his arm have been beaten by his arm. Milroe has evolved into one of the best deep-threat passers in college football.\n\nStatistically, Michigan has a pass defense that is also better rated than Alabama’s. Michigan feels confident that they can hold Alabama’s offensive output and scores to levels that can be surpassed by their own offense. However, Alabama may be one of the hardest teams to try and make one-dimensional.\n\nFurther, Michigan sees itself as a much more disciplined team, they commit less than 3 penalties per game while Alabama is guilty of twice that number. In this, they are of course correct. As for other perceived advantages over Alabama, that’s all they are, perceived advantages.\n\nStats don’t tell the true story of anything unless you take into account against whom those stats were accumulated. As far as the strength of the schedule goes, according to sportsbettingdime.com, as of the latest games played, Alabama had the 3rd hardest schedule in football. Michigan’s schedule only rates as the 47th toughest. So factoring that into the equation of Michigan’s perceived advantages, one can only surmise that good statistics are easy to be skewed when you play poorer competition.\n\nNo sports ranking service such as ESPN, CBS Sports, or anyone have the Big Ten as a conference ranked above the SEC in any power ranking category. The Big Ten is top-heavy with Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State doing well with the rest of the conference really lacking. In contrast, Kentucky, the SEC’s number 8 team in power rankings defeated the ACC’s championship game contender Louisville.\n\nTherefore, except for committing fewer penalties, no clear advantage for Michigan can be found. It also shows that, just like Georgia, who also had a worse strength of schedule, Michigan’s team has not been forged in the same fire as Alabama and will wilt as the game progresses.\n\nLastly, as the game progresses no coach has shown the ability to make adjustments on the fly and adapt his team to overcome like Nick Saban. That’s why Alabama time and time again has shown the ability to come back from being down and pull away from teams who were either ahead or keeping it close early in the game.\n\nOffense, defense, special teams, coaching, and depth of squad all favor Alabama. History, momentum, and confidence all favor Alabama. Though I rarely predict an exact score, I am very good at it when I do. So for the sake of a new year’s present, this old man who has been there and seen a lot in all these years sees a game where either Alabama has a 31-20 victory over Michigan or a score as high as a 34 -17 beatdown.\n\nLarry Burton is a semi-retired writer who has written for over 25 years and has been published in almost every leading media.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWow sports fans! Last week had a few great games one shocker that not even Auburn’s biggest foes saw coming. Yes, no one in the media predicted the depths to which Auburn could suck, but we now know that on any given day they can suck a battleship through a milkshake straw. Except for that miss, we got them all right and even predicted the close upset by South Carolina over Kentucky. But this week, it’s rivalry week, and anything, well almost, can always happen.\n\nSo with the end of the regular season upon us, here’s our last full week of SEC’s losers for you laugh over. Can we end on the high note we’ve had most of the year? Read ’em and see.\n\nOle Miss at Mississippi State – The Lane train pulls into Starkvegas with eyes on an 11-win season and a premier bowl to party in, while the Dogs simply hoping for yet another upset in this since they’ve won three out of the last five.\n\nBut these aren’t Mike Leach’s Mutts anymore, in fact, we don’t know who’ll manage these Mutts next year, so we aren’t looking for a “win one for the Gipper” moment in this one. Not even the chance to make a bowl game with a win will give them the bite on these Rebels.\n\nSo we’ll list up Mississippi State on the loser’s list and pray for a great new coach and new beginning next season. This Egg Bowl won’t be scrambled.\n\nMissouri at Arkansas – Well once again, “The Battle Line” is being fought and this year the Midwest Meeyowers mosey up to fight it in Fayetteville. These cool Cats have been the surprise team in the SEC this season and coach Drinkwitz deserves a drink in his honor for a quick turnaround for these tabbies.\n\nOn the other side of the line are the poor little Piggies who showed promise at times but just couldn’t keep enough foes from huffing and puffing and blowing them and their house down. And we don’t see any indication that they’ve come up with a solution to stop that in this game either.\n\nSo with a great ten-win season and a really nice bowl looking them in the face, these Tigers send the Pigs to the BBQ pits and will make Larry’s loser – Arkansas\n\nAlabama vs Auburn – The prancing Pachyderms parade into the plains to pummel these Pussycats and send the home crowd home with their toilet paper once again. Last week they did get to use some of it after cleaning out the inside of their undies after crapping their pants against a non-division five school and paying them 1.85 million dollars to do it to them.\n\nSo to think they have a chance to beat Bama is a stretch that we just can’t make, and though they’ll throw everything and the kitchen sink into this game, they’ll still come up short and the Barners will limp into the Birmingham Bowl or some other bottom bowl .\n\nThere’ll be no prayer in Jordan Haire this week, at least not one made by the Worn Eagles that’ll be answered, so Larry’s loser is Auburn. This Iron Bowl is Bama’s.\n\nKentucky vs Louisville – The “Governor’s Cup” is up for grabs in the Bluegrass State this weekend when the Kitties from Kentucky come a calling in Louisville’s Bird house. Now you’d think that a fight between a cat and a bird would be one-sided, but you don’t know the whole story.\n\nLast week these Kitties got pecked on by a Chickens and wound up on not on the winning side and though these little Birdies might be a might smaller than a Chicken, they’ve got sharp little beaks and know how to swarm.\n\nSo we’re going with the home team to bring the Cup to the coop and that’ll make Larry’s loser – Kentucky\n\nTexas A&M at LSU – The aimless Aggies are going bowling without a full-time boss, but they’ve still got things they want to prove, so when they bus down to the Bayou to take on the Bengals, they’ll want to go out with a bang.\n\nBut the fact is LSU’s got a tricky Tiger at quarterback and they’re just a better bunch of ballers than those dirt Farmers from Texas. So we expect to see the Tigers send what’s left of the Aggies back to Texas with a lesson not to try to grab this Tiger by the tail.\n\nAnd this outcome will put Texas A&M on Larry’s list of losers this week and we hope they get a new coach and a new identity soon.\n\nVanderbilt at Tennessee – Things just ain’t gone the way they thought they would for both of these teams from Hill Country. So when the sad sack Sailors from Song City go over Hardknocksville to vie with the Vols, one team will go out on a high note and one will go down with the ship yet again.\n\nEight wins gets the Vols to a decent bowl and two wins send you home for the holidays and that’s just the sad state of affairs in this game. We’d like to say that since Vandy’s won four of the last eight that they have a chance, and they do. I give them a one percent chance of winning.\n\nSo with this game in the unwatchable / who cares corner, let’s just put Vandy on the loser’s list and go on to more exciting contests.\n\nFlorida at Florida State – The Gators head up the freeway to tangle with those Tallahassians in War Paint and they better know now than later, that these Seminoles have been knowing how to deal with a Gator for generations.\n\nFlorida needs a hope and prayer win over their robust rivals to make it to a bowl game, and the Seminoles ain’t bringing no peace pipes for this party, as they need this win to get in the College Football Playoffs, cuz a loss to a bunch of gang green Gators won’t get them there.\n\nSo let’s put Florida out of their misery, put ’em on the loser’s list and let ’em enjoy the holidays at home, and give the Noles the Florida cup. Larry’s loser – Florida\n\nGeorgia at Georgia Tech – The “Clean, Old Fashioned Hate” game is in Hotlanta where the Dogs will play their last two games before any playoff games take place. The hosts, the Rambin’ Wreck, has lived up to their name and limp into bowl season with just six wins.\n\nNow I’d like to tell you that this might be an entertaining game, but coach Kirby will more than likely be watching Alabama film during the game. Georgia Tech has the same chance of winning as me shooting the moon with my trusty .22.\n\nSo let’s just write down Georgia Tech in the loser’s list, wish them well in bowl season and go on to game with a little more anticipation.\n\nClemson at South Carolina – The Palmetto Bowl takes place in the biggest congregation of Cluckers this side of the KFC distribution center, and that is a mighty advantage to the Carolina Cluckers. Folks forget that Clemson’s been a big dog for a while, but the Gamecocks have won 6 out of the last 13 games, so they know how to pull off an upset like they did last season.\n\nI think this could be the game of the night. Last week I said I’d pick the Cluckers to upset Kentucky and set up a wild game with Clemson that could get them in a bowl game and all that panned out. I want so bad for the Cluckers to pull this off and they might as this is a game that will ride entirely on big MO. Momentum will win the day and whoever has it in a close game will win.\n\nI want to pick this pack of Peckers for another upset party so bad and I can sure see it happening, but Dabo’s just got a lot more talent on the other side of the field so my head not my heart is putting South Carolina on the loser’s list.\n\nWell folks, that’s it from this season. This pack of picks comes to you from Princess’s Enchanted Princess cruise ship as she sails us around some islands off Europe’s coast and then home to Florida. It’s been a grueling 2 months of travel that has covered Greece, Turkey and everything in Italy and more, during football season, but the picks have exceeded anyone else’s who posts them publicly, so maybe my mind didn’t wander too far from football during all this, but I’ve made my poor wife happy who suffered so much during football seasons in the past.\n\nWe’ll be back next week with the SEC Championship predictions and then down the road with the College Football Playoff picks. Thank you for letting me share one more football season with you all. At 66, my writing days may be numbered, but I have a lifetime of memories and a ton of friends from all this and I thank you one and all.\n\nLarry has been writing for over 25 years and his sports articles have been published in most all the leading sites.

I just felt Georgia was due for an upset but Ole Miss ain’t the bunch to do it and hats to Auburn for surprising everyone in the football world but those players’ mamas, by not just beating the Hogs, but staging a full-scale slaughter!\n\nI hope you enjoyed all the excitement last week, ‘cuz there’s a lot of cupcakes on the shelf for this week, but just barely enough good games to make the weekend wonderful. So with all that being said, let’s go ahead and start listing those losers. I call this week’s Cartoons, “What the coaches would really like to say publicly”.\n\nChattanooga vs Alabama – The Mocs won’t wear out those new shoes they’ll pay for with the big check from Bama for the beatdown. No they’ll bus on down to T-Town for a colossal clobbering they won’t soon forget.\n\nThis is the game where Saban rests the weary, plays the whole bench, and maybe some of the brass section from the Million Dollar Band.\n\nSo no need to dilly dally with a cutesy explanation here, just put Chattanooga on the loser’s list and send ’em back up I-59 all battered and bruised.\n\nUL Monroe at Ole Miss – The worn out Warhawks flap what feathers they have left to come to Oxford for a big paycheck and another plucking and this is already a team that’s all plucked up.\n\nThe only suspense in this one is will be in Kiffin plays every one of his Commandos including the backup water boy.\n\nSo skip this one, put UL Monroe on the losers list and let’s just move along with a yawn.\n\nSouthern Miss at Mississippi State – When the Golden Eagle fly over to Starkvegas for beatdown and bank draft, this is going to give the Dog win number five in what looked like a tough season. Boy, that’s gonna make the season-ender that much more important.\n\nNext week it won’t be for just state pride, but a bowl season bid, so expect whoever fills Coach Zach’s seat to rest the weary and put in double study time on how to crack a Kiffin while his boys go out there and see if grilled Eagle tastes like chicken.\n\nWith little suspense or reason to watch this ‘un, Larry’s loser will be Southern Miss, even in the players are upset about losing their coach.\n\nAbilene Christian at Texas A&M – Well I told you last week that Jimbo’s butt was burning, and even though he won, he lost a job, but gained a fortune. Only in America can you be fired for being bad at your job and still get 75 million bucks for it.\n\nSo Jimbo’s office may be cleared out, but all the horses are still in the stable and that means they’re able to take on these Christians, no matter how hard they pray.\n\nSo keep the remote handy and click away from this catastrophe. Larry’s loser – Abilene Christian.\n\nGeorgia at Tennessee – While the Dogs were chewing the asses of the men from Ole Miss last week, Tennessee was getting clawed to death by the Missouri Tigers, so to say these are two teams who couldn’t be more different last week would be an understatement.\n\nAt the first of the season, this was supposed to be the game was to decide the East, but now it’s just a game to see how much heart these Hillbillies still have to at least put up a good fight.\n\nAnd that might be worth a look, certainly seeing Dolly try to stir the Vols will be, unless it gets ugly in a hurry, but no matter what how it plays out, in the end, it’ll be Tennessee on Larry’s loser’s list.\n\nNew Mexico State at Auburn – Now here’s a tale of two farm schools fighting it out on Auburn’s South 40 so it seems like with an eight-win Aggie facing a six-win Tiger that it might not be a cupcake clash, but that’s why you read Larry’s losers.\n\nAuburn would be undefeated playing the Aggie’s paddy cake schedule, so when it comes to two farm schools fighting it out, one’s using heavy machinery while the other is armed with hoes.\n\nSo the Aggies take the big payday as Auburn prepares for the Pachyderms next week and that’ll make Larry’s loser, New Mexico.\n\nFlorida at Missouri – Florida finds itself in the dry flatlands of the Midwest Meeyowers with nowhere to hide when they come a calling on these Kitties.\n\nThe Gators have been severely skinned this season and even playing in something as silly as Birmingham Bowl is beyond their grasp this season. And with the Cats finding the big spark to end their season on a hot streak, this one could get ugly.\n\nSo just like in the Tennessee game, this one still might be entertaining to watch just to see if the Gators have any gumption left in their gullets to put up a worthy battle. But we don’t think they will and put Florida on the loser’s list.\n\nFlorida International at Arkansas – This pitiful pack of Panthers parade in the Hogpen all happy to be on national television and get such a big paycheck.\n\nBut even though these Hogs have no hope of holiday hijinx come bowl season, they do want to go out with a bang and the receiving end of this bang will be these battered Cats from Florida.\n\nWhile it won’t be worthy of your attention, somehow ESPNU couldn’t find anything they like any better, but either way, Larry’s loser will be FIU. And that still won’t be enough to save this coach’s job.\n\nKentucky at South Carolina – Oh how good both these teams have looked at times, and boy oh boy how bad they’ve looked at others. Cat’s are going bowling however and the Cluckers are going to have to pull a royal flush to find themselves playing the holidays.\n\nSo when the Wildcats make a raid on the Henhouse in Carolina’s Clucker corner, there’s going to be a border war that might be a doozy to watch. And with this being a rare Sunday after-church kinda game, both teams might want to say a prayer before this one.\n\nNow I know the boys in Lost Wages think this is one for the Cats, but I’d love to see the home team shine pull one out, and then play Clemson for a shot a bowl game. Could this be the day Spenser quits getting Rattled and plays his butt off? We think so. Larry’s loser, Kentucky in my upset special.\n\nWell that’s it for this week folks, this week pack of picks comes to you from Siena, Italy and as unusual for me to say, I’m so sick of Italian food. What I wouldn’t give for a big old stadium dog, or a BBQ sandwich. But no matter how bad my belly longs for home, I’m looking forward to next week, rivalry week, and boy oh boy, will there be some good games there.\n\nWith the regular season coming to a close the way we all figured it would, I want to thank each and every one of you who read this every week and post it on your page for your friends to see too. See you next week.\n\nLarry has been writing for over 25 years and his sports articles have been published in most all the leading sites.

I should have listened to my heart and not my head last week and I would have been perfect yet again! If you go back a week and read, I said I flipped a coin 5 times because I was feeling the Hogs to upset the Gators, but I listened to my head repeat all the stats and trends and failed to be perfect again in the process.\n\nAnd this week, the Hogs have me on the fence again. But the games are getting better and better and each game means so much to so many. As much as I’m enjoying bouncing around Italy, I wish I had my pigskin-picking pooch by my side helping me with these toughies, but the staff manning the fort back at the loser’s lair is helping and we’re still the hottest prognosticator there is. But before I wear a hole in my shirt patting myself on the back, let’s see how this week goes, and we begin.\n\nAlabama at Kentucky – There aren’t many places in the SEC where you can take on a home team and expect an easy Saturday, and when the Pachyderms point the plane to the Bluegrass State, they’d better not be resting on their laurels for beating the Bengals or these Cats will give ’em a scratching they won’t soon forget!\n\nBut Nick’s got some tricks up his sleeve and he’s got these Tiders tripping the lights fantastic and with their eyes on a bigger prize so they’re not about to become this week’s big story on the upset page, so we expect them to pull away as usual as the second half goes on.\n\nDespite usually starting as slow as molasses, this game’s finale should still be the same, so we’ll put Kentucky on the loser’s list and move right along.\n\nVanderbilt at South Carolina – The Song City Sailors sail on over to South Carolina to take on the local Cluckers in their own Henhouse. Now the Swabbies have already come to the conclusion that the only bowl games they’ll make are the ones they buy tickets to.\n\nBut a win here would still give Beamer Ball a small chance of still making it to December football, so they’ll give it their all.\n\nNot they’ll have to give them their all, but the Cluckers use the big peckers to knock the noggins of the Commodores until they abandon ship one more time and that’ll make Larry’s loser – Vanderbilt yet one more time.\n\nTennessee at Missouri – Since joining the SEC, these Midwest Meeyowers have had a lot more success than the vanquished Vols, but this is a chance for somebody the grab the title of second-best in the East and both teams are going to give it their all.\n\nThis is one of those where the hot hand rules the day and this one is one of those grey hair-causing games to pick. Now I want to give the home team the nod, but the Vols are just showing me a little more offense and I’m leaning that way.\n\nNow folks have accused me of talking down the Vols, but they’ve just been a dog that’s been kicked around so long, that it’s hard to change you’re mind. But today is their day and Missouri is the team on the loser’s list.\n\nAuburn at Arkansas – This week Tiger tribe from Auburn travel out West to the Hog farm in Fayetteville, and this could be yet another thriller and a killer for each team.\n\nNow folks think I’m too hard on the Worn Eagles and I’m not, it’s just that they suck this season and I call ’em as I see ’em. But the record you say, the Hogs have just won three games! But they are competitive and are a better team than their record and the Tigers are much worse than their record over a slew of cupcakes.\n\nI expect it to be close, but close games are won by the best quarterback and the best quarterback in this contest is wearing red, so let’s write up Auburn on the losers list and hope for the best.\n\nOle Miss at Georgia – This week Kiffin’s Commandos go over to Athens to see if they can pop the Pooch’s unspoiled season and show that maybe in the SEC, the best is the West.\n\nThere’s no real reason to think that these Rebs can win a shootout in Georgia’s own yard, but folks, the hair on my neck has told me all week that the upset bug bites here. You’ve heard the expression about a paper tiger all your life, well folks, I ain’t saying this is a paper Pooch, but they’re just not as good as their ranking.\n\nSo I’m going with the hair on my neck and am willing to show that I have hair on my ass and go with the upset in this one and make Georgia, yes Georgia, Larry’s loser.\n\nFlorida at LSU – Two tormented teams tangle in Bayou this Saturday. Both lost heartbreaking games last week and only one will be able to lift up their chins after this one.\n\nBoth are going to be bowling this holiday season, but this game’s not about status or standing, it’s about pride and LSU at home is a tough act to follow. And though it could be thrilling for a while, the Bayou Boys just have a little more muscle in this tussle.\n\nSo that’ll make Larry’s loser Florida and they’ll have to try again for that big win number six, but it’ll come later.\n\nMississippi State at Texas A&M – Both these teams have been sleepwalking through the season so far, so when the Bulldogs bus over to Texas to take on the Aggies, it’s really a case of who cares?\n\nSo for a team that’s sleepwalked through most of the season, a cold glass of water getting thrown in your face may be just what these Aggies need, although Jimbo might prefer it being thrown on his butt as the temperature is rising on his results in College Station so far.\n\nAs for the Dogs, it’s not their day, Fisher’s Farmers are just a step above, if not two, so put Mississippi State on the loser’s list and we’ll get started thinking about next week.\n\nWell, that’s all there is for this week folks. We’re sending you these picks from Assissi, Italy as the Mrs. continues planning places for us to peruse. Next week we’ll be in Northern Italy’s wine country so I’ll try and place the picks before I’m plastered.\n\nTill then, call your mama if you can, stock up the snacks, pay the cable bill or show up in person and help your team stay off the losing side.\n\nLarry has been writing for over 25 years and his sports articles have been published in most all the leading sites.

Once again last week we were perfect with the picking, making that so many weeks this season I’m losing count. Yes, we saw how they would all play out, but you’re only as good as your last game, and this week could have some pitfalls.\n\nSo let’s just get started with the picking and quit wearing out my arm by patting myself on the back. With a better use of energy and a little humbleness, here we go:\n\nTexas A&M at Ole Miss – Folks, this could be the thriller! Both teams are aching to be the next best thing to Bama in the West, and both want to prove they’re better than their recent past seasons have shown. So when these Aggies come aiming to roust the Rebels in front of their home fans, it’s gonna be a war.\n\nWe think this could be a game won by who has the ball last or one team jumping on the other so early and often that the game is over by halftime. This is one of those anything can happen games. If Jimbo loses this one they’ll still backslide into bowl season, but his butt will be burning.\n\nThe Aggies have a defense that worries my pick, but the Rebs have an opportunistic offense. So what to do? Well, when in doubt and coin flips don’t help go with the home team, so let’s write up Texas A&M on the list of losers and pray our hearts out.\n\nU Conn at Tennessee – Here’s the first of late-season cupcakes to pad the win column and maybe get the Vols to a better bowl game. When the U Conn Huskies haul themselves down to Hardknocksville, it’s strickly for a paycheck and pounding and the Hillbillies will gladly give them both.\n\nThere isn’t a prayer in hell that these Huskies are gonna pull off a real game and make this one even remotely entertaining, so I’ll give up the writing that this game doesn’t deserve and just list U Conn as Larry’s Loser and shut up about this one.\n\nArkansas at Florida – They say something unusual happens when you see a pig fly, but when these Pigs fly South for the Swamp, we think you can expect the same outcome as usual. Yes, these aren’t the fine Swine of days gone past and they’ve fallen on hard times as of late, even though they have a good signal caller calling those Hogs.\n\nNow folks, I’ve flipped a coin five times in this one because I can see an upset happening in the Gators don’t start fast. But if all goes the way of the way the little smart cookie computer says, this should get the Gators a win they need.\n\nSo with the Gators getting to bowl season and the Hogs officially waiving goodbye to any chance of a post-season party, let’s list Arkansas on the loser’s list and move right along.\n\nJacksonville State at South Carolina – Oh Lord! Here are some of the last and last season cupcake specials to pad that win total and get to bowl eligibility. So when this pair of Gamecocks show up to battle, it won’t take long to see who’s got the biggest pecker in this pack of Poultry.\n\nLast week Beamer Ball put a scare in the Aggies for a while, but they just didn’t have the muscle to sustain a 60-minute tussle with a better team, but this ain’t no better team.\n\nSo in true cupcake fashion, let’s just add Jacksonville State to the loser’s list and go on.\n\nMissouri at Georgia – The Midwest Meeyowers take their Cat show to battle the blue ribbon Dogs down in Athens and though the Cats have stunned some SEC’ers so far this season, they aren’t likely to scratch their way to a win here.\n\nThis ain’t to say though, that if these Fido footballers are looking ahead to the SEC showdown with the Tide that an upset can’t happen. After all, these pooches have looked pretty sloppy at times and haven’t looked like the Dogs of old.\n\nStill, we see the Dogs having their day and that means we’ll add Missouri to Larry’s losers list and go on to the next game.\n\nAuburn at Vanderbilt – Auburn goes up to the Singing City and tries their hand with that old country tune, “Thank God for Vandy, Daddy needs to go to a bowl” and after ten games into the season, the weary War Eagles should have their second win in the conference and finally escape last for good.\n\nLast week Auburn finally acted like a blind squirrel that found an acorn and they actually assembled some offense scoring 27 points against an SEC team. The Tiger defense should be able to keep Vandy away from that total so we see the Wiregrass Wonders getting win number five and getting closer to bowl balling.\n\nSo just like most SEC teams, Coach Freeze will be thanking God for Vandy and that’ll ring up those poor Song City Sailors and Larry’s loser list yet again.\n\nKentucky at Mississippi State – When Kentucky Cats come a calling at the Dog Pound in Starvegas, you know the fur’s gonna fly! Both teams have been surprising and struggling at times and there’s just no clear winner that jumps out at us, so we had to dig deep in the stats to see our way out of this one.\n\nOffensively, the stats look about the same, but Kentucky has played a bit of a tougher schedule in our eyes and the same goes for the defensive stats, so close as to not be a decisive factor.\n\nIn a close one, you usually go with the home team and those cowbells can give a visitor fits, but one team is just a little better and just a little bit more battle tested, so we’re putting Miss State on the loser’s list and crossing our fingers.\n\nLSU at Alabama – All season long, everyone saw these two as the big dogs in the West and today they finally decide who goes to Hotlanta to bully the Bulldogs. Now this is a full-grown Bengal from the Bayou against an exalted Elephant so it’s gonna be a battle.\n\nBoth teams have histories this season of running hot and cold and the winner of this game will be the one who gets and stays the hottest. If the Tide can play with pride and actually do well in the first half, then this game is over, but if they sputter as they have, they may find this isn’t the opponent that squanders a lead.\n\nThese games are won by a hot quarterback and the muscle in the tussle and we think that Bama has the edge to win this war. It’s not without some trepidation, but with meditation that we put LSU on Larry’s loser’s list.\n\nWell, that’s it for this week folks, let’s hope the wave we’ve been riding isn’t hiding a wipeout over the next reef. This Saturday, you’re reading these picks while I’m sipping chianti while riding a train from Bari, to Civitavecchia, Italy as week three of this trip through Europe continues, and so far between me relaxing between picks and the help from the home office of Loser’s Lair, you can’t say I’m slacking with all these perfect weeks of picks.\n\nSo stack up your snacks and fine-tune the satellite dish or the antenna or make sure your cable bill is all paid up. If you can’t do that, then I hope you scrounged some tickets from a friend and yell your lungs out in person.\n\nLarry has been writing for over 25 years and his sports articles have been published in most all the leading sites.

I guess being on vacation relaxes the noodles in my head and makes me see clearer. But the problem is, this past Saturday I was in Istanbul, Turkey, and the 1:30 games started here at 10:30 at night. So it was a long night night of football and slapping myself to stay awake.\n\nBut in the end, it was worth it as there were several exciting games to gander and by now we are really getting a feel of who has what and who lacks what. So can we go for the three peat and have another week of perfect picks? We sure think so. So read and see if you agree and then we’ll come back next week and see!\n\nVanderbilt at Ole Miss – The sad sack Sailors sail on down to Oxford this week and they’re hoping to catch a Rebel that’s been down on his luck in a lot of games this season, but Kiffin’s Commandos aren’t about to let these cellar dwellers deprive them of a win in their own backyard.\n\nBut something tells me that Guys from the Grove might take this one a little too lightly and the game could be closer than most think and it could be close for while.\n\nBut in the end, we expect the Sailors to sink one more time and that’ll put Vanderbilt on Larry’s losers list once again.\n\nTennessee at Kentucky – Coming from the hills down to the Blue Grass State, the tribe from Tennessee travel to Kentucky and this game could wind up showing who’s the king of the middle-of-the-pack players in the SEC East, and the Kentucky Cats are hoping with the previous week off, that they’re rested and ready to catch a team that just lost a heartbreaker.\n\nLast week the Vols looked like a giant killer for a while, but then crumbled and cried all the way back to Hardknocksville. But the sting of that loss may be just the incentive they need to get back to their winning ways.\n\nBy the time this one’s over, the Vols will take one more of these Cat’s nine lives and that’ll make Larry’s loser Kentucky.\n\nMississippi State at Auburn – When the Bulldogs bus over to the Wiregrass to take on the Tigers, Auburn is going to lay out a big old WELCOME mat, cuz this might be their first chance to escape being tied for last place in the SEC standings.\n\nNow Auburn may have some offensive woes from time to time, but these Dogs have it worse. Both have decent defenses, but the trick is you have to score more than the other team to win.\n\nSo for folks who say I never pick Auburn to win, I’ve correctly picked every one of their wins so far this season and I’m doing so again this week. That’ll make Larry’s loser Mississippi State\n\nSouth Carolina at Texas A&M – The Carolina Cluckers flap and squawk their stuff into Texas with plans on finally finishing the Farmers who have been taking their eggs and eating their brothers for years.\n\nBut Fisher’s Farmers have been handling Fricasise for more than a fortnight and they have no intention of letting these Chickens rule the coop. So look for a battle royale as the feathers fly and the Farmers fuss.\n\nThe difference in this game is defense, and the Aggies brought one and the dead Peckers are still looking for one. That makes Larry’s loser, South Carolina.\n\nGeorgia at Florida – When the Dogs drop in on the Gators to effectively finish off the last of the SEC East contenders, We’re all left wondering if there’s anybody who can drop these dogs from their lofty perch atop the SEC’s Eastern standings?\n\nAnd unfortunately for the Gators, the answer, at least for this season is no. So the Gators are left playing for style points learning from their mistakes and miscues while watching the Dogs effectively seal up the East with this win.\n\nSo that’ll make Florida the loser on this list and we won’t know ’till after the regular season if there’s someone who can bully these Bulldogs.\n\nWell that’s it for this week. Yes, I’m playing about Europe right now, this week’s pick were done in Sorento, Italy, but don’t fret, we have the Loser’s Lair manned with house sitters and stat checkers, so we aren’t planning on a drop in performance in this party.\n\nSo till next week, keep tuning in, let us know your thoughts in the comments and keep on hoping that your favorite team won’t wind up on this list of losers.\n\nLarry has been writing for over 25 years and his sports articles have been published in most all the leading sites.

Well it wasn’t anybody on the boob tube, or anyone crazily tapping keyboards, no it was us, yet again, showing the rest of the sports world what perfection and being a legend in your own mind really looks like.\n\nWith the season winding down, many teams are taking a break before the final slugfests to come, but we do have some good games to gawk over. So let’s get started and see who’s closing in on clamping down a bowl bid and who will be sitting at home, picking their nose, and watching the good teams play.\n\nTennessee at Alabama – The Vols bus on down to T-Town for the third Saturday in October showdown and this could be a thriller. After so many years of being just another game, the Vols finally pummeled the Pachyderms last season, and they now have optimism they can do it again.\n\nBut the boys in Crimson have some payback waiting on these Orange-clad kookoos and if the Tide can uncharacteristically start fast, this game could be over quick, but if they start slow, it could be an exciting game until the fourth quarter.\n\nBut no matter how it happens, what will happen in the end, is that the boys in Crimson will be scraping out the Orange off their feet and you can put Tennessee on Larry’s loser list.\n\nMississippi State at Arkansas – The Hounds haul up to Arkansas to try and add some Pork to their post-game feast but the Hogs have sharpened their tusks and plan un poking the Pooches into submission this Saturday.\n\nBoth teams are scrambling to get to the magic number that allows them for some post-season partying, but only one will get one step closer after this campaign.\n\nUnfortunately though, if it goes the way we see it, both teams will still have a way to go after this one because we’re seeing Mississippi State win and put the Hogs on the list after this one.\n\nSouth Carolina at Missouri – The Col. Sanders Cluckers fly to Mizzou to take on the midwest Meyowers in their home catbox. Now the Cats have earned some blue ribbons this year for their fortuitous fate in football this year and they’re hoping to be best in show in this event too.\n\nSouth Carolina has shown glimpses of greatness this season, but a glimpse won’t help you much in a 60-minute slugfest. Mizzou is gonna try and make sure they don’t land a lucky punch and take a win away from them in this one.\n\nDefense is the difference in this one and Mizzou has one and the Cocks are a little limp in that area, so we’re going to see the Cats lock up a bowl berth, and that makes Larry’s loser South Carolina.\n\nThese Chickens are good, but they don’t have big enough peckers to slow down a Tiger!\n\nOle Miss at Auburn – When the Rebs come into Auburn thinking an easy win over a glorified war chicken, they might be in for a surprise. Auburn plays like a Tiger possessed in night games at home. I’ve been there too many times and seen them upset bigger ballers.\n\nKiffin’s Commandos may have their hands full in this one as the Tigers from Auburn are desperately searching for any win over any SEC team. So the Rebs better start off strong and get that crowd out of the game early and then not let up.\n\nI can see this going the other way if Auburn gets going on offense, they’ve got the defense to be respectable and the the crowd could carry them, but we’re being reasonable and putting a trashy team tied for no conference wins where it belongs and make Auburn Larry’s loser.\n\nArmy at LSU – When Army rolls in Baton Rouge this weekend to take on the Tigers, it’s gonna be a long night for the boys in that battalion. You see, the refs won’t let ’em use their Tanks or Bradleys in this skirmish, so the boys will be exposed to the Cajun Kitty’s claws all night long and that won’t be a good matchup.\n\nYes, the Bengals should run blitzkrieg over this Army like they were French soldiers in World War II and it won’t be a good one to watch.\n\nSo let’s just land Army on Larry’s loser list and say Congrats to the Cats for win number 6. Who would have thought that LSU would be fighting for a decent bowl when the season started? Talk about a season not living up to its hype!\n\nWell, that’s it for this week folks, We love bringing you these laughable losers and letting you know who’s watchable and who’s just weary.\n\nWe hope to see you back in this same place next week, till then, stock up your snacks, get those noisy kids out of the house, send your mother-in-law home, and get ready for good football!\n\nLarry has been writing for over 25 years and his sports articles have been published in most all the leading sites.

Last week was full of exciting games and this week won’t be much different. Last week we were almost perfect, but Missouri’s late-game guffaw cost them my upset win.\n\nAnd this week has some games that are just as head-scratching. But since we routinely outguess all the talking heads on TV, radio, and print, we think once again we’ll catch these contests correctly and list up the appropriate losers. So with all that mouthful said, let’s get going.\n\nGeorgia at Vanderbilt – For a team used to playing in front of big crowds, the Bulldogs barge into the Commodore’s stadium to find the fewest seats in the SEC. And for the Song City Sailors, that’ll just mean that fewer of their own family will see the fiasco that’s going to happen on Saturday.\n\nMaybe soon, Vanderbilt will have a team and a stadium worthy of this type of warfare, but this week it’s just another SEC slaughter against the traditional weaker little brother.\n\nSo rip out the remote and find a better fight and we’ll just list up Vanderbilt to the loser’s list and move on to the next one.\n\nArkansas at Alabama – The Hooven Hogs from Arkansas bus on down to T-Town for a little party with the Pachyderms. But you don’t go poking an Elephant if don’t want to be trampled and that’s what these Razorbacks are soon to find out.\n\nNow in the past, the Hogs have found a way to make a game out of trying to trouble these Tuscalossans, but this week, the Tide washes away any thought of making a contest out of this game.\n\nThis is not the same team that lost its early season game with Texas and they’re sure not gonna get back in the mud with these Pigs in their own pen. Larry’s loser – Arkansas\n\nTexas A&M at Tennessee – East meets West when Fisher’s Farmboys come into Tennessee to take on the Vols in the stadium by the river in Hardknocksville. A&M is hoping to regroup from a big loss last week and the Vols are still on cloud nine from a big win, so they’re coming into this game with different mindsets.\n\nNow Coach Josh Heupel just sent Saban a gift basket for the blueprint on to attack these Farm Boys and since the Aggies Coach Fisher figures on this, he’ll try and change things up for confusion’s sake.\n\nThis is gonna be a good one, but the Vols have an offense and the Aggies really don’t and they each have close defenses, so you gotta go with the Vols and watch Jimbo circle the drain one time, which will put Texas A&M on Larry’s losers list.\n\nFlorida at South Carolina – Now when a big ol’ Alligator comes into a Chicken’s house, the outcome might seem to be one-sided. But these Carolina Cluckers have a history of pecking opposing players into submission and this could be that time too.\n\nThis is gonna be a doosey to watch and I suspect the boys with the big peckers are gonna give these Gators more than a few pecks on the head. But the Gators are an up and comer and South Carolina is still trying to find what kind of Cluckers they are, so we’ll go against the odds and pick South Carolina to be the next loser on the list.\n\nAuburn at LSU – When the Worn Eagles flap down to the Bayou Bengal’s turf, poor old Coach Hugh Freeze won’t be enjoying his time in the SEC like he did at Ole Miss, and as badly as he needs a win with the season waning, this sure ain’t the place to look for one.\n\nHere are two tribes of Tigers trying to thrash one another but the one from the wiregrass are just kittens compared to Kelly’s big Kitties and unless the boys from Auburn somehow find an offense, it’s gonna be a long day. So far this season, Auburn’s managed to only beat the cupcakes.\n\nSo once again, let’s list up Auburn on Larry’s losers and remind the boys from Auburn that there’s always next season. And with Auburn tied for bottom in the SEC, let’s see if Freeze starts getting the cold shoulder from the Auburn brass.\n\nMissouri at Kentucky – This Kitty Cat clash is going to be a goodie. Both are coming off losses after starting so hot, but one was nipped at the end by a good SEC team and the other was skinned alive by the SEC’s best.\n\nThe Midwest Meeyowers are having a much better season than they expected and they have been resilient when they’ve needed to be. And those Cats from Kentucky never had a game in doubt until Georgia took seven of their nine lives last week.\n\nThis could be a coin toss, just like last week, when I picked an upset Missouri win over LSU. They almost pulled it off and led for over 3 quarters, but ended up letting me down. Surely they won’t do that two weeks in a row, so we’re going that way again and making Larry’s loser – Kentucky.\n\nWell, that’s it for this week folks, as an old writer, who now only writes for fun and the many folks who didn’t want this series of articles to end, just as I never want a football season to end.\n\nSo the good Lord willing and the creek don’t rise, we’ll see you back here next week for another round of picks to poke fun of, and till then pray the games stay this good!\n\nLarry has been writing for over 25 years and his sports articles have been published in most all the le"
