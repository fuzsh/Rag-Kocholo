        "text": "AKRON, Ohio â€” The search for the next head football coach of the Akron Zips has ended.\n\nTerry Bowden, 54, will take on the chore of savior for a program that is short on wins (2-22 the last two seasons), short on talent and short on scholarships, but long on grandiose expectations.\n\n\"We know the entire Akron community will support Coach Bowden in his mission to cultivate a championship program here,\" Akron President Luis Proenza said in a statement released to confirm Bowden's hiring.\n\nThis ended a four-week secret search by Akron Athletic Director Tom Wistrcill to find a replacement for fired Rob Ianello, who had that 2-22 record in his two years coaching the Zips. He dealt with player losses right up to the end, as All-Mid-American Conference first team linebacker Brian Wagner asked for and received his release from the Zips to play his senior season elsewhere.\n\nBowden's hiring gives the Zips a \"name\" head coach, as he is the son of former Florida State coaching icon Bobby Bowden. The younger Bowden was previously an assistant at Akron during the Gerry Faust regime, and was the head coach at Auburn of the Southeastern Conference.\n\nTerry Bowden file\n\nCollege:\n\nHead coaching record:\n\nCoaching history:\n\nAkron head coaches:\n\n--\n\nRelated content\n\nAfter Bowden quit Auburn in midseason 1998 in the midst of going 1-5, he had a 10-year run as a college football TV analyst before spending the past three seasons at Division II North Alabama, where he went to the Division II playoffs each season. His arrival at Akron comes on the heels of at least two suitors pulling out of the search, including native son Paul Winters, who is head coach at Division II Wayne State.\n\nWinters this year took his Warriors to the DII title game -- ironically played at the North Alabama campus. Winters grew up in Akron, played for the Zips and once was an assistant for the Zips, but declined the opportunity to return. That sent the Zips scrambling for a replacement.\n\nWhen asked for the time line for getting Bowden on board, Wistrcill, in his first public comments since the search began, said Thursday evening, \"We'll go through that at the press conference.\"\n\nThat is set for Wednesday at 5 p.m. at InfoCision Stadium.\n\nAt North Alabama, Bowden led the Lions to a 29-9 record and three-consecutive playoff appearances. As head coach of Auburn, he went 47-17-1 (.731 winning percentage). In his first season at Auburn, he became the first coach in Division I-A history to have an undefeated and untied season in his inaugural year at that level.\n\nBefore his stint at Auburn, Bowden built two programs from the ground up as head coach at Salem College (W.Va.) and Samford University (Ala.). When he took the job at Salem in 1983 he became the nation's youngest head coach in college football at age 26.\n\nInheriting a Samford program which had won just six games in three years before his arrival, Bowden led the Bulldogs to a 9-1 record his first year, tying the record for the best season in school history.\n\nThe challenge is daunting at Akron as the program is in dire straits. It has been below the NCAA scholarship limit of 85 players for several seasons.\n\nIn 2008 Akron lost scholarships due to failure to comply with NCAA mandated graduation rate policies. In 2009 it fired coach J.D. Brookhart, leading to the defection of more players. The Zips played the 2011 season short on players and now Wagner could signal even more losses.\n\nOn top of that, recruiting classes between 2008 and now have been less than stellar, due in great measure to the revolving door of head coaches."
