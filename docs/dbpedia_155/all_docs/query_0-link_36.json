A player becomes eligible for consideration by the NFF's Honors Court 10 full seasons after his final year of intercollegiate football played.\n\n3. While each nominee's football achievements in college are of prime consideration, his post football record as a citizen is also weighed. He must have proven himself worthy as a citizen, carrying the ideals of football forward into his relations with his community. Consideration may also be given for academic honors and whether or not the candidate earned a college degree.\n\n4. Players must have played their last year of intercollegiate football within the last 50 years*.

Veterans Committee candidates must still meet First Team All-America requirement.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME QUICK FACTS\n\nWhen the 2022 Hall of Fame Class is officially inducted in December, only 1,056 players and 226 coaches will have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame from the nearly 5.54 million who have played or coached the game during the past 152 years. In other words, less than two one-hundredths of a percent (.02%) of the individuals who have played the game have earned this distinction.\n\nFounded in 1947, The National Football Foundation & College Hall of Fame inducted its first class of inductees in 1951. The first class included 32 players and 22 coaches, including Illinois' Red Grange, Notre Dame's Knute Rockne, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Carlisle (PA)'s Jim Thorpe.\n\n317 schools are represented with at least one College Football Hall of Famer.\n\nInduction for the 2022 Class will take place Dec. 6 during the 64th NFF Annual Awards Dinner Presented by Las Vegas at the Bellagio Resort & Casino.\n\n2022 College Football Hall of Fame Class Bios\n\nLAVAR ARRINGTON\n\nPenn State University\n\nLinebacker, 1997-99\n\nKnown for the \"LaVar Leap\" where he would jump over the offensive line, LaVar Arrington was one of the most feared linebackers in the late 1990s. The Pittsburgh native becomes the 19th Penn State player to enter the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 12th Nittany Lion ever selected as a two-time First Team All-American, Arrington earned unanimous honors in 1999. In 1999, he was the recipient of the Butkus Award as the nation's top linebacker and the Bednarik Award as the country's top defensive player. A finalist for the Nagurski and Lombardi awards, Arrington finished ninth in the 1999 Heisman Trophy voting. A two-time First Team All-Big Ten honoree, Arrington became the first sophomore to ever be named the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year when he received the honor in 1998.\n\nThe 1999 Jack Lambert Award recipient led the Nittany Lions to three bowl games, including wins in the 1999 Outback Bowl and the 1999 Alamo Bowl. Penn State finished with top 20 national rankings all three years of his career, highlighted by a No. 11 finish in 1999. Arrington racked up 173 tackles, 39 tackles for loss, 19 sacks and three interceptions while playing for College Football Hall of Fame coach Joe Paterno. The Big Ten Network named him to its \"Mount Rushmore of Penn State Football,\" and he was elected to the WPIAL Hall of Fame in 2011 for his excellence at North Hills High School in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe second overall pick in the 2000 NFL Draft by the Washington Football Team, Arrington played for Washington from 2000-05 and then for the New York Giants in 2006. He was a three-time Pro Bowl selection.\n\nFollowing his NFL career, Arrington began a successful broadcasting career. Currently working for FOX Sports Radio, he is the co-host of the network's weekday morning show \"2 Pro's and a Cup of Joe\" alongside Brady Quinn and Jonas Knox. He is also co-host of the nationally-syndicated weekend program/podcast \"Up On Game\" with TJ Houshmandzadeh and Plaxico Burress. Arrington has also been featured on FOX Sports television programs, including FS1's \"Speak for Yourself.\"\n\nCHAMP BAILEY\n\nUniversity of Georgia\n\nDefensive Back, 1996-98\n\nOne of the most versatile players in Georgia history, Champ Bailey played more than 1,000 snaps on offense, defense and special teams during his remarkable 1998 season. The Folkston, Georgia, native becomes the 16th Bulldog player to join the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 1998 consensus First Team All-American took home the Nagurski Trophy as the nation's top defensive player that season while finishing seventh for the Heisman Trophy. During that standout season, Bailey was a team captain and saw action at defensive back and wide receiver while also returning kickoffs. He was named the SEC Player of the Week against Auburn that season after a performance that included a career-high 119 plays highlighted by a fourth-quarter interception.\n\nA two-time First Team All-SEC selection (1997, 1998), he was also named to the SEC All-Freshman Team in 1996. The inaugural recipient of the UGA Vince Dooley MVP Award, Bailey led the Bulldogs to consecutive postseason wins at the 1998 Outback Bowl and the 1998 Peach Bowl, where he won Defensive MVP honors. He helped UGA to national rankings in 1997 (No. 10) and 1998 (No. 14) while playing for College Football Hall of Fame Coach Jim Donnan and alongside Hall of Famer Matt Stinchcomb. A member of the FWAA's 75th Anniversary All-America Team, Bailey finished his career at Georgia with 147 tackles, eight interceptions and 27 pass breakups while racking up 978 receiving yards and five touchdowns on offense.\n\nThe seventh overall pick by Washington in the 1999 NFL Draft, Bailey played 15 seasons for Washington (1999-2003) and the Denver Broncos (2004-13). The 12-time Pro Bowl selection is a member of the NFL's 2000s All-Decade Team, and he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nWhile with the Broncos, Bailey donated time and money to the Denver Rescue Mission, and he worked with The Crossing in Park Hill, a transitional housing program in Denver. He also supports the Bailey Brothers Foundation with his brother and fellow Georgia football alum, Boss. The 2018 State of Georgia Sports Hall of Fame inductee was also a record-setting track and field athlete at UGA.\n\nMICHAEL CRABTREE\n\nTexas Tech University\n\nWide Receiver, 2007-08\n\nThe first two-time winner of the Biletnikoff Award, Michael Crabtree was one of the most electric wide receivers in college football history. The Dallas native becomes the sixth Red Raider player in the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe only two-time unanimous First Team All-American (2007, 2008) in Texas Tech history, Crabtree finished fifth in the 2008 Heisman Trophy voting. The 2007 Freshman All-American burst onto the scene by setting still-standing freshman single-season FBS records for receiving yards (1,962), receptions (134), receiving yards per game (150.9), touchdown receptions (22), receptions per game (10.3) and 100-yard receiving games (11). Crabtree still ranks in the top 15 all-time in nine FBS receiving categories, with his 1,962 receiving yards in 2007 currently third in FBS single-season history. A two-time recipient of the Paul Warfield Award, Crabtree was named CBSSports.com's National Freshman of the Year and the AT&T All-America Player of the Year in 2007.\n\nA two-time First Team All-Big 12 selection, Crabtree was named the Big 12 Co-Offensive Freshman of the Year in 2007. Despite playing just two seasons, he remains Texas Tech's all-time leader with 41 career receiving touchdowns and 15 career 100-yard receiving games while ranking second with 3,127 career receiving yards. His 1,962 receiving yards and 134 receptions in 2007 are both Big 12 and Red Raider records, and he owns the top two single-season receiving touchdown marks in school history (22 in 2007, 19 in 2008). The 2007 Texas Tech team MVP owns nearly every freshman receiving record in the Big 12 and Red Raider record books. In 2008, Crabtree led Texas Tech to a share of the Big 12 South Division title, an 11-2 record and the No. 12 final ranking. His highlight moment came against Texas that season, in which he hauled in the game-winning 28-yard touchdown with one second remaining to shock No. 1 Texas. Crabtree led the Red Raiders to two bowl games, including a win in the 2008 Gator Bowl. The 2020 Texas Tech Hall of Fame inductee was named to the school's Football Ring of Honor in 2021.\n\nThe 10th overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, Crabtree played 11 seasons with the 49ers (2009-14), Oakland Raiders (2015-17), Baltimore Ravens (2018) and Arizona Cardinals (2019).\n\nOff the field, he established the Crab5 Foundation, which hosts numerous events each year for underprivileged youth. Crabtree also fully endowed a scholarship at Texas Tech in 2019.\n\nSYLVESTER CROOM\n\nUniversity of Alabama\n\nCenter, 1972-74\n\nHighlighted by a national championship, Sylvester Croom was a leader at center during one of the most successful runs in Alabama history. The Tuscaloosa, Alabama, native becomes the 20th Crimson Tide player to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nA 1974 First Team All-American, Croom helped the Crimson Tide to a UPI national title in 1973. The 1974 First Team All-SEC selection and Jacobs Blocking Trophy recipient led Alabama to three consecutive conference titles. The 1974 team captain led the Tide to three bowl games and three top 10 final national rankings (No. 7 in 1972, No. 4 in 1973 and No. 5 in 1974).\n\nBehind Croom's stellar blocking, the Tide averaged 414.7 yards per game in 1972, 480.7 yards per game in 1973 and 388.3 yards per game in 1974. During his three seasons, Alabama posted an impressive 32-4 record, with only one loss coming during the regular season. Croom capped his collegiate career in the 1975 Senior Bowl after playing for College Football Hall of Fame Coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant and alongside Hall of Famers John Hannah, Woodrow Lowe and Ozzie Newsome in Tuscaloosa. He was inducted into the State of Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 2020, and the Crimson Tide's spring practice award is named the Sylvester Croom Commitment to Excellence Award in his honor.\n\nAfter going undrafted in 1975, Croom played one season with the New Orleans Saints before returning to Alabama to begin his storied coaching career. After serving on the Crimson Tide staff from 1976-86 under his former coach Bryant and Ray Perkins, he then coached in the NFL from 1987-2003. In 2004, Croom made history when Mississippi State hired him as the first Black head football coach in SEC history. He was named the SEC Coach of Year in 2007. Following five seasons at Mississippi State, Croom returned to the NFL as an assistant coach before retiring following the 2017 season.\n\nCroom is heavily involved with College View Baptist Church, which was started by his father who was an All-American at Alabama A&M.\n\nMIKE DOSS\n\nOhio State University\n\nSafety, 1999-2002\n\nOne of just eight three-time All-Americans in Ohio State history, Mike Doss capped his remarkable career by leading the Buckeyes to a national championship. The Canton, Ohio, native becomes the school's 27th player to join the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nA First Team All-American during his last three seasons at Ohio State, Doss earned unanimous honors following his stellar senior campaign in 2002 in which he recorded a personal best 107 tackles. That season, the team captain and Thorpe Award finalist led the Buckeyes to a perfect 14-0 record, the Big Ten title, the No. 1 final ranking and the BCS National Championship following a victory over Miami (FL) in the Fiesta Bowl. Doss was named the Defensive MVP of that 31-24 double-overtime victory after recording nine tackles and a 35-yard interception return that led to Ohio State's first touchdown of the game on its ensuing possession. The 2002 season was the Buckeyes' first 14-0 season in school history and their first undefeated season since 1973.\n\nThe 2002 Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, Doss was a three-time First Team All-Big Ten selection. Boasting the most career tackles by a defensive back in school history (331), he led Ohio State in tackles as a sophomore and junior. His 228 career solo tackles are the fifth most in Buckeyes history. A 2011 Ohio State Athletics Hall of Fame inductee, Doss played for College Football Hall of Fame Coaches John Cooper and Jim Tressel.\n\nA second-round pick by the Indianapolis Colts in the 2003 NFL Draft, Doss played six seasons for the Colts (2003-06), Minnesota Vikings (2007) and Cincinnati Bengals (2008). He won Super Bowl XLI as a member of the Colts.\n\nIn 2005, he founded the Michael A. Doss Foundation, which focuses on education and social welfare. He has also hosted \"Make a Difference\" youth camps. In 2019, Doss earned a master's in business operational excellence from Ohio State, and he is now a licensed real estate agent for the Robert Weiler Company in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nCHUCK EALEY\n\nUniversity of Toledo\n\nQuarterback, 1969-71\n\nThe signal caller for the best run in Toledo football history, Chuck Ealey never lost a game in his three seasons as the Rockets' starting quarterback. The NFF Veterans Committee selection becomes the second player in school history to enter the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nNamed a 1971 First Team All-American, Ealey went a remarkable 35-0 as Toledo's starting quarterback. The three-time MAC Back of the Year became the first player in conference history to receive votes for the Heisman Trophy, tallying 168 points for an eighth-place finish in 1971. A three-time First Team All-MAC selection, Ealey led the Rockets to three consecutive conference titles. He guided the team to three-straight Tangerine Bowl victories, earning MVP honors in all three games.\n\nA 1971 team captain, Ealey finished his career as Toledo's all-time leader with 5,275 passing yards and 45 touchdown passes, both marks that still rank in the top 10. In both 1970 and 1971, he received the team's Jim Nicholson Award. Voted No. 1 on Toledo's All-Century Football Team, Ealey is one of just four players to have his number retired by the Rockets. The Portsmouth, Ohio, native played alongside College Football Hall of Famer Mel Long during his time in the Glass Bowl.\n\nAfter going undrafted by the NFL, Ealey signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League. Taking over as the starting quarterback in 1972, he would go on to win the CFL's Most Outstanding Rookie Award and lead the Tiger-Cats to a victory in the Grey Cup, where he earned MVP honors. In total, Ealey played seven seasons in the CFL with the Tiger-Cats (1972-74), Winnipeg Blue Bombers (1974-75) and Toronto Argonauts (1975-78).\n\nFollowing his football career, Ealey served as a financial advisor in the Toronto area. He currently serves as a consultant and public speaker, helping people of all ages discover and embrace their undefeated spirit so they can better themselves and their community. He founded the Chuck Ealey Foundation, which annually awards academic scholarships to college and high school recipients of The Chuck Ealey Undefeated Spirit Award. The Chuck Ealey Foundation also provides opportunities to high school students to help build their mentoring skills while guiding underprivileged youth to discover and embrace their sense of self-worth and \"undefeated spirit.\"\n\nKEVIN FAULK\n\nLouisiana State University\n\nAll-Purpose/Running Back, 1995-98\n\nThe epitome of an all-purpose player, Kevin Faulk remains the SEC's leader in career all-purpose yards and LSU's all-time leading rusher. The Lafayette, Louisiana, native becomes the 11th Tiger player to enter the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nA 1996 First Team All-American as an all-purpose player, Faulk still holds the all-time SEC record with 6,833 all-purpose yards, a mark that was fourth in FBS history when he finished his career. During that 1996 season, he led the SEC in all-purpose yards and ranked second in the league in rushing. Faulk followed up his All-America campaign by leading the SEC in rushing during both his junior and senior seasons, and he also topped the league in scoring as a senior. The three-time First Team All-SEC selection was the first player in LSU history to average more than 100 yards per game during his entire career.\n\nSetting 11 school records by career's end, Faulk still holds LSU career marks for rushing yards (4,577), rushing touchdowns (46), all-purpose yards (6,833) and 100-yard rushing games (22).

As the Tigers' program grew in stature, Murphy replaced small-college opponents with major programs, including wins against Florida State, Houston, Miami (FL), Mississippi, Mississippi State, South Carolina, Virginia Tech and Wake Forest. In 1962, Murphy led the Tigers to their first win over a member of the SEC, a 28-7 victory at Mississippi State.\n\nIn 1963, the Tigers posted the school's first undefeated season since 1938 with a 9-0-1 record, and Murphy claimed National Coach of the Year honors from The Detroit Times while Memphis running back Dave Casinelli claimed the NCAA rushing title and the defense posted five shutouts. The team finished No. 14 in the UPI Coaches Poll, the highest ranking in school history. The lone tie that season, a 0-0 tilt, came against No. 2 Ole Miss who had not been shutout in 47 games. In 1967, Murphy and the Tigers would finally gain the upper hand, claiming the program's first win against Ole Miss with a 27-17 victory at home.\n\nIn 1968, Memphis ended its 27-year run as an independent, joining the Missouri Valley Conference, and Murphy would earn Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the Year honors in three of the school's first four seasons in the conference. On Dec. 18, 1971, Murphy led Memphis to its first appearance and first win in a major bowl with a 28-9 victory over San Jose State in the Pasadena Bowl. The game marked Murphy's final appearance as a head coach, and he transitioned fulltime to athletics director, a role he had started in 1966 and held until 1981.\n\nMurphy grew up in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, before enrolling at Mississippi State in 1939 and playing as an All-SEC tailback for future College Football Hall of Coach Allyn McKeen who had previously headed the Memphis program. In 1943 and the midst of World War II, Murphy joined the Marine Corps Reserve and transferred to Duke University for training with the V-12 Program. He served heroically in the South Pacific, narrowly escaping with his life on at least four occasions and receiving the Bronze Star, the Presidential Citation and the Navy Citation. Following World War II, Murphy returned to Mississippi State as the captain of the 1946 Bulldogs team.\n\nAfter graduating from Mississippi State, Murphy took his first job as an assistant coach at Memphis for a five-year stint. In 1951, he returned to Mississippi State under head coach Murray Warmath who he then followed to Minnesota in 1954 for four seasons as the running backs coach before becoming the Memphis head coach at the age of 37 in 1958. Murphy has been inducted into the State of Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, the Mississippi State Hall of Fame and the Memphis M Club Hall of Fame. Each year the Billy J. Murphy Award is presented to a former Memphis athlete who has excelled in their chosen profession after graduation, and the Tigers' practice facility is named in Murphy's honor.\n\nGARY PINKEL\n\nUniversity of Toledo (1991-2000), University of Missouri (2001-15)\n\nHead Coach, 191-110-3 (63.3%)\n\nStanding at No. 20 for most wins in Football Bowl Subdivision history at the time of his retirement, Gary Pinkel's legacy as the winningest coach in school history at both Toledo and Missouri makes him one of only three coaches to hold the distinction at two Division I programs. He becomes the first coach from Toledo and the sixth coach from Missouri inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nPinkel began his head coaching career at Toledo in 1991 and during the next 10 years he would take the Rockets to new heights, winning 65.9 percent of his games and amassing a 73-37-3 record, the most wins in school history. His nine winning seasons at Toledo included the 1995 MAC championship, with the Rockets going 11-0-1 and finishing at No. 24 in the final polls. Pinkel would lead Toledo to three other MAC West Division titles. In 1997, the Rockets finished 9-3, climbing as high as No. 18 in the national rankings. They repeated as division champions again in 1998 with a 7-5 record. In his final season with the Rockets in 2000, the team went 10-1, including a 24-6 win at Penn State. The team finished the regular season with the MAC West Division title and ranked No. 25 in the AP Poll. He was named the MAC Coach of the Year in 1995 and 1997.\n\nPinkel took over at Missouri in 2001, inheriting a program that had produced just one 10-win season in school history and two winning seasons in the previous 17 years. Pinkel would transform the program, leading the Tigers to 10 winning seasons (including five years with 10 wins or more), five conference division titles, 10 bowl appearances and six bowl victories. The end result: an overall record of 118-73 and the distinction of being the school's all-time winningest coach.\n\nPinkel's Missouri teams posted final top-20 national rankings five times, including AP rankings of No. 4 in 2007 and No. 5 in 2013. In 2007, he was named the National Coach of the Year by FieldTurf, and he won conference coach of the year honors in 2007 (Big 12) and 2014 (SEC). In 2007, Mizzou claimed the school's first No. 1 national ranking since 1960 after a watershed 36-17 win against archrival Kansas in the Border Showdown at Arrowhead Stadium on Nov. 24, 2007. The Tigers subsequently fell short against Oklahoma in the Big 12 title game, but the team ended the season with a school-record 12 wins, including a win in the Cotton Bowl and a No. 4 final national ranking.\n\nPinkel's finest year may have come in 2013, one year after Mizzou joined the SEC. Picked to finish sixth in the SEC Eastern Division, the Tigers finished 11-1 as East Division champs, and they gave Pinkel his second victory in the Cotton Bowl and his second 12-win season along with a final No. 5 ranking in the national polls. Pinkel would lead the Tigers back to the SEC Championship Game in 2014, falling short against Alabama. The team finished the season with a win against Minnesota in the Citrus Bowl and an 11-3 record and No. 14 ranking in the AP Poll.\n\nAfter his final game in 2015 and announcing his retirement because of a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Pinkel ranked as the third-winningest active coach behind future College Football Hall of Fame inductees Frank Beamer of Virginia Tech and Bill Snyder of Kansas State. Pinkel also is one of only three coaches in history to be the winningest coach of two college football programs, joining College Football Hall of Fame inductees Bear Bryant (Kentucky, Alabama) and Steve Spurrier (Florida, South Carolina). Pinkel coached 10 First Team All-Americans, three Academic All-Americans, three NFF National Scholar-Athletes and 79 first team all-conference players.\n\nPrior to becoming a head coach, Pinkel was an all-conference and Honorable Mention All-America tight end at Kent State, playing for future College Football Hall of Fame Coach Don James. Pinkel worked as an assistant under James at Washington for 12 years, including the Huskies' 1991 national championship team. He also served as an assistant at Kent State and Bowling Green.\n\nPinkel has been inducted into multiple halls of fame, including the State of Missouri Sports, St. Louis Sports Commission, Mid-American Conference, Toledo Athletics, Kent State Athletics and Kenmore High School. Active in the community, he created the GP Made Foundation to help youth facing difficult challenges and he has raised more than $10 million for charitable causes. In 2017, Pinkel released an autobiography \"The 100-Yard Journey: A Life in Coaching and Battling for the Win.\"\n\nAbout The National Football Foundation & College Hall of Fame\n\nFounded in 1947 with early leadership from General Douglas MacArthur, legendary Army coach Earl \"Red\" Blaik and immortal journalist Grantland Rice, The National Football Foundation & College Hall of Fame is a non-profit educational organization that runs programs designed to use the power of amateur football in developing scholarship, citizenship and athletic achievement in young people.
