        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - Why?\n\nThat has to be your first question.\n\nWhy did the University of North Alabama board of trustees vote Monday to move the school's athletics programs from Division II to Division I, which will put its football team in the Football Championship Subdivision?\n\nWhy pony up an NCAA-mandated entry fee of $1.42 million by next June 1, ratchet up student fees and hit up local businesses for more money to make the jump?\n\nWhy give up the school's close ties with Division II, from playing host to the national championship game to giving out the Harlon Hill Trophy, the DII Heisman, named after a former UNA player?\n\nThere are a lot of reasons, but none of them offers a more graphic example than the road game UNA football will play Sept. 17.\n\nThe opponent: Abilene Christian.\n\nThe occasion: A triple-header known as the Lone Star Football Festival.\n\nThe location: Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, aka Jerry World.\n\nSound like fun? Try taking your team on a bus ride of 12 or 13 hours to play a game. Try doing it on a regular basis during the regular season. That would be the future of UNA football if the Lions were to stay in Division II, which is quickly becoming a memory in the Deep South.\n\nWhen the six Arkansas-based members decided to abandon the Gulf South Conference, leaving behind only five football-playing schools in the GSC, the choice for UNA became clear.\n\nFind a new home.\n\nSome of you, no doubt, are thinking that this is a Terry Bowden production, that the UNA coach pushed buttons and pulled strings to get back on a bigger stage.\n\nBowden said not so. He said he wasn't asked about this move when he interviewed for the UNA job 21/2 years ago. He wasn't present at Monday's press conference, after the trustees meeting, to discuss the move.\n\nKevin Scarbinsky is a columnist for The Birmingham News. His column is published on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\"They've been working on this for years,\" he said on the phone Monday afternoon. \"I wasn't a part of the process. It's important I wasn't a part of the process. If I wanted to be at a different level, I would go do that. This is something UNA decided to do for UNA.\"\n\nBowden has had some success during his first two years back on the sideline at North Alabama. His first UNA team went 11-2, reaching the quarterfinals of the Division II playoffs. Last season, the Lions finished 9-4 after losing in the second round.\n\nThat's nice, but consider the competition.\n\n\"If you're going to do anything in this state, you have to win a national championship,\" he said. \"By that standard, we haven't done much in my time here.\"\n\nPerhaps, but you don't have to be Alabama or Auburn to accomplish something in this state. Look at the success Troy has enjoyed in the Football Bowl Subdivision in the Sun Belt. Look at Jacksonville State in the FCS.\n\nBowden has. If there's a role model for North Alabama in making this move, from a football standpoint, it's old Gulf South rival Jax State.\n\nIt's likely that UNA will join JSU in the Ohio Valley Conference. One of the new NCAA requirements for moving up to Division I is membership in a conference, and the OVC makes the most sense for UNA.\n\nBowden already has talked to JSU coach Jack Crowe about scheduling a home-and-home series as soon as possible.\n\n\"He loves the idea,\" Bowden said with a laugh. \"He's got the upper hand.\"\n\nNorth Alabama has to make the transition from 36 scholarships in Division II - all of them partial scholarships - to 63 scholarships in Division I-AA.\n\nBowden believes becoming the 10th Division I school in the state should help the Lions recruit beyond their home in the Shoals area. He's also looking forward to cutting back on transfers, which have become a major part of his UNA roster.\n\n\"It'll be nice to start from scratch with high school guys and build them up,\" he said.\n\nOne of the things he doesn't have to give up is playoffs. The FCS determines its champion on the field, as Bowden knows first-hand. He took Samford from Division III all the way to the 1991 Division I-AA semifinals.\n\nHe lost to Youngstown State and some coach named Jim Tressel. They were both on the way up then.\n\nOnly Bowden is now."
