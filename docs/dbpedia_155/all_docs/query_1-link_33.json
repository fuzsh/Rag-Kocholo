        "text": "The resurgence of the ULM football program began on Dec. 23, 2020, when Terry Bowden became the University’s 16th head coach.\n\nBowden brought with him a reputation as a program builder from his previous head-coaching tenures at Salem, Samford, Auburn, North Alabama and Akron. He has only enhanced that track record after his first season in Monroe, leading the biggest turnaround in the Sun Belt Conference as the Warhawks went from 0-10 in 2020 to 4-8 in 2021, including wins over Jackson State, Troy, Liberty and South Alabama. A 32-point underdog against Liberty, ULM’s 31-28 victory over the Flames ranks among the top five upsets in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision since 2000. The Warhawks, who never led in a game during the 10-game 2020 season, managed to hold a lead in eight of 12 games last fall. Bowden has compiled a career record of 179-122-2 (.594) in 26 seasons as a collegiate head coach. His 179 career wins rank sixth among the winningest active NCAA FBS head coaches, trailing only Alabama’s Nick Saban (269), North Carolina’s Mack Brown (266), LSU’s Brian Kelly (263), Iowa’s Kirk Ferentz (190) and Tulane’s Willie Fritz (185)."
