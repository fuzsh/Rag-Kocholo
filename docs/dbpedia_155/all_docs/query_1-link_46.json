        "text": "■ Terry Bowden has taken over a limping Auburn program hammered by NCAA sanctions and down-and-out teams at Salem College and Samford. All three times, he engineered turnarounds.\n\nNow Bowden, 52, a longtime broadcaster, returns to the sidelines at Division II power North Alabama with designs on his first championship and no delusions that he's stepping into a low-pressure environment.\n\nThe Lions have four consecutive seasons with at least 10 wins and are coming off a national semifinal appearance. Mark Hudspeth left to become an assistant under Dan Mullen, the new Mississippi State coach.\n\nBowden has been out of coaching for a decade and is currently a broadcaster for Westwood One Radio and a college football writer for Yahoo Sports. He also does a heavy slate of speaking engagements, including about 75 in 2008, Bowden said.\n\nLast year, he interviewed at his alma mater, West Virginia, to replace Rich Rodriguez. By the time assistant Bill Stewart was promoted to the job last January, it was too late to apply for other openings.\n\n■ Texas coach Mack Brown was rewarded for his 11-win season and No. 3 ranking when he was honored as the 2008 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year at halftime of the Chick-fil-A Bowl on Wednesday night.\n\nThe award was established in 1976 to honor the Division I coach \"whose program represents the highest ideals on and off the field.\"\n\nAccording to the Bobby Dodd Foundation, the award is designed to honor a coach who enjoys a successful season while also stressing the importance of academic excellence and character as Dodd, the Georgia Tech coach for 22 years.\n\nPrevious winners vote on the award, along with a panel selected by the Bobby Dodd Foundation.\n\nBrown guided Texas (11-1) to a spot in the Fiesta Bowl against Ohio State on Monday. Brown is 114-26 at Texas.\n\n■ Tulsa coach Todd Graham has agreed to a new 10-year contract that could keep him with the Golden Hurricane through the 2018 season.\n\nTerms of the contract weren't disclosed by the private university.\n\nGraham, who has coached Tulsa to its first back-to-back 10-win seasons in school history, agreed to the extension two days after offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn left Tulsa to take the same position at Auburn.\n\nThe Golden Hurricane (10-3) is scheduled to face Ball State (12-1) in the GMAC Bowl on Tuesday.\n\nGraham was Tulsa's defensive coordinator under Steve Kragthorpe for three seasons before his one season as Rice's head coach. He has led the Golden Hurricane to back-to-back Conference USA West titles, losing in the league title game both years.\n\n■ Cal coach Jeff Tedford is staying put for now.\n\nTedford has agreed to a two-year contract extension that takes him through the 2015 season. Athletics Director Sandy Barbour announced the deal yesterday.\n\nThe Golden Bears completed a 9-4 season on Saturday by beating Miami 24-17 in the Emerald Bowl. It was Cal's fifth victory in a school-record six consecutive bowl appearances under Tedford.\n\nTedford joined Cal in December 2001 and has a 59-30 record over seven seasons.\n\n■ Rocky Long, the former coach at New Mexico, was hired as defensive coordinator by San Diego State on Wednesday.\n\nLong resigned at New Mexico on Nov. 17 after 11 seasons as the Lobos' head coach.\n\nNew Aztecs coach Brady Hoke also hired Al Borges as offensive coordinator. Borges most recently helped lead Auburn to a 42-9 record and four bowl game appearances from 2004-07.\n\nThe last time Long and Borges were coordinators on the same staff was at UCLA in 1997, when the Bruins went 10-2, won the Pac-10, advanced to the Cotton Bowl and finished fifth in the final AP poll.\n\n■ The next time Colt McCoy wants to change a play at the line of scrimmage, he might consider singing it and what octave he wants to do it in.\n\nIt turns out that McCoy, the Texas Longhorns' quarterback, has a pretty good voice to go along with his accurate right arms. When he was younger, McCoy used to occasionally perform with The McCoy Family Singers, a gospel a cappella group founded by his grandfather.\n\nNot that he likes to talk about being a crooner, nor was he willing to sing a tune for reporters at the Fiesta Bowl upon request on Wednesday.\n\n\"I knew that was going to come up at some point,\" McCoy said. \"The story finally got out. I can't believe it.\"\n\nMcCoy said he's a tenor and started singing with the family group as a child when it performed at churches, weddings and other events. McCoy is on one of the family's 11 albums, singing Jesus Loves Me with a group of children when he was 5 years old, his grandmother said.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
