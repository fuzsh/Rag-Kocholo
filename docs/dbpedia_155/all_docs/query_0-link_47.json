        "text": "Location: Tuscaloosa, Ala.\n\nNickname: Crimson Tide.\n\n2008 Countdown ranking: No. 25.\n\nWhat I said in last year’s preview:\n\nAfter what the team showed down the stretch in 2007, it wouldn’t be a stretch to predict the Tide to finish with a matching seven-win season. However, I predict Alabama takes its first step forward this fall. This is partly because of an experienced offensive line and Wilson’s potential improvement, and, though linebacker is a concern, another strong defensive unit. Mostly, it’s because of Saban, who has done nothing on the college level to expect anything less than an at least one-win improvement over last fall. So that’s where the Countdown predicts Alabama to fall: 8-4 over all, 5-3 in conference, with a loss at Georgia and only one win out of the trio of Tennessee, L.S.U. and Auburn. More so than the other top programs on hard times, Alabama is close to a return to glory.\n\nPostseason re-ranking: No. 6.\n\n2008 record and recap: (12-2, 8-0). I thought Alabama would be good, but this good? This soon? You better believe it: The Crimson Tide rose as high as No. 1 in the polls in Nick Saban’s second season, holding that lofty spot for five consecutive weeks to end the regular season, and reached its first B.C.S. bowl game since the 2000 season. Though Alabama finished the season 12-2, the team entered the SEC title game 12-0, the final remaining undefeated team from a B.C.S. conference, and with its best national title shot in 15 years. So a loss to Florida in the SEC championship cost Alabama its championship hopes, and an ugly loss to Utah in the Sugar Bowl revealed some deficiencies; don’t allow that to take away from how far Alabama came in its second season under Nick Saban. Let’s begin on offense, where the Tide scored 70 more points (422) than in 2007. The key? A bruising ground game; Alabama had 234 more carries than passing attempts. But this team was defined by its defense, a fact that should not come as a surprise when considering its coach’s background. Only one team scored more than 21 points on the Tide in the regular season (both U.F. and Utah cracked 30), and Alabama kept nine teams to under 15 points. The story in 2009? Much of the same: Expect a solid defense to combine with a run-first offensive mentality to yield similar results in the win column.\n\nHigh point: The perfect regular season, obviously. The best moments, in chronological order: a 34-10 stomping of Clemson in the season opener (Alabama’s way of saying hello to the F.B.S.), a 31-0 halftime lead over Georgia, a 27-21 overtime victory over L.S.U. and a 36-0 whitewashing of rival Auburn. The win over its neighbors to the southeast was Alabama’s first in seven years.\n\nLow point: I didn’t see the SEC Championship Game loss as disappointing, though, of course, it did cost Alabama a shot at the national championship. But despite heading into the game ranked No. 1 nationally, most knew that the Tide were not as good a team as were the Gators. That Alabama played U.F. so close, nearly pulling it out, made it one of my favorite games of the season. Not even CBS constantly embarrassing itself with its blatant pro-Florida slant could ruin it for me. The Sugar Bowl was nothing if not a disappointment, as Utah took a 21-0 lead in the first 11 minutes and never looked back.\n\nTidbit: The regular season saw Alabama face 11 different running backs who averaged at least 50 yards on the ground per game; each player was held under their season average. Here are a few examples: Clemson running backs James Davis (60.9 yards per game) and C.J. Spiller (55.6) were held to 13 and 7 yards, respectively; Tulane’s Andre Anderson (123.4) was held to 32 yards; Georgia’s Knowshon Moreno (111.5) was held to 34 yards; Mississippi’s Cordera Eason (53.7) was held to six yards; and Mississippi State’s Anthony Dixon (72.4) was held to 26 yards.\n\nTidbit (media edition): Forget about the on-field product, Alabama dominates all comers in this meaningless category: largest media guide. The university’s 2009 version clocks in at an obese 208 pages – a good amount of which, like a glamour magazine (so I’ve heard), is pictures – making it by far the thickest product I’ve come across this summer. Alabama’s spring guide, typically a simple, barebones release, came in at 108 pages. Hey, it’s Alabama, what did you expect?\n\nFormer players in the N.F.L.: 30 – DE Mark Anderson (Chicago Bears), OT Wesley Britt (New England Patriots), DT Anthony Bryant (Giants), C Antoine Caldwell (Houston Texans), CB Simeon Castille (San Diego Chargers), FB Tim Castille (Arizona Cardinals), DT Jeremy Clark (Giants), RB Glen Coffee (San Francisco 49ers), QB Brodie Croyle (Kansas City Chiefs), RB Kenneth Darby (St. Louis Rams), OG Marlon Davis (Cleveland Browns), DE Wallace Gilberry (Kansas City Chiefs), DT Bobby Greenwood (Kansas City Chiefs), DT Cornelius Griffin (Washington Redskins), S Roman Harper (New Orleans Saints), S Rashad Johnson (Arizona Cardinals), LB Jarret Johnson (Baltimore Ravens), CB Anthony Madison (Pittsburgh Steelers), OG Evan Mathis (Cincinnati Bengals), TE Travis McCall (Buffalo Bills), FB Le’Ron McClain (Baltimore Ravens), DE Antwan Odom (Cincinnati Bengals), S Charlie Peprah (Green Bay Packers), CB Ramzee Robinson (Detroit Lions), LB DeMeco Ryans (Houston Texans), OT Chris Samuels (Washington Redskins), OG Justin Smiley (Miami Dolphins), OT Andre Smith (Cincinnati Bengals), CB Deshea Townsend (Pittsburgh Steelers), QB John Parker Wilson (Atlanta Falcons).\n\nTop five N.F.L. players from Alabama: Seven members in the Hall of Fame, five of whom are represented on this list. (Just missing the cut: quarterback Joe Namath and tight end Ozzie Newsome.) So for the second consecutive day, a shake-up on the Countdown’s list. The new top three: Syracuse (no one is going to top the Orange, I’m afraid), Alabama and Notre Dame, in that order.\n\n1. OG John Hannah (New England; 1973-85)\n\n2. WR Don Hutson (Green Bay; 1935-45)\n\n3. QB Bart Starr (Green Bay; 1956-71)\n\n4. C Dwight Stephenson (Miami; 1980-87)\n\n5. LB Derrick Thomas (Kansas City; 1989-99)\n\nTeam\n\nConference: Southeastern, West division.\n\nHead coach: Nick Saban (Kent State ’73), 19-8 after two seasons in Tuscaloosa. In case you had forgotten, Saban is one of the top five coaches in America. He proved this fact last fall, when he led the Tide to a five-win improvement over his 7-6 debut season. Alabama finished the regular season 12-0 – the last undefeated team from a B.C.S. conference – and riding a five-week stint atop the national polls. The Tide were unable to carry that momentum over into the SEC title game and the Sugar Bowl, but the program succeeded in sending a clear message to the rest of the conference: we’re back. I’m excited to see what Saban can accomplish over the next five years, obviously. His experience on the college level includes one season at Toledo (9-2 in 1990), five years at Michigan State (34-24-1 from 1995-99) and five seasons at L.S.U. (48-16) from 2000-4, winning the 2003 national championship. It was during his time with the Tigers that his star began to rise in the coaching ranks. His trip to Baton Rouge was one of the most interesting storylines of 2008, as while his departure from the program was not greeted with disdain, his return to the SEC (the SEC West, specifically) was. His time between L.S.U. and Alabama was spent back in the N.F.L. as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins (2005-6). His two seasons in Miami began well, with Saban leading the Dolphins to a 9-7 mark in 2005. But his team sputtered in 2006 amid injuries and, as the season progressed, growing concern over whether he would return in 2007. His additional experience on the N.F.L. level includes two years as a Houston Oilers assistant (1988-89) and another four as Bill Belichick’s defensive coordinator with the Cleveland Browns (1991-94). It’s plainly obvious that Saban is first and foremost a college coach, and one of this generation’s best.\n\nReturning starters: 13 (4 offense, 9 defense).\n\nKey losses: Alabama returns the overwhelming majority of last season’s contributors, though the team will need to supplant 11 lost starters. Seven of those starters come on offense, including three tremendously talented linemen. The first is the would-be senior Andre Smith, a three-year starter and 2008 first-team all-American. While his career ended on a sour note – being ruled ineligible for the Sugar Bowl – Smith was a revelation from his first day on campus, when he arrived in Tuscaloosa with enormous expectations. He lived up those standards, and then some. Smith’s presence placed center Antoine Caldwell in the background, which was unfortunate; Caldwell was a 48-game starter, two-time captain and a 2008 Rimington Trophy finalist. You can’t overvalue having a solid, experienced leader at center, especially one like Caldwell. The third lost starter on the line was Marlon Davis, a two-year starter at right guard. This trio paced the way for one of the nation’s top lines, a group that allowed only 25 sacks while grinding out 2,585 yards and 32 touchdowns on the ground. The backfield lost its starting quarterback and lead running back. While he was never spectacular, John Parker Wilson was nothing if not steady over his three-year starting career. He departed as the school’s all-time leader in nearly every meaningful statistical category: total offense (8,099 yards), passing yards (7,924), completions (665), attempts (1,175) and touchdowns (47). Unfortunately, Wilson’s statistical excellence did not typically correlate to his team’s won-loss record, and he often struggled with turnovers (30 career interceptions). But he played his best when he was asked to do the least – I don’t mean that in a bad way – as shown in his final season, when he completed 187 of his 323 attempts for 2,273 yards as the team’s second option. The first was the running game, which was led by the would-be senior Glen Coffee. He excelled in his first season as the unquestioned starter, rushing for 1,383 yards (second in school history) and 10 scores en route to first-team all-SEC accolades. He preceded his junior campaign with 545 yards and 4 scores in 2007. Tight end Nick Walker was an important receiving target over his final two seasons, combining to post 55 receptions for 528 yards from 2007-8. While Walker was the receiver, Travis McCall was the blocker. Each complimented the other very well, and each started more than 30 games over their respective careers.\n\nThe Alabama defense lost only two lettermen off last year’s group, both of whom were starters. The first was safety Rashad Johnson, who posted a team-best five interceptions in 2008. Johnson earned all-American honors as a senior, when he added 89 tackles (second on the team), a sack and a team-best 11 pass breakups to his sterling interception total. Johnson was also a first-team all-SEC pick as a junior and senior. The only other loss is end Bobby Greenwood, a 22-game starter who led the Tide with five sacks in 2008. He had his best season as a senior, making 40 tackles (7 for loss), but Greenwood was an important member of the line rotation for each of his four seasons.\n\nPlayers to watch: Outside of the offensive line, which I’ll touch on below, no position is under more scrutiny than quarterback. These fears are unfounded: Wilson was a fine college quarterback, but there is no question that the junior Greg McElroy will be just as good as his predecessor, if not better. The only thing McElroy is missing is experience, as the junior has attempted only 20 passes over his career. But McElroy has a deft passing touch, as shown by his 16 completions in those 20 attempts for 196 yards and 2 touchdowns. Can he handle the pressure that comes along with being Alabama’s starting quarterback? Coffee’s departure will lead to the sophomore Mark Ingram being promoted into the starting lineup. He played superbly as the team’s top reserve back last fall, rushing for 743 yards and a team-best 12 touchdowns. He’s capable of putting up some impressive numbers, but the Tide will need to find a second option. That task will likely fall to the senior Roy Upchurch (350 yards, team-best 6.0 yards per carry), though the junior Terry Grant and the true freshman Trent Richardson are also in the mix for carries. The unquestioned star of the offense is the sophomore wideout Julio Jones, owner of the finest debut receiving season in school history: 58 receptions for 924 yards and 4 touchdowns, all best on the team and all Alabama rookie records. If he wasn’t already as a freshman, Jones is one of the top five receivers in the country heading into his sophomore season. I can’t say enough about him: the first superlatives that come to mind are powerful, explosive, athletic, superb. He’ll be joined at receiver by the senior Mike McCoy (16 receptions for 191 yards), but the unit is untested beyond the top pair; it may not need to be.\n\nIt wouldn’t be a stretch to call this Alabama defense the best in the country, nor do I believe it would it be a stretch to say this is the best Alabama defense in 15 years. Let’s just say the unit is stacked, and leave it at that. A defense is only as strong as its middle, and this is where the Tide excel. Leading the way is the senior all-American Terrence Cody, who proved to be utterly unmovable at nose tackle in his debut season. While his numbers were not astounding (24 tackles, 4.5 for loss), his impact on each game cannot be quantified. Cody demands multiple blockers, freeing up Alabama’s ends and linebackers to make plays in space. One example of this fact is the junior middle linebacker Rolando McClain, a third-team all-American, who benefited from having the freedom to run to the ball without battling more than a single blocker. He led the team in tackles (95) and tackles for loss (12) a season ago. Joining him at linebacker in Alabama’s 3-4 set is the sophomore Dont’a Hightower (64 tackles), a freshman all-American in 2008, and the senior Cory Reamer. Reamer, a converted safety, added 36 (6 for loss). Three starters return in the secondary. The most notable is the senior Javier Arenas, who has always excelled in the return game but took a major step forward as a defender in his junior season. He made 63 tackles, 2 sacks and an interception as a 14-game starter (he entered the season with one career start), improving in his technique and over all level of play in each week. But Arenas is truly a difference maker on special teams: the senior averaged 23.6 yards per his 26 kick returns and averaged 15.9 yards per punt return, bringing three punts back for scores. Why would any team do anything but kick it out of bounds? (I’m sure SEC coaches have thought of this.) Kareem Jackson returns at the other cornerback spot, with the seniors Marquis Johnson and Chris Rogers currently serving as the top reserves. Keep an eye on the true freshman Dre Kirkpatrick, who has the talent to make an immediate impact; my only concern is Saban’s likely trepidation when considering the notion of using a true freshman at corner. The senior Justin Woodall had 47 tackles and 4 interceptions as the team’s strong safety last fall. He’ll return to that spot in his final season, while the sophomore Robby Green inherits the difficult job of replacing Johnson at free safety.\n\nPosition(s) to watch: I truly have only one concern with the entire Alabama roster. I think you know what it is: the offensive line. As we saw in the Sugar Bowl, when Alabama entered the game without Andre Smith and suffered an injury that tested its depth, the Tide will live and die on offense based on how it plays up front. As for 2009, while the starting talent may not be as strong as last year, the depth will be improved. That’s a good thing. Two starters are back from last fall: left guard Mike Johnson and right tackle Drew Davis. Johnson, a two-year starter closing in on an Alabama record for games played, is the best of the bunch. He’ll challenge for all-American honors as a senior, though Davis is a fine player in his own right. Both must take on leadership roles as seniors in addition to maintaining their high level of play. Who will step in at the three open positions? It looks like the JUCO transfer James Carpenter at left tackle; Carpenter arrived on campus in time for spring practice, which was huge in terms of his development. The junior William Vlachos will step into a starting role at center, though he has some very big shoes to fill. In somewhat of a surprise, the redshirt freshman Barrett Jones has made a terrific case to start at right guard. Lining up alongside a veteran like Davis will greatly aid Jones’s progression. The two-deep is littered with youngsters. Yes, these sophomores and freshmen are unproven, but the talent is definitely there. Take two of the top reserves at tackle, Tyler Love and D.J. Fluker. Both arrived as consensus top 100 recruits, and while it always takes time for offensive linemen to develop, look for this pair to push for playing time in an effort to provide enough game experience for this pair to step into starting roles in 2010.\n\n2009 schedule:\n\nSept. 5 Virginia Tech (in Atlanta)\n\nSept. 12 Florida International\n\nSept. 19 North Texas\n\nSept. 26 Arkansas\n\nOct. 3 @ Kentucky\n\nOct. 10 @ Mississippi\n\nOct. 17 South Carolina\n\nOct. 24 Tennessee\n\nNov. 7 Louisiana State\n\nNov. 14 @ Mississippi State\n\nNov. 21 Chattanooga\n\nNov. 27 @ Auburn\n\nGame(s) to watch: In order of increased importance: Virginia Tech, Auburn, Mississippi, Louisiana State. So maybe Virginia Tech should be higher; after all, that game could make or break one team’s national title hopes. But the SEC games all count more, especially dates with Mississippi and L.S.U., games that will determine the West division. And Auburn, as always, means more than them all.\n\nSeason breakdown & prediction: Here’s a scary thought: Alabama is deeper than it was a season ago. All that team did was roll through a perfect regular season and nearly play for the national championship. There is no question that this team is equally capable. But back to this depth. The Tide return 55 of its 66 2008 lettermen (that’s 83 percent, give or take a decimal point), as well as add another top five recruiting class. It’s truly amazing to see how quickly Saban has turned over this roster, one he inherited with shockingly little talent when compared to teams past. (How he did so may not be so laudable.) Now, there are a few issues with this team. For starters, we all saw in the Sugar Bowl just how important the Alabama offensive line was to the over all well-being of the offense, as the team struggled mightily without a few of its normal contributors. Quarterback, at least to me, is not much of a concern; Saban does not, and will not in 2009, ask for much from the position, merely to protect the ball and keep opposing defenses honest. If you want the real reason I believe Alabama will again be in the national title hunt, look no further than the defense. Nine starters return off last year’s unit, and I think another year in this system will see even greater improvement in 2009. My final prediction: 11-1, 7-1 in the SEC, and atop the SEC West. I don’t think this team will get by Florida, but I do have the Tide reaching a second consecutive B.C.S. bowl. In case you didn’t know, Alabama’s back.\n\nDream season: Alabama rolls through the regular season with a perfect 12-0 mark. This time, the Tide roll past Florida in the SEC title game.\n\nNightmare season: In a surprise decline, Alabama slides to 8-4, 5-3 in the SEC.\n\nWhere do Alabama fans congregate: There are so many options that I’m limiting myself to four message boards and two blogs. As always, list below those you feel merit mention. The message boards: Tide Fans, Crimson Confidential, Bama Mag and Bama Online. The blogs: Roll Bama Roll and Tide Corner."
