        "text": "Akron has named Terry Bowden head football coach.\n\nBowden resigned as head coach at Division II North Alabama to take his first job at the FBS level since coaching Auburn from 1993-98.\n\nAkron announced the hiring Thursday but won't formally introduce Bowden until a press conference on December 28.\n\nBowden will try to bring the Zips back from two disastrous seasons under Rob Ianello, who was just 1-11 in each of his seasons as Akron's head coach. He was fired November 27.\n\n\"I'm so excited to be a Zip,\" Bowden said. \"With the great resources and the commitment to winning by the administration and community, it's just a matter of time until we build a championship program.\"\n\nBowden, 54, is the 27th head coach in program history. He was an assistant at Akron in 1986 under then-head coach Gerry Faust.\n\n\"We welcome Terry Bowden back to campus. He brings with him an outstanding record of success and a true football coaching pedigree,\" said university president Dr. Luis M. Proenza. \"We know the entire Akron community will support coach Bowden in his mission to cultivate a championship program here.\"\n\nBowden returned to college coaching at North Alabama in 2009 after a 10-year absence, leading the Lions to a combined 29-9 record and three consecutive NCAA playoff appearances.\n\nAt Auburn, Bowden went 47-17-1 and had the best opening five-year run of any head football coach in school history. He became the first collegiate coach in 50 years to win his 100th career game by his 40th birthday.\n\nBowden was also the first coach in FBS history to have an undefeated and untied season in his inaugural year at that level."
