        "text": "It was, perhaps, the strangest time in my career as a sports writer. Twenty-two years later, I look back and shake my head in wonder.\n\nSince this is supposed to be about the 1998 season, let’s get that out of the way first. Auburn started 1-5, losing an astonishing five centers to injury, and Terry Bowden resigned as head coach, walking out on his players. Bill Oliver took over as interim coach and went 2-3 the rest of the season.\n\nAnd now on to my story.\n\nAuburn’s back-to-back games at Mississippi State and at No. 5 Florida were really ugly. Mississippi State won 38-21, and it really wasn’t that close. Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill, smirk on his face, actually interrupted Bowden’s post-game press conference to tell him “congratulations.”\n\nFlorida won 24-3 and ran the ball the entire second half. After the game, Bowden said “I want to thank Coach (Steve) Spurrier for realizing 24-3 was as good as 50-3.” I winced. An Auburn coach thanking another coach for not running up the score? I knew that would not go down well back home.\n\nOn Sunday night, I started making calls to powerful people, four or five of them, and asking about Bowden’s status. Yes, one of those people was Bobby Lowder. The result was that I wrote a column in the Huntsville Times saying that Bowden had to turn this season around or he would likely lose his job.\n\nThe most important point here is this: I made the calls because of my perception that Bowden had put himself in a near untenable situation. No one, not one person, called me. No one suggested I call anyone. No one “planted” anything.\n\nI tried to talk to Bowden before I wrote the column. After his post-practice press conference, I stopped him as he walked down the stairs in the athletic complex. I told him I needed to ask him about something. He said “If it’s not positive, I don’t want to hear it.” I said he needed to hear it. He shook his head and headed down the stairs. I wrote the column.\n\nAll hell broke loose.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bowden called me. He said “I’m ready to listen now.” I told him all I could say was what was in the column, but if he had something to say on the record, I would be happy to report it. He declined. By Friday, Bowden had resigned.\n\nI was excoriated in the Auburn Plainsman by editor Lee Davidson, who would be honored for her reporting. She’d been told Lowder planted the story to get rid of Bowden and she believed it. She never called me once to ask me what happened. I shrugged it off. After all, she was a student. Others who should have known better had their say, too.\n\nAuburn beat Louisiana Tech 32-17 on Saturday. Oliver read the Auburn Creed in his press conference after the game. On Sunday, Charles Goldberg, then of al.com, and I interviewed Bowden at his fishing lake. It was just the three of us.\n\nBowden told us that athletics director David Housel had called him in and asked him if he’d read the story and told him the situation was even worse than the column indicated and that he would not likely be retained after the season.\n\n“I couldn’t sleep the whole night,” Bowden said. “And I could see the fight it was going to be, and to see how the week went, I was not sure I could get through the game, that I could get through Tiger Walk. I just couldn’t see myself getting through that thing. And I thought nobody even knows that I’m crying, trying, dying.\n\n“I couldn’t look at any films from Thursday on, I couldn’t visually focus on the game. I thought it would be a total distraction, that the players didn’t even know what was going on, all I’m doing is dying. The day before you’re the coach at Auburn, and the next day you’re the still the coach but you’re not going to be, and you’re not sure why. I’m still not sure why.”\n\nFor Bowden, it was over at Auburn, but the controversy was just beginning. My motives were questioned. My integrity was questioned. When I talked to Bowden more than 10 years later, he steadfastly refused to believe that the story wasn’t planted. I’m sure he still believes it today.\n\nOliver re-energized Auburn’s football team. The Tigers weren’t very good, but they played hard. They took No. 14 Arkansas to the wire before falling 24-21 and hung with No. 14 Georgia before falling 28-17. They led Alabama 17-0 at Legion Field but couldn’t hang on and lost that one 31-17.\n\nAuburn players wanted Oliver to be the permanent coach. He thought he was going to be the permanent coach, but in the end, the job went to Tommy Tuberville.\n\nAUBURN 1998 RESULTS\n\nVirginia 19, Auburn 0\n\nAuburn 17, Ole Miss 0\n\nLSU 31, Auburn 19\n\nTennessee 17, Auburn 9\n\nMississippi State 38, Auburn 21\n\nFlorida 24, Auburn 3\n\nAuburn 32, Louisiana Tech 12\n\nArkansas 24, Auburn 21\n\nAuburn 10, Central Florida 6\n\nGeorgia 28, Auburn 17\n\nAlabama 31, Auburn 17"
