        "text": "Bobby Bowden, college football royalty, held court prior to the University of Akron football team’s annual kickoff luncheon Friday.\n\nAnd there are some things the patriarch of the Bowden coaching clan and father of Zips coach Terry Bowden does not like about the state of the sport he served as a head coach in seven different decades.\n\nChief among them, the College Football Playoff that goes into effect this year. Designed to eliminate much of the subjectivity involved in selecting who plays for the national championship game, the playoffs will comprise the top four college football teams at the end of the season based on these criteria: “strength of schedule, head-to-head results, comparison of results against common opponents, championships won and other factors.”\n\nBowden bluntly said that he didn’t like it.\n\nThe all-time winning coach in Division I football and winner of two national championships at Florida State University, Bowden said the primary reason is he’s old school.\n\n“I always thought they got one and two right. Really people don’t care about three and four,” he said. “It’s going to give more teams an opportunity to play for the national championship, but I like it the way it was. I’m not sure it’s going to work. Maybe it will turn out better.”\n\nHe said that the new format will do little to quell the controversy often associated with the BCS National Championship Series, which usually had a team that could make a case for playing in the BCS National Championship Game at No. 3.\n\n“Now No. 5 is really upset. No. 5 says we should have been in that dadgum top four,” he said. “That’s what three said. You get the same debate going on down the line.”\n\nAnother topic of debate that gripped college football in recent weeks is the move to grant the Power 5 conferences (Big Ten, SEC, ACC, PAC-12 and Big 12) autonomy. It gave Bobby Bowden a chance to opine about the college game.\n\nThe other conferences — now referred to as the Group of 5 (MAC, AAC, Conference USA, Mountain West and Sun Belt) — essentially attached their fates to the Power 5’s decisions. And some see it as giving them a competitive advantage.\n\n“I don’t like that. I liked it where Boise State had a chance, where smaller schools have a chance,” Bowden said. “Now they’re just [favoring] the rich people, the schools that have it all.”\n\nThe Mid-American Conference took a huge step this week toward ensuring its continued viability with a new ESPN deal. Ultimately, Bowden said that UA can still grow.\n\n“No. 1,” he said. “I think you have to have an administration that wants to and I think they have that here. There is no reason that Akron can’t be as big as any of them. What does Pittsburgh have that Akron doesn’t have?”\n\nAnd how does his son and his coaching staff continue to build a program that will bear the pressure of high expectations this season?\n\n“Just keep recruiting. It has not changed,” he said. “The team with the best players wins unless the coach messes it up. Now, we’ve seen that happen.”\n\nIt’s that homespun humor that Bowden fans will find in a new book that he co-wrote with Steve Bowden, the one son who didn’t join the family football coaching business. Bowden described The Wisdom of Faith as a book that shows how football and faith work hand-in-hand.\n\n“When you’re 84, you’re supposed to write a book,” he said. “So I’m going to try to give my experiences back to these young men and young ladies.”\n\nQuick hits\n\nRight tackle Tommy Brown (Firestone), who transferred from Ohio State, has been penciled in as the Zips’ starting right guard. That is tentative because Brown is still awaiting a hardship waiver from the NCAA. Terry Bowden said he hopes it is cleared up next week."
