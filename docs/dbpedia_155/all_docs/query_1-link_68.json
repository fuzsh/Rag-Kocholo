        "text": "Former Akron and Auburn coach Terry Bowden is the new head football coach at Louisiana Monroe and will embark on his 26th season as a head coach with the Warhawks, the university announced on Wednesday.\n\nBowden, 64, spent seven seasons at Akron before he was fired at the end of the 2018 season, later joining Dabo Swinney's staff at Clemson as a graduate assistant.\n\n\"First of all, I want to thank President Dr. Ron Berry and Athletics Director Scott McDonald for giving me this opportunity to coach at ULM,\" Bowden said in a press release. \"I got introduced to ULM back after the 2015 season when a contingent flew up to Akron and talked to me about the job. They did a great job of selling me on the potential of this program and the commitment they had to turning it around.\n\n\"Although the timing just wasn't quite right, I did remember feeling that with my success at places like this, and my desire to get back down South to a college town very much like Auburn and Clemson, that this was a perfect place for me to be. I felt then that I was the best guy they could find to build a winner at ULM and I still do.\"\n\nBowden replaces Matt Viator, who was fired after the Warhawks failed to win a game this season and didn't lead in any contest. Per The News Star, \"ULM’s final game at Troy on Dec. 17 was canceled because of COVID-19 issues within the program,\" the third time that's happened this season.\n\n\"In terms of our progression, I think in terms of the injuries we’ve had and the kids that have opted out, I think we haven’t really had consistency in terms of getting better each week,\" Viator said earlier this month.\n\nPer reports, Viator had two years remaining on a contract that pays him $350,000 annually. Over the summer, Viator signed an extension through June 2022, meaning ULM will owe him another season on his deal.\n\nTerry is the son of Florida State coaching legend Bobby Bowden.\n\nAfter being fired at Auburn in 1998, he spent a decade as a television and radio analyst before returning to the sideline at North Alabama in 2009. Bowden also coached at Samford, and Salem College."
