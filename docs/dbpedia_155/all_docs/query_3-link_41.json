        "text": "American football coach (born 1951)\n\nNot to be confused with Nick Sagan.\n\nNicholas Lou Saban Jr. ( SAY-bən; born October 31, 1951)[14] is an American sportscaster and former professional and college football coach. He serves as an analyst for ESPN's College GameDay, a television program covering college football. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest football coaches of all time.[15][16][17] Saban served as head coach of the National Football League (NFL)'s Miami Dolphins and at four universities: Louisiana State University (LSU), Michigan State University, the University of Toledo and most famously the University of Alabama, where he last coached from 2007 to 2023.\n\nAs a college football head coach, Saban won seven national titles, the most in college football history.[18] His first came when he led the LSU Tigers to the BCS National Championship in 2003. He then coached the Alabama Crimson Tide to BCS and AP national championships in 2009, 2011, 2012, and to College Football Playoff championships in 2015, 2017 and 2020. He became the first coach in college football history to win a national championship with two different Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) schools since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936.[19] Saban and Bear Bryant are the only coaches to win an SEC championship at two different schools.[20] Saban's career record as a college head coach is 292–71–1.[n 1]\n\nIn 2013, Saban was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.[21] Saban coached four Heisman Trophy winners at Alabama: Mark Ingram II (2009), Derrick Henry (2015), DeVonta Smith (2020), and Bryce Young (2021).[22]\n\nEarly life and education\n\nSaban was born in Fairmont, West Virginia, to Mary and Nick Lou Saban Sr. His father owned a small service station and his mother was a homemaker.[23][24] He grew up with a sister, Dianna, and graduated from Monongah High School in the small community of Monongah, West Virginia, about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Morgantown.[25] Saban is of Croatian ancestry.[26] His paternal grandfather, Stanko Saban, was born in 1895 in Gospić, in the Lika region of Croatia. Stanko emigrated to Portland, Oregon, in 1908, when he was 13 years old. He later married Anna Mihalic, of Croatian-American heritage.\n\nSaban played quarterback on the 1968 West Virginia state championship team.[27] Among his teammates were Kerry Marbury, who went on to star for the West Virginia Mountaineers and play in the Canadian Football League.[28]\n\nOn December 18, 1971, Saban married Terry Constable, also from West Virginia. In 1973, he graduated from Kent State University with a bachelor's degree in business. Saban played defensive back for Kent State under coach Don James. He and a roommate avoided being part of the Kent State shootings, on May 4, 1970, when they decided to eat lunch before walking to the rally area.[29]\n\nIn 1975, Saban earned his master's degree in sports administration from Kent State.[14] Saban's father died during his son's first year of graduate school.[30]\n\nCoaching career\n\nEarly coaching career\n\nSaban had not intended to enter the coaching ranks until Don James hired him as a graduate assistant at Kent State, while Saban waited for his wife to graduate.[31] He later served as an assistant coach in NCAA Division I-A, at several schools: Syracuse in 1977, West Virginia in 1978 and 1979, Ohio State in 1980 and 1981, Navy in 1982, and Michigan State from 1983 to 1987.[32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39]\n\nAfter the 1987 season, Kent State passed over Saban for its vacant head coaching position and hired Dick Crum.[40] Saban was then hired as an assistant for the Houston Oilers in the National Football League.[32]\n\nToledo\n\nSaban began his career as a head coach when he was hired by the University of Toledo on December 22, 1989.[41] Coming off of 6–5 seasons in both 1988 and 1989, the Rockets found quick success under Nick Saban in 1990.[42] With a 9–2 season, Toledo was co-champion of the Mid-American Conference.[43] The two games the Rockets lost that season were by narrow margins: one point to Central Michigan and four points to Navy.[44] While coaching in Toledo, Saban turned down an application from future head coach Urban Meyer, who was looking for any coaching job on Saban's staff.[45]\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nThe following February, Saban resigned as Toledo's head coach after only one season in order to become defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns under head coach Bill Belichick.[46] He remained in that position for four seasons.[47] Saban helped lead the 1994 defensive unit for the Browns that was the best in the NFL in points allowed.[48] Saban later said these four years were the \"worst of my life\".[49]\n\nMichigan State\n\n1995–1997 seasons\n\nSaban became head coach of Michigan State prior to the 1995 season.[50] Michigan State had not had a winning season since 1990, and the team was sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations that were committed under his predecessor and former mentor, George Perles.[51][52][53]\n\nBeginning in 1995, Saban moderately improved Michigan State's fortunes, taking the Spartans to bowl games in each of his first three seasons.[54] From 1995 to 1997, Michigan State finished 6–5–1, 6–6, and 7–5.[55][56][57]\n\n1998 season\n\nOn November 7, 1998, the Spartans upset the No. 1 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes 28–24 at Ohio Stadium.[58] However, even after the upset and an early-season rout of then-highly ranked Notre Dame the Spartans finished 6–6, including three last-minute losses featuring turnovers, defensive lapses, and special-teams misplays, and failed to earn a bowl invitation.[59][60]\n\n1999 season\n\nSaban led the 1999 Spartans to a 9–2 season that included wins over Notre Dame, Michigan, Ohio State, and Penn State. The two losses were routs at the hands of Purdue and Wisconsin.[61] Following the final regular-season game against Penn State, Saban abruptly resigned to accept the head coaching position with LSU.[62] Saban's assistant head coach and successor, Bobby Williams, coached the Spartans to a Citrus Bowl victory over Florida, giving the Spartans an overall record of 10–2 for the 1999 season.[63][64] It was the most wins for the Spartans in a season since 1965, and the Spartans reached their highest ranking since the 1966 team.[65] Future NFL head coach Josh McDaniels served as a graduate assistant on Saban's 1999 coaching staff.[66]\n\nLSU\n\n2000 season\n\nIn November 1999, LSU named Nick Saban as their 31st head football coach.[67][68] In 2000, the Tigers went 8–4 and won the Peach Bowl over Georgia Tech.[69] The season was somewhat marred by several lopsided losses, including a 34–17 loss to the Auburn Tigers, and a 41–9 loss to the Florida Gators.[70]\n\n2001 season\n\nSaban led LSU to a 10–3 record in 2001, including an SEC Championship and a Sugar Bowl victory.[71] After a 35–24 loss to the Ole Miss Rebels, the Tigers finished the year with six straight wins, including a 31–20 win over #2 Tennessee in the 2001 SEC Championship Game, and a 47–34 win over Illinois in the 2002 Sugar Bowl.[72][73][74] It was the first outright SEC championship for LSU since 1986, and the first time the Tigers had won the Sugar Bowl since 1968.[75][76]\n\n2002 season\n\nThe 2002 season opened with high expectations, but a 26–8 loss at the hands of Virginia Tech in the Tigers' season opener raised serious questions about their outlook.[77] However, the Tigers would rebound to win their next six straight, but after a mid-season injury to quarterback Matt Mauck, LSU lost four of its last six games to close the season, including a 21–20 loss at Arkansas, which knocked the Tigers out of the SEC Championship Game.[78][79][80] LSU also suffered a 35–20 loss to Texas in the Cotton Bowl Classic, and finished 8–5.[81]\n\n2003 season\n\nThe 2003 Tigers started the season with five wins, including a 17–10 victory in Tiger Stadium over the defending SEC champion, and then-undefeated, Georgia Bulldogs. LSU lost the following week to Florida, 19–7. After the loss to Florida, LSU did not lose again in the regular season and ended its regular season with a win over the Arkansas Razorbacks to win the SEC West.[82][83] After winning the SEC West, the Tigers defeated the Georgia Bulldogs 34–13 in the SEC Championship Game in Atlanta.[84] They were ranked No. 2 in the BCS standings and advanced to play the BCS No. 1 Oklahoma Sooners in the Sugar Bowl, which was the host of the BCS Championship Game in 2003.[85] The Tigers won the game 21–14. The win gave LSU the BCS national championship.[86] and a 13–1 finish for the season.[82] The 13 wins for LSU set a new single-season record, breaking the mark of 11 wins set by the 1958 National Championship team.[75]\n\n2004 season\n\nLSU finished the 2004 season 9–3, after losing to the Iowa Hawkeyes in the Capital One Bowl 30–25 on a final play touchdown pass.[87] Other losses that season were on the road at Auburn 10–9, and a loss on the road to Georgia 45–16.[88] At the end of the 2004 season, Saban left LSU to coach the Miami Dolphins.[89]\n\nMiami Dolphins\n\n2005 season\n\nSaban accepted the head coaching position for the Miami Dolphins on December 25, 2004.[90] He was the sixth coach in the franchise's history.[91] The Nick Saban era officially kicked off with a 34–10 win over the Denver Broncos in 2005.[92] From there, however, the Dolphins struggled, losing seven of their next nine games to fall to 3–7. The two wins came over the Carolina Panthers and the New Orleans Saints, a game that took place in Tiger Stadium due to Hurricane Katrina.[93] After a frustrating two months, however, the Dolphins would rally late in the season, as they won their final six games, including a 28–26 win to end the season in Foxboro, Massachusetts, over the New England Patriots. The team finished the year with a 9–7 record, and narrowly missed the playoffs in Saban's first season.[94]\n\n2006 season\n\nGoing into the 2006 season, the Dolphins were expected to contend for a playoff spot.[95] The season, however, turned out to be unsuccessful. The Dolphins were considering quarterback Drew Brees, who had just been released from the San Diego Chargers due to a career-threatening shoulder injury and subsequent contract dispute, but instead traded for Daunte Culpepper, who was still recovering from a knee injury from the previous season.[96][97][98][99] Saban later said that the team's decision to pass on Brees was the moment he knew that he would leave the team.[100] Culpepper never fully recovered and was ultimately benched after the fourth game of the season, when the Dolphins lost to the Houston Texans.[101][102] He was eventually put on injured reserve.[103] After starting the season 1–6, however, the Dolphins got hot. They won four straight games, including wins over the Chicago Bears, who were previously unbeaten and made it to the Super Bowl that year, and the Kansas City Chiefs.[104] Suddenly, the Dolphins were back in the playoff hunt at 5–6, but a 24–10 loss the following week to the Jacksonville Jaguars all but ended their playoff hopes.[105] The Dolphins rebounded the following week with a 21–0 win over the New England Patriots, the Dolphins' last victory of the 2006 season.[106] Quarterback Joey Harrington was eventually benched in favor of third-string quarterback Cleo Lemon.[107] The defense ranked as a top-five unit in points and yards allowed.[108] However, the offense was anemic, with the only bright spot being running back Ronnie Brown, who gained over 1,000 rushing yards on the season.[95] The Dolphins lost their next two games to the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets to finish 6–10, Saban's first losing season as a head coach.[95]\n\nOn November 27, 2006, the University of Alabama announced the firing of head coach Mike Shula. Saban was rumored to be at the top of Alabama's wish list, but Saban refused to discuss the job while his NFL season was still underway.[109] During the month of December 2006, Saban was repeatedly questioned by the media about the Alabama job, and he repeatedly denied the rumors in his weekly press conferences, stating on December 21 \"I guess I have to say it. I'm not going to be the Alabama coach.\"[110][111] Saban met with Alabama officials on January 1, 2007,[112] which was shortly after the Dolphins' season-ending loss to the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nAlabama\n\n2007 season\n\nOn January 3, 2007, following a meeting with Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga, Saban announced that he had accepted an offer to become Alabama's 27th head coach.[113] His initial eight-year contract totaling US$32 million made him one of the highest-paid football coaches,[114] professional or collegiate, in the United States at the time.[115]\n\nOn January 4, 2007, at a press conference on the Alabama campus, Saban was officially introduced as the head football coach of The University of Alabama.[116] On September 1, 2007, his Crimson Tide opened the season with a 52–6 win over the Western Carolina Catamounts, scoring more points than during any game in the 2006 season.[117] Saban became the fifth Alabama coach since 1900 to start his first season 3–0, earning a win over then-ranked No. 16 Arkansas Razorbacks.[118] Alabama ended the regular season with a 6–6 record, including a four-game losing streak, a particularly humiliating loss at home to Louisiana-Monroe, and a sixth straight loss to Auburn in the Iron Bowl. All six of Alabama's losses were by seven points or fewer.[119][120][121] The Crimson Tide defeated Colorado in the 2007 Independence Bowl, 30–24, to end the year 7–6.[122][n 1]\n\n2008 season\n\nDuring his second year as head coach of the Tide, Saban led his team from a sub-par season in 2007 to a perfect 12–0 regular season record. Saban finished the regular season undefeated for the first time in his career as a head coach as he led the Crimson Tide to its first undefeated regular season since 1994.[123] He appeared on the September 1, 2008, cover of Forbes magazine as \"The Most Powerful Coach in Sports.\"[124]\n\nHis second season as Alabama head coach began with a 34–10 victory over the No. 9 ranked Clemson Tigers in the Chick-fil-A College Kickoff in the Georgia Dome.[125] Alabama won the next two games against Tulane and Western Kentucky before entering SEC play.[126][127] In the following game, Alabama had a convincing 49–14 road-win over Arkansas.[128] The Tide followed that victory with a 41–30 win over the No. 3 ranked Georgia Bulldogs.[129] After the Georgia game, the Tide won consecutive home games against the Kentucky Wildcats and the Ole Miss Rebels and finished the month of October with a 29–9 victory over the Tennessee Volunteers.[130][131][132] Following a 35–0 homecoming victory over Arkansas State, the Crimson Tide rose to No. 1 in all major polls in Week 10‍—‌following a loss by No. 1 Texas to the Texas Tech Red Raiders.[133][134] It was the first time since the 1980 season that Alabama held the top spot during the regular season.[135]\n\nThe Tide took their No. 1 ranking into Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and came out with a 27–21 overtime victory over LSU.[136] With the win, Alabama clinched its first SEC Western Division championship since 1999 and guaranteed the team a trip to the 2008 SEC Championship Game.[137] The Tide then improved to 11–0 with a win at home over Mississippi State.[138] To finish the regular season, Bama defeated in-state rival Auburn, 36–0, the largest margin of victory in the series since 1962. It was Alabama's first victory over Auburn since the 2001 season.[139] In the SEC Championship Game, Alabama suffered its first defeat in a 31–20 loss to the SEC Eastern Division champion Florida Gators (who later won the 2008 BCS Championship), and closed out the season with a 31–17 loss to Utah in the Sugar Bowl[140][141] to finish the season at 12–2.[142] For his efforts during the season, Saban received several Coach of the Year awards.[143][144][145]\n\n2009 season\n\nNo. 5 Alabama began Saban's third year by defeating the No. 7 ranked Virginia Tech Hokies in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, 34–24.[146] The Crimson Tide followed up with wins over Florida International and North Texas.[147][148] The following week Alabama won its conference opener over Arkansas, 35–7.[149] In its fifth game of the year, Alabama beat Kentucky, 38–20.[150] The sixth game of the season featured a hard-fought defensive battle with Bama defeating Ole Miss, 22–3.[151] The seventh game was the same as Alabama defeated the South Carolina Gamecocks, 20–6.[152] The next day, Alabama moved up to No. 1 in the AP poll for the second straight year.[153] The next week Alabama defeated Tennessee 12–10.[154] Terrence Cody blocked Tennessee's game-winning field goal attempt with four seconds left, sealing the victory and improving the team's record to 8–0.[155]\n\nAfter a bye week, Alabama clinched its second straight SEC West Division championship by knocking off LSU, 24–15.[156] The next week Alabama defeated Mississippi State, 31–3, securing the second straight 10-win season for Alabama.[157] Following a 45–0 shutout of Chattanooga, on Black Friday, Alabama came from behind to defeat Gene Chizik's Auburn Tigers, 26–21, marking the first time since 1973–1974 Alabama had finished the regular season undefeated in consecutive years, and the first consecutive 12-win seasons.[158][159][160] The Crimson Tide defeated the Florida Gators in the SEC Championship, 32–13, in a rematch of the previous year's championship game.[161] The championship represented Alabama's 22nd SEC title and its first since 1999.[162] Saban's Crimson Tide ended the season with a 37–21 victory over the Texas Longhorns in the 2010 BCS National Championship Game to finish a perfect 14–0 to give Alabama their first National Championship since 1992.[163][164][165] The 2009 Crimson Tide set a school record for single-season victories with 14.[166] The win secured Saban's second national championship and Alabama's 13th, and its first in the BCS era.[167][168] At the on-campus celebration, Saban famously stated \"I want everybody here to know, this is not the end. This is the beginning.\"[169] Following the victory over the Longhorns, the University of Alabama announced that it would unveil a statue of Saban in the week prior to the kickoff of the 2010 season.[170] On April 16, 2011, a life-sized bronzed statue of Saban was unveiled at the 2011 A-Day spring game, making him Alabama's fifth coach to be immortalized outside the north end zone of Bryant–Denny Stadium.[171]\n\n2010 season\n\nAt the start of his fourth season, Alabama was overwhelmingly chosen as the preseason No. 1 team in both the AP and Coaches Poll.[172] It was the first time since 1978 that the Crimson Tide started the season ranked No. 1.[173] In the season opener in front a record crowd of 101,821, Alabama defeated San Jose State, 48–3.[174][175] The following week, the Tide defeated Joe Paterno and the #23 Penn State 24–3 in their first meeting since 1990.[176][177] The next week against Duke, Mark Ingram II made his first start of the 2010 season leading Alabama to a 62–13 victory.[178] The next week Alabama overcame a 20–7 deficit to win its conference opener against #10 Arkansas, 24–20.[179] On October 2, Alabama defeated #7 Florida 31–6.[180] The following week Alabama lost to #19 South Carolina 35–21, snapping a 19-game win streak.[181]\n\nAlabama bounced back with a 23–10 win over Ole Miss, and followed that up with a 41–10 victory over Tennessee.[182][183] After a bye week, Alabama suffered its second loss of the season, losing to #10 LSU, 24–21.[184] The following week, Alabama bounced back at home defeating #17 Mississippi State, 30–10.[185] The following week Alabama defeated Georgia State 63–7, the most points for Alabama since 1979.[186] In the Iron Bowl, Alabama lost to in-state rival (and eventual BCS champions) #2 Auburn 28–27, snapping a 20-game home winning streak.[187] In winning the game, Auburn overcame a 24–0 second quarter Alabama lead, thus marking the largest deficit any team had overcome to defeat the Crimson Tide in its football program's history.[188] Alabama was selected to play in the 2011 Capital One Bowl and in their first-ever meeting, Alabama defeated #7 Michigan State 49–7 in the largest margin of victory in that bowl game's history.[189][190] The bowl victory brought Alabama to 10–3 on the season and secured Alabama's third consecutive 10-win season.[191]\n\n2011 season\n\nAt the start of his fifth season, Alabama came into the season ranked No. 2 in the country in the AP Poll and Coaches Poll.[192][193] In the first game of the season, Alabama defeated Saban's alma mater Kent State 48–7.[194] The next week, Alabama traveled to Penn State for the first time since 1989 and defeated Joe Paterno and #23 Nittany Lions 27–11.[195][196] Alabama recorded its first shutout of the season by defeating North Texas 41–0.[197] In the conference opener, Alabama defeated #12 Arkansas 38–14.[198] The next week Alabama traveled to The Swamp and defeated the 12th-ranked Florida Gators 38–10.[199] The following week at homecoming, Alabama shut out Vanderbilt, defeating them 34–0.[200] Alabama traveled to Oxford and destroyed Ole Miss 52–7.[201] In week 8, Alabama defeated their rival Tennessee 37–6 by scoring 31 unanswered points in the second half.[202] After a bye week, Alabama played host to #1 LSU, losing in overtime 9–6, a Game of the Century matchup between conference teams ranked No. 1 and No. 2.[203]\n\nAlabama rebounded the next week after struggling in the first half, with a win over Mississippi State 24–7.[204] The next week, Alabama defeated FCS 3rd ranked Georgia Southern 45–21 on Senior Day.[205] This win gave Saban his fourth consecutive 10-win season, tying Bear Bryant from 1977 to 1980.[123] In the Iron Bowl, Alabama defeated Auburn 42–14.[206] On December 4, Alabama was selected to face LSU in the BCS National Championship Game by finishing No. 2 in the final BCS rankings, the first time in college football history that two teams from the same conference (much less the same division of the same conference) played each other for the BCS Championship.[207] In the rematch, Alabama defeated the Tigers 21–0 with a dominating defensive performance, improving Saban's record to 3–3 against Les Miles and his former employer, LSU.[208] The win secured Saban his third BCS Championship, his second with Alabama, and the 14th National Championship for the Alabama football team.[209][210] He is the only coach in college football to win three BCS Championships and the first coach since Nebraska's Tom Osborne to win three National Championships.[211]\n\n2012 season\n\nAt the start of his sixth season, Alabama came into the season ranked No. 2 in both preseason polls for the second consecutive year.[212] Alabama opened the season at Cowboys Stadium against #8 Michigan in the first meeting between the schools since the 2000 Orange Bowl with Alabama winning 41–14.[213][214] The next week, Alabama moved up to No. 1 in both polls, marking the fifth consecutive year the Tide reached the top spot.[215] A few days later, Alabama shut out Western Kentucky 35–0.[216] Alabama opened up conference play the next week by routing
