        "text": "Football 1/6/2013 5:03:00 PM By Lindsey Olsen, MSU athletic media relations\n\nWright Named D-Line Coach & Recruiting Coordinator at MSU\n\nMOREHEAD, Ky. -- Dontae Wright, who brings Division I playing and coaching experience, has been hired as the Morehead State football defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator.\n\n“The future is certainly bright with someone like Dontae on our staff,” Head Coach Rob Tenyer said. “Dontae is originally from Eastern Kentucky and has strong recruiting ties to our service region. He will do a great job with our defensive line and in his role as recruiting coordinator.”\n\nWright comes to Morehead State from Division III school Centre College (Ky.), where he helped the Colonels to a 6-4 record and coached three all-conference selections.\n\nWright spent the 2010 and 2011 campaigns as the defensive line coach at Division II school North Alabama. The Lions tallied an 18-7 record and made NCAA Tournament second-round appearances both years. He mentored four all-conference performers and one All-American at UNA.\n\nWright served as a graduate assistant at Southeastern Conference member Kentucky from 2007-09. His first season, Wright worked with the linebackers. His second and third years, he worked with the defensive line. The Wildcats went to two Music City Bowls and one Liberty Bowl in his three years.\n\nAs a player, Wright was part of two Mid-American Conference East Division championship teams at Miami (Ohio). The RedHawks won the conference outright in 2003 and played in the GMAC Bowl, then won a division crown in 2004 and participated in the Independence Bowl.\n\nWright earned four letters at Miami from 2003-06 and earned a bachelor’s degree in physical education from the university in 2007. A teammate of NFL star Ben Roethlisberger at Miami, Wright started at linebacker his senior year and also played on special teams as a RedHawk.\n\n“Dontae played Division I football at Miami, and has learned from some very good college coaches,” Tenyer said. “He worked for former Kentucky Head Coach Rich Brooks and current Akron Head Coach Terry Bowden, who is the son of legendary Coach Bobby Bowden.”\n\nA native of Louisa, Ky., Wright played both quarterback and safety at Lawrence County High School. He rushed for 1,011 yards, threw for 592 yards and totaled 2,306 all-purpose yards. The Bulldogs went 40-10 during his prep career, and he was an all-state selection as a senior."
