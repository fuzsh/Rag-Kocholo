        "text": "Former Auburn head coach Terry Bowden flew down from Akron, Ohio, to entertain the Montgomery Quarterback Club on Tuesday in its final program of the year.\n\nSon of legendary coach Bobby Bowden, Terry played football at West Virginia. He graduated magna cum laude with a degree in accounting before embarking upon a college coaching career as a graduate assistant on his father’s staff at Florida State in 1982. The following year, Bowden became the nation’s youngest head coach at the age of 26 at Salem College in West Virginia. He later followed in his father’s footsteps at Samford (former Howard College) in Birmingham. It was while he was at Samford that Bowden was selected in 1993 to succeed Pat Dye at Auburn.\n\nBowden led the Tigers to a perfect 11-0 season during his first year, becoming the first head coach to go undefeated in his debut season at a Division I school. In 1994, the Tigers finished 9-1-1, establishing the longest winning streak in school history at 20 games. Bowden resigned his position at Auburn in 1998 with a record of 47-17-1. He has just completed his fourth year as Akron’s coach in the Mid-American Conference.\n\nBowden reminded his appreciative audience that he is the only football coach that ever served as a head football coach at three different universities in Alabama — Samford, Auburn, and North Alabama. Reflecting upon his years as a coach, he shared that his father had instilled within him that coaching was a “calling.” He referred to coaching as “planting trees under which you may never sit.”\n\nBowden focused on his three most memorable wins at Auburn. The first was his victory over Alabama in 1993. Auburn was coming off three straight losses to Alabama, and the Tide had won the national championship the previous year. Late in the game, Stan White was injured and carried off the field on a stretcher. Patrick Nix, who had not taken a snap, was put into the game. On a fourth-and-15, Nix lofted a pass to Frank Sanders that led to a score and Auburn held on to win 22-14.\n\nHis second most memorable game was the 38-35 victory over Florida in 1994. Auburn had won 16 straight, but the Gators, coached by Steve Spurrier, were 71/2-point favorites. At halftime, Bowden talked to his dad over the phone and his dad told him, “Just keep doing what you are doing!” Pat Nix threw a pass to Frank Sanders on the last play that won the game.”\n\nHis third most memorable game was Auburn’s 31-29 victory over LSU in 1994. The Tigers were trailing 27-9 in the fourth quarter. LSU threw three interceptions that were returned for touchdowns, and the Tigers defense also covered a fumble in the end zone for another score. The unbelievable thing is that Auburn’s offense did not score a single offensive touchdown, but the Tigers won.\n\nFollowing his tenure at Auburn, Borden said that he needed to get away from college football for a while, and he became a studio host for ABC Sports in New York City where the “Good Morning, America” television show is televised each day. Although he described that experience as “not a bad gig being shown on a jumbo-tron in Times Square and being well paid to watch college football all day,” he keenly felt that he missed the personal touch and felt something was missing in his life. He longed to get back into coaching, and it was then that he accepted the North Alabama head coach position. He has just completed his third season at Akron where his team was one victory short of becoming bowl-eligible.\n\nBowden reminisced about the fond coaching relationships that he has experienced through the years. He recruited Jimbo Fisher to play for him at Salem and later at Samford. Fisher is now Florida State’s head coach.\n\nWhile he was at Auburn, both Jimbo Fisher and Will Muschamp served as student assistants on his staff. Bowden pointed out that Jimbo Fisher and Nick Saban were reared 15 miles from each other in the coal mining area of West Virginia.\n\nAsked about his predictions concerning the college playoff, Bowden responded, “If every team played a perfect game, Alabama with its talent will probably win.”\n\nBowden closed the evening, “The State of Alabama has been very good to me. God has blessed my life so much!”"
