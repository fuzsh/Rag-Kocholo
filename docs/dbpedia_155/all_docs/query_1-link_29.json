        "text": "Terry Bowden is about to become a college football head coach again, according to a new report.\n\nAdam Hunsucker of the Monroe News-Star reports that Louisiana-Monroe is expected to announce Bowden as its new head football coach on Wednesday.\n\nThe former Auburn head coach, who turns 65 in February, has spent the past two seasons in a graduate assistant role at Clemson on Dabo Swinney’s staff. The son of Florida State legend Bobby Bowden, Terry’s head coaching experience spans multiple decades with stops at Salem, Samford, Auburn, North Alabama and Akron.\n\nDuring Bowden’s Auburn tenure (1993-98), the Tigers went 47-17, including a 30-14-1 mark in SEC play. Auburn was ineligible for postseason play, including the SEC Championship Game, during Bowden’s first two seasons when AU posted a 20-1-1 record. The Tigers went to three straight bowl games from 1995-97 as Bowden’s squad posted a 26-11 mark. Bowden resigned during the 1998 season facing criticism for multiple off-the-field issues and a 1-5 start.\n\nAfter resigning from Auburn, Bowden was away from coaching and worked as a broadcaster until his return to the sidelines at Division II program North Alabama. Under Bowden, the Lions went 29-9 from 2009-11. Bowden returned to the FBS ranks in 2012 accepting the job at Akron. The Zips were 35-52 in seven seasons under Bowden, making bowl games in 2015 and 2017."
