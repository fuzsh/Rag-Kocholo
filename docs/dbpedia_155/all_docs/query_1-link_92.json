        "text": "Jerry Reese clearly didn’t think Janoris Jenkins was a roll of the dice, a $62.5 million gamble. Reese saw a young man who has matured beyond a checkered past, is an upgrade over Prince Amukamara and an athletic partner in crime opposite Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.\n\nThe general manager of the New York Giants is staking his career on it.\n\nTerry Bowden, the University of Akron head coach, coached Jenkins for one season at North Alabama. He was asked what he would tell Giants fans about their new corner.\n\n“I think he’ll be a cornerback that you put on their best receiver,” Bowden told The Post. “He’s gonna be a cornerback that’s gonna make plays, and off the field, I imagine that they’re gonna find a personality that’s a lot more introverted than they think. A lot more quiet. I don’t think he’ll be the man about town.”\n\nIf you believe that you can get in trouble just as easily in Florence, Ala., and in St. Louis as you can in the Big Apple, then you can sleep peacefully at night.\n\n“His whole goal was to show the NFL he could go to college for a year and not get into trouble and not make any mistakes, and he did that,” Bowden said. “He did a great job when he was with me.”\n\nReese and the Giants are convinced Jenkins is a 25-year-old father of four from small-town Pahokee, Fla., who began the long road back at North Alabama. That’s where he first proved he was no longer the reckless kid with several marijuana arrests while at the University of Florida tarnishing his record. Jenkins vehemently denied smoking pot at North Alabama, which had a zero-tolerance policy.\n\n“His idea of having fun away from practice was playing video games in his room, non-stop,” Bowden said, “as opposed to going out on the town at night and partying and doing all that stuff. You could do that whether you’re in a big town or a small town. If you have an inclination to do that, you’re gonna do it no matter where you are. There was nothing that suggested to me that he wasn’t mature enough to handle the New York City deal … but that is a different world.\n\n“He never flunked a drug test, never got in trouble. He’s not the kind of guy to go out looking for trouble. There are certain guys it seems like you read about they’re always at a club somewhere doing something, doing this. That has not been his personality.”\n\nThe Rams drafted Jenkins in the second round in 2012.\n\n“He’s had four years to live with everything at his disposal, in regard to the wealth, the money, all the fame,” Bowden said.\n\nBowden was asked what he recalls about Jenkins’ cornerback gifts.\n\n“His reaction time,” Bowden said. “His ability to break on a football. To change direction and break on a football. He’s so much quicker at reacting than usually receivers are. When that ball is released, his ability to react and cover ground and react on a football, is incredibly fast. There were times in practice you’d have thought he was the receiver. It seemed like he was running the route that caught the ball because his reaction time was so beyond what I had seen out of other people.”\n\nThere was this one game at Abilene Christian, Bowden said, “He made the tackle, caused a fumble, picked the ball up and ran 60 or 70 yards for a touchdown, and that was the difference in the outcome of the game. In that game, we were clearly one player better than them, and that was Janoris Jenkins.”\n\nBowden was asked to recall the best play Jenkins made for him.\n\n“We played Valdosta State, he returned a kickoff right before the half, and he reversed field about three times, and every single person on the other team missed a tackle at least once, maybe twice, and then he ran out of bounds on like the 2-yard line as time ran out, he couldn’t get to the end zone,” Bowden recalled, laughing. “But it had to be a 15-second kick return … or it might have been a punt return.”\n\nBowden compares Jenkins to linebacker Takeo Spikes, whom he coached at Auburn. “He could have been a star running back, a star receiver or a star cornerback,” Bowden said of Jenkins.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, only two players (Buster Skrine and Patrick Peterson) have allowed more than Jenkins’ 22 touchdowns, but his 10 career interceptions are tied for 12th-most since he entered the league.\n\nReese decided the risk is worth the reward. If Jenkins does not play as anywhere near the second-highest-paid cornerback to Darrelle Revis, the man who acquired him could find himself on Reese Island."
