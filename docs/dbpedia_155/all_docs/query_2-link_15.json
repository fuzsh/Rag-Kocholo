        "text": "The Auburn Tigers college football team represents Auburn University in the West Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Tigers compete as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. The program has had 28 head coaches, and 3 interim head coaches, since it began play during the 1892 season.[1] The Tigers current head coach is Hugh Freeze.[2]\n\nThe team has played more than 1,250 games over 119 seasons.[1] In that time, eight coaches have led the Tigers in postseason bowl games: Jack Meagher, Ralph Jordan, Pat Dye, Terry Bowden, Tommy Tuberville, Gene Chizik, Gus Malzahn and Bryan Harsin. Seven coaches won conference championships: Walter H. Watkins and Mike Donahue won a combined three as a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association; Chet A. Wynne won one as a member of the Southern Conference; and Jordan, Dye, Tuberville, Chizik, and Malzahn won a combined eight as a member of the SEC.[3] During their tenures, Jordan and Chizik each won a national championship with the Tigers.[3][4]\n\nJordan is the leader in seasons coached and games won, with 176 victories during his 25 years with the program.[1] M. S. Harvey and Johnny Floyd have the lowest winning percentage of those who have coached more than one game, with .000.[1] Of the 26 different head coaches who have led the Tigers, John Heisman,[5] Donahue,[6] Jordan[7] and Dye[8] have been inducted as head coaches into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nKey\n\n[edit]\n\nKey to symbols in coaches list General Overall Conference Postseason[A 1] No. Order of coaches[A 2] GC Games coached CW Conference wins PW Postseason wins DC Division championships OW Overall wins CL Conference losses PL Postseason losses CC Conference championships OL Overall losses CT Conference ties PT Postseason ties NC National championships OT Overall ties[A 3] C% Conference winning percentage † Elected to the College Football Hall of Fame O% Overall winning percentage[A 4]\n\nCoaches\n\n[edit]\n\nList of head football coaches showing various statistics and awards[A 5] No. Name Season(s)\n\n[A 6] GC OW OL OT O% CW CL CT C% PW PL PT DC\n\n[A 7] CC NC Awards 1 1892 4 2 2 0 0.500 — — — — — — — — — 0 — 2 1893 1 1 0 0 1.000 — — — — — — — — — 0 — 3 1893 4 2 0 2 0.750 — — — — — — — — — 0 — 4 1894 4 1 3 0 0.250 — — — — — — — — — 0 — 5 † 1895–1899 18 12 4 2 0.722 8 4 2 0.643 — — — — 0 0 — 6 1900–1901 10 6 3 1 0.650 5 2 1 0.688 — — — — 1 0 — 7 1902 5 2 2 1 0.500 2 2 1 0.500 — — — — 0 0 — 8 1902 2 0 2 0 .000 0 2 0 .000 — — — — 0 0 — 9 1903 7 4 3 0 0.571 2 3 0 0.400 — — — — 0 0 — 10 † 1904–1906\n\n1908–1922 146 106 35 5 0.743 65 26 3 0.707 0 0 0 — 2 0 — 11 1907 9 6 2 1 0.722 3 2 1 0.583 — — — — 0 0 — 12 1923–1924\n\n1927 24 7 11 6 0.417 2 9 5 0.281 0 0 0 — 0 0 — 13 1925–1927 21 10 10 1 0.500 6 7 1 0.464 0 0 0 — 0 0 — 14 1928–1929 14 3 11 0 0.214 0 10 0 .000 0 0 0 — 0 0 — 15 1929 4 0 4 0 .000 0 4 0 .000 0 0 0 — 0 0 — 16 1930–1933 39 22 15 2 0.590 12 11 1 0.521 0 0 0 — 1 0 — 17 1934–1942 95 48 37 10 0.558 26 25 7 0.509 1 0 1 — 0 0 SEC Coach of the Year (1935)[14] 18 1944–1947 37 15 22 0 0.405 4 17 0 0.190 0 0 0 — 0 0 — 19 1948–1950 29 3 22 4 0.172 2 18 2 0.136 0 0 0 — 0 0 — 20 † 1951–1975 265 176 83 6 0.675 85 65 5 0.565 5 7 0 — 1 1 – 1957 AP SEC Coach of the Year (1953, 1957, 1972)[14]\n\nUPI SEC Coach of the Year (1963, 1972)[14]\n\nSEC Coach of the Year (1953, 1963, 1972)[14] 21 1976–1980 55 29 25 1 0.536 15 14 1 0.517 0 0 0 — 0 0 — 22 † 1981–1992 142 95 39 4 0.707 43 27 3 0.609 6 2 1 0 4 0 AP SEC Coach of the Year (1987, 1988)[14]\n\nUPI SEC Coach of the Year (1983, 1988)[14]\n\nSEC Coach of the Year (1983, 1987, 1988)[14] 23 [A 8] 1993–1998 65 47 17 1 0.731 28 15 1 0.647 2 1 0 1 0 0 FWAA Coach of the Year (1993)[17]\n\nGeorge Munger Award (1993)[18]\n\nPaul \"Bear\" Bryant Award (1993)[19]\n\nWalter Camp Coach of the Year (1993)[20]\n\nAP SEC Coach of the Year (1993)[14]\n\nInterim [A 8] 1998 5 2 3 — 0.400 0 3 — .000 0 0 — 0 0 0 — 24 1999–2008 125 85 40 — 0.680 49 29 — 0.620 5 3 — 5 1 0 AFCA Coach of the Year (2004)[21]\n\nPaul \"Bear\" Bryant Award (2004)[19]\n\nWalter Camp Coach of the Year (2004)[20]\n\nAP Coach of the Year (2004)[22]\n\nAP SEC Coach of the Year (2004)[23]\n\n25 2009–2012 52 33 19 — 0.635 15 17 — 0.469 3 0 — 1 1 1 – 2010 Home Depot Coach of the Year (2010)[24]\n\nLiberty Mutual Coach of the Year Award (2010)[25]\n\nPaul \"Bear\" Bryant Award (2010)[19]\n\nBobby Bowden National Collegiate Coach of the Year Award (2010)[26]\n\nAP SEC Coach of the Year (2010)[27] 26 [A 9] 2013–2020 102 67 35 — 0.657 38 27 — 0.578 2 5 — 2 1 0 Liberty Mutual Coach of the Year Award (2013)[28]\n\nPaul \"Bear\" Bryant Award (2013)[29]\n\nAssociated Press College Football Coach of the Year Award (2013)[30]\n\nEddie Robinson Coach of the Year Award (2013)[31]\n\nSporting News College Football Coach of the Year (2013)\n\nHome Depot Coach of the Year Award (2013)[32]\n\nSEC Coach of the Year (2013)[33] Interim [A 9] 2020 1 0 1 — .000 — — — — 0 1 — 0 0 0 — 27 [A 10] 2021–2022 21 9 12 — 0.429 4 9 — 0.308 0 1 — 0 0 0 — Interim [34][A 10] 2022 4 2 2 — 0.500 1 2 — 0.333 0 0 — 0 0 0 — 28 [35] 2023–present 13 6 7 — 0.462 3 5 — 0.375 0 1 — 0 0 0 —\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral"
