        "text": "exerpt from wikipedia.\n\nThe next season, after a string of injuries at the center position and disastrous start, Bowden resigned in the middle of the 1998 season the night before Auburn was to play Louisiana Tech. Bowden was given no assurances he would have a chance to remedy the situation for the next season and believed his firing was imminent when he was told that influential and powerful board member Bobby Lowder was promising the head coaching position to someone on Bowden's own staff (Lowder, five years later, played a controversial behind-the-scenes role[4] in a botched attempt to remove Bowden's successor Tommy Tuberville[5]). Bowden had fallen out of favor with Lowder the previous season.\n\nAuburn President, Athletic Director, admit to clandestine meeting with Petrino...\n\nIn a shocking revelation, Auburn President Dr. William Walker and AU Athletic Director admitted late yesterday to having a secret meeting with current Louisville head football coach Bobby Petrino--a full two days before the Iron Bowl!\n\nLouisville Athletic Director forgave Petrino, but lashed out at the Auburn Administration and Athletic Department for their secretive ways.\n\nAuburn has said that they won't make a decision on Tuberville or his future until next week. Seems like the Plainsmen administration is talking out of both sides of their mouths on this one.\n\nAt any rate, it looks like you can put some butter on Tuberville, as he is looking more and more like toast.\n\nBut, the real question remains on the Plains: Who is Auburn going to bring in to coach the Tigers, and at the same time deal with Emperor Bobby Lowder?\n\nBeyond that, is Auburn willing to pay the not only three million dollar buyout on Tuberville's contract to get rid of him, but the buyouts for all of his assistants as well? If Auburn pulls the trigger and Tuberville is axed, it will cost the Plainsmen AD close to 4 million before they ever sign a new coach to a contract.\n\nRumors have swirled around Petrino from the outset of the deathwatch for Tuberville. A new rumor that has been swirling on the internet and on the message boards in the last 24 hours has been that Auburn will even make an overture to the Evil Genius himself...None other than Steve Spurrier!\n\nAuburn was predicted to compete for a national title, and was ranked in the preseason Top 10 in both polls, and the Tigers did face plant right out of the gates on the way to a disappointing 7-5 season, but, is the prospect of an 8 win season on the Plains really that bad?"
