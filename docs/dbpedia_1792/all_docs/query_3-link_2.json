        "text": "BRIDAL VEIL FALLS, OREGON: It was a gloomy morning of early autumn (October, 2015) when I drove to Columbia River Gorge in Oregon to capture some fall colors. I wasn’t going to visit Multnomah Falls or Latourell Falls or Horsetail Falls, because I’ve been there and done those. This time I decided to go somewhere, of course another falls in the gorge, but within short hike…I mean very short. I wasn’t in the mood of lots of walking, but I was in the mood for some yellow, orange, and red leaves. Unfortunately, it was drizzling the whole morning…making my camera wet and hard to work with. But still got to enjoy some quietness there with few other photographers and tourists.\n\nNot too far from Latourell Falls, Bridal Veil Falls is another spectacular site of this gorge in Pacific Northwest of the U.S. The hike is short, perfect for beginners and for any ages. Start your journey to the falls from the Bridal Veil State Park. Parking is ample for the tourists. After few feet of steep but pleasant steps on a winding footpath, I was standing on the wet wooden bridge on Bridal Veil Creek. Did I mention, it is a calm place to enjoy a perfect autumn morning?\n\nAfter the creek I went near the water to get some close up shots. Then came back up towards the ascending stairs to a vantage point with a good view of the falls. From there you can see the tiered falls with the upper falls dropping 60-100 feet and the lower falls dropping 40-60 feet.\n\nI am planning to go back to the gorge again within couple weeks, may be to another falls for more colors. Hope you enjoy these pictures and make a stop here next time you are in Oregon."
