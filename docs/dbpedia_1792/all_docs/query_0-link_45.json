        "text": "Oregon Micro Weddings have become more common since 2020 but for Andrew & Tricialee, they are no less beautiful and wonderful of a wedding day. These two originally had a larger wedding planned but instead of re-planning the entire thing, they kept all their original vendors and every planned moment of their day, and incorporated everything on a smaller scale. This allowed them to keep their Oregon dream venue – Ainsworth House and Gardens – and all the wedding day experiences with their fur-baby and guests, so they didn’t miss out on those precious moments.\n\nAinsworth House and Gardens is a wonderful destination for any wedding whether it be a micro wedding or larger. Centered around Oregon City’s historic Capt. Jon C. Ainsworth House and set in over 2 acres of lush gardens, it is the perfect boutique-sized venue! They offer indoor and outdoor events throughout the year and offer an in-house event coordinator (who we love!) and support staff to walk you through the process of your big day. Highly recommend this venue if you’re looking for a gorgeous garden wedding venue with treed privacy in Oregon City, Oregon.\n\nWe love all our couples and Andrew and Tricialee are one of those couples we will never forget! They are such incredibly kind and beautiful people and remained so even throughout all they endured leading up to their big day. And boy, let me tell you, these two went through it all before getting to their big day. From looking for alternatives to their wedding once COVID restrictions happened, having to get a new wedding dress just two weeks before the big day, to countless hiccups in their wedding planning process in the midst of changing COVID rules – it was anything but smooth sailing for these two.\n\nThankfully, everything came together to form this incredible day that was nothing short of magical. While it was not what these two originally planned on, their day was perhaps even more memorable and meaningful given all circumstances. And with a great team of vendors helping them along the way, the day turned out to be nothing short of amazing!\n\nThe Location: Ainsworth House and Gardens\n\nAinsworth House and Gardens is perhaps best known for the house itself but also the iconic pine tree that towers over the ceremony space. This venue had us all surrounded by natural beauty with elegant and stylish decor. Located just minutes from Oregon’s City hustle and bustle, it’s a nice retreat into nature that is still convenient location-wise. You easily lose yourself in the ambiance of the venue and forget that this lush garden and treed venue is surrounded by residential area.\n\nTheir Day\n\nAndrew and Tricialee booked our two photographer package for their day so nothing was missed. As a wife and husband team, we are able to split up during prep time, capture multiple angles during important moments and provide more photos in your complete gallery. This blog post contains a small selection from their complete gallery. Feel free to ask to see a complete gallery if interested.\n\nFirst Look\n\nFirst looks are always such a beautiful and touching moment to capture. This also can be one of your few times you have alone with your soon-to-be spouse providing an intimate and romantic moment together letting everything sink in as you lay eyes on each other for the first time on your wedding day. Full of so much excitement (and even more butterflies) Tricialee snuck up behind Andrew before tapping on his shoulder for him to see her in her stunning gown, hair and makeup. (A little ‘trick’ or option is that if you are wearing a veil or in this case, a cape, you can choose to add the veil or cape for the ceremony so your partner still has something new to see during the ceremony.)\n\nIncluding Your Fur-Baby\n\nI am all for bringing your pup to your wedding day, I mean how cute is this little guy??? Mikey was such a sweet addition to their day and an absolute must. There was no question, that Mikey needed to be involved one way or another. Mikey is their only child and even came to their engagement session as well. Mikey was so excited for his paw-rents get married!\n\nIf you are interested in including your pup in your own wedding day, we do highly recommend reaching out to Wags and Garland in the Portland, OR area for Wedding Day Pet Care. This is what they do and your fur-baby receives undivided attention leaving you worry free!\n\nCeremony\n\nAndrew & Tricialee customized their ceremony to perfectly match their unique personalities and years together. From writing personal vows to personalizing the wedding script with their officiant Jimmie that included lyrics from a favorite Metallica song and Bob’s Burgers references – it was simply perfect!\n\nReception\n\nWith a large list of ah-mazing vendors, both the ceremony and reception were a whirlwind of beauty and bliss! Everything came together beautifully and there was no shortage of moments and special touches that were unique to Andrew & Tricialee and their specific day. For a full list of all of their wonderful vendors, stay until the end of the post.\n\nCan you guess what song Andrew & Tricialee entered their reception to? That’s right! “Who you gonna call – Ghostbusters!” If this isn’t a perfect example of how to make your wedding day your own, I’m not sure what is. You don’t have to follow any set ‘rules’ or choose things from a list – this is your unique day! Make it awesome! Also love how Tricialee changed into her reception dress to allow for more dance moves!\n\nSparkler Send-off\n\nWas this the dream wedding Andrew & Tricialee originally had in mind pre-2020? No. Was their day amazing and did their specific wishes for the day come true? Yes, aside from having many less loved ones to share it all with. To end the night, you bet sparklers were still happening! And while the guest count might have been low, may I say they were very enthusiastic, loved and helped make this a joyous occasion.\n\nReview\n\n“This is a bit of an emotional review for me, because none of our wedding, NONE of it, would’ve happened if it wasn’t for Ann Marie. She was and is a treasure.\n\nLeading up to our wedding on 9/3/2020, she was our rock for my now husband and I. We booked her a year in advance, and what sold us wasn’t just their style of photography, but our video chat with her and her lovely husband Adam. She answered all our questions and were very straight forward, and they were fellow Metallica fans, big win!\n\nIt’s because of Ann Marie we got THE BEST VENDOR TEAM EVER. She suggested so many of the vendors we hired, from our florist to our videographers to our DJs, and I cannot thank her enough for these suggestions and for being honest with them too. She has been doing this long enough that she remembers and KNOWS who is the best, and I love her so, so much for this.\n\nAnn has been with us the whole way, when we had plans change because of the pandemic and all the chaos that followed. She was the one who calmed us down, reassured us and kept our spirits up. It took us 3 tries to get our engagement photos done, and together as a couple and with Ann, we did the hardest hike of our lives, all the way down to Abiqua Falls and she got my future husband SO relaxed and calm that she was able to capture the best photos ever of the two of us. We couldn’t WAIT for our wedding day after that engagement shoot.\n\nAnn went beyond the call of duty on our wedding day. She was in contact with EVERYONE. She had a timeline that we pretty much all used from the get-go. It was perfectly spaced out and had enough time for any type of screw ups to happen (which did on our wedding day as we showed up 30 minutes late to the venue, but we had planned for any screws up — big tip, fellow brides: ALWAYS ADD BUFFERS). She was there in the bridal suite helping hang up clothes, check our hair, cracking jokes, offering bottles of water, holding things, calming nerves… I mean, WHO DOES THAT?? Even for the reception she was ON it, asking for water for others, checking in with folks, I was like, in awe of her. I’m still in awe of her — and her husband!! Their banter together was the best.\n\nFellow COVID brides, hire Ann and her husband. If you’re an adventurous bride especially who LOVES to hike and want to get the most gorgeous photos Oregon and Washington or anywhere in the PNW has to offer — and it has a LOT to offer. Ann Marie and Adam are the photographers you want. I can’t wait to book them again for our 1 year anniversary and our big ol’ reception and whatever events or photography needs we have in the future. They are the BEST!!”\n\n–Tricialee\n\nNo matter what your wedding dreams are, I love helping our couples have an amazing wedding experience and bring those dreams to life! Granted, some things are out of anyone’s control but we are here to help you out throughout the planning process – no matter how many hiccups you might have along the way. We absolutely love all these amazing vendors that helped make this day possible and cannot recommend them enough as well.\n\nWedding Vendors:"
