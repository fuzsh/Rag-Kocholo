        "text": "Feeding the Merced River in the Yosemite Valley is number of amazing waterfalls. One of the easiest and most visited falls is accessed via the Bridalveil Fall Trail in Yosemite National Park. This towering, impressive drop sends water over 600 feet off the towering granite on the southern side of the Yosemite Valley.\n\nThough you will be having to tend with crowds, this short, family-friendly trail is great to visit. It also only takes a small amount of time, unless you want to relax while you are mesmerized by the cool mist coming from snowmelt high above.\n\nIf you are heading to Yosemite National Park, the Bridalveil Fall Trail is one that you definitely don’t want to miss.\n\nAhead of your trip, be sure to check out our itinerary for Yosemite National Park. We cover the best hikes, what to pack and other places to visit in the area.\n\nPARKING AND TRAILHEAD FOR THE BRIDALVEIL FALL TRAIL\n\nBridalveil Fall Trail parking area, courtesy of the National Park Service\n\nThe Bridalveil Fall Trail is on the southwest portion of the Yosemite Valley. You’ll have to head briefly on the Wawona Road, which is accessed from the Yosemite Valley by first crossing the Pohono Bridge, which is west of the trailhead. Since the road leading to the Wawona Road is one-way, if you happen to be coming from the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center, you’ll have to continue on the Northside Drive until you get to Valley View, where you can cross the Pohono Bridge.\n\nYou can expect plenty of traffic in this part of the park, as it is open to personal vehicles all year (unlike the Yosemite Valley to the east, which is best accessed via the park shuttle during peak visitation months).\n\nAfter you turn east onto Southside Drive, the trail is east about 1 mile from the Pohono Bridge. Take a right at the small fork and head briefly onto Wawona Road before turning left into the parking lot.\n\nDirections from Yosemite Valley Visitor Center to the Bridalveil Fall Trailhead (this is about 6.5 miles and will take between 15 and 30 minutes, depending on traffic).\n\nDirections from El Portal to the Bridalveil Fall Trail (this will take about 20 to 30 minutes, depending on traffic at the entrance).\n\nPlease don’t speed as you drive here. Take in the scenery and keep an eye out for wildlife that frequents the area.\n\nThe parking lot can hold about 60 vehicles. While that may seem like a lot, many people stay in the area for quite some time, making parking during peak months very challenging. Routinely the lot is closed as they allow time for people who already have spots to leave. It’s not rare for it to take 15 minutes to go through the parking lot in the car as you wait for cars to enter and exit in front of you. No kidding. If the lot has a backup, take our advice and come back later in the day or earlier the next day.\n\nThere is minimal parking on the Wawona Road.\n\nIf the lot is packed, you can continue east on the Southside Drive for about 0.25 miles. Parking is available on both sides of the road here, and there is a bit more parking available than in the actual lot for Bridalveil Fall. This allows you to access the falls via a slightly longer path (about 0.5 miles round-trip).\n\nThe advantage of this being such a short hike is that many people are constantly returning to their cars, so there tends to be high turnover in the lot and spots do open up frequently.\n\nRestrooms are available near the parking lot, but there are no restrooms on the trail.\n\nBRIDALVEIL FALL TRAIL: TRAIL SURFACE AND ACCESSIBILITY\n\nTrail surface. The trail is paved the entire way. This makes for easy walking, but also reduces erosion on the trail due to the large amount of traffic that this trail sees each day.\n\nAccessibility. While the trail is definitely easy, there is a grade for the last 0.1 mile that goes up 85 feet. While not steep, this is not suitable for wheelchairs.\n\nPREPARATION FOR HIKING THE BRIDALVEIL FALL TRAIL\n\nThe hike to the Bridalveil Fall trail is short, making it so that you don’t need to bring much with you, if anything at all. However, if you are planning on spending a few minutes in the area, and especially have kids, we have a few tips on what to bring:\n\nWater Shoes. If you plan on spending a bit of time near the water, having some good water shoes with some grip can come in handy, particularly around the rocks. Wearing sneakers is also fine, though just be advised that due to the spray coming from the waterfall that the trail may be slick at times.\n\nSmall Towel. Since you and the kids may want to get wet, having a small, portable microfiber towel can come in handy.\n\nHIKING THE BRIDALVEIL FALL TRAIL\n\nBridalveil Fall Trail map, courtesy of the National Park Service\n\nThe hike to Bridalveil Fall starts from the northeast side of the parking lot.\n\nThe trail starts off flat and continues this way for about 0.1 mile. At this point, you’ll take a right at the fork, as going straight brings you to the alternate parking area for the trail.\n\nAfter the fork, you’ll start to hit an increasing incline as the trail goes up approximately 85 feet as you approach Bridalveil Creek and the end of the trail.\n\nFrom the trail there are great opportunities to see the massive waterfall that gently sprays water from above, giving it the appropriate name of Bridalveil Fall.\n\nWhile it may be tempting to climb up to get a better look, we highly recommend staying on the trail. Due to erosion, the rocks are slippery no matter what time of year you visit. This is the case even when the rocks are dry. People fall every year while exploring the waterfalls at Yosemite National Park. A hiker even died on Bridalveil Fall after falling back in 2019.\n\nBRIDALVEIL FALL\n\nBridalveil Fall, image courtesy of James St. John\n\nBridalveil Fall is 620 feet high. It is actually the twelfth tallest waterfall in Yosemite National Park. The tallest waterfall is of course Yosemite Falls, which is nearly 4 times as tall.\n\nWater is fed from Bridalveil Creek, which originates about 7 miles southeast of Bridalveil Fall and terminates at the Merced River, about 800 feet downstream (northwest) of the viewpoint at the end of the trail.\n\nBRIDALVEIL FALL TRAIL: TOP LIKES AND DISLIKES\n\nLikes:\n\nQuick and Easy. This hike takes about 30 minutes (after you get out the car) if you linger at Bridalveil Fall for a ten or so minutes. It’s great way to stretch your legs after a long drive into the park.\n\nCool Mist. The mist from the waterfall is very pleasant during the heat of the summer.\n\nDislikes:\n\nCrowds. Trying to get parking at the main parking lot may take you longer than the actual hike. We really think that if you see some backup going into the parking lot, just head to the alternate parking area and extend the hike a bit. You’ll likely be done faster that you would be if you waited for a parking spot. It will also save you a bit of a headache when it’s time to get in your car and drive onto the next attraction.\n\nTHINGS TO DO NEAR THE BRIDALVEIL FALL TRAIL\n\nThe entire Yosemite Valley is worth visiting for at least a day. However, right nearby the Bridalveil Fall Trail is a few things to check out:\n\nJust west on the Wawona Road is Tunnel View. This viewpoint looks down into Yosemite Valley, with views of El Capitan and Half Dome. This is particularly amazing as the sun is going down.\n\nThe Merced River cuts through the Valley and is hard to miss. However, rather than just looking at it, we highly recommend going down to the bank and just watching it. It’s also a great place get peace and quiet away from crowds, as most people stay in their cars and don’t venture down to the river at all.\n\nCathedral Beach is east of Bridalveil Fall. It is a fantastic place for a picnic and spending a bit of time in the water, particularly when it’s hot out.\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION ON YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK FROM JUST GO TRAVEL STUDIOS"
