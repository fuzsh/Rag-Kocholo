The trail to the waterfall is relatively short at less than one mile roundtrip. Plan for 20 minutes of trail time to stop and take in the falls.\n\nThe trailhead for this short hike is right off of the Columbia River Highway just west of Multnomah Falls. You can't miss the parking lot for it; there is a sign for Bridal Veil and the parking lot is visible from the road.\n\nThe hike is only 0.6 miles and has hardly any elevation gain (70 feet). The trail is well traveled and is definitely good for families. The hike may not be much, but it does go through some pretty woods and crosses a bridge over the stream. The waterfall is a beautiful 2 tiered falls. You can view the falls from the observation deck or take a small path to the big rock in front of the falls.\n\nThis is a good hike to tack onto the end of a trip to the Columbia River Gorge as it's on the way back to Portland.\n\nRead More\n\nDownload the Outbound mobile app\n\nFind adventures and camping on the go, share photos, use GPX tracks, and download maps for offline use.\n\nGet the app\n\nDownload GPX File\n\nFeatures\n\nPhotography\n\nHiking\n\nBathrooms\n\nDog Friendly\n\nEasy Parking\n\nFamily Friendly\n\nForest\n\nRiver\n\nWaterfall\n\nBridal Veil Falls Reviews\n\nClayton Lukens\n\n07/01/20\n\nThe 0.6 hike doesn’t make this very worth it to drive out to but it is still beautiful to photograph once ya get there\n\n3.0\n\nKristina Kifyak\n\n05/29/18\n\nI thought it was a very pretty waterfall. Simple, short, and easy hike. Family friendly yes, but don’t take a stroller down as there are stairs along the trail. Loved the greenery around the waterfalls!\n\n5.0\n\nLindsy Dugan\n\n11/05/16\n\nThis was not my favorite stop along HWY 30, but it is a good stop for a short hike. This one would be good for kids, but there isn't much to explore around the waterfall so I found it anti-climatic.\n\n3.0\n\nJhamil Bader\n\n07/26/16\n\nIt's not my favorite Oregon waterfall, but it's still beautiful! a fun short hike to this pleasant falls and creek. as always, choose wisely when planning a trip to the gorge as it gets SUPER busy, especially during the summer months! weekdays (and early morning starts on weekends) are your friend.\n\n4.0\n\nAlex E\n\nExplorer\n\n07/18/16\n\nYoung and Old can make it down this short an easy hike for a spectacular view!\n\n5.0\n\nLilly Kim\n\n01/24/16\n\nWent in the pouring rain today! Ended up being a lot shorter than I expected, but it still was a sight to see.\n\n4.0\n\nLeave No Trace\n\nAlways practice Leave No Trace ethics on your adventures and follow local regulations.

All told, the loop hits 3 named waterfalls (Coopey Falls, Fairy Falls, and Wahkeena Falls) and 2 spectacular viewpoints (Angel's Rest and Devil's Rest). The only dow...\n\nAngel's Rest\n\nThe Columbia River Gorge is absolutely full of incredible hikes - that said, this is one of the best and requires less time and energy than some of the others. Starting at a paved parking lot right off the Historic Columbia River Gorge Highway (note: it's a very popular trail so arrive early or you'll be parking somewhere else, even off-season), the trail immediately cuts into scenic Oregon fo...\n\nLatourell Falls Loop\n\nHeads up! There's construction going on at the eastern part of the trail and the main parking lot is closed. But don't worry, you can still get to the trail from the west entrance turning this hike into an out-and-back. For the latest updates, check out the Oregon State Parks website: https://stateparks.oregon.gov/.. Take a short walk to the base of Latourell Falls, where there is a small poo...\n\nHike to Upper Bridal Veil Falls\n\nAt the parking lot for Angel's Rest, turn left uphill on to Palmer Mill Road. Drive for about a mile, and park right past a tributary stream/small waterfall (pictured above) on your left that flows through a small pipe under the road. You will see a small space to park on the right. Park here and you will see a faint trail beaten down only by foot. Start walking down the trail, and it will grad...\n\nCape Horn Trail\n\nThe Cape Horn Trail is great for those who are short on time, but still want to get outside for something close by with great views. Located just 35 min east of Portland, the Cape Horn Trail offers a few different possibilities for you to hike. The whole loop (lower section is closed from Feb 1st to July 15th for bird nesting) is around 6.5 miles and offers great views up high and a pretty low...\n\nFairy Falls\n\nFairy Falls sits in the heart of the Columbia River Gorge, not much more than a mile from the Wahkeena Trailhead. The parking lot is right off the Old Columbia River Highway and will be packed with cars in the summer. Head up the trail towards Wahkeena Falls, which is not far up the hill. This falls is impressive for sure, but tends to be quite busy in the summer. After taking in the view cont...\n\n© 2024 The Outbound Collective - Terms of Use - Privacy Policy"
