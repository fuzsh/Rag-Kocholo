        "text": "A countdown to Oregon's Feb. 14 birthday with a county-by-county trip to some of our uncommonly cool places.\n\nYAMHILL COUNTY\n\nWispy falls reward a scramble\n\nAt Gunaldo Falls, beauty can be heard in a whisper across a remote thicket. An unnamed creek double-drops as a wispy waterfall maybe 60-plus feet into Sourgrass Creek --it's all out of sight except to the intrepid willing to scramble down a steep slope overland through trash, trees, vines, ferns and blackberries.\n\nFor waterfallophiles, Gunaldo is off Oregon 22, north past Valley Junction (18/22) near milepost 12 on the right side. There's a wide turnout and a road coming in from the opposite side.\n\nListen carefully and proceed.\n\nThe county officials who are said to have named the falls, back around 1915, must have liked the rippling sound, as well as the sound of their own names, William Gunning, W.S. Allan and J.B. Dodson. They combined syllables to create the name Gunaldo.\n\n-- Nancy Todd\n\nWHEELER COUNTY\n\nMill town Kinzua fades away\n\nIn our least-populous county, Kinzua was once the largest town, complete with a school and airstrip. Now it's only a word on the map --and only on some maps at that.\n\nThe remote company-owned town grew up to serve a sawmill in the day when timber ruled Oregon. In its heyday, the town and a surrounding logging camp had 1,000 residents, and the mill turned 100,000 board feet of timber a day into lumber.\n\nBut the mill, which had been the biggest employer in the county, closed 30 years ago. Kinzua (pronounced \"Kinzoo\" and named after a community on the Allegheny River in Pennsylvania) has gone mostly back to pasture, and with it disappeared a way of life once common in the state. There's a huge ranch there now, owned by a Michigan millionaire. The mill town's houses were torn down, or some moved to nearby Fossil.\n\nThe town had a golf course and the six-hole Kinzua Hills Golf Club still survives ($15 for 18-holers to do three times around the course on the honor system, according to pasture golf.com).\n\n-- Nancy Todd\n\nWASHINGTON COUNTY\n\nSherwood's six corners are history\n\nThe name still shows up on maps. But it's no longer six corners. And if you're among the new wave of Sherwoodians (500+ percent population growth since 1990), you may drive through the Six Corners area every day and never even have heard of it.\n\nWhat was the congested intersection of Oregon 99W, Edy Road and Sherwood Boulevard/Scholls-Sherwood Road was re-engineered in the early 1990s into a pair of intersections with 99W. Businesses once identified by the Six Corners moniker have given way to a sea of Sherwood Crossroads-Marketplace-Plaza-Market Center --shopping centers in about every direction that parallel the drastic growth Sherwood has undergone.\n\nTraffic has proceeded apace, increasing by 20,000 vehicles daily in the area since Six Corners turned into eight corners, according to the Oregon Department of Transportation.\n\n-- Nancy Todd\n\nWASCO COUNTY\n\nAntelope, Rajneesh, Antelope\n\nQuiet Antelope awoke in the 1980s to one of Oregon's most bizarre chapters.\n\nThe red-robed followers of a guru from India, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, had flocked to Muddy Ranch outside town. They outvoted townsfolk 57-22 to rename Antelope to Rajneesh in September 1984.\n\nAntelope, whose post office dates from 1871, nearly lost its name. But the name was not immediately changed by the post office because of a federal policy against naming certain places after living people.\n\nMeanwhile,, the sect imploded as FBI agents descended on the ranch to investigate sham marriages, wiretapping, immigration violations and an intentional salmonella poisoning that sickened hundreds in The Dalles. A Rajneeshee leader fled to Europe reportedly with a wad of the sect's money. A 1985 plot to kill the top federal prosecutor in Oregon was aborted. Prosecutions and convictions followed for years.\n\nIn the aftermath, the remaining residents, including some Rajneeshees, voted 34-0 in November 1985 to restore the original name.\n\nAntelope, nestled in a valley amid sagebrush and hills, had stood its ground. Through most of the past decade, the town has had an estimated 60 residents; at its peak, the commune had brought thousands more to the area. The city still has the post office, and a church and a small cafe. It's populated by retirees and some people who have second homes in the area; workers often commute the 31 miles to Madras.\n\nThe population turned over some after the \"traumatic\" episode, says John Silvertooth-Stewart, a City Council member. People felt uprooted and left. Now, there's a trickle of tourists interested in the history, as well as traffic headed to the expanding Christian youth camp run on the site of the former Rancho Rajneesh.\n\nMainly though, Antelope is back to quiet, and happily so, says its mayor of six years, Brian Sheer. \"It's just a sleepy little town. A beautiful place.\"\n\nA plaque topped by an antelope at the base of the post office flagpole remembers when it wasn't. It's \"dedicated to those of this community who, through the Rajneesh invasion and occupation of 1981-85, remained, resisted, and remembered.\"\n\n-- Nancy Todd\n\nWALLOWA COUNTY\n\nWho would notice a lost hat?\n\nHang on to your hat, cowboy! But what a place to misplace it --an overlook a mile above the deepest gorge carved by a river in North America, Hells Canyon. Hat Point and Hat Creek are said to have been named in the 1890s after a horse bucked its rider, whose hat went flying. Later, a relative found the hat and tied it to a bush, where it hung for more than a year. The panorama at Hat Point, at nearly 7,000 feet, is among the state's most awe-inspiring and looking east, one of the best places to watch the sun rise. The wild section of the Snake River flows furiously 5,632 feet below.\n\nFor the vertically inclined, you can climb a 1948 fire lookout and add 96 feet of elevation to your view. This payoff comes at the end of a steep and narrow single-lane gravel road (Forest Service Road 4240, with turnouts). It's a 23.5-mile trip from Imnaha.\n\n-- Nancy Todd\n\nUNION COUNTY\n\nOnce upon an island\n\nIsland City, Oregon. That would be along the coast, or maybe up the Columbia a ways? Try landlocked, mountainous eastern Oregon as home to a city on what was once an island in the Grande RondeRiver and Mulholland Slough.\n\nIsland City's mayor of 18 years, Dale De Long, remembers his mother telling of fording the slough by car or horse and buggy long ago to get to the higher ground. No need nowadays to roll up your pant legs or take a bridge --drainage and modern engineering turned a marshy island into Island City.\n\nNot an island, but a city, yes, which celebrated its centennial in 2004, although it's described by some as a bedroom community to La Grande. Island City has a population of 995 and growing (20 years ago it was 300). The city --or is it a town --is home to the county's only Wal-Mart and has businesses in the forest industry, as well as farm supply stores. Eastern Oregon University in La Grande, a Boise Cascade particle board plant nearby and travel trailer manufacturers provide jobs.\n\nFor summer fun, there's the annual Hog Wild Days, which is all about kids, or the private La Grande Country Club.\n\n-- Nancy Todd\n\nUMATILLA COUNTY\n\nThe beauty, the peril of Cabbage Hill\n\nNotorious. Treacherous. Deadly. Adjectives that often wind up in the same sentence as Cabbage Hill tell the tale of Interstate 84 across this 3,615-foot rise. Nothing cruciferous about it.\n\n\"Respect the Hill!\" the ODOT Web site commands, warning of the 6 percent downgrade on the hill (also known as Emigrant Hill) as a \"white-knuckle experience\" for truckers as they lose 2,000 feet and twist through a double hairpin turn. Four fatalities and 75 nonfatal accidents have been logged in about the past five years along the stretch, which carries slightly more than 10,000 vehicles daily.\n\n\"Ferocious\" is the winter weather that can descend upon the hill, leading to the pileups that westside Oregonians likely think of when they hear \"Cabbage Hill.\"\n\nAnd yet . . . add \"magnificent\" to describe the view of mountains, as a trucker did in an online article encouraging fellow drivers to make the trip between La Grande and Pendleton if they ever got the chance --but to drive cautiously.\n\n\"Cabbage\" may have come either from a man herding sheep on the hill who noticed a prominent cabbage patch in 1897, or from the cabbagelike image the hill's steep switchbacks create.\n\nThe pass at the peak? Deadman Pass, aptly enough.\n\n-- NancyTodd\n\nTILLAMOOK COUNTY\n\nThe one and only... Beaver\n\nThe most obvious beaver in town is appropriately carved into wood atop the Beaver Grocery, which doubles as a deli, caterer, movie store, bait-and-tackle shop, T-shirteria, wine merchant, post office (ZIP 97108), you name it. Nestled along the Nestucca River with creeks every which way, it's not hard to imagine why somebody long ago tagged this as the Beaver State's one true (not Beaverton or Beavercreek) Beaver, Oregon.\n\nTheories arise around town as to how the name came to be, beyond the obvious: half of the sign for Beaver Creek fell down, so the single moniker stuck; settlers could only spell a few words, and \"beaver\" was one. All plausible. Whatever the origin of the name, the Beaver post office started up in 1889.\n\nOn an inland stretch of U.S. 101 about 15 miles south of Tillamook, the unincorporated town has a Shell station, another grocery (by the name of Fox, with arrangements for gunsmithing available), Hairlines salon, a community church, Dave's Beaver Service for vehicles, a middle school, fire station and Tillamook Transit bus stop.\n\nOnce there was a small Tillamook cheese factory, but that's gone now, and besides farming and logging, jobs are most likely found in Tillamook or south in Lincoln City.\n\nAs for the beavers themselves, some old-timers say there are few left. But Jim Fox, the grocery's owner and lifelong Beaverite, says with no market for their pelts and no natural predator, there are plenty of beavers. And they're causing erosion problems by doing what beavers do --burrowing and damming.\n\n-- Nancy Todd\n\nSHERMAN COUNTY\n\nGeneral also wins name war\n\nBest to leave your grudges behind when you're bucking to be the namesake for a county.\n\nThe bill to create Fulton County, carved out of the northeast portion of Wasco County, had gone through two readings before the state House in 1889. The name would honor Col. James Fulton of the pioneer family that had settled in the area of rolling canyons and grasslands.\n\nBut Fulton, a secessionist, had been the instigator about 20 years earlier when the House snubbed William Tecumseh Sherman, the Civil War general from the North known for his \"scorched earth\" policy who was then touring the West.\n\nAs politics are timeless, the slight was not forgotten. The name Sherman was substituted for Fulton when the bill finally passed, adding another county along the Columbia River Gorge to the young state. Today, Sherman County is the state's second smallest by population (2008), eighth-smallest in acreage and has new vistas: horizons dotted with wind turbines.\n\n-- Nancy Todd\n\nPOLK COUNTY\n\nA 'can-do' attitude in Independence\n\nWhen Independence leaders learned that major Internet providers wouldn't provide high-speed fiber to serve their city, they didn't flinch.\n\nInstead, along with neighboring Monmouth, they created their own high-speed network.\n\nThat's just the way the folks are in Independence, a community about 10 miles southwest of Salem.\n\n\"We are optimistic like the pioneers that came across in the 1840s,\" says John McArdle, the city's mayor since 1998. \"I think it's an attitude that has been fostered for decades.\n\nThis community along the Willamette River has been home to optimists since the mid-19th century, when the Oregon Trail enticed wagon trains packed with pioneers. A cluster from Missouri made camp near the river, and a man named Elvin A. Thorp named the new settlement after Independence, the Missouri city he left behind.\n\nThanks to the lumber and hops industries and its proximity to the river, Independence flourished. The hops business grew so much in the 1920s, '30s and '40s that at harvest time the city's population increased by as many as 40,000 to 50,000.\n\nToday Independence is a community of more than 8,000. The city's treasures include a historic downtown, a farmers market, an eight-screen theater and an air park --a neighborhood where residents can keep their airplanes in hangars attached to their houses.\n\nEvery year Independence hosts the Hop and Heritage Festival and co-hosts with Monmouth a Fourth of July celebration known as Western Days.\n\nThe future of city will include more to brag about: a 60,000-square-foot Platinum LEEDS building downtown, 50 acres of ball fields, housing developments and a trail linking Western Oregon University in Monmouth to Independence.\n\nBig plans for a small town, but the mayor says Independence is up to it.\n\n\"You have to be an optimist to live in Oregon,\" he says. \"Sometimes it rains, but we know it will be sunny tomorrow.\"\n\n-- Lisa Daniels\n\nMULTNOMAH COUNTY\n\nLove-struck in the Columbia River Gorge\n\nLegend has it that a woman riding on a sternwheeler became enchanted by the Columbia River Gorge's waterfalls.\n\nOne of the waterfalls, about 28 miles east of Portland, looked so delicate and wispy, she said, it resembled a bride's veil.\n\nThe name Bridal Veil stuck.\n\nThe area was settled in the late 19th century and grew as the Bridal Veil Lumbering Co. logged Douglas fir and hemlock from Larch Mountain. The community prospered, swelling to nearly 400 people by the turn of the century. Nearly everything locals needed --a school, a store, a cemetery, a hotel, a boarding house and a church --sprouted.\n\nIn 1937, the mill was bought to make wooden cheese boxes for the Kraft Cheese Co. The mill changed hands and functions several times over the years --at one point former NASCAR great Hershel McGriff owned it --until it closed in 1989.\n\nIn 1991, The Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit that buys and conserves land, bought 58.5 acres of land in Bridal Veil for $712,500. Locals and the Crown Point Country Historical Society wanted to save the mill's buildings and weathered worker housing, but the trust demolished nearly all of the buildings in 2001 in an effort to restore the land to its original state. Last year, the trust sold 18 acres of Bridal Veil to the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nToday, all that remains of once-bustling Bridal Veil is a church, a tiny U.S. Post Office and a cemetery. About 100 people who consider Bridal Veil home live nearby.\n\nBut romance endures.\n\nEvery year, hundreds of love-struck couples drive to the post office to get their Valentine cards and wedding invitations hand-stamped. The special cancellations feature doves, intertwined hearts --and, of course, the words \"Bridal Veil.\"\n\n— Lisa Daniels\n\nMORROW COUNTY\n\nButcher Bill: moonshine with the ham\n\nIt was the early 20th century, and a hog butcher named Bill set up shop out on a Morrow County prairie.\n\nHis business was remote even by Old West standards; about 25 miles of dirt road separated the butcher from his customers in the nearest town of Heppner.\n\nDespite the distance, Butcher Bill's business thrived.\n\nIt wasn't because of his hogs.\n\nIt was because, in addition to ham, Butcher Bill also sold moonshine, which had been banned by lawmakers who voted to prohibit the manufacture, transport, and sale of alcoholic liquors in the United States.\n\nOregon's temperance movement supported Prohibition wholeheartedly.\n\nOthers in the Heppner area supported Butcher Bill, who made alcohol from grain, then fed the leftover mash to his hogs.\n\n\"Most people didn't object to illegal stills,\" said historian Cliff Green, adding that many locals considered Prohibition \"government intervention in their lives.\"\n\nMany of Bill's customers were pillars of the community.\n\n\"They'd sow their wild oats on Saturday night and go to church on Sunday,\" Green said.\n\nButcher Bill Meadow, listed on some maps as Butcher Bill Prairie, is now part of the Umatilla National Forest. The moonshiner is long gone, but there's a photo of him in the Morrow County Museum --as well as a still.\n\n— Lisa Daniels\n\nMARION COUNTY\n\nA sublime little community\n\nIn 1852, a new post office was set to open in Marion County.\n\nThe outpost needed a name, so pioneer James Denny suggested Sublimity because he thought the scenery --well, sublime.\n\nHe's not the only one. Since the mid-19th century, the beauty of this ridge in the rolling hills of the Cascades has drawn newcomers.\n\nMany early settlers were Roman Catholics of German descent from Minnesota, Wisconsin and Kansas, lured by the glowing reports about the good land and good life in Oregon, says Henry Strobel, a historian who lives a few miles outside of the city limits.\n\nThey stayed and, over the years Sublimity flourished, its economy buoyed by logging and, later, grass farms and neighborhoods that commuters to Salem call home.\n\nToday, about 2,285 people live in Sublimity, and many more come to see the tractor pulls during the annual Sublimity Harvest Festival and the bull riding during the yearly Santiam Canyon Stampede.\n\nThough Sublimity has changed a lot since it was named, those who know it say it still lives up to its name.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" says Strobel.\n\n—Lisa Daniels\n\nMALHEUR COUNTY\n\nWhen in Rome, it's best to do what makes sense: Look up.\n\nBecause if you do, you'll see the cliffs that flank the nearby Owyhee River and perhaps understand why this area of Malheur County earned the name Rome.\n\nThe cliffs \"looked like they ought to be the walls of the city of Rome,\" says Mark Ferns, resident geologist for the eastern Oregon field office of Oregon's Department of Geology and Mineral Industries in Baker City.\n\nLike the once-great structures in Italy, Oregon's \"Pillars of Rome\" as they are sometimes called, are primarily made of volcanic tuff. The pillars were created about 12 to 15 million years ago, says Ferns, after volcanoes erupted and river waters carved the volcanic detritus into muscular bluffs.\n\nThe pillars rise about 150 feet above the horizon --high enough for travelers to use them as landmarks as they trek through southeastern Oregon's seemingly endless miles of rangeland.\n\n— Lisa Daniels\n\nLINN COUNTY\n\nPeople drank the water a bit too much\n\nThe history of Sodaville bubbles forth from Gail Gregory, curator of the East Linn Museum, which chronicles the history of Linn County.\n\nSodaville --a community in the southern end of the Willamette Valley --got its name in the mid-19th century, soon after a settler came across the bubbly, sodalike mineral springs there.\n\nWord got out about the springs, and people from all over the region were coming to drink the water they heard had restorative properties.\n\nThe springs' popularity led to creation of a resort where guests not only drank the water, but bottled it to take home too.\n\nBut by the mid-1950s, officials became concerned the water was getting contaminated. The well was sealed off, and the hotel closed.\n\nNearly 300 people call Sodaville home today. Although the community still hosts its annual Blackberry Festival, Sodaville's water commerce has long since dried up.\n\n— Lisa Daniels\n\nLINCOLN COUNTY\n\nFoul one day; a looker the next\n\nOn the Oregon coast, in any year on a March day, you might expect to run smack into a storm of varying magnitudes.\n\nIt was apparently such a day in March 1778, when English explorer Capt. James Cook got his first glimpse of our coast.\n\nHis impressions?\n\nWell, he named the first landmark he saw Cape Foulweather.\n\nThe cape, between Newport and Lincoln City, juts out into the Pacific Ocean and rises as high as 500 feet above the crashing waves. But other than powerful winds, the Cape's climate is similar to nearby Newport, with average temperatures of 70 degrees in summer and 43 degrees in winter. Cape Foulweather's rainfall averages about 68 inches a year. Not so foul --on average.\n\n\"It can, in treacherous weather, live up to its name, but actually it's one of the most scenic and beautiful stretches of the coast,\" Greater Newport Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Lorna Davis says. \"You can drive over it on a clear sunny day and see what seems to be forever, and in the winter you can drive over and, from time to time, it is mysterious and foggy.\"\n\nThe cape is part of the Otter Crest State Scenic Viewpoint, and tourism officials encourage visitors to take in the striking views of the ocean and coastline.\n\nSays Davis: \"It's jaw-dropping stuff.\"\n\n— Lisa Daniels\n\nLANE COUNTY\n\nGetting away from it all... at the Office\n\nOne of the last things you want to think about as you travel through lush Lane County is the office.\n\nBut if you take a trip down Old Mill Road that's just what you'll find: a red covered bridge named after an office.\n\nSpanning the north fork of the Middle Fork Willamette River in Westfir, the Office Covered Bridge was constructed by a local lumber company in 1944, according to a Lane County spokeswoman, Loralyn Spiro.\n\nThe lumber mill sat at one end of the bridge; the office sat at the other. The bridge was built with two openings: a large one to accommodate vehicles, and, next to it, a small one for pedestrians.\n\nSpanning 180 feet, the Office is Oregon's longest covered bridge. It features triple-Howe truss construction and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Office is one of 20 covered bridges in Lane County, which claims to have more covered bridges than any other county west of the Mississippi River. The county is so proud of the 17 covered bridges it owns that it had coins made to celebrate them.\n\nFourteen of the county-owned covered bridges are open to traffic. The Office Bridge is one of them --meaning that, whether you're on foot or on wheels, you'll be able to cross this bridge when you get to it.\n\n— Lisa Daniels\n\nLAKE COUNTY\n\nTake a hike where Earth is split open\n\nIn the heart of Lake County, in a patch of earth managed by the Bureau of Land Management, there's a crack in the ground.\n\nThis is no ordinary sidewalk split; this one's so big locals simply refer to it as Crack in the Ground.\n\n\"Because that's just what it is,\" says Erika Lasater, co-creator of Outback.com, a Web site that touts Lake County's attractions.\n\nThe crack was formed about 20,000 years ago, says Dennis Simontacchi, the former Lakeview district geologist for the BLM. So much lava squirted up from the ground that its surface collapsed, leaving a cavelike fissure two miles long and 70 feet deep in some places.\n\nHomesteaders often picnicked in the fissure --sometimes as many as 20 degrees cooler than the surface temperature --to escape summer heat. Modern-day hikers say they're awe-struck by the beauty of the moss and rocks inside the crevasse.\n\nCaro Johnson, executive director of Lake County Chamber of Commerce, said hiking in the crack was \"a life-changing experience\" for her.\n\n\"Here you are, out in the middle of the desert. It's flat, there's sagebrush and sand, and you wander around a trail and all of a sudden you see the Earth has split open,\" she says. \"You can literally walk down into the Earth.\"\n\n— Lisa Daniels\n\nKLAMATH COUNTY\n\nFrom war to peace in Bly\n\nUp the Sprague River, in fly-fishing country, lived the P'laikni. Their word for high is \"p'lai.\" Say it fast, it sounds like Bly, probably the name's genesis.\n\nThe town's criminal history is unique.\n\nAbout 1873, a settler named Munz killed a Native American. He didn't stick around; his $9,000 bail built the first county courthouse.\n\nAnother time, the justice of the peace, a liquor store owner, refused to sell to a drunk. The drunk threw a rock at his window and the justice --with a hook for a arm --snagged the drunk under the jaw. Killed him. The same justice of the peace later killed his wife.\n\nBly boomed with logging in the 1920s --sawmills, bars, beer parlors and a house of prostitution. Wild fights and murders ensued. Things settled down long before the last mill closed in 1984.\n\nBly became famous in 1945 as Japanese balloon bombs intended to ignite forest fires landed without detonating. Curious picnickers later found the bombs, which exploded, killing six.\n\nThe latest true crime: in 2002 Earnest James Ujaama was indicted for, in part, conspiring to set up a terrorist camp nearby.\n\n-- Joan Harvey\n\nJOSEPHINE COUNTY\n\nJoe's jump remains memorable\n\nJumpoff Joe Creek was probably named after an exploit of Joe McLoughlin, son of Dr. John McLoughlin, often referred to as the father of Oregon.\n\nJoe McLoughlin died Dec. 14, 1848, from injuries received in a fall.\n\nSeveral legends surround the fall, his death and the naming of Jumpoff Joe Creek. One had young Joe as part of a trapping party in 1828. The men set up camp, and Joe set out to find the evening meal. As twilight approached, Joe came upon some Native Americans who chased him to the edge of a bluff. His friends saw the commotion and shouted, \"Jump off, Joe.\"\n\nFaced with the choice, Joe jumped, incurring severe injuries that years later caused his death.\n\nOr there's the less dramatic tale:\n\nHe was late joining a hunting party and stumbled in the dark over a cliff into the creek.\n\nYou may also have heard of Jumpoff Joe before. In the Pacific Northwest, he's taken a leap off a canyon, mountain, butte or point --or at least they're named for him.\n\n— Joan Harvey\n\nJEFFERSON COUNTY\n\nA bolt of inspiration -- voila, a name\n\nLocated in the heart of Jefferson County and in a rather circular valley, Madras was first called The Basin, descriptive --but not particularly inspiring. When the community was established and applied for a post office, the name Palmain was suggested for John Palmehn, who platted the town. Generally, he went by Palmain because he thought it would be easier to spell.\n\nFederal postal officials rejected the name as too easy to be confused with the Palmer post office. Residents continued to fuss about the name. Willow Creek was suggested but rejected.\n\nAccording to Bert Doze in a letter published by the Madras Pioneer in 1944, he was sent by his uncle, Joshua Hahn, to the town in 1903 to open a store. The community still wasn't named, and Doze and Hahn suggested Madras, after a bolt of the colorful cotton fabric from India in the store.\n\nLater, residents quibbled with this story and claimed that the name was foisted on the town by post office authorities. The town was incorporated in 1911, and is the county seat of Jefferson County.\n\nThe Oregon town is pronounced with the accent on the first syllable; in India, the name of the place for which the cloth is named is pronounced with the accent on the second syllable.\n\nThe town was built to serve the surrounding farms and ranches and the growing railroad industry. During World War II, Madras experienced an economic boom with the building of an Army air base.\n\nIn 2007, Madras --and much of the state --went into a frenzy when native son Jacoby Ellsbury, playing for the Boston Red Sox, became the first rookie in 61 years to get four hits in a World Series game.\n\n— Joan Harvey\n\nJACKSON COUNTY\n\nWhisky on ice\n\nWhisky Creek sounds like a place straight out of a country and western song. And so it could be.\n\nIn a winter in about 1882, Harvey Deskins, a pioneer bootlegger with more enterprise than common sense, schlepped a wagonload of whiskey from Jacksonville over the mountains to Fort Klamath. Whether his intended customers were Native Americans or soldiers at the fort isn't clear. A snowstorm stopped him and, unable to move the wagon, he buried the load where it stood. He returned in spring and discovered the cache cleaned out. Soldiers from the fort had found the buried booze and partaken of his hospitality. The soldiers named the creek to honor his unintended largesse.\n\nFort Klamath, in Klamath County, arose in 1863 about a mile southeast of today's Fort Klamath. With more than 50 buildings, including a sawmill, it served as an Army post during the Modoc, Snake and Paiute wars. But by 1889, the wars were over. After a particularly harsh winter of more than 20 feet of snow, the troops left the last military outpost in Oregon and marched north to Vancouver Barracks.\n\nNothing remains of the original structures, but a modern park and museum is located within the fort area. Graves of four Modoc men executed in 1873 for killing Gen. Edward Canby remain at the site.\n\nWhiskey Creek and Whisky Creek show up in two other Oregon counties. In Tillamook, two wives were fed up with their lazy, drunken husbands. And in Wallowa, pioneers didn't want whiskey used to barter with tribes. Same result each case: Whiskey dumped into said creeks.\n\n-- Joan Harvey\n\nHOOD RIVER COUNTY\n\nThe 'ghosts' are looking lively\n\nThe community of Dee is alive and well, though the original, once-bustling mill town is an official ghost town. Can't say which official deemed it as such.\n\nDee sits about nine miles southwest of Hood River where Highway 281 intersects Lost Lake Road. Oregon Lumber built the town to house its workers in 1906 alongside the company's Mt. Hood Railroad. It was named after a vice president of the company, Thomas D. Dee.\n\n\"Ripley's Believe It or Not\" once featured the town because all the houses faced the railroad tracks instead of the street and called it a \"Backroom Community.\" Doesn't seem that unbelievable. More practical than anything --like Oregonians are.\n\nThe town was razed in the 1950s. Today there's a surrounding community called Dee with 1,065 Oregonians who must all feel that reports of the death of Dee are premature.\n\nRemnants of the old mill survived, as well as a few houses.\n\n— Joan Harvey\n\nHARNEY COUNTY\n\nSteens pasture can't shake bawdy history\n\nThe meadow on the slopes of Steens Mountain must be sublime in spring when wildflowers pop up and open.\n\nBut there's no polite way to talk about the name of the meadow itself. That would be Whorehouse Meadow, named for the bustling entrepreneurial women in the early days of the open cattle range.\n\nThe houses were shoddy tents and ramshackle shacks that women from Vale pitched on the meadow for spring and summer services to the sheepherders and cattlemen of the area.\n\nThe activity passed with the open cattle range, but the name endured until the 1960s, when the Bureau of Land Management issued a recreation map and sanitized it to the prissy Naughty Girls Meadow. The Oregon Geographic Names Board fought for 10 years to restore the original name and won in 1981.\n\nOffensive toponyms are found across the West. Most of those that denigrated racial or ethnic groups have been renamed.\n\nThe other type, such as our aptly named meadow, offends those folks bothered by the rude or vulgar language. But these normally don't stir up much controversy. The locals just want to leave well enough alone.\n\nBesides, the risque names sound a bit like what you'd hear from the miners, shepherds or ranchers who roamed the range and mined for gold and tended the sheep.\n\n— Joan Harvey\n\nGRANT COUNTY\n\nHazy details swirl around creek's gold\n\nLost pioneers. Fever. Desperation. Gold pebbles. Blue Bucket Creek.\n\nToo bad the precise location of the creek likely will never be found and the mystery surrounding it never solved. If it ever really happened at all.\n\nLike a lot of legends, the details are hazy.\n\nThey swirl around the 1845 Meek party --infamous for spending six weeks wandering in southern Oregon because of a \"shortcut\" suggested by Stephen Meek.\n\nOne story: A young girl, sent with the typical bright-blue painted, wooden bucket to fetch water, gathered several shiny pebbles along the bank. It wasn't until her family reached California and her father had used most of them for fishing sinkers that someone realized they were gold.\n\nAnother version has two teenage boys in the Meek group looking for lost oxen and collecting the pebbles, which were dismissed by others in the group as copper. The buckets filled with them were hung under the wagons and bounced off.\n\nBlue Bucket Creek in Harney County helps preserve the legend. The location of the actual stream was never positively identified because of the wandering and confusion of the party, but it is probably not far from its namesake, which rises west of Antelope Mountain and joins a tributary of the Malheur River.\n\n— Joan Harvey\n\nGILLIAM COUNTY\n\nHe really liked his middle name\n\nOn the Columbia River 53 miles east of The Dalles, Arlington was named Alkali in pioneer days . Apparently, residents didn't think the name sufficiently dignified.\n\nAt a town meeting, N.A. Cornish suggested the name Arlington, after the Virginian home of Robert E. Lee, he said, and because of Southerners who'd settled in town. The Legislature approved the switch in 1885.\n\nBut once the distinguished Mr. Cornish died, his daughter revealed the real story. Her father's full name was Nathan Arlington Cornish, and the reason he suggested the name was to honor himself.\n\nIt didn't cause such an uproar as to provoke the good citizens of Arlington to revert to the old name.\n\nIn 1963, the town was moved south to higher ground and the original site flooded by the John Day Dam.\n\nAt one time, the town's claim to fame was as the birthplace of Doc Severinsen, band leader of the \"Tonight Show\" for 25 years. In 2007, however, the town's mayor caused a sensation when she posted photos of herself in bra and panties on the town's firetruck on her MySpace page. She was recalled by voters.\n\nThe town is small (524 in 2000) and not prosperous. Its largest employer is the 700-acre Columbia Ridge Landfill, where Seattle and Portland dump their trash.\n\n— Joan Harvey\n\nDOUGLAS COUNTY\n\nRoseburg, by any other name\n\nFirst known as Deer Creek, it wrested the coveted designation as county seat from the nearby rival of Winchester in 1854. Important buildings in Winchester were moved to the new county seat --and the town renamed Roseburgh.\n\nThat would be after Aaron Rose, a well-known gentleman of German Jewish heritage who settled in the area in 1851. He was well-known because he ran a public tavern in his home and the first roadside inn in the vicinity. He donated $1,000 and three acres of his 640-acre farm for the new courthouse. Besides being a successful farmer, he owned a butcher shop and general store, and traded horses.\n\nRose also served in the territorial Legislature and helped to build the wagon road from Roseburg to Coos Bay, to dam the South Umpqua River and to get the railroad to pass through town.\n\nWhy not name the town after a deserving citizens?\n\nRose died in 1899 --but not before the \"h\" was officially dropped from the spelling of the town five years before. A Roseburgh, it turns out, is a Roseburg.\n\n— Joan Harvey\n\nDESCHUTES COUNTY\n\n3 brothers, 3 sisters, 2 towns\n\nThe Three Sisters Mountains provide a beautiful backdrop to the nearby town of Sisters.\n\nThe mountains dominate the landscape of much of central Oregon, easily seen from the town of Brothers, a little more than 60 miles to the southeast.\n\nSisters the town got its start in the 1880s as a commercial area but wasn't incorporated until 1946. The Three Sisters --named Mounts Faith, Hope and Charity by early settlers --are volcanic peaks in the Cascade Range, each more than 10,000 feet high. The town itself was of course named for those nearby peaks.\n\nThe naming of the town of Brothers isn't quite so obvious.\n\nOne early history says Brothers, which established its post office in 1913, got its name because several groups of brothers settled in the area.\n\nAn article in the Prineville Central Oregonian in 1970 said differently. An early homesteader named Charley Houston, it reported, came up with the name. Houston just needed a name for a sheep camp, and he noticed the similarity of three nearby hills, with the peaks of Three Sisters looming in the background. So the camp was named Three Brothers sheep camp.\n\nOver time, the town that grew up around the camp became known as Brothers.\n\n— Mia C. Bush\n\nCURRY COUNTY\n\nGrateful for a man called Sam\n\nIf you have but one chance to soak up the open Oregon shoreline, here's a sweet spot with 12 magnificent miles that hug the shore: Samuel H. Boardman State Park, named for the man in 1950.\n\nIf you've ever visited, hiked, sunned, taken photographs, picnicked or otherwise enjoyed one of Oregon's 228 state parks, thank Boardman.\n\nThe first state parks superintendent, he leapt quickly to buy and preserve land --from 46 state parks of about 4,000 acres when he took office in 1929 to 181 parks with more than 60,000 acres when he retired 23 years later. Boardman believed a bounty of state parks would spark tourism. It did. He also believed this would conserve the state's scenic resources. Right again.\n\nBoardman's park, which boasts the best of Oregon's open coastline with seaside prairies, 300-year-old Sitka spruce trees, Arch Rock and Natural Bridges, small sand beaches and rugged cliffs, is part of the 27-mile of the Oregon Coast Trail.\n\nHike it with a camera. Boardman, a town in northeast Oregon, also is named for the man they called Sam.\n\nThe man who saved so much of the state for us.\n\n— Mia C. Bush\n\nCROOK COUNTY\n\nThis is not a pillar of accuracy\n\nWe all make spelling mistakes. But imagine the annoyance of having a little piece of Oregon named for you --and the name is wrong.\n\nForgive the misspelling, U.S. Army Maj. Enoch Steen.\n\nBecause Steins Pillar is one impressive 350-foot monolith that juts out of the Ochoco Mountains in central Oregon. Just one of several funky rock formations in the area, it's about 12 miles east of Prineville and towers above the treetops.\n\nThe pillar is made of rhyolite ash that spewed during eruptions in the Cascades, settled in an inland sea and compacted to stone. It is a popular, challenging and dangerous site for climbers. While weathering hardened its surface, the rock underneath is soft and crumbly. A two-mile trail --a moderately difficult hike on a juniper- and sage-covered high desert terrain --leads to the base of the pillar.\n\nSteen, who fought against the Snake Indians in 1860, got a second chance. This time, the spelling is right: Steens Mountain.\n\nAnd another thing: This county's not loaded with crooks. It was named for U.S. Army Maj.-Gen. George Crook, another veteran of the Snake Indian wars.\n\n— Mia C. Bush\n\nCOOS COUNTY\n\nIt's easier to find this Remote\n\nOnce upon a time, Remote was in the middle of nowhere, its early pioneers far from other settlements.\n\nBut in the modern world, even Remote seems close enough, just 31 miles from Roseburg.\n\nThe town keeps its quaint, pioneer feel, though, with Coos County's last covered bridge, the 60-foot-long Sandy Creek Covered Bridge. It's short, but sweet.\n\nWith plentiful lumber, many of the state's early bridges were made of wood. Covering them helped protect their wooden platforms from the rain.\n\nBuilt in 1921, the Sandy Creek bridge has flared sides with windows on both sides, which flood the interior with light.\n\nOregon has the largest collection of covered bridges in the Western part of the United States -- though only 53 remain, down from a high of more than 300 in the 1930s.\n\nThe Sandy Creek bridge had fallen into disrepair by the 1980s but volunteers refurbished it. Don't expect to drive across it, though. It's for foot traffic only -- and there's even a picnic table inside to sit for a bit.\n\n— Mia C. Bush\n\nCOLUMBIA COUNTY\n\nProvide your own steam\n\nOregonians know how to share. And they're willing to turn practically anything into a hiking trail.\n\nEven what's left of old train tracks.\n\nOn any given day and in any season, equestrians, runners, walkers and bikers hop on board the 21-mile Banks-Vernonia State Trail. Part asphalt and gravel, the trail winds through forested areas, farmland and rural towns, crossing 12 bridges in the process.\n\nThis was Oregon's first rail-to-trail, the movement that acquired abandoned rail beds to be recycled for recreational use. In the 1920s, the railroad hauled lumber from the Oregon-American Mill in Vernonia to Portland. The mill closed in 1957, and the railroad closed with it. Oregon Parks and Recreation gained ownership of the right of way in 1990. A trail was born.\n\nWith views of the Coast Range foothills, The gentle grade offers an easy trip, and it can be accessed from several trailheads: Banks, Manning, Buxton, Tophill, Beavercreek and Vernonia. Also, the new Stub Stewart State Park can be accessed from near the Buxton trailhead.\n\nWith views of the Coast Range foothills and wildflowers, animals and trees, it's worth the walk. And listen. Just don't expect to hear any train whistles.\n\n— Mia C. Bush\n\nCLATSOP COUNTY\n\nWe like going nowhere\n\nCritics considered the Astoria-Megler Bridge the first \"bridge to nowhere.\"\n\nA ferry originally took travelers across the mouth of the Columbia River between Astoria and Washington, but the ferry shut down during the wild weather the place is know for. A bridge would eliminate delays advocates said. Construction began in August 1962, along with criticisms by those who wondered who would want to take a bridge from a small town to an empty shoreline.\n\nIt turns out, quite a few.\n\nIn the final five months of when it was finished in 1966, more cars used the bridge than was projected for the entire next year. Designed by William A. Bugee, the project cost $24 million paid for by tolls until 1993. By then, more than 1.6 million vehicles crossed the bridge --and nearly 2.6 million in 2004.\n\nThe Astoria-Megler Bridge is the longest bridge in Oregon (21,474 feet) and longest continuous truss bridge in the world, with its main span 1,232 feet long.\n\nThe bridge, normally open only to vehicles and bikes, has been the site of a 10K run/walk in mid-October for almost 30 years. Participants start on the Washington side and end in Astoria.\n\n— Mia C. Bush\n\nCLACKAMAS COUNTY\n\nA rock far from home\n\nThe 15.5-ton Willamette Meteorite has been steeped in controversy since farmer Ellis Hughes spotted it in 1902 on a hillside in West Linn. He dragged the ancient, pocked rock to his property from land owned by Oregon Iron and Steel. The company sued to get it back and won.\n\nThe company displayed it during the 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland. A year later, a wealthy New York woman bought the meteorite for $20,600 and donated it to the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe largest meteorite ever found in the United States, it rested for thousands of years near present-day West Linn and is considered a sacred object by the Clackamas people. The Clackamas are one of many tribes banded together under the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde umbrella.\n\nKnown as \"Tomanowos\" or \"heavenly visitor\" to the Clackamas, the meteorite was thought to heal and give power to tribal members.\n\nThe tribes have requested the meteorite's return. But meanwhile, they reached an agreement with the museum in 2000 that allows tribal members to conduct a private ceremony around it once a year. Also, ownership will be transferred to the tribes should the museum stop using it for display.\n\n— Mia C. Bush\n\nBENTON COUNTY\n\nA place of supreme salubrity\n\nHow does a senator from Missouri get an Oregon county named after him?\n\nIn the early 1800s Thomas Hart Benton championed settling the West. He was an early and passionate advocate of what became known as Manifest Destiny, the belief that the United States was ordained and destined by God to expand across the continent.\n\nOregon Territory caught his eye during six trips here -- and inspired his oratory.\n\nHe told the U.S. Senate about the lands at the mouths of the Snake and Yakima rivers: \". . . this desert has its redeeming points -- much water, grass, many oases, mountains capped with snow, to refresh the air, the land, and the eye -- blooming valleys -- a clear sky, pure air and a supreme salubrity.\"\n\nSalubrity indeed.\n\nActive in law, politics and journalism, Benton's ideas stirred controversy. Easterners were concerned that a large population movement West would shift power. And Oregon's statehood bid became entangled with pro- and anti-slavery politics.\n\nToday, the county is remarkable for Oregon State University in Corvallis, a center of intellectual thought and scientific research for the state --and the world.\n\nBenton himself died in 1858, never to see Oregon become a state. But he's not forgotten. In fact, Benton County pops up in more than half a dozen states in the union.\n\n— Mia C. Bush\n\nBAKER COUNTY\n\nBorn in gold and war\n\nSumpter was born with the discovery of gold and christened by a connection to the then-raging Civil War.\n\nIn 1862, a group of men from South Carolina headed for the gold fields of California stopped near what is now Cracker Creek. Put gold prospectors near a creek, and they'll try their luck. Eureka! They found gold in the creek and decided to stay.\n\nThe men named the town Fort Sumter, after the South Carolina fort where the war had erupted the year before. But the post office, to avoid confusion, changed the spelling to Sumpter in 1883.\n\nThe town boomed about 1895 thanks to the pneumatic drill, mills to crush ore and new methods to chemically separate gold from its alloys. Miners hammered millions of dollars in gold from the mines. By the census in 1903, Sumpter had 3,500 registered voters, which didn't include women, children or Chinese (though Oregon mines attracted mostly single men, many with unsavory reputations).\n\nIt all came to a fiery end in August 1917. Three hours later, Sumpter lay in ruin with nearly 100 buildings in 12 city blocks destroyed. No one died, but with hard-rock mining winding down anyway and saloons closing with Prohibition, miners moved on.\n\nToday, Sumpter's 200 or so residents rely on tourists lured by the Old West image. There's even gold panning lessons --but good luck finding any nuggets.\n\n— Mia Bush"
