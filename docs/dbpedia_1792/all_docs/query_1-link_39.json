        "text": "Bridal Veil Creek Canyoneering Canyoning Caving\n\nIntroduction\n\nA classic Columbia Gorge canyon with a minimal approach and return. Sadly, there are a number of dumped cars in the creek (reportedly 13 at one count); likely attempts at insurance fraud. Be ready for some jungle bushwhacking and creek walking at the beginning before reaching R1. Note that this canyon holds a good amount of water late into the season.\n\nBeware poison oak on the approach and exit.\n\nWatershed: 5.8mi^2. Checkpoint is from the bridge on the Old Columbia River Highway where it crosses the creek.\n\nRed Tape Updates 2023:\n\nPlease review the Exit section below for information on property issues on the hike out.\n\nThe West Columbia Gorge lead, David Spangler, has requested canyoneers please do not run the lower falls (R5 & R6) on Bridal Veil Creek due to public safety concerns.\n\nApproach\n\nDrop a car at the exit: the parking lot for the official Bridal Veil Falls off the Old Columbia River Hwy.\n\nEither walk or shuttle 0.5mi east on the old highway east. (If on foot, use caution as there is no shoulder in some area and vehicles come barreling through here. It might be possible to bushwhack up to the Palmer Mill road direct and shave off some distance, but this has not been explored.) Just before the Angel's Rest trailhead, turn off right on Palmer Mill Rd and right again immediately. Palmer Mill is one lane, steep, and eroded in spots, but can be driven carefully by 2WD as of 2020. Follow it up for 1.5mi up to a spot where the road take a 90-degree left turn. There's room here for a copule cars at a pullout. There are two options for entering the creek:\n\nShortcut Approach: Backtrack 0.25mi down Palmer Mill the way you came to a gully. Take the gully down to the creek on an emerging use trail. Drop-in takes you in just before the first rappel. You will miss some nice bedrock going this way, however.\n\nClassic Approach: From the pullout, bushwhack down the nose of the ridge directly into the creek. It's steep and scrambly in spots, and becomes a jungle near the bottom, but doable. There is a lengthy stretch of annoying creek-walking before you reach the bedrock.\n\nDescent\n\nIn high water, the descent can be quite technical. Several drops may have hydraulics present at the bottom. Experienced swiftwater canyoneers will have a blast rappeling in the watercourse and negotiating these problems, while beginners may prefer to bypass them by rappelling out of the watercourse.\n\nA short drop (easily downclimbed) with three dumped cars marks the beginning of the technical section.\n\nR1: Upper Bridal Veil Falls 100ft dry rappel from tree DCL. An anchor DCR might help keep you in the flow. It is possible to escape below R1 on a steep user-trail up to the road.\n\nThe bedrock below R1 is a delight and a highlight of the canyon.\n\nR2: 15ft from single bolt DCL. Or, downclimb half way and jump DCL into a pool with a 5ft deep hole. Beware rocks in the center of the pool. Scout it first!\n\nR3: 25ft from tree DCL. Rappel off the side of the tree towards the falls, but throw the pull side off the back (downstream) for an easy retrieval.\n\nR4: Middle Bridal Veil Falls: 90ft from a boulder DCR (anchor may be underwater in high flow) or tree DCL (dry rappel). Use caution when deploying ropes as there are two large metal cables leftover from the logging days hanging down the DCL side of the falls. Deep pool at the bottom.\n\nExit\n\nHistorically, canyoneers would use an overgrown use trail on the DCL / west side of the creek. It starts just under a fallen log below R4 and leads all the way to bridge, never straying far from the creek. Takes about 15min. Be aware, however, everything west of the creek is private land and the local owner is not friendly to canyoneers (waterfall photographers okay). To avoid potential issues, it may be better to stay in the creek (i.e. right on the property line) or bushwhack along the east side (State Park land). Another option, while unpleasant, might be to exit up to the Palmer Mill Road after R4. Be aware: Middle Bridal Veil Falls is not on state park land; it is clearly inside Mt. Hood National Forest.\n\nExit the creek upon reaching the bridge.\n\nBridal Veil Falls\n\nRunning R5 & R6 is not recommended; please see \"Red Tape\" below.\n\nR5 & R6: Bridal Veil Falls, a two-tier waterfall and major tourist attraction. As of 9/20/23, the land manager, David Spangler has asked that we DO NOT run this section for public safety concerns. This is a reasonable ask. R5: Huge Tree back DCR, 120’. R6: Sunken railroad tie and metal spike mid stream, 50’. Both falls have deep pools at the bottom with potential hydraulics in high flow. You will likely have a crowd watching you from the viewing platform. Follow the trail back to the parking area.\n\nRed tape\n\nPlease avoid private land on the west side of the creek below R4.\n\nBridal Veil Falls (R5 & R6) is one of a number of popular waterfalls located along the Historic Columbia River Highway. Individuals climbing, rappelling, or slack-lining around such \"show waterfalls\" are far more likely to garner negative reactions from the general public at large. Negative reactions can lead to complaints and more canyon rules/regulations by the local authorities. As of September 2023, Columbia River Gorge West lead, David Spangler, has requested that canyoneers please refrain from running the last two falls on the creek. Let's please respect the request in the interests of maintaining good relations with local land managers.\n\nBeta sites\n\nCanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org) : Bridal Veil Creek\n\nSuper Amazing Map : Bridal Veil Creek\n\nTrip reports and media\n\nBackground\n\nBride of Hercules Falls\n\nThis is an 80ft falls located on a small seasonal creek immediately west of the Bridal Veil Falls parking area. This creek likely only runs during the winter months and is just a short fun objective if you're looking to get your quick \"rappel fix\" in the off-season. No real difficulties. Nice & splashy. From the parking area, walk northwest down the paved trail. Just before the first viewpoint, veer off west and drop down to the creek. Requires a little bushwhacking, but not that bad. Anchor is a large tree DCL atop the falls. At the bottom, follow westward along the base of the cliffs until you can find a way to scramble back up to the top. Takes 20-30min tops. Beware poison oak and blackberry in the area -- another good reason to visit only in the winter."
