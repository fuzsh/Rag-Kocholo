        "text": "Bridal Veil Falls\n\nRoughly 140 feet high and 40 feet wide, viewers can watch the elegant Bridal Veil Falls cascading down Larch Mountian from a special viewing platform. Water flow is significant throughout the entire year and one can hear it's thunderous roar well before seeing the falls.\n\nPlatform is accessable from Bridal Veil Falls State Park where there is a hiking trail that takes you directly to the falls. This trail is about a mile round trip to the falls and back.\n\nElowah Falls & McCord Creek Falls\n\nAccessed from John B Yeon State Park, there is a gentle rising trail that permits access to two of the most beautiful and secluded waterfalls in the Columbia River Gorge; Elowah Falls (left) and McCord Creek Falls.\n\nOne of the tallest falls in the gorge, Elowah Falls has a 289 foot drop over basalt. The view of these falls is spectacular. The trails are not usually crowded and the crisp air, easy access and accompanying scenery of this area offer some of the best hiking and viewing opportunities available in the Gorge. The falls flow year round, but are best in the late winter and spring, like many others in the area.\n\nMultnomah Falls\n\nPlummeting 620 feet from its origins on Larch Mountain, Multnomah Falls is the second highest year-round waterfall in the United States. Nearly two million visitors a year come to see this ancient waterfall. From the information center, visitors can hike the 1.2 mile trail that climbs approximately 600 feet to the top of Multnomah Falls. This trails provides great views of the falls and the Columbia River Gorge.\n\nBenson Bridge, crafted by Italian stone masons, allows visitors to cross the falls between it's lower and upper cataracts. There is also a USDA Forest Service Information Center, a snack bar, and a gift shop. Their is also a restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner in the nearby lodge.\n\nMill Creek Falls\n\nMill Creek Falls is a 175 foot high waterfall located in Prospect, Oregon, along Oregon State Route 62. Viewed from across the Rogue River Canyon where visitors are advised to be careful at the edge of the gorge, as it slopes off very steeply into the river.\n\nBarr Creek Falls\n\nOnly a few hundred yards from Mill Creek Falls, one can see one of Southern Oregon's tallest waterfalls with its 200 foot drop.\n\nBoth of these waterfalls can be viewed from a 1/2 mile trail that starts at the Mill Creek Falls Scenic Area parking lot which is located off Highway 62, just 45 miles from downtown Medford. Watch for the sign for Mill Creek Falls (Prospect Access Road), and take a left at the \"T\" in the road, following the signs for Mill Creek Falls. The parking area is about 1/2 a mile from the turnoff.\n\nAlthough spring is generally considered the peak season for waterfall viewing, there's still an impressive amount of water coming over these waterfalls during the fall. For those interested in exploring some of the area's back roads, one can drive along County Road 992, which leads from Prospect to Butte Falls. The fall color along the road is especially nice in October and November.\n\nInformation: Prospect Ranger Station (541) 560-3400."
