        "text": "Audrey + Kate\n\nWhat better place for two brides to elope, than this little treasure in the Columbia River Gorge known as Bridal Veil Falls?!\n\nAudrey + Kate met while working as science camp counselors in Southern California. \"We started spending time together almost immediately after meeting\", muses Kate, and these two gorgeous brides are now living in Texas, where they love spending time outdoors together, adventuring, and going on road trips. Speaking of road trips, Kate's parents live in a fifth-wheel trailer full time, having many adventures of their own!\n\nHere's what Audrey says on the decision to elope, \"let's just fly to your parents and have your mom marry us! Kate’s family has been our rock during the course of our relationship. It was then that it clicked for us that having a “traditional” wedding was our attempt to please lots of other people. Especially because my parents are not supportive of our relationship, eloping allowed us to make the day truly just about us and what we both hold most dear.\"\n\nKate's parents had been adventuring and exploring up and down Oregon for a few weeks before Audrey + Kate's elopement, so a beautiful location in the Pacific Northwest seemed like a natural fit! \"Tying the knot in a beautiful outdoor space just made sense for us! We couldn’t resist the irony of two brides getting married at a waterfall named “Bridal Veil Falls,” so we picked that spot, invited my brother to fly up, and asked my mom to become an officiant.\" says Kate.\n\nWe met with Audrey, Kate, Kate's parents and her brother bright and early, where the air was crisp, the Columbia River was still, and the world was just waking up.\n\n[For those considering an elopement, we are big advocates for sunrise and sunset elopements! Stunning light, less crowds, and more time to enjoy the day with your partner!]\n\nAudrey + Kate were donned in whimsical Free People dresses, that really reflected their adventurous spirits. Armed with their bouquets, Audrey + Kate headed to the base of Bridal Veil Falls for their elopement ceremony. Oregon's color palette couldn't resist shining, with stunning tones of greens and earthy hues decorating the trail to Bridal Veil Falls.\n\nAt the base of Bridal Veil Falls lies a boulder with just enough space for a few people to stand. Yep, this was it! Their elopement ceremony spot. Kate’s mom officiated a lovely and moving ceremony, complete with a handfasting ritual, as Kate’s father and brother looked on. Audrey + Kate recited their heartfelt vows to each other, the roar of rushing water as a soundtrack in the cool morning air.\n\nOnce these two brides were official, Kate’s family set out back toward the trailhead, so that Audrey + Kate could enjoy some serene moments basking in their newly married status. Rock hopping, dancing in a sunlit field, and little tender snuggles for these two before a mimosa toast overlooking the Columbia River. Audrey + Kate have a penchant for IPAs, so we couldn’t resist bringing some local brew for these two Texans to enjoy!\n\nPlanning an elopement from out of state can seem like a daunting task, but that’s what we are here for! Helping with vendor recommendations, coordinating logistics and planning, location suggestions...our goal is to remove as much of your stress as we can. Sometimes making the choice to elope can be overwhelming [especially if family may not agree: see our article Eloping: What About Friends and Family?] so we want to make things go as smoothly as possible for you + your partner. What is paramount is that you two are having fun, doing something you enjoy, and getting MARRIED!"
