        "text": "Bridal Veil Falls is a mesmerizing natural wonder nestled within the breathtaking Columbia River Gorge area of Oregon. This enchanting waterfall cascades gracefully down moss-covered cliffs, creating an ethereal veil of mist that lends it its romantic name.\n\nThe falls are known for their picturesque beauty, with a height of approximately 120 feet and a picturesque pool at their base. The surrounding lush greenery and towering trees add to the allure, making it a must-visit destination for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike.\n\nBridal Veil Falls offers visitors a chance to immerse themselves in the tranquility of nature, with hiking trails that wind through the scenic landscape, providing stunning viewpoints and ample opportunities for photography. It’s a place where the beauty of Oregon’s natural wonders truly shines, captivating visitors with its serene ambiance and captivating charm.\n\nAbout Bridal Veil Falls Trail\n\nThe trail is very short, 0.5 miles, and is quite easy with only a 78 ft elevation gain. It typically takes around 14 minutes on average to hike and is popular with birding enthusiasts, hikers, and runners, thus you can anticipate encountering fellow visitors during your exploration.\n\nThe optimal periods to embark on this trail span from March to October. While dogs are permitted, as usual, it expect you keep them leashed throughout your visit.\n\nWhere is Bridal Veil Falls Trail?\n\nBridal Veil Falls is located in the Columbia River Gorge area of Oregon, approximately 28 miles east of Portland. It is a relatively short and scenic drive from Portland, taking around 40 minutes to reach the falls by car.\n\nBoth parking and bathrooms are available at the trailhead just off the Historic Columbia River Highway at Bridal Veil Falls State Scenic Viewpoint.\n\nBridal Veil Permit Information\n\nNo permits are needed on the Historic Columbia River Highway (US-30) this year to see Bridal Veil Falls. However, if your trip falls between May and September, you will require a permit to access Multnomah Falls from I-84 E/US-30. If you are coming from Portland, this is past Bridal Veils to the east.\n\nThe permit fee for this particular period is $2 per vehicle, and State Parks Staff will verify the permits along the route. Avoid driving too far eastward on US-30, as you will hit massive traffic when you get to Multnomah, especially on a sunny summer day.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhat makes Bridal Veil Falls unique is its captivating beauty and serene ambiance.
