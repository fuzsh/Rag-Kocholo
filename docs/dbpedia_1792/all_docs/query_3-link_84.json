        "text": "Drawing over 4.5 million visitors a year, and ranking as one of the most visited national parks in the United States, it can seem like Rocky Mountain National Park is a headache to visit in the high season. I mean, who goes into nature for crowds, amIright? Thankfully, there are approximately 355 miles of hiking trails and plenty of ways to get off the beaten path!\n\nThough not entirely off the beaten path since it is fairly close to Estes Park, Bridal Veil Falls is one of those hikes that takes you away from entrance gate lines and the madness that is the Bear Lake Corridor in the summer months. I set my sights on chasing this waterfall on a cool and misty late-August Saturday morning.\n\nArriving shortly after 10am, I nabbed the last spot in the very small parking area at the Cow Creek Trailhead, which is located on the graveled McGraw Ranch Road. From here it was a short walk down the road and through McGraw Ranch, which was purchased by the National Park Service in 1988 and is used as a research facility.\n\nThe trail gradually narrowed down to singletrack as I traversed through still-lush meadows (how is it the end of August and still looking like this?!) along Cow Creek. Though there is almost 1000 feet of elevation gain during this hike, the ascent felt gentle. Although all the parking spots were taken, I found myself in solitude, aside from a gaggle of turkeys out for a morning waddle.\n\nBefore long, the trail turned mossy and rocky as I continued to follow Cow Creek. Definitely not the normal vibe of Colorado in late August, and I was loving it! Finally I came to the steep scramble up to Bridal Veil Falls. At first I was confused (see photo) as the trail appears to split, so I ventured off to the left to find that did not take me where I wanted to go. I backtracked and headed up the steep rock slabs, which were semi-sketchy due to the moisture.\n\nBridal Veil Falls is named as such due to its tiers as Cow Creek falls over impressive granite slabs like a… what for it…. bridal veil. Earlier in the season when snowmelt is at its max it is virtually impossible to cross the creek to continue on (and the whole hike can become a muddy, soggy affair), but thankfully in late August I was able to carefully pick my way across and find a suitable rock to eat a quick snack. There was another large group at the waterfall, so I finally found some of the other people!\n\nSnack break complete, I decided to scramble up to get a better view of the upper part of the falls. It was steep and questionable but I found the view to be more impressive than just visiting the base of the main waterfall.\n\nI spent roughly fifteen minutes at the waterfall. The hike out was quick, and I even got to see my turkey friends a second time. I watched as the mist roiled over the surrounding mountain tops, hoping any rain would hold off.\n\nDone and dusted, the whole hike was a shorty at two hours and forty minutes. I do usually have a rule I have to adventure for longer than my drive time, but since this hike was part of a bigger trip to obtain up my backcountry permit for the following weekend at the wilderness office and to pick up a new sleeping bag at REI in Fort Collins, I was okay that I drove a total of four hours for it.\n\nI definitely would add Bridal Veil Falls to a list of easier and possibly family friendly hikes in Rocky Mountain National Park (though the final scramble definitely can be a bit difficult – without going to the falls it is still a beautiful hike!). I’m not exactly a fan of repeating hikes, but I’d add this one to the list of ones I would repeat! The hike is also an option throughout the winter months, with snowshoers reaching the falls."
