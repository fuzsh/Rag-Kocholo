Initial consultations are usually free or discounted: Lawyer Referral Service\n\nCommitted to Public Service\n\nWe will always provide free access to the current law. In addition, we provide special support for non-profit, educational, and government users. Through social entre­pre­neurship, we’re lowering the cost of legal services and increasing citizen access.\n\nThe legislature occasionally skips outline levels. For example:\n\n(3) A person may apply [...] (4)(a) A person petitioning for relief [...]\n\nIn this example, (3), (4), and (4)(a) are all outline levels, but (4) was omitted by its authors. It's only implied. This presents an interesting challenge when laying out the text. We've decided to display a blank section with this note, in order to aide readability.\n\nDo you have an opinion about this solution? Drop us a line."
