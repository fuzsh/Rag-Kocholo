        "text": "(Sadly, in September of 2017, the Eagle Creek Fire, a human caused wildfire, destroyed much of the Gorge Scenic Area. Areas east of Multnomah Falls past Cascade Locks and nearly to Starvation Creek. It may not be accessible for many years. See map)\n\nUPDATE, May 2018. From what I've heard from people who've been there, these are the waterfalls still accessible: Multnomah, Latourell, Bridal Veil. I'm not sure about Horsetail Falls. It's right next to the road just a bit east of Multnomah, so maybe?\n\nIf you want to visit the area anyway, consider those few available falls as well as the falls on the Washington side. Also consider going to Silver Falls State Park, which is just east of Salem, OR.\n\nThe Columbia River Gorge is a dream location for waterfall lovers and it’s one of my favorite places to photograph. Not only is it easy to get to, but the waterfalls are very photogenic and many of them are easily accessed.\n\nThis short guide will cover the most popular and easily accessed waterfalls along with a couple other photo destinations. This is by no means exhaustive; there are a lot more waterfalls to explore on both sides of the Columbia River.\n\nThe Columbia River Gorge is only 20 or 30 minutes west of Portland, OR on Interstate 84. The Columbia River Gorge Scenic Highway (Hwy 30), where you’ll be able to access many of the falls, can be accessed from I-84 at a number of points.\n\nThe first is at the town of Troutdale at exit 17. The next is at Corbett at exit 22. The third is exit 28 at Bridal Veil, and then exit 35 near Dodson.\n\nHere’s a handy map. Open it up and follow along. If you’re planning on some hiking, grab this map too. These and others are also available at the Multnomah Falls visitors center.\n\nOne thing to know about many of these falls is that even on a sunny day, you can photograph them if you’re there early or late enough. They all face north and for the most part are in little gorges that block out the sun until mid-morning. By late afternoon the shade is back.\n\nAnd a general word of caution. The areas surrounding waterfalls are wet and often slippery. Stream sides can be very slipper. So be sure to exercise caution. Bring along a hiking staff for extra balance or simply use your tripod as a hiking staff.\n\nEagle Creek trail: This is where you’ll find Metlako and Punchbowl Falls. Punchbowl is about 2 miles from the trailhead. The trail is very scenic and it has its ups and downs.\n\nUPDATE: In 2018, after the devastating Eagle Creek fire, two landslides have forever change the views of these two falls. As mentioned above in the Punchbowl Falls caption, the cliff collapse has rerouted Eagle Creek and placed a pile of rubble right where we used to be able to see the falls. In the case of Metlako Falls, the viewing area is no longer there. That area has collapsed into the creek below and Metlako is no longer viewable. I'll leave the site description below. Mainly because it hurts to remove it.\n\nThis is a popular trail and the parking can fill very quickly, especially on a weekend. So plan on starting your hike early. There are other practical reasons for starting early that I’ll mention below. For directions, take a look here. This is also national forest land so you will need a Forest Pass. There is a pay station in the parking lot in case you don't have a pass.\n\nMetlako Falls is about 1.5 miles from the trailhead. There’s a short side trail that leads to a viewpoint. But you need to pay attention because it’s easy to miss the sign. There’s really only the one vantage point so you won’t need to spend much time here before continuing on to Punchbowl.\n\nThere are two vantage points for Punchbowl Falls: the upper view and the streamside view. To get to the upper view, keep going past the trail junction that leads down to the stream. It’s not far. But the better shot is from stream level.\n\nThe side trail down to Punchbowl is where the trail gets the steepest. Use caution when you get to the bottom; you’ll have to cross some rocks that can be slippery.\n\nPunchbowl Falls itself may or may not be visible from the shores of Eagle Creek, that all depends on the water levels. These days, whenever I go I bring a pair of chest waders in case I need to photograph from the middle of the stream. You may opt to wear shorts and go barefoot. Or just plan on getting wet. The rocks in the stream bed are usually slippery, so be careful. The water can be cold too, and a cool spring morning will make it feel even colder.\n\nPunchbowl Falls is really popular. I’d suggest starting the hike early, right around sunrise. I suggest this for a couple of reasons. The first is people. After a while, people will start showing up. Generally it’s not too much of a problem since most visitors will only wade out to see the falls for a short time and so won’t be in your shots long, if at all. But if water levels are low and you can see the falls from the shore, you might have to exercise a lot of patience. So, go early.\n\nThe second reason to get there early is the sun. If it’s a sunny day, contrast will kill things rather early. I don’t remember exactly when the sun will ruin the scene, probably by 9 a.m.?? Anyway, get there early enough so that neither the crowds nor the sun will be an issue.\n\nThere are other falls to photograph if you want to continue up the Eagle Creek trail. You can find out more about them from the Waterfall Lovers book included in the references at the end of this guide.\n\nTriple Falls. This is a hike. It doesn’t look far on a map but when you’re carrying your photo gear, it seems to go on forever. There are a couple of ways to get here. My suggestion is to take the route that brings you to Ponytail falls first and then continue on the same trail. After a while you’ll take some switchbacks down to a bridge crossing Oneonta creek (at this point you’ve hiked about one and a quarter miles). Here you’ll have a view of a waterfall often referred to as Middle Oneonta Falls. This may or may not be its official name.\n\nAfter spending some time here, continue across the bridge and head uphill to an intersection with the Oneonta Creek Trail. Go left and follow for about another mile (uphill) to Triple Falls.\n\nMy guide books states that this is a moderate trail. Ok.\n\nI mean, it’s not technically difficult, it’s just that it goes up. And up some more. And with camera gear on your back, it seems really up. Is it worth it? It’s a pretty waterfall, but if you’re short on time (or breath) feel free to skip it.\n\nThe accompanying shot of Triple Falls was taken at 34mm on my Nikon D300 (DX sensor). That would translate to about 50mm on a FX camera body like my D810 full frame.\n\nAt Ponytail, you’ll likely want to go wider. On my D300 I used a 12-24mm lens (18-36 on a full-frame) for landscape shots. If you want to isolate the waterfall, you’ll need to go longer.\n\nSo if you’ve got a wide angle zoom and a short telephoto zoom, that’s all you really need to carry. That makes room for extra water and snacks.\n\nIf you go, be sure to explore the area just past Triple Falls. You can see the bridge in the picture, where there's access to the stream."
