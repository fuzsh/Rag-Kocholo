        "text": "I thought my earlier question disappeared somehow .. or they added\n\nsomething to my cofee ;)\n\nI am going to Portland, Oregon on a business trip. At that time I am\n\nplanning on taking a 4 hour treking trip in and around Bridal Veil and\n\nMultnomah Falls and surrounding area. I am planning on staying at the\n\nBridal Veil B&B. I will take my N80 with 28-80 kit, 50/1.8 and 70-300\n\nED and plan on shooting Velvia.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on visiting any other place around\n\nthere instead? (since I don't have more time there, I will have to\n\ndrop one of these to go to your suggested place). Also any suggestions\n\non what filters could be more useful in that area at that time\n\n(overcast days, with fall foliage if I am lucky). Any suggestions are\n\nmore than welcome.\n\nThanks much!\n\nHello Hemen,\n\nIt sounds as if this is your first visit to the area. I believe that the Bridal Veil B & B is located along the old Scenic Highway so you will be in a good location.\n\nFour hours isn't much time to see the sights. You could spend the time, as many people do, simply driving along the highway and stopping at the pull-outs for different waterfalls--Latourelle, Bridal Veil, Wahkeena, Multnomah, Oneota, Horsetail, Elowah, etc. There are a number of waterfalls within a 10 to 20 mile stretch of highway. At each stop, you can get out of the car and find nice photographic opportunities within a few hundred yards of the highway. Multnomah Falls is the most famous, but also the most crowded.\n\nIf you enjoy hiking, most of the waterfall areas also offer the chance to follow trails up into the backcountry away from the highway. For example, at Wahkeena Falls, you can walk 1/4 mile to a bridge directly in front of the falls. Another 3/4 mile climb will take you to a nice overlook with a view of the Columbia River. Another 1/2 mile will take you along the creek to the enchanting Fairy Falls. Along the way you will see beautiful Northwest forest with moss, ferns, flowers, etc. So you could do a short walk at one location and also drive to see one or two other waterfalls. I greatly recommend a hike away from the highway to really experience the area, but you may want to spend your limited time seeing as many waterfalls as possible.\n\nThe weather is becoming a little uncertain at this time of year. You could have rain, or sun or overcast. As you noted, a polarizer can be useful for foliage, particularly if there is any moisture. The contrast between dark foliage and white water can be very extreme if there is sunshine, so a less contrasty film than Velvia could be in order. If the weather is overcast, and particularly if you hike back from the highway, the illumination may be low, so a tripod is a necessity. Obviously, a tripod is also necessary if you want to use slower shutter speeds to get a milky texture to the water. Also, don't overlook the possibility of macro shots of moss, ferns, etc. Enjoy.<div> </div>\n\nTake I-84 East to exit 22 (Corbett exit)\n\nDrive south to the Old Columbia Highway. After a short distance a park called the \"Women's Forum\" will be on your left. Nice views of the gorge and the Vista house. I was visiting friends a number of weeks ago and there was some restoration work at the Vista house. I hope it will be gone in your trip. Note that this park is a great sunset location.\n\nI would recommend what others have said, drive the Old Columbia Highway stopping at all the highlights. Multnomah Falls is not that crowded at this time of year.\n\nIf you bring some swimtrunks, you may want to stop at Lower Oneonta Falls, one of the nicest in the gorge (in my opinion). Its a short hike, part of it you have to go through water for a short distance. I would advise attempting to cling to the rocks to get around it.\n\nAlso, once you reach I-84 (at about exit 35), you can continue on to one of my other favorites, Wahclella Falls (at exit 40). It's just under a mile to the falls with a 300 ft climb (i.e., it's practically flat). Also they finally have rebuilt the lower bridge so there is a slight loop you can take. I would recommend taking the right fork when you come to it.\n\nNow if you really had time, you could do the Eagle Creek Trail (exit 41) where you can hike up to Punch Bowl Falls, even Tunnel Falls if you have time.\n\nBut that's for when you return for a pleasure trip. :)\n\nAlso, I would highly recommend this book: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/089886593X/qid=1097281831/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-5688580-4221724?v=glance&s=books\n\n<p>I am not much of a hiker myself (particularly with 20 lbs of camera gear) and I was\n\nalso\n\ntrying to see a lot of the area in a short amount of time. At Wahkeena and Horsetail, you\n\ncan see the falls from your car practically. Multnomah is neat to see, but very hyped and\n\nthe presence of a restaurant and gift shop there make it very busy. And being that your\n\nwidest angle is 28mm, you probably aren't going to get much with that... at least not\n\nenough to do the falls justice. But it's easy to park and go see it anyway. Latourell is also\n\nvery easy to get to. Compared to these, Bridal Veil is a hike. To get to\n\nBridal Veil, you hike a ways down, across and then back up. It's pretty, but wasn't actually\n\nmy favorite of all the falls. I really liked Wahkeena personally.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/eschrad/.Pictures/Photo%20Album%20Pictures/\n\n2003-01-09%2011.42.46%20-0800/ImageWahkeena_Falls.jpg\">Wahkeena Falls</a></\n\np>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~egschrad/Horsetail-Falls-sm.JPG\">Horsetail\n\nFalls</a></p>\n\n<p>Have a great trip!</p>"
