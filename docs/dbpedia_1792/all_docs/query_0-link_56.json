Unlimited guests.\n\nStarting at $450\n\n* No additional fee for travel within a 50-mile radius of Ashland. Discount if the ceremony takes place in Ashland’s Lithia Park or Downtown Ashland. We officiate across the Pacific Northwest, including Northern California. Limited availability. Inquire for availability and details.\n\nSOMETHING NEW IN 2024:\n\nA SAME DAY WEDDING\n\nTo keep up with the times and better respond to our couples’ inquiries, we are now offering a quick and easy option for your nuptials: a legal wedding with no ceremony.\n\nIf you are about to jet off for your wedding or elopement out of the country or are working with a photographer on an adventure elopement or in a rural part of Oregon with limited officiant services, if you’re getting deployed, or want to take the pressure off your upcoming big family wedding, or any other unforeseen circumstances, a Same Day Wedding may be exactly what you’re looking for.\n\nThe couple must have a valid State of Oregon marriage license and two witnesses — although we can usually assist with finding witnesses for an additional fee.\n\nAfter you acquire your license, set up an appointment to come to our office in Ashland, and we’ll take care of all the rest: completing the paperwork, a pronouncement of marriage, and the clerical logistical filing afterward. By the time you walk out the door to get on with your day, you’ll be legally married!\n\n$155\n\nMACY & MATTHEW’S WEDDING\n\nCapella by the Sea in Brookings, Oregon\n\nMeet Your Officiants\n\nKHALIQA\n\nBAQI\n\nWedding Officiant, Interfaith Chaplain\n\nKhaliqa is a passionate and skilled wedding officiant dedicated to working with couples in creating unforgettable ceremonies through ritual, connection, and the power of personal stories.\n\nMICHELE\n\nDUNCAN KING\n\nWedding Officiant, Celebrant .\n\nAs a wedding officiant and celebrant, Michele’s specialties are elopements and small, intimate weddings. Her favorite location is Lithia Park! She writes love stories and crafts ceremonies for all couples.\n\n\"After a few chats with Michele, she wrote a lovely program for our wedding. She incorporated our history as a couple, acknowledged our families, and included our Pug in the ceremony. She provided just enough humor and just enough seriousness for our morning ceremony...\"\n\nLinda C.\n\n\"Michele was absolutely amazing and said all the right words, couldn’t have said it better myself. We appreciate the professionalism and the personal touches she brought to the ceremony. Couldn’t have done it without her.\"\n\nGiahna H.\n\nKhaliqa was everything we could have asked for and more! She took the time to get to know us as a couple and was able to naturally express the beauty of our relationship. She made the entire process a breeze. She was able to beautifully articulate the commitment we were making and that meant so much to us. She is an absolute joy to have around on your speial day.\n\nH & E\n\n\"Michele was absolutely fantastic. She is an effective communicator and offered so much support throughout the entire process. So many people just go with a family member or friend for an officiant for an elopement; please don’t! You get so much more of an amazing experience working with a professional...\"\n\nM & M\n\n\"Michele was wonderful to work with for my daughter's wedding! She was very methodical in the planning, very thoughtful in her preparation and provided a very personalized ceremony...\"\n\nDiane B.\n\n\"Michele made our ceremony unique, sincere, and all the things we wanted it to be and more. My husband and I live a very different life than most folks (we are both organic vegetable farmers), and therefore, could not imagine a wedding that looked like anything we had been to or seen...\"\n\nMegan K.\n\n“Khaliqa was fabulous! We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant for our wedding. She worked with us to help create the most magical ceremony that felt personal and made just for us, while also adding her own touch and flare. It unexpectedly poured rain and she handled the twists and turns of the evening perfectly.”\n\nJ & J\n\n\"We were marrying after being together for several years, and I did not want a prolonged service. Michele took both my view and my groom's view and \"married\" them together for a service unique and special to us both. \"\n\nL & C\n\n\"I cannot praise Michele enough and there is no one I would rather have officiate such a momentous occasion.\"\n\nM & M\n\n\"She really went above and beyond in helping the frenzied mother of the bride deal with 35 mph winds for the outdoor ceremony and reception. You won't find a better officiant than Michele for your special event!\"\n\nD & B\n\n\"We knew we wanted it to be on our farm, to be nature based, zero waste, full of earthly things, non-commercial, incorporated family and non-religious. We both wanted something very intentional. Tall order, huh? Well Michele took all of those requests without a blink of the eye and got to work. She was able to help us discover exactly what we wanted.\"\n\nM & D\n\n\"She was great at presenting ideas and not becoming attached to them. She incorporated special pieces from our families. She created a ceremony that was \"non-traditional,\" that flowed, and that felt very true to us.\"\n\nMegan\n\n\"She was overall amazing! If I could, I would give Michele 6 stars out of 5. I highly recommend working with her, especially if you are after something just a bit different.\"\n\nM.K.\n\n\"Michele is a gem. I highly recommend her “out of the box ceremonies”! I just received my Poppy and Veil “Ceremony for New Beginnings” and my heart could not be happier! The attention to detail and mindful care that is contained within the package is beyond compare. What a beautiful collection of soulful resources and inspiration! Thank you so much! 💖🙏🌸\"\n\nShannon"
