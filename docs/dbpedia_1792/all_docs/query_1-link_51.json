It is one of the easier waterfalls to visit, though it actually cannot be seen directly from the road.\n\nIn order to view the falls, you have to head from the parking lot toward the trail and take the 1/4 mile trail. It does have a small gradient, but it is a beautiful trail. When I visited in early May, the trail was surrounded with Western Bleeding Hearts. The waterfall has a great viewing area at the end of the trail.\n\nDirections:\n\nFrom I-84, take Exit 28 and get onto the Historic Columbia River Highway.\n\nFrom the exit, look for milepost 28, where you’ll find the parking area for Bridal Veil Falls. It’s a little bit hidden, but not that hard to find at all.\n\nAccessibility: 8/10 (easy/moderate)\n\nHeight: 118′\n\nLength of Hike: 0.5 miles round-trip\n\nWhere in the World is Bridal Veil Falls?"
