        "text": "PIXEO is the passion project of Shawn and Lisette Kent, a husband and wife team of Canadian photographers. After travelling the world, they became frustrated with the effort and time required to find photo spots. Eventually, they had an idea for a photography app to help find photo spots. So in October 2017, Shawn and Lisette started PIXEO Inc. and worked with a premier Canadian app development firm, Mindsea, to build the most extensive collection of vetted and verified photo spots worldwide. This website and the free PIXEO App for iOS and Android, are the fruits of that labor. Today, Shawn and Lisette maintain thousands of carefully selected photo spots, add photos from around the world, and work hard to highlight the incredible work of other PIXEO contributors on PIXEOâ€™s Instagram and other social media platforms. They continue to build an unparalleled collection of global photo spots from their home in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."
