Bridal Veil Falls is a waterfall located on the Columbia River Gorge in eastern Multnomah County, Oregon in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.

The Historic Columbia River Highway passes over Bridal Veil Falls on a bridge. From a parking lot on the highway, a winding footpath and another bridge lead to a vantage point for the falls. The falls consists of two cascades in quick succession along angling rockfaces, so when there is a good amount of water the falls looks very much like its namesake.
