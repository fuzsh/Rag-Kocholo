        "text": "“Art in the ghetto allowed us to forget about everyday humiliations, it was an important part of life”, says Hanna Dzielińska (Hanka Warszawianka), journalist and tourist guide. The ninth part of ‘Remnants of the Ghetto’ deals with cultural life in the ghetto using the example of the Femina Theatre (1938-2014) at “Solidarity” 155 Avenue (formerly Leszno 35 Street) and its flagship artists: Jerzy Jurandot and Stefania Grodzieńska.\n\nMore about Femina is written by Dr. Agnieszka Witkowska-Krych in the 18th part of the column series, “Taste of ghetto life”: http://1943.pl/en/artykul/the-taste-of-life-in-the-ghetto-18/\n\n‘Remnants of the Warsaw Ghetto’ is a film series of 16 short guided tours presenting the history of places and people associated with them. The following places will be presented: Umschlagplatz; Anielewicz Mound; Szmul Zygielbojm Monument; Monument of the Ghetto Heroes; Grzybowski Square; Mariańska Street and the Nursing School; Nożyk Synagogue; Great Synagogue at Tłomackie Street; Nalewki Street; Femina Cinema Theater; Courts at Leszno Street; Chłodna Street; Waliców Street; The Jewish Cemetery at Okopowa Street, and the Bersohn and Bauman Hospital – the place where the permanent exhibition of the Warsaw Ghetto Museum will be created.\n\nThe series presentation accompanies the commemoration of 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto borders closing, organized by the Warsaw Ghetto Museum in cooperation with the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage and TSKŻ – the Social and Cultural Society of Jews in Poland. The main events took place on November 16, 2020."
