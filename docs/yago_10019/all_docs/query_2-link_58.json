BETWEEN”, directed by DAMIAN JOSEF NEĆ | The Jewish Theater in Warsaw\n\nDramaturgy, directed by: Damian Josef Neć, visualisations, costumes, stage designed by: Marta Wieczorek, Maciej Czuchryta, music: Sławomir Kupczak, choreography: Szymon Dobosik, assistant director: Patrycja Wysokińska, assistant stage designer: Wiktoria Grzybowska, vocal training: Teresa Wrońska, producer: Patrycja Superczyńska, language consultant, adaptation of the Yiddish script and transliteration: Aleksandra Król, stage management: Beata Szaradowska\n\nCast: Prospero – Henryk Rajfer, Ariel/Ferdynand – Jerzy Walczak, Miranda – Wanda Siemaszko, Stefano – Barbara Szeliga, Trinkulo – Joanna Przybyłowska, Antonio – Marek Węglarski, Kaliban – Marcin Błaszak\n\nFor the first time, “The Tempest” in Yiddish premiered in Łódź in 1938 at Folks un Jugnt-Teater.

Before the premiere, there were questions about how this play would be received in today’s Poland. One thing must be said: it resonated very strongly. The story of the Holocaust becomes a story about the potential consequences of modern discrimination. The director shows a dark, threatening and dangerous vision of the future on stage. Based on this performance, we can see that Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” is a universal warning”, wrote Paulina Feliksik in her review.\n\n“Der Szturem. Cwiszyn / The Tempest.
