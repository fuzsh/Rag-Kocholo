        "text": "IT'S NEARLY two months until the Oscars, with nominations for Spain's most famous off-screen acting couple, although it will have been 20 years since the country last took home a statuette â so film fans there are trying not to get their hopes up.\n\nAnd Spain's own version of the Oscars, the Goya Awards, are fast becoming just as famous.\n\nSaturday night's ceremony saw the first-ever International Goya presented, a brand-new category for 2022 â although its winner already has her feet firmly entrenched in the world of Spanish cinema.\n\nâAlmodÃ³var is disgustingly talented!â\n\nAustralian screen star Cate Blanchett is due to star in Pedro AlmodÃ³var's dÃ©but full-length English-language film, based upon Lucia Berlin's short story collection Manual for Cleaning Women â and Cate herself is very much an admirer of the Spanish mainstream arts scene.\n\nâWhen I was in high school I saw [Luis] BuÃ±uel [post-censorship film director], and it changed how I viewed the world,â Ms Blanchett, 52, admitted in her acceptance speech at Valencia's Palau de les Arts opera house after taking her trophy from Hollywood legend PenÃ©lope Cruz and AlmodÃ³var himself.\n\nThe star of Carol, Charlotte Grey and The House With a Clock in its Walls compared PenÃ©lope and AlmodÃ³var to other huge film-making twosomes such as Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes, and Katharine Hepburn and George Cukor, and laughingly said AlmodÃ³var was 'disgustingly talented'.\n\nShe concluded by wishing PenÃ©lope and her husband, Javier Bardem, the best of luck in the Oscars, where they are nominated for Best Actress and Best Actor respectively.\n\nCate admitted she did not speak Spanish beyond 'thank you and good night' to the audience, but says she hopes to learn the language during her time on set with Manual for Cleaning Women.\n\nJosÃ© SacristÃ¡n, 57 years of non-stop acting\n\nThis year's lifetime achievement award, or 'Honorary Goya', went to multiple prizewinner and prolific TV and film actor JosÃ© SacristÃ¡n, 84, whose first major production was in 1965 (La Familia y Uno MÃ¡s, or 'The Family and One More') and who has been acting and producing non-stop ever since â mainly involved in comedy features, SacristÃ¡n's most recent was in 2021, Cuidado Con Lo Que Deseas ('Be Careful What You Wish For').\n\nWhich films, cast and crew were nominated?\n\nReal-life situations with a dash of comedy, or an unpacking of the past leading to shock discoveries, facing one's demons or both, gritty and topical issues, and a truly cult cast, were the 'theme of the year' for the 2022 Goyas; the winners will probably not surprise you, other than a few outsiders â famous British actors included.\n\nHere are this year's nominations â see if you can work out how successful they might have been before you get to the bottom of this article, where we reveal the results.\n\nEl Buen PatrÃ³n ('The Good Boss')\n\nDirected by: Fernando LeÃ³n de Aranoa\n\nStarring: Javier Bardem, Almudena Amor, Celso Bugallo, Ãscar de la Fuente, Manolo Solo, MarÃ­a de Nati, Fernando Albizu, Mara Guil, Tarik Rmili, Nao Albet, YaÃ«l Belicha, Francesc Orella\n\nNominated for: Best Film, Best Lead Actor (Javier Bardem), Best New Actress (Almudena Amor), Best New Actor (Ãscar de la Fuente and Tarik Rmili), Best Original Script, Best Supporting Actress (Sonia Almarcha), Best Supporting Actor (Celso Bugallo, Manolo Solo and Fernando Albizu), Best Special Effects (RaÃºl Romanillos and MÃ­riam Piquer), Best Original Score (Zeltia Montes), Best Soundtrack (Pelayo GutiÃ©rrez, Valeria Arcieri), Best Director (Fernando LeÃ³n de Aranoa), Best Production (Luis GutiÃ©rrez), Best Artistic Direction (CÃ©sar MacarrÃ³n), Best Costume Design (Fernando GarcÃ­a), Best Hair and Makeup (Almudena Fonseca, Manolo GarcÃ­a), Best Cinematography (Pau Esteve Birba), Best Set Design (Vanessa Marimbert)\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nBlanco (Bardem), the charismatic owner of a company that manufactures industrial weighing scales in small-town Spain, is apprehensively awaiting a visit by a committee which will decide the firm's future â but everything seems to be conspiring against him.\n\nRacing against time, Blanco does his best to solve his staff's various problems â staff he considers part of his own family, practically his children â but in trying to keep them sweet, crosses just about every red line imaginable.\n\nMadres Paralelas ('Parallel Mothers')\n\nDirected by: Pedro AlmodÃ³var\n\nStarring: PenÃ©lope Cruz, Milena Smit, Rossy de Palma\n\nNominated for: Best Film, Best Lead Actress (PenÃ©lope Cruz), Best Supporting Actress (Aitana SÃ¡nchez-GijÃ³n and Milena Smit), Best Director (Pedro AlmodÃ³var), Best Artistic Direction (AntzÃ³n GÃ³mez) Best Cinematography (JosÃ© Luis Alcaine), Best Soundtrack (Marc Orts, Sergio BÃ¼rmann)\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nTwo single women who give birth at the same moment meet for the first time in the hospital and become close friends, despite seemingly having nothing in common.\n\nJanis, in her late 30s, a smart, chic, professional photographer, is pregnant by her ex-husband, a historian and anthropologist who works at the same hospital she is about to give birth in;

In real life and in the film, Jerzy wrote light-hearted plays as escapism, to help those in the ghetto forget their grim, terrifying situation.\n\nThe cast, backstage, are agonising over a life-or-death decision: Should they try to flee the ghetto after the curtain call, even though they would be in mortal danger if they were caught?\n\nBajocero ('Below Zero')\n\nDirected by: LluÃ­s QuÃ­lez\n\nStarring: Patrick Criado, Javier GutiÃ©rrez, Florin Opritescu, Ãdgar Vittorino, Karra Elejalde, Luis Callejo, Ãlex Monner\n\nNominated for: Best Set Design (Antonio Frutos)\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nOn a cold winter night, a vanload of prisoners is being transferred to another jail when it is held up by an armed gang on an empty highway, who seem to be looking for a specific person.\n\nDriver MartÃ­n barricades himself inside the vehicle with the inmates to protect them, making himself a human shield and all that stands between the prisoners and the attackers.\n\nDuring the long, freezing night held hostage, many of the men in the vehicle start to reflect on their lives of crime as these flash before their eyes.\n\nWho won?\n\nWith a mind-blowing 20 nominations and despite having missed out on the shortlist for a Best International Film Oscar this year, it was almost a given that El Buen PatrÃ³n was going to take home at least one award.\n\nAnd, in fact, Fernando LeÃ³n de Aranoa's office comedy with 'Bond baddie' Javier Bardem as the boss who likes to be liked but ends up getting on everyone's nerves pretty much swept the board, although Maixabel and Madres Paralelas were hot on its heels.\n\nThese are the main categories, and their winners:\n\nBest Film: El Buen PatrÃ³n\n\nBest Lead Actor: Javier Bardem for El Buen PatrÃ³n\n\nBest Lead Actress: Blanca Portillo for Maixabel\n\nBest New Actress: MarÃ­a Cerezuela for Maixabel\n\nBest New Actor: Chechu Salgado for Las Leyes de la Frontera\n\nBest Original Song: Te Espera el Mar, by MarÃ­a JosÃ© Llergo, for MediterrÃ¡neo\n\nBest Adapted Script: Las Leyes de la Frontera\n\nBest New Director: Clara Roquet for Libertad\n\nBest Original Script: El Buen PatrÃ³n\n\nBest Supporting Actress: Nora Navas for Libertad\n\nBest Supporting Actor: Urku OlazÃ¡bal for Maixabel\n\nBest Special Effects: Way Down\n\nBest Original Score: El Buen PatrÃ³n\n\nBest Soundtrack: Tres\n\nBest Director: Fernando LeÃ³n de Aranoa for El Buen PatrÃ³n\n\nBest Production: MediterrÃ¡neo\n\nBest Artistic Director: Balter Gallart for Las Leyes de la Frontera\n\nBest Costume Design: Las Leyes de la Frontera\n\nBest Hair and Makeup: Las Leyes de la Frontera\n\nBest Cinematography: MediterrÃ¡neo\n\nBest Set Design: El Buen PatrÃ³n\n\nOther categories\n\nBest Short Film in the Fiction category is TÃ³tem Loba ('Totem She-Wolf'), a drama by VerÃ³nica Echegui starring Isa MontalbÃ¡n as EstÃ­balÃ­z who accepts an invite from her school friend Raquel (Elisa Drabben) to go with her to her village fiestas â and what starts off as a fun road trip turns out to be a complete nightmare.\n\nTÃ³tem Loba beat nominees Farrucas, which starts with Handoum having a bad day in high school and shows her walking back to her home in the suburbs of AlmerÃ­a, on a day when her best friend, Fatema celebrates her 18th birthday;
