I am particularly grateful to Professor David Cesarani who supervised my thesis and with patience and extremely hard work made a historian out of a drama student. I will also always be indebted to Professor Andrzej Żbikowski from the Jewish Historical Institute, who gave me enormous support in every step of my work, beginning with my MA dissertation.\n\nI would also like to thank my PhD examiners Professor Antony Polonsky and Dr. François Guesnet, whose invaluable comments on my thesis and generous advice helped to shape this book. I am grateful for the support of my PhD advisers at Royal Holloway, Professor Dan Stone and Dr. Zoë Waxman, whose comments on my early work helped to save me from errors and guide my way.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank my family for making this work possible. My parents have continuously inspired me and given me confidence. Heather, Eric, and Kristina Wooddin gave me a home in England. Roger and Kot sat with me and provided emotional support. Finally, Jonathan read countless drafts, and was with me from the very first steps of this journey. This book would not exist without his help.\n\nMy work belongs to the Warsaw Ghetto survivors and their families who spoke to me about their experiences.

Polish Theater), one of Warsaw’s most illustrious stages, was finishing his work for the day. Like many other theater employees who lost their apartments in the bombings of September 1939 he was now living permanently in his office. It was only a few minutes past 9 pm, but, as he wrote in his memoir, because of the cold and the curfew imposed on the streets of Warsaw, he was used to going to sleep earlier than before the war. Suddenly, Szyfman heard a bang on the door and in the doorway appeared the building’s janitor followed by six Gestapo functionaries. The Germans searched the room thoroughly, asking him about the theater bonds, money, and jewelry. They were just about to leave, when, as Szyfman recalled, they saw his fur coat hanging on the door. Inspecting it, one of the Gestapo men asked why he did not wear an armband. Szyfman noted his answer in his memoir: I explained that I am not a Jew neither from nationality nor religion and that is why I do not wear it. They asked me if I know that this risks the death penalty. I replied that they threaten me unnecessarily.¹\n\nSzyfman was ordered to report to the Gestapo the next morning and was promptly imprisoned. Freed in the autumn of 1940, he left Warsaw for the countryside, where he survived the war. Thousands of others like him, Polish Jews or Poles of Jewish origin subjected to Nazi anti-Semitic legislation, followed in his footsteps, fleeing Warsaw or going into hiding. However, the vast majority of those who remained in a state of suspension, on the border of national and cultural identities, were not given this choice. In November 1940, with the closure of the Jewish Quarter in Warsaw, their fate became entwined with that of all of the victims of the Holocaust.\n\nThe Concept and Classification of Assimilation\n\nThe concepts of assimilation and acculturation evade clear definition. The borders separating assimilated and acculturated groups from other parts of the Jewish community are hazy, unclear, and ever changing. Nonetheless, at least as a starting point, some definition must be undertaken and such borders must be defined. Robert E. Park and Ernest W. Burgess, in one of the first and most influential works on assimilation, define it as a process of interpenetration and fusion in which persons and groups acquire the memories, sentiments, and attitudes of other persons or groups, and by sharing their experiences and history, are incorporated with them in a common cultural life.² Numerous other definitions, more or less rigid, have been proposed by those working on the history of Polish Jewry in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Yet, the murkiness of the concept and the difficulty of applying it to the specific context of the Polish-Jewish community have resulted in the term assimilation being less commonly used in more recent scholarship. Instead, the process of assimilation is broken down into various components discussed separately. Historian Todd Endelman defines four changes in Jewish behavior and status, which are usually encompassed by the term assimilation: acculturation (the acquisition of the cultural and social habits of the dominant non-Jewish group); integration (the entry of Jews into non-Jewish social circles and spheres of activity); emancipation (the acquisition of rights and privileges enjoyed by non-Jewish citizens/subjects of similar socio-economic rank); and secularization (the rejection of religious beliefs and the obligations and practices determined by these beliefs).³ As a result, Jonathan Frankel notes, the discussion of assimilation has shifted from the extremes, from the dichotomous archetypes, to that middle ground where it is no easy task to distinguish the exceptions from the rules.⁴ This statement is especially viable when applied to the Jewish community of interwar Poland, where full integration could not take place because of factors such as weak economic development, the dense concentrations of traditional Jews who opposed the emancipation process, and the negative attitude of the non-Jewish community. However, at the same time a new generation of Jews who were educated in Polish schools, were fluent in Polish, and were increasingly familiar with the environment outside traditional Jewish quarters were becoming ever more visible in Polish social, political, and cultural life. Some of these Jews retained a Jewish national consciousness; others, who felt connected to a Polish or predominantly Polish national and cultural affiliation, formed a group that remained in the middle, the caste of assimilated Jews.⁵\n\nSome of those who feature in this book were simply born into assimilated families; others were brought up in two cultures. For some assimilation was a personal choice, not influenced by their family background. Others became assimilated through processes of modernization and laicization, which was gradual and often went unnoticed.⁶ What they all had in common, and what will be my main point of reference, is the predominant identification with Polish culture and language, even though some of these individuals also cultivated certain aspects of their Jewish identity. The identity of Polish Jews at this time was in no way static and remained dependent on numerous external and internal factors. The only way to define Jewish Polishness is to see it as a set of expressions of constant changes in various components of self-identity, a journey undertaken by almost all of those who will feature in this book.\n\nThe individuals presented in this book encompass very different life stories and paths toward assimilation. The first group consists of very young people, who in 1939 were still children or teenagers. One such individual was Marcel Reich. Born in 1920 to a lower-middle class family, he was sent by his mother to attend school in Germany after his father went bankrupt in 1929. Forced to relocate to Poland in 1938, Reich made a living giving German lessons until the outbreak of the war. Another, Antoni Marianowicz, born in 1923 and baptized at birth in the Protestant church, was a son of an assimilated wealthy merchant and a graduate of one of the most exclusive Warsaw gymnasiums. Mary Berg, a year younger than Marianowicz, was a native of Łódź, the daughter of a well-known art dealer and an American mother. The family only arrived in Warsaw after the beginning of the war.\n\nThe demographic of individuals in their 20s and 30s will be mainly represented by artists and professional intelligentsia. Poet Władysław Szlengel was born in 1914. A native of Warsaw, he was the son of a painter, and graduated from a Polish secondary school. From a young age he was a fixture of the Warsaw literary scene, regularly publishing in the most prestigious Polish literary magazine and writing texts and popular songs for literary cabarets. Though influenced significantly by Polish poetry, he nonetheless remained a complex figure, located on the Polish-Jewish border, who devoted some of his poetry to topics of Jewish identity. Jerzy Jurandot, three years older, was already a very established name in the immediate pre-war years. He came from an assimilated family and was a graduate of Warsaw University. Jurandot wrote his first hit song at eighteen and in the next ten years he wrote the biggest hits of interwar Warsaw, which were sung by the greats of the Polish stage. From 1935 he was a director of literary cabarets. He too wrote solely in Polish. Władysław Szpilman, who was the same age as Jurandot, also came from a family of assimilated intelligentsia. He was a pianist and graduate of the Warsaw and Berlin conservatorium. Szpilman worked in Polish radio and was the composer of film scores and popular songs.\n\nThe first representative of the older generation to feature in this book, Roman Kramsztyk, was born in 1885 into one of the most illustrious assimilated families of Warsaw. Baptized as a child, he always considered himself to be Polish. From 1909 he lived and gradually gained fame as a painter in Paris and was caught up in the outbreak of the Second World War during a visit to Warsaw. Helena Szereszewska was born in 1891 to a progressive Jewish family. She was a graduate of a university in Geneva and was married to a successful engineer working in the yeast industry. She considered her family to be assimilated, but twice a year, on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement, her daughters did not attend school. Szereszewska did not work and devoted most of her time to reading Polish and French literature. Professor Ludwik Hirszfeld, born in 1884 in Łódź to a thoroughly assimilated family, was one of the most famous Polish scientists. A graduate of German and Swiss universities he returned to Poland to become a professor at Warsaw University. His illustrious career in microbiology and serology was partially possible because of the fact that as an adult he was baptized. He was married and had a daughter who was, however, not baptized. Finally, engineer Adam Czerniaków was a typical representative of late nineteenth-century assimilation. He was born in 1881 into an assimilated Warsaw family and went to university both in Poland and abroad. He spoke Polish as his first language and wrote Polish poetry but remained active in Jewish communal life, serving on the boards of several Polish and Jewish institutions. In 1931 he was elected to the Polish Senate. In 1939 he became the head of the German-created Warsaw Jewish Council—the Judenrat. It is the experience of these individuals and many others like them that form the story of the assimilated, acculturated, and baptized Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nIt is also necessary at this point to underline the fundamental difference in the use of the term assimilation between the Eastern and the Western and Central European contexts. During the nineteenth century in the United States as well as in Western and Central Europe, acculturation and social integration as a result of emancipation, along with the retention of some form of Jewish identity, were prevalent among urban and, later on, small-town Jews. In Eastern Europe conforming to the norms of non-Jewish society was a more highly charged issue. The Assimilationist movement in Poland remained marginal and, as will be shown throughout this study, among the majority of Jewish society in Poland the term assimilation had predominantly negative connotations. Such an attitude toward this cultural and political program was shared by both the members of youth movements, even those coming from polonized homes where Polish was their first language, and the Orthodox, Yiddish-speaking community. This division has to be kept in mind, if we are to discuss the specific situation of this group in pre-war and wartime Poland.\n\nAssimilation of Jews in Poland until World War I\n\nIn the multiethnic state of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Jews formed an autonomous, very traditional community that to a significant degree remained separate from the external social framework. Their only possible mode of assimilation was through conversion, a path highly favored by the Polish state, which saw it as a living proof of the triumph of the Catholic faith, and thus deserving of special benevolence.⁷ As historian Magdalena Teter shows, most neophytes came from lower strata, and the most famous case of Jewish conversion was that of Jacob Frank (1726–1791), leader of a Sabbatean sect known as the Frankists.⁸ After Frank converted to Catholicism, thousands (although not all) of his followers did the same. The most prominent Frankist families were rewarded for this step by the Polish Sejm and ennobled in 1764. They later integrated into Polish society and by the end of the nineteenth century were widely intermarried within the nobility, often gaining prominence in Varsovian society.\n\nAfter the partitions of 1772, 1793, and 1795, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was divided among three absolutist states: Prussia, Russia, and the Habsburg Empire. Following the decisions of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Warsaw became the capital of the Russian-ruled, semi-autonomous Kingdom of Poland. The main force shaping the assimilation of Polish Jewry in this part of Polish lands was the Haskalah—an enlightenment-related Jewish modernization movement that emerged in Germany in the 1770s. The Haskalah began as a current of the intellectual renewal of Judaism, but later became a tool for the political emancipation of the Jews. The first leading Polish maskilim (followers of the Haskalah) were almost all gathered around the Kingdom’s government and public institutions and had given themselves the task of modernizing the Jewish community. As in Germany, the Haskalah was also supported by wealthy merchants, bankers, and industrialists. Warsaw, as the regional center of the movement, played an integral role in its development. Among the three main social groups that emerged from the Polish Haskalah were traditional maskilim who wrote only in Hebrew, a group of radical assimilationists who postulated severing all ties with Judaism, and finally the largest and most important group, who promoted pro-Polish acculturation while preserving the status of Judaism and its religious traditions.⁹ According to its ideology, Jews should become Poles of Mosaic Faith, that is, Poles differing from others only in their religion. Full integration into Polish society was to be achieved through acquiring secular knowledge and full acquisition of the Polish language. This worldview combined rejection of separatism (understood as differences in culture, clothing, and language), loyalty to the Polish state, and reinforcement of a Jewish religious identity. The combination of Polish patriotism, often taking the shape of an enthusiastic devotion to the cause of oppressed Poland, and Jewish religion, was shaped in a significant way by the tradition of Polish Romanticism.¹⁰ The height of this current of assimilation came with the Polish-Jewish Fraternity of 1861–63, peaking with the participation of some young Jews in the January Uprising of 1863.¹¹ The next generation of assimilationists focused on a type of assimilation similar to that in Western and Central Europe, underlining the need for education and conforming to the non-Jewish way of life. Its result was to be the creation of the urbanized Jewish middle class.¹² This model, leading to assimilation as a political program, flourished after the Emancipation Act of 1862.\n\nThe assimilation process in nineteenth-century Warsaw was strengthened by emerging capitalism. The rich industrialist Jewish families—such as the Kronenbergs, Wawelbergs, or Natansons—started playing a very important part in both Polish and Jewish community life, many of them gaining social prominence through financing the Polish fight for independence. Some of their members converted to Christianity, some remained close to Judaism, but basically all became integrated into Polish society, which was in many cases confirmed by intermarriage with Polish noble families. Conversion was also a growing phenomenon at that time among Warsaw’s lower-middle class, many of whom changed religion to elevate their economic status.¹³\n\nAnother result of the introduction of the capitalist economy was the establishment of the urban intelligentsia—the social group that was most open to assimilated Jews and into which, through university education or professional contacts, they most often integrated. The pioneering group of Jewish intelligentsia that emerged from the followers of the Haskalah gathered around the Warsaw Rabbinical School, a secular, secondary-level school, which functioned between 1826 and 1862, inculcating the spirit of Polish patriotism into more than a thousand young men from wealthy Jewish families.¹⁴\n\nAssimilation in Interwar Poland\n\nInterwar Warsaw, with its Jewish population ranging between 320,000 and 370,000, was undoubtedly the European center of Jewish life. Even though the vast majority of its Jewish inhabitants remained traditional, Warsaw was also the most assimilated city in a newly independent Poland. Since the 1919 Versailles Treaty, Polish Jews were guaranteed full civil rights, which included retaining their national identity, language, and religion, and the freedom to set up religious and social organizations. Even though these rights were infringed upon by the Polish government and often by Polish society, there is no doubt that the interwar period witnessed a surge in all aspects of artistic, cultural, and social Jewish undertakings. Warsaw became the dynamic center of new Jewish life, attracting young talented people from the whole of Poland. Historian Israel Gutman, describing the interwar city, wrote:\n\nWarsaw had neither ancient buildings nor the aura of glorious memories, the vestiges of an influential past. There were no ancient synagogues such as the one in Cracow; none that had been the home of world-renowned scholars. There was no tradition of greatness. . . . Nevertheless, there was ample opportunity for newcomers to make their impact and the city had the feel of a community coming into its own. Warsaw’s comparatively new facades and its fast-growing strength were a source of openness. New inhabitants and casual visitors could feel welcome. Social change was more prevalent than stability. . . . In these two decades of naïve expectations and short-lived hopes Warsaw, with its variegated textures and contrasts, became the focus of unlimited and wide-ranging Jewish activity. In those days of confusion on the brink of an abyss, it was virtually the capital of the Jewish people¹⁵\n\nJewish Warsaw, brimming with newcomers—scholars, political activists, aspiring writers, and theater makers—became the site of extensive cultural and political activity. It was the seat of all major Jewish parties, youth movements, and trade unions, the location of theaters and research centers, and home to Jewish journalists and publishing houses. It was clear that assimilation was no longer the only way to escape the ghetto of traditional Jewry. Zionism and socialism was increasingly the ideology of choice among the young Jewish intelligentsia.\n\nAll this did not mean, however, that assimilation as a social process was stopped in its tracks. Its progress could"
