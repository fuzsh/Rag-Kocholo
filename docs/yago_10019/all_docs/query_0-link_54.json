        "text": "the history of the Weimar period, and in particular the history of the Weimar Berlin cabaret era (1918-1933), one is left with two seemingly opposing views on the subject. On one hand, we have the rather dry, academic approach, sans of all fl avor and colorful description, and at best is only a historical outline of the established theatres, revues, cabarets, composers and performers presenting conventional entertainment. This view tends to leave out the sub-cultural infl uences, the gritty underworld climate of the cellars and dark pubs where many of the intelligentsia and artists gathered. In the other view of the period, we have a romanticized longing for the torrid dark cellars of Berlin, fi lled with opium smoke, transvestite chorus girls, hot jazz and barons with suspect incomes and perverse tastes. This ignores the wider cultural scope. I am rather inclined to believe that the climate of Weimar Berlin’s cabarets was somewhere in between -and more. Much, much more. To even beg...\n\nThis article shows what we can learn from Vienna Jewish cabaret, so called Jar-gontheater 'jargon theater' and the language situation of Vienna Jews at the end of the 19th century. By analyzing one of the most popular plays of this genre, we can see how structures from Yiddish dialect fused with Viennese German and what may have caused the 'Vienna Jewish speech,' a Judeo-German city variety in the First Austrian Republic (1920s and 1930s).\n\nThis article investigates the coinciding of the mass migration from Europe to the Americas and the emergence of mass culture, two developments that shaped everyday life, popular entertainment, and Jewish and non-Jewish relations at the turn of the twentieth century. Jewish actors and actresses were among the most prominent performers who staged in Orpheums, Varietés, and vaudevilles on both sides of the Atlantic. In their performances they drew on the notion of a new quality of mobility that society was experiencing, utilizing it to negotiate issues such as of the cultural construction of identities and Jewishness, or to critically reexamine antisemitic and nationalistic attitudes. On the one hand, mobility enabled negotiations of controversial issues. On the other hand, mobility led to accusations against popular entertainment, both legitimate and erroneous—for example, that vaudevilles functioned as covers for clandestine prostitution. Therefore, the article examines the question of how mobility influenced popular culture. What were the controversial issues that mobility raised, and what accusations did these evoke? In what ways did actors and actresses in popular culture address gender and Jewishness? To answer these questions, the article analyzes the spaces of popular entertainment in Budapest, Vienna, and New York through close examinations of newspapers, manuscripts, playbills, and records of censorship."
