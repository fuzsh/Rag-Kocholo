        "text": "Greetings again from the darkness. Most of us will never know the agony and desperation felt by Jews in 1942 Warsaw, the setting of the latest from writer-director Rodrigo Cortes (the underappreciated thriller, BURIED, 2010). Co-written with David Safier, the film benefits from an extraordinary performance by Clara Rugaard as Stefcia, the lead actress in a live performance of Jerzy Jurandot’s “Love Looks for an Apartment” taking place in a rundown theater within the slums of Warsaw.\n\nThe genius of the film is the symmetry between the play and the real-world developments occurring for Stefcia. Fellow actors in the troupe include her current boyfriend Edmund (Ferdio Walsh-Peelo) and her ex-boyfriend Patrik (Mark Ryder), whose latest proposition has caused quite the conundrum for all three – as well as Edmund’s little sister Sara (Dalit Streett Tejeda), who ends up on stage for the climax. Although the play is a musical romantic comedy being performed to bring a glimmer of joy to local residents, there is even more drama occurring backstage, and all of this takes place at a frenetic pace that plays out in mostly real time.\n\nFear is ever-present in the form of a rifle-wielding Nazi soldier (Magnus Krepper) who interrupts the show and plops down on the front row. He’s the type of arrogant soldier who finds joy in flaunting his power and watching others cower in his presence. Of course, the audience is oblivious to the fact that the emotions played out on stage – love, fear, confusion, and passion – are also playing out in the real lives of those same actors. Life here is bleak, yet the play brings a form of hope that goodness and joy still exist.\n\nFueled by adrenaline, putting nerves on edge, the film is enhanced by Victor Reyes’ score and the tremendous camera work by cinematographer Rafa Garcia. The camera is almost always in motion, mirroring the key players and the drama and decisions unfolding. Additionally worth noting is a frantic scene over the opening credits that revs us up so we can keep pace with the coming story. This is excellent filmmaking by Rodrigo Cortes, and the message emphasizing the human spirit to always carry on is on full display. On a personal note, one of my favorite takeaways here is the dedication the actors show in delivering a show that offers a window of joy to those in dire need of it.\n\nThe film will be released June 23 in limited theaters and available on Digital + VOD June 30th"
