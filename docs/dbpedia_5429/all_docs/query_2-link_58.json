        "text": "Let's face it: He may have ushered the Beatles into the American consciousness, but Ed Sullivan was kind of a bore. If it weren't for the aforementioned Liverpudlians, the Rolling Stones, the Doors and countless other popular entertainers holding the audience's attention, The Ed Sullivan Show probably wouldn't have lasted two episodes, let alone two decades.
