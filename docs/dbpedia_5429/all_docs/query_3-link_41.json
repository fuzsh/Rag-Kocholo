Unfortunately it appears to be the edited version that aired on US TV, not the full four-hour BBC miniseries.  But I thought it worth having a topic about because it was done in 1992 around the time he SHOULD have been doing a third Bond film.

Or was it deliberately meant to be ambiguous?)\n\nBut also I thought there was a definite subtext of, ahem, \"male bonding\" throughout this movie (ie, we were not supposed to be really sure of what Eddie's motivations and proclivities really were)\n\nI loved Timothy's performance in FRAMED, an excellent psychological thriller. I believe Lynda LaPlante was an old mate of Tim's and crafted this part especially for him.\n\nA designer-wearing, health food obsessed, gym-going metrosexual 1990's new man was as far from Tim's real life persona as one could get - I'm sure there's a bit of in-jokery there!\n\n\"He's playing and playing him. Eddie is deeply manipulative. There's a down-grading of the policeman's wife,\" with one comment th'at is particularly on-target.\n\nDalton is asked if Larry is latently homosexual - if Eddie is bisexual. \"I certainly wondered about that. As an actor, you ask yourself these things and then answer as best you can.\n\n\"Eddie is exploring physicality with Larry as a way of making friendship. It's male bonding, if you like, but I don't think they develop a ....\" Pause. \"... frisson of it.\""
