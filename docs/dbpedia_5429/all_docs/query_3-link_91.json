        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n14 Oct 2022, 15:07\n\nCredit: Rex and IMDB\n\nFormer Bond star Timothy Dalton is stepping into a dark, villainous role in the upcoming Yellowstone prequel series, 1923, alongside Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren.\n\nVariety reports that The Rocketeer actor and former 007 will star as 'a powerful, self-confident man who reeks of wealth and the lack of empathy it requires to attain it' taking on the role of Donald Whitfield in its fifth season next month.\n\nIn a statement, Paramount+ said that that the drama 'will introduce a new generation of the Dutton family and explore the early twentieth century when pandemics, historic drought, the end of Prohibition, and the Great Depression all plague the mountain west, and the Duttons who call it home'.\n\nThe new Paramount+ show is also due to star Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, and focuses on the early 20th century period.\n\nGame of Thrones star Jerome Flynn is joining the cast as Banner Creighton, 'a no-nonsense Scot who leads the local sheepmen'.\n\nThe new prequel isn't the first Yellowstone spin-off, with 1883 starring Sam Elliott, Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, LaMonica Garrett and Isabel May premiering at the end of last year."
