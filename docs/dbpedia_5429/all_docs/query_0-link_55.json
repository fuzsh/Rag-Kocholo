        "text": "Since he first stepped into the nattily attired role of 00-level secret agent James Bond back in 2006, actor Daniel Craig has been heralded by many as the best performer to inhabit Ian Fleming’s iconic character since Sean Connery. I come here not to condemn Craig; he’s positively wonderful in every respect and I look forward to what might be his final go ’round in the role —Spectre, opening in North America this weekend — with great anticipation. He has brought to the role a quiet, brooding, intriguingly damaged third dimension.\n\nPeople often say that Fleming saw Connery as the only Bond, and in a pulpy, fictional sense that might be true. Then again, Fleming didn’t live to see any Bonds other than Connery. Craig doesn’t play Bond as the outlet for male fantasies Fleming often created; he plays who James Bond would have actually been if he lived his life as a secret agent: a brilliant, blunt, battered mess of a man.\n\nI enjoy Craig mainly because he has taken many cues, not from Fleming’s material — something Craig has openly taken to task as being admittedly misogynist and problematic — but from the Bond that changed 007’s image forever.\n\nIf someone asks me: who’s the best actor to play Bond? I emphatically and unapologetically respond that no one before or since has been able to touch Timothy Dalton. In only two films, the somewhat controversial choice did more to strengthen the character, adding layers of necessary psychological and physical depth after almost a decade of abject neglect in Connery’s absence, than anyone since. His tenure was unfortunately short and maligned for reasons that weren’t necessarily the fault of the actor. He wasn’t the Bond the times deserved, but the one they needed. If Dalton were currently younger and tagged as Craig’s future replacement, no one would bat an eye.\n\nActually, we almost got a chance to see Dalton as Bond earlier than many casual fans of the franchise realize. The classically trained stage and screen actor was approached at the age of 25, back in 1968, by series producer/svengali Albert “Cubby” Broccoli to take up the mantle. Feeling in his heart that Bond works better as a middle-aged man, and that he was too young for the role, Dalton declined. He was asked again in the early ’80s to replace an aging Roger Moore, but passed for a more obvious reason: Moore’s films were growing increasingly comedic, ridiculous and poor.\n\nThe deeply lamentable second half of Moore’s run as 007 wasn’t that actor’s fault, either. Starting with the batshit, ill-advised trip to space in 1979’sMoonraker, through to his duel with a crazed Christopher Walken on an airship in Moore’s 1985 swan song,A View to a Kill, the actor had to put up with a cultural climate that viewed spies as kitschy curios. The world had been simmering in the Cold War for so long that things had ceased being terrifying and were becoming cartoonish. Bond films had as many regrettable punch lines asDanger Mouse orLancelot Link: Secret Chimp. Yes, Moore was old as hell and way past his prime to showcase Bond’s physicality, but I defy any actor to make the material he was getting work at all, let alone convey it with a straight face.\n\nAfter Moore decided he wasn’t coming back for an eighth reprisal of Bond, audiences still almost didn’t have the chance to see Dalton take the role. Initially, New Zealand actor and future dinosaur expert Sam Neill screen-tested for the role and was inches away from getting the part. That was nixed when everyone loved Neill, save for the one person whose opinion mattered most — “Cubby” Broccoli couldn’t stand him.\n\nThe part was all but handed to their next top choice on a silver platter: Pierce Brosnan. Although he was given the top spot in the franchise in the ’90s, he nearly assumed the mantle a decade earlier. He was so close to getting the role that press releases had been sent out with Brosnan’s name attached. It was a big deal.\n\nIt was so big that Brosnan’s current bosses took pointed notes. At the time, Brosnan was the star of the semi-popular TV serialRemington Steele, for CBS. The show was doing okay, but once word leaked that Brosnan was about to become Bond, the ratings went up considerably. Thanks to the terms of Brosnan’s contract, CBS execs and producers had a certain amount of time to come up with more scripts and work for the actor to keep him around and under lock and key. CBS came up with more adventures for private eye Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist, the actual star of the show) and her former thief partner, and Brosnan was forced back to the bench on a technicality most foul.\n\nWithThe Living Daylights already written and ready to go before the cameras as soon as possible, everyone started talking about Dalton again. But there was a problem on that front, too. Once again, Dalton was approached — prior to Brosnan — to play the part, but also had contractual obligations that needed fulfilling. Dalton said he couldn’t play Bond unless shooting was delayed six weeks, as he was in the States working on an adaptation of the comic stripBrenda Starr, a film so forgettable and mired in legal troubles that it wouldn’t get released for a whopping six years after it was completed. Thankfully, the kerfuffle with Brosnan delayed everything so much that Dalton was suddenly available again.\n\nThe production wasn’t about to wait for Dalton though.The Living Daylights started shooting second unit footage before the ink was dry on Dalton’s contract. Dalton received confirmation of his new job a mere six days before he had to undertake the task of playing one of the most iconic characters in cinematic history. There was no time to prepare; he literally finished shootingBrenda Starr, got on a plane and the next day was playing Bond.\n\nDalton was an unfortunate casualty of the most tumultuous point in the franchise creatively; his tenure was doomed before he even had a chance, in hindsight. However, for the first time since Connery, the series finally had a performer willing to go the extra mile with the character, and the results were unlike anything seen before.\n\nDalton was always keen on taking Bond back to his more primal roots, but with a greater degree of intelligence and less smart-ass quips.The Living Daylights was to be the end of the corny Bond and a welcome return to form. It was no easy task, especially given how ultimately convoluted the film’s story turned out. It holds up and remains one of the best Bond films, but it could certainly use a bit of trimming in the narrative department. It definitely required a performer as strong as Dalton to hold it together.\n\nHow could anyone claim so sacrilegiously that Dalton was better than Connery? To start, personal preference and a sense of realism place his Bond above all others. It begins with the attitude, and I vastly prefer Dalton’s to Connery’s. While Connery was a smooth operator, he was also a catty, misogynist smart-ass — a virtually irredeemable human being and a relic of ’60s lad mags. Dalton’s Bond was smooth, sure, but he was a soldier for his country first and foremost. Connery made Bond look effortless, mostly because I severely doubt his Bond really cared about his job half the time. Connery’s Bond says, ‘Oh, look, I just saved the world. Cool, but how did I look doing it?’ Dalton’s Bond openly says, ‘I’m going to save the world!’\n\nIt’s in something as simple as how the actors held a cigarette; it sounds inconsequential, but it’s a key tell. Connery lets his cancer sticks hang from his mouth like he doesn’t care if they drop to the ground. He’ll just light another; he’ll also look continually at your boobs or the floor while talking to you. Dalton’s Bond holds the cigarette firmly between his fingers, pointing straight at whomever he’s conversing with while looking directly into their eyes to size them up or intimidate him. Connery always looked like someone you could slap in the face. Sure, you’d likely get your butt kicked, but you could slap the hell out of him. One look at Dalton and he immediately gives off the vibe of someone not to be trifled with. Moore didn’t have that quality at all. Brosnan tried, but never seemed convincing in that respect. One-off performer George Lazenby was a Connery-aping goof who seemed too dumb to be a secret agent. Craig possesses a similar gravitas and it works to his immense advantage.\n\nBeyond the way the new Bond carried himself, and the not at all unnoticeable fact that this incarnation treated women better than any others before or since, Dalton’s Bond perfectly blended the physical and analytical. Again, with the exception of Craig’s films, Dalton’s version of the character was one who questioned his missions and their ultimate motives. He frequently bucked authority, flat out ignored the rules and always did what was right. Other Bonds were heroes on paper, but Dalton’s was the only one with the morality to actually come across as heroic. He listened to the concerns of characters, both good and evil, weighed them and considered his options. He was still a ruthless machine, but one with incredible processing power.\n\nDalton also predated Craig’s raw physicality. Often opting to perform his own stunts whenever insurance (or the notoriously gun-shy Broccoli) would allow, the actor’s approach was very obviously hands on, or at least more so than most actors in that era. After decades of relaxed efforts, Dalton rightfully made being a secret agent look like a tough job. Echoes of the stunts inThe Living Daylights — some of the best in the franchise — can be seen and felt in some of the recentFast and Furious andMission: Impossible films. Bits of Dalton’s performance echo throughout those franchises as well — watch them all side by side and the comparisons are stunning.\n\nHowever, while there are only minor quibbles that can be made objectively with regards toThe Living Daylights, there’s much to be said against Dalton’s sophomore effort,License to Kill, none of which is his fault. I wish I could claim thatLicense to Kill is a good film, but it’s pretty bad, on the whole. Recently I tried watching it again, in hopes that I missed something. I liked the first 40 minutes or so and then I was reminded why it was so bad in the first place.\n\nFirst off,License to Kill was the first film in the franchise to have absolutely no connection to Fleming’s work whatsoever.The Living Daylights was technically inspired by a short story featuring the character, and even then most of that story was covered in the opening sequence of the film.License to Kill was designed as something to showcase Bond dealing with more modern problems in the waning days of the Cold War. In this case, international drug dealing. It was a noble concept, and there are some great ideas buried in it, but the laundry list of production and story problems suggest a film that was never going to work no matter how hard everyone tried.\n\nThe film was originally supposed to take place in China, but the Chinese government backed out (remnants of this can clearly be seen in the final script that made it to the screen). The budget was slashed so significantly that it was the first Bond film to have none of it shot in England, instead filming in Mexico and Key West, Florida, often in the middle of scorching summer heat. A writer’s strike meant that long-time scribe Richard Maibaum was unable to finish the script before the film began production. There were earthquakes; people were getting hurt; and there were rumours that — I kid you not — the production was plagued by the ghosts of three nuns that had died close to where a key action sequence was being filmed. “Cubby” Broccoli took ill and couldn’t take his usual hands-on approach. Someone thought hiring Wayne Newton as one of the villains was a good idea. Basically, everything that could have gone wrong did. (Note: Wayne Newton is offset by one of Benicio del Toro’s earliest performances, as an evil henchman, and he’s outstanding.)\n\nThe biggest problem withLicense to Kill is its overarching goofiness; it’s a supposedly serious film made by people that can’t stop giggling long enough to actually be taken seriously. It’s a Moore-era relic in every way, which is shocking since it’s the exact same team that madeThe Living Daylights. Where one was a step forward, the other was a massive step backwards. You know, kind of likeQuantum of Solace coming on the heels ofCasino Royale.\n\nThere’s aScarface-styled drug dealer (played nicely enough by character actor Robert Davi), with a pet iguana on his shoulder. Bond uncharacteristically gets into a ridiculously American bar fight in Florida swamp country and not only does he have to balance a pair of women, but seems clueless what to do with either of them, professionally or sexually. Did I mention Wayne Newton? It’s the most Americanized Bond, in all the worst possible ways.\n\nBut amidst all that goofiness there’s still a brilliant Dalton performance, and the second half of the film introduces the best portrait of Bond as a psychological tactician ever seen. The plot ofLicense to Kill (initially titledLicense Revoked, but changed because someone quite seriously thought Americans wouldn’t know what “revoked” meant) involves James being wrong about something, getting his duties stripped and going rogue to get the job done. It’s not a bad idea and was the first time the franchise adopted this theme.\n\nIn the film’s second half, Bond goes reluctantly deep cover, gaining the trust of his nemesis and getting inside the villain’s head. What Bond demonstrates in this film, exemplified perfectly by Dalton’s talent for subtlety, is the ability for the character to be a masterful manipulator. Bond doesn’t have to do much until the end of the film — a stunning, but ludicrous tanker chase through the desert — because he has successfully gotten the bad guy so paranoid that he kills most of his henchmen. The villain kills more bad guys than Bond.\n\nHowever, if one looks at worldwide grosses and factors in cost analysis,License to Kill is actually the fourth most successful film in the Bond franchise. The biggest problem was that it absolutely tanked in the U.S. Upon its release in the summer of 1989 — a season that all but killed a number of franchises (Nightmare on Elm Street,Friday the 13th,Ghostbusters,Star Trek), while cementing new ones (Batman,Lethal Weapon). It was the first Bond film to not debut at number one at the American box office; actually, it debuted abysmally in fourth place as almost a complete afterthought. The fact thatLicense to Kill was made almost exclusively to please American audiences definitely played into the film’s ultimate failure.\n\nThat wasn’t the main reason why Dalton never returned, however. The actor was contractually obliged to appear in three Bond films, but for various reasons his final installment never materialized. Legal troubles between MGM and the franchise producers delayed production on the third of his films for several years. Then, about a year before the release ofGoldenEye, Dalton simply exercised his right to back out of the deal, opening the door for Brosnan and leaving his involvement in the franchise to that of a curious, sadly unremarked upon footnote.\n\nDalton never said why didn’t return forGoldenEye, but it’s likely because he read the script and realized it would be an even bigger step back for the character thanLicense to Kill. People seem to really like Brosnan’s first outing, but I’m convinced they’re getting their feelings for the film confused with their love for the pretty awesome videogame it spawned.\n\nAs a film,GoldenEye is a complete and utter mess, with some okay action scenes. It was cool when I was 14 and first saw it, but four years later, I thought it was an embarrassment. Now, I find it completely unwatchable. We’re back to the smarmy, quipping, womanizing Bond, with a dose of loathsomely dated, early ’90s self-reflexivity and a mentality only X-Games athletes could understand. Brosnan is a capable actor, but as his Bond was written, he always seems a single Mountain Dew away from telling us all how extreme he is. Every Brosnan Bond film, save for the really great diamond in the rough,Tomorrow Never Dies, is abjectly terrible in every respect. People might like Brosnan as an actor, but his films and tenure as Bond are completely indefensible. He was actually the worst Bond. Nineties nostalgia only takes his films so far.\n\nDalton came along at a rough time, slotted squarely between two unremarkable Bonds with longer tenures than most who portrayed the character. He gets sadly lumped in with inferior products and it’s unfair. Fans of Bond’s current arc and Craig’s uniquely humane performance owe Dalton a huge debt of gratitude. It’s time we started showing it."
