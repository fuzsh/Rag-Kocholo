The show was originally pitched to several US and UK channels, and eventually landed with Showtime,[1] with Sky Atlantic as co-producer.[2] It premiered at the South by Southwest film festival on March 9 and began airing on television on April 28, 2014, on Showtime on Demand.[3][4] The series premiered on Showtime in the United States on May 11, 2014, and on Sky Atlantic in the United Kingdom on May 20, 2014.[5][6][7] After the third-season finale on June 19, 2016, series creator John Logan announced that Penny Dreadful had ended as the main story had reached its conclusion.[8][9]\n\nThe title refers to the penny dreadfuls, a type of 19th-century British fiction publication with lurid and sensational subject matter. The series draws upon many public domain characters from 19th-century Victorian Gothic fiction, including Dorian Gray from Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray; Mina Harker, Abraham Van Helsing, John Seward, Renfield, and Count Dracula from Bram Stoker's Dracula; Victor Frankenstein and his monster from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; and Henry Jekyll from Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, showing their origin stories as an explorer searches for his daughter. Justine from Justine, or The Misfortunes of Virtue by the Marquis de Sade also appears.\n\nA spin-off series, Penny Dreadful: City of Angels, aired from April 26 to June 28, 2020.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first season begins in London, 1891. Ethan Chandler, an American gunman and roadshow artist, is hired by the adventurer Malcolm Murray and the mysterious Vanessa Ives to help rescue Murray's daughter from a mysterious creature. They receive help from a young doctor named Victor Frankenstein. However, Frankenstein is soon stalked by an undead creature that he once reanimated and abandoned. Ives becomes romantically involved with the handsome, artistic Dorian Gray but also finds herself haunted by Lucifer, who wishes to make her his bride and queen.\n\nIn the second season, Ives is hunted by a coven of witches led by the charismatic Evelyn Poole, who wants to deliver Ives to Lucifer. Frankenstein is forced to make his creature a bride, and an inspector investigates grisly murder that Chandler committed in a London inn.\n\nIn the third season, the main characters find themselves scattered across the world – Ives is in London, consulting the alienist Florence Seward, Ethan is being extradited to the United States, and Murray is in Zanzibar. Count Dracula soon appears in London, setting the stage for the final battle for Ives' soul.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nMain cast\n\n[edit]\n\nReeve Carney as Dorian Gray, a charismatic man who is ageless and immortal.[10]\n\nTimothy Dalton as Malcolm Murray, a hardened explorer of the African continent, on a deeply personal quest to save the remaining members of his family.[11]\n\nEva Green as Vanessa Ives, an enigmatic, quietly driven heroine who proves herself a force to be reckoned with as she battles powerful, relentless forces from the underworld.[12]\n\nRory Kinnear as the Creature, a creation Frankenstein abruptly abandoned, who, not given a name, variously uses the aliases Caliban and John Clare.[13]\n\nBillie Piper as Brona Croft / Lily Frankenstein, an Irish immigrant seeking to escape her brutal, violent past.[14]\n\nDanny Sapani as Sembene, a mysterious, long-time ally of Malcolm (seasons 1–2).[15]\n\nHarry Treadaway as Victor Frankenstein, an arrogant, socially inept young doctor whose ambition and research involve transcending the barrier between life and death.[16]\n\nJosh Hartnett as Ethan Chandler (born Ethan Lawrence Talbot), a charming, brash and daring American man of action with uncanny marksmanship, who detests violence, and is more complicated than he likes to admit.[12]\n\nHelen McCrory as Evelyn Poole (aka Evelyn Paul), a professional spiritualist known by the alias Madame Kali who is secretly the leader of a powerful coven of witches called \"Nightcomers\" (season 2, recurring season 1).[15]\n\nSimon Russell Beale as Ferdinand Lyle, an eccentric Egyptologist (season 2, recurring seasons 1 and 3).[15]\n\nPatti LuPone as Florence Seward, an alienist or early psychotherapist treating Vanessa's depression (season 3; LuPone previously guest-starred as Joan Clayton in season 2)[17][18]\n\nWes Studi as Kaetenay, an Apache with a connection to Ethan, who becomes an ally to Malcolm (season 3).[17]\n\nSupporting cast\n\n[edit]\n\nIntroduced in season 1\n\n[edit]\n\nOlivia Llewellyn as Mina Harker, Malcolm's daughter and Vanessa's childhood friend who has been abducted (seasons 1–2).\n\nAlex Price as Proteus, a new creation of Dr. Frankenstein's, named after the literary character of the same name, who was killed by the Creature (seasons 1–2).\n\nLorcan Cranitch as Inspector Goldsworthy, of the London police (season 1).\n\nRobert Nairne as the Vampire, an evil creature who leads a cabal of undead and who abducted Mina Harker (season 1).\n\nOlly Alexander as Fenton, a vampire minion (season 1).\n\nGraham Butler as Peter Murray, Malcolm's son, who died accompanying his father on one of his expeditions (seasons 1–2).\n\nNoni Stapleton as Gladys Murray, Malcolm's estranged wife and mother of Mina and Peter (seasons 1–2).\n\nAlun Armstrong as Vincent Brand, the leader of a troupe of actors in residence at the Grand Guignol (season 1).[13]\n\nHannah Tointon as Maud Gunneson, an actress at the Grand Guignol, and object of the Creature's affection (season 1).\n\nGavin Fowler as Simon, Maud's partner who mistreats the Creature (season 1).\n\nDavid Warner as Abraham Van Helsing, a haematologist and colleague of Frankenstein (season 1).\n\nStephen Lord as Warren Roper, a Pinkerton agent hired to bring Ethan back to the United States (seasons 1–2).\n\nIntroduced in season 2\n\n[edit]\n\nSarah Greene as Hecate Poole, Evelyn's eldest daughter (seasons 2–3).\n\nNicole O'Neill, Olivia Chenery and Charlotte Beckett as minor witches of Evelyn's coven.

Logan and Mendes previously wrote and directed Skyfall, respectively. Production began in London in the second half of 2013. Showtime president David Nevins stated that the tone of the ensemble series will be \"very realistic and very grounded, not Bela Lugosi. All exist in human form in turn-of-century London.\" This was also reflected during production of the sound for the show, where Logan often pulled things back towards more realism.[20] Logan, a lifelong fan of literary monsters, wrote the project on spec and scripts the majority of episodes of the series. It was intended that Mendes would direct episodes, but scheduling prevented this.[21]\n\nJuan Antonio Bayona was announced as director for the first two episodes.[22] The remaining episodes of the first season were directed by Dearbhla Walsh, Coky Giedroyc, and James Hawes.\n\nIn March 2013, it was announced that the series would be filmed in the United Kingdom; eyeing the new UK tax credit for high-end TV productions that offers a 25% rebate.[23] However, it was reported in August that production would instead take place in Bray's Ardmore Studios and other locations around Dublin, Ireland, because of the country's section 481 tax incentives. Filming began on October 7 and lasted 5 months.[24] Reports indicate that the change was made as no stage space of a sufficient caliber was available due to the filming of major motion pictures in London.[25]\n\nIn December 2013, Showtime announced its first production blog for a series with the launch of The Penny Dreadful Production Blog. The venue gives viewers an online, behind-the-scenes look at the series' production from its early stages of filming in Ireland through the end of the first season, featuring interviews with cast and crew.[26] In February 2014, Showtime released a full-length trailer for the series.[27]\n\nLogan revealed at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con panel that one of the texts he thought about while planning the series that he would like to use in a future season is The Island of Doctor Moreau.[28] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly prior to the premiere of the third season, Logan stated that the addition of Dr. Henry Jekyll was implemented because the rights to Doctor Moreau were not available.[18]\n\nShowtime announced shortly before the end of the first and second seasons that another season (of 10 and 9 episodes, respectively) would debut the following May.[29][30][31][32] However, Logan had decided during the middle of the second season that the third season should be the last, and he pitched the third season to Showtime president David Nevins accordingly. They did not release this information until after the final season had completed, as Nevins stated, \"given what I knew the ending of Penny Dreadful was going to be felt like a massive spoiler and it felt disrespectful to the experience that people were having with the show.\" Logan said regarding not releasing the information: \"That's what the ending of this series is, it is meant to be a strong, bold, theatrical ending because I think that's what our fans like and to water that down with an announcement or having them know I think would be an act of bad faith.\"[8]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response of Penny DreadfulSeasonRotten TomatoesMetacritic181% (62 reviews)70 (37 reviews)2100% (21 reviews)77 (14 reviews)393% (15 reviews)83 (9 reviews)\n\nThe first season of Penny Dreadful received positive reviews from critics, with a Metacritic rating of 70 out of 100 based on 37 reviews.[33] It holds an 81 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.4 out of 10, based on 62 reviews, with the site's consensuses stating, \"Skillfully shot and superbly acted, Penny Dreadful is perplexing in a good way – even if it's a bit silly at times.\"[34] The first season was described \"as riotous as it is ridiculous, taking the macabre to new heights (or depths)\" by The Guardian reviewer Ben Hewitt.[35]\n\nThe second season also received positive reviews from critics.
