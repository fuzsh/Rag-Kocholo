        "text": "(born 1953). Irish American actor Pierce Brosnan was perhaps best known for playing James Bond in a series of films. His later work was eclectic, ranging from romantic comedies to musicals to dramas.\n\nPierce Brendan Brosnan was born on May 16, 1953, in Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland. His father left home shortly after his birth, and he was raised by relatives after his mother left to work in England. At age 15 Brosnan set out on his own in London, England, to be an actor. He joined a theater group and later studied at the Drama Centre London. He married actress Cassandra Harris, and the two subsequently moved to the United States; he became a U.S. citizen in 2004.\n\nBrosnan was soon cast as a charming con man in the NBC television detective series Remington Steele. The show, which premiered in 1982, was a success. In 1986 Brosnan was chosen as the successor to Roger Moore as James Bond—the suave British secret service agent 007 created by novelist Ian Fleming. His NBC contract, however, prevented him from accepting, and Timothy Dalton took the role instead. Remington Steele ended in 1987, and Brosnan continued to take on television and film roles. In 1991 he dealt with the loss of his wife, who died after a four-year battle with ovarian cancer.\n\nMeanwhile, Dalton’s two Bond films were seen as relative failures, and in 1994 Brosnan was finally able to accept the role. His first film in the series, GoldenEye (1995), made more than $350 million worldwide, the most ever for a Bond film at that time. The second, Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), scored record grosses for a Bond film in the United States. Brosnan brought out the human side of the Bond character, and the series producers sought to emphasize that in The World Is Not Enough (1999). Brosnan made his final appearance as James Bond in Die Another Day (2002).\n\nWhile making the Bond films, Brosnan took advantage of his popularity to choose new projects. In 1999 he produced and starred in a remake of the 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair. He later appeared in the espionage-thriller The Tailor of Panama (2001), a film adaptation of John le Carré’s novel; the romantic comedy Laws of Attraction (2004); and The Matador (2005), in which he played a weary hit man. In 2007 Brosnan starred opposite Liam Neeson in the American Civil War film Seraphim Falls. The following year he appeared with Meryl Streep and Colin Firth in Mamma Mia!, a musical featuring songs by the Swedish pop group ABBA."
