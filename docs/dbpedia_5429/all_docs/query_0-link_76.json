        "text": "Why do this? Why watch every Bond film (most more than once) and choose our favourite villain? Our favourite actors, our favourite ties, our favourite terry cloth robe? What's there to be gained from calling a meeting or several to hash out the best of the best? Wouldn't it just start fights amongst us and then fights among the readers? (Yes, knockdown, drag-out ones, and we shall see.)\n\nWhy? Because we're obsessives. We don't need a why. We just so happen to like conch chowder. But in celebration of 007's 70th anniversary, we're honoring the best of Bond. Pull up a martini and join us, won't you?\n\nCoolest Car\n\nWe'll start with the category that arguably makes Bond Bond. But it's also a tough one. The Lotus Esprit from The Spy Who Loved Me? What about that sick Toyota Land Cruiser from No Time to Die? After spirited debate we had to hand it to Timothy Dalton's Aston Martin V8 Vantage Volante in The Living Daylights. It was Bond's first real muscle car, in 1987, and for that it will always reign supreme in our hearts.\n\nMost Ridiculous Gadget\n\nAnd who would Bond be without his gadgets? Not on this couch, at any rate. We give it to the attack couch from Living Daylights. Rare is the 007 item we don't want to cop, but this one we could live without.\n\nBest Boat\n\nThe Spirit 54 sailing yacht sailed into Venice by Daniel Craig in Casino Royale. Bon voyage, friend.\n\nLamest Car\n\nNo competition. The Ford Edge (no offense???) from Quantum of Solace.\n\nWorst Pickup Line\n\nWhile we're on the subject of lameness, the winner here is, regarding a bowl of chowder eaten by the swimming pool in Thunderball: In answer to the reasonable comment that \"Mr. Bond, that's not much of an aphrodisiac,\" Bond replies: \"I just so happen to like conch chowder.\"\n\nMost Fun Bond to Spend the Weekend With\n\nRoger Moore. We will not be explaining this choice further.\n\nBest Bond to Go on a Bender With\n\nDaniel Craig's Bond has the two ingredients that perhaps make for the best bender: a sense of a humor and streak of darkness.\n\nBest Facial Scruff\n\nAlthough perhaps best enjoyed after a bender with Daniel Craig, we're forced to give it Pierce Brosnan convalescing in the hospital in Die Another Day.\n\nBest Tuxedo\n\nIn the opening sequence of Dr. No, Sean Connery shows up in his first ever frame as Bond wearing a midnight blue dinner suit (as the Brits call it). No one ever looked back.\n\nBest Watch\n\nAnother win for Dr. No: Bond's Rolex Submariner.\n\nBest Suit\n\nConnery’s silver gray two piece in You Only Live Twice.\n\nBest Tie\n\nIn most Connery movies, Bond can be seen wearing a navy wool knit tie. We could not possibly choose just one.\n\nBest Casual Outfit\n\nWe promised a terry cloth onesie, didn't we? Congrats to Sean Connery in the terry cloth onesie in Goldfinger.\n\nBest Swimsuit\n\nLet's give it up for Daniel Craig's in Casino Royale. as he comes out of the water in Nassau.\n\nBest Accessory\n\nIn From Russia With Love, 007 can be seen carrying a black Swaine Adeney Brigg red-lined briefcase with hidden ammo snipers rifle, dagger and strip of gold sovereigns. No, you cannot shop the look.\n\nBest Shoes\n\nDaniel Craig’s Camberly style double monk boots worn in Spectre.\n\nBest Hawaiian Shirt\n\nThis is a category that had a surprising number of contenders, but we were forced to hand it not to Bond, but to Q in Dr. No.\n\nBest Pair of Pajamas\n\nIf one must find a dead Shirley Eaton painted gold in one's bed, one could do worse than in Bond's nailhead cotton piped robe worn in Goldfinger.\n\nBest Chase Scene\n\nYou thought we'd choose one involving a car, didn't you? No, the award goes to the bobsled sequence from On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\n\nMost Improbable Stunt\n\nImprobability is not a knock against the winner in this category. It's not even just a part of the fun. This category underlines how much the point of Bond is the cheesiness, the unlikeliness, and the artlessness that makes it art. When the man skydives into an empty plane in Goldeneye, you're not watching for tips. You are not trying to be this man. The point and pleasure is that you can't be.\n\nBest Scene Involving Skis\n\nThe opening of The Spy Who Loved Me. Another category that had more contenders than you'd think.\n\nBest Underwater Scene\n\nCongratulations to the final battle scene with scuba divers wrestling in Thunderball.\n\nBest Explosion\n\nOk, just...just watch it.\n\nBest Use of a Laser\n\nWhen Goldfinger goes for Bond's junk with a laser.\n\nBest Opening Sequence\n\nWe're giving it up for Goldeneye. Like so much of what that film achieved, it cemented the canon.\n\nBest Bond Song\n\nThis is a category worthy of some debate and indeed we had it. Fists were pounded, tears were shed, paeans were sung to Adele. But \"Live and Let Die\" by Paul McCartney and Wings took the cake.\n\nBest Subplot\n\nWhat would a movie be without its subplots? At the end of Moonraker, Jaws and his girlfriend end up in space. We love to see love win, even if it's the villain. Which brings us to...\n\nBest Torture Scene\n\nPoor 007. Tortured at the hands of Mads Mikkelson in Casino Royale. This one was a no-brainer for its involvement of Bond's balls.\n\nWould-Be Assassination Plot With the Worst Follow-Through\n\nWe admit that Bond is a worthy opponent in the escape category but sometimes the villains make his job too easy. Such as here, in Dr. No, when a tarantula is set up in bed to poison our hero, then, we guess, walks away assuming it will all go according to plan.\n\nBest Bond Girl\n\nWe call them Bond women now, and the winner is Halle Berry as Jinx in Die Another Day.\n\nBest Name for a Bond Girl\n\nPussy Galore.\n\nWorst Name for a Bond Girl\n\nPussy Galore.\n\nBest Name for a Character\n\nPlenty O'Toole. This was also considered for an alternate category: Worst\n\nBest Q\n\nAh, our beloved Desmond Lewelyn. Who else?\n\nBest Henchman\n\nA brief ode to Oddjob: “Oh, you must excuse Oddjob, Mr. Bond,” says the titular supervillain in 1964’s Goldfinger, introducing 007 to his menacing caddy before a round of golf. “He’s an admirable manservant, but mute.” Indeed, Oddjob is the strong, silent type—a powerfully built Korean whose verbal communication is limited to the occasional grunt. He may not have had a way with words, but the burly, besuited lackey set the standard for all Bond henchmen to follow with his loyalty, versatility, and intimidating physical presence. Oddjob lives up to his name by serving his boss, the bullion-obsessed Auric Goldfinger, as everything from chauffeur to bodyguard to assassin. Yes, he’s scary. But as played by bodybuilder and wrestler-turned-actor Harold Sakata, Oddjob also has a bit of flair. There’s the sadistic smile he flashes as he crushes a golf ball in his bare hand, for example, or when he effortlessly tosses Bond across the floor of Fort Knox. Even his signature weapon—a razor-rimmed bowler hat that he throws like a frisbee to decapitate his victims—marries terrifying with a touch of class. In the end, however, that same hat plays a role in his shocking death. - Brian O'Keefe\n\nBest Henchwoman\n\nThe award goes to Grace Jones as May Day from A View to Kill.\n\nBest Side Character\n\nAlan Cumming as Boris, the sheriff from Live and Let Die.\n\nBest Villain\n\nIt's Red Grant from From Russia With Love."
