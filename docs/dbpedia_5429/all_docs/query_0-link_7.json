        "text": "A natural at portraying complex villains, anti-heroes, and charming heavies, Ian McShane is the classically trained, award-winning actor who has grabbed attention and acclaim from audiences and critics around the world with his unforgettable gallery of scoundrels, kings, mobsters and thugs.\n\nAnd, now, a god as well!\n\nMcShane just completed his third season (as star and executive producer) on the hit Starz series, \"American Gods,\" the TV adaptation of Neil Gaiman's 2001 novel. As Mr. Wednesday, a shifty, silver-tongued conman, he masks his true identity - that of the Norse god of war, Odin, who's assembling a team of elders to bring down the new false idols. A series McShane calls \"like nothing else I've seen on television.\"\n\nIt's a comment that also befits McShane's critically-acclaimed role of the charismatic, menacing and lawless 19th century brothel-and-bar keep, Al Swearengen, in the profound and profane HBO western series \"Deadwood,\" which ran for just 36 episodes over three seasons from 2004-06. For his work on the series' second season, McShane won the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Drama (in addition to Emmy and Screen Actors Guild nominations as Outstanding Lead Dramatic Actor). He also received the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama for his work in the show's debut season (with a second nomination in 2005).\n\nIt is a role and performance the New York Times dubbed \"one of the most interesting villains on television.\" And, a recent online poll called Swearengen a more compelling onscreen gangster over the likes of Tony Soprano and Michael Corleone. After a twelve-year hiatus from portraying maybe his most iconic character (\"it was the most satisfyingly creative three years of my professional career\" he says), McShane recently reprised the unforgettable rogue when HBO resurrected the 1870s western in a two-hour telefilm, \"Deadwood: The Movie,\" nominated for the Outstanding Television Movie Emmy.\n\nAt an age when many successful thespians turn to cameo appearances and character parts, McShane's busy career (which dates back to 1962) also includes three very different starring roles on the big screen. He was seen alongside David Harbour in Neil Marshall's reimagined comic book epic, \"Hellboy.\" McShane also co-starred with Gary Carr in the Dan Pritzker drama, \"Bolden,\" the biopic of musician Buddy Bolden, the father of jazz and a key figure in the development of ragtime music (McShane portrays Bolden's nemesis, Judge Perry). And, he reprised his role (reuniting with Keanu Reeves) as Winston, the suave and charming owner of the assassins-only Tribeca hotel in the latest installment of director Chad Stahelski's action trilogy, \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,\" which opened to enormous box office success.\n\nYears before his triumphant role in \"Deadwood,\" McShane had compiled a long and diverse career on both British and American television. He produced and starred in the acclaimed series \"Lovejoy\" for the BBC (and A&E in the U.S.), directing several episodes during the show's lengthy run. The popular Sunday night drama (which attracted 18 million viewers weekly during its run from 1990-94) saw McShane in the title role of an irresistible, roguish Suffolk antiques dealer. He would reunite with the BBC by producing and starring in the darker and more serious drama, Madson.\n\nHe collected a second Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Miniseries for his portrayal of the scheming Waleran Bigod in Starz's Emmy-nominated \"Pillars of the Earth.\" The production, which originated on the U.K.'s Channel 4, was based on Ken Follett's bestselling historic novel about the building of a 12th-century cathedral during the time known as \"the Anarchy\" after King Henry I had lost his only son in the White Ship disaster of 1120. It's a character McShane says \"would fit into the Vatican.\"\n\nHe is also well-known to TV audiences for his roles in FX's \"American Horror Story,\" Showtime's \"Ray Donovan\" and, more recently, Amazon's \"Dr. Thorne\" and HBO's juggernaut, \"Game of Thrones\" (\"I loved the character and did it because my three grandkids, big fans of the show, wouldn't have forgiven me if I hadn't\"). And, he first worked with \"American Gods\" producer Michael Green on the short-lived NBC drama, \"Kings,\" a show (inspired by The Book Of Samuel) he calls \"far too revolutionary for network television.\"\n\nOther notable small screen roles include his appearance in David Wolper's landmark miniseries \"Roots\" (as the British cockfighting aficionado), \"Whose Life Is it Anyway?,\" Heathcliff in the 1967 miniseries \"Wuthering Heights\" and Harold Pinter's Emmy-winning \"The Caretaker.\" McShane has also played a variety of real-life subjects like Sejanus in the miniseries \"A.D.,\" the title role of Masterpiece Theater's \"Disraeli: Portrait of A Romantic\" and Judas in NBC's \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (directed by Franco Zeffirelli).\n\nMcShane, who shows no signs of slowing down in a career now entrenched in its sixth decade (\"acting is the only business where the older you get, the parts and the pay get better\"), began his career during Britain's New Wave Cinema of the early 1960s. He landed his first lead role in the 1962 English feature \"The Wild and the Willing,\" which also starred another acting upstart and fellow Brit - McShane's lifelong friend, the late John Hurt. McShane later revealed that he had ditched class at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art to audition for the role.\n\nSince that 1962 motion picture debut, McShane has enjoyed a fabulous run of character roles such as the sinister Cockney mobster, Teddy Bass, opposite Ray Winstone and Ben Kingsley in \"Sexy Beast\"; the infamous pirate, Blackbeard, alongside Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\"; and Richard Burton's bi-sexual partner, Wolfie, in the 1971 heist film, \"Villain.\" He gave Hayley Mills her first onscreen kiss as a smoldering gypsy in 1965's \"Sky West and Crooked,\" was part of the stellar ensemble cast (James Mason, James Coburn, Dyan Cannon) in the Stephen Sondheim-Anthony Perkins scripted big screen mystery, \"The Last of Sheila,\" and played a retired sheriff with a violent past opposite Patrick Wilson in the gritty drama, \"The Hollow Point.\"\n\nOther film credits include Guy Hamilton's all-star WWII epic, \"The Battle of Britain,\" the romantic comedy \"If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium,\" \"Pottersville,\" \"Hercules,\" \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" and \"Jawbone\" (reuniting with fellow Brit Ray Winstone in both), \"Jack the Giant Slayer,\" Woody Allen's \"Scoop,\" Rodrigo Garcia's indie drama \"Nine Lives\" (Gotham Award nominee for Best Ensemble Performance) and the darkly perverse crime drama, \"44 Inch Chest,\" a film in which McShane not only starred, but also produced.\n\nWhile also making his professional theatre debut in 1962 (\"Infanticide in the House of Fred August,\" Arts Theatre, London), McShane appeared onstage in the original 1965 production of Joe Orton's \"Loot.\" Two years later, he starred alongside Ian McKellen and Judi Dench in the hit stage play, \"The Promise,\" a production which transferred to Broadway in 1967 (with Eileen Atkins replacing Dench). He would return to Broadway one more time forty years later (2008), starring in the 40th anniversary staging of Harold Pinter's \"The Homecoming,\" for which he shared a Drama Desk Award as Best Cast Ensemble.\n\nMcShane also returned to the West End boards in 2000, charming audiences as the seductive, sex-obsessed Darryl Van Horne while making his musical stage debut in Cameron Mackintosh's \"The Witches of Eastwick,\" an adaptation of the 1987 film. At the esteemed Matrix Theatre in Los Angeles, he appeared in Harold Pinter's \"Betrayal,\" and John Osborne's \"Inadmissible Evidence,\" earning a pair of Los Angeles Drama Critics' Awards for Lead Performance in the process. He also starred in the world premiere of Larry Atlas' \"Yield of the Long Bond.\"\n\nIn addition to his work in front of the camera, McShane is also well-known for his voiceover work, with his low, distinctive baritone on display in a variety of projects. He voiced the eccentric magician, Mr. Bobinsky, in Henry Selick's award nominated \"Coraline\" (scripted by \"American Gods\" author Neil Gaiman), lent a sinister air to Tai Lung, the snow leopard adept at martial arts, in \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Annie Award nominee), and created the notorious Captain Hook in \"Shrek the Third.\" He also narrated Grace Jones' 1985 album, Slave to the Rhythm, succumbing to producer Trevor Horn's request to take the job because, per Horn,\" Orson Welles was dead, and I needed a voice.\" The album sold over a million copies worldwide. In the virtual reality domain, he recently lent his voice to the award- winning VR animated short \"Age of Sail\" in the role of the elderly sailor, William Avery, adrift alone in the North Atlantic.\n\nAfter almost sixty years entertaining audiences across the performance spectrum, McShane admits he did not set out for a career in the footlights while growing up in Manchester, England (he was actually born in Blackburn). It was by unexpected circumstances after McShane broke his leg playing soccer that he ended up performing in the school play production of Cyrano De Bergerac where he met his life-long friend and teacher, Leslie Ryder. Before he knew it, he auditioned for the Royal Academy of Arts where he was accepted and then left a term early to appear in the film, \"The Wild and The Willing\".\n\nMcShane never looked back.\n\nDan Stevens was born at Croydon in Surrey on 10th October 1982. His parents are teachers. He was educated at Tonbridge School and trained in acting at the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain. He studied English Literature at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Whilst he was a Cambridge undergraduate, he acted in several student drama productions. He played the title role in the Marlowe Dramatic Society's production of William Shakespeare's play, \"Macbeth\". This was staged at the Cambridge Arts Theatre from Tuesday 26th February to Saturday 2nd March 2002. The cast also featured Rebecca Hall in the roles of Lady Macbeth and Hecate. During one of his university summer holidays in August 2003 he went to Slovakia where he filmed his scenes for the Hallmark production of Die Kreatur - Gehasst & gejagt (2004). Dan played the part of Henry Clerval and the mini-series was first broadcast on American television on 5th October 2004. Shortly after graduating from Cambridge Dan was nominated for an Ian Charleson award for his performance as Orlando in \"As You Like It\" at the Rose Theatre at Kingston in Surrey. \"As You Like It\" was directed by Peter Hall and ran from 30th November to 18th December 2004. This production for the Peter Hall Company subsequently went on a tour of America in the early months of 2005, playing at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, the Curran Theater in San Francisco and the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City. It featured Rebecca Hall in the role of Rosalind.\n\nDan was reunited with the director Peter Hall when he played Claudio in a new production of the Shakespeare play, \"Much Ado About Nothing\", for the Peter Hall Company at the Theatre Royal in Bath from 29th June to 6th August 2005. In February 2006 Dan played the parts of Marban and Maitland in a revival of Howard Brenton's controversial play, \"The Romans in Britain\", directed by Samuel West at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Then in May 2006 he played Nick Guest, the protagonist in Die Schönheitslinie (2006). This three part television mini-series was adapted by Andrew Davies from the 2004 Booker prize winning novel by Alan Hollinghurst. Die Schönheitslinie (2006) is about Nick Guest's relationship with his university friend Toby Fedden. The story takes place in the 1980s. It is set against the backdrop of Margaret Thatcher's free market economic policies and the spread of the acquired immunity deficiency syndrome, (AIDS). These two social developments directly affect the characters in the story because Toby's father Gerald is a Conservative member of parliament and Nick is homosexual.\n\nWhilst Die Schönheitslinie (2006) was being broadcast on BBC television, Dan was appearing as Simon Bliss in the Noël Coward play, \"Hay Fever\". This play was staged at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London from 11th April to 5th August 2006 and the cast also included Judi Dench in the role of Judith Bliss. At the end of the year Dan played Lord Holmwood in a television dramatization of Dracula (2006), which was broadcast on 28th December 2006. In 2007 Dan played the part of Michael Faber in Nemesis (2007), an Agatha Christie adaptation with Geraldine McEwan in the role of Miss Jane Marple. He also featured in the cast of Maxwell (2007), a television drama about the famous newspaper magnate. Maxwell (2007) was first broadcast on British television on 4th May 2007. David Suchet played Robert Maxwell, and Dan took the part of Basil Brookes, one of the press baron's financial directors.\n\nDan played the part of Edward Ferrars in a television dramatization of Jane Austen's novel, Sinn und Sinnlichkeit (2008). This was broadcast in three episodes on BBC1 between Tuesday 1st and Sunday 13th January 2008. The novel was adapted for television by Andrew Davies, whom Dan had previously worked with on Die Schönheitslinie (2006). Davies felt that the part of Edward Ferrars was underdeveloped in the book, and so he deliberately added scenes not included in the novel to help draw out the character. So, for instance, we saw Edward out horse riding on the Norland estate and chopping logs at Barton Cottage. In the DVD audio commentary Dan joked that this was the best example of log chopping ever seen on British television! After Sinn und Sinnlichkeit (2008), Dan featured in the cast of \"The Tennis Court\", a BBC Radio 4 Saturday play broadcast on 19th January 2008. He also played Nicky Lancaster in a revival of the Noël Coward play, \"The Vortex\", at the Apollo Theatre in London from Wednesday 20th February to Saturday 7th June 2008. This was another collaboration with the stage director, Peter Hall. Dan played the eponymous hero of \"Dickens Confidential\", a six part radio drama series set in the 1830s which imagines what might have happened if Charles Dickens had continued his career as a journalist. This was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between Monday 9th June and Monday 14th July 2008. He played the part of Peregrine in 'Orley Farm', the BBC Radio 4 Classic Serial. This was a three part adaptation of the novel by Anthony Trollope broadcast between Sunday 28th December 2008 and Sunday 11th January 2009. A month later he played Duval in the BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour drama, 'The Lady of the Camellias'. This was broadcast between Monday 2nd and Friday 6th February 2009.\n\nJames Brian Mark Purefoy was born and brought up in Taunton, Somerset, England, the son of Shirley (Taylor), who ran an employment agency, and Anthony Chetwynd Purefoy. After leaving school at the age of sixteen, he took a succession of different jobs, including working on a pig farm and as a porter at Yeovil District Hospital, before travelling and working extensively throughout Europe. At eighteen, James returned to college to take his A-Levels, one of which was Drama. It was there that he realised that this was something he felt inspired by and so applied for and was accepted onto the acting course at the Central School of Speech and Drama.\n\nWhilst playing the title role in \"Henry V\" in the first term of his final year at Central, he was seen by a casting director from the RSC and invited to join the company, immediately, in Stratford. Although initially asked only to play \"Ferdinand\" in Nicholas Hytner's production of \"The Tempest\", he left the RSC two years later having performed in eight productions and been directed by the likes of Adrian Noble, Roger Michell and Gene Saks playing, amongst other, \"Edgar\" in \"King Lear\" and \"Malcolm\" in \"Macbeth\". Over the next six years, he divided his time between theatre and television. In the theatre, he worked with Katie Mitchell on \"Women of Troy\" at the Gate; Matthew Warchus, Ken Stott and Jude Law on \"Death of a Salesman\" at the West Yorkshire Playhouse; Iain Glen on \"Hamlet\" at Bristol Old Vic; Bill Alexander in a critically-acclaimed season at Birmingham Rep, playing leading parts in \"The Servant\", \"The Way of the World\" and \"Macbeth\"; and with Simon Callow, Joseph Fiennes, Rupert Graves, and Helen McCrory, on \"Les Enfants du Paradis\", again for the RSC.\n\nAs well as appearing in the BBC's landmark period drama, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1996), he has always chosen to do a wide variety of parts on television, to avoid being typecast. From the psychopathic rapist in BBC1's Calling the Shots (1993) with Lynn Redgrave to the fraudster \"Darius Guppy\" in LWT's \"The Prince\"; from the urbane observer \"Nick Jenkins\" in Channel 4's A Dance to the Music of Time (1997) to the sad stalker in Granada's series, Metropolis (2000), James has always managed to confound people's expectations of him. Over the last few years, he has been busy making feature films, on average at the rate of three a year. Early credits include \"Jedd Wainwright\" in Eine Sommernachtsliebe (1995) for \"Merchant Ivory\", and as the bisexual Irish baker, \"Brendan\" in Rose Troche's Kreuz und queer (1998). From the alcoholic roustabout \"Tom Bertram\" in Mansfield Park (1999) to the wannabee \"Bond\" actor \"Carl Phipps\" in Maybe Baby (2000); the gambling, womanising \"Daniel\" in Women Talking Dirty (1999) with Helena Bonham Carter to the noble, enigmatic \"Prince Edward\" in Brian Helgeland's Ritter aus Leidenschaft (2001).\n\nHe has continued to surprise those who seek to pigeon-hole him in his film career - always choosing to play parts that juxtapose strongly with the one he has just completed. Last year, he returned to the theatre to play the rake \"Ned Loveless\" in Trevor Nunn's acclaimed production of \"The Relapse\" at the National Theatre in London, before embarking on the biggest challenge he has yet faced - playing \"George\" in the big budget George und das Ei des Drachen (2004), with, among others, Michael Clarke Duncan, Val Kilmer, Piper Perabo and Patrick Swayze. This movie will be released in the summer of 2003. He lives alone in London.\n\nBritish actor Clive Owen is one of a handful of stars who, though he is best known for his art house films, can handle more mainstream films with equal measures of grace and skill. Owen is typically cast as characters whose primary traits are a balance of physical strength, intellect, conflicting soul but forceful will. He is best known to film audiences for his work in Children of Men (2006), Hautnah (2004) and his breakout part in Der Croupier (1998).\n\nBorn in Coventry, in England's West Midlands county, on 3 October 1964, Owen is the fourth of five brothers. He is the son of Pamela (Cotton) and Jess Owen, a country and western singer. His father abandoned the family when he was three years old, and Owen was subsequently raised by his mother and stepfather. He attended Binley Park Comprehensive School and joined the youth theater at 13 after playing the scene-stealing role of the Artful Dodger in a production of \"Oliver!\"\n\nActing was not his first choice as a profession, but he changed his mind and went on to graduate from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1987. Owen proceeded to join the Young Vic Theatre Company, where he honed his craft while performing in a number of Shakespearean productions.\n\nClive made his film debut in the British-made Vroom! - Ab in die Freiheit (1990) co-starring with David Thewlis as two fellows who restore a classic American car and take off on the road. Within two years, Clive became a full-fledged TV star playing devilish rogue Stephen Crane in Chancer (1990). However, the now-sought-after Clive abandoned the star-making part at the height of the show's popularity because of unwanted invasion of privacy and his fear of typecasting. His next project raised more than a few eyebrows when he filmed Schließe meine Augen - Begehre oder Töte mich (1991) in which he played a brother who acts on his incestuous desires for his older sister. Clive's reputation as a lovable shyster was completely shattered and he lost profitable commercial endorsements following the film's release. Offers fell off for the next two years as a result. But the persistent Clive carried on with stage work, including the role of a bisexual in a production of Noël Coward's \"Design For Living.\" He returned to TV at that time as well and played a number of roles in both mini-movies and series.\n\nIn 1997, Clive had a huge hit on the London stage with \"Closer,\" a cynical, contemporary ensemble piece about relationships. Controversy surrounded him again in the film role of Max in Bent (1997) playing a brash, reckless homosexual lothario in decadent pre-war Germany who finds unconditional love while interned in a Nazi war camp. His biggest film break, however, was in Mike Hodges' Der Croupier (1998), as a struggling writer-turned-casino employee who gets in over his head with a femme fatale scam artist. English audiences stayed away in droves but the U.S. embraced the film and Hollywood took notice of Clive, who was virtually unknown outside of England. Despite playing detective Ross Tanner in a series of successful \"Second Sight\" mini-movies and finding critical acclaim on stage with \"The Day in the Death of Joe Egg\" in 2001, Clive has focused primarily on film, including the offbeat Brit romantic comedy Greenfingers - Harte Jungs & zarte Triebe (2000), the classy and popular Robert Altman period piece Gosford Park (2001), the Matt Damon star-vehicle Die Bourne Identität (2002), and the title role in King Arthur (2004). He has since reached the top rungs of the Hollywood ladder with the film version of his stage smash Hautnah (2004), in which he received an Academy Award nomination and won both the Golden Globe and BAFTA awards for \"Supporting Actor.\" He also had noteworthy roles opposite Denzel Washington in Inside Man (2006); and Julianne Moore and Michael Caine in Children of Men (2006), as well as handling a few biopics, playing Sir Walter Raleigh opposite Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth I in the film Elizabeth - Das goldene Königreich (2007) and Ernest Hemingway (Emmy nomination) in Hemingway & Gellhorn (2012) also starring Nicole Kidman.\n\nMore recent films include starring roles in The International (2009), Duplicity - Gemeinsame Geheimsache (2009), The Boys Are Back - Zurück ins Leben (2009), Trust - Blindes Vertrauen (2010), Intruders (2011), Blood Ties (2013), Last Knights - Die Ritter des 7. Ordens (2015), The Confirmation (2016) and Anon (2018). He also played Claudius in a retelling of \"Hamlet\" per Ophelia's perspective in Ophelia (2018); and played in support to Will Smith in the sci-fi thriller Gemini Man (2019).\n\nOwen is married to former actress Sarah-Jane Fenton, who played Juliet to his Romeo at the Young Vic in 1998. The couple has two daughters.\n\nSeemingly omnipresent on both stage and screen, David Bradley has amassed a truly diverse gallery of memorable characters. The pugnacious-looking, gruff-voiced performer has played fools and kings, gardeners and fishermen, policemen and murderers, priests and madmen, undertakers and rabbis, a druid and a vampire hunter. On the Shakespearean stage alone, he has headlined as Henry IV, Titus Andronicus and Cymbeline, King of Britain. His numerous portrayals have included the foolish Polonius in Hamlet, the jester Trinculo in The Tempest, Mephostophiles in Doctor Faustus, and, unsurprisingly, Ebenezer Scrooge. He is quoted, saying, \"Not all the characters I play are on the side of the angels....I consider myself fortunate in having a lot of variety of work whether it's on stage or on film, and the parts have been rich and varied.\"\n\nBradley was born in York where his first exposure to performing in public at the age of fourteen began inauspiciously (he fainted from an attack of nerves). Nonetheless, he found himself inexorably drawn to the acting profession after a trip to the pictures, watching Laurence Olivier in his celebrated role as Richard III. (1955). Having left Catholic school, Bradley began his professional life by serving a five-year long apprenticeship with the optical instruments manufacturing firm of Cooke, Troughton & Simms, a subsidiary of Vickers. Moving on in 1966, he eventually took his first steps on the stage in musical productions with the York Boys Club and the Rowntree Youth Theatre. From there, he moved on to join the Settlement Players (getting his first grounding in roles by Shakespeare and Chekhov) and then the York Co-operative Players, where he was mentored by the producer Edward Taylor. Bradley later explained: \"He's the one who encouraged me to go to drama school, and helped me with my audition speeches.\"\n\nHaving relocated to London, Bradley was accepted by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and, in 1968, made his bona fide acting debut in a RADA theatrical production of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. In 1972, he successfully auditioned for Olivier and spent several seasons with the National Theatre Company. In 1978, he became an alumnus of the Royal Shakespeare Company. One of the high points of his theatrical career was receiving a Laurence Olivier Award in 1991 for his role as the fool in King Lear. More recently, in 2005, he headlined as Henry IV in Parts One and Two at London's Olivier Theatre.\n\nOn screen from 1971, Bradley toiled for some two decades in unremarkable supporting parts. His acting sharpened with the passage of time and he was given more substantial roles to play by the mid-90s. Three of his early standouts were in BBC period drama: his David Crimp, Secretary of the 'Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company', in an adaptation of Martin Chuzzlewit (1994); the lecherous and miserly Baronet Sir Pitt Crawley in Vanity Fair - Jahrmarkt der Eitelkeiten (1998) and the leering blackmailer Rogue Riderhood in Our Mutual Friend (1998), based on a lesser known novel by Charles Dickens. He also appeared with Christopher Eccleston in the political drama Our Friends in the North (1996), as independent Labour MP Eddie Wells. In Bradley's own words: \"That was the biggest part I'd ever done on TV and it opened up a lot of opportunities for me on screen\". In the excellent musical drama six-part miniseries Blackpool (2004), Bradley later portrayed Hallworth, a devout Christian anti-gambling crusader and vocal opponent of David Morrissey's overambitious arcade owner Ripley Holden.\n\nAfter playing a succession of curmudgeons and cantankerous old geezers, Bradley took a surprising detour into the comical, co-starring opposite Dawn French and Catherine Tate in Wild West (2002) as the entrepreneurial Cornish boatman Old Jake. He also popped up as the (aptly named) gun-toting farmer Arthur Webley in the buddy cop comedy Hot Fuzz - Zwei abgewichste Profis (2007) and as Cohen the Librarian, Discworld's 'greatest warrior', in Sky One's adaptation of Terry Pratchett's quirky fantasy Color of Magic - Die Reise des Zauberers (2008). By that time, he had also embarked on his recurring role as Argus Filch, the caretaker of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, in the Harry Potter films. Bradley later revealed that his children had steered him towards the Harry Potter franchise and 'coached' him for the role of Filch.\n\nReturning to period drama, Bradley appeared in too few scenes as the (wise) court jester Will Somers, the only individual who would console a distraught Henry VIII after the death of Jane Seymour in Showtime's historical drama series Die Tudors (2007). The following year saw him nominated by the London Film Critics Circle as Best Supporting Actor for his role as Ronnie Hepple in Mike Leigh's acclaimed 'kitchen sink' comedy-drama Another Year (2010).\n\nIf Harry Potter had not already put him on the map, Bradley's next set of performances would certainly have done the trick. In 2014, he won a BAFTA TV Award for his role as the tormented Jack Marshall, a local shopkeeper in Broadchurch (2013), unjustly accused of being a paedophile and murderer, consequently driven to suicide. Returning to the dark side side, he subsequently portrayed his most evil character to date, the duplicitous Walder Frey, Lord of Riverrun, in HBO's epic series Game of Thrones: Das Lied von Eis und Feuer (2011). Bradley relished the role of the man audiences loved to hate, with Frey having presided over the 'red wedding' (in season three's penultimate episode), at which Robb, Talisa and Catelyn Stark and many of their bannermen were brutally slain. In the aftermath of the show, Bradley quipped to reporters at the Television Critics Association's press tour \"wedding invitations have dried up\".\n\nIn 2012, Bradley made his entry (not counting earlier voice-over work and podcasts) into the Doctor Who (2005) universe as Solomon, a ruthless space pirate, in the episode \"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship'. He was then perfectly cast as William Hartnell --the actor who portrayed the very first Doctor in 1963-- in the BBC's excellent docu-drama Ein Abenteuer in Raum und Zeit (2013). Bradley followed up to play Hartnell's role in an episode of season ten ('The Doctor Falls'), the 2017 Christmas special 'Twice Upon a Time' and in the final 2022 special, entitled 'The Power of the Doctor'.\n\nMore recently, Bradley has appeared on TV as the fierce vampire hunter Abraham Setrakian, a holocaust survivor and New York pawnshop proprietor, relentlessly in pursuit of the demonic Strigoi (led by 'The Master', aka Sariel) while combating a global viral outbreak known as The Strain (2014). For his commanding performance, Bradley was nominated for a Fangoria Chainsaw Award and a Saturn Award by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA. Incidentally, the show's Setrakian character bears more than a passing resemblance to Van Helsing in Bram Stoker's classic 'Dracula'.\n\nBradley's other recent roles of note have included a wizened Druid in the historical fantasy Britannia (2017), the demented father of suicidal newspaper writer Tony Johnson (Ricky Gervais) in the black comedy After Life (2019) and the voice of Fowler, an elderly, stiff-upper-lip rooster and ex-RAF mascot, in Aardman's animation Chicken Run: Operation Nugget (2023).\n\nDavid Bradley holds honorary doctorates from the University of Warwick and from York St. John University. He has long resided n Stratford-upon-Avon, where he has served as president of Second Thoughts, a local community theatre group set up in 1984."
