However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\n\nA new face is joining Yellowstone spinoff 1923 for its second season, and it looks like he will be having a really good time. But who is joining the new season of 1923 and what role will they be playing?\n\nWho are the New 1923 Season 2 Cast Members?\n\nDeadline is reporting that Augustus Prew, who recently appeared in Players has joined the cast of the Paramount+ original drama series for Season 2 in a recurring role. Prew is set to Portray Paul, a “dapper, bookish, well-to-do young British man on a passenger ship.”\n\nPrew isn’t the only new face expected to join the cast for Season 2. Dexter alumna Jennifer Carpenter is also set to appear in the second season in the recurring role of Mamie Fossett. Mamie is a U.S. Deputy Marshall who serves warrants and makes arrests with a confidence that’s far ahead of her time.\n\n1923 was created by the man behind Yellowstone, Taylor Sheridan and it is the second offshoot in the Western franchise. The series is set a century before the events of the original Yellowstone and 40 years after the Tim McGraw-led prequel 1883. It follows a new generation of the Dutton family during a time of countless hardships including Prohibition, drought, and the early stages of the Great Depression, which affected Montana long before the Wall Street Crash of 1929.\n\nMore: Which Yellowstone favorite already filmed her last scene?\n\nThe first season starred Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren as the main couple Jacob and Cara Dutton. Jacob just so happens to be the brother of James Dutton (McGraw) and Claire Dutton (Dawn Olivieri), who both traveled west across the Great Plains in the late 19th century to give their family a better life. Everything is connected in Taylor Sheridan’s Yellowstone world. Now settled in Montana, Jacob and Cara live on the ranch fans have come to know and love.\n\nSeason 1 also starred Brandon Sklenar as Spencer Dutton; Julia Schlaepfer as Alexandra Dutton; Jerome Flynn as Banner Creighton; Darren Mann as Jack Dutton; Brian Geraghty as Zane Davis; Aminah Nieves as Teonna Rainwater; Michelle Randolph as Elizabeth “Liz” Strafford and Timothy Dalton as Donald Whitfield. The season was narrated by Isabel May, who portrayed Elsa Dutton in 1883.\n\nThe entire cast is expected to reprise their roles for Season 2, which although it hasn’t been confirmed by Sheridan, is expected to be the show’s last.\n\nMore: Who’s headlining the new Yellowstone spinoff?\n\n1923 was originally intended to be a limited season, but Sheridan realized he needed more episodes to close out this particular chapter of the Dutton family story. “Well, it’s really the second half of the season,” he told Deadline of Season 2. “This one is different than 1883 where I had the whole thing blocked out in my head. This one, I had no idea what I was going to do. I just went on a journey myself and I’m the one that made the call to the network, which is probably the greatest call they ever got. Hey, I need to make more episodes to finish this story. I need to do this in two blocks … For them, it is great because they get more content. For me, I get more runway.”\n\nIt’s still unknown what Season 2 will be about. Season 1 concluded with Donald Whitfield paying off the taxes the Duttons owed for their land. If the family can’t pay him back by the end of the year, then everything they own will belong to him.\n\n1923 is available to stream on Paramount+."
