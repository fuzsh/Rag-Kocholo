        "text": "From Prime Suspect to Happy Valley to No Offence, no-one does crime quite like the British TV mob.\n\nBut none, in our humble opinion, have ever eclipsed the magic of The Bill. With more than 2,000 episodes over 26 years, this national institution has never been equalled.\n\nYou'll remember the regular faces – Jim Carver, June Ackland, Mickey Webb and many more – but do you recall the guest stars that were drafted in week in, week out to keep the action on its toes?\n\nThere were loads of them, and quite a few have gone on to do some seriously big things.\n\nWe guarantee you forgot about this lot.\n\n1. Keira Knightley\n\nBefore Pirates of the Caribbean, Atonement and The Imitation Game, there was The Bill. Now a major Hollywood star who can pretty much pick and choose what jobs to commit to, Knightley appeared in the police show back in 1995.\n\nJust 10 years old at the time, she played Sheena Rose, a low-level thief who had a rather expensive collection of old coins stashed in her backpack.\n\nSpeaking on The Graham Norton Show back in 2014, the 33-year-old said: I was in The Bill as a child and it was the most exciting character I have ever played.\n\n\"I was just in the one episode but I loved it, and I was so cool at school because I was in it.\"\n\n2. David Tennant\n\nFollowing his time on Jessica Jones as Kilgrave, it's not difficult to imagine the former Doctor Who actor channeling some seriously dark energy. Tennant took on the role of Stephen Clemens back in 1995, a paedophile with a nasty temper who abducted and murdered schoolgirls.\n\nMarvel, eat your heart out.\n\n3. James McAvoy\n\nIn 1997, the Scottish star appeared in The Bill when he was just 18 as Gavin Donald, a 15-year-old runaway who was questioned after a busker was deliberately hit by a car.\n\nWith X-Men and, of course, Atonement with Bill alumni Knightley under his belt, it's safe to say he's come a long way since then.\n\n4. Ray Winstone\n\nThe hardest geezer to ever grace the screen, both big and small, was given the role of tough guy Simon Fielder in 1991. His character was interviewed about some boys who had gone missing.\n\nWUUUUURRRGHHHH.\n\n5. Sean Bean\n\nSeany always seems to kick the bucket in unpleasant circumstances. There was a satellite dish in Goldeneye, a barrage of arrows in Lord of the Rings and a spot of 'off with his head' in Game of Thrones.\n\nBut the people behind The Bill weren't as cruel. Bean took on the role of armed robber Horace Clark back in 1984, holding up shopkeepers and post office workers with an arsenal of weapons. But no-one died! Not even Bean. Before the watershed, innit.\n\nClark actually managed to escape while his accomplice was caught by the police. We can all agree he deserves at least one happy ending.\n\n6. Hugh Laurie\n\nThe 59-year-old has a fair few titles to his name – Blackadder, House, The Night Manager and, how could we forget, Spice World. But cast your mind all the way back to 1998 and the actor appeared in a little known ITV drama called The Bill as lawyer Harrap.\n\nHe even got to wear a wig and everything. Talk about a throwback.\n\n7. Russell Brand\n\nThese days the comedian is more concerned with answering life's big questions on his Under the Skin podcast and YouTube channel, but in 1994 he appeared in the police show as Billy Case, a teenager who is accused of assault – certainly no laughing matter.\n\n8. Robert Carlyle\n\nAnother famous Scotsman to join The Bill's ranks, the actor, who starred in Trainspotting, appeared as Tom Ward back in 1991. Five years later, Danny Boyle's masterpiece was born.\n\nWe wonder if he had any idea what was in store.\n\n9. Emma Bunton\n\nBunton appeared in a minor role as a teenager called Janice back in 1993, but she was no stranger to acting, popping up in EastEnders the year before as 'mugger girl', and again in 1994 as 'Casey'.\n\nBut crucially, that was the year her small-time gigs officially stopped because The Spice Girls formed and the rest, as we know, is history.\n\n10. David Walliams\n\nThese days the 47-year-old spends his time pressing a big red button on Britain's Got Talent and , a world away from the grit and grime of The Bill.\n\nThe former Little Britain star appeared back in 2002 as animal rights activist Ben Fletcher, who takes part in an anti-vivisection march.\n\nYou didn't see that one coming.\n\n11. Catherine Tate\n\nBefore The Catherine Tate Show, the 50-year-old appeared in The Bill between 1993 and 1997 as three different characters – Lynda Jansen, Karen Brogan and WDC Palmer.\n\nDid the ITV police drama spur on her love of multiple roles? We choose to think so.\n\n12. Paul O'Grady\n\nIf there's one thing we can all agree, it's that Paul O'Grady's drag alter ego Lily Savage is an iconic part of TV history.\n\nBut it wasn't Ms Savage who pulled on her stockings for the ITV series, but 'Roxanne'. The drag queen appeared in three episodes between 1988 and 1990, running the rent-boy circuit in the local area.\n\nThere's not nearly enough drag on primetime TV, in our opinion."
