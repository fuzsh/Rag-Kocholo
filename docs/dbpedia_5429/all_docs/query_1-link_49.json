        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Timothy Dalton, a Shakespearean-trained British actor, will be the next James Bond in the new spy movie 'The Living Daylights,' United Artists announced.\n\nDalton will be the fourth actor to play British secret agent 007 since Ian Fleming's character first appeared on movie screens 25 years ago.\n\nScotland's Sean Connery made 007 a symbol of macho-suave in the first Bond movies. He was succeeded by George Lazenby, an Australian who played the role only once, and Roger Moore, an Englishman who starred in the last several installments.\n\nDalton had been rumored as a leading contender for the coveted high-profile role, along with Irishman Pierce Brosnan of the 'Remington Steele' TV series and Australians Mel Gibson and Sam Neill.\n\nThe actor is currently filming a co-starring role in 'Brenda Starr,' an adventure picture in which he plays opposite the comic strip newspaperwoman as mystery man Basil St. John.\n\nA United Artists spokeswoman said the 40-year-old actor was flying to Florida for location shooting and was not immediately available for comment on his selection as the new James Bond.\n\nDalton has made such movies as 'The Lion in Winter' with Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn, 'Agatha' with Vanessa Redgrave and Dustin Hoffman and Mae West's final film, 'Sextette,' a 1977 production that also featured Ringo Starr and Tony Curtis.\n\nHis leading television roles included 'Mistral's Daughter,' 'The Master of Ballantrae,' 'Candida' and 'Sins' with Joan Collins.\n\nDalton, born in Wales, began his acting career on stage, joining the National Youth Theater after training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.\n\nHis first stage appearances were in 'Richard II' and 'As You Like It.' He has appeared in many other Shakespearean dramas including the Royal Shakespeare Company's 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Love's Labour's Lost.'\n\nHis other stage characterizations included the lead in Peter Shaffer's 'Black Comedy' and Lord Byron in 'The Lunatic, the Lover and the Poet' for the Old Vic.\n\nFilming for 'The Living Daylights,' the 16th James Bond movie not counting a takeoff called 'Casino Royale,' is scheduled to begin in late September in London with location shooting set for Austria, Morocco and Gibraltar.\n\n'The Living Daylights,' produced by Albert 'Cubby' Broccoli and Michael Wilson, will be directed by John Glen from a screenplay by Wilson and Richard Maibaum."
