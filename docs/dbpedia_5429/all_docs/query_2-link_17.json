        "text": "Having one successful TV show is impressive. Doing it more than once? Now you’re in rarified air. A smattering of TV actors have found success with multiple shows. For the purposes of this list, the actor had to be one of the stars of all the shows involved, and they have to be hit shows or critically-acclaimed shows. Spinoffs count, but being on “Saturday Night Live” and then getting your own sitcom does not. With those parameters set, here are some of TV’s most successful actors, and proof that lightning can strike (at least) twice.\n\n6 of 25\n\nMary Tyler Moore\n\nCBS\n\n“The Mary Tyler Moore Show” was a tremendous sitcom, and a few names on this list hit it big on that show. Mary Richards was an important character in the changing landscape of television, but that wasn’t Moore’s first time on a hit sitcom. Prior to getting her own show with a name in the title, Moore was on “The Dıck Van Dyke Show” was Laurie Petrie. It was a big show for Moore, and for Capri pants.\n\n7 of 25\n\nBetty White\n\nNBC\n\nWhite is such a TV legend, she got her first sitcom, “Life with Elizabeth,” way back in 1953. Let’s fast forward to the ‘70s when she joined the cast of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” as Sue Ann Nivens, the Happy Homemaker, a great addition to the ensemble. Of course, in the ‘80s there was “Golden Girls.” If that wasn’t enough, White was one of the stars of “Hot in Cleveland,” doing 128 episodes of TV despite being in her eighties.\n\n9 of 25\n\nTony Danza\n\nABC\n\nThere are a couple of actors from the “Taxi” cast we could have included. Danny DeVito joined the gang on “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” in the second season and has been doing that for a decade. Judd Hirsch has had a couple of his own sitcoms as well. However, the most successful show to be headlined by a “Taxi” actor has to be “Who’s the Boss?” which ran for 196 episodes.\n\n10 of 25\n\nMichael J. Fox\n\nABC\n\nFox had a massive movie career, especially the “Back to the Future” trilogy. Surrounding that movie career were two successful sitcoms. When Fox was still a kid he starred in “Family Ties,” and his star power was so clear that the show was basically rebuilt around Alex P. Keaton. As a little older of a man, Fox returned to TV with “Spin City.” While it was a hit, and Fox was great, he, unfortunately, had to leave the show after its fourth season due to his Parkinson’s symptoms.\n\n12 of 25\n\nCourteney Cox\n\nNBC\n\n“Friends” was a massive hit, as you surely know, and the main six actors all went off in different directions. The level of success varies by actor. Cox headed into films, but other than the “Scream” series it didn’t quite work out. You may try and argue her sitcom “Cougartown” didn’t really hit either. Well, it ran for 102 episodes and critics actually came around on it after it ditched its initial premise, so we’d argue otherwise.\n\n13 of 25\n\nJane Curtin\n\nNBC\n\nNo, like we said we aren’t including her time on “Saturday Night Live” as one of the original cast members. Curtin was one of the two titular stars of “Kate & Allie,” which won her an Emmy. She also co-starred in “3rd Rock from the Sun” for 137 episodes. While she wasn’t a member of the Solomon family and got overshadowed a bit by the hammy performances of John Lithgow and company, she did win a Satellite Award for the show.\n\n14 of 25\n\nEdie Falco\n\nHBO\n\nAs Carmine Soprano, wife of Tony Soprano, Falco was nominated for six Emmys and won three of them. “The Sopranos” is considered by many the best TV show ever. Then, Falco followed up with the “comedy” “Nurse Jackie.” We put that in quotes only because it was more of a dramatic show, but it was only a half-hour long which put it in the comedy categories at the Emmys. Hey, Falco still managed to win an Emmy for “Nurse Jackie” out of six more nominations.\n\n24 of 25\n\nTom Selleck\n\nCBS\n\nWhile he was starring on “Magnum P.I.,” Selleck was famously offered the opportunity to star in “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” but it didn’t work out. Had that happened, what could have been for Selleck’s career? He probably wouldn’t be currently starring on “Blue Bloods.” Sure, it’s one of those CBS dramas that have a reputation for only being watched by old people, but the fact remains Selleck is the star of a show that has run for over 220 episodes.\n\n25 of 25\n\nLucille Ball\n\nCBS\n\nBall was one of the first sitcom stars thanks to “I Love Lucy,” and she never really left the format. Ball followed “I Love Lucy” with the “Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour.” That was followed by “The Lucy Show,” which ran from 1962 through 1968. This was followed by “Here’s Lucy,” which aired from 1968 through 1974. Ball gave it one more shot with “Life with Lucy” in 1986, but it was canceled after 13 episodes. Still, that’s four sitcoms where Ball starred and had her name in the title."
