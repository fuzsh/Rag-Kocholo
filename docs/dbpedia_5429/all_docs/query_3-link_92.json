        "text": "Taylor Sheridan’s Yellowstone prequel series has been assembling quite the cast, and it looks like the series will be welcoming none other than James Bond to the ensemble. It was reported today that Timothy Dalton has joined the cast of 1923, a Yellowstone spinoff set to be led by Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren.\n\nHarrison Ford and Helen Mirren will play Jacob and Cara Dutton, the heads of the Yellowstone ranch. The series will introduce a new generation of the Dutton family and explore the early 20th century when pandemics, historic drought, the end of Prohibition, and the Great Depression all plague the Mountain West, and the Duttons who call it home. Timothy Dalton will play Donald Whitfield, a “powerful, self-confident man who reeks of wealth and the lack of empathy it requires to attain it. He is intimidating and nefarious and is used to getting what he wants.” In addition to Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, and Timothy Dalton, the Yellowstone spinoff also stars James Badge Dale, Robert Patrick, Jerome Flynn, Brandon Sklenar, Sebastian Roché, Darren Mann, Michelle Randolph, Robert Patrick Marley Shelton, Brian Geraghty, Aminah Nieves, and Julia Schlaepfer. Production on 1923 is currently underway in Montana, with the series debuting on Paramount+ in December 2022.\n\nRelated\n\nWhat Happened to Timothy Dalton?\n\nThe Yellowstone franchise has grown considerably in recent years. The first spinoff was a prequel series taking place in 1883 starring Sam Elliott, Tim McGraw, and Faith Hill. Although the series was only intended to last a single season, it will continue in the form of another spinoff with 1883: The Bass Reeves Story. The series stars David Oyelowo and tells the story of one of the greatest frontier heroes in American history. There’s also 6666, a present-day series focusing on the real-life ranch which appeared in Yellowstone‘s fourth season. “Founded when Comanches still ruled West Texas, no ranch in America is more steeped in the history of the West than the 6666,” reads the synopsis. “Still operating as it did two centuries before, and encompassing an entire county, the 6666 has inspired a new scripted series where the rule of law and the laws of nature merge in a place where the most dangerous thing one does is the next thing. The 6666 is synonymous with the merciless endeavor to raise the finest horses and livestock in the world, and ultimately where world-class cowboys are born and made.“"
