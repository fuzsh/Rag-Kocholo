        "text": "My story is about meeting Timothy Dalton about 20 years ago … think he was still playing James Bond at the time. I wasn’t fussed on him as James Bond, but he once played Mr Rochester in a 70’s BBC adaptation of Jane Eyre and I had a bit of a crush on him then.\n\nWhat happened is that my friend and I were in the Crown Bar in Belfast on a pre-Christmas outing and realised that TD was standing beside us at the bar.\n\nEgged on by my pal I spoke to him and he gave me a look like I was a wart on the backside of humanity and a monosyllabic reply. I was embarrassed and said something lame like ‘nice to see you in Belfast’ before turning away.\n\nThen about half an hour later when TD was leaving the bar, he deliberately caught my eye over the crowd and smiled and waved good-bye. I think once he realised we weren’t groupies and weren’t going to bother him, he was sorry he’d been rude. Anyway he sort of redeemed himself in my eyes.\n\nRedemption notwithstanding mind you … the Christmas Panto was on in the theatre across the road from the Crown and I still wish I’d said to him ‘Are you appearing as Widow Twanky or what?’ .. just to prick his Royal Shakespeare Co uppity-ness.\n\nHe was looking good I must add.\n\nI met danielle radcliffe on friday night at his stage door. Now when i meet a famous person for the first time i dont know how they are with fans, i put my hand out for a handshake as i was in the 2nd row and didnt think id get a picture. Someone moved out of the way and i touched him a couple of times. He didnt like it and asked me not to so i apolgosied 3 times and he must have accepted it as i did get a pic\n\nNow im being made to feel guilty about it ive been told off at least 3 times about it since. Not sure if this is the right thread for this but yeah i dont think he was being rude he just didnt like it\n\nI have heard (second hand so cant say 100%) a number of people say they are not the nice cheeky chappies they make themselves out to be. Alledgedly when Kelly Brook was on BGT for all of a day A&D are the reason she was sacked, nothing to do with a 4th judge format not working (as we have seen in recent series). They were not consulted and turned up to find out she had been brought in, kicked off and issued an ultimatum - either she went or they did. Producers were backed into a corner and what do you know Kelly is gone the next day !"
