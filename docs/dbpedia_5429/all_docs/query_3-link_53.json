        "text": "I recently watched all the James Bond films in chronological order. It was quite fascinating seeing how the series evolved, and also discerning which eras were the best and which were the worst. I’ve decided to do a ranking of all 25 Eon Productions films from worst to best. Doubtlessly I would rearrange my order. It’s really hard to get a firm grasp of where a quarter of a hundred movies fall on a list. The ones on the bottom will definitely stay around there, as will the ones on top. So here they are, separated into general categories from worst to best.\n\nThere will be some spoilers, mostly on the light side.\n\nNote: It’s hard to rank so many movies. I’ve actually rearranged the listing of a few films that after consideration were deemed better or worse than thought. These include Living Daylights, Octopussy, Thunderball, and The World is Not Enough.\n\nThe Bad Ones\n\n#25: Spectre (2015)\n\nPlot: Bond’s past comes back to haunt him as a shadowy organization is revealed to be behind terrorist attacks all around the world. He goes rogue (yawn) to find out more and comes across Madeleine Swann, the daughter of a former enemy with her own connection to the mysterious villain. Meanwhile MI6 is about to be taken over and upgraded by a douchebag named C.\n\nMini-Review: For the worst Bond movie of all time I selected Spectre. Shockingly Sam Mendes helmed a film that cast a ruinous, backwards shadow over the Daniel Craig era, even his own baby Skyfall. For the first time in over thirty years Blofeld could be put back on the big screen. Following the popularity of cinematic universes, Mendes decided to make Blofeld none other than Bond’s foster-brother (bringing to mind a comical plot twist from the Austin Powers films). What’s worse is that Blofeld supposedly orchestrated all the events of the previous three films to mess with Bond’s head. If taken seriously, this literally ruins compelling villains such as Le Chifre and Raoul Silva and by extension the conflicts in Casino Royale and Skyfall. Also M-16 is under scrutiny by the government for being out-of-date, a plot element that we already went through in the Skyfall. Add in a rushed romance between Bond and Madeleine Swann, an awful opening titles song, underwhelming music and action scenes, and a third act so bad and headscratching that many fans refuse to see it anything other than a hallucination sequence, and you have a very unentertaining James Bond flick.\n\n#24: Quantum of Solace (2008)\n\nPlot: The first direct sequel in the franchise, Quantum of Solace’s production was wrecked by the writer’s strike. It turns out that some of the villains in Casino Royale belong to a shadowy organization called Quantum. James Bond seeks to uncover its villainy while also struggling with feelings of vengeance and distrust. Oh, and the villains are rigging Bolivian politics so that they can control the country’s water supply. Continue reading →\n\nComposed and Conducted by: John Barry\n\nWhen Roger Moore finally left the 007 series, a confusing search ensued for the new James Bond. Timothy Dalton was chosen first, but a television series he was working on prevented him from accepting the role. Pierce Brosnan was then hired, but the producers of the TV show he was on decided that they could attract higher ratings now that he had been announced as James Bond. By the time Brosnan was forced from the film, Timothy Dalton was easily available. The Living Daylights presented a more realistic and less comedic Bond, with less one-liners and no super-weapons. However, the villains are still using the oft-repeated plot of starting a world war, this time through the Russian-Mujaheddin War in Afghanistan.\n\nThis would be John Barry’s last 007 film, and it’s a fitting exit for him. This time there are no less than three songs that provide themes for the film. “The Living Daylights,” sung by the Swedish band a-ha, is a very exciting opener, trying to emulate the success of Duran Duran’s “View to a Kill.” I like Duran Duran’s song better, but this is still a cool piece. Although the main tune was provided by John Barry, he only uses it three times throughout the entire score, its most well known iteration coming in “Hercules Takes Off.” Continue reading →"
