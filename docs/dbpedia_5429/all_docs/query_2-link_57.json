        "text": "Doesn’t anyone think American actors are good enough to star in TV shows anymore? The British invasion (and their Australian cousins) of crisp-voiced, theater-trained actors on American shores becomes more invasive each year, so producers — and network execs — clearly like working with them, whether they use their native accents or come equipped with a (usually) flawless American one. Here is a list of all the British actors currently starring in their own series.\n\nJonny Lee Miller, “Elementary”\n\nMiller has played a modern-day Sherlock Holmes on the CBS series for several seasons now. He proved so charismatic and witty that ABC went looking for their own version of “Elementary” and called it “Forever.”\n\nIoan Gruffudd, “Forever”\n\nThe Welsh-born Gruffudd stars on this “Elementary”-style series as Dr. Henry Morgan, a present-day New York City medical examiner who just happens to be immortal. Like Miller, he almost seems like a historic personage at odds in a contemporary setting.\n\nTom Mison, “Sleepy Hollow”\n\nIchabod Crane thought he was done for in the Revolutionary War until he woke up and found himself confronted by a very strange bunch of Americans in the town of Sleepy Hollow. As Crane, British-born Tom Mison cuts a dashing figure and captivates audiences with his dry wit.\n\nHayley Atwell, “Marvel’s Agent Carter”\n\nAgent Peggy Carter is an ultra-feminine yet scrappy spy who is played in a very forthright manner by the impeccable Hayley Atwell, whose British accent gives this intrepid do-gooder a greater air of authority.\n\nSimon Baker, “The Mentalist”\n\nAustralian actor Baker has used a good American accent and his natural charm to keep “The Mentalist” going for seven seasons as FBI crime consultant Patrick Jane.\n\nAlex O’Loughlin, “Hawaii Five-0”\n\nWhen casting about for an actor to play Steve McGarrett, the role made famous by Jack Lord, CBS chose . . . Alex O’Loughlin, an obscure Australian actor whose two previous CBS series — “Moonlight” and “Three Rivers” — failed. Somebody over there at Black Rock really has the hots for Alex, whose remake never achieved hit status and has already been moved to Friday nights.\n\nGavin Stenhouse, “Allegiance”\n\nHere is an interesting scenario: A series about two Americans (Hope Davis and Scott Cohen) who’ve been masquerading as Russian spies has a British actor (Gavin Stenhouse) playing that couple’s eldest (also American) child, a brilliant CIA analyst who discovers his parents’ secret. Was no American actor available to play opposite Americans Davis and Cohen?\n\nJoshua Sasse, “Galavant”\n\n“Galavant” is a musical comedy romp set in Arthurian times, and British-born Joshua Sasse captures the humor and whimsy of the concept. Plus, he can sing.\n\nMatthew Rhys, “The Americans”\n\nThis is a double masquerade. Audiences first heard Rhys’ flawless American accent on “Brothers & Sisters,” but on “The Americans,” he’s playing a Russian spy trying to pass as an American. For this Welsh actor, that’s quite a feat.\n\nRuth Wilson, “The Affair”\n\nWilson was so instantly believable as a Montauk waitress still reeling from the death of her 4-year-old son and embarking on a dangerous affair with a married teacher that, when she accepted her Golden Globe award last month, people were shocked to hear a completely different and very British voice come out of her mouth. A lot of actresses must have been up for this part, but Wilson was the best choice.\n\nDominic West, “The Affair”\n\nWest has played an American before — Jimmy McNulty on “The Wire.” But “The Affair” gave him a chance to stretch himself and play a middle-aged man willing to upend his life for the chance to be with the woman he loves (not his wife).\n\nEamonn Walker, “Chicago Fire”\n\nThe great British character actor first made a splash as Muslim leader Kareem Said on the groundbreaking HBO prison drama “Oz.” He has now secured a starring role on a mainstream network series as Chicago fire department chief Wallace Boden on the Dick Wolf drama “Chicago Fire.” Any number of American actors could have played this part, but Walker’s trademark intensity is something you remember from role to role.\n\nAndrew Lincoln, “The Walking Dead”"
