        "text": "Timothy Dalton was \"never comfortable\" in the role of James Bond according to the series' casting director.\n\nDebbie McWilliams, who has cast every James Bond film since 1981's For Your Eyes Only, was talking about her role in the series as part of the BFI's 'In conversation: 60 years of James Bond' event.\n\nRead more: James Bond at 60: Producers reveal 007 secrets at BFI panel\n\nAddressing the casting of Dalton to replace Roger Moore, McWilliams said: \"To be honest with you, I don't think he ever felt quite comfortable. It was so different from anything he'd ever done.\"\n\nMcWilliams also detailed how Dalton was cast at the last minute after Pierce Brosnan became unavailable: \"The way he was cast was a very sudden event, because we had Pierce Brosnan lined up. I mean, obviously, you always have to have somebody up your sleeve, whatever happened. So he [Dalton] was kind of standing by in the wings.\"\n\nShe added: \"Quite literally over the weekend he was cast and I think it was all a bit of a shock for him.\"\n\nBrosnan was originally supposed to be Moore's replacement but he was locked into a contract on US TV show Remington Steele that he couldn't get out of. He eventually replaced Dalton and played Bond between 1995 and 2002.\n\nBefore being cast as Bond, Dalton was best known for his role in the historical epic The Lion in Winter as well as his work in the theatre though had previously been considered to play the spy after Sean Connery stepped away from the role.\n\nDalton only appeared in two Bond films – 1987's The Living Daylights and 1989's Licence to Kill – before legal issues between MGM and Eon delayed another sequel for six years.\n\nSince leaving the role, Dalton is best known for his appearances in Doctor Who, Hot Fuzz and Penny Dreadful."
