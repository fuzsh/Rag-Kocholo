        "text": "The British actor Timothy Dalton has been named to replace Roger Moore as James Bond in the 25th anniversary film about Ian Fleming's dashing secret agent, producer Albert Broccoli said today.\n\nMr. Dalton, 38 years old, a Shakespearean actor who has also appeared in 11 films and on television, will be the fifth actor to portray Agent 007 in the popular series when shooting of ''The Living Daylights'' begins in London late next month.\n\nThe other leading candidate to take over the role of James Bond, who along with Mr. Moore has been played by Sean Connery, George Lazenby and David Niven, was the Irish-born actor Pierce Brosnan. They said Mr. Brosnan was unable to win release from his contract as television's romantic private detective ''Remington Steele.'' The series was renewed by NBC two months after it had been canceled, and filming for the new season has already begun.\n\n''The Living Daylights'' will be directed by John Glen for United Artists at Pinewood Studios, with locations set for Austria, Morocco and Gibraltar."
