        "text": "Reeve Carney is to play Jeff Buckley, who drowned in 1997, in a planned biopic, says Richard Fitzpatrick\n\nU2 took over the seafront in Bray, Co Wicklow for the last few days — filming what many believe is the cover for their new album.\n\nCalifornia resident Ryan Kraft was given a stark warning by the Lanza family when he used to babysit Adam Lanza.\n\nWere it not for the introduction of de rigueur 3D, this fourth computer-animated feature based on JM Barrie’s scantily-clad fairy would surely have fluttered straight to DVD.\n\nTime waits for no man, not even the suave and sharply attired 007.\n\nDaniel Craig is the James Bond actor most married women want to have an affair with.\n\nMel Gibson used some lightning legal moves to abruptly end a domestic violence case involving a fight last year with his then-girlfriend.\n\nOksana Grigorieva didn’t think she would “make it through the night” if she stayed with Mel Gibson.\n\nOksana Grigorieva has been left “scared to death” by threatening phone calls, according to online reports.\n\nMel Gibson knocked his ex-girlfriend’s teeth out during a violent row, it has been claimed.\n\nMel Gibson allegedly cheated on ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva while she was pregnant with their daughter.\n\nNews that Bond is being put on hold has sparked concern about Daniel Craig’s future.\n\nMel Gibson’s ex-girlfriend insists the pair will continue to be doting parents to their daughter despite their recent split.\n\n'Doctor Who' star David Tennant said he and former 'James Bond' actor Timothy Dalton showed their mutual respect by breaking into a singsong of each other’s theme tunes.\n\nMel Gibson is an “incredible” and “hands-on” father to his new baby daughter.\n\nMel Gibson’s girlfriend is confident he will never cheat on her.\n\nMel Gibson has become a father for the eighth time.\n\nSimon Pegg is expected to play a mass murderer in a new movie.\n\nAUTHOR Sebastian Faulks has admitted he found it a challenge to write a new James Bond story.\n\nSuper big-city cop Pegg, so good his colleagues are embarrassed at his success, is sent into exile in a backwater rural village where murders are overtaking the excitement of flower shows.\n\nA fleet of police motorcycles escorted the British stars of new movie Hot Fuzz to the film’s premiere in London.\n\nEnglish actor Daniel Craig has vowed to be the \"baddest\" James Bond in the history of the film franchise.\n\nThe new James Bond hasn’t even had his first martini yet and he’s already got another job, according to reports in the US.\n\nJames Bond producers have refused to comment on reports that British actor Daniel Craig will be the next 007.\n\nHollywood star Liam Neeson turned down the chance to play James Bond, because he has never been interested in starring in action movies.\n\nTHE annual Canon Hayes National Sports Awards in Tipperary will incorporate a new category this year in memory of the late international rugby player and coach, Mick Doyle.\n\nPlans for James Bond’s next mission have been delayed by a year because movie-makers are still searching for a new secret agent."
