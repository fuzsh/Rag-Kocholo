Just saying.\n\nAs a huge Dalton fan from the beginning, I've never had any questions about his toughness and completely bought into the Dalton is Dangerous marketing tag. No, he's not Craig or Connery or even Lazenby, but never did I question his toughness. I think some of it was intentional on Dalton's part in saying you can't identify with a superman and wanting to appear more vulnerable. Although I have to admit I wondered when TLD was released why the best fight in the film was between Necros and the guard at the safe house.\n\nso you are saying the fight scene on the back of the plane isn't good? The fight scene in the Jail in the middle east isn't any good? What are you talking about? Yeah fair enough the LTK key west fight is cringeworthy and campy, but to say he doesn't have any good fight scenes is a joke of a statement...\n\nThe fight scene on the back of the plane is ofcourse great, but that is more of a stuntscene then a real man to man fight scene with Dalton. The fightscene in the jail is not realy great, not Connery, Lazenby or Craig level, it's a little silly, it's more The A-team like (the televisionshow, not the movie). And no it's not a joke of a statement, it's just an opinion, maybe not yours, but mine.\n\nPersonally, I've alwas cringed and felt the punch Necros took from Dalton's Bond in the fight on the cargo net.

Although I have to admit I wondered when TLD was released why the best fight in the film was between Necros and the guard at the safe house.\n\nThat is exactly what I mean: the realy great fightscene from TLD and what remines me of the old Connery (and Lazenby) Bondmovies is without Dalton, but between Necros and the guard. Such a tough and exellent staged fight doesn't have Dalton himself in his two Bondmovies at all.\n\nThe fight between Necros and the Guard is the best in the whole series.\n\nBond versus Grant (FRWL) is way better and more suspensfull, because it is with Bond himself.\n\nNothing to do with TD of course, but it's always struck me as a curious director/writer decision, to have such a great fight that doesn't feature Bond, and not even the primary villain (to me Necros has always been a henchmen, rather the villain, though the blurred lines with these roles is one of the things that undermines TLD).\n\nAnd the focus on the fight is really unnecessary - there isn't some great plot point in the fight - it's just part of the set-piece that is the kidnapping at the safe house. You almost feel everyone got carried away with how great it is, without stopping to think \"it's too much attention on some side action.\"\n\nI think it's a great, yet because of who's in it, a weirdly unfulfiling moment. I guess it does establish Necros as a nasty piece of work, but he's already whacked the milkman to show the audience what a meanie he is.\n\nTo me it boils down to whether you see Bond as a thug pretending to be an aristocrat, or an aristocrat acting like a thug.\n\nI think Connery, Lazenby, and Craig fall into the former category, and Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan in the later.\n\nThe book Bond is also in the later category. The book Bond is skilled at hand to hand combat, but he isn't a brick sh#thouse running through walls.\n\nHe does press ups and Judo - more lithe and cunning than brute force.\n\nWhile I would rank Dalton in the lower tier for his fight scenes (not entirely his fault), I would put him in the top tier for every other component of portraying Bond and think he is the most accurate portrayal of Fleming's Bond that has ever been put on celluloid.\n\nwhatculture april 8 2013\n\n007 Reasons Timothy Dalton Was Actually A Fantastic Bond\n\nhttp://whatculture.c...tastic-bond.php\n\nMore fanboy nonsense. And most of the points are fairly easy to deflate.\n\nHe saved the series? Yeah... right... LTK did wonders for the series' longevity.\n\nThe article repeats that canard that the producers wanted him for OHMSS. Our own DNS has had plenty to say about that.\n\nHe can play villains? Okay. But all the more reason he can't play heroes.\n\nHe's nothing like Fleming's Bond. I think it was our own SNF who once articulated the differences between the two. I think it was our own Jim who said there was more Fleming in five minutes of the film TMWTGG than there was in the two Dalton films.\n\nThis Dalton adulation reaches its nadir when the fanboy author claims Dalton brought the series into the modern age with \"hokey\" (his words, not mine) villains a thing of the past. Hmmm... I guess Mr. fanboy never read the Bond 17 treatment. Anthropomorphic villains, anyone?\n\nDalton did not pave the way for a darker, edgier JB. JASON BOURNE DID. Period.\n\n\"Adding to the somewhat superfluous\" not to mention unfounded and dishonest \"hypothesis that Craig would not have been as popular if Dalton had not already taken Bond in a similar direction...\" Does anybody here truly believe this? How many casual Bond fans and regular moviegoers who've seen the Craig films actually saw or liked the Dalton films? There's a pretty good chance the moviegoers who've made the Daniel Craig Bonds big box-office hits have probably not seen every pre-Brosnan Bond film. In fact I'm convinced that Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig are the two Bonds many are most familiar with. If only the die-hard fans went to see a Bond film... well... look at the returns for OHMSS, TMWTGG, AVTAK, TLD and LTK. That's what happens when the core viewership is us guys and not the great unwashed.\n\nThe author's #1 reason why Dalton was supposedly so great? \"He quit.\" Yep. Some reason. Okay, the author also says, \"He didnât stay on until he was no longer wanted.\" Dunno about that. The studio, quite a few (mostly North American) fans and casual moviegoers thought he hung on for two films too many.\n\nThe article even makes those same spurious comparisons between LTK and QOS that appear on these and other boards. Even Dalton fans conceed that QOS was tonally cohesive while admitting that Dalton's two Bond films feel like Dalton and the production team were pulling in two very different directions. One of our own members who worked on the films said they should have replaced John Glen when Dalton took over.\n\nI've said it elsewhere and I'll say it here: Dalton and Craig are like chalk and cheese.\n\nLet the flaming begin!\n\nThe author's #1 reason why Dalton was supposedly so great? \"He quit.\" Yep. Some reason. Okay, the author also says, \"He didnât stay on until he was no longer wanted.\" Dunno about that. The studio, quite a few (mostly North American) fans and casual moviegoers thought he hung on for two films too many.\n\nDon't think this is really telling the whole truth. As far as I remember audiences and critics were happy enough with Dalton after TLD. I remember fond reviews in a number of publications which previously had dismissed Bond for some time or ignored more recent entries altogether, amongst them the Herald Tribune. My impression was Dalton was very welcome at the time of TLD, with mostly favourable comparisons to Connery and the great days of the series. Dalton's undoing was LTK, and this primarily because of behind-the-scenes politics of the Bond industry.\n\nDalton's position after LTK was not so different from Moore's after TMWTGG (or Craig's after QOS), what he lacked was the support of a crucial group of studio suits and a really persuasive third Bond production. The series repeatedly has been at this point, a watershed moment for every actor in the role. Dalton didn't get that third chance, others did. But I think it's just as wrong to claim he was not liked right from the start than to claim he saved the series. If Dalton hadn't shown promising potential in TLD there wouldn't have been LTK.\n\nEdited by Dustin, 08 April 2013 - 07:30 PM.\n\nThe author's #1 reason why Dalton was supposedly so great? \"He quit.\" Yep.

I think Moore had the support of the studio and we know Craig absolutely did.\n\nI didn't say that Dalton wasn't liked from the start. I did say there were a number of North American fans and casual movie-goers who did not like him. Let's not forget Dalton told a fan publication during the making of LTK that he had a feeling this would be the final Bond film ever, not just his last. A lot of North American casual moviegoers and fans did not like Dalton. As someone here said, they avoided LTK in droves because they didn't like what they'd seen in TLD. I realize this is different across the sea. The British were more accepting about Dalton.\n\nMoreover, Moore's second film started strong in North America, but business turned soft due to bad worth of mouth. QOS was a major hit, though negative word of mouth did soften business slightly after its stellar opening weekend. LTK started soft - in the North American market - and only went downhill. And Dalton remains the only actor whom the studio actively tried forcing out the door. Much has been written about the Calley vs. Broccoli tempest at this point.\n\nMy original post didn't refer to critics because by and large they did consider Dalton an improvement on aging Moore.\n\nEdited by glidrose, 08 April 2013 - 08:10 PM.\n\nThe author's #1 reason why Dalton was supposedly so great? \"He quit.\" Yep.

Much has been written about the Calley vs. Broccoli tempest at this point.\n\nMy original post didn't refer to critics because by and large they did consider Dalton an improvement on aging Moore.\n\nYes, that was my impression, too.\n\nBut I think someone like Calley could also well have prevented Moore's or Craig's third entry, based on the returns of their second ones and some Bond-in-waiting-backstage. And what would we have made then of the cut-down Moore tenure or the fate of Craig's ignominious 'reboot'? I suppose it only ever takes a tiny difference to arrive at a completely different outcome, something like a butterfly's flap. Had Calley not prevented that ill-fated third Dalton film, who knows what we might have gotten in return? Dalton's two performances were not so uneven as to prevent him entirely from 'finding' his balance at the third try, the way Moore effectively did for most audiences.\n\nHe's nothing like Fleming's Bond. I think it was our own SNF who once articulated the differences between the two. I think it was our own Jim who said there was more Fleming in five minutes of the film TMWTGG than there was in the two Dalton films.\n\nPut down the crack pipe.\n\nDon't refer to SNF as \"our own\" - he threatened litigation against a number of people - including the owners of this site because of a Facebook post. He's been banned with good reason.\n\nRe: TMWGG. I must have missed Fleming's research on midgets, flying cars, schoolgirls doing Kung Fu, and redneck sheriffs doing barrel rolls with a slide whistle when I was going through his archives and manuscripts. Perhaps I wasn't trying hard enough?\n\nI realize it is lost on most of Bond fandom, but I always try to separate the actor's choices from the producer's or the studio's.\n\nDalton certainly wasn't responsible for the fact that his films were budgeted the same as those from a decade earlier.\n\nHe wasn't responsible for the writing. TLD is overly complex, LTK, hampered by the writer's strike, is weak on all kinds of levels. He certainly had nothing to do with the bizarre Bond 17 treatments, though you seem to blame him for those too.\n\nHe wasn't responsible for the weak casting of his leading ladies, or the weak casting of his villains.\n\nHe wasn't responsible for Glen's direction. While his LTK quote about shooting interior stuff like it was television will always be an easy place for fanboys to point to him as a hack, I don't think that is fair. Having been through the production documents of the entire Glen era I came away amazed at just how efficient he was regardless of the issue. It was one of the many reasons they kept going back to him. Sure, we realize now that you need to give the films longer production schedules and more breathing room - but he didn't have that luxury.\n\nI could continue my defense and celebration of the Dalton era but I've already produced my dissertation on that.\n\nAnd if you think Dalton isn't Fleming's Bond, then I suggest you go back and re-read Fleming, in Draco's words, carefully this time."
