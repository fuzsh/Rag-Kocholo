        "text": "_\n\nThe Television Academy traditionally hands out Emmy Awards in the Los Angeles area, but that doesn't necessarily give Hollywood-native TV stars a home court advantage. In fact, there have been quite a few small-screen winners over the years who hail from across the pond. Following the 75th Primetime Emmys ceremony, which aired on Jan. 15, 2024, we're taking a look back at the British actors and actresses who've reigned supreme on TV's biggest night, starting with this superstar…\n\nEnglish music star Elton John won his first Emmy in January 2024 — for his Disney+ special \"Elton John Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium\" — and with it joined the elite EGOT ranks — the club for those artists who have Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.\n\nHe wasn't able to be at the Los Angeles ceremony to accept his trophy — for outstanding variety special for his 2022 \"Dodger Stadium\" special capturing one of his final North American tour performances during his farewell tour — after having knee surgery but said in a statement that he was \"incredibly humbled to be joining the unbelievably talented group of EGOT winners tonight.\"\n\n\"The journey to this moment has been filled with passion, dedication and the unwavering support of my fans all around the world. Tonight is a testament to the power of the arts and the joy that it brings to all our lives. Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout my career, I am incredibly grateful,\" he added.\n\nElton's husband David Furnish — who produced \"Elton John Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium\" — was on hand to pick up their Emmys. (David, by the way, was born in Canada and spent nearly three decades in England before he was granted British citizenship in early 2017.)\n\nKeep reading for more…\n\nMORE: Follow Wonderwall on MSN for more fun celebrity & entertainment photo galleries and content\n\n_\n\nNorfolk, England-born Matthew Macfadyen starred on HBO's smash hit \"Succession\" and earned his first ever Primetime Emmy in 2022 for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for his role as Tom Wambsgans. He brought home his second award after winning during the 2023 Emmys in the same category for his work on the final season of \"Succession.\"\n\nMORE: Stars at their first Emmy Awards\n\n_\n\nDuring the 2021 Emmys, Olivia Colman — who was born in Norwich, England — won the award for best lead actress in a drama series for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II on \"The Crown.\" It was her second time earning an Emmy nomination for her work as Her Majesty on the hit Netflix series, and she'd previously scored Emmy nods for her acting on \"Fleabag\" and \"The Night Manager\" too. But Olivia wasn't the only English actress who won an Emmy in 2021 for playing the monarch… nor was she the only Brit who won big during the 2021 Emmys: U.K. actors came out on top in seven of the 12 major acting categories.\n\nMORE: Best Emmy jewels of all time\n\n_\n\nClaire Foy scored her first Emmy in 2018 for playing a legendary Brit: Queen Elizabeth II. The English actress, who was born in Manchester, was named best lead actress in a drama series for her portrayal of the monarch as a young woman on \"The Crown.\" (She scored her first nomination for the same award a year earlier.) In 2021, she won her second Emmy for her work as Queen Elizabeth II — this time in the outstanding guest actress in a drama series category after she briefly returned to the role on the fourth season of \"The Crown.\"\n\n_\n\nDuring the 2021 Emmys, London native Tobias Menzies — who sadly wasn't on hand to claim his big win — won the award for best supporting actor in a drama series for his performance as Prince Philip on \"The Crown.\" It was his first nomination.\n\n_\n\nDuring the 2021 Emmys, London native Brett Goldstein won the award for best supporting actor in a comedy series for his work on \"Ted Lasso.\" It was his first nomination.\n\nHe also took home the same trophy for the same show in 2022.\n\n_\n\nAnother British \"Ted Lasso\" star who won big during the 2021 Emmys for their very first nomination? London native Hannah Waddingham, who took home the prize for best supporting actress in a comedy series.\n\n_\n\nFreshly minted two-time Emmy winner Kate Winslet took home the trophy for outstanding lead actress in a miniseries or movie for her work on HBO's \"Mildred Pierce\" in 2011 and then won in the same category exactly a decade later for her performance as the titular detective on the HBO miniseries \"Mare of Easttown.\"\n\n_\n\nDuring the 2021 Emmys, Ewan McGregor — who was born in Perth, Scotland — won his first Emmy in the best lead actor in a miniseries or movie category for his performance as the titular American fashion designer on \"Halston.\" He previously earned nominations for his work on \"Fargo,\" \"ER\" and \"Highlands: Scotland's Wild Heart.\"\n\n_\n\nDuring the 2021 Emmys, Josh O'Connor — who was born in Southampton, England — won the award for best lead actor in a drama series for his work as a young Prince Charles on \"The Crown.\" It was his first nomination.\n\n_\n\nJohn Oliver won three Emmys for outstanding writing for his work on the late night variety news hit \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\" The British comedian — who was born in Birmingham, England, but moved to New York City after his career took off — has since taken home more than a dozen more Emmys, including for outstanding variety talk series, outstanding writing for a variety series and scripted variety series, for his work on his own HBO show, \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.\"\n\n_\n\nEnglish actress Helen Mirren was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her immense contributions to the arts, so it's no surprise she's also been honored for her TV work in America: She claimed four Emmys for outstanding lead actress in a miniseries or movie between 1996 and 2007. Most recently, she won Emmy gold for her work as one of the first female detective chief inspectors in London's Metropolitan Police Service on the drama \"Prime Suspect.\"\n\n_\n\nWest London-born multi-hyphenate Phoebe Waller-Bridge took home three Emmys — outstanding writing for a comedy series, outstanding lead actress in a comedy series and outstanding comedy series — for her work on \"Fleabag\" during the 2019 Emmy Awards.\n\n_\n\n\"Killing Eve\" star Jodie Comer, who was born in Liverpool, England, scored her first Emmy nomination — outstanding lead actress in a drama series — in 2019 then took home the prize at that year's Emmy ceremony.\n\n_\n\nEnglish actor Ben Whishaw claimed the Emmy for best supporting actor in a limited series or movie for his performance in \"A Very English Scandal\" during the 2009 Emmys. It was his first Emmy nomination too!\n\n_\n\nDamian Lewis won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his work on \"Homeland\" in 2012. Ironically, the English actor scored his big win playing an American Marine Corps sergeant on the thrilling spy show.\n\n_\n\nWelsh actor Matthew Rhys had three Emmy nominations under his belt before he picked up his first statue in 2018, taking home some hardware for outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his work on \"The Americans.\"\n\n_\n\nJane Seymour officially became an American citizen in 2005, but she was still 100% British when she won an Emmy in 1988 for outstanding supporting actress in a miniseries or movie for her performance as Greek opera singer Maria Callas on the TV biopic \"Onassis: The Richest Man in the World.\" The former Bond girl, who was born in the London area, has five more Emmy nominations to her name.\n\n_\n\nIn 2017, English actor Riz Ahmed became the first man of Asian descent to win an Emmy for acting. (He was named best lead actor in a limited series or movie for his work on \"The Night Of,\" which is based on the 2008 British crime show \"Criminal Justice.\") \"I'm really proud to be a Londoner. I'm really proud to be from the U.K.,\" he gushed just moments after picking up his award. \"I'm also really aware that actors of color often have more opportunity in the U.S., but I think ultimately now we see that TV in particular is a global medium.\"\n\n_\n\nLondon-born Emma Thompson — who, like Helen Mirren, is a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire — has been nominated for six Emmys since winning the award for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series for her work on \"Ellen\" back in 1998.\n\n_\n\nWelsh actor Anthony Hopkins has two Emmys for best lead actor in a limited series or movie to his name: He won for his work in the made-for-TV movie \"The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case\" in 1976 and for his portrayal of Adolf Hitler in the made-for-TV movie \"The Bunker\" in 1981. He's earned four more nominations since then.\n\n_\n\nThandiwe Newton won her first Emmy — best supporting actress in a drama series for her work as Maeve Millay on HBO's \"Westworld\" — in 2018. The uber-talented London-born beauty was nominated in the same category the previous year and again in 2020.\n\n_\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch — whom Queen Elizabeth II appointed a CBE for services to the performing arts in 2015 — scored seven Emmy nominations between 2012 and 2018, but he's only claimed top honors once: In 2014, he won the award for best lead actor in a miniseries or movie for his performance as the titular detective on \"Sherlock.\" Most recently, the English actor — who was born in London and grew up in Kensington and Chelsea — earned two Emmy nods for his work on \"Patrick Melrose.\"\n\n_\n\nScottish actress Kelly MacDonald, who was born in Glasgow, won the Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a miniseries or movie for her work in the HBO made-for-TV movie \"The Girl in the Cafe\" in 2006. She was nominated again — but didn't win — for her work on the HBO prohibition drama \"Boardwalk Empire\" in 2011.\n\n_\n\nMaggie Smith's work has been so widely celebrated in England that Queen Elizabeth II appointed the Essex native a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Order of the Companions of Honour. In America, the English actress has been honored with four Emmys. Most recently, she collected a trophy for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series for her work on \"Downton Abbey\" in 2016.\n\n_\n\nEnglish comedian Ricky Gervais has earned 24 Emmy nominations since 2005, but he's only won twice: first in 2006 for executive producing the American version of \"The Office\" (the NBC sitcom, which was named best comedy series that year, is based on a British series of the same name that he created) and then in 2007 for his starring turn on the HBO comedy \"Extras.\" (Ricky won the Emmy for best lead actor in a comedy series for his performance as aspiring actor Andy Millman.)\n\n_\n\nBack in 2001, Kenneth Branagh won the Emmy for best lead actor in a miniseries or movie for his work in the HBO made-for-TV movie \"Conspiracy.\" The esteemed actor-filmmaker — who was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, but relocated with his family to Berkshire, England, amid the Troubles — has earned three more Emmy nominations since then.\n\n_\n\nQueen Elizabeth II appointed Julie Andrews — like many of her fellow esteemed British thesps — a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her contributions to the performing arts. And like many of her peers, the English actress, who was born in Surrey, has also been honored for her work as an actress in the United States. She won her first Emmy — outstanding variety musical series for \"The Julie Andrews Hour\" — in 1973 and her second — outstanding nonfiction series for \"Broadway: The American Musical\" — in 2005.\n\n_\n\nVanessa Redgrave earned six Emmy nominations between 1981 — when she was named best lead actress in a limited series or movie for her work in the made-for-TV movie \"Playing for Time\" — and 2002. The English actress, who was born in London, won her second Emmy in the same category in 1991 for her work in the HBO made-for-TV movie \"If These Walls Could Talk 2.\"\n\n_\n\nIn 1996, the late, great Alan Rickman, who was born in London, took home the Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a limited series or movie for his performance as the titular Russian mystic in the HBO made-for-TV movie \"Rasputin.\" The English actor earned a second Emmy nomination in 2004 for his work in a different HBO made-for-TV movie: \"Something the Lord Made.\"\n\n_\n\nKiefer Sutherland — who was born in London to Canadian parents, actors Donald Sutherland and Shirley Douglas — won two Emmys in 2006 for his work on \"24,\" which was named outstanding drama series that year. (He was named outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his performance as Jack Bauer and picked up a second award for co-executive producing the popular FOX series.) All in all, Kiefer scored 11 Emmy nominations for \"24\" between 2002 and 2009."
