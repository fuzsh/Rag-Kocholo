If you lose somebody close to you, it's difficult to process sometimes and I thought actually, spending time in the garden just gave me space to remember him in a way that was active.\n\n\"I've been embracing failure. I've been enjoying putting it on my social media and I like to play a game of 'dead or not'. It looks like it's mainly a stick but maybe it'll come back to life. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. It doesn't matter if it works out or it doesn't. If you have a go with gardening, that's the joy of it and a lot of the time it's the way it makes you feel.\", he said.\n\nRob Beckett has hosted the BAFTAs with one of his other comedy best friends, Romesh Ranganathan an they have their own show Rob & Romesh Vs..., in which they try different activities.
