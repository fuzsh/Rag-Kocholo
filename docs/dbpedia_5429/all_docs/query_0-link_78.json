        "text": "It’s time to wrap up our four-part Bond retrospective in honor of the 50th anniversary of the James Bond films with a look at the two most recent actors to take on the role: Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig.\n\nAfter the disappointing performance of “License to Kill,” the Bond franchise went into a bit of a hibernation period. There were briefly plans to do a third film with Timothy Dalton, tentatively called “The Property of a Lady.” However, serious legal issues going all the way back to 1961 and the rights to “Thunderball” finally came to a head, effectively killing the project. By the time the ball started rolling again, Dalton was no longer interested in the role. Pierce Brosnan, who had come within an inch of being Bond in 1987, was called up once again, and eagerly jumped at the chance in 1994, and began to film the first of his outings, 1995’s “GoldenEye,” named for Ian Fleming’s old Jamaican home.\n\nBy this point, the Bond series had fallen into a sort of dated, formulaic pattern, punctuated by strangely campy moments that seemed both out of touch with modern audiences’ tastes, as well as Fleming’s original stories.\n\nAlso, in the interim, the Cold War had ended, ending the main dynamic the Bond films had centered on: the espionage-heavy era of an undeclared war fought in secret over decades. Suddenly, the world was a lot more peaceful, as well as a lot more complicated. And so it was decided that for this new Bond film, all of the old mistakes and stagnation would be jettisoned, including the wardrobe, starting completely from scratch. Enter Lindy Hemming.\n\nHemming, at that point best known for her work on “Four Weddings and a Funeral,” was a huge fan of Bond in her own right, having actually written her college thesis on Bond’s film wardrobe! The film’s producers wanted her for the job of Costume Designer almost immediately, and decided early on that unlike in earlier films, which featured a cornucopia of people making decisions on Bond’s clothing, only Hemming would be making decisions, making Bond’s entire wardrobe the product of one person’s taste.\n\nThe increased production quality for the series created a new hurdle. In earlier films, there was frequently only one copy of each suit for the film. Now, up to FIFTY suits would be necessary for the action scenes, for the sake of continuity. There was absolutely no way any of the small firms on Saville Row would be able to keep up. So Hemming turned to Italian firm Brioni, who had offered to give 50 suits to the production for free. The quality is certainly different. Brioni’s suits are tailor-made, but they are not bespoke. The day of the bespoke Bond was officially over, thanks to the needs of the modern action film. But c’est la vie, Bond must go on!\n\nFor all four Brosnan Bond films, Hemming settled on a system for dressing Brosnan, based around carefully planned and coordinated outfits. She is fond of unusual color combinations, like blue and brown with charcoal accents. She also is fond of three-piece suits, and of using the classic Brioni straight shoulder to good effect.\n\nIn 1997’s “Tomorrow Never Dies,” (originally titled “Tomorrow Never Lies,” which makes far more sense, but that’s another blog…) Hemming kept the same style, but added in an unusual 1930s touch to Bond’s dinner suit from early in the Hamburg portion of the film. Five buttons in a V-formation on the vest, strong shoulders and wide lapels are unusual indeed for a 1997 dinner suit.\n\nAlso in the film, a very interestingly atypical bronze tie/blue suit combo, with an overcoat matching the tie rather than the suit!\n\nContinuing into 1999’s “The World is Not Enough,” Brosnan’s look remained fairly consistent, which the major exception being one of the black-on-black suits Brosnan wears in his outings, a Cheviot tweed suit in charcoal, appropriate considering the character had just attended a funeral…\n\n…And a herringbone linen suit worn near the end of the film in Istanbul, which is absolutely bonkers for the dark tone of the scenes it appears in. A three-button fronted, four-button cuffed, with tan chorizo buttons, the suit otherwise has the typical Brioni lines.\n\nFinally for Brosnan, in 2002’s “Die Another Day,” his wardrobe stays the course, including the same one-button midnight blue peak lapel jacket that both the Brosnan and Craig Bonds pretty much always wear to formal engagements.\n\nWell… There was one out-of-nowhere outfit in “Die Another Day”…\n\n…But the less said about that, the better.\n\nAt this point, Brosnan retired from the series under slightly mysterious and acrimonious circumstances. Once again, life in the meantime had a way of influencing the direction the films would go next. The Jason Bourne series had effectively one-upped the bloated Bond franchise, showing a much more gritty and realistic look at espionage. And 2005’s “Batman Begins” showed that taking even the most iconic of characters deadly seriously could work wonders. The Bond producers chose Daniel Craig for the role of James Bond, deciding a very different-looking (blond!) actor was necessary for what would essentially be a reboot of the series.\n\nBehind the camera, however, the cast of characters remained mostly the same, including Lindy Hemming. But while she may have carried her basic sensibility with her, both Craig’s look and the gritty and deadly-realistic portrayal of the character he brought to the role invariably took Bond in a more rumpled, informal direction.\n\nHowever, 2006’s “Casino Royale” and 2008’s “Quantum of Solace” did provide plenty of opportunities for Bond to look his best in-between all the dressed-down action. Case in point, this great worsted wool suit in a subtle plaid of charcoal grey and navy blue.\n\nOr the now-iconic perfectly tailored dinner suit from “Casino Royale’s” poker scenes.\n\nOr, for that matter, an amazingly perfect, but updated, copy of Sean Connery’s dinner suit from “Dr. No.”\n\nAnd this slick charcoal suit from “Quantum of Solace.”\n\nThe Hollywood Writers’ Strike of 2008 threw a lot of the industry out of whack, and it took a few years for the Bond film series to get back on track, just in time for the 50th anniversary of “Dr. No” (and this blog!), with 2012’s “Skyfall.”\n\nWith “Skyfall,” a new costume designer was on board, Jany Temime, and Craig had gotten, somehow, even craggier and more gritty-looking in the meantime! Temime decided to go with Tom Ford on suits, and to bring back the more basic color scheme of the earlier Bond films, likely as part of the “everything old is new again” direction of the film in general. This includes this number, a glen plaid in mid grey and black.\n\nShe also added a true British icon to the film’s climax, the waxed cotton Barbour jacket…\n\nAnd, of course, the dinner suit for the film, a dark navy Tom Ford O’Connor outfit, very tightly fitted and a tad too short, deliberately, apparently, Temime said she was going for an “iconic for 2012” look.\n\nIn short, the lines and lapels of the suits in the film were very ’60s, but the cuts and the fits were very modern.\n\nAnd with that, we’ve caught up to the present. What does the future hold for everyone’s favorite bespoke superspy? Well, another film, for starters, already in pre-production, supposedly with Craig still on board. But whoever is holding the “shaken, not stirred” martinis, there are two things we can always count on: he will be dressed in gorgeous, tailored suits, and he will save the world in them.\n\nIt’s been several weeks, but it’s time to come back to James Bond style!\n\nWhen we last left off, Sean Connery had just come back to the world of James Bond for one more go with the poorly-received “Diamonds are Forever.” He had absolutely no intention of ever coming back to the role, at least at that point, and the producers took him at his word. Lazenby was back in Australia modelling, and the series desperately needed a shot of newness to get it back on track after such a disappointing entry. They went with someone who had come very close to getting the role back in 1962, Roger Moore.\n\nMoore was, unlike Connery and Lazenby, already an established actor in his own right before coming to the Bond franchise. What’s more, he had a pre-existing history as a jet-setting fictional spy, in th guise of Simon Templar of “The Saint,” a long-running BBC series based on a novel series of the same name. In essence, he was bringing an entire espionage-appropriate wardrobe with him to the role!\n\nMoore was cut from a cloth more similar to Lazenby rather than Connery. Simply put, Moore was pretty. He didn’t have the rough-hewn edges that Connery had, or even the boyish ruggedness that Lazenby possessed. Instead, Moore was prim, proper, and elegant. The Conduit Cut that had worked so well for a decade simply didn’t suit him. Instead, Moore went with his existing tailors at Cyril Castle in Mayfair. They had made the suits he had worn to great effect throughout his work on “The Saint,” and made similar suits for Moore’s first Bond outing, “Live and Let Die,” albeit with some slightly more 1970s lines and colors.\n\nIn a nod to his predecessors, Moore kept the distinctive turnback cuff shirts that Connery and Lazenby had worn, at least at first. Unfortunately, those only survived through Moore’s first two films, 1973’s “Live and Let Die,” and 1974’s “The Man with the Golden Gun.” In addition, there was a much more relaxed sense to Moore’s Bond, with more sports jackets and slacks than suits.\n\nThe first two Moore outings were unabashedly ’70s: minimalistic, car-focused and roughly filmed. Bond had come a long way away from the glamor of the ’60s films. They both performed poorly at the box office, and an extended absence was initiated, while the series returned to form. In 1977, Moore starred in “The Spy Who Loved Me,” a gargantuan, world-spanning production that also featured a much more formal set of clothes for Bond. The full trappings of the late ’70s showed up here…\n\n“The Spy Who Loved Me” remains the most popular of Moore’s Bond films, and 1979’s “Moonraker,” the highest grossing of his films, which had the same styles, along with some terrifying space-themed clothing…\n\n…So the styles that showed up here stayed associated with Moore’s Bond well after the fact. But here is where there was a serious change. Moore had, shall we say, some tax issues back in the United Kingdom, starting in 1978. He moved the the South of France in the interim, and could no longer make regular visits to Mayfair.\n\nThe timing of the forced change in style was fortuitous, as after the over-the-top entries of the ’70s, the series was about to take a sharp turn back into seriousness with 1981’s “For Your Eyes Only.” Moore sought out a tailor who was willing to come to his home in France: Douglas Hayward. Hayward already had a reputation as a tailor to the stars, as evidenced by his beautiful suits for Michael Caine, Laurence Olivier and Peter Sellers. His more subtle, subdued approach engineered a look for Bond that was so timeless, it lasted all the way into the ’90s, and doesn’t look particularly dated even today.\n\nThis continued through Moore’s last two films, 1983’s “Octopussy” and 1985’s “A View to a Kill.”\n\nAfter “A View to a Kill,” Moore was simply too old to keep doing the films, so the search for a new Bond was on. This switch in actors was easily the most tumultuous of the entire series, and ended with Pierce Brosnan, then of “Remington Steele,” getting the role… He was forced to turn it down, much to his horror, because of his commitment to “Remington Steele” (the same reason we have Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones instead of Tom Selleck, due to “Magnum, P.I.”). The producers were left scrambling, and settled on sort of dark horse choice in the form of Timothy Dalton, who had been approached back in 1969 for the role, but felt himself too young at the time. Dalton was a big fan of the Fleming novels, and wanted to take the character back to brutal basics. His two installments, 1987’s “The Living Daylights,” and 1989’s controversially violent “License to Kill,” remain some of the darkest, grimmest entries in the series. His wardrobe took a similar tack.\n\nHayward left the series with Moore, with whom he remained close friends until his death in 2008. Exactly who made the suits for the Dalton films is a bit of a melange, and was the result of the work of several different tailors. In the first half of “The Living Daylights,” Dalton dons several different Benjamin Simon suits.\n\nAfter around five of these, things go downhill from a sartorial perspective, and don’t come back up until 1995! Bond goes downright casual from here on, a reflection of the film’s chaotic, gritty tone, but also, apparently, Dalton’s discomfort with formal wear. It works in “The Living Daylights.” Terrifyingly, Dalton had to reign in the producers on “License to Kill.” The film centers on drug trafficking in Florida, the Caribbean and Central America. “Miami Vice” was popular at the time. You can probably guess where we’re going with this…\n\nOf Jodie Tillen, costume designer on “License to Kill,” Dalton had words…\n\n“She wanted to put me in pastels. Can you imagine? I thought, ‘No, we can’t have that.’ The clothes say so much about Bond. He’s got a naval background, so he needs a strong, simple color, like dark blue.” – Timothy Dalton, 1989\n\nWhile that disaster was averted, the film’s plot, featuring a renegade Bond out for revenge in the tropics, kept Dalton out of suits for nearly the entire film, excepting the horrendous “best man” suit he dons in the pre-title sequence (probably deliberately hideous), and a very, very average tux he wears to a casino midway through the film. It looks like a rental, which, again, makes sense in the context of the story (Bond has no resources, and is operating on his own and without a plan), but it’s still quite unfortunate to not get to see the finery we associate with the character in one of his films.\n\nLike we said, this sad state of affairs would not be corrected until 1995. Why so long? Well, that’s a story for next time, when we go into our fourth and final entry into our exploration of Bond’s wardrobe. Until next time!\n\nIt’s time to return to the world of spies and vodka martinis, “shaken, not stirred.” And just in time, too, because today marks the North American release of the 23rd official James Bond film, “Skyfall.” We’ll be first in line to see it!\n\nBut before we head on an adventure with Daniel Craig’s Bond, it’s time to take a trip to the past, to where we left off in the James Bond fashion chronology, all the way back to 1962. The process of bringing James Bond to the screen from the page was not an easy one, to say the least. We won’t go into the details here, it would take far too long. But the lasing legacy of the long process was the choice of Sean Connery as James Bond.\n\nAs we told you last time, Bond in the novels was a sort of portmanteau of Ian Fleming himself crossed with his former buddies in British Intelligence circles. When Fleming imagined Bond, he basically imagined a more dapper version of himself.\n\nThe film’s producers at first didn’t stray too far from the idea, wanting Cary Grant for the role. Grant, though, refused to sign a multi-picture deal, and the producers were banking on a franchise. They went through British actor Richard Johnson, Patrick McGoohan and David Niven, never able to reach consensus. They even ran a contest to choose bond, eventually settling on a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who was nowhere near prepared for the role. Legend has it they even considered future Bond Roger Moore, though he denies it.\n\nFinally, a scruffy, 30-year-old Scotsman in unpressed clothes came in to try out for the part, and absolutely oozed a macho, devil-may-care attitude. He didn’t look like the novel’s description, but he felt like the character, through-and-through. The producers knew on the spot that Sean Connery was their man.\n\nThere was, however, a problem. He had zero fashion sense, and was as sophisticated and cultured as a dump truck. Director Terence Young, himself a suave and debonair playboy of the highest order, took Connery under his wing, introducing him to the high life and high fashion of London. He took him to his own personal tailor, Anthony Sinclair, at 43 Conduit Street. The paired-down look of the suits Connery ended up wearing throughout his time as Bond became known as the “Conduit cut”: lightweight 100% wool in navy blue and shades of grey with a subtle check, “waisted” in a slimline, single-breasted, two-button format. The idea was for Bond to look well-dressed, but not stand out in a crowd, sound advice for a spy.\n\nConnery had never worn a suit for any length of time before, and was apparently insanely uncomfortable in one. So Young had Connery wear the suits CONSTANTLY, all day, every day, during pre-production, until they felt like a second skin to him.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Young turned Connery into a more gruff (and Scottish) version of himself, rather than of Fleming. This act has influenced the way Bond has been portrayed ever since, with tongue planted firmly in cheek, dark with a dash of humor, as opposed to the more brutal, cold-hearted version of the character from the books (although that’s come back a bit…more on that later). Bond became a fashion icon in his own right, now that his internal monologue was missing. Instead of commenting on what other people were wearing, he dressed to the nines himself, but then, so did his adversaries and allies.\n\nIn the first of Connery’s Bond films, 1962’s “Dr. No,” Bond informs CIA agent Felix Leiter that his suits were tailored in Savile Row, even though they were not, a slight nod to the books and to Fleming. The fashion in the first two films, “Dr. No” and 1963’s “From Russia With Love,” retains the basic look that Young gave Connery, all designed by Sinclair, and all accompanied by shirts from Turnbull & Asser.\n\nThe suits are remarkably simple, and, in fact, Bond never even dons a belt, so as to keep the sleek lines of the suits uninterrupted. The pants all sit at the waits, not the hip, another way to keep the lines more unified. Bond wears, almost exclusively, dark blue grenadine ties for the entire films. He frequently wears a white linen pocket square, neatly folded into the front of his jackets. And, hilariously, despite Bond’s hatred of Windsor knots, he wears them in “Dr. No,” before properly shifting to four-in-hand knots from “From Russia With Love” on.\n\nInterestingly, the suits in the first two films are more timeless than suits in the films that followed. They could all be easily worn today. The next three films, 1964’s “Goldfinger,” 1965’s “Thunderball” and 1967’s “You Only Live Twice,” all featured far narrower lapels, muted browns, and old-fashioned three-piece cuts, all very, very ’60s, though we do mean that in a good way.\n\nRumor has it that some American tailors were used in “Goldfinger,” which makes sense, since more fashionable (for the time) details like pageboy waistcoats suddenly show up. The number of materials and colors also expands dramatically. But the basic cut remains the same, until the next film in the series, 1969’s “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.”\n\nOHMSS brought in not just new fashion, but a new Bond, in the form of Australian model George Lazenby, after Sean Connery declined to return for a sixth, extra contractual film. Peter Hunt, director of OHMSS, was a fashion-conscious gentleman in his own right, and was given broad leeway in the way this new Bond would be presented, using his own favorite tailor, Dimi Major of Fulham, London W1. Possibly because of Lazenby’s more “pretty” look, and experience as a model, as well as acknowledgement of the more brazen and colorful styles that had come to dominate fashion in the seven years since “Dr. No,” Bond was given a much larger and more colorful wardrobe. A modified version of the “Conduit cut” from prior films was still used in the London scenes, but unlike before, Bond wore more than that sleek, simple cut when out of the glare of MI6, even wearing an astonishing cream-colored suit at one point. Did we mention the ruffles?\n\nBut come 1971, Connery came back for one more Bond, “Diamonds Are Forever.” The film is a bit of a wacky outlier for the Bond series, and even though Connery brought the more muted styles and colors of his films back with him (likely along with tailor Anthony Sinclair), some of the OHMSS style remained, likely a result of the American side of the production not collaborating with the English side completely. Connery even wears a cream-colored suit himself, at one point. And even the muted, London suits are slightly changed, with the wider lapels of the ’70s making their appearance felt.\n\nThis brings us to the end of Connery’s tenure, until his brief return with the unofficial “Never Say Never Again” in 1983. Roger Moore and excesses of the ’70s are next, and we’ll pick up there in Part 3. Until next time…\n\nToday, October 5th, 2012, is the 50th anniversary of everybody’s favorite superspy action movies: the James Bond series! On October 5th, 1962, “Dr. No” premiered in the United Kingdom, and introduced the world to the words “Bond, James Bond.” Along the way, the films also introduced the world to the finer things in life, from exotic locales and fine dining, to the best drinks money could buy and absurdly elaborate underground volcano lairs.\n\nBut, from our point of view, most importantly, they introduced the world to the idea of men dressing to the nines while still being tough. Before Bond, really, suits and tuxes were primarily something you wore to a formal event or to work. Bond wears tailor-made suits while dangling from helicopters by his feet with a nuclear bomb in one hand and a gorgeous Russian spy in the other.\n\nSo, what better reason to spend the next few months celebrating all things Bond fashion? And we’re going to start right at the beginning…\n\nBefore Bond, action heroes were cowboys or soldiers or spacemen. The bad guys were usually the ones dressed well, no doubt thanks to their ill-gotten gains! Only private detectives were shown wearing suits while doing good, but they were usually of the rumpled, dirty, cheap knock-off variety. Humphrey Bogart looked amazing in them, but hardly anyone else did. Then along came Bond and his impeccable fashion sense, which, believe us, was no accident, it was because it was what his creator would have worn.\n\nBond was the invention of former British intelligence officer, commando, journalist, and all-around badass, Ian Fleming. Fleming had spent World War II coming up with intelligence operations with names like “Operation Ruthless,” “Operation Mincemeat” and “Operation Golden Eye,” then put together a crack commando unit called “30AU,” and another crack commando unit called, we swear, “T-Force.”\n\nIn the midst of all of this, he was heavily involved with something called the “Special Operations Executive,” essentially the precursor to every single acronym-based-name-bearing espionage organization from every genre film, TV show, book or video game you’ve ever seen. They were based on Baker Street in London, down the street from where Sherlock Holmes was supposed to have lived, and completely revolutionized intelligence and espionage. Did we mention that one of their operatives was one Sir Christopher Frank Carandini Lee?\n\nThat’s right, the creator of James Bond spent most of World War II coming up with incredibly colorful ways to kill and generally mess up Nazis alongside freaking Saruman himself in Sherlock Holmes’ old stomping grounds. Suffice to say, this had a profound impact on him.\n\nAfter the war, he began to write Casino Royale, the first Bond novel, and nearly all of the initial Bond characters, including M, Q, Miss Moneypenny and Vesper Lynd, were all based on people whom Fleming had worked with in the SOE. Bond himself, on the other hand, was an amalgamation of several different spies from the SOE, along with Fleming himself…\n\nFleming had very, very refined taste in clothes, having grown up in Mayfair, one of the most moneyed neighborhoods in London, as the son of a British MP and a wealthy socialite. Legend has it he could identify a tailor from the cut of a man’s suit! These tastes, along with his, ah, extremely intense interest in women, food, liquor and cigarettes, got transferred to the James Bond character, a fact which worked as a fabulous antidote to the Post-War austerity Britain found itself in. Fleming himself heavily favored lightweight suits, an anomaly in his time, and tended to skew towards blues and greys with pinstripes in all manner of arrangements, both single and double breasted as well as both two and three-piece. Bond himself is described in this manner throughout the books, but, interestingly, no labels are mentioned.\n\n“The girl looked him up and down. He had dark, rather cruel good looks and very clear, blue-grey eyes. He was wearing a very dark-blue lightweight single-breasted suit over a cream silk shirt and a black knitted silk tie. Despite the heat, he looked cool and clean. ‘And who might you be?’ she asked sharply.\n\n‘My name’s Bond, James Bond …'” –Thunderball\n\nSavile Row fashion is heavily implied (though Fleming himself didn’t care for it), but never named. What is named is what everyone else is wearing. In fact, as anyone who has read the books can tell you, Bond CAN’T STOP talking about people’s clothes.\n\n“It was tied with a Windsor knot. Bond mistrusted anyone who tied his tie with a Windsor knot. It showed too much vanity. It was often the mark of a cad.” –From Russia With Love\n\nHe actually sizes up some of his archenemies in this manner. For instance, he immediately notices, in Moonraker, that villain Hugo Drax’s cufflinks are Cartier.\n\nBut Bond’s own clothing in the books remains a mystery (although it has been suggested that Bond’s suits were from Anderson & Sheppard of Sevile Row, though that makes little sense). But then, so was Bond himself. The Bond of the novels is dark, and downright humorless. His high-minded fashion sense is more an engine of his distaste for other people wearing something wrong rather than pride in himself for wearing something right, likely an idiosyncrasy belonging to Fleming.\n\nThe novels began to be published in 1953 with Casino Royale, and by the time “Dr. No” came into theaters in 1962, 9 years, 10 books and an episode of the CBS anthology series “Climax!” that adapted Casino Royale had elapsed.\n\nAfter all of that, one would think that Bond’s fashion sense would have been locked in. …Not exactly. Elements, like the lightweight suits, were, but the overall style, as we said, had not been heavily touched on. That iconic look that everyone thinks of came from Terence Young, who directed “Dr. No,” and dressed the rather rough and tumble unknown Scotsman Sean Connery in what he thought Fleming’s style should be, by way of his own style.\n\nBut that’s a story for next time. We’ll continue with the next installment, focusing on the all-important Sean Connery years of Bond-dom, after a brief detour…"
