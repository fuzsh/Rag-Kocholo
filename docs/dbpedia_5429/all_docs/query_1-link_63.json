        "text": "Timothy Dalton`s incarnation of James Bond deserves better recognition than he gets.\n\nPortraying the British spy on two occasions, his films did not receive the cultural recognition that many of his Bondian counterparts got.\n\nOften unfairly criticised by some critics, Dalton was frequently called miscast. These criticisms are completely arbitrary and misguided.Dalton stands heads and shoulders over the other Bond actors and revitalised the Bond serieswith his terrific portrayal.\n\nWhat made him the best? First of all, Dalton`s acting credentials have been unbeatable. The finest thespian to play Bond to date, Timothy Dalton made his name as a Shakespearian stage actor in the sixties. On screen, he held his own in The Lion in Winter (1968), Wuthering Heights (1970), Mary, Queen of Scots (1972) and Permission to Kill (1975). Other celebrated parts include a starring role in Hawks, the film version of Jane Eyre, the stage version of Northern Lights and as Rhett Butler in the television drama Scarlett.\n\nDalton had a penchant to play villains also, as evident in his scene stealing turns in Flash Gordon and Hot Fuzz, giving him the perfect ammunition to play James Bond as an anti-hero when offered the part in 1986.\n\nA trained actor as opposed to a Hollywood star; Dalton was perfect for the role.\n\nOut of the six Bonds, it is Dalton who Ian Fleming would almost certainly have been happiest with.Dark haired, tall and thin, Dalton was very similar in appearance to the character described in the\n\nbooks (the same cannot be said about the fair haired Roger Moore, the blocky Sean Connery or the short, blonde haired Daniel Craig). Making the conscious decision not to imitate Sean Connery, Roger Moore or\n\nGeorge Lazenby Dalton studied the James Bond that was described in Ian Fleming`s\n\nnovels.\n\nA fan of the books, as well as Sean Connery`s first three outings, Dalton wanted to play the character in a grittier manner than previously seen. Dalton even looked after the minor details, such as the literary Bond`s excessive smoking habit.\n\nAlthough Daniel Craig is frequently credited with being\n\nthe first “serious” Bond, it was Dalton who first played James Bond as a no nonsense spy. And he played the part so much better than Craig did!\n\nEnthusiastic about the role, Dalton threw himself into the stunt work. Dalton clung to land rovers,hung off dangerous cliffs and jumped over Moroccan building tops over the course of his two films.\n\nThis gave his films a realistic thrill that was not seen in many of the Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan films and the chase in Tangiers featured in The Living Daylights is rumoured to have inspired a similar one in The Bourne Ultimatum (2008).\n\nWhen dressing himself, Dalton looked smart in suits and\n\navoided wearing the embarrassing kilts and safari suits worn by George Lazenby and Roger Moore respectively.\n\nAmongst other pros he was, arguably, the handsomest to play the part to date, reinstating\n\na sex appeal that had been absent from the films since Connery.\n\nBut what was so special about his portrayal? What makes his Bond more impressive than the rest?\n\nSimply put, Dalton re-imagined Bond in a more radical manner than his predecessors or successors.\n\nInstead of consorting in clown suits, Dalton`s Bond was a credible assassin whose dark portrayal makes for intense viewing. Playing James Bond as if he were a real character, Dalton paid less attention to the clichéd quips in favour of aggressive responses. Telling MI6 operatives to stuff their\n\norders, and others to “piss off”, Dalton made Bond more human. Dalton`s Bond was one who disobeyed his orders, questioned needless killing and made him more three dimensional.\n\nIf it was not for Dalton, it is unlikely that Brosnan`s Bond or Craig`s Bond would have spoken about their professions so frankly in Goldeneye and Casino Royale respectively.\n\nDalton`s Bond was a more\n\nmodern man, less chauvinistic and more of a feminine egalitarian than his predecessors (a tradition\n\nwhich may have led to Judi Dench being cast as M in the nineties).\n\nAs for humour? Dalton`s Bond\n\nwas less obvious about it.\n\nEschewing eye brow raising puns for lines of greater sustenance. His\n\nmarginality of quips made them funnier when he did eventually state them.\n\nLess is Moore, as they\n\nsay!\n\nhat was the greatest disappointment of the series?\n\nIt was that Dalton did not get to make more films\n\nthan he did.\n\nTwo outings do not suffice.\n\nDalton should have made a third, but lost the chance due to\n\nongoing legal implications between EON and MGM.\n\nHad he gotten the chance, he would very likely\n\nbe remembered as the best Bond.\n\nHow do his films fare up? The Living Daylights (1987) is one of\n\nthe best in the series, and should rank in the top five.\n\nLicence To Kill (1989) is not as strong, but it\n\nshould be credited for being one of the more original in the series.\n\nAll in all, the films were graced\n\nwith a superb actor who brought a depth to the character that revitalised the series.\n\nNobody does it\n\nbetter than Dalton!"
