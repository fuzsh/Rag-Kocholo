Have I Got News For You will regularly air Saturdays at 9pm ET/PT and will be available to stream on Max the following day.\n\n“For far too long immigrants have been coming to America and taking black jobs, kudos to CNN and the immigrants at Hat Trick Productions for bringing a Black job to the States,” said Wood Jr. “It is an honor to be a part of such a hallowed British institution to help make sense of the American institutions of chaos, name calling, disinformation, reality television and the 8-hour news cycle.”\n\nProduced by Hat Trick Productions since 1990, Have I Got News for You is an institution in Britain and now it’s invading America. This comedy panel series delivers comic observations, from the satirical to the surreal, through the lens of a news quiz show that tests the knowledge of rotating collection of guests including notable entertainers, political figures and comedians.

He served for eight years as a correspondent on Comedy Central’s Emmy-winning The Daily Show (2015-2023).

Wood will appear alongside Keanu Reeves and Jonah Hill in the upcoming AppleTV comedy Outcome and recently partnered with Crown Publishing to pen a memoir, The Man of Many Fathers, which will be released in 2025. Wood most recently was seen alongside Jon Hamm in Paramount Pictures’ Confess, Fletch (2022) and has guest appearances in Only Murders in the Building, Better Call Saul, and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.\n\nExecutive Producers for the American version of Have I Got News For You are Jimmy Mulville, Richard Wilson and Jim Biederman.\n\nHave I Got News For You will stream live for pay TV subscribers via CNN.com, CNN connected TV and mobile apps on Saturday, September 14.
