Casper and the Angels is a 30-minute Saturday morning animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that aired for one season (1979â€“80) on NBC. Casper the Friendly Ghost was a guardian angel for two female motorcycle space cops named Minnie (who was rather ditzy and had a Southern accent) and Maxie (who was a much more intelligent African-American woman) in the year 2179. They were joined by a rambunctious ghost named Hairy Scary, who would scare villains and troublemakers, but unlike most other ghosts, was accepting of the fact that Casper was a gentle ghost who did not like to scare people. The show was apparently Hanna-Barbera's second attempt to cash in on the popularity of Charlie's Angels, the first being Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels (Laurel Page also provided a voice for that show).

Twenty-six 15-minute segments shown as thirteen 30-minute episodes were produced, as well as two 1979 television specials: Casper's Halloween Special and Casper's First Christmas. The series also aired in reruns on USA Network during the 1980s and early 1990s, Cartoon Network from 1992-2005 and Boomerang from 2000-2004.
