        "text": "Casper and the Angels is a 30-minute Saturday morning animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that aired for one season (1979–80) on NBC. Casper the Friendly Ghost was a guardian angel for two female motorcycle space cops named Minnie (who was rather ditzy and had a Southern accent) and Maxie (who was a much more intelligent African-American woman) in the year 2179. They were joined by a rambunctious ghost named Hairy Scary, who would scare villains and troublemakers, but unlike most other ghosts, was accepting of the fact that Casper was a gentle ghost who did not like to scare people. The show was apparently Hanna-Barbera's second attempt to cash in on the popularity of Charlie's Angels, the first being Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels (Laurel Page also provided a voice for that show).\n\nTwenty-six 15-minute segments shown as thirteen 30-minute episodes were produced, as well as two 1979 television specials: Casper's Halloween Special and Casper's First Christmas. The series also aired in reruns on USA Network during the 1980s and early 1990s, Cartoon Network from 1992-2005 and Boomerang from 2000-2004.\n\nOverview[]\n\nThe series is set in 2179 where Casper helps out policewomen Mini & Maxi on baffling cases (2 segments per episode). Hairy Scary was there to convince Casper to scare people! Casper & Hairy Scary had two NBC specials as well. A Halloween special where Hairy Scary & his friends ruin Halloween for Casper & his new orphan friends. And a Christmas special that featured Yogi & the gang taking shelter @ their haunted house.\n\nCast[]\n\nJulie McWhirter - Casper\n\nDiana McCannon - Space Patrol Officer Maxie\n\nLaurel Page - Space Patrol Officer Minnie\n\nJohn Stephenson - Harry Scary, Commander\n\nEpisodes[]\n\n1. \"Casper's Golden Chance / Space Circus\"\n\n2. \"Casper Ghosts West / Casper's Camp Out\"\n\n3. \"Strike Four / The Space Pirate\"\n\n4. \"Ship-Wrecked / The Cat Burglar\"\n\n5. \"Something Fishy / The Smiling Lisa\"\n\n6. \"A Pocket Full O'Schemes / A Tale of Two Trashmen\"\n\n7. \"Fatula / T.V. or Not T.V.\"\n\n8. \"Gone to the Dogs / Private Eyeball to Eyeball\"\n\n9. \"Champ for a Day / The Ghost Robbers\"\n\n10. \"Aunt Mary Scarey / The Ice Heist\"\n\n11. \"A Shoplifting Experience / The Impossible Scream\"\n\n12. \"Prehistoric Hi-Jinx / The Commander Is Missing\"\n\n13. \"Love at First Fright / Saving Grace in Outer Space\"\n\nHome Release[]\n\nOn September 5, 1996, Turner Home Entertainment released \"Casper: Stars & Frights\" on VHS.
