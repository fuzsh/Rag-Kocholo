Casper the Friendly Ghost was created in the late 1930s by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo as the basis for a children's storybook. Oriolo sold the rights to the book to Paramount Pictures for $175 before it was published. The first Casper cartoon was released in 1945. In it, Casper is a ghost child who wants to make friends with humans and animals but scares them away until he meets two children. Later Casper cartoons from the 1950s followed a similar formula where Casper would try to find friends but scare others until helping a child or person, gaining their acceptance. The Casper series was popular but later criticized for its repetitive story structure.",
