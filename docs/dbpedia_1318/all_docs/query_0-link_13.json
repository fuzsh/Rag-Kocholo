        "text": "JIM HENSON’S LITTLE MUPPET MONSTERS\n\n(CBS, September 14-September 28, 1985)\n\nHenson Associates, Marvel Productions\n\nMAIN CAST:\n\nMuppets:\n\nCheryl Blalock – Cow, Raggmopp\n\nJim Kroupa – Nicky Napoleon\n\nKathryn Mullen – Penguin, Rat\n\nMartin P. Robinson – Rat, Cow, Walrus\n\nAnimated:\n\nFrank Welker – Kermit, Chicken Who Crossed the Road, Banana Nose Maldonado, Milo Sockdrawer\n\nHal Rayle – Animal, Gonzo, Miss Piggy\n\nLittle Muppet Monsters was a show that combined traditional puppetry with animated segments. Or, that was the plan, anyway.\n\nMichael Frith's design for Molly.\n\nFollowing the unexpected success of Muppet Babies, CBS decided to try and expand on that by having Henson Associates and Marvel Productions create another series they could use to make a one-hour programming block. Jim Henson and Babies executive producer, Michael Frith, came up with an idea that would allow them to make use of the classic Muppets in occasional appearances with the conclusion of The Muppet Show while also complimenting the themes of imagination and creativity Babies was meant to encourage. Frith served as the creative producer and conceptual designer, coming up with the new character designs.\n\nThe monsters (from top): Tug, Boo and Molly.\n\nThe series centered on three new characters: Tug (Richard Hunt), Boo (David Rudman) and Molly (Camille Bonora). They were monsters sent to play in the basement of the Muppets’ building by Scooter (Hunt) in order to keep them out of trouble (initially, Kermit was meant to be the main Muppet contact, but Scooter was chosen since he was also played by Hunt and Henson would be largely unavailable to play Kermit due to commitments overseas). They discovered props from the Muppet Show days that would allow them to broadcast their own show in a similar format, albeit only to the house above. The idea for the show was borne from the advent of the hand-held video camera. They felt that device would allow anyone, especially kids, to be able to express their creativity on television and, in a few years down the line, allow them to shift into the professional aspect of the medium (a prediction that ultimately would come true with the rise of the internet and sites like YouTube and Tik Tok). Where Babies was meant to encourage imaginative play, Monsters was meant to encourage hands-on creativity.\n\nModel sheet of the animated Muppet characters.\n\nThe monsters produced episodes of their show with the help of their in-house band, Nicky Napoleon and his Emperor Penguins (a group of penguins that broke into the basement and lived there), and sometimes the adult Muppets themselves. What would follow would be shows within the show, with animated segments provided by Marvel such as “Pigs in Space”, a parody of space programs starring Miss Piggy (Hal Rayle) that originated on The Muppet Show; “Kermit the Frog, Private Eye”, where Kermit (Frank Welker) and Fozzie (Greg Berg) parodied mystery movies; “Muppet Sports Shorts”, which saw Animal (Rayle) performing various athletic feats; and “Muppet Labs”, with Dr. Bunsen Honeydew (Bob Egen) and Beaker (Hunt) performing feats of science. Recurring Muppet segments were “Fozzie’s Comedy Corner”, with Fozzie (Frank Oz) discussing jokes and Gonzo (Dave Goelz) presenting a variety of weird things. Each episode featured an original song bringing everything together.\n\nMolly and Tug with Nicky by their transmission device.\n\nJim Henson’s Little Muppet Monsters debuted on September 14, 1985 as part of the program block called Jim Henson’s Muppets, Babies & Monsters. The show was introduced the night before on CBS’ Saturday morning preview special, All-Star Rock ‘N’ Wrestling Saturday Spectacular, by Pee-wee Herman and Rowdy Roddy Piper. A scene from an unaired episode was shown, as well as alternate takes of ones that were aired. The series was written by David Babcock, Sarah Durkee, Chris Grabenstein, Bradley Kesden, Steve Morgenstern, Kathryn Mullen and Julia Murray, with consultation on the animated segments by Chuck Lorre, Barry O’Brien, Jack Mendelsohn and Bob Smith. Rick Merwin and Hank Saroyan served as story editors. The music was composed by Robert J. Walsh, with songs by Alan O’Day, Janis Liebhart, Scott Brownlee, Michael Carney, Michael Carroll, Joe Carroll, Christopher Cerf, Kevin Joy and Durkee. The series’ theme was a mash-up of the Babies and Monsters themes.\n\nBunsen and his latest invention.\n\nUnfortunately, Little Muppet Monsters didn’t get much of a chance to see if Henson and Marvel could duplicate Babies’ success. Because of the tight timeframe both studios had to produce the program for airing in the upcoming season, the idea was not properly fine-tuned to ensure the concept would gel together. Many on Henson’s staff felt that the superior puppet work overshadowed the comparatively inferior animation; the quality of which varied from piece to piece due to translation issues with Toei Animation and the overall rushed nature of the project. While Henson’s crew managed to produce 18-episodes’ worth of Muppet sketches, Marvel was unable to provide the animated segments in a timely fashion as their resources were stretched thin working on Babies simultaneously. Marvel also had to serve as a mediator between Henson Associates and CBS as the network became more involved with the production over concerns with the scripts they saw. Had Marvel been able to provide the animation quicker, attempts would have been made to have the puppet and animated segments interact with each other; such as having puppet Kermit rewrite the mysteries his animated counterpart was in, or by having Boo argue with the space pigs on where to place a cliffhanger.\n\nThe continuing adventures of Pigs in Space.\n\nOnly three episodes were ready to air by the planned debut date. Henson, feeling the show failed to meet his high standards, ultimately decided to pull it after the third and final episode, conceding with the network that the concept wasn’t as well thought out as it could have been. It was replaced in the block by a rerun of Babies. When the ratings exploded for the hour after that move, CBS decided to ditch Monsters entirely, leaving the remaining episodes unfinished and the completed episodes were never broadcast again. The concept of a combined puppet/animation show was more successfully revisited by Henson’s company in 1992 with the airing of Dog City.\n\nHenson newsletter talking about the show.\n\nGhosts of Little Muppet Monsters remained. An instrumental version of the show’s theme song served as the closing credits theme of Babies until that series’ conclusion. The monsters made an appearance in the special The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years broadcast on CBS that January. The special was filmed before Monsters was cancelled and plugged the new show. Animation from the Kermit segment was reused in the final episode of Babies, providing that show with a single line of dialogue uttered by Henson himself. Tug appeared in the introduction of The Muppets at Walt Disney World, a special designed to build awareness at the then-upcoming Disney acquisition of Henson’s company, mauling then-Disney head Michael Eisner. The penguin band was featured in the Disney World attraction Muppet*Vision 3D. All three monsters were later reused in various Henson projects as a variety of different characters.\n\nThe sole piece of released merchandise for the show.\n\nAccording to the Henson newsletter, a wave of merchandise based on the show was set to debut at Toy Fair 1986. Amongst them were a plush by Hasbro, board games and puzzles by Milton Bradley, puzzles by Playskool, costumes by Ben Cooper, stickers by Diamond Toy, balloons by Balloon Concepts, clothing by Allison Manufacturing, greeting cards by Hallmark, belts by Lee Belts, pajamas by PCA Apparel, and party supplies by Beach Producers. Only a Playskool puzzle ever saw release in limited quantities. There has been no indication of any intention to ever finish or release the remaining episodes of the series. In 2015, puppet segments from the episodes “Foo-Foo Phooey”, “Gunko” and “Gonzo’s Talent Hunt” were leaked onto the internet. Each one is missing some scenes and their respective animated segments, and run just over a half hour in total.

We’ve all had them. Any time something weighed on our minds. Any time we were anxious about something. Or maybe just because you decided to eat that ice cream, pickle and pepperoni combination too late at night. Whatever the reason, nightmares are a scary part of going to sleep. And one company sought to turn it into a franchise.\n\nCreative Capers Entertainment is a creative thinktank formed in 1989 by Terry & Sue Shakespeare and David Molina that specializes in Flash and hand-drawn animation for a variety of different kinds of productions. Terry, having worked for Sullivan Bluth Studios, was able to use his connections to secure some of the top talent from Bluth and develop a relationship with Disney. They provided uncredited additional animation for Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King, as well as worked extensively on games published by Disney Interactive.\n\nDisney was looking to break into the growing PC game market and tasked the studio with crafting a new IP that they could exploit. One that wasn’t just based on a previous Disney film and could attract some of the older gamers. The resulting game was Nightmare Ned, created by Walt Dohrn.\n\nThe weird world inside Ned's head.\n\nNightmare Ned focused on Ned Needlemeyer (Courtland Mead), a pre-teen with anxiety to spare. The game found Ned learning his family would be out of the house for a while, so he indulges in some junk food binging and video games until a storm knocks out the power. Ned believes someone’s in the house with him but writes it off as his anxiety flaring up. But, it turns out five fear-eating shadow creatures are there to feed on his dreams when he goes to sleep. They rule over five distinct worlds: the Graveyard, the Hospital/Dentist’s Office, the Bathroom, the School and the Attic/Basement. The game was rendered in a variety of different styles--hand drawn, stop-motion, painted backgrounds, collages and 3D computer animation—in order to effectively create a nightmarish world for Ned to navigate.\n\nBoss fight!\n\nThe object of the game was to travel to each world and solve the puzzles within the span of 8 game hours, or the length of time Ned would be asleep. Ned would lose time whenever he took too many hits, or a whole hour whenever he returned to his quilt which was possessed by the entities and served as a hub between the levels. Accomplishing this would have Ned learn the true, real-life anxiety that would fuel the entities, allowing him to confront and overcome that particular fear. Finishing within the allotted time led to receiving the “good” ending, where Ned was a bit surer of himself and felt loved. The “bad” ending saw Ned as even more of a wreck than when he started.\n\nVernon and Conrad, typical bullies.\n\nDuring development of the game, Disney saw potential in Nightmare Ned and decided to adapt it into an animated series for their new Disney’s One Saturday Morning programming block. Developed, produced and directed by Donovan Cook, the animated Ned took a departure from the game. His family, only briefly seen in the game, was featured more prominently in the show. There was his father, Ed (Brad Garrett), his unnamed mother (Victoria Jackson), and little baby sister. Ned (still Mead) also gained two bullies that constantly harassed him: the crown-wearing Conrad (Jeff Bennet) and the big-nosed Vernon (Rob Paulsen).\n\nNed becomes a girl who wants to be recognized as a boy.\n\nThere were no supernatural entities to be found to fuel Ned’s nightmares. Instead, an event in Ned’s real life would cause his anxiety to activate his wild imagination, leading to a bizarre nightmare related to whatever the incident was indicated by a swirl after Ned fell asleep. For instance, wanting to adopt a pet pig but discovering that his favorite food, Canadian bacon, was made from pigs, led to a nightmare where Ned ran away to live with the pig’s family only to realize they were fattening him up to eat him. Another saw Conrad and Vernon trick Ned into using the girl’s bathroom at school, leading to a nightmare where Ned became a girl. Or, when Conrad and Vernon managed to sneak dog food into Ned’s food, he dreamt that he was transformed into a dog. Each nightmare ended with Ned waking up with a start, and usually helped lead him to a solution for whatever his difficulty was. Each episode served to address a typical fear and anxiety experienced by young children that often wasn’t addressed by other programs.\n\nNightmare Ned began on April 19, 1997 on ABC (coincidentally coinciding with Mead’s 10th birthday). Produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, the animated Ned abandoned all the different visual styles seen in the game, which released a short time later that June, and focused on straightforward hand animation. Each episode was broken up into two segments written by Mitch Watson, Mike Bell, Peter Gaffney and Ralph Soll, with Gaffney and Gary Sperling serving as story editors. Steve Bartek composed the music. Dohrn also served as a director and storyboard artist on the show, while the Creative founders functioned as executive producers.\n\nProbed by aliens.\n\nAfter Ned aired its twelve completed episodes by August, the series disappeared entirely from the airwaves. Unlike other Disney programs, especially ones created during that time period, it was never rerun on any of the Disney-owned cable networks. Several unproven explanations have been given for this cancellation. Allegedly, the series was running over budget and Disney wasn’t seeing enough of a return on their investment in it to continue. Another explanation was there were creative conflicts between Cook and Dohrn, which contributed to the budget problem. Further, despite it being extremely toned down in comparison to the game, the content and subject matter raised the ire of parents who complained to Disney and the network.\n\nThe Tooth Fairy up to no good.\n\nBecause of its sudden departure and abandonment by Disney, the show has gone on to gain a bit of a cult status and following. It was all but forgotten until old VHS recordings of the series were found and began appearing on streaming services like YouTube. As of this writing, one segment and one episode remain missing, and the third episode is allegedly not available in English.\n\nEPISODE GUIDE:\n\n“Ned’s Life as a Dog / A Doll’s House” (4/19/97) – Ned dreams he becomes a dog after eating dog food. / Ned becomes a doll after the girls dress him up.\n\n“Robot Ned / Dapper Dan” (4/26/97) – Possessing a robot toy sees Ned become a robot himself. / Forgetting all of his clothes leads Ned to being tortured in various ways by Conrad and Vernon.\n\n“Monster Ned / The Ants” (5/3/97) – Ned becomes a giant kaiju. / Ned and his father end up trapped on an ant farm.\n\n“Magic Bus / Until Undeath Do Us Part” (5/10/97) – A puppet drives the scary bus Ned finds himself on. / After Ned sees a horror movie in the theater, zombies begin to rise from their graves.\n\n“Headless Lester / My, How You’ve Grown” (5/17/97) – Ned’s camp counselor relays the scary story of a headless man who came to the camp. / Ned begins to grow older quickly.\n\n“Tooth or Consequences / Show Me the Infidel” (5/24/97) – Ned travels to a world full of lost teeth and confronts the Tooth Fairy. / Ned falls off a ride at the amusement park and ends up in a cave with goblins.\n\n“Willie Trout / House of Games” (5/31/97) – A fishing trip puts Ned in a position to be bait for a giant trout. / Everything in Ned’s house comes to life.\n\n“Girl Trouble / Canadian Bacon” (6/7/97) – Conrad and Vernon trick Ned into using the girls’ bathroom and he actually becomes a girl. / Ned wants to adopt a pet pig until he realizes that his favorite food is Canadian bacon.\n\n“Abduction / Bad Report Card” (6/14/97) – Aliens abduct cows to put mustaches on them, including Ned who wears a cow costume. / Ned’s world comes crashing down when he gets a failing report card.\n\n“Testing...Testing… / The Accordion Lesson” (6/21/97) – NO SYNOPSIS AVAILABLE.\n\n“Along for the Ride / Steamed Vegetables” (6/28/97) – Ned is dragged along on a long, boring family road trip. / Ned is nervous about appearing in the school play.\n\n“Lucky Abe (One Cent Ned) / The Dentist / The Ballad of Vernon & Conrad” (8/9/97) – Trying to learn a magic trick leads Ned to swallowing the family’s lucky penny. / NO SYNOPSIS AVAILABLE. / NO SYNOPSIS AVAILABLE."
