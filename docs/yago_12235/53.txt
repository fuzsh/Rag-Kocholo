For those who dream of getting their child into the film industry, Kids Create Movies is launching 2017 with a brand new series of acting jobs for children.

For “Peitruss”, the next feature-length film by Max Jacoby (“Dust”, 2009), produced by Samsa Film, and to be shot in spring/summer 2017, Kids Create Movies is looking for children and adolescents aged from 4 to 18 years old, representing all possible nationalities. The participation will be remunerated, not to mention the value of the shooting experience being worth a try.

The children do not have to have any language skills in Luxembourgish, nor any acting experience, but of course both of these will be considered a plus. That is why they firstly give priority to the "2030, WHEN i GROW UP" participants, as they have already experienced being in front of / behind the camera.

To all parents, whose children have participated in "2030, WHEN i GROW UP" workshops, please send a short “hello” to hello@andramariamatresu.com. To all the other parents interested, please post in the Comments Section of their Facebook Post the word “INTERESTED” - ideally with two recent pictures of your child. Somebody from the team will contact you asap to ask for more information.
