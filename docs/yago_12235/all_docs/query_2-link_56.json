        "text": "It looks like an impressive new era of video game adaptation continues in the entertainment industry. This time, the Just Cause movie is now in the works, and it’s drawing an impressive pedigree of talent behind the camera. Per The Hollywood Reporter, the upcoming video game adaptation has drawn Blue Beetle filmmaker Ángel Manuel Soto to helm the project.\n\nRELATED: BoxLunch x David Harbour: A New Harmonious Partnership for a Noble Cause Just In Time For the 2023 Holidays\n\nWhat’s more? Kelly McCormick and David Leitch, of John Wick and The Fall Guy fame, will produce the film through their 87North production banner. They definitely appear to be the right team to shepherd the project, considering Just Cause is an incredibly action-packed, action-heavy game series, along with Leitch’s own filmmaking experience with action-heavy material.\n\nJUST CAUSE LIVE-ACTION MOVIE GETS IMPRESSIVE PRODUCTION TEAM\n\nThe film is currently set up at Universal Pictures. 87North currently has a first-look deal with the studio. Just Cause debuted its first game series from Avalanche Studios back in 2006, published by Eidos Interactive. Its subsequent entries, Just Cause 2-4, were published by Square Enix.\n\nDmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg, and Timothy I. Stevenson of Story Kitchen are also attached to produce the film. The same production team is also attached to other video game adaptations, such as Tomb Raider and Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nAlso producing are Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson of Story Kitchen. The team is already involved in the video game space with adaptations of the Tomb Raider and Sonic the Hedgehog titles. Of course, a new live-action Tomb Raider series just received the green light from Amazon MGM Studios. Paramount Pictures and SEGA just launched the new Knuckles miniseries on Paramount+, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will be hitting theaters later this December.\n\nThe Just Cause game series revolves around Rico Rodriguez, a special military operative who works as a regime change specialist for the government and typically finds himself on deadly missions. Using his grappling hook and wingsuit, he must stop The Black Hand, a lethal mercenary group.\n\nA film adaptation of the video game series has been on deck before. It was previously developed by Constantin Films, with such names as Brad Peyton and Derek Kolstad attached. However, the rights ultimately lapsed before they switched hands to Universal Pictures and 87North.\n\nUniversal was reportedly eager to try to adapt the source material, noting the rising wave of video game adaptations in the works. More recently, Universal has had success with The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy’s, which were both released in theaters last year and very successful. The Super Mario Bros. Movie grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide and has a sequel in the works. Meanwhile, Five Nights at Freddy’s made $290 million at the global box office.\n\nDan Jevons is executive producing the project, and Max Jacoby will oversee the film for 87North. Senior VP of Production Development Ryan Jones and Director of Development Tony Ducret will oversee the adaptation for Universal.\n\nBefore taking on Just Cause, Blue Beetle filmmaker Soto is prepping another action movie, The Wrecking Crew, for Amazon MGM Studios. Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista are attached to star in the film. He’s also attached to co-write an upcoming Transformers spinoff with Marco Ramirez for Paramount that he may also direct. So, it looks like Just Cause may still have some time before it makes it into theaters.\n\nRELATED: Hayley Atwell Cast As Laura Croft in Tomb Raider\n\nThe Just Cause film doesn’t have any actors attached yet, but it will be interesting to see who portrays Rico Rodriguez. It will be released later on by Universal. Its current release date is unknown. The last game in the series, Just Cause 4, was released on consoles and PC in December 2018.\n\nWhat do you think of the news? Are you excited that a Just Cause movie is finally happening? Who do you think should portray Rico Rodriguez? Do you think Ángel Manuel Soto is a good choice as director? Let us know your thoughts about the news on The Illuminerdi’s social media.\n\nSOURCE: The Hollywood Reporter"
