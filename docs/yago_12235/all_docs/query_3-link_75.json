        "text": "The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the shortlist for the 2024 Academy Awards this week. “Wings of Dust” was selected as one of the 15 documentary short films to make the cut.\n\nThe film tells the story of a Indigenous Peruvian journalist who risks his life daily to secure a future where his son can savor the simple joy of drinking clean water — a dream which has been threatened by aggressive mining operations miles away from their town. “Wings of Dust” was directed by News and Documentary alum Giorgio Ghiotto and produced by fellow alum Eliza Mitnick.\n\n“Wings of Dust” also took home a Student Academy Award in October. It was one of 114 films to qualify in the category for documentary short film. The Oscar nominations will be announced next month."
