Stepping away from Hollywood’s portrayals of the American/Vietnam War, Dust & Metal offers an unorthodox perspective of Vietnam told through the lens of the country’s ubiquitous mode of transport: the motorbike.\n\nDirected by Esther Johnson, produced by Johnson and Live Cinema UK and funded by the British Council, the project was created by a unique partnership between Hanoi-based Vietnam Film Institute, and TPD: The Centre for Assistance and Development of Movie Talents. This partnership is the first of its kind in Vietnam, and Johnson the first filmmaker to be granted permission to use unseen rare film held at VFI for a full-length feature film. The project is innovative in its creative collaborative co-production methods, and exploration of repositioning seldom seen archive film to interpret marginal micro-histories.\n\nThe score was composed remotely by San Francisco-based Vietnamese electronic artist Xo Xinh, with sound design by Hanoi-based artist Nhung Nguyễn. The script integrates extracts from oral history interviews Johnson made with eminent Vietnamese filmmaker Trần Văn Thủy; and with visual artist Đặng Ái Viet.\n\nThe work takes the form of a creative poetic documentary in the vein of director Esther Johnson’s live cinema feature film ASUNDER.\n\nFor all media enquiries please contact Lisa Brook: lisa@livecinema.org.uk\n\n·\n\n‘Esther Johnson’s film brings together a trove of archive and contemporary footage for a thrilling, unorthodox portrait of Vietnam, screened with live music composed by Xo Xinh.\n\nBetween tourist promotions and Hollywood films lies another Vietnam, whose stunning landscape has been evocatively captured from the country’s most accessible form of transport: the motorbike. Like her ground-breaking 2016 work Asunder, Johnson’s new film employs old and new footage in inventive ways to challenge preconceived stereotypes. It also explores the role of the motorbike – often the only suitable mode of transport for navigating Vietnam’s vast arterial system of tiny country roads – within the country’s history and culture.\n\nAccompanying Johnson’s evocative montage is Xo Xinh’s electronic score, performed live, conveying in equal measure the film’s sense of wonder.’ — Sheffield Doc/Fest Programme\n\nFilm Festival Co-curation\n\nFull Programme HERE\n\nOn the centenary of Vietnamese cinema Star Nhà Ease: Vietnamese Cinema presents a captivating collection of Vietnamese cinematic treasures, marking their debut to UK audiences in London, Birmingham and Liverpool. Co-curated by Cường Minh Bá Phạm, Esther Johnson, and Tuyết Vân Huỳnh. This season is a celebration and introduction of Vietnamese cinema to UK viewers.\n\nStar Nhà Ease is dedicated to unveiling the rich tapestry of Vietnamese cinema to UK audiences for the first time. This initiative will focus on expanding the understanding of Vietnam’s unique cinematic identity and spotlighting the wealth of its cinematic achievements, which remain largely unrecognised in the West.\n\nTracing back to the 1920s, amidst a backdrop of considerable challenges and prolonged conflict, filmmakers have profoundly captured the tumultuous journey of Vietnamese people. Through their art, they have carved out a distinctive cinematic identity, establishing a voice that demands to be heard. As we approach the centenary of Vietnamese cinema in 2024, it presents a fitting moment to introduce UK audiences to a curated selection of rarely seen Vietnamese films.\n\nOur mission is to kindle a passion for Vietnamese cinema among viewers, celebrate its rich legacy, encourage the exploration of more Vietnamese films, and stimulate discussions on the narratives shaping Vietnam and its diaspora and the intrinsic value of the films we have selected. Star Nhà Ease aims to highlight the significance of film heritage and its role in empowering underrepresented communities and voices. By doing so, we envision a scenario where individuals, who rarely see themselves reflected on screen, will be drawn to cinemas in large numbers, feeling a sense of belonging within the broader spectrum of British arts and culture.\n\nStar Nhà Ease will present Esther Johnson’s archive essay documentary Dust & Metal (2022), which features extracts from across Vietnamese cinematic history, stemming from her field research in archives of the Vietnamese Film Institute. This will be accompanied by a live score from Xo Xinh, Vietnamese electronic music composer and performer at three dates across London, Birmingham and Liverpool. The ‘cine-concert’ is a truly international collaborative project, supported by the British Council and co-produced by TPD: The Centre for Movie Talents in Hanoi. The performances are a rare opportunity to see this unique work performed live after world premiering at Sheffield DocFest 2022 and its Vietnamese premiere at Monsoon Music Festival in 2023, as a part of the British Council UK/Viet Nam Season.\n\nStar Nhà Ease encapsulates three themes emerging from discussions on Vietnamese film, as well as the experiences of Vietnamese people and the diaspora. The themes revolve around light, home, and emotion. “Star” was chosen because it emits light and can signify a direction; it also serves as an adjective for actors in a film. “Nhà” is the Vietnamese word for home, imbuing the title with connotations of warmth, settlement, and comfort. Including the Vietnamese language in the title was important, alongside English, hinting at code-switching—a practice common among duo and multilingual individuals in their daily lives. Lastly, “Ease,” representing a feeling, was chosen to evoke a sense of familiarity, something we aspire to achieve, eliciting emotional responses.\n\nStar Nhà Ease: Vietnamese Cinema Season is supported by the BFI Audience Project Fund, awarding National Lottery funding, the British Council and Longdan Ltd."
