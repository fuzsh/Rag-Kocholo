        "text": "‘NO CHANGE IN OUR POLICY’: While President Volodymyr Zelensky travels to Washington for the NATO summit celebrating 75 years of the alliance, Ukraine today is in a day of mourning after Russia launched its heaviest bombardment of the country in months on Monday.\n\nWhile the attacks targeted six areas of Ukraine, one particularly heart-wrenching strike was by a Russian cruise missile on a children’s hospital in Kyiv, where seriously ill children are treated for cancer and other life-threatening health problems. “As of now, at least 37 people have been killed, including three children, and 170 injured, including 13 children,” Zelensky said in a post on X.\n\nIn remarks in Poland yesterday, Zelensky underscored Ukraine’s desperate need for more air defenses, such as the U.S.-made Patriot system, but again renewed his plea for President Joe Biden to lift restrictions on the use of U.S. weapons to strike deeper into Russia.\n\n“We need, in addition to air defense, and I think we have raised this issue more than once, the possibility of using our partner’s weapons to target the particular military bases and sites that Russia uses to launch attacks on Ukraine,” Zelensky said. “I think this is a decision we would like to see from our partners.”\n\n“There’s been no change in our policy,” John Kirby, national security communications adviser, said at the White House. “The president several weeks ago gave guidance to Ukraine that they can use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike targets just over the border. That’s still the case.”\n\nUKRAINE SAYS DOZENS KILLED AND CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL HIT IN RUSSIAN ATTACK\n\n‘DEBRIS FELL INTO HEART PATIENTS’ OPEN CHESTS’: In a statement, Biden called the hospital strike “a horrific reminder of Russia’s brutality.” At this week’s summit, Biden stated that allies will announce “new measures to strengthen Ukraine’s air defenses.”\n\n“I will be meeting with President Zelensky to make clear our support for Ukraine is unshakeable,” Biden said.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting on the attacks. However, the council’s rotating presidency is currently held by Russia, which denies targeting the hospital and is blaming an errant Ukrainian air defense missile for the carnage. Ukraine’s Security Service said wreckage of a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile was recovered at the site.\n\n“We are sure it was a Russian attack,” spokesman Matthew Miller said at the State Department. “Just to be clear, these are sites that serve no military purpose. They’re not sheltering Ukrainian military assets, they’re not sheltering members of the Ukrainian military. These are civilian infrastructure, pure and simple, that cannot, should not, must not be targets of military attacks.”\n\n“The attack on the Okhmatdyt Children’s hospital caused debris to fall into heart patients’ open chests in the middle of surgery,” the Associated Press said in a dispatch from Kyiv. “Cancer patients had their beds wheeled into parks and onto the streets.”\n\n“As if we needed another reminder, this evil and barbaric attack shows the high moral cost of the Biden administration’s failure to supply Ukraine with the munitions and defenses it needs,” said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a statement. “The world has known at least since February 22, 2022, that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal. His bombing of a children’s hospital on Sunday only reinforces that reality.”\n\n‘NATO IS IN UKRAINE’S FUTURE’: While Ukraine will not be getting an invitation to join NATO, reports indicate that a draft communique to be issued at the summit refers to Ukraine’s eventual membership as “irreversible.”\n\n“And you’re going to see … some discussion about Ukraine’s path to NATO and what that can look like,” Kirby said at yesterday’s White House briefing. “And a reaffirmation of what the president has long said — that NATO is in Ukraine’s future.”\n\n“I’ll just tell you that you’re going to see some announcements on air defense. You’re going to see some announcements on deterrence capabilities, not just with respect to helping Ukraine, but boosting the alliance,” Kirby said. “You’re going to see some announcements with respect to the defense industrial base and how to shore up that and make it more resilient and invest in it more, including in our own industrial base here in the United States.”\n\nTHE POLITICS BEHIND PUTIN’S MISSILE STRIKE ON A UKRAINIAN CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL\n\nGood Tuesday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre’s Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre) and edited by Stacey Dec.

The latest problems reported in January have forced the Pentagon to grant the program a special dispensation to a law that would otherwise require the program be killed.\n\nThe cost of the replacement ICBM has ballooned to $140.9 billion, an increase of 81%. Under a law known as Nunn-McCurdy, any increase over 30% is considered “critical” and requires the secretary of defense to either cancel the program or declare it absolutely necessary for national security.\n\n“Today I am certifying that the Sentinel program meets the statutory criteria to continue, but it is important to note that this certification does not indicate business as usual,” William LaPlante, undersecretary of defense for acquisitions and sustainment, said at a Pentagon briefing. “The program will be restructured to address the root causes of the breach and ensure an appropriate management structure is in place to control costs.”\n\nDOD RESTRUCTURES SENTINEL PROGRAM AFTER HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED SPENDING\n\nSENATE NDAA FILED: Leaders of the Armed Services Committee have formally filed the Senate version of the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, and Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), the committee’s ranking Republican, is calling for quick action on the annual policy bill. The bill authorizes $911.8 billion in defense, $25 billion over the caps set by law.\n\n“Senator Wicker will continue making the case that if President Biden’s budget can call for $76 billion above the spending caps, then the U.S. Congress can discuss increasing defense spending,” Wicker’s office said in a press release.\n\n“The world’s greatest deliberative body should get a chance to work its will on the floor, and I hope more of my colleagues will join me in continuing the national conversation about investing more,” Wicker said in calling for Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to bring the bill to the floor for debate.\n\n“The Senate Armed Services Committee sent a bipartisan signal that we must return to ‘peace through strength,’” he said. “The new axis of aggressors and their threats are already upon us. We do not have time to waste.”\n\nJAPAN AND PHILIPPINES SIGN ‘GROUNDBREAKING’ MILITARY PACT\n\nTHE RUNDOWN:\n\nWashington Examiner: DOD restructures Sentinel program after higher-than-expected spending\n\nWashington Examiner: Ukraine says dozens killed and children’s hospital hit in Russian attack\n\nWashington Examiner: Analysis: The politics behind Putin’s missile strike on a Ukrainian children’s hospital\n\nWashington Examiner: Biden to host new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at White House on Wednesday\n\nWashington Examiner: Japan and Philippines sign ‘groundbreaking’ military pact\n\nWashington Examiner: Biden tells congressional Democrats ‘to end’ talk of ditching him as nominee\n\nWashington Examiner: Schumer fighting to have Trump’s Jan. 6 actions unguarded from Supreme Court immunity ruling\n\nWashington Examiner: Judge Aileen Cannon agrees to partial pause in Trump’s classified documents trial\n\nWashington Examiner: DC prepares for NATO summit: Traffic disruptions expected downtown\n\nWashington Examiner: Press turns on White House at fiery press briefing over Biden health\n\nWashington Examiner: Biden grants TPS to Yemen, protecting illegal immigrants in US from deportation\n\nWashington Examiner: Texas temporarily removes barbed wire on border\n\nWashington Post: In Beijing, Orban And Xi Urge Ukraine Cease-Fire\n\nBreaking Defense: Ticking Clock: Northern NATO Defense Chiefs See Ever-Closing ‘Window’ to Prepare for Russia\n\nThe War Zone: Ultralight Drone Hunting Planes Now in Use in Ukraine\n\nStars and Stripes: Houthi Threats Continue Amid Imminent Arrival Of USS Theodore Roosevelt In Middle East\n\nWashington Post: Thousands Flee As Israel Begins New Gaza City Incursion\n\nAP: To Counter China, NATO And Its Asian Partners Are Moving Closer Under U.S. Leadership\n\nDefenseScoop: NATO Eyes New Tech Pursuits with Indo-Pacific Partners at DC Summit\n\nWall Street Journal: U.S. Plans Broader Look At Real-Estate Deals Near Military Bases\n\nBloomberg: Canada To Share Plan For Reaching NATO’s Spending Target, Defense Minister Says\n\nBreaking Defense: House Speaker to Push New Package of Legislation to ‘Punish’ China\n\nNew York Times: ​​The Yen Is Plunging.
