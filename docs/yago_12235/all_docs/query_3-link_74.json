        "text": "One of the leading figures of the Taiwanese New Wave, Hou Hsiao-hsien is not only recognised as one of the most famous movie directors in Taiwan, he also contributed to a little revolution in the cinema industry that continues to influence the way Taiwanese films are made today, breaking the classical filming codes to create new ones. Dust in the Wind marks the second collaboration with the cinematographer Mark Lee Ping-bing, together winning an award for the best photography at the Three Continents Film Festival of Nantes. Since 1985, Hou Hsiao-hsien and Mark Lee Ping-bing have collaborated in numerous movies, including the latest in date “The Assassin” in 2015.\n\nIn Dust in the Wind, we are merged into a very realistic universe where we witness Wan’s passage from childhood to adulthood. The story told is complex but fluid, complex because of the contradictory feelings of the protagonist and fluid because of the facility with which this movie expresses those feelings, often using visual language rather than dialogues.\n\nWe are shown the life experience of a countryside boy (Wan) who decides to move to Taipei, running after vague ambitions of financial and social success. Throughout the main character’s emerging love relationship with his childhood friend (Huen), we can notice the rough living and working conditions of the city. The realism of the scenes, the slow pace and the rather loose storyline allow the spectator to see beyond the narrated events. The atmosphere in which the story is soaked prompts the viewer to reflect on different topics like the living conditions in the city versus the countryside or on the historical factors that influenced Taiwanese culture to how it is today.\n\nWhen this film was released in 1986, the filming techniques and the narration style of the various New Waves wasn’t new, still, it is rare to see them mastered as in Dust in the Wind. One narration technique that is commonly used in the New Waves and in art films in general is the ambiguous temporal ellipse. In the 1965 「Pierrot le Fou」 by Jean Luc Godard for example, we sometime have difficulties to understand a shot’s position in space and time in relation to the others. Like if we had to put together the pieces of a puzzle.\n\nIn Dust in the Wind also, Hou Hsiao-hsien uses spatial and temporal ambiguity. However, compared to「Pierrot le Fou」, it is done in a very smooth way, the gaps between the shots are sometimes more or less explained and it did not shock nor confuse me when I encountered shots that weren’t explicitly situated.\n\nFor example, in the second scene, we are in the kitchen, the grandpa is standing, feeding a small kid that eats too little, then in the following shot, we are in the living room, the same grandpa is sitting down, scolding a grown up kid that eats too much. We do not have any indication of the time passed between the two shots. Here, like in early Soviet montage, the focus is on the semantic meaning and not on the clarity of the action.\n\nIt does not matter if one hour or ten years passed between the grandpa standing up and feeding the little kid and the grandpa sitting down and scolding the grown up kid, what is important is the growing hunger of the kid and the consequences of this hunger (will the poor grandpa be able to afford for the child’s growing needs?). Once this rule is established, we can start experiencing a smooth unfolding of the story despite the length of the events narrated (approximately 5–6 years) and the spatio-temporal back and forth.\n\nMark Lee Ping-bing’s work of photography, already recognised by an award, highly contributes to the greatness of the film. It is also thanks to the visual language that we are prompted to feel in a certain way or get some information that are important to the understanding of the story.\n\nIn Dust in the Wind, the camera moves very little and is often at eye level, making us feel as if we are part of the scenes. So if the actors are sitting, we are too, like when Wan and his father are sitting at the table, smoking cigarettes, or when Huen is introduced to Wan’s friends in Taipei, together sharing a meal.\n\nThere are a couple of exceptions where more dynamic handheld camera travels are used, like when Huen and Wan are looking for the stolen motorcycle, or in the dream/flashback on the bridge after Wan’s dad mining accident, but those cases are the only two and therefore marginal.\n\nWe more often have a relatively static camera with a frame composition that reminds me of the social realism of the photographer Walker Evans, extracting the essence of a social context out of an ordinary life scene.\n\nWe frequently find identical shots that appear several times during the movie, with the same framing and little changes in composition, allowing these places/images to become very familiar to the spectator. For example the shots on the porch of Wan’s house where the grandpa often sits. Another example is the long shots of a hill where Wan does his military service.\n\nThe placing of the actors and the setting of the camera focal ratio is also very well thought. Another filming technique used in Dust in the Wind is the great depth of field (the whole set is visible without blur) combined with the long take (shot that lasts a long time without a cut).\n\nOften seen in the Italian Neorealism, it allows the action to be more spread, it is also common practice to use it with natural sunlight for both technical and esthetical reasons. This way, our look is not prompted by the blur of the image, allowing us to shift our attention freely within the multiple layers of action available. Moreover, the time of the shot is equal to our time (since there aren’t any cuts), it therefore feels slower than a more traditional editing and allows us to digest what we are seeing. Overall, this way of filming looks very realistic because of how close it is from seeing in real life.\n\nFor example, in one of the shots on the porch, the grandpa is seated, crafting a cane for Wan’s father, not only are kids simultaneously playing in the background, but we also have a neighbour that arrives in front of the house and asks Wan to write a letter for her. During the time of the action, there aren’t any cuts and the camera is fixed in a long shot where the whole set is in focus.\n\nThanks to the artistic choices described above, the space and time in the movie feel like they are expanding, allowing the story to breathe, leaving the spectator in a state of contemplation. What is left to see is the realistic photography that expresses itself without needing much support from the narration. Watching Dust in the Wind made me feel like looking at a very well made photo album, realistic and expressive.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nIn this review, I barely described the narration style and visual aspect of the movie but there is so much more that could be said. If you wish to comment on what I wrote or highlight some points that I haven’t mentioned, please feel free."
