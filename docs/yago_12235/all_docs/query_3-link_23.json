        "text": "\"The only thing that matters, is that you are a man that no one would expect.\" The Avenue has revealed an official trailer for an indie small town crime thriller titled Blood For Dust, set for release starting in April. The film premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival last year, and it played at a number of other festivals including Deauville, San Diego, and Raindance. Described as \"Breaking Bad meets Fargo\", it's yet another of these gritty films about a guy with a troubled past that catches up to him. The same story as so many other films. Cliff, a traveling salesman drowning under the weight of providing for his family and the myth of the American dream, finds himself on a dangerous path after a chance encounter with Ricky, a colleague from a dark past. His once straight-laced life turns into a high-stakes game of survival. Starring Scoot McNairy as Cliff, with Nora Zehetne, Ethan Suplee, Amber Rose Mason, Stephen Dorff, Josh Lucas, and Kit Harington. Quite an impressive cast to boot. This doesn't look so bad, but it doesn't look very good either.\n\nHere's the main official trailer (+ poster) for Rod Blackhurst's Blood For Dust, direct from YouTube:"
