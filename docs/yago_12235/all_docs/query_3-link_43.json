Set in the legendary Sea Islands off the South Carolina/Georgia coast in 1902, the film follows a Gullah family (descendants of West African slaves) on the eve of its migration to the North. Led by a group of women who carry with them ancient African traditions, the extended family readies itself to leave behind friends, loved ones and their insulated way of life. Can these women hold fast to their sacred religious beliefs and customs, or will they be swept into the race toward an era of science and industry? This richly costumed drama, structured in tableaux to reflect the art and icons of African tradition, testifies movingly to the secret celebrations and packed-away sorrows of African-American women. These vital images were introduced to a new generation on a massive scale earlier this year, when the film was heavily referenced in Beyoncé’s visual album, Lemonade.\n \nUSA   1991   112 MINS   COHEN MEDIA GROUP\n“A film of spellbinding visual beauty.” – Stephen Holden, The New York Times\n“One of the most distinctive, original independent films of the time…Every image, every moment is a full creation. Dash is one of the heroines of the modern cinema.” – Richard Brody, The New Yorker",

The film’s re-release guarantees a new generation of super-fans to share her devotion.”\n\n– Melissa Anderson, Village Voice\n\n“Julie Dash’s boldly imaginative , ecstatically visionary drama, from 1991, is one of the best of all American independent films; she turns one family’s experience of the Great Migration into a vast mythopoetic adventure… Dash plots family relationships with a novelistic intensity and observes the cultural interweave of Christianity, Islam, African and Native American religions, mysticism, and politics with luminous lyricism and hypnotic pageantry. The intimate action shimmers with mysteries and myths.”\n\n– Richard Brody, The New Yorker"
