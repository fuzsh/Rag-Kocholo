        "text": "Universal Pictures is reportedly joining forces with Square Enix to create a live-action movie adaptation of Avalanche Studios’ popular open-world video game series, Just Cause. The news, initially reported by The Hollywood Reporter, has fans buzzing with anticipation.\n\nÁngel Manuel Soto, known for his work on Blue Beetle, is set to direct the film. However, specific story details and a release date are yet to be revealed. The production team includes notable names such as Kelly McCormick and David Leitch, who are producing under 87North. Story Kitchen’s Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg, and Timothy I. Stevenson are also on board as producers, with Dan Jevons serving as an executive producer. Max Jacoby, Ryan Jones, and Tony Ducret will oversee the project for 87North.\n\nThe Just Cause video game series, known for its explosive action and expansive open-world settings, features Rico Rodriguez, a mercenary navigating islands with his iconic parachutes and grappling hook. Since its debut in 2006, the series has captivated players with its massive set pieces and thrilling combat.\n\nThe journey to bring Just Cause to the big screen has been a long one. The first mention of a movie adaptation surfaced in 2009, but the project faced numerous delays. At one point, Jason Momoa was attached to star, though it remains unclear if he will be involved in the current iteration.\n\nThe Just Cause movie joins a growing trend of game-to-movie adaptations. Recent successes include The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Five Nights at Freddy’s. With more game-based films like Sonic the Hedgehog 3, The Legend of Zelda, and Minecraft on the horizon, the appetite for such adaptations is stronger than ever.\n\nFans can look forward to seeing how the explosive and adventurous world of Just Cause translates to film. Stay tuned for more updates as this exciting project develops."
