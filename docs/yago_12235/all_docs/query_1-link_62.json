        "meta_description": "Taiwan New Wave: Lives Less Ordinary Hou Hsiao-hsien Chien-wen Wang, Hsin Shu-Fen, Li Tian-Lu, Mei Fang Another milestone in Hou Hsiao-hsien’s career and the second collaboration with cinematographer Mark Lee Ping-bing (known for his work in In the Mood for Love and Café Lumiere). The film follows a young man’s transition from childhood to adulthood, as he and his sweetheart leave their rural hometown for the bustling city of Taipei. The contrast between country and city life, and the train that connects these two places, is depicted beautifully in the cinematography. Drawing inspiration from the French New Wave, the film masterfully uses ‘the ambiguous temporal ellipse’ technique, reminiscent of Jean Luc Godard’s Pierrot le Fou. Unlike the latter, where the shots are confusing for the audience, Dust in the Wind shows smoother transitions, subtly explaining gaps between shots and ensuring a seamless viewing experience. Which allows you to experience the film beyond its plot. A-yuan and A-yun are both from the small mining town of Jio-fen. They move to Taipei, where A-yuan is an apprentice by day and goes to night school, and A-yun works as a helper at a tailors. Everyone thinks they are meant for each other, and so do they. They fail to see time and fate are beyond their control. A-yuan and A-yun are both from the small mining town of Jio-fen.

They fail to see time and fate are beyond their control. KINO is proud to present (re)introduce you to nine masterpieces from the Taiwan New Wave. These classics have remained underseen in cinemas, so it’s high time we showcase them on our grandest screen. Featuring films from the first and second wave by Edward Yang, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Ang Lee, Tsai Ming-liang and more. The films of this revolutionary movement in cinema history were artistically innovative, but also in their realistic portrayal of the Taiwanese people. They illustrated societal and economic shifts, much like Italian Neorealism in the 1940s. By capturing their cultural identity, these filmmakers created their own voice and their own national cinema.
