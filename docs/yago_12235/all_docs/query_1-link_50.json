        "text": "There are the dreams – lovely, rousing, tantalizing, disquieting dreams.\n\nThen there is the machinery that makes, mashes or shreds them.\n\nAs a writer, Robert Towne has been responsible for some of Hollywood’s most fitful, compelling visions. Some he wrote from scratch. Others he adapted. Still others – like “Bonnie and Clyde” and “The Godfather” – he famously cured of what ailed them.\n\nThe Los Angeles native is also intimately\n\nacquainted with Hollywood’s grinding cogs and clashing gears.\n\n“There’s no problem getting a film made that they want to make,” said Towne recently over breakfast. The 71-year-old writer-director was in Denver for a screening of “Ask the Dust,” starring Colin Farrell as a young Italian-American author set on writing the great American novel in Depression-era Los Angeles.\n\nStill, it was a chastising reminder of what ails Hollywood, coming from a writer responsible for one of filmdom’s legendary trifectas.\n\nTowne’s “The Last Detail” (1973) stars Jack Nicholson as a Navy lifer who escorts a young sailor (Randy Quaid) being shipped off to the brig. It was nominated for best adapted screenplay. Consider that the stuff of the dream.\n\nThe machine almost chewed up the work when Columbia Pictures, fretting over the movie’s blue language, pondered whether to release it. Then Nicholson won an award at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe next year, Towne won the screenplay Oscar for “Chinatown,” another film starring Nicholson. Private eye Jake Gittes remains one of the actor’s greatest roles.\n\nIn 1975, Towne and Warren Beatty were nominated for “Shampoo,” which starred Beatty as a hairdresser who knew how to keep his clients happy, if only for a time.\n\n“Chinatown” remains the great late-period American noir. Noah Cross (John Huston) not only ravages the California environment for gain but also a daughter, played by Faye Dunaway. Directed by Roman Polanski, the movie is an astonishing critique of patriarchal power in a genre known for creating femmes usually more fatale than feminist.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever written a female character that wasn’t sympathetic,” said Towne. “Classically the woman at the center of a film noir like that is the black widow. (Evelyn Mulwray’s) the heroine.” Polanski rewrote Towne’s ending so that Dunaway’s character dies. While it stung the writer, it made the movie an even darker fable of American power.\n\nTowne first read John Fante’s novel “Ask the Dust” while at work on “Chinatown” in 1971.\n\nFante, who grew up in Colorado and moved to Los Angeles (like his character Arturo Bandini), had slipped into out-of- print limbo. It was Charles Bukowski who discovered a copy of “Ask the Dust” and insisted Black Sparrow, his publisher, take it on.\n\nOver time Towne and Fante became friends. But it wasn’t until 1993, 10 years after Fantes died, that Towne wrote the script.\n\nTowne grew serious about making the film.That’s also when the machine began its slow grind. Johnny Depp – who wasn’t quite Johnny Depp yet – was interested. But there was no financing.\n\n“It took about nine more years before this crazy Irishman showed up on my doorstep,” Towne said of Farrell. “He was completely unknown at the time.\n\n“We had a party at the house that had a lot of my wife’s girlfriends there. And Colin walked through the kitchen. You could feel the temperature rise. And one of them said, ‘I don’t know who he is or what he wants but give it to him.”‘\n\nThe two spent about 10 hours together, recalled Towne.\n\n“At the end of that time, I knew I wanted him to do it,” he said. “He knew he wanted to do it. I remember thinking, ‘Well, we’ll continue to have a hard time getting it made because nobody knows who this guy is.’ But I thought he was right. And three years later he became a movie star.”\n\nSo why did a celebrated screenwriter, with a solid track record directing (“Tequila Sunrise” and “Without Limits”) and a high-profile star, still have to labor like a recent NYU film school grad to get this moody, finely crafted movie made?\n\nTowne thinks the problem started at the same time studios were distributing some of America’s most gritty, gratifyingly engaged films: the 1970s.\n\n“In 1975 when ‘Jaws’ was released, it changed everything,” he said. “Studios learned they could get a tremendous return on their money quickly.\n\n“That created – for better and worse – the tent-pole movie. It’s given us television shows as movies. It’s given us comic books as movies. It’s given us all kinds of franchises.”\n\nTowne penned one of those franchises based on a TV show. He scripted “Mission Impossible” and “Mission Impossible II.” (Tom Cruise and business partner Paula Wagner produced “Ask the Dust”).\n\nBut “movies like ‘Ask the Dust’ need to struggle to come to life. They must beg, borrow and steal to get money.”\n\nLucky for us, Towne begged, borrowed and still had the energy to write a fine adaptation.\n\nBut doesn’t the screenwriter emeritus deserve more?\n\nAnd don’t audiences?\n\nFilm critic Lisa Kennedy can be reached at 303-820-1567 or lkennedy@denverpost.com.\n\nThree years, three scripts, three Oscar nominations\n\n“The Last Detail” (1973)\n\nBuddusky (Jack Nicholson): See, lemme tell you about a kid like Meadows. He’s the kind of guy who goes to the brig, and he’s probably secretly glad. Too much can happen to him on the outside, and it’s all bad. This way he knows that the worst has happened, and he’s probably glad. You know what I mean?\n\n“Shampoo” (1975)\n\nLester (Jack Warden): Did they have something against me?\n\nGeorge (Warren Beatty): Didn’t they tell you?\n\nLester: I wanna hear it from you!\n\nGeorge: How am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean (expletive), they’re women, aren’t they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do till it’s (expletive) coming out of my ears.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to …\n\n“Chinatown” (1974)\n\nJake Gittes (Jack Nicholson): How much are you worth?\n\nNoah Cross (John Huston): I have no idea. How much do you want?\n\nGittes: I want to know what you’re worth – over 10 million?\n\nCross: Oh, my, yes.\n\nGittes: Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can’t already afford?\n\nCross: The future, Mr. Gittes – the future."
