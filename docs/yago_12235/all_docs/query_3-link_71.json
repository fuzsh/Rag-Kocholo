        "text": "Kit Harington and Scoot McNairy play old friends who reunite under dangerous circumstances in the first trailer for crime thriller Blood for Dust.\n\nThe Avenue is set to release director Rod Blackhurst’s feature in select theaters and on digital platforms April 19 following its premiere at last year’s Tribeca Festival. Josh Lucas and Stephen Dorff also star in Blood for Dust, which tells the story of Cliff (McNairy), a traveling salesman with financial issues who becomes enveloped in the world of drug trafficking after reuniting with Ricky (Harington).\n\n“I don’t sell products that sell themselves,” Harington says in the trailer. This leads McNairy to respond, “You’re an arms dealer who sells drugs, Ricky.”\n\nBlackhurst (Here Alone) helmed the film from a script by David Ebeltoft. Ryan Winterstern, Bernard Kira, Petr Jákl, Ari Novak, Arun Kumar, Bobby Campbell, Nathan Klingher, Mark Fasano and Noah Lang serve as producers.\n\nBlood for Dust premiered at Tribeca in June. In his review for The Hollywood Reporter, film critic Jordan Mintzer wrote that it “heads to mostly familiar places, but manages to do so in a way that makes us want to stick around for the ride.” He adds, “What makes Blood for Dust work is the sleek filmmaking, as well as McNairy’s sad and slippery portrayal of a down-and-out nobody who decides crime is the only thing that pays.”\n\nHarington, best known for playing Jon Snow on Game of Thrones, appeared in last year’s Apple TV+ ecologically focused anthology series Extrapolations and can be seen in the upcoming season of Industry."
