        "text": "BIDEN TAKES CENTER STAGE: President Joe Biden capably delivered a forceful speech, read from a teleprompter, at the opening of this week’s Washington summit marking the 75 anniversary of the NATO alliance. He passed the first test in his effort to show he’s still up to the job of leading not just the United States but also the Western world.\n\nBut Biden—who is stubbornly resisting pressure from worried Democrats to give up his reelection bid—will face a much bigger test tomorrow. He is scheduled to hold an unscripted news conference, during which he will be peppered with questions from the global press corps.\n\n“This is a pivotal moment for Europe, for the transatlantic community, and, I might add, for the world,” Biden said. “Russia will not prevail. Ukraine will prevail.”\n\n“And Kyiv — remember, fellows and ladies — was supposed to fall in five days. Remember? Well, it’s still standing two and a half years later and will continue to stand,” Biden said. “Putin thought NATO would break. Today, NATO is stronger than it’s ever been in its history.”\n\n“Make no mistake, Russia is failing in this war. More than two years into Putin’s war of choice, his losses are staggering: more than 350,000 Russian troops dead or wounded; nearly 1 million Russians, many of them young people, have left Russia because they no longer see a future in Russia,” he said. “When this senseless war began, Ukraine was a free country. Today, it is still a free country, and the war will end with Ukraine remaining a free and independent country.”\n\nNATO SUMMIT’S TOP ISSUES: DEFENSE SPENDING, UKRAINE — AND BIDEN\n\nUS, ALLIES PROMISE ‘DOZENS’ OF AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS, ‘HUNDREDS’ OF MISSILES: Just two days after the devastating Russian cruise missile attack on Europe’s largest children’s cancer hospital in Kyiv, Biden announced NATO allies would significantly boost Ukraine’s ability to defends against Russia standoff missiles and bombs.\n\n“The United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, and Italy will provide Ukraine with the equipment for five additional strategic air defense systems, and in the coming months, the United States and our partners intend to provide Ukraine with dozens of additional tactical air defense systems,” Biden said. “All told, Ukraine will receive hundreds of additional interceptors over the next year.”\n\nA fact sheet released by the White House said initially the five systems would include three additional Patriot batteries from the U.S., Germany, and Romania; as well as components donated by the Netherlands and other partners to enable the operation of an additional Patriot battery, as well as a SAMP-T system donated by Italy.\n\n“We are coordinating closely with the Ukrainian government so that these systems can be utilized rapidly,” the statement said. “We are working on a further announcement this year of additional strategic air defense systems for Ukraine.”\n\nBIDEN ANNOUNCES NATO EFFORT TO SUPPLY UKRAINE WITH MORE AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS\n\nDEFENSE SPENDING SOARS: Biden cited figures that show NATO defense spending has increased dramatically since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022, a spike no doubt driven by the ominous threat posed by President Vladimir Putin’s irredentist ambitions.\n\n“Putin wants nothing less than Ukraine’s total subjugation; to end Ukraine’s democracy; to destroy Ukraine’s culture; and to wipe Ukraine off the map,” Biden said. “And we know Putin won’t stop at Ukraine.”\n\nBiden noted that when he took office in 2021, only nine NATO nations were meeting the 2% of GDP defense spending goal set in 2014. So far, 23 of the 32 members are meeting the standard, which was given a deadline of this year. But collectively, the entire alliance is now spending more than 2% on defense, and Biden said the remaining countries that have not yet reached the milestone “will get there soon.”\n\n“It’s remarkable progress — proof that our commitment is broad and deep, that we’re ready, that we’re willing, and we’re able to deter aggression and defend every inch of NATO territory across every domain: land, air, sea, cyber, and space,” Biden said. “My friends, it’s good that we’re stronger than ever, because this moment in history calls for our collective strength.”\n\nOPINION: THE PROBLEMS WITH THE NATO DEFENSE SPENDING HAPPY TALK\n\nGood Wednesday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre’s Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre) and edited by Stacey Dec.

According to the Pentagon, he will “highlight the continued strength, unity, and resolve of the NATO alliance to safeguard our collective defense and tackle security challenges together.”\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken will also speak at the forum this morning. Blinken’s remarks will be live-streamed on the State Department website at 9:05 a.m., and Austin’s remarks will be live-streamed on the Pentagon’s website at 9:50 a.m.\n\nToday, Blinken and Austin will join Biden for discussions with NATO heads of state at the summit. Tonight, Austin is hosting NATO defense ministers for a dinner at Fort McNair in Washington, and Blinken is hosting a similar dinner for NATO and partner foreign ministers in Washington.\n\nHAPPENING TOMORROW: The White House says President Biden will meet one-on-one with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelesnky at the Washington Convention Center, site of the NATO summit.\n\n“This will be the third meeting between both presidents in recent weeks, following their sit-down in France and also a sit-down at the G7 in Italy, and it will further demonstrate the strength of the partnership between our counties,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “It will take place just before the NATO-Ukraine Council meeting.”\n\nZELENSKY REACHES OUT TO REPUBLICANS AMID BIDEN’S POLITICAL TROUBLES\n\nZELENSKY: WORLD CAN’T WAIT UNTIL NOVEMBER: In a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation yesterday, Zelensky warned the world must not wait for the U.S. election in November to help Ukraine turn the tide of battle against Russia.\n\n“Let’s be candid and frank. Now everyone is waiting for November,” Zelensky said according to a transcript on his official website. “Americans are waiting for November. And Europe, Middle East, Indo-Pacific – the whole world is looking to November. And truly speaking – Putin awaits November too,” he said. “It’s time to step out of the shadows, to make strong decisions work, to act and not to wait for November or any other month.”\n\nIn a separate address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said, “We are pushing for more aircraft, F-16s. We are pushing to get them. We are pushing for additional security commitments for Ukraine, which means weapons, finances, and political support. We are pushing for the necessary decisive actions by America and Europe, something that will strengthen our warriors.”\n\n“I am confident it will happen,” he said.\n\nUS UNVEILS NATO PLAN TO BUY BODY ARMOR FOR UKRAINIAN MILITARY WOMEN\n\nQUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN’S BEDTIME: In an appearance on Fox News following Biden’s NATO speech, John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser, fielded a barrage of questions raised by reports that Biden told a meeting of Democrats he needs more sleep and is no longer scheduling events after 8 p.m.\n\nFox News anchor Bret Baier raised a Wall Street Journal report that questioned Biden’s stamina and read from a portion of the article recounting an anecdote that allegedly happened at the G7 meeting last month in Germany.\n\n“German officials, aware of Biden’s fatigue at night, sought to accommodate the president by planning a June 22 event with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz early in the evening. The informal event, a soiree at the Alpine resort during the Group of Seven summit, was arranged as a confidential meeting on Ukraine in a relaxed setting,” Baier read. “Biden didn’t show, surprising the chancellor and his aides, officials said. Instead, Secretary Blinken arrived and announced that Biden had to go to bed,” according to two people there.\n\n“I can’t verify those reports, these anonymous reports,” Kirby said. “I would point to you to what got done at the G7. And one of the things that got done was a press conference with President Zelenskyy at the end of a very, very long day at the very end of that trip, where he signed a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine. I mean, there was an awful lot of work done at the G7, and the president was right in the middle of it.”\n\n“You know, a couple of elections ago, there was the 3:00 a.m. call,” Baier said. “Now there’s real concern about can he handle something that doesn’t happen between 10:00 and 4:00 p.m.”\n\n“He gets calls in the middle of the night all the time,” Kirby replied. “And a couple of G7s ago, Bret, you might remember, there was a missile that fell in Poland. There was a concern that it could have been a Russian missile. That call came in to him in the middle of the night. He called together the G7 in a snap meeting by 8:00 that morning. He gets calls a lot.”\n\nSEVENTH HOUSE DEMOCRAT CALLS ON BIDEN TO WITHDRAW DESPITE CLOSED-DOOR MEETING TO AIR CONCERNS\n\nJAMES INHOFE, 1934-2024: Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK), who served nearly 30 years in Congress and chaired the Armed Services Committee after the death of John McCain (R-AZ), died yesterday at the age of 89. Inhofe — who underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery in 2013 — suffered a stroke over the July Fourth holiday, his family said in a statement, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMany of the obituaries for Inhofe mentioned the time he brought a snowball onto the Senate floor to illustrate his skepticism about climate change. Still, his colleagues on both sides of the aisle remembered him for his ability to forge compromise on national security.\n\n“Together, we produced nearly two dozen bipartisan National Defense Authorization Acts, traveled to combat zones and military posts around the world, and worked to support our men and women in uniform. We both had the privilege to serve in the Army, and I know Jim carried out his deep sense of responsibility to our troops in the Senate each day,” said Sen. Jack Reed (D-NH), chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n\n“Jim Inhofe demonstrated that he continued to know how to build consensus and get things done for his fellow Oklahomans, as well as for his fellow Americans,” said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS). “Jim Inhofe was an accomplished pilot. He flew solo around the world at age 56. As a Member of Congress, he was known as a straight shooter who was not afraid to challenge the conventional wisdom, as he did so on numerous occasions.”“For nearly three decades, the Senator for Oklahoma lived up to his unique and distinguished middle name: Jim was a Mountain of a man,” saidSen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY). “His laser focus on growing and modernizing the U.S. military strengthened the security of the entire free world.”\n\nJAMES INHOFE DEAD: FORMER LONGTIME GOP OKLAHOMA SENATOR DIES AT 89\n\nTHE RUNDOWN:\n\nWashington Examiner: Biden announces NATO effort to supply Ukraine with more air defense systems\n\nWashington Examiner: NATO eyeing spending above 2% on defense\n\nWashington Examiner: Putin still believes he can outlast Ukraine and NATO\n\nWashington Examiner: NATO summit: Baltic defense minister takes veiled shot at Canada\n\nWashington Examiner: NATO needs to beef up China contingency plans, top Republican says\n\nWashington Examiner: NATO summit’s top issues: Defense spending, Ukraine — and Biden\n\nWashington Examiner: Zelensky reaches out to Republicans amid Biden’s political troubles\n\nWashington Examiner: US urges defense companies to back democracy\n\nWashington Examiner: US unveils NATO plan to buy body armor for Ukrainian military women\n\nWashington Examiner: Biden issues surprise medal at NATO and turns up pageantry with presidency on the line\n\nWashington Examiner: Opinion: The problems with the NATO defense spending happy talk\n\nWashington Examiner: House Democrats emerge from closed-door meeting divided on Biden’s fate\n\nWashington Examiner: Seventh House Democrat calls on Biden to withdraw despite closed-door meeting to air concerns\n\nWashington Examiner: House Democratic leaders declare Biden nominee but leave door open for replacement\n\nWashington Examiner: James Inhofe dead: Former longtime GOP Oklahoma senator dies at 89\n\nWashington Examiner: Mexican cartels using drones to carry out explosive attacks: Former Border Patrol official\n\nWashington Examiner: Opinion: Biden rallies support for Ukraine and rightly honors NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg\n\nWashington Examiner: Opinion: Europe’s brutal military history underlines America’s NATO exceptionalism\n\nWashington Examiner: Opinion: Rishi Sunak offers Biden and Trump an example of political civility\n\nWashington Examiner: Opinion: Biden commits to a Praetorian presidency\n\nNew York Times: Ukraine’s Strength Is Growing, Foiling Russia’s Advances\n\nAP: Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Target A U.S.-Flagged Container Ship In The Gulf Of Aden\n\nThe War Zone: Greek Warship Guns-Down Houthi Drone In New Video\n\nAP: Israeli strikes in central Gaza kill 20 Palestinians as mediators make new push on cease-fire deal\n\nAP: In a diplomatic quirk, Russia chairs a UN meeting decrying its strike on a Ukraine kids’ hospital\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: NATO Announces More Air Defense for Ukraine, Update on F-16s Coming at Summit\n\nTask & Purpose: Here Are The Ships The U.S. Plans To Sink In The Pacific This Summer\n\nBreaking Defense: Space Now a Priority for NATO Leaders, Euro Leaders Scramble to Meet Threats\n\nDefenseScoop: Hicks Urges NATO to Grow Industrial Capacity, Adopt Replicator-Like Systems\n\nAir Force Times: Air Force, Space Force Join Army for Bring-Your-Own-Device Enrollment\n\nAP: US-Built Pier Will Be Put Back in Gaza for Several Days to Move Aid, Then Permanently Removed\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Senators Want to Add New F-15EXs, Missiles, Spare Parts to Air Force Budget\n\nStars and Stripes: USFJ Commander Calls Out ‘Aggressive Regional Actors’ at Air Base Command Change in Tokyo\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: New Mission Deltas Better Integrate Space, Cyber, and ISR, SpOC Boss Says\n\nDefense One: US, Allies Take Down Kremlin-Backed AI Bot Farm\n\nThe War Zone: AT-802U Trainers Arrive to Prepare USAF Aviators for a Murky Light Attack Future\n\nMilitary.com: Commander of New Hampshire Air National Guard Killed in Hit-and-Run Incident Near His Home\n\nThe Cipher Brief: Opinion: Why NATO Would Be Stronger With Ukraine As a Member\n\nThe Cipher Brief: Opinion: NATO Must Stop Putin – and Stop Worrying About Trump\n\nThe Cipher Brief: Former NATO Secretary General: For Europeans, “Holiday from History Is Over”\n\nThe Cipher Brief: Analysis: Pezeshkian Celebrates a Win in Iran but What Can He Really Do?\n\nWEDNESDAY | JULY 10\n\n8 a.m. 801 Allen Y.
