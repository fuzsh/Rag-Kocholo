The movie stars Karen Gillan as a lazy, uninspired woman, who “is visited by an otherworldly C responsible for giving humanity all its great ideas.\"\n\nThe movie was directed by Laura Moss from a script by Nick Kocher and it also stars Jillian Bell, Karan Soni, and David Dastmalchian.\n\nIt’s a well-made short that tells a neurotic story. I hope you take the time to check it out!"
