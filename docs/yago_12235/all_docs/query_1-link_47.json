        "text": "When I found out that Beyonce's Lemonade\n\nhad some elements of Daughters of the Dust,\n\nmy website shut down,\n\nand then I started getting all these phone calls and emails.\n\nHave you seen it?\n\nPeople started asking me...\n\n[stammers]\n\nWere you offended or anything?\n\nI was like, No! [chuckles]\n\nAre you kidding?\n\nHi, Vogue.\n\nI'm Julie Dash, and I'm here to talk to you about my film\n\nDaughters of the Dust.\n\n[girls clapping] [soft music]\n\n[film reel clicking]\n\n[film reel clicking]\n\n[film reel clicking]\n\nI started studying film doing the Blaxploitation period.\n\nWhen I was in high school, as I say,\n\nI started going to the Studio Museum of Harlem,\n\nand studying cinematography.\n\nLater, when I was in undergraduate school at CCNY,\n\na pilot program called the Leonard Davis Center\n\nfor the Performing Arts was started.\n\nSo I decided to change my major and major in film.\n\nI relocated out to Los Angeles.\n\nI wrote and directed a film called Illusions in 1982.\n\nI think I did another film, short film called Four Women.\n\nBut all the time I'd been writing and perfecting,\n\nand making a trailer for Daughters of the Dust,\n\nand then eventually we were able to raise $800,000.\n\n[camera shutter clicking]\n\n[Man] Nana, she carried them with her for generations.\n\nDaughters of the dust is about a African American family,\n\nabout the women who are the carriers\n\nof their traditions and belief.\n\nAnd it's a family dinner that takes place\n\nthe night before they migrate north.\n\nI was very much excited by the opportunity\n\nto depict African American women,\n\nor women from the African diaspora,\n\nin a way that was different\n\nfrom what I was seeing on television at the time,\n\nor what I was seeing in the movies\n\nwith the Blaxploitation films.\n\nI always felt that other,\n\nthe stories of others were told\n\nwith such elegance and grace,\n\nand our stories were just kind of like, brutal.\n\nAnd so, I was determined to reimagine\n\nhow we are on the screen in historical drama,\n\nas well as contemporary life\n\nin a way that showed respect for my family\n\nand for the community from which I came, you know?\n\n[camera shutter clicking]\n\nThe costumes were very, very particular for me.\n\nAnd one of the things that we did with the costumes,\n\nwhat I wanted was\n\nto have the costumes indicate to the viewer the time period\n\nand where these women were in their lives\n\nand how this family functioned on this island.\n\nSo I made sure that all of the costumes\n\nwere 10 to 15 years older\n\nthan the 1902 time period in which it's set.\n\nThey were like Gibson girl, white dresses.\n\nBut if you know anything about the Gibson girl dresses,\n\nthey were hand me downs.\n\nIn the late 1800s,\n\nGibson girl dress was just something\n\nthat was fashionable and in Sears catalogs.\n\nSo then you know that there was some contact\n\nwith the outside world, with wealthier families\n\nwho handed these things down,\n\nand these women wore it on special days.\n\nIt was also important for me to show that African Americans\n\nare not always wearing the same old,\n\nthe clothing that they wear\n\nwhen they're doing agricultural work,\n\nbecause that's usually what we see.\n\nIt was also important that I indicate that the Nana Peazant,\n\nthe family matriarch,\n\nthat she's not wearing one of these white dresses.\n\nShe's wearing a dress\n\nthat's dyed in indigo blue specifically,\n\nbecause that was the cash crop that they worked on\n\nwhen she was growing up.\n\nThe color indigo, it's very important,\n\nand remains very important to the Gullah Geechee people\n\n'cause it was not only a cash crop in the colonies.\n\nIt was also technology and agriculture\n\nthat they brought with them from West Africa,\n\nthe process, the planting, harvesting,\n\nand processing of indigo.\n\nAnd so that's something that we still see today,\n\npainted on the windows and framing houses, the color indigo.\n\nIt's just very special and very powerful, very magical.\n\nThe wardrobe team, they were fantastic.\n\nWe had several things that were built in Savannah,\n\nlike Yellow Mary's dress was made handmade in Savannah.\n\nThe most important thing about the costumes were,\n\nwe had to age them\n\nbecause it's very difficult to shoot white\n\non black skin tones.\n\nAnd we didn't want that contrast out there\n\nespecially because the sun was so bright,\n\nand the sand was so bright white,\n\nand with the bright white dresses,\n\nit would've been, you know, catastrophic.\n\nSo everything was like, dipped in,\n\nthey call it dipped in tea\n\nbut really, it was dipped in dye\n\nto bring down the whiteness\n\nand make it appear more aesthetically pleasing to the eye\n\non the dark skin tones.\n\nBetween myself and Kerry James Marshall,\n\nwho was our production designer,\n\nwe worked very hard on establishing a look,\n\ncreating a world that was unlike any world\n\nthat had been seen before on the screen.\n\nThe costumes were from actual photographs\n\nthat were held at the Penn Center:\n\nphotographs of women in white dresses\n\nhaving lunch on the beach.\n\nThey also wore hats, but we could not afford the hats.\n\n[chuckles] We ran out of money.\n\n[camera shutter clicking]\n\nWe submitted to Sundance and they accepted it.\n\nIt was in the competition.\n\nWe won for best cinematography,\n\nand we assumed that we would get distribution right away,\n\nbut we did not get distribution.\n\nIt wasn't until one year later,\n\nand it was released to theaters in 1992.\n\nIt just never occurred to me until someone said,\n\nWell, you're the first Black woman\n\nto get a major theatrical release.\n\nIt was kind of bittersweet\n\nbecause it was like, this is 1992.\n\nThere were some distributors\n\nwho didn't even want to talk about it.\n\nThey wanted to see what they normally see, you know,\n\nin Black people, in situations, and in locations\n\nwhere they were recognizable from previous films.\n\nAnd at the time, you know,\n\nBlack youth films, you know\n\nmale-oriented, dominated youth films were being made,\n\nand they wanted to see something more hip-hop.\n\nAnd I was actually told by, you know,\n\none distributor that my film was not authentic\n\nlike the other films were.\n\nIn terms of depicting African Americans on a screen,\n\nit was mostly stories about antebellum,\n\nslavery period, and all of that,\n\nor what I call the urban testosterone films.\n\nWe had this hunger, you know,\n\nto see ourselves as complicated people living our lives\n\nand everything didn't have to do\n\nwith racial oppression or civil rights.\n\nI did not know the way I was dressing the characters\n\nin Daughters of the Dust\n\nwould be surprising or shocking to most.\n\nSome people would say they were just absolutely offended.\n\nDaily Variety said that\n\nit looked like a Laura Ashley commercial\n\nbecause of the white dresses,\n\nand then that, right there.\n\nyou could just see that's the biased attitude.\n\nIt's like why,\n\nif you're thinking of having black women depicted\n\nat the turn of this century,\n\nthey have no right to be wearing a white dress\n\nblowing in the wind, in the sand.\n\nThey need to have a pitchfork and a hoe.\n\nThey were saying, you know,\n\nlike, Black people don't wear white dresses like that.\n\nYou know, Why didn't they have on\n\na playa dress or something?\n\nAnd that just goes to show you that\n\nwe see so much of the same thing over and over in television\n\nand in motion pictures.\n\nNot so much now, as it was 30 years ago\n\n[camera shutter clicking]\n\nDaughters of the Dust has had a long life. [chuckles]\n\nAnd so I'm very happy, all very happy about that.\n\nI've had a lot of comments from a lot of young filmmakers\n\nwho say, you know, it was one of the first Black films\n\nthat they've seen like that,\n\nthat even though they didn't understand it,\n\nthey can't get it out of their mind.\n\nWhen I found out that Beyonce's Lemonade\n\nhad some elements of Daughters of the Dust,\n\nmy website shut down,\n\nand then I started getting all these phone calls and emails.\n\nHave you seen it?\n\nAnd at that time, I had to get a link.\n\nLike I was in awe, it was beautiful.\n\nI just watched it.\n\nMy mouth was open agape,\n\nand I was just watched this whole thing for 40 minutes.\n\nIt was like, my heart was beating so hard.\n\nIt was so good.\n\nAnd then, the interesting thing was then,\n\npeople started asking me,\n\n[stammers]\n\nWere you offended or anything?\n\nIt was like, No! [chuckles]\n\nAre you kidding?\n\nI went to art school. [chuckles]\n\nWe don't get, with that, we love stuff like that.\n\nIt's like, you know,\n\nnext generation takes your stuff and repurposes it.\n\nAnd that's the whole meaning of telling stories.\n\nThere's a continuum of ideas that build on projects.\n\nThere's nothing that's like, totally, totally original.\n\nAnd I've told people many times\n\nthat my tree scene was homage to Ganja & Hess,\n\nwith Dr. Hess sitting in their legs swinging.\n\nI've been influenced and informed\n\nby other pieces of artwork\n\nthat kind of speak to that time period.\n\nI think Daughters of the Dust\n\nhas had the impact that it's had because it's different,\n\nbecause it went beyond the comfort zone of most,\n\nbecause it introduced Gullah Geechee culture\n\nto the mainstream African American culture,\n\nbecause we dared to light it in a certain way,\n\nAJ's lighting,\n\nbecause Kerry James Marshall's production design\n\nwas so authentic and confounding,\n\nand the music of John Barnes.\n\nSo I think it was a combination of all of these things\n\nthat make it, still make it kind of an interesting film\n\nto look back at.\n\n[soft music]"
