        "text": "''India changes a person,'' someone says in ''Heat and Dust,'' just as other travelers from the West have been saying in fiction about India for the last 100 or so years. What makes the old line so poignant in this fine new film is the understanding that the changes wrought by India aren't necessarily accidental, involuntary or even very mysterious. Instead, they've been sought out by generations of tourists, some less heedless than others, who, as often as not, are infatuated by an idea of India long before they set foot on the subcontinent.\n\n''Heat and Dust,'' which opens today at the Paris Theater, is Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's wise, multilayered, essentially comic adaptation of her own novel for her longtime screen collaborators, James Ivory, the director, and Ismail Merchant, the producer. ''Heat and Dust'' may be their most thoroughly satisfying collaboration since their first film, ''The Householder'' (1963), and their second, ''Shakespeare Wallah'' (1965).\n\nThe new movie, demonstrating a sort of literary complexity that seldom works well on the screen, cuts back and forth between two parallel stories separated by nearly 60 years. At the heart of the first, set in the mid-1920's, is Olivia (Greta Scacchi), a pretty, well-born young Englishwoman, the wife of a very proper British civil servant, who falls into a disastrous affair with the local reigning prince (Shashi Kapoor), a charming, apparently completely corrupt nawab.\n\nFraming the story of Olivia is that of Anne (Julie Christie), the granddaughter of Olivia's sister. Anne not only represents today's liberation movement, she might also be one of its victims in ways she doesn't acknowledge. After an unhappy affair at home, Anne comes to India to research the story of her long-dead great-aunt Olivia. With her files of old letters and a tape recorder for interviews, Anne settles down in Satipur with a middle-class Indian family that, by chance, lives in the house where Olivia and Douglas (Christopher Cazenove), her husband, acted out their unhappy tale.\n\n''Heat and Dust'' derives its comic power from the differences between Olivia and Anne, and the similarities, which Anne, who is also a romantic, more or less forces into being. In the way that it is played, Anne's affair with her young Indian landlord (Zakir Hussain) is cheerful and none too serious. It's just that the landlord is at hand when she needs someone.\n\nMiss Christie, who makes too few movies, is lovely and commonsensical as Anne. Her intelligence perfectly reflects that of the film itself. As the lost Olivia, Miss Scacchi, an Italian-born, English-bred actress new to films, dominates ''Heat and Dust.'' She looks a little like Susan Sarandon but has her own kind of not completely suppressed fire. It's a good role, exceptionally well played. Mr. Kapoor, who has made a number of Merchant-Ivory productions, is both funny and mysterious as the nawab, whose perfect manners may be the mask of either a fool or a villain.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
