        "text": "Fairy Dust is a 2016 short film that was co-produced, co-written, and starred Tove Lo. The film was released on the same day as the first \"chapter,\" or first six songs, of Lo's sophomore album, Lady Wood, which was released on October 28, 2016.\n\nOn October 31, 2016, the film was released on YouTube and VEVO.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe film begins with Tove Lo (played by herself) returning late at night to her motel room. As she walks across the parking lot and up the stairs, she starts laughing maniacally, then screams in rage and crying shortly after (Fairy Dust - Chapter I).\n\nLorna (Lina Esco) speaks negatively of women, motherhood, and weddings the next morning while smoking a cigarette, and how much she enjoys being alone and independent. She overhears the couple next door arguing and yells at them through the wall, telling the husband to stop being \"a little bitch\" and accusing the wife of being a hypocrite for wanting her sexual needs met despite being a feminist. Lorna lays on the bed with Tove beside her, saying she has ways to numb the pain. On the bed, the two fornicate, cuddle, and smoke marijuana together (Influence).\n\nTove goes to a club that night. She wonders why \"it's not working anymore\" and that \"it used to be enough as long as it was all the time\" as she walks through the club. She notices Lorna across the room and starts dancing with the people in the room, forming bonds with them as they imitate her movements. Lorna screams at Tove in response, only for Tove to retaliate with the help of her new friends. Lorna and Tove eventually reconcile, kissing as the lights flash (Lady Wood). Lorna and Tove then drive back to the motel, recalling the first time they met, when Tove was in love with an older man who did not reciprocate his feelings, leaving Tove alone with Lorna. Lorna starts talking about how easy it is to die, which causes Tove's car to crash, knocking her out. Lorna is dousing the car in gasoline when she wakes up. Tove makes several attempts to flee the scene, only to end up back at the car wreck. Lorna kills herself by setting fire to her clothes (True Disaster).\n\nTove is later seen shaving her head in her bathroom. While her shaved head persona is burying Lorna in the desert, she dances around in the parking lot of the motel with the people she met at the club. As she sets her motel room on fire, Tove reveals that while she is grieving the loss of Lorna, she believes that pain is a gateway to more pleasure, with pain removing fear and anxiety from an uncertain situation (Cool Girl). She meets a guy and begins a relationship with him while in the desert, and the two return to the motel to have sex (Vibes). She sits outside her room afterward, processing everything that has happened. Tove says in a voiceover that she feels like no one knows who she is.\n\nTove is seen masturbating on her bed with Lorna watching her in a scene during the credits (Bitches).\n\nCast[]\n\nTove Lo as herself\n\nLina Esco as Lorna\n\nDanny Axley as Desert Dancer\n\nDancers[]\n\nAngelica Dewitt\n\nSavannah Harrison\n\nTy Wells\n\nJosue De La Vega\n\nFilm[]\n\nRelease[]\n\nOn October 31, 2016, the film was released on Tove Lo's Vevo and YouTube accounts. The video was taken down from YouTube the same day due to its sexual content. Lo responded on Twitter, saying, \"So I did release #FairyDust today but it's been taken down cause of @YouTubes policies on sexual content. HA. #imnotevennaked\"."
