October 3 - 26, Tuesday-Saturday, 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Closed October 21.\n\nOut of the Dust is told through ghosts of Manzanar Detention Camp who come to life through the poetry of Janice Mirikitani, the music of Miles Lassi and Paul Chihara, and the Japanese American folk dance “Ei Ja Nai Ka” (lit., “Ain’t it good?”) written by PJ Hirabayashi. After the closing of the camps, who and what memories were left behind in the windy dust-laden desert of Manzanar?\n\nOut of the Dust is a film dedicated to the memory of our friend and collaborator, Japanese American concentration camp survivor Janice Mirikitani."
