        "text": "Kit Harington is back on our screens in new movie Blood for Dust which has confirmed its first UK screening.\n\nThe action-thriller will hold its UK premiere at Raindance Film Festival on November 2, following its world premiere earlier this year at Tribeca. Tickets are on sale now for its UK premiere if you fancy checking it out.\n\nBlood for Dust centres on traveling salesman Cliff (Scoot McNairy) who finds himself on a dangerous path after a chance encounter with Ricky (Harington), a colleague from his past.\n\nCheck out the first-look images for Blood for Dust below:\n\nLast November, Harington teased that fans will be able to see a different side of him in Blood for Dust, saying that his character is a \"pretty gnarly dude\".\n\n\"For the last couple of years, I'm trying to — and that's another reason why I wanted to play this role — take roles that I'm a bit scared about doing.\n\n\"It's fun playing a baddie, I think. I spent a long time playing the epitome of a good, honest human, trying to do the right thing that everyone's rooting for. And maybe this is a reaction to the length of time I was doing that.\"\n\nFollowing its world premiere at Tribeca, Blood for Dust debuted with a decent 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from its first reviews, with Variety among those praising the performances of Harington and McNairy.\n\nBack in July, Harington and his wife Rose Leslie welcomed their second child together, following the birth of their son in February 2021.\n\nWhen he revealed that Leslie was pregnant with their second child, Harington said he was \"terrified\".\n\n\"With the first baby, you're like walking on clouds and dancing through fields of daisies for nine months – well, the man is anyway,\" he shared. \"But this time, the reality check comes much shorter. You get practical real quick.\""
