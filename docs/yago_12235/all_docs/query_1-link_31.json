        "text": "A mysterious magical drifter killer known as Dust Devil roams the desert searching for his next victim in this South African horror thriller from Richard Stanley. Asphalt kissy kissy. Kodak moment. Bad shit usually happens under a full moon. Tit grab. Neck snap. Snuggle buddies. The Dust Devil character has the creepiness of Rutger Hauer's John Ryder from The Hitcher and the suave swagger of Billy Zane's The Collector from Demon Knight. Burn, Motherfucker, Burn. Bitch slap. Choo choo train. Cows that like to moo. Bootleg RoboCop Robert John Burke makes an awesomely awesome badass drifter. Sharp razor. Smart owl. Chelsea Field is an underrated hottie. Zakes Mokae is the motherfucker. Autopsy yucky yuck. Joe smokes too much ganja and…\n\nSome films are the stuff of legend because they are beastly gory, others because of their impact. And one film is a legend because it's been under the radar for far too long.\n\n'Devil delivers almost-epic horror: Combining African spiritualism, horror mysticism and shamanistic imagery drenched in red dust and yellow sand, it feels like a spaghetti western version of Blade Runner with a dash of Carlos Castaneda.\n\nWhen it first hit video stores in '93 it was barely noticed. Although heavily butchered by the Weinsteins, there has always been something deeply special about 'Devil. Underground horror circles were the first to celebrate it, and it was only a matter of time before it started building its number of loyal…\n\nSun-scorched surrealism abounds in the sand-blasted environs of South Africa. Here, Richard Stanley draws inspiration from the legend of Nhadiep, which had previously inspired the British film Windprints, released in 1989. Nhadiep is a name attributed to an elusive serial killer (responsible for a string of brutal ritualistic murders) who was active in Namibia in the early 1980s. The killer's elusiveness led to some degree of mythologizing, with locals believing him to have the ability to shapeshift in order to avoid detection, which is the element Stanley focuses on, weaving a surreal and slow-burn tale about a supernatural serial killer.\n\nIt's difficult to classify or categorize this film in any way. It's perhaps a stretch to call it a horror…\n\nI first saw this film on a dusty summer's day in 1992 in a small screening put on by a local film enthusiast, who managed to persuade Richard Stanley to bring the only extant copy of this film down to our neck of the woods. In truth, it can't have been that hard to persuade Stanley to do anything at that point: having sold his house to finance the post-production, he was sleeping on park benches and was wearing the coat from the film, which he claimed was his only remaining possession. He talked passionately whilst smoking a spliff, and left a lasting impression on my 15 year old self.\n\nThe version I originally saw is probably lost forever, but…\n\nRichard Stanley's second feature swaps the dreary claustrophobic ambiance of Hardware for the bright, vast expanse of the African desert. I saw this film some twenty years ago and really didn't like it at all. However, this rewatch confirms that Dust Devil is a much better film than I remember (maybe because I watched the \"final cut\" this time?) The plot concerns a mythical demon in human form who roams the desert killing people. The film is constantly mysterious, ambiguous and meandering. Atmosphere overrides plot at every point; so much of the film is location shots and musical cues. The style is sort of psychedelic western meets African spiritualism enthused horror. It is unique and captivating to watch. The legend…\n\n\"Fuck superior forces...when you're dead you're dead.\" - Wendy,\n\nThis, is an experience. In a dusty and remote area, there is a demon named after a handheld vacuum, and he steals souls and woos the ladies.\n\nFor the first ten minutes of this movie I considered whether I was just imagining this film, but then people started talking and I settled down. There are all sorts of choral music, weird as fuck narration about spirits, weird gore, and sex with demons. The fun parts are very fun but I kept waiting for this to be better, and it never happened for me.\n\nBTW: Add the Dust Devil to the list of characters that I would love to see played by…\n\n“You’ve got to stop thinking like a white man, and think like a man instead.”\n\nThe pain of the white man lies in our imprisonment within the flesh, perpetually spiritually trapped within the material world that contains the very concept of the flesh in a viselike construct of immutable certainty. An inconsequential existence derived from nothing and devoid of meaning, doomed to expire and forever be denied an eternal destination.\n\nWe don’t even rate damnation.\n\n“I’m from the other side of the mirror.”\n\nThe Prophet Man’s got a needle in his hand, draws his dreams from your soul, bleeding minds into sand. God as a possibility for us has evaporated entirely, like a dustbowl town littered with bombed-out houses and…"
