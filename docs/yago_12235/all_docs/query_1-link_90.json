        "text": "The Grapes of Wrath, American film, released in 1940, that is John Ford’s acclaimed adaptation of John Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the Great Depression.\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath centres on the Joad family, hardworking farmers who have lost everything in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in the 1930s. Seeking better opportunities, they decide to make the arduous trek to California. Their situation, however, fails to improve as the Joads struggle to find work. At one point, Tom Joad (played by Henry Fonda), the eldest son and an ex-convict, attends a meeting about unions. The event is raided, and Tom accidentally kills a guard while trying unsuccessfully to protect his friend Casy. Wanted by the authorities, Tom is forced to leave the family to escape arrest.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz\n\nFord received an Academy Award for his direction, and The Grapes of Wrath is widely regarded as one his best works. The film bears many of Ford’s hallmarks: the importance of family and community, a strong moral code, and an evocative use of landscape and cinematography. Fonda’s portrayal of Tom earned him an Oscar nomination, and Jane Darwell won an Academy Award as the family’s resilient matriarch. Tom’s soliloquy on the poor, reflecting his heartfelt empathy for their plight, remains one of the most famous scenes in film history:\n\nI’ll be all around in the dark. I’ll be everywhere. Wherever you can look, wherever there’s a fight, so hungry people can eat, I’ll be there. Wherever there’s a cop beatin’ up a guy, I’ll be there. I’ll be in the way guys yell when they’re mad. I’ll be in the way kids laugh when they’re hungry and they know supper’s ready, and when the people are eatin’ the stuff they raise and livin’ in the houses they build, I’ll be there, too."
