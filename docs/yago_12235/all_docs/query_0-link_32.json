        "text": "We’ve been selecting and curating films from all over the world since 2008 in Tallahassee. Here’s some of our favorite screening highlights.\n\n2018 Tallahassee Film Festival\n\nThe 2018 Tallahassee Film Festival featured a packed 3 days with over 90 films and over 50 attending filmmakers from around the world. The 2018 program was a diverse, funny and thoughtful collection of Official Selections from around the world and Spotlight films direct from major festivals like Sundance, Toronto and Berlin. The Opening Night film was the outrageous political satire The Misogynists, a wicked dissection of America in the age of Donald Trump directed by Onur Tukel, and the Closing Night film was a secret screening of the bold film Savage Youth, from one of American indie cinema’s most promising new directors Michael Curtis Johnson. The 2018 festival program also featured an incredible selection of films made by, starring and centered around women, as well as a bevy of films dealing exceptionally well with a range of topical issues from race to gender inequality to gun violence to political impacts, such as the post-Brexit feelings of many people in the UK.\n\nHere’s some of our favorite screening highlights from 2008-2017.\n\nContemporary Color\n\nThe art of color guard is paired with contemporary musicians in this 2015 event staged by David Byrne at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center. The color guard’s synchronized dance is paired with performers including St. Vincent, Nelly Furtado and Ad-Rock.\n\nDirected by Turner Ross & Bill Ross IV\n\nCollective: Unconscious\n\nA man and his grandmother hide out from a broadcast; a suicidal Grim Reaper hosts a children’s TV show; the formerly incarcerated remember and reinterpret their first days of freedom; a suburban mom’s life is upturned by the beast growing inside of her; and a high school gym teacher runs drills from inside a dormant volcano.\n\nDirected by Frances Bodomo, Josephine Decker, Lauren Wolkstein, Lily Baldwin, Daniel Patrick Carbone\n\nA Poem is a Naked Person\n\nAn ineffable mix of unbridled joy and vérité realism, the film presents the beloved singer-songwriter, and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, Leon Russell as filmed by documentarian Les Blank between 1972 and 1974. This singular film about an artist and his community never had an official theatrical release and attained legendary status. After more than forty years, it can finally be seen and heard in all its rough beauty.\n\nDirected by Les Blank\n\nKumiko, The Treasure Hunter\n\nFrustrated with her mundane life, a Tokyo office worker (Rinko Kikuchi) becomes obsessed with the fictional Coen Bros. movie, Fargo, that she mistakes for a documentary. Fixating on the scene where stolen cash is buried in North Dakota, she travels to America to find it.\n\nDirected by David Zellner\n\nThe Great Invisible\n\nThe Deepwater Horizon crisis is seen through the perspectives of oil company executives, survivors and Gulf Coast residents who experienced it firsthand.\n\n*Proceeds from the show went to benefit the Emerald Coast Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation.\n\nDirected by Margaret Brown\n\nStop Making Sense\n\nDirector Jonathan Demme captures the frantic energy and artsy groove of Talking Heads in this groundbreaking concert movie shot over the course of three nights at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre in 1983.\n\nDirected by Jonathan Demme\n\nRevenge of the Mekons\n\nThe history of the British punk band from its creation in 1977 to its current tour. Featuring interviews with celebrated fans, from author Jonathan Franzen to film director Mary Harron to comedian/musician Fred Armisen, the film reveals how, four decades into an ever-evolving career, punk’s reigning contrarians continue to make bold, unpredictable music while staying true to the punk ethos.\n\nDirected by Joe Angio\n\nScarlet’s Witch\n\nAlienated by her peers, a girl finds an escape from her loneliness in the forest, where she meets a mysterious witch. She refuses the offer of magic at first, but maintains the friendship into her college years. Local filmmaker F.C. Rabbath creates a unique mystery shot on location in Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nWritten & directed by F.C. Rabbath\n\n20,000 Days on Earth\n\nA therapist’s questions and a visit to a voluminous archive propel a dramatization of a day in the life of musician and cultural icon Nick Cave. With startlingly frank insights and an intimate portrayal of the artistic process, the film examines what makes us who we are, and celebrates the transformative power of the creative spirit. Winner of British Independent Film Award Douglas Hickox Award (for Directorial Debut).\n\nDirected by Jane Pollard & Iain Forsyth\n\nWild Canaries\n\nA couple living in Brooklyn suspects foul play when a neighbor in a rent-controlled apartment suddenly dies. Packed with hilarious trench coat-clad stakeouts and antic-filled sleuthing, this film is a charming throwback that tips its hat to Hitchcock, Allen and Altman (to name a few)!\n\nDirected by Lawrence Michael Levine\n\nThe Day it Snowed in Miami\n\nA powerful documentary chronicling South Florida’s role in the LGBT-rights movement. Produced in association with the Miami Herald Media Company, the film examines the 1977 tug-of-war over a human rights Miami-Dade County ordinance that set the stage for a polemic debate between pro-gay activists and opponents led by entertainer/activist Anita Bryant.\n\nDirected by Joe Cardona\n\nPing Pong Summer\n\nIn 1985 a summer vacation in Ocean City, Md., changes the life of a shy white teen (Marcello Conte) who’s obsessed with table tennis and hip-hop music.

Directed by FSU-alum Kat Candler and adapted from her short film of the same title, this engrossing drama also stars Aaron Paul and Juliette Lewis.\n\nDirected by Kat Candler\n\nA Hard Day’s Night\n\nThe Beatles, in their feature film debut, one of the greatest rock-and-roll comedy adventures ever. The film takes on the just-left-of-reality style of mock-documentary, following “a day in the life” of John, Paul, George, and Ringo as fame takes them by storm. In honor of the 50th anniversary of the film, we premiered a fully restored negative with 4k resolution and a digitally restored soundtrack to a sold out Tallahassee audience on an IMAX screen.\n\nDirected by Richard Lester\n\nIt Felt Like Love\n\nLila (Gina Piersanti), a lonely teen from Gravesend, fabricates a story about dating Sammy — a thug — and becomes fixated on it happening.

The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival as part of the Directors’ Fortnight section on May 17, 2013, where it won the FIPRESCI Prize. It was nominated for the John Cassavetes Award at the 2015 Independent Spirit Awards. Director Jeremy Saulnier funded production on the film through a successful Kickstarter campaign, which MTV.com called “the perfect example of what crowdfunding can accomplish.”\n\nDirected by Jeremy Saulnier\n\nVisitors\n\nFilmed in a unique and memorable style and taking inspiration from similarly powerful works like the Qatsi Trilogy, Godfrey Reggio this time sets his sights on capturing humanity’s trancelike relationship with technology produces massive effects. The film was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. The musical score for Visitors was composed by Philip Glass, who previously collaborated with director Godfrey Reggio on the Qatsi Trilogy.\n\nDirected by Godfrey Reggio\n\nThe Great Beauty\n\nOne of our personal favorites here at the Tallahassee Film Festival, this astonishingly beautiful love letter to growing old, went on to win numerous awards including the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Journalist Jep Gambardella has charmed and seduced his way through the lavish nightlife of Rome for decades. When his 65th birthday coincides with a shock from the past, Jep finds himself unexpectedly taking stock of his life, and looking past the extravagant nightclubs, parties, and cafés to find Rome in all its glory: a timeless landscape of absurd, exquisite beauty.\n\nDirected by Paolo Sorrentino\n\nTeenage\n\nAn expertly crafted film essay directed by Matt Wolf and based on Jon Savage‘s book Teenage: The Creation of Youth Culture. In it, Wolf attempts to bring to life the “prehistory” of youth culture which evolved into the concept of teenage culture in the 1950s (and beyond), by carefully weaving archival footage from the era highlighting youth movements from around the world. German youth movements like the Wandervogel, the Hitler Youth, and the Swing Kids of Hamburg; anti-Nazi resistance group White Rose; the UK’s bright young things; and American youth movements such as the flappers, victory girls and Boy Scouts. The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nDirected by Matt Wolf\n\nHide Your Smiling Faces\n\nTommy (Ryan Jones) and Eric (Nathan Varnson) spend their summer days having fun until death enters their lives. Winner of the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film Still Awaiting American Distribution. The Tallahassee premiered this film as part of our New Faces of Film series which spotlights what we perceive to be the next generation of important filmmakers.\n\nDirected by Daniel Patrick Carbone\n\nBad Milo!\n\nA stressed-out man (Ken Marino) discovers that a tiny demon lives in his intestine, and that excessive anxiety causes the creature to escape and slaughter the man’s tormentors.

The film is set in and around Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum. The Tallahassee Film Festival was honored to present this accomplished film at the FSU Museum of Fine Arts accompanied by an art exhibit and installation of chamber musicians playing solo pieces throughout the evening.\n\nDirected by Jem Cohen\n\nBluebird\n\nIn an isolated Maine logging town, a woman’s tragic mistake shatters her community and yields unexpected consequences. Edmands finished the first draft of the screenplay in 2009. During the film’s production, it received assistance and funding from the Sundance Institute, the San Francisco Film Society and the Swedish Film Institute.
