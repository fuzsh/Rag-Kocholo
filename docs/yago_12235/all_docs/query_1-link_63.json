        "text": "The animation is just next level in The Looking Planet. Who needs God when you have an alien race with a plan? Photo courtesy of DUST\n\nThis beautifully, almost endearing short film about an alien race whose sole job is to create universes out of matter and debris leftover from creating planets is just a soothing, intelligent escape from all the chaos going on in the world today. The soundtrack is equally beautiful, the run time is just under 17 minutes, and once it’s finished I highly recommend checking out the DUST channel on YouTube. They have dozens of short, independently made sci-fi movies that run the gamut from dystopian and end of the world scenarios to AI going horribly wrong to viruses and aliens taking over the planet, etc. Definitely worth your time.\n\nThe full movie can be seen here (it’s already available to the public) and I really hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
