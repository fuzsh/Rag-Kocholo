        "text": "According to Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, the philosophies of the distant future – 700 years into the future, to be precise – will be built of the musical teachings of two teenage slacker doofuses (“We are Wild Stallyns!”). And why not?\n\nThirty years after they first punctuated their bodacious sentences with some sweet air-guitar riffs, the mantra of Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan is something we could all do with a bit more of. Be excellent to each other, indeed. But between an out-there time travel concept and financial disaster, Bill and Ted almost never made it to the big screen, let alone inspire the future of humanity.\n\nDirector Stephen Herek, taking a break from the shooting the rebooted MacGyver series, seems both delighted and surprised to still be talking about Bill and Ted. “When I read the script I thought, ‘Oh my god,’ he laughs, “‘this is either going to be the funniest movie or a complete disaster.’ There would be no in between…”\n\nThough characters are now immortalised as stars Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves, the original original Bill and Ted were the film’s writers Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson. The longtime friends created the characters as part of an improv group. At first it was Bill and Ted and Bob, but the third actor “didn’t seem to like doing Bob so much”. The duo were conceived as idiot teenagers who knew nothing about the world and current affairs (“Woah, Iraq, that’s bad.”) But ultimately they were good dudes.\n\n“They’re nice to everyone, whether it’s Napoleon or the nerdy guy who sits next to them in history class,” said Matheson, speaking on a behind the scenes feature. “They don’t care. Honestly because they don’t know enough to care.”\n\n“That was the original concept,” said Solomon about outlining the script. “It was, ‘let’s put them against the greatest people who ever lived and have them treat these people like the person they see across the counter at the 7 Eleven.’”\n\nThe eventual story would see Bill and Ted about to flunk history, putting the distant future of the entire planet – well, San Dimas, California, at least – in peril. Cue the arrival of Rufus (George Carlin) from the year 2688 to put the duo on a time-travelling adventure to round-up historical figures – Napoleon, Abraham Lincoln, Billy the Kid, Beethoven, Joan of Arc, Socrates (“So-craytes”), Genghis Khan, and Sigmund Freud – to help deliver a totally non-bogus history report.\n\nStephen Herek joined the early stages of production after Warner Bros invited him to a meeting (though Warner Bros eventually dropped the film, later picked up by The De Laurentiis Entertainment Group). Fresh off the modest success of his debut film, the horror/sci-fi/comedy Critters, Herek was nervous about the meeting. “Critters was on the heels on Gremlins and I thought I was in trouble,” he laughs. “They said, ‘We think you’d be really good for this movie called Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure.’ Two months later, on my doorstep there’s Bill and Ted. It was laugh out loud funny.”\n\nIt that early version of the script, Bill and Ted travelled through time in a “1980s party van”. Herek suggested changing it to the now-iconic phone booth. “I know the phone booth is very Doctor Who-like,” says Herek. “But I could never fully understand how the van worked. With the phone they could punch in a number and it would take you to a period of time. Also visually I could understand it because of the circuits of time became like travelling though fibre optics.”\n\nEven more crucial was the casting of Bill S. Preston Esq and Ted Theodore Logan, described by the San Dimas people of 700 years to the future as “the two great ones” but by their creators Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson as, “Sort of idiot savants… less of the savant… leaning on the idiot side.”\n\nThe key to the characters is the rhythm of their stupidity: the speech, part surfer dude, part stoner, part metal head; the physical movements, all low-slung walks and exaggerated, heartfelt gestures; and an absolute lack of self-awareness at the delivery of their boneheaded musings (“Bill, strange things are afoot at the Circle K”). The casting process was so long that by the time it had finished, Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter had become real-life friends.\n\n“My casting director saw about 500 kids,” says Herek. “The chemistry was really important. Also, the movie is very over the top but I wanted the delivery to be – and I can’t believe I’m using this word for Bill and Ted – ‘realistic’, so it wasn’t like they were trying to be funny.”\n\nHerek was immediately sold on Keanu Reeves (“He just had the ‘Woah… no way, dude!’”) and mixed-and-matched potential actors to play opposite him. Stand-up Pauly Shore was also in the running. “He was funny as hell,” says Herek. “But in many ways Bill and Ted are a call back to Martin and Lewis or Abbot and Costello – those kind of comedy genes where you have a straight man. That’s what I thought Bill would be – a little bit more in charge, a bit more of a leader. Alex really rose to the top. I love Paulie dearly but he was a lot like Ted.”\n\nWith the spirit of Excellent Adventure rooted so firmly in the hair metal of its day (Herek admits to listening to Van Halen “to get me into that vibe” while putting together shot lists) they set out to cast as many rock ‘n’ rollers as possible in supporting roles. ZZ Top were in the line to play futuristic high council AKA “The Three Most Important People in the World”, but the parts were eventually played by legendary Springsteen saxophonist Clarence Clements, The Motels lead singer Martha Davis, and The Tubes frontman Fee Waybill. Elsewhere, more than a millennium earlier, Jane Wiedlin, guitarist from the Go-Gos and singer of 1988 pop hit Rush Hour, played Joan of Arc.\n\nThe role of Rufus – Bill and Ted’s super-cool, solo-rocking mentor – went to acerbic anti-establishment stand-up George Carlin. “Rufus was written more for somebody like Eddie Van Halen,” says Herek. “But sometimes when you’re on a first movie people don’t take you seriously. George had done a film with [Bill and Ted producers] Interscope prior to this so we went to George and he was enamoured with the part. Now I can’t think of anyone else doing it. He was fantastic to work with – a true gentleman and always prepared. He wanted to build a character.”\n\nThe real show-stealer is Terry Camilleri as Napoleon Bonaparte. Left in modern-day San Dimas with Ted’s younger brother, he behaves like a real, erm, Napoleon at the bowling alley, water slide park, and ice cream parlour. “He got into it full bore,” says Herek about the actor. “He wore the costume constantly and even when we went out to have drinks, just for sh-ts and giggles he’d act like Napoleon.”\n\nThe shoot itself – which took place in Arizona (doubling for San Dimas) and Europe – was, as Bill and Ted would say, excellent. But it would take almost two years for the film to make it onto the big screen after a most non-excellent turn of events: The De Laurentiis Entertainment Group went bankrupt while the film was in the cutting stages of post production. Equipment was being removed from around Herek while he was editing the work print.\n\n“It was sunshine and rainbows until the money went dry,” says Herek. “That’s when you find out who your friends are… I could write a book about the making of Bill & Ted and it would show all of Hollywood, both its pluses and minuses. Dino [De Laurentiis] was trying to do whatever he possibly could to get money. He put all his film library – everything that was made but also movies that were unreleased – on sale for one giant lump sum. Later he broke them off into components, including Bill & Ted.\n\n“But the entire community – and that’s not an exaggeration, every studio in town – watched the rough cut and it was like I was the anti-Christ. They said, ‘It was one of the worst films ever made, nobody’s ever going to watch this thing.’ I got a phone call from our people at Interscope saying, ‘This film’s never going to be released, it will go straight to video, it’s never going to see the light of day.’ It was only my second movie and I thought my career was over. Literally a week later I got a call saying we were back in business. The De Laurentiis people went to Nelson Entertainment and they loved it when I showed it to them. They got the movie for a song, so we were able to finish it.”\n\nWhen the film previewed to test audiences – including guests from studios – Herek describes a “giant about-face” from the industry. “It became a bidding war,” he says. “‘Oh my god, this is a fantastic film!’ It was the antithesis to what they said before. Eventually Orion got the movie but it was a long, arduous process and there were tremendous lows.”\n\nReleased on February 17 1989, it was hit and made $40 million at the US box office. Coming at the tail end of a cycle of teen comedy fantasies – it owes an obvious debt to the zeitgeisty likes of Weird Science and Back to the Future – Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure is strangely both timeless and a relic of its filmmaking era.\n\nMore episodic than a traditional adventure – finding the humour in putting Bill and Ted in various historical eras, or putting historical figures in a San Dimas shopping mall – the film’s real antagonist is Bill and Ted’s own stupidity. But it’s anchored on the profoundly pure hearts and charm of the idiot duo. Ironically, it has more to say about the future than we could have imagined in 1989.\n\n“The film overall is about guys who are just enjoying life,” says Herek. “It’s about how they are infectious and how they become masters of the universe in a religious way. I wanted to have the vibe of the film so you just want to give it a warm hug.\n\n“The intent behind ‘party on’, it’s the Bill and Ted way, to do unto others… It’s a very simple thing but it seems very complicated for the entire world to grasp.” (Their use of the word “f–g” doesn’t quite chime with the “Be excellent to each other” mantra, but you have to believe that Bill and Ted will have become more enlightened over the past 30 years.)\n\nBill remains the on-screen role that Alex Winter is best remembered for, though he’s more prolific as a director and documentary filmmaker, including last year’s The Panama Papers.\n\nFor Keanu, the Ted persona defined his early career, not helped by his dunderheaded character in Parenthood or FBI agent-turned-surfer dude in Point Break. Even in The Matrix, lines such as “I know kung-fu” are delivered with a slight undercurrent of “woah”. It feels like audiences are still partly swooning for modern-day Keanu – the lovable, occasionally nails-hard action man – because he’s Ted Theodore Logan all grown up.\n\nStephen Herek passed on the 1991 sequel – Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey, directed instead by Peter Hewitt. It sees the duo killed by “evil robot us’s”, beginning an adventure into the afterlife and back again. For Herek, the film – originally called Bill & Ted Go To Hell – was a shift in tone for the series. And he’s right, it’s darker, but is still a most triumphant sequel. A Seventh Seal-lampooning scene in which Bill and Ted play the Grim Reaper at Battleships, Cluedo, table top America football, and Twister is arguably the series’ sharpest comedy idea.\n\nTalk of a third movie has circulated for years and is finally in pre-production – Bill & Ted Face the Music. Part of Bill and Ted’s brilliance is that embody a sensibility of youth culture that somehow transcends eras, from 1989 to 2019. So can it really work with a pair of 50-year-old Wild Stallyns? If history tells us anything, it’s that the world needs Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan. As Abraham Lincoln would say, “Party on, dudes!”."
