DUST, is an English-language production filmed with Luxembourg money and on location in Luxembourg. Its story is set in an indefinite time, when most of humanity seems to have either died or disappeared. Two siblings, played by British thespians Olly Alexander and Catherine Steadman, live a life of relative tranquility in a large house in the abandoned countryside. Their daily routine is disturbed when another human being (Andrew Hawley) suddenly shows up. The film will be released in Luxembourg in November.

Jacoby’s 2005 short film Butterflies, adapted from an Ian McEwan short story, won the UIP Venezia award at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for a European Film Award.
