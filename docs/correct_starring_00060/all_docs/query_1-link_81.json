        "text": "I wonder if for Go Go Mania, they will edit out Jimmy Savile? The BBC and every other organization he was associated with have been going on to act like he never existed.\n\nRegardless of his lifestyle, erasing him from history is not going to solve anything. If they're gonna do that, they might as well ban A Hard Day's Night, because that film features another alleged pedophile in Wilfrid Brambell. Very hypocritical here.\n\nI have mentioned this before, and I will mention it again in this thread:\n\nA fun little fact I'd like to share about one of the performers in Go Go Mania that not very many people would know about:\n\nEarlier, TCM showed A Hard Day's Night, which Wilfrid Brambell starred in. In 1966, Susan Maughan, one of the performers in Go Go Mania recorded the title track to an obscure British spy spoof called Where the Bullets Fly, which Brambell starred in as a Train Guard. And here's the title track to Where the Bullets Fly, as recorded by Maughan.\n\nI love it! Very Goldfinger-esque!\n\nI would love to see TCM devote evenings to rock movies more often (a la AMC's long gone American Pop Saturday nights). There are lots of movies \"in limbo\" (with no DVD or home video release) that deserve to be rescued from the vaults & obscurity."
