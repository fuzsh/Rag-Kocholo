        "text": "First episode: January 5 1962\n\nLast episode: December 26 1974\n\n(by PETER TATCHELL, reprinted from LAUGH MAGAZINE #2, 1991)\n\nIn 1961, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson were Britain’s top comedy scriptwriters. For ten years they had supplied Tony Hancock with nearly all his material and the resultant Hancock’s Half Hour on radio and television provided the BBC with one of its greatest successes.\n\nHancock, though, craved international acceptance, and the disappointing response to the Galton and Simpson scripted The Rebel (re-titled Call Me Genius in America) led him to believe his talents would be better served by new writers more attuned to a different screen persona. As a result, there was a parting of the ways, with Hancock suffering a frustrating and ultimately tragic career decline, and Galton and Simpson achieving continued success with a television series where the writers were as famous as the lead actors.\n\nThe catalyst was a series of ten unrelated half-hours commissioned by the BBC under the title Comedy Playhouse and featuring such performers as Eric Sykes, Stanley Baxter, Peter Jones, Alfred Marks and Bernard Cribbins. When screened, however, the episode everyone talked about featured two virtual unknowns, Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H. Corbett. Titled The Offer, it dealt with the antagonistic love-hate relationship between two rag-and-bone men, the Steptoes of Shepherd’s Bush.\n\nAlbert, the father, is old but cunning and totally dependent on his son Harold to provide a livelihood by going out on the horse and cart and collecting the neighborhood junk. Harold, on the other hand, is the eternal optimist striving to improve his station and sample the good things in life (travel, the arts, financial success) but trapped in the squalid confines of Oil Drum Lane to look after the old man.\n\nAfter a decade of concentrating their efforts on the Hancock abode of Railway Cuttings, East Cheam, Galton and Simpson were delighted to be able to expand their outlook in ten different directions with the Playhouse series, and were somewhat annoyed when Tom Sloan (then head of BBC Light Entertainment) suggested the Steptoes were ideal for a series. After several months resisting the idea, the writers eventually relented and scripted a further five installments which were shown in mid-1962. (They did pen a further six Comedy Playhouse episodes the following year, but by then, the whole country was Steptoe-mad).\n\nComing from a radio background, Galton and Simpson relied heavily on dialogue in their television ventures, and Steptoe And Son is notable for the colourful repartee sprinkled throughout. Albert, in particular, was notorious for his earthy similes… describing an antique collector ‘bent as a boomerang’, sandwiches cut so small that ‘one burp and you’re empty’ , or pointing out the futility of Harold’s desire to keep a close watch on the nation’s financial situation with ‘you won’t find the economic pulse of the country where you keep your finger’.\n\nHarold is living through ‘the swinging sixties’ and wants to be part of the action before reaching the dreaded middle-age, but to Albert things are much as they were when he came back from the trenches of World War 1. Holidays have always meant Bognor Regis, and not Spanish beaches or Alpine chalets full of foreigners. Bulk buying may be all right for supermarkets, but he fails to see the sales potential of a cartload of coffins or false teeth. And as for all those arty-crafty feature films replete with sub-titles, he’d much rather The Monster From The Black Bog or Nudes Of 1964.\n\nSurprisingly, it is Albert who is the dab hand at sporting pursuits whether billiards, shuttle cock or even Karate. And as for games of chance like poker, just give him a smoke-filled room, a pack full of ‘Satan’s Army’ and a pair of his special reading glasses and the other players can look forward to a long walk home.\n\nHarold’s attempts to attract the female of the species are invariably thwarted by the actions of the old man, ever-vigilant at preserving the status quo of having Harold on hand to provide for him. In one celebrated instance, the sight of Albert eating pickled onions in the living room hip-bath sends an erstwhile ladyfriend scurrying homeward. Harold did actually make it to the altar on one occasion (‘Into the Valley of Death’ said Albert. ‘Would you like a blindfold?’) but the lady in question declined to take him for her wedded husband. Still, as the honeymoon was all booked, Albert went along in lieu.\n\nBy the end of the second series Steptoe And Son was attracting an audience of some 22 million people in Britain alone, and viewers around the world were soon clamoring for each new chapter of the Steptoe saga. The duo was also proving popular on the television sets at Buckingham Palace and on November 4th 1963 Brambell and Corbett performed a specially written sketch at that year’s Royal Variety Performance at the Prince Of Wales Theatre. They also took part in the Night of 100 Stars fundraiser at the London Palladium (both these routines can be heard on a Pye LP).\n\nBetween series, the actors were sought for movie roles as a result of their phenomenal popularity. Brambell had the key part of Paul McCartney’s grandfather in the first Beatles’ film A Hard Day’s Night, while Corbett gained starring roles in Ladies Who Do, The Bargee and Rattle Of A Simple Man.\n\nAfter only four brief series, ‘Steptoe And Son had become an acknowledged classic and it was decided to end it while still a success. So, on November 15 1965, after twenty-seven stories, Albert and Harold (and their horse Hercules) were to be led out to pasture. They weren’t to be totally retired, however, as BBC Radio adapted twenty-one of the scripts for broadcast.\n\nBy the end of the sixties British television had undergone quite a dramatic change. The reorganization of the commercial franchises had resulted in a new wave of comedy programs on both London Weekend and Thames, and the programs were now being made in colour. To meet the challenge, the BBC hierarchy made a number of decisions. One of them was to bring back the Steptoes.\n\nA fifth season of Steptoe And Son (now in colour) began in early 1970 with the show’s leading character (the character that led the cart, that is) being “killed off” before a word is uttered. Whether this was a new direction on the part of the writers, or due to the horse who acted the role getting a better offer from a glue factory remains unclear, but despite the cast change the Steptoes were back, as popular as ever.\n\nInspired by the cinema success of adaptations of such television favourites as On The Buses, Up Pompeii and Please Sir, Galton and Simpson scripted a movie version of their rag-and-bone men which was released in 1972. And like most film favourites, it spawned a sequel Steptoe And Son Ride Again in 1974.\n\nA further thirty colour Steptoe programs had aired by Christmas 1974 when the BBC again decided to end production, this time for good. Apart from the subsequent radio adaptations, and a newly scripted sketch Scotch On The Rocks, an era had ended.\n\nThere was one final encore for the characters when Brambell and Corbett toured Australia in 1977 with a cabaret act written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson. Five years later, in an ironical twist of fate, Harry H. Corbett succumbed to a heart attack (the malady continually being faked by the elder Steptoe). His partner Wilfrid Brambell died in 1985.\n\nRay Galton and Alan Simpson have yet to be bettered in a half-hour format, and the subtle mixture of comedy and pathos they created in Steptoe And Son easily survives the test of time. As a result of the many subsequent audio and video/dvd releases of the programmes, the artistry of Ray Galton, Alan Simpson, Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H. Corbett will not fade from our memories.\n\nWilfrid Brambell as Albert Steptoe, Harry H.
