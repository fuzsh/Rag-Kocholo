Just ask, I may have them.\n\nI also have the Complete Radio series (with 3 extras) on 1 disk as mp3 files - Â£3 for this disk.\n\nChristmas Special\n\nHarold can't bear having another Christmas at his home in Shepheards Bush with his Dad, so he books a holiday for himself in Spain.\n\nHe now has to explain this to Albert. As usual, Albert fakes a heart attack. He persuades Harold to stay at home. So Harold cancels the holiday, but insists on spending the money on a big party for Christmas day.\n\nHe invites nearly everyone he knows. It's Christmas day and Albert goes down with chicken pox. Harold then catches them. The guests arrive and know that there is a chicken pox epidemic and they all run away.\n\n1 - The Party\n\nSteptoe & Son Ride Again [feature film]\n\nAlbert and Harold Steptoe return to the big screen in another adventure that could well have spanned a shorter television episode.\n\nAs always Harold needs money and his decision to claim the life insurance of his father before he has died leads to a very odd and surreal set of events.\n\nOdd to say the least, the finale includes a series of macabre but funny misadventures such as being trapped inside a coffin?\n\nTop marks for humour with the training of the greyhound in earlier scenes but those with Diana Dors are dated saucy postcard-type scenes that didn't existed in the tv series.\n\nThe TV series was far more carefully written and beautifully acted by the two main players..\n\nThe Curse of Steptoe & Son\n\nJason Issacs was on top form as Corbett and Phil Davis was absolutely stunning as the tragic Wilfred Brambell all in all one of the best pieces of drama to grace the BBC in a long time.\n\nThe whole affair although telling a sometimes very dark tale was handled with a great deal of affection and care.\n\nCostumes and sets were spot on and the piece really gave you a feel for how writers and performers of that era behaved towards one another. Much like the actual show I regret this show having to end as it left me wanting more from two of the finest most underrated actors in the UK.\n\nWhen Steptoe Met Son\n\nThis documentary looks at the difficult off screen relation of actors Harry H. Corbett and Wilfrid Brambell who appear to hate one another during their years on screen (but this has been challenged by many who knew them personally).\n\nIt charts their rise to fame with \"Steptoe and Son\" in the early 60's, to their final falling out during an Australian stage show in the late 70's."
