        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nToday in 1964, the Beatles' first film, A Hard Day's Night, opened in 500 American theaters. Shot in cinema vérité style, the film portrays several days in the lives of the group. Following its U.K. and U.S. releases, A Hard Day's Night proved a financial and critical success. Time magazine rated it as one of the all-time great 100 films. British critic Leslie Halliwell described it as a \"comic fantasia with music; an enormous commercial success with the director trying every cinematic gag in the book\" and awarded it a full four stars; Roger Ebert described the film as \"one of the great life-affirming landmarks of the movies\", and added it to his list of The Great Movies.
