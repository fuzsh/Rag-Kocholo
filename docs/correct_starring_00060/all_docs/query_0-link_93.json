[1:25]\n\nSEX/NUDITY 1 - Sexual innuendo, some flirting and a little cleavage. John Lennon takes a bath and we see an old man in his skivvies.\n\nVIOLENCE/GORE 0 - None. Screaming teenagers and cops chase the Beatles a few times, but they seem to mean well.\n\nLANGUAGE 1 - A few insults and a couple of very mild obscenities.\n\nDISCUSSION TOPICS - Crazed fans, the '60s, people over 30, truancy.\n\nMESSAGE - The Beatles were mischievous, irreverent, and full of joy.\n\nCAVEATS\n\nBe aware that while we do our best to avoid spoilers it is impossible to disguise all details and some may reveal crucial plot elements.\n\nWe've gone through several editorial changes since we started covering films in 1992 and older reviews are not as complete & accurate as recent ones; we plan to revisit and correct older reviews as resources and time permits.\n\nOur ratings and reviews are based on the theatrically-released versions of films; on video there are often Unrated, Special, Director's Cut or Extended versions, (usually accurately labelled but sometimes mislabeled) released that contain additional content, which we did not review.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nSee ratings & reviews at Critics.com\n\nFILTER by RATINGS\n\nDid you know you can now filter searches by any combination of ratings? Just go to our search page or use the search bar, with or without a keyword, from the top navigation menu. Move sliders from 0-10 in any combination, check and uncheck MPAA ratings and use keywords to further filter results -- please let us know what you think.\n\nTHE ASSIGNED NUMBERS\n\nUnlike the MPAA we do not assign one inscrutable rating based on age but 3 objective ratings for SEX/NUDITY, VIOLENCE/GORE & LANGUAGE on a scale of 0 to 10, from lowest to highest depending on quantity & context |more|\n\nFIND US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFollowFollow\n\nFollowFollow\n\nadvertisement\n\nCOPYRIGHT POLICY\n\nPrint a page, share with friends, and yes, please go ahead and email links.
