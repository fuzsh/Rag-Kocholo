        "text": "\"I think because I loved films I was less embarrassed than the others to be in one; John really got into the movie, too. I felt a lot of the time that George didn't want to be there. It was something he was doing because we were doing it.\"\n\nRingo\n\nIn this, The Beatles' first feature film, the band must use all their guile and wit to reach a scheduled television performance whilst avoiding their pursuing fans and press. This is in spite of Paul's troublemaking grandfather (Wildfred Brambell), and Ringo's arrest.\n\nA Hard Day's Night has been praised as a benchmark for music film production, and remains influential to this day. Director Dick Lester used a documentary style of filming to capture the claustrophobia of Beatlemania, and writer Alun Owen delivered a script which epitomised the quick-witted humour of the band. Comedy and music are combined to make this pastiche of a day in the life of The Beatles during 1964."
