        "text": "Wilfred Brambell (1912â€“1985) was an actor, best known for his part in the TV sitcom Steptoe and Son. Born 22 March 1912 in Dublin, he worked as a part time reporter and part-time actor after leaving school. Brambell had roles in TV and film from 1947.\n\nHe married Molly Josephine Hall in 1948. The couple divorced after his wife had a child by the lodger.\n\nHe played Paul McCartney's fictitious grandfather in the Beatles' 1964 film, A Hard Day's Night.\n\nIn November 1962 Brambell was arrested in Shepherds Bush and charged with importuning for immoral purposes. He was given a conditional discharge but the case was well reported in the national newspapers.\n\nIn later years Brambell used to visit Hong Kong and enjoy the gay scene there. He met and supported a Malayan young man, and the young man lived in Brambell's Pimlico flat for twenty years [1].\n\nBrambell died as a result of cancer at his home in London, aged 72 on 18 January 1985. He was cremated on 25 January 1985 at Streatham Park Cemetery, where his ashes were scattered.\n\nReferences"
