        "text": "1972 In Review - January\n\n#2\n\nAlbert Steptoe and his son Harold are junk dealers. Harold meets a stripper, marries her and takes her home. Albert, of course, is furious and tries every trick he knows to drive the new bride from the household.\n\nThis film was a staple at every Christmas time in my household as a child. It’s been a long time since I had watched it but it’s still as funny as it ever was. Some things date terribly but the writings here still hilarious. I loved the TV show it was based on, despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly…\n\nThe 1972 - Oh no five-oh challenge #32\n\n\"You're worse than a fly around a cow's arsehole!!\"\n\nIt might seem a strange film to choose, given I never quite saw the funny in the long running TV series, but I know for a fact this was on at the local cinema on the day I was born. Other films were on but I would have to dig out the local rag my mum kept from that day to find out what they were...but I always remember this.\n\nThroughout the seventies it was the done thing to give your most successful sitcoms or drama shows an outing in the cinema. Sitcom wise you had Hammer churning out Nearest and Dearest, Man…\n\nThis was a real disappointment. I have fond memories of the original black and white TV series but this feature length piece is a real struggle to get through. Wilfred Brambell's character Steptoe senior has no redeeming qualities whatsoever which leaves you with no sympathy for Steptoe junior's (Harry H. Corbett) plight as the downtrodden but faithful son. For me the only highlight was the lovely Carolyn Seymour as Steptoe junior's wife.\n\nAfter watching \"A Hard Day's Night\" this morning, I needed to find a way to keep the Wilfrid Brambell train rolling somehow. That's when I remembered that I inexplicably owned a copy of the STEPTOE & SON movie. I had only ever seen one or two episodes of the series for cultural context, and never even familiarized myself with the famous Norman Lear remake. I knew that the reputation for these British sitcoms turned into feature films wasn't all that great so my expectations were about as low as they could possibly be. Maybe I was just feeling generous today because I found this to be rather enjoyable. This was packed with a lot more plot than I would have expected…\n\nSlumped in front of the tv flicking about this was about to start and so it sat. Hands up, I am a Galton and Simpson admirer. They do small people with pretentions well, usually.\n\nThis is a spin off from the long running telly sitcom. Unlike Alf Garnet in the spin off Till Death Do Us Part (which weighs in as a creditable poor man’s This Happy Breed), Harold and Albert are so shallow and blinkered that any comedy there is drowns in a sea of sadness. There are precious few chuckles in this.\n\nAlbert Steptoe owns a scrap business. His son Harold does the heavy work and Albert keeps the yard and house running. Albert excerpts constant emotional pressure…\n\nI have a strange fascination for this period in UK history when low budget comedies with a bawdy edge were massive money-makers. So much so that a bunch of TV shows got given a slightly bigger budget to make feature-length episodes shot on film that could be theatrically released. On the Buses kicked them off and surprised everyone with how much money it made. But the only other example that was successful enough to warrant a sequel was this.\n\nI was hugely looking forward to this. Steptoe and Son is one of the greatest TV comedies of all time and Galton and Simpson are one of my favourite writing teams. I was very keen to see what they'd do with…\n\nThe ideal date night movie if you want to ditch your girlfriend. She will be so disgusted she will dump you. This disgusting film is now on BritBox. An elderly friend wanted me to put it on for him. It begins with a torrent of racist abuse that even seems to have crossed a line with the BtitBox subtitlers, as the subtitles only start once the comments about foreigners have ended. Even my elderly friend was disgusted by Albert brushing horse manure into a bucket with his bare hand, and later tucking into a sandwich without washing his hands. But he laughed when Albert had to bathe in the kitchen sink and wiped his bottom with some net curtain, horrifying…\n\nHarold (Harry H Corbett) meets exotic dancer Zita (Carolyn Seymour) at the local workman’s club and promptly gets engaged much to the annoyance of Dad Albert (Wilfred Bramble). Soon they are married but Steptoe senior tries every trick to separate them. Nice cameo by Mike Reid as the comedian. Full of 70s sexist overtones. The first of two big screen adaptations of the BBC Television comedy. The story is simple and is a stretch to keep it entertaining for 90 minutes even with the talents of Galton and Simpson. The only saving grace is when the baby comes into it. Just for the completists. Poor."
