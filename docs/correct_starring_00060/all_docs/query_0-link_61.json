        "text": "This film follows the harsh schedule of the Beatles at their height of fame. The Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr) perform in front of audiences including a plethora of screaming, crying girls who practically swoon as some of their most famous songs are song. Over the course of the movie the four young men spend their time trying to avoid the hurricane of fans that seem to follow the everywhere, passing time in hotel rooms, and in transit, taking cars and trains from one place to another. While this is a movie about fame and hero worship, it also touches on the hardships that come with celebrity."
