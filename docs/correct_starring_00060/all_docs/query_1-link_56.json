        "text": "The first cinematic outing for Galton and Simpson’s rag and bone men, Steptoe (Wilfrid Brambell) and Son (Harry H Corbett) after a decade of television success.\n\nOne of many tv spin-offs which hit the big screen in the UK in the 1970s, usually to the dismay of the critics but the delight of the public.\n\nThis is the original UK (country of origin) poster for this 1972 film. It has become very sought after in recent years, as a result of the continuing popularity of the series on which it was based and the wonderful artwork by Putzu, capturing the stars and the storyline.\n\nWe have a massive collection of comedy titles from the 1930s to the 1970s, from Chaplin to Carry On and more. Much of it isn’t yet on this Website, so please call or email us if there’s something comic you’re looking for in particular."
