        "text": "John, Paul, George, and Ringo are gorgeous, carefree, and still somewhat innocent in the first film featuring the Beatles. The 1960s are in full swing and the British Invasion has become a reality – pop culture will never be the same again. Timeless Festival is proud to host the first Polish screening of a reconstruction of Richard Lester’s iconic smash-hit, brimming with songs and gags. Here, the famous four play themselves, or, rather, the comedy versions of young celebs besieged by fans. Thirty-six hours in the band’s life are infused with new-wave buoyancy, British humour, and documentary swagger, all accompanied by songs such as Can’t Buy Me Love, She Loves You, and And I Love Her. After all, as John Higgs wrote recently in the parallel history of James Bond and the Beatles: in the postwar battle for the nation’s soul, agent 007 represented death and the Liverpool musicians represented love.\n\nSebastian Smoliński\n\nRichard Lester (b. 1932) is an American director. He moved to London in 1953 and began work as a director in independent television. When The Beatles were contracted to make a film, A Hard Day’s Night, they chose Lester from a list of possible directors. In 1965 he directed the second Beatles film, Help! He then went on to direct several quintessential films of the “swinging sixties”, including the sex comedy The Knack…And How to Get It (1965) and the satire How I Won the War (1967).\n\n4K restoration."
