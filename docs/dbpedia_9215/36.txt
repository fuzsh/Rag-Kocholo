The Hungarian Forint, represented by the currency code HUF, is the official currency of Hungary. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB), also known as the Central Bank of Hungary, issues and manages the Hungarian Forint.

The Forint was introduced on 1 August 1946, after the end of the Second World War, replacing the Peng≈ë, which had faced hyperinflation. The currency's name, 'Forint', comes from the city of Florence, where golden coins called fiorino d'oro were minted starting in 1252.
