        "text": "Bisected by the Danube River, the Hungarian capital is one of Europe’s must-visit destinations. Its storied past is captured through engaging museums and architectural wonders, with much of the city designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Visiting Budapest is not just about taking a fascinating step back into the past but discovering the vibrant festivals and events that take place throughout the year.\n\nIn this article, discover what you can expect during each of the seasons in Budapest to help figure out the best time to visit. While the official tourist season runs from May through to September, there are plenty of reasons to visit outside of this period, including Christmas festivities, musical celebrations and national holidays.\n\nOnce you’ve decided on dates, be sure to book your Budapest accommodation as early as possible. You’ll find a good range of choices online via a mobile-friendly holiday rental platform such as Rentola Budapest. It lists apartments and homes in all corners of the city, from the Castle District to the Jewish Quarter and Belvaros, so you don’t have to waste time searching multiple sites. With Budapest’s efficient network of buses, trams, boats, and trains, you’ll never be far from all the action.\n\nWinter in Budapest\n\nDecember is a wonderful time to visit Budapest when the city is beautifully illuminated with lights and Christmas markets bring a festive atmosphere to the streets. While exploring the city, you can stop for a warming mulled wine and pick up freshly roasted chestnuts or feast on the sweet local specialty, Kürtőskalács.\n\nAfter the New Year’s celebrations and gala concert at the Vigadó Concert Hall, things quieten down in January as Budapest’s festival season comes to a close. This is a great time to visit without the crowds and score cheap accommodation deals, although the weather may not be in your favor. Generally speaking, gray, cold, and wet conditions are the norm throughout January and February, with some museums and attractions reducing their hours.\n\nWinter temperatures in Budapest range from an average low in January of -3°C to a November high of 8°C.\n\nSpring in Budapest\n\nMarch marks the start of spring as Budapest’s almond trees begin to blossom, as well as heralding in the city’s concert and theater season. It’s a great time for art and culture enthusiasts to visit the city, particularly around Easter when religious festivities are in full swing.\n\nIn March/April, the Budapest Spring Festival takes place, with more than 200 events igniting all corners of the city. From jazz to world music and contemporary dance, there’s something for everyone. Jewish culture is celebrated across a two-week festival in May while local microbreweries are the focus of Budapest Beer Week.\n\nSpring temperatures in Budapest range from an average low in March of 2°C to an average May high of 22°C.\n\nSummer in Budapest\n\nDespite being the official start of summer, June can be a wet month in Budapest with predictable showers and storms. Many of the city’s museums open their doors throughout the night in honor of the summer solstice and it’s always fun to experience Budapest coming to life after dark. June also hosts the annual Danube Carnival, which features everything from Hungarian folk performances to contemporary dance.\n\nJuly is one of the busiest months in Budapest, with Hungarian schools breaking for the summer holidays and temperatures at their peak. While many residents head out of the city to relax on the shores of Lake Balaton, international visitors flock in to explore Budapest’s architectural landmarks and museums. The first weekend in July is a riot of color as the annual Pride Parade takes to the streets.\n\nIf you’re planning on visiting Budapest in August, it’s essential that you book your accommodation well in advance and be prepared for crowds at many of the city’s biggest attractions. Not only does the Hungarian Grand Prix take place during the month (sometimes it is in the end of July instead) but also one of Europe’s largest music festivals, Sziget. Fireworks illuminate the skies on August 20 to mark St Stephen’s Day.\n\nSummer temperatures in Budapest range from an average low in June of 14°C to an average July high of 27°C.\n\nAutumn in Budapest\n\nWith kids back at school, September is a quieter month in Budapest but the weather is still warm and pleasant for exploring the city. If you’re intowine tasting, coincide your visit with the Budapest Wine Festival, which takes place in the atmospheric Castle District.\n\nOctober provides a wonderful opportunity to see the changing colors and experience another gastronomic celebration, the Budapest Palinka and Sausage Festival. It’s also a great time for design and art enthusiasts, with cultural events held across the city as part of CAFe Budapest.\n\nNovember begins with All Saints Day when Hungarians visit their loved ones’ graves before a period of rest in preparation for the Christmas season.\n\nAutumn temperatures in Budapest range from an average low in November of around 1°C to an average September high of 22°C.\n\nThere is nothing like reading a good book. But sometimes carrying books around makes your bag heavy and can be inconvenient. A Kindle is small, but you can have hundreds of books available on your device at all times. It is no wonder why so many people love their Kindle readers. Would you like to buy a Kindle? How can you purchase a Kindle and have it delivered to Hungary?\n\nWhen you live in Hungary, it is obvious that the best solution is to order products from Amazon.de. Why is that? Since Germany is in the European Union, you do not pay any VAT on products ordered and delivered from Amazon Germany. It is also the closest store to Hungary, meaning that products in stock are normally delivered within less than a week. There are additional delivery fees as you order a product to Hungary, but it isn’t a lot more expensive than what you would pay to have a product delivered to your house from a Hungarian webshop.\n\nThis article, however, isn’t about ordering general products from Amazon.de, it is about order the popular Kindle e-Book reader. What is the problem? As you visit the Amazon website to order a Kindle, you will normally see a message like this.\n\nWhat can you do if the Kindle you want to buy is only available for delivery to Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, or Switzerland? Is there any good solution to the problem?\n\nHow to order a Kindle and other limited products and have them delivered to Hungary?\n\nThere are several other products besides the Kindle that Amazon doesn’t ship to Hungary. The same is true for Fire TV products, the Echo loudspeaker, and many other products. What can you do to solve the problem?\n\nSolution 1: Order a Kindle that Amazon delivers to Hungary.\n\nThe first solution, the easiest, is to find a Kindle that Amazon delivers to Hungary. There are a few versions of the popular e-Book reader that Amazon ships to Hungary. The cheapest versions are normally not on this list, but click the link below to see a list of all the Kindle versions available for shipping to Hungary.\n\nKindle readers available for shipping to Hungary.\n\nAbove, you can see which versions of the Kindle are available for shipping to Hungary at the time I am writing this article. You can also see the estimated delivery cost, which means you will pay about 125 euros for the cheapest Kindle with shipping included.\n\nYou can buy Kindle e-Book readers from a couple of webshops in Hungary. The cheapest variant of the same Kindle I found in a Hungarian webshop at the time of writing is 140 euros. In other words, ordering the product from Amazon.de is cheaper than buying it in a Hungarian webshop.\n\nSolution 2: Order it to an address in Germany and have the package forwarded to your address in Hungary.\n\nHave you found a Kindle on Amazon that cannot be delivered to Hungary, but you would like to buy it anyway? The easiest way to solve this is by using the service Mailboxde. We have used this many times, and it is very straightforward and easy to use.\n\nRegister a free account at Mailboxde.\n\nWrite down your postal address in Germany.\n\nUse the address the next time you order from Amazon.de.\n\nYou will receive an email immediately as your package arrives at the address in Germany.\n\nChoose a freight company that Mailboxde should use to forward the package to your address in Hungary. It is also possible to have Mailboxde create one package from several packages (thus making delivery cheaper), but this comes at an additional cost.\n\nWait a couple of days, and the package will be delivered to your home address in Hungary.\n\nIs it expensive to use Mailboxde? Our experience is that you will not pay much more than you would to have Amazon deliver the product to Hungary. Why is that? Since your address is in Germany, you pay less shipping costs in the first place. It is also worth noting that Amazon often increases the price of products in your shopping basket when they realize it is going abroad. Small packages delivered from Mailboxde to Hungary normally cost around 10-12 euros. All in all, you will not pay much more using this service compared to having the product delivered directly to Hungary.\n\nCan I purchase Hungarian books and read them on my Kindle?\n\nIf you want to read Hungarian books (in Hungarian) on your Kindle, you will not find such books on Amazon.de. Is it possible at all to add Hungarian books to your Kindle? The answer is yes.\n\nThere are several online shops where you can buy books and have them directly delivered to your Kindle, and you can also download books in the .epub format and send them to your Kindle on your own.\n\nAs you purchase a Kindle and register it to your Amazon account, you will find it on the Amazon website as you look at the page for your content and devices.\n\nHere you can see the email address of your Kindle. If you visit a store for digital books like dibook.hu, you can have them deliver the e-Books you order directly to this address. If you download books to your computer or phone, you can also send them to this email address to read them on your Kindle.\n\nA great place to find free books for Kindle in Hungary is the Hungarian Electronic Library. There you can find lots of free books, download them in the epub format, and later forward them to your Kindle.\n\nAbove, you can see that I have found a Sherlock Holmes collection that can be downloaded for free from the Hungarian Electronic Library in the .epub format, which is required for Kindle readers.\n\nDo not forget to register the email addresses allowed to send content to your Kindle.\n\nTo prevent spamming of your Kindle, you need to tell Amazon which email addresses are allowed to send files to your Kindle. Go to the Preferences section and scroll to the bottom until you find the “Approved Personal Document E-mail List.” You must add the email address allowed to send content to your Kindle. If you plan on ordering books from DiBook or other online stores, you need to add their email addresses for the books to be delivered to your Kindle. The other option is to download the books manually and then send them to the Kindle from your own email address.\n\nThat’s it. You are now ready to download content and send books to your Kindle, besides the books you buy directly from Amazon.de.\n\nYou can now order a Kindle and other products from Amazon.de to Hungary. If you have further comments or questions, use the comment field below.\n\nAre you a Budapest fan? If the answer is yes then you will love this Budapest video from 1973. It is a 30 minute film simply showing what Budapest was like, presented by the Hungarian singer Kati Kovacs.\n\nWe by coincidence bumped into this film in the library of the Norwegian TV channel NRK, so you can watch the film there if you want to.\n\nBudapest video from 1973\n\nPress the link above to visit the video on the NRK website and start watching the website. It is amazing to see the changes that has happened in the city since then. Just take a look at the following picture from the film which was made back then of what is today one of the nicest hotels in town, the Gresham Palace (Four Seasons).\n\nThere are lots of clips like the one above that is interesting, but you should be warned that the first 10 minutes are most interesting, because after that they start to sing a lot and you do not get to see as much of Budapest anymore.\n\nAnd one more thing… it is often just as interesting to notice what you can not see as what you can see. Lots of buildings present today can not be seen in the video, you can see cars driving on the area which is the Danube Promenade today, and so much more. Enjoy the film and watch it.\n\nIt is supposed to be available all across the world, but if you should have problems watching NRK from abroad, just press the link to get help.\n\nOne of the most important subjects a blog can write about is money; everyone is interested in the subject and everyone likes to have money, and most of us like it even more if they have a lot of it. Since Hungary is not the largest and most important country in the world, many people ask themselves questions such as where is Hungary, what is the capital of Hungary and of course, what is the currency of Hungary. In our blog we will from time to time simply answer such normal and typical questions, though not with short answers, but with thorough information helping our readers find exactly the information they want and need.\n\nSo, what is the currency of Hungary?\n\nThe name of the currency used in Hungary is Hungarian Forint, which has been used since 1946. Before that the currency of Hungary was Adópengő, and before that they used Forint (1867-1892), Korona (1892-1918), Pengő (1919-1926) and then Adópengő (1927-1946) before the Forint finally became the currency of Hungary again in 1946. Currently the Hungarians would like to get the Euro as their local currency, so the end of the HUF might be on the horizon, but they have not yet been allowed to get it due to poor economy. But, if the economy starts rising, the Euro might come to Hungary as well in the future, thus making and end to the epoch of the Hungarian Forint.\n\nThe Hungarian Forint is often named only HUF which is the abbreviation for the real name, just like the Great British Pound is often shortened down to GBP. Another sign for the Hungarian Forint is Ft, which you can often see on price tags in both stores and on the internet and elsewhere. Earlier the currency of Hungary had a smaller part named fillér, where one Forint was the same as 100 fillér. The last fillér was withdrawn from usage in 1999. After that the smallest coin was the 1 Forint coin (0,0036 Euro or 0,0045 USD). The 1 and 2 Forint coins remained in circulation until 1998, but since then the 5 Forint coin is the smallest still in circulation.\n\nSo if you come to Hungary know you can find 5, 10, 20, 100 and 200 Forint coins and 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000 and 20000 HUF bills. One piece of advice is if you jump on a taxi on the street or pay with larger bills in strange, hidden shops and at markets, is to make sure that you receive money back in Hungarian Forint. Some people we know have paid taxis with a Hungarian 20,000 bill and received back 10,000 Romanian Lei bill (which is worth nothing at all). This is not very common, but it happens, so it is worth watching out.\n\nUSD to HUF\n\nIf you would like to change your USD to HUF at the moment you can multiply the amount in USD with 225, and you will get almost the exact amount in HUF. This means that if you would like to change 200 USD to HUF then you will get somewhere around 45,000 HUF. It is not that easy with brain math, but if you remember the trick of multiplying with 225 and use the calculator at your mobile that should be of great help.\n\nEUR to HUF\n\nIf you come from a European country with EUR (Euro) as the local currency then 1 Euro is at moment around 280 HUF. That is in fact a quite big difference to some months ago, because then you could in the most drastic times of Hungarian economy get 320 HUF for 1 Euro. Beneath this text you can find a graph showing the movement and changes in the relationship between the Euro and the Hungarian Forint in the last two years.\n\nGBP to HUF\n\nBudapest is a very popular destination for people coming in from Great Britain and there are quite a lot of pubs packed with Englishmen drinking bear and having fun. But to buy the beer you need to have some of the Hungarian currency, and if you want to change GBP to HUF then you should calculate that 1 GBP gives you about 350 HUF. If you then change 200 GBP you should get about 70,000 HUF.\n\nBe aware!\n\nWhen reading about the conversion from USD to HUF, from EUR to HUF or from GBP to HUF we have the ideal and current exchange middle rates. If you go to an exchange office at the airport they will have terrible rates compared to this, and even though it is not normal with commission rates at the exchange offices, they still have horrible exchange rates making up for the „no commission” sign. The best way to grab hold of the currency of Hungary, the HUF, is to use an ATM either at the airport or in the city center, or maybe by finding good exchange offices where the difference between the buy and sale price is nothing more than 3-4 Forint. You can read more about it this at the Currency page at Budapest Guide where you can also find an online currency converter.\n\nA new star is rising in Budapest, and the name of it is MÁK Bistro. The restaurant has a rustic feeling to it, and it is almost hidden away in the very center of Budapest, only one minute away from the beautiful Chain Bridge on the Pest side of the city. MAk Bistro opened in 2010 and has since then received lots of great reviews, making it one of the most trendy restaurants in Budapest at the moment, but it does not feel to touristic, which is a bonus.\n\nIn the Dining Guide 2012 edition and in the Gault&Millau restaurant guide for 2012 MÁK Bistro was listed among the top five restaurants of Budapest. That is quite a job from such a young restaurant, and as I visited the restaurant earlier I was curious to get to know the place better.\n\nDuring lunch time the restaurant offers two or three course lunches. The price for a two course lunch is 2800 HUF and for three courses the price is 3500 HUF. No drinks are included, so you should add 500-1000 HUF to the bill, and then the service fee, which they automatically add to the bill as you get it. Therefore a lunch for one person here with three courses will normally end up somewhere between 4500-5000 HUF (of course depending on how much you drink).\n\nI (Budablogger) am not so much of a gourmet, so therefore I was curious to see how I would like the food in the restaurant. If it gets to advanced and with to many strange spices and ingredients, I often miss the traditional Hungarian courses. But, today something happened, as I enjoyed all the three courses, and also the „free” courses given along the way. The first course was a soup (Parsnip velouté) which was tasting completely different from most soups I have ever tasted in Hungary, but it was interesting and delicious. The main course (Pink perch with buckwheat pasta) was made from fish with buckwheat pasta, and even though it felt strange at the start, I enjoyed it so much that as all the fish was gone, I took what was left of bread from the table and started to put it into the sauce left from the main course to enjoy them together.\n\nThe dessert (Cottage cheese-pomegranate dessert) was extremely fresh and the combination of fruit, cottage cheese and something similar to crunched biscuits made it a perfect end to the lunch menu.\n\nThe menu at MÁK Bistro changes continuously, making it an interesting place to visit over and over again, and the prices are not at all scary. Main courses if you come during dinner time cost somewhere between 2500-5000 HUF normally, and they use lots of traditional Hungarian ingredients, though with lots of turns and twists to it. This makes MÁK Bistro a super place to visit if you want to eat upper class food in Budapest with nice prices, great service, a central location and with high quality. Be surprised and enjoy your meal as you visit MÁK Bistro.\n\nMAK Bistro Budapest\n\nVigyázó Ferenc utca 4, 1051 Budapest\n\nTuesday – Saturday from 12.00-15.00 and 18.00-24.00\n\nTelephone: +36307239383\n\nWhat others have written about MÁK Bistro.\n\nTheir distinguishing trait is the consisting use of excellet raw material, prepared with the care it deserves… outstanding desserts bring an upbeat ending to your meal.
