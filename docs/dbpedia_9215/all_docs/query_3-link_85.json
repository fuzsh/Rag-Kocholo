        "text": "Timing is key if you want to maximise your Hungarian forints, but the best time to buy will depend on the current market conditions and your personal travel plans.\n\nIf you have a fixed travel date, you should start to monitor the Hungarian forint rates as soon as possible in the period leading up to your departure so that you've got time to buy when the rate is looking favourable. For example, if the Hungarian forint rate has been steadily increasing over several weeks or months, it could be a good time to buy while the rate is high.\n\nSome people prefer to buy half of their Hungarian forints as soon as they've booked their holiday, and the remaining half just before they depart. This can be a good way of maximising your holiday money if the exchange rate continues to rise after you've bought, but will also help to minimise your losses if the rate drops.\n\nYou could also consider signing up to our newsletter and we'll email the latest rates to you each month.\n\nIf you need your Hungarian forints sooner and don't have time to wait for the rates to improve, you can still save money by comparing rates from a range of different providers before you buy. Online travel money suppliers usually have better Hungarian forint rates than high street exchanges, but supermarkets are a good compromise if you want to collect your currency in person and still get a decent rate. Just remember to buy or reserve your Hungarian forints first before you collect them from the store so you benefit from the supplier's better online rate.\n\nOur product comparisons are completely unbiased and we never allow companies to pay to be at the top of any results. Instead, some companies pay us a small commission for referring customers to them which helps to fund our costs and keeps our service free to you. This does not affect the quotes you receive or the price you pay.\n\nWe carry out stringent and regular checks on the companies that feature on our website, but even so we cannot guarantee their solvency. Please conduct your own due diligence before transacting with a company, and pay by card wherever possible as cards offer more financial protection than paying by bank transfer."
