        "text": "Preview text\n\nName: Pham Minh Khanh\n\nClass: BA\n\nLecturer: Phan Dinh Tram Anh\n\nStudent code: CS\n\nIdividual Assignment\n\nIA 1 : Use 2 real examples to prove principle # 4 is true. Principle #4: People\n\nrespond to incentives (chapter 1).\n\nIA 2 : Use 2 real examples to prove principle #9 is true. Principle #9: Prices rise\n\nwhen the government prints too much money (chapter 1).\n\nExample 1 : Hungary.\n\nOn November 12, 1918, after separating from the Austro-Hungarian Empire,\n\nHungary for the first time had its own currency, the kronen. In 1921, the Hungarian\n\nparliament passed the Hegedüs reform, which imposed a 20% tax on bank\n\ndeposits. Ultimately, the Hungarian government had to print money\n\nuncontrollably, leading to inflation reaching 98% each month. To end the inflation\n\nsituation, the government decided to eliminate the kronen and issue the pengő in\n\n1927. When World War II broke out, Hungary&#039;s economy was very weak,\n\nagriculture and infrastructure were damaged. severe destruction. To meet budget\n\nneeds, the government printed money uncontrollably, and the value of the pengő\n\nalso fell to the bottom and could not recover, even after the war ended. In 1944, the\n\nhighest denomination in the country This is 1,000 pengő. By the end of 1945, that\n\nnumber had reached 10 million pengő. Prices began to increase rapidly, according\n\nto Business Insider: &quot;In Budapest, an item that cost 379 pengos in September 1945\n\nwould have to be bought for 72,330 pengos in January 1946; 453,886 pengő in\n\nFebruary; 1,872,910 pengő in March; 35,790,276 pengő in April; 11,267 million\n\npengő on May 31; 862 billion pengő on June 15; 954 billion pengő on June 30; 3\n\nbillion pengő on July 7; 11 trillion pengő on July 15; and 1 trillion trillion pengő\n\non July 22.” This causes the Hungarian government to use currency units that are\n\nconstantly increasing. Pengő was replaced by special new currency units: mpengő\n\n(1 mpengő = 1 million pengő), bpengő (1 bpengő = 1 billion pengő) and adópengő\n\nwere issued for paying taxes and postage 1945 , Hungary issued notes worth\n\n25 billion pengő. By January 1946, this figure increased to 1,646 trillion pengő, in\n\nMay it was 65 trillion pengő and in July it was 47 trillion pengő until the\n\ngovernment ran out of paper to print money. The banknote with the highest\n\ndenomination of 100 billion pengő was printed around mid-1946. In August 1946,\n\nHungary decided to abolish the pengő and special currency units based on it to\n\nstart over from scratch. dilapidated. A new currency, the forint, was issued at an\n\nexchange rate of 1 to 400,000 quadrillion pengő (after 4 there are 29 zeros).\n\nFortunately, Hungary&#039;s economic situation has gradually become stable. Currently,\n\nthe forint has officially been banned. replaced by the Euro from 2020 according to\n\ncommitments in the roadmap to join the European Union (EU).\n\nExample 2 : Germany.\n\nIn 1914, when World War I broke out, 1 USD could now be exchanged for 4.\n\nmarks, because paying for war and weapons was beyond the government&#039;s\n\ncalculations. In November 1922, the value of gold coins in circulation in Germany\n\nfell from 300 million pounds (before World War I) to 20 million pounds. The\n\nReichbank came up with a solution: uncontrolled printing of the Mark currency,\n\nthereby accelerating the devaluation of the Mark. By December 1922, 1 USD\n\ncould still be exchanged for 2,000 marks, but by April 1923 That number increased\n\nto 20,000 marks for 1 USD and by August it was over 1 million marks. In 1923,\n\nthe inflation rate increased by 3 × 106% per month (prices doubled every 2\n\ndays). Germany fell into its worst situation in October 1923, when the inflation rate\n\nreached 29%. And by November 1923, this figure had increased to 238 million\n\nmarks. At its peak in December 1923, 1 USD was equivalent to 4,200 billion\n\nmarks, an estimated inflation rate of 750 billion%. From November 20, 1923, the\n\nMark was replaced by the Rentenmark (RM) at the rate of 1 thousand. billion\n\nMarks to 1 RM. The new exchange rate would be 4 RM to 1 USD, the same as\n\nthe exchange rate of the Mark in 1914. Finally, on August 30, 1924, the\n\nrentenmark became the official currency and the currency began to have value\n\nagain."
