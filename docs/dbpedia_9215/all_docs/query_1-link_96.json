        "text": "Hungary is a party to the Schengen Agreement, which allows for free movement between certain European countries. U.S. citizens may enter Hungary for up to 90 days for tourist or business purposes without a visa. If you plan to stay longer, please visit the Embassy of Hungary for the most current visa information.\n\nTraveling Through Europe: If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement. Please review our U.S. Travelers in Europe page.\n\nYour passport should be valid for at least three months beyond the period of stay.\n\nYou will need sufficient proof of funds and a return plane ticket.\n\nFor additional information about visas for the Schengen area, see the Schengen Visa page.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Hungary.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nTerrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\n\nHigh-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)\n\nHotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists\n\nPlaces of worship\n\nSchools\n\nParks\n\nShopping malls and markets\n\nPublic transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)\n\nTerrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad, including in Europe. For more information, see our Terrorism page.\n\nCrime: Although Hungary is generally a safe place to visit, you should use caution and stay alert. Be especially careful in crowded tourist areas, train stations, buses, trams, and metros.\n\nPassports, cash, and credit cards are favorite targets of thieves. The Embassy regularly receives reports of pickpocketing on the trains between Budapest and Vienna, so please be especially mindful of your belongings when traveling this route. There have been some instances in Budapest where U.S. citizens were overcharged exorbitant prices for food, beverages, or taxi services. Always verify the cost before making a purchase.\n\nThere have been incidents, although rare, where U.S. citizens were unknowingly drugged. Do not accept food or drink from anyone but a server. Additionally, the Embassy has received reports of racially motivated assaults. Please report all crimes to the local police. In an emergency dial 112 for help and contact the U.S. Embassy for follow-up assistance.\n\nGeneral tips to avoid becoming a victim of crime:\n\nBe aware of your surroundings.\n\nDo not walk alone at night.\n\nBe vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.\n\nStay alert in crowded locations frequented by tourists.\n\nAlways keep your belongings secure.\n\nDo not accept food or drink from anyone but a server.\n\nVictims of Crime: Hungarian authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes committed in Hungary. Report crimes to the local police by calling 112.\n\nU.S. citizen victims of violent crime and sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. See our webpage about help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nHelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nAssist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\nContact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nProvide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion\n\nProvide a list of local attorneys\n\nProvide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.\n\nProvide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nHelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nReplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDemonstrations: Political gatherings and protests occur frequently in Hungary, mostly in Budapest. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Ethnic nationalist groups have gained popularity in Hungary in the past years, in some cases advocating intolerance towards migrants and minorities, including Jews, Roma, and LGBTI+ individuals. Although these far-right groups do not engage in violence and are not explicitly anti-United States, you should avoid public demonstrations and confrontations with their members.\n\nDemonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and political rallies.\n\nCheck local media for updates and traffic advisories.\n\nIn a few instances where demonstrations have turned violent, authorities have used riot police to control crowds.\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and FBI webpages for information.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is generally well-regulated and rules enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is generally available throughout the country. Outside of major metropolitan centers, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\n\nAlways carry your passport with you in Hungary. Local police may require you to show documentation to establish your identity upon request. Hungarian police may take you into custody if you attempt to prove your identity with documents other than a passport.\n\nHungary has a zero-tolerance policy for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Penalties are severe, including significant jail time.\n\nSome laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nSpecial Circumstances regarding Banking and Customs:\n\nTravelers’ checks are not universally accepted in Hungary. ATMs are readily available.\n\nIt is not possible to cash personal checks in Hungary without a local bank account, which requires residency.\n\nWestern Union is the most prevalent international money transfer company and has many locations throughout Hungary. You must have photo identification to receive a wire transfer.\n\nVisit the National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary for information about import and export of potentially restricted items.\n\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country report\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTQI+ events in Hungary. However, organizers may encounter disruptive behavior by far-right wing extremists at events supporting the LGBTQI+ community.\n\nSee our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details.\n\nTravelers with Disabilities: The law in Hungary prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility issues may include accessible facilities and ease of movement. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure. There can be a significant difference in accessibility between Budapest and the rest of the country.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad webpage and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also provides Traveler Health Information for Hungary.\n\nFor emergency services in Hungary dial:\n\n104 for Ambulance Services\n\n107 for the Police\n\n105 for the Fire Department\n\n112 for English-Speaking Emergency Responders (All Types of Emergencies)\n\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\n\nAmbulance services are widely available in Hungary, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. All ambulances may not be equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.\n\nAdequate health facilities are available in the capital and other major cities, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Medical staff may speak little or no English. Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.\n\nSome hospitals and doctors require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Some private clinics and hospitals may require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.\n\nWe do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\n\nMedical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\n\nPrescription Medication: Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the government of Hungary to ensure the medication is legal in Hungary. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Prescription and over-the-counter medicines are widely available at pharmacies.\n\nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFurther health information:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy: If you are considering traveling to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page. Hungarian law forbids surrogacy arrangements."
