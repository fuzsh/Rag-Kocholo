Fruitful conversations forgotten, ongoing conversations taken for granted. Many, many people have patiently listened to me try to explain this project, and each time I learned how better to articulate my ideas. Thank you to all.\n\nArchivists and librarians carried me throughout this project: vetting my numerous requests, hauling box after box to the reading room, dusting off files, and photocopying thousands of documents. I owe a special debt of gratitude to the hardworking staff of three national institutions in particular, where I spent countless hours immersed in bits of the past: the contemporary (post-1945) collection of the Hungarian National Archive, the Institute of Political History, and the National Széchényi Library. In addition, three county archives graciously hosted and helped me: Győr-Moson-Sopron County, Hajdú-Bihar, and Zala. The men, and one woman, I interviewed for this project were gracious with their time and their memories. Although they were often puzzled by my research project, they nonetheless humored me by spending hours answering questions and sharing their reflections of the world they once inhabited: Kálmán Eck, László Enese (formerly Steinzinger), András Hegedüs, Pál Izinger, Mihály Kalocsay, József Kecskés, Csaba Kovács, Miklós Kuzmiak, György Latkovics, Mrs. György Lonti, Pál Romány, István Szabó, Sándor Szakács, József Takács, and Zoltán Tószegi. During the first phase of research, three enterprising research assistants helped me to survey collections, run down sources, and plow through reams of documents: Zoltán Bellák, Edit Cserna, and Enikő Karácsony. At my request, Anna Hamar and Tibor Valuch wrote case studies to guide my investigation. Tibor provided me an invaluable overview of the structure of the Stalinist party/state; Anna compiled a comprehensive study of the Ministry of Agriculture trial in 1948. Drawing on his mammoth collection of biographical materials, Árpád Takács generously provided me detailed information on the backgrounds and training of crucial figures in interwar work science and agricultural economics.\n\nMy research would not have been possible if not for the generous support I have received from the American Council of Learned Societies, the German Marshall Fund Research Grant, the International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX), and the National Council for Eurasian and East European Research. These agencies are not responsible for the content or findings of my research. I would also like to thank Vera and Ferenc Falus for being such good neighbors and generous friends.\n\nThree influential mentors, Ferenc Szarka, Pál Juhász, and Barney Cohn, encouraged my curiosity about work units early on. Feri bácsi patiently answered all my questions about work units and prewar labor contracts when I first visited his home in Sárosd in 1982. I couldn’t keep up with the complex calculations he performed to explain the major consequences of apparently minor changes in the proportion of the harvest paid to migrant workers, but I did learn that paying attention to details like this was important. When I happened upon the Journal of Agricultural Work Science in the Parliamentary Library in fall of 1983, Pali confirmed my suspicions that socialist wages and interwar work science might be related. After returning from field work in 1984, I happened to mention work units to Barney in a casual conversation. He was immediately intrigued, reassuring me that I was not alone in finding these artifacts interesting, although many would attempt to persuade me otherwise for years afterward.\n\nGail Kligman and Katherine Verdery have been role models and mentors since I started graduate school. They have nurtured my interest in Eastern European society and culture and shared my commitment to including the less visible but equally significant protagonists of socialist history in their work. The research project they organized about collectivization in Romania, and the beautifully rich scholarship that has issued from it, has been an invaluable resource.\n\nElizabeth Dunn is a dear friend and invaluable colleague. Her brutal honesty and generosity of spirit rescued this project more than once. I will never be able to repay her for the excellent scholarly advice and emotional support she has given me.\n\nMark Pittaway, who passed away in 2010 at the tragically early age of 39, was my constant companion when I was doing the first round of archival work for this project in 1996–97. He was working on his dissertation, a marvelous social history of industrial working class conditions in Hungary in the 1950s that was published posthumously in 2012 (The Workers’ State: Industrial Labor and the Making of Socialist Hungary, 1944–1958, University of Pittsburgh Press). Extremely generous with his time and advice, Mark was the ideal interlocutor to quiz and probe as I waded through the archives. He was not sparing in his criticism of my work. What about the people? I assured him that economists and bureaucrats were people too. Following his advice to get closer to the working class, I visited county archives to learn more about village-level politics. I hope I have redeemed myself.\n\nZsuzsanna Varga’s acute appreciation for village life and the trials and tribulations of collectivization have inspired me. Her historical scholarship has enriched our understanding of these events immensely. Agreeing with Mark, Zsuzsa’s insistence that I work in county archives to flesh out the picture at the national level has made all the difference to my study, transforming it from a primarily intellectual history to a fully social one.\n\nMy dear friend Ákos Róna-Tas has suffered my fascination with work units for years. Time and again when I asked him to help me translate a difficult phrase, he would tell me, Nobody else in the whole wide world has read this stuff except you. I was quick to reassure him that the authors surely read the text, if no one else had. And then, of course, he did too. For this and much, much more, I thank him.\n\nAs a standing member of the Society of People Who Study Boring Things, I realize it is a lot to ask of colleagues to puzzle through the arcane details I sought to understand. For their patience and generosity, I thank Dave Altshuler, Elena Aronova, Michael Burawoy, Éva Darvas, Kriszti Fehérváry, Deborah Fitzgerald, Sheila Fitzpatrick, Michael Geyer, Zsuzsa Gille, Andreas Glaeser, Maya Haber, Paul Hanebrink, Matt Hull, Paul Kenéz, Kati Kovács, György Köver, Ruth Mandel, Diana Mincyte, Maya Nadkarni, Juan Pablo Pardo-Guerra, Patrick Patterson, György Péteri, Alex Stern, László Váradi, Helen Verran, and Lynne Viola. Several colleagues generously read drafts of this book at various stages of development, and patiently explained—in the midst of my tantrums—how to improve the manuscript: Rick Biernacki, Elizabeth Dunn, Jeff Haydu, and Isaac Martin. The research group Leigh Star and I organized in 2001—Geof Bowker, Steve Epstein, Rogers Hall, Jean Lave, Martin Lengwiler, Janice Neri, Ted Porter, L. K. (Mimi) Saunders, and Judith Treas—explained to me what I was looking to find. The Humanities Research Institute at the University of California, Irvine, was our gracious host.\n\nI have had the good fortune of participating in the Science Studies Program at UC San Diego, first as a guest and then as a core faculty member, for more than twenty years. The interdisciplinary community Science Studies fosters has nourished my intellectual appetites and surrounded me with marvelous colleagues. Attending the great talks held every week in the colloquium series fed my curiosity about science studies as a discipline and taught me how to ask questions differently.\n\nTeaching, as we know, is a two-way street, but I have often felt that graduate students, especially those in the Science Studies Program, have been leading the way. Thank you. For assistance directly related to this manuscript I would like to thank Natalie Forssman, Christine Payne, and Kara Wentworth, who read an early draft and provided feedback. Thanks are also due to Joan Donovan, Shannon McMullen, and Jonathan Walton, who shared their precious skills with me.\n\nAnd then there are my friends and family. Here I really falter. For want of words, let me simply say thank you to Judit Hersko, Adam Hersko-Rona-Tas, Lorna Reading, Sally Rumbaugh, and my sisters Sarah Lampland and Susan L. Woodward. For all the rest of you who remain unnamed know that I am grateful every day for your support and love.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHow does one quantify the value of an event or put a price on a possibility? Solving novel pricing questions, like figuring out the value of ad space on the web or calculating monetary incentives to mitigate deforestation, requires complex calculations that commensurate the once incommensurate. Reckoning the value of labor also entailed similar procedures: How does one reward skill, what is the cost of productivity, and when is time worthwhile? While markets may be the final arbiter of value, these are problems markets cannot solve. A myriad of factors enter into these calculations, demanding time and expertise to work out, all of this preliminary to releasing products on the market or hiring workers in a firm. How is this done and by whom? In the following account, I analyze how, at a specific moment in Hungarian history, a small coterie of work scientists and government bureaucrats allied under the banner of modernist rationalization to assess and determine the value of agricultural labor scientifically.\n\nIn the first volume of Capital, Marx walks readers through his argument about value and the fetishism of commodities using simple examples of commensuration by describing goods being exchanged in the town square, an analogy he soon dismantles as he proposes an alternative theory based on labor value.¹ Although 150 years have passed since Marx wrote Capital, common sense still assumes that to commodify goods or labor, they must be bought and sold on the marketplace. This may be a useful way of defining commodification in general terms, but it does little to help us understand the process of commodifying labor, that is, the means whereby a wide variety of tasks conducted by disparate groups in many places are rendered commensurate for the purposes of hiring employees and paying them for their services. As a consequence of these complex processes, people come to understand their time as having a monetary value and their efforts to be defined by skill, difficulty, and temporal duration. In other words, labor is conceived of as a unit: of money, time, and activity. We take these procedures for granted, yet they are clearly subject to historical and cultural variation. I will argue that markets are not the only means by which this transformation occurs. The purpose of my intervention is to draw attention to the substantial infrastructure that makes markets possible, usually overlooked by focusing primarily on the reach or efficiency of markets. Modern labor markets rely upon a wide range of capacities and institutions that make markets work, so much so that their combined influence alone is sufficient to commodify labor. The fact that in many instances markets dominate the process of determining the value of labor does not preclude the possibility that other means of achieving the same end are possible. The question then becomes one of discerning how and where crucial moments in the commodification of labor occur and whether they precede, accompany, or exclude marketization.\n\nWhat does a scientifically calibrated wage system look like? Let me illustrate by citing a few examples from the evaluative matrix designed in Hungary in the 1950s to reward labor contributions at cooperative farms. Each task in cooperative farming was assigned a daily value, the so-called work unit. Harvesting wheat was worth 1 work unit. That is, cutting 1,200 square fathoms² of standing wheat with a scythe over the course of 10 hours was worth 1 work unit. In fact, in 1949 cutting 1,200 square fathoms of standing wheat with a scythe over the course of 10 hours at a cooperative farm in Hungary was worth 1 work unit, whereas by 1952 it was worth 2 work units. In 1949 two men each earned one work unit for spreading manure, calibrated according to the following qualifications: the distance travelled, the amount distributed, and whether the team pulling the cart was made up of horses or oxen. By 1952, only horses were listed as draught animals, and artificial fertilizers dominated the manure section. Now only distance and manner of dispersal (mechanized or by hand) were relevant to the classification. For those working with livestock, different variables were taken into consideration. Tending to 15 cattle daily in 1949 was worth 0.4 work units, whereas 2.4 work units were earned for every 100 kilograms of weight increase. In 1952, the number of cattle tended daily had risen to 20, which earned 12 work units on the last day of every month. For every 100 kilogram weight gain, 3 work units were recorded. Furthermore, for every fattened cow delivered to the slaughterhouse in good shape 4 work units were assigned (Földmívelésügyi Minisztérium Termelőszövetkezeti Főosztálya 1949; Földművelésügyi Minisztérium 1952). Designing this matrix was a monumental effort. Every single activity—from hoeing tomatoes to planting tobacco to artificially inseminating livestock—carried a specific numerical value, the daily level of effort calibrated to accommodate skill and difficulty, as well as local conditions such as the density of the soil or the steepness of the grade. Precision was paramount.\n\nI first encountered the work unit system while conducting field work at a cooperative farm in Hungary during the early 1980s. The least productive member at the farm, the village party secretary’s dissolute younger brother, gave me a copy of the two-inch-thick handbook. No longer in use, work units were remembered fondly. Having heard numerous complaints about the poor working habits of farm members, I finally asked a brigade leader why he thought morale was so poor. He replied without hesitation: the work ethic deteriorated when work units were replaced by money. I was intrigued by his response. Why would paying people in money for their time degrade the quality of work performed? What was the difference between working to accumulate work units and working for an hourly wage or piece rate? Most perplexing of all was the question of who designed the work unit system in the first place, and why.\n\nIn the book that chronicled my field work, The Object of Labor (1995), I essayed the notion that labor could be commodified in the absence of a labor market. Curious about what had been the social and economic consequences of collectivization in Hungary, I worked alongside villagers at the cooperative farm and in their homes to learn what it meant to work and what sorts of work were worthwhile. I was surprised to see that the attitudes and behaviors of younger villagers I observed were far more reminiscent of capitalism than Soviet collectivism: heightened individualism, rampant utilitarianism, economic determinism. The older generation did not share these views, but neither did they embrace socialist ethics or mouth Communist slogans. When I cited the proverb Group work is better work, people laughed, quickly countering with the proverb warning that property shared is property mishandled. Private enterprise was respected, although more as a zone of individual achievement than as an opportunity to acquire profit by taking risks. Differing attitudes within the community about work and its value were most evident when comparing the views of older and younger generations. Younger folk talked about their labor time in terms of its monetary value, while their elders considered work to be ennobling, valuable for its own sake. Young people talked about keeping a cow as a means to buying a bedroom set while older villagers kept cows for milk. The contrast between an instrumentalist logic and a code of self-sufficiency was glaring. At the time, I attributed these changes to the substantial reorganization and modernization of the economy during the socialist period. Substantial changes had taken place in how and where people worked: factory and farm regimens introduced new managerial hierarchies and shopfloor regulations, bureaucrats designed new wage scales and incentive packages, and schools educated the youth for new skills and trades. Day in and day out radio waves were flooded with the Communist Party’s latest economic figures, newspapers spilled ink praising reform packages, and tv commentators boasted about fulfilling the plan. Quantified indicators replaced prices as the coin of the realm. Department stores opened, although shoppers were still forced to scour the shelves for new goods. By the 1970s and 1980s, regulations preventing workers from moving between jobs had been relaxed, making it possible for a labor market to develop. Meanwhile, a thriving second economy subsidized collective farming, expanded the services sector, and raised incomes. All of these had become well-entrenched practices by late socialism, but they were clearly insufficient as explanations for the more comprehensive transformation under way.\n\nI had assumed throughout my previous project that commodification was an inadvertent consequence of socialist policies. The regime was clearly not capitalist, or even state capitalist, since in the Hungarian economy profit was always secondary to politics. A long-standing debate over what in fact distinguishes Marxist-Leninist economies from capitalist ones—such as Trotsky’s trenchant critiques and the later convergence debates in the 1970s—suggested strong similarities in form, but beyond broad studies of industrial development, they were quiet on the means by which these similarities were produced (Trotsky 1937; Corrigan, Ramsay, and Sayer 1978; Dimock 1960; Horowitz 1964; Sorokin 1960; Tipps 1973; Weinberg 1969). Furthermore, commodification may have been achieved under socialism, but its genesis and development had surely begun in the capitalist period. More fine-grained studies of economic processes, and in particular historically nuanced analyses, were needed to resolve the question. In the absence of sufficient documentation, however, such projects were impossible. All that changed in 1989. With access to previously secret government documents, I would now be able to trace the connections between policies and techniques devised to commodify labor in agriculture by capitalist economists to those implemented in early socialism.\n\nI undertook the initial archival work and interviews for this project in the mid-1990s, when debates over the character of postsocialist transitions were raging.³ What had begun as a study of agrarian work science in mid-century Hungary expanded to consider the dynamics of political and economic transition, though in this case from capitalism to socialism. Studying the transition to Stalinism⁴ proved to be an excellent comparative lens on the post-1989 era, sharing as it did so many of the same features: radical economic and political restructuring, reshuffling of politicians and bureaucrats, the significant influence of foreign advisors, a ready-to-hand economic model, and the social upheaval all this entailed. More to the point, optimistic views of the ease of the transition to capitalism in the 1990s relied either explicitly or implicitly on a common view that the Stalinist transition had been swift and comprehensive (e.g., Berend 1996, 39; Kovrig 1979, 236; Swain 1992, 38). The dominant notion was that in 1947 Soviet officials arrived with a model for an economic and political overhaul in their back pocket, which they gladly shared with their new comrades in arms. Dictated is the better term, as the Soviets and their Hungarian cronies were willing and able to use extensive brute force to achieve their goals. So, too, Western advisors swept into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in the 1990s, offering a neat package of institutional reforms that would pave the way to capitalism. While the political and economic strains of transition lent urgency to their admonishments, this paled in comparison to Stalinist methods of persuasion and terror. Had the transition to Stalinism been as swift and effective as we had been taught? If not, then why not? What were the social constraints faced by the Communist party/state at its inception, and did they bear any resemblance to the fits and starts of the postsocialist era?\n\nA question about means—how commodification took place—led me to explore agrarian work science from the interwar period, while an interest in the character of change motivated the focus on the transition to Stalinism. Tying these two issues together is a third element in the study, that is, a curiosity about how scientific ideas and formalizing practices move from place to place. In recent years, science studies scholarship has consistently demonstrated that scientific practices take place in particular, circumscribed places (e.g., Henke 2000; Livingstone 2003; Powell 2007; Smith and Agar 1998); claims to general knowledge are fashioned post hoc and constitute additional practices required to secure their warrant (Canguilhem 1991; Casper and Clarke 1998; Fleck 1979; Foucault 1971; Kuhn 2012; Latour 1988). Broad policy innovations travel the world easily in coat pockets and brief cases and festoon the pages of trade publications and academic journals. Actually implementing policies, on the other hand, is a whole different matter, a commonplace in the vast literature on knowledge transfer and institutional change (Braun and Kropp 2010; Breslau 1998; Collins and Evans 2009; DiMaggio and Powell 1991; Drori, Meyer, Ramirez, and Schofer 2003; Glaser 1973; Jasanoff 2004; Maasen and Weingart 2006; Szulanski 2000; Tihanyi and Roath 2002). If doing science and making policy are contingent processes, does this hold true for technical procedures as well? Or, posed a little differently, does it matter if mathematical formulae are understood to be universal signs or contingent projects? Might approaching formalizing practices this way give us greater purchase on understanding the social in social science? Is it possible to disentangle the scientific and the technical from the social, or, to be more precise, ascertain in what ways social sciences and sociocultural, historical practices intertwine, and with what consequences?\n\nThe Technicalities of Commodification\n\nThe following questions drive my inquiry: Does theorizing and formal modeling in the social sciences have real world effects, and if so, how and why does that occur? Is it possible to trace the role of new fields like agricultural economics and work science in developing specific techniques for commodifying labor? Might one discover empirical evidence to demonstrate how economists and policy makers self-consciously design formal procedures for assessing the value of labor? What sorts of demands—in time, training, and data collection—would realizing such a system make on business and government agencies? And how would it work?\n\nIn the introduction to the collection The Laws of the Markets, Michel Callon called for histories drawing together the work of economists and their role in crafting policy:\n\nIn order fully to assess the contribution of economics to the constitution of the economy we would need to write a history which has yet to be invented. . . . it would be fascinating to construct a social history of economics which would show how abstract notions such as that of supply and demand, or those of interconnected markets . . . imperfect competition or incentives, have been formulated in constant relation to the practical questions which, in turn, they help reformulate. (Callon 1998, 2)\n\nSince Callon’s call for a new history, several path-breaking book-length studies of economists and policy in this vein have been written (Babb 2001; Çaliş kan 2010; Fourcade 2009; Mirowski 2002; Mitchell 2002; Roitman 2005).\n\nTheorizing and empirically verifying the notion that the discipline of economics influences economic processes has come to be known as the performativity question. Prompted by Callon’s insistence that economics, in the broad sense of the term, performs, shapes, and formats the economy, rather than observing how it functions (1998, 2), analysts have proceeded to investigate whether this claim is a useful way of studying the political consequences of economics in relation to specific sectors or economic practices. Economic experiments and public auctions have been a common site for analysis, since the parameters and participants of the economic phenomena under investigation are easily delineated, though markets of all sorts are of interest.⁵ In a useful review, Santos and Rodrigues suggest distinguishing between two senses of performativity: weak and strong. They would characterize the following definition by Callon as performativity in the weak sense: Talking of the performativity of economics means assuming that agency is distributed and that concrete markets constitute collective calculative devices with variable, adjustable configurations (2005, 3). In contrast, the strong notion of performativity asserts that the engineering efforts of economists make economics true by construction (2009, 986).\n\nThe concept of performativity has been controversial from the start. As would be expected with any protracted debate, the clarity of Callon’s initial formulation has been muddied by a wide range of interpretations of the meaning of economics as performative and how this event is to be identified empirically. The crucial issues at the heart of the disputes are familiar and rehearse debates once played out in economic anthropology on formalism versus substantivism. What do markets do? Is Callon correct to argue that long-standing social relations of exchange are torn asunder by markets to be replaced by new forms of buying and selling, a process he describes as entanglement? Or is Daniel Miller’s concept of embeddedness apposite, that is, do predominant cultural and moral practices enfold and entwine social relations as they shift in market society (2002; 2005)? Is there any reason to adopt the notion of homo economicus from neoclassical economics? Is the calculative agent a necessary consequence of engaging in market practices or is homo economicus a useless ideological fantasy (ibid.)? Who decides the results of experiments? Were game theorists accurate when they claimed to have successfully engineered the Federal Communication Commission’s auction of spectrum licences in 1994 (Guala 2001; Muneisa and Callon 2007) or did computerization of the auction play a far more important, though unanticipated, role in the outcomes (Mirowski and Nik-Khah 2007)?\n\nA crucial feature of the argument about performativity concerns the means by which economists exercise influence on markets. As MacKenzie explains, One important aspect of Callon’s work is his insistence that economics itself is a part of the infrastructure of modern markets (2006, 15). An important element of the debate, this issue is often overlooked or misunderstood, except in work influenced by science studies:\n\nIf we agree that, in order to exist and function, concrete markets require a set of investments and operations to shape calculative agencies, to qualify and singularize goods, and to organize and stabilize the encounters between goods and agencies, the question that arises is: How can this collective work be described and analysed, and who are the actors involved? The notion of an institution (or of a social network), at least in its traditional sense, is too restricted to describe the socio-technical arrangements that markets are. Institutions, as defined by the neo-institutionalists who emphasize property rights and their enforcement . . . or more recently by the new economic sociology, leave little room (if any) to material devices, technologies, and more generally, action and distributed cognition. (Callon 2005, 8)\n\nIt is precisely this dimension that holds center stage in my analysis: training our attention on a discrete set of material devices fashioned by business economists and work scientists to measure the value of labor, practices that formalize a set of relationships eventually incorporated into wage schemes at work. In short, this is a history of building the infrastructure for labor markets, tarrying in the details of who built it, when, and how.\n\nThe attention MacKenzie has brought to material devices and technologies in the debate over performativity (see also Barry and Slater 2002a, 2002b) is also central to recent studies of commensuration and valuation. Puzzling about the ways goods and activities are commensurated—a question at the heart of Marx’s analysis of commodity fetishism—has gained renewed interest as problems of pricing intangibles loom in web marketing or among experts in the new field of contingent valuation, in which the existence value of nature is calculated (Bateman and Willis 1999; Champ, Boyle, and Brown 2003; Espeland 1998; Fourcade 2011a, 2011b; see also Espeland and Stevens 1998). Discussions deciding environmental policy by figuring out how to offset carbon emissions hinge on similar practices. Careful exegeses of pricing mechanisms are required to figure out the dynamics of more unusual markets, such as those for art works or singularities (Karpik 2010; Pardo-Guerra 2013; Velthuis 2005), but are just as useful for discerning mundane features of market formation. I am indebted to those who have engaged in lively debates over performativity and committed themselves to discerning the mysteries of commensuration and pricing, but my theoretical intervention lies elsewhere. I intend to demonstrate that excavating the manner in which formalizing practices themselves are produced and deployed brings us much closer to understanding the social and cultural practices at the heart of markets.\n\nDECIPHERING THE BOOKS\n\nAnother crucial intervention in the study of business economics, finance, and markets has been the enormously influential body of work on accounting as a social and cultural practice. A group of researchers clustered around the journal Accounting, Organizations, and Society, clearly influenced by Foucault, produced a flurry of work centered on accounting as a practice (Miller, Hopper, and Laughlin 1991). Peter Miller described the innovative approach as being characterized by three features: (1) insisting on treating accounting as a technology, (2) examining the meanings of numbers and charts, and (3) interrogating how knowing the economy through accounting and its calculative practices alters economic configurations (Miller 1994, 2–4; for a critique of claims to innovation, see Arnold and McCartney 2003). An entirely new world of numbers and charts was revealed. Classic Foucauldian topics of disciplining the subject and governmentality (Hoskin and Macve 1986; Miller and Rose 1990) appeared alongside articles on concerns current in science studies, such as transcription and ontology (Law 1996; Robson 1992). Fascinating historical work freed the study of accounting from its isolation in economic reductionism, proposing that hierarchies of accountability in religious orders—Jesuit pedagogy an accounting for sins—could not be explained simply in terms of resource management and capitalist business (Quattrone 2004). For my purposes, examining accounting as a rhetorical practice was particularly helpful (Carruthers and Espeland 1991; Davis, Menon, and Morgan 1982; Thompson 1991). This way of thinking prompted me to ask what a number actually means. Studies of historical crises—inflation and war—dealt with in accounting practice led me to wonder why a number means what it does, but also when (Gallhofer and Haslan 1991; Loft 1986; Thompson 1987). These questions spurred my interrogation into technologies of commodification.\n\nCONSTRUCTING THE INSTITUTIONAL SCAFFOLD\n\nThe term infrastructure usually brings to mind the classic forms of communications and transportation networks: interstate highways, transatlantic telegraph cables, train tracks, or telephone lines. In more recent years, more inaccessible components occupy our attention: satellites and the amorphous cloud. Recent work in infrastructure studies demonstrates, however, that a more capacious concept of infrastructure affords greater analytic purchase on the variety of platforms and networks we rely upon than would be the case if we limited ourselves to a specific sector of the economy or type of support service (Barry and Slater 2002a, 2002b; Çalişkan and Callon 2009; Larkin 2013; Star and Bowker 2006; Tassey 1991; Weill and Broadbent 1998). I am using the term infrastructure more expansively to refer to a variety of implements and practices, taking inspiration from Laurent Thévenot’s prescient article on investment in form (Thévenot 1984). In his analysis of Taylorism, Thévenot draws attention to the wide range of activities and technologies required to building a mechanism of scientific management, all of which require effort and time to create and sustain. Discussing the sorts of activities Taylor prescribed for building, Thevenot writes: Taylor’s handbook . . . contains a large repertoire of form-giving instruments . . . [among these] are to be found objects used in production on the shop floor, instruments, plans, conventions, scientific formulae, school precepts, ways of giving instructions which are close to military orders, methods of payment to be used in companies, principles, advice and examples to follow when deciding what action to take (ibid., 8–9). Only in concert do these instruments and activities constitute a working mechanism. One might ask, then, what form-giving instruments would be needed to assess the value of labor and facilitate a viable labor market.\n\nIn Hungary, field studies in agrarian work science (mezőgazdasági munkatan) required the use of slide rules, cameras, respirators, and a stop watch; manorial management (uradalmi számadás or számtartóság) relied upon new kinds of accounting procedures and managers trained to use these tools; agricultural economics (mezőgazdasági üzemtan) required a well-organized national statistical collection agency so that cross-firm comparisons (nationally and internationally) would permit accurate assessments of what farmers were actually doing and with what effects.⁶ The university needed a new department of economics to establish a field of agricultural economics, faculty qualified to teach the new field, and students willing to study what until then had been dismissed as irrelevant for running a good farm (not to mention the dismissal among the wealthy of anything that resembled business). Landowners had to be convinced that adopting cost accounting and hiring new staff would be worth the effort, and schools teaching cost accounting for agricultural firms had to be established. Building an infrastructure for labor value and creating the conditions for a market in labor were going to take time and enormous investments by private business and government. As Thévenot remarks, [that] the establishment of equivalent forms . . . [is] extremely costly is usually ignored in economic formalizations which, for the purposes of analysis, tend to assume that they have been established from the outset, rather like the currency (ibid., 3). Currency in fact can be made and unmade, as the history of inflationary spirals and banking problems in Hungary demonstrates all too well (see chapter 4). And once the new scientific wage system was established, cooperative farm members had to be convinced to actually use it and all the accompanying trappings like written records and cost accounting the new system brought with it.\n\nThere is a long and venerable history of the role of technology in business and an equally voluminous literature on scientific management and Taylorism (Beissinger 1988; Edwards 1979; Nelson 1980, 1992; Shenhav 1995, 1999; Slonim 1922). Unfortunately, these histories do not concern themselves with the more mundane technical problems that are of central importance here, that is, the techniques of commensuration required to monetize labor value and the formalizing practices underlying job standardization.⁷ It is not difficult to find manuals written by industrial economists and management theorists describing the procedures recommended to design wages scientifically. For example, Alford engages in a lengthy discussion of Merrill Lott’s weighted point system to establish wage rate equalization, identifying five factors to consider when rating jobs: mental effort, skill, physical effort, responsibility, and working conditions (Alford 1938, 587–93; see also Lytle 1942).⁸ Comparable factors would be used when the Hungarian work unit system was devised. To my knowledge, however, we have no documentation showing how Alford or Lott’s designs were actually used in practice by business managers, and with what results. Mathematical formulae for various wage schemes, accompanied by charts comparing ratios of costs saved or productivity achieved for each model, were published in journals and trade manuals, but how they were used to design a specific wage form is a mystery. I hope to rectify this problem by providing an empirical case study of how labor was valued and remunerated. A larger purpose also motivates my analysis, that of discerning how formalizing practices of valuing and commensurating labor were actually deployed by work scientists, agricultural economists, and government bureaucrats.\n\nFORMALIZING PRACTICES\n\nHow in fact are work habits dissected into little bits of activity and bursts of time that carry increments of value, facilitating their commensuration with other timed activities or even value-laden goods? The daily tasks of assessing labor value—the actual work of work science—were primarily"
