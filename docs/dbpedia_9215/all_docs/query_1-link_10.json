        "text": "Hungary, with its capital city, Budapest, is one of the top tourist destinations in Europe and is considered one of the most beautiful cities worldwide. Despite its small size, the country is home to many World Heritage Sites. Hungary's official and national currency is the Hungarian Forint (HUF). The name was first adopted between 1868 and 1892, but in 1946, modern forint was introduced. The forint is issued and maintained by the Hungarian National Bank. Coins are minted between 5 and 200 forints, while banknotes are issued in denominations between 500 to 10,000 forints. The forint is divided into 100 fillér, although these coins are no longer in circulation due to high inflation.\n\nThe Hungarian forint is Hungary's only official currency. Magyar Nemzeti Bank, the country's national bank, is responsible for issuing and maintaining the forint's value. The bank, established in 1924, also controls the circulation of the forint. Banknotes are issued in denominations of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 forints. Coins are issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 forints. The Hungarian Banknote Printing Company prints the bills while the coins are minted by the Hungarian Mint. In 1999, these coins were removed from circulation."
