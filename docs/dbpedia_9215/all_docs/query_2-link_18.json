        "text": "Inflation\n\nin·​fla·​tion | \\ in-ˈflā-shən \\\n\nA continuing rise in the general price level usually attributed to an increase in the volume of money and credit relative to available goods and services\n\nMerriam-Webster dictionary\n\nInflation, in many regards is an economic process that is expected in correlation with economic growth. It is expected for a countries to have inflation as their economies grow. A normal inflation target is 2 %, and it is usually ever country’s target to reach this number. If a country have more growth it can usually sustain more inflation but 2% is what usually experts agree upon to be a good inflation rate. The problem is when this inflation rate is not accompanied by growth equally as big. The price of every day stuff would increase and if growth is not present, the average people would simply not be able to afford things they used to be able to afford. This however is found rather more commonly than what are we going to talk about, hyperinflation.\n\nHyperinflation is a condition where inflation exceeds 50% a month. for example if a bottle of water cost $1 in January a condition of of hyperinflation would at least increase the price of that same bottle to $1.5 in February. This obviously is bad because money can essentially become worthless over night. Countries with recent hyperinflation cases or still ongoing hyperinflation cases are but not limited to Venezuela (2016), South Sudan (2016), Zimbabwe (2007), and more recently Lebanon (2020). The cases here are bad but somehow it is not the worse. the record for the highest hyperinflation in a month belongs to Post WWII Hungary with a peak monthly inflation rate of\n\n41,900,000,000,000,000 % ({4.19e+16} %)in July 1946\n\nPrices would double every 15.6 hours. Caused by an already existing hyperinflation before the war, the strain the war and post war occupation and reparation payments, the Hungarian government resorted to print money to cover these cost. At April 1945, $ 1 can be exchanged for 250 pengő nearing the end of the crisis, a 1 quadrillion pengő can only be exchanged for ¢ 2.5.\n\nThis hyperinflation is bad and Hungary acted fast and in under the year inflation in Hungary was back to normal. The inflation was controlled by introduction of 2 currencies, the first of this is the adópengő or tax pengő, originally used by banks and governments for budgetary purposes it was later introduced as a legal tender nearing the end of the crisis. It was meant as a temporary solution before a more permanent solution is made. The adópengő served it’s purposed, though not immune to the inflation, it managed to help the economy.\n\nA more permanent solution came after the introduction of the forint. The currency however is diffrent from the pengő and the adópengő. This new currency was gold standardize and thus have a stable backing and is able to be kept at a more sensible inflation rate. This is possible with the help of allied aid and the return of Hungarian gold reserves and also some austerity measures taken by the government. When forint was first introduced, it was pegged 1 forint = (4e+29) pengő dropping 29 zeroes. For the adópengő it was 1 forint = 200 million adópengő.\n\nThe replacement of the currency stopped the hyperinflation. The main causes of hyperinflation like the oversaturation of currency and the speculatory demands of the public stopped and the Hungarian economy recovered and even though it was a part of the Eastern bloc, the country preserved a more liberal style economy more akin to their Western neighbors than to the USSR.\n\nReferences\n\nBomberger, W.
