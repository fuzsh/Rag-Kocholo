        "text": "The Hungarian forint is the official currency of Hungary. Apart from the international symbol HUF, it is also written with the abbreviation Ft. It is divided into 100 filler.\n\nThe Hungarian forint\n\nHUF is the official currency of Hungary. It is not valid in other countries. Therefore, before going to the land of wine and bell pepper, it is worth checking the forint exchange rate. Buying forints in advance is a good idea. The HUF/EUR currency pair is popular, so one should have no problem finding it at an exchange office. The conversion of HUF to EUR can also be done online at our portal.\n\nThe history of the forint\n\nThe first Hungarian forints were minted as early as 1252. The name comes from the city of Florence, where gold coins were called fiorino d'oro. In Hungarian, the name florentinus was first adapted and later forint. Forint as a currency name was also used during the reign of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. The Hungarian forint appeared again in 1946. At that time, HUF replaced the pengo, which had become almost worthless due to hyperinflation. The value of the forint was related to gold. One kilogram of this precious metal was equivalent to 13,210 forints. The forint exchange rate remained stable against main currencies for the first 20 years of its existence. However, it lost its purchasing power in the 1970s and 1980s. The HUF also struggled with high inflation at the beginning of the regime changes in 1989 and 1990.\n\nThe Hungarian forint - key information\n\nThe Hungarian forint divides into 100 filler, but due to this currency's low value, hundredths went out of circulation in 1999, and their production ceased much earlier - in 1992. Currently, coins come in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 forints. Until 2008, 1 and 2 HUF denominations were also used, but they were withdrawn due to the money's low value. Initially, the 200-forint coin was minted from silver, but this procedure was abandoned. The bullion value was much higher than the nominal value of the coin. Nowadays, in Hungary, all cash transactions prices are rounded up to either 0 or 5 forints. Banknotes come in denominations of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 forints. They depict Hungarian rulers and the reverse features places or events associated with them.\n\nCheck HUF exchange rate\n\nThe Hungarian currency (HUF) is not very popular on the global market. However, Hungary is becoming a tourist destination, so the forint to euro can be easily converted in many stationary and online exchange offices. Due to the low value of the forint, the HUF/EUR exchange rate is usually presented for 100 units of the Hungarian currency."
