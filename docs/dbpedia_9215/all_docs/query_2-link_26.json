The people who come up with the clues are obviously smart and I don’t expect them to know a lot of economics, but how would one think that printing more money “fights” inflation rather than adding to it? I don’t understand their mental model.\n\nOne of my favorite articles on hyperinflations, not surprisingly, is the one I commissioned for my Concise Encyclopedia of Economics.\n\nIt’s Michael K. Salemi, “Hyperinflation.” Notice that in the third paragraph, he discusses the Hungarian inflation that Jeopardy alluded to. It was substantially more extreme than the German hyperinflation of 1921 to 1923.\n\nAllan Meltzer, of Carnegie Mellon University, talks with EconTalk host Russ Roberts about the current state of monetary policy and the potential for inflation. Meltzer explains why inflation hasn't happened yet, despite massive increases in reserves created by Fed policy.
