Image Source:\n\n30 Product Attributes Cultural differences Economic development\n\nDimensions such as language, religion, and education Note: some tastes and preferences are becoming cosmopolitan Economic development Consumers in highly developed countries tend to demand extra performance attributes in their products Price is less important due to high income level Consumers in less developed countries value basic features as more important Price is a factor due to lower income level Cars: no air-conditioning, power steering, power windows, radios, and cassette players Product reliability is more important Product and technical standards television/cell phone signal frequencies\n\n31 Distribution Strategy\n\nOptimal channel for delivering a product to the consumer Retail concentration (Concentrated vs. Fragmented) Concentrated system (a few retailers supply most of the market) Common in developed countries Contributing factors: increase in car ownership, number of households with refrigerators and freezers, and two-income households Fragmented system (small retailers without much market share supply the market) Common in developing countries Contributing factors: great population density with large number of city/village centers, e.g. China Uneven or mountainous terrain, e.g. Nepal Channel length (Long vs. Short) Example a short distribution channel is where the producer sells directly to the consumer. (Channel length is longer in Fragmented Markets) Channel exclusivity Japan - exclusive systems because personal relations, often decades old, play an important role in stocking products\n\n32 Communication Strategy\n\nDefines the process the firm will use in communicating the attributes of its product to prospective customers Cultural barriers Source effects Noise levels Image Source:\n\n33 HSBC Local Content & Point of View Ads\n\nSource: HSBC, Constance Kratsa\n\n34 Lost in Translation The name Coca-Cola in China was first rendered as Ke-ke-ken-la. Unfortunately, the Coke company did not discover until after thousands of signs had been printed that the phrase means \"bite the wax tadpole\" or \"female horse stuffed with wax\" (depending on the dialect). Coke then researched 40,000 Chinese characters and found a close phonetic equivalent, \"ko-kou-ko-le,\" which can be loosely translated as \"happiness in the mouth.“ The Scandinavian vacuum manufacturer Electrolux tried to sell its goods in America but didn't help itself with this slogan, \"Nothing sucks like an Electrolux.\" In Taiwan, the translation of the Pepsi slogan \"Come alive with the Pepsi Generation\" came out as \"Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead.\"\n\n35 Barriers to International Communication\n\nCultural Barriers Firms should use local input such as local advertising agency and sales force & Develop cross-cultural literacy Source and country of origin effects Receiver of the message evaluates the message based on status or image of the sender (i.e. Anti-Japan wave in US in 1990’s) Place of manufacturing influences product evaluations (Often used when consumer lacks more detailed knowledge of the product) Examples: French wines, Italian clothes, and German luxury cars Noise levels Amount of other messages competing for a potential customer’s attention Developed countries - high Less developed countries - low Standardized advertising strategy execution more difficult (culture, laws)\n\n36 Push Versus Pull Strategy\n\nPush strategy emphasizes personal selling Requires intense use of a sales force Relatively costly Pull strategy depends on mass media advertising Can be cheaper for a large market segment Determining factors include: product type and consumer sophistication; Channel length; & Media availability Pull Strategy: Consumer goods Large market segment Long distribution channels Mass communication has cost advantages Push Strategy: Industrial products or complex new products Direct selling allows firms to educate users Short distribution channels Used in poorer nations for consumer goods where direct selling only way to reach consumers Edu (Tanzania) Recycle (India)\n\n37 Push vs. Pull Channel Length Media Availability Pull strategy\n\nEdu (Tanzania) Recycle (India) Push vs. Pull Channel Length Pull strategy Long or exclusive distribution channels e.g. Japan Mass advertising to generate demand to pull product through various layers Push Strategy In countries with low literacy levels to educate consumers Media Availability Relies on access to advertising media Common in developed nations Push strategy Media availability limited by law All electronic media state owned with no commercial policy\n\n38 Global Advertising Standardized: Non-standardized:\n\nSignificant economic advantages Scarce creative talent Many global brand names Non-standardized: Cultural differences Advertising regulations can be a restriction Image Source:\n\n39 Global Advertising Adidas Jose + 10 (2006 World Cup Commercial) Visa\n\nVisa Nike Ad Banned in China “Chamber of Fear,” stars the NBA’s LeBron James battling a martial arts expert and a pair of dragons, and resisting the temptation of traditionally garbed women in a video game-style setting.

Exchange Rate at time 0 = 5MYR/1USD Subsidiary purchases land with 500,000 ringgit. Exchange rate at time 1 = 4MYR/1USD If this new exchange rate is used to convert the value of the land back into dollars, it will seem that the land has appreciated by 25%! The new value of 500,000 ringgit in dollars is $125,000! (500,000MYR ÷ 4MYR/USD)\n\n47 Temporal Method: Example\n\nAt time = 0 a U.S. firm invests $100,000 in a Malaysian subsidiary.

Revenue can be in the form of overdue bills, royalties and dividends, local earnings, or unpaid trade credits. Why do governments block funds? To regulate the transfer of FX because of hard currency shortages. Methods of blocking funds: Restrictions on the percentage of revenues that can be repatriated, or making the currency inconvertible.

The highest denomination in 1995 was 5,000,000 kwanzas reajustados. In the 1999 currency reform, 1 new kwanza was exchanged for 1,000,000 kwanzas reajustados. The overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 new kwanza = 1,000,000,000 pre 1991 kwanzas. Argentina (1975 – 1991) At the beginning of 1975, the highest denomination was 1,000 pesos. In late 1976, the highest denomination was 5,000 pesos. In early 1979, the highest denomination was 10,000 pesos. By the end of 1981, the highest denomination was 1,000,000 pesos. In the 1985 currency reform, 1 austral was exchanged for 1,000 pesos argentino. In the 1992 currency reform, 1 new peso was exchanged for 10,000 australes. The overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 (1992) peso = 100,000,000,000 pre-1983 pesos. Belarus (1994 – 2002). In 1993, the highest denomination was 5,000 rublei. By 1999, it was 5,000,000 rublei. In the 2000 currency reform, the ruble was replaced by the new ruble at an exchange rate of 1 new ruble = 1,000 old rublei. The highest denomination in 2002 was 50,000 rublei, equal to 50,000,000 pre-2000 rublei. Bolivia (1984 – 1986). Before 1984, the highest denomination was 1,000 pesos bolivianos. In 1985, a Bolivian note for 1 million pesos was worth 55 cents in US dollars, one-thousandth of its exchange value of $5,000 less than three years previously. In the 1987 currency reform, the Peso Boliviano was replaced by the Boliviano at a rate of 1,000,000 : 1. Brazil (1986 – 1994), the base currency unit was shifted three times to adjust for inflation in the final years of the Brazilian military dictatorship era. A 1960s cruzeiro was, in 1994, worth less than one trillionth of a US cent, after adjusting for multiple devaluations and note changes. A new currency called real was adopted in 1994, and hyperinflation was eventually brought under control. The real was also the currency in use until 1942; 1 (current) real is the equivalent of 2,750,000,000,000,000,000 of those old reals. Chile (1971), during the presidency of Salvador Allende, Chilean inflation began to rise and reached peaks of 1,200% Germany (1923). In 1922, the highest denomination was 50,000 Mark. By 1923, the highest denomination was 100,000,000,000,000 Mark. In December 1923 the exchange rate was 4,200,000,000,000 Marks to 1 US dollar. In 1923, the rate of inflation hit 3.25 × 106 percent per month (prices double every two days). Beginning on November 20, 1923, 1,000,000,000,000 old Marks were exchanged for 1 Rentenmark so that 4.2 Rentenmarks were worth 1 US dollar, exactly the same rate the Mark had in 1914. Greece (1944). In 1943, the highest denomination was 25,000 drachmai. By 1944, the highest denomination was 100,000,000,000,000 drachmai. In the 1944 currency reform, 1 new drachma was exchanged for 50,000,000,000 drachmai. Another currency reform in 1953 replaced the drachma at an exchange rate of 1 new drachma = 1,000 old drachma. The overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 (1953) drachma = 50,000,000,000,000 pre 1944 drachmai. The Greek inflation rate reached 8.5 billion percent per month (prices double every 28 hours). Hungary (1945 – 1946). In 1944, the highest denomination was 1,000 pengő. By the end of 1945, it was 10,000,000 pengő. The highest denomination in mid-1946 was 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 pengő. The rate of inflation was 4.19 quintillion (4.19 x 1018) percent. A special currency the adópengő - or tax pengő - was created for tax and postal payments. The value of the adópengő was adjusted each day, by radio announcement. On January 1, 1946 one adópengő equaled one pengő. By late July, one adópengő equaled 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 2×1021pengő. On the 1st of August, ,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 4×1029 (four hundred octillion [ short scale ] ) pengő became 1 forint.

A roll costs $145,750 (US$0.69). Toilet paper, bread, margarine, meat, and tea — have become unimaginable luxuries. The government tripled the salaries of civil servants The government admitted that it had printed at least $21 trillion in local currency — and critics say much more — to buy the American dollars to pay IMF loans. The rise of inflation was caused by a flight of foreign capital (after the government seized farmland), and a steep increase in the money supply - the fall was caused by a rise in interest rates and an economic slowdown.

Critics argue: 1) it penalizes early cash flows too much and 2) does not penalize distant cash flows enough. Change the cash flows\n\n67 Formula for NPV Net Present Value (NPV) is the sum of discounted expected cash flows. Example: expect $10 for 3 years at a 5% discount rate.\n\n68 Expected CF IRR = 20% NPV = 0 40 100 110 130 160 200 (10) (50) (80)\n\n(100) IRR = 20% NPV = 0\n\n69 Increase the Discount Rate\n\n40 100 110 130 160 200 (10) (50) (80) (100) Discount Rate = 10% Positive NPV = 141 Discount Rate = 15% New NPV = 30\n\n70 Reduce Future CFs Discount Rate = 10% New NPV = 102 40 100 110 130 130\n\n(10) (50) (80) (100) Discount Rate = 10% New NPV = 102\n\n71 “The goal of financial forecasting is to turn chaos into error.”\n\nElliott Smith, Boston College\n\n72 Financing Decisions Source of Financing Financial Structure\n\nGlobal Capital Markets Typically have a lower cost of capital Local debt financing Use local debt financing if the currency is expected to depreciate (because if you have foreign debt, it will take more of the depreciated currency to repay your loans). Financial Structure Debt – Equity Ratios Tax laws regarding dividends and interest Norms Average debt ratio in Singapore is 0.34 Average debt ratio in Italy is 0.76 Average debt ratio in US & UK is 0.55 Use local debt financing if the currency is expected to depreciate… because if you have foreign debt it will take more of the depreciated currency to pay for it.
