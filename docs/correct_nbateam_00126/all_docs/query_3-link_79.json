        "text": "Marvin Williams may be on the move to the NBA's top team, with the Milwaukee Bucks reported to be signing the Bremerton native following his release by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nThe 33-year-old could be signed as soon as Monday, according to ESPN, after he becomes an unrestricted free agent. The Bucks, who own the NBA's best record at 44-7 and are among the favorites to win the title behind MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo, could sign Williams for a veterans minimum deal of $956,000. Charlotte paid out the remainder of his $15 million salary in Saturday's roster move.\n\nThe 6-foot-8 Williams averaged 7.9 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 27.1 minutes per game since joining the Hornets in 2014. His veteran presence and three-point shooting ability (he's a 36.1% shooter from three for his career) are seen as assets to Milwaukee, contending for its first trip to the NBA Finals since 1974.\n\nWilliams was originally drafted No. 2 overall in 2005 by the Atlanta Hawks after playing one season at North Carolina after graduating from Bremerton High School in 2004.\n\nHis 429 games played in Charlotte ranks sixth all-time, his 681 3-point field goals made ranks third and his 2,293 total rebounds rank eighth on the franchiseâ€™s all-time leaderboard.\n\nWilliams has played in 41 games this season for the Hornets mostly in a reserve role, averaging 6.7 points per game in 19.7 minutes. During his career Williams spent time with Utah (2012-14) and Atlanta (2005-12), and made 49 appearances in the playoffs.\n\nWilliams wasn't the only player Charlotte waived on Saturday. The Hornets also bought out the contract of former No. 2 draft pick Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Going into Saturday night's game against Dallas, Charlotte was 16-35, just three games out of the Eastern Conference cellar. They have not made the playoffs since 2016.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
