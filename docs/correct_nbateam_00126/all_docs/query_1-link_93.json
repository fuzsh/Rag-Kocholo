        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nATLANTA — Atlanta forward Marvin Williams was suspended one game without pay for committing a flagrant foul, penalty two in the Hawks’ Game 7 playoff loss in Boston.\n\nWilliams, who will serve the suspension in his first game next season, knocked Boston’s Rajon Rondo to the floor with 9:09 left in the third period of the Celtics’ 99-65 victory on Sunday.\n\nWilliams, trying to prevent a breakaway basket by Rondo, put an arm across Rondo’s chest and knocked the guard to the floor. Rondo lay for a few minutes while Celtics coaches and teammates checked on him.\n\nAfter reviewing the play, officials threw Williams out of the game.\n\nWilliams said he didn’t try to hurt Rondo.\n\n“I saw it on TV and it did look pretty bad, so I can’t argue that at all,” Williams said Sunday. “I just want Rondo to know that I would never try to hurt him.”"
