        "text": "By Nathan Joyce of the Kitsap Sun\n\nBremerton</p> <p>Through his rookie season, the Atlanta Hawks were content to bring Marvin Williams along slowly, shelter their teenage phenom from the pressures that come with being the second player taken in the NBA draft.</p> <p>There's a different strategy in place for his sophomore campaign.</p> <p>Marvin Williams, version 2.0, was unveiled at the Rocky Mountain Revue summer league, which wrapped up on July 21 in Salt Lake City. Williams was named MVP after he led the six-team league in scoring at 23.2 points per game.</p> <p>\"We spoke to him about not only coming here and playing, but coming here and dominating,\" Hawks assistant coach Larry Drew, who was running the summer-league team, told ESPN.com. \"He came in here knowing it wouldn't be satisfactory just to play OK. He had to come in here and really make a mark, and that's what he's done.\"</p> <p>The Williams that showed up at summer league was a more aggressive model.</p> <p>\"I definitely think so,\" said Williams, who returned to Bremerton for a few days last week. \"(Head coach Mike Woodson) said he was giving me the green light. He just wanted me to go: See a shot, take a shot.\"</p> <p>Williams, who turned 20 last month, also showed off an improved post game.</p> <p>\"The whole summer, I've been trying to work on a couple back-to-the-basket moves,\" he said. \"I've been doing a lot of work this summer, and it's good to see it pay off.\"</p> <p>Shortly after his rookie season, in which he averaged 8.5 points and 4.8 rebounds in 24.7 minutes, Williams headed back to Chapel Hill, N.C.</p> <p>The return to Tar Heel country served dual purposes. First, it allowed him to work with UNC's strength and conditioning coordinator, Jonas Sahratian, who Williams grew close with during his NCAA championship run.</p> <p>Second, it allowed him to get back to work on his degree. Williams took a couple more classes this summer, and academically, he's just starting his sophomore season. Though he doesn't know what his major will be, he plans to return to Chapel Hill every summer to work out physically and mentally.</p> <p>\"I personally feel like I'm working hard,\" he said. \"If you can lay your head down at the end of the day and say you worked hard, that's what it's all about.\"</p> <p>And there's plenty of work to do. Williams was in Las Vegas this weekend for a mini-camp. Next, he'll head to San Diego for a few days to work out with some of the Hawks' coaching staff. Then it's back to North Carolina for more work.</p> <p>With Al Harrington likely on his way out of town in a sign-and-trade deal with the Indiana Pacers that's been rumored for weeks, Williams figures to slip into the Atlanta's starting lineup at small forward.</p> <p>Even with Harrington on his way out of town, the team doesn't plan to hand the keys over the Williams.</p> <p>\"Not at this state,\" Drew told ESPN.com. \"Down the road he may grow into that type of player, but Joe (Johnson) has been our guy.\"</p> <p>Johnson, who signed a big free-agent deal with Atlanta the previous offseason, led the team in scoring at 20.2 points per game.</p> <p>\"Right now, it's going to be Joe's team,\" Williams said on ESPN.com. \"You know, us young guys have to so much to learn â€” and Joe's been through the battles. ... He's been on a great team, playing with Phoenix. So I'm just trying to sit back and learn a little bit from him right now.\"</p> <p>Top Five Teenagers</p> <p>Here's a look at how teenagers taken in the top five of the NBA draft since 1995 have performed in their rookie seasons (American born players only).</p> <p>Player, team Year Pick Minutes Points</p> <p>Carmelo Anthony, Den* 2003 3rd 36.5 21.0</p> <p>LeBron James, Cle 2003 1st 31.3 20.9</p> <p>Lamar Odom, LAC* 1999 4th 36.4 16.6</p> <p>Dwight Howard, Orl 2004 1st 32.6 12.0</p> <p>Chris Bosh, Tor* 2003 4th 33.5 11.5</p> <p>Kevin Garnett, Minn 1995 5th 28.7 10.4</p> <p>Darius Miles, LAC 2000 3rd 26.3 9.4</p> <p>Marvin Williams, Atl* 2005 2nd 24.7 8.5</p> <p>Shaun Livingston.
