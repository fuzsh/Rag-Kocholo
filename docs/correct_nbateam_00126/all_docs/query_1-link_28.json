        "text": "BOSTON - NBA players don’t often get caught by surprise in postgame media scrums, but Kemba Walker was by a reporter after the Boston Celtics win over the Atlanta Hawks.\n\n“Marvin Williams looks like he’s going to the Bucks after getting a buyout...”\n\nA shocked Walker looked up and said, “that’s what they said? He’s going to the Bucks? Nooo.\"\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n“DAMN.”\n\nAnd then he walked off, still incredulously saying “he’s going to Milwaukee?” and “I’m going to call him.” The last thing he said before he walked out the door was “I’m pissed.\"\n\nWilliams and Walker were teammates for four years in Charlotte. The 6′8″ Williams spent all of that time as a reliable threat from the 3-point line. Even as his role has diminished in Charlotte, Williams is still shooting 37.6 percent from deep. He’s they type of player the Boston Celtics could use.\n\nThat’s probably why, according the Boston Globe’s Adam Himmelsbach, Walker spent a month trying to recruit his former teammate to Boston. It’s probably why the news, originally reported by Shams Charania, legitimately upset Walker. Not only does Boston not get the help they could use, but his friend and long-time teammate is about to join the best team in the East.\n\nWalker and Williams will surely have a conversation. They might have already. It’s hard to blame Williams for making the move the Milwaukee, especially since Walker left Charlotte for most of the same reasons. Still, it’s a bitter pill for Walker to swallow.\n\nHere’s video of his reaction.\n\nMORE CELTICS COVERAGE\n\n° Jayson Tatum carries Boston Celtics to ugly 112-107 win over the Atlanta Hawks\n\n° Kemba Walker plans to go at Jayson Tatum in All-Star game"
