He played one season of college basketball for North Carolina before being drafted second overall by the Atlanta Hawks in the 2005 NBA draft.\n\nHigh school career\n\nBorn and raised in Bremerton, Washington, Williams attended Bremerton High School, where he was a two-time all-state selection and the Washington Player of the Year by the Associated Press.
