        "text": "NBA Comparison: N/A\n\nStrengths: Elite level athlete, very quick and agile for a player of his size… Can play any position on the floor effectively.. Never out-worked or out-hustled… Doesn’t take plays off… Gives you everything he has whether it’s a high school playoff game or an AAU event… Excellent form on jumper… NBA range… Very effective when facing the hoop as he has a quick first step and utilizes his jabs and fakes to perfection… Court awareness is that of a vet… Finds teammates from anywhere on the court…An excellent passer from any spot on the floor who possesses great knowledge of the game…. At 6-9 he handles like a guard and has excellent touch out to 17 feet…. Great rebounder because of his size and ability to get off the ground quickly… Big game player… Plays his best in the clutch… A quick leaper who plays well above the rim. Has tremendous potential.\n\nWeaknesses: More of a wing/forward at this point… Doesn’t play well with his back to the basket as he hasn’t developed a go-to post move… Must improve strength as he won’t always be able to rely on his athletic ability at the next level… Is a shot blocker but has trouble defending smaller quicker players…As with all young guys not named LeBron or Carmelo, he struggles with consistency…."
