        "text": "CHARLOTTE - Almost everyone knows the feeling of going on a long trip and the excitement that comes with the thought of finally going home. You just want to be with your family and melt into your own comfortable, familiar furniture.\n\nMarvin Williams can definitely relate.\n\nAt noon Sunday, he will return to Charlotte where he and the Milwaukee Bucks will face the Hornets for the first time since Williams left Charlotte via buyout in early February, ending a nearly six-year run with the team. The game, though, is the last thing Williams is thinking about.\n\n“Man, I’m just excited to sleep in my bed,” Williams said with a laugh. “I’ve been in a hotel for about 2 1/2 weeks now. I’m just excited to get back to my bed.”\n\nA native of Washington state, Williams has called North Carolina home since matriculating to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2004. He continued to take classes at UNC after leaving for the NBA after one season, ultimately graduating in 2014. He has spent time living and training in the state every summer, sinking his family's roots there.\n\nHis home base won't shift with him now that he's with the Bucks, either.\n\n\"I think those fans know how I feel about them; I certainly know how they feel about me,\" Williams said. \"I couldn’t be more thankful for the way they treated me and my family the six years that I was there. Charlotte is really, really a special place to me. It’s my home now. That’s where me and my family live in the offseason and that’s where we’ll stay, but those fans and that city were a big influence on that decision.”\n\nBeing in Charlotte for 5 1/2 seasons was a perfect fit for Williams and his family, but that situation ultimately ran its course. The Hornets are a young, rebuilding team and Williams is a 15-year veteran who was a beloved locker-room presence, but he has bigger goals than the Hornets would be able to help him achieve.\n\nThe split between Williams and the Hornets was both understandable and amicable. Once the trade deadline passed and Charlotte hadn't found a deal to get something in return for Williams, the two sides worked quickly on a buyout agreement.\n\nAs much as there was a definitive split between Williams and the Hornets, Williams has no interest in severing ties with the organization. He talks to his former teammates, coaches and other Hornets support staff all the time. He's watched their games, checked for their highlights and sought out their box scores.\n\nIf he's learned anything in the NBA during his 15 seasons and four different stops, Williams knows that relationships can and do endure trades, free agency, rivalries and more.\n\n\"I think the one thing that I’ve been the most thankful for in the NBA is the friendships that I’ve made,\" Williams said. \"I’ve been really blessed, man, to play with some really cool people, to work with some really cool people. When you’re friends, no matter where you’re at, you’re going to stay close. Myself, Kemba (Walker), Jeremy Lamb, Frank Kaminsky, Michael Carter-Williams, we’re all on different teams and we talk 2-3 times a week.\n\n\"So it’s just like, no matter where you’re at you’re always going to support each other; I’m always going to support those guys and let them know I’m here for them, I’m always watching them. But I do play for Milwaukee now and this is my focus and Charlotte should be their focus.”\n\nAs far as turning his main focus to Milwaukee, Williams has hit the ground running. He's surpassed Ersan Ilyasova as the team's backup power forward and has meshed well both with the second unit as well as his opportunities to play with starters like Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton.\n\nAntetokounmpo has appreciated what Williams brings and the way he's meshed with him and his teammates since the Bucks picked him up.\n\n\"He's a great player,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"From Day 1 that he came to the team, I think we just connected. Obviously, I talked a little bit with him the day he arrived with the team and I thought he appreciated that. Now, even on the basketball court, I know he's going to be in the right spot and he's got so much experience he knows when to give me outlets, he knows when to talk to me. So far, he's a great player.\"\n\nWilliams is averaging 5.0 points and 4.0 rebounds in 17.0 minutes per game over his first six contests with the Bucks. He's already built a making a third of his three-pointers (6 of 18) while contributing stout defense, something that was on display particularly on Tuesday when he took turns guarding Toronto Raptors forward Pascal Siakam and made things tough on the all-star.\n\nFor Williams, he knows that's exactly the kind of thing he was brought in to do.\n\n“I think that’s probably what we expected the most, that he would be able to come in and guard and guard different types of people,\" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \"He’s strong, he’s got a physical presence, he’s got good feet and, again, he studies the game, he understands it, so I think defensively is where we feel like he’s probably going to get the most comfortable the quickest.”\n\nAs much as Williams' defensive abilities preceded his arrival, he's still impressed his teammates with what he's brought to the court on that end. With the Bucks up by 32 in the fourth quarter of a game last week in Detroit, Williams hit the deck while poking the ball away from Christian Wood -- the kind of effort you might not expect late in a blowout.\n\nWilliams' quick hands and great positioning have translated into eight steals over his first six games as a Buck, an average of 1.3 per game.\n\n“I think everybody’s starting to realize what he can bring to this team,\" Middleton said. \"I mean, not just his shooting ability but his energy plays, his veteran leadership as far as doing things by example, putting his body on other guys down on the floor, just extra possessions and stuff like that that’s going to be huge come playoff time.”\n\nKnowing there will be playoff time is an exciting prospect for Williams. He hasn't been in the postseason since 2016 and has never been on a team that's reached the conference semifinals.\n\nAs he heads back to Charlotte, his home and NBA stomping grounds for the past six years, though, Williams isn't thinking about the playoffs or the game itself, the fan response to him when he checks in or even reconnecting with his old teammates and friends. Williams, the weary traveller, is singularly focused.\n\n“The thing I’m most excited about is sleeping in my bed, honestly,\" Williams reiterated with a smile."
