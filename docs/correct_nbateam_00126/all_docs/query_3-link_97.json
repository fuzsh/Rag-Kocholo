        "text": "Source: Streeter Lecka (via SI.com)\n\nOne of the major pieces from last year’s team is back: after a brief flirtation with the Brooklyn Nets, Marvin Williams has re-signed with the Hornets on a 4-year deal worth $54.5 million. The amount may seem steep but, just like Nicolas Batum’s deal, it’s actually a bargain. Players like Williams could fit on just about any team in the league, and that kind of demand could really drive his price up.\n\nOf course, players like Williams aren’t entirely rare, either. If Williams actually left play with Jeremy Lin in Brooklyn, it wouldn’t have been impossible to replace him. Still, Williams has experience with the team and it’s clear how he fits in. Perhaps most importantly, he’s a plus defender, which is something that can’t be said for many of his possible replacements. Getting him back on a discount is a major steal.\n\nCharlotte should have about $10 million remaining to sign players, and are in the market for a backup guard and big man to replace the departed Lin and Al Jefferson. There are possible trade options on the market, too — the Orlando Magic, for example, have an especially crowded front court after the first few days of free agency and could be looking to move on from one of their players.\n\nSource: Streeter Lecka (via SI.com)\n\nOne of the major pieces from last year’s team is back: after a brief flirtation with the Brooklyn Nets, Marvin Williams has re-signed with the Hornets on a 4-year deal worth $54.5 million.
