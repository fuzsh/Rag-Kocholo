        "text": "CHARLOTTE – When Marvin Williams came into the NBA in 2005, he had just left North Carolina as a NCAA champion in his only year of college basketball.\n\nAnd Williams worked and improved and was a part of an Atlanta Hawks rebuilding process that took four years but ended up with three consecutive first-round playoff wins.\n\nA potential free agent for the Charlotte Hornets after their surprising 48-34 season that ended with a Game 7 first round playoff loss to Miami, Williams thinks team management should keep the team together in hopes of reproducing what he and the Hawks accomplished.\n\n“Yeah, I feel like any time, especially in pro sports, when you keep a group of guys together for three or four years, whatever the case may be, you can do some really good things,” Williams said. “Sometimes there is so much change throughout the course of a season that to really get steady improvement in basketball or any sport I feel like (is hard).\n\n“When you keep a core group of guys together you can really do some things. I was part of a group in Atlanta where four or five of us stayed together for five, six, seven years and we were really able to build something special.\n\n“So hopefully we can do that here.”\n\nFor Williams’ seven years in Atlanta, the Hawks kept Williams paired with Joe Johnson for each season, with Josh Smith for six seasons, Al Horford for five and Mike Bibby for four.\n\nThose Hawks teams won 53 games in 2010, won first-round series in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and won 16 playoff games in seven postseason series.\n\nWith Charlotte having seven free agents entering the summer – Williams and fellow playoff starters Nicolas Batum, Courtney Lee and Al Jefferson are free agents along with reserves Jeremy Lin, Tyler Hansbrough and Jorge Gutierrez – should Hornets owner Michael Jordan, general manager Rich Cho and head coach Steve Clifford do all they can to keep this team together?\n\nTo a man, the players said they loved the “culture” that was created this year and want to keep this team together. In fact, they would argue, the addition of a healthy Michael Kidd-Gilchrist – he needed two shoulder surgeries that limited him to seven games this season – will push this group to greater heights if it’s kept intact.\n\nClifford would agree with that assessment.\n\n“I’d love to have another chance with the same group,” Clifford said at his postseason news conference last Monday. “Obviously that will be difficult.”\n\nAt his postgame news conference last Wednesday, Cho established re-signing Batum as the team’s top priority.\n\nHe also indicated he expected improvement from every player on the roster and cited adding a “rim protector” on the frontline as a way to improve the Hornets’ defense.\n\n“It’s definitely a big emphasis to bring as many of the guys back as possible,” Cho said. “As you know, it’s probably unrealistic to think we are going to have all 15 guys back. That’s just not the way that it happens in the NBA historically. But we do want to bring as many guys back as possible.”\n\nWilliams, who will be entering his 12th season in the NBA next year, is confident he and his teammates will work to make sure they improve upon what was accomplished in a year that began with low expectations.\n\n“I think we found out what we were made of,” Williams said. “I think at the beginning of the year, I’m not really sure how many people believed in us. We really came out and competed this season and fought through a lot of adversity like losing one of our best players in MKG.\n\n“Obviously in the playoff series, we got a couple of wins and put ourselves in a great position to advance. It’s definitely something to build on. I told the guys during Game 7 when we were down pretty big that we have to learn from this experience. I’m sure everybody will learn from it.”\n\nRichard Walker: 704-869-1841; twitter.com/jrwalk22\n\n2015-16 Hornets roster\n\nNo. 5 Nicolas Batum\n\n6-8, 200, 7th year (France)\n\nComment: Will be one of the most coveted free agents in the NBA this offseason and Hornets consider retaining him their top priority.\n\nNo. 30 Troy Daniels\n\n6-4, 205, 2nd year (Virginia Commonwealth)\n\nComment: Reserve sharpshooter earned coaching staff’s trust with his professionalism and work ethic.\n\nNo. 12 Jorge Gutierrez\n\n6-3, 191, 2nd year (California)\n\nComment: Signed at midseason as a backup point guard, he was a favorite of the coaching staff for his readiness and coachability.\n\nNo. 50 Tyler Hansbrough\n\n6-9, 250, 6th year (North Carolina)\n\nComment: Popular former Tar Heels’ standout was a deep reserve but was able to provide energy and intensity when he was called upon.\n\nNo. 9 Aaron Harrison\n\n6-6, 210, 1st year (Kentucky)\n\nComment: Bounced back and forth between the active roster and the D-League, but team remains intrigued by his potential\n\nNo. 00 Spencer Hawes\n\n7-1, 245, 8th year (Washington)\n\nComment: Provided depth on the frontcourt and was effective in playoff series with Miami by being able to spread out the Heat defense.\n\nNo. 25 Al Jefferson\n\n6-10, 289, 11h year (Prentiss, Miss., HS)\n\nComment: After role changed from starter to backup after early-season drug suspension and knee surgery, it will be interesting to see how hard Hornets pursue him.\n\nNo. 44 Frank Kaminsky\n\n7-0, 242, 1st year (Wisconsin)\n\nComment: Picked up valuable experience in his first NBA season and coaching staff confident he’ll improve even more in the future.\n\nNo. 14 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist\n\n6-7, 232, 3rd year (Kentucky)\n\nComment: His year was a tale of “what might have been?” as MKG needed shoulder twice during to injuries in the preseason and regular season.\n\nNo. 3 Jeremy Lamb\n\n6-5, 185, 3rd year (Connecticut)\n\nComment: Appeared to be an early-season revelation, but his improvement – and minutes – were less in the second half of the season.\n\nNo. 1 Courtney Lee\n\n6-5, 200, 7th year (Western Kentucky)\n\nComment: Trade deadline acquisition from Memphis was a near-perfect fit for the team and aided its late-season surge.\n\nNo. 7 Jeremy Lin\n\n6-3, 200, 5th year (Harvard)\n\nComment: He thrived as backup point guard and off-guard and played a huge role in the team’s success.\n\nNo. 15 Kemba Walker\n\n6-1, 172, 4th year (Connecticut)\n\nComment: Had perhaps his best NBA season while also setting a franchise-record for single-game scoring with 52 in an overtime win over Utah in January.\n\nNo. 2 Marvin Williams\n\n6-9, 237, 10th year (North Carolina)\n\nComment: Made a remarkable transformation from post-up player to 3-point shooter in addition to remaining a determined rebounder and defender.\n\nNo. 40 Cody Zeller\n\n7-0, 240, 2nd year (Indiana)\n\nComment: Was slated to become a “stretch 4” when season started, but he replaced Jefferson at center and Hornets are comfortable keeping him there."
