        "text": "Chuck Burton/Associated Press\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets have reportedly re-signed forward Marvin Williams, agreeing to a four-year, $54.5 million contract, per Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical. Wojnarowski added that Williams \"had offers in the $15 [million]-a-year range\" but \"loved playing in Charlotte.\"\n\nMarc Stein of ESPN.com reported Friday the Hornets front office had shifted its focus to retaining Williams after coming to terms with Nicolas Batum. Shams Charania of The Vertical previously passed along word of the Batum deal, which checked in at $120 million over five years.\n\nWilliams was an underrated contributor for the Hornets last season. The North Carolina product averaged 11.7 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists while shooting 40.2 percent from beyond the arc. He also ranked seventh among all power forwards in Real Plus-Minus (2.67), according to ESPN.com.\n\nThe 30-year-old veteran told Matt Rochinski of Hornets.com back in May he was hoping to stay.\n\n\"There's no question that I want to return,\" Williams said. \"Obviously anything can happen in free agency. It's basketball and there is a business side as well, but I will let it be known right now that I do want to return and play with these guys. I want to play for [head coach Steve Clifford] again.\"\n\nWhat the Hornets lack in high-end star power, they've been able to make up for with terrific depth. That's why they went 48-34 to earn the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference last season. It's also why keeping players like Batum and Williams is crucial to offseason success.\n\nWilliams has found his comfort zone in the stretch 4 role. Add in Cody Zeller, Spencer Hawes and Frank Kaminsky, and Charlotte has a lot of different ways to mix and match up in the post to create problems for opponents in the frontcourt."
