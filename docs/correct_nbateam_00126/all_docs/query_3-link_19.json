        "text": "Williams embodies the exact type of player we look for when building the Hornets roster. He can defend multiple positions, brings versatility and improved shooting on the offensive end and is a veteran presence that our younger players look up to. We are excited to keep Marvin in Charlotte and build off last year’s success with him as a part of our team.\n\nThen small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist – the self-described middle linebacker of the Hornets – suffered a severe injury in the preseason that required major shoulder surgery. Williams took on Kidd-Gilchrist’s role as the centerpiece of the Hornets’ defensive schemes.\n\nHe isn’t Kidd-Gilchrist. Not many players are MKG’s peer defensively. But Williams has the length and agility to guard a wide spectrum of players. He’s effective interchangeably playing either power forward or small forward.\n\nAnd no matter how often [head coach Steve] Clifford calls on him to switch positions or assignments, he complies with a great attitude."
