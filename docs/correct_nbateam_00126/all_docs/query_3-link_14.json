        "text": "Bremerton native Marvin Williams walked off the basketball floor Tuesday night and into the next chapter of his life.\n\nWilliams announced his retirement after the Miami Heat eliminated the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 5 of a second-round NBA playoff series. Williams, who finished with 11 points and eight rebounds in Milwaukee's 103-94 loss, told ESPN after the game that his professional basketball career is over after 15 NBA seasons\n\n\"I've been very blessed. God has been very, very good to me,\" Williams said.\n\nSelected second overall by the Atlanta Hawks in the 2005 NBA draft, the 34-year-old Williams averaged 10.2 points and 5.2 rebounds in his career while playing for four teams: Atlanta, Utah, Charlotte and Milwaukee. He played one season in college, helping the University of North Carolina claim the NCAA championship in 2005.\n\nBremerton boys basketball coach Miah Davis, who watched Tuesday's game and corresponds with Williams on occasion, said he was caught off-guard by the announcement. Davis thinks Williams has the ability to keep competing at a high level.\n\n\"He still looks like a spring chicken,\" Davis said.\n\nWilliams' high school coach, Bremerton athletic director Casey Lindberg, doesn't doubt his former McDonald's All-American could keeping playing. He wasn't shocked, however, to hear that Williams kept his retirement comments to a minimum. As a NBA player who has made millions in his career, Williams always displayed a quiet, unassuming personality.\n\n\"That's how he was when he was 15 years old,\" Lindberg said.\n\nLiving in the Charlotte area, Williams understands his presence is still felt in his hometown. He returned to Bremerton in the summer of 2017 to play in the Kings of Kitsap Alumni Tournament, helping the Knights defeat Central Kitsap in the championship game.\n\nAfter the game, Williams spoke about being the namesake for the Marvin Williams Recreation Center, which opened in downtown Bremerton in 2018. Williams helped fund the $7.2 million center, which serves as a gathering place for young people.\n\n\"To have your name branded on something that will make such a difference in their lives is incredible,\" Williams said. \"The biggest thing is to give these kids a chance.\"\n\nLindberg said Williams deserves an opportunity to spend more time with his own family now, including his two young kids.\n\n\"Iâ€™m happy for him,\" Lindberg said. \"How many people do you know who have been a professional athlete at a pretty high level for 15 years?\""
