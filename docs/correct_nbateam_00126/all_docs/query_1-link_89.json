        "meta_description": "He was brilliant in the preseason and he was brilliant tonight for the Jazz. I didn't get to watch a lot of him in Atlanta, but all I hear is how bad he was. His real strength seems to be the combination of ball handling, shooting, and size along with being a stelar wing defender. Not a tremendous athlete, but certianly better than adequate.\nWhat am I missing?",

        "text": "Okay, I’ll name one on his own team: Al Horford.\n\nJosh Smith isn’t worth the max and any team that gives him the max will be recieving a hugely fundamentally flawed player, who, even after 8 yrs in the league still doesn’t know his limitations and is almost guaranteed to clash with the coach.\n\nNo, my main gripe is his overall decision making, which, yes, does include his horrible shot selection.\n\nHe is less of a headache because he is less of a headache. Name one coach that Josh has played under so far that hasn’t had a problem with him. And who is this guy you’re referring to who can’t play defense, because it sure isn’t Marvin Williams. Let’s see how they fared last yr in similar situations:\n\nSmith:\n\nIso PPP- .96\n\n%scored against- 39.6%\n\nFG% against- 40.3%\n\nPPP against in post up situations- .79\n\nWilliams:\n\nIso PPP- .87\n\n%scored against-37.8%\n\nFG% against- 37.5%\n\nPPP against in post up situations-.74\n\nSmith is the most overrated defender in the league. Mainly because he’s a tweener who plays undisciplined D. Off the ball, yes, he can make plays and shut down driving lanes. On the ball, he’s completely average. The only place where I’d consider him an elite defender is in fantasy leagues.\n\nCousins is one of the most physically dominant and skilled big men in the league. His offensive arsenal is good enough to be the primary option of a team but his shot selection is still bad, he doesn’t know his limitations and, although he does give effort to rotate on defense, he’s a wide bodied, foul prone defender with heavy feet. He still has a lot to learn about not forcing the issue and trusting his teammates, but he’s going into his 3rd year while Smith is going into his 9th."
