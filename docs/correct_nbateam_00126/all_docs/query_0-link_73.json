        "text": "Utah Jazz and Atlanta Hawks Swap Devin Harris and Marvin Williams\n\nOn July 11th, 2012, the Atlanta Hawks traded forward Marvin Williams to the Utah Jazz for guard Devin Harris.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks originally selected Marvin Williams out of North Carolina with the second pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. The Hawks were maligned for the decision to draft Williams. Atlanta was in need of a point guard and with players like Chris Paul and Deron Williams available, the Hawks still decided to add Williams despite having a bevy of forwards (Josh Smith, Josh Childress, Al Harrington) on the roster.\n\nAfter drafting Williams, the Hawks landed Phoenix Suns guard Joe Johnson in a sign-and-trade that netted the Suns Boris Diaw. The Hawks were 2-16 to start the season and struggled for much of the season. They finished 26-56, doubling their previous season’s win total. Williams had an average rookie season with 8.5 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 0.8 APG and 0.6 SPG in 79 games.\n\nWilliams became a full-time starter for the Hawks in his second year. He played in 64 games (63 starts) and managed 13.1 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 1.9 APG and 0.8 SPG in 34.0 MPG. The Hawks started off the 2006-07 season winning four out of their first five games, but still struggled. They finished with a 30-52 record.\n\nThe Hawks wound up with the 3rd pick in the 2007 NBA Draft and selected big man Al Horford from Florida. The addition of Horford would change Atlanta for the better. Atlanta maintained a .500 record after the first 36 games. The Hawks were 22-28 when they traded for point guard Mike Bibby from Sacramento. Atlanta was so-so throughout the season and finished with a 37-45 record. They qualified for the eighth seed in the East by beating out the Indiana Pacers by a one-game margin. Williams continued to improve as a player with 14.8 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 1.7 APG and 1.0 SPG in 80 games and 34.6 MPG.\n\nThe Hawks faced the Boston Celtics in an uphill battle of a first round matchup. The Celtics handled the Hawks easily in Games One and Two. Atlanta managed to respond well with two straight wins to even up the series. Both teams split Games Five and Six before the Celtics ended the series with a 99-65 victory.\n\nAtlanta became a strong Eastern Conference team behind a 21-10 start during the 2008-09 season. On the strength of a top-ten offense, the Hawks finished with a 47-35 record which was the fourth best record in the Eastern Conference. Williams saw action in 61 games (59 starts) and managed 13.9 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 1.3 APG and 0.9 SPG in 34.3 MPG. He also expanded his range from further out. After attempting just ten three-pointers for the 2007-08 season, Williams attempted 155 and shot 35.5% on treys.\n\nThe Hawks faced the fifth-seeded Miami Heat in the first round of the postseason. The series was split even after the first four games. After Games Five and Six featured the Hawks and Heat winning respective games, the Hawks won the final Game Seven in Atlanta. In the Semifinals, the Hawks were ran out of the building by the Cleveland Cavaliers and LeBron James. Cleveland won all four games of the series by double digits. Williams struggled mightily in the series averaging just 3.1 PPG on 21.4% from the field. He missed significant time throughout the entire playoffs due to a sprained right wrist which led to some of his shooting struggles.\n\nAfter the season, the Hawks went all in and fully committed to their team. The team re-signed free agents Mike Bibby and Zaza Pachulia. They also traded for guard Jamal Crawford and drafted point guard Jeff Teague in the first round of the 2009 NBA Draft. Atlanta made a full commitment to Williams with a five-year, $37.5 million rookie extension.\n\nThe nucleus of the Hawks continued to trend upward for the 2009-10 season. They were the third best team in the Eastern Conference with a 53-29 record on the strength of the second most efficient offense in the NBA. Williams started all 81 games he played in at small forward and took a step back with 10.1 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 1.1 APG and 0.8 SPG in 30.5 MPG.\n\nIn the postseason, the Hawks dueled with the 46-win Milwaukee Bucks. After the first four games, the series was split even 2-2. The Bucks managed to steal Game Five on the road to take a 3-2 series lead. Facing elimination, the Hawks held the Bucks to 69 points on 32.9% from the field in a one-point victory. Atlanta would pull away in Game Seven to win the series and advance to the second round.\n\nThe Semifinals would be a rough experience for the Hawks. They were swept in four very easy games by the second-seeded Orlando Magic. They lost the four games by an average of 25.3 PPG which set a record for the most lopsided defeat in a four-game sweep. Williams contributed heavily to Atlanta’s struggles in the series. He shot just 30% from the field and averaged just 6.3 PPG in 32.0 MPG.\n\nAfter the bitter and disappointing finish to one of the better regular seasons in Hawks history, the Hawks decided to can head coach Mike Woodson. They replaced him with assistant Larry Drew on a three-year, $5 million deal. Atlanta also agreed to keep their star in Joe Johnson on a six-year, $119 million contract. The Hawks went through a rollercoaster ride of a 2010-11 season. They won their first six games of the season, but struggled with multiple winning and losing streaks. They were 33-18 at one point, but lost 20 of their next 31 games to finish 44-38. Williams continued to disappoint with 10.4 PPG, 4.8 RPG and 1.4 APG in 65 games (52 starts).\n\nAtlanta had a return match against the Magic in the first round of the 2011 playoffs. Atlanta changed up their starting lineup by removing Williams from the starting lineup and adding Jason Collins to the starting five. Collins’ addition moved Horford to power forward and Josh Smith to small forward and gave him sole responsibility with guarding Magic center Dwight Howard.\n\nThe move worked as Atlanta sealed off any significant contributions from orlando’s supporting cast. Howard went for 46 points and 19 rebounds, but the Hawks kept the rest of Orlando combined for 47 points as the Hawks won Game One. Orlando won Game Two at home to tie up the series. The Hawks narrowly won Games Three and Four at home to take a 3-1 series lead. After an Orlando 101-76 rout in Game Five, the Hawks were victorious by three points in Game Six to win the series 4-2.\n\nDuring the last game of the Hawks-Magic series, Hawks starting point guard Kirk Hinrich suffered a strained hamstring. Atlanta moved second year guard Jeff Teague into the starting lineup for a second round matchup against the Chicago Bulls. Williams also assumed his original role as starting small forward for the Semifinals.\n\nThe Hawks managed to steal the series opener on the road against the Bulls. They lost games Two and Three before winning the fourth game to tie the series. Games Five and Six went to the Bulls leading to a 4-2 series win. Williams only started the first three games of the series before the Hawks went back to their jumbo lineup featuring Collins.\n\nThe Hawks moved Teague into the starting lineup for the 2011-12 lockout-shortened season. After a 7-4 start, the Hawks lost Horford for nearly the entire season to a torn left pectoral muscle. Despite the absence of Horford, the Hawks were a top team in the East with a 40-26 record. Williams played in 57 games (37 starts) and managed 10.2 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 1.2 APG and 0.8 SPG in 26.3 MPG. In an encouraging sign, Williams made 58-of-149 three-pointers (38.9%).\n\nAtlanta faced the Boston Celtics in the first round of the 2012 playoffs. The Hawks won Game One, but lost the next three games. Horford surprisingly returned from his injury in the Hawks’ Game Four loss. They won Game Five at home before losing Game Six and the series 4-2. After the season, the Hawks began to reshape the team under president of basketball operations Danny Ferry. Williams was traded along with Joe Johnson in separate deals. The Hawks also acquired forward Kyle Korver from the Chicago Bulls and signed guard Lou Williams from the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nMarvin Williams could never escape the comparisons to Chris Paul, Deron Williams or Andrew Bynum. All three players were drafted after Williams, and developed into better players. On top of that, all three players filled a need that Atlanta desired for.\n\nWhen the Hawks lost 69 games during the 2004-05 season, the Hawks were loaded with young talent on the wing. Veteran Al Harrington was flanked by Josh Smith and Josh Childress and after adding Marvin Williams in the draft, the team signed-and-traded for swingman Joe Johnson. The only point guards on Atlanta’s roster at the time of Williams’ selection were Tyronn Lue, Royal Ivey and Tony Delk. Williams was an average player and losing out on adding a transformative player of Paul’s caliber had to sting for the Hawks franchise.\n\nWilliams found out about the trade while he was playing in a pickup game in Chapel Hill, N.C. A friend told him he had been traded. He went home and saw the news on ESPN’s “SportsCenter.” (via Salt Lake Tribune)\n\nWilliams departed Atlanta with averages of 11.5 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 1.3 APG and 0.8 SPG in 487 games (379 starts) with Atlanta. He shot 45% from the field and 81% from the free-throw line in that time.\n\nDevin Harris was originally acquired by the Utah Jazz along with Derrick Favors and a future draft pick for All-Star point guard Deron Williams. Harris joined a Jazz team in the midst of a full-scale collapse and rebuild. The team was 27-13 early on, but struggled to win games later on in the season. Long time coach Jerry Sloan had an altercation with Williams and eventually resigned and retired, leaving the job to assistant coach Tyrone Corbin.\n\nThe team floundered after all of these moves, and finished 39-43 and out of the postseason. It was the worst season for the Jazz since a 26-56 record during the 2004-05 season. Harris finished out the year with the Jazz and averaged 15.8 PPG, 2.4 RPG, 5.8 APG and 0.8 SPG in 17 games.\n\nThe Jazz ended up in the 2011 NBA Draft with two lottery picks (3 and 12). They selected big man Enes Kanter with the third selection and scooped up guard Alec Burks with their latter lottery selection. The Jazz hovered around .500 for much of the truncated 2011-12 season. They finished with a 36-30 record behind the two-pronged attack of Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap. Harris played in 63 games and contributed 11.3 PPG, 1.8 RPG, 5.0 APG and 1.0 SPG in 27.6 MPG. The Jazz earned a berth as the eight seed facing the number one-seeded San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs made quick work of the Jazz by sweeping them in four games with relative ease.\n\nHarris departed Utah with numbers of 12.3 PPG, 1.9 RPG, 5.1 APG and 1.0 SPG in 80 games. He shot 44% on FGs, 36% on trifectas, and 77% on FTs in that time.\n\nAfter the trade, Marvin Williams was in and out of the starting lineup in his first season with the Jazz. Utah was 31-24 and seventh in the Western Conference, but they lost 12 of 15 games. They did win 9 of their last 12 games, but failed to qualify for the postseason by just two games. The Jazz finished with a 43-39 record. Williams participated in 73 games (51 starts) and averaged 7.2 PG, 3.6 RPG and 1.1 APG in 23.7 MPG.\n\nThe Jazz lost their two most productive players in Paul Millsap and Al Jefferson to 2013 free agency. The growth and development of frontcourt players Enes Kanter and Derrick Favors motivated Utah to basically start over. And start over they did. The Jazz were the worst team in the NBA during the first month with a 1-14 record. The team’s play would improve slightly and they finished with a 25-57 record.\n\nWilliams played almost exclusively at power forward after spending much of the previous season at the small forward. He played in 66 games (50 starts) and contributed 9.1 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 1.2 APG and 0.8 SPG in 25.4 MPG. After the season, Williams opted to sign a two-year, $14 million deal with the Charlotte Hornets. He departed Utah with averages of 8.1 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 1.1 APG and 0.7 SPG in 139 games (101 starts). He shot 43% from the field, 34% on treys, and 78% from the charity stripe.\n\nFoot and ankle issues limited Harris to just 58 games (34 starts). He produced 9.9 PPG, 2.0 RPG, 3.4 APG and 1.1 SPG in 24.5 MPG in the role of combo guard. The Hawks were a solid NBA team throughout the course of the 2012-13 season with a 44-38 record. Atlanta earned a berth as the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference and challenged the Indiana Pacers in the first round. The Pacers and Hawks were even after four games, before the Pacers took Games Five and Six to win the series 4-2.\n\nAfter the season, Harris chose to sign a contract with the Dallas Mavericks. The deal was originally for three years and more than $9 million, but he failed a physical leading to a one-year deal with the Mavericks at a lower figure of about $1.27 million.\n\nDevin Harris on playing with Jeff Teague (via The Atlanta Journal-Constitution):\n\n“I played with [6-2] Jason Terry in Dallas with a small backcourt. We played a similar type way, getting up and down the floor. I think it can work out the same way [with Teague]. Obviously he’s one of the few remaining guys on the team that knows the system and knows it well. I think if we play together, it can be a good tandem.”\n\nOn sharing the ball with Teague:\n\n“Whoever gets it pretty much goes and runs the break and the other guy sprints. If it was halfcourt sets, usually I brought the ball up. He’s the better shooter of us two.”\n\nMarvin Williams on joining the Utah Jazz (via Salt Lake Tribune):\n\n“I’m excited. It’s a chance for me to come in and help the organization on and off the court. I can’t wait to get started.”\n\nOn the new experience:\n\n“It’ll be different. Obviously, this is my first time being traded. Hopefully, I can get adjusted quickly by the end of the summer. I’m just excited to be a part of this team. These guys play hard. Every time you went up against the Jazz, you knew what kind of game you were in for.”\n\nOn being excited (via KSL):\n\n“I’m excited. I’m definitely excited. I’ve been in Atlanta the last seven years and that’s all I’ve ever known. A new opportunity to play with new guys, a new coach, live in a new city, it’s all going to be something new for me so it’s definitely an exciting time for sure.“\n\nOn being happy to be in Utah (via Deseret News):\n\n“I’m happy to be here, I haven’t spent a ton of time here. I’m definitely excited to get out in the city and meet new people. Obviously this is my first time being traded in my career and I don’t really know what to expect. I’ll get a chance to meet a lot of people tomorrow and I’m really excited about that. Hopefully a little bit later on in the summer I’ll be able to get out here, get adjusted, and find a new place to live — kind of get my feet set.”\n\nOn Gordon Hayward:\n\n“The one thing about Gordon is he does have the ability to play both (shooting guard and small forward) positions. That definitely helps us. I’m sure (the) coaches have a plan for the team and a plan for me. Once I sit down and talk to the coaches a little bit more I’m sure they’ll be able to fill me in and tell me what they see.”\n\nRemembering a triple-overtime game he played against the Jazz as a member of the Hawks:\n\n“The one thing that kind of stands out to me about (Utah) is that quadruple-overtime game we had in Atlanta last year. It just seemed like Utah would never go away. They played so hard the whole time. Any time you can surround yourself with players like that you give yourself a chance to win.”\n\nOn his knowledge of Utah and whether he feels pressure (via Salt Lake Tribune):\n\n“I knew it was cold. I knew these guys win games. I did know that. Even from when before I was in the NBA, they’ve had a great history of winning. When I was traded here I was very excited about being a part of something like this. I don’t feel any more pressure than I did in Atlanta. My job is to get better, man, and the day I stop getting better is the day I have a problem.”\n\nOn facing expectations from his draft position:\n\n“People talk a lot about expectations and living up to expectations, but I hit them up with the million dollar question every time. My question is: Whose expectations do I have to live up to?”\n\nAtlanta Hawks president of basketball operations and general manager Danny Ferry on the trade of Williams as well as Joe Johnson (via Hawks.com):\n\n“The Hawks want to thank Joe Johnson and Marvin Williams for their contributions on the court and in the community. We felt with the team that we had, we were probably going to maintain the status quo and not be able to reach a championship level. We now have the opportunity to work within the new CBA in a better way that will allow us to move forward and be opportunistic in the future as we work to build a sustainable championship level team.”\n\nOn trying to refresh the team (via The Atlanta Journal-Constitution):\n\n“We believed the status quo probably wasn’t good enough and it wasn’t sustainable. We would be good, but not good enough. Through these trades hopefully we put ourselves in a position of strength going into the new [labor agreement].”\n\nThe style that he sees the Hawks playing:\n\n“We’ll play differently. We will play through our our point guards and attacking guards more. And plus we will play a little more up-tempo.”\n\nUtah Jazz CEO Greg Miller on the trade (via Deseret News):\n\n“It’s always unfortunate when we have to let a player go because all of our players work so hard and they’re so invested in helping us win. And it’s got to be a tough thing for them. I know it is for us. I wish Devin the best in his career.”\n\nJazz head coach Tyrone Corbin on Marvin Williams (via Salt Lake Tribune):\n\n“He can have the ball in his hands some. He can make shots coming off down screens, he can defend guys both big and small. He’s rangy. So, we’re looking forward to getting him in a lot of different situations.”\n\nJazz center Al Jefferson on how the motion offense will benefit Williams (via Salt Lake Tribune):\n\n“A guy like Marvin can take advantage of it, because most [small forwards] can’t defend him on the block and he can step out and put the ball on the floor and can shoot it.”\n\nHawks guard Jeff Teague on the change in team style (via The Atlanta Journal-Constitution):\n\n“Our team is a lot smaller now, but a lot faster. We are going to have to get up and down the floor a lot more.”"
