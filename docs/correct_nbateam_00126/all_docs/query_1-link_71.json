        "text": "By Ronald Tillery of The Commercial Appeal\n\nThe Grizzlies' Vince Carter can always been seen motivating and coaching teammates from the bench and on the court.\n\nHe always has the ear of his colleagues, and NBA players recognized Carter for his unwavering support Wednesday by voting him as the recipient of the 2015-16 Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award.\n\nThe honor recognizes the player deemed the best teammate based on selfless play, on- and off-court leadership as a mentor and role model to other NBA players, and commitment and dedication to team.\n\nMore than 300 NBA players submitted their votes through confidential balloting conducted by the league office. The 12 nominees were chosen by a panel of NBA legends as well as executives from the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association.\n\nCarter totaled 1,448 points from the players, including 65 first-place votes. The Minnesota Timberwolves’ Kevin Garnett finished second with 916 points (39 first-place votes), and the Miami Heat’s Chris Bosh placed third with 799 points (18 first-place votes).\n\nTen points were awarded for a first-place vote, seven for a second-place vote, five for a third, three for a fourth and one for a fifth.\n\nAn eight-time NBA All-Star and two-time All-NBA Team selection, Carter has spent the last two seasons of his 18-year career with Memphis. Carter ranks 24th on the NBA’s career scoring list (23,969 points) and sixth in three-pointers made (1,937). He finished second to the San Antonio Spurs’ Tim Duncan in last year’s voting for the Twyman-Stokes honor.\n\nCarter will be presented with the Twyman-Stokes trophy by 2013-14 Teammate of the Year winner Shane Battier Wednesday night during an on-court ceremony before Game 3 of The Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors in Cleveland.\n\nAs part of its support for the Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award, the NBA will make a $25,000 donation to Carter’s Embassy of Hope Foundation, which assists organizations and individuals in improving the quality of life for children.\n\nAlong with Carter, Garnett and Bosh, the other finalists for the 2015-16 teammate award were Ryan Anderson (New Orleans Pelicans), Caron Butler (Sacramento Kings), Jose Calderon (New York Knicks), Andre Drummond (Detroit Pistons), Festus Ezeli (Golden State), James Jones (Cleveland), Andre Miller (San Antonio), Luis Scola (Toronto Raptors) and Marvin Williams (Atlanta Hawks).\n\nJack Twyman and Maurice Stokes, whose storied friendship transcended their Hall of Fame accomplishments, are honored with an annual NBA award in their names that recognizes the ideal teammate. Twyman and Stokes were teammates on the Rochester/Cincinnati Royals from 1955-58. In the last game of the 1957-58 regular season, Stokes suffered an injury that led to his falling into a coma days later and becoming permanently paralyzed. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic encephalopathy, a brain injury that damaged his motor-control center. Stokes was supported for the rest of his life by Twyman, who became his legal guardian and advocate."
