        "text": "Let’s highlight Williams (Player A, in this case) first. What Williams lacked in explosiveness (at least in comparison to Barnes), he made up for in wingspan. That, if you remember, was one of the key superlatives for Williams coming out of college — his sheer size and physical strength shot him up draft boards, with executives drooling over the chance to unlock his seemingly unlimited potential. In particular, his versatility in playing either forward position served as a major source of intrigue for teams that envisioned Williams eventually becoming a legitimate two-way star.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks drafted Williams in the No. 2 spot despite Williams having coming off the bench for most of his lone season in Chapel Hill (and how desperately the Hawks needed a point guard in a draft that contained both Chris Paul and Deron Williams.) A few years later, it was the Warriors who would employ a similar rational in drafting Barnes at No. 7 overall.\n\nFor his part, Barnes enjoyed similar praise for his tantalizing combination of size and two-way versatility. Heralded as a strong shooter with good form who lacked the ability to consistently create his own shot, Barnes’ athleticism, strength, and mobility all seemed key to a bright future. But after a somewhat mediocre sophomore season, Barnes suddenly wasn’t seen as the slam-dunk lottery pick he once was.\n\nRoles\n\nFor better or worse, players continue to develop, and thus aren’t bolted to pre-draft analyst projections. The biggest reason, of course, has to do with team fit, and how environment can oftentimes dictate how effective a particular player can become. On this front, Barnes and Williams have experienced two, very different paths to veteranship.\n\nWhen Barnes was taken by the Warriors in 2012, expectations were decidedly tempered. Coach Mark Jackson loved Barnes’ defensive versatility, seeing him as someone with the potential to eventually guard all five positions. With Steph Curry and Klay Thompson already on the roster, Barnes wasn’t expected to carry a very heavy offensive burden. During the 2013 playoffs, however, the wiry forward displayed some resemblance to the star he could become, averaging 16.1 points and 6.4 rebounds over 12 games.\n\nThe performance gave the Warriors ample reason to expect even more from their fresh-faced phenom. Instead, the team then acquired Andre Iguodala, who immediately supplanted Barnes at the small forward position in the starting lineup. By the next trade deadline, the Warriors suddenly were shopping Barnes around, a tactic that continued the following summer when Golden State was exploring trading for disgruntled star Kevin Love.\n\nInstead, Steve Kerr was hired to replace Jackson and Draymond Green soon became the forward fixture the team needed. Kerr shoe-horned Barnes into the starting lineup over Iguodala, where the former became a rock-steady drive-and-kick option for Green, Curry, and Thompson. The resulting system resulted in more looks from the corners for Barnes, who was able to get his overall 3-point percentage up to over 40 percent.\n\nBarnes’ greatest strength to date may be his ability to play as a small-ball power forward. His positional versatility has been a key cog in the Warriors’ near-unsolvable rotational puzzle, predicated on quick switches on defense and a pass-happy offense that forces the defense to stretch and scramble with every zip of the ball.\n\nIn short, Barnes fell into a near-perfect situation. Maybe not for becoming the superstar many had envisioned, but one that showed him to be an uber-valuable piece on a championship team. Looking back, it’s worth wondering whether, in some not-so-alternate universe, Williams might’ve enjoyed that same fate.\n\nWhen Williams was drafted in 2005, he was joining a team coming off a disastrous 13-win season. With a roster containing raw talent like Josh Childress and Josh Smith, the pressure for Williams to reach his ultimate potential only was more pronounced. Later that summer, however, the Hawks would make the trade that vaulted them into the conversation as a genuine up-and-comer, plying Joe Johnson from the Phoenix Suns.\n\nStill, the Hawks would win just 26 games in 2005–06. Williams played fine, by all accounts, but his role seemed too loosely defined. As sweet a stroke as he had, and as athletically gifted as he was, the 6-foot-8 forward habitually settled for long twos. Soon, head coach Mike Woodson was imploring both him and Smith to get to the basket.\n\nThis led to Williams hoisting a mere 10 threes in his third season in the league, although Williams authored career highs in points, field goals attempted, and effective field-goal-percentage. More encouraging still, the Hawks made the playoffs for the first time since 1999, beginning a streak of eight consecutive years in the postseason.\n\nWoodson subsequently encouraged Williams — now a full-time small forward playing alongside Al Horford and Smith in the frontocurt — to stretch his game to the corners. This ultimately led to Williams’ best season as a pro, highlighted by career highs in true shooting percentage, Win Shares, PER, and VORP.\n\nStill, Williams would soon be scaled back in the offense in favor of the more efficient Horford (along with Jamal Crawford, who wound up taking the second-most shots on the team despite coming off the bench). The diminished role continued as Williams saw his minutes lower all the way to 26.3 during the 2011–12 season, his last in Atlanta. He was traded to the Utah Jazz the following offseason.\n\nBut with Al Jefferson, Paul Millsap, Derrick Favors, and Enes Kanter all vying for heavy minutes in the frontcourt, Williams tallied the worst year of his career, hitting a career-low 42 percent of his attempts while playing only 23.7 minutes per game. However, a bounceback 2013–14 season — typified by his increased minutes at power forward — eventually earned him a fresh, two-year deal with the relatively front-court-thin Charlotte Hornets.\n\nA decade after his NBA debut, Williams seems to have found a perfect niche in Charlotte, where his stretch-four versatility — on both ends of the floor — has become invaluable. To date, Williams has charted the second highest net rating on the Hornets this season. All while playing the third-most minutes and shooting 38 percent on a career-high 4.3 3-point attempts per game.\n\nSo how do the two compare overall statistically?\n\nStats\n\nWilliams has taken 675 shots over the past three seasons. Of those, only 161 have been corner threes. By contrast, Barnes has taken 480 three-point shots, of which 281 of them have been from the corner. Simply put, Barnes takes more than half of his threes from the corner, while Williams registers at a little under 25 percent. Considering that zone on the floor is hit at a far higher rate than any other trey, it seems like Barnes’ superiority can be chalked up, more than anything, to the once-in-a-generation talent surrounding him.\n\nDemeanor\n\nGranted, this kind of evaluation is more ancillary than necessary. Still, after looking back at draft profiles and quotes on the pair’s respective intangibles, there was enough of an overlap to make including the analysis worthwhile.\n\nA full scouting report on Williams from DraftExpress:\n\n… All of the above are impressive enough, but the most impressive part about Marvin Williams, and we can’t stress this enough, are his intangibles. Ask any of his current or former coaches and they will all tell you Marvin has an incredible attitude, motor, work ethic, and understanding of basketball. His basketball IQ is extremely high (he grew up watching Dean Smith instructional videos). He understands what to do and where to go at all times, and is extremely unselfish. Marvin plays with a passion and desire that is hard to find these days and is very driven but not consumed by basketball. For a player his age, he has shown that he is very mature.\n\nAl Jefferson on Williams’ impact on his game when he joined the Hornets:\n\n“He’s one of the smartest players I’ve ever been around. He knows how to adjust his game to make the team better. I’m going to make his life easy, and he’s sure going to make mine easy” by spreading the floor.”\n\nSteve Clifford talked about what kind of impact Williams would have on the team:\n\n“Marvin is a proven veteran player with high character and high IQ. You watch him play at both ends of the floor and everything he does makes sense. I think he will bring versatility.”\n\nJonathan Givony gave Barnes some strong praise in a draft preview he wrote up on him in 2011.\n\n“Something that constantly needs to be mentioned when evaluating Barnes’ potential at the NBA level are the intangibles he brings. Despite being just 18 years old, Barnes already plays with a tremendous amount of savvy, something that leaves great optimism regarding his future. He’s a team player who displays an ideal temperament out on the floor, never getting too high or low in any given moment, and always playing with great self-confidence.\n\nAnyone that has been around him states emphatically that his character is of the highest standard, and whoever drafts him can be fairly certain that he will represent them extremely well on and off the court. Despite the shortcomings mentioned, there is very little doubt that he will continue to work diligently on improving the weaker points of his game once he reaches the NBA. Considering his age, it’s not a stretch to say that he still has plenty of room to grow as a player.”\n\nGreg McDermott spoke of how impactful Barnes was on the development of his son, Doug.\n\n“Harrison’s responsible for a lot of Doug’s development. When other high school-aged students were going to movies and going to football games and going to the prom, Harrison was working out. And I really believe that Doug saw in Harrison a guy that he wanted to emulate and saw the improvement and said, ‘You know what? I think that I now know what it takes.’ He could listen to his dad and his high school coach, but when you see it in Harrison, the improvement he made each year of high school because of his work ethic, it was certainly impactful for Doug.”\n\nI mean, when you can diplomatically answer a question raised by a legend of your franchise about one of your fellow teammates, you deserve props."
