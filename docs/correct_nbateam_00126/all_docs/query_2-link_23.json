        "text": "Five years later, Kaminsky would like to take that advice and pay it forward the rest of his career. “That’s something that I would love to be one day, a veteran presence that people can look up to,” Kaminsky said. “He really set the example for everybody, not just on the court. Off the court, you cannot speak more highly just how good he was to everybody in the organization, from training staff to the support staff to the video guys, just to everybody, how he includes everybody and makes them feel comfortable and part of something. That’s something I want to be one day.”"
