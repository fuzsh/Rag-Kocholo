        "text": "After 15 seasons in the NBA, former UNC forward Marvin Williams announced Tuesday that he is calling it a career after his Milwaukee Bucks were eliminated from the postseason by the Miami Heat.\n\nWilliams–who played a key role off the bench for UNC’s 2005 national championship team–was the first one-and-done player in Tar Heel history. His crucial and-one play to help beat Duke at the Smith Center that season remains an iconic moment for the program.\n\nHe went on to become the No. 2 overall pick of the 2005 NBA Draft by the Atlanta Hawks, where he played until a move to the Utah Jazz in 2012.\n\nFollowing two seasons with the Jazz, Williams returned to North Carolina to play for owner Michael Jordan and the Charlotte Hornets–spending five and a half seasons with the team before joining the Bucks midway through the 2019-20 campaign.\n\nFor his career, Williams averaged 10.2 points and 5.2 rebounds per game.\n\nAlso notable is that Williams returned to UNC each summer for 10 years after going to the NBA until he finished his degree in 2014.\n\nPhoto via Associated Press\n\nChapelboro.com does not charge subscription fees.
