        "text": "Raymond Felton's return to form was the big story in the Trail Blazers' 97-77 win over the Atlanta Hawks. Nicolas Batum's continued aggressive play also got plenty of time in the spotlight.\n\nBut lest we forget, there was a guy named LaMarcus Aldridge back in the lineup after missing most of the past three games with a sprained left ankle.\n\nAll Aldridge did in his return -- which remained a game-time decision most of the day Saturday -- was to get 19 points, 10 rebounds and four assists.\n\n\"It felt good,\" Aldridge said. \"A little bit sore in the beginning, but I felt good.\"\n\nAldridge wasn't even the Blazers' leading scorer -- that distinction went to Batum, who had 22 points. But having the All-Star power forward back in the lineup opened things up for other players, a significant factor after so much of Portland's offense was perimeter-oriented the last two games.\n\n\"We needed somebody in the paint, and you can see the difference tonight,\" Batum said. \"We have somebody in the paint who can score inside. That's huge.\"\n\nAldridge faced one-on-one defense from the Hawks early and proceeded to make his first four shots. He cooled off significantly, shooting 4 for 15 the rest of the way, but just having him in the lineup seemed to energized the team.\n\n\"I started kind of hot and then kind of fizzed out, but definitely, I felt good out there,\" Aldridge said.\n\nOther tidbits, notes and links from Saturday's game.\n\n• A little\n\nand he leads the Blazers to victory, The Oregonian's Joe Freeman reports.\n\n• When Felton showed up at the Rose Garden for Saturday's game, he found a hand-made sign in his locker. Signed by \"Kevin,\" the sign read:\n\n\"Go Raymond. Make a 3 pointer.\"\n\nFelton said a kid left it for him, and that he intends to keep it up. It was part of a happier locker room Saturday. At one point, as Felton spoke to reporters, a long arm joined into the group of reporters' arms that were holding microphones and cameras. The hand held a bottle of Gatorade, mimicking the media's pose.\n\nIt belonged to Gerald Wallace, who has the locker next to Felton.\n\nFelton got a little cryptic while speaking about his recent struggles.\n\n\"It's just one of those things where every NBA player goes through that, I don't care who it is, from Kobe down to anybody else,\" he said. \"They have bad stuff that goes on outside the court. A lot of people don't realize that we have a life other than basketball. You have issues and you have to deal with it. Sometimes, it follows over into basketball. It's your job, and you try to not let it do that, sometimes you can't help it.\n\n\"I'm not saying that's the case, but that's what happens sometimes.\"\n\n• The Blazers recent struggles have brought some discontent with McMillan, but\n\n, the O's Jason Quick writes.\n\n• Batum tied his season high by getting four offensive rebounds, part of the Blazers' dominant effort on the boards in which they outrebounded Atlanta 50-27.\n\nTwo of Batum's offensive rebounds led to putback baskets in the first quarter. Batum said he recognizes that, at 6-foot-8 and now starting at shooting guard, offensive rebounding is a way for him to make an even bigger impact on offense.\n\n\"I can get some extra points or try to get some extra possessions for my team,\" he said.\n\nOne reason Batum felt comfortable going to the glass Saturday was that coach Nate McMillan had him and Gerald Wallace cross-match positions defensively, with Wallace guarding Hawks guard Joe Johnson, leaving Batum on small forward Marvin Williams. Batum said he is less apt to go all out after offensive rebounds if he has to check a shooting guard or point guard because he feels doing so would leave him out of position to get back on defense.\n\n\"Normally when I have the guard or the point guard, I can't go every time\" to the offensive glass, he said. \"I try sometimes.\"\n\n• During the Hawks' morning shootaround, I caught up with Hawks forward Ivan Johnson, who has turned the inner fire that once got him kicked out of Oregon's program into a physical style that\n\n.\n\n• McMillan granted his rookie point guard, Nolan Smith, some prime-time playing time to spell Felton. Smith responded with five points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal in 15 minutes. Smith also made a three-pointer, the third of his NBA career and first since Jan. 18.\n\n\"I thought Nolan did a really nice job in his minutes off the bench,\" McMillan said.\n\nAdded Felton: \"I was happy to see him get out there tonight and play the way he played.\"\n\n• While Felton and Smith were having their moments, Atlanta's point guards were awful. Starter Jeff Teague shot 1 for 10 from the field, and backup Kirk Hinrich was 0 for 4.\n\n--"
