        "text": "My time at Ipswich Town will be coming to an end. Firstly, I‚Äôm incredibly proud to have been given such an amazing opportunity at a MASSIVE club - I will be forever grateful. Whilst in post I have been exposed to some great working practices and learnt so much; I will take away things that will stay with me forever. It‚Äôs clear the club are on a hugely exciting journey & I wish them and the Academy nothing but success along the way. I now look forward and begin seeking new opportunities. Let‚Äôs see what the next chapter holds‚Ä¶.\n\nI have today left Sutton United after a decade at the Club. I can‚Äôt say thanks enough to all staff who‚Äôve contributed to the Academy since 2015 - in particular Ricky Wellard & Mark Buetow who both shared my vision and help me to make it happen. A special mention to Paul Doswell (Dos) for backing me when I asked to start the Academy all those years ago. What a journey it‚Äôs been. ‚úåüèø\n\nWhat a day‚Ä¶ so many emotions, but the greatest satisfaction was seeing so many families filled with pride watching their loved ones signing. What a journey we‚Äôre about to embark on‚Ä¶. Congratulations again to All on signingüü§üü°"
