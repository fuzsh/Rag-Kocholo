        "text": "Bremerton native Marvin Williams showed improvement in his second NBA season.\n\nBy Nathan Joyce of the Kitsap Sun\n\nThe Marvin Williams the Atlanta Hawks saw at the end of the 2006-07 season was the player they had in mind when they made the Bremerton native the second pick in the 2005 NBA draft.\n\nWilliams topped the 20-point mark in five of Atlanta's last six games. It topped a season in which he showed marked improvement over his rookie campaign.\n\n\"Personally, I think my second year went pretty well,\" the 6-foot-9 small forward said. \"I just felt like I played better than last season, and that was my goal.\"\n\nWilliams minutes increased nearly 10 per game and his points per game output increased from 8.5 to 13.1.\n\nNot bad for somebody who doesn't turn 21 until June.\n\nAnd while Williams, who was a McDonald's All-American at Bremerton High and an NCAA champion at North Carolina, improved this season and posted some respectable numbers, it's still not enough to quiet some critics. Being the No. 2 pick brings a lot of expectations.\n\n\"Marv still has peach fuzz on his chin,\" veteran Hawks guard Anthony Johnson told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"Seriously, though, he's an athletic, 6-9 guy with a fantastic shooting stroke, a good understanding of the game, and he's open to coaching. I don't know, what else could want from a young player?\n\n\"The bottom line is this: People assume these young guys are going to come into the league and be saviors just because they get drafted in the top five or whatever. But that's not reality. They're coming into a league full of grown men. And as cliche as it might sound, it's a process.\"\n\nWilliams was ready to answer these expectations early this season. He worked hard in the offseason, bulked up and was named MVP of the Rocky Mountain Revue summer league. Williams was looking for a big start to the season, but a broken finger on his non-shooting hand put him on the shelf for the first 17 games. It took an extra month to play his way into shape and get his timing back.\n\n\"That set me back mentally more than anything because I was so set on coming in and doing what I wanted to do,\" Williams told the AJC. \"Then you sit out for six or seven weeks and it's tough to get it back.\"\n\nWilliams, who played just one season at Carolina, insists he no longer feels the pressure of that No. 2 pick.\n\n\"That was last year,\" he said, pointing out there's been a whole other draft since then. \"I knew when they drafted me they weren't drafting me for the player I was but the players I was going to be.\"\n\nAnd that's exactly what Atlanta coach Mike Woodson says.\n\n\"His body still has to develop,\" Woodson told the AJC. \"He has to get stronger. His base is so flimsy right now, that when he gets bumped he's easily knocked off balance. So he has to use the summer to really work again like he did last summer to put himself into a position to fulfill his potential.\"\n\nAnd that's exactly what Williams has in mind.\n\nHe's planning to spend some time in Atlanta with friends before returning to Bremerton for a few weeks. He'll be playing some basketball with his brother J'Tonn, who played on Bremerton's junior varsity last year as a sophomore.\n\n\"I have big plans for him this summer to get him ready to play,\" Williams said.\n\nThen he's off to Chapel Hill, N.C., where he plans to strengthen both his body and mind.\n\nWilliams hopes to complete two sessions of summer school classes. He hopes to be finished with his sophomore year by the end of summer.\n\nAnd he'll be taking advantage of the facilities at North Carolina to work out and play in some of the best pickup games around. Carolina's alumni often return in the NBA offseason to play basketball.\n\n\"Carolina's my home base,\" Williams said.\n\nAnd in the meantime he'll be watching the NBA playoffs — and mourning the fact that he's not playing in them again. Atlanta hasn't been in the playoffs in eight years, which is the longest streak in the NBA now that Golden State made this season.\n\n\"Hopefully next year we'll be in the playoffs,\" Williams said. \"Personally, it's going to be tough for me to watch other teams compete for the championship.\""
