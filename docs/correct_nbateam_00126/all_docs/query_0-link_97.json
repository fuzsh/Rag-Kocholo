        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nATLANTA — Atlanta Hawks forward Marvin Williams has decided not to have surgery on his ailing back, opting for a more conservative treatment program.\n\nWilliams is back in Atlanta after meeting with a specialist in Durham, N.C. The fourth-year player, averaging 14.0 points and 6.4 rebounds, has missed two straight games with lower back pain.\n\nThe Hawks said Thursday that Williams is out indefinitely but will try to resolve his problem with rest and treatment. Atlanta is undefeated without Williams in the lineup, winning all five games he’s missed this season."
