        "text": "Two out of two lottery picks agree. Andrew Bogut should go ahead of Marvin Williams in the NBA draft as the first overall choice of Milwaukee tonight.\n\nJust ask Bogut.\n\n\"I think I know I'm the better pick. If they want potential in three or four years, you probably go with Marvin Williams. If they want someone to help them to the playoffs immediately, I think I'm the guy.\"\n\nTo which Williams responded: \"You tell me why I should be the No. 1 pick. I never said I should be.\"\n\nIt's as if Bogut skipped his basketball career at Utah and went straight to the sports radio commentary job, while Williams just arrived from a 1950s charm school. The Bucks have to decide which personality, and which game, they will bank their future on.\n\nThe choice is stark.\n\nPolished centers such as Bogut come along as often as eclipses, but the NBA consensus is that Williams, a forward who turned 19 Sunday, could be more spectacular in the long run. A key figure on North Carolina's NCAA championship team, Williams never started a college game but did enough in spot duty to have NBA general managers salivating.\n\n\"If he played anywhere else in the country he would have started,\" Bucks GM Larry Harris said at predraft workouts. \"The thing with Andrew is if he'd have played on the East Coast I think people would have known more about him. You reverse roles -- you put Marvin in Utah and he starts and has a big year and North Carolina wins a title with Bogut.\"\n\nA frank approach\n\nBogut's story is unique, like his point of view. A native Australian born to Croatian immigrants, he ascended from being a kid who struggled making a regional youth team to becoming the consensus national college player of the year at Utah as a sophomore this past season.\n\nBecause his two coaches at Utah, Rick Majerus and Ray Giacoletti, used him so differently, he has displayed a diverse and polished game for a 20-year old. Bogut said Majerus asked him to work the perimeter and slash to the basket, while Giacoletti parked him down low.\n\nDespite his star player's 20.4-point, 12.2-rebound averages, Giacoletti guessed that Bogut could have been even more dominant with better perimeter help.\n\n\"You have only so many opportunities at the college level, less in the NBA, to get a true low-post player that can play 13 or 14 years in the NBA,\" the coach said. \"Andrew is that.\"\n\nAsked to point out a comparable player, Bogut said he sees himself as a young Arvydas Sabonis.\n\nWhen it was mentioned he might play like Vlade Divac, he replied, \"There's no chance I'm as slow as Vlade Divac.\"\n\nDuring the draft build-up, Bogut answered a question on how he will overcome the stereotype of the \"white stiff\" by calling other former top picks, such as Kwame Brown and Michael Olowokandi, \"black stiffs\" in an interview with draftexpress.com. He even criticized the Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant and didn't back down once the quote circulated around the league.\n\n\"I still think he's one of the best players in the NBA,\" Bogut said. \"But his attitude needs to change. I've got nothing against him. I'm going to say what I feel. It may get me in trouble sometimes, but that's the way it is. I'm not going to lie.\"\n\nThough clearly annoyed by statements from Majerus that he might have a degenerative eye condition, Bogut also said he maintains a \"fine\" albeit distant relationship with his old coach.\n\nBogut said his sister has an eye condition and he wears contact lenses, but he suggested that the Atlanta Hawks would love to hear more rumors in order to get him at No. 2.\n\n\"They're rolling around on the floor laughing about it because they'd be getting me there at No. 2,\" he said.\n\nBogut may find himself with a few angry veterans to deal with in his first spin around the league, but Giacoletti said he admires Bogut's frankness.\n\n\"He's not trying to be disrespectful with anybody, but he's usually on the numbers with an old-school point of view,\" the coach said.\n\nEnormous potential\n\nAnd then there's Williams, who didn't criticize anyone at the predraft camp, unless it was himself.\n\n\"I'm boring,\" he observed. \"I don't do anything. I stay out of trouble, do what I'm supposed to do and that's it. I can play basketball. I'm very fortunate, but I'm not too exciting.\"\n\nWilliams easily could have been a first-rounder out of Bremerton (Wash.) High School last June. Instead, he went to North Carolina and played behind two players who will be chosen well behind him, Sean May and Jawad Williams.\n\n\"It was different for me at first,\" he said. \"It wasn't necessarily tough. It was good for our team. I just wanted to win.\"\n\nWilliams agrees with those who say he needs time to mature. He leaves the hype about his multi-dimensional game to others.\n\nMay raves about his teammate, calling him a tough rebounder who can shoot better than most realize, a small forward who probably will grow into a power forward later in his career.\n\n\"The kid's unbelievable,\" May said. \"He does stuff in practice that I'll be talking about for the next 10 years.\"\n\nAll this about a forward who averaged 11.3 points per game. With Williams, it's the moments, not the statistics, that show how good he might become, like his game-winning tip-in against Illinois in the NCAA title game.\n\nScouts also see enormous potential in a 6-9 frame that has plenty of room for more muscle.\n\nAsked where he wants to improve, Williams answered, \"Everywhere. I can get bigger, faster, stronger. I can shoot it better. I can handle better. I can defend better. I have to do everything better.\"\n\nTheir styles couldn't be more different, but Harris said his team will end up with a player of \"impeccable character\" whether they choose Bogut, or Williams.\n\n\"I don't think you can go wrong in either direction,\" he said.\n\nMOCK DRAFT By Staff Writer Paul Strelow 1.
