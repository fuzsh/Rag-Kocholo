        "text": "Veteran NBA.com and Turner Sports reporter David Aldridge said Friday that the Orlando Magic are among several teams \"talking with\" free-agent forward Marvin Williams.\n\nWilliams, 28, has never lived up to his Draft position--the Atlanta Hawks made him the second overall choice in 2005, ahead of such luminaries as Deron Williams and Chris Paul--but has nonetheless carved out a solid career as a role-player for the Hawks and Utah Jazz. In his most recent season, the North Carolina product averaged 9.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 1.2 assists on 43.9 percent shooting from the floor. He connected on 35.9 percent of his three-pointers, attempting 3.5 per contest.\n\nAccording to Aldridge, Williams remains in a holding pattern of sorts while LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, the best forwards on the free-agent market, determine with which teams they'll sign."
