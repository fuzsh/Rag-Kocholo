        "text": "Personal Bio/PreCareer Summary\n\nMarvin Gaye Williams Jr. was born in 1986 in Bremerton, Washington to Marvin Williams Sr. and Andrea Gittens. He attended Bremerton High School and dominated the opposition over his last two years. As a junior, Williams posted 23.9 points and 14 rebounds per game and earned the top area player award. And to prove those stats were no fluke, he averaged 28.7 points, 15.5 rebounds, five assists, and four blocks during his senior season. As a result, Williams was subsequently named Washington Gatorade Player of the Year, McDonald's All-American, and First-Team Parade All-American. He has worked with various charities over the years, including as honorary chairman for a Special Olympics event and a trip to Senegal as part of the NBA's Basketball Without Borders program. Not many players have gone from not starting a game in college to a high lottery pick in the NBA. Williams landed on a talented and deep Tar Heel squad in 2004-05 and played bench minutes behind Sean May and Jawad Williams. The 6-foot-9 forward played all 36 games as a reserve, but he managed to log 22.2 minutes per contest and provide 11.3 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.1 steals for a team that won the National Championship. In conference, he won the ACC Rookie of the Year award and was unanimously named to the ACC All-Freshman Team. Williams was even an All-ACC Honorable Mention despite his limited role. He was impressive in the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament. He scored 20 points to lead the Tar Heels past Oakland in the first round and followed it up with a 20-point, 15-rebound performance against Iowa State. His production simmered down for the rest of the Big Dance, but he had a crucial tip-in during the Championship Game against Illinois with less than two minutes remaining that broke a tie. Later in the month, Williams announced his intention to go enter the 2005 NBA Draft. He was selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the second overall pick."
