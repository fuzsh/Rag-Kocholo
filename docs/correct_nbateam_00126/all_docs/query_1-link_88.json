        "text": "I don’t want you to buy Father of Mine.\n\nNot today, at least.\n\nToday, the ebook is $3.99. Tomorrow, and for one week after that, you can get it for ridiculously low price of 99 cents.\n\nIt’s part of a “football is about to come back” vibe that makes me happy and thus willing to do more dumb things than usual. It also has a strategic component. If you read Father of Mine, you will be far more likely to buy the sequel, Son of Mine.\n\nSon of Mine debuts on September 3. You can order the ebook now for only $4.99.\n\nSo, from this Sunday to next Sunday, you can get both for the grand total of $5.98. Look at what other ebooks cost. You’ll get a pair of mob novels set in the ‘70s at prices reminiscent of that decade.\n\nSome would say (and have said) the low price means it’s not very good. The truth is that, in a bizarro Sunday Ticket move, I’m deliberately keeping the price low so that more of you will give it a try.\n\nAnd it’s also good. Despite the fact that I wrote it.\n\nIt wasn’t 12 Angry Men. It was five men and three women. And they weren’t angry at each other; they were pissed at the NFL.\n\nIn the aftermath of the $4.7 billion statement of their disapproval of the league’s antitrust violations, the NFL has argued that one of the eight jurors was biased.\n\nAt the end of a sawed-off shotgun blast of arguments attacking anything and everything about the outcome, the NFL argued that the juror who became the foreperson “had an improper financial stake in the outcome of the litigation but was allowed to remain on — and lead — the jury.”\n\nThe alleged financial stake comes from the fact that the juror pays for a family member’s Sunday Ticket subscription, but that the family member isn’t part of the class. (The purchase happened in 2023, after the package moved from DirecTV to YouTube. The class covers 2011 through 2022.)\n\nFirst of all, the fact that the juror became the foreperson is irrelevant. One of them had to be the foreperson. The question is whether the juror should have been on the jury at all, not whether the juror should have been on the jury but not the foreperson.\n\nSecond, the argument has appeal, on the surface. With a $4.7 billion verdict covering the final 12 years of the NFL-DirecTV relationship, it’s obvious that the first year of the NFL-YouTube arrangement will be attacked under the same argument. The outcome of this case becomes the blueprint for the next case that could benefit that juror.\n\nThird, the NFL still has a problem. As pointed out in the plaintiffs’ response memo, the NFL had a peremptory challenge that it could have used on the juror in question. It didn’t.\n\nThere are two ways to get a juror excused. One, to show the juror has bias and should be stricken for cause. Two, to use a peremptory challenge. (Both sides have a set number to exercise before each case.)\n\nA lawyer not using a peremptory challenge is like a coach not using a timeout. They don’t carry over. In this context, it’s hard to argue that a biased juror slipped through the cracks when the NFL could have remedied the situation with its remaining peremptory strike.\n\nIt’s unclear why the NFL kept the remaining peremptory strike in its back pocket. Regardless, the league had the power to dump the juror but it failed to do so.\n\nThat’s one of the biggest problems with making every possible argument when ending up on the wrong end of a big verdict. Certain arguments point not to legal error but to lawyer error.\n\nI’ve made it through 683 pages of the Sunday Ticket trial transcript. There’s only 1,823 to go.\n\nHooray?\n\nThose 683 pages cover four days of courtroom proceedings. On the fourth day, only one witness was called. To the dismay of Judge Philip Gutierrez. (More on that later.)\n\nThe lone witness was Fox executive Larry Jones. His full day of testimony established one fairly obvious fact about the Sunday Ticket package: The broadcast networks that competed with it didn’t like it.\n\n“I’d rather Sunday Ticket not exist,” Jones said at one point. “From a Fox perspective, I would rather see Sunday Ticket not exist.”\n\nJones confirmed Fox’s request in the most recent negotiations that Sunday Ticket be priced no lower than $293.96 per season. He acknowledged that Sunday Ticket was an “existential” threat to Fox’s NFL business.\n\nFox, and CBS, don’t like Sunday Ticket because it draws viewers away from the broadcasts of their games. They prefer exclusivity. The absence of it drove Fox from the Thursday Night Football business, since its games were available on NFL Network and Amazon.\n\n\"[W]e actually had to get out of that contract a year earlier because it was pretty much a financial disaster for us,” Jones said, “and the real problem with Thursday Night Football if you’re a broadcaster is we didn’t have exclusivity to those games, so we would put a game on, on Thursday night, but the NFL Network would also have the same game simulcast, our telecast, and then Amazon, I think it was, also had that game. So we were now one of three places you could watch the game on Thursday night, and that really took a hit against our ad revenue.”\n\nCBS and Fox want only one place to watch their games. They don’t want fans to have the option to watch other games, produced by CBS and Fox, on another platform.\n\nThat’s what prompted the NFL to ensure Sunday Ticket would be priced in a way that kept most fans from not choosing to pay for Sunday Ticket, which first required them to get a satellite dish and pay for DirecTV.\n\nIt’s the heart of the case. The 32 teams of the NFL — 32 distinct businesses — came together to guarantee that the price will be high enough to find the sweet spot between having enough Sunday Ticket subscribers to justify the money DirecTV paid and enough non-subscribers to justify the money CBS and Fox paid for the games available at no charge in all local markets.\n\nThe key testimony from Adams could have been harvested in an hour, not a full day. Which resulted in the fourth day of the trial getting very interesting after Jones finished testifying and the jury was excused.\n\nTo the extent that the plaintiffs began to alienate Judge Gutierrez, that’s apparently the day it happened.\n\n“How did we get to one witness today?” Judge Gutierrez asked Amanda Bonn, the lawyer who questioned Jones for the plaintiffs. “I mean, you indicated that your estimate was one hour on direct and we were like two hours and 33 minutes. . . . [S]ometimes I thought you were taking a deposition.”\n\n“Well, we — the documents didn’t get produced by Fox, they got produced by the NFL, so we just were doing our best, and I apologize it went longer than the estimate,” Bonn said.\n\n“I’ll give you this warning,” Judge Gutierrez said. “You’re not going to get any extra time more than 25 hours [to submit your case] because you took a deposition today. I don’t care for the reason -- I mean, why weren’t -- why wasn’t this witness asked about those documents during [his] deposition? What’s the answer to that?”\n\n“Your Honor,” Bonn said, “I apologize, and I can’t answer. I wasn’t on this matter at that time. I apologize for that.”\n\n“I mean, it seems in some respects the trial’s going a bit oddly because I do feel like a deposition’s being taken,” Judge Gutierrez said. “Whether or not you were part of the trial team really is of no concern of mine, but it seems to me that you shouldn’t be asking the witness about a document for the first time at trial. This is the point I hit upon yesterday. The crude term would be ‘ambush'; that’s the crude term. But in any event, all I’m saying is it was a deposition and it was quite repetitive and don’t count on any extra time.”\n\nJudge Gutierrez’s frustrations would erupt later in the trial, when he criticized the plaintiffs’ lawyers and threatened to dismiss the case. Whether he was simply trying to move the case along or truly believed the case should be thrown out remains to be seen. Because he now has on his desk an opportunity to grant judgment to the NFL, notwithstanding the verdict.\n\nIt would have been easier to do it, frankly, without that $4.7 billion verdict attached to it. Regardless, the ball is now in his court.\n\nAnd if it happens, the plaintiffs’ lawyers will likely shout a few terms far more crude than “ambush.”\n\nSometimes, reality shows can be a little too real.\n\nThe Giants are experiencing that this month, with Hard Knocks showing the world way too much about the inner workings of an NFL team during the crucial stages of the offseason. The Lions might be getting a little taste of it as well.\n\nDuring the first episode of Receiver on Netflix, receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown reveals that he suffered an oblique injury in Week 3 against the Falcons. The next game came only four days later, against the Packers.\n\n“We have a Thursday game after Atlanta,” St. Brown explains. “So, I can barely — I mean, I’m running but the pain is like, on a 10 it’s like at an eight. Eight or nine. And so I’m like, ‘It’s too late for me not to play. The game plan’s in.’ Painkillers is something I really don’t like to take unless — unless it’s the Packers.”\n\nSt. Brown did indeed play. But he didn’t appear on any of the three injury reports preceding the game.\n\nHe caught five passes for 56 yards against the Packers, including a touchdown that resulted in beer being poured on his helmet.\n\nThe question now becomes whether the league will drench the Lions with some belated scrutiny, given that St. Brown clearly was injured (he missed the next game because of it) and the Lions failed to disclose it prior to Week 4.\n\nThe issue easily could have been avoided in the editing of the episode. They didn’t need to include the fact that the injury originally happened in Week 3.\n\nBut they did. Now, the league has to deal with it. Or not. Either way, the situation proves yet again that the injury reports are far from effective and inside information is rampant.\n\nIn this case, anyone who knew about the injury could have bet on St. Brown to hit the under on his receiving yards prop of 72.5 yards.\n\nSo, again, the NFL can either be proactive and shore up these problems. Or it can wait for the shit to hit the fan, before acting surprised to find smelly brown flecks of fecal matter all over the place.\n\nThe battle of the briefs continues, with $14.1 billion on the line.\n\nIn response to the NFL’s 25-page memorandum of law outlining the umpteen reasons why the $4.7 billion Sunday Ticket antitrust verdict should be overturned, the plaintiffs have submitted a 25-page memorandum of law responding to the NFL’s many, many (many) arguments. PFT has obtained and reviewed a copy of the document.\n\nThe biggest sticking point, as explained in our item about the brief and in a more recent effort to predict the response, relates to the jury’s apparent effort to calculate a verdict literally on an iPhone.\n\nThe league believes that amounts to a rejection of the two formulas the plaintiffs presented, which (in the NFL’s opinion) prevents the jury from coming up with their own methodology. The plaintiffs argue that, basically, violations of the antitrust laws naturally require a little fuzzy math to rectify.\n\nThe plaintiffs submitted evidence of $7 billion in losses to the members of the class. That number came from the difference between the real world, in which the NFL overcharged for Sunday Ticket in order to ensure that many would opt to watch the games offered by their local CBS and/or Fox affiliates, and an alternative universe in which the NFL would have sold the out-of-market games to the various cable channels, allowing fans to simply flip the dial and watch any game at no extra charge.\n\n“The jury heard a proper model, the history of college football telecasts, as a real-world yardstick from which it could have concluded class members would not have paid anything above the price of a regular DirecTV subscription but for the restraints, yielding $7 billion in damages over a 12-year class period,” the plaintiffs argued in their brief.\n\nWith the actual number on the verdict form — $4.7 billion — being lower than the amount the plaintiffs submitted, the outcome reflects (in the opinion of the plaintiffs) “a just and reasonable estimate of damages.”\n\nRegarding the characterization of the outcome as the product of a “runaway jury,” the plaintiffs explain that \"[t]he Court closely supervised and managed the trial and carefully instructed the jury on the law,” that the \"$4.7 billion award here was substantially less than the total amount Plaintiffs reasonably asked for ($7 billion) and $10 billion less than the total licensing revenue the NFL received from DirecTV for Sunday Ticket during the class period ($15 billion).”\n\nIs the number big? Yes. The plaintiffs also point out that it isn’t “unusual for modern antitrust cases to have a recovery in the billions of dollars given the volume of commerce at stake.”\n\nStill, it’s impossible to determine the precise number of billions lost, where (as here) an antitrust violation created a warped reality. The plaintiffs also note that, if the NFL had wanted to offer a reduced formula for calculating damages, it could have. The league opted not to do so.\n\nThe brief ends with this observation: “Those who violate the antitrust laws and thereby prevent a competitive market from existing may not escape accountability by complaining that damages cannot be measured with precision.”\n\nThe league has made that very complaint, in an effort to drive the verdict all the way down to $1. The plaintiffs, in their brief, dismiss the effort to reverse engineer the jury’s verdict as “conjecture.”\n\nNext, the NFL will get the last word in writing. Then, Judge Philip Gutierrez will hear arguments from the parties on July 31. Eventually, the judge will issue a decision.\n\nInevitably, the case will be appealed — all the way to the United States Supreme Court. With that much money on the line, there’s no way either side will accept defeat unless and until every legal stone has been turned."
