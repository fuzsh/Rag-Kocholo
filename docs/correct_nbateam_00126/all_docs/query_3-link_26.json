        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nQuietly worked to become a highly efficient and effective starting forward (who could also play center when his team decided to play \"small ball\". Was able to start at either forward spot in his earlier days and produced mostly across the board: scored well inside and outside, knocked down the three consistently, rebounded and defended impressively, and hit his free throws. Was also a superb athlete. He was a very late bloomer who took a long time to play up to his talent level in the NBA. Was somewhat prone to injury (which obviously hurt his development somewhat). Was never a great passer, despite excellent hands and overall skills."
