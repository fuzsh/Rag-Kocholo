        "text": "By Nathan Joyce of the Kitsap Sun\n\nWhen Marvin Williams was in the middle of his All-American career at Bremerton High School, he'd say he wanted to play for the Seattle SuperSonics when he reached the NBA so he could still live in Bremerton.\n\nWilliams, now in his third year with the Atlanta Hawks, chuckled at the memory earlier this week.\n\nWilliams will be in town today to play the Sonics, the team he grew up rooting for.\n\nHe's knows this could be the last time he plays an NBA game in Seattle.\n\n\"It's unfortunate if Seattle didn't have a team in the future,\" Williams said, fully aware Sonics owner Clayton Bennett is pursuing a move to Oklahoma City. \"They've had a team as long as I've been alive.\"\n\nThe Hawks flew out of Atlanta on Tuesday to begin a brutal five-game Western Conference road swing (Denver, Portland Phoenix, and Los Angeles are the other stops).\n\nThe subject of a possible Seattle move was discussed during the trip. Williams isn't the only Washington native with the Hawks. Strength and conditioning coach Chattin Hill, who used to work for the Seattle Storm, is from Yakima.\n\n\"I always cheer for Seattle sports,\" Williams said. \"I love the Seahawks. That's my thing on Sundays.\"\n\nHawks teammate Josh Smith is from the Atlanta area, and Williams said his running mate has a lot of fun playing before a hometown crowd.\n\nBut Williams was quick to point out how much he likes Atlanta. And with the way things have been going this season, why not?\n\nIf the season ended today, the Hawks would be in the playoffs for the first time since 1999.\n\nThere's a different attitude around the Hawks, which has been one of the NBA's worst franchises the last decade. Williams was even among the contingent of Hawks that insisted they practice on Christmas.\n\nAnd Williams is having a heck of a season.\n\nWilliams, 21, is third on the team in both points per game (16.0) and rebounds (5.8). It's been a satisfying season after missing 17 games with a broken hand last season, helping him begin to silence the critics who thought he should have produced sooner.\n\n\"I think he would've made the jump last year if he wasn't hurt,\" Hawks coach Mike Woodson told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. \"That set him behind big time. He lost so much conditioning, it was like he forgot how to play again.\"\n\nNot that you'll get him to say it.\n\n\"I don't think this year will be satisfying until we make the playoffs,\" Williams said, whose team is in the seventh spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nIf you really press Williams about how good it feels answer his critics, he'll refer you to the man upstairs.\n\n\"I've been up and down since I've been a rookie,\" Williams said. \"It's made me a better player. I just keep my faith in God and hopefully every year I can get better.\"\n\nHe has plenty of time to improve. Though Williams has been in the league for three years, he's still the youngest player on the Hawks.\n\nIn the meantime, he has tickets to worry about. Wiliams is gathering 50 for today's game for all the friends and family that will be at KeyArena. NBA players are allotted two tickets for a road game. Teammates help each other out when they're not using their tickets.\n\nWilliams will have plenty more time to hang around Seattle than usual. In the past, the Hawks have left quickly for another game. The Hawks flew into Seattle late Wednesday night and they won't leave until Saturday morning to fly down to Portland.\n\n\"I may come to Bremerton, and I may not,\" Williams said. \"That'll be a game-time decision.\""
