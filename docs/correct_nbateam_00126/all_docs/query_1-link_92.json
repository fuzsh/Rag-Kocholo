        "text": "The NBA can be an overwhelming experience for every player. The intensity and the physicality of the league can take any player aback during their initial days. However, in case they share the locker room with a notorious NBA star forward, that is bound to happen sooner than later. The NBA has never been for the weak. The vigorous physicality of the league has always prompted NBA stars to put in the work at the gym early.\n\nHowever, unless they have their “welcome to the NBA” moment, they do not realise what it takes to play in the league. This was the case for a $12.1M-worth NBA star in his early days. The 28-year-old star shared his experience involving a former Charlotte Hornets forward in a recent interview.\n\nA 28-year-old NBA star reveals an unpleasant moment with Marvin Williams\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets came off a disappointing season in 2017-18. They finished at 10th place in the Eastern Conference, missing the playoffs for their second consecutive year. However, they saw an opportunity to improve their roster when they traded for the 34th pick in the 2018 draft from the Atlanta Hawks. With this pick, the franchise landed Devonte Graham.\n\nGraham entered the league as part of a stacked NBA roster. The Hornets had just signed San Antonio Spurs legend Tony Parker to join their 4-time All Star, Kemba Walker. They also had some impressive roster pieces that could elevate their game. However, it was the Hornets’ Marvin Williams who gave Graham his “welcome to the NBA” moment.\n\nIn a recent interview, Graham mentioned his moment with Williams that immediately got him thinking about hitting the gym.\n\n“My welcome the NBA moment was probably like the first practices and Marvin Williams…hit me with a crazy screen bro. I was out of practice and rest of the practice. I was probably out like 3 days” [sic] he said.\n\nHe added, “First two possessions of live …boom! Screen. I’m like damn, I gotta start lifting …I gotta lift. I gotta get stronger.”\n\nREAD MORE: Devonte’ Graham, Who Stunned LeBron James’ Lakers off the Bench, Once Had His Support in the NBA MIP Race\n\nGraham sure had his “welcome to the NBA” moment with Williams. However, since then, the 28-year-old has had an impressive stint in the league. Notably, he had a historic moment involving the Oklahoma City Thunder and Shai-Gilgeous Alexander.\n\nGraham shined after a shaky welcome\n\nPlayers in the NBA do not always experience the nicest of welcomes. Devonte Graham too, experienced a similar fate, getting knocked out by Marvin Williams’ screen. However, the 28-year-old has had himself an impressive career in the NBA since.\n\nGraham served the Charlotte Hornets for 3 seasons off the bench. He played a crucial role in the Hornets’ rotation, also lending his support to LaMelo Ball during his rookie year. However, he was eventually traded to the New Orleans Pelicans. This is where he made a historic contribution.\n\nThe Pelicans played the Oklahoma City Thunder in a regular season game in 2021. As the Pelicans were leading 110-107, Shai-Gilgeous Alexander drained a deep clutch triple to tie the scores. However, Graham pulled off an unbelievable buzzer-beating game-winner, launching the shot from 61 feet away.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIt became the longest buzzer-beating game-winner in the history of the league.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWATCH THIS STORY: Weeks After Mark Cuban’s Misunderstanding, Kyrie Irving Fanboys Over $160 Million-Worth Rapper’s 1964 Rendition\n\nGraham may have had a shaky welcome to the league, but it did not stop him from making history. The 28-year-old now plays for the San Antonio Spurs on his $12.1M contract with the franchise. He will now be seen trying to help out superstar teammate Victor Wembanyama in reviving the Spurs dynasty."
