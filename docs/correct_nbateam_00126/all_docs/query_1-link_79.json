        "text": "Utah Jazz (6-5) at Dallas Mavericks (8-4)\n\nFriday, 6:30 p.m.\n\nTV: ROOT\n\nRadio: 1280 AM, 97.5 FM\n\nThe Utah Jazz had a quick stop at home on Wednesday after playing the previous three contests away from the newly named Vivint Arena. They are already back on the road to face off against the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night.\n\nJazz fans will notice some familiar faces on this year's Mavericks team with the most notable being starting point guard Deron Williams. Williams was drafted by the Jazz with the third overall pick back in the 2005 NBA draft. Williams averaged 17.3 points and 9.1 assists per game in his six and a half seasons with the Jazz. Williams was named to the All-Rookie first team back in 2006 and was also named to the All-NBA second team in 2008 and 2010. He was selected to two All-Star teams when he was with the Jazz (2010, 2011) and even won the skills contest at All-Star weekend back in 2008.\n\nWilliams is one of four Mavericks who used to be a member of the Utah Jazz. Guard Wesley Matthews spent his rookie season in Utah after going undrafted in 2009. He averaged 9.4 points per game and started over half of the team's games. After that season he signed a contract with the Portland Trail Blazers, where he averaged 15.4 points per game and became a household name. After five seaons in Portland, he left and joined the Mavericks this offseason. Matthews is coming off of a torn achilies and is only averaging 10.4 points per game in the early part of the season.\n\nMavericks guard Devin Harris spent a season and a half in Utah. The Jazz acquired Harris and forward Derrick Favors in exchange for Deron Williams at the 2011 NBA trade deadline. Harris averaged 12.3 points and 5.1 assists per game with the Jazz. The Jazz traded Harris after the 2011-12 season to the Atlanta Hawks for forward Marvin Williams.\n\n2012 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest champion Jeremy Evans has played in all but two games so far for the Mavericks. Evans spent the first five years of his NBA career with the Utah Jazz where he was an instant fan favorite despite the lack of time he spent on the court. Forward Gordon Hayward is the only member of the Jazz who played with Williams, Matthews, Harris and Evans.\n\nUtah goes into Friday's matchup having won back-to-back games, with the last one being a 93-89 home victory over the Toronto Raptors. Favors led the Jazz with 18 points and 11 rebounds on 78 percent shooting. Hayward had a pair of clutch 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to go along with his 17 points and seven rebounds to help close out the game.\n\nThe Mavericks hold the league's third longest active win streak behind the Golden State Warriors (13) and San Antonio (six) with five straight victories. Seventeen-year pro Dirk Nowitzki is averaging 18.5 points and seven rebounds per game. Williams is averaging 13 points and 5.4 assists per game, and center Zaza Pachulia has been an unexpected bright spot with averages of 10.3 points and 9.8 rebounds per contest.\n\nAfter losing starters Monta Ellis, Tyson Chandler and Rajon Rondo in free agency, most people expected Dallas to take a step back and fall in the Western Conference standings. However, they have started the season with an 8-4 record and are third in the West behind Golden State (13-0) and San Antonio (9-2). The Jazz are off to a 6-5 start and find themselves in the fifth position in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Jazz score the second fewest points per game in the league with 95.3 points per game, but they also allow the second fewest points per game with 91.5 points per game. Dallas is averaging 101.3 points per game and allows 99.7 points per game. Utah is 4-4 on the road and Dallas is 3-2 at home.\n\nThe game starts at 6:30 p.m. MST. Pregame coverage starts at 6 p.m. on Root Sports and 5:30 p.m. on 97.5 and 1280 The Zone."
