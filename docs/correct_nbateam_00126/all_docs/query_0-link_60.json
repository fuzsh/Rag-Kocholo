        "text": "Free agent forward Marvin Williams reached a two-year, $14 million deal with the Charlotte Hornets, a person familiar with the agreement told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal until it is official.\n\nWilliams heads to Charlotte after the Hornets lost out on swingman Gordon Hayward when the Utah Jazz matched Charlotte's offer sheet for Hayward.\n\nWilliams, who averaged 9.1 points and 5.1 rebounds for Utah last season, was on several teams' list but liked the situation in Charlotte. The Hornets are an improving and promising team. They made the playoffs last season for the first time since 2010 and for just the second time since 2004-05.\n\nCoach Steve Clifford quickly changed the culture with help from veteran big man Al Jefferson and young point guard Kemba Walker. Williams has plenty of playoff experience from his time with the Atlanta Hawks."
