        "text": "Marvin Williams News\n\nMarvin Williams Retires From Basketball\n\nMilwaukee Bucks forward Marvin Williams has decided to retire from the NBA. The 34-year-old is walking away from the game after 15 productive seasons in the league. \"I've been very blessed. God has been very, very good to me,\" Williams said. He was unable to win a championship before retiring, but put up fairly solid career numbers. Williams averaged 10.2 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 1.3 assists during his NBA career. He won't make the Hall of Fame, but he had a productive career nonetheless.\n\nSep 9\n\nMarvin Williams is Planning to Sign with Bucks\n\nCharlotte Hornets forward Marvin Williams is finalizing a buyout with the organization and plans to sign with the Milwaukee Bucks. It's a great fit for Williams, but it's not an ideal spot for his fantasy value. He'll come off the bench, but won't see huge minutes while the Bucks are healthy. Williams isn't going to be worth using in most formats, but we'll see how he performs. Dragan Bender has been waived by the Bucks in order to open up a roster spot for Williams. Bender has only played a handful of games with Milwaukee this season and doesn't have fantasy value.\n\nFeb 8\n\nMarvin Williams Might Play on Friday\n\nCharlotte Hornets forward Marvin Williams (nose) is listed as questionable for Friday's game against the Utah Jazz. He's missed each of the last two games after undergoing a procedure to repair his broken nose. There's a chance that he wears a mask, but he shouldn't be sidelined any longer. Fantasy owners should check back on Friday for more information.\n\nJan 9\n\nMarvin Williams is Downgraded to Doubtful\n\nCharlotte Hornets forward Marvin Williams (nose) has been downgraded to doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Toronto Raptors. It appears he's going to miss his second straight game, but will hopefully return after Wednesday. Miles Bridges will see more playing time coming his way. Bridges is worth a look as a DFS option for Wednesday, assuming Williams is out.\n\nJan 8\n\nMarvin Williams is Probable for Tuesday\n\nCharlotte Hornets forward Marvin Williams (knee) is listed as probable for Tuesday's game against the Sacramento Kings. Williams should see more playing time coming his way with PJ Washington (finger) sidelined. The Hornets have been reportedly shopping Williams on the trade market. He's going to carry decent fantasy value while Washington is out.\n\nDec 16\n\nMarvin Williams Won't Play on Sunday\n\nCharlotte Hornets forward Marvin Williams (knee) has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Indiana Pacers. He continues to deal with a nagging knee issue, but hopefully he'll be back on the court soon. Cody Martin, Dwayne Bacon and Malik Monk will see increased minutes. PJ Washington (finger) won't play on Sunday, so Michael Kidd-Gilchrist should get more chances coming his way.\n\nDec 14\n\nMarvin Williams Ruled Out Against Bulls\n\nCharlotte Hornets forward Marvin Williams (knee) has been ruled out for Friday's game against the Chicago Bulls. Miles Bridges and PJ Washington will see increased playing time, especially with Nicolas Batum (hand) doubtful for Friday as well. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist has been back in the rotation lately, but will lose most of his minutes once Williams is healthy again.\n\nDec 12\n\nMarvin Williams is Doubtful for Tuesday\n\nCharlotte Hornets forward Marvin Williams (knee) is listed as doubtful for Tuesday's game against the Washington Wizards. It appears Williams is likely going to miss his second game in a row on Tuesday. There is a chance that Williams gets traded with the Hornets rebuilding. PJ Washington has been playing better lately and his stock seems to be rising quickly.\n\nDec 9\n\nMarvin Williams is Ruled Out for Sunday\n\nCharlotte Hornets forward Marvin Williams (knee) has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Atlanta Hawks. He was listed as probable, but is going to sit out due to a sore right knee. Miles Bridges should see increased minutes and shots coming his way without Williams available. DFS players should take a look at Bridges for this one.\n\nDec 8"
