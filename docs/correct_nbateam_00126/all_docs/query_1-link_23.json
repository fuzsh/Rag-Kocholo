        "text": "CHARLOTTE – Marvin Williams remembers when he was 13 years old, he and a friend got into the car and made the 45-minute trip from Bremerton to Tacoma to watch the skinny, 6-foot-5 kid everyone was talking about play in the Washington state championship.\n\nJamal Crawford and Rainier Beach were nationally ranked. People from all over the state would come to Seattle to see him play, and Crawford put on a show, whether it was with a flashy no-look pass, or the nasty crossover that’s still his signature move nearly two decades later.\n\nFor seventh-grader Marvin Williams and kids his age, it was more than a show, it was an inspiration for them to get on the court and imagine a future playing basketball.\n\n“Jamal, for my generation, was the guy,” Williams said\n\n(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nTen years later, in the summer of 2009, the seventh grader in the Tacoma Dome stands and the Rainier Beach High School superstar became teammates with the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nWilliams had gone on to be an All-American in his senior year at Bremerton. Throughout high school, he’d finish practice at the high school and get on the ferry to Seattle, where the Seattle Rotary coach would pick him up. He’d practice in the city, and get on the ferry again to come home. Williams still remembers the times on the ferry schedules – the 5:10 over to Seattle, and the 8:30 back home.\n\nWilliams and some of the guys he played AAU ball with in Seattle were starting to make an impact on the league in '09 by the time Crawford came to Atlanta in a trade. Seattle natives Aaron Brooks and Rodney Stuckey were both starting point guards, but in the minds of all those guys, Jamal Crawford was still the one they all looked up to.\n\n“Dude was legendary back then. It was a bigger deal to me than anybody else when we signed him to Atlanta,” Williams said.\n\nYou’d think, at that point, it would have been tough for the 23-year-old Williams to start thinking of Crawford as a teammate and fellow professional rather than an icon. It’s a process a lot of young players go through, making the adjustment from thinking of their favorite basketball players as heroes to thinking of them as veterans, competitors or teammates.\n\nWilliams brushed that suggestion aside. Crawford made the adjustment easy.\n\n“He’s just like a regular guy, quiet dude, always laughing, playing, joking. He’s such a humble, good guy, there wasn’t much of an adjustment period,” Williams said.\n\n(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nWilliams’ story gets to the heart of what’s kept basketball alive in Seattle. Clay Bennett bought the Sonics from Howard Schultz in the summer of 2006 – a decade ago – and the ball started rolling on the franchise's move. Next year, the Oklahoma City Thunder will begin their tenth season in the league.\n\nAnd yet, Williams says, the basketball culture is as strong as ever in Seattle. If you walk into a YMCA in the city, there’s a chance you might see Isaiah Thomas or Spencer Hawes on the court. Williams says when he’s back in Bremerton and he wants to get a run in, he’ll call Crawford or Hawes or Brooks, and they’ll let him know where the next game’s at.\n\n“Those dudes are literally playing pick-up anywhere,” Williams said.\n\nAnd the players aren’t just spending time there, they’re giving back. Construction began last summer on a rec center in Bremerton that will be named for Williams. Garfield High School grad Brandon Roy, whose NBA career was cut short by knee injuries, is coaching the player many believe will be the city's next future star – Michael Porter Jr. – at Nathan Hale High School.\n\nYou won't find that in every city. Seattle has a special relationship with the game, and the reason traces back to one guy. It’s Crawford.\n\nMore accurately, it’s the mantle Crawford’s taken from guys like Doug Christie before him as the ambassador of basketball in the city. The Seattle Pro-Am he organizes every summer costs $5 for adults, it's free to kids, and all the proceeds go to his foundation.\n\nWhen Williams was a kid, he had the chance to drive over Key Arena and see Gary Payton play against Kevin Garnett. Kids in Seattle don’t have that opportunity to see their favorite NBA players anymore, but because of the Pro-Am, they can go down to Seattle Pacific University, and see Crawford, Zach Lavine, Dejounte Murray, Stuckey, Nate Robinson, Porter and others play, all for free.\n\n“What Jamal’s doing for the city with his Pro-Am League every single year is huge. You see so many players in the NBA that go back there to play, that live there that are from there, I think that’s really keeping (the culture) going,” Williams said.\n\nThe basketball culture has remained vibrant in Seattle, even as efforts to bring back the Sonics have fallen short. Hedge fund manager Chris Hansen has pledged to privately finance a new $500 million arena, but he’s been battling both the league and the city for years, so far to no avail.\n\nWilliams hopes the NBA can come back to the city sometime in the near future.\n\n“You ask guys that aren’t even from Seattle, they miss the team in Seattle. It really is a basketball city,” Williams said. “If the NBA has the opportunity to get a team back in Seattle man, they have to do it. Not just for me or for Nate (Robinson) or Jamal or Zach LaVine or IT (Isaiah Thomas), but the kids in Seattle now man, to have that pro team that we looked up to when we were kids, we were watching those games.”\n\nWilliams came to Charlotte in 2014, and says he saw a lot of parallels between his new home and the place he grew up.\n\n“I was here the first year the Bobcats went back to the Hornets, and you know I couldn’t understand how or why the city was so excited that the Hornets were back. And I thought about it man, and I’m like, ‘Well their team was taken away from them too, you know.’”\n\nEven though the team came back as the Bobcats three years after the move to New Orleans, Williams got the sense that it wasn’t the same for the fans.\n\n“When they got the Hornets back I could feel the excitement in Charlotte about how excited they were to have their team back man. So I feel like if a team ever went back to Seattle, you would get that same type of excitement, definitely.”\n\nFor now, the new arena in Seattle is just drawings on a page. Guys like Williams, Hawes, Stuckey, Brooks, Robinson and especially Crawford, will be in college gyms or at the Y – wherever the next run is – keeping the passion for basketball alive in their city.\n\nSports editor Jack Flagler can be reached at jflagler@gastongazette.com, 704-869-1841 or on Twitter @jflagler."
