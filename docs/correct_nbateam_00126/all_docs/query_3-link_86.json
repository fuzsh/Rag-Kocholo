        "text": "A Place for Gathering\n\nSince time immemorial, communities have had a gathering place. That place often resided in a special location, sometimes in the center of a village, often in the shade of an ancient tree. Now the Marvin Williams Center joins that dynasty of community gathering places as it serves the community of West Bremerton and beyond.\n\nThe Marvin Williams Center was created to encourage widespread public access and enjoyment. This 20,000 square foot, two story, state of the art facility is designed to foster a sense of community and provide a platform for extraordinary events. Whether it is a kids basketball game, a cooking class or a wedding reception, the Marvin Williams Center provides a beautiful and comfortable setting for all.\n\nWhat the facility has to offer\n\nThe Marvin Williams Recreational Center will have lots going on every day. Throughout the year, there will be beneficial programs offered for toddlers to adults, such as: Toddler Gym, Ballroom Dance, Youth Mentoring, Academic Tutoring, 30 Minute Meals and many more!\n\nThe facility is also a perfect place for your event, both large and small. You can rent a single room, such as our Cooking Theater Classroom for a gourmet cooking class, or reserve the entire facility for a large event. Our 7,000 square foot gymnasium is a multi-purpose facility which can easily be transformed into a beautiful site for a wedding reception, inaugural banquet, trade show, birthday, anniversary celebration or any special occasion.\n\nSome of the great features of the MW Center include:\n\nAn Open and Inviting Lobby & Courtyard\n\nMeeting Room Rentals\n\nCelebration & Social Event Rentals\n\nCommercial Catering Kitchen\n\nCooking Theater Classroom\n\nOpen Gym\n\nFree Wifi\n\nComputer Lab\n\nLocker Rooms\n\nContact us today to reserve space for your event:\n\nevents@mwcenter.org or 360-377-6000"
