Atlanta Hawks GM Danny Ferry blew up his team's core on Tuesday. And then he decided to spray a little extra lighter fluid to stoke the fire.

Just hours after the Hawks reportedly agreed to trade All-Star guard Joe Johnson to the Brooklyn Nets for a collection of spare parts and a Draft pick, Atlanta agreed to move to trade forward Marvin Williams to the Utah Jazz for guard Devin Harris, according to ESPN.com.

Williams, 26, has spent the entirety of his 7-year NBA career with the Hawks, posting career averages of 11.5 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.2 assists. He's on the books $8.3 million in 2012-13 and $7.5 million in 2013-14.

Harris, 29, averaged 11.3 points and 5.0 assists as the starting point guard for the Jazz last season. He's set to make $8.5 million in 2012-13, the final year of his current contract.

For Atlanta, this is all about reducing future salary commitments. Getting out of Johnson and Williams saves them $75 million in future salary. As it stands now, they can easily extend forward Josh Smith if they like and still enter the summer of 2013 with significant cap space. Harris will likely plug into a back-up point guard position in a backcourt that includes Jeff Teague and the parts that are coming over from Brooklyn (Anthony Morrow and DeShawn Stevenson). Atlanta clearly has some heavy lifting to do to fill out its perimeter after the twin departures of Johnson and Williams.
