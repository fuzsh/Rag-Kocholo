NEW YORK — The Atlanta Hawks Marvin Williams was suspended for two games and the New York Knicks’ Shawne Williams one game for throwing punches Friday night.

Marvin Williams started things when he shoved Shawne Williams in the back as they ran up the court with 43 seconds left in the Hawks’ 111-102 victory. The NBA cited Marvin Williams on Saturday for throwing punches and fighting, while Shawne Williams got a one-game ban for throwing a punch during an altercation.

Both suspensions are without pay.

Marvin Williams missed the Hawks’ game at Dallas on Saturday night and also will sit out at home against Toronto on Wednesday night. Shawne Williams will sit out when the Knicks host Detroit on Sunday.

Hawks coach Larry Drew accepted the length of Marvin Williams’ suspension without protest.

“There was no real expectations on the length as far as I was concerned,” Drew said. “I didn’t even see the instant replay. I knew something would take place as far as a suspension. The league made a ruling on it and we just have to live with it.”

Drew said Williams, who can’t be in the arena for games while he’s suspended, was back at the team hotel and in good spirits.

“I saw him at breakfast and he was in great shape,” Drew said. “He’s ready to move on. It’s an unfortunate set of circumstances and you’ve got to put it behind you.”

Marvin Williams has already missed 15 games this season with back and right knee injuries.

Maurice Evans moved into the starting lineup in place of Marvin Williams, who’s averaging 10.9 points and 4.8 rebounds.
