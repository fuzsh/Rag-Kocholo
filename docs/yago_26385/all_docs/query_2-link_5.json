        "text": "It is the night of 9/10 July 1916 on the Somme, 9 days after the opening of the Battle of the Somme, the first day of which alone had cost 20 000 dead and 40 000 wounded; the worst single casualty list in the history of the British Army.\n\nThe 11th battalion of the Border Regiment had taken part in the attack on 1 July. Of its strength of 850 men, by the end of the day 516 had gone. It was withdrawn from the line, but returned 1 week later, now numbering 250 out of its original compliment of 850. The officers now in charge, all the original officers having been killed, were then told to chose 100 men for a trench raid.\n\nNews spread among the men, and a number started reporting sick to the battalion Medical Officer, one Lieutenant Kirkwood of the Royal Army Medical Corps. He agreed the men were unfit, and wrote a memorandum stating why. The first of July had demoralized the unit, and the intervening few days had not helped, possibly because one of their main tasks had been sorting through the kits of their dead comrades, and digging out the dead and decomposing bodies under continuous shell fire. Dr Kirkwood reported that 20 of the unit were now suffering from shell shock. It made no difference, and the attack went ahead. It was a predictable failure. Afterwards Sir Hubert Gough, Army Commander, vented his rage on the men, who had blighted the honour of the army, and ‘shown an utter want of manly spirit and courage which is expected of every soldier and every Britisher.’\n\nBut Gough’s real rage was reserved for Kirkwood. According to Gough he was totally unfit to be a regimental medical officer, he had ‘no conception of its duties or role ... as long as he is allowed to remain in service he will be a source of danger to it ... Sympathy for the sick and wounded is a good attribute for a doctor, but it is not for him to inform the Commanding Officer that his men are not in a fit state to carry out a military operation’.\n\nKirkwood was dismissed.\n\nBut that was not the last word. Sir Arthur Sloggett was in overall charge of all medical services in France. A tough but wily politician, he deplored Gough’s action, blaming instead the Brigadier who had ordered the attack in ignorance of the state of the battalion, with the Medical Officer being the unfortunate scapegoat.\n\nKirkwood’s story is but one of the many fascinating episodes recounted by Ben Shephard in his masterly account of the complex relationship between psychiatry and the military. It is a story populated with numerous well-drawn characters, few of them heroes, few of them villains either. Instead it is a tale of moral complexity and ambiguity. What is the relationship between adversity and mental illness? Why do men break down in battle? What if anything can be done to prevent this? And what is the task of the military psychiatrist? Is he responsible for the welfare of the men, protecting them from needless horror, as Kirkwood believed? Or he is the agent of the military, acting as do all men in uniform, to assist the completion of the mission, to win the fight irrespective of any later mental consequences?\n\nShephard’s seminal account shows clearly that most military psychiatrists tend to follow the majority, and to act largely as servants of the military. Kirkwood is the exception, not the rule. But Shephard is far too good an historian to condemn them as unfeeling agents of authority. He is aware of two uncomfortable issues. First, we should remember that maintaining military manpower to allow the mission to be completed is indeed the task of all military doctors—the motto of the US Army Medical Corp is after all ‘to conserve the fighting strength’.\n\nMedically qualified readers of this journal will be aware of the concept of triage—to give priority to those in need. Civilian doctors do this in every Accident and Emergency Department in the land, in order to treat the most medically sick first. But for military doctors triage means treating first those who can be returned to action at the expense of those who cannot. The military doctor prioritizes the needs of the group, the army, continuing its mission, whilst for the civilian doctor there is no mission to complete. One of the intriguing questions raised by Shephard, and currently being fought out in the High Court, is whether or not the collective, group values at the heart of military culture can survive in our current individualistically orientated society.\n\nShephard also highlights a second dilemma, one that also remains unresolved. First World War doctors were never clear as to the best methods of either preventing or treating war related psychiatric disorder—and if we are being honest we are not much further forward either. However, on one thing they were sure. Treating psychiatric injury like physical injury—evacuating those afflicted out of harms way and safely to the rear, did not work. Instead, individuals became separated from their unit, convinced they were suffering from serious quasi physical disorders (hence the rapid abandonment of the term shell shock, since it implied a physical concussion to the brain), and soon began to view themselves as failures, chronically sick, and broken down. Their long term prognosis was poor and most did not recover. Instead the doctrine insisted that men should be treated in uniform, with their comrades, close to the front line, and be told they were simply exhausted, and would be able to return to their duties in a matter of days.\n\nEven now, we still do not know if this policy really does prevent long term psychiatric disorder. If it does, the military can have their cake and eat it—conserve the fighting strength and reduce subsequent psychiatric disorder at one and the same time. Given the impossibility of ever conducting a randomized controlled trial on the subject I doubt we will ever know. Instead, we are forced to fall back on anecdote and experience. We are left to marvel at the fortitude of the human spirit, since most men do not develop psychiatric disorder after combat, even if we think they should. We respect the many and ingenious ways in which psychiatrists have attempted to reduce this, but above all end up convinced of the unchanging mental cost of warfare.\n\nShepherd himself ends his journey pessimistically—that at various points in the narrative psychiatrists have made things worse (he is scathing about the political manipulations that led to the introduction of the diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after America’s Vietnam ordeal, and merciless about the iatrogenic mess that constituted the Veteran’s Administration’s well meaning but misguided attempts to treat the new condition). Shephard is certain that psychiatrists can harm, and remains to be convinced they can do much good.\n\nShephard’s narrative drive never falters, and his knowledge of the literature is awesome. His book must be read by anyone with any interest in the subject of men at war. It is a moving and compassionate account, but not an optimistic one. Shephard correctly has little time for the historical Whiggish narratives so beloved of amateur psychiatric historians—contrasting a Dark Age in which men with psychiatric disorders were shot with our own enlightened era in which they receive psychotherapy to heal all wounds. Both are simplistic and inaccurate, since there is no Holy Grail that can prevent the mental cost of war. Perhaps the lesson is that the only proven way of preventing war-related psychiatric disorder is not to send men to war.\n\n© International Epidemiological Association 2002"
