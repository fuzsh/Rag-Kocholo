        "text": "Friday Questions\n\nThis would have been my mom’s birthday. I miss her everyday. It’s also Friday Question day.\n\nCharles H. Bryan gets us started.\n\nIs there ever concern in a multi'cam about actors' footwear so as not to make noise on the floor of the set? Clomp Clomp Clomp or click click click would be hard to remove from the mix. (I was watching BIG BANG THEORY and noticed Leonard wearing tennis shoes on the hardwood kitchen floor. That's appropriate footwear for that character, but it can't be so for everyone.)\n\nI must say it’s a question that’s never come up. I do know we did a funny episode of CHEERS where Cliff had squeaky shoes, but I can’t recall ever watching a rough cut of an episode and being distracted by the clacking of shoes. Maybe actors wear rubber souls whenever they can, I dunno.\n\nHere's the squeaky shoes scene:\n\nUnkystan has a question about my play, A OR B?:\n\nAny chance for an off-Broadway run in New York?\n\nI would love that. Just need someone to make me an offer. I’m thinking of changing the title from A OR B? to A OR HAMILTON? Whattaya think?\n\nFrom Rashad:\n\nI found a two-act play that I had written approximately 13 years ago, when I was a grad student and still believing I would become a professional writer someday. Should I reread the f**ker in order to refresh my memory...or should I just put it away in another drawer and forget all about it (again)? Thanks in advance!\n\nThis is not easy to answer since I haven’t read the play and I’m not clairvoyant. But sure, look it over. What the hell? If it’s terrible you can throw in the drawer, chalk it up to your inexperience and age at the time, but who knows? You might be pleasantly surprised. Or you might see a new way to go and be inspired to rewrite it. What’s the worst that can happen? It’s not like a CAA agent is going to see it lying around and file legal papers to have you banned from show business. (They tried that with me once but it didn't stick.)\n\nTimothy wraps it up with a CHEERS pilot question.\n\nIn reading reviews and the history of \"Give Me a Ring Sometime\", it seems that there was another patron character that was intended to be in the cast, an older cantankerous woman in a wheelchair. Several places online it is noted that she was played by Elaine Stritch. The interesting part of this is I recall watching a scene with Diane and Coach where there was a woman in purple sitting in a wheelchair that seemed to be paying a great deal of attention to what was being said, and I thought to myself \"Well, there's an extra that isn't really doing her job\", and funny enough it was this character. Can you confirm that it was Elaine Stritch (it sure doesn't LOOK like her), and why she was editied and written out?\n\nFirst off, that was not Elaine Stritch. We tried to use Ms. Stritch in an episode seven or eight years and let’s just say it was not a good match.\n\nIn the original pilot there was a character named Miss Littlefield who was a cantankerous older woman. Upon seeing a rough cut the producers decided to take her out of the show, which they did with some deft editing. But as you mentioned, she is still visible in the background in a couple of shots, but she has no lines.\n\nHer character also then had to be rewritten out of the next few scripts, as the plan was to make her a regular bar patron.\n\nHappy Birthday, Mom... wherever you are.\n\nShould Sam & Diane have gone off together in the end?\n\nThere’s been a lot of great debate lately in my blog about the Sam & Diane ending of the final episode of CHEERS. Check the comments section from last Friday’s post. Even the great Steven Moffat (SHERLOCK, DR. WHO, COUPLING) weighed in with a CHEERS-related opinion.\n\nQuick aside: Steven’s sitcom, COUPLING, is my all-time favorite British sitcom. And you know how much I love FAWLTY TOWERS and BLACK ADDER.\n\nBut getting back to Sam & Diane, some readers felt cheated that they ultimately didn’t end up together. Sam & Diane clearly had a huge attraction for each other, and obviously loved each other. Satisfying endings of romantic comedies almost demand that the couple ride off into the sunset together.\n\nOthers felt that wasn’t realistic, and that for whatever love and lust Sam & Diane had for each other they still were not a good match.\n\nThe final episode was conceived and written by Glen & Les Charles. I remember discussions in the room about how to resolve the Sam & Diane relationship and if memory serves, there was never any intention of getting them together at the end.\n\nAnd I must say, I agreed with that decision then and still do. (Sorry Diane D.)\n\nSam & Diane were so different. Their relationship (for comic and dramatic purposes) was fraught with conflict. Most of our time was spent devising new, funny, and fresh complications for them. Projecting forward, I believe they would driven each other insane had they gone off hand-in-hand – each with the best intentions, but ending with restraining orders.\n\nA major research company conducted a survey just before the airing of the final episode. Only 21% felt Sam should marry Diane. (19% said he should marry Rebecca, which is just idiotic.) And 48% said Sam should stay single. At the time of this survey no one on staff had read it or even heard about it. Not that that would have made any difference.\n\nI loved how bittersweet the ending was. Has there ever been someone in your life you long for but deep down in your heart-of-hearts you know they’re wrong for you?\n\nAnd in this case Sam really had to choose between Diane and moving to Los Angeles or his friends, his bar, and Boston. I believe his true love was the bar and as such it is a happy ending.\n\nBut the truth is, in whatever direction the Charles Brothers chose there was going to be a large segment of fans who would be unhappy. The safe move was to just not have Diane return at all. But that really would have been cheating. I applaud Glen & Les for taking a stand (and writing a beautiful script).\n\nAnd even though breaking up was heartbreaking for Sam & Diane, I’d like to think that over time they’d each be happier with someone else. But it would piss each other off that they were.\n\nWhat do you think? Let the debate continue!\n\nMisc-Takes\n\nIn no particular order...\n\nI love BETTER CALL SAUL. I hope their next spinoff is INSTEAD OF HIM, CALL KIM?\n\nKelly Ripa had a right to be pissed. She should have been told Michael Strahan was leaving her show more than five minutes before the news went public. But this is becoming the norm these days. There is no such thing as courtesy or respect anymore. Suits routinely avoid awkward situations. If they reject something, half the time they don’t even get back to the submitter. And if they do respond, instead of a phone call it’s now maybe a terse email. Taking other peoples’ feelings into account is a complete non-issue for many of them. So props to Kelly Ripa for calling them out. Whether you like her act or not, she makes a shit-ton of money for these suits. It’s not just a matter of courtesy, they OWED her a heads-up on the Strahan situation.\n\nNow who do I see about applying for her co-host role?\n\nGood time to be a baseball fan in Chicago regardless of your team. When was the last time that happened? I think Buchanan was president.\n\nI mentioned this on Twitter (you’re welcome to follow me): All these radio stations playing Prince songs -- how many of them played Prince before he died?\n\nWas not a big fan of Louis CK’s HORACE AND PETE. It was like “what if CHEERS wasn’t funny?” But I did love Alan Alda in it. He played the most bigoted foul-mouthed character on television (or whatever platform that was). All the things we wish we could have written for him as Hawkeye he got to do.\n\nForget Trevor Noah. Give me Samantha Bee.\n\nVin Scully, on Monday’s Dodger broadcast, suggested you use the word “INCORRECT” for your computer passwords. That way if you forget it a box will pop up saying: “Your password is INCORRECT.” What are we going to do when he retires?\n\nHuffpost Wednesday Headline: How Women Deal With Periods in Space\n\nSince the Golden State Warriors had the best regular season record in NBA history I think they should get a bye on every playoff series until the Finals. Every other team should battle it out for the right to play them. And then the Warriors should start with a 2-0 game lead.\n\nSpeaking of basketball, it’s called a “hoop” Ted Cruz, not a “ring.” You’d know that if you watched a game and not spent all your free time at a Brooklyn matzo factory.\n\nNew York can no longer lord it over Los Angeles. We now have a Shake Shack. The lines are way too long (it's just a friggin' hamburger), but just knowing we have one is enough. HA!\n\nHow’d you like to be a Tony nominee this year up against HAMILTON? Good luck. The only suspense will be whether the many acceptance speeches will be in rhyme.\n\nHuffPost Wednesday headline: Amy Schumer Recounts That Time Jennifer Lawrence Peed In A Bidet\n\nIs Pat Boone the only artist not doing a cover of “Purple Rain?”\n\nWho should Donald Trump’s running mate be? Hulk Hogan? Ted Nugent? Scot Baio? Gary Busey? Mike Tyson (yeah, he’ll get the women’s vote)? Or Dennis Rodman? Suddenly Sarah Palin starts lookin’ pretty good, huh?\n\nTomorrow I tackle the controversial issue you’ve been debating hot n’ heavy in the comments section – whether Sam & Diane should have ended up together? Fireworks ensue. See you then.\n\nMy best radio practical joke\n\nPeople seem to like my radio stories so here's another one.\n\nBack in the days when one company didn’t own ten stations in the same market there was such a thing as “competition”. Especially in the ‘60s and ‘70s there were usually two rock stations going head-to-head in every town. This could lead to radio wars. Stations would try to sabotage each others contests and promotions. It was all in good fun.\n\nBest of all was if you could somehow get on the air on the competing station and embarrass them live.\n\nYou didn’t have to be employees of the competing station to participate. You could be a diabolical listener just out for a few laughs.\n\nI have been known to be one such diabolical listener (little wonder I became co-writer of all the CHEERS practical joke Bar Wars episodes).\n\nThe irony is that I have since become good friends with the disc jockey I punked – Charlie Van Dyke. We even went out to lunch recently (along with KHJ Boss Jock Mark Elliott). Charlie's in the middle.\n\nBut in 1973 I had some issues. Not with him. Charlie's a great guy. He's the voice-of-God on at least one TV station in every market. \"NOW! It's time for Eyewitness News at 11!\" He's that guy. Him I love, but I had problems with the station at the time.\n\nCharlie was the morning man on KHJ, Los Angeles. Once a great radio station, the guiding forces had recently been replaced by a martinet program director, Paul Drew, who sapped all the imagination and creativity out of the station.\n\nThey were running an on-air contest called Columbo, based on the popular TV character of the time. Charlie announced it was time to play the game and he would take the tenth call. I phoned in and what do you know, I was caller number ten. Using a pseudonym, I played the game. Here’s the result, recorded right off the air.\n\nWhat I said, for those who couldn't hear clearly was: \"Paul Drew for killing KHJ.\"\n\nAnd now... Charlie's side of the story.\n\nI asked him if he wouldn't mind sharing his remembrance of the incident. Here's what he more-than-graciously had to say:\n\nKen, I remember it well! The format script said I was supposed to say, \"Would you repeat that, please!\" The small pause you heard before I spoke again was me looking down the contest script for the next line! Think about it, the odds of being the correct caller in a market the size of LA are incredible! You pulled off a one of a kind prank! Classic!\n\nThanks, Charlie. Oh, I miss those days.\n\nThe most fun I ever had in radio\n\nA sort of follow-up to my post earlier this week on radio people getting together. Here’s another look back at my disc jockey career – when radio was great and I was passable. One thing that the industry was back then was FUN. Not so today certainly. And it’s a shame – both for the talent and the listeners.\n\nEverything was live and local. You were encouraged to show some personality. Most radio markets had two competing stations playing the exact some music. So the only way to really distinguish yourself was in the presentation. Who had the crazier DJ’s? Who had the wildest contests? Who staged the best concerts? Who had the sluttiest girls call the request line? (Oh wait, that was just for the jocks, not the listeners)\n\nYou don’t have that competition today when the same company owns both competing stations (and seven others in the market) and to save money, one guy voice-tracks shows for all of them, they air some syndicated service out of Saugus, California, and the slutty girls are just emailing rock bands.\n\nBut the 70s were sweet. The pay was crap, there was zero job security, you had to play “Billy Don’t Be a Hero” six times a night, you usually needed a penicillin shot, and half your annual salary was lost to apartment security deposits because you skipped town so often – but we made up for it in fun.\n\nAnd if I had to select the single MOST fun experience it would be the launch of KFMB-FM (B100) in March 1975.\n\nBobby Rich was hired to create an exciting FM Top 40 station for San Diego. SD was a tough market. There already was a juggernaut AM station – KCBQ, and FM rock had already failed once before with KSEA (a station I was on and helped kill).\n\nBut Bobby was a showman. He understood that you hire really talented people, give them all the support elements they need to succeed, and then just let them do their thing. The result was a cooking radio station that sounded like pure adrenaline mixed with laughing gas.\n\nAnd to set the tone right off the bat, Bobby devised the B100 Hours to kick off the format. Here’s Bobby himself, explaining the concept:\n\nGetting the station started I was looking for ways to promote the \"100\" with slogans, contests and other image branding. So having a 100 hour \"Boogie-a-thon\" with no commercials and giving away \"B-100 Dollar Bills\" every 100 minutes just worked.\n\nThe real magic came when we started bringing in guest dj's from all over the country for the party. It was a reunion of something that hadn't even happened yet. All of our talent was encouraged to invite jock buddies (like you did with Billy Pearl) who would want to \"play radio\" with our gang of wacko and wild Boogiemasters.\n\nOh, doing the math it turns out that is FOUR DAYS and FOUR HOURS. So that required much complicated back timing. To say nothing of the jocks being required to start each hour with the countup \"and this is hour 78 of 100 hours of Better Boogie\", etc.\n\nTapes of that insane weekend went viral in the radio industry. I still encounter people who say they have airchecks of me and Billy Pearl (at the time a jock for KHJ Los Angeles) on the air together, doing a limerick competition while we kept re-starting the record over and over.\n\nYou never knew who was going to be on the air at any hour, and often disc jockeys were paired off. I got to do an hour with the legendary Chuck Browning – maybe the most caustic human being that ever lived. Great jocks from all over the country would come in, sit down, and just blast. One or two were even sober.\n\nThe line-up was crazy. I was there all weekend. I’d work 8-9 PM, then come back and do 4-5 AM, 11-noon, 7-8 PM, etc. No one got any sleep.\n\nI recall doing a morning show with Rich Brother Robbin, and at the time there was a syndicated program going around that basically was a fantasy Woodstock. All these live performances from various albums were woven together as if this amazing rock festival actually took place. We did a mock version. Doing my Ed Sullivan impression, we hosted the Concert for Rock n’ Roll Heaven and played all these dead artists. What we lacked in taste we made up for in audacity.\n\nThe launch was a huge success. The entire town was talking about it. And within months B100 dethroned longtime stalwart, KCBQ.\n\nWould something like that work today? I bet it would. Just don’t ask me to work that 4-5 AM shift though, please.\n\nThis is a re-post from five years ago.\n\nMy favorite Disneyland story\n\nHere's another excerpt from my book, THE ME GENERATION... BY ME (GROWING UP IN THE '60s). It's loaded with photos and videos, and here's the best part -- If you want to buy the book, you can! Seriously! It's for sale! Just go here.\n\nBut for now it's 1964. We take a family trip to the Magic Kingdom.\n\nMy other grandmother, Nana Pearl, surprised me later that summer by saying, “Fuck!” You don’t expect to hear your dear sweet old world, refined grandmother scream, “FUCK!!!” And at Disneyland no less.\n\nThe family made a sojourn to the Magic Kingdom and took Nana Pearl with us. At the time she was probably in her mid-60s. No one knew the ages of their Jewish grandparents back then. They all came over from Europe or Russia and no one arrived with accurate documentation. If Cher had entered the country via Ellis Island she’d claim to be 36 today.\n\nBut Nana Pearl was a kick. Always full of life. Your basic strudel-baking furniture-cleaning grandmother but game for anything…except…\n\nThrill rides.\n\nSo at Disneyland she was not interested in any roller coasters. We found ourselves at the Matterhorn bobsleds and of course Corey and I wanted to go. My father suggested Nana Pearl join us. He told her it was just a nice lazy boat ride. Dad has a mischievous streak in him. Either that or he was getting back at her for grounding him one weekend in 1939. Anyway, Nana Pearl agrees to go.\n\nI’m in the back of the bobsled and Nana Pearl is in my lap. The sled slowly ascends up the center of the mountain. About halfway up she figures it out. That is when, for the first time ever, my grandmother dropped the F-bomb.\n\nThe bobsled begins hurtling down the mountain and all the while she is yelling, “I’m going to KILL him! If I ever get off of this damn thing I’m going to fucking KILL Clifford!” I didn’t help matters by laughing hysterically.\n\nI think she chased him through three Lands.\n\nMy favorite Disneyland ride at the time wasn’t a ride at all. It was the Monsanto House of the Future. You just walked through this ultra modern house made entirely of plastic. A plastic house might sound ridiculous but when they finally closed the exhibit in 1967 and tried to demolish it, the wrecking ball just bounced right off of it. The one day demolition took two weeks.\n\nAmong the House of the Future’s visionary features – an oven that cooked food within seconds not hours, a TV that hung like a framed picture on the wall, telephones that allowed you to see the other party, and the most unbelievable wonder of all – a toothbrush that was electric! You would just push a button and the bristles rotated all by themselves! I’m sorry, this was beyond science fiction.\n\nLike all kids, and probably adults too in 1964, we thought that by the year 2000 we’d all be living like the Jetsons. We’d all be flying around in space ships that folded into briefcases and even brushing our teeth without having to move our hands up and down.\n\nFriday Questions\n\nHappy Passover to those who observe Passover, or at least are invited to a Passover dinner. This is one of the Jewish holidays where you do eat. Meanwhile, here are this week’s Friday Questions for followers of all religions.\n\nELS starts us off:\n\nKen, you noted that Supergirl's ratings aren't so good... but that's on CBS. How would they compare if the show were on the CW? I keep thinking that CBS might bail on \"Supergirl\" and the CW would take it to complete their \"DC superheroes - every night!\" (or some such.) I know some shows have jumped networks... any idea if this is viable? (Yes, I definitely like \"Supergirl\" - I'm the one - and would like to see it remain on the air.)\n\nLast year when CBS was putting together its schedule there was a lot of talk about putting SUPERGIRL on the CW – for the reasons you mentioned. My understanding was that the production budget would be too high to justify for a CW show. There was also the element of SUPERGIRL’S theme (empowering women) that CBS really responded to.\n\nLook, SUPERGIRL got a huge sampling. The fact that ratings have continued to slip clearly suggests fans are not liking the storylines and direction of the show. My guess is that should SUPERGIRL get picked up for a second season there will be a major overhaul in the writing staff and creative direction of the show. I wouldn’t be surprised if Warner Brothers (the studio that produces the show) has to make a big presentation to CBS explaining just how they would fix it before the network gives them a pick-up.\n\nI too hope it comes back, but not in its present form.\n\nThe TV Guy has a CHEERS question.\n\nI've always wondered why Shelley Long didn't return to CHEERS until the 1993 finale, 6 years after her departure? Was she invited? Seems like it would've been organic enough for her to pop in during the 6th, 7th, or 8th season. Why the long absence?\n\nA couple of reasons. First: the show wanted to move on. That becomes harder to do when a beloved character from the past pops in from time to time to remind you how much you miss her. Also, everyone felt Diane’s return should be a BIG deal and what bigger deal than the series finale? I think it was the right decision. I also thank Shelley for agreeing to come back. She was not contractually obligated to do so.\n\nI have to say personally, that although I loved the Rebecca years, and Kirstie was a hoot, to me the Diane years were special. Having Shelley back for the final hurrah just made that last episode feel right. What do you guys all think?\n\nFrom VP81955:\n\nCould you discuss what a writing staff goes through this time of year, when series that have been renewed plan the next season's story arc (as \"Mom\" now is planning to do for season 4, though that show almost certainly was to have been brought back). I would think most series have long-range plans, both for the season arc and for individual episodes that aren't tied to an arc but can be shown at nearly any time during the season. And for a show that's renewed by the skin of its teeth, with writers making contingency plans, I'm sure the staff doesn't have its collective mind focused on future seasons.\n\nKnowing you’re already picked up for next year is a real luxury. Some shows handle it differently. A few will begin planning the overall arc and a few stories for the upcoming season. They may even assign script assignments to the staff during the hiatus. That way when they return the show has five or six scripts already.\n\nThe most organized show I ever saw was EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. Phil Rosenthal was a master showrunner. When ELR would wrap for the year, Phil had half of next season’s scripts ready to go. He was always a half a season ahead. I’m in awe.\n\nIn most cases, showrunners and staffs are so fried by the end of the season they just set it aside and go off on hiatus. They’ll worry about next year when they return. I’ve even seen shows that end with a cliffhanger and the showrunner has no idea how he’s going to resolve it. He’ll figure something out after the break.\n\nFor most of the long-running shows I’ve been on, we tabled any discussion of the following year until we reconvened after the hiatus. We were much likely to come up with good ideas when we were refreshed than plotting out a new season on fumes.\n\nblogward asks:\n\nA friend of mine is working on a production for BBC radio of 50 year-old+ scripts by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson of Steptoe (US Sanford) and Son, and Hancock's Half Hour using, obviously, actors unassociated with these iconic characters. How do you think would you feel (assuming the money was right) about a similar thing happening with yours and David's classic scripts? Are there certain actors you might prefer - or not?\n\nI think it would be interesting. It was great recently seeing different actors play the parts in my play, A OR B? Why not allow new actors to see what they can bring to various roles? It also makes it easier to go along with this if the money is right.\n\nWhat’s your Friday Question?\n\nStaffing season\n\nWe’re getting into staffing season – that musical chairs exercise where showrunners begin cobbling writing staffs together in the event that their shows will get picked up next month. It’s a nerve-wracking process for all concerned, but my heart especially goes out to young writers trying to land a spot.\n\nIt’s such a crapshoot. You could get on a network show that is cancelled after three episodes or be on a cable show that goes for three years. Or vice versa.\n\nHappily, I was on the other side for most of my career. I was the showrunner hiring the staff. And that’s not a piece of cake either because there are so many factors involved that you won’t know until you’re in the foxhole. You really have to take a flyer on these people.\n\nSo what do I look for? Well, first of all it depends on my needs and my budget. Ideally you look for writers who can give you good drafts and also are helpful in the room with jokes and story fixes. But the truth is there aren’t that many. Yes, there are a thousand writers out there but only a select few who can deliver the goods. So if I hear of one, or a team, I snatch them up immediately.\n\nFor the most part you’re offered writers who excel in one of area but are weak in another (e.g. good drafts but quiet in the room). So you have to decide your need. Do you have good room people already and need script help? Or are you covered with scripts but lack strong joke support?\n\nWhat is the sensibility of your show? If it's about the dating life of Millennials you should probably have some Millennials. If it's about a family you should have a few staff members who have families. I'd be an idiot to write a show about diverse characters without a lot of diversity in the room.\n\nPersonally, I always like to have several women on the staff -- regardless of the subject matter. I like their perspective and they keep me honest when writing women characters.\n\nAnd again, all of this is within the parameters of my budget.\n\nAnother HUGE factor is their personality. How well do they play with others? How much of a team player are they? Do they bathe?\n\nA showrunner once described staffing by saying, “Who would you want to be trapped in a VW with driving across the country?”\n\nYou spend way more time in the room with your writing staff than your family. You better all get along. And it’s not easy. Writers tend to be neurotic. They tend to be competitive. They tend to have big egos. And they tend to be insecure. Add to this constant deadline pressure and you have a recipe for TWELVE ANGRY MEN on a daily basis for ten months. So you do your best to find people who might (if you’re lucky) get along.\n\nThe truth is, when you have a good room it’s a fantastic place to be. Imagine spending twelve hours a day with bright interesting people who make you laugh constantly. There are worse ways of making a living and having top-flight actors perform your words for an audience of millions (or at least several thousands).\n\nBut there are sour apples who can take down a room. And in time they are weeded out. I think over the years I’ve worked with all of them. (And I say that fully aware that there are showrunners who are absolute nightmares too – in some cases far worse than any staff writer with an annoying idiosyncrasy.)\n\nHere are a few staff writer quirks that piss me off. And buyers beware. Showrunners should do their due diligence – talk to previous employers and read current first drafts (before the staff got ahold of them).\n\nThere’s always the writer that is constantly on their iPhone texting. Their eyes are never on the monitor displaying the script you’re working on. I'm not above saying put the fucking phone away.\n\nSimilarly, there’s the writer who gets fifty phone calls a day and is out of the room more than he's in.\n\nThere’s the grammar police. He or she has nothing to offer so they try to make themselves useful by picking at the grammar. “That should be a semi-colon.” Who gives a shit? That’s for proofing. For now I’m concentrating on the lines, not punctuation.\n\nYou have the person who wants to go back four pages. I usually want to kill this person. If you had a problem on page 16 and didn’t say anything and we’re now on page 30 we are not going back. I worked with an excellent writer who got fired off a first-class show because of that bad habit.\n\nAnd then there’s the person who sulks. Writing rule number one: Pitch something ONCE. If the showrunner says no, drop it. Do not pitch it again five minutes later. And do not SULK. I worked with a hilarious writer, one of the best room guys I’ve ever seen, but after a couple of years he was usually not asked back. It just wasn’t worth the sulking.\n\nMore than anything else, you need your staffers to project a positive outlook (even if they don’t believe it – which none of them do). There are enough negatives – temperamental actors, idiotic notes, network politics, production restrictions, working weekends, the Red Vines are all gone – that you have to fight to urge to give into that. Because if you do you’re buried.\n\nSo that’s the landscape. No one from either side knows what they’re getting into. And from that somehow great television is made. Again, best of luck to all concerned. May you wind up in the ideal situation for you.\n\nLittle Big Shots\n\nWhenever I go to a foreign country where I don’t speak the language (which is practically every foreign country), I love to turn on the TV in the hotel and find some bizarre local game or reality show. They always have a neon rainbow-colored set with a super manic host, insane bobblehead contestants, and a studio audience absolutely orgasmic – laughing, howling, cheering, whistling – going bonkers over every little thing that is said and done on stage. What are they guffawing at? Why are they applauding like crazy people? I walk out of the hotel and everyone on the street seems calm and normal but on TV they’re all Jerry Lewis.\n\nYes, I watch as a goof. It’s Pee Wee’s Playhouse with a studio audience of Mountain Dew addicts. But for all my dear foreign readers, please allow me to return the favor. For sheer frenetic idiocy, I invite you to come to the United States, check into a Holiday Inn, and watch LITTLE BIG SHOTS.\n\nThis is a new show on NBC that airs on Sunday nights and is quickly becoming a breakout hit. I weep for America.\n\nChild prodigies come out, are interviewed by Steve Harvey, and then perform their “talent.” All the while the studio audience is convulsing in laughter over every interview question and answer, and cheering every second during the performances. Most studio audiences in TV studios have applause signs. This one must have a “Come unglued and have a complete mental breakdown” sign. Again, what are they laughing at? Why are they applauding? At least the international shows speak foreign languages. But here it’s in English and I’m still completely befuddled.\n\nTalking to kids is not a new concept. Art Linkletter hosted KIDS SAY THE DARNDEST THINGS for years. Bill Cosby, when he wasn’t committing felonies, did the same thing. Both hosts were terrific at it. Steve Harvey is so impressed with himself that interacting with the kids is an intrusion. All he’s interested in is getting laughs – for himself. Linkletter and Cosby understood that they were straight men for the kids. When Harvey isn’t delivering a lame one-liner he’s mugging shamelessly, stealing every Richard Pryor expression he can remember. LITTLE BIG EGO.\n\nAnd the adorable cherubs are so precocious you want to hurl. These are truly every smug, stuck-up, teacher’s darling kid you ever loathed in elementary school. Yes, I know I’m a jaded old curmudgeon and the show’s a big hit so I’m clearly out-of-step, and who cares what I think anyway? I expect I’ll get some flack in the comments section. But Jesus! A little girl who yodels? A six-year-old who dances? A nine-year old torch singer? Am I the only one who finds the success of this utterly absurd? Remember when Arsenio hosted STAR SEARCH? It’s the same thing!!! No, it was better. No one watched that show. That’s what they get for not showcasing yodeling.\n\nI guess I shouldn’t be surprised. The six-year-old dancer was on because a YouTube video of her hoofing with her pregnant tattooed mother went viral and 36,000,000 people watched it. But that’s America. On any one night you can watch LITTLE BIG SHOTS and then THE GOOD WIFE. I don’t have to tell you which got the higher ratings.\n\n“Yodelayyyheeehooooooo.”\n\nRIP Doris Roberts\n\nSo sorry to hear that Doris Roberts has passed. What a great lady! I was surprised to learn that she was 90. I saw her just a few months ago and she looked the same as she did on EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. Hell, she looked the same as she did on REMINGTON STEELE. Or the 35 other TV series she co-starred in.\n\nI got to work with her when I directed EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. And I know her son, Michael. We hired him to be our Post Production Supervisor on BIG WAVE DAVE’S.\n\nIf I had to play word association with “Doris Roberts,” my response would be “Joe DiMaggio.” Why? Because Joltin’ Joe was not just one of the greatest players ever; he made it seem effortless.\n\nAnd that was Doris. She had impeccable comic timing and was given challenging material to do week after week, and yet she made it seem so easy, so natural, so – effortless.\n\nBut the truth is, her performance required hard work. To play a character who at times could be the antagonist and yet still be lovable is a major acting feat.\n\nThe key was that she played Marie Barone (and every character) “real.” Never an exaggeration, never a “sketch” – you loved Marie because you identified with her. That was your mother. Or your mother-in-law. Or you (although you’d never admit it).\n\nAnd not only did she avoid playing Marie too broad; she also avoided playing her too soft. Many actors fear being viewed as unlikable so they balk at having to play unsympathetic in any way. Doris went for the truth of the character in all situations, regardless. And you loved her even more for that.\n\nShe just inherently knew the correct level and pitch. As I was directing her I would think, “She’s forgotten more about acting than I’ll ever know.” That said she was lovely on the set. The pro’s pro. Always prepared, always knew her lines, always available to rehearse, always generous with the other actors, be they regular cast members or guest players.\n\nDoris Roberts’ IMDb page lists her as an actress in 158 projects. Many of them were series that she starred or co-starred in. She did 210 episodes of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND, 72 episodes of REMINGTON STEELE, 5 episodes of BARNEY MILLER, 36 episodes of ANGIE, 4 episodes of SOAP, not to mention tons of movies and guest appearances on comedies and dramas alike. She won 5 Emmys (4 for RAYMOND).\n\nOn television Doris Roberts will live another 90 years. I wish there was a way to retire her number. She was one of the all-time greats.\n\nWhen radio people get together\n\nWent to a “celebration of life” (which sounds so much better than a “memorial service”) on Saturday for legendary radio program director, Ron Jacobs. (Below is the video tribute to Ron.) My friend Kevin Gershan did a great job organizing this event and it was attended by many.\n\nI notice now that when radio people from the Golden Age (i.e. 20th Century) get together you can always expect the following:\n\nEveryone drops their voice an octave (even the women).\n\nEveryone still talks about drugs but now they’re for cholesterol.\n\nEveryone compares which stations they were fired from and how many times they were fired. (If it's less than six you weren't really in radio.)\n\nEveryone has kids (that they know about).\n\nEveryone wanted to work at KHJ.\n\nEveryone has worked at KRTH.\n\nEveryone has great stories. Maybe a third of them are true.\n\nEveryone hated Paul Drew (another radio program director).\n\nEveryone did the all-night shift at one time or another and still has the bags under their eyes.\n\nHalf the gathering had slept with the same girl. The other half slept with a different girl.\n\nEveryone secretly considers himself the “fifth Beatle.”\n\nNo one still goes by their real name.\n\nDiscussions always include how much hair we used to have.\n\nEveryone agrees that the Real Don Steele, Robert W. Morgan, Dan Ingram, Jackson Armstrong, and Larry Lujack were the best of the best.\n\nEveryone still talks-up records in their car and can still hit the post. (It’s my greatest talent.)\n\nEveryone misses the “competition” that went on back when two companies didn’t own every radio station in America. War was heaven.\n\nEveryone refuses to believe the ‘60s are over (despite the existence of mirrors).\n\nThey’re the only gatherings in the world where people bemoan the lack of jingles.\n\nEvery conversation begins with: “Whatever happened to…?” or “Do you know a good cardiologist?”\n\nSongs from the ‘80s are considered way too current to be classified as “oldies.”\n\nAnd finally, everyone agrees that their heyday in radio was the most fun time of their lives.\n\nAnother crazy \" Writers Assistant\" story\n\nNow they're called \"Writers Assistants\". Back in the ‘90s they were still called secretaries. We’ve had several that proved to be total loons. Sweet people but seriously bonkers.\n\nOne of the bat-shit craziest was Sally. This is when we had a development deal at Paramount. We had our own production company and the mandate was to sell pilots and get shows on the air.\n\nSally lived in a modest apartment in Brentwood, a half-hour drive to Paramount. One morning her pet parakeet got out of its cage, flew out the window, and perched in a nearby tree.\n\nWhen this happens, what do you do? Call the fire department? Yes, that’s what you or I or anyone sane might do. But not Sally.\n\nShe called the Paramount Special Effects department and ordered that two stuntmen to come out to her apartment to retrieve the bird.\n\nI got awoken by a call from the Special Effects department. They wanted my okay for this. How much would be charged against our production deal? $20,000. “Fuck no!” I said and told them to cancel the assignment.\n\nSally called me moments later, frantic because Paramount gave her the bad news. What was she going to do? This was essentially our conversation:\n\nME: Did you call the fire department?\n\nHER: Why would I call the fie department?\n\nME: To get your bird down.\n\nHER: There’s no fire.\n\nME: They also rescue animals. You’ve never heard of fireman raising ladders up against trees and saving cats?\n\nHER: This is a bird.\n\nME: So what?\n\nHER: Do they have nets?\n\nME: How would I know?\n\nHER: Well, how will they capture him?\n\nME: They’ll send up the Dalmatian. He’ll put it in his mouth. I don’t know.\n\nHER: Maybe I can pay some kids to climb the tree.\n\nME: Just call the fucking fire department!\n\nHER: Can I tell them I'm a producer.\n\nME: No!\n\nHER: But I want them to come here first.\n\nME: You think they go out on calls based on your status in Hollywood?\n\nHER: Well, maybe they're actors.\n\nME: So if they think you're a producer they'll recite a monologue from King Lear as they shimmy up the ladder?\n\nHER: Well how else can I get them to come here first?\n\nME: Tell him the bird is the Maltese Falcon.\n\nAfter that the conversation got weird. She eventually phoned the LAFD. The bird was rescued. It took all morning. And we got no work done. Hey, I’m just glad she didn’t call for the corporate jet to fly her the ten miles from Brentwood to Paramount in Hollywood.\n\nSally was one of our better secretaries by the way. So that gives you some idea.\n\nRe-posted from several years ago.\n\nFriday Questions\n\nThis is your last chance to see A OR B? at the Hatboro Village Theatre. Tonight and tomorrow. Be there or be square.\n\nWhen you ask a Friday Question I copy and paste it into a file and try to answer as many as I can. But a few I never get around to. And over time those have started piling up so today I’m going to dig deep and pull out some FQ’s that were asked some time ago. Sorry for the delay.\n\nErnie asked this in 1974:\n\nWhat qualities does your writing partner, David Isaacs, bring to your collaborative work that you have trouble doing or can't do; likewise, what do you bring to the partnership that David Isaacs doesn't do or doesn't do as well (i.e. what are some of your strengths and weaknesses both in your writing and in your business partnership)?\n\nMore than anything else it was our speed. Especially early on in our writing career, I would tend to go too fast and David would sometimes be too deliberate. He slowed me down and I sped him up until we reached a good working groove, which happy to say, we’re still in.\n\nBut in terms of story and joke ability, I think we were pretty even. Having a trusted partner just helped us both grow as writers much faster than we would have each working alone.\n\nSid asked this question in 1957:\n\nThere have been a few shows, such as Your Show of Shows, Caesar’s Hour, Smothers Brothers, etc. that were famous for their all-star cast of writers. But in all those instances, the writers were not famous when they were on the show. Rather, they became famous after the fact. To the best of your knowledge, has there ever been a program or project where someone attempted to assemble an all-star crew of comedy writers? (The analogy would be “It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World” with its all-star cast of performers.)\n\nI can’t speak for the current crop, but back in the ‘80s, ‘90s, and ‘00s All-Star line-ups of comedy writers were routinely assembled to help out on pilots. We would pitch in on rewrite nights of each other’s projects.\n\nThere were times when it was hard to believe I was there because I’d be in a room with Jim Brooks, the Charles Brothers, Sam Simon, Jerry Belson, David Lloyd, Harvey Miller, and Treva Silverman and think, “Holy shit, this is the ’27 Yankees.”\n\nOh, and did having that amazing collection of talent always result in the pilot being picked up? Uh, that would be no.\n\nJohnny Walker wondered this in 1985:\n\nIn the best Bar Wars episode (you know the one), I remember \"Monster Mash\" playing when Gary pranked the bar. It's a memory that's stayed with me since I was a kid -- it just seemed like the perfect song, and was SO funny. But unlike every other song used in Cheers (which is the same as it was when first broadcast), \"Monster Mash\" has been changed to cheaper sounding alternative for home video (even Netflix). Any idea why? It's maddening when I watch that episode. (Also, if the music wasn't played on set -- allowing them to switch it out, what did the audience react to?)\n\nI’m guessing it was just too expensive to get the rights. That song was on an independent label owned, I believe, by Gary Paxton, and the artist, Bobby Pickett, passed away several years ago. I don't know how complicated it was to secure permission. It's too bad, because that song was perfect.\n\nMark wondered this in 1947:\n\nIf you name drop an actor in a script do you contact them and ask if it's ok? The line \"Ted Danson and I went out that night and got smashed\" might tick off Ted Danson, right?\n\nYou’re allowed to mention celebrities since they are public figures. If you do so in a derogatory light you do run the risk of a defamation suit (although those are rare).\n\nBut let’s take Alan Alda for example. He has maybe the best marriage of any celebrity I know. He is a very faithful husband. If one of the girls on 2 BROKE GIRLS said she was having an affair with Alan Alda I could see where lawyers might be called. But if one of the characters just took a shot at Alan Alda's hair I don’t think litigation would result.\n\nIf in writing scripts we have any question as to whether a reference is acceptable we could always consult the studio legal department. We rarely did that because their knee jerk reaction was always “No!”\n\nMel Agar goes back to 1937 to ask:\n\nHave you ever written a show off only to \"rediscover\" it later and find it has found its stride? What shows do you feel have managed to do that recently?\n\nPARKS & RECREATION. And MOM.\n\nAnd finally, we go back to 1911 when Oliver asked:\n\nWhat do you think about comedies being ordered straight-to-series, skipping the pilot process?\n\nI wish it had happened to me. Actually, it did happen to me. THE MARY SHOW.\n\nGiving a series order is always a little risky and usually the network hedges its bet with either an A-list creator or coveted A-list talent. But it can backfire. THE MARY SHOW lasted 13. And who remembers the MICHAEL J. FOX SHOW?\n\nCable networks and streaming services are more willing to take that gamble, but they often dole out fewer episodes per order. Ten or sometimes six. I think the order for Michael J. Fox was 22. That was a big financial hit for NBC to take.\n\nWhat’s your Friday Question? I promise to get to it by 2057.\n\nMisc. Takes\n\nSome random thoughts for a Thursday...\n\nTuesday nights are not the same now that the O.J. verdict is in. Sarah Paulson has become my favorite working actress. Whether it’s a one-headed or two-headed character, she can play ‘em all.\n\nSorry to hear of David Gest’s passing, but is this the creepiest wedding photo you’ve ever seen?\n\nThe Stephen Colbert show already has a new showrunner. That can’t be good.\n\nCongrats to the Golden State Warriors, the best regular-season team in NBA history. 73-9. Of course now they have to play another 82 playoff games.\n\nConan O’Brien has been doing his shows from South Korea, obviously trying to capitalize on that MASH zeitgeist.\n\nFor the first week of the baseball season when it’s still snowing in the east, why don’t they schedule all the games in cities that have good weather or domes?\n\nNEW GIRL was renewed. No, seriously.\n\nBook recommendation: “Welcome to Dumbfuckistan: The Dumbed-Down, Disinformed, Dysfunctional, Disunited States of America” by Ian Gurvitz. Ian is a hilarious writer – sort of a cross between Andy Borowitz and Howard Beale. Among Ian’s many TV credits is BECKER. He wrote the best, angriest Becker rants of the series. You can get the book here.\n\nSo SUPERGIRL’S ratings went way up when The Flash guested then plunged right back down the following week. Look for a crossover show with Super Grover during May sweeps.\n\nWho’s having a big viewing party for this Sunday night’s TV LAND ICON AWARDS?\n\nThe Russian poem that David Isaacs and I wrote for a CHEERS episode made it to a gate arrival sign. I guess Virgin Air in SFO likes to spice up their gate announcements. This was seen recently:\n\nMy heart goes out to Atlanta Braves and Minnesota Twins fans.\n\nORPHAN BLACK returns tonight and is supposed to be good again. For the first few episodes they essentially do a prequel. Navajo Code Talkers couldn’t figure out the plot from last season.\n\nThe new CEO of AMC Theaters is experimenting with allowing texting at certain theaters. That'll be the last time I ever go to one of those theaters. Meanwhile, the most habitual moviegoers are not teens. They're the over-50 crowd. Maybe theater owners should maybe possibly want to cater to THEM.\n\nWhat a way to go out! Kobe Bryant scored 60 points last night in his final game in the NBA. Thanks for a great career, Kobe. It's a sad moment for Lakers fans although they're all secretly saying, \"Finally!\"\n\nEW Trend Watch: Capsule Episodes. Entire episodes devoted to one character of a series. Uh, this is nothing new. Ever see the “Hawkeye” episode of MASH or the “Maude Bares Her Soul” episode of MAUDE? TV did not begin in 2010.\n\nI’m about to go into a deep depression. Only one more episode of BETTER CALL SAUL left for the season. What will I do with my Monday nights and aluminum cape?\n\nAny chance I could get Sumner Redstone to adopt me? Or Kobe?\n\nWhen you have a show out of town\n\nBack from Philadelphia where my play, A OR B? is currently running at the neighboring Hatboro Village Theatre. A OR B? was originally presented at the Falcon Theatre in Los Angeles, but this was my first time seeing it with a different production in a different time zone.\n\nSo naturally I came down with a horrendous cold three days before the trip. I took massive doses of Vitamin C, C, Zinc, Airborne, and Oxcydilliccylieallan in preparation. The cold raged on but my astigmatism improved. For the flight I took a Zyrtec-D, which normally turns me into a human raisin. Not in a pressurized cabin it seems. From coast-to-coast my head felt like the final hour of DAS BOOT.\n\nMrs. L. and I arrived Thursday night and hopped a gypsy cab driven by Ali G. I always enjoy visiting Philadelphia. It's the home of Benjamin Franklin, Chubby Checker, and the Wing Bowl.\n\nStayed downtown at the Loew’s. Very nice hotel. Our room was on the 32nd foot with a spectacular view of the Amamark building. For many years no building in Philadelphia was allowed to be taller than William Penn’s hat. There is a statue of the P-Man atop City Hall. Our founding fathers didn’t want any of those glass monstrosity skyscrapers. But somebody must’ve paid off somebody else so now there’s a skyline. (City Hall is now the 16th tallest building in the city.)\n\nNote: There’s also a statue of Sylvester Stallone, but even if he was wearing a hat it would mean that no building could be higher than 5’ 1”.\n\nFriday was the Villanova parade. Over 60,000 converged on downtown to celebrate this year’s NCAA Men’s Collegiate Basketball Champs. More importantly, they are the only real winning team in Philadelphia. I saw a few people donned in Flyers, Eagles, and Phillies gear, but you’d have a better chance seeing someone in Bhutan wearing a ‘76ers jersey than you would in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Barnes Collection is the current thing to see. Dr. Barnes was a chemist who made a fortune inventing an anti-gonorrhea drug and used the money to amass a huge and impressive art collection along with vintage household items like locks and cookie cutters. They were all arranged very specifically in his house. When he died in 1951 he specified in his will that nothing in his house was ever to be touched in perpetuity. But like William Penn’s hat, that changed and the collection is now downtown. However, everything is set up exactly to-the-letter the way it was in his house. Who knew he had a gift shop in his house?\n\nThe weather was cold and cloudy on Friday. Swung by the Reading Terminal Market for lunch. This is a giant indoor market and food court featuring cheesesteaks, soft pretzels, Amish and soul food. Vendors included little Dutch girls and angry gangstas. I hear DiNic’s pulled pork sandwiches are great but never found them. It was a little like Calcutta in there. Long lines were everywhere, but one stretched almost to Scranton. It was for Beiler’s Donuts. You’d think the jelly donuts were filled with iPhones. I held off since I had a plane to catch in two days, and locals contend that Federal Donuts are even better.\n\nTook the SEPTA train out to Hatboro. We weren’t even settled in our seats when two imposing cops entered and dragged some stoner out of the car. Along the route we stopped at Temple University, where Bill Cosby got his Bachelor’s Degree even though he never finished his course load. It was bestowed on him because of “life experience.” We can only hope the courts bestow on him a \"life sentence.\"\n\nWe of course bought senior tickets and the conductor actually checked our ID's. Wow. That's like Cher still being carded at a liquor store.\n\nHatboro was the very definition of charm – meaning more antique stores than CVS’s. The Hatboro Village Theatre has been producing shows for 65 years (back when Cher really was being carded). The theatre has been refurbished and is gorgeous. Plush comfortable seats, great sight lines, and free coffee. (I’m told the free coffee was offered for all shows; not just mine to keep people awake.)\n\nThe performances of A OR B? were SENSATIONAL. The cast of Jen Newby & Ernie Albanesius crushed it, and top-to-bottom, from Gina Lutz’s direction, to the lighting, wardrobe, sound, person who brewed the coffee—everything, it was a first-class production. Lots and lots of laughs. It was odd for me to see a different version of my play, but I couldn’t be happier with the results. A OR B? runs one more weekend so if you’re in the area (i.e. anywhere on the east coast or Canada), swing by.\n\nSaturday morning it snowed. In April. No wonder Dick Clark and Chase Utley moved out of this town. Being from California I do not have “winter garb.” Not being used to cold weather (and being a princess) I wore six layers, a ski sweater, and jacket. People are walking around in windbreakers. I looked like Ralphie in THE CHRISTMAS STORY. Plus, I still had my cold. By then I was taking Extra Strength Flintstones Sudafed.\n\nWe took the train to Gwynedd Valley on Saturday to see some dear friends before the show. (Gwynedd needs two D’s?) Philadelphia has some great street names including Shackamaxon Street, Passyunk Avenue, Axe Factory Road, Tackawanna Street, Skidoo Street, Dunks Ferry Road, Moyamensing Avenue, Narcissus Road, and my personal favorite – Mario Lanza Boulevard.\n\nOn Saturday night after A OR B? I did a Q&A. I knew I wasn't in Los Angeles. Not one person asked how they could get an agent or if I could read their spec DR. KEN.\n\nIt’s always sunny in Philadelphia… on the day we leave. My thanks to Carol Leister and everyone at the Hatboro Village Theatre. I’m that much closer to Broadway! I figure, all I need is a venue on 42nd St., snow in June, and bronchitis and I’m in!"
