        "text": "The Aloha State\n\nToday marks the 65th anniversary of Hawaii becoming the 50th U.S. state, though it is really in a class of its own. The state consists of a chain of volcanic mountains that form eight major islands: Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Hawaii. It’s one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations, with a mild tropical climate and natural splendor often described as a paradise on Earth.\n\nBehind the Headlines\n\nThe price of gold hit an all-time high, while new research suggests that playing video games can reduce stress and promote well-being, contrary to popular belief.\n\nGolden age\n\nThe price of gold reached a new zenith on Friday, eclipsing $2,500 per troy ounce for the first time, making the standard gold bar, which weighs about 400 troy ounces, worth more than $1 million. Investing in gold has its pros and cons. The precious metal has had brief periods of huge gains in recent decades, but there were also long stretches when it was outperformed by U.S. stocks. During periods of economic turmoil, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, gold often outperforms the stock market.\n\nEli Lilly’s good news\n\nA long-term study of the weight-loss drug tirzepatide found that it dramatically reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in overweight adults. Tirzepatide is the key ingredient in Eli Lilly’s popular Zepbound weight-loss drug as well as its Mounjaro diabetes medication. The study’s release yesterday sent the company’s shares up nearly 3 percent and gave it a boost in its ongoing competition with rival Novo Nordisk.\n\nVideo game psychology\n\nPlaying video games may improve your mental health, according to research published this week in Nature Human Behaviour. The study looked at the gaming habits of more than 8,100 people with a PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch console and found that playing a few hours a day could improve the mental health of both individuals and families. But the research also found that those behavioral benefits drop off after three hours of play.\n\n© Shutter2U/stock.adobe.com"
