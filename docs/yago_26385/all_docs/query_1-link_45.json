        "text": "“REMEMBERING GENE WILDER” My rating: B+ (Netflix)\n\nGene Wilder and Zero Mostel in “The Producers”\n\n“REMEMBERING GENE WILDER” My rating: B+ (Netflix)\n\n92 minutes | No MPAA rating\n\nI’d almost forgotten what a wonderful performer Gene Wilder was.\n\nBut then I caught Ron Frank’s documentary “Remembering Gene Wilder” and it all came rushing back.\n\nThe film makes the case that Wilder was a comic genius…and given that he was the instigator of “Young Frankenstein” and wrote the original screenplay, you won’t hear me arguing.\n\nBut there’s so much more, from his first high-visibility gig as a kidnapped bank employee in “Bonnie and Clyde,” to his landmark work with Mel Brooks (“The Producers,” “Blazing Saddles,” “Young Frankenstein”), his comic collaborations with Richard Pryor and especially his turn as the star of “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.”\n\nHe appears to have been a very nice man, an impression reinforced by his two marriages (the first to Gilda Radner, who died from cancer).\n\nPlenty of colleagues and friends show up to share memories — Brooks, Alan Alda, Harry Connick Jr., Carol Kane, Eric McCormick — but the backbone of the piece are the clips from Wilder’s films. They’re so good you end up making a list of the man’s features that need to be revisited.\n\nIsabel Deroy-Olson, Lily Gladstone\n\n“FANCY DANCE” My rating: C+ (Apple+)\n\n90 minutes } MPAA rating: R\n\nPerhaps seven or eight years ago — pre-“Reservation Dogs” — Erica Tremblay’s “Fancy Dance” might have seemed like a revelation.\n\nNow it carries a whiff of been-there-done-that, an aroma not dispelled even by Lily Gladstone’s slow-burning lead performance.\n\nFilmed mostly on Indian land in Oklahoma, the film centers on Jax (Gladstone), who has become the caregiver for teenaged Roki (Isabel Deroy-Olson), her niece. Loki’s mom vanished a couple of weeks earlier.\n\nJax suspects foul play, but the indifferent authorities are dragging their feet; meanwhile she tries to keep Roki’s hopes up that the girl’s mom will appear in time for the mother/daughter dance at the upcoming tribal powwow.\n\nFor much of its running time “Fancy Dance” is a study of poverty and dead ends. Jax has a long history of trouble with the law and she’s already got Roki boosting needed food and other items from local merchants.\n\nNeed a ride? Steal a car. Pretty simple.\n\nThings come to a head when the child welfare people move to place Roki in foster care. An outraged Jax snatches the girl and together they go on the run.\n\nAs a snapshot of reservation life, “Fancy Dance” seems accurate if not exactly revelatory. Similarly, the theme of missing indigenous women isn’t exactly fresh, having been tackled in the most recent season of “True Detective” and in the striking feature “Catch the Fair One.”\n\nStill, you’ve got Gladstone, hot off her triumph in “Killers of the Flower Moon” and possessor of the saddest pair of eyes in current cinema. Even when the film loses momentum, her presence keeps us watching.\n\nMads Mikkelson\n\n“THE PROMISED LAND” My rating: B (Hulu)\n\n127 minutes | MPAA rating: R\n\nThe difference between actor and movie star is nicely delineated in the career of Mads Mikkelson, who appears to care not a whit about his image while always on the lookout for unexpected characters.\n\nViking berserker. Alcoholic high school teacher. James Bond villain. Drug pusher.\n\nThe guy doesn’t care if we like his characters. In fact, I often think he goes out of his way to glom onto the off-putting.\n\nIn the period piece “The Promised Land” Mikkelsen plays a highly fictionalized version of the real-life Ludvig Kahlen, who after 25 years as a soldier (rising from private to captain) retires to his native Denmark with a crazy dream of turning the barren Jutland heath into a paradise.\n\nKahlen is not a warm, fuzzy guy. He’s humorless. Stiff. Ill at ease in social situations. And so invested in the idea of achieving legitimacy through an agricultural miracle that he has no time for anything that might get in his way…especially other people.\n\nWritten and directed by Nikolaj Arcel, “The Promised Land” melds several genres to satisfying effect.\n\nThere’s the whole man-against-nature thing, with Kahlen battling the elements to survive brutal winters, improve the nutrient-poor soil and bring in a crop of potatoes, a vegetable at the time (mid-1700s) unknown to the Danes but capable of growing just about anywhere.\n\nEven more daunting is the opposition of local landowner Frederik De Schinkel (Simon Bennebjerg), the Danish equivalent of a Deep South plantation owner who rapes, beats and even kills the peasants under his thumb. (He’s a hateful prick…the model might very well have been Tim Roth’s arrogant sadist from “Rob Roy.”) De Schinkel is not thrilled with the idea of this plebeian newcomer improving the “unimprovable” land under his very nose, going so far as to form a marauding hit squad of murderers plucked from prison.\n\nFinally there’s the human side of the equation. Despite his loner personality, Kahlen slowly finds himself part of a makeshift family along with a housemaid who has fled De Schinkel’s predatory grasp (Amanda Collin) and an orphaned child (Melina Hagberg) reared by forest-dwelling bandits.\n\nSo what’s it going to be…stick with his master plan or succumb to the temptations of human interaction?\n\nTerrific cinematography (Rasmus Videbaek) and utterly convincing production design (Jette Lehmann) mark this intimate epic, which ends on a much more positive note than the one experienced by the real-life Kahlen…but then, that’s why we go to the movies.\n\n| Robert W. Butler\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAdria Arjona, Glen Powell\n\n“HIT MAN’ My rating: B (Netflix)\n\n115 minutes | MPAA rating: R\n\nAn old cliche of Hollywood movies had a nondescript wallflower undergoing a transformation into jaw-dropping beauty, usually with the leading man saying something like, “Why Miss Jones, I’ve never before seen you without your glasses.”\n\nSame thing happens in Richard Linklater’s “Hit Man,” which despite its title is not a noir-ish action piece but rather a romantic comedy (albeit one with subversive undertones).\n\nUndergoing the transformation here is a guy who evolves from dull, dweeby college instructor to…well, anybody he feels like being.\n\nGlen Powell — a 20-year acting veteran who recently became an “overnight” success thanks to “Top Gun: Maverick” and the Sidney Sweeney rom-com “Anyone But You” — seems to be having an absolutely wonderful time playing a dozen or so different characters.\n\nBased on the (mis)adventures of a real-life undercover police consultant, the film starts with teacher and gearhead Gary Johnson (Powell) setting up surveillance equipment for a very special team on the New Orleans P.D.\n\nThis squad specializes in sting operations; they spread the word that a hit man is available for hire, then arrest the morons who come to said assassin (actually an undercover cop) waving money for a murder.\n\nIs it entrapment? Maybe, but at least these are murders that never happen.\n\nWhen the dirtbag cop who usually plays the hit man is relieved of duty for some infraction, nerdy Gary is enticed to take his place.\n\nDespite an early case of nerves, it turns out Gary’s good at this. Before long he’s developed a small roster of alter egos, augmenting his appearance with fake teeth, contact lenses, wigs and a wardrobe that allows him to be everything from good ol’ boy to slick Eurotrash.\n\nThe moral dilemma at the heart of the screenplay (by Linklater, Powell and Skip Hollandsworth) arrives in the form of Madison (Adria Arjona), a young woman who wants to get rid of her insanely jealous husband.\n\nOf course, Gary is thinking what every man watching this movie is thinking: if I can talk her out of killing her husband maybe she’ll land in my lap.\n\nThis is, of course, an ethically and legally dubious choice. But what can I tell you? In his latest hit man persona Gary is friendly, confidant, cultured, attentive and romantic. And the vibes given off by Powell and Arjona when they share the screen are scorching.\n\nProblem is, Madison is still on the NOPD’s radar, and Gary will have to woo her while avoiding detection by his cop colleagues.\n\nThe mood here is lightly comic, then seriously romantic, and finally dourly cynical.\n\nIn any case, you’ve got to admire a film that sucks you in with a title like “Hit Man” and then never so much as waves a weapon, much less kills anybody.\n\n“THE EIGHT HUNDRED”My rating: B- (Prime)\n\n149 minutes | No MPAA rating\n\nInspiring equal parts awe and indifference, the Chinese “The Eight Hundred” is an epic war film made on a scale virtually unseen since the days of the ’60’s road show.\n\nA cast of thousands. Unbelievable battle scenes. A butt-numbing running time.\n\nDirector Hu Guan and his crew here take on a bit of history all but unknown in the West. But in China the 1937 siege of Shanghai’s Sihang Warehouse carries the kind of patriotic weight the Alamo does for Texans.\n\nHere’s the setup. Japan has invaded China and is advancing on Shanghai. Soldiers of China’s National Revolutionary Army hold the invaders at bay for three months. Now they’ve retreated to a multi-story warehouse on the banks of what appears to be a river (actually it is known as Suzhou Creek).\n\nBesieged by 20,000 Japanese troops, they are determined to fight to the last man.\n\nThe scale of this production is flabbergasting. The warehouse is just across the creek from the International Settlement, Shanghai’s “ghetto” for foreigners and a playground crammed with nightclubs, opium dens, movie palaces and bordellos.\n\nThe Settlement is off-limits to the Japaneses (they don’t want draw European powers into the fight by killing foreign citizens), and this allows the foreigners to go about their business and/or watch the fighting in relative safety.\n\nWeirder still, at night the Settlement is lit up like a carnival midway, an eye-dazzling magic kingdom just a few hundred yards from the carnage.\n\n“The Eight Hundred’s” battle scenes are like “Saving Private Ryan” on steroids. Astonishing. Everything from brutal hand-to-hand combat to strafing runs by Japanese airplanes.\n\nBut here’s the thing: The production is so bent on giving us the big picture that it never gives us the little picture. The characters — officers and fighting grunts, Western journalists covering the situation, decadent club owners, prostitutes, diplomats, everyday Chinese — have been boiled down to maybe one salient characteristic.\n\nMoreover, there are so many characters that none really have time to let their stories be told. (Things are even worse on the enemy’s end…the Japanese soldiers are essentially faceless versions of “Star Wars’” storm troopers.)\n\nSo in the end you’ve got a jaw-dropping spectacle for the eye and ear and a flag-waving paen to bravery, but a dead end in terms of personal human drama.\n\nWell, sometimes you just take what you can get. And there’s no arguing with the numbers…”The Eight Hundred” earned $484.2 million in its initial theatrical release. making it the second highest-grossing film of 2020.\n\n| Robert W. Butler\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nHolliday Grainger, Callum Turner\n\n“THE CAPTURE” (Peacock):\n\n“Torn from the headlines” doesn’t begin to cover the relevancy of “The Capture,” a Brit thriller that takes our current unease about artificial intelligence and pumps it up to paranoia-inducing levels.\n\nAt its heart this series from creator Ben Chanon asks if we can still believe our own eyes.\n\nHint: We can’t.\n\nHolliday Grainger (she played the Girl Friday in the detective series “C.B. Strike”) stars as Rachel Carey, a police inspector investigating the case of a missing human rights attorney.\n\nSurveillance cameras have captured footage of the woman being beaten by her most recent client (Callum Turner). But the suspect says — video footage notwithstanding — it never happened. He’s being framed.\n\nDetective Carey smells a rat. And over the course of the two seasons she will uncover a government conspiracy to use deep fake videos to create “evidence” where none exists.\n\nIt gets even more alarming in Season Two, when Britain’s head of security (Paapa Essiedu) submits to a live TV interview only to find that even as they are being broadcast his voice and image are being altered so that he appears to be embracing politically fatal positions.\n\n“The Capture” has been impeccably cast and acted (Ron Perlman is wonderful as a cynical CIA overlord with a finger in everybody’s pie), but its real power is that of a wakeup call.\n\nLondon has more public surveillance cameras than any city on Earth, and from their monitor-lined bunkers the spooks can follow a citizen’s every move. The shadowy figures behind all this are determined to keep their secrets, and murder is always an option.\n\nYou can tell yourself that this is only a TV show. Except that everything we see in “The Capture” is technically possible. And when you can’t believe your own eyes, is there such a thing as the truth?\n\n“ERIC”(Netflix):\n\nGenerally speaking, I’ll watch Benedict Cumberbatch in anything.\n\n“Eric,” though, may make me reassess my position.\n\nIt’s not that Cumberbatch is bad here. But he plays a terrible person so effectively that it’s like gargling ground glass.\n\nAn even bigger problem is that series creator Abi Morgan (her writing credits include\n\nsuch stellar efforts as “Brick Lane,” “Shame” and *Suffragette”) wants the show to be all things to all people and in the end it ends up being about nothing in particular.\n\nWell, that’s not quite true. “Eric” is definitely about contrivance and overkill.\n\nSuperficially, at least, this is the tale of a missing child. Ten-year old Edgar Anderson (Ivan Morris Howe) vanishes on his morning walk to his school in NYC.\n\nHis father, Vincent (Cumberbatch) is a puppeteer and creator of a “Sesame Street”-type kiddie’s TV show. He’s also egotistical, alcoholic, angry and far better delivering morals to a TV audience than at dealing with his own son’s insecurities.\n\nMother Cassie (Gabby Hoffmann) is a writer having an affair with a young guy who works for a mobile soup kitchen.\n\nThe family situation is blisteringly toxic, a fact immediately clear to Detective Ledroit (McKinley Belcher III) of the missing persons bureau. He wonders if the smugly arrogant Vincent might not have had a hand in the boy’s disappearance. Another possibility is the building’s super (Clarke Peters), in whose basement apartment young Edgar often took refuge from his parents’ emotional brawling.\n\nNow a missing child s compelling on its own, but writer Morgan keeps stuffing the ballot box.\n\nLedroit is a closeted gay man whose lover is dying of AIDS (the time is the mid-1980s, when most people were fearful of even touching someone HIV positive). And he has an ex-lover who is running a “Studio 54”-type nightclub that may be a front for child sex slavery.\n\nOh, and did I mention that Ledroit is black and dealing with racism on the force?\n\nHe’s also faced with a couple of crooked vice cops who may be responsible for the vanishing of another teenage boy.\n\nAnd there’s a huge chunk of the film set in the subterranean world of homeless subway dwellers — sorta like that old TV show “Beauty and the Beast.” Not to mention all the shots taken at politicians who want to drive off the undesirables to make way for high-rise condos. (Vincent’s estranged father is a Trump-ish real estate developer.)\n\nWell, that’s a whole load of issues for one movie to carry, but the biggest is yet to come.\n\nIt seems that little Edgar was secretly designing a new character for his father’s TV show, a big hulking mass of blue hair and horns he dubbed Eric. Eric looks like one of the creatures from Where the Wild Things Are, and becomes an imaginary friend to the booze-and-drug-addled Vincent. Now the movie becomes a fantasy/psychodrama about a guy and his monstrous alter ego wandering Manhattan in search of the missing child.\n\nI stuck with “Eric” simply because I could not believe the avalanche of overkill the show keeps dealing in whopping shovelfuls. Even the song choices playing underneath scenes are criminally heavy-handed (Lou Reed singing “Heroin” for a sequence featuring drug abuse?).\n\nBeing this audaciously wrong is actually kind of fascinating.\n\n| Robert W.
