        "text": "A recurring theme in Foyle's War is profiteering by those in communities (or in responsible positions) who are undermining the war effort. In this one we have a couple of entities at work. Most prominent are pair of guys who are working in a shipyard who are facing the creation of a union. Foyle is sent by his superiors to watch closely the activities of these \"communists.\" We come to realize that things aren't so simple as they seem. There are others in the community who are playing fast and loose with war products. The fun thing is the adversarial relationship between Foyle and his boss. Foyle is a common sense person and sees the stupidity in people but has to pull it back frequently."
