Playing the loving—but drug-addicted—grandfather brought Arkin well-deserved attention, but it was just one of many memorable roles he portrayed over the years. He believed that many of his characters were similar to him by the nature of the craft. He told Salem Alaton of the Globe and Mail, \"What attracts me [to acting] is not the glamour, not the burying yourself in other people, or the pretending to bury yourself in other people. Because I never do, anyway. It's always me. No matter how far away from it you think you're getting, it's always 95 percent you.\"\n\nBorn in 1934 in Brooklyn, New York, Arkin was the son of two teachers, David and Beatrice Arkin. His father was also an artist. Arkin knew he wanted to be an actor by the time he was five years old. He studied acting from an early age, wherever he could. By the time he was eleven years old, the family had moved to Los Angeles where his father hoped to find work as a scenery painter for films. As Arkin reached middle school, he also developed an interest in music and taught himself to play guitar. He made extra money by playing in social clubs as he got older, though acting remained his primary interest. After studying drama at Los Angeles City College and Los Angeles State College in the early 1950s, Arkin returned to the east, attending Bennington College for a few years.\n\nAfter leaving school, Arkin focused on music for a time by joining a band called the Tarriers. The folk group soon had chart-topping hit songs such as \"Cindy, Oh Cindy\" and \"The Banana Boat Song.\" The success of the Tarriers in the late 1950s allowed Arkin to return to acting, though his career did not take off right away. Arkin began his acting career on stage. After an early singing role in Heloise in New York City in 1958, then working with the St. Louis, Missouri-based improvisational Compass Players in 1959, Arkin decided he needed training in acting.\n\nTo that end, he went to Chicago. Arkin studied improv at Second City and became a member of the original Second City comedy troupe. Arkin learned much from the experience. He told Anna Quindlen of the New York Times, \"I took the Second City job because I was failing in New York. I couldn't get arrested. When I got there I wasn't funny at all. But slowly I built one character, then another, and the audience helped teach me what was funny and what didn't work.\"\n\nArkin returned to the New York stage with the Second City revue From the Second City in 1961–62. He soon became a star on Broadway with his work in the 1963 production of Enter Laughing at the Henry Miller Theatre and the 1964 production of Luv at the Booth Theatre. He won a Tony Award for Enter Laughing. Arkin then began focusing on film, though he also did a few guest spots on series like East Side/West Side and The Les Crane Show.\n\nArkin's feature acting career took off in 1966 with an appearance in the comedy The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! which led to an Academy Award nomination. Some of his roles were dark as he played a cold-hearted villain who terrorizes a character played by Audrey Hepburn in 1967's Wait Until Dark. Another early memorable role was playing deaf-mute John Singer in the 1968 film The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, which also garnered Arkin an Oscar nomination. That same year, he played the title role in Inspector Clouseau. The following year, Arkin played Puerto Rican Abraham Rodriguez, the father in Popi. His film career temporarily stalled after he appeared in a box office bomb, the 1970 adaptation of the Joseph Heller novel, Catch-22.\n\nWhile Arkin continued to appear in films, he also began directing stage productions, finding it more satisfying than acting on stage. Arkin's directorial debut came in 1967 with Eh?, which he did under the pseudonym Roger Short. At the time, the Off-Broadway production was struggling, though it did star a young Dustin Hoffman. Arkin turned the production around and made it a success. Through 1976, Arkin directed at least ten plays in the Northeast, including New York productions of The Sunshine Boys in 1972 and Molly in 1973. His direction of the Off-Broadway production of The White House Murder Case in 1970 won him an Obie Award.\n\nArkin occasionally worked in television in the 1970s, though the medium was not one he particularly favored unless the role was interesting. In 1970, he began a two-year run on the popular children's series Sesame Street as Larry. When his film career briefly slowed down, he appeared in several television movies, including It Couldn't Happen to a Nicer Guy in 1974, as well as The Other Side of Hell and The Defection of Simas Kurdirka, both airing in 1978. Referring to the latter movies, Arkin told the New York Times' Quindlen, \"My agent warned me about doing the two of them because he thought it would kill my movie career. I talked to my family and I finally told my agent if doing terrific work and making terrific money is giving up something, I'll take it.\"\n\nArkin's film career rebounded in the late 1970s. In 1979, he starred in the comedy The In-Laws opposite Peter Falk. Arkin played a dentist whose life is turned upside down after he becomes engaged to the daughter of a scheming government agent, played by Falk, who is trying to steal U.S. currency engraving plates and sell them. Arkin's character was dragged into the mess. The film remained popular among comedy fans for years after its release. For Joshua Then and Now, released in 1985, Arkin received praise from critics and audiences for his acting work. In this film, which was based on a novel by Mordecai Richler, he played Reuben, the petty crook father of the titular character, a writer.\n\nWhile his film career was again going strong, Arkin returned to stage directing several times in the mid-1980s. In 1986, for example, he directed a production of the farce Room Service at the Roundabout Theatre in New York City. Originally produced in 1937, the play focuses on a fly-by-night producer who scams his way into ensuring that his production stays open and his cast has a hotel to stay at in the White Way. The production also featured the stage debut of Arkin's son, Tony, the product of his second marriage to actress-writer Barbara Dana.\n\nArkin also appeared in a cluster of television series, plays, and movies in the mid- to late 1980s. In addition to appearing in a PBS production of A Matter of Principle, which aired on American Playhouse in 1984, he played Harold Kaufman in 1986's A Deadly Business. The television movie aired on CBS and focused on toxic waste.\n\nIn addition, Arkin continued to write and publish books, something he had been doing for many years. While a struggling stage actor in the late 1950s, he had contributed science fiction stories to Galaxy magazine. Arkin penned a number of children's books between acting gigs, including Some Fine Grampa!, which was inspired by his granddaughter, Molly. He also continued to make music and lectured on creativity at various universities.\n\nBy this point in his career, Arkin was selective about the roles he would take no matter what the genre. Time with family and having downtime were important to him as he reached his sixties. Despite wanting to slow down, he continued to take on quality film roles. In the early 1990s, he appeared in Edward Scissorhands, Glengarry Glen Ross, and Indian Summer. Arkin's work as a failing salesman in Glengarry Glen Ross was particularly acclaimed by critics.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, he continued to challenge himself by taking on a variety of film roles, including a memorable turn as a villain in 1996's Mother Night. Arkin also had a featured role in the 1998 independent hit The Slums of Beverly Hills. Arkin played Murray Abromowitz, a single father of three teenagers, in this coming-of-age story. The film focuses his character's daughter reaching maturity while growing up on the poor side of the wealthy Los Angeles suburb in 1976.\n\nAlthough Arkin said he would not do stage acting again because of its demands and his own lack of interest, he took on one challenge in 1998. His appearance in the play he wrote, \"Virtual Reality,\" as part of Power Plays, was his first role since 1972's The Opening. Arkin also directed the three humorous one-acts that made up Power Plays and received much critical praise for his three contributions to the production. He directed another play in 2000, Taller Than a Dwarf, as well.\n\nArkin's film career became limited again in the early 2000s. While doing the occasional mainstream film, he primarily appeared in indies like 13 Conversations About One Thing in 2001 and Eros in 2004. Ar-kin also did more television, including a ten-episode stint on the series 100 Centre Street in 2001 and television movies The Pentagon Papers and And Starring Pancho Villa As Himself, both in 2003.\n\nArkin saw his career reach a new high with his role as the heroin- and porn-addicted grandfather in the dark family comedy/road flick Little Miss Sunshine in 2006. His character trained his granddaughter, Olive Hoover, as she prepared to compete in a kiddie beauty pageant. While Arkin's Edwin Hoover, aka Grandpa, died during the course of the film, his legacy continued to its end. Arkin's work in Little Miss Sunshine was widely praised, regarded as perhaps the best performance in the film. This opinion was emphasized when Arkin won his first Oscar as best supporting actor. According to Sheigh Crabtree of the Los Angeles Times, in his acceptance speech Arkin said, \"More than anything, I'm deeply moved by the open-hearted appreciation our small film has received, which in these fragmented times speaks so openly of the possibility of innocence, growth, and connection.\"\n\nLanding more plum film roles, including the role of Chief in the big-screen version of the 1960s television program Get Smart, Arkin remained philosophical about his life, varied career, and self-definition. He told David Sterritt of the Christian Science Monitor, \"We set limits on what we can think about and what we're capable of doing…. But that's a self-definition. It has nothing to do with who you really are. I'm interested in finding out someday what I really am. I believe strongly there is something within each of us that goes way past what our vision is—something infinitely more exciting than what we conceive ourselves to be.\"\n\nSelected writings\n\nChildren's books\n\nTony's Hard Work Day, Harper (New York City), 1972; rev. ed., Gibbs Smith (Salt Lake City, UT), 2002.\n\nThe Lemming Condition, Harper, 1976.\n\nThe Clearing, Harper and Row (New York City), 1986.\n\nSome Fine Grampa!, HarperCollins (New York City), 1995.\n\nOne Present from Flekman's, HarperCollins, 1999.\n\nCassie Loves Beethoven, Hyperion (New York City), 2000.\n\nCosmo: A Cautionary Tale, Azro Press (Santa Fe, NM), 2005.\n\nNonfiction\n\nHalfway Through the Door: An Actor's Journey Toward Self, Harper and Row (New York City), 1979.\n\nHalfway Through the Door: First Steps on the Path Toward Enlightenment, Harper and Row, 1984.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nContem porary Theatre, Film and Television, vol. 39, Gale Group (Detroit, MI), 2002.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nChicago Sun-Times, April 26, 1993, sec. 2, p. 4.\n\nChristian Science Monitor, July 8, 1986, p. 1.\n\nGlobe and Mail (Canada), September 5, 1985.\n\nLos Angeles Times, February 26, 2007, p.

Think of Lemmon's major film roles, from It Should Happen to You to The Apartment, Save the Tiger to Missing. Arkin could have played any one of these parts effectively. Both actors can play comical bumblers with serious sides, and both excel as sensitive characters whose nervous temperaments are hair-triggered. Considering Arkin's solid talent and his proven versatility, it is regrettable that this actor has not had Lemmon's opportunities to shine on the silver screen.\n\nArkin was no novice to acting when he made his feature film debut in the popular satirical comedy The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming. Three years prior to that, he had won a Tony Award for his much acclaimed starring role in the Broadway production of Carl Reiner's autobiographical seriocomedy Enter Laughing. In Russians, Arkin, co-starring with Reiner and a large star cast, won an Oscar nomination playing a zany Russian squad leader who steps off a Soviet submarine which accidentally has been grounded near an island off the Massachusetts coastline. As he communicated with the startled natives, Arkin spoke a blend of strange Russian lingo and broken Russian-English, which left a bizarre, but very comical, impression.\n\nHis next effort, Wait until Dark, was a very showy role for the newcomer. In this taut suspense film, he played a psychotic who dresses up as three different people in order to retrieve a cache of drugs unwittingly in the possession of a blind woman (Audrey Hepburn). His menacing leap at the helpless woman's ankles and the unrelieved wickedness of his character even in his death throes gave audiences the dark and dramatic side of the actor's repertoire. After his appearance the following year in The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, as a lonesome deaf-mute who befriends a young girl, it seemed as though Arkin's new status as a major movie star was cemented. So moving was his portrayal that he received his second Academy Award nomination.\n\nSince then, only a handful of important screen roles have come his way. The most significant of these was in Catch-22, where he played Captain Yossarian in Joseph Heller's scathing satire of U.S. Army life during World War II, which was presented in a surreal and absurdist style. He also gave outstanding comic performances in The Last of the Red Hot Lovers and The In-Laws, and made an interesting and credible Freud in The Seven-Per-Cent Solution. In fact, Arkin never has done poorly in a film, even when the material was flawed or forgettable. Yet he has been unable to sustain the stardom and attention he obtained so early; the multidimensional, extraordinary roles with which he began his film acting career inexplicably dried up.\n\nArkin turned to directing in the late 1960s, and in 1971 did a credible job bringing Jules Feiffer's Little Murders to the screen. In the 1970s, he also wrote several books, including an autobiographical work about his involvement with yoga. In the past few years, Arkin has been appearing in films on a steady basis, sometimes enriching mediocre movies with brief but sparkling appearances. His two most significant recent roles have been as the camp director in Indian Summer and a real estate salesman in Glengarry Glen Ross, the film version of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, in which he shares screen time with Jack Lemmon. Nevertheless, it is a shame that an actor of Arkin's caliber has not, over the years, been offered more and better lead roles, and been allowed to fulfill the promise he exhibited in his earliest films.\n\n—Doug Tomlinson, updated by Audrey E.
