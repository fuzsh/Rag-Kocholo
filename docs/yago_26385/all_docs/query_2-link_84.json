        "text": "Shark attacks on humans are still very rare — only about 70 per year.\n\nThey are still less common than lightning strikes (270 cases per year) or drowning deaths (320,000 deaths per year).\n\nAnd sharks are still an endangered species. Still more afraid of you than you are of them.\n\nBut if there's one animal more prone to feeding frenzy than sharks, it's media. And reports of shark attacks in Florida, Texas and Hawaii this summer, along with increased sightings of sharks in waters not usually thought of as their playgrounds — including New Jersey — may have made some beachgoers nervous.\n\nWhat's needed is a shark repellent. And Nathan Garrison of the California company Sharkbanz believes he has one.\n\n\"It's not 100% guaranteed,\" he said. \"It's not like some magic force field. Think of it as a safety device, like a seat belt or a bike light. It helps reduce your chances of an unwanted shark encounter.\"\n\nA band of protection against shark attacks\n\nSharkbanz, the product he invented and developed, are worn around the wrists or ankles. The bands weigh 2 to 6.5 ounces, depending on the type. And they produce, Garrison says, a powerful magnetic field that disrupts the sharks' electroperception — their chief means of homing in on prey. In essence, it scrambles their reception.\n\n\"Sharks and stingrays are unique in the animal kingdom in that they actually have a sensory organ that can detect electricity,\" Garrison said. Ampullae of Lorenzini are the sensory pores, in their snouts, that help them monitor their environment.\n\n\"Sharks are using this electrical sense to hunt and navigate, and they're always aware of the earth's magnetic field,\" he said.\n\nThe powerful, localized magnetic field created by Sharkbanz introduces an anomaly into the shark's environment, he said. \"It will sense a large magnetic field beyond anything it would naturally encounter in the wild,\" Garrison said. \"As a result, it can be startled by that field. It's like a bright light shining in a dark room. It makes you turn away because it's unpleasant.\"\n\nIt doesn't harm the shark, or any other animal, he said. But there's a good chance it will send the apex predator on its merry way. \"What's cool is that you're essentially turning the shark's most powerful sense against them,\" Garrison said.\n\nThe experts weigh in on Sharkbanz\n\nCould such a thing really work? Some experts have been cool to the idea. \"Gimmick,\" said Toby Daly Engel, an associate professor at the Florida Institute of Technology and director of its Shark Conservation Lab.\n\nBut others are more enthusiastic. \"The theory behind their deterrent is reasonable,\" said marine biologist David McGuire, founder and director of Shark Stewards, a shark conservation and research organization based in Berkeley, California.\n\n\"Their research is pretty good, pretty compelling,\" he said. \"They're doing their due diligence. Real world, it's difficult to determine the effectiveness, because sharks are not always predictable. But if people want to reduce the risk, or if it acts as a placebo to make them feel better, that's fine.\"\n\nSuch a deterrent, he said, might work best on, say, a nosing sand tiger shark, or blacktip reef shark. \"They tend to investigate,\" McGuire said. A charging great white, in ambush mode, is a different matter.\n\n\"They're moving so fast, they're not using their electromagnetic sense,\" he said. \"These are wild animals, and when they're hunting, all bets are off.\"\n\nSharkmania lives on\n\nThanks to Discovery's \"Shark Week,\" the \"Jaws\" movies, and pop phenomena like \"Baby Shark\" and \"Sharknado,\" sharks are certainly more present in our imaginations these days. Are they more present in our waters?\n\nIn fact, yes, McGuire said. And yes, climate change is the main culprit. As the waters heat up, sharks are moving north to find their sweet spot. They're also following their prey, which are doing likewise. So they're being spotted more frequently in northern waters. \"A lot of their movements are toward the poles, like many species,\" said McGuire, who teaches marine policy at the College of Marin.\n\nThe presence of sharks in the water is actually a sign of the ocean's health, he points out. But that's probably cold comfort to the average New Jersey vacationer. Could a device like Sharkbanz offer peace of mind?\n\nGarrison points out that 10 years of research and experimentation have gone into his product. It has has won raves from surfers and Navy SEALS. And it's endorsed by pro surfer Bethany Hamilton, who lost her left arm to a shark in 2003.\n\n\"The genesis came because we had a very close family friend who was attacked by a shark when I was about 19,\" said Garrison, originally from Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n\"He was surfing off of Folly Beach in Charleston, and this bull shark came up beneath him and it bit him on the ankle, pulled him off the board and underwater,\" he said. \"It was a pretty gnarly injury.\"\n\nHis friend, luckily, made a full recovery. But when Garrison, himself a surfer, moved to the Santa Barbara area, there were several shark fatalities near where he was catching waves.\n\n\"That rattled me as well,\" he said. \"One of the people who was killed was a 23-year-old who lived on my street. The threat and reality was, this was possible. I couldn't believe there wasn't something to make me a little less likely to be attacked. If there was, I would want to wear it. And if I did, why wouldn't others want to wear it, too?\"\n\nMore than one way to skin a shark\n\nThe use of electrical impulses to deter sharks is a new approach to an old problem. The search for a shark repellent, like the search for a better mousetrap, has a long history.\n\nHitherto, most solutions have fallen into two categories. One is mesh shark suits. \"That's like chain mail,\" McGuire said.\n\nThe other is a chemical deterrent. Dyes. Bad smells. The Navy experimented with dumping such things into shark-infested waters during World War II. Among the experts asked to cook something up: Julia Child, no less. No word of whether she served it with a fine Bordeaux.\n\n\"It's been used for shipwrecks, that kind of thing,\" McGuire said. \"The problem with that is it doesn't stick around. It dissipates.\"\n\nIn any case, it's no solution for a swimmer in Seaside Heights or Wildwood. Something like Sharkbanz is more practical. Well, depending.\n\n\"If you're a marathon swimmer that is going to have thousands of repeat strokes, then you don’t want that weight at the end of your arm,\" McGuire said. \"If you're a surfer, just taking a few strokes at a time to catch a wave, that's different.\"\n\nTen tips for avoiding a shark attack\n\nUse the Buddy System or recreate in groups. Avoid swimming, snorkeling or surfing alone. Sharks are more likely to attack when there is only one person in the water.\n\nAvoid activity in areas with poor water visibility, such as near river mouths or after periods of heavy rainfall.\n\nDon’t wear shiny objects like necklaces, earrings or watches. The glint from metal jewelry may resemble a fish or its scales, and attract curious sharks.\n\nDon’t splash or make erratic motions that might alert a shark.\n\nAvoid water activity during dawn and dusk, when large sharks, like tiger sharks, are active.\n\nStay away from prey like seals, sea turtles and large schools of fish. Sharks often hunt in large schools, and federal law requires maintaining distance from marine mammals and sea turtles.\n\nDo not enter the water where active fishing is occurring, or where bait or other attractants are used.\n\nHighly contrasting swimwear may attract sharks. Sharks rely on their vision to hunt, and bright bands or contrasting colors can draw their attention. Wetsuits provide protection, and camouflage wetsuits help spearfishermen blend in with the background.\n\nSwim close to shore. Many sharks hunt along or inhabit the reefs' edge or drop-offs. Recreating near shore has the added advantage of a quick rescue in the event of an encounter.\n\nRead the signs and respect the locals. Local people know when and where to enter the water, and they are aware of recent sightings.\n\nWhat to do if you see a shark\n\nIf you see a shark while in the water, keep eyes on the shark and back away slowly. Call for help and warn others as you retreat.\n\nDo not make erratic motions or sudden splashing. This can attract a shark.\n\nTry to maintain eye contact by rotating with the shark. If you have a buddy, close up and watch the shark while retreating to shallow water or your boat.\n\nIf surfing, warn others and point the board at the shark while backing away. Attempt to catch the first wave into shore.\n\nTell lifeguards or other public safety officials and warn others on the beach that you saw a shark.\n\nCourtesy of Shark Stewards"
