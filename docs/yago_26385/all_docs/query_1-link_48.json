segregated South.\n\n-\"Great White Father of the Year\"!\n\n-Whoo!\n\n-Whoo!\n\n-Something about Purlie always did irritate the white folks.\n\n-This is down South.\n\nDown here, they go to school together over me and Gitlow's dead body!\n\nRight, Git?\n\n-You're the boss, boss.\n\n-Join us for the critically acclaimed revival of Ossie Davis' groundbreaking play.\n\n-Tonight, my friends, I find in being black a thing of beauty.\n\n[ Applause ] -Being colored can be lot of fun when ain't nobody looking.\n\n-Husband Harris... -Horace!\n\n-...Horace was already dead from heart troubles.\n\n-Gunshot wound!\n\n-His heart stopped beating, didn't it?!\n\n-\"Purlie Victorious\" starts right now.\n\n♪♪ Major funding for \"Great Performances\" is provided by... ...and by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you.\n\nThank you.\n\n-Hello, hello, hello.\n\nWelcome to the Music Box.\n\nI'm Kenny Leon, and I am the director of the show that you're about to see.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ] This play was first performed in 1961, and there's not been another commercial production for 62 years.\n\nThis play started out as a drama and turned into this outrageous comedy, somewhere between rage and hope.\n\nIf you lean forward just a little bit, if you lean into it, you're gonna get everything.\n\nYou're gonna laugh.\n\nYou're gonna think.\n\nYou're gonna cry.\n\nYou're gonna get all of that.\n\nSo, just lean into it.\n\nAnd right now, while I'm thinking about it, take out your cellphones and turn them off.\n\nYou won't need it.\n\nI promise you.\n\nAt the end of the show, if you love it, if you like what you see, if you've had a great time in the theater, then text or TikTok or FaceTime.\n\nAnd if you didn't have a good time, keep it to yourself.\n\n[ Laughter ] And now, Ossie Davis' \"Purlie Victorious\"!\n\n[ Cheers and applause ] [ Country music plays ] ♪♪ [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ [ Insects chirping ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Animal snorts in distance ] ♪♪ [ Camera shutter clicks ] [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ [ Dog barks in distance ] ♪♪ -Missy!\n\nGitlow!\n\n-It's me, Purlie Victorious!\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\n[ Animals hooting, barking in distance ] Nobody home, it seems.\n\n[ Insects chirping ] Hey, come on -- come on in!\n\n[ Both laugh ] -Nobody home, it seems.\n\n-Cotton-picking time in Georgia.\n\nIt's against the law to be home.\n\nCome in.\n\nUnload yourself.\n\nSet your suitcase down.\n\n-What?!\n\n-It's making you lopsided.\n\n-It is?\n\nI didn't even notice.\n\n-You tired?\n\n-Not stepping high as I am!\n\n-Hungry?\n\n-No, sir.\n\nBut there's still some of my lunch left -- -No, thank you.\n\nTwo ham-hock sandwiches in one day is my limit.\n\nSorry I had to walk you so far so fast.\n\n-Oh, I didn't mind, sir.\n\nWalking's good for you.\n\nMiz Emmylou says -- -Miz Emmylou can afford to say that.\n\nMiz Emmylou got a car, while all the transportation we got in the world is tied up in secondhand shoe leather.\n\nBut never mind, my sister, never you mind!\n\nAnd toll the bell, Big Bethel.\n\ntoll that big, black, fat, and sassy liberty bell!\n\nTell freedom the bridegroom cometh.\n\nThe day of her deliverance is now at hand!\n\nOh, there she is.\n\nMissy!\n\nOh, Missy!\n\n-Ye-e-e-s?\n\n-It's me, Purlie!\n\n-Purlie Victorious?\n\n-Yeah.\n\nPut that battling stick down and come on in here!\n\n-[ Laughing ] All right!\n\n-Aha!\n\nThat's Missy, my sister-in-law I was telling you about.\n\n-So, this is the house where you was born and bred at.\n\n-Yep.\n\nBetter than being born outdoors.\n\n-What a lovely background for your home life.\n\n-I wouldn't give it to my dog to raise fleas in!\n\n-So clean and nice and warm-hearted.\n\n-First chance I get I'ma burn the damn thing down!\n\n-Reb'n Purlie, it's yours, and that's what counts.\n\nLike Miz Emmylou says -- -Come here!\n\nYou see that big white house perched on top of that hill with them two windows looking right down at us like two eyeballs?\n\n-Uh-huh.\n\n-That's where Ol' Cap'n lives.\n\n-Ol' Cap'n?\n\n-\"Stonewall\" Jackson Cotchipee.\n\nHe owns this dump, not me.\n\n-Oh!\n\n-And that ain't all -- hill and dale, field and farm, truck and tractor, horse and mule, bird and bee and bush and tree and cotton.\n\nCotton by the boll and by the bale -- every bit of cotton you see in this county!\n\nEverything and everybody he owns!\n\n-Everybody?\n\nYou mean he owns people?\n\n-Well, look!\n\nAin't a man, woman, or child working in this valley that ain't in debt to that ol' bastard!\n\nBustard!\n\nA buzzard.\n\nAnd that includes Gitlow and Missy -- everybody except me.\n\n-But folks can't own people no more, Reb'n Purlie.\n\nMiz Emmylou says -- -You ain't working for Miz Emmylou no more.\n\nYou're working for me, Purlie Victorious.\n\nFreedom is my business, and I say that old man runs this plantation on debt.\n\nThe longer you work for Ol' Cap'n Cotchipee, the more you owe at the commissary.\n\nAnd if you don't pay up, you can't leave.\n\nAnd I don't give a damn what Miz Emmylou nor nobody else says.\n\nThat's slavery.\n\n-I'm sorry, Reb'n Purlie.\n\n-Don't apologize.\n\nWait!\n\nJust wait.\n\nWail till I get my church.\n\nHa ha!\n\nYou wait till I buy Big Bethel back.\n\nWait till I stand once again in the pulpit of Grandpa Kincaid and call upon my people and talk to my people about Ol' Cap'n, that miserable son-of-a- -Wait!\n\n-Wait, I say!\n\nAnd we'll see who's gonna dominize this valley!\n\nHim or me!\n\n[ Dog barking ] Missy.\n\n-Purlie!\n\n-Missy!\n\n-Well...well...well!\n\n-For God's sake, Missy, don't choke her to death!\n\n-All my life, I been praying for me a daughter just like you.\n\nMy prayers has been answered at last.\n\nWelcome to our home, whoever you is!\n\n-Thank you, ma'am.\n\n-\"Ma'am\"?\n\nMa'am?!\n\nListen to the child, Purlie.\n\nEverybody down here calls me Aunt Missy, and I'd be much obliged if you would, too.\n\n-It would make me very glad to do so, Aunt Missy.\n\n-Mm-hmm!\n\nPretty as a pan of buttermilk biscuits.\n\nWhere on earth did you find her, Purlie?\n\nLet me take your things.\n\nNow, you just make yourself at home.\n\nAre you hungry?\n\n-No, ma'am, but cheap as water is, I sure ain't got no business being this thirsty.\n\n-I'll get some for you.\n\n-There's the dipper.\n\nAnd right out yonder by the fence, just this side of that great, big, live oak tree you'll find the well, sweetest water in Cotchipee County.\n\n-Thank you, Reb'n Purlie.\n\nI'm very much obliged.\n\n-Reb'n who?\n\n-Perfection -- absolute Ethiopian perfect.\n\nHuh, Missy?\n\n-Oh, I don't know about that.\n\n-What do you mean you don't know?\n\nThis girl looks more like Cousin Bee than Cousin Bee ever did.\n\n-No resemblance to me.\n\n-Don't be ridiculous.\n\nShe's the spitting image.\n\n-No resemblance whatsoever!\n\n-I ought to know how my own cousin looked.\n\n-But I was the last one to see her alive.\n\n-Twins, if not closer.\n\n-Are you crazy?\n\nBee was more lean, loose, and leggy.\n\n-Maybe so, but this girl makes it up -- -With no chin to speak of.\n\nHer eyes sort of fickle, one to another.\n\n-I know, but even so -- -And look at her head.\n\nIt ain't nearly as built like a rutabaga as Bee's own was.\n\n-What's the difference?!\n\nWhite folks can't tell one of us from another by the head!\n\n[ Laughter ] -Twenty years ago it was, Purlie.\n\nOl' Cap'n laid bullwhip to your natural behind.\n\n-Twenty years ago I swore I'd see his soul in hell.\n\n-And I don't think you come full back to your senses yet.\n\nThat old man ain't no fool!\n\n-That makes it one \"no fool\" against another.\n\n-He's dangerous, Purlie.\n\nWe could get killed if that old man was to find out what we was trying to do to get that church back.\n\n-How he gonna find out, Missy?\n\nHow many times must I tell you?\n\nIf it's one thing I am foolproof in it's white-folk psychology.\n\n-That's exactly what I'm afraid of.\n\n-Freedom, Missy, that's what Big Bethel means -- for you, me, and Gitlow.\n\nAnd we can buy it back for $500, Missy.\n\nFreedom!\n\nYou want it, or don't you?\n\n-Of course I want it, but -- after all, Purlie, that rich, old lady didn't exactly leave that $500 to us!\n\n-She left it to Aunt Henrietta.\n\n-Aunt Henrietta is dead.\n\n-Exactly!\n\n-And Henrietta's daughter, Cousin Bee, is dead, too.\n\n-Which makes us next in line to inherit the money by law!\n\n-All right, then, why don't we just go on up that hill man-to-man and tell Ol' Cap'n we want our money?\n\n-Missy, you have been black as long as I have.\n\n-Hell, boy, we could make him give it to us.\n\n-Make him how?\n\nHe a white man, Missy.\n\nWhat do you plan to do, sue him?\n\n-After all, it is our money, and it was our church.\n\n-And can you think of a better way to get it back than with that girl out there?\n\n-But you think it'll work, Purlie?\n\nYou really think she can fool Ol' Cap'n?\n\n-He'll never know what hit him!\n\n-Maybe, but there's still the question of Gitlow.\n\n-What about Gitlow?\n\n-Gitlow has changed his mind.\n\n-Well, you'll have to change it back.\n\n-Missy!\n\n[ Dogs barking ] Help!\n\nMissy!\n\nMissy, help!\n\nOh, help, Missy!\n\nHelp, Missy!\n\nOh!\n\n-What the devil's the matter this time?!\n\n-There I was, Missy, picking in the high cotton, twice as fast as the human eye could see.\n\nAll of a sudden I missed a boll, and it fell.\n\nIt fell on the ground, Missy.\n\nI stooped as fast as I could to pick it up and ripped the seat of my britches.\n\nThere I was, Missy, exposed from stem to stern.\n\n-What's so awful about that?\n\nIt's only cotton.\n\n-Oh, but cotton is white, Missy.\n\nWe must maintain respect.\n\nBring me my Sunday-school britches.\n\n-What?!\n\n-Ol' Cap'n is coming down into the cotton patch today, and I know you want your Gitlow to look his level best.\n\nNow come on.\n\nGo get my pants!\n\nYou better... -Gitlow, have I got the girl!\n\n-Is that so?\n\nWhat girl?\n\n-See?\n\nLook.\n\nThere she is!\n\n-Well?\n\n-Well, what?\n\n-Well, what do you think?\n\n-No, she'll never do.\n\n-What do you mean she'll never do?\n\n-My advice to you is to take that girl back to Florida as fast as you can!\n\n-I can't take that girl back to Florida.\n\n-Why can't you take her back to Florida?\n\n-'Cause she comes from Alabama!\n\nGitlow, look at her.\n\nShe's just the type, just the size, just the style!\n\n-And just the girl to get us all in jail.\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nMissy?!\n\nGirl or no girl, I ain't getting mixed up in no more of your nightmares.\n\nI got my own.\n\nDamn it, Missy, I said let's go!\n\n-You want me to take my bat to you again?\n\n-No, Missy, control yourself.\n\nIt's just that every second Gitlow's off the firing lineup, seven pounds of Ol' Cap'n's cotton don't get gotten.\n\n-Gitlow, wait a minute.\n\nWait!\n\nMissy, stop him.\n\n-He ain't as easy to stop as he used to be, especially now Ol' Cap'n's made him Deputy for the Colored.\n\n-Deputy for the Colored?\n\nWhat the devil is that?\n\n-Who knows?\n\nAll I know is Gitlow's changed his mind.\n\n-But Gitlow can't change his mind!\n\n-Oh, it's easy enough when you ain't got much to start with.\n\nI warned you.\n\nYou don't know how shifty ol' Git can get.\n\nHe's the hardest man to convince and keep convinced I ever seen in my life.\n\n-Missy, you've got to make him go up that hill.\n\nHe's got to identify this girl.\n\nOl' Cap'n won't believe nobody else.\n\n-I know.\n\n-He's got to swear before Ol' Cap'n that this girl is the real Cousin Bee.\n\n-I know!\n\n-Missy, you're the only person in this world ol' Git'll really listen to.\n\n-I know.\n\n-And what if you do have to hit him a time or two, Missy?\n\nIt's for his own good.\n\n-I know!\n\n-He'll recover from it, Missy.\n\nHe always does.\n\n-I know!\n\n-Freedom, Missy -- Big Bethel -- for you, me, and Gitlow.\n\n-Freedom -- and a little something left over -- that's all I ever wanted all my life.\n\nShe do look a little somewhat like Cousin Bee... about the feet!\n\n-Of course she does.\n\n-I won't guarantee nothing, Purlie, but I'll try.\n\n-Every time I see you, Missy, you get prettier by the pound!\n\nCome here, girl!\n\n[ Both laugh ] -Whoo!\n\nNo!\n\nStop it, Purlie!\n\nStop it!\n\nStop it!\n\nQuit cutting the fool in front of company!\n\n-Whoo!\n\nHow wondrous are the daughters of my people yet knoweth not the glories of themselves!\n\nWhere do you suppose I found her, Missy, this Ibo prize, this Zulu Pearl, this long-lost lily of the black Mandingo, Kikuyu maid, beneath whose brown embrace hot suns of Africa are burning still?\n\nWhere, where?\n\nA drudge, a serving wench, a feudal fetch-pot, a common scullion in the white man's kitchen drowned is her youth in thankless Southern dishpans.\n\nHer beauty spilt for Dixiecratic pigs!\n\nThis brown-skinned grape, this wine of Negro vintage -- -I know all that, Purlie, but what's her name?\n\n-I don't think he likes my name so much.\n\nIt's Lutiebelle, ma'am.\n\nLutiebelle Gussie Mae Jenkins!\n\n-Lutiebelle Gussie Mae Jenkins!\n\nMy, that's nice.\n\n-Nice!\n\nIt's an insult to the Negro people!\n\n-Purlie, behave yourself!\n\n-A previous condition of servitude, a badge of inferiority, and I refuse to have it in my organization!\n\nChange it!\n\n-You want me to box your mouth for you!\n\n-Lutiebelle Gussie Mae Jenkins?\n\nWhat does it mean in Swahili?\n\nCheap labor!\n\n-In Swahili?\n\n-One of the thirteen silver tongues of Africa -- Swahili, Bushongo, Ashanti, Baganda, Herero, Yoruba, Bambara, Mpongwe.\n\nSwahili, a language of moons, velvet drums, hot days of rivers, red-splashed, and bird-song bright, black fingers in rice white at sunset red, ten thousand Queens of Sheba.\n\n-Just where did Purlie find you, honey?\n\n-It was in Dothan, Alabama, last Sunday, Aunt Missy, right in the junior choir.\n\n-The junior choir -- my, my, my!\n\n-Behold!\n\nI said, \"This dark and holy vessel, in whom should burn that golden-nut-brown joy, which Negro womanhood was meant to be, ten thousand queens, ten thousand Queens of Sheba, Ethiopia herself in all her beauteous wonder, come to restore the ancient thrones of Cush!\n\n-Great God Almighty, Purlie, I can't hear myself think!\n\n-That's just what I said last Sunday, Aunt Missy, when Reb'n Purlie started preaching that thing in the pulpit.\n\n-Preaching it?!\n\n-Lord, Aunt Missy, I shouted clear down to the mourners' bench.\n\n-But last time you was a professor of Negro Philosophy.\n\n-I told you, Missy, my intention is to buy Big Bethel back, to reclaim the ancient pulpit of Grandpa Kincaid, and preach freedom in the cotton patch.\n\nI told you!\n\n-Maybe you did, Purlie, maybe you did.\n\nYou got yourself a license?\n\n-No!\n\n-Purlie Victorious Judson -- self-made minister of the gospel-claw-hammer coattail, shoestring tie and all.\n\n-How else can you lead the Negro people?\n\n-Is that what you got in your mind, leading the Negro people?\n\n-Who else is they got?\n\n-God help the race.\n\n-It was a sermon, I mean, Aunt Missy, the likes of which has never been heard before.\n\n-Oh, I bet that!\n\nTell me about it, son.\n\nWhat did you preach?\n\n-I preached the New Baptism of Freedom for all mankind, according to the Declaration of Independence, taking as my text the Constitution of the United States of America, Amendments First through Fifteenth, which readeth as follows... \"Congress shall make no law --\" -Enough!\n\nThat's enough, son.\n\nI'm converted!\n\n-[ Laughs ] -But it is confusing, all the changes you keep going through.\n\nHoney, every time I see Purlie, he's somebody else.\n\n-Not anymore, Missy.\n\nIf I'm lying, may the good Lord put me down in the book of bad names.\n\nPurlie is put forever.\n\n-Yes.\n\nBut will he stay put forever?\n\n-There is in every man a finger of iron that points him what he must and must not do.\n\n-And your finger points up the hill to that $500 with which you'll buy Big Bethel back, preach freedom in the cotton patch, and live happily ever after.\n\n-The soul-consuming passion of my life.\n\nNow it's 2:15, Missy.\n\nGitlow's waiting, Missy.\n\nI suggest you get a move on.\n\n-I already got a move on.\n\nHad it since 4:00 this morning.\n\n-Time, Missy -- exactly what the colored man in this country ain't got, and you're wasting it.\n\n-Purlie, would you mind stepping out into the cotton patch and telling your brother Gitlow I'd like a few words with him?\n\nUnh-unh-unh!\n\n[ Laughs ] Do like I tell you.\n\nNow go!\n\n-[ Laughs ] -Besides, it wouldn't be hospitable not to set and visit a spell with our distinguished guest over from Dothan, Alabama.\n\n-Thank you, ma'am.\n\n-Now, let's you and me just set back and enjoy a piece of my potato pie.\n\nYou like potato pie, don't you?\n\n-Oh, yes, ma'am.\n\nI like it very much.\n\n-And get real acquainted.\n\n-I'm ever so obliged.\n\nMy, this looks nice!\n\nMm-mm-mm!\n\n-You know, ever since that old man took after Purlie so unmerciful with that bullwhip 20 years ago, he fidgets, always on the go, rattling around from place to place all over the country, one step ahead of the white folks.\n\nSomething about Purlie always did irritate the white folks.\n\n-Is that the truth!\n\n-Oh, my, yes.\n\nFinally wound up being locked up a time or two for safekeeping.\n\n-Hmm!\n\n-Always kept up with his schooling, though.\n\nIn fact, that boy's got one of the best secondhand educations in this country.\n\n-Is that a fact?\n\n-Used to read everything he could get his hands on.\n\n-He did?\n\nAin't that wonderful?\n\n-Till one day he finally got tired and throwed all his books to the hogs.\n\nNot enough \"Negro\" in them, he said.\n\nAfter that, he puttered around with first one thing, then another.\n\nRemember the big bus boycott they had in Montgomery?\n\nWell, we don't travel by bus in the cotton patch, so Purlie boycotted mules!\n\n-You don't say so?\n\n-Another time he invented a secret language that Negroes could understand but white folks couldn't.\n\n-Oh, my goodness gracious!\n\n-He sent it C.O.D.\n\nto the NAACP, but they never answered his letter.\n\n-Oh, they will, Aunt Missy.\n\nYou can just bet your life, they will.\n\n-I don't mind it so much.\n\nGreat leaders are bound to pop up from time to time amongst our people.\n\nIn fact, we sort of look forward to it.\n\nBut Purlie's in such a hurry, I'm afraid he'll lose his mind.\n\n-Lose his mind?\n\nNo!\n\nOh, no!\n\n-That is unless you and me can do something about it.\n\n-You and me?\n\nDo -- do what, Aunt Missy?\n\nYou tell me.\n\nI'll do anything!\n\n-Well, now, ain't nothing ever all that peculiar about a man, a good wife, and a family and some steady home cooking won't cure.\n\nDon't you think so?\n\n-Oh, yes, Aunt Missy, yes.\n\nYou'd be surprised how many tall, good-looking, great, big, ol' handsome-looking mens, just like Reb'n Purlie, walking around, starving theyselves to death!\n\nOh, I just wish I had one to aim my pot at!\n\n-Well, Purlie Judson is the uncrowned appetite of the age.\n\n-He is?\n\nWhat's his favorite?\n\n-Anything!\n\nAnything a fine-looking, strong, and healthy girl like you could put on the table.\n\n-Like me?\n\nLike me?!\n\nOh, Aunt Missy!\n\n-Honey, I mind once at the Sunday-school picnic, Purlie had a whole sack of pullets!\n\n-Oh, I just knowed there was something!\n\nSomething just reeks about that man.\n\nHe puts me in the mind of all the good things I ever had in my life -- picnics, fish fries, corn-shuckings, and love-feasts, and Gospel-singing, picking huckleberries, roasting ground peas, quilting-bee parties, and -- mm!\n\n-- barbecues, that certain kind of...welcome you can't get nowhere else in all this world.\n\nOh, Aunt Missy, life is so good to us -- sometimes!\n\n-Oh, child, being colored can be a lotta fun when ain't nobody looking.\n\n-Ain't it the truth?!\n\nI always said I'd never pass for white, no matter how

[ Laughter and applause ] ...as post-mortal guest of honor, at our expense, it is not too late to repent.\n\nWe still need togetherness.\n\nWe still need each otherness with faith in the futureness of our cause.\n\nLet us, therefore, stifle the rifle of conflict, scatter the shatter of discord, smuggle the struggle, tickle the, uh...pickle, and grapple the apple of peace!\n\n-This funeral is brought to you as a public service.\n\n-Take up his bones.\n\nFor he who was my skin's enemy was brave enough to die standing for what he believed, and it is the wish of his family and his friends that he be buried likewise.\n\n[ Laughter ] There, there.\n\nPut kindness in your fingers.\n\nHe was a man, despite his own example.\n\nTake up his bones.\n\nTonight, my friends, I find in being black a thing of beauty... [ Applause ] ...a joy, a strength, a secret cup of gladness, a native land in neither time nor place, a native land in every Negro face!\n\nBe loyal to yourselves.\n\nYour skin, your hair, your lips, your Southern speech, your laughing kindness are Negro kingdoms, vast as any other.\n\nAccept in full the sweetness of your blackness, not wishing to be red, nor white, nor yellow, nor any other race or face but this.\n\nFarewell, my deep and Africanic brothers.\n\nBe brave, keep freedom in the family.\n\nDo what you can for white folks... [ Laughter ] ...and write me in care of the post office.\n\nNow, may the Constitution of the United States go with you, the Declaration of Independence stand by you, the Bill of Rights protect you, and the State Commission Against Discrimination keep the eyes of the law upon you, henceforth, now and forever.\n\nAmen.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ [ Cheers and applause ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Cheers and applause ] -To find out more about this and other \"Great Performances\" programs, visit...
