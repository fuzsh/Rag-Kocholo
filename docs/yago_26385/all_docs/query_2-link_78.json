Without mythologizing Stalin as either benevolent or an evil genius, Khlevniuk resolves numerous controversies about specific events in the dictator's life while assembling many hundreds of previously unknown letters, memos, reports, and diaries into a comprehensive, compelling narrative of a life that altered the course of world history.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nLoved it, but wouldn't want to live it\n\nBy Neil on 01-12-20\n\nAmerican Betrayal: The Secret Assault on Our Nation’s Character\n\nBy: Diana West\n\nNarrated by: Diana West\n\nLength: 20 hrs and 41 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n5 out of 5 stars 182\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 161\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 164\n\n\"Russian influence\" may have entered our national pop-consciousness in Election 2016, but it is the shiny, deceptive, contested, and buried X-factor of a century of wars in Washington. In American Betrayal, Diana West digs deep to uncover a body of lies that Americans have been led to regard as the near-sacred history of World War II and its Cold War aftermath. Part real-life thriller, part national tragedy, American Betrayal lights up the massive, Moscow-directed penetration of America's most hallowed halls of power.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nTrue history of WWII &its consequences then & now\n\nBy jac on 04-24-18\n\nIke's Gamble\n\nAmerica's Rise to Dominance in the Middle East\n\nBy: Michael Doran\n\nNarrated by: Casey Jones\n\nLength: 9 hrs and 1 min\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 74\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 68\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 69\n\nIn 1956 President Nasser of Egypt moved to take possession of the Suez Canal, thereby bringing the Middle East to the brink of war.

Tuchman looks at history in a unique way and draws lessons from what she sees. This accessible introduction to the subject of history offers striking insights into America's past and present, trenchant observations on the international scene, and thoughtful pieces on the historian's role. Here is a splendid body of work, the story of a lifetime spent \"practicing history\".\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\nBarbara Tuchman fan faced with reality\n\nBy J.

Humes reveals the astonishingly accurate predictions of Britain's most famous prime minister and how his critics' perceptions of them shaped his political career. Who could have foreseen the start of World War I twenty-five years before the assassination of a Serbian archduke plunged Europe into war? Who could have predicted the rise of al-Qaeda nearly eight decades before anyone had heard of Osama bin Laden? Winston Churchill did.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nThe voice in the wilderness--Are we listening yet?\n\nBy Jean on 12-16-12\n\nThe Last Days of Stalin\n\nBy: Joshua Rubenstein\n\nNarrated by: Arthur Morey\n\nLength: 8 hrs and 46 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 697\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 610\n\nStory\n\n4 out of 5 stars 604\n\nJoshua Rubenstein's riveting account takes us back to the second half of 1952, when no one could foresee an end to Joseph Stalin's murderous regime. He was poised to challenge the newly elected US president Dwight Eisenhower with armed force and was also broadening a vicious campaign against Soviet Jews. Stalin's sudden collapse and death in March 1953 was as dramatic and mysterious as his life. It is no overstatement to say that his passing marked a major turning point in the 20th century.\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\nJUST A LITTLE TOO DULL\n\nBy Count B on 08-06-16\n\nReappraisals\n\nReflections on the Forgotten 20th Century\n\nBy: Tony Judt\n\nNarrated by: James Adams\n\nLength: 16 hrs and 53 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 160\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 91\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 89\n\nThe accelerating changes of the past generation have been accompanied by a similarly accelerated amnesia. The 20th century has become \"history\" at an unprecedented rate. The world of 2007 was so utterly unlike that of even 1987, much less any earlier time, that we have lost touch with our immediate past even before we have begun to make sense of it - and the results are proving calamitous.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nSuperb.

As the definitive single-volume answer to that question, this enthralling book has never been superseded. It is an American classic.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nPreparation for Ken Burns\n\nBy Chiefkent on 06-12-17\n\nThe Mighty and the Almighty\n\nReflections on America, God, and World Affairs\n\nBy: Madeleine Albright\n\nNarrated by: Madeleine Albright\n\nLength: 10 hrs and 22 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4 out of 5 stars 94\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 32\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 32\n\nDoes America have a special mission, derived from God, to bring liberty and democracy to the world? How much influence does the Christian right have over U.S. foreign policy? And how should America deal with violent Islamist extremists? Madeleine Albright, the former Secretary of State and best-selling author of Madam Secretary, offers a thoughtful and often surprising look at the role of religion in shaping America's approach to the world.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nThe point??\n\nBy Thomas on 11-04-06\n\nFire in the Lake\n\nBy: Frances FitzGerald\n\nNarrated by: Jeff Bottoms\n\nLength: 22 hrs and 31 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 50\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 43\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 44\n\nThis magisterial work, based on Frances FitzGerald's many years of research and travels, takes us inside the history of Vietnam - the traditional, ancestor-worshiping villages, the conflicts between Communists and anti-Communists, Catholics and Buddhists, generals and monks, the disruption created by French colonialism, and America's ill-fated intervention - and reveals the country as seen through Vietnamese eyes. Originally published in 1972, Fire in the Lake was the first history of Vietnam written by an American, and subsequently won the Pulitzer Prize.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nAmerican Hubris; Vietnamese Misery\n\nBy gunnerThrax on 01-24-21\n\nThe Plot to Scapegoat Russia\n\nHow the CIA and the Deep State Have Conspired to Vilify Putin\n\nBy: Dan Kovalik Esq.\n\nNarrated by: Alex Hyde-White\n\nLength: 6 hrs and 46 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 43\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 42\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 42\n\nSince 1945, the US has justified numerous wars, interventions, and military build-ups based on the pretext of the Russian Red Menace, even after the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991 and Russia stopped being Red. In fact, the two biggest post-war American conflicts, the Korean and Vietnam wars, were not, as has been frequently claimed, about stopping Soviet aggression or even influence. And now the specter of a Russian Menace has been raised again in the wake of Donald Trump's victory.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nA Great Listen!\n\nBy Mark Andreadis on 12-29-17"
