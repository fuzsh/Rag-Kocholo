        "text": "Former 4077th M*A*S*H roommates Alan Alda and Mike Farrell reunited on Saturday to toast the 50th anniversary of the acclaimed war comedy’s premiere.\n\n“Mike Farrell and I today toasting the 50th anniversary of the show that changed our lives – and our brilliant pals who made it what it was,” Alda wrote on Twitter, sharing the photo below of him and Farrell sharing some proper wine versus anything from the Swamp’s still. “MASH was a great gift to us.”\n\nMore from TVLine\n\nTVLine Items: Donuts Star Eyes CBS Return, Lodge 49 Renewed and More\n\nDavid Ogden Stiers, Emmy Nominee From M*A*S*H, Dead at 75\n\nHulu Adds HIMYM, NYPD Blue, White Collar, M*A*S*H, Dollhouse and Others\n\nAlda starred as Capt. Benjamin Franklin “Hawkeye” Pierce on the Korean War comedy, whereas Farrell joined the cast in Season 4 as as Capt. B. J. Hunnicutt. (Original cast member Wayne Rogers played Hawkeye’s original BFF, Capt. “Trapper” John McIntyre, for the first three seasons; Rogers died in December 2015.)\n\nOf note, a total of four CBS classics celebrated their 50th anniversaries this week: Maude (on Sept. 12), The Waltons (Sep. 14), The Bob Newhart Show (Sep. 16), and M*A*S*H (Sept. 17). That, kids, was a helluva week of TV.\n\nM*A*S*H originally starred Alda, Rogers, McLean Stevenson (as Lt. Col. Henry Blake), Loretta Swit (as Maj. Margaret “Hot Lips” Houlihan), Larry Linville (as Maj. Frank Burns) and Gary Burghoff (as Cpl. Walter “Radar” O’Reilly), while Jamie Farr and William Christopher recurred as Klinger and Father Mulcahy.\n\nCome Season 4, Rogers and Stevenson had been succeeded by Farrell and Harry Morgan (as Col. Sherman T. Potter), and in Season 5, David Ogden Stiers’ Maj. Charles Emerson Winchester III replaced Major Burns.\n\nOf the above, Alda, Farrell, Swit, Burghoff and Farr are still with us.\n\nLaunch Gallery: TV's 30 Best Series Finales, Ranked — Now Including, Yes, <I>Lost</i>\n\nBest of TVLine\n\nTV Ships We Can't Believe Never Kissed\n\nBest TV Vampires, Ranked: 23 Fanged Favorites From TVD, True Blood, Buffy, Angel, Shadowhunters and More\n\nThe Brady Bunch Characters, Ranked — Somewhat Brutally at Times\n\nGet more from TVLine.com: Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Newsletter"
