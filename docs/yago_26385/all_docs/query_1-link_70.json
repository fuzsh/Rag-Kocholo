        "text": "Anonymous\n\nUnregistered\n\nThis is supposedly a list from TV Guide of the 100 most greatest TV episodes of all time. I deleted all of the ones that were not comedies, except for #3 because I thought it was an interesting #3. I would have never guessed this show would have an episode in the top 3.\n\n100\n\nFRIENDS February 1, 1996\n\nHow to put Ross and Rachel in each other's arms after a season and a half of false starts? Give them an audio-visual aid. Looking at footage from high school in \"The One With the Prom Video,\" Rachel finally recognizes Ross's long-suffering devotion to her. Ever so slowly she crosses the room and kisses him. The fateful video also reveals a chunky teenage Monica (Courteney Cox). When she insists that the camera adds 10 pounds, Chandler (Matthew Perry) asks, \"So how many cameras are actually on you?\"\n\n94\n\nMORK & MINDY\n\nMay 6, 1980\n\nRobin Williams' outrageous, turbo-comic brilliance has never been better showcased than in \"Mork's Mixed Emotions.\"A kiss from Mindy uncorks the entire gamut of the space cadet's long-pent-up feelings. What follows is a dizzying, dazzling display of Williams' unfettered inventiveness and versatility. One after another, Mork's carefully repressed emotions come ricocheting out, each of them punctuated by a different voice. He is by turns loving, fearful, joyful, guilty, envious, hopeful, disgusted, and grateful. And that's the warm-up. Thank goodness for the commercials, or you'd never have a chance to catch your breath.\n\n88\n\nHAPPY DAYS\n\nOctober 14, 1975\n\nA top 20 series for eight of its 11 seasons, Happy Days often focused on the brotherly relationship between two '50s stereotypes: Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard, right, with Pat Morita), the clean-cut boy next door, and his idol, Fonzie (Henry Winkler), the coolest motorcycle-riding high school dropout in all of Milwaukee. \"Richie Fights Back\" finds straight- arrow Richie being tyrannized by a pair of bullies. \"I'm going to teach you the secret of being tough,\" Fonzie assures Richie, who has already tried studying jujitsu with Arnold (Morita). \"Of course, with that Howdy Doody face, you can only be so tough.\" The secret is nothing earthshaking: Act tough, sound tough, and maybe people will think you are tough. But in the end, it works. Richie stands up to the bullies all by himself. Howdy Doody gets his self-respect back -- with a little help from his leather-clad friend.\n\n84\n\nMAD ABOUT YOU\n\nFebruary 16, 1995\n\n\"The Alan Brady Show\" turns reality inside out and brings to life the fictional Alan Brady (Carl Reiner), who once terrorized the characters of The Dick Van Dyke Show. But when Brady threatens to bail out as the narrator of Paul's documentary on the history of -- what else? -- TV, Mad really goes mad: Jamie gets so upset she bursts into tears the way Laura Petrie used to, sobbing, \"Oh, Paul.\" Where is Mel Cooley when you need him?\n\n82\n\nTHE LOVEBOAT\n\nOctober 12, 1985\n\nAndy Warhol is on board the Pacific Princess, and he wants to paint a portrait of Kansas housewife Mary Hammond (Marion Ross). But Mary will be sunk if her conservative husband, George (Tom Bosley), finds out she once had 15 minutes of fame as a green-haired bohemian named Marina Del Rey who appeared in a Warhol art movie, \"White Giraffe.\" Perhaps the campiest of all Love Boats, \"The 200th Episode\" not only reunites Happy Days stars Ross and Bosley, it features a then-unknown Teri Hatcher as one of the ship's singing-and-dancing Love Boat Mermaids.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"I told Andy, 'You know, you're a really terrible actor, but I will help you!'\" says Ross about working with the king of pop art. \"He was very scared to be an actor. He was very sour-looking and damaged-looking, but he turned out to be the sweetest guy in the world. I feel so privileged; he wrote in his [now published] diary, 'I really love [Marion] so much. She's a wonderful person, and she helps me.'\"\n\n80\n\nM*A*S*H\n\nFebruary 24, 1976\n\nThe heart of this superlative series was Capt. Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce (Alan Alda), an insubordinate surgeon whose tongue was as sharp as his scalpel. While his surgical tools were used to put young soldiers' bodies back together, his rapier wit was usually employed to skewer military pretension and hypocrisy. Hawkeye puts both his cutting instruments to optimal use in \"The Interview,\" in which a television correspondent visits the 4077th to shoot a documentary. The episode, filmed in black and white, records staff members giving their alternately amusing, moving, and painful takes on everything from the madness of war to what they miss most about home. The \"film\" ends with the inevitable arrival of a new batch of casualties and the unit mobilizing to do the work it does best, but which it would rather not be doing at all, in a place it would rather not be.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"We had a roundtable where everyone contributed suggestions,\" says Gary Burghoff, who played Radar. \"Very few television shows have been created with that kind of mutual respect. It was Camelot.\"\n\n78\n\nTHE PARTRIDGE FAMILY\n\nJanuary 29, 1971\n\nIn \"Soul Club,\" a plucky, ambitious road trip, the singing family finds itself mistakenly booked into a black nightclub in Detroit. Complication: The club's broke owners (Richard Pryor and Louis Gossett Jr.) will lose their business if the night's turnout isn't huge. When only one customer shows up, Mrs. Partridge decides to throw a block party the next day and charge admission. Keith (David Cassidy) even writes a song for the occasion, declaring, \"It's sort of an Afro thing.\" Everyone from local merchants to a Pantheresque group in black berets attends the event, and the club is saved. This may be the most outlandish episode on our list; it's certainly one of the best-intentioned.\n\n77\n\nBARNEY MILLER\n\nDecember 16, 1976\n\nWojo's hippie girlfriend bakes a batch of brownies, which the amiable detective (Max Gail) shares with his fellow cops in the 12th Precinct. What he doesn't know: The sweets are laced with hashish. Before long, dour Detective Yemana (Jack Soo) wobbles by, saying with a giggle, \"Anybody seen my legs?\" The reserved Harris (Ron Glass) greets a jailed suspect with \"What's happening, baby?\" Stooped, stone-faced Phil Fish (Abe Vigoda) even chases a robber across a rooftop. This humane series always treated its working-class detectives as real people, not stereotypes. That's why \"Hash\" remains so raucously relevant.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"There was a lot of talk about whether the, uh, props we used were going to be authentic,\" says Glass. \"Some of us were hoping for a little boost.\"\n\n75\n\n3RD ROCK FROM THE SUN\n\nSeptember 29, 1996\n\nWhile High Commander Dick (John Lithgow) and his beloved Mary (Jane Curtin) are at a sci-fi convention in Cleveland where Star Trek's George Takei (Mr. Sulu) is plugging his new book, Warp Speed, Dammit! The Complete Rants of William Shatner, the rest of the crew is back at the hotel discovering the ineffable joys of room service -- massages, robes, bubbly, chocolates, lobster, and more lobster. And what's this -- a Cleveland phone book? No, that's the bill. Welcome to \"Hotel Dick.\"\n\n73\n\nMISTER ED\n\nSeptember 29, 1963\n\nWith the Los Angeles Dodgers in a slump, manager Leo Durocher gets a helpful dugout phone call from architect \"Wilbur Post,\" but in fact he's getting advice straight from the horse's mouth. Mister Ed's tip works: The Dodgers win. Before you know it, Wilbur (Alan Young) and Mister Ed are at Dodger Stadium, where the golden palomino takes batting practice. Stepping to the plate against Sandy Koufax, Ed hits one to the outfield wall and gallops around the bases. When Johnny Roseboro sees the hard-charging charger round third and head for home, the Dodgers' catcher immediately climbs the backstop to avoid him. This could be an inside-the-park homer. Slide, Mister Ed, slide! OK, an ersatz Ed may have been yanked down the third-base line by visible wires, but there's certainly nothing fake about the place \"Leo Durocher Meets Mister Ed\" has in sitcom-sports history.\n\n71\n\nTHE PATTY DUKE SHOW\n\nMay 24, 1964\n\nThis episode re-creates the first meeting between those \"identical cousins\" Patty and Cathy Lane, in which cultured Cathy gets her Uncle Martin (William Schallert) fired from his job as managing editor of the New York Daily Chronicle and breaks up Patty's romance with Richard (Eddie Applegate) -- all before the second commercial. This frothy family comedy boasted good writing and clever camera work, but its real distinction was Patty Duke's extraordinary dual performance -- never more noticeable than in \"The Cousins,\" in which she plays Cathy imitating Patty and vice versa. You can lose your mind when cousins are two of a kind.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"I always had the impression that I was working with two different people,\" recalls Schallert. \"Patty created two such totally different girls. What was amazing was that she could do that with such subtle changes. It really was marvelous acting on her part.\"\n\n69\n\nBUFFALO BILL\n\nJanuary 5, 1984\n\nNo sitcom was ever edgier than this one: Its pre-P.C. humor was so dark that some never saw it. In \"Jerry Lewis Week,\" the browbeaten station manager, Karl Shub (Max Wright), finally stands up to his star's bullying. He steals a stuffed bear that Bill (Dabney Coleman) has been using on-air to plug his mechanic (in exchange for free repairs). This insurrection occurs during WBFL's tribute to Jerry Lewis, which has brought on a locustlike infestation of Lewis lookalikes, all braying \"Hey, lady!\" One is played by an unbilled, 21-year-old Jim Carrey. Plenty more would be heard from Carrey, but sadly, Buffalo Bill would last only 12 more episodes.\n\n68\n\nFAMILY TIES\n\nMarch 12, 1987\n\nAlex P. Keaton, whose life revolves around himself, money, family, money, school, money (and money), realizes the value of life in the one-hour \"'A' My Name Is Alex,\" written by Alan Uger and series creator Gary David Goldberg. A friend is killed in a car accident, and Alex is overcome with grief. In \"Our Town\"-like flashbacks, he talks to an unseen psychiatrist and grapples with big questions about God and a person's place in the grand scheme of things. Great sitcoms are not always all about jokes. The best make us laugh till we cry, and sometimes, when they mix in tragedy with the comedy, we cry till we laugh.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"I was sound asleep and woke up with this idea,\" says Goldberg. \"I saw Michael talking, trying to make sense of his life. I saw it in shadows and fragments, the way it looks in dreams. I got up and started writing.\"\n\n67\n\nGET SMART\n\nJanuary 13, 1968\n\nWould you believe the far-out opening of \"The Groovy Guru\"? Agent 86 (Don Adams) -- wearing a Beatles wig, shades, and a Nehru shirt, and brandishing a sign exclaiming \"Drop Out!\" -- exchanges passwords with a courier. What he doesn't know is that the courier actually works for evil KAOS's newest recruit, a renegade disc jockey (F Troop's Larry Storch) who's planning to use subliminal messages in songs to brainwash teens into overthrowing the establishment! Of course, Max and 99 (Barbara Feldon) stop this fiendish plan -- but not before we get to see 99 frug madly amid a psychedelic light show. Groovy, man.\n\n66\n\nTHE SIMPSONS\n\nMay 13, 1993\n\nKrusty the Clown has always beaten the competition. \"I slaughtered the Special Olympics,\" he muses. But that was before the arrival of Gabbo, the ventriloquist's dummy. \"Gabbo Is Fabbo,\" gush the trade papers. Krusty is soon reduced to standing by the road with a sign that says, \"Will Drop Pants For Food.\" Bart and Lisa to the rescue! They plan a comeback special and recruit Johnny Carson, Hugh Hefner, Bette Midler, Luke Perry, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers for the show. It's a smash, and so is \"Krusty Gets Kancelled.\"\n\n65\n\nNORTHERN EXPOSURE\n\nAugust 30, 1990\n\nWho wouldn't want to live in Cicely, Alaska, the most mystical oasis in TV history? Something unusual is always happening in this border town that brims with imagination, but never more than in \"The Aurora Borealis.\" When Bernard (Richard Cummings Jr.), a befuddled accountant, motorcycles into town, he and Chris, the DJ (John Corbett), discover they share more than a few genes. Meanwhile, Dr. Fleischman (Rob Morrow), stranded in the wild, comes face to face with the region's feared and mythical \"bigfoot,\" Adam -- who ends up grudgingly teaching the doctor how to cook Chinese dumplings.\n\n64\n\nTHE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS\n\nOctober 6, 1959\n\nDobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman) was nothing if not ardent, and he was most ardent about the blond, avaricious Thalia (Tuesday Weld). In \"The Best Dressed Man,\" Dobie, a grocer's son, only has eyes for Thalia, but she only has eyes for rich, fashionable Milton Armitage (Warren Beatty). Determined to beat the clotheshorse at his own game and win Thalia's heart, Dobie convinces the local haberdasher to outfit him in snappy duds as an advertisement for the man's store. To his sorrow, though, Dobie learns that, as far as Thalia's concerned, it takes more than clothes to make the man -- it takes deep pockets.\n\n63\n\nTAXI\n\nSeptember 25, 1979\n\n\"Reverend Jim\" Ignatowski, a remnant of the '60s who's eaten one magic mushroom too many, is sitting at the bar in Mario's. Bobby (Jeff Conaway) comes up to him and says, \"Hey, Jim, my friends and I were wondering if you'd like to come over and join us.\" Jim replies, \"What did you decide?\" \"Reverend Jim: Space Odyssey\" is a rolling snowball of laughs. First the cabbies have to persuade Louie DePalma (Danny DeVito) to take Jim on. Louie takes one look at the wild-eyed ex-hippie and says, \"Get him outta here!\" But Jim slips a tranquilizer into Louie's coffee, and the pint-size tyrant of Sunshine Cab Co. is soon crooning, \"We were sailing along…on Moonlight Bay.…\" Reverend Jim is in. All he has to do now is take a driver's test. He sits down, reads the first question, knits his brow, and whispers to the waiting cabbies, \"What does a yellow light mean?\" \"Slow down!\" Bobby whispers back. \"OK,\" says Jim, \"what…does…a…yellow…light…mean?\"\n\n62\n\nTHE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES\n\nOctober 14, 1964\n\nPart sitcom, part silent movie, \"Hedda Hopper's Hollywood\" features the legendary Hollywood columnist, who convinces Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen, below, with Nancy Kulp) to buy a movie studio. She tells Clampett that to make \"great pictures\" he'll need \"great stars\" and takes him to Grauman's Chinese Theater. \"Somebody has sure gone and messed up this poor man's cee-ment,\" Jed says. Soon he and Jethro (Max Baer Jr.) are paving over even Mary Pickford's prints. They're arrested. Hopper springs them, only to climb onto Jed's bulldozer herself: \"Someday, Hollywood is going to thank me for this!\"\n\n61\n\nCAR 54, WHERE ARE YOU?\n\nFebruary 15, 1962\n\nNat Hiken, one of the great comedy writers of TV's early years, had a commanding knowledge of men in uniform: Before creating New York City patrol-car cops Gunther Toody and Francis Muldoon, he gave Sergeant Bilko marching orders. Joe E. Ross plays Toody, the stocky, nonsense-spouting motormouth; Fred Gwynne is Muldoon, his tall, thin, dour, college-educated partner. In \"How Smart Can You Get?\" the NYPD's personnel department decides that Toody and Muldoon are too mismatched to be partners and pairs Muldoon with a rookie named Corrigan (Richard Morse), a Harvard graduate. Muldoon eventually becomes so preoccupied with Corrigan's highbrow conversation that he drives right past crimes in progress -- and ends the episode pleading to be reunited with Toody. That's the deal with great TV odd couples: Nothing breaks them up, no matter how odd they are.\n\n59\n\nGREEN ACRES\n\nApril 3 &10, 1968\n\nIt is the theatrical event of the season: the Hooterville Barn & Repertory Co.'s staging of \"Who.\" (The full title of the play was \"Who Killed Jock Robin?\" -- but only one word will fit on the marquee, an old wooden plank.) Sophia Loren is supposed to star in the 12-act mystery, but she is unavailable. Newt Kiley's police dog, Columbo, is set to appear but bows out. Arnold the pig steps in. The big ham gets rave reviews, and in \"A Star Named Arnold Is Born,\" he's off to Hollywood for a screen test. Arnold doesn't last long in Tinseltown, but for one shining moment a star is born. And why not? Arnold has nearly as much range as Eva Gabor.\n\n58\n\nTHE ODD COUPLE\n\nNovember 12, 1971\n\nIn \"Fat Farm,\" Felix (Tony Randall) somehow convinces junk-food junkie Oscar (Jack Klugman) to join him at a health spa run by a dictatorial diet guru and staffed by large, humorless attendants. The show's usual great one-liners -- \"I watched him eating six hot dogs during the game, and he only chewed two\" -- are supplemented with terrific physical gags. When Oscar smuggles in deli contraband, Felix blows the whistle on him, guards confiscate Oscar's pastrami, and the doctor expels him. It's a perfectly seasoned recipe for delicious, high-calorie comedy.\n\n57\n\nON THE AIR\n\nJune 20, 1992\n\nIn this hellzapoppin' parody of live TV in the '50s, a show starring matinee idol Lester Guy (Ian Buchanan) is nearing airtime. The director spews orders in an incomprehensible German accent. The broadcast of The Lester Guy Show (also the episode's title) is a debacle. At one point, a jealous, gun-wielding husband rushes home to catch his wife with Lester, who has somehow managed to step into a noose and is slowly swinging across the room. \"It's not what you think,\" he croaks. Sure it is: inspired burlesque.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"There was a lot of laughter on the set,\" says Buchanan of the series, which lasted threeepisodes. \"Maybe we were too happy. Everybody I knew on successful shows was miserable.\"\n\n56\n\nTHE GEORGE BURNS AND GRACIE ALLEN SHOW\n\nMarch 29, 1954\n\nIt was a foolproof formula. George was the straightman; Gracie's scatterbrained sense of logic and inability to match pronouns with their antecedents did the rest. Case in point: \"Columbia Pictures Doing Burns & Allen Story.\" The studio wants to make the couple's life stories and sends a team of screenwriters to the house for background. Getting nowhere with Gracie (\"Were you the oldest in the family?\" they ask her. \"No, no. My mother and father were much older\"), they inquire about George's old vaudeville partners. Announcer-pal Harry Von Zell, in all innocence, mentions Jimmy Pierce. \"They worked together several months, then Pierce left George when he got married. George told me he has a wife and four sons in San Diego.\" That's all Gracie has to hear. TV comedy's greatest broken-field runner is off to the races -- certain George is a bigamist.\n\n54\n\nTHE COSBY SHOW\n\nOctober 10, 1985\n\nCliff Huxtable's parents, Russell and Anna (Earle Hyman and Clarice Taylor), are celebrating their 49th wedding anniversary, and Cliff and Clair (Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashad) want to do something nice for them. In \"Happy Anniversary,\" they commission a portrait and surprise the couple with a cruise to Europe. They also throw a dinner party in their Brooklyn brownstone, and after the meal, Cliff and Clair's children, college student Sondra (Sabrina Le Beauf), 16-year-old Denise (Lisa Bonet), 14-year-old Theo (Malcolm-Jamal Warner), wisecracking 8-year-old Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe), and irrepressible 5-year-old Rudy (Keshia Knight Pulliam) join their parents and entertain Grandma and Grandpa by staging an impromptu production number on the stairs, lip-synching favorite tunes such as Ray Charles' \"Night Time Is the Right Time.\" By showing the three generations of Huxtables together, this episode -- heartwarming without being sappy -- made implicit the series' underlying message: Strong, positive children are parents' most important, invaluable legacy.\n\n53\n\nTHE PHIL SILVERS SHOW\n\nNovember 15, 1955\n\nAlways looking for an angle, Master Sgt. Ernie Bilko (Phil Silvers) is delighted when Corporal Ed \"The Stomach\" Honigan transfers into his troop in \"The Eating Contest.\" Bilko quickly arranges a high-stakes eating contest at Fort Baxter. But Honigan -- played hilariously by a boyish, rail-thin Fred Gwynne (in his TV debut) -- eats only when he's miserable, and he's already over the girl from Tulsa who jilted him. This predicament sets Bilko, the unregenerate con man, into his most glorious, manipulative overdrive.\n\n52\n\nGILLIGAN'S ISLAND\n\nOctober 3, 1966\n\nIn \"The Producer,\" Hollywood deal-maker Harold Hecuba (Phil Silvers) is looking for talent in \"out-of-the-way places\" when his plane crashes on our favorite tropical isle. To impress the impresario, the castaways mount a musical version of \"Hamlet\" with Gilligan (Bob Denver) in the title roll. It ain't Shakespeare, but it does get the producer's attention.\n\nHe quickly rechristens it \"Harold Hecuba's Hamlet\" and swipes all the singing parts for himself (a quicksilver bit of shtick for Silvers, above, with cast). At the end of this inventive episode, Hecuba steals away -- and steals the idea -- leaving a sadder but wiser Gilligan to pronounce the moral: \"Well, that's showbiz.\"\n\nTHE BOB NEWHART SHOW\n\nFebruary 12, 1977\n\nAfter a close call in the office elevator shaft, deadpan Bob takes on the panicky manner of his phobic patient Mr. Herd (Oliver Clark). \"Death Be My Destiny,\" a deft blend of the dramatic and daffy, has a great running gag about the correct name of the Grim Reaper, from Uncle Death to Old Father Time. \"I felt icy fingers up and down my spine,\" says Bob of his experience. That wasn't death, wife Emily (Suzanne Pleshette) reassures him. \"That's old Black Magic.\"\n\n48\n\nBEWITCHED\n\nMay 5, 1966\n\nFacing a tight deadline on the Stern Chemical account, overworked adman Darrin Stephens (Dick York) has to cancel a vacation with his beautiful witch of a wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery). Or does he? \"It's a pity you can't take the fun side of him and leave the work side at home,\" ponders Samantha's prankish, Pucci-clad mother, Endora, who promptly splits her son-in-law in two. In an athletic double performance by York, Darrin's hedonistic half becomes a Watusi-ing mass of irresponsibility, while his workaholic half is so all-business he nearly runs client Sanford Stern (Frank Maxwell) and boss Larry Tate (David White) into the ground. \"Divided He Falls\" was so delicious that when Dick Sargent replaced York on the show in 1969, the first episode he filmed was a remake of this one.\n\n47\n\nABSOLUTELY FABULOUS\n\nJuly 24, 1994 (U.S.)\n\n\"Chanel! Dior!…Gaultier, darling! Names, names, names!\" Thus spake Edina (Jennifer Saunders) to Patsy, summarizing the essence of their existences. Not so much victims of fashion as of their own excesses, they are the drunken, drug-soaked detritus of once-swinging London feeding off the rag trade -- Edina as a PR rep, Patsy as a fashion editor. The pilot of this British import sets up Edina's topsy-turvy relationship with her prim daughter (Julia Sawalha): It's Mom who sneaks drinks and drugs behind the teenager's back. Saunders and Lumley are unafraid to look shabby; Edina and Patsy are swaddled in designer labels, but their shriveled souls are laid hilariously bare.\n\n45\n\nCHEERS\n\nSeptember 24, 1987\n\n\"Home Is the Sailor\" begins when Sam Malone (Ted Danson), back from his disastrous attempt to sail around the world, walks into his former bar and barely recognizes it -- most of the regulars are gone. Only Carla (Rhea Perlman) and Woody (Woody Harrelson) are left, uncomfortably outfitted in the polyester uniforms required by Cheers' new owner. Sam wants work, but Carla warns him that the new manager \"eats live sharks for breakfast.\" Enter intoxicating Rebecca Howe, a confident and capable bar belle. Sam brags about his sexual prowess, and she rebuffs him, unable to decide if his lame come-ons are \"disgusting or merely pathetic.\" Sam is momentarily shaken and most definitely stirred. Hey, wait a second, hadn't we already sampled a brew-haha like this? Yeah, but we couldn't wait to be served another round.\n\n3\n\nFRASIER\n\nOctober 4, 1994\n\nDeftly using assumptions about sexuality as grist for farce, \"The Matchmaker\" details a mixed-up first date. Hoping to fix up Daphne (Jane Leeves), Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) invites his station manager, Tom (Eric Lutes), to dinner, unaware he's gay. During the meal, delicately used pronouns fuel Tom's misconception that he's dating Frasier, who misreads Tom's interest for an attraction to Daphne. When Frasier learns the truth, he's stunned. \"What on earth could have made him think I was interested in him?\" he says. \"All I did was ask him if he was attached, and then we talked about the theater and men's fashions.…Oh, my God!\"\n\n42\n\nLEAVE IT TO BEAVER\n\nOctober 11, 1957\n\nThe gentle tone of this definitive '50s series was already set by its second episode, \"Captain Jack.\" Raw eggs, Mom's beauty cream, and Dad's brandy have been disappearing for weeks before June and Ward Cleaver (Hugh Beaumont and Barbara Billingsley) figure out that Wally and \"the Beav\" are hiding something big -- a pet alligator. The suburbs are no place for the scaly beast, however, so Ward and June make the boys return Captain Jack, as the creature is called, to his namesake, a crusty alligator-farm operator (Edgar Buchanan). And rather than grounding Wally and the Beav for getting a gator behind their backs, Ward and June buy their sons a puppy. So much for pet peeves.\n\n40\n\nWKRP IN CINCINNATI\n\nOctober 30, 1978\n\nTV shows traditionally greet holidays with a hug, but not WKRP. In \"Turkeys Away,\" which was based on a true story, station manager Arthur Carlson (Gordon Jump) announces plans to unveil a secret promotional event, and newsman Les Nessman (Richard Sanders) shows up at the local mall to cover it live. A helicopter comes into view. Mr. Carlson is aboard. So are 20 live turkeys -- which, to Les's horror, are hurled to their deaths. \"Oh, the humanity,\" Les wails, evoking the Hindenberg while fowl balls plummet to the parking lot. Mr. Carlson is shocked. \"As God is my witness,\" he says, \"I thought turkeys could fly.\"\n\nREWIND\n\n\"Richard had tapes of the Hindenberg disaster,\" says Loni Anderson, who played Mr. Carlson's secretary, \"and practiced his broadcast to sound real. He was a perfectionist.\"\n\n39\n\nTHE LARRY SANDERS SHOW\n\nNovember 13, 1996\n\nLarry (Garry Shandling) is convinced that upcoming guest David Duchovny has a crush on him. When D.D. sends him a jacket emblazoned \"The Truth Is Out There,\" Larry panics -- until he realizes it's The X-Files' motto. Duchovny, deftly toying with his leading-man status, continues to send mixed signals and progressively unnerve Larry. Finally, Larry confronts his guest, who says he's sorry, he wishes he were gay because he finds Larry so attractive. The truth is out there: \"Everybody Loves Larry,\" which also features a subplot about Hank (Jeffrey Tambor) feuding with singer Elvis Costello over a sports car, is a standout, even by Sanders' perfect-pitch standards.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"I'm supposed to be this racing-car guy,\" says Costello, \"but I didn't even learn to drive a car till I was 35, which I know is completely unbelievable to Americans: Don't you learn to drive when you're, like, 9?\"\n\n38\n\nMY SO-CALLED LIFE\n\nNovember 10, 1994\n\nA far cry from Happy Days, this series took on the anguish and anticipation of high school in the '90s. \"Life of Brian\" begins with a dance. No one wants to go. Everyone wants to go. Geeky Brian (Devon Gummersall) wants to ask Angela (Claire Danes). She wants to go with cool Jordan (Jared Leto). Rickie (Wilson Cruz), who's gay, has a crush on Corey (Adam Biesk), who likes Rayanne (A.J. Langer). But the counselor doesn't think Rayanne, who has a drug problem, should go. It's sad and embarrassing, like high school if you're still in it, and hilarious, which is what high school becomes after you've survived it.\n\n37\n\nTHE BRADY BUNCH\n\nDecember 10, 1971\n\nHey! Hey! She's a Brady -- and the president of her local Davy Jones fan club. Marcia cockily promises to get the singer to play at the prom. She and her sibs try several subterfuges, and she finally gets her man. She even gets to peck his cheek. The unstated joke, of course, is the show's choice of teen idols. The Monkees had split up two years earlier, and Jones was desperately trying to jump-start a solo career. But that sense of terminal unhipness -- filtered through Marcia's sunny personality -- is precisely why we love The Brady Bunch, and especially \"Getting Davy Jones.\"\n\n35\n\nELLEN\n\nApril 30, 1997\n\nEllen (Ellen DeGeneres) is getting ready for a date. Finally, Paige (Joely Fisher) asks through the door, \"Ellen, are you coming out or not?\" Indeed, Ellen's coming out to her therapist (Oprah Winfrey) and Susan was actually three years in the making and cause for much media hype. But what distinguishes this hour-long show, dubbed \"The Puppy Episode\" to keep its plot secret, is some of the sharpest comedy TV can offer. When an offended Ellen accuses Susan of recruiting her to homosexuality, Susan says, \"I'll have to call national headquarters and tell 'em I lost you. Damn -- just one more, and I would have gotten that toaster oven!\" And after Ellen accidentally blurts \"I'm gay\" over a loudspeaker, she says, \"That felt so great -- and it felt so loud.\" It sure did.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"For a lot of people, this was like Jackie Robinson in the major leagues,\" says David Anthony Higgins, who plays Ellen's coworker Joe. \"I feel like, in my tiny part, I kind of made a little television history.\"\n\n34\n\nMOONLIGHTING\n\nOctober 15, 1985\n\nHosted by Orson Welles, who died just five days before it aired, this stylized, mostly black-and-white episode of Moonlighting blended the series' trademark banter and sexual tension with an unusual homage to film noir. In \"The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice,\" a visit to a once-hot nightspot prompts Maddie and David to dream their own versions of an old, unsolved murder. In Maddie's mind, her songbird character falls for David's horn-blowing charmer, who schemes to kill her husband; his version paints him as the innocent, framed by a conniving woman. In both dreams they make love, something that would remain merely fantasy for the characters for another two years.\n\n33\n\nSEINFELD\n\nOctober 30, 1991\n\nIn this series that set the TV industry on its ear by boasting, proudly and subversively, that it was \"about nothing,\" \"The Parking Garage\" is the ultimate nothing episode. Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer can't find their car in a mall parking garage and walk around looking for it. That's it. But we've come to know the idiosyncrasies and neuroses of these characters so well that we enjoy seeing them splash down in the shallow pond of a minor dilemma and sink to the bottom, while arguing about the best stroke to use to get to shore. It's theater of the absurd: \"Four Characters in Search of an Exit Ramp.\" The whole requires remarkable writing and acting, and a pact with the audience never to take anything too seriously. That's not nothing -- that's everything.\n\n29\n\nTHE WONDER YEARS\n\nMarch 29, 1988\n\nNo series captured that tender, awkward waltz of the father-son relationship better, and especially in \"My Father's Office,\" as it asks: What does my father do on the job, and why does he come home so grumpy? To find out, Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) accompanies his dad (Dan Lauria) to work. There, as Kevin thrills to his dad's command and power, the boss rips his father to mortifying shreds. Later, as the Arnold men gaze at the suburban night sky, Kevin has a bittersweet realization: This wasn't at all what his dad wanted to be when he grew up. It's enough to make you cry…every time.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"Fred came up with the funniest thing,\" recalls Lauria. \"When I walked into the house all mad, he followed in right behind me the same way. Everyone fell on the floor!\"\n\n27\n\nTHE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW\n\nSeptember 15, 1973\n\nThe Twin Cities become the Sin Cities when Betty White makes her MTM debut in \"The Lars Affair\" as Sue Ann Nivens, the Happy Homemaker. Actually, happy home wrecker is more like it. Invited to one of Mary's classically disastrous parties, the ever-smiling Sue Ann offers her hostess some cleaning tips, then sweeps up Phyllis's never-seen dermatologist husband, Lars, and leaves the party with him. Mary and Rhoda (Valerie Harper) are baffled -- Sue Ann, after all, is an unlikely seductress. In fact, she's exactly the sort of woman you'd leave for someone else. But Phyllis (Cloris Leachman) has the perfect explanation for her husband's unfaithfulness: her own inexhaustible feminine allure. \"I've been too much of a real woman,\" she declares. In the '70s, adultery was not an issue frequently handled on television, certainly not on a sitcom, but this cheating heart was served up with wit and style.\n\n26\n\nTHE HONEYMOONERS\n\nOctober 1, 1955\n\nAlice (Audrey Meadows) is dying to have a TV set. But cheapskate Ralph (Jackie Gleason) lamely claims he's holding off until 3-D TV is developed. He finally agrees to go in halfsies with Norton, rigging a coin toss so the set stays in the Kramden apartment. No sooner is the set plugged in than Ralph becomes a total zombie to the new medium, the very archetype of the couch potato: scientifically determining (in a priceless piece of physical comedy) exactly where to place his snack food so no effort is required to reach it; fighting with Norton, who wants to sit in front of the set with his space helmet on to watch Captain Video; and finally falling asleep with the tube on. \"TV or Not TV\" was the first episode in The Honeymooners' one and only season. All 38 shows that came after met its brilliantly simple, hilarious standard.\n\n24\n\nTHE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW\n\nSeptember 30, 1963\n\nThis series was at its down-home best when it focused on the sweet relationship between Sheriff Taylor (Griffith) and Opie (Ron Howard), a bond endearingly explored in \"Opie the Birdman.\" After accidentally killing a mother bird with his slingshot, Opie dutifully raises her three nestlings until they are big enough to fly. After releasing them, Opie sadly notes how empty their cage looks. \"It sure does,\" answers his proud and knowing pa as he watches the birds swoop skyward, \"but don't the trees seem nice and full?\" And aren't our lives nicer and fuller for having dallied in Mayberry?\n\n21\n\nROSEANNE\n\nOctober 5, 1993\n\nWhen Roseanne finds a baggieful of pot in one of the kids' rooms, she's angry -- and worried about how Dan (John Goodman) is going to react. (He has been in a foul mood since being promoted to foreman.) He does go ballistic -- until he realizes the stash is a 20-year-old relic of his and Roseanne's youth. Inevitably, they roll a joint for old times' sake, and before you can say \"Like, wow,\" Dan, Roseanne, and her sister, Jackie (Laurie Metcalf), are adrift in a Cheech-and-Chong time warp. At first, they have fun sneaking around like they did in the '70s, hoping not to get busted by their children. But then adult realities stick a sharp pin in their buzz. \"A Stash From the Past\" is a wise, waggish, and exceedingly daring episode from a sitcom renowned for its unflinching audacity.\n\n20\n\nM*A*S*H\n\nMarch 18, 1975\n\nIf war is hell, the staff of the M*A*S*H 4077th unit was in the inferno's innermost circle. In \"Abyssinia, Henry,\" the hospital's beloved commander, Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), is going home to his family in Illinois. After a night of wine, wontons, and song, and a touching good-bye with his surrogate son, Radar, Henry takes off on a plane that is shot down over the Sea of Japan. When Radar stumbles into the operating theater with the news, it is a shattering moment -- a measure of just how precious these characters had become to us.\n\n19\n\nTAXI\n\nMay 21, 1981\n\nPoor Latka -- sick and tired of being the lovable, but lonely, grease monkey at the Sunshine Cab Co. All he wants is to become \"an American fun guy taking each day in high gear\" -- which for him would require inventing a whole new type of transmission. And that's just what he does. Laden with copies of Playboy and a tape of a smooth-talking FM DJ, Latka (Andy Kaufman) goes off \"to alter my lifestyle to fit the fast lane.\" He returns with a flashy new lounge-lizard alter ego: Vic Ferrari -- slick, suave, oversexed, and beyond obnoxious. Showing off Kaufman's genius for utilizing multiple personalities (Latka started out as Foreign Man, one of Kaufman's uncanny comedy-club guises), \"Latka the Playboy\" was an inventive, outrageous episode that led to equally imaginative sequels -- and even more splintering of Latka's breakaway ego. Sharp-eyed viewers will notice a pre-Cheers George Wendt in a bit part as an exterminator in this wonderful episode.\n\n18\n\nI LOVE LUCY\n\nApril 16, 1956\n\nWe could describe this episode as the one in which the famous redhead gets into trouble trying to break into show business. But that synopsis would cover almost every I Love Lucy. So let's amend things to say that in this outing Lucy gets into a bunch of trouble. On the train to Rome, site of one of Ricky's European gigs, Lucy is spied by an Italian movie producer who thinks she'd be perfect for a role in his new film, \"Bitter Grapes.\" Determined to research her role, Lucy hies herself to a vineyard where she's assigned the job of stomping grapes. That leads to some uproariously funny folk-dance moves -- and a near stomping by her testy co-worker. \"Lucy's Italian Movie\" is a vat of fun, stirred up by Ball's inimitable, extravagant flair for slapstick.\n\n17\n\nTHE SIMPSONS\n\nApril 15, 1990\n\nA Simpsons episode très extraordinaire! Principal Skinner ships Bart off to France as an exchange student because of a cherry-bomb-in-the-toilet incident. (\"I have a weakness for the classics,\" the young vandal explains.) This allows The Simpsons' creative team to deal with a few classics of their own, as Bart rides through a French countryside that looks suspiciously like famous paintings, one after another. \"We had to figure out a way to draw those paintings in a Simpson style,\" recalls director Wes Archer. That eye-popping sequence helped push this episode past all the other crackerjack Simpsons clamoring for a spot on this roster. Even without it, \"The Crepes of Wrath\" is more savory than Provençal cuisine, as Bart is enslaved by his wine-making sponsors while, back home, an Albanian exchange student-spy relieves Homer of countless nuclear secrets. And while foiling a plot to lace the Beaujolais with anti-freeze, Bart discovers he can speak fluent French! Incroyable! \"The Crepes of Wrath\" is vintage Simpsons.\n\n15\n\nTHE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW\n\nFebruary 6, 1963\n\nOf The Dick Van Dyke Show's characters, Rob Petrie was the one who usually kept his head, while Sally, Buddy, Laura, and Mel were losing theirs all around him. That's a big part of the appeal of this utterly surreal episode, in which Rob seems to be losing not just his head but his imagination -- and both his thumbs. He stays up late one night watching a thriller about an alien from the planet Twilo who wants to take over the world. The extraterrestrial has eyes in the back of his head, eats walnuts, speaks with a British accent, and looks just like Danny Thomas -- in fact, the creature is played by Thomas himself, who, insiders know, co-owned the company that created The Dick Van Dyke Show. People who are exposed to Absorbitron, a chemical the alien possesses, lose their thumbs and their imaginations. When Rob wakes up the next morning, he finds the living-room carpet strewn with walnuts. In the kitchen, a smiling Laura (Mary Tyler Moore) opens an egg carton and offers him a walnut omelette for breakfast. At work, Buddy (Morey Amsterdam) is eating walnuts, not his usual pistachios, and there are walnuts in Rob's typewriter. Is Rob, pardon the expression, cracking up? He thinks so -- until he wakes up from his nutty nightmare. Seventeen-hundred walnuts were used in \"It May Look Like a Walnut\"; the ones that didn't open on cue were sent back, and that is what executive producer Sheldon Leonard wanted to do with the extravagant script when he first read it. But when Leonard saw how well the inventive walnut episode played in front of an audience, he gave it the thumbs-up.\n\n14\n\nWISEGUY\n\nFebruary 22, 1988\n\nOn its surface, Wiseguy was just one more action show created by Stephen J. Cannell (Hunter, The A-Team), this one about undercover Fed Vinnie Terranova. But the series pioneered an unusual structure: multiepisode arcs that unfolded like miniseries within the series. Over the weeks, viewers, like Vinnie, came to know and even identify with the bad guys, sharing the peculiar intimacy the undercover agent has with his quarry. Wiseguy was about the seductiveness of evil, and rarely has evil been more appealing than in the form of sinister siblings Mel and Susan Profitt. Played with almost gleeful intensity by Spacey, Mel runs guns, topples governments, shoots dope, believes in the power of crystals, and admires 19th-century economist Thomas Malthus -- as well as his own sexy sister (Severance). In \"Blood Dance,\" Mel cracks when an agent shatters the crystal he believes harbors his soul. \"Send me home,\" he begs his sis. She obliges, giving him a drug overdose and a Viking funeral.\n\n13\n\nALL IN THE FAMILY\n\nFebruary 19, 1972\n\nSix months before Sammy Davis Jr. hugged Richard Nixon at the Republican National Convention, he kissed America's most lovable bigot. Davis's guest appearance raised the groundbreaking sitcom's level of racial repartee to new heights. In \"Sammy's Visit,\" Davis comes to Archie Bunker's home to retrieve a briefcase he left in Archie's cab. The script captures the mixed feelings someone like Davis might elicit from someone like Archie: Respect (Archie lets Davis sit in his chair) and awkwardness (the classic gaffe, \"Do you take cream and sugar in your eye?\") mingle with prejudice (Archie refuses to drink a toast from a glass that has touched Davis's lips). \"If you were prejudiced, you'd go around thinking you're better than anyone else in the world, Archie,\" says Davis. \"But I can honestly say you've proven to me that you ain't better than anybody!\" This dis is followed by that kiss -- planted on a startled Archie. Davis, incidentally, was a huge AITF fan; he considered his guest shot here as thrilling as his first big break in showbiz.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"I loved the statement this episode made,\" recalls Jean Stapleton, who played Archie's wife, Edith. \"Sammy Davis Jr. was great. I've always had doubts about the use of a real-life person in a fictitious story, in terms of playwriting. But the whole thing worked, and that surprised me and opened my mind.\"\n\n12\n\nFAWLTY TOWERS\n\n1980 (U.S.)\n\nOne of the rock-ribbed rules of American programming is: Nobody wants to watch a show about someone who isn't likable. (This is sometimes called the Dabney Coleman rule, after the actor who has had a few critically acclaimed but low-rated sitcoms about less-than-admirable characters.) Thus it falls to the British to give us an Absolutely Fabulous (see number 47) or a Fawlty Towers. Basil Fawlty -- the English innkeeper cocreated and portrayed by Monty Python alumnus John Cleese in 1975 (the U.S. debut came in 1980) -- is definitely not likable. He is, in fact, sly, sarcastic, suspicious, rude, raging, and resentful, particularly of his wife, Sybil (Prunella Scales). When Sybil starts a three-day hospital stay for an ingrown toenail -- coinciding with the arrival of German guests -- Fawlty's faults run riot in an achingly funny episode. \"The Germans,\" which includes a talking moose head and a fire that breaks out during a fire drill, climaxes when Basil gets a concussion and cannot follow his own urgent advice to the inn's staff about their new guests: \"Don't mention the war!\" Not only does the befogged Fawlty mention it, but he launches into a hysterical Hitler impression; and the unforgettable sight of the 6'5'' Cleese goose-stepping through Fawlty Towers and shrieking in mock German puts \"The Germans\" high in our pantheon.\n\n9\n\nTHE BOB NEWHART SHOW\n\nNovember 22, 1975\n\n\"Over the River and Through the Woods,\" the craziest Bob Newhart Show episode of all time, begins sanely enough: Emily (Suzanne Pleshette) announces her intention to visit her family in Puget Sound over the Thanksgiving holiday; psychiatrist Bob begs off, saying he wants to be available to his neurotic patient, the endlessly depressed and depressing Mr. Carlin. But Carlin can't be happy unless he's making others miserable, so he invites himself over to watch football with Bob, Jerry (Bonerz), and ever-present neighbor Howard (Daily). Of course, there are certain customs that must be observed. \"We take a slug of this every time the other team scores,\" says Jerry, offering an enormous jug of grain alcohol to Bob. Soon things get loco; it's a high-scoring game. Smashed, starving, and facing a frozen turkey, the boys consider cooking the bird at 2,000 degrees for a half hour -- but the oven only heats to 500. \"Then we'll use four ovens,\" suggests Howard. That's when they decide to call out for Chinese food -- to be precise, for Moo Goo Gai Pan (to be more precise, for Moo Goo Goo Goo Gai Pan). And lots of it. So much that it has to be delivered with a hand truck. Luckily for Bob, Emily arrives just in time to pick up the tab -- and put on a pot of coffee.\n\n8\n\nTHE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW\n\nSeptember 15, 1965\n\nHistory's three best-kept secrets were the location of King Solomon's mines (never disclosed), the plans for D day (made manifest on June 6, 1944), and the fact that Alan Brady wore a toupee, which suddenly became common knowledge when Laura Petrie accidentally blabbed it to a national audience as a contestant on the \"Pay As You Go\" TV game show. Big oops. \"What do you think Alan will do?\" asks a quivery lipped, impeccably coiffed Laura (Mary Tyler Moore). \"It's not what,\" replies her stammering husband and possibly soon-to-be-ex-Brady employee Rob (Dick Van Dyke), \"but how.\" And indeed, in the bright, witty, Emmy-winning script for \"Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth\" that kicked off this magical series' fifth and final season, hell hath no fury like an egomaniacal TV star who's had the rug pulled out from over him. Series creator Carl Reiner, in one of his 12 appearances as Brady, is incensed and cutting, especially when addressing a desktop of heads, each sporting one of his wigs: \"Fellas,\" says Reiner (who revealed his own baldness in this episode), \"there she is -- there's the little lady who put you out of business.\" More than 30 years after it aired, \"Big Mouth,\" a caustic meditation on male vanity and office etiquette, is still one of the most precise, cohesive, and funny half hours of TVever produced.\n\n7\n\nCHEERS\n\nNovember 27, 1986\n\nIn \"Thanksgiving Orphans,\" the holiday is looming, and most of the Cheers gang has nowhere to go. Diane's solution is simple: Why don't they gather at Carla's house? \"What could be more enjoyable than opening your heart with holiday cheer?\" she asks. Carla (Rhea Perlman) responds, \"Opening yours with a can opener?\" Nevertheless, Woody (Woody Harrelson), Frasier (Kelsey Grammer), and Cliff (John Ratzenberger) agree to spend the holiday with Carla. As the afternoon wears on, they're joined by Sam (Ted Danson), Diane (Shelley Long), and Norm, who arrives with \"birdzilla,\" a turkey so huge it takes all day to cook. Before this episode ends, nerves will fray, and the famished guests -- arguably the most adept sitcom ensemble ever cobbled together -- will indulge in the funniest food fight in TV history. The final arrival at the party is Norm's never-seen wife, Vera -- who winds up getting smacked in the kisser with a pie just before we catch sight of her face.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"Throwing food is the most fun that you can possibly have,\" Perlman says of Carla's chuck-and-duck feast. \"I don't know why we don't throw it at each other all the time. The world would be a better place.\"\n\n6\n\nTHE HONEYMOONERS\n\nJanuary 28, 1956\n\nRalph Kramden's get-rich-quick schemes were a Honeymooners staple, but the pipe dream in \"The $99,000 Answer\" may be the funniest. The episode plays off the then-popular mania for quiz shows: Convinced beyond all reason that he will triumph on The $99,000 Answer, popular-music expert Ralph intensely prepares at home, aided by piano-playing pal Ed Norton (Art Carney), who warms up for each song with a few bars of \"Swanee River.\" Of course, the second he's on live TV, Ralph's bravado vanishes. Going into the classic Kramden meltdown -- the eyes bugging, the lips quivering, the tongue stuttering \"humminahummina\" -- he identifies the composer of \"Swanee River\" as Norton before being escorted off-stage, reduced to an object of pure pity. Unlike most Honeymooners episodes, there's no redemption, no \"Baby, you're the greatest\" clinch with wife Alice. Of course, no actor could shift from humor to poignancy as deftly as Gleason.\n\n5\n\nTHE ODD COUPLE\n\nDecember 1, 1972\n\nThe password is \"hilarious.\" Felix Unger and Oscar Madison were always perfectly mismatched. The two men -- one a neurotic neatnik, the other a compulsive slob -- had absolutely nothing in common except a Manhattan apartment. In \"Password,\" Felix (Tony Randall) and Oscar (Jack Klugman) make the worst team since oil and water. The popular game-show host Allen Ludden is a fan of Oscar's sports columns, and approaches him to be a celebrity panelist playing against Ludden's real-life wife, Betty White.\n\nFelix is ecstatic; he can be his roommate's partner. Oscar takes some convincing -- first to be on the show and then to be on it with Felix -- but he finally agrees. As bad choices go, this is right up there with Lincoln's decision to go to Ford's Theater. Speaking of the Great Emancipator, during one match, Felix hears the word mayonnaise and comes back with \"Lincoln.\" Lincoln? Lincoln? As Felix explains, it's a well-known fact that Lincoln loved mayonnaise. The pair's utter failure to com-municate finds its fullest, most sidesplitting expression in this sparkling episode.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"Hearing Jack and Tony talk to each other off-camera was hysterical,\" recalls White. \"They both barked at each other in a grumpy way. You'd think they were fighting, but it was just small talk.\"\n\n4\n\nSEINFELD\n\nFebruary 12, 1992\n\nHow do we treasure \"The Boyfriend\"? Let us count the ways. This is the episode in which Jerry \"dates\" former New York Mets first baseman Keith Hernandez but eventually loses him to Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus); in which George (Jason Alexander) tries to get an extension on his unemployment benefits by fabricating a bogus job selling \"latex and latex-related products\"; in which Kramer (Michael Richards) ruins George's scam by forgetting to answer the phone as \"Vandelay Industries,\" forcing George to come scurrying out of the bathroom with his pants around his ankles; in which George sinks so low he even dates his caseworker's ugly daughter to ensure that his benefits continue; in which a pair of pixilated new parents keep nagging Jerry and Kramer, \"You gotta see the baby\"; in which Jerry sneers \"Hello, Newman\" for the first time; in which Kramer and Newman (Wayne Knight) unveil their own conspiracy theory in a brazen satire of the J.F.K./Zapruder film. Just about every other current TV comedy prays that it could come up in its entire run with as many time-capsule highlights as this single, one-hour episode contains. Seinfeld makes this funny, smart, ingenious, and risk-taking hour look effortless.\n\nREWIND\n\n\"I was so nervous in front of a live audience,\" says Hernandez. \"The cast was like, 'Why are you nervous? You have to get up in front of 50,000 people with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth.' But doing that show was very nerve-racking.\"\n\n3\n\nER\n\nMarch 9, 1995\n\nSure, we know it's just actors speaking lines from a script on a soundstage.…But tell that to your pounding heart and explain it to your rocketing blood pressure and your dry throat and your panting lungs. After the explosive, almost-too-painful-to-watch \"Love's Labor Lost\" -- perhaps the most riveting, harrowing, and visceral hour of medical drama ever aired -- we all could use a stay in the recovery room. What seems like a routine day in the ER -- gunshot wounds, hemorrhoids, a guy who tries to remove one of his tattoos with a power sander -- turns sour for Dr. Mark Greene. Normally a steady hand at the throttle of the racing locomotive that is the ER, Greene derails: Distracted by personal and professional problems, he misdiagnoses a pregnant woman and begins a downward spiral of missteps and questionable procedures that continues until all present are in over their heads, panic is thick in the air, and, just as in real life, bad things happen to good people -- with shocking speed. Edwards' performance in this unforgettably scorching episode is his best work in this extraordinary series.\n\n2\n\nI LOVE LUCY\n\nMay 5, 1952\n\nFittingly, the show is pure Lucy -- sidekick Ethel (Vivian Vance) doesn't even have a cameo. As the Vitameatavegamin Girl on a TV variety show, Lucy Ricardo is supposed to \"spoon her way to health,\" but instead gets totally snockered on the health elixir she's promoting. In the classic \"Lucy Does a TV Commercial,\" Ball's talent for physical comedy is at its most vibrant and resourceful. Using her usual treachery to get the job, Lucy begins to run through her spot for the director (Ross Elliot). From the first spoonful she squeamishly swallows to her early, slightly sloshed queries -- \"Do you pop out at parties? Are you unpoopular?\" -- to her final drunken swig right out of the \"bittle lottle,\" Ball builds the mirth to a riotous climax. After mangling the product's name in every imaginable way, Lucy finally resorts to calling it \"this stuff.\" By any name, this heady concoction continues to make \"happy, peppy people\" of us all.\n\n1\n\nTHE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW\n\nOctober 25, 1975\n\nOne little miscalculation can just ruin your whole day. Take Chuckles the Clown, WJM-TV's kiddie-show host. Named grand marshal of the circus parade, he shows up dressed as Peter Peanut, and, as news director Lou Grant (Ed Asner) later explains to his troops, \"a rogue elephant tried to shell him.\" And so begins \"Chuckles Bites the Dust,\" unquestionably the best remembered, most discussed, most supremely influential episode of all time. Chuckles' nutty demise becomes the source of dark jokes for everyone in the office -- except somber Mary, who can't see the absurdity of the incident, the humor in the clown's passing…until the funeral when, in a sublime example of poor timing, it suddenly hits her during the eulogy. Surrounded by stony-faced mourners, striving to maintain proper decorum, squirming for control, trying to cover her giggles with coughs and throat clearings, Mary, finally lets loose. Surprisingly, the preacher encourages her unseemly outburst as something the deceased would have wanted. No sooner does he say, \"So go ahead, my dear, laugh for Chuckles,\" than Mary breaks down in tears. This unforeseen final twist, and Moore's bravura bipolar performance, make this exquisite episode a sitcom landmark and proof positive that TV can explore a social taboo with sophistication, wit, irreverence, and impeccable good taste.\n\nREWIND \"During rehearsals,\" recalls Moore, \"I cracked up every time I had to refer to one of Chuckles' characters: Mr. Fe-Fi-Fo. That would have confused the audience terribly. We didn't know right up until the camera was on if I was going to be able to pull it off without laughing.\"\n\nBack to the top\n\nor, you could go back to...\n\nJim's home page"
