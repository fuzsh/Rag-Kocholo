        "text": "LOVE, AMERICAN STYLE\n\nComedy Anthology\n\nFIRST TELECAST: September 29, 1969\n\nLAST TELECAST: January 11, 1974\n\nThis imaginative anthology was a collection of short comedy playlets, starring all sorts of big names, and dealing with the all-important subject of love. Love was seen from all sides, young and old, rich and poor, unmarried and married, long married, and multi-married. Generally three or four playlets were presented on each episode, interspersed with short comic \"blackouts\" by a repertory company of six or seven young performers (including, throughout the show's run, Mary Grover, Stuart Margolin, Buzz Cooper, Barbara Minkus, Bill Callaway, Lynne Marta, Tracy Reed, Phyllis Davis, Jaki De Mar, Richard Williams, Jim Hampton, Jim Davis, James A. Watson, Jr., and Jed Allen). In 1972 a tasteful \"Lovemate of the Week\" centerfold was added, featuring a different girl each week.\n\nA short list of those appearing in Love, American Style reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood: Phyllis Diller, Nanette Fabray, Tammy Grimes, Ann Southern, Paul Ford, Pat Paulsen, Milton Berle, Sonny & Cher, the Lennon Sisters, George Gobel, Dorothy Lamour, Wally Cox, Tony Randall, Paul Lynde, Burt Reynolds, Harry Morgan, Rich Little, Ozzy & Harriet, Tiny Tim (as a suspected vampire), Sid Ceasar, Imogene Coca, Jacqueline Susann, and Martha Raye. Ronnie Howard and Anson Williams appeared in a skit entitled \"Love and the Happy Day,\" which served as the pilot for the hit series, Happy Days.\n\nThe first telecast, on September 28, 1969, was typical of the show's format. Act I, \"Love and a Couple of Couples\": Michael Callan is a suitor about to propose when his ex-wife turns up, spies the ring, tries it on -- and can't get it off. Act II, \"Love and the Hustler\": Flip Wilson is pool shark \"Big Red,\" who undertakes to instruct a young lady in the fine points of the game. Act III, \"Love and the Pill\": Bob Cummings and Jane Wyatt are parents worried about their daughter's plans to embark on a \"swinger's tour\" of Europe with her boyfriend.\n\nLove, American Style reruns were seen in ABC daytime from June 1971 to May 1974.\n\nAn updated series of romantic vignettes, titled New Love, American Style, was produced for ABC's week-day daytime lineup more than a decade later, running from December 1985 to August 1986.\n\nLove, American Style reruns were seen in ABC daytime from June 1971 to May 1974.

Both programs consisted each week of several short comic sketches dealing with love of all types, young and old, married and unmarried, and both featured famous guest stars in the sketches. The difference was that all of Love Boat's stories were set aboard the Pacific Princess, a luxury cruise ship which embarked each week on a romantic, sentimental and often hilarious voyage across tropic seas. The three or four stories told on each telecast were thus interwoven and often involved the ship's crew, consisting of Captain Merrill Stubing (Gavin MacLeod), Dr. Adam Bricker (Bernie Kopell), yeoman \"Gopher\" Smith (Fred Grandy), bartender Isaac Washington (Ted Lange), and cruise director Julie McCoy (Lauren Tewes), who were seen on the show every week.\n\nAmong those appearing in guest roles were many TV and movie favorites, including Raymond Burr, Pearl Bailey, Steve Allen, Ethel Merman, Jane Wyman, Don Adams, Helen Hayes, Mildred Natwick, and Dick Van Patten. Some stories revolved around the crew, with Capt. Stubing's womanizing brother Marshall (also played by MacLeod) showing up on occasion, and Vicki (Jill Whelan), Stubing's 12-year-old daughter by a past girl friend, becoming a regular cast member in 1979.\n\nThe Love Boat was filmed on two real cruise ships, the Pacific Princess and the Island Princess, during their regular voyages from the Virgin Islands to Alaska. Paying passengers were invited to participate as extras, getting a raffle ticket for each day they \"worked.\" Most passengers were delighted to take part, and cruises on which filming was planned were always booked solid long in advance.\n\nIn the spring of 1986, at the end of the original series run, Capt. Stubing romanced and married Emily Heywood (Marion Ross). A number of new two-hour Love Boat specials were aired during the following season.\n\nThe series was based on Jeraldine Saunders' book The Love Boat (written about her experiences as a cruise hostess), and first aired as a series of specials during the 1976-1977 season. ABC aired reruns of The Love Boat on weekday mornings from June 1980 to June 1983.

Dishell, M.D.\n\nTHEME: \"Suicide Is Painless,\" by Johnny Mandel\n\nIn 1972 America was still embroiled in a lingering war in Vietnam, a war that had polarized the population. The climate created by an unpopular war was the perfect environment for an antiwar comedy like M*A*S*H. The setting was different, Korea in the early 1950s, but the stories and situations could just as easily have been from Vietnam in the 1970s.\n\nThe cast and characters of M*A*S*H were all members of the 4077th M obile A rmy S urgical H ospital, stationed behind the lines during the Korean War. Their job was to treat the wounded being sent to them from the front lines and to try to save as many lives as possible. The environment was depressing; many of the doctors (who had all been drafted) could not really believe they were living under the conditions to which they were being subjected. There was an overwhelming sense of the futility and insanity of war that permeated their daily lives. A certain sense of humor was necessary for survival.\n\nMost of the senior members of the M.A.S.H. unit had wives and families back home, but that never stopped them from propositioning every good-looking nurse they could con into their quarters. After all, they did need something to alleviate the depression that resulted from contact with a constant stream of maimed and dying young G.I.'s. Two of the surgeons were Capt. Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce (Alan Alda) and Capt. John \"Trapper John\" McIntyre (Wayne Rogers). Like virtually everyone else, they were always breaking regulations. Hawkeye, despite his escapades, was probably the most intellectual of the doctors and was sometimes seen musing on the dehumanizing nature of war and questioning its moral validity.\n\nAmong others who were featured was Maj. Frank Burns (Larry Linville), who was possibly the worst doctor in the unit, and the constant butt of practical jokes perpetrated by Hawkeye and Trapper because of his arrogance and his feigned adherence to military regulations. Maj. Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan (Loretta Swit) was the head nurse who, despite her admonitions to both her nurses and the doctors about fooling around with each other, had been having an affair with Frank Burns for an extended period. Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), the commanding officer whose prime concern was the work of the doctors in the operating room, couldn't care less about what they did during their free time. Cpl. Walter \"Radar\" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff) was the extremely shy and bumbling young aide to Col. Blake. There were also numerous nurses who came and went, with the same actress being referred to in different episodes by different names -- a large number of actresses were collectively called Nurse Able and Nurse Baker. Dr. Sidney Freedman (Allan Arbus), an army psychiatrist, made sporadic visits to the 4077th M.A.S.H. to check on the mental condition of the staff.\n\nThere were changes in the cast over the years. The most significant addition was that of Cpl. Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr), an aide to the doctors in the operating room. There was nothing really wrong with him; it was just that he always dressed in women's clothing in a desperate, though futile, attempt to get himself discharged as mentally unfit. McLean Stevenson left the series in the spring of 1975, to sign a long-term contract with NBC, and his character, Col. Blake, was written out of the show in the last episode of the 1974-75 season (he was discharged and on his way home, only to have the plane in which he was flying go down in the Sea of Japan). He was replaced by Col. Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan), who was somewhat more sardonic and definitely less silly than his predecessor. In the summer of 1975 Wayne Rogers also left the series, in a contract dispute; his character, Trapper, got a discharge and returned home at the beginning of the 1975-76 season. Capt. B.J. Hunnicut (Mike Farrell) replaced Trapper as Hawkeye's tentmate and co-conspirator.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1977-78 season Larry Linville left, and so Major Burns was written out of the series. Having seen his love affair with Hot Lips end when she married Lt. Col. Donald Penobscott, Frank abruptly went AWOL and was permanently transferred. Replacing him was an aristocratic Bostonian, Maj. Charles Emerson Winchester (David Ogden Stiers). Hot Lips' marriage to Col. Penobscott, who was not stationed with the 4077th and who was virtually never seen with his wife after the honeymoon, ended in divorce during the 1978-79 season. Gary Burghoff, the only member of the cast who had played the same role in the movie version of M*A*S*H, departed in the fall of 1979. His character, clairvoyant company clerk Radar O'Reilly, received his discharge and returned to the States. Cpl. Klinger, after a rocky start, settled in as the new company clerk.\n\nThe series finale, a highly anticipated, two-and-a-half-hour episode entitled \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen,\" aired on February 28, 1983, to one of the largest audiences in the history of television. We learn the end of the war is only hours away, but the casualties keep coming in. Finally, the surgical teams learn of the immediate cease-fire as they operate on a group of desperately wounded soldiers and civilians. The war is over.\n\nAt the noisy, joyful camp party that night, members of the company talk about their lives after the war. Col. Potter looks forward to becoming a semi-retired country doctor. Hot Lips declares she has opted for the States and a big city hospital. Klinger announces his engagement to a local Korean girl and says that he is staying in Korea to help find her parents. Charles is going back to Boston; devoted family man B.J., of course, wants to go home, yet refuses to actually say \"goodbye\" to the others. And Hawkeye? Perhaps, after all, he will not be going to the big city surgical post that he always dreamed of.\n\nAfter Klinger and his new bride leave the camp in traditional Korean style, the other members of the company depart one by one. By now, the camp is a ghost town. Father Mulcahy (William Christopher) leaves to start a new life ministering to the deaf. Hot Lips is kissed and hugged. Charles himself exits with a company sergeant in a garbage truck. Col. Potter takes his beloved horse Sophie for one last ride before she is adopted by the orphanage. Finally, B.J. and Hawkeye go together on B.J.'s motorbike to meet Hawkeye's chopper. As Hawkeye looks down over the desolate camp, he sees a message B.J. has left on the pad: a \"GOODBYE\" marked out in stone.\n\nSome members of the 4077th -- Col. Potter, Klinger, Father Mulcahy -- would meet again in a sequel the following fall, called AfterMASH.\n\nM*A*S*H was based on the hit motion picture of the same name, which in turn was taken from the novel. The novel had been written by a doctor who had actually served in one of the Korean War M.A.S.H. units, but who used a pseudonym -- Richard Hooker -- in writing, so as not to compromise his medical standing by his revelations. Reruns of M*A*S*H aired on CBS' weekday lineup from September 1978 to September 1979.

Prison had been a particularly distasteful experience for a man of his background, and had left him with a strong sense of concern for personal freedom and individual rights. Once released, he put his talents as an illusionist and escape artist to use helping people in danger and preventing crimes. Syndicated columnist and novelist Max Pomeroy (Keene Curtis) was a close friend of Tony's and was often responsible for bringing him cases. Max's paraplegic son, Dennis (Todd Crespi) although confined to a wheelchair, also became involved in the cases, as did Jerry Wallace (Jim Watkins), the pilot of Tony's private airliner, The Spirit.\n\nWhen the series moved to Monday nights in January 1974, Tony had taken up residence at Hollywood's famous Magic Castle, where many of the most renowned magicians in the world performed, and some of them were seen on this show. The magic acts performed by Blake were also genuine: Bill Bixby himself was an amateur magician.

The original format had Joe Mannix (Mike Connors), a Los Angeles-based private detective, employed by a sophisticated detective firm called Intertect. Despite the fact that the company was dedicated to the use of computers and other advanced scientific detection aids, Mannix seemed happiest when working with no implements other than his own intuition and fists. At the start of the second season he had struck out on his own, taking a small office on the first floor of the building in which he lived. Helping him in his new role as an independent investigator was his secretary and girl Friday, Peggy Fair (Gail Fisher). Her husband, a friend of Mannix's and a former police officer, had been killed in the line of duty. Lou Wickersham (Joseph Campanella), Joe's old boss from Intertect, was also seen occasionally during the second season. Lt. Adam Tobias (Robert Reed) joined the cast as Joe's friend and contact on the police force at the start of the 1969-70 season.\n\nThe high point of every episode seemed to be a wild brawl, and the body count even in the first few minutes of the show was sometimes appalling. On their radio show, comedians Bob and Ray ran a continuing parody on the series called Bummix, in which the hero always held a polite conversation with some suspect, calmly agreed that mayhem was the only answer, and then was invariably beaten to a pulp.

The 62-year-old Young came out of a seven-year retirement to originate the role of Dr. Welby.\n\nMarcus Welby, M.D. portrayed the cases of a veteran general practitioner in Santa Monica, California, whose thoroughness and dedication involved him in the lives of all sorts of patients. Assisting him was young Dr. Steven Kiley (James Brolin), who during the first season contracted work with Welby for one year before resuming his training as a neurologist (he stayed). Thus the inevitable tension between youth and experience was established, but in this case Welby tended to be the more unorthodox of the two, often confounding the dedicated but textbook-oriented Kiley with his psychiatric approach to medicine. Welby treated the whole patient, his temperament, fears and family environment, as well as his physical ailments. The ailments were certainly varied for a suburban GP: during the first season alone there were tumors, autistic children, strokes, pernicious anemia, blindness, emphysema, LSD side effects, leukemia, diabetes, Huntington's Chorea, faith healing, dope addiction, an overweight racing jockey, and a diver who kept getting the bends.\n\nA love interest was provided for Dr. Welby during the first season by Myra Sherwood (Anne Baxter), but this role was soon dropped. The only other suggestion that Welby might have a life of his own came in the last season, when his married daughter Sandy (Ann Schedeen) and six-year-old grandson Phil (Gavin Brendan) were occasionally seen. There was no Mrs. Welby. The only other regulars over the years, in fact, were nurses Consuelo Lopez (Elena Verdugo) and Kathleen Faverty (Sharon Gless).\n\nAlthough romance eluded Dr. Welby it did finally come to young Dr. Kiley, in the person of Janet Blake (Pamela Hensley), public relations director of Hope Memorial Hospital. They were married on the telecast of October 21, 1975.\n\nMarcus Welby premiered in 1969 and soon became the biggest hit in the history of the ABC network to that time -- it was the first ABC series ever to rank number one among all TV programs for a full season (1970-71). Part of its success, truth to tell, was in scheduling; for its first two years it ran against a CBS news documentary hour and frequently against documentaries on NBC as well (First Tuesday). The limited appeal of these shows practically forfeited the audience to ABC. But once viewers had gotten used to Welby they stayed, against competition soft and strong. The program also won an Emmy and was held in very high esteem by medical groups, with Young serving offscreen as honorary chairman of numerous national fund drives and observances.

Mary Hartman (Louise Lasser) was a \"typical American housewife\" living in the small town of Fernwood, Ohio. She was totally impressionable and rather slow-witted, with the most significant things in her life coming from television commercials, which she believed totally. One of her early concerns was the prospect of \"dirty yellow buildup\" on her kitchen floor and how to avoid it. Pigtailed and plain, her life was full of one crisis after another -- her father George Shumway (Philip Bruns) disappeared, her daughter Heather (Claudia Lamb) was held hostage by a mass murderer, her husband Tom (Greg Mullavey) was impotent, and her best friend Loretta Hagers (Mary Kay Place) was an aspiring country music singer who became paralyzed. Eventually Mary's implacable calm collapsed and she had a nervous breakdown, as well as an affair with local cop Dennis Foley (Bruce Solomon). Mary's grandfather, Raymond Larkin (Victor Killian), was known to all as the Fernwood Flasher for his penchant for exposing himself in public; her sister Cathy (Debralee Scott) was a local swinger; and her mother Martha (Dody Goodman) was decidedly flaky. Tom Hartman was an assembly-line worker at the local automobile plant where he worked with Loretta's husband Charlie Haggers (Graham Jarvis). Jimmy Joe Jeeter (Sparky Marcus) was an eight-year-old evangelist whose career was cut short when he was electrocuted by a television set that fell in his bathtub. His father, Merle (Dabney Coleman) was Fernwood's mayor.\n\nMary Hartman, Mary Hartman was the creation of producer Norman Lear and had been offered to the major networks, all of which rejected it as too controversial. Lear then sold the series to local stations as a syndicated entry in 1976 and had a much-publicized success with it. The novelty of a satirical soap opera attracted many viewers (Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman ran after the late local news in many cities). When star Louise Lasser left the show in 1977, it continued for another six months under the title Forever Fernwood with most of the original cast intact. However, Tab Hunter took over the role of Martha Shumway's husband George (with the explanation that Goerge had fallen into a chemical vat and been restored with plastic surgery); and new characters included Eleanor Major (Shelley Fabares), Tom Hartman's new love interest; Harmon Farinella (Richard Hatch), who sought an affair with Loretta Haggers; and Mac Slattery (Dennis Burkley), the truck driver. CBS, the network that had first rejected it, aired selected reruns of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman as part of its late-night lineup for a few months in 1980.

Unlike the efforts generated by producer Norman Lear, typified by All in the Family and Maude, there was never a conscious attempt to humiliate or ridicule. Mary Richards was the idealized single career woman. She had come to Minneapolis after breaking up with a man she had been dating for four years. Ambitious, and looking for new friends, she moved into an older apartment building and went to work as an assistant producer of the local news show on television station WJM-TV. In her early 30s, Mary symbolized the independent woman of the 1970s. She would like to find a man and settle down to raise a family, but was not desperately grabbing at any chance for marriage. Sh would get married, but only if it was to the right man. She was warm, loving, and vulnerable, and although it was never bluntly thrown out at the audience, could spend the night with a man she was not madly in love with.\n\nMary worked for WJM-TV News producer Lou Grant (Edward Asner), an irascible, cantankerous, blustery man whose bark was much worse than his bite. Underneath that harsh exterior beat the heart of a pussycat. Lou had problems with his home life as well as his job. During the 1973-74 season he separated from his wife Edie (Priscilla Morrill) and they were later divorced. Though it never developed, there was an underlying feeling that he and Mary might have had a serious relationship, if they could have ever really gotten together.\n\nMurray Slaughter (Gavin MacLeod) was the head newswriter at the station. He was happily married, had a positive outlook no matter what happened, and was a good friend to all. Anchorman on the WJM-TV News was Tex Baxter (Ted Knight), not too bright, prone to put his foot in his mouth both on and off the air, and possessor of such a misplaced sense of his own wonderfulness that he was the butt of everyone's jokes. Ted's long courtship of bland, emptyheaded but well-meaning Georgette (Georgia Engel) culminated in a marriage he was not quite ready to commit himself to in November 1975. The following spring he and Georgette adopted eight-year-old David (Robbie Rist), and in the fall of 1976 had a baby of their own.\n\nMary's closest friend was one of her neighbors, Rhoda Morganstern (Valerie Harper), an interior decorator for a local department store who, like Mary, was still single though in her 30s. Unlike Mary, however, Rhoda was desperately looking for a husband. Unable to find one in Minneapolis, she moved back home to New York City, and to her own series, Rhoda, in the fall of 1974. The other neighbor see frequently in Mary's apartment was Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman). Phyllis was the building's resident busybody, and though it took quite a while to find out, also its landlady (her husband Lars, who was talked about but never seen, actually owned the building). Phyllis was oblivious to everyone else's feelings and had an extremely flaky personality. She, too, got her own series when, following Lars' death, she and her daughter Bess (Lisa Gerritsen) moved to San Francisco in the fall of 1975, and Mary moved into a more luxurious apartment high-rise.\n\nAs some of the regulars left the series, including WJM-TV's weatherman Gordy Howard (John Amos), others took up the slack. Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White) arrived at the station in 1973 with her \"Happy Homemaker Show,\" and Georgette's role was expanded. Sue Ann was in her late 40s and extremely man-hungry. She was constantly trying to get every male in sight into the sack, but primarily Lou Grant. Mary eventually was promoted to associate producer to producer as Lou moved to the job of news director.\n\nMary Tyler Moore, who, with her husband Grant Tinker, produced The Mary Tyler Moore Show, decided that the series would end in 1977, despite its still large audience. In the last episode new management took over the station and, in an effort to bolster its weak news ratings, fired virtually the entire staff. Ironically, the one survivor was anchorman Ted Baxter, probably the primary cause for the news' low ratings. There were tearful farewells and everyone went their separate ways.

Edith Bunker's cousin Maude Findlay (Beatrice Arthur) was upper-middle-class, liberal and extremely outspoken -- a perfect counterpoint to Archie Bunker's blustering, hard-hat bigotry. The character became so popular that in the fall of 1972 Maude was given a series of her own -- and it soon became almost as big a hit as All in the Family itself.\n\nMaude lived in Tuckahoe, New York, with her fourth husband, Walter (Bill Macy), owner of Findlay's Friendly Appliances. Living with them was Carol (Adrienne Barbeau), Maude's divorced, 27-year-old daughter, and Carol's nine-year-old son Phillip (Brian Morrison).\n\nEven though much of the comedy centered on Maude's determination to represent the independent, even dominant, woman, she herself always had a female servant in the house. In fact, during the course of the series, she ran through three of them. Maude's first maid was Florida (Esther Rolle), a bright, witty black woman who left early in 1974 to star in her own program, Good Times. (Her husband, Henry (John Amos), was renamed James in Good Times, even though the same actor continued in the role.) Florida was succeeded by a cynical, hard-drinking Englishwoman, Mrs. Naugatuck (Hermoine Baddeley). Mrs. Naugatuck was never as popular with viewers as Florida had been, and after marrying Bert Beasley (J. Pat O'Malley) in November 1976 she left the show, ostensibly to return to the British Isles. Her replacement was Victoria Butterfield (Marlene Warfield), who joined the Findlay household in the fall of 1977.\n\nThe Findlay's next-door neighbor, and Walter's best friend, was Dr. Arthur Harmon (Conrad Bain). When the series began Arthur was a widower, but he subsequently began dating Maude's best friend, Vivian (Rue McClanahan) (who had just been divorced), and in February 1974 they were married. Everyone on this show seemed to be either married or getting married, except for Maude's daughter Carol. She came close with boyfriend Chris (Fred Grandy) in 1974, but that didn't work out and he soon disappeared from the cast.\n\nAlthough this was a comedy show, the subject matter was often on the serious side. During the run, Maude became involved in politics, had a face lift, had an abortion (which drew heavy viewer protest mail) and went through menopause. Walter went through a severe bout with alcoholism, saw his store go bankrupt, and had a nervous breakdown. Maude could be very funny, but in its efforts to be realistic, it could also be controversial and sometimes depressing. Yet for several seasons viewers made it one of the top programs on television.\n\nFinally in 1977-78 the audience began to decline, and some major cast changes were planned for the next season. The Harmons and Carol were to move out of town, and Walter was to retire from the appliance business. Maude would begin a career in politics, with a new supporting cast. But early in 1978 Bea Arthur announced that she was leaving the series. The producers candidly admitted that no one else could play the role as she had, and so after six years Maude ended its run.\n\nThe political career that had been planned for Maude was used as a basis for the ill-fated 1979 series Hanging In, starring Bill Macy and Barbara Rhoades.

When Griffith decided to call it quits in 1968, CBS kept most of the rest of the cast together, added a new lead in the person of Ken Berry, and continued the show under the title Mayberry, R.F.D.\n\nLike Griffith's Andy, Berry's Sam Jones was a young widower with a small son, Mike (Buddy Foster). Sam was a gentleman farmer who had recently taken up residence near Mayberry. Not long after his arrival he found himself elected to the Mayberry Town Council, a position for which he had no prior experience. That hardly mattered in Mayberry, however, as in his friendly, bumbling way he attempted to perform his new duties and tend to the simple needs of the townsfolk. Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) moved in with him as his housekeeper for two years, then was replaced by Aunt Alice (Alice Ghostley) for the 1970-71 season. Millie Swanson (Arlene Golonka) was Sam's romantic interest.\n\nFor a couple of years Mayberry R.F.D. was virtually as popular as The Andy Griffith Show had been. The new program was one of the top four shows on television during its first two years (Andy Griffith had reached number one in its final season). It was still in the Top 20 when CBS canceled it in 1971, as part of an extensive cutback in \"rural\"-oriented programming.\n\nMCCLOUD\n\nPolice\n\nFIRST TELECAST: September 16, 1970\n\nLAST TELECAST: August 28, 1977\n\nMcCloud was one of television's more tongue-in-cheek police series. Here was Deputy Marshall Sam McCloud (Dennis Weaver) from Taos, New Mexico, driving the New York City police crazy. He had originally arrived in New York to chase a prisoner who had escaped from him, and his direct, rather strong-arm methods were hard for the big-city police to cope with. After capturing his man, McCloud somehow found himself on temporary assignment in Manhattan's 27th Precinct under Chief Peter B. Clifford (J.D. Cannon). Although he was ostensibly there to learn the methods employed by a large metropolitan police department, McCloud usually took things into his own hands and reverted to type, much to the chagrin and frustration of Chief Clifford. Whenever McCloud went on a case he dragged Sgt. Joe Broadhurst (Terry Carter) with him and, though they usually solved the crime and got along well with each other, Broadhurst's association with McCloud didn't seem to be doing him much good with their mutual superior Clifford. McCloud really looked out of place on the streets of New York, with his cowboy hat, sheepskin jacket, and matching accent. He was full of Western homilies and used the catch phrase \"There you go\" quite regularly. His romantic interest, not seen in every episode, was writer Chris Coughlin (Diana Muldaur), who was working on a book that related to the fugitive he had chased to New York in the pilot for the series.\n\nMcCloud premiered in 1970 as the first of four mini-series aired under the collective title Four-In-One -- the others being San Francisco International Airport, Night Gallery, and The Psychiatrist. The following fall it became, along with Columbo and McMillan and Wife, one of the three original elements in the NBC Mystery Movie rotation. It remained with that series throughout the rest of its run.

Mac was very supportive, though occasionally bewildered by the situations Sally got them into, and was often called upon to help solve the cases. This mystery/comedy police series was patterned after the relationship between Nick and Nora Charles in The Thin Man movies and TV series of the 1940s and 1950s. There were elements of romance and comedy thrown in with the actual case being solved. Mac's aide was plodding but enthusiastic Sgt. Charles Enright (John Schuck), and Mildred (Nancy Walker) was the McMillans' sarcastic, sharp-toungued maid.\n\nMcMillan and Wife was one of the three original rotating elements in the NBC Mystery Movie -- the other two were McCloud and Columbo -- and remained with the series throughout its long run. When Nancy Walker and Susan Saint James left the series at the end of the 1975-1976 season, the former to star in her own series on ABC and the latter in a contract dispute, the title was shortened to McMillan and cast changes were made. Sally was written off the series by having her die in a plane crash, and Mac, now a widower, had a new maid/housekeeper named Agatha (Martha Raye), who happened to be Mildred's sister. Mac also acquired a second assistant in Sgt. Steve DiMaggio (Richard Gilliland) (the dimwitted Enright had been promoted to lieutenant) and a new secretary named Maggie (Gloria Strook).

Dr. Paul Lochner (James Daly) was the chief of staff, an experienced, professional, compassionate man. Dr. Joe Gannon (Chad Everett) was a young associate professor of surgery and close friend and colleague of Dr. Lochner. At the start of the show's second season, Dr. Gannon took on the added responsibilities of director of the student health service, an appropriate post for a young physician who could identify closely with the students. A number of other doctors and nurses came and went in the cast; Miss Wilcox (Audrey Totter), the extremely efficient head nurse, achieved co-star billing in 1972.\n\nThe personal and medical stories of the doctors and their patients, as well as others with whom they came into contact, provided the drama in this series. Gannon and Lochner embodied the youth vs. experience tension which seems to be a necessary element of every medical show. The elements certainly worked here, as Medical Center, with its seven-year run, was the longest-running medical series in the history of prime-time television.

It starred James Drury as the laconic, mysterious \"Virginian,\" who never revealed his real name and who \"forced his idea of law and order on a Wyoming Territory community in the 1890s\"; and Doug McClure as the wild young cowhand Trampas. Setting for the saga was Shiloh Ranch, owned successively by Judge Henry Garth (Lee J. Cobb), the two Grainger brothers John (Charles Bickford) and Clay (John McIntire), and finally Col. Alan MacKenzie (Stewart Granger). MacKenzie took over during the last season, at which time the program was retitled The Men from Shiloh and the historical period was moved up a few years. Roy Tate (Lee Majors) and Parker (John McLiam) also became cast regulars at that time.\n\nTHE MOD SQUAD\n\nPolice\n\nFIRST TELECAST: September 24, 1968\n\nLAST TELECAST: August 23, 1973\n\nCREATOR: Bud Ruskin\n\nThe Mod Squad was probably the ultimate example of the establishment co-opting the youth movement of the late 1960s. Its three members were \"hippie cops,\" each of them a drop-out from straight society who had had his own brush with the law. Pete Cochran (Michael Cole) was a longhaired youth who had been kicked out by his wealthy Beverly Hills parents and stolen a car; Linc Hayes (Clarence Williams) was the Afro-ed son of a ghetto family of 13, raised in Watts and arrested in the Watts rioting; Julie Barnes (Peggy Lipton) was the daughter of a San Francisco prostitute who had run away from home and been arrested for vagrancy. All three were on probation and looking for some way to make sense out of their lives when they were approached by Capt. Adam Greer (Tige Andrews), who recruited them for a special \"youth squad.\" Their purpose was to infiltrate the counterculture and ferret out the adult criminals who preyed upon the young in Southern California (no finking on your own generation, thank you).\n\nA contentious trio, always questioning their own motives and their differing cultural backgrounds, the Mod Squad nevertheless proved an effective undercover task force against adult crime. For the first season they rattled around in a battered old 1950 station wagon named \"Woody,\" but this was killed off early in the second season (driven over a cliff).\n\nStrangely enough, The Mod Squad was based on the true experiences of creator Bud Ruskin, a former police officer and later private detective. While a member of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department in the 1950s he was a member of an undercover narcotics squad composed of young officers, which served as the inspiration for The Mod Squad. He first wrote the pilot script for the series in 1960, but it took eight more years before it reached the air in this highly successful ABC program.

So popular was Mork, the nutty character created by Robin Williams, that Williams was given his own series in the fall of 1978, and it became an instant hit.\n\nMork was a misfit on his own planet because of his sense of humor (he was heard to call the Orkan leader, Orson (the voice of Ralph James), \"cosmic breath\"). So the humorless Orkans sent him off to study Earthlings, whose \"crazy\" customs they had never been able to understand. Mork landed, in a giant eggshell, near Boulder, Colorado. There he was befriended by pretty Mindy McConnell (Pam Dawber), a clerk at the music store run by her father, Frederick (Conrad Janis). Mork looked human, but his strange mixture of Orkan and Earthling customs -- such as wearing a suit, but putting it on backwards, or sitting in a chair, but upside down -- led most people to think of him as just some kind of nut. Mindy knew where he came from, and helped him adjust to Earth's strange ways. She also let him stay in the attic of her apartment house, which scandalized her conservative father, but not her swinging grandmother, Cora (Elizabeth Kerr).\n\nAfter a season of simple slapstick and big ratings, both the producers and the network unfortunately got a little cocky and violated one of television's cardinal rules: \"Don't tamper with a hit.\" In the process of doing so, they almost destroyed the program. The producers decided to shift to more \"meaningful\" stories, opening the second season with a strange, surrealistic episode in which Mork shrunk away to nothing and dropped into a never-never world filled with caricatures of good and evil. At the same time practically the whole supporting cast was changed. Simultaneously ABC decided to move the series from its established Thursday time slot to Sunday, to prop up their sagging schedule that night. Understandably confused, viewers deserted the show in droves and it lost nearly half its audience.\n\nBy December 1979 ABC and the producers were scrambling to undo their mistakes. Mork went back to Thursday, and stories got less complicated. Mindy's father, who had been dumped (along with the grandmother), returned for a third season. He was supposed to have sold the music store and gone on tour as an orchestra conductor, fulfilling a lifelong dream. Now he, but not Cora, was back full-time. Other changes in the second and third seasons included the addition of brother and sister Remo (Jay Thomas) and Jean (Gina Hecht) DaVinci, recently arrived from the Bronx. Remo ran the New York Deli and was helping put Jean through medical school. Nelson (Jim Staahl) was Mindy's cousin, an uptight young social climber with grandiose political ambitions; Mr. Bickley (Tom Poston) was the grouchy downstairs neighbor (he had been on before, but his role was enlarged); and Mork's friend Exidor (Robert Donner) was a crazed prophet and leader of an invisible cult, the Friends of Venus. Mindy, a journalism student, got a job at a local TV station, where her boss was Mr. Sternhagen (Foster Brooks).\n\nAll of this brought back some of the lost viewers, but Mork & Mindy never recaptured the enormous following it had during its first season.\n\nThe fall of 1981 brought the most surprising developments of all. Mork and Mindy were married, and honeymooned on Ork -- which proved to be full of bizarre creatures. Shortly thereafter Mork gave birth, by ejecting a small egg from his navel. The egg grew and grew and finally cracked open to reveal a full-grown Jonathan Winters! Mearth, as they called their first child, weighed 225 pounds and looked middle-aged, but babbled like a baby, calling Mork \"Mommy\" and Mindy \"Shoe.\" Since things work backwards on Ork, he would gradually grow younger (instead of older) and never want for affection in his waning years.\n\nDespite some hilarious scenes between Robin Williams and his idol Jonathan Winters, the series was by this time losing audience rapidly and left the air at the end of the season. It had succeeded primarily because of the versatile talents of Williams, who mugged, mimicked, and delivered torrents of one-liners and Orkan gibberish. At the end of each episode he reported back to his leader Orson, on Ork, twisting his ears and signing off, \"Na nu, na nu\" -- goodbye in Orkan.

Fred MacMurray and Tim Considine had starred together in the hit Disney movie The Shaggy Dog, and Don Grady was a former Mickey Mouse Club mouseketeer. Even little Stanley Livingston was a show-business veteran, having appeared in several episodes of The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet.\n\nThe \"family\" in this case was all-male. Steve Douglas (MacMurray), a consulting aviation engineer, lived in a medium-sized Midwestern city (until 1967, when his job took him to North Hollywood) with his children. A widower, he seemed to spend more time raising his three sons than he did at his job, what with the usual growing pains of boys just beginning to date, going on camping trips, and the other \"adventures\" of middle-class suburbia. Steve also spent a good deal of time fending off attractive women, who wanted to marry him and take over that lovable, readymade family. Steve's father-in-law was \"Bub\" O'Casey (William Frawley), a lovable old coot who lived with them and served as a kind of housekeeper to the clan. When he left after five seasons to take a trip to Iceland (William Frawley had passed away during production), he was replaced by his brother, Uncle Charley (William Demarest), a retired sailor whose crusty disposition masked a soft heart. Others joining the cast in the early years were Sally (Meredith MacRae) as Mike's fianceé, and Ernie (Barry Livingston), the boy next door and Chip's (Stanley Livingston) pal (and real-life brother). When Tim Considine had grown out of the role as oldest son and wanted out of the series in 1965, Steve subsequently adopted the orphaned Ernie to reestablish the \"three sons.\" Tramp was the family dog.\n\nIn the fall of 1967, Robbie fell in love with Katie Miller (Tina Cole), one of his fellow students at college, and their romance blossomed into marriage before the end of the season. In the fall of 1968, the newlyweds discovered that Katie was pregnant and during that season she gave birth to triplets, Steve, Jr. (Joseph Todd), Charley (Michael Todd), and Robbie II (Daniel Todd) -- three sons, of course. 1969 finally brought new love to father Steve in the person of widow Barbara Harper (Beverly Garland), one of Ernie's teachers. They were married during the season and Barbara's young daughter Dodie (Dawn Lyn) joined the family. Even Chip (who was by now 17) got into the act, eloping with his college girl friend Polly Williams (Ronnie Troup) in the fall of 1970.\n\nFrom December 1971 until a few weeks after it ended its prime-time run in August 1972, CBS ran repeat episodes in its daytime lineup.
