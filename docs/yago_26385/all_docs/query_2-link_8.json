        "meta_description": "Jonathan Tucker discussed his new book \"War of Nerves: Chemical Warfare from World War I to Al-Qaeda\" in a program sponsored by the Science, Technology and Business Division. In \"War of Nerves\" (Pantheon, 2006), Tucker writes about the discovery, development, proliferation and control of the most lethal class of chemical weapons: nerve agents such as Tabun, Sarin, Soman and VX. The book also provides insights into current issues, including the 2003 Iraq War and the continuing threat of chemical terrorism.",
