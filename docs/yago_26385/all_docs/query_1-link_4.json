        "text": "Robert Conrad was a graduate of Northwestern University, spending his first few years out of school supporting himself and his family by driving a milk truck and singing in a Chicago cabaret. Conrad befriended up-and-coming actor Nick Adams during this period, and it was Adams who helped Conrad get his first Hollywood work in 1957. A few movie bit parts later, Conrad was signed for a comparative pittance by Warner Bros. studios, and in 1959 was cast as detective Tom Lopaka on the weekly adventure series Hawaiian Eye. Upon the 1963 cancellation of this series, Conrad made a handful of Spanish and American films and toured with a nightclub act in Australia and Mexico City. Cast as frontier secret agent James West in Verrückter wilder Westen (1965) in 1965, Conrad brought home $5000 a week during the series' first season and enjoyed increasing remunerations as West remained on the air until 1969. There are those who insist that Wild Wild West would have been colorless without the co-starring presence of Ross Martin, an opinion with which Conrad has always agreed. The actor's bid to star in a 1970 series based on the venerable Nick Carter pulp stories got no further than a pilot episode, while the Jack Webb-produced 1971 Robert Conrad series The D.A. was canceled after 13 episodes. When Roy Scheider pulled out of the 1972 adventure weekly Assignment: Vienna, Conrad stepped in--and was out, along with the rest of Assignment: Vienna, by June of 1973. Conrad had better luck with 1976's Baa Baa Black Sheep, aka Black Sheep Squadron, a popular series based on the World War II exploits of Major \"Pappy\" Boyington. Cast as a nurse on this series was Conrad's daughter Nancy, setting a precedent for nepotism that the actor practiced as late as his tenth TV series, 1989's Jesse Hawkes, wherein Conrad co-starred with his sons Christian and Shane.\n\nThough few of his series have survived past season one, Conrad has enjoyed success as a commercial spokesman and in the role of G. Gordon Liddy (whom the actor admired) in the 1982 TV movie Nixons rechte Hand - Der Fall G. Gordon Liddy (1982). As can be gathered from the Liddy assignment, Conrad's politics veered towards conservatism; in 1981, he and Charlton Heston were instrumental in toppling Ed Asner and his liberal contingent from power in the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nAs virile and athletic as ever in the 1990s, Robert Conrad continued to appear in action roles both on TV and in films; he also maintained strong ties with his hometown of Chicago, and could be counted on to show up at a moment's notice as a guest on the various all-night programs of Chicago radio personality Eddie Schwartz.\n\nRandolph Mantooth definitely fit the bill when he made a bankable name for himself in the TV medical series Notruf California (1972) as strong but sensitive paramedic/firefighter \"John Gage\".\n\nTall, dark and good-looking, Randy is of Seminole Indian heritage, born in Sacramento, California on September 19, 1945. One of four children born to a construction engineer, his childhood was somewhat physically unsettling in that his father's job career had the family moving frequently from state to state. Randy attended San Marcos High School in the Santa Barbara area of California where he participated in school plays. He received a scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York following his studies at Santa Barbara City College.\n\nRandy was discovered in New York by a Universal talent agent after performing the lead in the play \"Philadelphia, Here I Come\" and returned to California. He slowly built up his resume with work on such dramatic series as Adam-12 (1968), Ein Sheriff in New York (1970), Alias Smith & Jones (1971) and Dr. med. Marcus Welby (1969). This led to TV stardom on the popular \"Emergency!\" series in 1972 which ran over five seasons. As a change of pace, he tried comedy and earned series roles on the short-lived Einsatz Petticoat (1977) and Detective School (1979), as well as pursued the guest star route on episodics. He was also prominently seen in the high-profile mini-series Testimony of Two Men (1977) and The Seekers (1979).\n\nAfter a career lull in the early 1980s, Randy found a new direction in his career with daytime soaps. He played \"Clay Alden\" in the soap opera Loving (1983) from 1987 through 1990, then left for personal reasons before returning to the show in 1993, this time in the role of \"Alex Masters\". The soap was later revamped and entitled The City (1995) but it lasted only two more years.\n\nFrom there he has regularly appeared on General Hospital (1963), Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968) and Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956), where he has played both good guys and villains. Millennium credits film include featured roles in the romantic comedy Eine tolle Nummer (1959), the action thriller Agent Red - Ein tödlicher Auftrag (2000), the social drama Price to Pay (2006), the romantic thriller Amok - He Was a Quiet Man (2007), the action adventure Bold Native (2010) and, his last to date, the horror yarn Killer Holiday (2013). On TV, he has had regular roles on the daytime soap dramas Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956) in 2003-2005 and Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968) in 2007.\n\nRandy has frequently returned to his theater roots in such productions as \"Footprints in Blood\", \"Back to the Blankets\", \"Wink Dah\", \"The Independence of Eddie Rose\", \"The Paper Crown\", \"The Inuit\" and, most recently, \"Rain Dance\" off-Broadway in 2003.\n\nDivorced from actress Rose Parra, he married actress Kristen Connors in 2002. They were featured together as the ambassador and his wife in the film comedy Scream of the Bikini (2009). Two siblings also got into the business -- actor Don Mantooth and producer Tonya Mantooth.\n\nDavid Soul achieved pop icon status as handsome, blond-haired, blue-eyed Detective Kenneth Hutchinson on the cult \"buddy cop\" TV series Starsky und Hutch (1975), Soul also had a very successful singing career recording several albums, with worldwide number one hit singles including \"Silver Lady\" & \"Don't Give Up on Us Baby\".\n\nOriginally from Chicago, Illinois, David Soul is the son of a minister who was at one time serving as the religious affairs advisor to the U.S. High Commission in Berlin. At 24 years of age, young Soul joined a North Dakota musical revue, was noticed by a keen-eyed talent scout, and signed to a studio contract. He went on to study acting with the Irene Daly School of The Actors Company, and with the Columbia Workshop in Hollywood. He first appeared on TV in small roles in shows including Bezaubernde Jeannie (1965), Flipper (1964) and Es bleibt in der Familie (1971). Regular TV work kept coming in for Soul including making masked appearances on The Merv Griffin Show (1962), as the popular singer known only as \"The Covered Man.\"\n\nIn 1973, Soul was fortunate enough to be cast as one of the corrupt motorcycle cops in the Clint Eastwood thriller Calahan (1973), where his talents came to the attention of several TV execs who were looking for someone to play one of the lead roles in the upcoming Starsky und Hutch (1975) TV series. After four seasons, the show came to an end, yet Soul's talents were still in demand. He quickly went on to appear as the meek writer turned terrified vampire hunter Ben Mears in the chilling television mini-series Brennen muß Salem (1979), and then as Jake in the interesting television movie Homeward Bound (1980).\n\nSeveral undemanding movies and TV series appearances followed for Soul. However in 1988 he scored rave reviews for his portrayal of real life, cold-blooded cop killer Michael Lee Platt in FBI Murders (1988). It was considered highly controversial for its intense level of violence in a made for TV production.\n\nDavid Soul remained very busy throughout the 1990s and beyond, in both film and on stage productions. He has toured internationally in several theater productions, including playing the narrator in the critically-acclaimed production of Willy Russell's Blood Brothers, plus a successful UK tour performing in Ira Levin's Deathtrap. Fans of the original TV series were glad to see Soul back with Paul Michael Glaser doing a cameo appearance in the big-budget movie version of Starsky & Hutch (2004).\n\nThroughout his life, Soul has continually championed social causes often utilizing his own funds to raise awareness on issues including the impact of the Vietnam War, the shutdowns in the US steel industry, animal welfare, world hunger and HIV education. Soul has for several years made his home in the United Kingdom, where he has appeared at the Edinburgh Festival, on several British TV shows and has become a keen soccer fan supporting English club, Arsenal FC.\n\nMichael Landon was born Eugene Maurice Orowitz, on Saturday, October 31st, 1936, in Forest Hills, Queens, New York. In 1941, he and his family moved to Collingswood, New Jersey.\n\nWhen Eugene was in high school, he participated -- and did very well -- in track and field, especially javelin throwing, and his athletic skills earned him a scholarship to USC. However, an accident injured his arm, ending his athletic career -- and his term at USC -- and he worked a number of odd jobs and small roles to make ends meet and decided that acting was for him. However, he thought that his real name was not a suitable one for an aspiring actor, and so \"Michael Landon\" was born.\n\nTwo of his first big roles were as Tony Rivers in Der Tod hat schwarze Krallen (1957) and as Tom Dooley in the western Keine Gnade für Tom Dooley (1959). That same year he was approached by producer David Dortort to star in a pilot called The Restless Gun (1957), which was renamed when the series was picked up to Bonanza (1959). Landon played Little Joe Cartwright, the youngest of the three Cartwright brothers, a cocky and somewhat rebellious youth nevertheless had a way with the ladies. For 14 years, Landon became the heart and soul of the show, endearing himself to both younger and older viewers, and he became a household name during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn 1968, after almost ten years of playing Little Joe, he wanted an opportunity to direct and write some episodes of the show. After the season finale in 1972, Dan Blocker, who played his older brother Hoss and was also a close friend, died from a blood clot in his lung, after gall bladder surgery, but Michael decided to go back to work, revisiting his own character in a two-part episode called \"Forever.\"\n\nBonanza (1959) was finally canceled in early 1973, after 14 years and 430 episodes. Michael didn't have to wait long until he landed another successful role that most TV audiences of the 1970s would thoroughly enjoy, his second TV western, for NBC, Unsere kleine Farm (1974). That show was based on a popular book written by Laura Ingalls Wilder, and he played enduring patriarch and farmer Charles Ingalls. Unlike Bonanza (1959), where he was mostly just a \"hired gun,\" on this show he served as the producer, writer, director, and executive producer. By the end of its eighth season in 1982, Landon decided to step down from his role on \"Little House\" as he saw his TV children grown up and moved out of their father's house, and a year later, the show was canceled. After 14 years on Bonanza (1959) and 8 years on Unsere kleine Farm (1974), it was about time to focus on something else, and once again, he didn't have to wait too long before Ein Engel auf Erden (1984) came along. Unlike the western shows that he did for 23 years, this NBC fantasy/drama show focused on Jonathan Smith, an angel whose job was to save peoples' lives and work for God, his boss. Victor French played ex-cop Mark Gordon, who turned down a fortune but had redeemed himself by meeting Jonathan.\n\nBy the end of the fifth season in 1989, French was diagnosed with lung cancer and died in June of that same year. Landon was devastated by the loss and pulled the plug on Ein Engel auf Erden (1984). In early 1991, after 35 years of working on NBC, he was axed by the network, so he moved to CBS to star in the pilot of a two-hour movie, Weite Reise (1991), in which he played Jeff Hayes, a man freed from prison by new evidence after 18 years wrongfully spent inside. This was going to be another one of Landon's shows but, in April 1991, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He later appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) to talk about his battle with the disease, and many people in the audience were affected by the courage and energy he showed. Unfortunately, he was already terminally ill by that time, and on Monday, July 1st, 1991, after a three-month battle, he finally succumbed to the disease. His family, his colleagues, and his children were all by his side. His life-time: Saturday, October 31st, 1936 to Monday, July 1st, 1991, was 19,966 days, equaling 2,852 weeks & 2 days.\n\nTom Wopat will forever be remembered as strapping, good ol' boy Luke Duke, the virile, blue-eyed, dark-haired, plaid-shirted rascal opposite equally good-looking John Schneider as Bo Duke, his strapping, plaid-shirted blond cousin on the bucolic 80s action series Ein Duke kommt selten allein (1979). Where others may have fallen by the TV wayside after the cancellation of such a popular series, both Tom and John moved on successfully. As for Tom, he reverted back to his first true love - music - successfully refocusing as a recording artist and musical leading man of Broadway, cabaret and regional shows.\n\nThe highly engaging Wisconsin native was born Thomas Steven Wopat on September 9, 1951, in Lodi, Wisconsin, the son of Ruth Arlene (Skarda) and Albin Carl Wopat, a dairy farmer. One of six brothers and sisters, Tom's father and maternal grandfather were of Czech descent. By age 12, he was singing and dancing in school musicals and, following high school graduation, decided to avidly pursue music as a viable profession. Studying at the University of Wisconsin, Tom dropped out to front a rock band as both guitarist and lead singer, and later found on-stage work in such musicals as \"South Pacific\", \"West Side Story\" and \"Jesus Christ Superstar.\"\n\nAppearing off-Broadway in 1978, Tom made his Broadway debut that same year as a replacement actor in the musical \"I Love My Wife.\" Other musical shows around that time included \"The Robber Bridegroom\" (title role) and \"Oklahoma!\" (as Curly).\n\nWith solid, down-home good looks and appeal, it didn't take long for Hollywood to check Tom out. With relatively little TV exposure, Tom found sudden teen heartthrob stardom on the rollicking, down-home comedy series Ein Duke kommt selten allein (1979). During that period, he appeared elsewhere on an episode of \"Fantasy Island,\" co-starred with singer Barbara Mandrell in the dramatic TV movie\" Burning Rage (1984), and voiced the role of Luke Duke on the related animated version The Dukes (1983). During the 1981-82 season, stars Wopat and Schneider walked away from the hugely popular series after contractual disputes involving deserved pay raises and merchandise royalties. The producers tried to replace the popular duo with the similar good-looking pals Vance (played by Christopher Mayer) and Coy (played by Byron Cherry) for the following season, but the ratings dived alarmingly. The dispute with Wopat and Schneider was immediately settled, and the boys returned to the show in the next season and stayed until its 1985 cancellation.\n\nDuring the show's run, Tom kick-started a recording career with his first (and self-titled) country album release in 1983. His output went on to include six other country albums before finally releasing a 2000 album of standard love songs.\n\nIn later years, Wopat made do with a few mini-movie efforts, reuniting with Schneider in the yuletide drama Und plötzlich war Weihnachten (1987); co-starring opposite Jean Smart as a famous rock singer in the romantic musical comedy movie Just My Imagination (1992); and appearing opposite Roxanne Hart in the action adventure Meteoriten! (1998). He also showed up as a guest on a few TV series such as \"Blue Skies,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Crisis Center,\" \"Home Improvement,\" and was seen in a recurring role on the sitcom Cybill (1995) as a stuntman and former husband of the Cybill Shepherd character.\n\nTom also re-sharpened his musical theater skills, finding commanding baritone leads as Billy Bigelow in \"Carousel\" (1986), Detective Stone in \"City of Angels\" (1990) and Sky Masterson in \"Guys and Dolls\" (1992). In 1999, he played the sharp-shooting Frank Butler opposite Bernadette Peters in the popular Broadway revival of \"Annie Get Your Gun\" and earned a Tony nomination in the process.\n\nGuesting for the Cincinnati Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras in programs featuring Broadway's finest music, Tom more than held his own in 2005 with his first straight-acting Broadway part as part of the excellent ensemble in the Tony-winning (for \"Best Revival of a Play\") production of \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" starring acting heavyweights Alan Alda and Liev Schreiber. That same year Wopat embarked on a 33-date national \"Over The Rainbow\" tour with Faith Prince featuring the gorgeous songs of Harold Arlen, a tour that included Carnegie Hall. Briefly playing slick lawyer Billy Flynn in \"Chicago\" in 2007, other Broadway musicals followed with \"A Catered Affair,\" \"Side by Side by Sondheim\" and \"Catch Me If You Can,\" as well as the 2013 legit play \"The Trip to Bountiful.\"\n\nAs for on-camera work into the millennium, Tom returned for a few \"Dukes of Hazzard\" TV-reunions and video games. He also made a late, mid-career film debut in a featured role with the comedy drama Bonneville (2006) starring Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates and Joan Allen, and went on to appear in a number of others: The Understudy (2008), Jonah Hex (2010), Main Street (2010), Mariachi Gringo (2012), Django Unchained (2012), All in Time (2015). In addition, Tom was given a starring role in the gay-themed drama Fair Haven (2016) and appeared in the action western County Line (2017) with Jeff Fahey and Patricia Richardson. Among the ensemble of stars in the comedy Lost Cat Corona (2017), his more recent features include New Money (2017) and Delight in the Mountain (2019). On TV, Tom graced such popular programs as \"Medium,\" \"Smallville,\" \"Blue Bloods,\" \"The Blacklist,\" \"Madam Secretary\" and had a recurring sheriff role in the series Longmire (2012).\n\nDivorced from his first wife of 15 years and the father of five, Tom is married to documentary producer and archivist Kirsten Larvick.\n\nThe son of a legendary actress (Mary Martin) and a district attorney, Larry Martin Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas. After his parents' divorce, he moved to Los Angeles, California to live with his grandmother. When he was 12, his grandmother died and he moved back to his mother's place, who had remarried and was launching a Broadway career. After attending Bard College in New York State, he decided to follow his mother's acting road. His first stage tryout was with the Margo Jones Theatre-in-the-Round in Dallas, Texas. He then appeared in the New York City Center production of \"Taming the Shrew\", followed by a year in regional theater. In his early-to-mid twenties, Larry moved to England as a member of the cast of his mother's stage show, \"South Pacific\", and was a member of the cast for five years. After that, he enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he produced and directed several series for members of the service.\n\nAfter completing his service in the Air Force, Larry returned to New York City for a series of Broadway and off-Broadway plays, esp. \"Once Around the Block\", \"Career\", \"Comes a Day\", \"A Priest in the House\", \"The Beauty Part\", \"The Warm Peninsula\", \"The Nervous Set\" among many others. He began his television career in 1961 with a number of guest appearances on shows as \"The ALCOA Hour\". He was later chosen to be in the popular daytime soap opera The Edge of Night (1956), in which he starred for two years. But that was his start, he later went on to become the friendliest television star in the NBC sitcom Bezaubernde Jeannie (1965), in which he played the amiable astronaut Anthony Nelson. In the series, his life was endangered by this gorgeous blonde bombshell genie played by Barbara Eden. The series ran for five years and after that, he continued his success in Ein herrliches Leben (1971) and Here We Go Again (1973), as well as a number of guest-starring roles on many series. He was also with Lauren Bacall in the television version of the hit Broadway musical Applause (1973).\n\nIn 1977, the soap opera Dallas (1978) came aboard and Larry's career was secured. He credits \"Superchick\" for convincing him to do the show. This program of an excessively rich Texas family, was one of the best, beloved, most-watched shows of all time as he portrayed the role of the evil yet perverted millionaire J.R. Ewing, the man who loved to be hated. The series ran for an amazing 14 1/2 seasons and the \"Who shot J.R.?\" episode remains the second highly-rated television show in the history of the satellite. Since his name was familiar with Texas, it was suiting that he hosted \"Lone Star\" (1985), an eight-part documentary series related to the history of Texas, for the Public Television Stations. That aired while celebrating the 150th anniversary of Texas as an independent republic. In the spring of 1987, Kari-Lorimar released \"Larry Hagman--Stop Smoking for Life\". Proceeds from this home video were donated to the American Cancer Society.\n\nIn July 1995, he needed a liver transplant in order for him to regain his life back after years of strong drinking that led to cirrhosis. He went over to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for this where he spent seven weeks in the hospital, and an operation took 16 hours but saved his life. In July 1996, one year after he had a new liver, he served as the National Spokesperson for the 1996 U.S. Transplant Games presented by the National Kidney Foundation and, on November 2, he later received the Award for his efforts in escalating public awareness of the concept of organ donation. He continued to serve as an advocate of organ donation and transplantation until his death. In November 1996, he starred in Dallas - J.R. kehrt zurück (1996), a 2-hour movie in which the ratings were a huge success for CBS, as well as in the network's drama series New Orleans - Das Gesetz des Südens (1997) when his role of Judge Luther Charbonnet gave him some of the best reviews of his 36-year-career.\n\nWhen he was feeling better than he had for so many years, he completed his two movie projects: Der dritte Zwilling (1997), a four-hour miniseries based on the author's best-selling novel, that aired on CBS, and Mike Nichols's Mit aller Macht (1998), a film based on the best-selling book by a journalist, Joe Klein. Starring in that film were John Travolta, Emma Thompson, Billy Bob Thornton, Kathy Bates and Adrian Lester. Larry played Governor Picker, an antipolitics politician who stands a grave danger crisis to the governor's bid for office. Primary Colors was his second presidential film having also appeared in Oliver Stone's Nixon - Der Untergang eines Präsidenten (1995). Following these movies, his second Dallas reunion movie, Dallas - Kampf bis aufs Messer (1998), aired on CBS. He also served as executive producer.\n\nAway from films, Larry was actively involved in a series of civic and philanthropic events. An adamant non-smoker, he served as the chairperson of the American Cancer Society's \"Great American Smokeout\", from 1981 to 1992. Larry Hagman died at age 81 on November 23, 2012 at Medical City Dallas Hospital in Dallas, Texas from complications of throat cancer.\n\nThe son of a sales clerk and a department store owner, Bill Bixby was the sixth-generation Californian born as Wilfred Bailey Bixby, on January 22, 1934, in San Francisco, California. An only child growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, he attended schools in the same area, took ballroom dance lessons, before attending Lowell High School, where he excelled in drama. After his graduation from high school, he attended San Francisco City College, where he majored in drama. He transferred to the University of California-Berkeley, where he majored in the pre-law program, but never stopped falling in love with his interest in acting. After almost graduating, he left his native San Francisco, to travel to Los Angeles, where he became a lifeguard and a bellhop.\n\nTwo years later, in 1959, two executives noticed him and hired him immediately for commercial work and modeling, in Detroit, Michigan. At the same time, he auditioned for theater roles. He joined the Detroit Civic Theatre Company and made his professional stage debut in the musical, \"The Boy Friend.\" Long after his trip to Michigan, he continued doing commercial work and made numerous guest appearances on popular TV sitcoms.\n\nHe made his TV debut in an episode of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959). He also did many other roles, most notably as \"Charles Raymond\" in The Joey Bishop Show (1961). After many guest and recurring roles, he landed a co-starring role opposite Ray Walston in Mein Onkel vom Mars (1963), in which he portrayed a newspaper reporter playing host to a visitor from another planet. After the first season, it became a hit and Bixby became a household name to millions of fans who liked the show. The show was going well until its cancellation in 1966, which left Bixby in the dark, for the time being. However, he finally got the chance to go onto the big screen. The first of the four post-\"Martian\" 60s movies he played in was the Western, Der Tag der Abrechnung (1966). The following year, he played in Doktor - Sie machen Witze! (1967) and, soon after, he was approached by Elvis Presley to appear in both Nur nicht Millionär sein (1967), and Speedway (1968). Afterwards, he once again returned to series television, this time playing widowed father, \"Tom Corbett\", on Eddies Vater (1969), based on the popular 1963 movie. After its first season, it became a much bigger hit than his first show and Bixby, heretofore one of Hollywood's most confirmed bachelors, changed his views on marriage and family, subsequently taking actress Brenda Benet as his bride and fathering a son. He also tried his hand at directing an episode of the series, called \"Gifts Are For Giving,\" about Norman's highly treasured gift. After completing its second season, Bixby received an Emmy nomination for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, but didn't win. By its third season in 1972, the show had bad scripts and ABC decided to pull the plug.\n\nOnce again, Bixby was not long out of work and was offered a chance to star in a lead role as \"Anthony Dorian/Anthony Blake,\" on his first and only NBC dramatic series called, Der Magier (1973). The show focused on Anthony performing magic tricks which helped people who were in trouble, and in real-life, Bill became a fine magician, performing to both children and adults. But sadly, the show was canceled after one season due to its expensive costs.\n\nAfter a seven-year absence from the big screen, he co-starred in another western, opposite Don Knotts and Tim Conway, in Die Semmelknödelbande (1975). Like most of the theatrical movies he did, it was not a blockbuster at the box office, but was still an average hit. In late 1977, he was offered the role of \"Dr. David Bruce Banner,\" in a two-hour pilot called, Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977). About a physician/scientist who turned into a green monster whenever he became angry, the idea appealed to CBS, and several months later, they premiered a new science fiction-dramatic series, called, Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977). When it debuted as a mid-season replacement, it became the #1 show in the United States, and in many other countries. His character became famous for ripping up shirts each time he turned into the Hulk, played by bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno. Bixby had wanted to direct some episodes, but the time he had to spend in the make-up chair for the transformation sequences made that problematical, and he managed to helm only one segment, \"Bring Me the Head of the Hulk,\" in the fourth season. The series was canceled in 1981 (although the last few episodes didn't air until 1982).\n\nBixby, once again, came back to series television, acting in, producing and directing his last sitcom, Goodnight, Beantown (1983), on which he played \"Matt Cassidy.\" Chosen for the role of \"Jennifer Barnes,\" was one of Bixby's old friends, Mariette Hartley, who had won an Emmy for her guest appearance in Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977) as Banner's second wife. The two played co-anchor newscasters of a Boston television station whose sparring on and off the air developed into friendship and respect. Discounting a brief, inconsequential return to the network's schedule in the summer of 1984, the series lasted for less than a year, from April 1983 to January 1984.\n\nBixby now decided to concentrate on directing and worked on Wizards and Warriors (1983), Goodnight, Beantown (1983) and Sledge Hammer (1986). He also directed the pilot for a New York spy series, \"Rockhopper.\" He also appeared in front of the camera as the host of the daytime anthology series, True Confessions (1985), which dealt with real-life crises of everyday people. Bixby additionally served as host for two shows targeting younger viewers: \"Against the Odds,\" a series of biographies of prominent people, frequently from history, for the Nickelodeon cable channel; and \"Once Upon a Classic,\" a collection of British TV adaptations of literary classics on PBS.\n\nHe came back to reprise his role of \"Dr. David Banner\" from Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977) by acting in, producing, and directing the three spin-off movies: Die Rückkehr des unheimlichen Hulk (1988), Der unheimliche Hulk vor Gericht (1989) and Der Tod des unheimlichen Hulk (1990). He also directed TV movies such as Ein Baby kommt selten allein (1991) and Zwei Asse schlagen wieder zu (1991).\n\nIn April 1991, while directing one of his last movies, he became very ill and was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He underwent surgery and by December, his cancer seemed to be in remission, so he came back to guest star as \"Nick Osborne\" in a two-hour TV movie/pilot called Dick van Dyke - Diagnose Mord (1992). In mid-1992, while his cancer continued to be in remission, Bixby returned to work as a director to direct several episodes of the popular NBC sitcom, Blossom (1990), where he became the main director of the show. At first, he hid his illness from the cast and crew, until one of the producers found out, and then he announced publicly that he wanted to continue working until he could no longer do so. Prior to going public with his cancer, he directed a TV movie starring Roseanne Barr and Tom Arnold, The Woman Who Loved Elvis (1993), which was his final directing project.\n\nUnfortunately, the cancer returned by mid-1993 and, on November 21, 1993, six days after directing his last episode on \"Blossom\" (1991), Bill Bixby died at age 59 in his home after a two-year battle with cancer. For over 30 years, he was in great demand and his big roles and directing credits have been a personal testimony to his fans. His life is gone, but his legacy lives on for years to come.\n\nAmiable and handsome James Garner had obtained success in both films and television, often playing variations of the charming anti-hero/con-man persona he first developed in Maverick, the offbeat western TV series that shot him to stardom in the late 1950s.\n\nJames Garner was born James Scott Bumgarner in Norman, Oklahoma, to Mildred Scott (Meek) and Weldon Warren Bumgarner, a carpet layer. He dropped out of high school at 16 to join the Merchant Marines. He worked in a variety of jobs and received 2 Purple Hearts when he was wounded twice during the Korean War. He had his first chance to act when a friend got him a non-speaking role in the Broadway stage play \"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial (1954)\". Part of his work was to read lines to the lead actors and he began to learn the craft of acting. This play led to small television roles, television commercials and eventually a contract with Warner Brothers. Director David Butler saw something in Garner and gave him all the attention he needed when he appeared in Playboy - Marsch, marsch! (1956). After co-starring in a handful of films during 1956-57, Warner Brothers gave Garner a co-starring role in the the western series Maverick (1957). Originally planned to alternate between Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) and Bret Maverick (Garner), the show quickly turned into the Bret Maverick Show. As Maverick, Garner was cool, good-natured, likable and always ready to use his wits to get him in or out of trouble. The series was highly successful, and Garner continued in it into 1960 when he left the series in a dispute over money.\n\nIn the early 1960s Garner returned to films, often playing the same type of character he had played on \"Maverick\". His successful films included Was diese Frau so alles treibt (1963), Eine zuviel im Bett (1963), Gesprengte Ketten (1963) and Nur für Offiziere (1964). After that, his career wandered and when he appeared in the automobile racing movie Grand Prix (1966), he got the bug to race professionally. Soon, this ambition turned to supporting a racing team, not unlike what Paul Newman would do in later years.\n\nGarner found great success in the western comedy Auch ein Sheriff braucht mal Hilfe (1969). He tried to repeat his success with a sequel, Latigo (1971), but it wasn't up to the standards of the first one. After 11 years off the small screen, Garner returned to television in a role not unlike that in Auch ein Sheriff braucht mal Hilfe (1969). The show was Sheriff ohne Colt und Tadel (1971) and he played the sheriff who would try to solve all problems with his wits and without gun play. When the show was canceled, Garner took the news by having Nichols shot dead, never to return in a sequel. In 1974 he got the role for which he will probably be best remembered, as wry private eye Jim Rockford in the classic Detektiv Rockford - Anruf genügt (1974). This became his second major television hit, with Noah Beery Jr. and Stuart Margolin, and in 1977 he won an Emmy for his portrayal. However, a combination of injuries and the discovery that Universal Pictures' \"creative bookkeeping\" would not give him any of the huge profits the show generated soon soured him and the show ended in 1980. In the 1980s Garner appeared in few movies, but the ones he did make were darker than the likable Garner of old. These included Der Tank (1984) and Die zweite Wahl - Eine Romanze (1985). For the latter, he was nominated for both the Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Returning to the western mode, he co-starred with the young Bruce Willis in Sunset - Dämmerung in Hollywood (1988), a mythical story of Wyatt Earp, Tom Mix and 1920s Hollywood.\n\nIn the 1990s Garner received rave reviews for his role in the acclaimed television movie about corporate greed, Der Konzern (1993). After that he appeared in the theatrical remake of his old television series, Maverick - Den Colt am Gürtel, ein As im Ärmel (1994), opposite Mel Gibson. Most of his appearances after that were in numerous TV movies based upon Detektiv Rockford - Anruf genügt (1974). His most recent films were Ein Präsident für alle Fälle (1996) and Space Cowboys (2000) ."
