        "text": "I know lots of people like him, but there's also a large amount of people who despise him and say he's too arrogant and ruined MASH.\n\nAny interesting gossip about him? He now has Parkison's disease and has been married to the same woman since his early 20s.\n\nHe’s hugely rich. In the 1970s he bought shit tons of land in the Hamptons. There are now condos and giant mansions on land he sold. Four mansions were built in a field adjoining my block in about 2010. The builder told us the field was owned by Alan Alda and that his son-in-law was in charge of the building of each mansion. I don’t think anyone lives year round in any of the 4 houses. I think they’re all rented out in summer. Probably were sold to LLCs. That’s what everyone does nowadays. Sells land to LLCs that tear down middle class houses and fill the entire property with house, pool, three car garage, pebbled driveway.\n\nHe also wanted to build on some protected wetland adjacent to his “compound.” The town was reluctant until he gave the town some land in return for letting him have the wetland. The town probably then sold the land he gave them to builders.\n\nTo me, it seemed as though he was essentially playing himself in “Crimes and Misdemeanors” and I’ve always wondered if that was why Woody Allen cast him. It’s easy to see AA as lacking self-awareness and obliviously going for the role.\n\nI remember him being interviewed by James Lipton on Inside the Actors Studio and he was quite full of himself.\n\nHe's one of my favorites. I especially remember watching him on his Scientific American Frontiers tv show. He showed such joy in learning new things and was very self-deprecating when he didn't know things. That's not the sign of someone who is arrogant or full of himself. The poster who said it's just conservatives hating on an outspoken liberal is probably right. I don't know anyone who thinks badly of him.\n\nCatherine O’Hara was in Betsy’s Wedding. She and Andrea did a commentary for the SCTV episode above and Catherine just went - UGH - when Andrea asked what Alda was really like.\n\nThe MASH set was not a terribly happy one for many of the actors. Even Loretta Swit, who speaks glowingly of Alda and her time on the show, tried to split at do Cagney and Lacey as a series. Jackie Cooper wrote about how cold Alda could be, and how he seemed to have flawed logic when it came to Hawkeye’s peace-loving but women-chasing personality.\n\nThe real tip off about Alda -at least MASH era Alda - is that final episode. Total ego stroke. The other actors were regulated to idiotic C plots.\n\nI’m not hating on him because he’s a liberal (sheesh!), I’m stating an opinion based on my observations.\n\nWhen I saw him on Inside the Actors’ Studio, he was presenting as a bit full of himself and boastfully claiming he invented a certain phrasing in something entertainment related, or something like that, and during the Q&A portion someone in the audience called him on it by citing an earlier usage.\n\nI'm unwilling to let my dislike of Alan Alda as a performer somehow be used to determine my political affiliations when I have never voted for anyone other than a Democrat in my entire life (and I started voting in 1984)..\n\nThis is yet another completely shallow and meaningless political litmus test devised by Dataloungers.\n\nI read something on reddit that made him look bad. Alan Alda was seen in a fancy wine and cheese store in LA. He had his arms crossed and he was barking orders at the employee while referring to himself in the third person. \"Mr Alda would like some blue cheese olives, Mr Alda would like that bottle of wine\" etc. If this story is true then he's a disgusting piece of shit.\n\nAlda had a post-M*A*S*H nadir for several reasons. I don't think it was just conservatives disliking him because of his liberalism, because he wouldn't have stood out from a very large pack that way.\n\nHe was one of those actors closely associated with an era that had passed. He was often discussed during the '70s and later as emblematic of a new \"sensitive '70s male,\" and that type was out of fashion in the '80s.\n\nThen, there were also complaints from M*A*S*H fans about changes to the tone of the series in the later seasons when Alda had greater control over it; it allegedly became preachier and more didactic. I never was a viewer, but I understand Hawkeye was always giving speeches about \"this damn war.\"\n\nHowever, I think Alda has outlasted his backlash. He got great notices for Crimes and Misdemeanors and for good work in later projects like The West Wing and Marriage Story. I'd say he made the transition from long-ago household name to respected veteran actor.\n\nR48 really good analysis. I didn’t grow up with MASH and I never watched the reruns - the first movies I saw him first run were the Woody Allen movies, and he was SO good in both - and if he was anything like his reputation then he was self aware enough to send it up.\n\nI feel like I’ve also read in a few places things to the effect of : at the height of his fame and power was a bit of an egotistical asshole, but has long since learned and mellowed out. I feel like almost every famous entertainer has that period at their very height where it goes to your head a bit - it’s whether you learn from that and (for lack of a better word) evolve which is key.\n\nAnyway, count me as a pretty big fan. I’m sad he has Parkinson’s.\n\nI loved when Futurama had a MASH spoof wherein the Hawkeye robot (iHawk) had a switch that changed his behavior from \"irreverent\" to \"maudlin.\"\n\nThat pretty much sums up MASH as a tv show for me.\n\nAnd don't get me started on Klinger.\n\n[quote] read something on reddit that made him look bad.

Sort of rubbish 11 year olds say.\n\nAnd I'm NOT one of his fans.\n\nBoy some people are really touchy about Alan Alda!\n\nNo one gets this up in arms to defend Loretta Swit.\n\nBut the real talent on that show was Larry Linville and David Ogden Stiers. They were amazing.\n\nR9, thank you for leading me on an Internet journey through old episodes of SCTV. (I still remember my shocked delight when I first came across the show late one night on our little B&W tv w/UHF as a bored suburban teenager.) I found the episodes with Guy Caballero playing The Godfather. Eugene Levy playing a vengeful, haunted Floyd the Barber was fantastic. I needed that at the end of a crappy Sunday.\n\nI went to a live Conversations With... sponsored by the SAG Foundation and he was charming and very funny. His Parkinson's was pretty bad then, and this was a few years ago, so he must be in seclusion in Leonia now. He gave a wonderful demonstration of his method for learning his lines, which involved recording all the characters by himself, but using cartoon voices for the other characters. I tried it. It works!\n\nFrom “The Golden Girls” in 1990:\n\nDorothy: “You know, I never thought Ma would lose her memory. Of course, I never thought Alan Alda would get on my nerves.”\n\nUntil that very moment, I felt so terribly alone…\n\nI’m struggling through The Four Seasons, with all the false joviality and “actorly” dialogue. The weaker performers make the others look better by contrast. Alda had a real actor’s presence in this era, and Burnett really good in the first acts. The physical comedy (jumping in water and cackling is a big device in the first part of the film). I feel bad for the actors cramped into cars and boats. All the phone joviality is really cheesy, and the maudlin “serious” scenes somber and flat.\n\nIt’s a handsome film, with Victor Keeper’s photography. And the exterior footages of cars feels like a time machine, so cool to see.\n\nSandy Dennis had a hard part to play, but she was so good."
