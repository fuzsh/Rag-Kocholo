        "text": "Hawkeye, B.J., and Margaret are waiting anxiously for a shipment of medical supplies, but when they arrive, they find the boxes full of obscure supplies they don't need, like enema kits and pap smear tests. As they try to sort out the mess, Hawkeye and B.J. end up using their wits to uncover a black market operation run by one of their own colleagues, Major Brockhurst.\n\nMeanwhile, Colonel Potter struggles to deal with a severe case of eczema, which he initially tries to hide from the rest of the camp. He is eventually forced to seek help from the camp's dermatologist, Dr. Freedman, who provides him with an experimental treatment that leaves Potter feeling even more uncomfortable.\n\nThroughout the episode, tensions run high as the medical staff deals with the fallout from the black market operation and the Korean soldiers begin testing their strengths against the Americans in attempts to gain an upper hand. Matters aren't made any easier by the arrival of a visiting colonel, who has a habit of getting in the way and causing more trouble than he solves.\n\nIn the end, the doctors work together to bring down Brockhurst's operation and confront him about his illegal actions, but not before Brockhurst gets the jump on them and puts Potter's health at risk.\n\nThis episode showcases the daily struggles faced by the medical team during the Korean War, as they try to help the injured soldiers while dealing with supply shortages and personal health issues. It also highlights the prevalence of black market activities and how they can impact the human cost of war."
