        "text": "Columns\n\nWitch Kids of Instagram\n\nDecember 13, 2017\n\nTo say that none of our new, digitally-enabled witchery “works” is missing the point—and misunderstanding the theater of magic.\n\nNon-Compete Clause\n\nOctober 12, 2017\n\nFemale competition is the sharp edge of internalized sexism and the death of solidarity---and it’s utterly, irredeemably neoliberal.\n\nYou Are Not a Rebel\n\nSeptember 11, 2017\n\nThe new far right has recognized the enduring appeal of adventurism and appropriated its rhetoric for reactionary ends.\n\nA Letter to my Liberal Friends\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nIt should not have taken this long. Right now, there are a lot of well-meaning people, people who desperately want to believe in their own goodness, who only opened their eyes to the reality of modern fascism when the world woke up to Nurembergian images of screaming white boys ...\n\nFighting Words\n\nJune 02, 2017\n\nUnderstand the difference between speaking truth to power and screaming for power in the face of truth.\n\nOur Lady of Complicity\n\nMay 09, 2017\n\nAt times, Ivanka Trump's Women Who Work reads like the panicked screams of a machine attaining sentience.\n\nZero Gravity\n\nApril 11, 2017\n\nWater, whiskey, and bodily fluids of various hues glide in perfect jewel-like constellations through the thinning air.\n\nBrexit, Pursued by Despair\n\nMarch 29, 2017\n\nThe referendum was the flame; Article 50 is the fuse.
