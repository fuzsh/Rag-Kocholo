My sincere thanks also goes to the staff at UCLA’s Film and Television Archive who allowed me to watch otherwise unavailable episodes of AfterMASH. Dr. Paul Edwards and his staff at the Center for the Study for the Korean War (Independence, Missouri) were helpful in providing resources and documents related to this topic as well. I have drawn inspiration from my former UCLA professor and mentor Vivian Sobchack, whose intellectual rigor and vitality as a media studies scholar continue to astound me. The always-sensible editors at Wayne State University Press, in particular Annie Martin and Barry Keith Grant, were a joy to work with. Finally, the people who mean the most to me—my parents, Donna and Harry Diffrient, and my wife, Hye Seung Chung (who not only watched all 251 episodes of M*A*S*H with me but also offered many insights)—have supported my academic work\n\nvii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nviii\n\nfor years, giving me guidance through difficult times. I could not have written this book without their love and steadfast encouragement.\n\nIntroduction\n\nM*A*S*H in American Popular Culture\n\nA\n\nlthough twenty-five years have elapsed since “Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen” aired on February 28, 1983, time has done little to diminish the significance and influence of CBS’s M*A*S*H (1972–83), a groundbreaking television series that struggled during its first season (finishing forty-seventh in the ratings for 1972–73) but soon thereafter claimed a mainstream following that ensured success for the next ten seasons. Winning a total of fourteen Emmy Awards (out of ninety-nine nominations), not to mention scores of awards from the Directors Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, M*A*S*H has been called “the most popular pre-Seinfeld series in television history,” a program that, according to several scholars, transformed the medium and brought millions of viewers together as members of an imagined community.1 Peggy Herz has called it “the most moral show on TV,” one that transcended the generic and stylistic boundaries of the standard sitcom formula to expose, at various times throughout its long broadcast run, racial injustices, gender biases, bureaucratic mishandling, military snafus, and other pressing sociopolitical concerns of the day.2 Noralee Frankel\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\ncompares M*A*S*H to a bottle of “vintage wine” that has “improved with age,” and certainly, off-network syndication has ensured its perennial status, with millions of post–baby boom spectators introduced to the series via reruns aired as part of local stations’ daytime and late-night programming.3 One of the “most potent antiwar statement[s] in American history,”4 M*A*S*H has been translated into fifteen languages and has aired in over twenty-five countries, becoming not only a national institution but also an international phenomenon, as meaningful for people in Australia or Germany as it is for stateside audiences. However, all this hyperbole should not blind us to the fact that M*A*S*H has come under attack for proselytizing and for sanitizing wartime experiences for the sake of commercial entertainment. In contrast to a critic like John Leonard, who believes that “M*A*S*H dazzled the sitcom into sentience,” Barry Putterman describes this and another CBS series of the 1970s, All in the Family (1971–79), as “midcult gasbags” that “all but bracket off their little bromides in neon.”5 As an example of that “most blatantly social form” of comedy, satire, M*A*S*H was especially lamentable from Putterman’s point of view, for it replaced the “outcast horseplay” and intentional infantilism associated with such shortlived, largely forgotten slapstick TV programs as I’m Dickens . . . He’s Fenster (ABC, 1962–63) and Valentine’s Day (ABC, 1964–65) with “the smug, moralizing wheezes of doctors and military officers.”6 Whether or not one agrees with Putterman that a “historical inevitability” transformed the televisual landscape for the worse, it is hard to dismiss his argument that a certain self-righteousness pervades the programs made for CBS under Fred Silverman’s reign, “quality” TV series like The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970–77), All in the Family, and M*A*S*H, which collectively marked a shift away from the network’s “hick-centric” programming of the 1960s (The Beverly Hillbillies [1962–71], Green Acres [1965–71], and so\n\nM*A*S*H in American Popular Culture\n\nforth) toward more “sophisticated” sitcoms that resonated with the urban, upscale audiences of the 1970s. Perhaps the most strident yet astute criticism directed at M*A*S*H comes from the cultural historians Mike Budd and Clay Steinman, who in a 1988 essay attempt to unpack the “institutional and discursive apparatus” of this outwardly subversive yet ultimately conservative series.7 To neosituationists like Budd and Steinman, both M*A*S*H and the middle-class fan culture surrounding the show throughout its original broadcast constituted a “flow,” an intermingling of stories and commodities. Such a flow, in their words, “mystified” capital and masked the medium’s power to reinforce or reproduce dominant ideological values through a televisual style that was functional, self-effacing, invisible, and thus capable of luring audiences into an apparently three-dimensional space where “realistic” yet outlandish characters “seemed to have a life of their own.”8 The “capitalization, dematerialization, and idealization” of this “warmedy” (an awkward term used by Budd, Steinman, and other critics to denote a “comedy overlaid with empathetic audience identification”) extended even to the lives and celebrity status of the actors who played the show’s universally loathed or much-loved characters, from Larry Linville, who was never able to escape his pitch-perfect (if single-note) personification of insufferable neurosis, Major Frank Burns, to Mike Farrell, who parlayed the instant likeability of his B. J. Hunnicutt into a kind of “ethereal glow,” lending warmth and sincerity to his offscreen support of the National Coalition to Ban Handguns during the 1980s. The cartoonist Bill DeOre of the Dallas Morning News offered his less-than-impressed take on the sentimentality of the series on March 1, 1983 (one day after the finale), when he modified the acronym to read “Mostly Absurd Slanted Hogwash.”9 As is obvious from this quick survey of comments on the show, M*A*S*H readily sparks opposing responses: to some\n\n3\n\nIntroduction\n\n4\n\nviewers, it remains the peak of network television, while to others, it smacks of moral superiority or, perhaps worse, simply “isn’t funny.” This latter sentiment, certainly debatable, is uttered by a teenaged character in an episode of the retronostalgic one-season wonder Freaks and Geeks (NBC, 1999), just one of the many recent American television programs that, while indebted to M*A*S*H in one way or another, nonetheless make derisive jokes about the show (which are probably lost on their primary viewing audience). One way of gauging a television program’s success and historical significance is to examine its impact on subsequent cultural productions. Several television programs have referenced M*A*S*H. This sometimes takes the form of homage, as in several St. Elsewhere (NBC, 1982–88) episodes, or parody, as in “Breaking Out Is Hard to Do,” an episode of the animated series Family Guy (FOX, 1999–) that features an Asian man (whose ethnicity is not specified) firing rockets from his helicopter at the show’s protagonists and pretending that he is “shooting at Alan Alda and Jamie Farr” (proclaiming at one point, “Take that, wisecracking meatball surgeons!”). Another way of measuring a TV show’s popularity or influence is to look “outside the box” at the amount of ancillary merchandise produced for both hard-core fans and general audiences at the time of its original broadcast. Throughout the run of the series, a number of M*A*S*H-related goods—some officially licensed, some illegal knockoffs—could be purchased in specialty shops and department stores and can today be found on the auction block or on eBay. These include flashlights, air fresheners, shot glasses, ceramic TV-shaped salt and pepper shakers, gold-tone bookmarks, Lucite key chains, ViewMaster reels, plastic canteens, action figures, scaled models, and miniature military vehicles. Some of the most popular items during the 1970s and 1980s were M*A*S*H-themed jigsaw puzzles, board games, and T-shirts, not to mention a wide range of clothing acces-\n\nM*A*S*H in American Popular Culture\n\nsories, from camouflage-print nylon wallets with Velcro attachments, to children’s wristwatches, to stainless steel dog tags. Mothers and fathers shopping for their kids’ back-toschool items could pick up camouflage green pencils inside yellow cases with the show’s acronymic letters emblazoned on the front. At home, they could sip coffee from their official M*A*S*H mugs (diner white and featuring green letters with a red cross) while reading any one of the fourteen novels that make up the “MASH Goes to . . .” series, written—in slapdash fashion—by William E. Butterworth and Richard Hooker (a.k.a. Richard Hornberger, the author of the original 1968 novel). These latter texts were published by Pocket Books beginning in 1973 (with MASH Goes to Maine), allowing fans of the television series to read about the further adventures of Hawkeye, Trapper, and the other members of the original 4077 who have managed to make their way to such international locales as London, Montreal, Morocco, Moscow, and Paris (in addition to U.S. cities like Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans, and San Francisco). Such varied types of memorabilia attest to the depth and breadth of the fan cultures surrounding M*A*S*H, a television program whose sponsors (such as Honda, which commissioned posters of the cast members on motorcycles following the final episode) took an active role in promoting both the mobility and likeability of the surgical unit, in addition to participating in the synergistic interplay of converging media forms. To date, over two dozen English-language books about CBS’s landmark medical comedy have been published.10 However, while there is no short supply of episode summaries, cast interviews, trivia quiz booklets, and even recipe guides,11 only one of these publications—James W. Wittebols’s Watching M*A*S*H, Watching America: A Social History of the 1972–1983 Television Series—has attempted to examine this TV classic from a scholarly point of view. A valuable contri-\n\n5\n\nIntroduction\n\n6\n\nbution to the field of media studies, Wittebols’s text provides ample evidence that M*A*S*H accurately reflected the zeitgeist of the 1970s and early 1980s, a time bracketed by two Republican presidencies.12 For all of its strengths, though, Wittebols’s book does not fully address the many contradictions and complexities of the series, which is at once antiauthoritarian and a cultural institution in its own right. Tipping over sacred cows yet often falling back on superficial platitudes and politically correct rhetoric, M*A*S*H—over the course of eleven years—flitted almost schizophrenically between comedy and tragedy, satire and sincerity. This oscillation nevertheless effectively distilled Korean War (and Vietnam War) veterans’ conflicting experiences while reflecting the often-contradictory attitudes among the mainstream populace about the roles that the U.S. military and CIA were playing at home and abroad throughout the Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan administrations. Although Wittebols convincingly makes the case that M*A*S*H mutated, season-to-season, to accommodate cast changes and reflect the shifting cultural ethos of America as the country left an unpopular war in Vietnam behind only to enter an era of renewed cold war conservatism and political interest in places like Central America and the Middle East, his chronological analysis makes for a somewhat fateful journey through eleven (or, more accurately, ten and a half) seasons of the most dynamic, unpredictable television program of its generation. In this book I have tried to supplement Wittebols’s sophisticated study, yet also go beyond it in terms of addressing underlying themes, narrative strategies, and stylistic innovations that have been overlooked by others. A fundamental argument that animates my exploration of key episodes is that M*A*S*H and its oft-ridiculed spin-off AfterMASH (CBS, 1983–84) openly indulged a neoliberalist perspective on the cold war era that acknowledged, rather than masked, the United States’ conflicting roles in both building\n\nM*A*S*H in American Popular Culture\n\nand destroying East and Southeast Asian nations in the name of democracy. In the final analysis, I contend that the series was a cultural phenomenon that resonated with diverse audiences precisely because of its contradictory appeals; its “soft,” secular-humanist approach to war and the people of Korea as well as its jujitsu-like jabs at what J. Hoberman has referred to as “empty patriotism, official bombast, and military life.”13 The most pronounced generic characteristic of M*A*S*H in its literary, cinematic, and televisual incarnations is its use of dark comedy to deconstruct sacrosanct or taboo subjects (like death, religion, and sexual promiscuousness) while mocking the military brass as well as the political elite. Indeed, there is a constant stream of wisecracks, puns, and practical jokes in the show that, besides supplying the men and women of Mobile Army Surgical Hospital 4077 with a kind of emotional release valve (one that allows them to “stay sane” in an insane environment), also reveals the underlying absurdity of war. A large portion of this book supplies examples of the ways in which the television series blends humor with humanism, biting satire with populist hope. I explore the ways in which this logic of the ridiculous resonated with the changing ideals of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a period in American history when optimism was giving way to pessimism. Many critics have already suggested some of the ways in which M*A*S*H can be recontextualized and read as an allegorical commentary on the war in Vietnam, which dragged on until 1975 (seasons 3 and 4 of the television series) and generated fierce debates on the home front about U.S. involvement in international affairs. I too pursue such a reading in the opening chapters, although I strive to diversify that approach by weaving in references to other examples of antiwar fiction. But rather than focus wholly on the allegorical implications of the series, I attempt to recuperate its significance as a Korean War text, paying particular attention to its\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\n\n8\n\ncontinuous mobilization of Korean characters, iconography, and language (a topic I highlight in the book’s final chapter). Between the first and final chapters are sections devoted to such varied themes as trauma, boredom, entertainment, community, sexuality, racism, xenophobia, and benevolence. I have designed this study to take the reader from contextual issues (related to M*A*S*H ’s creation, reception, and circulation in extradiegetic spheres of marketing and consumption) to textual issues (concerning the series’ formal innovations, narrative strategies, and motivic focus on the aforementioned themes). In short, this book addresses the origins of the TV series, with brief references to Richard Hornberger’s 1968 novel and Robert Altman and Ring Lardner Jr.’s 1970 film of the same title; its relationship to another, earlier example of antiwar fiction (Joseph Heller’s Catch-22); the unique contributions to antiwar discourse made by the show’s “authors” (in particular Alan Alda, Larry Gelbart, Burt Metcalfe, and Gene Reynolds); the largely overlooked experiments in televisual style and narrative structure that its writers and directors made; the reception of the program from its first season to its last; its critically disparaged yet politically progressive spinoff, AfterMASH; and its various extradiegetic permutations in American popular culture (in the form of intertextual allusions in other TV series as well as ancillary merchandise and memorabilia). Because I approach M*A*S*H from a sympathetic yet critically objective perspective that bridges different cultural backgrounds (American and Korean) and academic disciplines (media studies, cold war history, and East Asian studies), this book not only consolidates vital historical and theoretical approaches to the series but also addresses issues often overlooked by fans and critics. For instance, few scholars have written about M*A*S*H as a Korean War comedydrama, something that I—as someone deeply invested in Ko-\n\nM*A*S*H in American Popular Culture\n\nrean cultural history—seek to recuperate and highlight without necessarily diminishing its significance as a commentary on the situation in Vietnam. Moreover, my work makes use of the archival materials contained in the Larry Gelbart, Gene Reynolds, and Burt Metcalfe files at UCLA’s Arts Library Special Collections. Indeed, this is the first published study of M*A*S*H to incorporate information derived from the original scripts, memos, personal correspondence, and collected papers of the above writers and producers (some of whom made research trips to South Korea), not to mention the first to delve into the political implications of a television series that did more to inscribe the idea of “Korea” in America’s collective unconscious than any other cultural production of the twentieth century. Chapters 1 through 4 examine the making and partaking of M*A*S*H as a literary, cinematic, and televisual phenomenon, beginning with the 1968 publication of Richard Hornberger’s bestselling novel of the same title (minus the asterisks and written under the pen name Richard Hooker). Because limited space prevents me from exploring the cultural phenomenon of M*A*S*H in all of its permutations (including a proposed radio program as well as the vast array of ancillary merchandise that could be purchased in toy stores and gift shops throughout the run of the series), the bulk of my analysis falls squarely on its televisual incarnation, which, as I have mentioned, has thus far sparked only one scholarly study. Besides establishing the conceptual framework with which to buttress my subsequent chapters and case studies, the first third of the book therefore explores the genesis of the TV series, the historical contexts of its original broadcast and eventual syndication, and its reception. While M*A*S*H was sometimes criticized for being a toned-down, laundered version of the original book and film, its humor—especially during the first four seasons—often relied on the harsh juxtaposition of bloodshed and jokes, usu-\n\n9\n\nIntroduction\n\n10\n\nally aimed at warmongering officers like Lieutenant General Robert “Iron Guts” Kelly (James Gregory) and the anticommunist CIA agent Colonel Flagg (Edgar Winter). However, death was never a direct source of humor, and the creators made a conscious decision to refrain from using a prerecorded laugh track during the scenes set in the OR. The ludicrous nature of war and military bureaucracy was, however, a subject of numerous episodes over the course of the show’s eleven-year run, including one from the fourth season—“The Late Captain Pierce”—in which a visibly living surgeon learns that he is, according to army records, officially dead. As a kind of Orwellian “un-person,” the “deceased” Hawkeye is thus victim to a bureaucratic snafu of the highest order, one that denies him his weekly paycheck and sends shockwaves through his network of friends and family back home in Crabapple Cove. This episode and several like it, with their unremitting focus on mortality and uncertainty, lend M*A*S*H a depth of meaning and philosophical insight into thanatological themes that have rarely been explored so compellingly on television. The sober yet sordid, sensitive yet irreverent tone of the series may not seem as radical today as it did to audiences in America at the time of its 1972 debut, before the war in Vietnam had come to a complete halt and amid governmental scandals and cover-ups such as Watergate. However, because its satiric focus was on the military industrial complex and other dehumanizing institutions that had begun to look ridiculous in the eyes of the disenfranchised and dissatisfied masses, M*A*S*H can arguably be called television’s “first dark comedy.”14 Although there had been generic predecessors to M*A*S*H as early as the mid-1950s, when The Phil Silvers Show: You’ll Never Get Rich (a.k.a. Sergeant Bilko, 1955–59) became a television staple, no other militaryfocused sitcom—not McHale’s Navy (ABC, 1962–66), not McKeever and the Colonel (NBC, 1962–63), not Gomer Pyle,\n\nM*A*S*H in American Popular Culture\n\nU.S.M.C. (CBS, 1964–69), and not Hogan’s Heroes (CBS, 1965–71)—was as satiric as M*A*S*H, even if its black humor did gradually give way to feel-good populism during the early Reagan years. Much has been made of the fact that M*A*S*H ran nearly four times longer than the Korean War, which lasted from June 25, 1950, to July 27, 1953.15 The show’s longevity speaks not only to a public consensus built, ironically, on a combination of compassion and dissent, but also to the show’s unflagging attention to detail and the long-term dedication of its core group of creative personnel, many of whom worked twelve- and fifteen-hour days of shooting and who, in return, took home armloads of awards for acting, writing, and directing. One celebrated member of that group—Alan Alda—deserves special attention as a contributor both in front of and behind the camera. Fittingly, a large portion of the final section of this book, encompassing chapters 6 through 8, puts special emphasis on Alda’s onscreen and offscreen personas, which provide us with the proper epistemological lens through which to view the series’ complex treatment of gender, sexuality, and identity, not to mention questions of race and place, the latter made all the more relevant by Hawkeye’s paternalistic affection for “local indigenous personnel”—Koreans who may benefit from his benevolence yet rarely have the opportunity to speak for themselves or exert any agency within the MASH unit. It is important to point out here that the first Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals sprang up after the end of World War II but would not be put to use in a combat situation until the outbreak of the Korean War. Officially organized by the U.S. Army in 1948, MASH units were designed as fully functional hospitals capable of handling large numbers of incoming wounded (transported via helicopter and ambulance) close to the front.16 Initially consisting of sixty beds each (in addition to Quonset huts and canvas tents for eating, sleep-\n\n11\n\nIntroduction\n\n12\n\ning, and worshipping in) and equipped with the most up-todate surgical instruments, these medical units represented a modern alternative to the portable evacuation hospitals and battalion aid stations that had been used during the Second World War; while large, they could quickly and efficiently be moved to different locales as part of an evasive tactic (“bugging out”). Although they would undergo design changes over the course of the Korean War and became less mobile as a result of lulls in the fighting, these units retained a strong sense of community for the surrogate families of doctors and nurses therein and remained central to the U.S. military’s short-term goal of reducing the number of American causalities as well as its long-term goal of securing stability in the region. Although a MASH unit (the 212th) was sent to Iraq in 2003, the last of these medical organizations stationed in South Korea (the 43rd, formally the 8055th) was decommissioned on June 11, 1997, at a ceremony held at Camp Humphreys, Pyongtaek, and attended by cast and crew members of the television series M*A*S*H.17 The series, while disparaged by some critics for sugarcoating the experiences of Korean War veterans, has also been credited for bringing the heroic efforts of the real medical personnel to light. Although it certainly deserves recognition for accurately depicting the communal ethos—if not the sexual shenanigans—that existed within the camps,18 M*A*S*H does depart from historical record and the facts surrounding the actual makeup and mobility of these medical units, which each consisted of at least two hundred staff members who were forced to periodically “put it up, take it down, put it up, take it down” throughout the three-year conflict. According to a technical consultant on the series, Otto F. Apel, “mobility was the name of the game. That was a concept we learned well.” For Apel and the rest of the men and women in the 8076th, the mantra was “move it, move it, move it.”19\n\nM*A*S*H in American Popular Culture\n\nAnother MASH unit, the 8055th, was forced to relocate twenty-seven times during the first sixteen months of the war.20 Over the course of its eleven-year network broadcast (totaling 251 episodes), M*A*S*H depicted this “put it up, take it down” scenario on only three occasions,21 for reasons that are specific to a long-running TV series whose exterior scenes were filmed at a central location: the Fox Ranch in Calabasas, California (interiors were shot on Sound Stage 9 at Fox). However, what M*A*S*H may have lacked in terms of historical accuracy was made up for by the determination of Larry Gelbart, Gene Reynolds, and Burt Metcalfe to creatively parlay documented wartime experiences into a heightened form of “mediated realism” contingent on the behind-thescenes involvement of actual surgeons as well as the onscreen antics of a largely stationary, rather than mobile, unit (modeled after the MASH 8055th) to which we, the audience, return each week.22 The creators and producers of the show not only checked for accuracy by using a 1950 Sears Roebuck catalog but also drew historical details from William L. White’s book Back Down the Ridge, an account of “the process a wounded man goes through” in being transported “from an aid station to a M*A*S*H unit, then to Japan.”23 Moreover, they sought out and consulted medical advisers, such as Dr. Walter Dishell, who monitored dialogue and ensured that the scripts adhered as closely as possible to the particular patois—the unique forms of speech or wartime vernacular—put to both practical and poetic use by veterans of the Korean conflict.24 It is to those individuals, the men and women who risked their lives stitching up wounded soldiers and civilians in the Korean War, that this book is dedicated.\n\n13\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 1\n\nA Novel Idea and an Unconventional War Film\n\nT\n\no tell the story of M*A*S*H as a televisual phenomenon, it is necessary to first reflect on its literary and cinematic forerunners, which anticipated many of the themes that would be cultivated and treated with greater sensitivity and complexity during the program’s eleven-season run on CBS. So, let us now turn our attention to that best-selling antiwar novel from 1968, which set the satiric tone adopted in Robert Altman’s film of the same title two years later and in the award-winning television series that Larry Gelbart, Gene Reynolds, and Burt Metcalfe subsequently produced throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Written by Dr. Richard Hornberger under the pen name of Richard Hooker as a semi-autobiographical portrait of his time in South Korea, MASH: A Novel about Three Army Doctors (note the lack of asterisks) combined the author’s personal reminiscences of actual events and real people with fictionalized dramatizations and characterizations.1 Initially rejected by more than a dozen publishing houses, Hornberger’s manuscript made its way into the offices of William Morrow, the New York–based company that in October 1968 published this raucous story of free-spirited surgeons who\n\n15\n\nChapter 1\n\n16\n\ntake to booze and hit the links to escape the daily horrors surrounding them. Part of a cultural trend in English-language publishing, MASH rode a wave of success based on word-ofmouth recommendations and contributed to the rise to a new generic dominant during the 1960s: the antiwar novel, earlier epitomized by Joseph Heller’s Catch-22 (1961).2 Like the film and television adaptations that followed, Hornberger’s novel focuses on the men and women who work twelve-hour shifts at a fictional Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, the 4077, located dangerously close to the front lines and about twenty-five miles away from the next MASH unit (the 6073). Of these individuals, three in particular— Benjamin Franklin “Hawkeye” Pierce, “Trapper” John McIntyre, and Augustus Bedford “Duke” Forrest—stand out as the main protagonists. These skirt-chasing doctors quickly develop an antagonistic relationship to the “regular army” types represented by Major Johnathon Hobson, Captain Frank Burns, and Major Margaret Houlihan. That hostility distinguishes the trio as countercultural heroes willing to risk being court-martialed for the sake of a good practical joke. It is Hawkeye, though, who occupies the most prominent spot in the loosely episodic plot, effectively suturing the strands of the narrative together through his bemused observations about the chaos and calamity engulfing the camp (which is nevertheless kept running smoothly by the diminutive Corporal “Radar” O’Reilly). This privileging of Hawkeye would eventually shape the textual contours of the television program, which—although an ensemble series filled with nearly a dozen talented character actors—is really Alan Alda’s show (both in front of and behind the cameras). In fact, many biographical details concerning Hawkeye, who would undergo significant changes over the course of the TV series’ eleven seasons, are provided in the first chapter of Hornberger’s book. It informs us, for instance, that Pierce hails from Crabapple Cove, Maine (the actual birthplace of the author),\n\nA Novel Idea and an Unconventional War Film\n\nand that his unusual nickname derives from James Fenimore Cooper’s 1826 novel The Last of the Mohicans (his father’s favorite book). Readers are introduced not only to Hawkeye but also to Duke in the novel’s opening chapter, which provides the first of many peeks behind the door of tent number six (“The Swamp”) and offers details about these doctors’ family histories and cultural backgrounds. Although coming from two different regions of the United States (Maine and Georgia), Hawkeye and Duke form an immediate bond because of their similar ages (both are in their late twenties) and their shared insolence in the face of military bureaucracy and hypocrisy. This attitude casts in relief the sanctimonious demeanor of Hobson, another character brought to light in chapter 1. Prone to prayer and subjected to practical jokes, this rather inept thirty-five-year-old chest surgeon represents an easy target for his younger tent mates. In chapter 2 of the novel, he is honorably discharged from service by Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake following a skirmish with Duke (who earlier tackled the nincompoop). In Hobson’s absence, several other characters make their way to the 4077. Scrawny and enigmatic (as opposed to Wayne Rogers’s sturdy and straightforward portrayal in the TV series), Trapper John arrives from Boston in chapter 3, partially concealed behind layers of parka and hesitant to say much about himself, letting his skills in the OR do most of his talking. Quickly gaining a reputation in the MASH unit as a top-notch “cutter,” he finally drops his guard once Hawkeye remembers that McIntyre had been an old football rival during their college years. Chapter 4 ushers Father Patrick Mulcahy into the spotlight. Also known as “Dago Red” (because of the color of his hair), this man of the cloth is a less charitable and kindhearted soul than the camp chaplain who would become such a beloved figure in the television series. As in the film version, it is Dago Red who informs us that Hawkeye and his\n\n17\n\nChapter 1\n\n18\n\ncohorts—unlike the enlisted men and women—were drafted into the Army Medical Corps. Joining Mulcahy on the religious front is a character unique to Hornberger’s novel, “Shaking” Sammy, a Protestant preacher whom Hawkeye and Trapper so dislike that they decide to “sacrifice” him; that is, they threaten to make a human Molotov cocktail out of the “holy roller” by tying him to a wooden cross in a mock ritual designed to scare the God out of him. Another subversive act of sacrifice surfaces in chapter 5, which is devoted to the “Painless Pole” Walter Koskiusko Waldowski and his unsuccessful attempt to commit suicide. As the camp’s dentist, Captain Waldowski has a special relationship to the other medical personnel in the camp, mitigating the oral pain he inflicts on them by running a round-theclock poker table out of his tent. Blessed with a reputation for being physically well endowed, he becomes depressed and fears that he might be homosexual after a string of unsuccessful sexual encounters with several nurses. “I think that it’s dead,” Walt at one point states, referring to his penis (known throughout the camp as the “Pride of Hamtramck”). This grief between the sheets is what leads him to consider taking his own life in an elaborate, Last Supper-like ritual involving a black capsule that, when ingested, merely knocks him unconscious (leaving Painless worry-free and refreshed the next morning). The book’s main cast of characters is completed with the addition of Captain Frank Burns and Major Houlihan in chapter 6. A member of the Army Nurse Corps, the fortyyear-old “femme fatale” Houlihan earns the nickname “Hotlips” after her late-night rendezvous with Burns is broadcast over the camp’s loudspeaker (thanks to a strategically placed microphone under their bed). Like Hobson before them, Houlihan and Burns are made the butt of practical jokes. However, while the Chief Nurse is eventually accepted by the Swampmen, Burns is sent packing for the States after\n\nA Novel Idea and an Unconventional War Film\n\nhe hurls a coffee pot at Hawkeye. Besides them, other minor characters appear for the first time in these middle sections of the book, such as the “bedpan jockey” Private Boone, the anesthesiologist Captain “Ugly” John Black, the respected surgeon Roger “the Dodger” Danforth, and the seventeenyear-old Korean houseboy Ho-jon, who has been drafted by the army and whom Hawkeye is eventually able to send to his alma mater back in the States (Androscoggin College) after raising money for the tuition. This paves the way for another altruistic endeavor on Hawkeye’s and Trapper’s part, depicted in chapter 8. Asked by a U.S. congressman to fly to Japan and operate on his injured son, the so-called pros from Dover arrive there—golf clubs in tow—only to focus their attention on a patient in greater need of their services, a Japanese-American orphan who is tended to and subsequently adopted by Hawkeye’s old friend “Me Lay” Marston (an American anesthesiologist stationed in Kokura). Such displays of American benevolence are in keeping with Hawkeye’s humanitarian values and are only partially offset by his having earlier generated the necessary revenue for Ho-jon’s education through a “sacrilegious” staging of the Passion Play. With Trapper John cast as a crucified Jesus Christ, Hawkeye sold autographed photos of “the Lord” to American GIs at a dollar apiece. This plus the references in chapter 11 to an “epileptic whore” at Mrs. Lee’s house of prostitution (who has convulsions each time she services a client) are the most controversial elements in Hornberger’s novel, which is otherwise devoted to medical procedures and male-dominated sports such as football and golf—two pastimes pursued by the doctors toward the end of the novel. Once Hawkeye and Trapper return to the 4077 after their trip to Japan, they encounter a sharp increase in the number of casualties, operating on everyone from a Turkish soldier to a Puerto Rican kid to a Dutch private to a Chinese prisoner of\n\n19\n\nChapter 1\n\n20\n\nwar. Given the endless supply of incoming wounded (“black, white, yellow—friend and foe,” whose “bellies, chests, necks, arteries, arms, legs, eyes, testicles, kidneys, [and] spinal cords, all shot to hell,”3 are beginning to blend into one corporeal nightmare for the surgeons), it is not surprising that Hawkeye, Trapper, and Duke should welcome new additions to the camp; first a surgeon named Captain Bridget McCarthy from Boston (a female forerunner of Major Charles Emerson Winchester III in the television series), then Colonel DeLong (Blake’s temporary replacement), and finally Captain Oliver Wendell “Spearchucker” Jones (an African American neurosurgeon who had once been a professional football player). Of these latter three characters, only Jones—who is brought in from the 72nd Evacuation Hospital in Taegu and used as a secret weapon in the 4077’s victorious scrimmage against General Hammond’s football team—would appear in the cinematic adaptation. The novel’s twelfth chapter delves into the prejudice and racism that Jones has encountered as an African American doctor stationed in Korea. Jones’s self-described “black man’s burden” is exacerbated by those “goddamn phonies . . . who knock themselves out to show you that your color doesn’t make any difference, and if it wasn’t for your color they wouldn’t pay any attention to you.”4 The initial tension between Jones and Duke, a Southerner who refers to the new arrival as a “nigra,” is one of the most interesting passages in the book, a potentially explosive encounter that is significantly diffused in the cinematic adaptation because Forrest is sidelined throughout the latter half of the film, which nevertheless culminates—like the novel before it—with him and Hawkeye receiving news that they are shipping out soon (leaving Trapper John behind, since he has “six months of servitude still ahead of him”). “Not since Catch-22 has the struggle to maintain sanity in the rampant insanity of war been told in such outrageously\n\nA Novel Idea and an Unconventional War Film\n\nfunny terms.” So went the book jacket blurb penned by Ring Lardner Jr., the once blacklisted screenwriter who first read Hornberger’s novel when it was in galley form a few months before it was published in 1968. Decades earlier, Lardner had written screenplays for such celebrated studio-era classics as Woman of the Year (1942), Laura (1944), and Forever Amber (1947) before being singled out by the House on Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in the late 1940s as one of the Hollywood Ten. His career a casualty of the McCarthy-era witch hunts, he was sentenced to a year in prison for his communist affiliations and blacklisted by studio heads. At the age of fifty-three, Lardner saw M*A*S*H as a means of reclaiming his place in the industry while remaining true to his political beliefs, and he was so smitten with Hornberger’s unconventional war story that he immediately drafted a screenplay and sent it to Ingo Preminger, his former agent. The brother of Otto Preminger, Ingo saw great potential in Lardner’s treatment and forwarded it to David Brown and Richard Zanuck, who were then in charge of Twentieth Century-Fox (ironically, the studio that had fired the blacklisted writer in 1947). They likewise understood the value of the material and, after buying the movie rights to Hornberger’s book for $100,000, approached over a dozen different directors (including George Roy Hill, Stanley Kubrick, Sidney Lumet, Mike Nichols, Arthur Penn, Sydney Pollack, and Franklin Schaffner, all of whom were either too busy to do the film or indifferent to the idea) before finally agreeing to hire Robert Altman—a longtime director of television episodes—for the job. The forty-four-year-old Altman, a former air force lieutenant who had nurtured the idea of making a farcical film about World War I flyers called The Chicken and the Hawk (which never got off the ground), was initially hesitant about the project given the “racist” aspects of the original book and the “dreadful” quality of Lardner’s script.5 But the maverick\n\n21\n\nChapter 1\n\n22\n\nauteur, who had already earned recognition in Hollywood as the director of Countdown (1968), from which he was fired by Jack Warner of Warner Bros., and That Cold Day in the Park (1969), relented once he realized that M*A*S*H might offer him an opportunity to bring his much-delayed war film project to fruition while slyly commenting on the situation in Vietnam.6 With this in mind, he began piecing together a large stock company of actors including recognized talents like Robert Duvall, Elliott Gould, and Donald Sutherland (who were suggested by Ingo Preminger) as well as newcomers from television and theatre such as David Arkin, René Auberjonois, Roger Bowen, Tim Brown, Bud Cort, Michael Murphy, and Tom Skerritt. These and other performers would lend the already sprawling story even greater dimension through structured improvisations before the camera. Beginning in April 1969, Altman and his stock company camped out at Fox’s Lake Malibu ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains, where filming commenced without studio interference. Although Altman frequently fills the widescreen frame with peripheral characters, two in particular—Donald Sutherland’s “Hawkeye” Pierce and Elliott Gould’s “Trapper” John McIntyre—take center stage throughout this story of martini-sipping draftee surgeons trying to make the best of a bad situation. Besides them, all the other major characters in the novel—Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt), Frank Burns (Robert Duvall), Margaret Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), Henry Blake (Roger Bowen), Father Mulcahy (René Auberjonois), Radar O’Reilly (Gary Burghoff), “Spearchucker” Jones (Fred Williamson), the “Painless” Pole (John Schuck), and Lorenzo Boone (Bud Cort)—appear in the film.7 And while its shaggy narrative is once again set during the Korean War, Altman and Lardner intended the film to be a blatant criticism of the fighting in Vietnam, which—by the time of M*A*S*H ’s January 25, 1970, theatrical debut—had divided\n\nA Novel Idea and an Unconventional War Film\n\nAmericans along ideological faultlines and political affiliations.8 Regardless, in both the novel and the motion picture there are several references to Korea, including early attempts by the doctors to send Ho-jon (the Korean houseboy who serves cocktails in The Swamp) to the States. However, as I will show in the ensuing chapters, the underlying “Koreanness” of M*A*S*H did not truly emerge until the television series was put into production by Twentieth Century-Fox. Before the film’s 1970 release, the studio had weathered one box-office flop after another and was thought to be out of touch with the youth market. In the span of just three years, the company’s aging chairman and CEO, Darryl F. Zanuck, had witnessed the big-budget comedy-musicals Dr. Doolittle (1967), Star! (1968), and Hello, Dolly! (1969) sink under the weight of their ambitions and fail to turn a profit. Zanuck’s son, Richard, who was then president of the company, was forced to resign by the Fox board of directors in December of 1970, the year the studio lost nearly $80 million and was, according to Douglas Gomery, “on the verge of having to declare bankruptcy.” In The Hollywood Studio System, Gomery discusses this stockholder shakeup in detail and explains that the Annapolis graduate and Rhodes Scholar Dennis Stanfill replaced Zanuck as chairman of the board.9 Stanfill, along with the newly appointed president Gordon Stulberg, inherited the two films that helped wash away some of the struggling studio’s red ink: M*A*S*H and Patton (1970). These very different motion pictures were joined by another, less profitable (but more expensive) war film produced by Twentieth Century-Fox that year, Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). As an ideological corrective or counterbalance situated opposite these latter two Fox war epics (especially Patton, which relished in the kind of hagiographic hero-worship that was reminiscent of Hollywood’s classic World War II films), Altman’s M*A*S*H was a commercial and critical break-\n\n23\n\nChapter 1\n\n24\n\nthrough, third only to Universal’s Airport and Paramount’s Love Story that year at the domestic box office. It won the prestigious Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival and the Best Picture Award from the New York Films Critics Circle. It also garnered five Academy Award nominations, including an Oscar win for Lardner Jr. (Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium). The fact that this unconventional film, which had been made for roughly half of its $3.5 million budget and had even flirted with an “X” rating before its triumphant first screening in a three-thousand-seat San Francisco theater, ended up being one of the highest grossing motion pictures of 1970 (raking in roughly $73 million), is evidence of the general distrust among the populace for government officials and military leaders at that time. It is also a testament to motion picture audiences’ increased interest in nontraditional forms of narrative, especially when wedded to a countercultural sensibility. Besides his trademark use of improvisational performances, overlapping dialogue, ambient sound, widescreen cinematography, fog filters, and the zoom lens, Altman’s revisionist approach to the war-film genre is worth noting, not only because it anticipates his subsequent deconstructions of the western (McCabe and Mrs. Miller, 1971), the hardboiled detective film (The Long Goodbye, 1973), and the backstage musical (Nashville, 1975), but also because the film’s generic hybridity, tonal schizophrenia, and crisscrossing plotlines seem to have later influenced the creators of the television series. As the next chapter illustrates, Gelbart, Metcalfe, and Reynolds partially retained the film’s unblinking depiction of hospital gore, its privileging of rebellious personalities, its celebration of libation and other forms of hedonistic activity, its playful display of sexual foreplay, its iconoclastic take on military authority and religious hypocrisy, and its antiestablishment attitude, which appealed to audiences within the counterculture during and immediately after the Vietnam\n\nA Novel Idea and an Unconventional War Film\n\nWar era. If the series did not exploit the Rabelaisian connotations of such things as forcefully as did Altman’s film, its emphasis on traumatized bodies and the graphic display of the doctors’ blood-smeared smocks made it all the more extraordinary as an example of television “dramedy.”\n\n25\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 2\n\nBig Ambitions for the Small Screen\n\nW\n\nilliam Self, Richard Berger, and other studio executives at Twentieth Century-Fox wanting to cash in further on the critical and commercial success of Altman’s M*A*S*H sent Gene Reynolds the original novel and asked the former child actor-turned-television producer to create a pilot episode based on the antics of the 4077 medical personnel. Having not only served in the United States Navy during World War II but also worked as an actor during the studio system era and honed his skills behind the camera on an earlier Twentieth Century-Fox television project, Room 222 (ABC, 1969–74), Reynolds intuitively understood the strengths and weaknesses of the source material. He knew that if a TV version of both the book and the filmed adaptation were to succeed on the small screen, it would be necessary to bring a talented screenwriter on board, someone who likewise appreciated the medium’s unique capacity to at once comfort and challenge millions of viewers on a weekly basis. In 1971 Reynolds contacted Larry Gelbart, an old friend who had been living in England for nearly ten years. Decades earlier, Gelbart had worked for the Armed Forces Radio Network and then, after World War II, cut his teeth as a joke\n\n27\n\nChapter 2\n\n28\n\nwriter for Fred Allen, Sid Caesar, Jack Carson, Bob Hope, and Danny Thomas, among other legendary comedians of stage and screen. Hope had encouraged Gelbart to transition to television work during the 1950s, although Gelbart’s most famous pre-M*A*S*H gig was as a cowriter (with Burt Shevelove) of the Broadway musical A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, which debuted in 1962. It was almost exactly ten years after the spectacular success of Forum that Gelbart was called on by Reynolds to return to the United States and collaborate on a television series that would eventually become both men’s greatest claim to fame. After agreeing to coproduce the pilot, which the CBS head of programming Fred Silverman had expressed early interest in, Gelbart went to work on the teleplay in mid-June of 1971, emphasizing certain characters in the novel while eliminating others (such as Duke Forrest). The story that he and Reynolds finally settled on was based on a plotline that had been largely omitted from Altman’s film, one that revolved around Hawkeye’s efforts to raise money to send Ho-jon to college in the United States. The duo pitched this idea to Alan Wagner, head of development at CBS, who gave them the green light to move forward on production. Having brought the casting director Burt Metcalfe onboard as associate producer, Gelbart and Reynolds realized that their most difficult challenge lay not in balancing creative responsibilities and individual contributions but rather in retaining the satirical spirit of both the novel and film while toning down the latter’s most explicit content: the profanity and artery-spurting surgical scenes as well as the sexual promiscuousness and fleeting glimpses of female nudity. They knew that certain iconographic staples of the motion picture, such as the public address speaker (which had linked the otherwise disconnected vignettes), would carry over into the television version. They decided that certain minor characters in the earlier versions, such as Frank Burns, would\n\nBig Ambitions for the Small Screen\n\nneed to be fleshed out more fully, and it was quickly agreed that one actor from the original film—Gary Burghoff, who played the clairvoyant and resourceful company clerk Corporal Walter “Radar” O’Reilly (so named because of his extrasensory perception)—would be hired to reprise his role for the small screen. Their first choice for the role of Captain “Hawkeye” Pierce was Alan Alda, an up-and-coming actor who had begun earning critical recognition for his work on stage and screen.1 Before M*A*S*H, Alda had performed in a number of plays on and off Broadway. Even before attending Fordham University (where he majored in English), Alan had followed his father into show business, the two of them performing Abbott and Costello routines at the Hollywood Canteen.2 At the age of sixteen, Alda segued into a semiprofessional career, appearing in summer stock with a small community theater in Barnesville, Pennsylvania. But it was only after graduating with his bachelor’s degree in 1956 and marrying Arlene Weiss the following year that Alda really began dedicating himself to acting. He developed the improvisational skills that would serve him so well in M*A*S*H while training at Paul Sill’s Second City group in New York.3 In 1960 he landed his first lead role in the Broadway production of Purlie Victorious, and three years later he made his big-screen debut in the filmed adaptation of that play, Gone Are the Days. He began guest-starring in a few episodes of such television series as The Phil Silvers Show (CBS, 1955–59), Route 66 (CBS, 1960–64), and The Nurses (CBS, 1962–65) and would achieve greater notoriety in 1964 as one of the recurring cast members in the American version of That Was the Week That Was (NBC, 1964–65), alongside David Frost, Henry Morgan, and Buck Henry. In 1968, the same year Hornberger’s MASH was published, Alda appeared in the motion picture adaptation of George Plimpton’s Paper Lion, a nonfictional account of the unathletic author’s pathetic experience of trying out for\n\n29\n\nChapter 2\n\n30\n\nAlan Alda as Captain Benjamin “Hawkeye” Pierce\n\nBig Ambitions for the Small Screen\n\nthe Detroit Lions football team. Directed by Alex March, this film is significant insofar as it provides a glimpse not only into the players’ locker-room, where normative codes of masculinity and physical prowess cast in relief Alda’s scrawniness and lankiness (at 6’2”), but also into the mindset of athletes whose sole purpose on the football field is to win—a conceit that both Hornberger and Robert Altman linked to America’s military endeavors overseas, whether in Korea or in Vietnam, toward the end of their respective works. When Alan Alda received Gelbart’s script for the pilot episode of M*A*S*H, the actor was busy working on another filmed adaptation: a made-for-TV movie titled The Glass House. Based on Truman Capote’s novel of the same title, this 1972 docudrama was shot at the Utah State Prison, where Alda’s character—a professor of political science named Jonathan Paige—has been sent after a conviction of manslaughter (which, through traumatic flashbacks, is revealed to be an accident). Although Paige is introduced to us as a “college professor” (words uttered by a corrections officer on the bus taking him to prison), he is later referred to as a “fag” by Hugo Slocum (Vic Morrow), the worst member of a gang of inmates who go out of their way to express their “manliness” in stereotypical ways, through denigrating anyone who does not fit the traditional mold of masculinity. As a brutal depiction of the violence, hardships, and corruption that run rampant in many state correctional systems, The Glass House may seem remote from the diegetic world of M*A*S*H. But this film anticipates some of the central images and main themes within the television series, from the shot of Paige working at the prison pharmacy (dressed in white lab jacket and handing out medication) to the idea that someone who has been dropped into an unfamiliar and dangerous place must rely upon his instincts and intelligence if he is to survive. Like the Korea that is depicted in M*A*S*H, the prison is a place where “sometimes it’s harder getting mail\n\n31\n\nChapter 2\n\n32\n\nthan not getting mail,” a statement Paige makes at one point to another ill-fated inmate, but that could just as likely have been uttered by the other equally clever and disconsolate character Alda played that same year: Hawkeye. After getting reassurance from Gelbart and Reynolds that their intentions were serious and that the television series would not treat the subject of war merely as an excuse for comedy, Alda signed on and began shooting twenty-four hours after production on The Glass House had wrapped. Alda inherited the role of Hawkeye from his cinematic predecessor, Donald Sutherland, and transformed the “everyman” character into a truly exceptional individual—a dedicated surgeon who likes to imitate Groucho Marx and spontaneously bursts into Broadway songs, someone who can cut through the tension of the OR with a perfectly timed zinger (often at Burns’s expense) but can just as swiftly segue into a poignant speech about the absurdity of war. With a wit as sharp as his scalpel and a preternatural ability to sniff out military snafus, he can be seen as the wisecracking, thoughtprovoking screen surrogate for Larry Gelbart, a writer known for colorful colloquialisms and creative turns of phrase that often underline paradoxes in contemporary American society. Referred to as a “crazy agnostic” by Father Mulcahy (William Christopher), Hawkeye may be skeptical of religious dogma, but he remains patient with his patients who frequently turn to God for guidance and amphetamines for pain relief.4 It is only in the company of military blowhards, whom he staunchly refuses to salute, that Alda’s character goes ballistic, antagonistically egging on his opponents in his own inimitable version of “war”—a war of words, ideas, and values instead of rockets or bullets. Hawkeye’s partner in crime, Trapper John McIntyre, is played by Wayne Rogers in the TV series. Like his tent mate, Trapper is a hard-drinking womanizer, yet he too is passionate about his job. Although Rogers eventually left the show at\n\nBig Ambitions for the Small Screen\n\nthe end of the third season (after which his skirt-chasing character was replaced by Mike Farrell’s more wholesome doctor, Captain B. J. Hunnicutt), there is in nearly every episode of M*A*S*H a strong sense of camaraderie between two men whose complex, somewhat asymmetrical relationship recalls the hero-sidekick binary in another early 1970s “buddy show,” The Odd Couple (ABC, 1970–75). Indeed, there are traces of Felix Unger (Tony Randall) and Oscar Madison (Jack Klugman) in Hawkeye and Trapper, and Alda’s character suggests a culturally sophisticated and “brainy” counterpart to Rogers’s workmanlike role as the somewhat slovenly “brawn” in the Swamp.5 The “workplace marriage” of Hawkeye and Trapper—the former linked to intellectual acuity and the latter indicative of physical strength—is thus an offshoot of that domestic sitcom produced two years earlier by Garry Marshall (who adapted Neil Simon’s stage play).6 Whereas Hornberger’s Hawkeye—like Duke Forrest, a “third wheel” who was conveniently left out of the television series—has two children and is married, the TV version of this central character is not saddled with such familial responsibilities and is thus free to engage in flirtatious relationships with nurses while forging a strong fraternal bond with Trapper (and later B.J.) that at times approaches marital status. That partnership, however, is tilted toward one side, in accordance with Alda’s increasingly active role behind the scenes as creative consultant (he eventually wrote and directed several episodes, beginning with “The Longjohn Flap” in season 1). One reason Rogers opted to leave the production after its third season was because of a contract dispute. Another reason was that so much media attention was focused on Alda, who was getting better lines and being given more to do in each successive script throughout the second and third seasons. But Alda’s centrality to M*A*S*H—while much more apparent toward the end of the series—could be detected\n\n33\n\nChapter 2\n\n34\n\nfrom day one, as evidenced by the pilot episode’s privileging of Hawkeye as an enunciative agent whose thoughts, words, perceptions, and sensibilities inform the narrative (and our interpretation of it) as no other character’s do. Hawkeye’s spoken narration ties together various elements in the pilot episode, the final draft of which Gelbart completed in September of 1971. As Jay Malarcher states, this pilot, “perhaps more than any other single episode, reflects Gelbart’s approach to the material . . . its components provid[ing] an understanding of Gelbart’s past and future techniques and strategies.”7 One of the most frequently used narrative strategies throughout the eleven-season run of M*A*S*H would be the “Dear Dad” conceit that informs this and several other episodes.8 This device hinges on an act of letter-writing, which provides the doctor an opportunity to get things off his chest, to gather his thoughts, and compose a piece of correspondence that foregrounds Hawkeye’s (and, by extension, Gelbart’s) unique phraseology while also reminding us that the home front—while invisibly offscreen— is as much a part of this series as is the battlefront.9 The fact that this epistolary staple of the series was in place from the very beginning not only indicates just how consistent and cohesive M*A*S*H was throughout the 1970s (despite the major cast changes and character modifications) but also underlines the primacy of the storytelling act, as rendered by Hawkeye, the governing sensibility of the series. Like its cinematic predecessor, the TV series, which began filming during the last weeks of 1971, was shot partially at the Fox Ranch (while interiors were filmed on Stage 9 of the Fox studios in Beverly Hills)—about as far away as one could get from Korea. Unlike the film, however, the show deals with the war in an intimate and humane way, albeit often by belittling or infantilizing the Korean populace. This is especially true of the pilot episode, which portrays Ho-jon as a poor houseboy in need of American protection and guid-\n\nBig Ambitions for the Small Screen\n\nance. Ultimately, the television series would evince a more complex understanding of the Korean War and a more respectful treatment of the local people than does Altman’s film. It would focus neither on the military elite nor on the GIs in the trenches, although these figures often appeared. Instead, the men and women of Mobile Army Surgical Hospital 4077 take precedence, their day-to-day trials, tribulations, and tricks on one another presented like a never-ending string of plays in the Theatre of the Absurd. In addition to these dedicated surgeons and nurses are the many wounded soldiers and villagers who arrive by ambulance, jeep, bus, or—in the show’s most famous image—helicopter, only to be patched up and sent back into the action (or put in harm’s way, in the case of the locals). That iconographic medivac helicopter appears at the beginning of every M*A*S*H episode, save for this pilot, the first shot of which is an extreme close-up of a golf tee planted in the ground. A hand descends from the top of the frame and places a golf ball on the tee. An iron then enters from the left side of the frame before the camera pulls back to reveal—in medium-long shot—Trapper John swinging the club while Hawkeye and Ho-jon watch nearby. At this point, an odd caption overlays the image: “Korea, 1950, a hundred years ago.” These exterior shots are suddenly juxtaposed with an interior scene. In medium close-up, Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson) and a nurse in medical cap and gown appear to be operating on someone or something just below the frame. The next shot shows a dozing Father Mulcahy (played here for the first and only time by George Morgan), who mechanically crosses himself in sleep as an army truck passes before him. From there, the scene cuts to a shot/reverse-shot of Margaret Houlihan (Loretta Swit) and Frank Burns (Larry Linville) sitting opposite one another at a table, each silently reading passages of the Bible with intense interest. The camera zooms in to expose, just under the table, Margaret’s bare\n\n35\n\nChapter 2\n\n36 Putting us in place: the first image in the pilot episode\n\nfeet caressing those of Frank, the first of many flirtatious moments in the series that discredit their apparent religious fervor. The next shot shows “Spearchucker” Jones (Timothy Brown) playing football with Radar O’Reilly and another enlisted man. A shot of Henry and the nurse in midoperation reveals their “patient” to be a champagne bottle, not a person, and they burst into smiles when it finally uncorks. We then see Trapper John hitting another golf ball, which lands in an adjacent minefield and triggers an explosion. Dramatically, the shot cuts to an image of Radar catching the football and turning on his feet 180 degrees, toward the camera. Sensing something in the air, he declares, “Here they come!” Then, from over Radar’s shoulder, we see two MASH choppers emerging above the mountains, accompanied by the melodic strains of Johnny Mandel’s lilting theme music, “Suicide is\n\nBig Ambitions for the Small Screen\n\n37 Looking back at the past from the future: time out of joint in the pilot episode\n\nPainless” (minus the lyrics, which can be heard in the film version).10 The first two-and-a-half minutes of the pilot episode—a brief, quotidian interlude that leads to an extended version of the now-famous title sequence—encapsulate the thematic and generic contradictions and tensions within the diegetic universe of M*A*S*H. Almost every visual element in this pre-credit montage is incongruous, duplicitous, or hybridized. Hawkeye and Trapper are decked out in mismatching flower-print Hawaiian shirts and army green pants. Their golf caddy is the Korean houseboy Ho-jon (played by the Filipino-American actor Patrick Adiarte), and the PA system broadcasts an American song (“My Blue Heaven”) but sung in Japanese. Their makeshift “golf course” is simply a rugged hill lined with tents. In place of sand traps is a real hazard: a\n\nChapter 2\n\n38\n\nminefield. Apparently scrubbed and dressed for surgery in the OR, Henry and his female companion are not struggling to save a dying patient but rather trying to open a bottle of booze. Margaret and Frank use the pretext of Bible study for an adulterous rendezvous. Father Mulcahy blindly gives out his blessing without actually seeing the object of his consecration. All these events are supposedly happening in Korea in 1950, “a hundred years ago.” Given that CBS first broadcast this pilot episode on September 17, 1972 (some twentytwo years after the outbreak of the war), viewers were confronted with the possibility that what they were about to see existed in the realm of fantasy and should not be taken as history. In fact, even today, audiences who watch this first M*A*S*H episode are seeing things from the imaginary vantage point of someone from the future. The lethargic yet humorous tone of the pre-credits sequence quickly shifts when Radar spots the choppers and the invisible PA announcer summons the medical personnel to report immediately to the operating room. A group of nurses springs into action, dashing from the women’s quarters out into the mud. A wet, half-naked man emerges from the shower tent and rushes to answer the call. Another woman hurriedly exits a tent while adjusting her clothing; she is followed by her male partner, who walks away in a different direction, passing a sign that reads “off limits to male personnel.” Various leisure and recuperative activities—sports, sex, showering, drinking—all come to an abrupt halt as dedicated medical professionals are called to their duties. We see Hawkeye and Trapper examine wounded soldiers landing from helicopters and give instructions to the support staff. An inserted close-up of Hawkeye’s concerned face accentuates the hero’s compassionate, caring personality, distinguishing him from his more devil-may-care, cynical predecessors in the original novel and the filmed adaptation. Immediately following the opening credits, we see Hawk-\n\nDear Dad,\n\nYou said I sounded a bit callous about my job here in my last letter. Well, let me see if I can put it another way. At this particular mobile army hospital, we are not concerned with the ultimate reconstruction of the patient. We only care about getting the kid out of here alive enough for someone else to put on the fine touches. We work fast and we’re not dainty because a lot of these kids who can stand two hours on the table just can’t stand one second more. We try to play par surgery on this course. Par is a live patient. This voiceover, which tellingly concludes with a metaphorical reference to golf, centers the male protagonist and immediately forms an emotional bond between him and the viewers. We are privy to his inner thoughts and positioned to lend a sympathetic ear to his plight and frustrations (as his father, a lobster fisherman back home in Crabapple Cove, would no doubt do). Our medical hero further vocalizes his discontent to Frank when the latter blames him for conduct unbecoming of an officer during the operation: “Frank, I happen to be an officer only because I foolishly opened an invitation from President Truman to come to this costume party. . . . We’ve all had twelve straight hours of meatball surgery in there! My brain is sending me urgent rest telegrams.” However, in the same episode, Hawkeye also experiences a sense of joy and satisfaction when he receives a letter from Dean Lodge, the head of Androscoggin College, informing him that Ho-jon has been accepted to his alma mater. To raise the two thousand dollars needed for the Korean houseboy’s tuition and travel expenses, Hawkeye throws an “all-you-can-drink-for$10” raffle party, offering weekend passes for two to Tokyo as\n\nBig Ambitions for the Small Screen\n\neye in the OR and hear him reciting a letter to his father:\n\n39\n\nChapter 2\n\n40\n\na prize. Radar acquires the passes illegally, hoodwinking Blake into signing them and telling the CO that they are order forms for fudge ripple ice cream. Meanwhile, Hawkeye sweettalks Lieutenant Maggie Dish (Karen Phillip), an engaged woman whom he has been romancing for weeks, into offering herself as a prize companion for the raffle winner. He also sedates Frank, who has taken temporary command of the unit in Blake’s absence, so as to get the meddlesome buffoon out of the way. The party proves to be a success: over $1,800 is raised and Father Mulcahy—the “resident celibate”—is named the winner because Hawkeye has manipulated the raffle to bail out Lt. Dish.11 Margaret discovers what has happened to Frank and reports the incident to General Hammond (George Wood), one of her old flames, currently stationed in Seoul. Accompanied by Blake, Hammond quickly descends on the camp, is saluted by Radar (who is wearing a bedpan on his head), breaks up the party, and threatens to court-martial both Hawkeye and Trapper. On cue, incoming wounded Canadian soldiers bring the shindig to a halt and everyone— including Hammond—works together in the OR. Impressed by the two gifted surgeons’ knack for stitching up soldiers, the general eventually retracts his order for their arrest. The episode ends with the “meatball surgeons” complaining about their Catch-22 situation, emphasized when Hawkeye says, “We gotta give up this preoccupation with keeping people alive, or we’ll never get outta here. Maybe we should start using rusty instruments.” Trapper offers another idea: “Stop washing our hands,” to which Hawkeye adds, “Raise our prices!” Following this is a self-reflexive end-credits sequence accompanied by a roll call of the main cast members, spoken by the disembodied male voice of the camp’s PA system—something earlier utilized by Altman at the end of his film.\n\nBig Ambitions for the Small Screen\n\nSignificantly, this pilot episode reveals a misogynistic streak in the otherwise likeable chief surgeon, who will gradually develop into a more mature and politically conscious character in later seasons of the series, someone who will come to perceive women as well as racial minorities (a group constituting the majority in Korea) in an altogether different light. Here, though, Hawkeye rudely addresses Margaret in the OR (who has inquired if everything is okay while wiping sweat from his forehead), telling her, “Yeah, fine. But if you don’t move, I’m gonna have to cut around your ‘B’ cups.” When Frank protests against this “unbecoming conduct” after the operation, Hawkeye casually says, “Sorry, baby” to Margaret, who then pulls rank on him and insists “Major to you.” His sarcastic reply to the outranking female officer: “Sorry, major baby.” Additional hints of Hawkeye’s misogyny manifest in his relationship with Lt. Dish, the woman whom he is using as bait in his altruistic raffle. Dish was a creation of Lardner Jr., not Gelbart, and was transported into the television series from Altman’s film, where she was little more than an appropriately named object of desire, coerced into sleeping with “Painless” Pole so as to therapeutically remedy his sexual impotency. Not surprisingly, it was this plotline, along with Hot Lips’s/Kellerman’s humiliation in the film’s famous shower scene, that outraged many feminist critics. Ellen Willis, a Village Voice columnist, wrote a letter to the New York Times denouncing the “blatant misogyny” of Altman’s M*A*S*H. Another critic, Sandra Shevey, argued in the same newspaper that the film “obscenely degrades women.” Defending his film against these and other feminist accusations, Altman (who never commented on the real-life episode involving an 8076th shower tent that apparently inspired this scene) replied, “This is the way [women] were treated back then (in the 1950s).”12\n\n41\n\nChapter 2\n\n42\n\nThe TV pilot thus dilutes the earlier work’s misogyny to a degree, emphasizing that a noble cause (sending a poor Korean boy to college in the United States) is behind Hawkeye’s (mis)use of the nurse. As stated earlier, in Hornberger’s novel, Hawkeye raises $6,500 for Ho-jon by selling pictures of Trapper John posing as Jesus rather than by compromising a woman’s virtue. By the end of the pilot episode, however, Hawkeye has managed to both generate the necessary money and prevent Lt. Dish from fulfilling her sexual obligation by secretly instructing the nurse to pick Father Mulcahy’s ticket, which has been taped to the bottom of the raffle bowl. The outcome is a surprise even to Lt. Dish, who had earlier anticipated that Hawkeye would doctor the raffle so as to have a shot at her. Despite this gentlemanly gesture, though, Hawkeye doesn’t think twice about raffling off the woman he has been romantically pursuing and utters insensitive phrases such as “Hot Lips” and “the completely edible Lieutenant Dish.”\n\nChapter 3\n\nEnsemble TV\n\nA\n\ns stated in the previous chapter, the pilot episode of M*A*S*H aired on September 17, 1972, in the midst of several industrial changes and government rulings designed to bring greater programming diversity to television (these include the Prime-Time Access Rule implemented in 1971 and the FCC-imposed fin-syn rules established the year before, which prevented the big three networks from integrating vertically). When the series premiered, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) had already announced plans to create a separate company for syndication distribution (Viacom), had just shut down its own short-lived film production unit (Cinema Center Films), and had witnessed the retirement of its illustrious radio talk-show host Arthur Godfrey. Its attention now steadfastly focused on television, CBS was experimenting with its schedule and experiencing an upswing in Nielsen ratings, having one year earlier debuted what would become the number one show in America, All in the Family (1971–79). This Norman Lear production differs from M*A*S*H in many ways, most glaringly in that it was a taped recording of a performance in front of an instudio audience as opposed to a filmed recording of actors on\n\n43\n\nChapter 3\n\n44\n\nlocation or at least partially outside studio walls. Indeed, for all of its groundbreaking use of topical humor in transforming the domestic sitcom into a kind of cultural laboratory for testing socially relevant material (racism, bigotry, sexism, patriarchy, and so forth), All in the Family—like two other Lear programs, Maude (CBS, 1972–78) and Sanford and Son (NBC, 1972–77)—harkens back to earlier examples of live television comedy from the 1950s because of the immediacy and claustrophobia of its soundstage-bound setting. Although not nearly as “cinematic” as Altman’s film, the TV series M*A*S*H gave such directors as Hy Averback, Jackie Cooper, Charles Dubin, William Jurgensen, Don Weis, and William Wiard, as well as the screenwriters Larry Balmagia, Jay Folb, Ronny Graham, David Issacs, Allan Katz, Ken Levine, Larry Marks, and Don Reo (among others) the opportunity to incorporate stylistic flourishes and narrative experimentation into several episodes, from fairly elaborate tracking and dolly shots to a ticking clock that counted down, in real time, the minutes needed to perform surgery on a dying soldier (in “Life Time,” from season 8). These kinds of techniques and innovations were relatively uncommon during the 1970s (especially so when M*A*S*H premiered in the fall of 1972) and are indicative of CBS executives’ willingness to take chances on unconventional formats and controversial subject matter. Although Gelbart claims that he and the other scriptwriters were initially uncertain about the direction the series would take during its first season, noticeable motifs were already beginning to rise to the surface in the first half-dozen episodes, which rely on the following formula: “Hawkeye and Trapper [get] into big trouble (usually followed by a visit from a general),” only to be “exonerated after displaying their vitally necessary talents in the operating room.”1 Spun around this standard narrative setup and resolution are a number of incidental details related to camp life, not to men-\n\nEnsemble TV\n\ntion several intricately woven narrative threads that suggest a willingness on the part of Gelbart, Metcalfe, and Reynolds to retain Altman’s discursive, multidirectional approach to plotting. Indeed, much like the ensemble film, the television series is, in Thomas Schatz’s words, “remarkably ‘democratic’ in its treatment of the eight principal characters,” many of whom either take center stage or contribute to the thematic parallelism in subsequent episodes throughout the first season.2 Constantly out of uniform and clad in a fishing vest and cap, the TV version of Colonel Henry Blake is presented as a more bumbling, less sober version of the film’s camp commander, someone whose proclivity to drink and eagerness to have sex with various women position him as a decidedly non-Army type sympathetic to Hawkeye and Trapper’s shenanigans as well as their dislike of Major Frank Burns. Likewise a character retained from both the novel and the film, Burns hails from Fort Wayne, Indiana, and is immediately coded as a jingoistic, xenophobic, anal-retentive, obnoxious, and incompetent doctor, someone who will be repeatedly lampooned by Hawkeye and Trapper for his hypocrisy, pettiness, and pro-military stance. As in the film, the TV version of Burns cheats on his wife with Margaret “Hot Lips” Houlihan, the head nurse at the 4077. Margaret is initially ridiculed because of her steadfast dedication to her military career as well as her romantic association with Burns. Over time, though, she is begrudgingly accepted into Hawkeye and Trapper’s exclusive circle, becoming “one of the guys” while at the same time embodying the traits of a strong, independent, career-minded woman. Each of these characters adds harmonic resonance and texture to the situation-based humor of the first season, which foregrounds the constant oscillation between phenomenological extremes that would distinguish M*A*S*H from all other series on network television during the 1972–73\n\n45\n\nChapter 3\n\n46\n\nseason. In addition to balancing high and low forms of comedy with an emphasis on both verbal and physical humor, M*A*S*H maintains a delicate tonal equilibrium, taking the spectator from the mess tent to the operating room in the blink of an eye. The proximity of these and other radically different spaces marks the show as a workplace comedy quite unlike other famous examples of the genre, such as The Dick Van Dyke Show (CBS, 1961–66) and the contemporaneous hit The Mary Tyler Moore Show (CBS, 1970–77), both of which depict “co-workers as a loosely knit but crucially interdependent quasi-family within a ‘domesticated’ workplace.”3 Whereas these latter programs maintain a physical separation between the workplace that is home to a surrogate family of coworkers and the domestic arena that is home to actual relatives, M*A*S*H literally mashes together these spaces of social interaction so as create greater tension as well as a stronger sense of community in the face of calamity.4 With sleeping quarters situated next to public showers, with the mess tent doubling as a place of worship,5 with the OR itself only a short walk from the Officer’s Club (which is later renamed the “Henry Blake Memorial Bar” in recognition of his endearing dipsomania), a certain promiscuous blending of genres and genders can be expected, something apparent in the many interactions between so-called soft personnel and the horny doctors who pursue them. Hence the series’ focus on sexual flings between the men and women of the 4077, who share their innermost feelings (among other things) in close quarters and come to rely on one another much like actual family members. Another sign of the blending that results from this spatial collapse or physical proximity is the character of Corporal Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr), a cigar-chomping, cross-dressing heterosexual who dons women’s clothing in hopes of evading military service and getting a Section Eight from the Army. Nicknamed “Corporal Crazy” because of his desperate,\n\nEnsemble TV\n\nunflagging bid for a mental instability discharge (he even goes so far as to subject his body to physical harm, whether by trying to eat an entire jeep, bit by bit, or by pouring gasoline on himself and threatening to strike a match), Klinger may in fact be the sanest member of the unit, a paradox that fans of Joseph Heller’s aforementioned Catch-22 will certainly grasp given that novel’s focus on the many failed attempts by a bomber pilot named Yossarian to avoid dangerous missions by maintaining that he is insane.6 Like Heller’s archetypal World War II antihero, whose claim of insanity does not relieve him from active duty (for what could be saner than wanting to avoid dangerous missions?), Klinger is faced with a seemingly unsolvable dilemma, one that he comically comments on throughout the series: How does one get out of Korea? This lingering conundrum applies not only to Klinger but also to Margaret, Hawkeye, and the only other character to appear in M*A*S*H from its first season to its last, Father Francis J. Mulcahy (William Christopher). Likewise similar to a character in Catch-22 (Chaplain A. T. Tappman, played in the 1970 film by Anthony Perkins, who at one point is referred to as “Padre”), the 4077’s quirky man of God watches benevolently over his flock of fellow medicos, seeking solace in the Lord and through restorative letters to his sister, a nun named Kathy (who has adopted the moniker Sister Angelica). Unlike Father Mulcahy and some of the other people appearing throughout M*A*S*H ’s first season (including Timothy Brown’s “Spearchucker” Jones and John Orchard’s “Ugly” John), the character of Klinger was created by Gelbart and is thus not found in either the novel or the film.7 Debuting in the fourth episode (“Chief Surgeon Who?”), Klinger would soon be joined by other recurring characters written exclusively for the TV series, such as the paranoid CIA operative Colonel Flagg (Edgar Winter), the army psychiatrist Sidney Freedman (Allan Arbus), the dim-witted Private Igor Straminsky (Jeff Maxwell), the supply sergeant Zelmo Zale\n\n47\n\nChapter 3\n\n48\n\n(Johnny Haymer), and the always dependable half-Hawaiian, half-Chinese nurse Kellye (Kellye Nakahara).8 As stated earlier, the lone holdover from the film was Gary Burghoff, who reprised his role as “Radar” O’Reilly for the first eight seasons of the television series (until the two-part episode “Goodbye, Radar”). Throughout those years, especially during Colonel Blake’s tenure as commanding officer, the eighteen-year-old clairvoyant is an instrumental if mischievous figure in the series—someone who oversees the day-to-day running of the 4077 in his capacity as company clerk yet frequently betrays his innocent, adolescent side while talking to his Teddy Bear, reading Archie comics, or downing shots of Grape Nehi at Rosie’s Bar. The hirsute Klinger, a more mature if less responsible character, would eventually take over Radar’s post once Burghoff left M*A*S*H. Burghoff was one of four original cast members who departed the series. The other actors to leave—McLean Stevenson, Wayne Rogers, and Larry Linville—were replaced by less acerbic, more likeable performers: Harry Morgan, Mike Farrell, and David Ogden Stiers. Morgan, who had earlier appeared as Major General Steele in the season 3 opener, “The General Flipped at Dawn,” was cast as Colonel Sherman T. Potter after Stevenson had decided to exit the series. Stevenson’s last appearance as the laid-back Colonel Henry Blake, commanding officer of the 4077, was in the season 3 episode, “Abyssinia, Henry.” Written by Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum and originally broadcast on March 18, 1975, this famous episode shocked audiences with the death of Blake, a major character whose tour of duty in Korea had ended (he had accrued enough “points” to go home). It was not, however, the first time that a sympathetic character was killed off in M*A*S*H: in season 1, “Sometimes You Hear the Bullet” shows Hawkeye reduced to tears when his childhood friend Tommy Gillis (James Callahan), an author who is writing a firsthand account of infantry life in Korea, perishes as a re-\n\nEnsemble TV\n\n49 Corporal “Radar” O'Reilly mourns the loss of Colonel Blake in “Abyssinia, Henry”\n\nsult of gunfire. Still, as moving as this and a handful of other episodes in the first three seasons are, none approach “Abyssinia, Henry” in terms of its unprecedented readiness to kill off a major character for dramatic purposes and emotional effect. In the closing seconds of this episode, Radar trudges into the operating room holding a telegram and—in one of the most moving and dramatic scenes in the history of M*A*S*H—informs everyone that their former CO’s homeward bound plane has been shot down over the Sea of Japan. The resulting shock and silence in the OR, broken only by the sharp sound of a scalpel hitting the ground, is rendered as a kind a documentary moment, captured by the camera as it pans across the room and scans the dazed faces of the ac-\n\nChapter 3\n\n50\n\ntors (who were not told about this tragic twist in advance). Besides giving the actor (who was developing The McLean Stevenson Show for NBC) a somewhat inglorious sendoff, the show generated a spate of outraged fan mail from viewers who had grown to love the affable yet ineffectual character and felt betrayed by the producers. In the wake of Blake’s death, Gelbart, Reynolds, and Metcalfe made significant alterations to the show’s formula with the addition of the sixtytwo-year-old Colonel Potter, a stern and disciplined yet affectionate taskmaster (not to mention a lover of all things equine) who would eventually become a father figure to many of the younger staff members, particularly Margaret, a character undergoing significant changes around that time. Another major alteration for the show occurred when Farrell’s Captain B. J. Hunnicutt was brought onboard following Wayne Rogers’s departure. As Trapper’s replacement, the twenty-eight-year-old Hunnicutt, a Stanford graduate, quickly becomes a more wholesome companion to Hawkeye upon his arrival in the season 4 opener, “Welcome to Korea.” This change of personnel is thus a change in personality, something subtly connoted by the new character’s last name. Whereas Trapper had been a somewhat burly surgeon whose preoccupations included snaring women, Hunnicutt is sweeter, a “cutter” who is like honey compared to his predecessor.9 A devoted husband and loving father, he embodies a certain set of clearly articulated moral principles from which he rarely deviates. Except for a moment of weakness in “Hanky Panky” (season 5), he remains faithful to his wife throughout his tour of duty. And yet, despite this apparent staunchness on B.J.’s part, he is prone to drink as frequently as Hawkeye and shares with his free-wheeling tent mate a distaste for military regimentation and interoffice bureaucracy, something illustrated in his very first episode. In the Emmy-winning two-parter “Welcome to Korea,” set during September 1952, B.J. gets physically ill after wit-\n\nEnsemble TV\n\nnessing a soldier’s death. However, this inexperienced member of the 4077 quickly learns not only how to cope with his new situation but also how to fit in and gain Hawkeye’s respect, first by bellying up to an officer’s bar in Kimpo, then by stealing a general’s jeep (a throwback to Altman’s film), and then, while drunk, by calling Frank—the temporary CO who represents the military mindset at its most corrupt—“ferret face.” Nevertheless, the introduction of Hunnicutt as well as the equally monogamous and trustworthy Potter—coming only a few months after Richard Nixon’s forced resignation from the presidency on August 9, 1974—signaled the beginning of a transition in the show’s treatment of both masculinity and femininity, not to mention a desire in American culture at large to put the nation’s inglorious past behind it. Also, as comparatively more straight-laced characters than their hell-raising predecessors, Hunnicutt and Potter personify a populist shift away from the darker themes and satiric bite of the show’s first three seasons. The third significant alteration that was made before Radar’s departure occurred at the beginning of season 6, in the hour-long episode “Fade Out, Fade In,” when Major Charles Emerson Winchester III was ushered in as another comic foil for Hawkeye and B.J. to contend with (in the absence of Burns, who went AWOL after the fifth season, which culminated in Margaret’s marriage to Lieutenant Colonel Donald Penobscott). Unlike his more irritating predecessor, David Ogden Stiers’s Winchester has been drafted into army service. He is also an accomplished and intelligent surgeon who, over time, grows into a sympathetic figure despite his air of superiority, egotism, and elitism, not to mention his outright bigotry and racism (apparent in such episodes as “Bottle Fatigue,” when he objects to his sister’s engagement to a “swarthy” Italian; and “Twas the Day after Christmas,” when he refers to Klinger, a Lebanese American, as a member of a “lower species”).10\n\n51\n\nChapter 3\n\n52\n\nHaving grown up in an affluent Presbyterian neighborhood in Boston (Beacon Hill) and graduated number one in his medical class at Harvard, this New England blueblood embodies the establishment, but in a way that differs from the show’s satirical representations of military officials and governmental liaisons. Winchester is the picture of a “cultured” man in the stereotypical sense of the word, an oenophile and a master of bridge so accustomed to sleeping on silk sheets and listening to the orchestral music of Wagner and Mussorgsky (which he prefers to brassy military marches) that he is forced to import these luxuries into Korea. Still, while he may have the hardened emotional shell of a Boston Brahmin, those layers of haughty disdain for the unfortunates below him begin to crack over time, emitting glints of generosity and revealing hints of a more humanitarian side of the character, a development that would have been unthinkable during Frank Burns’s tenure. This comes to the fore in a handful of episodes, including “Death Takes a Holiday,” a season 9 tearjerker (written and directed by Mike Farrell) in which Charles—upholding a Winchester family tradition—transcends his Scrooge-like persona by anonymously sending candy bars to a nearby orphanage at Christmas. An episode from the final season, “Run for the Money,” likewise reveals a sympathetic, melancholic side to the snob, showing Winchester trying to boost the spirits and self-esteem of a soldier who stutters (a speech disorder that Charles’s sister, Honoria, also suffers from). He does so by encouraging Private Palmer (Phil Brock) to kick his comic book addiction and try reading great literature (like Melville’s Moby Dick) for a change— something that many great stutterers throughout history, including Winston Churchill, did.\n\nEnsemble TV\n\n53 Major Charles Winchester III and Choi Sung-ho (played by Chinese-American actor Keye Luke) in “Death Takes a Holiday”\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 4\n\nMobility as Metaphor\n\nB\n\ny the end of its first season, when it had been shown opposite such long-running Sunday night programs as The Wonderful World of Disney (a.k.a. Disneyland, NBC, 1955–90) and The FBI (ABC, 1965–74), M*A*S*H ranked forty-sixth in the Nielsen ratings. Although not an immediate success, the CBS series dodged cancellation after its first dismal season and managed to become a hit from its second season onward, thanks primarily to a shuffling of the network’s schedule (it was moved to a powerhouse Saturday evening slot between All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show). Even after its third-season move to Tuesday nights, M*A*S*H continued to draw large audiences. Larry Gelbart left the production at the end of the fourth season (1975–76), after having written what is generally considered to be the best episode in the program’s history, “The Interview” (a black-and-white mock documentary that I discuss in chapter 7). Gene Reynolds followed suit a year later, so as to devote time to Lou Grant (CBS, 1977–82), a spin-off of the MTM Productions flagship series The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Although he stayed on as a creative consultant throughout the remaining seasons of M*A*S*H, Reynolds was replaced\n\n55\n\nChapter 4\n\n56\n\nby Burt Metcalfe, who took over as executive producer during this transitional period. Besides producing the series from the sixth season onward, Metcalfe also directed over twodozen episodes, three of which (“Bottle Fatigue,” “No Laughing Matter,” and “Picture This”) would be nominated for Emmy Awards. Although his contributions to the show have sometimes been ignored in favor of his more famous partners, Metcalfe was the only scriptwriter and producer to work throughout the entire run of the series.1 As its fifth season (1976–77) was drawing to a close, M*A*S*H was among the most watched American television shows, landing in the top ten Nielsen-rated programs each year thereafter until the very end.2 Throughout these later years, when CBS made one final scheduling adjustment (moving M*A*S*H from Tuesday to Monday nights at 9:00 p.m., beginning with the episode “The Smell of Music”), the series weathered writers’ strikes (during its ninth season) and key personnel changes behind the scenes. Still, the show’s core group of writers remained at the top of its form, building elaborate scaffolding for the rich linguistic tapestries that were being so effortlessly woven by Alda and the rest of the cast each week. However, the protagonists’ innuendo-sprinkled banter was also laced with sanctimonious, self-righteous platitudes about the senselessness of war. This, plus the show’s gradual abandonment of overtly antiauthoritarian themes, became the focus of critics who lamented its apparent drop in quality and its retreat to more conservative—or at least populist—sociopolitical territory. Indeed, in the season 11 episode “Bombshells,” a guiltridden B.J. utters a statement epitomizing the shift in tone and sentiment that distinguishes the show’s final two seasons from its first two. After enemy gunfire forces him to abandon an injured soldier in the field, B.J. returns to the Swamp in a disconsolate state and tells Hawkeye, “We sit around here in our Hawaiian shirts and red suspenders, thumbing our nose\n\nMobility as Metaphor\n\nat the army, drinking home-brewed gin and flaunting authority at every turn and feeling oh-so-superior to those military fools who kill each other and oh-so-self-righteous when we clean up after them. Well, good luck to you, pal. I hope you can keep it up.” By the time this episode aired on November 28, 1982, M*A*S*H had already witnessed a noticeable shift in producer Metcalfe’s priorities. While each of the show’s main characters had developed into a complex individual whose personal conflicts proved more timeless than those witnessed in the more topical sitcom All in the Family, one could not help but detect significant season-to-season changes, which in hindsight clearly reflect political, social, and institutional transformations in the United States. In one of the show’s many epistolary narratives, “Dear Sis” (from season 7), Father Mulcahy writes in closing to his sister Kathy, “You know, sis, it doesn’t matter whether you feel useful or not when you’re moving from one disaster to another. The trick, I guess, is just to keep moving.” This comment, which leads to a rare freeze-frame that caps the episode with an image of combined movement and stasis, is meant to denote the chaplain’s change of heart: he has cathartically overcome his feelings of guilt (after punching an injured soldier) and worthlessness (as a spiritual guide rather than a physical healer) during the camp’s Christmas celebration. However, one could just as easily read Mulcahy’s allusion to movement as a reference to the idea that recurring characters in long-running television programs inevitably undergo changes of some sort. This was especially true of M*A*S*H, which indeed went through significant alterations over the course of several years, humanizing Houlihan, heteronormativizing Klinger, and heroicizing Hawkeye’s newfound ability (or willingness) to treat women with respect. The show’s many diegetic modifications (which reflect shifts in societal attitudes as well as changes in America’s political climate), not to mention the extradiegetic flux involved\n\n57\n\nChapter 4\n\n58\n\nin the hiring of new actors, are in contrast to the characters’ inability to escape war-torn Korea. Hence the paradox of having characters who are both immobile (confined to the same setting, except in those rare “bug outs” brought about by heavy enemy fire) and mobile (shifting allegiances, personalities, and behavioral patterns as part of a maturation process). Set against the same nondescript backdrop of mountains week-to-week and featuring a seemingly endless litany of incoming wounded in addition to the show’s familiar faces, M"
