        "text": "Social media fans have highlighted Princess Kate's apparent nervousness during her first major royal interview in 2010 after footage from her joint news appearance with Prince William marking their engagement resurfaced on TikTok.\n\nWilliam and Kate met at college in 2001 and began dating soon after, becoming a public couple in 2004. They married in 2011 and this year celebrated their 13th wedding anniversary on April 29, marking the occasion with the release of a never before seen photo from their big day.\n\nKate has become the subject of increased focus this year after she took a step out of the public eye while experiencing health challenges. In March, the princess announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing a course of preventative chemotherapy.\n\nIn the absence of regular new appearances while she continues her treatment and recovery, royal fans have taken to social media to reflect on major milestones from her royal career.\n\nUploaded to TikTok by user luciessecretwife, footage from Kate's first on-camera interview has reached over 140,000 views, including her nervous response to a question about how she saw her future role within the monarchy.\n\nWilliam and Kate announced their engagement on November 16, 2010, after the prince popped the question during a vacation in Kenya. The couple's announcement was marked with a photo call at St James's Palace and a sit-down news interview with a British broadcaster.\n\nThough Kate had been William's public girlfriend for nearly a decade, she had never done a formal interview before, with fans quick to notice her nerves.\n\n\"It is obviously nerve-racking because I don't know the ropes really,\" she said about life as a working member of the royal family.\n\n\"William is obviously used to it but no, I'm willing to learn quickly and work hard.\"\n\nAt this point, William placed his hand on his future wife's knee, telling the interviewer: \"She'll do really well.\"\n\nThe TikTok post also includes footage from Kate's senior public engagements as a working royal, most prominently her appearance at the coronation of King Charles III in May 2023.\n\nWhen Charles became king, one of his first acts was to create William and Kate as the new Prince and Princess of Wales. These are the most senior titles held by royal family members outside of those held by Charles and Queen Camilla.\n\nCaptioned \"She's perfect in this role,\" the video has received in excess of 16,000 likes and over 150 comments, many of which have praised Kate and her royal service.\n\n\"The nerves ðŸ˜­,\" wrote one TikTok user. \"She's gone through her royal transformation. She's so great. Big love for Kate.\"\n\n\"She is perfect , elegant , classy , beautiful and has NEVER put a foot wrong , she is the most amazing Queen in waiting,\" posted another, with a further comment reading: \"I like her honesty. She acknowledges her limitations and willingness to learn. She is definitely doing well and we are proud of her. ðŸ¥°.\"\n\nIn June, Kate provided her first major health update since her cancer announcement. She said that while still receiving treatment and not yet \"out of the woods,\" she hoped now to be able to begin working from home and making some public appearances over the summer.\n\nSo far, the princess attended the Trooping the Colour celebrations in June and the Wimbledon men's tennis final in July.\n\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London.
