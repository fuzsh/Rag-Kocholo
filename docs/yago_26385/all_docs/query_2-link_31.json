        "text": "April 15, 2018\n\nA comprehensive military history of chemical weapons from their root in WWI through 2006, War of Nerves does a fantastic job of illustrating how organizational imperatives and domestic politics play just as strong of role in weapon development programs as does defined military need or strategic imperatives. Tucker is by no means polemical, but he does convey that the meta-argument over deterrence often had little connection at best to military requirements, preparedness, and technical constraints.\n\nHowever, he also illustrates how close several states were to CW deployment as part of a broad conventional campaign, most strikingly Nazi Germany in 1945, combatant Arab states during the 1973 war with Israel, and Iraq in 1991. Tucker argues that in each case awareness of asymmetrical capabilities (especially inability to protect their own populations from retaliation) prevented otherwise logical CW use for military purposes. If you accept that argument (which Tucker does not flesh out with much sourcing or research of his own) then he does an insufficient job of pivoting in the last chapter in support of the CWC and the existence of norms as the best tool to prevent future CW use. I’m not taking a position on either side, but rather noting Tucker’s meticulous evidence itself undermines what appear in the last chapter to be his policy preferences.\n\nThis is a highly relevant book to frame the pervasive use of chemical weapons in Syria today as the international community stands by, unable or unwilling to enforce the norm. It is reminiscent of the Italian use of CW against Abyssinia as the League of Nations wrung its hands, a historical analogy that should deeply worry anyone concerned over the stability of today’s international system.\n\nSeptember 14, 2020\n\nThis book provides an overview on the history of chemical weapons development and use.\n\nThe book is initially more focused on the development of chemical weapons and their chemistry - though not to a great detail -, and the more contemporary uses of chemical weapons are analysed mostly from a political perspective. In the end, there is an interesting epilogue dealing with the elimination of chemical weapons.\n\nI would recommend reading this book immediately after or before reading \"Toxic\" by Dan Kaszeta. Many of the topics are repeated, but I actually found that advnatageous because it increases retention of information.\n\nAugust 12, 2011\n\nIf you've branched Chem Corps in the military -- its an Ok read. I think it focuses a little bit too much on the R&D and then the demilitarization side, and not so much on the \"what were chemical soldiers doing at the time\" side, but its still a good history lesson. Probably really boring to anybody else.\n\nApril 6, 2018\n\nThis book provides a good comprehensive overview of the development and use of chemical weapons staring with World War One. For anyone that studies weapons of mass destruction this book is a must have.\n\nJune 11, 2024\n\nFantastic literature discussing the origins of chemical warfare to the early 2000's. Very indepth and gives you the foundation for his subject!\n\nJuly 22, 2016\n\nAn excellent top-down telling of chemical weapon warfare from 1914 to 2007. Easy to read, extremely compelling, and smart enough to let the reader decide, this was a non fiction book i could power through without getting too mentally exhausted. There is some chemistry, but you arent required to have prior knowledge. Chemical weaponry has an interesting history in that its been partially decommissioned - far further in arms reduction than nuclear.\n\nSome parts of the title are covered in much more detail to than others, and while i can understand certain events have less to write about, I would have preferred a wider scope.\n\nHe focuses only on the main weapons specifically developed to militarize for the purposes of killing . Agent Orange and environmental chemicals are only briefly mentioned - I felt the author minimized the destructiveness of agent orange in the way he presented. Police agents such as tear gas or incapacitating gasses are not mentioned. Frustatingly, Tucker retells an incident of how Russian military pumped narcotic gasses to end a hostage situation - without going into more detail about that wider class of substances.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the part about the Japanese Cult gas attacks, as well as world war II.\n\nI think theres a lot more here than the small view we got - which is largely from a cold war perspective. Beggars cant be choosers - this is the best book out there on chemical weapons.\n\nNovember 11, 2013\n\nThis was an excellent history of the use of chemical weapons throughout the world in the twentieth and early twenty-first century. As a work of history, this book is extremely detailed and shows an in-depth picture of how chemical weapons have been used by both governments and on-state actors from World War I to the present day. However, one flaw in the book is the author's argument that existing international norms against chemical weapons be enforced further, and that more agreements be established to prevent their use. This is no guarantee of non-use even by governments that are signatories to such agreements. However, in spite of the flawed argument, this was an excellent, informative work of history that is recommended to anyone who wishes to learn more about the topic.\n\nOctober 14, 2020\n\nExcellent narrative which spans the entire history of chemical warfare, from its beginnings in WWI (we just passed the 100th anniversary in April) to the modern day terrorist threat. The book is extremely detailed - even from a chemistry standpoint - which may discourage some readers, but I highly recommend it to anyone who is curious to learn more about modern warfare and politics.\n\nI believe the author does well at remaining objective throughout the book, although at times he does seem to approach the issue of chemical warfare from a moral and ethical, black and white stance, which it clearly is not - there are many shades of gray to the argument.\n\nSeptember 20, 2014\n\nOne of the best book on chemical warfare, giving glimpse on 2003 Iraq War and the current threat of chemical terrorism. These super toxic poisons have no peaceful uses, they must not have been created in the first place. Tucker is trying his best by presenting the never ending ill effects of these nerve racking agents but unfortunately the governments do not seem to be getting much wiser."
