        "text": "AH, WILDERNESS! BY ART LINSON You’re a veteran producer (The Untouchables, Heat, Fight Club) with a deal at Twentieth Century Fox and a David Mamet script about two guys and a bear. Now all you need is a hot director and a couple of big stars, right?\n\nIt was the middle of December 1995, and I was feeling smug. This was one of those good Hollywood mornings when I actually woke up with the confidence that I’m usually faking. An article in that day’s trades pointed out that Paramount’s most profitable movie of the year was Clueless, a light comedy written and directed by Amy Heckerling, whose first movie, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, I had produced ages ago. But it wasn’t simply parental pride that gave me the satisfying glow. The article also mentioned that Clueless had been developed by Twentieth Century Fox, where I currently had a production deal. This was intriguing: Fox had put Clueless into turnaround, which meant that after the studio’s executives had dutifully read the script they’d passed on it—only to get snakebitten by its success months later at Paramount. To make matters even more uncomfortable for them, Fox was currently languishing near the bottom among all the major studios in terms of total grosses.\n\nThese kinds of mistakes, particularly when they are pointed out in the press, give the executives at any studio a jolt of insecurity, confirming their deeply hidden fears that maybe they don’t have a clue. Before they can regain their confidence (and it doesn’t take them long), the next bunch of salesmen through the door get the benefit of their doubts. Agents and producers start marching up and down the hallways saying, “Don’t worry, I’m a doctor. Stand aside, I know what I’m doing,” and for a brief period of time they are believed.\n\nGood timing was veering in my direction. This was useful because I was trying to persuade the powers that be at Fox to spend money. A lot of money.\n\nMy relationship with the studio had begun eight months earlier when I had met Fox’s recently appointed head of film production, Bill Mechanic, in the studio’s commissary, a large, overlit room with an institutional smell. My first take on Bill was that I liked him. He was rounder than your typical executive, which gave him a more available, less threatening demeanor. Charmingly out of fashion, he wore a shirt that was too dark, a tie that was all wrong, and strange shoes. I found out later that they were made of Naugahyde—he was an animal-rights activist.\n\nWhile we ate our veggie burgers, Mechanic expressed his interest in bringing me to Fox, and I expressed my interest in coming, since my current deal with Warner Bros. was about to expire, and given the box-office reception of my most recent film, This Boy’s Life, it wasn’t going to be renewed.\n\nBill and I shook hands. We were going to leave the rest up to the lawyers. I thanked him for the lunch. Then I glanced over Bill’s shoulder and accidentally made eye contact with Rupert Murdoch, Fox’s owner and Bill’s ultimate boss. He was seated imperiously at a back table. He didn’t know who I was, but his return gaze reflected grave disappointment.\n\n“By the way,” Bill said as we got up from the table.\n\n“Uh-huh?”\n\n“You could use a hit.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“Well, let’s hope it’s for us,” Bill said, smiling broadly.\n\nThe first rule of producing is to find a writer with an idea, or get an idea and find a writer. Since David Mamet and I had done The Untouchables together we’d developed a good professional working relationship: You get me a lot of money, I get you a good script.\n\nI placed the call: “Hi, Dave.”\n\n“What’s the shot?” he asked.\n\n“I got a new deal. I’m looking for you to write a new script.”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“There’ll be lots of money.”\n\n“Good. Let’s do it.”\n\n“It’s not that easy.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because if you don’t tell me what it’s about I can’t get you the money.”\n\n“Fine. What do you want it to be about?”\n\n“I don’t know, that’s why I’m calling you.”\n\n“I understand.”\n\n“Dave, how about an adventure movie?”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“Something castable. Two guys, maybe.”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“C’mon, Dave, I need more to go on.”\n\n“O.K. . . . How ’bout two guys and a bear?”\n\n“It’s a start.”\n\nHe soon got back to me with a rather well-worked-out wilderness story that promised big intrigue, betrayal, a fierce struggle for survival, and, indeed, a bear. I was quite confident that Fox would be engaged, but it was early on in the process. Even if they agreed to the screenplay, there was no assurance that it would be made into a movie. The consolation prize for a writer like Mamet would be that he’d get paid a pile of money. But for the producer, when a movie doesn’t get made, there is nothing to show for the time and the ultimate defeat. Moreover, failure usually reveals an inability to get everyone on the same track right from the start. At the pitch meeting.\n\nFor those of you who have never been in a pitch meeting, it’s nothing much different from door-to-door sales, except the financial stakes are higher. You must convince the guy with the checkbook that he needs whatever soap you’re selling. This is the very start of the process, and decisions made at this level have enormous impact.\n\n“Are you sure all I have to say is ‘It’s two guys and a bear. They get lost in the forest and have to learn to survive together even though one guy was trying to kill the other guy and take his young beautiful wife’?” Mamet asked.\n\nHe was not particularly concerned. He just wanted some reassurance that I had already worked things out and that this was going to be a mere formality. He had that look of “I’ll do my job—did you do yours?”\n\n“Yep, it’s in the bag,” I said.\n\nWe were making the long walk down the wide administration-building hallway, the wallpaper still revealing some leftover touches of Zanuck Green (a color that Darryl Zanuck, one of the studio’s founders, insisted on because it matched his mother’s nail polish), to deliver a pitch to Tom Jacobson, the newly appointed head of film production under Bill Mechanic. Wait a minute! Who’s Tom Jacobson? Wasn’t Mechanic the newly appointed head of film production under Peter Chernin? And wasn’t Chernin, who dutifully reported to Rupert Murdoch, head of worldwide motion pictures? Well, yes, it’s all true. It’s a complicated system. Even the most experienced insider has a gruesome time trying to find out where the buck stops. If you’re looking for solid answers, it’s rare to find them in movie meetings.\n\nThe best way an outsider can understand these subtle distinctions is by asking, Who has the power to say yes, maybe, or no? Tom Jacobson could say no, but if he wanted to say yes to anything, he would have to appeal to Bill Mechanic for an approval. And even if he wanted to say no, Mechanic could overrule him, assuming you knew how to get to Mechanic. If the request was very expensive, such as the green-lighting of a $50 million movie, Mechanic would have to appeal to Chernin for approval. If Mechanic wanted to say no, it would end there, unless you could appeal to Chernin to overrule Mechanic. If a request was very, very expensive, such as more money for a Titanic production that was running mercilessly out of control, Chernin would have to ask Murdoch for approval. As complicated as all this seems, it is a method designed to pass on the risks and diffuse the blame. As you might suspect, the executive at the bottom of this pole is naked. Darryl Hannah’s manager wields more power. This guy might be able to jaw his way into a good table at a restaurant with his Fox president-of-film-production business card, but when he goes to work the next day, he is a duck waiting to hear the gunshot.\n\nTom Jacobson had this job.\n\nI had already explained to Mechanic the drift of Mamet’s story, but he insisted for purposes of protocol that we run it past Jacobson. Could we do it on the phone?, I asked. No. Proper protocol, he insisted, meant going to Jacobson’s office. Since Mamet lived in Boston, this required a trip to L.A., which always left him in a mixed mood. A trip to L.A. may seem like a small price to pay to pick up $1-million-plus, but pitching is pitching. At its best, even when it’s operating on all cylinders, it’s very annoying. At its worst, it’s a humiliation for everyone in the room.\n\nWe entered Tom’s office accompanied by his assistant. It turned out to be twice the size of Mechanic’s office. Hmmm. I didn’t step it off, but I was tempted. If my office were twice the size of the guy who hired me, I would immediately ask for some partitions or at the very least donate a good part of it to some dispossessed underling. Being offered all of this grandness smelled like a setup to me. Call me cynical, but it sure felt like this guy was renting.\n\n“Boston’s a wonderful city,” Tom said as he leaned back in his chair, his feet pushing off the coffee table.\n\n“Sure is,” Mamet said.\n\n“Cultural.”\n\n“Very.”\n\n“Gosh, I love it—the seasons, you know.”\n\n“Uh-huh.”\n\n“Winter,” he said, trying to make out Mamet’s reaction.\n\nAwkward silence.\n\nThe room was dying. Tom turned his attention toward me.\n\n“So, we know what David’s been up to—what about you?” Tom asked.\n\n“Well, I’m at Fox, working for you.”\n\nAwkward silence.\n\nTom was encouraging me to get this fucker rolling. Even Mamet was looking at me peculiarly, as if to say, What exactly do you do for a living? I took the hint.\n\n“Well, Tom, Dave here has this good idea for a movie.”\n\nTom, who is a mellow, diminutive sort, gave me a glance of “Thanks for the help.” Everyone’s patience was shaky. Introductory small talk at pitch meetings, especially when the parties are complete strangers, always disintegrates into a treacly mess. Tom put his fingertips together and placed them near his lips.\n\n“So, can you tell me a little bit of what it’s about?”\n\n“Indeed, I can.” David started in, speaking at a very rapid pace. “There’s this extremely wealthy and refined, bookish man living in New York, who is married and very much in love with a beautiful, young fashion model, who has an assignment to go on a photo shoot in the wilds of Alaska. The photographer, a dashing young up-and-comer, knows the girl. She invites her husband to go—a get-out-of-the-house sort of thing. We soon learn that there is some competition between the two men for the girl. In fact, the photographer has an agenda to maybe do away with our bookish gentleman, marry the model, and inherit the wealth. And our girl may be in on it. Before he gets a chance, however, the two men, while sight-seeing for locations in a small plane, violently crash in the middle of no—”\n\n“Could I stop you there for a second?” Tom jumped in with a very uneasy look on his face. David was just revving up.\n\n“Am I going too fast?”\n\n“No . . . it’s not that . . .”\n\n“Perhaps I should start over.”\n\n“No, not necessary.”\n\n“Well, what’s the problem?”\n\n“I just wonder if the smart fellow has to have so much money?”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“You know, I’m worried.”\n\n“You’re worried?”\n\n“I’m concerned, that’s all.”\n\nMamet shot me a “Where do we go from here?” glare.\n\n“But they’re trying to get his money,” I chimed in, hoping David would stay in his seat.\n\n“I know.”\n\n“If he has no money, then there’s no sense in trying to get it—that’s the plot,” I said, almost begging.\n\n“O.K. then, let me ask you, David, do you really think an audience can root for a guy who has money?”\n\nDavid waited for several seconds, as if he had just been asked to explain the concept of time in the universe.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nFor some reason, this detour threw David and everyone else in the room into the wrong spin. The rhythm of the pitch had been inexorably altered. Finally, Tom took charge.\n\n“All right then . . . let’s continue.”\n\n“Um, well, then they run into a bear,” David said quietly, “. . . and then they kill the bear.” It was all that he could muster.\n\nAfter a long, embarrassing pause, we all stood up. Tom thanked us and said he would get back to us as soon as possible. In the hallway, as we made our brisk walk through the building, I couldn’t help but notice the poster for The Poseidon Adventure. The ad line at the top read, HELL, UPSIDE DOWN, and a giant crashing tidal wave was about to drown a cast of thousands.\n\n“What just happened?” David asked.\n\n“I think it went well.”\n\n“What’s it like when it goes bad?”\n\n“They tell you no in the room.”\n\nI was right. It had gone well enough, and Mamet was hired. I was in the honeymoon phase at Fox, the grace period when the buyer wants to believe he’s made the right purchase. Mechanic had just made this deal with me. He had to show me some support or his superiors were going to question why the hell the deal was made in the first place.\n\nFour months later the screenplay was finished. Fox greeted it with positive restraint. Executives, always fearful and reluctant, get squeamish when they have to say yes. New elements and new enthusiasms have to be added to the mix or the momentum quickly fades. That’s where I was on that bright December morning: I knew I had to quickly get a cast and secure a director for Bookworm, as the script was titled, or it was never going to get made.\n\n‘Do you know why you are rapidly losing the hair on your ankles?” Dustin Hoffman asked me, noticing I was not wearing socks.\n\n“No. Not really,” I said, glancing at my feet.\n\n“You’re getting older.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“It’s a genetic thing.”\n\n“Interesting.”\n\n“Loss of testosterone, really.”\n\n“I see.”\n\n“It doesn’t happen to everyone.”\n\n“Can something be done?”\n\n“I’m afraid not.”\n\n“Nothing?”\n\n“I don’t think so.”\n\nI looked over at Lee Tamahori, wondering if he knew how to shift the focus of the conversation. We were entering the second hour of our meeting with Dustin at his office, and we still hadn’t gotten to the script. Lee returned the look, as if to say, “Is this how you guys do it up here?” Preliminary small talk was taking on a new meaning.\n\nLee, a Kiwi, had recently directed his first movie, Once Were Warriors, a tale of a Maori family dealing with contemporary life in urban New Zealand. It was a spirited, raw, hard-edged movie that became the highest-grossing film in New Zealand’s history. After seeing the movie, I sent Bookworm to Lee and was buoyed by his interest. The studio executives, because of the sizzle on Once Were Warriors, were cautiously encouraging us to get a couple of “stars.” Only then, they implied, would they fund the movie. No guarantees, but so far so good.\n\nWe had met with Mechanic and Jacobson to make cast lists a few weeks earlier. We were there to ask: Who were the key actors who could play an aging, wealthy bookworm? Who were the key actors who could play a younger fashion photographer intent on stealing the bookworm’s money and wife? These lists did not necessarily include the “best” actor for the job. For example, Robert Duvall may be a perfect choice for the bookworm, but when the computer tallies up his recent box-office wreckage, he may not be considered as good a business choice as Bill Cosby. Trying to create a pecking order that would satisfy us as well as the studio turned into a random guessing game. We were rats chasing our tails.\n\nFirst, we received the obligatory and expected turndown from Harrison Ford. At that time, any script that required a male lead over 45 went directly to Harrison because his acquiescence ensured a start date. It didn’t matter if the character was an international spy or a transvestite. If the character was an older male, it went to Ford. Unless, of course, Tom Cruise was interested. Cruise would’ve been allowed to play the bear in our script, or any other role of his choosing. Since Ford passed, our next stop was Dustin Hoffman, because his agent said he had read the script and was interested. A bird in the hand. Dustin Hoffman wasn’t tearing up the box office the way he once had, but he was still a star. Fox encouraged the flirtation.\n\nThis is always a tenuous time in the packaging of a movie. Here’s how it works: Though the people at the studio may get excited, even giddy, about the new script (as they claimed to be about Bookworm), they always have several other scripts in the pipeline that they allegedly fancy. Optimistic and encouraging as they appear, they are simply not going to make all of them. The executives’ collective enthusiasm for the material can bounce around like a baby’s temperature. When Harrison Ford passes, their enthusiasm dips. If he passed but they think he probably didn’t read the damn thing personally, the dip begins to rise. If several actors or directors pass, their enthusiasm goes on life support. If you get a nibble—as we’d gotten from Dustin—spirits lift. If and when he passes, confidence wanes again, and eventually, as the rejections add up, finger-pointing inevitably follows. “Who the fuck on my staff liked this piece-of-shit script anyhow?” “Can you believe even Richard Gere thought it was bad?”\n\nWhen I was in the elevator it occurred to me that Dustin had made one reference to the script about an hour earlier. He’d said Bookworm reminded him of Straw Dogs. Since that Peckinpah movie was one of my favorites, and since Dustin was so fine in it, I first took this to be a good thing. Wrong. He’d done this part already! Of course! Bookish guy with a pretty, seductive wife having to rise to the occasion when the going got brutal. Dustin’s a rich man. Why would he ever do the same part again? We could spend the next six months having nice chats with Dustin, but when the time came to put the chips on the table, I was sure he wasn’t going to be there, and I was more sure I would have even less hair on my ankles.\n\nAlec Baldwin might be in. His agent said that he had read the script and wanted to talk about the role of the duplicitous fashion photographer. Lee and I greeted the news with measured enthusiasm. I knew that Alec was never going to make the walls of the Fox administration building shake with delight. His past success was spotty, and there were rumors he was difficult. At best, I thought, Alec would be considered solid “element” but not enough of a reason for Fox to pull the trigger. Still, it was the strongest nibble so far.\n\nWe agreed to meet with Alec for lunch at some trendy bistro off of La Cienega. Lee and I got there early to strategize because these first encounters are always tricky. You don’t know if the actor is flirting with the role or if he is actually hooked. But that first lunch does give you some indication as to how the dynamics are going to work if the movie actually gets made. Is this going to be an easy ride, or are you going to be sliding down a gravel driveway together naked?\n\nWhen Alec arrived at the table, he was dressed in a suit and tie, looking as if he were running for a Long Island congressional seat. Unable to camouflage my desperation to get a big-name actor to commit, I began with the predictable propitiating smiles and nods. “Gosh, you were brilliant in blah blah blah” and “How about that speech in Glengarry? Oh, man, it was an aria . . . wasn’t it, Lee?” I couldn’t control myself. To his credit, Alec responded to the horseshit flattery by saying he was a particular fan of David Mamet’s writing and would be eager to take on this role. No caveats. Simple as that.\n\nUnfortunately, this all happened in the first five minutes. We hadn’t even ordered yet, and I was ready to call for the check. It’s an old maxim in Hollywood: Take yes for an answer and quickly leave the room. The rest of the lunch was made up of awkward sound bites like, “God, this is really going to be great.” “We’re so damn excited.” “Did I already tell you how much I love your work? . . . Of course I did.”\n\nThe only caveat for me—and at the time I did not lend it much importance—was that Alec kept avoiding making eye contact with Tamahori, who, after all, might soon be his director. I thought later that perhaps Alec did not want to cozy up to Lee too soon. Nonetheless, there was something in the air, but I ignored it. My job was to get the movie made. If there were going to be difficulties, we would deal with them down the road. For now, we had a very good actor eager to do the part.\n\nThe next day, I was seated in Bill Mechanic’s office next to a large bowl of soft candies, waiting for him to get off the phone. I would start each meeting swearing to Bill that I would not touch the candy. It was the kind of stuff you’d be embarrassed to hand out on Halloween. But the anxiety of rarely getting what I wanted out of these meetings inevitably forced me into the candy bowl within minutes.\n\n“Good news. Alec Baldwin wants to play the photographer,” I opened confidently.\n\n“I heard,” Bill said, not matching my enthusiasm.\n\n“He’s a wonderful actor.”\n\n“He’s expensive.”\n\n“He has lots of energy.”\n\n“I hear he hates producers.”\n\n“Who doesn’t these days?”\n\n“He doesn’t sell tickets.”\n\n“What about Hunt for Red October?”\n\n“That was a lifetime ago.”\n\n“But it was huge.”\n\n“What kind of guy walks away from the sequel after such a big hit and lets Harrison Ford take his place?”\n\nI reached into the bowl for a green one.\n\n“Lee and I think he’s perfect for the part.”\n\n“I hear he’s trouble.”\n\n“Beating up a photographer doesn’t make you trouble. Anyways, it was in self-defense.”\n\n“He can’t carry a movie.”\n\n“Bill, who can carry a movie?”\n\n“Tom Cruise.”\n\n“What are you saying?”\n\n“I’m saying if you can find a star for the other part, then maybe we can match him up with Alec.”\n\n“I’m always one star short.”\n\n“You are one star short.”\n\nIn the delicate pas de deux of Hollywood meetings, this was a positive exchange. Bill was basically saying that he really liked the material, that in fact he was seriously inclined to make the movie, but that he needed as much ammo as possible. His job was to protect against the downside, to second-guess everything, and he did it in an amiable way. My general take on Bill was that for all he liked to talk numbers—grosses, preview scores, etc.—he seemed to care about movies, and he even seemed to like the people who made the movies, unlikely attributes for an executive in this day. But I also knew he wanted Bookworm to be more than a good movie; he wanted and needed a hit. Who could blame him? I needed a hit as well.\n\n“Bill, why don’t we make a deal with Alec now and make it subject to finding the other guy?”\n\n“We can explore it, but I would also have to make the offer subject to a budget.”\n\n“Well, then Fox wouldn’t be bound at all.”\n\n“That’s right.” He smiled.\n\n“Gee.”\n\n“Hey, the other part’s the real star of the movie anyway.”\n\n“We think Alec’s kind of a star.”\n\n“Good. Let’s find another, bigger star.”\n\n“Sure, let’s find a bigger star,” I said, reaching into the candy bowl for the last time. I took a huge handful for the road.\n\nAfter the mandate from Mechanic, I decided to talk to Robert De Niro. The part of Charles Morse, the aging, shy, erudite, bookish rich man, was not a role you would immediately feel was smart casting for De Niro—unless he thought he could do it. Ever since The Untouchables, in which he played Al Capone, Bob and I had remained close friends. When the new script was completed I had wanted to send it to him, but he was so booked up with other pictures that the timing was bad. It would have been too easy for him to say no. But by the time Lee and I had slogged through the predictable turndowns, the timing had improved. I gave Bob Bookworm and awaited his response.\n\nMy phone rang.\n\n“Hey.”\n\n“Hey.”\n\n“What’d ya think?”\n\n“I like it.”\n\n“How much?”\n\n“I like it.”\n\n“How about Alec Baldwin for the photographer?”\n\n“I like him.”\n\n“Great. Let’s do it.”\n\n“I like it. It’s got some good things in it.”\n\n“Great. Let’s go.”\n\n“I think we need a reading.”\n\n“But you just read it.”\n\n“I think we should have a reading.”\n\n“Let me read it to you over the phone.”\n\n“We should have a reading.”\n\nWhen he agreed to do The Untouchables, he had not asked for a reading. This response was a bit better than being on life support, but it was way too soon to open the Veuve Clicquot.\n\n“Fine. Let’s have a reading.”\n\n“You set it up. It would be nice if Alec was there.”\n\n“I hate readings.”\n\n“Set up a reading.”\n\n“Fine.”\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with a reading, this is different from when an actor is reading without an offer. This sort of reading is when several actors sit around a table and read the script out loud. If you are an actor or a director who is grappling with the question of committing to the material, the reading is supposed to provide some special insight, some connection, that quietly perusing the script at home would not give. It’s a high-stakes game with very sizable decisions riding on its outcome. When readings go bad, not only do you lose those actors who you were trying to attract, but you might also lose those actors who are already committed. In this case, if De Niro decided Bookworm was not for him, would that send Baldwin running away as well, shrieking, “Thank the Lord! It’s only a scratch. I’m out of here”? A project can quickly skid off the road without much chance of recovery.\n\nOur reading, with Alec and Bob and a couple of actors performing the smaller parts, actually went O.K. Though Bob read his part in an expressionless monotone—he didn’t want to make any “choices” before committing to the part—I thought I detected a slight flicker of interest in his satisfied grin as we finished. But it was not the time or the place to ask the unaskable “Are you going to agree to do this fucking script or what?” Bryan Lourd, one of Bob’s agents at CAA, was there. He walked out nodding with an inscrutable expression, and whispered to me, “I’ll call you later.” Alec seemed happy. He knew that he was going to cream his part if we ever did get the movie off the ground. And Lee and I were cautiously pleased. If we discovered nothing, we at least confirmed that this was going to be a very compelling story. We just had to cast Morse and get the money.\n\nI met Bob later for a drink. I knew as soon as I saw him walk in that he was not going to do the part. You learn to read the signals. It’s not what he does; it’s what he doesn’t do. It’s in his eyes.\n\n“Don’t say anything. I can tell it’s over.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“You’re not gonna commit.”\n\n“I like it.”\n\n“There’s a problem.”\n\n“The bear worries me.”\n\n“The bear?!”\n\n“The bear.”\n\n“Y’sure it’s not Alec or Lee?”\n\n“For now, it’s the bear.”\n\n“What part of the bear?”\n\n“You know, fighting with a fake bear. Might not work.”\n\n“We’re gonna use a real bear some of the time.”\n\n“A real bear is interesting.”\n\n“Well, then we’re gonna use a real bear a lot.”\n\nA beat.\n\n“The bear . . . the bear still concerns me.”\n\nThere was no sense in belaboring this. Bob was not going to do the movie.\n\nRick Nicita, Anthony Hopkins’s agent, called to say his client wanted the part of Charles Morse. This was a particularly good call because there were no strings attached, no qualifications. Hopkins had signed off on the script, loved the idea of doing it with Alec Baldwin, had seen Tamahori’s first movie, thought it was excellent, and was ready to approve him.\n\nCheck!\n\nAll that was left was Fox’s endorsement.\n\nIt had become evident over the last few months that Peter Chernin, Mechanic’s boss, was increasingly taking himself out of the line of fire. Where he used to directly engage in the major green-light decisions, now Mechanic was the only one in the room. Chernin was exhibiting expert Teflon instincts. He had no choice. Titanic was in the middle of production, and the costs were staggering out of control. While I was trying to get this small movie launched, Fox was completely absorbed and distracted by James Cameron. With that chaos swirling, the decisions that had to be made on other movies seemed less monumental.\n\nIt was a good time to get something done.\n\nPutting Tony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin together for the first time was excellent casting from a creative point of view. Both were extraordinary actors. Both were perfectly suited for their respective roles—it was an exciting combination. The only hitch (and I knew that it would surface soon) was the perception that Anthony Hopkins doesn’t really “sell tickets,” a Hollywood euphemism for “He isn’t Tom Hanks.”\n\nWho is?\n\nI came up with an ingenious way to sell this stew.\n\n“Bill, I’ve got a theory.”\n\n“Oh, here it comes.”\n\n“One plus one equals three.”\n\n“I don’t get it.”\n\n“One plus one equals three. Don’t you think one Hopkins and one Baldwin together for the first time on the screen equal one Harrison Ford?”\n\n“No. Absolutely not.”\n\n“Bill, together these guys are going to sell tickets. I feel the sizzle.”\n\n“They might . . . but I’m certain Harrison Ford will.”\n\nObviously, my little theory wasn’t the catalyst that got Bill to agree to a start date and a budget of $30 million. Over the last several weeks he had been pushing Lee and me to deliver the best possible package without putting Fox at risk. He knew Hopkins and Baldwin were as far as we were going to get. And that wasn’t too shabby. Making it for $30 million would be right at the risk line for this kind of picture. What with video, DVD, foreign, and cable, it would only have to perform modestly in the United States for Fox to get its investment back. Even though the picture might lack the sexiness of a Brad Pitt movie or the grandness of a Titanic, it was still a good piece of business. Not all pictures are going to feel like slam dunks. With this cast, Bill could commiserate with Chernin, and neither would be called out for embarrassing themselves.\n\nCanmore, a picturesque small town nestled in the Canadian Rockies about 90 miles west of the Calgary airport, was chosen as the production headquarters for Bookworm. With towering mountains and expansive forests, it was an ideal location to film an outdoor-adventure picture. We decided to build a lodge on a nearby lake, and the rest of the locations would be found primarily in the surrounding wilds. The actual shooting of the movie, compressed to a 55-day schedule, went along rather uneventfully. There were the occasional complications that occur when you are using an 1,800-pound real bear. But, all in all, our “Bart the bear” was a total pro. He could give us several different looks, growl on command, and even do comedy if it was required. An animatronic bear, which we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to construct, turned out to be less effective. Next to a real bear who can “act,” a robot bear becomes extremely artificial. As filming progressed, the fake bear spent more and more time in the prop truck.\n\nA brief scare did occur during filming. Hopkins, who was taking painkillers for a pinched nerve in his neck, went down with hypothermia after spending several hours in freezing water re-enacting the plane crash. Apparently, the painkillers were so deadening that he couldn’t feel the cold. While in the hospital for the hypothermia, the pain from his neck became so acute that an immediate operation was necessary. This shut down production for several days. As you might imagine, despite all of the genuine concern for our star, the real relief for the studio execs came when they were assured that the incident was covered by insurance. The calls to Tony were “Get well soon, big guy,” while the calls to us were “What’s our deductible? What’s our deductible?!”\n\nThere was another problem, however, one that had a far-reaching and dampening effect on the morale of the whole shoot. Ten days before the start of principal photography, Lee decided it would be a good idea to take one more look at the script. He called for a reading with the main cast and crew members to take place the following morning. A final run-through would provide an opportunity for the director to examine the script as a whole. There is an old showbiz maxim that once shooting starts, making a movie is like eating an elephant with a teaspoon—one nibble at a time. A last look at the script before you lose perspective can be a good idea. Since everyone in the room already has a job, these readings are usually relaxed and fun.\n\nSeated around a conference-room table were Tamahori; Elle Macpherson, who landed the cameo part of Hopkins’s trophy wife; Harold Perrineau, who was playing the photographer’s assistant; L. Q. Jones, as the lodge owner; Don McAlpine, the cinematographer; the script girl; and myself. Then Alec and Tony entered the room. For those working behind the scenes on a movie, seeing the stars together for the first time can be heady stuff. After the first week of photography the exhilaration quickly turns to work and becomes old hat, but in those initial few days we are reduced to hopeless fans. And, in an odd way, you can sense that the performers feel the same sense of awe for each other.\n\nI had just arrived from New York, and I hadn’t seen Alec since that reading with De Niro several months before. Surprisingly, Alec was now wearing a full beard. Not just your average beard, either—this beard had run amok. It was as if he had entered a Grizzly Adams look-alike contest. I assumed he probably wanted to see what he was going to look like when he was stranded out in the wilds for several weeks. Like any diligent actor, particularly someone as intense as Alec, he was simply exploring the character. It had an interesting impact. Twenty pounds heavier than he had been at our lunch, combined with the flowing gray beard, he had completely stripped himself of his leading-man looks. The effect made him seem older than Hopkins. No longer the predatory, attractive Lothario the character was at the outset of the story, Alec looked like the beaten man who was to be bested by a bookworm out in the wilds. What a clever and effective way to explore the character, I thought—by experiencing the end first.\n\nAs they started going through the script, Alec and Tony took the material to new heights. Listening to these actors read Mamet’s stuff was like watching butter melt. Everyone applauded at the end. We briefly talked about some minor script changes to take up with Mamet, and the reading was adjourned.\n\nAs Lee and I walked to our cars we reviewed the situation:\n\n“What’s with the beard thing?” I asked.\n\n“Don’t know.”\n\n“Did you tell him to shave?”\n\n“I’m going to bring it up, but I haven’t done it yet.”\n\n“If he doesn’t shave, Fox will go nuts.”\n\n“We have a week. I’m sure he plans on shaving.”\n\n“I thought so when he walked in. But after seeing him read, I sensed this is going to be his look.”\n\n“We got time.”\n\n“Lee, let me explain the Fox situation. They didn’t really want to hire this guy in the first place. The guy cost $5 million, for God’s sake.”\n\n“Hey, that’s your department.”\n\n“If Mechanic thought Alec was going to enter this fight overweight, bearded, and old, his price would have been two free dinners at Spago and 10 percent of the net.”\n\n“I’ll tell Alec tomorrow he’s got to shave.”\n\n“I’ve got a bad feeling.”\n\n“He’s probably just getting into character.”\n\n“Here’s hoping, because otherwise Fox’s demographics for this movie will be limited to retirement villages in Boca Raton.”\n\nLee looked at his watch. “I’ve got to go check on the mechanical bear.”\n\nLater, as I visited one of the locations, the clean air and the exhilaration of the scenery overtook any darker thoughts. In fact, for a brief moment, I was consumed by the producer’s ultimate perk. To be in such a beautiful spot, watch a movie get made, and get paid for it was a sinful pleasure. Don’t get me wrong: being able to occasionally tell an agent or an executive, “I’m sorry, I’m going to have to pass—go fuck yourself,” is also a guilty pleasure that ranks high on the Hollywood ladder. But the serenity of being in the middle of the majestic Rockies, on someone else’s dime, was the brass ring.\n\n‘Motherfucker. MOTHERFUCKER!”\n\n“But, Alec, if you . . .”\n\n“MOTHERFUCKING movie PRODUCER. I knew this was coming, the bullshit Hollywood mentality telling ME . . . MOTHERFUCKER!”\n\nAlec calmly placed his leather jacket on an empty chair near the rear wall of the wardrobe trailer. The two girls who were fitting him were directly in the line of fire. They remained frozen. It had been three days, and Lee was unable to pop the question, so I finally jumped in with my best version of “When’s the beard going to go?” I looked over at Lee, who was seated next to me at the fitting table, trying to absorb the magnitude of the explosion. It wasn’t quite the response for which we had hoped.\n\n“Have you told him about the shutting-down thing?” he asked out loud.\n\n“No. John, he left before we had a chance.”\n\n“What about lawsuit? Did you mention the word ‘lawsuit’?”\n\n“I didn’t feel it was the right time.”\n\nI could hear his breathing getting heavier. He knew he had to put on the blindfold and get a cigarette. I didn’t envy him.\n\n“Hey, that’s why you get the big bucks,” I said, trying to lighten up the call.\n\n“I’ll get back to you.”\n\nClick.\n\n“We got till Monday,” I explained to the dead line.\n\nTraditionally, the first day of shooting is an exciting and tension-filled time. It is the milestone that says, “This baby is launched. There will be no going back.” The studio usually sends you a basket of fruit or a leather folder. Past acrimony is replaced with sentiments such as “Break a leg” or “Knock ’em dead.” Unfortunately, when Monday morning arrived, we were still uncertain if Alec was going to show up without the beard and ready for work. Many calls were traded, but not even his lawyer knew where this was going. The entire cast and crew were caught up in the suspense.\n\nAs we huddled by the frozen lake preparing to film the first setup, Alec finally arrived in a large S.U.V and quickly walked into his trailer. Lee and I only caught a glimpse, but he was clean-shaven. The crew were about to cheer, but they knew better. Our feelings were mixed. We were pleased that we were going to get on with it, but pained that with Alec so pissed off the next 10 weeks could be difficult. I remember when he finished with hair and makeup and arrived on the set. I tried to stand off in the distance, slightly hidden by one of the large fir trees. I didn’t want my presence to come off as gloating. As the first shot with Tony, Alec, and Harold Perrineau was in final rehearsal by the camera, I couldn’t help but notice that when Lee was talking Alec would only look at Hopkins. Direct eye contact between Tamahori and Baldwin remained nonexistent for the rest of the shoot. John Burnham would pay the ultimate price by losing his client.\n\nMonths later, I asked an actor friend of mine why Alec would have been so insistent on not shaving his beard. What sort of funky Stanislavsky decision would make him so committed? My friend said, without hesitation, “Alec probably thought he was a little too heavy and he didn’t like the way his chin looked.”\n\nOnce a movie is completed, it gets turned over, so to speak, to the marketing “wizards,” whose job it is to sell the thing. With all the precariousness of the business, you would think that the people who have these jobs would get hired and fired like fast-food workers, but nothing could be further from the truth. The only one safer than a studio head is the head of marketing. Nothing is ever his fault. If a movie works, it had a goddamn great campaign. If a movie fails, well, you get the drill: the movie had an incurable cancer. The doctor tried his best, but it was God’s will.\n\nAnd so, after Bob Harper, Fox’s head of marketing, saw an early rough cut of Bookworm, he told me it was a very good movie, but, of course, he had some grave concerns. I’m quite sure he gave the same response to Chernin, Mechanic, et al. First, he said, we were going to have to do something about the title, since his gut told him it was going to turn people off. Every time he uttered the word Bookworm, his face would pucker. And, by the way, Harper wanted everyone to know that the demographics were shit. Hadn’t we realized that the favorable audience for Tony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin skewed over 30? And, surely, everyone knew that movies with lots of action skewed under 30. According to my calculations, if Harper’s analyses were right, there would be no age group interested in seeing this movie.\n\nSince marketing is the last stop on a film’s journey, however, the natural inclination is to not piss off the marketing guys. Once Harper had given me his dire prognosis, I was eager to be polite and ooze gratitude.\n\n“Tell me what we should do, Bob.”\n\n“Well, for starters, let’s change that title . . .” He was about to say Bookworm, but the word had become too distasteful.\n\n“Hey, whatever works, you know me.”\n\nI should have lost my producer’s license with that remark.\n\nFor the next few weeks, while a trailer was being cut and different one-sheet posters were being prepared, numerous lists of titles were made. Here are some of the choices:\n\nWild\n\nWilder\n\nThe Wild\n\nInto the Wild\n\nWilderness Now\n\nDeadhunt\n\nDeadfall\n\nOn the Precipice\n\nOver the Precipice\n\nEdge\n\nThe Edge\n\nOn the Edge\n\nThe Bear Roared\n\nThe Bear and the Brain\n\nBloody Betrayal\n\nAt one time or another we had everything on this list but If You Come to See This Shitstorm, We’ll Pay You.\n\nI read the list to Mamet over the phone. When I finished, he was only able to utter, “Oh, God.”\n\nThose of you who saw this film on TV or happened to drift into your local cineplex know that we settled on The Edge. As with most collective decisions made in the name of creativity, we ended up choosing a banal solution which, by definition, would be the least provocative and the least objectionable. Years later, I remain so dithered by the process that I can only refer to the film as “the bear movie.”\n\nTo my taste, it provided some truly memorable scenes between Hopkins and Baldwin, supported by remarkable writing and able directing. For its opening weekend in September 1997, the film grossed $7.7 million on 2,351 screens, putting it in fourth place. (The No. 1 movie, The Peacemaker, grossed $12.3 million.) No one from the studio called Tamahori or me with the news. Four weeks later, it became apparent that the domestic gross of our picture would settle around $30 million. Hardly a smash hit, and yet not a total wipeout. Compared with recent Fox debacles such as Firestorm, The Newton Boys, or Chain Reaction, we looked virginal.\n\nWhen I saw Mechanic from my office window on the Tuesday following the opening, I was more than aware that we hadn’t spoken since Friday. He was alone, making the long trek from the administration building to the commissary, dwarfed by the kitschy murals painted on the sides of the large soundstages. As he passed under the 60-foot-high rendering of Darth Vader dueling Luke Skywalker, I decided to intercept him and commiserate.\n\n“Hey, Bill. How’s it going?”\n\n“It’s lunchtime.”\n\n“Sure is.”\n\nHe didn’t look quite so sanguine up close.\n\n“I know. I know. It’s not a homer, but I’m thinking, ground-rule double.”\n\n“We’re projecting the movie to lose $10 million,” he said stoically.\n\n“Really.”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n“You know this even before it’s released internationally?”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n“Even before the DVD comes out?”\n\n“Pretty much.”\n\n“What if . . .”\n\n“Hear me, we’re going to lose money.”\n\nI assumed, with that sort of forecast, Mechanic must be smarting from his Murdoch/Chernin-inflicted rope burns.\n\nWe eyed each other, both of us awkward and unfulfilled. Throughout the entire production, Bill had remained a supportive and generous influence. His disappointment was genuine. In the end, however, he was a victim and a slave to the numbers.\n\nHe kept walking.\n\nI wanted to keep it cheery by adding, “Say, Bill, maybe we can call it an infield single?”\n\nBut I decided to let it go.\n\nExcerpted from What Just Happened?: Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line, by Art Linson, to be published next month by Bloomsbury; © 2002 by the author."
