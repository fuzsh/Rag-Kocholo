        "text": "War Of Nerves, Chemical Warfare from World War I to Al-Qaeda,by Jonathan B. Tucker. 479 pages,Pantheon Books, $30.\n\nA four-milligram droplet of VX can kill you in under an hour. Your first symptoms will probably include drooling, sweating, difficulty breathing and the constriction of your pupils to zombie pinpoints. Then come gastrointestinal spasms, vomiting, convulsions and finally death by asphyxiation.\n\nThis is not obviously more barbaric than, for instance, being ripped apart by shrapnel in so-called legitimate warfare. Chemical weapons are less devastating than nuclear or biological weaponry, and are trickier to use in combat than high explosives. Yet poison weapons have been widely reviled for centuries. They are easier to make than nuclear or biological arms, and, since soldiers with advance notice can shield themselves, they are tempting for use against unwary civilians.\n\nJonathan B. Tucker's chilling \"War of Nerves\" is a history of the race between the advance of this taboo technology and the political efforts to abolish it. Tucker, who has a gift for making military science readable, wants a world secure from such repellent weapons. But human destructiveness always seems a step or two ahead of civilization.\n\nAs early as 1675, France and Germany outlawed poison bullets. In the 1899 Hague Convention, the major European countries — including Britain, France, Germany and Russia — and the United States swore not to use \"poison or poisoned weapons,\" and signed an additional declaration renouncing projectiles meant only to carry asphyxiating gas.\n\nBut these humane efforts were dashed by the battlefield necessities of World War I. In April 1915, hoping for a military breakthrough, Germany launched the war's first major chemical attack, releasing chlorine gas to blow toward French and Algerian troops in their trenches at Ypres, in Belgium. As Tucker gruesomely recounts, along four miles of the front line, tons of yellow-green gas rose to a height of 30 feet as the wind slowly edged it forward. The lethal cloud scorched the eyes and lungs of the terrified French and Algerian soldiers, who vomited and collapsed in agony. Hundreds died, coughing up blood and green froth. The soldiers' silver insignia and buckles immediately turned greenish black. Five months later, Britain launched its own retaliatory chlorine attack, and by 1916 both the Allies and the Central Powers were using artillery packed with chemicals - a total collapse of the Hague declaration.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
