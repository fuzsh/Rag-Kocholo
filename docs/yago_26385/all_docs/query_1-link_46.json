        "text": "Another big catch-up post\n\nWasn't Fox News the network where Wayne Rogers ended up being a talking head on financial matters?\n\nOkay- here's my take on Alda and his characterization of Hawkeye. What I like most about the character are his flaws- the alcoholism (don't try and tell me Hawkeye isn't an alkie), the womanizing, the self righteous/self indignant sanctimony...truth be told, his constant joking (effectively aping Groucho Marx, especially in the earlier seasons) is what drives me nuts about the character. @czeskleba This is why I actually like the \"Fallen Idol\" episode- it emphasizes Hawkeye's myriad flaws. Or \"Inga\"...I like it when Hawkeye gets put in his place by a woman. IMO though he was nowhere near as misanthropic, Hawkeye Pierce was the Gregory House of his time; and in both cases it is the flaws in their characters that I like the most about them, although I admit over time Hawkeye is decidedly easier to stomach than House is. The last time my wife and I tried watching the House series we had to give it up about halfway through the fifth season or so- as my wife put it, \"House is just too much of an a-shole to watch after a while.\" Hawkeye's not that bad. Yes, we know after a while Alda had a lot of influence over the direction of the character, but like I said earlier, he made the character his own, alter ego or not.\n\nI don't mind that the tone of the show changed...my only issue is how they weren't really subtle about it. You can literally feel the humour being drained from the show, although I think we would be hard to pressed to pinpoint exactly when the changes started...lotta differing opinions on that score. Yeah, season 6 is a major turning point in the series, but one could argue that the tone started shifting when Henry gets killed, or even with an episode like \"Sometimes You Hear The Bullet\".\n\nYou would really hate the movie version, then, though I imagine you've probably seen it at some point.\n\nMargaret especially, and to a lesser degree, Radar. I don't think Hawkeye changed that much, or at least not as drastically as Margaret and Radar did. Margaret turns into a completely different person- like my wife said, when we got to about season 8 or so watching the series: \"I know it's the same actress, but is she playing a different character?\". Margaret's changes seem completely implausible and unrealistic to me. The show is supposed to take place over a three year time period- nobody, I don't care who you are, can change that much as a person in such a short period of time. The writers essentially changed the Margaret character from the \"regular Army clown\" of the early seasons to a bubbleheaded bimbo who would throw herself at every unattached guy who showed up in the unit (or so it seems)- especially after her failed marriage. Sure, that was always a certain aspect of her personality (seems to me in the early seasons Margaret seemed to know an awful lot of Generals on an intimate basis, for example) but they went too over the top with it IMO. As for Radar...he simply regresses too much IMO. In the early seasons he smokes, drinks, fools around with nurses etc...typical twenty something guy, right? By the end of his tenure on the show his only concerns seem to be his animals and comic books, like a kid or something. I can't help but wonder if Gary Burghoff himself took issue with this: \"What are you guys doing with my character?\". Again, regarding \"Fallen Idol\", one of the themes of the episode is Radar's desire to \"become a man\"- I could almost imagine his little speech he gives Hawk and BJ at the beginning of the episode almost coming verbatim from a conversation between Burghoff and Alda behind the scenes.\n\nI'd reckon M*A*S*H had a few \"Very Special Episodes\" of its own...I'd almost be inclined to think that episodes like \"Sometimes You Hear The Bullet\", \"Abyssinia Henry\", and \"Fallen Idol\" (there are undoubtedly more) pioneered that particular \"genre\" of television show.\n\nNah\n\nThe sixth season of M*A*S*H aired Tuesdays at 9:00-9:30PM from September 20, 1977 to January 24, 1978 and Mondays at the same time from January 30 to March 27, 1978.\n\nCast\n\nActor Role\n\nAlan Alda Capt.
