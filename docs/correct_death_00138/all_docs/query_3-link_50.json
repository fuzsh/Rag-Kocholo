        "text": "\"Every girl loves a uniform.\" So goes the old saying. The adage is true, at least it was in the presidential campaign of 1852.\n\nThe Democratic candidate was more than just a blue-suited veteran of the recent war against Mexico. Franklin Pierce was a handsome officer whose chiselled chin and masculine looks made the fair sex swoon.\n\nWhigs believed victory in 1852 was a sure thing, as the young unknown Pierce would be easy pickings against their own venerable General Winfield Scott, under whom Pierce had served in the Mexican-American War.\n\nThe tried-and-true Whig Party formula of winning with a heroic general did not work in 1852 and on Election Day, Scott was defeated. The victorious Democrat Pierce may have looked like a Lancelot with his military background, but in his grey civilian mufti, he was just another \"empty suit.\"\n\nPierce, our 14th president, hailed from New Hampshire, the Granite State. His inner fiber, however, was more mush than mountain, his will sapped and weakened by wine and whiskey.\n\nHis early political career had seen him elected New Hampshire's speaker of the House. He may have been a big figure in New Hampshire politics, but Pierce was not fated to enjoy a happy presidency.\n\nIn January 1853, the Pierce family began its long train journey to the inauguration in Washington, D.C. His wife Jane Appleton Pierce, daughter of a Congregational minister, was full of foreboding. She never wanted her husband to run for president and her heart was not reconciled to it. Only heartache and woe awaited her in Washington.\n\nTragedy happened before they even reached Washington. Less than two months before the March Inauguration, her only son and youngest child, Bennie, was killed in a railroad accident. The grief-stricken Jane decided not to attend the inauguration.\n\nPierce was sworn in by Chief Justice Roger Taney. Without relying on notes, the new president delivered a lengthy 3,319-word address on a raw winter day, braving a strong northeasterly wind. The newspapers estimated a crowd of more than 80,000 gathered to hear him, but only l5,000 remained to the end.\n\nNever had a previous president manifested such little interest in executive action or congressional legislation. Secretary of State William Marcy, Treasury Secretary James Guthrie, Attorney General Caleb Cushing and other Cabinet heads remained at their posts for the entire four-year Pierce term, an extraordinary exception in American history.\n\nThe main milestones in the Pierce administration were ratification of Commodore Matthew Perry's treaty with Japan that opened the ports to trade, the Kansas-Nebraska Act permitting state option on slavery and the Ostend Manifesto which urged United States acquisition of Cuba from Spain. In none of these achievements was Pierce particularly involved, more of a bystander than anything else.\n\nUpon leaving the White House in March 1857, Pierce and his wife went back to his native New Hampshire, where he almost drowned himself with drink. When his wife Jane died in 1863, his old college friend from Bowdoin, novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, whom Pierce had helped appoint as a U.S. consul to enable him to continue his writing, accompanied him to a sanatorium in the White Mountains to help treat Pierce's alcoholism. There Hawthorne unexpectedly died and Pierce died in 1869 with no immediate survivors.\n\nIf Pierce was the first dark horse to ascend to the White House, he also recorded the dimmest record. He might be labeled a \"do-nothing,\" a delinquent president whose interest in executive obligations was egregiously indifferent. President Pierce was a failure. His wife Jane rarely made an appearance in the White House as First Lady and when she did, she always wore mourning clothes.\n\nOf all the presidents who completed a full term, Pierce is deservedly the least remembered. Nevertheless, this month's 213th anniversary of his birth in 1804 allows us to reflect on what he might have become under different circumstances.\n\nJames Humes, a former White House speechwriter, has authored several books on United States presidents, including his most recent work, \"Presidents and Their Pens: The Story of White House Speechwriters\" (Hamilton Books 2016)."
