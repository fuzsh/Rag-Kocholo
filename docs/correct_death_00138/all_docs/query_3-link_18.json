        "text": "Transcript\n\nFranklin Pierce took office as the 14th president of the United States in 1853, as the country grew increasingly divided over slavery. His attempts to satisfy both sides of the issue caused him to lose the support of his party.\n\nPierce was born in rural New Hampshire in 1804. At age 15 he entered Bowdoin College in Maine. While there, he developed a lifelong friendship with Nathaniel Hawthorne, who would become a renowned novelist. Pierce graduated in 1824 and began studying law.\n\nIn 1829 Pierce won election to the New Hampshire state legislature. Three years later he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He became a senator in 1837. Pierce’s time in Congress was rather unremarkable. In 1842 he resigned and returned to New Hampshire to practice law.\n\nWhen the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Pierce enlisted in the Army. He rose to the rank of brigadier general. After the war he became an influential member of the Democratic party in New Hampshire.\n\nAs the presidential election of 1852 neared, the Democratic National Convention could not agree on a candidate that would satisfy both the proslavery South and the abolitionist North. On the 49th ballot, the Democrats finally settled on Pierce. He was a northerner, but he opposed the abolitionist movement.\n\nPierce won the election in a landslide. But his victory was soon marred by tragedy. His family was involved in a train accident that killed his only surviving child. Two months later Pierce took the oath of office, still in a state of grief and exhaustion. He emphasized his weakness in his inaugural address.\n\nDuring his first year in office, Pierce settled the final borders of the continental United States through the Gadsden Purchase. In the purchase, the United States bought from Mexico the land that now comprises southern Arizona and southern New Mexico.\n\nThe main issue of Pierce’s presidency was slavery. In 1854 he signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which he hoped would satisfy both sides of the debate. The act repealed the Missouri Compromise, which prohibited slavery in the U.S. territories north of Missouri’s southern border. The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed the territories to decide the slavery question themselves. This led to violent clashes between pro- and antislavery advocates in Kansas. The conflict became known as “Bleeding Kansas.”\n\nThe Kansas-Nebraska Act turned many of President Pierce’s fellow Democrats against him. In 1856 the party refused Pierce’s bid for reelection. Instead they nominated James Buchanan, who went on to win the presidency.\n\nPierce left office in 1857 and returned to New Hampshire to practice law. Four years later the American Civil War broke out. Pierce supported the North while openly criticizing President Abraham Lincoln. When Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, an angry mob gathered at Pierce’s home. Pierce spent his final years in seclusion and died in 1869."
