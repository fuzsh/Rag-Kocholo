        "text": "A sign outside the gates of the Old North Cemetery announces the burial of the most New Hampshire native son within its fencing. The sign outlines the major accomplishments of Franklin Pierce:\n\nFRANKLIN PIERCE\n\n1804 – 1869\n\nFourteenth President of the United States\n\n(1853 -1857)\n\nLies buried in nearby Minot enclosure.\n\nNative son of New Hampshire,\n\nGraduate of Bowdoin College,\n\nLawyer, effective political leader,\n\nCongressman and U.S. Senator,\n\nMexican War veteran, courageous\n\nAdvocate of States’ rights,\n\nHe was popularly known as\n\n“Young Hickory of the Granite Hills.”\n\nWhile the sign outlines Pierce’s political accomplishments, there is nothing about his personal life. Franklin Pierce was born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire. He married Jane Appleton, the daughter of a Congregational minister. Jane and Franklin were nearly polar opposites. Franklin was outgoing and gregarious. Jane was shy and suffered from depression. Jane was pro-temperance and devoutly religious. Jane was from a family that belonged to the Whig party and the Pierces were Democrats. She eschewed the limelight, while Franklin thrived in it.\n\nTheir marriage and life together was punctuated with tragedy. Franklin and Jane had three sons. Franklin Pierce Junior, who was born in 1836, died just three days after his birth. Their second son, Frank Robert, born in 1839 and died four years later from typhus. Their third son, Benjamin, was killed in a tragic train accident two months before Pierce took office. The family was traveling when the train they were riding in overturned and their son, Benjamin, was killed.\n\nPierce took the office of the presidency exhausted and bereft.\n\nPierce served one term. His party did not re-nominate him. He returned to private life but did not ever give up his zest for politics. He stayed engaged but was not elected again to office. His wife, Jane, died in 1863. Franklin, a lifetime long heavy drinker, died in 1869 from cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nPresident Franklin Pierce and his wife, Jane, were buried in the Old North Cemetery, the oldest cemetery in the Concord, New Hampshire.\n\nThe gravestone for President Franklin Pierce, his wife, Jane, and two of his three children, Frank and Benjamin, is constructed of unpolished gray granite and sits in a semi-circle of neatly-tended flowers and plantings.\n\nThe central portion of the monument consists of a block sitting on a platform. A tall six-sided tapered column rises above the center block and is topped by a floriated or fleury cross, with a cloth draping it. The empty cross with drapery is known by many different names—Risen Cross, Resurrection Cross, Draped Cross, Shrouded Cross—and symbolizes atonement and redemption. The center of the floriated cross features a circle.\n\nOn either side are flat blocks topped with a thin ledge flanking the central and main portion of the monument. On the left side is the inscription:\n\nJANE M. APPLETON\n\nWIFE OF\n\nFRANKLIN PIERCE\n\nBORN MAR. 12. 1806\n\nDIED DEC. 2. 1863\n\nOn the middle portion of the monument is the following inscription:\n\nFRANKLIN PIERCE\n\nBORN NOV. 23. 1804\n\nDIED OCT. 8. 1869\n\n14TH PRESIDENT\n\nOF THE\n\nUNITED STATES\n\n1853 – 1857\n\nOn the right flank of the monument is the following inscription:\n\nTHEIR CHILDREN\n\nFRANK R. PIERCE\n\nBORN AUG. 27. 1839\n\nDIED NOV. 14. 1843\n\nBENJAMIN PIERCE\n\nBORN APR. 13. 1841\n\nDIED JAN. 6. 1853"
