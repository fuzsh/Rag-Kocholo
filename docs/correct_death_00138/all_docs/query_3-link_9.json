        "text": "Pierce’s only surviving son, Benjamin, is killed in a train wreck two months before Pierce assumes the presidency. Pierce’s wife, Jane Pierce, interprets Benjamin’s death as an indictment of Franklin’s presidency and becomes socially distant. (Click here for an 08/02/1853 letter from Jane Pierce discussing her grief.)\n\nInaugural Address. Pierce becomes the first and only President to state “I do solemnly affirm” while taking the oath of office, as the Constitution permits, rather than “do solemnly swear.”\n\nIssues Executive Order for plans to mourn and commemorate Vice President William R. King, who dies 45 days into office. Congress was forced to pass special legislation (10 Stat 180) allowing King to take the oath of office in Cuba, where he moved hoping to recover from tuberculosis. King died on 04/18/1853 at his home in Chestnut Hill, Alabama, the evening after returning home from Cuba.\n\nU.S. Minister to Mexico James Gadsden and Mexican President Antonio de Santa Anna sign what becomes known as the Gadsden Treaty, stipulating the purchase of 45,000 square miles south of the New Mexico territory for $15 million. The Senate later ratifies a treaty on April 25, 1854 reducing the deal to 29,670 square miles for $10 million. (Click HERE for more information about the Gadsden Treaty.)\n\nA group of Senators and Representatives publish “Appeal of the Independent Democrats to the People of the United States,” calling for opposition to the Kansas and Nebraska bill.\n\nThe Republican Party is founded in Ripon, Wisconsin following demonstrations sparked by the publication of “Appeal of the Independent Democrats” in various newspapers. A mass meeting “Under the Oaks” was later held in the outskirts of Jackson, Michigan on 06/06/1854, during the decline of the Whig Party. The new Republican Party is composed of former Whigs, Free-Soilers, and northern Democrats dismayed with the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and slavery’s potential expansion.\n\nCommadore Matthew C. Perry signs the Treaty of Kanagawa, the first treaty between Japan and the United States. The Treaty obtains two coaling ports for the United States, protects the rights of American whalers, and plants the seeds for a commercial treaty between the two nations in 1858. (Click HERE for more information about the Treaty of Kanagawa.)\n\nThe Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company is founded by Eli Thayer in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Later renamed the New England Emigrant Aid Company, the company was originally founded to transport antislavery settlers to Kansas Territory. The organization’s founding is a precursor to the violence experienced in the Bleeding Kansas conflict. (Click HERE for more information about the New England Emigrant Aid Society.)\n\nSigns the Kansas-Nebraska Act (10 Stat 277), repealing the 1820 Missouri Compromise and creating two new territories. The Act included a provision for popular sovereignty, where citizens of Nebraska and Kansas would decide whether to permit slavery in their territories. Proslavery and antislavery settlers poured into Kansas immediately following its enactment, hoping to influence the territory’s first election. The ensuing years of violent conflict became known as Bleeding Kansas. The Act would also become a major source of division within the Democratic Party, which helped pass the law in Congress. (Click HERE for more information about the Kansas-Nebraska Act.)\n\nAnthony Burns, a fugitive slave from Virginia, is arrested in Boston. There is a trial to determine whether Burns must be returned to his prior owners under the Fugitive Slave act of 1850. The judge orders Burns’s return, which occurred despite violent protest resulting in the death of a federal marshal. (Click HERE for more information about the life and capture of Anthony Burns.)\n\nBritish North America Governor General Lord Elgin and U.S. Secretary of State William Marcy sign the Canadian Reciprocity Treaty, a free trade agreement between the United States and Canada. The Treaty reduced import duties and protective tariffs on specific goods exchanged between the two countries.\n\nSigns Appropriations Bill (10 Stat 301) enabling the President to fulfill the amended purchase outlined in the Gadsden Treaty. The U.S. purchases 29,670 square miles of Mexican land for $10 million, later comprising parts of Arizona and New Mexico. The Treaty resolves tensions from the Mexican-American war and provides enough land for a southern transcontinental railroad. (Click HERE for more information about the Gadsden Treaty.)\n\nU.S. minister to Spain, Pierre Soule, writes the Ostend Manifesto, advising the United States to threaten to invade Cuba if Spain refuses to sell Cuba to the U.S. The document, also signed by future President James Buchanan, ruins U.S. hopes of Cuban annexation and leads to Soule’s resignation. (Click HERE for a pdf of the Ostend Manifesto.)\n\nThe “Know Nothing” Party, a nativist political party and movement, changes its official name from the Native American Party to the American Party. (Click HERE for more information about the Know Nothing Party.)\n\nThe Topeka Constitutional Convention meets in Topeka, Kansas and drafts the Topeka Constitution, banning slavery in Kansas. Free Staters organize the convention to counter the proslavery Kansas Territory Legislature formed through election fraud. Congress rejects the constitution and denies the request for admission to the Union.\n\nWakarusa War begins as part of \"Bleeding Kansas\" tensions between Free-Staters and pro-slavery militias. A peace treaty is signed by both sides to prevent violence and the destruction of Lawrence, Kansas. (Click HERE for more information about the Wakarusa War.)\n\nIssues Proclamation 66—Law and Order in the Territory of Kansas, commanding “all persons engaged in unlawful combinations against constituted authority of the Territory of Kansas or of the United States to disperse and retire peaceably. . . ”\n\nVetoes two bills. One appropriating funds to improve navigation on the Mississippi, and the second appropriating funds to deepen a river channel in Michigan.\n\nArgues that the Constitution does not give the General Government authority to carry out “internal improvements.” Both vetoes are overridden on 07/08/1856 (11 Stat 25, 11 Stat 26)\n\nRepresentative Preston Brooks viciously attacks Senator Charles Sumner with a cane in what becomes known as the Sumner-Brooks Affair. The attack comes three days after Sumner insults Senators Stephen Douglas and Andrew Butler in his “Crime Against Kansas” speech. The speech advocated for the admission of Kansas to the Union as a free state. (Click HERE for more information about the Sumner-Brooks Affair.)\n\nJohn Brown, five of his sons, and three additional associates murder 5 proslavery men in cabins along the Potawatomie Creek. The attack serves as Brown’s revenge for the sacking of Lawrence and attack on Senator Charles Sumner a few days prior. (Click HERE for more information about the Potawatomie Massacre.)\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is held in Cincinnati, Ohio. Pierce seeks re-election, but is denied by the Democratic Party due to his handling of the “Bleeding Kansas” conflict. The Democratic Party nominates James Buchanan and John C. Breckinridge for Vice President. Pierce would become the only active elected president to be denied renomination by his party for a second term.\n\nThe American Party, also known as the Know Nothing Party, nominates former President Millard Fillmore for President and Andrew J. Donelson for Vice President. At the convention, a group of antislavery delegates abruptly left in reaction to the proposal of a proslavery party platform.\n\nThe Battle of Osawatomie occurs between approximately 250 border ruffians and 40 Free-Staters led by John Brown. John W. Reid’s proslavery forces overwhelmed the Free-Staters and destroyed Osawatomie. The engagement marks another instance of violence in the Bleeding Kansas conflict. (Click HERE for more information about the Battle of Osawatomie.)\n\nState of Disunion Convention is held in Worcester, Massachusetts to discuss the prospect of a peaceful separation of Northern and Southern States. (Click HERE for the official Proceedings of the State of Disunion Convention.)"
