        "text": "You know Mount Vernon. You know Monticello. But have you heard of the Pierce Manse? Yes, New Hampshire has produced a former President, Franklin Pierce, and his home is here in Concord.\n\nFranklin Pierce, the only President of the United States of America to hail from the Granite State, was elected in 1852. Although Pierce’s administration was turbulent, and he failed to speak out against slavery at a crucial time in our country’s history, his story reveals an important escalation of tensions between the North and South, leading up to Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860. During his time as President, Pierce also established the office of the United States Attorney General, improved relations with Canada and Japan, and contributed to the theft of land from native peoples—expanding U.S. borders into Kansas and Nebraska.\n\nThe President’s Home\n\nLocated at 14 Horseshoe Pond Lane in Concord, the Pierce Manse is the home of the former President. From May to October, families and school groups go on tours of the Manse to relive the history and life of President Pierce, who lived here before moving to the White House. In addition to tour groups, the Manse also hosts events such as performances by the United States Army Band and lectures by scholars and historians.\n\nAlthough the Manse’s current location is not the original location of the Manse, it is still an important piece of history not just to Concord residents or New Hampshire residents, but to all citizens of the United States of America. The Pierce Brigade, a nonprofit that oversees the Manse, is responsible for its continued preservation, including saving it from demolition in 1971.\n\nVisitor information: piercemanse.org\n\nFranklin Pierce Homestead\n\nThis beautiful historic site served as the childhood home of Franklin Pierce until his marriage in 1834. Explore the vast ballroom, eat a picnic on the lawn, and study historic artifacts when you visit.\n\nVisitor information: nhstateparks.org/find-parks-trails/franklin-pierce-homestead-historic-site\n\nFranklin Pierce’s Gravesite\n\nYou can also visit Pierce’s gravesite at the Old North Cemetery at 141 North State Street in Concord. November 21 is an especially fitting time to visit, as that is not only the President’s birthday, but also the day of a wreath-laying ceremony. After the ceremony, there is a reception at the Manse.\n\nStatue and New Hampshire State House\n\nIt’s also worth a trip to see the statue of Pierce in New Hampshire near the State House (not officially on the State House Lawn). While you’re there, make sure you explore this historic New Hampshire site. Erected in 1914, the idea of such a statue had existed in the New Hampshire State Legislature since 1879. Daniel Chester French commissioned a New York sculptor to create this iconic statue. The side of the statue also features engravings listing Pierce’s accomplishments in the White House and beyond."
