Using hands-on objects, primary source documents, and visual clues in the historic house, visitors will learn about what life was like in the mid-19th century for Franklin Pierce, his wife Jane, and their two sons.\n\nThe Manse is owned and operated by the volunteer Pierce Brigade, whose mission is to preserve the home and legacy of New Hampshireâ€™s only president."
