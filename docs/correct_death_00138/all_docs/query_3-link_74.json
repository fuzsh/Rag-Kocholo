His handling of the tensions between North and South during this time are widely criticized as well.\n\nBenjamin, Pierce’s third and only surviving child, died in a railroad accident two months before his father’s inauguration.\n\nBecause of religious considerations Pierce affirmed rather than swore the Presidential oath of office.\n\nPierce gave his 3,319-word inaugural address from memory, without the aid of notes.\n\nPierce was the only President to have no turnover in his cabinet.\n\nPierce was the only elected President who sought but did not win his party’s nomination for a second term.\n\nDuring his second year at Bowdoin College in Maine, Pierce had the lowest grades out of anyone in his class. He changed his study habits, and graduated third in his class. Among his classmates were Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\n\nFranklin Pierce was the first President to have a Christmas tree in the White House.\n\nHe installed the first central-heating system and the first bathroom with hot and cold water in the White House.\n\nPierce was an avid fisherman.\n\nPierce died of cirrhosis of the liver as a result of years of heavy drinking.\n\nHis father, Benjamin Pierce held the post of the Governor of New Hampshire from 1827-28.\n\nPrevious President: Millard Fillmore | Next President: James Buchanan\n\n©1996-2008.
