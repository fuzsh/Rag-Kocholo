        "text": "Born in 1804 in New Hampshire, Franklin Pierce was one of eight children to Benjamin Pierce, a hero of the American Revolutionary War, and Anna Pierce. Excelling in education, Pierce attended Bowdoin College by age 15. By 1824 he graduated fifth in his class.\n\nFig. 1 - A photograph portrait of Franklin Pierce by Matthew Brady, 1856\n\nPierce had a gift for public speaking that was refined in college and pushed him to a career in politics. By 1829 he was elected to the New Hampshire legislature and, with the help of his Father as governor, was made Speaker of the House by 1831. Pierce was often sent to Washington, D.C. as a state legislator with his family connections. Though he found life in Washington lonely and boring, he served as a U.S. Representative for New Hampshire from 1833 to 1837 and a Senator from 1837 to 1842.\n\nWhile in Washington, Pierce had issues with alcohol and was eventually convinced by his wife to resign as Senator, abstain from alcohol, and begin practice as a lawyer. This settled life changed with the outbreak of the Mexican American War in 1846. Pierce enlisted as a private and, within a year, had earned the rank of Brigadier General under the command of Winfield Scott and invaded Mexico. In 1847, Pierce suffered an injury after being thrown from his horse and returned home.\n\nBy 1852, Pierce had become a prominent member of the Democratic party in New Hampshire and a possible candidate for the Democratic nomination for President. (His presidency is discussed in detail below.)\n\nAfter his presidency, Pierce retired to New Hampshire. During the Civil War, he became a vocal advocate of the southern cause in the north. His views pushed him into obscurity, and he soon turned to alcohol in his later years.\n\nFranklin Pierce died on October 8, 1869.\n\nFranklin Pierce Presidency: Significance\n\nLike most presidential administrations in the mid-1800s leading up to 1860, Pierce’s presidency is defined by his actions on the issue of slavery and how those actions either postponed or increased the likelihood of civil war. Under that lens, the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act ignited violent actions over slavery and fanned the passions of both northern abolitionists and pro-slavery southerners. This division is evident through the electoral college changes between 1853 and 1857. In the election of 1852, Pierce carried almost all the northern states. With the fallout of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, in the election of 1856 between James Buchanan, Republican John Fremont, and Whig Millard Fillmore, the Democrats lost all the northern states, emphasizing the divisiveness of the act and showing the actual division between the nation over the issue of slavery.\n\nIn addition, the actions of the Democratic party during Pierce’s administration led directly to the division and fall of the Whig Party and the rise of the Republican Party. In his term, the Democrats saw the demise of their fiercest political rivals and the birth of the party that would nominate Abraham Lincoln in 1860.\n\nPresident Franklin Pierce - Key takeaways\n\nFranklin Pierce was born in New Hampshire in 1804, was elected President in 1852, and died in 1869.\n\nAs a pro-slavery Northern Democrat, the party worked to gain the Northern pro-slavery vote.\n\nRunning against his former commanding officer, Winfield Scott, the Whig Party nominee, Pierce won with 254 electoral votes to Scott’s 42.\n\nSeveral notable events occurred during the Pierce Administration: The Gadsden Purchase, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and \"bleeding Kansas.\"\n\nThe passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act ignited violent actions over slavery and sparked passions of both Northern abolitionists and pro-slavery Southerners.\n\nThe actions of the Democratic party during Pierce’s administration led to the division and fall of the Whig Party and the rise of the Republican Party.\n\nDuring Pierce's term, Democrats saw the demise of their fiercest political rivals and the birth of the party that would nominate Abraham Lincoln in 1860."
