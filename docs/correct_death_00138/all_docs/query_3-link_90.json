        "text": "For thirty years after Franklin Pierce's death, the ex-president's reputation remained low in the estimation of historians and the public. Most saw Pierce and his successor James Buchanan as primary culprits in the sectional discord leading to the Civil War. Between 1900 and 1915, however, Pierce's reputation improved, with the sectional healing represented by Blue-Gray reunions on former battlefields like Gettysburg and the election of only the second Democratic president since the war, Woodrow Wilson. This process of healing was particularly difficult in Pierce's home state of New Hampshire. In a classic case of contested memory, the Grand Army of the Republic repeatedly stymied Democratic attempts to raise a statue to the state's only president and criticized Pierce as a traitor and Confederate sympathizer. The Democrats, however, took over the New Hampshire governor's chair in 1913, and the legislature voted to honor Pierce with a statue. In that small early twentieth-century window, Franklin Pierce became a beneficiary of hard-earned sectional reconciliation.\n\n3 Brown, Dona, Inventing New England: Regional Tourism in the Nineteenth Century (Washington, 1995), 135–42, 183–89Google Scholar; Lindgren, James M., Preserving Historic New England: Preservation, Progressivism, and the Remaking of Memory (New York, 1995), 6, 114Google Scholar; for similar political battles over public commemoration of prominent nineteenth-century Democrats, Rosenberger, Homer T., “Two Monuments for the Fifteenth President of the United States,” Journal of the Lancaster County Historical Society 78 (1974): 29–48Google Scholar; and Bogart, Michele H., “The Ordinary Hero Monument in Greater New York: Samuel J.
