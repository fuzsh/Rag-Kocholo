        "text": "Pierce entered the New Hampshire legislature in 1829. In 1832 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. From 1837 to 1842 he served in the Senate. Pierce then practiced law in Concord, New Hampshire. During the Mexican-American War (1846–48) he served briefly as an officer.\n\nBy the 1850s both major political parties, the Democrats and the Whigs, were divided over the issue of slavery. In 1852 no Democrat could win enough support to become the party’s presidential candidate. The Democrats eventually compromised by choosing Pierce. Pierce defeated General Winfield Scott in the election.\n\nAs president, Pierce focused on expanding U.S. territory. In 1853 he unsuccessfully tried to buy Cuba from Spain. In the same year, however, the United States bought almost 30,000 square miles (78,000 square kilometers) of land from Mexico in a deal called the Gadsden Purchase.\n\nPierce tried to satisfy both sides of the slavery debate. He appointed Northerners and Southerners to government posts. He also signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854. The act allowed the voters in the territories of Kansas and Nebraska to decide whether to allow slavery there. Violent clashes broke out between proslavery and antislavery settlers in Kansas.\n\nBecause of the situation in Kansas, the Democrats rejected Pierce. In 1856 they chose James Buchanan, not Pierce, to run for president. Pierce retired to Concord to practice law. He died there on October 8, 1869."
