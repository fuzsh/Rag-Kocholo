        "meta_description": "Franklin Pierce, 14th president of the United States, was born in a log cabin in 1804, in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, at a site that is now under the waters of a reservoir called Lake Franklin Pierce. His father was a prominent citizen who served with George Washington during the Revolutionary War, and later became a government surveyor dispatched to the region. He ended up owning several hundred acres here (not all of which are under the lake). When Franklin Pierce was born, the seventh of nine children, the cabin was just their temporary home while they waited for their large house in town to be finished. He was a log cabin occupant for just a few weeks of his infancy. The larger house is nearby is restored and is a museum and memorial to the President.",
