Dr. DiPietro wanted to give young people better access to colleges, and he believed that everybody deserved a chance to succeed.\n\n\"I founded Franklin Pierce College in 1962, on the assumption that a liberal arts college that emphasized the process of learning how to learn would meet the educational needs of the times.…I envisioned that Franklin Pierce College would provide a relevant living experience for those students who wanted to learn how to learn and learn how to live.\"\n\nDiPietro had the vision and drive that would breathe life into the institution and set it on a successful trajectory to its current position of having five satellite campuses and a successful online program.
