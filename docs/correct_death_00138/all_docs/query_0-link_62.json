        "text": "Typical school tours last one hour and can be tailored to fit specific learning objectives and grade levels. We can accommodate 50 students at a time, separated into groups of about 12 students each. Each group starts the guided tour in a different room in the house.\n\nIf your group is larger, we can arrange an additional program in our meeting room and rotate the students in that group with those touring the house. Inside space is available for students to eat their bag lunches.\n\nPrograms can include:\n\nNew Hampshire and the Presidency: The Life and Times of Franklin Pierce\n\nThrough a guided tour of his home, learn about Franklin Pierce, the 14th President of the United States and the only New Hampshire resident to be elected to the White House. Learn about his military service, his involvement in state and national politics before his election to President, and his Presidential accomplishments.\n\nLife of an American Family in the 1840's\n\nTake a step back in time with a visit to the historic home of New Hampshireâ€™s only President, Franklin Pierce and his family. The Pierce family occupied this 19th century Greek Revival home from 1842-1848. Through exhibits, hands on objects, visual clues and guided tours of the historic home, visitors will learn about the domestic life of this pre-Civil War American family.\n\nCost is $5 per student, $8 per adult, with one adult free for every 10 students. There is free on street parking, as well as a pull out space for buses."
