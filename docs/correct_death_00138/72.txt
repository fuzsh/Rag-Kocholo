I captured the simple beauty of our 14th president standing in front of our golden New Hampshire State House dome on a recent cold January morning.

With the only sound the falling sleet early this morning on a deserted Main Street, I reflected back to the dedication of this statue on Nov. 25, 1914.

Franklin Pierce died on Oct. 8, 1869, in a rented home on South Main Street. During his last hours and near death, he asked his Irish housekeeper to join him. He told her death was near and he did not want to die alone. He reached out and held her hand until his passing.

This statue was designed and created by sculptor Augustus Lukeman from bronze and Concord granite. It weighs 2,230 pounds and was dedicated with a formal ceremony that fall day in 1914. The Nevers Band played a tribute and many dignitaries attended. The statue was then unveiled by Miss Susan Pierce, grandniece to President Franklin Pierce. Every state that produces a president is honored with a gold dome, for this we are grateful to our 14th president.
