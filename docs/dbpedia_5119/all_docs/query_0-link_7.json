        "text": "Nothing remained today but to remove all pebbles and other noxious substances from the Hampton Park playing field…\n\n…The cause of all this commotion in The Citadel camp, the Newberry Indians, are expected to reach Charleston tonight, and they will need no urging to remain over for the game tomorrow, for if the intentions laid at their door are correct, they expect to give the local cadets a bad time, and return to Newberry with an attractive Citadel defeat towing behind them. In short, the Lutherans are not coming here for a trouncing or even a tie game, but are keenly desirous of utterly squelching their hardy opponents.\n\nCoach Rogers’ pupils are not worrying about the strength of the enemy, but are striving to increase their own prowess, for they haven’t even a tiny intention of submitting to any drubbing by those pretentious Newberrians, comparative upstarts in the pigskin world. The latter’s work this season has been enough to cause a scare, but the cadets have faced danger before now, and expect to walk over the top of their guests if they insist on staying in their way.\n\n– The Charleston Evening Post, Friday, November 6, 1914\n\nBattling bitterly The Citadel barely nosed out a victory over the Newberry Indians in one of the fiercest contests on a Charleston gridiron, the final score being The Citadel 14, Newberry 13. The contest was a terrific struggle between the two teams, which were as nearly evenly matched as two elevens could be.\n\nThe individual honors of the afternoon were about evenly divided between Weeks of the Bull Dogs, and MacLean of the Indians. Sheppard roamed all over the field and smothered play after play of the Lutherans. Baker, Renken, and Ashbaugh showed considerable fondness in clinging on to the aerial messages of MacLean.\n\n…In the last few minutes of play, with the Cadets one point in the lead, the play was fast, sharp, and hard, every inch being stubbornly contested. Ashbaugh made two attempts at field goals. The first was wide, but the second, a beautiful kick of about 45 yards, missed the post by about a foot. It was Newberry’s last chance.\n\nWeeks was again the backbone of the Cadets and almost individually won the game. His offensive work was superb, his defensive playing great, and his grit and nerve some of the best ever shown at Hampton Park. Knocked out of the game with a bum shoulder, he came back and literally played on his nerve. It was Weeks who made one of the touchdowns and Weeks who kicked both goals.\n\nMacLean, although weighing about 150 pounds, piloted his team in an able manner. His passing of the ball, tackling, and running in the open field stamps him as the best quarter in the State. Bumped and hammered about, he was as cool as the proverbial cucumber and tossed the pigskin with unerring accuracy on all the forward passes.\n\n– The Sunday News, November 8, 1914\n\n—\n\nThe Citadel vs. Newberry, to be played at historic Johnson Hagood Stadium, with kickoff at 6:00 pm ET on September 2, 2017.\n\nThe game will be televised by 7 Communications, and streamed on ESPN3.com. Kendall Lewis will handle play-by-play, while former Bulldogs linebacker James Riley supplies the analysis. Erin Summers will report from the sidelines.\n\nThe contest can be heard on radio via the various affiliates of The Citadel Sports Network. WQNT-1450 AM [audio link], originating in Charleston, will be the flagship station.\n\nMike Legg (the “Voice of the Bulldogs”) will call the action alongside analyst Lee Glaze. The sideline reporter on the radio broadcasts is Jay Harper.\n\n—\n\nThe Citadel Sports Network — 2017 Affiliates\n\nCharleston: WQNT 1450AM/92.1 FM/102.1 FM (Flagship)\n\nColumbia: WQXL 1470AM/95.9FM\n\nGreenville: WLFJ 92.9FM/660AM\n\nSumter: WDXY 1240AM/105.9FM\n\n—\n\nAccording to the Southern Conference, the following television stations/cable outlets will be carrying the game:\n\nWCIV-3 — Charleston, SC (this is the “MeTV” subchannel)\n\nWYFF-2 — Greenville, SC (this is the “This” subchannel)\n\nWITN-2 — Greenville, NC (this it the “MyTV” subchannel)\n\nWILM — Wilmington, NC (could be a “joined in progress” situation)\n\nWDWW- 7 — Atlanta, GA (yes, digital subchannel 7)\n\nWHKY — Charlotte, NC\n\nCox Cable — Roanoke, VA\n\nCox Cable — Norfolk, VA\n\nWFXB-4 — Myrtle Beach, SC (digital subchannel 4)\n\nKPMF — Memphis, TN\n\nNow, a warning. It is possible, if not likely, that all of the stations that carry the matchup will have it on a digital subchannel. For instance, the game will be seen in Charleston on WCIV’s “MeTV” subchannel — not “regular” WCIV or even “MyTV” WCIV, but WCIV-DT3.\n\nIf you live in one of the areas listed above and you don’t get ESPN3, turn on your TV at 6pm, and if the game isn’t on the listed channel, try the subchannels for each of these stations before giving up. Then and only then should you throw your remote control device into a nearby lake.\n\nNewberry’s website states that the game will also be televised in Raleigh and Greensboro. We shall see. If it is, it may be on a subchannel for one of the CW affiliates in each of those cities.\n\nIf you live in Macon, you apparently will able to watch the game on WMUB, Mercer’s student TV station. MASN (a mid-Atlantic sports network) is also listed by Newberry as carrying the contest, but I suspect that is on a tape-delay basis.\n\nMy apologies if anyone is confused by any or all of that information. In my defense, I’m probably more confused than anyone else…\n\n—\n\nA few of my recent posts revolving around football, including the upcoming season for The Citadel:\n\nI broke down 2016’s conference statistics, including (but not limited to) 4th-down decisions, run/pass tendencies, and…the coin toss\n\nIn concert with the above statistically-oriented post, I took a look at select “advanced stats” from last season\n\nUpdated to reference the 2016 numbers, I produced my latest of many (perhaps too many) posts on attendance at Johnson Hagood Stadium\n\nI broke down the SoCon non-conference slate for this year for each school\n\nAnother scheduling-related post: what teams will schools face both before and after facing The Citadel?\n\n—\n\nLinks of interest:\n\n– Season preview from The Post and Courier\n\n– SoCon preview from The Post and Courier\n\n– STATS SoCon preview (The Citadel is picked to finish third)\n\n– College Sports Madness preview of the Bulldogs (The Citadel is picked to finish fourth in the SoCon)\n\n– SoConSports.com preview of The Citadel\n\n– SoCon media and coaches’ preseason polls (The Citadel is picked to finish second in both polls)\n\n– The Citadel: Quick Facts\n\n– Game notes from The Citadel and Newberry\n\n– SoCon weekly release\n\n– South Atlantic Conference weekly release\n\n– Kailik Williams counts his blessings\n\n– Tyler Davis is an aging veteran\n\n– Dominique Allen is profiled in the Savannah Morning News\n\n– Bulldogs from the Houston area are keeping an eye on Hurricane Harvey\n\n– Freshmen have to be ready to play on Saturday\n\n– FCS Coaches’ poll (The Citadel opens the season ranked #12)\n\n– STATS FCS poll (The Citadel opens the season ranked #16)\n\n– Brent Thompson at The Citadel’s Media Day (video)\n\n– Brent Thompson has a brief conversation with Phil Kornblut (8/18) on SportsTalk (audio)\n\n– Brent Thompson’s 8/29 press conference, including comments from Dominique Allen and Myles Pierce (video)\n\n– Brent Thompson’s 8/30 radio show (video)\n\n– Newberry season preview from The Post and Courier\n\n– Interview (8/17) of Newberry head coach Todd Knight on WKNT-FM 107.5 in Columbia (audio)\n\n– Interview (8/3) of Newberry head coach Todd Knight on ESPN Upstate [begins at 9:45 mark] (audio)\n\n– Newberry picked to repeat as South Atlantic Conference champions\n\n– Seven players from Newberry received preseason first-team all-SAC recognition\n\n– Newberry hopes to spring the upset; this clip includes the much-discussed “The Citadel is arguably the second-best team in South Carolina” comment (video)\n\n– This article in The Post and Courier includes the two-deep for both schools\n\n—\n\nIt’s time for football!\n\nFOOTBALL!\n\nFOOTBALL!!\n\nFOOTBALL!!!\n\n—\n\nThe Citadel has won 19 games and consecutive SoCon titles over the last two years. The upcoming gridiron campaign has been highly anticipated by Bulldog supporters, but there are on-field questions that must be answered, and in a decidedly positive manner, if The Citadel is to win the league and advance to postseason play for a third straight season.\n\nThere is also the issue of Johnson Hagood Stadium — or more precisely, what is left of Johnson Hagood Stadium:\n\nThe east side of Johnson Hagood Stadium has been reduced to piles of rubble as demolition work at the home of Citadel football continues.\n\nThe east side of the stadium contained about 9,300 seats, and demolition of the aging structure was approved by the city’s Board of Architectural Review in February.\n\nOn [August 6], The Citadel’s Board of Visitors approved a plan that would add 3,800 seats to the east side of the stadium, which was demolished earlier this year. The plan also calls for about 40,000 square feet of “office, education and/or residential space” on the east side.\n\nThe motion, approved unanimously by the BOV, requests that The Citadel Real Estate Foundation “develop detailed specifications, pricing and recommendations to finance and fund the cost of the new East Side facility” and update the board at its September meeting…\n\n…The new plan also includes possible future addition of 2,400 seats on the east side, if needed. The Citadel averaged 12,987 fans for five games at Johnson Hagood in 2016, when the Bulldogs went 10-2 and won a second straight Southern Conference title.\n\nThe goal is to have the “new” East stands ready to go in time for the 2019 season. (If anything, that needs to be a requirement.)\n\nThere will be temporary bleachers on that side for this season, but they won’t be in place until The Citadel plays Mercer on October 7. Thus, for the home games against Newberry and Presbyterian, only the West stands will have seating, and the stadium capacity will be 11,700 (well, not counting the beer garden — more on that later).\n\nThe lack of seating isn’t great, but at least things appear to be moving forward. Of course, there is still the question of funding.\n\n—\n\nThe non-conference football schedule for The Citadel is now set through the 2020 season.\n\n2017: Newberry, Presbyterian, at Clemson\n\n2018: Charleston Southern, at Towson, at Alabama\n\n2019: Towson, Charleston Southern, at Elon, at Georgia Tech (12-game season)\n\n2020: Elon, Charleston Southern, at Clemson\n\nAs a result, Newberry is the last D-2 school the Bulldogs will meet on the gridiron until at least the 2021 season.\n\nThe Citadel released its complete 2018 schedule last Thursday. There will be five home games next season, while the 2019 and 2020 seasons will have six home contests each.\n\nBy 2019 the “new” East stands will hopefully be ready to go. I don’t have any problem with only having five home games next year, given the stadium situation. Establishing home-and-home series with Towson and Elon in order to ensure six home games in the following two seasons was a good move by Jim Senter.\n\n—\n\nThe Citadel’s new instant replay system for officials got a run-through during Saturday’s scrimmage. There are new goal-line cameras at each end of the field as part of the new system. The Citadel and Mercer will be the only SoCon teams with replay capability for referees this season.\n\nReplay review will be in effect for every home game this season, including Saturday’s matchup with Newberry. Conversely, none of the Bulldogs’ road games will feature a replay review system, with the exception of the game at Clemson.\n\nThe league will not require teams to have replay review at their respective home facilities until 2019. Essentially, conference games will be played under different rules, depending on the location of the game. That strikes me as problematic at best.\n\n—\n\nLast week, The Citadel announced that it would be selling beer at home football games this season:\n\nBeer sales will be limited to a 500-person “beer garden” tent inside Johnson Hagood Stadium.\n\nThe tent will be located in the southeast corner of the stadium, where aging stands were demolished this summer. There will be a three-beer limit per patron, and Citadel cadets of legal age (21) will not be able to buy beer in the tent…\n\n…The beer garden will feature two TVs for fans to watch games, and bartenders to serve beer.\n\nA friend of mine suggested that in addition to setting up a beer garden, The Citadel should establish a separate entry fee for the entire section, and incorporate food trucks into the mix. I like that idea.\n\nI’m more of a “watching the game with a great deal of intensity” fan than a “casually downing a beer or two while eating a burrito and occasionally glancing at the field” fan, but I understand that the school has to appeal to a wide variety of supporters. In a way, this is an effort to bring part of the tailgating scene into the stadium.\n\nBeer sales or no beer sales, hopefully Johnson Hagood Stadium will be packed with fans when Newberry comes to town on Saturday. Speaking of Newberry…\n\n—\n\nThe Lutheran intellectual tradition creatively engages the dialectic tensions inherent in the dynamic nature of human life.\n\n– Newberry College website\n\n—\n\nNewberry video from 2016:\n\n– Highlights package\n\n– Highlights of Newberry’s 29-28 victory over North Greenville\n\n– Most of the first three quarters of Newberry’s 37-10 win over Tusculum\n\n– Highlights of Newberry’s 34-19 victory over Carson-Newman\n\n– Highlights of Newberry’s 27-22 win over Wingate\n\nYou can also watch video replays of Newberry’s 2016 home games — for instance, the Wolves’ 53-14 demolition of Lenoir-Rhyne: Link\n\n—\n\nStatistics of note for Newberry’s 2016 season (all 12 games):\n\nNewberry Opponents Points/game 36.3 20.1 Rushing yardage 1926 1794 Yards/rush 4.13 3.82 Rush TDs 29 12 Passing yardage 3536 1999 Comp-Att-Int 287-423-16 158-330-13 Average/pass att 8.4 6.1 Passing TDs 30 18 Total offense 5462 3793 Total plays 889 800 Yards/play 6.1 4.7 Fumbles/lost 19/9 12/5 Penalties-pen yds 91-795 95-858 Pen yards/game 66.2 71.5 Net punt average 35.5 33.9 Time of poss/game 30:27 29:33 3rd-down conv 78/163 53/171 3rd-down conv % 47.9% 31.0% Sacks by-yards 34-211 20-128 Red Zone TD% (47-63) 74.6% (18-34) 52.9%\n\nNewberry finished 29th in D-2 in scoring offense, and 22nd in scoring defense. NC was 35th nationally in offensive yards per play and 25th in yards allowed per play.\n\nThe Wolves were 21st nationally in both offensive and defensive pass efficiency. Newberry’s pass completion rate of 67.8% was fourth-best in the division.\n\nAnother category Newberry fared well in was 3rd down conversion rate, both offensively (16th in D-2) and defensively (24th).\n\nThe Wolves rolled up some very impressive total offense numbers, including a 729-yard effort against Lenoir-Rhyne.\n\nOn special teams, Newberry finished 13th nationally in kick return defense and topped the division in punt return defense, allowing a total of 1 net punt return yard for the season. No, that is not a typo.\n\nI’m guessing that the lack of punt return yardage is based on a coaching philosophy of simply not giving an opponent any chance of returning a punt. If so, it certainly worked in 2016.\n\nOn the other hand, the strategy must not have always been employed in previous years, as Newberry’s yearly total punt return yardage allowed has yo-yoed from 35 to 97 to 212 to 1 in the past four seasons.\n\n—\n\nLast season, Newberry’s pass-run ratio was very close to 50-50. The Wolves threw 423 passes while being sacked 20 times, for a total of 443 assumed passing plays, while rushing 446 times (excluding sacks). Obviously, some plays that were would-be passes turned into runs.\n\nDespite the even distribution of rushes and passes, almost 65% of the Wolves’ total offense came through the air. Newberry averaged more than twice as many yards per passing play as by rushing attempt.\n\nMany of the players responsible for that production are gone, including last year’s starting quarterback, lead running back, and two quality wide receivers (one of whom operated at times as a “wildcat” QB). The Wolves also lost two starters on the offensive line, the left tackle and left guard.\n\nThe starting quarterback this season for Newberry will be Nick Jones (6’0″, 220 lbs.). A redshirt sophomore from Florence, Jones appeared in six games last season, starting late in the season against Wingate when regular QB Raleigh Yeldell was suspended.\n\nIn the game versus Wingate, Jones was 16-21 passing for 242 yards and two touchdowns, but he also threw three interceptions and was sacked three times.\n\nDuring the spring, the Newberry coaching staff moved reserve wideout Darius Clark (6’1″, 205 lbs.) to tailback. At the SAC Media Day, Todd Knight suggested that the junior “could be poised for a breakout season”. Clark is a product of St. John’s High School. He also served as a kick returner last season.\n\nAverage size of Newberry’s projected starters on the offensive line, as per the school’s 8/25 two-deep: 6’2″, 297 lbs. Four of the five listed starters weigh 300+ lbs.\n\nStarting center Dakota Mozingo (6’0″, 260 lbs.), a Rock Hill native, was a preseason SAC all-conference pick. Fellow senior Austin Turner (6’3″, 320 lbs.) was a second-team selection. Turner, a senior from Lexington, is the Wolves’ right guard.\n\nTyler Anderson (6’3″, 300 lbs.) started five games last season for Newberry. The redshirt sophomore was a preseason second-team All-SAC choice and is slated to start at left tackle this year.\n\nOn the other side of the line is none other than Tyler’s twin brother, Austin Anderson (also 6’3″, 300 lbs.). The brothers went to Wren High School.\n\nLeft guard Wade Rouse (6’1″, 305 lbs.) is a redshirt freshman who went to West Ashley High School in Charleston, where he also threw the shotput and discus for the track team.\n\nBackup right tackle Sam Hall (6’2″, 260 lbs.) was named a first-team Academic All-American at the end of last season. The biology major is a senior from Conway.\n\nMarkell Castle (5’8″, 165 lbs.) is a slot receiver who caught 67 passes last year for 976 yards and seven touchdowns. A case could be made that the junior from York is Newberry’s best returning player.\n\nYou can bet that the Bulldogs will be paying attention to #13 on Saturday, especially after watching video like this: Link\n\nAnother 5’9″ wideout, J.T. Waters (listed at 175 lbs.) is holding down the “W” receiving spot on the Wolves’ two-deep. The junior has seven career receptions. Waters went to Palmetto Christian Academy in Mt. Pleasant, where he put up big numbers as a quarterback at the small school.\n\nTight end Baptiste Staggers (6’4″, 230 lbs.), like Mozingo and Castle, was named to the preseason first team SAC all-conference team. Unlike those two players, however, Staggers (who went to Fort Dorchester High School) may be challenged for playing time this fall.\n\nDuring an appearance on WYRD (ESPN Upstate) earlier this month, Todd Knight stated that “we’ve got a really good tight end in Baptiste Staggers who I think is the best tight end in the league, [but] we’ve got a kid who transferred in here, who’s pushing him to the point where he’s almost beating him out — so we’re probably looking at playing a lot of two tight end sets this year, which we’ve never done before, but we’ve got to put the best 11 out there.”\n\nKnight was presumably referring to 6’7″, 250 lb. junior Sean Smith, a transfer from Middle Tennessee State. As a senior at Summerville High School, Smith was rated as a 3-star prospect by Scout.com and received offers from Georgia State and Florida Atlantic, as well as MTSU.\n\n—\n\nNewberry returns most of its starting defense from last season, including its three leading tacklers, all of whom were preseason all-league choices.\n\nJamarcus Henderson (5’10”, 230 lbs.) was a destructive force last season at defensive end. The second-team All-American had 22 tackles for loss, including 9 1/2 sacks.\n\nNow a redshirt junior, Henderson was a star at Union County High School, where he played for former South Carolina quarterback Steve Taneyhill. He was named the Spartanburg Herald Journal‘s defensive player of the year as a senior, despite playing for a 2-8 team.\n\nBackup DE Keito Jordon started three games as a freshman at Hampton in 2014. Newberry’s roster lists the Hopkins resident as a sophomore.\n\nDefensive tackle Josh Spigner (6’0″, 265 lbs.) is a senior who went to Ashley Ridge High School in Summerville. He started one game last season for the Wolves.\n\nInside linebacker Joe Blue (5’10”, 225 lbs.) is a junior from Dillon. Last year, Blue led Newberry in tackles with 91, including 68 solo stops.\n\nWill Elm (6’3″, 215 lbs.) finished third on the team in tackles, behind Henderson and Blue. Elm is a senior from Irmo.\n\nElm’s fellow outside linebacker, Rameak Smith (6’3″, 195 lbs.) recorded 48 tackles last year. Defensive back LaQuan White (6’1″, 185 lbs.) only started three games last season, but led the Wolves in interceptions, with four (against Catawba, he returned one pick for 55 yards). Smith and White both went to Woodland High School in Ridgeville.\n\nDevin Dexter, a 6’0″, 250 lb. “true” freshman from Byrnes High School, may be another Newberry defender to watch, despite not being listed on the two-deep. One veteran observer of the S.C. high school scene told me that Dexter, a defensive lineman, has a “high motor” and is very strong.\n\nLast year, he was the Spartanburg Herald-Journal‘s defensive player of the year, just as Henderson was in 2013. Dexter also played in the North-South All-Star game at the end of last season.\n\n—\n\nShea Rodgers (6’0″, 175 lbs.), a redshirt sophomore from Indian Land, handled most of the placekicking, punting, and kickoff duties for Newberry last season. He has been named to the watch list for the Fred Mitchell award.\n\nRodgers only attempted five field goals, but made them all, with a long of 32 yards. He was 42-48 on PAT attempts. Rodgers was a second-team All-SAC preseason selection.\n\nThe kicker-holder duo is an all-Indian Land affair, as junior holder Manny McCord (5’11”, 185 lbs.) and Rodgers were high school classmates. McCord is also a reserve wide receiver.\n\nPerry Able (5’11”, 170 lbs.), a Newberry native, will return as the Wolves’ long snapper.\n\nAs mentioned above, Darius Clark served as a kick returner last season, as did 5’10”, 185 lb. senior running back Rondreas Truesdale.\n\nHowever, Newberry’s two-deep lists Keinan Lewis (6’2″, 205 lbs.) as the primary kick returner. The senior from Belton, who began his collegiate career at Georgia Military, also starts at wide receiver (and scored four touchdowns last season).\n\nThe two-deep indicates that Markell Castle will be the Wolves’ punt returner. He returned two punts last season.\n\n—\n\nThe Citadel and Newberry had one common opponent last season, North Greenville. Both played NGU in Tigerville.\n\nLet’s look at some stats from those games, starting with Newberry-North Greenville. The Wolves prevailed 29-28, scoring a touchdown (and converting the PAT) with 1:04 to play in the contest.\n\nNewberry NGU Points 29 28 Rushing yardage 192 275 Yards/rush 4.8 7.6 Rush TDs 3 2 Passing yardage 215 96 Comp-Att-Int 21-38-0 14-34-0 Average/pass att 5.7 2.8 Passing TDs 1 1 Total offense 407 371 Total plays 78 70 Yards/play 5.2 5.3 Fumbles/lost 1/0 0/0 Penalties 14 13 Penalty yards 120 120 Net punt average 35.3 34.6 Time of possession 31:47 28:13 3rd-down conv 7-17 4-14 3rd-down conv % 41.2% 28.6% Sacks by-yards 0-0 1-1 Red Zone TD% (4-5) 80% (2-2) 100%\n\nPhew, look at all those penalties! The elapsed game time was 3:19; at least 35 minutes of that must have been used by the officials just to march off penalty yardage.\n\n—\n\nNow, those same categories for The Citadel-North Greenville:\n\nTC NGU Points 38 14 Rushing yardage 559 56 Yards/rush 7 2.4 Rush TDs 4 0 Passing yardage 40 316 Comp-Att-Int 3-6-2000 14-32-1 Average/pass att 6.7 9.9 Passing TDs 1 2 Total offense 599 372 Total plays 86 55 Yards/play 7 6.8 Fumbles/lost 3/1 0/0 Penalties 3 6 Penalty yards 40 71 Net punt average 34.7 38.9 Time of possession 39:08 20:52 3rd-down conv 7-15 2-12 3rd-down conv % 46.7% 16.7% Sacks by-yards 3-27 0-0 Red Zone TD% (2-6) 33% (0-0) 0%\n\nThe Citadel didn’t do a great job in the Red Zone, but with 559 rushing yards, it didn’t matter. The Bulldogs also got burned on two big pass plays (which is reflected in the yards/attempt category).\n\nNorth Greenville’s completions/attempts were very similar in the two games, but thanks to those big gainers the Crusaders put up much better offensive passing numbers against the Bulldogs than they did versus the Wolves.\n\n—\n\nI also took a quick glance at Newberry’s games against Lenoir-Rhyne from 2010 through 2013, when Brent Thompson was the offensive coordinator for L-R. Newberry still has the same head coach (Todd Knight) and defensive coordinator (Stephen Flynn) it had for those four contests.\n\n2010: Newberry won 40-36; Lenoir-Rhyne rushed 47 times for 376 yards and 4 TDs (one lost fumble) while going 6-15 through the air for 92 yards and a TD (against two interceptions)\n\n2011: Lenoir-Rhyne won 54-42; L-R rushed 52 times for 346 yards and 4 TDs (one lost fumble), and also completed 3 of 6 passes for 133 yards and two TDs\n\n2012: Lenoir-Rhyne won 44-21; the Bears rushed 59 times for 395 yards and 4 TDs while completing 3 of 6 passes for 77 yards and a TD\n\n2013: Lenoir-Rhyne won 35-14; L-R rushed 74 times for 428 yards and 5 TDs (one lost fumble), and completed 3 of 5 passes for 80 yards\n\nLenoir-Rhyne rushed for 1545 yards in four games, which comes out to 386.25 yards per contest. The Bears averaged 6.66 (ooh, spooky) yards per rush and scored a total of 17 rushing touchdowns.\n\nAs far as the passing statistics were concerned, L-R was 15-32 through the air (46.9%) for an average of 11.9 yards (!) per attempt.\n\nThe Bears’ 3 completions in the 2011 contest included a 70-yard TD and a 42-yard reception, while the 2012 game featured a 50-yard TD reception by a Lenoir-Rhyne receiver named Artis Gilmore. (How he didn’t wind up playing for Gardner-Webb or Jacksonville, I’ll never know.)\n\nWith those results in mind, I thought it was a bit curious that Newberry waited until very late in its preseason to make an adjustment to its practice schedule. Instead of an anticipated scrimmage, the Wolves’ coaching staff elected to “[alter] its practice schedule to focus on preparing for The Citadel’s unique ground-based scheme.”\n\n—\n\nNewberry’s football team has an honor council known as “The Order of the Gray Stripe”. Among other things, the Wolves’ game captains are chosen from this group.\n\nDuring the game, these individuals can be identified by their helmets, which have a gray stripe down the center. Other players will have solid white helmets with no striping. Newberry’s helmets also feature a stylized red “N” that incorporates a wolf in the logo.\n\nThe Wolves are one of many schools that have mix-and-match uniforms, with their togs provided by adidas. Expect either an all-white or white jerseys/scarlet pants look on Saturday for Newberry, which is 6-2 since 2015 wearing those two combinations, while the Wolves are only 1-1 wearing gray pants with the white jerseys.\n\n—\n\nAt the SAC’s Media Day, Todd Knight discussed the advantages of playing a game at The Citadel:\n\nCharleston has always been a hotbed of recruiting for us. I think just getting our face out there in Charleston that day will be beneficial for us. I just hope we have a good show. We’ve got so many players already on the team from Charleston, Baptiste Staggers being one of the main ones. Darius Clark, LaQuan White, Rameak Smith are all from there and are key guys for us. Josh Spigner too. And three of our NFL guys came from that area as well.\n\nLast week, the Newberry coach told Columbia radio station WGCV that “I’m not gonna have to do a whole lot to get our kids fired up for The Citadel. We’ve got one kid whose family has already bought up 100 tickets.”\n\nNewberry’s abundance of Lowcountry players earned the program an article in The Post and Courier last November.\n\n—\n\nOdds and ends:\n\n– The weather forecast for Saturday in Charleston, per the National Weather Service: mostly cloudy, with showers and thunderstorms likely during the day; expected high temperature of 87 degrees and a 60% chance of precipitation. The low temperature Saturday night is projected to be 75 degrees, with evening thunderstorms a possibility (40%). Not ideal.\n\n– Per one source that deals in such matters, The Citadel is a 30-point favorite over Newberry. The over/under is 50.5.\n\n– Other lines involving SoCon teams: Wofford is a 13-point favorite against Furman; Mercer is a 20-point favorite versus Jacksonville; Samford is am 8.5-point favorite against Kennesaw State; East Tennessee State is a 28.5-point favorite versus Limestone; and VMI is a 31.5-point underdog at Air Force.\n\nWhile the Kennesaw State-Samford game is expected to be high-scoring (over/under of 67), the same cannot be said for Furman-Wofford (over/under of 45.5).\n\nAround the Palmetto State, Presbyterian is a 40-point underdog at Wake Forest; Clemson is a 40-point favorite versus Kent State; South Carolina State is a 2-point favorite at Southern; Charleston Southern is a 21-point underdog at Mississippi State; Coastal Carolina is a 1.5-point underdog at home versus Massachusetts; and South Carolina is a 4.5-point underdog against North Carolina State, with that game being played in Charlotte.\n\nAfter losing 27-13 to Jacksonville State in Week 0, Chattanooga is off this week.\n\n– Massey Ratings: The Citadel is ranked 16th in FCS as Week 1 approaches. Newberry is ranked 66th in D-2. Overall (all college teams ranked), The Citadel is 130th, while Newberry is 344th.\n\nMassey projects a final score of The Citadel 42, Newberry 13. The Bulldogs are given a 97% chance of victory.\n\nOther FCS rankings in Massey of note: Wofford (8th), Chattanooga (9th), Charleston Southern (10th), Chattanooga (15th, down six spots after losing last weekend), Samford (21st), Furman (34th), Mercer (43rd), Kennesaw State (51st), Gardner-Webb (52nd), Western Carolina (58th), VMI (64th), ETSU (91st), South Carolina State (89th), Presbyterian (95th).\n\nThe FCS top five in Massey’s rankings, in order: North Dakota State, James Madison, Eastern Washington, Youngstown State, and Jacksonville State (which jumped two spots after beating UTC).\n\n– In the 2017 preseason AFCA D-2 poll, Newberry was in the “receiving votes” category. It would have ranked 30th if the rankings had been listed to that placement.\n\n– Newberry offensive coordinator Bennett Swygert is a former quarterback at Western Carolina and Summerville High School. This is his fifth season as the Wolves’ OC.\n\nHis wife, Lyndsey Swygert, is the cheerleading coach at Newberry. She also oversees the school’s other spirit programs, including the Wolves’ dance team (a group known as the Scarlet Poms).\n\n– C.J. Frye was recently hired as Newberry’s tight ends coach, a position he also held in 2012-13. Frye played football at South Carolina (he is the son of longtime Gamecocks track coach Curtis Frye) and for the past two years was the head football coach at Andrew Jackson High School, until he unexpectedly resigned in July.\n\n– The Wolves play their home football games at Setzler Field, which has the distinction of being the oldest on-campus football stadium in South Carolina. It has a seating capacity of 4,000.\n\nThe school averaged 3,502 fans per home game last season, which was 58th-best in Division II (out of 172 institutions). That average was better than 22 FCS programs, including two in South Carolina — Presbyterian (which averaged 3,299 patrons per home contest) and Charleston Southern (2,712).\n\n– Setzler Field is also the home of Newberry’s women’s lacrosse team — and as of the spring of 2018, the new men’s lacrosse program. Nine of the eleven schools in the SAC sponsor men’s lacrosse.\n\n– Newberry started a major fundraising campaign in late 2014. Part of the campaign includes a “stadium renovation and athletic village construction project” with the objective of modernizing and upgrading the football stadium (including the scoreboard and press box), locker rooms, and coaches’ offices. The monetary goal for that project is $8 million.\n\n– Earlier in this post, I mentioned Newberry’s connection to Lenoir-Rhyne. The two Lutheran schools play every year for the “Bishops’ Trophy”, which was created in 1987 by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.\n\nNewberry and Lenoir-Rhyne have played 83 times, including every season since 1946.\n\n– For many years, Newberry’s chief gridiron rival was Presbyterian (95 meetings), with the annual game between the two schools often taking place on Thanksgiving Day. They played for one of the better trophies in college football, the Bronze Derby. It didn’t have the grandeur and mystique of the coveted Silver Shako, but it was a fine bauble.\n\nAlas, the Newberry-Presbyterian series has been dormant since 2006, due to the Blue Hose moving to FCS.\n\n– Newberry’s most famous alum is probably the late political strategist Lee Atwater. The current Secretary of State for South Carolina, Mark Hammond, is also a Newberry graduate (and a former football player as well). Hammond’s son Ross is Wofford’s long snapper.\n\n– The game notes roster for Newberry includes 89 players from South Carolina. Other states represented on its roster: Georgia (3 players), Florida (3), Alabama (2), and North Carolina (1).\n\nThere are Wolves from 64 different S.C. high schools, including three each from Summerville, South Florence, Byrnes, Lexington, Indian Land, Marlboro County, Fairfield Central, and South Pointe. However, no players from traditional power Orangeburg-Wilkinson are on the Newberry roster, a glaring oversight which will undoubtedly prove costly to the program over the course of the 2017 campaign.\n\n– The Citadel’s geographic roster breakdown (per the school’s website) is as follows: South Carolina (47 players), Georgia (29), Florida (6), North Carolina (5), Alabama (4), Texas (4), Pennsylvania (3), Tennessee (2), New York (2), and one each from Louisiana, Michigan, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\n—\n\nThis is the first time The Citadel and Newberry have met since 1997, a 33-13 win for the Bulldogs. In that matchup, Carlos Frank had two punt return touchdowns (of 53 and 80 yards, respectively).\n\nHis game total of 177 punt return yards remains a Southern Conference record. Frank also caught a 51-yard touchdown pass from Stanley Myers during the contest.\n\nHowever, I remember the previous meeting between the two schools even more, a game played in 1995.\n\nLike this Saturday’s contest, that game was played on September 2. It was also the season opener for both teams. The Citadel had won 36 games over the previous five years, while Newberry was coming off a 4-7 campaign.\n\nThe Citadel raced out to a 13-0 lead thanks to touchdown runs by Myers and Kenyatta Spruill in the game’s first seven minutes, but the offense would not score again until the fourth quarter. By that time, the Indians led 14-13.\n\nThe Bulldogs regained the lead, but Newberry had a chance to win the game late, scoring a touchdown with 3:17 left to get within 21-20. However, Indians head coach Mike Taylor decided to kick a PAT rather than go for two (this was before the college game had overtime). The debatable decision backfired when Scott Belcher blocked the extra point, and the Bulldogs escaped with a one-point win.\n\nBelcher had 29 tackles in the game, a school record, but the narrow victory foreshadowed a difficult year ahead. The Citadel finished 2-9 that season.\n\n—\n\nI don’t think the 2017 Bulldogs are in danger of going 2-9, but this week’s game is not going to be a walk in the park. Newberry is a quality D-2 program coming off a great season. It must replace a lot of offensive talent, but does return several impact players on that side of the ball. Defensively, the Wolves should be solid, with plenty of experience.\n\nI suspect that Newberry head coach Todd Knight believes his team has a decent chance of winning on Saturday. It seems to me that he has put a slightly more public emphasis on the game than might have ordinarily been expected, even for a season opener.\n\nWhen he called The Citadel “arguably the second-best team in South Carolina” while talking to a local TV station in Columbia, it was not an offhand or impulsive remark. Knight had said the exact same thing in an earlier interview with a Greenville radio station. He was laying the groundwork, so to speak.\n\nOf course, I may be (and probably am) reading too much into that. Knight is nothing if not media-friendly, as can be noted by his barrage of TV/radio appearances around the state. He also opens his practices to the press, with a uniquely descriptive “Don’t Get Concussed” media policy.\n\nAt any rate, the Bulldogs better be ready to play on Saturday. If they aren’t, it could be a very long night for the home team.\n\nI’m confident they will be ready, though. I know The Citadel’s fans will be.\n\nHeck, I’m ready now…"
