NBC and CBS STEINMAN STATION • Clair McCollough, Pn Representative: The MEEKER Company, Inc. • New York • Chicago • Los Angeles • San Francisco Page 4 • July 7, 1958 Broadcasting closed circuit FIRST BIG ONE? • NTA Film Network, which has had tough sledding trying to sell its \"big night\" programming covering three hours of serials and feature films, primarily on Friday nights, starting this fall, understood to have reached agreement with Colgate-Palmolive Co. for \"major\" transaction. Contract expected to be signed shortly but full details unavailable as to exact amount of time bought, products to be advertised and agencies involved (C-P has several). Minimum of 115 stations re- ported involved in purchase. • Put down as one of owners of KIRO- AM-TV Seattle, Wash., Edward R. Mur- row, CBS commentator and onetime mem- ber of CBS board. It came to light last week that Mr. Murrow bought 1,800 shares in Queen City Broadcasting Co., licensee of Seattle stations last March mak- ing him 0.71% stockholder. He bought them from Queen City board member Jo- seph E. Muckley, Seattle businessman (logging, transportation, banking) for $11.45 a share. This leaves Mr. Muckley with 400 shares (.156% ). • KNAC-TV SALE • Sale of KNAC-TV Ft. Smith, Ark. (ch. 5), by Harry Pollock and Harry Newton Co. to Donald W. Reyn- olds, owner of KFSA-AM-FM-TV Ft. Smith (ch. 22) and other radio-tv and pub- lishing properties, for $350,000 plus as- sumption of liabilities estimated at about same, has been agreed upon. Sale is subject to exercise of 30-day option by George T. Hernreich, formerly half-owner of station, to buy KNAC-TV for same price. KNAC-TV expansion program in- cluding maximum power and new studios would not be affected, nor would manage- ment change. Barring unexpected, FCC Chairman John C. Doerfer will leave Sept. 12 for International Telecommunications Union conference at Geneva which begins Sept. 29. He is chairman of U. S. delegation. He probably will be abroad for six weeks to two months. During his absence, Comr. Rosel H. Hyde, senior member, will be acting FCC chairman. • PRIVATE LINE • Prospects are good that FCC shortly will issue proposed rulemak- ing looking toward giving television li- censees in remote areas option of installing their own private line microwave relays or of leasing them from common carrier, such as AT&T. Under existing regulations, private relays are authorized only until common carrier facilities are available. Contention of licensees is that installation and maintenance of private lines are pos- sible at fraction of common carrier cost. • New tv film distribution firm is being Broadcasting organized by Jack Wrather, already active in motion pictures, tv film production and station ownership. Company is in process of selecting top personnel with Walter Kingsley, general manager of syndication sales for Ziv Television Programs, slated to become vice president in charge of sales. Company holds distribution rights to Sergeant Preston of the Yukon and plans to acquire other properties. Wrather or- ganization controls KFMB-AM-TV San Diego and KERO-TV Bakersfield, and owns Disneyland Hotel and The Lone Ranger. BEAUTY PARLOR SPAT • Tv commer- cial for Max Factor's \"Natural Wave\" hair-curler has stirred indignation of Na- tional Hairdressers & Cosmetologists Assn., which has 50,000 members in beauty business. Hairdressers' group ob- jects to claims for do-it-yourself hair- curler, described on NBC-TV Polly Bergen show May 3 1 as changing \"structure of your hair from naturally straight to curly.\" NBC-TV silent but admits receiving com- plaint. Copy was prepared by Doyle Dane Bernbach agency, which has since been replaced by Kenyon & Eckhardt. It's understood complaint was made to NAB Tv Code Board. NBC-TV seems to be the network most likely to bring comedy back to air next season with deal now about to be signed with Colgate-Palmolive Co., New York, for sponsorship of George Burns show (without Grade Allen) Friday 9:30-10 p.m. Network also has Milton Berle and Ed Wynn returning to regular shows next season in addition to Steve Allen and Groucho Marx. • LETTER WRITERS • FCC public dock- ets, which usually are used by attorneys and others interested in status of pending cases, have been given going-over by swarms of newsmen since disclosure through activities of House Legislative Oversight Committee of alleged attempts to \"influence\" Commission actions. Recent headline in Detroit News read: \"FCC Files Bulge with Pleas Sent by Congressmen.\" All communications addressed to Commis- sion involving pending cases go into public file. Tip: \"Personal\" letters addressed to individual commissioners do not. • National Audience Board, with aid of group of psychologists, plans to conduct comprehensive survey of nation's televi- sion editors on question of pay tv vs. free tv. Questionnaire, now in developmental stage, probably will be dispatched about Sept. 1. Project is being underwritten by Peter Goelet, president and founder of National Audience Board. LAWRENCE TUBE • Allen B. DuMont Labs will continue work on developing Lawrence one-gun color tube for incor- poration in lower-priced color tv set. Du- Mont's tv tube is not affected by Emerson's acquisition of DuMont consumer products line (see story, page 74). DuMont is li- censed via Chromatic Labs (Paramount Pictures owned) to develop tube, and it's understood, once prototype is workable in set design, DuMont would manufacture tubes. Look for announcement shortly that Grant Tinker, tv account supervisor at McCann-Erickson, New York, will switch to Warwick & Legler, New York, as di- rector of tv programming, newly created position. It is understood Mr. Tinker will be concerned principally with Revlon Inc. network programming. MAN OF YEAR? • Quips about Bernard Goldfine are order of day. One applicable to broadcasting is that Goldfine should receive Broadcasters' Man of the Year Award because of service performed in diverting House Oversight Committee in- quisition from FCC. Comr. Craven was absent from FCC last week because of poison ivy outbreak, and therefore could not testify on his memorandum at windup of Senate Com- merce Committee hearings last Tuesday (July 1). His memorandum, however, be- came one of focal points of discussion, and Commissioner therefore issued statement from his home explaining purpose of plan (see page 50). GET SHOW MOVING • There will be no lull in effort of FCC to formulate new tv allocations plan. FCC was told last week by Senate Commerce Committee to get busy. First informal approach to mili- tary on possible channel swap to provide minimum of 25 contiguous channels for tv is scheduled tomorrow (July 9) between Comr. T. A. M. Craven and high military brass. Latter group expected to include Paul Goldsborough, communications ad- visor to Secretary of Defense Neil McEl- roy. Craven proposal is part of overall FCC allocations study ordered three weeks ago (text, Craven Memorandum, Govern- ment, June 23). General Mills Inc., Minneapolis, in ad- dition to buying sports programs preceding major sports events on NBC-TV expected to buy four quarter hours of daytime shows on one weekday on that network.

Page 8 • July 7, 1958 Broadcasting at deadline FCC FROWNS AT NETWORK-STATION MOVES, BUT FINDS NO CAUSE FOR DISCIPLINING FCC rapped knuckles of three tv net- works— and two tv stations — told all not to do it anymore, and forgave. In individual, lengthy and particularized letters sent Thursday (July 3) to ABC, CBS and NBC and to WMAL-TV Washington and KBTV (TV) Denver, FCC weighed allegations that network rules had been violated and found that although there was some substance, no clearcut violations appeared in most instances. Purported violations showed up first in Barrow Report, issued last October follow- ing two-year investigation of networking by special study staff under Roscoe L. Barrow, U. of Cincinnati Law School dean. Commission wrote to all networks and sta- tions apparently involved, collated and weighed answers. Essence of Thursday's letters: • ABC — No violation of tie-in between rate increases and program clearances. No harm in discussing these two items to- gether, but rate increases must not be con- ditioned on further program clearances. No violation that network checked with affiliate in one community before affiliating with another station in neighboring area. In one instance here, Commission said, moving party was station, not network. Violation found in two instances where network tied in question of equalization of stations' spot rates with network rates. This alluded to WMAL-TV and KBTV. Both stations were told actions were infractions of network rules, but since network was moving force, stations not held culpable. • CBS — No violation that it extracted promises of clearances in discussing affilia- tions with Hartford Telecasting Corp. (applicant for ch. 3 in Hartford, Conn.), WIS-TV Columbia, S. C, and WGAL- TV Lancaster, Pa., since no arrangements consummated. But, Commission said, dis- cussions with Hartford Telecasting and WGAL-TV were contrary to intent of rule, Evidence insufficient that (1) network tied program clearances to questions of rate increases in conversations with WBTV (TV) Charlotte, N. C; WCSC-TV Charleston, S. C; (2) that network discussed affilia- tion with stations in other markets with affiliates in nearby markets, involving KMT- TV Omaha, WNAC-TV Boston and WCCO Minneapolis; (3) that network checked with affiliate before offering program not desired by affiliate to another station in same mar- ket, involving WCAU-TV Philadelphia, WDTV (now KDKA-TV) Pittsburgh and KOTV (TV) Tulsa. Insufficient evidence also found that net- work tied network rate increases to equaliza- tion of stations' spot rates in 11 instances — but activities contrary to purpose and intent of rule with respect to six stations and less clear but contrary with regard to five others. Commission said CBS Spot Sales had cooperated with CBS Network in trying to accomplish this. • NBC — No infraction found that net- work tried to use promise of increase in net- work rates to prevent stations from carry- ing programs of other networks — but ob- jected to interpretation of NBC that such move not contrary to regulations. No viola- tion found that network checked with af- filiate before affiliating with another sta- tion in nearby market — but found violation on part of Crosley Broadcasting Corp. threatening network on subject (this action already taken last May in letter to Crosley; Government, May 26). Found no viola- tion that network tried to tie-in equalization of spot rates of affiliates with network rates, Y&R, General Foods Go ABC-TV For $13.3 Million Daytime Buy Young & Rubicam, for General Foods, has signed with ABC-TV for substantial blocks of daytime programming [Closed Circuit, June 16]. Time costs for 40 quar- ter hours weekly is $13.3 million. General Foods is expected to take 20 quarter hours. Of budget, 60% is new money for tv, other 40% expected to come from casualties of some NBC-TV and CBS-TV shows. Pact calls for \"cooperative programming\" between ABC-TV and Y & R. If ABC-TV comes up with show that Y&R disapproves, agency can veto and vice versa. At least 20 shows are being considered for daytime schedule which runs 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Only show set at moment is Peter Lind Hayes and Mary Healy, 12-12:30 p.m. clock time, which probably will be on tape. Week- ly production budget for each of five daily quarter hour strips reportedly will be $25,- 000. Two other agencies, Sullivan, Stauffer, Colwell & Bayles and Dancer-Fitzgerald- Sample are said to be considering buys in ABC-TV daytime operation. 'Special Six' New ABC Film Entry ABC Film Syndication's Proven Programs Div. is announcing today (July 7) availabil- ity of new \"Special Six\" package of J. Arthur Rank feature films.

Broadcasting July 7, 1958 • Page 9 PEOPLE NEW SPORTS BILL THREAT TO BROADCASTS at deadline Broadcasts of professional baseball games as well as hockey, basketball and football, face possible crippling or death in legisla- tion exempting organized sports from anti- trust laws. Senate Antitrust Subcommittee will open hearings July 9 under chairman- ship of Sen. Estes Kefauver (D-Tenn.). NAB, acting on board instructions [At Deadline, June 23] has asked for chance to appear in opposition to bill. At stake are radio and tv coverage of major sports, inasmuch as bill would give commercial sports operators freedom to set up barriers keeping broadcasts out of areas within 75 miles of major or minor league cities. Commercial sports projects involving many millions in advertising could be arbi- trarily suppressed at pleasure of clubs, under provisions. Victor R. Hanson, Assist- ant Attorney General in charge of Anti- trust Div. of Dept. of Justice, has sharply criticized proposed 75-mile broadcast barrier proposed by National Assn. of Professional Baseball Leagues. FCC to Consider New Ways To Use FM Multiplexing Growing interest in commercial use of fm multiplexing (mx) sparked FCC action Thursday (July 3) calling for study of spe- cialized services. Commission will decide, after reviewing comments, whether to take action broadening its rules to permit more types of service. Comments will be received up to Sept. 2. Fm broadcasters have proposed such mx commercial services as price quotations, facsimile, stock market reports, paging services, baseball networking and traffic light control. Commission noted stereophonic broadcasting has been proposed both as im- proved aural service and as type of sub- sidiary communications \"similar to that which may now be offered on a subscription basis.\" Original change in FCC rules to permit commercial use of fm subcarriers was adopted March 16, 1955. KQUE Albuquerque: $284,700 Radio station sale announced Friday, sub- ject to usual FCC approval: KQUE Albu- querque, N. M., sold by W. N. Schnepp, Robert Williams and others to Dandy Broadcasting Corp. (WPEO Peoria, 111.), for $284,700. Mr. Schnepp holds interest in KUSN St. Joseph, Mo. Mr. Williams will remain as sales manager of KQUE. Dandy stockholders are Kenneth R. Greenwood, Robert Chapin (both Peoria) and Lee Vaughn and Merritt Owens (both of Kansas City). Broker: Blackburn & Co. In letter to Paul A. Porter, attorney for baseball commission, Mr. Hanson noted that under proposed rule each baseball club in major and minor leagues would agree not to telecast any of its games from sta- tion located outside its home territory and in home territory of any other league club on day such other club is to play home game. Home territory would be defined as 75-mile radius from ball park. Mr. Hanson pointed out that similar rule adopted by majors in 1946 was repealed in 1951 at Dept. of Justice urging on ground it violated Sherman Act. He added 75-mile rule \"might well preclude the American public from all chance to view on tv the bulk of professional baseball games.\" Senate subcommittee hearing will open with list of big-name baseball players as favorable witnesses. Justice Dept. and Fed- eral Trade Commission will testify. Hearings are expected to last about week. Only op- ponents to bill, besides NAB, are expected to be two federal agencies. $3,636,750 in Sales Approved Among station sales approved by FCC, announced Friday: • KFMB-AM-TV San Diego, Calif.; KERO-TV Bakersfield, Calif.; KYAT (TV) Yuma, Ariz. — Control transferred from J. D. Wrather Jr., Maria Helen Alvarez and Edward Petry Co. to Marietta Investment Corp. (Wrather and Petry), for $2,916,750. Mr. Wrather also holds grant for uhf channel in Boston. Transfer made without prejudice to Commission action in KYAT (TV) extension of cp application (see page 56). • WGRC Louisville, Ky.— Sold to Mc- Lendon Corp. for $720,000. McLendon Corp. also owns KLIF Dallas, KTSA San Antonio, both Texas, and KTBS-AM-FM Shreveport, La. WGH Queried on Program Balance FCC Thursday advised WGH Newport News-Norfolk hearing is necessary on sta- tion's renewal application because of \"over- all programming.\" In McFarland letter, Commission asked why WGH's program- ming does not measure up to percentages for various classifications specified in pre- vious renewal applications. FCC had sent earlier inquiry to station and WGH revised programming to meet alleged lack of discussion and educational shows. This action, however, has not satis- fied FCC, which also has queried number of Atlanta outlets regarding purported pro- gramming imbalance [Closed Circuit, March 31; Government, April 14], but has done nothing as yet on renewal of these stations.

Affiliated with American Broadcasting Company Represented by Blair-TV and McGavren — Quinn In June, for the fourth consecutive month, NBC Television Network nighttime programming topped all competition, according to Trendex. NBC leads the second network by 8%, the third network by 48 %. This latest evidence confirms once again NBC's leadership as similarly shown month after month by the Nielsen Multi-Network Area Report. In terms of individual time periods, NBC has scored a series of dramatic audience gains since the season began. For example, NBC now comes out on top four nights out of seven . . . wins 20 of 42 nighttime half hours, seven more than in October and almost as many as the other two networks combined. In the re-programmed 7:30-8 pm time period, Monday-Friday, NBC has moved ahead 54 % since October, now leads one competitor by 101%, the other by 66%. WAGON TRAIN has increased its share-of-audience 78% since October! Record-breaking increases like these put the finishing touches on a season which has seen NBC move rapidly to the top in the greatest one-year audience shift in television's history.

PLAYHOUSE 90 Without the haunting prohibition-era atmosphere that pervades F. Scott Fitz- gerald's short novel, The Great Gatsby, it is doubtful if the story could have remained as popular as it has since the first printing in 1925. The book is a mood-piece; the mood was not captured in last Thursday's Playhouse 90 adaptation. To make plausible the weaknesses in the storyline and the somewhat puerile actions of the characters, the producers should have made an effort to work up that heady atmosphere in which the characters' actions would have been more believable. A studio trumpeter playing a ricky-tick version of \"Yes Sir, That's my Baby,\" is hardly enough to take viewers back 30 years. (Effect of the flappers' chemises as a \"period costume\" was lessened by their being in style again.) But the production's main fault was the age of the actor who played the title role. Robert Ryan is too mature to play the part of the indigent army officer overwhelmed by a rich girl at a party. For this reason his Jay Gatsby — and perhaps the whole play — never got off the pad. The show floated from commercial to commercial with never a high spot. It sank when heroine Jeanne Grain slipped to the floor moaning, \"It's Jay, Jay.\" It's a pity, too, the show's host did not memorize his introductions to the play. Seeing someone appear to read his lines above the tv camera is enough to get any show off to a false start. Production costs: Approximately $160,000.

HAGGIS BAGGIS As the temperature rises, competition for merchandise on the tv quizzes gets hotter and hotter. The industry's \"loot conscious- ness\" that set in some 10 years ago with Stop the Music is being perpetuated on NBC-TV by a new quiz game called Haggis Baggis. Its crass concern with the prizes offered — classified as \"Haggis\" or \"Baggis\" spoils — might well outdo the grabbiness of The Price Is Right (where contestants bid on what they deem to be the value of the loot). Taken as a whole, Haggis Baggis stands out these summer nights (and week- days to boot) as a massive billboard for advertisers who don't buy time. As to the game itself — four players try to answer questions cross-filed under various categories and letters; as each query is an- swered correctly, another patch is removed electronically from a masked, blown-up photo of some celebrity. The first contest- Page 14 My 7, 1958 ant to score gets first crack at two piles of jackpot loot — appliances, autos, furs, trips abroad, etc. — one pile being \"Haggis,\" the other \"Baggis.\" Runners-up also vie on the clean-up. Essentially, this outlandishly-titled program is a variation on the old parlor word game, \"Ghosts.\" (What so-called \"new\" tv quiz game these days isn't?) On the premiere show, host Jack Link- letter (son of Art Linkletter of People Are Funny and Houseparty fame) welcomed four contestants, a housewife, a truckdriver, an exterminator and an ex-WAF. They proved to be remarkably perceptive — not just in picking the right \"faces\" but also the \"right\" prizes. The daytime version of Hag- gis Baggis is the same game, played five times as often and with Fred Robbins as croupier. Production costs: Approximately $11,000 (Mon. evening version); approximately $8,000 (daily afternoon). Sustaining in color on NBC-TV, Mon., 7:30-8 p.m. EDT and Mon.-Fri. 2:30-3 p.m. EDT.

SEEN AND HEARD While 30 or 40 million viewers sat en- tranced a week ago Sunday (June 29) by the spectacular acrobatics of the Moiseyev company on the CBS-TV Ed Sullivan Show, some 30 or 40 recalcitrant Americans tuned in NBC-TV and Steve Allen, who offered a no less spectacular attraction in the per- son of Oscar Levant. Mr. Levant is a sensitive, gifted pianist. He is also an acrid commentator on things — animal, vegetable and mineral. On the Steve Allen Show, he engaged in a verbal duet with the host that extended the opening bit (according to Mr. Allen) nine minutes. He returned to sit on a piano and talk about pills, people and his audience, whom he capsuled as obvious- ly beneath him. He concluded by playing Gershwin and nearly fell over as he ac- knowledged the tumultuous applause of the recently abused audience. With the help of comedian Don Adams and singers Dorothy Collins and Tony Bennett, it was a bright hour of entertainment. Even so, dialing Allen instead of Sullivan June 29 was like being the only one at an uptown party to spurn vodka and insist on Kentucky bour- bon. As a public service, herewith an up-to- date box-score on who's claiming what on tv. In cigarettes, Brown & Williamson's Viceroy at one time led the pack with 20,- 000 filter traps; later, after Philip Morris Inc.'s Parliaments claimed 40,000 filter traps, Viceroys upped its own count to 22,- 000 filter traps. It's all been in vain, ap- parently. Now American Tobacco's \"im- proved\" Hit Parade has staggered them — and no doubt many listener-viewer imagina- tions— with 400,000 — count 'em, Mr. Fed- eral Trade Commissioner — 400,000 filter traps.

CALDWELL LTD., TORONTO OPEN MIKE Triple-Spotting (Continued) editor: Nobody wants to be a policeman. But if we are going to make any headway at all in eliminating triple-spotting [Broadcast- ing, June 23] we must first know where it exists. Broadcast Advertisers Report infor- mation is excellent but it is, of financial necessity, too little and too late. By this I mean their market list is small and their frequency of reports is low. This is not meant as a criticism: BAR does a mar- velous job. As a consequence, however, the only people who are in enough markets enough of the time are the stations them- selves— they must let us know the when, where and what. Ideally this whole situation could be cleared up in no time (for those who want it cleared up) if we could just be told where it is happening. The agency can control the new schedule placements to avoid triple- spotting but corrections must be made in many instances on the current schedule. These corrections can only be made when we know triple-spotting exists. Bob Liddel, Timebuyer Compton Adv., New York [EDITOR'S NOTE: BAR currently monitors 20 major markets. It averages reports from two markets each week, delivered approximately 10 days after monitoring.] editor: We were pleased to read your editorial on triple-spotting in the June 23 issue. We have also been pleased at the apparent current revolt against the practice between network shows. Frankly, we agree with you that the practice is bad but that the blame does not alone belong at the doorstep of the stations. Back in June 1957 we decided to use the theme \"No Triple-Spotting on WTMJ-TV\" as a sales tool and in that month I made a number of calls in New York with our representatives, Harrington, Righter & Parsons. Virtually the only re- ceptive ears at that time were those of Mike Donovan of Benton & Bowles, whose agency, to the best of my knowledge, was the first to come out against the practice. From that time until this it was apparent to us that other agencies were also in agree- men but still others were buying triple spots with full knowledge of what was going on. It seems to us to boil down to a three- way fault which we now hope is being corrected, with the fault lying at the door of the stations who participated in it, the agencies who knowingly bought under this condition and the NAB Code Board which allowed the practice to continue without raising a voice in spite of the fact that the practice was known. George Comte Manager of Radio & TV WTMJ-AM-TV Milwaukee EDITOR : It is about time someone mentioned the fact that it takes two to run a triple-spotted schedule. Many thanks for your editorial pointing up this fact. It is in essence what I have been writing to agencies recently who have been querying us regarding our triple spot situation. All of a sudden the triple spot has be- come a bad thing. As long as there were single station markets — advertisers insisting on television and agencies anxious for their 15% — the triple spot was an agency accom- plishment. Now these same people are pointing long fingers at us. With your help, we won't take all the blame. James D. Clark Jr. Sales Manager WRVA-TV Richmond, Va. Bouquet editor: I want to thank you for the excellent coverage given our recent audience study and the subsequent interview [Broadcast- ing, June 2]. We had an extremely warm and apprecia- tive response from a great number of radio stations. I was even more pleased in seeing in today's issue [June 23] a letter from Pete Bardach of Foote, Cone & Belding con- gratulating you on presenting all sides of a question that has become needlessly con- troversial. Please convey to the staff my apprecia- tion of a job well done. Adam Young Adam Young Inc. New York Needed: Bootstrap Lifting editor : A few questions to the nation's radio and television news directors — and station man- agers: What are you doing to develop com- petent, trained and learned \"electronic journalists?\" Are you satisfied with the product of the journalism schools? Are you finding enough young people knocking at your door to keep your news departments adequately staffed? Or are you beginning to feel the pinch, both as to quantity and quality? A number of leading journalism school people, as well as some professionals in the field, have begun noticing a decline in the number of college students enrolling as journalism majors. At the same time, more than 80 leading journalism schools indicate the vast majority received far more job offers in 1957 than they had students to fill them. Among the people concerned with this trend was my \"boss\" of student days, Les Moeller, director of the U. of Iowa Journal- ism School. Through his efforts, a number of us in news work in Iowa organized the Iowa Committee for Professional Journalism Education. The purpose: to interest more young people in journalism as a career. We concluded we had two selling jobs: to sell the youths still in high school or just enter- ing college; and to sell the editors, pub- lishers, news directors and station managers on the idea they had to engage in some self-promotion.

And some stations devote a portion of air time each week to youngsters to report the \"news\" of their circles. But the station personnel to whom I take off my cap are those who have de- veloped internship programs, affording stu- dents the opportunity to earn that invaluable experience that's become a prerequisite to getting a job. There are advantages to the station, too. The immediate advantage, of course, is the fact the station suddenly has a larger news staff, rapidly learning the ropes. And once these young apprentices have latched on to the station's policies and practices, they're likely prospects for becoming per- manent employes upon graduation. What this all boils down to is an appeal to the nation's broadcasters to wake up to a problem they'll soon be discovering, if they haven't already: there just are not enough well-trained young recruits. No doubt there'll always be deep-voiced an- nouncers to read wire copy (at least until the dwindling supply of journalism students begins affecting the wire services, too); but no station should be satisfied with noth- ing more than deep-voiced announcers who know little or nothing about news reporting. Certainly, the need for the trained, back- grounded, news-minded reporter was never greater. Rod Gelatt Dept. of Journalism & Communications Washington & Lee U. Lexington, Va.

After trying this daily for nine weeks, everyone concerned is happy with the results, and all want to continue. This week's issue of Channel, a local tele- vision guide, comments as follows: \"Spon- sors of Bingo at Home have given Hunter a free hand in presenting their message to the viewer. He visits plants and stores of his sponsors and brings back a wealth of selling information. His informal sales pitches have definitely made a hit with his audience.\" It works!

Humor aside, the cartoon illustrates what Sam Cook Digges, WCBS-TV's general manager, means when he speaks of the station's \"balance\" in programming and audience appeal. There was a time when some important people thought Mr. Digges had lost his sense of balance altogether, not only of programming but also of mind. That was last summer when WCBS announced Mr. Digges' creation: an educational tv pro- gram (by New York U.) to be fed in half -hour doses Monday through Friday. But what floored and incited the critics (newspapers particularly) was its sign-on — 6:30 a.m. — a time usually associated with barnyard crowing or infant feeding.

(semester's registration fee); a national publication dryly observed the program as typical of tv's \"deathless interest in culture.\" Once a yawning but bright-eyed audience was exposed to the program (comparative literature lectured by an NYU assistant pro- fessor, Dr. Floyd Zulli Jr.), the bottle cap flew off and Mr. Digges and staff have been wading in news clippings and praise ever since. A bookseller bought announcement time adjacent to the program and the press has been enthusiastic (The April 5 Saturday Evening Post featured the station's educational coup). \"There's need in tv for an Ed Sullivan Show, Studio One, a Mike Hammer, a Semester and a Camera Three,\" enunciates Mr. Digges, whose tall figure is topped by a carefully combed shock of light brown hair. He believes a station must con- sider the \"neglected segment of the viewing public\" even as it caters to the regular viewer. At WCBS-TV, he confesses, the philosophy is to prepare for the future. What problem possibly could exist with a network tv flagship that grosses more than any station in the U. S., and indisputably is tops in its market? Mr. Digges wryly answers: \"Staying on top.\" Because of the post he has been in for four years, Mr. Digges, Madison Avenue tailored but betraying his midwest origin in speech, is of necessity close to the New York advertiser-agency fraternity. (He's had experience on the \"street\" — that is, selling time— in New York as well as in Washington.) He finds joy in selling to people \"whether it is a concept, a block of time, a program or a community project.\" That's why Sunrise, the successful \"sale\" of an idea gives him satisfaction. He thinks there is a very important place for educational programming (that is, using actual teachers and school facilities) in commercial tv, often publicly chides educators for failing at times to grasp this concept (though he has had unusual success in working with them). WCBS-TV is on the air during the week from 7 a.m. to about 2:30 a.m. (the second \"semester\" of Sunrise starts a half-hour later than did the first). Added to the network schedule is a wealth of public service shows (worth about $5 million in time and talent last year), and local programs both live and film. It is conceded by most of the knowledgeable that the station, which has its measure of syndicated shows, has more available feature product than other New York tv outlets. Sam Cook Digges was born in Columbia, Mo., on Jan. 8, 1916, the son of dentist Charles W. Digges and Frances Cook Digges, in the U. of Missouri neighborhood. In 1937, he was graduated from the university's school of journalism. In Washington, D. C, he left the Daily News in 1942 where he worked both editorial and advertising, and joined WMAL there as one of the first two salesmen hired in Washington radio in five years. In the Merchant Marine he was a ship's officer during World War II, returning to Washington to concentrate on WMAL-TV sales. In 1949 he joined CBS in New York in the newly-created tv sales department, transferred to Chicago as tv sales manager a year later, was appointed eastern sales manager of CBS Television Spot Sales in January 1953 and in December that year, general sales manager. He is planning committee chairman of the Radio & Television Executive Society's timebuying and selling seminar that had its best season this year; a member of the all-industry music licensing committee; on the board of directors, New York State Assn. of Radio & Television Broadcasters; member of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, Society of Television Pioneers, and American Theatre Wing. In civic affairs, he is active with the Assn. for Help of Retarded Children and the radio-tv committee of the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital in New York.

Y OF TELEVISION AND RADIO Vol. 55, No. 1 JULY 7, 1958 INDIES CLAIM FOUL IN NBC SURVEY Leading 'modern radio' operators say Top 40' survey was rigged They say advertising results prove they have the adult audience Successful independent radio station op- erators last week charged that \"loaded questions\" were used in an NBC Spot Sales survey which found little timebuyer confi- dence in the selling ability of \"Top 40 Tunes\" stations [Lead Story, June 30]. The heads of four station groups which have been conspicuous in the development of independent radio asserted that the NBC Spot Sales survey: • Was designed to salvage a foundering radio network. • Encouraged responding timebuyers to substitute their personal music tastes for objective judgment in evaluating the com- mercial impact of various program formats. • Used oversimplified definitions of three types of formats that were bound to pro- duce answers unfavorable to stations which play popular music. • Ignored the fact that stations which feature popular music are among the most successful on the air. The station operators who criticized the survey were joined by officials of three sta- tion representative firms. All three representatives charged that the survey was \"rigged\" or \"loaded.\" The survey which came under criticism last week was released June 30. It was made among the NBC Spot Sales Timebuyer Opinion Panel which was formed early this year \"to serve as a medium of expression for timebuyers as a group and individually to shed light on the changing nature and increasing problems of timebuying.\" Responses were received from 258 panel- ists representing 203 different agencies or agency offices. Of the panelists 37% were with agencies billing $5 million or more per year in radio-tv, according to NBC. In its questionnaire to agency panelists. NBC denned three types of programming: \"Top 40 Tunes— stations that primarily feature current pop tunes, generally the top 40 hits of the day. \"Standard music and news — stations that feature standard as well as current pop tunes and thus cater to a wider variety of popular music tastes. \"Varied programming — stations that carry such programming as interviews and dra- matic serials as well as music and news.\" The questionnaire also suggested that panelists, in answering survey questions about the ability of each type of station to produce advertising Jesuits, \"think in terms of products that are purchased pri- marily by adults, since most national spot radio advertising falls in that area.\" On most of the 15 questions which NBC asked, the Top 40 format came out badly. This was the result to be expected from Seven critics of NBC's 'Top 40' survey TODD STORZ GORDON McLENDON HAROLD KRELSTEIN GERALD BARTELL ADAM YOUNG ARTHUR McCOY MORRIS KELLNER Broadcasting July 7-, 1958 • Page 27 Independents shoot back at Top 40' survey cont.nUEd the phrasing of the questionnaire, in the view of critics who issued comments to Broadcasting last week. Todd Storz, president of the Storz Sta- tions, said the NBC Spot Sales survey tech- nique \"was the age-old method of asking a 'loaded question' to get a desired answer.\" He said his stations were unaware of any group or any station \"that programs only the Top 40' Tunes.\" Mr. Storz thought timebuyers had been subjective, permitting their own tastes to color their viewpoints, and he compared the timebuyer spending the bulk of his client's money on music and news stations, although enjoying at times listening to a network station, to a space buyer putting the client's money into the New York Daily News because of its wide circulation though preferring personally to read the New York Times. \"At times,\" Mr. Storz asserted, \"it seems that nobody likes our programming but the listeners.\" Gordon McLendon, president of the Mc- Lendon group, found the survey \"negative\" and warned it could \"damage both NBC and the entire radio industry.\" He suggested NBC seek \"affirmatively\" to \"regain its lost stature by better programming instead of criticizing competitor networks or independ- ents.\" \"With intelligent planning,\" Mr. McLen- don asserted, \"there may yet be found a way for NBC Radio to survive.\" Harold D. Krelstein, president of the Plough radio stations, observed that the printed results of the NBC Spot Sales time- buyer poll \"tend to prove conclusively that NBC Spot Sales was obviously trying to build a case in defense of the network sta- tions it represents. And to that extent it has failed.\" He said there were more holes in the questions and answers than \"in a piece of Swiss cheese.\" Gerald Bartell of the Bartell group, dis- claiming any identification with the stylized Top 40 category, held \"any survey geared to a predetermined conclusion adds nothing to the body of competent research.\" He noted \"Radio's best people — in management, programming, talent — are now in modern radio. Network radio has been pauperized of personnel [and] ... is fighting a furious rear-guard action.\" He said \"no amount of network salesmanship or slick public rela- tions can deny that modern radio in every major market has a larger adult audience by far than its network competition.\" Adam Young, president of Adam Young Inc., station representative, issued a lengthy statement that was peppered with such ob- servations as: \"NBC is still in the radio busi- ness because with their usual efficiency they forgot to bury the body;\" the study is NBC's \"own best evidence that this one-time lead- er in the industry is now running scared.\" Mr. Young said, \"NBC's obvious rigging device in this survey has been to over-sim- plify very complex problems of program- ming.\" Arthur H. McCoy, executive vice presi- dent of John Blair & Co., station representa- tive firm, said he \"seriously\" questioned the \"true cross-section character of the panel.\" Mr. McCoy noted that the Blair company would soon issue to advertisers and agen- cies a report on local radio programming to help them \"better understand the many facets of programming . . . [although] too many selfish parties . . . have muddied up the water.\" He charged the panel survey to be one \"rigged for the selfish aims of the networks.\" He said an important ingredient \"not even mentioned\" was \"station owner- ship and management,\" which, he said, is considered first by timebuyers \"who are up to date on the complicated business of local programming.\" Morris Kellner, vice president in charge of radio sales at The Katz Agency station representative, charged the \"labels\" in the questionnaire to timebuyers to be \"loaded\" and \"anyone could have told how the an- swers would have come out considering this wording.\" Here, in greater detail, are the comments of those quoted above: We are convinced that the size of a station's audience closely paral- lels the entertainment value of the programming content offered. At times it seems that nobody likes our programming but the listeners. TODD STORZ, president of Storz Stations (WHB Kansas City, WQAM Miami, WTIX New Orleans, WDGY Minneapolis): The [NBC Spot Sales] survey techni- que used, obviously, was the age-old meth- od of asking a \"loaded question\" to get a de- sired answer. For ex- ample, the survey di- vides music stations into two categories: One — \"Top 40 Tunes-Stations that primarily feature current top tunes, generally the top 40 hits of the day.\" Two — \"Standard Music and News-Stations that feature standard as well as current pop tunes and thus cater to a wider variety of popular musical tastes.\" It is obvious that the second category of stations would be preferred by most time- buyers because the questions themselves lead to that conclusion. But even more im- portant is the fact that I am unaware of any group operator whose stations would fall into the programming definitions defined as Category One. Certainly, speaking for ourselves, our sta- tions would definitely fall into the second category. We are unaware of any group or station that programs only the Top 40 Tunes, and actually we think it would be difficult to find any station in the country that would fall exclusively into the first category, par- ticularly bearing in mind that to fit the first category the station could not carry any newscasts since news is completely ex- cluded from the program definition in the Page 28 July 7, 1958 first category and included in the second. It would be possible to follow through with an analysis of all of the questions asked in the survey to show how utterly ridiculous and self-serving they are. The latest diatribe against modern radio comes from the very same typewriters that several years ago forecast the impending and unavoidable death of radio. One does not have to be part elephant to remember that the distinguished General Sarnoff of NBC quite un-prophetically wrote the \"obit- uary\" on radio. There was a mass burial, in large cities and small hamlets from coast to coast, when he buried am radio. The networks picked up their kilocycles and stole stealthily away in the face of tv's competition. The independent operators picked up the ball and have been running with it ever since. If they had waited for the networks to retrieve the ball, the death the nets had diagnosed would have been a stark reality. The networks have been fol- lowing their hastily summoned hearse ever since. Profitability of radio station operation in 1956 (latest figures available) is shown clear- ly in FCC official data released last Janu- ary. Non-network owned stations showed a 21.7% increase in profits, but the profits of the four national and three regional net- works and their 19 owned stations combined were off one-third. Nor do profits fully show the story. Let's look at ratings. Five or six years ago the independent station that was rated in the top three or four in its market was looked upon as a phenomenon. Old-line network stations usually ran one-two with the rest of the competition jockeying for the third spot. Measures of Success However, let's look at the situation now in some of the nation's top markets. The most recent C. E. Hooper Inc. figures show: (a) In New York, right under the guns of the NBC Brass, the top indie has over twice the audience share of the NBC flag- ship. (b) In Chicago, the top indie has over three times the share of audience of the NBC station. (c) In Philadelphia, the top indie has a fraction under three times the share of audience of the NBC station. (d) In Boston, the top indie has over eight times the share of audience of the NBC station. (e) In Pittsburgh, the top indie has almost seven times the share of audience of the NBC station. Aggressive music and news operators have rebuilt radio from its near calamity in the early 50's to its present salubrious condition today. Almost every survey of a major market shows audience leadership is with the alert music and news stations. So we have a ques- tion of the \"haves\" and \"have nots.\" Since the \"have nots\" certainly intend to try to stay in business, it stands to reason that they have to have some arguments in favor of their type of programming, and some Broadcasting justification for the admittedly small num- ber of listeners they have. As a result, they have chosen the method of appealing to a timebuyer's instincts, imploring the time- buyer to ignore the basic and factual infor- mation he has available to assist him in the purchase of radio time. Most timebuyers serve the best interests of their accounts to the utmost of their ability. Invariably, these timebuyers have reached the decision that they can secure the largest audience for the lowest cost by buying music and news stations, as op- posed to network stations. The Bubblegum Myth Timebuyers have carefully evaluated the oft-hurled charge that \"nobody but teen- agers listen to today's hit tunes.\" They have studiously examined all audience surveys which show that the alert music and news station continues with its large audience lead during the 9 a.m.-3 p.m. period during winter months when no school-age teeners are available in the listening audience. They also have carefully evaluated audience com- position figures which show that the largest segment of listeners to music and news sta- tions is the young adult audience between 18 and 45 years of age. As a result, time- buyers now are placing the major portion of most important budgets on alert music and news stations. This is not to say that timebuyers as in- dividuals are personally pleased with today's music. A timebuyer is a rather unique in- dividual. In all likelihood he, or she, is far above the average level in education and intelligence, and probably has developed what might be correctly termed \"minority taste.\" But this same timebuyer, by virtue of his intelligence, is able to ignore his personal tastes and objectively consider the various possible buys available to him. If timebuyers really wanted \"exclusively\" a so-called \"quality audience,\" they would buy classical music stations or perhaps even set up displays for their advertiser at the local art museum, or sponsor a book lec- ture series. But for \"mass appeal\" products, such as cigarettes, soaps, foods and auto- mobiles, timebuyers realize that they must reach a mass market. This is not to say that specialty stations, or network stations, are not serving a public need. By catering to minority tastes, they most certainly are ful- filling an important public responsibility. It is interesting to consider the latest available Hooper surveys for the four cities in which we operate: Kansas City (WHB) almost four times the share of audience of the NBC station; Miami (WQAM) has over six times the share of audience of the NBC station; New Orleans (WTIX) has over six times the share of audience of the NBC station; Minneapolis (WDGY) has almost six times the share of audience of the NBC station. Radio stations are licensed by the FCC to serve \"in the public interest.\" We pro- gram our stations in such a way as to make them appealing to the greatest number of people. Isn't it logical that if we have over 40% of the available audience in Kansas City, for instance, that we must be succeed- ing in upholding our obligation to the Com- mission and to the public? We are convinced that the size of a sta- tion's audience closely parallels the enter- tainment value of the programming content offered and the over-all service provided to the station's listening area. As an organiza- tion, we concentrate much of our time and energy in trying to assure maximum audi- ence appeal in everything we do. Our over- all programming is designed not only to attract and entertain, but to inform and to serve our vast and growing audiences. At times, it seems that nobody likes our programming but the listeners. And one final thought. If the executives at NBC believe their survey is truly valid, they should immediately communicate with the executives at another RCA subsidiary. They should talk to RCA Victor because RCA Victor has an exclusive recording con- tract with Elvis Presley (perhaps the greatest of the Top 40-ers). Knowing now that the Top 40 is doomed, RCA will probably wish to drop the $1,000 a week contract with Presley and put him up for grabs. Even Mitch Miller might be interested! NBC should now make an effort affirmatively to regain its lost stature by better programming instead of criticizing any competitor. With in- telligent planning there may yet be found a way for NBC Radio to survive. GORDON McLENDON, president, McLen- don Corp. (KLIF Dallas, KILT Houston, KTSA San Antonio, KEEL Shreveport; WGRC Louisville): We do not feel that we can properly com- ment upon this NBC Spot Sales report since none of the McLendon stations resemble any of the stations de- scribed. Our two most recent national awards from Sigma Delta Chi and National Headlin- ed for consistently outstanding radio jour- nalism, our extraordinary mobile coverage, our recognition as a pioneer in the field of editorialization, our number of national public service awards and varied music clearly make it impossible to classify us with any type of station described, network or independent. While we are thus not directly concerned in the matter, it still seems to us that the continuation of such negative surveys by NBC can only damage both NBC and the entire radio industry. Having lost the battle of network as well as local audience, having lost the ratings fight, and having lost the commercial struggle, NBC should now make an effort affirmatively to regain its lost stature by better programming instead of criticizing any competitor, network or independent. While we are sympathetic with NBC Radio's desperate plight, and cannot help but feel sad about the demise of this great radio name, we would hope that future NBC surveys might direct themselves to affirma- tive improvement of that network. With in- telligent planning there may yet be found a way for NBC Radio to survive. Plough stations in 1957 carried the advertising of 472 national spot accounts and 978 local accounts. Not one was on the air trying to sell bubble-gum or white buckskin shoes. HAROLD D. KRELSTEIN, president of Plough radio stations (WMPS Memphis, WJJD Chicago, WCOP Boston, WCAO Baltimore) and vice president of Plough Inc. If NBC Spot Sales olW. the : . . U wno answered tne ques- f ■ ■ Hons given them pre- suppose that all Top 40 radio stations in Ameri- ca are as alike as peas in a pod, then there is a premise for assuming that the Top 40 stations as such could conceiv- ably be in trouble. However, since you can no more group or classify a station as a Top 40 station than you can mix eggs with coconuts, the article and the answers to the questions would tend to prove conclusively that NBC Spot Sales was obviously trying to build a case in defense of the network stations it represents, And to that extent has failed. Any good national representative organiza- tion, the bulk of whose clients are non-net- work stations can without difficulty find more holes in the questions and the answers (which are completely contradictory) than there are in a piece of Swiss cheese. The non-network stations of today by and large get and hold more than the lion's share of local business so it must be as- sumed that a local advertiser is certainly qualified to evaluate the radio stations in his area. The dollars of the purely local adver- tiser are required to produce much more effective and immediate results than are those of a national advertiser and for com- pletely obvious reasons. The aggressive, imaginative operation of a non-network sta- tion usually has a radio station that is far more completely integrated into his com- munity than a network station. As for our own stations in 1957, the four Plough Inc. radio stations ran 187,344 public service announcements and 6,392 public service programs of five minutes or more for hun- dreds of organizations and services — just one of the reasons why Plough Inc. stations are an integral part of their communities. Strangely enough, most network stations in this country, regardless of their affilia- tion, are completely mimicking their non- network brethren when they themselves are required to program locally due to the fact there is often no programming service available to them from the network. In the days when advertising agencies were sold on network for their clients, the affiliates did have the so-called variety pro- gramming in quantity, because in the main the agencies were programming the net- works. Unfortunately, today network pro- gramming is skeletonized because the net- works themselves will not consistently in- vest money in programming and there are Broadcasting July 7. 1958 • Page 29 Independents shoot back at Top 40' survey conned not sufficient radio network advertisers around to pick up the program tabs. The four Plough stations in 1957 car- ried the advertising of 472 national spot ac- counts and 978 local accounts. 1 can truth- fully say that not one of these advertisers was on the air trying to sell bubble gum or white buckskin shoes. To the contrary, they were selling food, drugs, automobiles, pianos, trailers, real estate, and success- fully so. As for programming to adults, our facts and figures would tend to prove that we are reaching Mr. and Mrs. Buying American, the majority of whom are under 45 years of age. We would like NBC Spot Sales or anybody else to show us what advertising dollars are being spent by American in- dustry to reach the consumer beyond that age. Radio's best people are now in modern radio. The networks wrote off radio during television's ascent and have never since been able to attract top manpower. m> » GERALD A. BARTELL, Bartell Family Radio Group (WOKY Milwaukee, KYA San Fran- cisco, KCBQ San Diego, WYDE Birming- ham, WAKE Atlanta, WILD Boston): Network program- ming generally has not been successful. In al- most every major mar- ket the melancholy story of rag-tag and non-sequential pro- grams has been repeat- ed. It is difficult to evade the conclusion that networks are no longer capable of capturing the dominant ra- dio audience and network affiliates have not been quick to compete on local terms. Be- cause of many years of reliance upon the networks they have atrophied by the disuse of the creativity they may have possessed. National spot moved to the stations with audience. Having struggled desperately, but futilely, to attract a dominant audience, net- work salesmanship and public relations have taken over. Large audiences are no longer fashionable, we are told. The fact that local advertisers too have deserted to modern radio is unimportant, says network research. Adults are reached only by \"varied\" pro- grams, concludes the network. No amount of network salesmanship or slick public relations can deny that modern radio in every major market has a larger adult audience by far than its network com- petition— not necessarily by a manipulation of percentages figures, but by actual num- bers. The objective Adam Young-Pulse study, \"The Audience of Modern Radio,\" analyzes the quality and composition of au- diences in ten major markets [Stations, June 2]. Network stations are shown in an \"also-ran\" position. So audience research does not answer the network's problems. Radio's best people — in management, pro- gramming, talent — are now in modern radio. Network radio has been pauperized of per- sonnel. The networks wrote off radio during television's ascent and networks never since have been able to attract top manpower. Any survey geared to a predetermined conclusion adds nothing to the body of com- petent research. It would be foolhardy to write off the networks. But indications are that they are still looking backward. Without the leadership shown by the current 'greats' of radio, NBC Radio Spot Sales would probably be a very unprofitable operation and the NBC network would have very little business to steal. NBC is still in the radio business because with their usual efficiency they forgot to bury the body. © ADAM YOUNG, president, Adam Young Co.: The NBC study showing how 258 time- buyers rank radio sta- tion formats is its own best evidence that this one-time leader in the industry is now running scared. Conducting such non-objective re- search with a \"loaded questionnaire\" is the best evidence that this is a fact. A few years ago, the NBC research department woud never have been a party to this kind of survey. The radio division of NBC Spot Sales is making money today because while its own parent organization showed every evidence of turning its back on radio, other pro- gressive operators who believed that the me- dium had a future made some major con- tributions to the industry. As a result, spot radio became alive and network radio died. Without the leadership shown by the current \"greats\" of radio, NBC Radio Spot Sales would probably be a very unprofitable op- eration and the NBC network would have very little business to steal. To sum this up, NBC is still in the radio business because with their usual efficiency they forgot to bury the body. There are some top-notch NBC affiliates today and we never underestimate them. They are good, however, because of their own local programming which is similar to that of the modern station operator. NBC's obvious rigging device in this sur- vey has been to over-simplify very complex problems of programming. Thus, the ques- tionnaire divides radio stations into three categories: as NBC labels them, Top 40 or rock-and-roll, standard programming and varied programming. This seems the most obvious bias and fal- lacy of the entire study. Modern radio, as we champion and sell it, cannot be character- ized by a one-word or one-phrase descrip- tion. Modern radio is a combination of many different elements. Modern radio is based on the concept of programming under the ab- solute control of astute management. This means that the public is not allowed to dom- inate the station's programming through Top 40 lists, nor are air personalities per- mitted to impose their taste on the public. Another patent bias in the NBC ques- tionnaire is the tacit appeal to the above average taste of advertising agency person- nel. We are, after all, supposedly the ultra- sophisticates in the business of persuading others; we compliment ourselves in our per- ceptive and acute sensibilities. It is the responsibility of the timebuyer, however, to make the best buy for the ad- vertiser on known facts about the audience reached. When a buyer permits his own personal preferences in programming to interfere, he is doing his client a great dis- service. All conscientous buyers know this. It is well to remember that: All kinds of radio can be good. All listening to radio is beneficial to the industry. All programming causing more listening to radio is important to us all. £ £ If a buyer gets caught in the web of a prejudiced survey and buys only a small circulation station with 'varied programming' he likes, he will more than likely end up with: (a) an unhappy client, (b) a broke client, (c) no client at all. ARTHUR H. McCOY, executive vice presi- dent, John Blair & Co.: If the panel is a true reflection of all the ac- tive and up-to-date buy- ers of radio time, then it is obvious we — and all sellers of local time — have done an incom- plete job of telling the story of local radio pro- gramming— spot radio's exclusive domain. How- ever, we seriously question the true cross- section character of the panel. This study indicates to us the immediate need for the John Blair report we will re- lease this month on local radio program- ming. This book will be delivered to all major advertisers and agencies for the pri- mary purpose of helping them better under- stand the many facets of programming. Too many selfish parties — or ignorant by- standers— have muddied up the water. What knowing broadcaster would settle for these three definitions of local programming? (1) Top 40, (2) standard music and news, (3) varied. Just like the CBS so-called \"believeability\" study, this NBC timebuyers panel survey is rigged for the selfish aims of the networks. Of course, NBC Spot Sales wants the an- swers to come out in favor of \"varied pro- gramming\" since that's their interpretation Page 30 July 7, 1958 Broadcasting of a station carrying NBC as much as that network will program and filling in with equally \"varied\" local programs. Like several other independent representa- tives we are in an especially fortunate posi- tion in that we represent stations of all kinds. We happen to have more network affiliated stations than independents. But that doesn't mean that only our network stations present \"varied programming.\" Far from it. All local programming on our sta- tions— and on any well-run station — is varied. But varied to the tastes of the people in the area served by our stations. Timebuyers who are up-to-date on the complicated business of local programming look first of all for a very important in- gredient not even mentioned by NBC — the station ownership and management. All considerations for depth understanding of the business under study must start there. The sounds that come out of a station are a direct reflection of the manager. And the ability of the manager to really reach his market (the masses the advertiser needs to move enough merchandise to affect his prof- it statement) is shown in circulation figures like Pulse, Hooper and Trendex. If a buyer gets caught in the web of a prejudiced sur- vey and buys only a small circulation station with \"varied programming\" he likes he will more than likely end up with: (a) an un- happy client, (b) a broke client, (c) no client at all. I wonder how meaningful a survey would be among station managers or representa- tives about the complicated business of writing copy, or buying time, or running an advertising agency? We hope our book will give advertiser and agency executives a better appreciation of the complications, the \"blood, sweat, and tears\" that go into local programming. Then when any biased survey comes their way, they will know better the pitfalls — and the manner in which they're being used to further the causes of selfish parties. There are many elements beside music which combine to make a suc- cessful radio station. Management is the single most important. MORRIS KELLNER, vice president in charge of radio sales, The Katz Agency, New York: The NBC Spot Sales timebuyer opinion pan- el survey unfortunately comes up with plati- tudes instead of new or enlightening informa- tion. NBC didn't have to ask the questions be- cause the labels \"Top 40 tunes stations\" and \"rock 'n' roll\" or \"Top 40\" are loaded ones. Anyone could have told how the answers would have come out considering this wording. There are many elements beside music, too numerous to list here, which combine to make a successful radio station. Man- agement is the single most important ele- ment. Buyers know that good network sta- tions and good independent stations have the locally-produced programs that acquire large audiences of responsive customers. 'COLOR RADIO —A ROSY STORY The frequently expressed opinion that Top 40 programming is strictly for teen- agers is just plain not so, according to Robert M. Purcell, president and general manager of KFWB Los Angeles. KFWB on Jan. 1, 1958, inaugurated a kind of programming which the station calls \"color radio\" and which is firmly based on the \"Fabulous 40\" tunes of the week as picked by ROBERT PURCELL and a continuing KFWB's \"Fabu- lous 40\" survey of record sales and reports from a \"Committee of 500\" organized by the station's veteran disk jock- ey, Al Jarvis. \"Color radio\" al- so embraces such features as the hourly broadcasts of \"electronic news stream of contests offering small cash awards to alert and lucky listeners plus longer contests with major prizes such as an automobile or the payment of a year's normal telephone bills. But the Fabulous 40 is the solid base of KFWB's new programming and no tunes but the Fabulous 40 are broadcast. This does not mean an exclusive musical output of rock and roll, although about half of the tunes fall into that category. The KFWB Fabulous 40 for the week ended June 28 included 18 numbers that were strictly rock and roll and two bal- lads with a rock-and-roll beat. It also in- cluded 10 ballads definitely not of the rock-and-roll genesis, four songs with Latin American rhythm, four numbers of the pop spiritual variety and one hillbilly tune. Of the 40, 37 featured vocalists and only three were entirely or chiefly instrumental. Growth of Audience The result of this kind of musical pro- gramming, Mr. Purcell reports, has been an enormous increase in KFWB's audi- ence. From winter to spring KFWB's share-of-audience for all rated time pe- riods went up 47.7% according to Hoop- er, 44.8% according to Nielsen and 34.7% according to Pulse. Who are these new listeners? Are they all live-at-home juveniles with little money to buy and less interest in buying the foods and drugs and clothes and house- hold goods the advertisers want to sell? Or are they the housewives who do most of the buying for their homes and fam- ilies? KFWB wanted to know. So did a number of its long-time clients, who were not at all sure that \"color radio\" was the right formula for them. Several of them decided to test it for themselves in a way that would prove to them whether KFWB was delivering adult listeners or only kids. Here's what happened, as reported by Mr. Purcell: \"An account we have had on the air at least 10 years is Standard Federal Sav- ings and Loan. The audience they must have can only qualify as being adult since they are interested in the problems of banking and saving. This account has had an offer on the air which is a book- let called California Here I come. This account has used this particular offer for so many years on so many programs that they can calculate with almost mathe- matical certainty their results. \"Prior to our going to our color pro- gramming concept their program was a 10-minute talk program consisting of news and sports. This program was in conflict with our concepts, but we were able to persuade them that our new pro- gramming would be beneficial to them and that they should give it a try and they changed their basic program to con- form with our thinking except that the offer remained the same. The result is that they have doubled their results on the basis of inquiries and these are, mind you, adult inquiries. Ten-Fold Increase \"'Dale Dance Studios qualifies its leads to 18 years or older. As you well know a dance studio has more appeal to the adult person who never learned to dance than to today's youngster who "
