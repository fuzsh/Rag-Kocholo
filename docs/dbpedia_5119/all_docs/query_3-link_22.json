Movement, headed by Texas broad- casters dissatisfied with NAB Presi- dent LeRoy Collins' stewardship, looks toward creation of new trade group v/ith state associations as nu- cleus and with Washington headquar- ters. Texas Assn. of Broadcasters' president, Jack Roth (president-gen- eral manager, KONO San Antonio), is spearheading movement and, with authority of TAB board, this week will circularize all state association presidents urging approval by their memberships. Broadcasters opposing move take position that if NAB isn't doing job, it's up to membership through its board of directors to do something about it. Number of broadcasters op- posed extension of contract of Gov- erner Collins until 1966. At confer- ence of state association presidents last Feb. 26-27, some dissatisfaction was manifested over NAB leadership and its implied unwillingness to resist regulatory inroads by FCC. Rumble over ratings High network officials are begin- ning to get jittery as House subcom- mittee investigating ratings services turns up more and more bugs in audi- ence research. There have already been what-to-do-about-it meetings in- volving network brass and officials of some rating companies (not Nielsen), and dozen executives of networks, agencies and production companies were scheduled to meet in secret on subject Saturday, March 30, at coun- try club near New York. Melvin Goldberg, NAB vice president for re- search, has been in on some meetings. Meanwhile, there is strong senti- ment for conference sponsored by House Subcommittee on Investigations looking toward voluntary plan for cor- recting deficiencies in audience meas- urement methodology . There is prec- edent for such round-table: Similar sessions were held by Chairman Oren Harris' subcommittee following in- vestigations of FCC several years ago. Chairman reportedly is considering such intermediate step short of seek- ing legislation although practically every committee member has said in hearing that new laws are needed. RAB's big plans There's apt to be news of major consequence for advertisers and agen- cies out of Radio Advertising Bureau's session Tuesday at NAB convention. In addition to probable offer to under- CLOSED CIRCUIT write ratings methodology study (see page 38), RAB is expected to disclose plan to provide, in collaboration with Station Representatives Assn., dollar figures on radio spending of national advertisers — possibly by market as well as by brand. Plan will be ex- plored in detail at follow-up meeting SRA is holding for broadcasters on Wednesday, with leaders including Ed Codel of Katz, SRA president; Ed Bunker, RAB president; Larry Webb, SRA managing director, and major agency executives. Why door stayed shut Failure of House Rules Committee last month to vote on proposal that public hearings be opened to broad- cast coverage has been blamed on \"mushy\" situation in committee and genuine fears of congressmen that se- rious abuses of privilege could fol- low access. Hard-core opponents shoved proposal in cooler, taking ad- vantage of \"foggy position\" of pro- ponents, and fence straddlers, access friend said last week. One lawmaker says his colleagues genuinely fear that broadcasters may be unfair in presentation of hearings excerpts {distortion, statements out of context, etc.) and that publicity seek- ing demagogues may hog spotlight, as some think already has happened in past on other side of Capitol Hill. Hope for access go-ahead is in pro- viding convincing evidence of broad- caster fairness in news handling and some persuasive safeguard to block demagogues, congressman says. Everybody's in act Emil Mogul, president of Mogul, Williams & Saylor agency, New York, is reportedly formulating plan for \"unified\" broadcast rating system that he may disclose this week. Mr. Mogul is known to be dissatisfied with pres- ent ratings service methods and prac- tices. He's upset by inconsistencies in audience measurement data and sees widely varying techniques employed by different services as unnecessary and as factors to current confusion. Market movement With thawing of fm freeze on hori- zon and hopes for am thaw later, equipment makers expect quickened competitive pace this week in exhibit halls at NAB Chicago convention as industry buying mood revives. Col- lins Radio Co. today (Monday) will break news it is extending warranties on all products it manufactures from usual one-year term to two years. Collins Wednesday will fly members of FCC to home plant at Cedar Rap- ids for fm symposium, plant tours. ARB's answer Look for across-the-board \"dra- matic\" increase in sample size for all American Research Bureau tv rating surveys in near future. Officials of ARB met on planned changes at Beltsville, Md., headquarters last Fri- day (March 29). ARB also plans ex- tensive research into accuracy of its diary information and methodology. Firm is checking with clients and ad- vertisers for acceptance before it makes definite plans. Hizzoner Grant It hasn't been announced, but William Grant, who has resigned as president and board chairman of KOA-AM-FM-TV Denver, plans to run for mayor of Denver. It's under- stood he decided it would be best to disassociate himself from management of properties, but he retains his minor- ity interest (5.9% ) in stations, in which Bob Hope is principal stock- holder. Mr. Grant is a Democrat. Program report Proposed program reporting form is due for another go-round at FCC com- missioner level soon. Commissioner Frederick W. Ford, chairman of spe- cial committee working on it, has dis- tributed his version of what form should be to other members of com- mittee, FCC Chairman Newton N. Minow and Commissioner Robert T. Bartley. They will discuss it after their return from NAB convention and, if agreement can be reached, will submit it for full commission consideration. One of main points of controversy will be perennial one of composite week. Commissioner Ford's proposal omits it, except for reporting com- mercial material. Commissioner Ken- neth Cox believes it should be re- tained. He argued this position vigor- ously as chief of Broadcast Bureau. 'Post' mortem Saturday Evening Post, which late- ly has been specializing in sensational- ism and is now embroiled in nation- wide controversy over recent article alleging collusion among football coaches in Southeastern Conference, is planning major story on ratings hear- ing now underway in Congress.

It'll be deductible. This is latest word from U. S. Tax Commissioner Mortimer M. Caplin who issued proposed regulations on travel and entertainment Saturday (March 30). Mr. Caplin said public hearings on rules will take place in five or six weeks. When \"entertainment\" follows bona fide business sessions at convention, ex- penses will be allowed, proposals state. Other tax deductible expenses in sug- gested rules: ■ Hospitality suites at conventions. ■ Wives' attendance at conventions if there is business reason for their presence. ■ Meals if \"conducive to business.\" ■ Country clubs, yachts, etc., if used primarily for business. Otherwise ex- Emerson anticipates 25% sales increase in '63 Emerson is stepping up production of its tv sets more than 50% this year over 1962, and company predicted sales in 1963 for all products should be up at least 25%. Emerson said, in statement to dis- tributors released today (April 1), that its hot seller is 16-inch lightweight port- able tv for which firm is still working against back orders. Also noted: uhf- vhf channel sets are selling \"at much faster pace than anticipated\" and cate- gory now represents 25% of firm's overall business. 'CBS Reports' sponsors drop Wednesday segment Withdrawal of three sponsors from this Wednesday's CBS Reports (7:30-9 p.m.) on use of insecticides attributed Friday to \"incompatibility of product with subject, rather than the fact that the show is controversial.\" Spokesman for Lehn & Fink Prod- ucts, one of three withdrawing sponsors, explained \"CBS actually suggested we transfer our time from this particular show to another CBS Reports, and we agreed.\" Lehn & Fink's Lysol disinfect- ant spray was product to be aired and, spokesman said, \"it wasn't exactly the type of product to be advertised on a show about insecticides.\" Other two companies — Standard Brands Inc. and Ralston Purina Co. — penses must be pro-rated. ■ Vacations combined with business trips, if they don't account for 25% or more of time away from home. Expenses for goodwill won't be de- ductible, new rules indicate, unless business result can be shown in \"de- terminable\" future. Gist of suggested rules, which in- volve what is and is not deductible in travel and entertainment field, is de- ductions will be okayed if \"directly re- lated to active conduct\" of business. Regulations, when finally issued, will be retroactive to last Jan. 1, although revenue agents have been told to be sympathetic with expenses incurred be- fore standards are issued. Record-keeping requirements were issued by Internal Revenue Service late in December (Broadcasting, Dec. 31, 1962). are food producers. Spokesman for Standard said CBS pointed up potential situation and while company didn't object to show's controversial content, it did feel show was unsuited for par- ticular product advertised. Show explores charges of Rachel Carson, in her book, The Silent Spring, that unrestricted use of insecticides is endangering mankind, as well as wild- life. Two of five sponsors will remain for broadcast — Kiwi Polish Co. and Brillo Mfg. Co. 'Censorship' protested in Mississippi incident CBS News has protested what it called \"most flagrant kind of censor- ship,\" in regard to treatment of CBS representative covering Negro voter registration demonstration in Green- wood, Miss. In telegrams made available Friday, sent to Greenwood Mayor Charles E. Sampson and Police Commissioner B. A. Hammond, network contended: \"After Richard Perez, cameraman on assignment by CBS News, had photo- graphed demonstration of Negroes seek- ing to fill out applications to vote, he was taken into custody and compelled to surrender his film in Greenwood Police Station where it was exposed and rendered useless.\" Telegram, signed by Blair Clark, vice president-general manager of CBS News, stated that CBS News wishes to protest action \"in strongest possible terms,\" and concluded: \"We ask that CBS News representatives in Green- wood be allowed freedom to pursue their legitimate efforts for collection of news for radio and television.\" New bureau proposed by NL&B for ratings Formation of new organization to do for tv-radio what Audit Bureau of Cir- culations does for print media was proposed Friday by Needham, Louis & Brorby, Chicago. Agency suggested Bureau of Audited Broadcast Measure- ment be formed with membership of BABM board to be taken from NAB, Assn. of National Advertisers, American Assn. of Advertising Agencies (four di- rectors each), plus two directors each from broadcast, advertiser and agency fields who do not belong to industry associations. Blair Vedder, vice president-media director of NL&B, explained basic func- tion of board would be to develop stand- ards for conducting all forms of tv- radio measurement. \"This will require great deal of experimenting with pres- ent methods and exploring new ones,\" he said, which could be done through Advertising Research Foundation. Once standards are developed and published for all methods of audience measurement, Mr. Vedder said, \"the independent research services would be asked to follow BABM standards for the method they employ. More im- portant, BABM would arrange for peri- odic audits of data from any company which claims its work has been con- ducted according to BABM standards.\" BABM research would have to be sup- ported financially through dues system shared by broadcasters, agencies and advertisers, he said. Formation of such organization al- ready has received favorable reaction among advertising leaders, NL&B said, citing Robert Davis, Kraft Foods: James Fish, General Mills; Charles B. Foote, State Farm Insurance: Douglas Smith, S. C. Johnson & Sons, and A. G. Waack, Household Finance Corp. NBC-TV signs Disney for two more seasons Walt Disney and NBC-TV have re- newed agreement for Disney tv show- ings on network for at least two more seasons, Disney Productions continuing to produce 50 weekly color broadcasts each year (half new and remainder selected from Disney library)- Sunday show (7:30-8:30 p.m.) started on NBC-TV on Sept. 24. 1961. bhhh more AT DEADLINE page 10 BROADCASTING, April 1, 1963 WEEK'S HEADLINERS Mr. Treyz Oliver Treyz, vp and world- wide sales man- ager of Warner Bros, tv division since March 1962, appointed vp of Revlon Inc., effective April 8 (Closed Circuit, March 25).

In effect, Mr. Silverman assumes duties handled by Oscar Katz, prior to execu- tive shufflle at network two weeks ago (Broadcasting, March 18) in which Mr. Katz was promoted to vp for pro- gram administration.

For other personnel changes of the week see FATES & FORTUNES Look overseas, AFA told, for advertising growth \"There's plenty of business overseas for the advertising business\" and it will grow quickly in years ahead, Draper Daniels, national export expansion co- ordinator, told Sixth District of Adver- tising Federation of America in Chicago Friday. He said advertising and mar- keting are \"the trump cards that Ameri- can business hold as it plays for a major share of the greatest market ever known, the market of the Western world.\" Jack Baxter, senior vice president in charge of creative services, Post- Keyes-Gardner, Chicago, told AFA competition for consumer attention in advertising is so great today no brand can afford to copycat other campaigns. He claimed evidence shows copycat ad theme actually helps sell original com- petitor rather than second brand in mind of public. AFA Sixth District elected John F. Bonsib, Bonsib Adv., Fort Wayne, Ind., as president, succeeding Frank M. Bak- er, Grant, Schwenck & Baker, Chicago. New secretary of Lee Wilson, executive secretary of Detroit Adcraft Club; re- elected treasurer. Harold Cothrell, Fort Wayne National Bank.

More radio and television sta- tions use UPI than any other news agency. Only UPI provides every- thing for news on the air: newswire, newspictures, newsfilm . . . and Univoice, UPI's audio news service. UPI is foremost because it offers most in news coverage for broadcasters. WNBC-TV devotes over one-third of its schedule to infor- mation, education, culture. More than programmed by any other New York commercial television station. More hours of hard news, too. That's why WNBC-TV is known as \"New York's community-minded station.\" Each week, more than 90% of New York's metropoli- tan area families spend over 11 hours with WNBC-TV's diversified entertainment and information schedule. And the unique, community-service programs reach siz- able audiences, too. More New Yorkers tune to Recital Hall in a typical month than will attend concerts at Phil- harmonic Hall in Lincoln Center in a year. WNBC-TV's Dialogue, Open Mind, Direct Line, and Youth Forum each attracts more New Yorkers than subscribe to the Saturday Review. ( Youth Forum alone has won 23 awards for excellence and community service.) To- gether, these five programs form the basis for a new sponsorship plan called Pathways— to help advertisers concentrate impact on New York's most thoughtful audiences. (Detailed brochures available on request. as much a part of New York as its subways Current sponsors are P. Lorillard Company, Bowery Savings Bank, and Socony Mobil Oil Company, Inc.) WNBC-TV — serving the metropolitan area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut— creates programs that viewers talk about, think about, care about. That's why New Yorkers rely on WNBC-TV. It links them to lo- cal issues and events— much as the subway system links them to many points in the metropolitan area. This kind of community-station bond is distinctive to the pro- gramming of all NBC Owned Stations.

On Nov. 23, 1959, Bob, at a Chi- cago Sales Executive Club meeting, set forth his formula for overcoming the ratings shennanigans. ... He advocated a \"single-standard ratings system that cannot be swayed or influenced by the persons paying the freight.\" He sug- gested that broadcasters combine all the moneys spent on the many ratings serv- ices, pick one as the standard, then allocate all the budgets to this one. And if one of the current services could not meet all the requirements of the time, he suggested formation of a new serv- ice, a la the Audit Bureau of Circula- tions. . . . He continued his campaign through the first half of '60. Then he had to drop the subject. No actual backing from the industry. Perhaps the industry at its NAB con- vention in Chicago will hark back to Mr. Hurleigh's warnings — and his sug- gestions for remedial action. — Harold Gold, vice president, Jay Victor & Assoc. Inc., Newark, N. J. Tv's great contributions editor: My recent interview on the WCBS-TV program The Way to Go was not my first experience with tv. As a matter of fact, it was a second appearance on this very program. But every time I have anything to say on this medium I am struck again with the great possibilities that tv has for strengthening good understanding among people and the elevation of taste and even the refining of their habits. The subject I discussed was, as you can well imagine, a very ab- struse one. I had fears that there would be little interest and even less understanding of the philosophy and ideas of the great 17th century philos- opher Baruch Spinoza. To my amazement the number of letters I received after the program and the report from the station itself indi- cates that perhaps, a million people may have listened to it and that thousands seem to have been affected by the teachings I described. You see, what I tried to say was that Spinoza was a \"God-intoxicated man\" and apparently this message struck home to many people, who in our day may not have much in common with what might be called formal religion and yet are truly religious minded in Spinoza's sense. It is certainly sobering to think that this kind of teaching can be presented in a popular medium like television and that it can also be so well-received. . . . What a blessing it is that in our country at least, tv can be used for such constructive ends. — Rabbi Maurice J. Bloom, Tremont Temple, Congregation Gates of Mercy, Bronx, N. Y.

And as a result of this egotistic posture by some of its practitioners, advertising receives far too much blame when products fail to succeed. I could address myself to a particular advertising interest — such as radio, tv, newspapers or magazines. Each is an important part of advertising, but each is just a part, a specialized tool; just as advertising itself is not an entity, but one of many marketing tools, all of which must be used expertly in putting a product into the hands of a consumer. Depending on the nature of the prod- uct, many factors come into play. The successful marketing of a prod- uct depends, first and foremost, upon the quality of the product. Advertising may be capable of achieving sales the first time around, be it cars or chewing gum. But all the advertising in the world will not influence a repeat sale without product quality. Advertising can stimulate sales of an inferior product but it cannot create customers for that product. American business thrives on customers, not on expedient sales. Distribution ■ A very major element in the total marketing mix is distribu- tion, including in the so-called package goods field the importance of shelf space and shelf positioning. For most product categories, the effectiveness of any advertising goes right out the window when the product is not available at the precise moment of the decision to purchase. (You've got to be there when the lady says \"yes.\") In today's complicated marketing world, the function of advertising needs a re-examination. Such a re-examina- tion would not produce any new and revolutionary definitions of advertising's basic purposes and abilities. There are many who are concerned that advertising has gradually been awarded the mantle of hero or bum in the business world because too much is expected from it. If such an attitude continues, much less grows, in the minds of client management we may see the disintegration, through mis- understanding, of a major economic force. Big Business ■ Today, advertising is reputed to be a $12 billion a year business. When you get that big you'd better be thinking of being grateful for that bigness, and of protecting the tal- ents and virtues that made you big. When you are that big, the spotlight is 22 on you and everything you do is magni- fied all out of proportion. The advertising community — includ- ing media and related suppliers, adver- tising agencies, and those of us who are the professional client advertising man- agement— has a very large house to keep in order at all times. Unfortunately, we are the ones who primarily promote our business beyond its basic functions and responsibilities. We are not the sole salvation for all economic problems. We forget too often that we are a part, a very major part indeed, but not the absolute \"make or break\" in the success of our products' futures. It is time for advertising to make certain of its proper and achievable perspective — document as legitimately as possible its contributions and its needs in the overall marketing complexi- ties of today and then aggressively ap- ply and promote them, but them alone, for all they're worth. There are many approaches to this problem of evaluating the contribution of advertising to the end result, which is the sale or final transaction. I subscribe to the philosophy that advertising makes its own particular contribution to the sale of a product and that it cannot overcome product quality deficiencies, rejected styling and design, inadequate distribution or im- proper dealer service and attitude at the point of purchase. If you will accept this philosophy, then you must agree that advertising effectiveness can only be evaluated or measured when not one single other marketing element is involved which is beyond the control of the advertising responsibility. Advertising's Function ■ First, we have to define the function of adver- tising. Here's one definition: \"Advertising's job purely and simply is to communicate to a defined audience information and frame-of-mind that stimulates action. Advertising succeeds or fails, depending on how well it com- municates the desired information and attitudes to the right people at the right time.\" . . . and with credibility. With this definition, the objectives or goals can only be those which reason- ably can be expected from the adver- tising. To define the objectives, it is necessary to apply systematic research, experience and judgment to these basic questions: 1. What are all the important bene- fits and services we have to sell? 2. Who are the people we want to reach? 3. Why do some people buy and why do some people fail to buy our products? These three points of information then move us on to strategy and mea- surement such as: 1. What are the key ideas, informa- tion and attitudes we want to convey about our benefits and services? 2. How do we reach the people we want to reach? 3. How do we propose to measure accomplishment in getting the intended message to the intended audience? The basic job simply is to translate product information into advertising strategy, with strategy then expressed in terms of measurable goals. When goals are established, then measurement of them is feasible. The job is mainly one of bringing all the vast knowledge and methods of acquiring knowledge already at the command of the advertising industry into sharp focus with regard to objec- tives. When this is accomplished, ad- vertising's role in the total marketing scheme stands on its own two feet and becomes the whipping boy only when the whip is deserved. Gail Smith, director of advertising and market research for General Motors Corp., Detroit, joined the GM distribution staff in April 1959 as director of television ad- vertising. He was promoted to his present position in December 1960. From 1943 to 1957, Mr. Smith was associate manager of advertising production for Procter & Gam- ble. Before joining GM, he was president of a Hollywood tv production company. His MONDAY MEMO is from a speech he deliv- ered to the Hollywood Ad Club last month. BROADCASTING, April 1, 1963 Among the harbingers of Spring in New York is the sight of grim-faced network executives, armed with pilot films and attache cases, on the hunt for Fall sponsors. But not at NBC. The early hunting has never been better, and the network was substantially sold, well before the vernal equinox. The reason for this unprecedented sales success can be summed up in one word. ■ Showmenship. For example: ■ Showman Bob Hope takes a new direction as star and host in a weekly series of one-hour dramatic, variety and comedy shows. And the program is SRO for 52 weeks, in one of the biggest sponsorship deals ever. Chrysler has Hope— and a red hot show for the Fall. ■ Showman Richard Boone is creator, star, host and continuing player in a one-hour dramatic series featuring television's only repertory company. Boone is a boon to advertisers, and I Reynolds Metals has him— another bonanza prospect for the coming season. ■ And so it goes. ■ Thanks to showmenship —and salesmanship — Spring has come in merrily at NBC.

Wf ] BROADCASTING THE BUSINESS WEEKLY OF TELEVISION AND RADIO April 1, 1963, Vol. 64, No. 13 AGENCIES: WHERE CAN WE TURN? ■ Many feel Washington ratings hearing has disclosed nothing ■ Some hope for lasting benefits from committee's findings ■ Others feel confidence of radio-tv sponsors has been shaken The Washington furore over the ratings services has generated a turmoil of uncertainty among key advertising agency executives trying to foresee what the outcome will be. Their ultimate decisions may be the biggest influence, short of actual legisla- tion, on the future usage of ratings — and perhaps on the future of the ratings services themselves. As a matter of business judgment, stations tend to fol- low the lead of important agencies in subscribing or not subscribing to a par- ticular service. One upshot of the investigation, al- though not stemming from the agencies, may be an offer — this week — to under- write a study to determine audience- measurement methodology that would be acceptable, workable and practicable. An offer along these lines, Broadcast- ing learned, may be advanced by the Radio Advertising Bureau at its session Tuesday at the NAB convention. A Broadcasting survey of executives in more than a score of agencies placing approximately a billion dollars a year in television and radio time and pro- gramming found them dividing into five not always clearly defined camps last week: ■ The biggest number took the posi- tion that the Washington \"disclosures\" had disclosed nothing that wasn't al- ready well known to anybody dealing with ratings. For the most part the members of this group gave no sign of changing their habits of ratings usage. ■ At the other extreme a smaller group, but also containing some influ- ential members, expressed concern over the hearings and their effect — rightly or wrongly — on confidence in ratings generally. One of the key figures in this group was Paul E. J. Gerhold, vice president and director of marketing services for Foote, Cone, & Belding, New York, and chairman of the tech- nical committee of the Advertising Re- search Foundation. Mr. Gerhold told Broadcasting that \"we are convinced that some of the existing ratings services are able to produce accurate information on tuning and viewing.\" But, he added, \"restoring the confidence of business in television BROADCASTING, April 1, 1963 audience figures, after these hearings, may well require setting up a complete- ly independent facility; perhaps an or- ganization controlled and financed by advertisers and agencies, to produce and publish spot checks on the accuracy of the syndicated data.\" ■ Closely allied to this group were a handful of executives — again includ- ing some important ones — who thought they probably would be \"more guarded\" or \"more cautious\" in their own use of ratings, but without changing their use radically. One suggested that he prob- ably would not, in the future, use exist- ing audience data as extensively as in the past to get detailed demographics of audience composition. ■ In a similar vein, but sounding somewhat more optimistic, some experts THE MAIN EVENT: Although not listed on the official agenda of the NAB convention, ratings promised to be a principal topic — with NAB thought the hearings would prove bene- ficial at least to the extent that \"a healthy skepticism about ratings will be developed at the advertiser and agency level,\" or that a fuller understanding of ratings will result. One member of this school, Samuel B. Vitt, vice president and media direc- tor of Doherty, Clifford, Steers & Shen- field, said the hearings are \"performing a service which will ultimately — after the cries of anguish die down — be helpful in providing a constructive per- spective on how ratings have been, and should be, used.\" He contended that the radio-tv adver- tising business has no reason to be \"ashamed\" of its use of ratings; that like stock prospect uses, ratings are \"good, valuable tools in determining President LeRoy Collins devoting much of his opening day luncheon address to a proposal that present systems be scrapped.

One indication of how closely advertising agencies watch televi- sion ratings is a current internal report at Foote, Cone & Belding, Chicago, which even takes note of the \"bottom 10\" as well as the leaders. It's \"sad to relate\"' about the \"bottom 10,\" the FC&B report said, \"but most ©f these programs represent the networks' contribu- tion to quality programming.\" Compiled by Jack Sullivan, media analyst in FC&B's media department, the report is based on the Nielsen television index listings for February. The \"bot- tom 10\" in average ratings cited by FC&B included: Howard K. Smith, 2.7; Voice of Firestone, 4.6; Chet Huntley Reporting, 6; Valiant Years, 6.7; Make that Spare, 7.1; Eyewitness, 7.9; David Brinkley's Journal, 8.9; Stump the Stars, 9.4; CBS Reports, 9.8; Father Knows Best, 10. The FC&B internal report noted that the \"top 10\" usually get so much publicity it was time the other end of the scale got some attention. The agency has published its rating reports regu- larly since last fall. whether to invest\" (\"and agencies are in the investment business\"), and that \"both we and the conscientious ratings services should be able to survive a complete airing-out and go on from there to nothing but better. ■ One or two authorities expressed surprise and even \"shock\" at some of the hearing's disclosures about some details relating to specific services, al- though they agreed with most of their colleagues that the overall limitations of ratings have been known and under- stood all along. ■ Next to the stand-patters who felt the hearings have produced nothing new and will change nothing old, the biggest number of executives had little but condemnation for the hearings and the way they are being conducted. This attitude was evident to some extent among all groups, but a few could talk of almost nothing else. Said one: \"It's a sad commentary on the way our government conducts its affairs. The people doing the investigating are completely outside the realm of under- standing our business, and yet they feel qualified to come in and conduct an investigation, and treat the people they are investigating like crooks. . . A Boondoggle ■ \"These hearings are a kind of boondoggle. It's a terrible thing and I'm sick of it. The government could do well to spend its dollars on something more worthwhile — in fact, if this is the way they conduct such a hearing as this, then it makes me stop and wonder about how they conduct other affairs.\" This indignant vice president said — as did a number of others, in different ways — that \"the people who are asking \\ll<lic It. -a. lion Id |>or I Herblock in the Washington Post 28 (LEAD STORY) for ratings are the companies who have invested millions in this business and want some sort of accounting. It's much the same as an Audit Bureau of Circulations for a publication. We have a lot of confidence in such organiza- tions, we feel they try to do a con- scientious job, and these hearings have not affected our faith in them.\" Others held that the investigating committee had shown \"a singular lack of knowledge of what it was investigat- ing,\" that it was \"unduly rough\" in its questioning, and that it had not given the ratings witnesses adequate oppor- tunity to \"speak up.\" Henry Fownes, senior vice president in charge of broadcasting at MacManus, John & Adams, criticized what we called government interference in an area \"where it doesn't belong.\" He said the reaction of knowledgeable people assessing the investigation was, general- ly speaking, \"the old ho-hum,\" and that it would have \"absolutely no effect\" on his agency's use of ratings data. Not \"Precise\" Measurements ■ An insistence running through most of the comments was that agencies do not use ratings as \"precise\" measurements or \"conclusive\" proof, but as general indi- cations of program audiences and audi- ence trends. One of those making this point, Paul Gumbinner, vice president and tv-radio director of the Lawrence C. Gumbinner agency, also made clear that he had seen no evidence indicating any reason to drop any of the three major services Gumbinner now uses. FC&B's Mr. Gerhold meanwhile told Broadcasting that he and his agency were \"disturbed\" about two things in the hearings: \"First, we have been concerned about their tone and by the sensationalism with which they have been reported in the press. \"We have also been concerned by the doubts which the hearings have raised concerning the validity of current television and radio audience informa- tion. \"We do not believe that government participation will ever be a desirable or a practical control for ratings research. But the hearings, at least to date, have done little to reassure us about the soundness of the present structure. Rather, they suggest the need for more vigorous and more independent industry control.\" Control Sentiment ■ Mr. Gerhold was not alone in feeling that some sort of \"independent\" control might be needed to police ratings. Others thought that this, in one form or another, or perhaps the establishment of some sort of agreement on methodology or survey techniques, might be the answer. There was a wide variation of opin- ion on whether or to what extent agen- cies and advertisers might support such a project financially, however. Some executives held that costs are high enough already and said their main complaint about ratings now — the so- called inadequacy of some sample sizes — could be cured fairly easily if money were available to pay for bigger sam- ples. \"To make them any more complete,\" said one, \"would be far more expensive than we could afford. Right now the ratings services present a tremendous cost to us.\" At least one executive doubted his agency would participate in any coop- erative venture to establish a standard methodology, for fear of being charged with \"collusion.\" Although there was little unanimity on what, if anything, ought to be done, there was considerable evidence of agreement that, whatever their faults, ratings are needed until something better is found. Said one executive: \"We must recognize ratings with their limitations or seek some alternative, but right now nobody is going to say, 'well, to hell with them.' Where else can an agency turn?\" BROADCASTING, April 1, 1963 Who's generous to a fault? (not us) True, someone might think we were do-gooders the way we get so involved in public service. But we're not really. It's just that we're dynamically interested in the community . . . and so is our audience. That's why we take extra pains. Like our full-time Public Service Director. He doesn't just attend civic luncheons. Or wait to receive announcements written in long- hand by nice little ladies. He cre- ates. He plans. His goal : building community interest (resulting in an alert audience for your mes- sage). He does his job well. For instance, Heart Saturday - prac- tically a full-day's programming devoted to an on-the-air panel of distinguished doctors answering listeners' questions about heart surgery, health, disease. So suc- cessful that even with additional lines, our switchboard was jammed for six solid hours. And then there was Hurricane Carla Relief resulting in a full plane- load of food and clothing for dis- aster victims. Or Sabin Oral Sunday. Or Income Tax Day. Or a hundred other special events. Adding up to nearly $250,000 free air time a year for more than 500 different organizations. Sounds like a lot. And it is. But that's really only half the story . . . when you consider the public service concept behind Southwest Central's authorita- tive, accurate news ... or the leadership in community activi- ties by our personnel.

BROADCASTING, April 1, 1963 Nielsen: No. 1 rater now No. 1 target COMMITTEE TEARS INTO TESTIMONY, RIDICULES AUDIMETER RESULTS The giant of the ratings industry, A. C. Nielsen Co., came out of a House subcommittee's hearing last week with its credibility seriously questioned. The climax — or maybe the first of a series of climaxes — came after a 20- month investigation by the subcommit- tee staff and Chairman Oren Harris CD- Ark. ). This long probe was focused last week on (T) the handling of Niel- sen's Louisville samples, (2) the reli- ability of its Audimeter reports and (3) the way Audimeter findings are ap- plied as weighting or ratio factors to Audlog (diary) and Recordimeter re- ports. Several times, by inference, question- ing and direct statements, subcommittee members and counsel put the broad- casting and advertising industries on no- tice that Nielsen ratings are deceptive, in their opinion, because they are based on smaller samples than those claimed by Nielsen and because meter-diary fig- ures are weighted against national Audi- meter data. Louisville in Spotlight ■ The boom was lowered a half-dozen times Thurs- day as the subcommittee paid particular attention to Louisville ratings. The Hearing was held Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday last week; it will resume today (April 1). Madison Avenue was dragged in by the ears Thursday as Robert E. L. Rich- ardson, special subcommittee counsel, threatened to summon agency execu- tives who had told the staff they paid scant attention to ratings in buying time. He said they had not been candid with the staff, suggesting it might be a good idea to put them on the stand to ex- plain how they use ratings and how they buy time. To date the subcommittee hearing has attacked with particular emphasis the methods and published reports of Videodex, Conlan, Pulse and Nielsen. Last week's charges against Nielsen were accompanied by vigorous com- ments from both subcommittee mem- bers and counsel. A bitter attack was made Thursday on Nielsen — last week's only victim — for what Mr. Richardson said was an attempt to confuse the record plus pur- ported juggling of diary and meter data. At the weekend the broadcasting and advertising fraternities were discussing among themselves the significance of subcommittee questioning and revela- tions. Many of those who sat through the torrid questioning and sharp com- mentaries seemed to agree the implica- tions could be profound though some suggested the subcommittee had dredged up one problem situation to discredit a widely used nationwide service. ARB Praise ■ Emerging with a sub- committee halo was American Research Bureau, which was praised for a Louis- ville report claiming a sample of 160 homes that actually produced 160 tab- ulated diaries. Nielsen was charged, on the other hand, with claiming a 205 sample in Louisville at the same time Chief 'critic' at last week's House probe into rating services was Robert E. L. Richardson, special subcommit- tee counsel, who tore into methods and reports of A. C. Nielsen Co. subcommittee staff studies showed an average of 123 in-tab reports. Thursday's session wound up with partial disclosure of an interoffice memo ascribed to Warren Cordell, technical vice president and chief statistical offi- cer of Nielsen. The memo noted that Nielsen had \"vital weaknesses\" he hoped subcommittee investigators wouldn't un- cover. This led Rep. John E. Moss (D- Calif.), acting chairman, to suggest that testimony to date pointed to a need for government regulation of rating serv- ices. Mr. Cordell voiced embarrassment at disclosure of the memo. He defended its substance, saying it was a plea to management for more money for the technical staff which later was provided. Chairman Moss suggested ratings reg- ulation might be more important than regulation of the broadcasting industry by the FCC. Nielsen witnesses were unsuccessful last week in obtaining a detailed study of Audimeter ratings. Chairman Moss said the decision would be up to per- manent chairman Oren Harris (D-Ark.) when he returns this week. Audimeter Criticized ■ In introduc- ing staff analyses of data from Louis- ville Audimeters, Mr. Richardson said the subcommittee was demonstrating that tuning is not a good measure of actual listening or viewing, especially late at night. Subcommittee members active last week in questioning included Chairman Moss (who presided Wednesday and Thursday), Rep. J. Arthur Younger (R-Calif.), Rep. Paul G. Rogers (D- Fla.) and Rep. Donald G. Brotzman (R-Colo.). Mr. Richardson was flanked by Rex Sparger, special investigator. Henry Rahmel, Nielsen executive vice president and media research manager, and Mr. Cordell were chief Nielsen wit- nesses. As the hearing resumed Tuesday after- noon the subcommittee counsel pursued a line of questioning directed at accu- racy of the statement in two Nielsen Louisville reports that the sample con- sisted of 205 gross homes. Mr. Rahmel and Mr. Cordell read explanatory lan- guage in the reports which they con- tended gave a proper explanation of the 205-home gross figure. Usable homes might be about three-fourths that fig- ure, counsel suggested. The investigators contended even broadcasters they had contacted were not aware the figure was gross rather than a projection based on a smaller sample representing usable reports. Rep. Moss said the Nielsen explanation \"was exceedingly tiring and a strain on the patience of men far more charitable.\" He added, \"This looks like false label- ing.\" He wondered why the Federal Trade Commission didn't require \"bold- face\" explanatory language and asked for the exact number of homes repre- sented. Clear as \"Mud\" ■ \"Rep. Rogers said he was certain there was a \"great error\" in the Nielsen data and Rep. Moss ob- served, \"Mud has far more transpar- ency.\" Rep. Younger said, \"You don't give a very good image of Nielsen.\" Mr. Richardson continued question- ing based on the ability of Audimeters to give a true picture of radio recep- tion, citing a case where a meter might hit 15 stations by the time it reached 740 kc and then supply false readings 30 (LEAD STORY) BROADCASTING, April 1, 1963 Whichever it is, it's going to be spent.

Associated with WSB, WSB-TV, Atlanta, Georgia and WSOC, WSOC-TV Charlotte North Carolina WHIO Channel 1 Dayton DAYTON, OHIO • WHIO • AM • FM • TV BROADCASTING, April 1, 1963 31 Nielsen executives who bore the brunt of House staff and subcommittee questions and comments were (I to r) Warren Cordell, vice president-chief in the upper end of the dial. He also was queried about the effect of loose tuners and slippage. Mr. Rahmel said the 15-station case might occur once in a decade. Mr. Richardson asked about equip- ment freezing in the Nielsen instant rat- ing service in New York City, where home meters are connected to a central office. \"You learn something every day,\" Mr. Rahmel observed, saying he had never heard of any freezing. The two became involved in an exchange based on Nielsen's share of network business. It appeared Nielsen does 90% of tv network business and about 85% of radio network business, having cancelled ABC when the network \"didn't want to go along with a new and improved type of service.\" The committee questioning included refer- ences to a Nielsen practice of send- ing a diary to a home with a dollar bill attached, with testimony indicating up to 40% or 50% of homes receiving diaries fail to return them with de- sired tuning information. \"It's like sending out Christmas seals,\" Mr. Richardson suggested. Faster Figures ■ Nielsen witnesses Richardson speaking date Robert E. L. Richardson, coun- sel to the special subcommittee on investigations, will speak before the Radio-Tv Research Council in New York at the Hotel Lexing- ton on Wednesday (April 3). A spokesman for the council said Mr. Richardson is expected to talk about the hearing into the ratings research companies, but declined to reveal additional in- formation, pointing out meetings of the council are closed and pro- ceedings are confidential. statistical officer; Henry Rahmel, ex- ecutive vice president; George Blechta, client relations vice presi- dent, who testified little last week. said installation of new IBM equipment made possible faster computations of sample size, saving a delay of several days in computing data from in-tab re- ports and gross sample figures. The IBM replaced a Univac, they said, ad- ding that starting in February a Mil- waukee report had been published with full sample figures using the new equip- ment. The probers called for full ex- planations of Louisville samples. The key point in subcommittee ques- tioning Wednesday was the March 1962 Nielsen tv rating book for Louisville matched against a similar ARB survey. Mr. Richardson said ARB claimed a 1 60-home sample and actually used rat- ings based on 160 homes whereas Niel- sen claimed a 205-home sample but actually had an average of only 123.4 in-tab homes, or 60% of 205. Mr. Richardson said a station owner naturally would be influenced in making a purchase by the sample size, bring- ing from Mr. Rahmel the suggestion a decision would also be influenced by the purchaser's advertising knowledge. When Mr. Rahmel said the differ- ence in the size of the Louisville sam- ples was not important, Mr. Richard- son observed, \"I hope broadcasters read the report of this proceeding so they will not be misled.\" Variation ■ Mr. Richardson and the Nielsen witnesses argued at length about a subcommittee claim that a 20 Niel- sen rating actually could be anywhere between 12 and 27. He added this com- ment, \"Timebuyers should be warned that a 20 rating can be anywhere be- tween 12 and 27.\" Mr. Cordell said the Nielsen reports warn of statistical variations. And Mr. Richardson added, \"Isn't the end result not very accurate, far from perfect?\" He started to compare Nielsen and ARB parallel rating for WHAS-TV and WAVE-TV Louisville, based on subcommittee tabulations of the material from which figures were compiled, but the subject was dropped in mid-air during a long argument over whether Nielsen's ratio estimation pro- cedure is really weighting of data. Rep. Moss said Nielsen responses to questions were evasive and lacking in candor. He also charged equivocation. Rep. Younger commented after hear- ing a technical statement by Mr. Cor- dell: \"I've never seen anyone sell con- fusion like you do and get so much money for it. If we did this in Wash- ington we could pay off the government debt in no time.\" Rep. Moss suggested the Nielsen wit- nesses indulge in \"less semantic gym- nastics, more candor and less equivoca- tion.\" Mr. Richardson, referring to weighting, added an aside about \"mess- ing with the figures,\" and said staff tab- ulations of Nielsen data gave higher ratings. Mr. Rahmel said small adjust- ments were made to improve quality on the basis of its Audimeter and re- corder-diary comparisons. He felt the Audimeter is more accurate than the Recordimeter-Audilog (recorder-diary ) method, explaining any adjustment from homes-in-use is the same for each station. During colloquies on past statements by A. C. Nielsen Sr., chairman of the firm, and on patents, Mr. Richardson hinted it may be necessary to recall the senior Nielsen from Paris. Mr. Rahmel said Mr. Nielsen left in early February on a business trip abroad and estimated he might return around April 19. Give and Take \" Here are other ob- servations by subcommittee members and Mr. Richardson: Mr. Richardson: \"I have seen net- work ads in Broadcasting that claim first place on the basis of a 17.9 against a 17.7 rating in a 1,100 sample. Are they really first? ... Do you tell, if asked, whether they are within statistical tolerances?\" Mr. Rahmel said Nielsen has refused permission to use data in ads if misleading. Mr. Richardson: \"Has Nielsen ever offered rebates if ratings are under 70% of the sample, or has the client been told?\" Mr. Rahmel said, \"No,\" but added Nielsen does not charge more when the sample goes over par, \"which happens much oftener.\" Mr. Richardson: \"You said a broad- caster could check and tell what the sample was. We found it 60% (in cases examined).\" Mr. Cordell said reports are published before Nielsen knows if the sample is subpar. Rep. Rogers: \"Your pattern of opera- tion is amazing and disconcerting. You tell us one thing one day and the com- plete opposite the next day.\" Rep. Rogers: \"Anyone who has bought material from Nielsen to find later some cases haven't been checked — I think this shakes confidence in your entire operation.\" Size of Sample ■ Rep. Moss: \"Many 32 (LEAD STORY) BROADCASTING, April 1, 1963 If you lived in San Francisco. . . . . .you d be sold on KRON-TV NIELSEN: NO. 1 RATER NOW NO. 1 TARGET continued tabulations fell materially below the 150 sample. What is materially below?\" Mr. Rahmel said new Nielsen data are now within plus or minus 5% of the 150 par, effective Jan. 1, 1963. Rep. Rogers: \"I can't see any point in buying wrong information. Impor- tant decisions are based on these sta- tistics; programs are dropped and jobs affected; a station's life may depend on them. I hope the truth is paramount over costs.\" Rep. Moss: After asking if a power outage from a storm would be taken into account in ratings, asked, \"Is there any other buying standard subject to so many faults as the measurements used to buy radio and tv?\" Mr. Rahmel cited the consumer price index as an example. He submitted a table show- ing that of 1962 NSI reports, 47 were below par (plus or minus 5% or 150 homes); 203 were par; 528 were more than 5% above par. Rep. Younger: \"Do you require the user to explain this is a cheap or in- accurate rating?\" Mr. Richardson: In referring to a New York city Audimeter sample, he suggested a rating of 15 actually is any- where from 11 to 19 and he doubted the accuracy of certain adjacency rat- ings. Advertisers, agencies and stations can't tell from Nielsen pocket pieces whether figures are accurate, he sug- gested. Mr. Richardson: \"I hope all broad- casters know the [Nielsen] sample isn't as represented but 70% or 75% of this. Broadcasters should be put on notice. . . . We advised you last De- cember to publish your actual sizes. Now you are doing it. . . . It took us eight hours in your office to get a sam- ple size.\" Scolded ■ Nielsen witnesses were scolded Thursday by Mr. Richardson for \"unresponsive\" answers to questions about Louisville rating reports and pay of field men. \"We don't want outside opinions or extraneous information,\" he said. \"From now on answer yes or no.\" He added that Nielsen answers made it difficult to produce \"a clear record.\" Mr. Richardson assumed an added role as witness Thursday and was sworn in by the subcommittee, with Rep. Moss presiding. In an exchange about a \"non- responsive\" reply Mr. Rahmel said, \"As God is my judge I thought you were talking about an entirely different thing.\" In his witness role Mr. Richardson introduced data showing an average of around 76% of a Louisville sample he said Nielsen had described as 205. The most severe comments from the subcommittee came Thursday as na- tional and local (mostly Louisville) re- ports were reviewed. Here are several observations: Rep. Brotzman: \"You start out with Louisville's 11 Audimeter reports questioned Nielsen Audimeter reports for Louisville were questioned last week by the House ratings subcommittee. Of the 1 1 Audimeters placed in Louisville homes in 1961 (nine ra- dio, two tv), a substantial number provided information deemed of du- bious value by the House group. Following is a subcommittee staff analysis of the Audimeter informa- tion supplied by 9 of 11 Louisville homes, used in the House hearing to discredit Nielsen reports influ- enced by Audimeter data: Audimeter B.

Younger observed: \"This can be taken as a fair sample of Audi- meters everywhere.\" Rep. Moss: \"These people [whose meters are on 24 hours, for example] mirror you, me and everybody else. What type of person is that. Do peo- ple view around the clock day in and day out? The people in that house never sleep.\" Rep. Younger: \"You sell the record of a machine. You took in $40 million last year [18% of it from broadcasting]. This is one of the instruments you think an advertiser should pay money for — for a listener who goes to sleep with the set on. Advertising agencies want to know the number of listeners. I doubt if any agency would pay much money if it knew of the audience predi- cated on this machine.\" Appraisal ■ Rep. Moss: \"Are these people representative of those who have Audimeters in their homes?\" Mr. Rahmel said they are not, saying the staff excerpted Louisville information to make its point. He proposed a fair ap- praisal of Audimeter homes. Rep. Younger: \"Have Audimeters been removed from these (Louisville) homes?\" Mr. Rahmel said, \"Not to my knowledge.\" Rep. Rogers: \"I have no confidence in information from Audimeters. Yet your weight other material to come in line with Audimeters. This is almost unbelievable. I hope now this commit- tee will get advertising firms in New York to find out what you present to clients and what use they make of these things.\" Mr. Rahmel said that the probers were representing the Louisville reports as an entire Audimeter sample; that they were mixing summer and fall- winter. The staff study showed swift changes and discrepancies in Louisville ratings, with the then McLendon station (WAKY) making a quick jump from seventh to first place and getting a 3,000% increase in national billings, Mr. Richardson said, adding, \"This proved our point.\" He said the city wasn't picked because of any individ- ual station's performance. 36 (LEAD STORY) NO. 1 TARGET continued Secret Formula ■ Reference was made to a memorandum written by Bill Braz- zil (William Brazzil, sales vice presi- dent of WTVJ [TV], Wometco station in Miami.) Counsel and committee members didn't get very far into con- tents of the memo other than to say that Mr. Brazzil had tried to obtain in- formation from Nielsen about reports but had limited success. This led to a discussion of educational criteria of diary homes. Mr. Richardson said staff tabulation of two Nielsen reports showed 60% and 58.3% of the stated sample size was actually available for the computer. Memo by Cordell » Investigators produced a confidential Nielsen memo- Collins's proposal LeRoy Collins, president of the NAB, is expected to recom- mend today (Monday) at the as- sociation's convention in Chicago that the broadcasting industry stop buying and using the present rating services (see page 98). Gov. Collins said last week that he has no confidence in the ac- curacy of the product of the exist- ing rating companies and that he planned to make a \"firm proposal\" for correcting the situation during his luncheon address today. He said that the industry can use to good advantage reliable audience measurements but that it would be better off with nothing than to continue with unreliable data. randum written by Mr. Cordell in March 1962 to board chairman A. C. Nielsen Sr. which the investigators charged showed the company was cov- ering up \"vital weaknesses\" in its opera- tions. Mr. Cordell denied this interpretation and said the memo was an attempt \"by extraordinary means\" to persuade Mr. Nielsen that the company research arm seriously needed improvement. \"I spend half of my life working to improve weaknesses,\" the statistician said. \"I've never obscured anything from them [investigators],\" he added. The portion of the Cordell memo read into the hearing record: \"Government and industry investiga- tions are very important to Nielsen prestige and progress. These have been handled without top management dur- ing past years. \"1. Federal Trade Commission — Wy- coff and Tobin [names of investigators]. \"2. Harris Committee — Sparger and Richardson. \"3.

ARF relations. \"These governmental investigations were trying [annoying] because we pre- ferred not to let these people learn and publish some of our vital weaknesses.\" Probing Weak Points ■ The subcom- mittee tried to pin down the Nielsen firm's \"vital weaknesses.\" Mr. Cordell listed three: 1. failure of radio surveys to measure any but plug-in receivers. 2. delay in building new samples until census statistics are available. 3. small sample size in radio. There were no others of which he was aware, the witness said. \"I must say I'm surprised to find this letter end- ing up in the committee's hands,\" Mr. Cordell said. \"I just wonder if I still have a job.\" Preposterous ■ Rep. Moss said, \"Many of us are approaching the conviction that regulation by ratings is more sig- nificant than regulation by the FCC.\"' It is \"completely preposterous\" to rate the entire nation on Nielsen's small tv sample, Rep. Moss said. Asked how a sample of 365 radio homes in the New York City area could represent listening of 39 am stations when there were average quarter hours showing 36 sets in use, Mr. Cordell said, \"I would judge the better stations do tend to come to the top of the heap.\" He suggested stations that felt a rating report treated them unfairly and thought they had lost business because of it might request a larger sample. \"I probably shouldn't say this,\" Rep. Moss said, \"but I might seek another form of relief.\" Radio Hiatus ■ Mr. Rahmel said the Nielsen firm announced to its clients March 2 that it had discontinued its radio report because larger samples were required and it had not overcome the problem of measuring non-plug-in listening (Broadcasting, March 11). The hearing recessed Thursday and will resume today (Monday). Commit- tee sources said again, as they did two weeks ago, that they hoped the hearing might be concluded \"this week.\" The head of a New York broadcast measurement firm said last week he has supplied the subcommittee with docu- ments that show he had misrepresented his company neither to the staff during its investigations in 1961-62, nor in his testimony in mid-March (Broadcast- ing, March 18). Allan V. Jay, presi- dent of Videodex Inc., said he has for- warded to the subcommittee letters from an advertising agency and from firms with which he had conducted business. Subcommittee sources say they have received Mr. Jay's correspondence. But. they said, Mr. Jay has not requested an opportunity to testify again.

The lambasting, although adminis- tered through the unemotional chan- nels of research, was regarded as the mark of a significant change in RAB's television policy under the new admin- istration of President Edmund C. Bunker. In the past RAB has singled out tele- vision for heavy fire occasionally, and has taken pot-shots at it frequently. The current blast is so much stronger and more concentrated than its usual efforts, however, that there seems no doubt that RAB is now determined to accord tv full recognition as a competitor — its strengths and also its relative weak- nesses. Acknowledge Tv Strength ■ There was nothing in last week's attack to in- dicate that RAB will question televi- sion's force as a major medium. Rath- er, it acknowledged television's strong points while at the same time claiming superiority for radio in basic areas. The blast was contained in a new RAB presentation, but the fuse was lit by Mr. Bunker in a speech last Wednesday, 27 days after he took over the RAB presidency (also see page 40). The presentation, which he excerpted brief- COMPARISON OF RADIO AND TV IMPRESSIONS Number of home impressions weekly * Em m 476,500 Radio Average number of impressions per home per week Tv \\ -1.9 times Radio Number of different homes reached weekly Tv Radio Audience composition per home Tv 80% adults (1.9 viewers per home) Radio 91% adults (1.7 listeners per home) Chart B. — How much more one adver- tiser in one major market could have got with radio than with tv, and at 2,054,900 250,800 (30.2% penetration) 294,600 (33.9% penetration) 10% less cost, is shown by RAB in this chart.
