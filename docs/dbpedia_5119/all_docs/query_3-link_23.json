It seems strange, too, that they chose the NBC show, \"Let's Play Post Office\", over ABC's \"Father Knows Best\" at 12:30. Even with the \"Jeopardy!\" lead-in on the Peacock Network, and a host who'd had some success with a midday game show (Don Morrow with \"Camouflage\") a few years earlier, \"Post Office\" tanked in a hurry; running from Sept. 27, 1965 to July 1, 1966. Channel 3 reminds me of WSB before it became an ABC affiliate; it routinely pre-empted \"Jeopardy!\" (or whatever NBC was carrying at noon) for local news, then pre-empted the 12:30 and 1:30 shows as well, until \"Days Of Our Lives\" went to an hour. The last time, to my knowledge, that WSB carried an NBC show at 12:30 was \"It Could Be You\", which was canceled in December 1961; it would not carry another network show at 12:30 until it got ABC and \"Ryan's Hope\" in 1980.
