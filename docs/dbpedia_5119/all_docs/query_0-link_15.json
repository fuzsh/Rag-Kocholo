        "text": "Town in North Carolina, United States\n\nDallas is a town in Gaston County, North Carolina, United States, and a suburb of Charlotte, located north of Gastonia. The population was 4,488 at the 2010 census.[5] It was named for George M. Dallas, Vice President of the United States under James K. Polk.\n\nGeography\n\nDallas is located approximately four miles north of the city of Gastonia and about 24 miles (39 km) west of Charlotte.

Long Creek is a right tributary of the South Fork Catawba River. Dallas is drained by Long Creek tributaries Dallas Branch and Little Long Creek.[6]\n\nHistory\n\nDallas was officially incorporated in 1863 and is the oldest incorporated town in Gaston County. It served as the original county seat for Gaston County from 1846 until 1911. The old Gaston County courthouse, renovated in 1868 after a fire, still stands in the main square of the town and formerly served as the headquarters of the Dallas Police Department.[7][8] The town government has renovated the courthouse.[9]\n\nDallas began to decline in importance when the town commissioners refused to appropriate money for construction of bridges over several creeks for the Atlanta and Richmond Air-Line Railway in the 1872.[10] The commissioners said the reason was because residents thought that trains would wake them during the night and frighten their livestock.[11] In 1890, White Caps attacked the town \"'Kuklux' style\", destroying entire portions of the town.[12] After this the county seat was relocated to Gastonia in 1911.\n\nThe Dallas Graded and High School, Dallas Historic District, Hoyle House, and Eli Hoyle House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[13]\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1870299—188041739.5%18904415.8%190051416.6%19101,065107.2%19201,39731.2%19301,4896.6%19401,70414.4%19502,45444.0%19603,27033.3%19704,05924.1%19803,340−17.7%19903,012−9.8%20003,40212.9%20104,48831.9%20205,92732.1%\n\n2020 census\n\nDallas racial composition[15] Race Number Percentage White (non-Hispanic) 3,475 58.63% Black or African American (non-Hispanic) 1,277 21.55% Native American 24 0.4% Asian 51 0.86% Pacific Islander 3 0.05% Other/Mixed 297 5.01% Hispanic or Latino 800 13.5%\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 5,927 people, 1,833 households, and 1,158 families residing in the town.\n\n2010 census\n\nAs of the census[4] of 2010, there were 4,488 people, 1,792 households, and 1,195 families residing in the town.
