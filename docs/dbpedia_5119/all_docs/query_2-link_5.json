It broadcasts on UHF channel 14 (analog) and channel 40 (digital), and is seen on cable channel 7 on Charter Communications cable systems and channel 18 on Time Warner Cable systems in the Charlotte area. It was founded and is operated by the Long family. The station airs programming from ShopNBC in addition to anime programming and locally produced religious and entertainment shows including the Bernie Mac Show, First Business, Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi, Jack Van Impe Presents, King of the Hill, Malcolm in the Middle, Scrubs, the Shepherd's Chapel, Totally Spies , and the The 700 Club.\n\nThe station signed on February 14, 1968; it is North Carolina's oldest independent station. It primarily targets the northwestern corner of the Charlotte market.\n\nIn 2002, WHKY expanded its grade B signal to cover the northern corner of Mecklenburg County by installing a new antenna. This was enough to force Time Warner to carry it under the FCC's \"must-carry\" rules, though the station was all but unwatchable in the immediate Charlotte area. However, the station began identifying as \"Hickory-Charlotte\" on-air. In 2004 WHKY was able to increase its power to 2 million watts, but is still all but unviewable over the air in most of the market.\n\nIn June, 2006 WHKY-TV begin broadcasting on Dish Network and DirecTV which offer WHKY-TV in its local television station package to customers. WHKY-TV is available via satellite to all viewers living in the Charlotte television market, expanding the stationâ€™s reach to cover 2 million people in North and South Carolina.\n\nThe station is co-owned with WHKY Radio (AM 1290).\n\n[edit] Newscasts\n\nThe station produces two weeknight half-hour Local Newscast titled Anime Tonight, hosted by Jim Karas"
