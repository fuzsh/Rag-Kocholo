I had not thought of trying TV DX from the Columbiana area. I do know that Greenville FM stations start to fade in between Irmo and Chapin. I have picked up WMUU-94.5 from Harbison Road at Columbiana (back when it was still WMUU). I might get some funny looks from the suburban shoppers in the various parking lots...\n\nWLOS-13 used to get into southeastern Kentucky via translators and even OTA in some places. I picked it up at Pine Mountain State Park in Bell County with just rabbit ears IIRC. At one time they had cable coverage in London, Corbin, Manchester, Harlan, and I want to say Hazard but I'm not 100% sure of that. TV reception in that part of Kentucky has always been a catch-as-catch-can proposition anyway.\n\nAs for your comments about the Newark warehouse in Gaffney, I'll bear that in mind. I thought they might have some kind of \"factory outlet\" there, like Radio Shack did at their Ashley Phosphate location in North Charleston. I snagged an LP-190 there, folded back up and taped together with clear tape --- evidently someone bought it, got disgusted with the assembly, and brought it back --- for something like $20. That antenna served me faithfully for years.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by jetsfan16\n\nVery interesting discussion here. Talking about OOM reception, back in the 80s and 90s WJBF and WRDW actually used to have legit viewership in the Columbia area. That was why WLTX and WOLO were such laggard stations for decades. WCBD and WCSC Charleston also had significant viewership in Orangeburg and even as close in to Columbia as Sumter in the late 80s. WCSC is still carried I believe on Spectrum in Orangeburg.\n\nWIS had no competition in the area except for Augusta NBC (which didn’t even carry news). WCIV was a non-factor.\n\nPeople would watch WRDW for Falcons games back when WLTX had the Washington NFL games pre Panthers.\n\nMuch like what WIS used to be on analog. Except for maybe 4 or 5 counties (Oconee, Greenville, Spartanburg, Charleston and Jasper), WIS could be picked up in every county in the state with a good antenna or on cable. WIS was the NBC in Myrtle Beach with Wilmington’s WECT until WMBF signed on in 2008.\n\n97.5 WCOS is probably the best non-mountain FM signal in SC. WCOS still comes into Charleston probably 50-75% of the time with a decent radio. WWDM 101.3 used to come in all the time here, but there’s a local translator in CHS.\n\nIf you will look at the Television Factbook from the 1960s and 1970s, you can see that any UHF station in South Carolina \"had its work cut out for it\" and took years to build market share. This was no doubt due to less-precise UHF tuners (detent tuners didn't really become a \"thing\" until the late 1970s, before then, you had to tune UHF much like a radio dial, and it would drift) and older TVs not even having UHF, coupled with reception challenges that VHF didn't have. It's not hard to imagine that viewers outside of Richland and Lexington counties would have chosen WIS for NBC, and tuned in VHF affiliates of other networks from adjacent markets that were easier to get. As UHF reception has become easier (it would have made much more sense for DTV to go all-UHF, such as you have in the UK, but as with everything else in the US, I imagine it was as much about money, carving out bandwidth for non-TV services and selling it, as technical considerations), the Columbia market has grown, even though ironically Columbia now has not one, but two, VHF stations, WOLO-10 (digital and PSIP), and WOLO-7 (DTV) and 25 (PSIP). I don't understand, if the repack is basically over, and stations have \"landed\" in the place on the dial that they expect to be for a while, why now-VHF stations such as WOLO don't just adopt their \"real\" VHF channel (a lower, more desirable, more easily remembered number) as their PSIP channel. \"ABC7 Columbia\" has a nice ring to it, they could even use the iconic ABC Circle 7 logo:\n\nMyrtle Beach has always been an \"odd duck\" with regard to TV reception and cable carriage. Due to the flat shoreline topography, Wilmington and Charleston stations are easily available OTA with a decent outdoor antenna, yet MB cable carries no commercial stations from either market. In fact, in the 1980s (I think) MB was in the Wilmington TV market, and WWAY-3 even had a Myrtle Beach bureau in the Flatiron Building downtown, logo on the side of the building and everything. Nowadays, though, it is as if there is some sort of \"iron curtain\" at the NC/SC line, and the MB/Florence and Wilmington markets might as well be in separate countries (exception made for Robeson and Scotland Counties which are in the MBF market). Florence itself has basically lost its commercial TV stations (13/15/21) and they have all become de facto MB stations, WPDE news never indicates the location of its studios, which are in Conway. It is kind of like the way WOLO tried doing its news from WCCB studios in Charlotte (both being Bahakel stations), which fooled nobody and wasn't well-received (no pun intended) with Columbia viewers.\n\nNBC, likewise, was always kind of weird in MB --- you had WECT and WIS as the two cable affiliates, with WCBD curiously left out of the equation. Moreover, syndicated programs that were also aired on MBF stations would be blacked out on the WIS and WECT cable feeds, with color bars and a Chyron blurb about the program having exclusivity in the MBF market.\n\nSo nowadays you have the situation where the in-market MBF channels broadcasting from inland (the 13/15/21 tower farm near South of the Border) are actually harder to get than the Wilmington and Charleston stations, but since they are in-market, they enjoy cable coverage, but stations from the other two markets aren't carried at all on MB cable. It is almost as though an artificial cable market has been created to squeeze out what would otherwise be the \"natural\" choices for viewing in MB. And IIRC, MB cable even carried what is now WCNC-36 when it was independent WRET and later NBC affiliate WPCQ. I also have a vague memory of WSOC-9 being carried on MB cable, but don't quote me on that.\n\nLast edited by IM42A; 03-16-2021 at 07:28 AM.."
