My best reception of Charlotte-area stations is from a group of transmitters located to the west of the city and north of Gastonia, about 73 miles away from me. WBTV and WJZY are usually very reliable, WCNC slightly less so. WMYT is subject to same-channel interference from WKTC in Columbia SC, but I can usually get stable reception by aiming my antenna carefully. I can usually get all four of these stations during the entire day.

The other stations generally come in only at night. WCCB comes in often enough from late spring through fall that I can watch its 10 PM news program most nights, but much less often during dry winter and early spring periods. WSOC comes in about half as often as WCCB, and the rest only occasionally.

WNSC, the South Carolina ETV station in Rock Hill, is fairly close to me and has reasonably high power, but its transmitter has a directional pattern that is relatively weak in my direction, and there are some intervening hills, so I can receive it only at night.

The two UNC-TV stations (WUNE and WUNG) have different subchannel lineups: the same subchannels, but in different sequences. Iâve been told that this has to do with ensuring carriage of the subchannels on cable TV systems.
