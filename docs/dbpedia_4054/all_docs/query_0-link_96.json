        "text": "I forgot! That was my husband's response when I asked where my laminated map of Rome was for our upcoming trip! When my husband went back to the U.S. for a business trip last week, on his list of \"Things to Buy\" was a laminated map of Rome, preferably by DK Eyewitness Travel (like the one above of London), or Streetwise Maps (I have their map of Amsterdam). I am VERY organized when it comes to trips to places where I'm spending a limited time. I had my stickie arrows ready for my new map! My first thought was to head to downtown Utrecht, and try to find one that was in English, but then I thought of my new best friend--Google Maps! Today, I started creating my own custom map for Rome using Google Maps on my iPad--my Tech Tidbits Tuesday.\n\nHere's my map...so far! I'm really quite proud of my creation, and think my hubby will be impressed with what I've done, especially since the stars are all restaurants--yes, we are anticipating with delight all the delicious Italian food we'll be sampling!\n\nBut wait, how did I do this, you ask? Well, just by searching \"Google Maps Custom Map\" I found a great post by bloggers Kevin & Amanda: How to Create a Custom Travel Map with Google Maps {New Google My Maps Tutorial}. No need to reinvent the wheel, they walk you step by step through the process, even showing you how to change the icons and colors of the icons--hence my purple, red, and green stars!\n\nMy husband is a huge fan of pasta, one of our shared favorites when it comes to food. So, when I found this restaurant on Trip Advisor (love that app), had to code it Purple for Pasta! What's great about the map is that after you add a location to the map, all of the details are there, including website, phone number, and address. What I'm jumping for joy about is the ability to add your own notes, as I have, including Trip Advisor ranking, and hours of operation.\n\nNote: I bring up hours of operation since one of the problems we have encountered on our many trips is dinner times. We are accustomed to eating quite late, so one of the things I've started searching for is restaurants with longer opening hours. STREATART seems to fit our needs for a late night meal on our Thursday night arrival!\n\nBut our trip isn't only about food. Visiting the Vatican Museums including the Sistine Chapel is at the top of my list of Things to See, so I quickly booked tickets for the Night Opening, which is available on Fridays from April to October. I added this information to my notes on my map."
