        "text": "Hf isotope compositions In detrital zircons as a new tool for provenance studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJacobsen, Y. J.; MÃ¼nker, C.; Mezger, K.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nIdentifying the provenance of continental sediments is a major issue in palaeo-tectonic studies, providing important information for paleogeographic reconstructions. Isotope studies, e.g. those of whole rock Sm-Nd or detrital zircon U-Pb dating, have widely been used for this purpose. Here we assess the potential of combined Lu-Hf data and U-Pb ages determined on the same single detrital zircons as a new tool for provenance studies. Due to the low Lu/Hf ratios in zircons the Hf isotope composition of a zircon changes insignificantly after its crystallization. Thus each particular grain preserves information on the Hf-siotpe composition of its source and the age of this source. Provided that both the U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope systems have not been disturbed, this information can be used to constrain the sources of each individual zircon. In order to demonstrate the capability of Hf isotope studies on detrital zircons for provenance studies, we obtained combined U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotope data for zircons from the Cambrian Junction Formation in New Zealand. The Junction Formation was deposited on the (present) SE margin of Gondwana near the Australian continent and consists of turbidites, siltstones and conglomerates [1]. Typical continent derived Paleozoic sediments in SE Gondwana generally show characteristic age maxima at 500-600 Ma, 1000-1200 Ma (Grenvillian) and additional older peaks (early Proterozoic to Archean) [2]. We focused on two groups of detrital zircons with Grenvillian and Proterozoic to Late Archean ages. The initial ÉHf values for these zircons range from 0.7 to -15.5 for the Grenvillian and from -5.2 to -14.1 for the Proterozoic/Archean zircons. Corresponding two stage Hf model ages range from ca. 1500 to 2500 Ma for the Grenvillian and from ca. 3200 to 3600 Ma for the Proterozoic/Archean zircons. Furthermore it can be shown that the Grenvillian zircons must have been derived from recycled Grenvillian provinces. Comparison of these Hf model ages\n\nWhat Hf isotopes in zircon tell us about crust-mantle evolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIizuka, Tsuyoshi; Yamaguchi, Takao; Itano, Keita; Hibiya, Yuki; Suzuki, Kazue\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe 176Lu-176Hf radioactive decay system has been widely used to study planetary crust-mantle differentiation. Of considerable utility in this regard is zircon, a resistant mineral that can be precisely dated by the U-Pb chronometer and record its initial Hf isotope composition due to having low Lu/Hf. Here we review zircon U-Pb age and Hf isotopic data mainly obtained over the last two decades and discuss their contributions to our current understanding of crust-mantle evolution, with emphasis on the Lu-Hf isotope composition of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE), early differentiation of the silicate Earth, and the evolution of the continental crust over geologic history. Meteorite zircon encapsulates the most primitive Hf isotope composition of our solar system, which was used to identify chondritic meteorites best representative of the BSE (176Hf/177Hf = 0.282793 Â± 0.000011; 176Lu/177Hf = 0.0338 Â± 0.0001). Hadean-Eoarchean detrital zircons yield highly unradiogenic Hf isotope compositions relative to the BSE, providing evidence for the development of a geochemically enriched silicate reservoir as early as 4.5 Ga. By combining the Hf and O isotope systematics, we propose that the early enriched silicate reservoir has resided at depth within the Earth rather than near the surface and may represent a fractionated residuum of a magma ocean underlying the proto-crust, like urKREEP beneath the anorthositic crust on the Moon. Detrital zircons from world major rivers potentially provide the most robust Hf isotope record of the preserved granitoid crust on a continental scale, whereas mafic rocks with various emplacement ages offer an opportunity to trace the Hf isotope evolution of juvenile continental crust (from ÎµHf[4.5 Ga] = 0 to ÎµHf[present] = + 13). The river zircon data as compared to the juvenile crust composition highlight that the supercontinent cycle has controlled the evolution of the continental crust by regulating the rates of crustal generation and intra\n\nDo Hf isotopes in magmatic zircons represent those of their host rocks?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Di; Wang, Xiao-Lei; Cai, Yue; Goldstein, Steven L.; Yang, Tao\n\n2018-04-01\n\nLu-Hf isotopic system in zircon is a powerful and widely used geochemical tracer in studying petrogenesis of magmatic rocks and crustal evolution, assuming that zircon Hf isotopes can represent initial Hf isotopes of their parental whole rock. However, this assumption may not always be valid. Disequilibrium partial melting of continental crust would preferentially melt out non-zircon minerals with high time-integrated Lu/Hf ratios and generate partial melts with Hf isotope compositions that are more radiogenic than those of its magma source. Dissolution experiments (with hotplate, bomb and sintering procedures) of zircon-bearing samples demonstrate this disequilibrium effect where partial dissolution yielded variable and more radiogenic Hf isotope compositions than fully dissolved samples. A case study from the Neoproterozoic Jiuling batholith in southern China shows that about half of the investigated samples show decoupled Hf isotopes between zircons and the bulk rocks. This decoupling could reflect complex and prolonged magmatic processes, such as crustal assimilation, magma mixing, and disequilibrium melting, which are consistent with the wide temperature spectrum from â¼630 Â°C to â¼900 Â°C by Ti-in-zircon thermometer. We suggest that magmatic zircons may only record the Hf isotopic composition of their surrounding melt during crystallization and it is uncertain whether their Hf isotopic compositions can represent the primary Hf isotopic compositions of the bulk magmas. In this regard, using zircon Hf isotopic compositions to trace crustal evolution may be biased since most of these could be originally from disequilibrium partial melts.\n\nResolution, the key to unlocking granite petrogenesis using zircon U-Pb - Lu-Hf studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTapster, Simon; Horstwood, Matthew; Roberts, Nick M. W.; Deady, Eimear; Shail, Robin\n\n2017-04-01\n\nCoarse-scale understanding of crustal evolution and source contributions to igneous systems has been drastically enhanced by coupled zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf data sets. These are now common place and potentially offer advantages over whole-rock analyses by resolving heterogeneous source components in the complex crystal cargos of single hand-samples. However, the application of coupled zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf studies to address detailed petrogenetic questions faces a crisis of resolution - On the one hand, micro-beam analytical techniques have high spatial resolution, capable of interrogating crystals with complex growth histories. Yet, the >1-2% temporal resolution of these techniques places a fundamental limitation on their utility for developing petrogenetic models. This limitation in data interpretation arises from timescales of crystal recycling or changes in source evolution that are often shorter than the U-Pb analytical precision. Conversely, high-precision CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb analysis of single whole zircons and solution MC-ICP-MS Lu-Hf isotopes of column washes (Hf masses equating to ca. 10-50 ng) have much greater temporal resolution (<0.1%), yet lack the spatial resolution to deal with complex crystal growth. Analyses homogenize any heterogeneity within the zircon and convolute the petrogenetic model. A balance must be struck between spatial and temporal resolution to address petrogenetic issues. Here, we demonstrate that micro-sampling of complex xenocryst-rich zircon crystals (e.g. <40 Âµm zircon tips) from the granitic post-Variscan Cornubian Batholith (SW England), in tandem with low-common Pb blank CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb chemistry, permits the analysis of zircon volumes that approach those of LA-ICPMS analyses, whilst simultaneously retaining the majority of the temporal resolution associated with the CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb technique. The low volume of zircon within these analyses may only provide <5 ng Hf, and therefore gaining useful precision from Lu-Hf isotopes is\n\nU-Pb ages and Hf isotope compositions of zircons in plutonic rocks from the central Famatinian arc, Argentina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOtamendi, Juan E.; Ducea, Mihai N.; Cristofolini, Eber A.; Tibaldi, Alina M.; Camilletti, Giuliano C.; Bergantz, George W.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe Famatinian arc formed around the South Iapetus rim during the Ordovician, when oceanic lithosphere subducted beneath the West Gondwana margin. We present combined in situ U-Th-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope analyses for zircon to gain insights into the origin and evolution of Famatinian magmatism. Zircon crystals sampled from four intermediate and silicic plutonic rocks confirm previous observations showing that voluminous magmatism took place during a relatively short pulse between the Early and Middle Ordovician (472-465 Ma). The entire zircon population for the four plutonic rocks yields coherent ÎµHf negative values and spreads over several ranges of initial ÎµHf(t) units (-0.3 to -8.0). The range of ÎµHf units in detrital zircons of Famatinian metasedimentary rocks reflects a prolonged history of the cratonic sources during the Proterozoic to the earliest Phanerozoic. Typical tonalites and granodiorites that contain zircons with evolved Hf isotopic compositions formed upon incorporating (meta)sedimentary materials into calc-alkaline metaluminous magmas. The evolved Hf isotope ratios of zircons in the subduction related plutonic rocks strongly reflect the Hf isotopic character of the metasedimentary contaminant, even though the linked differentiation and growth of the Famatinian arc crust was driven by ascending and evolving mantle magmas. Geochronology and Hf isotope systematics in plutonic zircons allow us understanding the petrogenesis of igneous series and the provenance of magma sources. However, these data could be inadequate for computing model ages and supporting models of crustal evolution.\n\nZircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic compositions indicate multiple sources for Grenvillian detrital zircon deposited in western Laurentia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoward, Amanda L.; Farmer, G. Lang; Amato, Jeffrey M.; Fedo, Christopher M.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nCombined U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data from 1.0 Ga to 1.3 Ga (Grenvillian) detrital zircon in Neoproterozoic and Cambrian siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in southwest North America, and from igneous zircon in potential Mesoproterozoic source rocks, are used to better assess the provenance of detrital zircon potentially transported across Laurentia in major river systems originating in the Grenville orogenic highlands. High-precision hafnium isotopic analyses of individual â¼1.1 Ga detrital zircon from Neoproterozoic siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in Sonora, northern Mexico, reveal that these zircons have low ÎµHf (0) (-22 to -26) and were most likely derived from â¼1.1 Ga granitic rocks embedded in local Mojave Province Paleoproterozoic crust. In contrast, Grenvillian detrital zircons in Cambrian sedimentary rocks in Sonora, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert, have generally higher ÎµHf (0) (-15 to -21) as demonstrated both by high precision solution-based, and by lower precision laser ablation, ICPMS data and were likely derived from more distal sources further to the east/southeast in Laurentia. Comparison to new and existing zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopic data from Grenvillian crystalline rocks from the Appalachian Mountains, central and west Texas, and from Paleoproterozoic terranes throughout southwest North America reveals that zircon in Cambrian sandstones need not entirely represent detritus transported across the continent from Grenville province rocks in the vicinity of the present-day southern Appalachian Mountains. Instead, these zircons could have been derived from more proximal, high ÎµHf (0), â¼1.1 Ga, crystalline rocks such as those exposed today in the Llano Uplift in central Texas and in the Franklin Mountains of west Texas. Regardless of the exact source(s) of the Grenvillian detrital zircon, new and existing whole-rock Nd isotopic data from Neoproterozoic to Cambrian siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in the Mojave Desert\n\nTracking magmatic processes through Zr/Hf ratios in rocks and Hf and Ti zoning in zircons: An example from the Spirit Mountain batholith, Nevada\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLowery, Claiborne L.E.; Miller, C.F.; Walker, B.A.; Wooden, J.L.; Mazdab, F.K.; Bea, F.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nZirconium and Hf are nearly identical geochemically, and therefore most of the crust maintains near-chondritic Zr/Hf ratios of ???35-40. By contrast, many high-silica rhyolites and granites have anomalously low Zr/Hf (15-30). As zircon is the primary reservoir for both Zr and Hf and preferentially incorporates Zr, crystallization of zircon controls Zr/ Hf, imprinting low Zr/Hf on coexisting melt. Thus, low Zr/Hf is a unique fingerprint of effective magmatic fractionation in the crust. Age and compositional zonation in zircons themselves provide a record of the thermal and compositional histories of magmatic systems. High Hf (low Zr/ Hf) in zircon zones demonstrates growth from fractionated melt, and Ti provides an estimate of temperature of crystallization (TTiZ) (Watson and Harrison, 2005). Whole-rock Zr/Hf and zircon zonation in the Spirit Mountain batholith, Nevada, document repeated fractionation and thermal fluctuations. Ratios of Zr/Hf are ???30-40 for cumulates and 18-30 for high-SiO2 granites. In zircons, Hf (and U) are inversely correlated with Ti, and concentrations indicate large fluctuations in melt composition and TTiZ (>100??C) for individual zircons. Such variations are consistent with field relations and ion-probe zircon geochronology that indicate a >1 million year history of repeated replenishment, fractionation, and extraction of melt from crystal mush to form the low Zr/Hf high-SiO2 zone. ?? 2006 The Mineralogical Society.\n\nSmall Volume Isotopic Analysis of Zircon Using LA-MC-ICP-MS U-Pb and Lu-Hf and Sub-ng Amounts of Hf in Solution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBauer, A.; Horstwood, M. S.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nCrust-mantle evolution studies are greatly informed by zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic datasets and the ease with which these data can now be acquired has seen their application become commonplace. In order to deconvolute geochemical change and interpret geologic variation in complexly zoned zircons, this information is most ideally obtained on the smallest volume of zircon by successive SIMS U-Pb and LA-MC-ICP-MS Lu-Hf isotopic analyses. However, due to variations in zircon growth zone geometry at depth, the Lu-Hf analysis may not relate to the lower volume U-Pb analysis, potentially causing inaccuracy of the resultant age-corrected Hf isotope signature. Laser ablation split-stream methods are applied to be certain that U-Pb and Lu-Hf data represent the same volume of zircon, however, the sampling volume remains relatively large at 40x30Âµm1. Coupled ID-TIMS U-Pb and solution MC-ICP-MS Lu-Hf work traditionally utilize whole-zircon dissolution ( 10-50ng Hf), which has the potential to homogenize different zones of geologic significance within an analysis. Conversely, modern ID-TIMS U-Pb methods utilize microsampling of zircon grains, often providing < 5ng Hf, thereby challenging conventional Lu-Hf acquisition protocols to achieve the required precision. In order to obtain usable precision on minimal zircon volumes, we developed laser ablation methods using successive 25um spot U-Pb and Lu-Hf ablation pits with a combined depth of 18um, and low-volume solution introduction methods without Hf-REE separation utilizing Hf amounts as low as 0.4ng, while retaining an uncertainty level of ca. 1 ÉHf for both methods. We investigated methods of Yb interference correction and the potential for matrix effects, with a particular focus on the accurate quantification of 176Lu/177Hf. These improvements reduce the minimum amount of material required for U-Pb and Hf isotopic analysis of zircon by about an order of magnitude. 1Ibanez-Mejia et al (2015).

M.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nIt is not commonly recognized as such, but the accurate measurement of Hf in zircon is not a trivial analytical issue. This is important to assess because Hf is often used as an internal standard for trace element analyses of zircon by LA-ICPMS. The issues pertaining to accuracy revolve around: (1) whether the Hf Ma or the La line is used; (2) what accelerating voltage is applied if Zr La is also measured, and (3) what standard for Hf is used. Weidenbach, et al.'s (2004) study of the 91500 zircon demonstrated the spread (in accuracy) of possible EPMA values for six EPMA labs, 2 of which used Hf Ma, 3 used Hf La, and one used Hf Lb, and standards ranged from HfO2, a ZrO2-HfO2 compound, Hf metal, and hafnon. Weidenbach, et al., used the ID-TIMS values as the correct value (0.695 wt.% Hf.), for which not one of the EPMA labs came close to that value (3 were low and 3 were high). Those data suggest: (1) that there is a systematic underestimation error of the 0.695 wt% Hf (ID-TIMS Hf) value if Hf Ma is used; most likely an issue with the matrix correction, as the analytical lines and absorption edges of Zr La, Si Ka and Hf Ma are rather tightly packed in the electromagnetic spectrum. Mass absorption coefficients are easily in error (e.g., Donovan's determination of the MAC of Hf by Si Ka of 5061 differs from the typically used Henke value of 5449 (Donovan et al, 2002); and (2) For utilization of the Hf La line, however, the second order Zr Ka line interferes with Hf La if the accelerating voltage is greater than 17.99 keV. If this higher keV is used and differential mode PHA is applied, only a portion of the interference is removed (e.g., removal of escape peaks), causing an overestimation of Hf content. Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to apply an interference correction in this case, as it is impossible to locate Hf-free Zr probe standard. We have examined many of the combinations used by those six EPMA labs and concluded that the optimal EPMA is done with Hf\n\nZircon (Hf, O isotopes) as melt indicator: Melt infiltration and abundant new zircon growth within melt rich layers of granulite-facies lenses versus solid-state recrystallization in hosting amphibolite-facies gneisses (central Erzgebirge, Bohemian Massif)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTichomirowa, Marion; Whitehouse, Martin; Gerdes, Axel; Schulz, Bernhard\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn the central Erzgebirge within the Bohemian Massif, lenses of high pressure and ultrahigh pressure felsic granulites occur within meta-sedimentary and meta-igneous amphibolite-facies felsic rocks. In the felsic granulite, melt rich parts and restite form alternating layers, and were identified by petrology and bulk rock geochemistry. Mineral assemblages representing the peak P-T conditions were best preserved in melanocratic restite layers. In contrast, in the melt rich leucocratic layers, garnet and related HP minerals as kyanite are almost completely resorbed. Both layers display differences in accessory minerals: melanosomes have frequent and large monazite and Fe-Ti-minerals but lack xenotime and apatite; leucosomes have abundant apatite and xenotime while monazite is rare. Here we present a detailed petrographic study of zircon grains (abundance, size, morphology, inclusions) in granulite-facies and amphibolite-facies felsic gneisses, along with their oxygen and hafnium isotope compositions. Our data complement earlier Usbnd Pb ages and trace element data (REE, Y, Hf, U) on zircons from the same rocks (Tichomirowa et al., 2005). Our results show that the degree of melting determines the behaviour of zircon in different layers of the granulites and associated amphibolite-facies rocks. In restite layers of the granulite lenses, small, inherited, and resorbed zircon grains are preserved and new zircon formation is very limited. In contrast, new zircons abundantly grew in the melt rich leucocratic layers. In these layers, the new zircons (Usbnd Pb age, trace elements, Hf, O isotopes) best preserve the information on peak metamorphic conditions due to intense corrosion of other metamorphic minerals. The new zircons often contain inherited cores. Compared to cores, the new zircons and rims show similar or slightly lower Hf isotope values, slightly higher Hf model ages, and decreased oxygen isotope ratios. The isotope compositions (Hf, O) of new zircons indicate\n\nOrigin of zircon-bearing mantle eclogites entrained in the V. Grib kimberlite (Arkhangelsk region, NW Russia): Evidence from mineral geochemistry and the U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope compositions of zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShchukina, Elena V.; Agashev, Alexey M.; Zedgenizov, Dmitry A.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe concentrations of major and trace elements in minerals, reconstructed whole-rock compositions of zircon-bearing equigranular eclogites from the V. Grib kimberlite pipe located within the Arkhangelsk Diamondiferous Province (North-Western Russia), and results of the U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope analyses of zircon grains from eclogites and granulite xenoliths are reported. These data suggest that the equigranular eclogites could represent the fragments of mid-ocean-ridge basalt that were metamorphosed during Paleoproterozoic subduction at 1.7-1.9 Ga. The Hf isotope compositions of the eclogitic zircon display uniformity and indicate corresponding Hf-depleted mantle model ages of 2.2-2.3 Ga. The formation of zircon in eclogites could have resulted from interactions with metasomatic/subduction-related fluids just prior to, but associated with, Paleoproterozoic eclogite formation. A link between eclogitic zircon formation and continental lower-crustal rocks can be excluded based on differences in the Hf isotope compositions of eclogitic and granulitic zircon grains. The U-Pb upper intercept age of granulitic zircon of 2716 Â± 61 Ma provides a new minimum age constraint for zircon crystallisation and granulite formation. The U-Pb ages obtained from granulitic zircon show two stages of Pb loss at 2.2-2.6 Ga and 1.7-2.0 Ga. The late Paleoproterozoic stage of Pb loss recorded in granulitic zircon is due to the intensive reworking of basement crustal rocks, which was caused by a tectonic process/subduction event associated with equigranular eclogite formation. Our data, along with evidence previously obtained from the V. Grib pipe coarse-granular eclogites, show at least two main subduction events in the lithospheric mantle of the Arkhangelsk region: the Archean (2.8 Ga) and Paleoproterozoic (1.7-1.9 Ga) subductions, which correspond to major magmatic and metamorphic events in the Baltic Shield.\n\nNew Hf isotope data from the Jack Hills zircons: constraints on the Hadean crustal evolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAmelin, Y.; Davis, D.; Lee, D.\n\n2004-05-01\n\nHere we present a follow-up of our study of the \"older\" population of detrital zircons from the Jack Hills metaconglomerate W-74 [1]. We report Lu-Hf data for zircon grains, which have been previously analyzed with a number of techniques: BSE and CL imaging, detailed U-Pb SHRIMP geochronology, trace element concentrations, and oxygen isotopic compositions. After completion of non-destructive SIMS analyses and imaging, the zircons were extracted from the mounts, dissolved and analyzed for U-Pb and Lu-Hf using isotope dilution. Twenty five grains were air abraded before digestion, and eight grains were digested without abrasion. Four grains were cut, and the fragments were analyzed for U-Pb and Lu-Hf separately. The 207Pb/206Pb ages determined by isotope dilution vary between 3788-4186 Ma; the maximum SHRIMP spot 207Pb/206Pb ages of the same grains are between 3871-4276 Ma. The spot 207Pb/206Pb ages averaged over each grain are close to the whole grain isotope dilution values. The U-Pb discordance depends mainly on whether the grains were abraded: the median discordance of 27 abraded grains and fragments is 2.7 (the range is -0.4 to 20.2), whereas the median discordance of 11 unabraded grains and fragments is 66.5 (the range is 20.5 to 83.5). The epsilon176Hf values, calculated using the whole grain TIMS 207Pb/206Pb ages and the 176Lu decay constant of 1.865*10-11, are between -1.4 and -10.6. Using maximum SHRIMP spot 207Pb/206Pb ages and the same decay constant yields the range of epsilon176Hf of 0.1 to -8.6. If the decay constant of 1.983*10-11 is used instead, then the range of epsilon176Hf becomes 4.7 to -5.0 using the whole grain ages, or 6.3 to -3.0 using the maximum SHRIMP spot ages. Grain fragment analyses show internal variations of initial 176Hf/177Hf in three grains out of five. This observation is consistent with multi-episodic zircon growth rather than with ancient Pb loss. In the presentation we shall discuss the prospect of reliable interpretation of\n\nGHR1 - A new Eocene natural reference material for U-Pb and Hf isotopic measurements in zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIbanez-Mejia, M.; Eddy, M. P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe present chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionization (CA-ID-TIMS) U-Pb zircon geochronology and solution multicollector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) Hf isotopic data from a proposed natural zircon reference material for use during in situ analyses of U-Pb and Hf isotopic ratios. The sample, GHR1, was collected from the rapakivi intrusive phase of the Eocene Golden Horn batholith in Washington, USA. Zircons separated from this sample range up to 250-300 Î¼m in length and have moderate aspect ratios. A weighted mean of 15 Th-corrected 206Pb/238U zircon dates from GHR1 produced at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is 48.132 Â± 0.023 Ma (2Ï analytical and tracer uncertainties only, MSWD=1.70) confirming that there is little or no inter-crystal age heterogeneity at the scale of a few 10 kyr. Solution MC-ICP-MS measurements of chemically purified aliquots give a 176Hf/177Hf weighted mean of 0.283050 Â± 17 (2Ï, n=10), corresponding to a ÉHf0 of ca. +9.3. The 2Ï variability of these measurements is comparable to our reproducibility of the JMC-475 Hf isotopic standard 0.282160 Â± 14 (n= 13), suggesting that GHR1 zircons are homogenous with respect to 176Hf/177Hf. In situ 206Pb/238U dates from collaborating secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP), and laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) laboratories are in excellent agreement with the CA-ID-TIMS date and illustrate the reproducibility and potential value of this reference zircon. The mean values of 176Hf/177Hf measurements from two LA-ICP-MS laboratories are in agreement with the solution MC-ICP-MS value, but show slightly greater dispersion and higher (Lu+Yb)/Hf values. We attribute this discrepancy to apatite inclusions that are high in REE and may lead to greater isobaric interferences on 176Hf. These inclusions and potential isobaric interferences from REE were removed during the chemical abrasion step prior to bulk\n\nUsing the magmatic record to constrain the growth of continental crust-The Eoarchean zircon Hf record of Greenland\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFisher, Christopher M.; Vervoort, Jeffrey D.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nSouthern West Greenland contains some of the best-studied and best-preserved magmatic Eoarchean rocks on Earth, and these provide an excellent vantage point from which to view long-standing questions regarding the growth of the earliest continental crust. In order to address the questions surrounding early crustal growth and complementary mantle depletion, we present Laser Ablation Split Stream (LASS) analyses of the U-Pb and Hf isotope compositions of zircon from eleven samples of the least-altered meta-igneous rocks from the Itsaq (AmÃ®tsoq) Gneisses of the Isukasia and Nuuk regions of southern West Greenland. This analytical technique allows a less ambiguous approach to determining the age and Hf isotope composition of complicated zircon. Results corroborate previous findings that Eoarchean zircon from the Itsaq Gneiss (â¼3.85 Ga to â¼3.63 Ga) were derived from a broadly chondritic source. In contrast to the Sm-Nd whole rock isotope record for southern West Greenland, the zircon Lu-Hf isotope record provides no evidence for early mantle depletion, nor does it suggest the presence of crust older than â¼3.85 Ga in Greenland. Utilizing LASS U-Pb and Hf data from the Greenland zircons studied here, we demonstrate the importance of focusing on the magmatic (rather than detrital) zircon record to more confidently understand early crustal growth and mantle depletion. We compare the Greenland Hf isotope data with other Eoarchean magmatic complexes such as the Acasta Gneiss Complex, Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt, and the gneissic complexes of southern Africa, and all lack zircons with suprachondritic Hf isotope compositions. In total, these data suggest only a very modest volume of crust was produced during (or survived from) the Hadean and earliest Eoarchean. There remains no record of planet-scale early Earth mantle depletion in the Hf isotope record prior to 3.8 Ga.\n\nChemical evolution of Himalayan leucogranites based on an O, U-Pb and Hf study of zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHopkinson, Thomas N.; Warren, Clare J.; Harris, Nigel B. W.; Hammond, Samantha J.; Parrish, Randall R.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nCrustal melting is a characteristic process at convergent plate margins, where crustal rocks are heated and deformed. Miocene leucogranite sheets and plutons are found intruded into the high-grade metasedimentary core (the Greater Himalayan Sequence, GHS) across the Himalayan orogen. Previously-published Himalayan whole-rock data suggest that these leucogranites formed from a purely meta-sedimentary source, isotopically similar to those into which they now intrude. Bulk rock analyses carry inherent uncertainties, however: they may hide contributions from different contributing sources, and post-crystallization processes such as fluid interaction may significantly alter the original chemistry. In contrast, zircon is more able to retain precise information of the contributing sources of the melt from which it crystallises whilst its resistant nature is impervious to post-magmatic processes. This multi-isotope study of Oligocene-Miocene leucogranite zircons from the Bhutan Himalaya, seeks to differentiate between various geochemical processes that contribute to granite formation. Hf and O isotopes are used to detect discrete changes in melt source while U-Pb isotopes provide the timing of zircon crystallisation. Our data show that zircon rims of Himalayan age yield Hf-O signatures that lie within the previously reported whole-rock GHS field, confirming the absence of a discernible mantle contribution to the leucogranite source. Importantly, we document a decrease in the minimum ÉHf values during Himalayan orogenesis through time, correlating to a change in Hf model age from 1.4 Ga to 2.4 Ga. Nd model ages for the older Lesser Himalayan metasediments (LHS) that underthrust the GHS are significantly older than those for the GHS (2.4-2.9 Ga compared with 1.4-2.2 Ga), and as such even minor contributions of LHS material incorporated into a melt would significantly increase the resulting Hf model age. Hence our leucogranite data suggest either a change of source within\n\nMeteorite zircon constraints on the bulk Lu-Hf isotope composition and early differentiation of the Earth.\n\nPubMed\n\nIizuka, Tsuyoshi; Yamaguchi, Takao; Hibiya, Yuki; Amelin, Yuri\n\n2015-04-28\n\nKnowledge of planetary differentiation is crucial for understanding the chemical and thermal evolution of terrestrial planets. The (176)Lu-(176)Hf radioactive decay system has been widely used to constrain the timescales and mechanisms of silicate differentiation on Earth, but the data interpretation requires accurate estimation of Hf isotope evolution of the bulk Earth. Because both Lu and Hf are refractory lithophile elements, the isotope evolution can be potentially extrapolated from the present-day (176)Hf/(177)Hf and (176)Lu/(177)Hf in undifferentiated chondrite meteorites. However, these ratios in chondrites are highly variable due to the metamorphic redistribution of Lu and Hf, making it difficult to ascertain the correct reference values for the bulk Earth. In addition, it has been proposed that chondrites contain excess (176)Hf due to the accelerated decay of (176)Lu resulting from photoexcitation to a short-lived isomer. If so, the paradigm of a chondritic Earth would be invalid for the Lu-Hf system. Herein we report the first, to our knowledge, high-precision Lu-Hf isotope analysis of meteorite crystalline zircon, a mineral that is resistant to metamorphism and has low Lu/Hf.

S.; Gerdes, A.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Lu-Hf isotope systematics of zircon from the gabbro-plagiogranite association (gabbro, diorite, tonalite, and plagiogranite), which is one of the most typical associations of igneous rocks in the Urals, was studied for the first time. The isotope study yielded a unified age limit of 433 Ma, which corresponds to the time of formation of this rock association. The younger \"rejuvenated\" ages characterize superimposed thermal impact events, induced by the volcanic arc activity, as well as collisional and postcollisional processes. Here, the initial 176Hf/177Hf( t) ratio in the studied zircon from gabbro and plagiogranite corresponds in fact to a highly LILE-depleted (DM) mantle.\n\nLu-Hf systematics of magmatic zircons reveal a Proterozoic crustal boundary under the Cretaceous Pioneer batholith, Montana\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFoster, David A.; Mueller, Paul A.; Heatherington, Ann; Gifford, Jennifer N.; Kalakay, Thomas J.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nLu-Hf systematics of magmatic zircons from quartz diorite and granodiorite plutons of the Late Cretaceous Pioneer batholith, Montana, indicate involvement of distinctly different crustal sources in the petrogensis of individual components of the batholith. Plutons of the eastern Pioneer batholith contain magmatic zircons with initial ÉHf values of - 28 to - 34 that crystallized in magmas likely derived from dominantly Archean and earliest Paleoproterozoic crust. Contemporaneous granodiorite in the western Pioneer batholith contains magmatic zircons with initial ÉHf values ranging from - 9 to - 33, but dominated by values between - 18 and - 22, which suggest a mixture of Paleoproterozoic and possible Mesoproterozoic sources. These data suggest that distinct segments of crust juxtaposed and produced during formation of the Great Falls tectonic zone (1.78-1.86 Ga) and the Belt basin (~ 1.43-1.47 Ga) contributed to magmatic compositions in the batholith and that these contributions are recorded in the magmatic zircons. The contrasting ÉHf distributions between eastern and western components of the Pioneer batholith suggest that an important crustal and/or lithospheric boundary underlies the Pioneer batholith. The Hf-isotopic results also suggest that the high P-wave velocity lower crust of the northern Rocky Mountains did not form in a single event.\n\nZircon U-Pb age and Hf-O isotopes of felsic rocks from the Atlantis Bank, Southwest Indian Ridge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, C. Z.; Zhang, W. Q.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHole U1473A was drilled to 790 meters below seafloor on the Atlantis Bank, an oceanic core complex in the Southwest Indian Ridge, where the upper crust has been removed by detachment faulting. The recovered core consists dominantly of olivine gabbro, with subordinate gabbro, gabbro with varying Fe-Ti oxide concentrations. Felsic veins intermittently occur throughout the whole core section. Zircons separated from twenty-four felsic samples have been conducted for U-Pb dating and O isotope analyses on the Cameca 1280 and Lu-Hf isotopes by laser ablation coupled with a MC-ICPMS. The zircons have highly variable contents of U (12-2078 ppm) and Th (5-801 ppm), yielding Th/U ratios of 0.33-0.81. They are typical oceanic zircons as defined by the trace element discrimination plots of Grimes et al. (2015). The weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages of the analyzed zircons vary from 11.29 to 12.57 Ma. Age differences between felsic veins throughout the whole core are not resolved within analytical uncertainty of the SIMS measurements. All felsic samples have similar zircon Hf isotope compositions, with initial 176Hf/177Hf ratios of 0.283126-0.283197 and ÉHf values of 12.76-15.27. Zircons from all felsic samples but one have mantle-like Î´18O values of 5.14-5.50â°. Zircons from one sample show partial resorption or total recrystallization; in comparison, they have lower Î´18O values of 4.81Â±0.21â°. Such characteristics provide clear evidence for hydrothermal alteration after magmatic intrusion.\n\nZircon U-Pb ages and Hf-O isotopic composition of migmatites from the Zanjan-Takab complex, NW Iran: Constraints on partial melting of metasediments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoghadam, Hadi Shafaii; Li, Xian-Hua; Stern, Robert J.; Ghorbani, Ghasem; Bakhshizad, Farzaneh\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe study migmatites and other metamorphic rocks in the Zanjan-Takab region of NW Iran and use these results to report the first evidence of Oligocene core complex formation in Iran. Four samples of migmatites associated with paragneisses, including leucosomes and associated para-amphibolite melanosomes were selected for U-Pb dating and Hf-O isotopic analysis. Zircon cores - interpreted as originally detrital zircons - have variable ages that peak at ca. 100-110 Ma, but their sedimentation age - indicated by the youngest 206Pb/238U ages - is ca. 35-40 Ma. New zircons associated with incipient melting occur as overgrowths around zircon cores and/or as newly grown grains. Morphologies and internal structures suggest that rim growth and formation of new zircons were associated with partial melting. All four samples contain zircons with rims that yield 206Pb/238U ages of 28-25 Ma, indicating that partial melting occurred in Late Oligocene time. Î´18O values for zircon rims vary between 8.2 and 12.3â°, significantly higher than expected for mantle inputs (Î´18O 6â°) and consistent with equilibrium with surface materials. Zircon rims yield ÎµHf(t) between 2.2 and 12.4 and two-stage Hf model ages of 448-562 Ma, indicating that the region is underlain by Cadomian-Caledonian crust. According to the Hf-O isotopic values, the main mechanism forming zircon rims was dissolution of pre-existing detrital zircons with reprecipitation of new zircon shortly thereafter. Oligocene ages indicate that partial melting accompanied core complex formation in the Zanjan-Takab region. Extension, melting, and core complex formation in south-central Iran are Eocene in age, but younger ages of Oligocene-Miocene in NW Iran and Turkey indicate that extension was distributed throughout the region during Cenozoic time.\n\nThe formation and rejuvenation of continental crust in the central North China Craton: Evidence from zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Qing; Santosh, M.; Li, Sheng-Rong; Guo, Pu\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe Trans-North China Orogen (TNCO) along the central part of the North China Craton (NCC) is considered as a Paleoproterozoic suture along which the Eastern and Western Blocks of the NCC were amalgamated. Here we investigate the Precambrian crustal evolution history in the Fuping segment of the TNCO and the subsequent reactivation associated with extensive craton destruction during Mesozoic. We present zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb and Lu-Hf data on TTG (tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite) gneiss, felsic orthogneiss, amphibolite and granite from the Paleoproterozoic suite which show magmatic ages in the range of 2450-1900 Ma suggesting a long-lived convergent margin. The ÎµHf(t) values of these zircons range from -11.9 to 12 and their model ages suggest magma derivation from both juvenile components and reworked Archean crust. The Mesozoic magmatic units in the Fuping area includes granite, diorite and mafic microgranular enclaves, the zircons from which define a tight range of 120-130 Ma ages suggesting a prominent Early Cretaceous magmatic event. However, the ÎµHf(t) values of these zircons show wide a range from -30.3 to 0.2, indicating that the magmatic activity involved extensive rejuvenation of the older continental crust.\n\nZircon and baddeleyite from the economic ultramafic-mafic Noril'sk-1 intrusion (Russia): Hf-isotope constraints on source composition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMalitch, K.

L.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nof the Noril'sk-1 intrusion, which served as the favorable factor for accumulation of ores of unique scales and concentrations, To test this hypothesis, in situ Hf-isotope data were collected on the dated spots within single zircon grains. The analysis used a New Wave LUV213 laser-ablation microprobe attached to a Nu plasma MC-ICP-MS at GEMOC (Griffin et al. 2002). Hf-isotope results grouped on the basis of lithology show notable differences. Zircons from the unmineralized 'layered rock sequence' (e.g., olivine-free gabbro, olivine-bearing gabbro and olivine gabbro) are characterized by the most 'radiogenic' initial 176Hf/177Hf and some of ÉHf values close to those of the Depleted Mantle. Irrespective of zircon population most radiogenic Hf-isotope compositions are typical for olivine-free gabbro (mean ÉHf 7.3 Â± 1.1 for sample N1-4), olivine-bearing gabbro (9.2 Â± 3.8, sample N1-5) and olivine gabbro (8.3 Â± 2.0, sample N1-6). In contrast, zircons from the leucogabbro that encloses the low-sulphide horizon (N1-3), and plagiowehrlite (N1-7) and taxitic-textured rocks (N1-8 and N1-9) with disseminated sulphide ores have less radiogenic Hf-isotope values (e.g., mean ÉHf6.2 Â± 1.4, 5.9 Â± 2.3, 6.4 Â± 1.2 and 4.9Â±1.4, respectively). The least radiogenic values (ÉHffrom -2.9 to +2.3, mean ÉHf = 0.1 Â± 1.9) are recorded in gabbro-diorite from the upper part of intrusion. The baddeleyite from olivine-free gabbro has the narrowest range of ÉHf values (e.g. 6.8-8.4), with a mean of ÉHfof 7.6 Â± 0.8, closely matching that of zircon (mean ÉHf= 7.3 Â± 1.1). Zircons from the leucogabbro that hosts the low-sulphide horizon (N1-3), and ultramafic and taxitic-textured lithologies with disseminated sulphide ores (N1-7, N1-8 and N1-9) have less radiogenic ÉHf values than those in barren lithologies. The Hf-isotope data for zircons from ore-bearing rocks thus suggest that the Noril'sk magmas represent mixing between a juvenile source equivalent to the Depleted Mantle and a\n\nDetrital Zircon U-Pb and Hf-isotope Constrains on Basement Ages, Granitic Magmatism, and Sediment Provenance in the Malay Peninsula\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSevastjanova, Inga; Clements, Benjamin; Hall, Robert; Belousova, Elena; Pearson, Norman; Griffin, William\n\n2010-05-01\n\nThe Malay Peninsula forms the western part of central Sundaland in SE Asia. Sundaland comprises Indochina, the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the shallow shelf between these landmasses. It is a composite region of continental crustal fragments that are separated by sutures that represent remnant ocean basins and volcanic arcs. The Malay Peninsula includes two of these fragments - East Malaya and Sibumasu - separated by the Bentong-Raub Suture Zone. The latter is a Palaeo-Tethyan ocean remnant. Granitoids of the Malay Peninsula are the major sources of detrital zircon in Sundaland. East Malaya is intruded by Permian-Triassic Eastern Province granitoids interpreted as products of Palaeozoic subduction of oceanic crust beneath the East Malaya Volcanic Arc. Sibumasu is intruded by Triassic Main Range Province granitoids interpreted as syn- to post-collisional magmatism following suturing to East Malaya. Locally, there are minor Late Cretaceous plutons. Basements of Sibumasu and East Malaya are not exposed and their ages are poorly constrained. The exact timing of the collision between these fragments is also contentious. In order to resolve these uncertainties, 752 U-Pb analyses from 9 samples were carried out on detrital zircons from modern rivers draining the Malay Peninsula and, of these, 243 grains from 6 samples were selected for Hf-isotope analyses. U-Pb zircon ages show that small numbers of Neoarchean-Proterozoic grains are consistently present in all samples, but do not form prominent populations. Permian-Triassic populations are dominant. Only one sample contains a small Jurassic population probably sourced from the area of Thailand and most likely recycled from fluvial-alluvial Mesozoic 'red-beds'. Late Cretaceous populations are locally abundant. Hf-isotope crustal model ages suggest that basement beneath the Malay Peninsula is heterogeneous. Some basement may be Neoarchean but there is no evidence for basement older than 2.8 Ga beneath\n\nPermian-Carboniferous arc magmatism in southern Mexico: U-Pb dating, trace element and Hf isotopic evidence on zircons of earliest subduction beneath the western margin of Gondwana\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOrtega-ObregÃ³n, C.; Solari, L.; GÃ³mez-Tuena, A.; ElÃ­as-Herrera, M.; Ortega-GutiÃ©rrez, F.; MacÃ­as-Romo, C.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nUndeformed felsic to mafic igneous rocks, dated by U-Pb zircon geochronology between 311 and 255 Ma, intrude different units of the Oaxacan and AcatlÃ¡n metamorphic complexes in southwestern Mexico. Rare earth element concentrations on zircons from most of these magmatic rocks have a typical igneous character, with fractionated heavy rare earths and negative Eu anomalies. Only inherited Precambrian zircons are depleted in heavy rare earth elements, which suggest contemporaneous crystallization in equilibrium with metamorphic garnet during granulite facies metamorphism. Hf isotopic signatures are, however, different among these magmatic units. For example, zircons from two of these magmatic units (Cuanana pluton and Honduras batholith) have positive ÉHf values (+3.8-+8.5) and depleted mantle model ages (using a mean crustal value of 176Lu/177Hf = 0.015) ( T DMC) ranging between 756 and 1,057 Ma, whereas zircons from the rest of the magmatic units (Etla granite, Zaniza batholith, Carbonera stock and Sosola rhyolite) have negative ÉHf values (-1 to -14) and model ages between 1,330 and 2,160 Ma. This suggests either recycling of different crustal sources or, more likely, different extents of crustal contamination of arc-related mafic magmas in which the Oaxacan Complex acted as the main contaminant. These plutons thus represent the magmatic expression of the initial stages of eastward subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the western margin of Gondwana, and confirm the existence of a Late Carboniferous-Permian magmatic arc that extended from southern North America to Central America.\n\nTectonic Evolution of the Izmir Ankara Suture Zone in Northwest Turkey Using Zircon U-Pb Geochronology and Zircon Lu-Hf Isotopic Tracers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCampbell, C.; Taylor, M.

C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nDetrital zircons from a Cretaceous forearc basin and Tertiary foreland basin located along the Sakarya Zone of the Western Pontides were analyzed to better understand the closure history of the Tethyan oceans. The Variscan Orogeny is characterized by abundant 350-300 Ma U-Pb ages and vertical ÉHf arrays, consistent with a mature magmatic arc that emplaced plutons through a southward growing accretionary margin. An ÉHf pull-up is observed from 300-250 Ma interpreted as rifting of the Intra-Pontide Ocean. The Cimmerian Orogeny is characterized by a 250-230 Ma ÉHf pull-down, followed by a 230-200 Ma magmatic gap consistent with underthrusting of the Karakaya Complex. From 200-120 Ma another magmatic lull is observed. The Alpine Orogeny is characterized by an ÉHf pull-down from 120-85 Ma within Cretaceous forearc sediments and a 100 Ma deviant ÉHf vertical array within Tertiary foreland basin sediments. Minor zircon U-Pb age peaks and contrasting inter-basinal ÉHf evolution are interpreted to represent onset of Andean-style subduction along the southern margin of the Sakarya Zone at 120 Ma followed by crustal thickening until 85 Ma. The deviant 100 Ma ÉHf vertical array within foreland basin detritus is interpreted as initiation of intra-oceanic subduction within the Izmir-Ankara Ocean. An 85-75 Ma ÉHf pull-up from forearc basin sediments is interpreted as slab roll-back along the southern margin of the Sakarya Zone, responsible for final rifting of the Western Black Sea. At 80 Ma, a vertical ÉHf array from Tertiary foreland basin deposits is interpreted to represent synchronous melting of the Tavsanli Zone and intra-oceanic slab break-off. A single 66 Myr pre-collisional grain defines a sharp ÉHf pull-down immediately prior to total arc shut-off, interpreted to represent incipient collision between the Sakarya and Tavsanli zones. A 52 Ma syn-collisional tuff yields minimally intermediate ÉHf values followed by a slight 48 Ma ÉHf pull-down, interpreted as a\n\nEvidence of early Archean crust in northwest Gondwana, from U-Pb and Hf isotope analysis of detrital zircon, in Ediacaran surpacrustal rocks of northern Spain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNaidoo, Thanusha; Zimmermann, Udo; Vervoort, Jeff; Tait, Jenny\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe Mora Formation (Narcea Group) is one of the oldest Precambrian supracrustal successions in northern Spain. Here, we use U-Pb and in situ Hf isotope analysis on detrital zircon to determine its age and provenance. The youngest U-Pb dates constrain the maximum depositional age of the Mora Formation at 565 Â± 11 Ma. Results indicate: (1) a dominant Ediacaran zircon population (33%; 565-633 Ma, Cadomian) within a spectrum of Neoproterozoic ages (40%; 636-996 Ma); and (2) smaller Mesoproterozoic (5%; 1004-1240 Ma), Palaeoproterozoic (11%; 1890-2476 Ma) and Archean (11%; 2519-3550 Ma) populations. Results here do not point to one specific cratonic source area; instead, detritus may have been derived from the West African craton and Amazonia, or even the concealed Iberian basement. The lack of 1.3-1.8 Ga grains suggests exclusion of the Sahara Craton as a major source, but this is not certain. This mixed composition favours a complex source history with reworking of detritus across terrane/craton boundaries. Hafnium isotope compositions indicate a range of crustal and juvenile sources, with initial ÉHf values between -15.8 and 11.1, and Hf model ages from 0.8 to 3.7 Ga. For Neoproterozoic zircons (80%), juvenile components (ÉHf(i) +10) may be related to Rodinia fragmentation and the onset of an active margin setting leading to the Cadomian orogeny. Palaeoproterozoic to Paleoarchean grains (20%) all have negative ÉHf values and Meso- to Eoarchean Hf model ages. This indicates an early (Archean) sialic crustal component for northwestern Gondwana.\n\nHAFNIAN ZIRCONS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nvon Knorring, O.; Hornung, G.\n\n1961-06-17\n\nTwo hafnia zircons were examined in detail, one from Mtoko in Southern Rhodesia, containing 21% HfO/sub 2/, and the other from Karibib in South-West Africa, with 31% HfO/sub 2/. In both cases the zircons are associated with the later tantalum-rich phase of mineralization. The Mtoko zircon forms small, mauve- colored, independent crystals in the albitic zone of the pegmatite. The zircon from Karibib occurs in larger reddish-brown masses, partly intergrown with minute manganotantalite crystals and set in a matrix of lithium-bearing mica, albite, quartz and kaolinized feldspar.

I.; Hawkesworth, C. J.; Hergt, J. M.; Woodhead, J.\n\n2004-05-01\n\nIsotope studies have proved of enormous benefit in fingerprinting the source rocks of silicic magmas and tracing open system petrogenetic processes, such as crustal assimilation or magma mixing. Quantification of these processes, especially the role of mantle-derived magmas, is essential to formulating realistic models for the thermal regime and compositional evolution of the continental crust. However, this remains problematic, since whole-rock isotopic data registers the final state of the magmatic system but gives no information on the pathways by which this state was attained. For example, the eNd - initial 87Sr/86Sr isotopic array defined by the classic I- and S-type granites of the Lachlan Fold Belt has been variously interpreted to reflect (1) mixing between two end-member magmas, one depleted mantle-like, the other evolved and continental crust-like, (2) mixing between a juvenile magma and a magma sourced from mafic lower crust, accompanied by sediment assimilation, (3) derivation of the granites from mixed source rocks and (4) derivation from a sequence of protoliths of various ages and sedimentary maturity. The implications of these possibilities for crustal architecture, and whether granitic magmatism was associated with the recycling or growth of new continental crust are drastically different. One way to now resolve such ambiguities is by unravelling the isotopic information encoded in the fine-scale growth zoning of minerals such as zircon, which potentially tracks the processes operative during crystallisation. To this end we report the first laser-ablation ICP-MS study into the Hf isotope stratigraphy of zircons hosted by LFB I-type granites and their mafic enclaves. This is integrated with a prior U-Pb isotope study and trace element concentrations measured on the same zircons. Two suites were investigated, the Cobargo and Why Worry Suites of the Bega Batholith. Although the bulk rock isotopic variation within these suites is restricted, this study\n\nA hidden Late Cretaceous arc and subsequent magmatic events in the Caucasus-Iran-Anatolia (CIA) orogenic belt: Detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic constraints\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTien, C. Y.; Lin, Y. C.; Chu, M. F.; Chung, S. L.; BiËngÃ¶l, A. F.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Caucasus-Iran-Anatolia (CIA) orogenic belt formed by \"Turkic-type orogeny\" consists mainly of subduction-accretion complexes following the collision between Eurasia and Arabia and the closure of Neotethy. This study reports U-Pb and Hf isotopic data of detrital zircon separates from five Eocene to mid-Miocene sandstone samples from Divrigi and Duranlar in the west to the Mus basin in the east, all locating in the northern part of the Bitlis-Zagros suture zone. The U-Pb age data suggest four main magmatic episodes: (1) 100-70 Ma, (2) 60-40 Ma, (3) 30 Ma, and (4) 15 Ma. The Late Cretaceous zircons recovered mainly from the Mus basin are marked by a significant Hf isotopic variation over time, with ÉHf(T) values dropping from +15 to -10. Zircons from the second and third episodes show spatial variations in isotopic compositions, with positive ÉHf(T) values (+10 to +5) in the Mus basin and heterogeneous ÉHf(T) values (+10 to -10) in the west. The fourth and youngest episode of zircons, mainly from Duranlar area, shows uniform ÉHf(T) values around +5. We attribute the Late Cretaceous episode of zircons to the broadly coeval Elazig arc magmatism that, according to our counterpart study, occurred as a short-lived, intra-oceanic arc system by subduction initiation after the formation of Neotethyan ophiolites in the region. Moreover, we argue that this Late Cretaceous arc system may have existed more widely within the southern branch of Neothethys than that suggested by present-day outcrops. The dramatic change in Hf isotopic composition from 100 to 70 Ma, also observed in the rock record by our counterpart study, may be interpreted as a result of subduction to accretion processes. The remaining three episodes of zircons are related to younger stages of magmatism within or around the suture zone that remains poorly studied. Our results indicate that detrital zircon is a useful tool to uncover \"hidden\" magmatic records in the CIA and other \"Turkic-type\" orogenic\n\nAssessing the isotopic evolution of S-type granites of the Carlos Chagas Batholith, SE Brazil: Clues from U-Pb, Hf isotopes, Ti geothermometry and trace element composition of zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMelo, Marilane G.; Lana, Cristiano; Stevens, Gary; Pedrosa-Soares, AntÃ´nio C.; Gerdes, Axel; Alkmin, Leonardo A.; Nalini, HermÃ­nio A.; Alkmim, Fernando F.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe Carlos Chagas batholith (CCB) is a very large ( 14,000 km2) S-type granitic body formed during the syn-collisional stage of the AraÃ§uaÃ­ orogen (southeastern Brazil). Zircons extracted from the CCB record a wide range of U-Pb ages (from 825 to 490 Ma), indicating a complex history of inheritance, magmatic crystallization and partial melting during the evolution of the orogeny. Magmatic zircons (ca. 578-588 Ma) are marked by similar Hf isotope compositions and REE patterns to those of inherited cores (ca. 825-600 Ma), indicating that these aspects of the chemical signature of the magmatic zircons have likely been inherited from the source. The U-Pb ages and initial 176Hf/177Hf ratios from anatectic and metamorphic zircon domains are consistent with a two-stage metamorphic evolution marked by contrasting mechanisms of zircon growth and recrystallization during the orogeny. Ti-in-zircon thermometry is consistent with the findings of previous metamorphic work and indicates that the two metamorphic events in the batholith reached granulite facies conditions (> 800 Â°C) producing two generations of garnet via fluid-absent partial melting reactions. The oldest metamorphic episode (ca. 570-550 Ma) is recorded by development of thin anatectic overgrowths on older cores and by growth of new anatectic zircon crystals. Both domains have higher initial 176Hf/177Hf values compared to relict cores and display REE patterns typical of zircon that grew contemporaneously with peritectic garnet through biotite-absent fluid partial melting reactions. Hf isotopic and chemical evidences indicate that a second anatectic episode (ca. 535-500 Ma) is only recorded in parts from the CCB. In these rocks, the growth of new anatectic zircon and/or overgrowths is marked by high initial 176Hf/177Hf values and also by formation of second generation of garnet, as indicated by petrographic observations and REE patterns. In addition, some rocks contain zircon crystals formed by solid\n\nTectono-magmatic evolution of the Chihuahua-Sinaloa border region in northern Mexico: Insights from zircon-apatite U-Pb geochronology, zircon Hf isotope composition and geochemistry of granodiorite intrusions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMahar, Munazzam Ali; Goodell, Philip C.; Feinstein, Michael Nicholas\n\n2016-11-01\n\nWe present the whole-rock geochemistry, LA-ICP-MS zircon-apatite U-Pb ages and zircon Hf isotope composition of the granodioritic plutons at the southwestern boundary of Chihuahua with the states of Sinaloa and Sonora. These granodiorites are exposed in the north and south of the Rio El Fuerte in southwest Chihuahua and northern Sinaloa. The magmatism spans over a time period of 37 Ma from 90 to 53 Ma. Zircons are exclusively magmatic with strong oscillatory zoning. No inheritance of any age has been observed. Our new U-Pb dating ( 250 analyses) does not support the involvement of older basement lithologies in the generation of the granitic magmas. The U-Pb apatite ages from granodiorites in southwest Chihuahua vary from 52 to 70 Ma. These apatite ages are 1 to 20 Ma younger than the corresponding zircon U-Pb crystallization ages, suggesting variable cooling rates from very fast to 15 Â°C/Ma ( 800 Â°C to 500 Â°C) and shallow to moderate emplacement depths. In contrast, U-Pb apatite ages from the Sinaloa batholith are restricted from 64 to 61 Ma and are indistinguishable from the zircon U-Pb ages range from 67 to 60 Ma within the error, indicating rapid cooling and very shallow emplacement. However, one sample from El Realito showed a larger difference of 20 Ma in zircon-apatite age pair: zircon 80 Â± 0.8 Ma and apatite 60.6 Â± 4 Ma, suggesting a slower cooling rate of 15 Â°C/Ma. The weighted mean initial ÎµHf (t) isotope composition (2Ï) of granodiorites varies from + 1.8 to + 5.2. The radiogenic Hf isotope composition coupled with previous Sr-Nd isotope data demonstrates a significant shift from multiple crustal sources in the Sonoran batholithic belt to the predominant contribution of the mantle-derived magmas in the southwest Chihuahua and northern Sinaloa. Based on U-Pb ages, the absence of inheritance, typical high Th/U ratio and radiogenic Hf isotope composition, we suggest that the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene magmatic rocks in this region are not derived from\n\nZircon U-Pb, O, and Hf isotopic constraints on Mesozoic magmatism in the Cyclades, Aegean Sea, Greece\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFu, Bin; BrÃ¶cker, Michael; Ireland, Trevor; Holden, Peter; Kinsley, Leslie P. J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCompared to the well-documented Cenozoic magmatic and metamorphic rocks of the Cyclades, Aegean Sea, Greece, the geodynamic context of older meta-igneous rocks occurring in the marble-schist sequences and mÃ©langes of the Cycladic Blueschist Unit is as yet not fully understood. Here, we report O-Hf isotopic compositions of zircons ranging in age from ca. 320 Ma to ca. 80 Ma from metamorphic rocks exposed on the islands of Andros, Ios, Sifnos, and Syros with special emphasis on Triassic source rocks. Ion microprobe (SHRIMP II) single spot oxygen isotope analysis of pre-Cretaceous zircons from various felsic gneisses and meta-gabbros representing both the marble-schist sequences and the mÃ©langes of the study area yielded a large range in Î´18O values, varying from 2.7 â° to 10.1 â° VSMOW, with one outlier at -0.4 %. Initial ÉHf values (-12.5 to +15.7) suggest diverse sources for melts formed between Late Carboniferous to Late Cretaceous time that record derivation from mantle and reworked older continental crust. In particular, variable Î´18O and ÉHf( t) values for Triassic igneous zircons suggest that magmatism of this age is more likely rift- than subduction-related. The significant crustal component in 160 Ma meta-gabbros from Andros implies that some Jurassic gabbroic rocks of the Hellenides are not part of SSZ-type (supra-subduction zone) ophiolites that are common elsewhere along the margin of the Pelagonian zone.\n\nIntegrated in situ U-Pb Age and Hf-O Analyses of Zircon from the Northern Yangtze Block: New Insights into the Neoproterozoic Low-Î´18O Magmas in the South China Block\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Y. N.; Wang, X. C.; Li, Q. L.; Li, X. H.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe oxygen isotopic composition of Neoproterozoic magmas from the northern Yangtze Block holds a key for the origin of large-scale 18O depletion in the HP and UHP metamorphic rocks in the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt, northern margin of the South China Block. We report here the integrated in situ U-Pb dating and O-Hf isotope analyses of zircon grains from sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the late Neoproterozoic Suixian Group (SG) from the northern Yangtze Block. Detrital zircon grains display age peaks of 0.73-0.74 Ga, 0.79 Ga, and 2.0 Ga. Zircon U-Pb ages together with Hf-O isotopic composition indicate provenance of SG dominantly from proximal Neoproterozoic igneous rock and likely hidden Paleoproterozoic basement along the northern margin of the Yangtze Block. The zircon Î´18O values from SG range from 10.5â° to 1.3â°. Zircon grains with negative Î´18O value, typical result of magma-ice interaction, were not identified in this study. The major phase of low-Î´18O (< 4â°) magmas initiated at ca. 780 Ma, long before the first glaciation event (< 715 Ma) in the South China Block. Thus caution should be taken when using low-Î´18O zircon grains to infer cold climate. Low-Î´18O zircon grains have large ranges of ÉHf(t) values, varying from -15.5 to 10.7, concentrating on negative ÉHf(t). This strongly argues against the possibility that the low-Î´18O magma was produced by partial melting of high-temperature hydrothermally altered oceanic crust because this model predicted MORB-like Hf isotopes for the resultant low-Î´18O magmas. This study emphasizes that high-T water-rock interaction and continental rifting tectonic setting are essential to generate abundant low-Î´18O magmas. The important application of our study is to confirm that most of negative-Î´18O zircons identified in HP and UHP metamorphic rocks may not have been inherited from their Neoproterozoic protoliths.\n\nA non-zircon Hf isotope record in Archean black shales from the Pilbara craton confirms changing crustal dynamics ca. 3 Ga ago.\n\nPubMed\n\nNebel-Jacobsen, Yona; Nebel, Oliver; Wille, Martin; Cawood, Peter A\n\n2018-01-17\n\nPlate tectonics and associated subduction are unique to the Earth. Studies of Archean rocks show significant changes in composition and structural style around 3.0 to 2.5 Ga that are related to changing tectonic regime, possibly associated with the onset of subduction. Whole rock Hf isotope systematics of black shales from the Australian Pilbara craton, selected to exclude detrital zircon components, are employed to evaluate the evolution of the Archean crust. This approach avoids limitations of Hf-in-zircon analyses, which only provide input from rocks of sufficient Zr-concentration, and therefore usually represent domains that already underwent a degree of differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of this method through analysis of shales that range in age from 3.5 to 2.8 Ga, and serve as representatives of their crustal sources through time. Their Hf isotopic compositions show a trend from strongly positive ÎµHf initial values for the oldest samples, to strongly negative values for the younger samples, indicating a shift from juvenile to differentiated material. These results confirm a significant change in the character of the source region of the black shales by 3 Ga, consistent with models invoking a change in global dynamics from crustal growth towards crustal reworking around this time.\n\nZircon trace element and isotopic (Sr, Nd, Hf, Pb) effects of assimilation-fractional crystallization of pegmatite magma: A case study of the Guangshigou biotite pegmatites from the North Qinling Orogen, central China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYuan, Feng; Liu, Jia-Jun; Carranza, Emmanuel John M.; Zhang, Shuai; Zhai, De-Gao; Liu, Gang; Wang, Gong-Wen; Zhang, Hong-Yuan; Sha, Ya-Zhou; Yang, Shang-Song\n\n2018-03-01\n\nEvidence for open-system magmatic processes related to wallrock assimilation accompanied by fractional crystallization (AFC) is present in the Guangshigou biotite pegmatites, North Qinling Orogen. The biotite pegmatite-gneiss contacts generally coincide with the greatest enrichment of U and Th. Zircon Usbnd Pb dating constrains the crystallization ages of the biotite pegmatite (rim zone-415 Â± 2.6 Ma; internal zone-413.5 Â± 2.5 Ma), in line with a pyrite Pbsbnd Pb isochron age (413 Â± 22 Ma). Metamict areas in zircon show generally elevated concentrations of trace elements and expulsion of radioactive Pb. Internal zone samples, representing uncontaminated magma, have negative to positive zircon ( 413 Ma) ÎµHf(t) (- 1.53 - + 3.24), low ÎµNd(t) values (- 2.4), and old Hf and Nd model ages (tDM2 = 1.5-1.19 Ga, T2DM = 1.35 Ga, respectively), indicating a dominantly recycled Mesoproterozoic lower crustal material with involvement of some juvenile materials in the source region. The magmatic oxygen fugacity (fO2) and crystallization temperatures ranges from - 24.81 to - 13.34 of log fO2 and 570 Â°C to 793 Â°C, respectively. Compared to the internal zone, pegmatite rim samples display a variable and lower ÎµNd(t) values (- 3.9 to - 2.8) and T2DM (1.47-1.37 Ga), but similar Hf isotopic compositions, favouring a three-component isotopic mixing model (recycled Mesoproterozoic lower crust materials, juvenile materials, and host gneiss). Pronounced variations of Ti, Y, U, Th, Hf, and REE concentrations in zircon from grain to grain in individual samples and from area to area within individual grains suggest a fluctuating crystallization environment in hybridized magma from which the rim-hosted zircons crystallized. Variable and high radiogenic Pb ratios of pyrites forming in the hybridized magma were inherited from the matrix. Zircons from both zones exhibit similar Hf isotope patterns, indicating the rim-hosted zircons crystallized during the early stage of hybridization of\n\nU Pb and Lu Hf isotope record of detrital zircon grains from the Limpopo Belt Evidence for crustal recycling at the Hadean to early-Archean transition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZeh, Armin; Gerdes, Axel; Klemd, Reiner; Barton, J. M., Jr.\n\n2008-11-01\n\nDetrital zircon grains from Beit Bridge Group quartzite from the Central Zone of the Limpopo Belt near Musina yield mostly ages of 3.35-3.15 Ga, minor 3.15-2.51 Ga components, and numerous older grains grouped at approximately 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 Ga. Two grains yielded concordant Late Hadean U-Pb ages of 3881 Â± 11 Ma and 3909 Â± 26 Ma, which are the oldest zircon grains so far found in Africa. The combined U-Pb and Lu-Hf datasets and field relationships provide evidence that the sedimentary protolith of the Beit Bridge Group quartzite was deposited after the emplacement of the Sand River Gneisses (3.35-3.15 Ga), but prior to the Neoarchean magmatic-metamorphic events at 2.65-2.60 Ga. The finding of abundant magmatic zircon detritus with concordant U-Pb ages of 3.35-3.15 Ga, and 176Hf/ 177Hf of 0.28066 Â± 0.00004 indicate that the Sand River Gneiss-type rocks were a predominant source. In contrast, detrital zircon grains older than approximately 3.35 Ga were derived from the hinterland of the Limpopo Belt; either from a so far unknown crustal source in southern Africa, possibly from the Zimbabwe Craton and/or a source, which was similar but not necessarily identical to the one that supplied the Hadean zircons to Jack Hills, Western Australia. The Beit Bridge Group zircon population at >3.35 Ga shows a general ÉHf t increase with decreasing age from ÉHf 3.9Ga = -6.3 to ÉHf 3.3-3.1Ga = -0.2, indicating that Hadean crust older than 4.0 Ga ( TDM = 4.45-4.36 Ga) was rejuvenated during magmatic events between >3.9 and 3.1 Ga, due to a successive mixing of crustal rocks with mantle derived magmas. The existence of a depleted mantle reservoir in the Limpopo's hinterland is reflected by the Ë3.6 Ga zircon population, which shows ÉHf 3.6Ga between -4.6 and +3.2. In a global context, our data suggest that a long-lived, mafic Hadean protocrust with some tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite constituents was destroyed and partly recycled at the Hadean/Archean transition, perhaps\n\nZircon U-Pb ages, Hf isotope data, and tectonic implications of Early-Middle Triassic granitoids in the Ailaoshan high-grade metamorphic belt of Southeast Tibet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, Wenbin; Liu, Junlai; Chen, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Lisheng\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Ailaoshan tectonic belt, where the effects of the Paleo-Tethyan ocean evolution and Indian-Eurasian plate collision are superimposed, is one of the most significant geological discontinuities in western Yunnan province of southeast Tibet. An Ailaoshan micro-block within the belt is bounded by the Ailaoshan suture zone to the west and the Red River Fault to the east, and consists of low- and high-grade metamorphic belts. Late Permian-Middle Triassic granitoids that are widely distributed to the west of the Ailaoshan suture zone and within the Ailaoshan micro-block may yield significant information on the Tethyan tectonic evolution of the Ailaoshan tectonic belt. This study reports new LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotope data of four granitoids from the Ailaoshan high-grade metamorphic belt. Zircon grains from the Yinjie granitoid do not have inherited cores and yield a weighted mean U-Pb age of 247.1 Â± 2.0 Ma. The zircon É Hf( t) values range from 7.8 to 12.1, and Hf model ages from 775 to 546 Ma, indicating that the granitoid was derived from juvenile crust. The rims of zircons from the Majie and Yuanjiang granitoids yield weighted mean U-Pb ages of 239.5 Â± 1.8 and 237.9 Â± 2.6 Ma, respectively, whereas the cores yield ages of 1608-352 Ma. The É Hf( t) values of zircon rims range from -20.4 to -5.3, yielding Hf model ages from 2557 to 1606 Ma and suggesting that the source magma of the Majie and Yuanjiang granitoids was derived from ancient crust. An additional granitoid located near the Majie Village yields a zircon U-Pb age of 241.2 Â± 1.0 Ma. Based on our geochronological and geochemical data, combined with geological observations, we propose that the Ailaoshan micro-block was derived from the western margin of the Yangtze block, and is comparable to the Zhongzan and Nam Co micro-blocks. The presence of late Permian mafic rocks with rift-related geochemical characteristics within the Ailaoshan micro-block, together with granitoids derived\n\nZircon Hf-O isotopic constraints on the origin of Late Mesozoic felsic volcanic rocks from the Great Xing'an Range, NE China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGong, Mingyue; Tian, Wei; Fu, Bin; Wang, Shuangyue; Dong, Jinlong\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe voluminous Late Mesozoic magmatism was related to extensive re-melting of juvenile materials that were added to the Central East Asia continent in Phanerozoic time. The most favoured magma generation mechanism of Late Mesozoic magmas is partial melting of underplated lower crust that had radiogenic Hf-Nd isotopic characteristics, but this mechanism faces difficulties when interpreting other isotopic data. The tectonic environment controlling the generation of the Late Mesozoic felsic magmas is also in dispute. In this study, we obtained new U-Pb ages, and geochemical and isotopic data of representative Jurassic (154.4 Â± 1.5 Ma) and Cretaceous (140.2 Â± 1.5 Ma) felsic volcanic samples. The Jurassic sample has inherited zircon cores of Permian age, with depleted mantle-like ÎµHf(t) of +7.4 - +8.5, which is in contrast with those of the magmatic zircons (ÎµHf(t) = +2.4 Â± 0.7). Whereas the inherited cores and the magmatic zircons have identical mantle-like Î´18O composition ranges (4.25-5.29â° and 4.69-5.54â°, respectively). These Hf-O isotopic characteristics suggest a mixed source of enriched mantle materials rather than ancient crustal components and a depleted mantle source represented by the inherited Permian zircon core. This mechanism is manifested by the eruption of Jurassic alkaline basalts originated from an enriched mantle source. The Cretaceous sample has high ÎµHf(t) of +7.0 - +10.5, suggesting re-melting of a mafic magma derived from a depleted mantle-source. However, the sub-mantle zircon Î´18O values (3.70-4.58â°) suggest the depleted mantle-derived mafic source rocks had experienced high temperature hydrothermal alteration at upper crustal level. Therefore, the Cretaceous felsic magma, if not all, could be generated by re-melting of down-dropped supracrustal volcanic rocks that experienced high temperature oxygen isotope alteration. The two processes, enriched mantle-contribution and supracrustal juvenile material re-melting, are new\n\nZircon U-Pb age, Hf isotope and geochemistry of Carboniferous intrusions from the Langshan area, Inner Mongolia: Petrogenesis and tectonic implications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Min; Zhang, Da; Xiong, Guangqiang; Zhao, Hongtao; Di, Yongjun; Wang, Zhong; Zhou, Zhiguang\n\n2016-04-01\n\nLate Paleozoic was a critical period for the tectonic evolution of the northern margin of the Alxa-North China craton, but the evolutionary history is not well constrained. The Carboniferous intrusions in the Langshan area in the western part of the northern margin of the Alxa-North China craton are mainly composed of tonalite, quartz diorite, olivine gabbro and pyroxene peridotite. Zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating indicates that the Langshan Carboniferous intrusions were emplaced at ca. 338-324 Ma. The quartz diorites are characterized by high amounts of compatible trace elements (Cr, Ni and V) and high Mg# values, which may suggest a significant mantle source. The positive Pb and negative Nb-Ta-Ti anomalies, the variable ÎµHf(t) (-6.9 to 2.0) values and the old Hf model ages (1218-1783 Ma) imply some involvement of ancient continental materials in its petrogenesis. The tonalite has relatively high Sr/Y ratios, low Mg#, Yb and Y contents, features of adakite-like rocks, negative ÎµHf(t) values (-9.8 to -0.1) and older Hf model ages (1344-1953 Ma), which suggest significant involvement of ancient crust materials and mantle-derived basaltic component in its petrogenesis. The high Mg# values, high Cr and Ni contents, and low Zr and Hf contents of the mafic-ultramafic rocks show evidence of a mantle source, and the relatively low zircon ÎµHf(t) values (-5.9 to 3.2) might point to an enriched mantle. The trace element characteristics indicate the influence of subducted sediments and slab-derived fluids. In the tectonic discrimination diagrams, all the rocks plot in subduction-related environment, such as volcanic arc and continental arc. Considering the regional geology, we suggest that the Carboniferous intrusions in the Langshan area were likely emplaced during the late stage of the southward subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean plate, which formed a continental arc along the northern margin of the Alxa-North China craton.\n\nEvolution of the depleted mantle and growth of the continental crust: improving on the imperfect detrital zircon record\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVervoort, J. D.; Kemp, A. I. S.; Patchett, P. J.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nOne of the basic tenets of terrestrial geochemistry is that the continental crust has been extracted from the mantle leaving the latter depleted in incompatible elements. Nd and Hf isotopes have long shown that this process has been an essential feature of the Earth throughout its history. There is wide agreement on the general nature of this process, but the details of the isotopic recordâand their implications for the depletion of the mantle and the extraction of continental crustâremain debated. Recently, much attention has been given to detrital zircons in both modern and ancient sediments. An advantage of this approach is the integration of the crystallization history of the zircon from the U-Pb chronometer with its Hf isotopic composition, which can provide important information on whether the zircons have been derived from juvenile or reworked crust. One essential requirement in this approach, however, is to unambiguously determine the crystallization ages of the zircons. We suggest that this represents an importantâbut generally ignoredâsource of uncertainty in the Hf isotopic record from detrital zircons. The quality filter most often used to assess the integrity of zircon U-Pb systematics is concordance; if a zircon is concordant, it is assumed that the U-Pb age is accurate. A concordance filter is less effective in old zircons, however, because ancient Pb loss, viewed today, parallels concordia. Without the benefit from the geological context of the host rock to the zircons, it is impossible to unambiguously determine it true crystallization age. Ancient Pb loss in zircons produces an apparent age less than the true magmatic age. The initial Hf isotopic composition of these zircons, as a result, will be calculated at the wrong age and will be anomalously low (by ~2.2 epsilon Hf units per 0.1 Ga). Hf model ages, calculated from these parameters, will be artificially old and spurious. The combination of unradiogenic Hf and Hf model ages > U-Pb ages\n\nAn Integrated Analytical Approach to Obtaining Reliable U-Pb and Hf Isotopic Data from Complex (>3.9 to 3.3 Ga) Zircon from the Acasta Gneiss Complex\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBauer, A.; Bowring, S. A.; Vervoort, J. D.; Fisher, C. M.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe Acasta Gneiss Complex (AGC) of northwestern Canada preserves some of Earth's oldest granitic crust (>4.03 Ga) and thereby contains important insight into crust forming processes on the early Earth. In general, rocks of the AGC have undergone a complex history of metamorphism and deformation (Archean and Paleoproterozoic)1,2, and, as a consequence, the zircons retain a complex history including inheritance, magmatic and metamorphic overgrowths, recrystallization, and multi-stage Pb loss. Previously published Hf isotopic data on zircons show within sample variability in excess of analytical uncertainty2,3,4. In order to assess the meaning and significance of this apparent isotopic variability, we are using two different methods to obtain coupled U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data in zircon from a suite of rocks ranging in age from ca. > 3.9 Ga to 3.3 Ga. To obtain these data from the same volume of zircon, our approach involves: 1) split stream LA-ICPMS for U-Pb and Lu-Hf; 2) mechanical isolation of zircon domains for chemical abrasion and ID-TIMS U-Pb analyses and solution ICPMS for Lu-Hf recovered from U-Pb ion exchange chromatography. The deconvolution of complex histories requires this integrated approach and permits us to take advantage of both high spatial resolution and highest precision measurements to ultimately decipher the age and isotopic composition of discrete domains of multi-phase zircon. We demonstrate our approach with both relatively simple and complex grain populations in an attempt to understand within and between grain heterogeneity. The samples with the simplest zircon systematics have increasingly negative ÉHf from oldest to youngest, consistent with involvement of 4.0 Ga or older crust in later generations; also, none of our samples have been derived solely from strongly depleted sources. The presence of intra-zircon variability within samples from the AGC reflects a complex history of magmatic additions requiring melting/assimilation of older\n\nCadomian basement and Paleozoic to Triassic siliciclastics of the Taurides (Karacahisar dome, south-central Turkey): Paleogeographic constraints from U-Pb-Hf in zircons\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbbo, Avishai; Avigad, Dov; Gerdes, Axel; GÃ¼ngÃ¶r, Talip\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe Tauride block in Turkey is a peri-Gondwana, Cadomian-type terrane that rifted from the Afro-Arabian margin of Gondwana in the Permo-Triassic and re-accreted to Arabia in the Neogene. In the Karacahisar dome in the southern-central Taurides, Neoproterozoic basement metasediments and intrusive rocks are overlain by Cambro-Ordovician, Carboniferous and Triassic sediments. We studied U-Pb-Hf in zircons from major rock units exposed in Karacahisar in order to constrain the Cadomian crustal evolution of the Taurides, to evaluate the provenance of the Neoproterozoic and overlying sediments, to constrain the paleogeography of the Taurides, and to assess their linkage to Gondwana. The Neoproterozoic metasediments are low-grade metamorphic wacke-type turbidites that evolved in a broad back-arc basin peripheral to Afro-Arabia. Their detrital zircon U-Pb signal comprises a preponderance (40-68%) of Neoproterozoic-aged zircons (peak ages defined at 635 and 830 Ma), indicating that the sedimentary pile was built mainly from the erosion of Pan-African terranes from Afro-Arabia. The ÎµHf values of the younger population (635 Ma) are mostly positive, indicating derivation from a juvenile arc, whereas Cryogenian-Tonian detrital zircons spread vertically (- 25 < ÎµHf < 15), indicating a different provenance where mixing of juvenile magmas with Paleoproterozoic to Neoarchean crust was widespread. An unusually high proportion of pre-Neoproterozoic zircons is found in all Cadomian metasediments, including up to 31% Grenvillian-aged (ca. 1.0 Ga) and up to 35% of ca. 2.5 Ga zircons; about a third of the latter possess positive ÎµHf values. Because only minor exposures of 1.0 and 2.5 Ga crustal vestiges are currently known in North Africa and Arabia, we infer that pre-Neoproterozoic terranes were dispersed within the Cadomian realm itself. The youngest detrital zircons in all Cadomian metasediments concentrate at 0.58 Ga, indicating that the proto-Cadomian back-arc basin was formed\n\nPrecambrian-Cambrian provenance of Matinde Formation, Karoo Supergroup, northwestern Mozambique, constrained from detrital zircon U-Pb age and Lu-Hf isotope data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBicca, Marcos MÃ¼ller; Jelinek, Andrea Ritter; Philipp, Ruy Paulo; de Carvalho Lana, Cristiano; Alkmim, Ana Ramalho\n\n2018-02-01\n\n-Minjova rift basin together with the Mungari Nappe and Chacocoma Granite, also probable sources. The ÎµHf-isotopic signature (ca. -23 to 0) with Meso- and Paleoproterozoic Hf model ages of these zircons suggest assimilation of older crust by the Guro Suite continental arc. The Late Neoproterozoic - Cambrian U-Pb ages (ca. 700-490 Ma) comprise the wide interval of high-grade metamorphism, klippen and plutonism related to the Pan-African Orogeny. Hf-isotope pattern indicate high remelting of the older Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic crust. These ages correspond to magmatic and granulite metamorphic ages of the Monapo and Mugeba klippen, Nampula Complex and Guro Suite/Mungari Nappe/Chacocoma Granite rocks. The data suggests that these units were main source areas for the sediments of the Matinde Formation. The main Cambrian ages are related to the late stages of Pan-African Orogeny, marked by crustal delamination in NE Mozambique that was responsible for an extensive crustal partial melting associated to high-grade granulitic metamorphism and generation of large granitic plutons. The Nampula Complex was probably a large geotectonic entity in the Late Mesoproterozoic and reworked during the Pan-African Orogeny. This evidence, added to the N-NW paleoflow of the Proto-Zambezi river and provenance data, suggests that the Nampula Complex, Guro Suite and its juxtaposed nappes formed a high ground source area for fluvial sediments that fills the Moatize-Minjova Basin. Permian-Triassic rifting in northern Mozambique was induced by far-field stresses transferred from Gondwana margins. This stress disrupted the Nampula Complex reactivating Precambrian structures and fabrics, while the Jurassic-Cretaceous breakup of Gondwana and latter landscape evolution led to its actual morphology and configuration.\n\nContrasting sources of Late Paleozoic rhyolite magma in the Polish Lowlands: evidence from U-Pb ages and Hf and O isotope composition in zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSÅodczyk, ElÅ¼bieta; Pietranik, Anna; Glynn, Sarah; Wiedenbeck, Michael; Breitkreuz, Christoph; Dhuime, Bruno\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe Polish Lowlands, located southwest of the Teisseyre-Tornquist Zone, within Trans-European Suture Zone, were affected by bimodal, but dominantly rhyolitic, magmatism during the Late Paleozoic. Thanks to the inherited zircon they contain, these rhyolitic rocks provide a direct source of information about the pre-Permian rocks underlying the Polish Lowland. This paper presents zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf and O isotopic results from five drill core samples representing four rhyolites and one granite. Based on the ratio of inherited vs. autocrystic zircon, the rhyolites can be divided into two groups: northern rhyolites, where autocrystic zircon is more abundant and southern rhyolites, where inherited zircon dominates. We suggest that the magma sources and the processes responsible for generating high silica magmas differ between the northern and southern rhyolites. Isotopically distinct sources were available during formation of northern rhyolites, as the Hf and O isotopes in magmatic zircon differ between the two analysed localities of northern rhyolites. A mixing between magmas formed from Baltica-derived mudstone-siltstone sediments and Avalonian basement or mantle can explain the diversity between the zircon compositions from the northern localities Daszewo and Wysoka KamieÅska. Conversely, the southern rhyolites from our two localities contain zircon with similar compositions, and these units can be further correlated with results from the North East German Basin, suggesting uniform source rocks over this larger region. Based on the ages of inherited zircon and the isotopic composition of magmatic ones, we suggest that the dominant source of the southern rhyolites is Variscan foreland sediments mixed with Baltica/Avalonia-derived sediments.\n\nSHRIMP U-Pb dating, trace elements and the Lu-Hf isotope system of coesite-bearing zircon from amphibolite in the SW Sulu UHP terrane, eastern China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Fulai; Gerdes, Axel; Zeng, Lingsen; Xue, Huaimin\n\n2008-06-01\n\nIn this study, we link mineral inclusion data, trace element analyses, U-Pb age and Hf isotope composition obtained from distinct zircon domains of complex zircon to unravel the origin and multi-stage metamorphic evolution of amphibolites from the Sulu ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) terrane, eastern China. Zircon grains separated from amphibolites from the CCSD-MH drill hole (G12) and Niushan outcrop (G13) were subdivided into two main types based on cathodoluminescence (CL) and Laser Raman spectroscopy: big dusty zircons with inherited cores and UHP metamorphic rims and small clear zircons. Weakly zoned, grey-white luminescent inherited cores preserve mineral inclusions of Cpx + Pl + Ap Â± Qtz indicative of a mafic igneous protolith. Dark grey luminescent overgrowth rims contain the coesite eclogite-facies mineral inclusion assemblage Coe + Grt + Omp + Phe + Ap, and formed at T = 732-839 Â°C and P = 3.0-4.0 GPa. In contrast, white luminescent small clear zircons preserve mineral inclusions formed during retrograde HP quartz eclogite to LP amphibolite-facies metamorphism (T = 612-698 Â°C and P = 0.70-1.05 GPa). Inherited zircons from both samples yield SHRIMP 206Pb/238U ages of 695-520 Ma with an upper intercept age of 800 Â± 31 Ma. The UHP rims yield consistent Triassic ages around 236-225 and 239-225 Ma for G12 and G13 with weighted means of 229 Â± 3 and 231 Â± 3 Ma, respectively. Small clear zircons from both samples give 206Pb/238U ages around 219-210 Ma with a weighted mean of 214 Â± 3 Ma, interpreted as the age of retrograde quartz eclogite-facies metamorphism. Matrix amphibole from both samples indicate Ar-Ar ages of 209 Â± 0.7 and 207 Â± 0.7 Ma, respectively, probably dating late amphibolite-facies retrogression. The data suggest subduction of Neoproterozoic mafic igneous rocks to UHP conditions in Middle Triassic (â¼230 Ma) times and subsequent exhumation to an early HP (â¼214 Ma) and a late LP stage (â¼208 Ma) over a period of â¼16 and 6 Myr, respectively\n\nThe Effect of Element Substitution on Ti-in-Zircon Geothermometry in Volcanic Zircons from Mount Pinatubo, Philippines\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, S. L.; Hattori, K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nDespite the extensive application of the Ti-in-zircon geothermometer, its accuracy in natural systems remains uncertain. In order to investigate the parameters contributing to Ti in zircon, we examined zircons from dacitic eruption products of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, from the Pliocene (>2.5-2.7 Ma), 35000BP and 1991AD. All samples are unaltered and quenched from magmas at 790-825Â°C (Fe-Ti-oxide thermometry). Furthermore, the magma conditions of 1991 samples are well characterized: 780Â°C (cummingtonite rims on hornblende, Fe-Ti-oxide thermometry), 2 kbar pressure, 5.5-6.5 wt.% H2O and fO2 of NNO+1.6. Calculated zircon saturation temperatures are 760, 744 and 738Â°C (oldest to youngest). Zircon Ti concentrations are low (2.0-8.8 ppm), show positive covariation with U (35.6-639 ppm), Th (18.7-696 ppm), âREE (237-1310 ppm) and Y (247-1770 ppm), and negative covariation with Hf (7610-12000 ppm). The Ti-in-zircon geothermometer by Ferry and Watson (2007) yields mean temperatures of 690, 666 and 663Â°C (oldest to youngest), using TiO2 activity=0.6, SiO2 activity=1 and -40Â°C pressure correction. Therefore, temperatures calculated using this method are underestimated by >100Â°C. We suggest that elements in the Zr site impact the substitution of Ti in the Si site of zircon. Ti shows a positive covariation with Zr/Hf (37.0-57.3, r2=0.551). The ionic radius of Hf4+ is smaller than Zr4+, whereas cations like U4+, Th4+, REE3+ and Y3+ are larger. The departure from the ideal crystal configuration is evaluated using the parameter Zr/(Hf-x), whereby x=U4+, Th4+, âREE and Y3+. Ti contents are more strongly correlated with the parameter than Zr/Hf (r2=0.559, 0.565, 0.608, 0.616; respectively). This suggests that large cations replacing Zr strain the lattice, reducing the amount of Ti incorporated into zircon. This further suggests that ZrSiO4 activity is less than 1 in natural rocks, resulting in the systematic underestimation of Ti-in-zircon temperatures.\n\nAccretionary history of the Altai-Mongolian terrane: perspectives from granitic zircon U-Pb and Hf-isotope data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCai, Keda; Sun, Min; Xiao, Wenjiao\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) consists of many tectonic terranes with distinct origin and complicated evolutionary history. Understanding of individual block is crucial to reconstruct the geodynamic history of the gigantic accetionary collage. This study presents zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes for the granitoid rocks in the Russian Altai mountain range (including Gorny Altai, Altai-Mongolian terrane and CTUS suture zone between them), in order to clarify the timing of granitic magmatism, source nature, continental crustal growth and tectonic evolution. Our dating results suggest that granitic magmatism of the Russian Altai mountain range occurred in three major episodes including 445~429 Ma, 410~360 Ma and ~241 Ma. Most of the zircons within the Paleozoic granitoids present comparable positive ÉHf(t) values and Neoproterozoic crustal model ages, which favor the interpretation that the juvenile crustal materials produced in the early stage of CAOB were probably dominant sources for the Paleozoic magmatism in the region. The inference is also supported by widespread occurrence of short-lived juvenile materials including ophiolites, seamount relics and arc assemblages in the north CAOB. Consequently, the Paleozoic massive granitic rocks maybe not represent continental crustal growth at the time when they were emplaced, but rather record reworking of relatively juvenile Proterozoic crustal rocks although mantle-derived mafic magma was possibly involved to sever as heat engine during granitic magma generation. The Early Triassic granitic intrusion may be product in an intra-plate environment, as the case of same type rocks in the adjacent areas. The positive ÉHf(t) values (1.81~7.47) and corresponding Hf model ages (0.80~1.16 Ga) together with evidence of petrology are consistent with the interpretation that the parental magma of the Triassic granitic intrusion was produced from enriched mantle-derived sources under an usually high temperature condition\n\nThe Mesozoic metamorphic-magmatic events in the Medog area, the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis: constraints from zircon U-Pb geochronology, trace elements and Hf isotope compositions in granitoids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDong, Hanwen; Xu, Zhiqin; Li, Yuan; Liu, Zhao; Li, Huaqi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBased on the regional geological mapping, several granitoid intrusions had been discovered in the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis (EHS). In order to constrain their petrogenesis and discuss their relations with the regional tectonics, we carried out U-Pb dating, trace elements and Hf isotope geochemistry studies on zircons separated from the granitoid rocks, in the area of the EHS. In this contribution, the granitoid rocks are mainly composed of diorites (X20-1-6) and granitic gneissic rocks (X2-15-1). The U-Pb zircon dating of diorites yields a crystallization age of 193.8 Â± 2.0 Ma. These zircon have É Hf( t) values ranging from -6.48 to -0"
