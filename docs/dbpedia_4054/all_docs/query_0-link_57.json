        "text": "Combined apatite fission track and U-Pb dating by LA-ICPMS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChew, D. M.; Donelick, R. A.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nApatite is a common accessory mineral in igneous, metamorphic and clastic sedimentary rocks. It is a nearly ubiquitous accessory phase in igneous rocks, is common in metamorphic rocks of pelitic, carbonate, basaltic, and ultramafic composition and is virtually ubiquitous in clastic sedimentary rocks. In contrast to the polycyclic behavior of the stable heavy mineral zircon, apatite is unstable in acidic groundwaters and has limited mechanical stability in sedimentary transport systems. Apatite has many potential applications in provenance studies, particularly as it likely represents first-cycle detritus. Fission track and U-Pb dating are very powerful techniques in apatite provenance studies. They yield complementary information, with the apatite fission-track system yielding low-temperature exhumation ages and the U-Pb system yielding high-temperature cooling ages which constrain the timing of apatite crystallization. This study focuses on integrating apatite fission track and U-Pb dating by the LA-ICPMS method. Our approach is intentionally broad in scope, and is applicable to any quadrupole or rapid-scanning magnetic-sector LA-ICPMS system. Calculating uranium concentrations in fission-track dating by LA-ICPMS increases the speed of analysis and sample throughput compared to the conventional external detector method and avoids the need for neutron irradiation (Hasebe et al., 2004). LA-ICPMS-based uranium measurements in apatite are measured relative to an internal concentration standard (typically 43Ca). Ca in apatite is not always stochiometric as minor cations (Mn2+, Sr2+, Ba2+ and Fe2+) and REE can substitute with Ca2+. These substitutions must be quantified by multi-elemental LA-ICPMS analyses. Such data are also useful for discriminating between different apatite populations in sedimentary or volcaniclastic rocks based on their trace-element chemistry. Low U, Th and radiogenic Pb concentrations, elevated common Pb / radiogenic Pb ratios and U-Pb elemental\n\nU-Pb Dating of Calcite by LA-ICPMS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHacker, B. R.; Kylander-Clark, A. R.; Holder, R. M.; Nuriel, P.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAn emerging frontier area in geochronology is U-Pb dating of carbonate minerals by laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). The spate of papers over the last few years applying LA-ICPMS to carbonate dating stems from the capability of LA-ICPMS to deal with the variable, and often low, U/Pb ratios of carbonate. LA-ICPMS is an excellent tool for efficiently screening out samples with low U/Pb ratios and provides the ability to measure many spots with different U/Pb ratios and obtain dates free of assumptions about the composition of common Pb. Because this technique is in its infancy, important questions remain. What percentage of carbonate samples have high enough U/Pbc ratios that they can be dated? What percentage of samples yield isochronous datasets? What are the limits on precision and accuracy of carbonate U/Pb dates? What is the best analytical method in the absence of isotopically homogeneous reference materials? Through the generosity of our colleagues we have acquired 8 reference materials ranging in age from 3 to 250 Ma. We have analyzed 125 unknowns from a variety of locations using a 193 nm ns laser with an 80-100 Î¼m spot and a Nu Plasma HR-ES. We measure 207Pb/206Pb using NIST 614 glass and then calculate a 206Pb/238U correction factor based on the measured vs. known ages of the reference materials. Sixty of these samples ( 50%) have high enough U/Pb ratios that they can be dated. There is great heterogeneity among the sample suites: some have no datable samples, whereas one suite of 68 samples yielded 53 datable rocks. Of the samples with high U/Pbc ratios, a majority yielded isochronous U-Pb data, indicating that the U-Pb system closed at a given time and was not subsequently disturbed.\n\nMatrix effects for elemental fractionation within ICPMS: applications for U-Th-Pb geochronology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, W.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nRecent development in instruments provides significant technical supports for daily, quick, money saving geochemical analyses. Laser ablation ICPMS stands out due to these reasons, especially for the U-Th-Pb isotopic dating. Matrix-matched external standardization is by far the most common approach used in U-Th-Pb dating via LA-ICPMS. However, matrix-effects between standard and sample for in-situ dating have shown to be both significant and insignificant. It remains mysterious whether a well matrix-matched standard is needed for U-Th-Pb dating by LA-ICPMS. This study provides an experimental framework for the understanding of matrix effects induced elemental fractionation for U-Th-Pb associated with ICPMS. A preliminary study on the influence of varied U, Th and Pb amounts on their fractionations has been carried out. Experimental data show that different U, Th and Pb contents result in varied 238U/206Pb and 232Th/208Pb ratios. The fractionations of U/Pb and Th/Pb increase with the increasing contents (1 ppb to 100 ppb) with a strong positive anomaly at 10 ppb. Matrixes representing minerals frequently used in dating have been investigated for the influences on U/Pb and Th/Pb fractionations, which suggest a complicated effect. Little fractionations observed between mineral pairs (e.g., monazite and apatite; zircon and perovskite; rutile and perovskite; xenotime and baddeleyite), whereas large fractionations identified for other minerals (e.g., zircon and baddeleyite; monazite and sphene; rutile and baddeleyite). Single element matrix (i.e., Si, P, Ca, Zr, Ti) has been studied to identify their effects on the fractionations. U/Pb ratio increases with the increasing Si and P contents, whereas it decreases for Zr, Ca and Ti. Th/Pb ratio increases with increasing Si contents, decreases for P and Zr, and increases first then decreases for Ca and Ti. Above all, different matrix and U, Th and Pb amounts show distinct U/Pb and Th/Pb fractionations within ICPMS. The\n\nAlgorithms and software for U-Pb geochronology by LA-ICPMS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcLean, Noah M.; Bowring, James F.; Gehrels, George\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe past 15 years have produced numerous innovations in geochronology, including experimental methods, instrumentation, and software that are revolutionizing the acquisition and application of geochronological data. For example, exciting advances are being driven by Laser-Ablation ICP Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), which allows for rapid determination of U-Th-Pb ages with 10s of micrometer-scale spatial resolution. This method has become the most commonly applied tool for dating zircons, constraining a host of geological problems. The LA-ICPMS community is now faced with archiving these data with associated analytical results and, more importantly, ensuring that data meet the highest standards for precision and accuracy and that interlaboratory biases are minimized. However, there is little consensus with regard to analytical strategies and data reduction protocols for LA-ICPMS geochronology. The result is systematic interlaboratory bias and both underestimation and overestimation of uncertainties on calculated dates that, in turn, decrease the value of data in repositories such as EarthChem, which archives data and analytical results from participating laboratories. We present free open-source software that implements new algorithms for evaluating and resolving many of these discrepancies. This solution is the result of a collaborative effort to extend the U-Pb_Redux software for the ID-TIMS community to the LA-ICPMS community. Now named ET_Redux, our new software automates the analytical and scientific workflows of data acquisition, statistical filtering, data analysis and interpretation, publication, community-based archiving, and the compilation and comparison of data from different laboratories to support collaborative science.\n\nGeochemistry, thermometry and isotope ratios on the same zircon crystals: the tandem use of quadrupole LA-ICPMS and CA-TIMS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOlin, P. H.; Schmitz, M. D.; Crowley, J. L.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nCurrent trends in igneous petrology include the extraction of diverse geochemical information from smaller sample targets by ever more efficient and cost effective means. Igneous zircons are repositories of several types of petrogenetic information, such as magmatic crystallization ages obtained using U-Pb geochronology, magmatic temperatures using Ti-in-zircon geothermometry, and magmatic differentiation and/or mixing trends using trace element contents. Here we demonstrate a tandem quadrupole LA-ICPMS and CA-TIMS approach on single zircon crystals and within domains in single crystals, which extracts all of these data from a single laser spot analysis and then guides the acquisition of CA-TIMS ages at precisions relevant to magmatic histories. We present data from zircon-bearing intrusive and extrusive rocks spanning the compositional spectrum, and highlight results from silicic volcanic rocks with different affinities. The utility of our approach is illustrated in zircons from the Temora diorite, a commonly used standard material which we analysed using 25-Î¼m ablation spots placed on dozens of grains which had been previously annealed and chemically abraded prior to mounting in epoxy. Our LA-ICPMS results illustrate a 3- to 5-fold variation in trace element concentrations and trace element ratios over >150 degrees of cooling as estimated from Ti-in-zircon thermometry. Some geochemical parameters (e.g., Nb/Ta variations and Eu anomalies) are consistent with crystal fractionation during progressive crystallization, while others are bimodal (e.g., Hf and U contents), suggesting the mixing of crystal/magma batches prior to final solidification. LA-ICPMS U-Pb spot ages reproduce the accepted CA-TIMS age within 2% precision and accuracy, while our CA-TIMS results on the same grains constrain the development of the observed geochemical variability to within 100 ka. Other zircon standard materials to be presented include Plesovich syenite, FC1 gabbro, and R33 diorite\n\nA Modern Analog to the Depositional Age Problem: Zircon and Apatite Fission Track and U-Pb Age Distributions by LA-ICP-MS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDonelick, H. M.; Donelick, M. B.; Donelick, R. A.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nSand from three river systems in North Idaho (Snake River near Lewiston, Clearwater River near Lewiston and the Salmon River near White Bird) and two regional ash fall events (Mt. Mazama and Mt. St. Helens) were collected for zircon U-Pb detrital age analysis. Up to 120 grains of zircon per sample were ablated using a Resonetics M-50 193 nm ArF Excimer laser ablation (LA) system and the Pb, Th, and U isotopic signals were quantified using an Agilent 7700x quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Isotopic signals for major, minor, and trace elements, including all REEs, were also monitored. The youngest zircon U-Pb ages from the river samples were approximately 44 Ma; Cenozoic Idaho Batholith and Precambrian Belt Supergroup ages were well represented. Significant common Pb contamination of the Clearwater River sample (e.g., placer native Cu was observed in the sample) precluded detailed analysis of the zircon U-Pb ages but no interpretable ages <44 Ma were observed. Interestingly, not one of the river samples yielded zircon U-Pb ages near 0 Ma, despite all three catchment areas having received significant ash from Mt. St. Helens in 1980, and Mount Mazama 7,700 years ago, and no doubt other events during the Quaternary. Work currently in progress seeks to address bias against near 0 Ma ages in the catchment areas due to: a) small, local ash fall grain sizes and b) overwhelming number of older grains relative to the ash fall grains. Data from Mt. St. Helens ash from several localities near the mountain (Toutle River and Maple Flats, WA) and several far from the mountain (Spokane, WA; Princeton, ID; Kalispell, MT) and Mt. Mazama ash fall deposits near Lewiston, ID and Spokane, WA will be presented to address these possibilities. Additionally, fission track and U-Pb ages from apatites collected from these river and ash fall samples will also be shown to help constrain the problem.\n\nResolution, the key to unlocking granite petrogenesis using zircon U-Pb - Lu-Hf studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTapster, Simon; Horstwood, Matthew; Roberts, Nick M. W.; Deady, Eimear; Shail, Robin\n\n2017-04-01\n\nCoarse-scale understanding of crustal evolution and source contributions to igneous systems has been drastically enhanced by coupled zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf data sets. These are now common place and potentially offer advantages over whole-rock analyses by resolving heterogeneous source components in the complex crystal cargos of single hand-samples. However, the application of coupled zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf studies to address detailed petrogenetic questions faces a crisis of resolution - On the one hand, micro-beam analytical techniques have high spatial resolution, capable of interrogating crystals with complex growth histories. Yet, the >1-2% temporal resolution of these techniques places a fundamental limitation on their utility for developing petrogenetic models. This limitation in data interpretation arises from timescales of crystal recycling or changes in source evolution that are often shorter than the U-Pb analytical precision. Conversely, high-precision CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb analysis of single whole zircons and solution MC-ICP-MS Lu-Hf isotopes of column washes (Hf masses equating to ca. 10-50 ng) have much greater temporal resolution (<0.1%), yet lack the spatial resolution to deal with complex crystal growth. Analyses homogenize any heterogeneity within the zircon and convolute the petrogenetic model. A balance must be struck between spatial and temporal resolution to address petrogenetic issues. Here, we demonstrate that micro-sampling of complex xenocryst-rich zircon crystals (e.g. <40 Âµm zircon tips) from the granitic post-Variscan Cornubian Batholith (SW England), in tandem with low-common Pb blank CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb chemistry, permits the analysis of zircon volumes that approach those of LA-ICPMS analyses, whilst simultaneously retaining the majority of the temporal resolution associated with the CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb technique. The low volume of zircon within these analyses may only provide <5 ng Hf, and therefore gaining useful precision from Lu-Hf isotopes is\n\nReply to Comment on \"Zircon U-Th-Pb dating using LA-ICP-MS: Simultaneous U-Pb and U-Th dating on the 0.1 Ma Toya Tephra, Japan\"\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIto, Hisatoshi\n\n2015-04-01\n\nGuillong et al. (2015) mentioned that corrections for abundance sensitivity for 232Th and molecular zirconium sesquioxide ions (Zr2O3+) are critical for reliable determination of 230Th abundances in zircon for LA-ICP-MS analyses. There is no denying that more rigorous treatments are necessary to obtain more reliable ages than those in Ito (2014). However, as shown in Fig. 2 in Guillong et al. (2015), the uncorrected (230Th)/(238U) for reference zircons except for Mud Tank are only 5-20% higher than unity. Since U abundance of Toya Tephra zircons that have U-Pb ages < 1 Ma is in-between that of FCT and Plesovice, the overestimation of 230Th by both abundance sensitivity and molecular interferences is expected to be 5-20% for the Toya Tephra. Moreover Ito (2014) obtained U-Th ages of the Toya Tephra by comparison with Fish Canyon Tuff (FCT) data. Because both the FCT and the Toya Tephra have similar trends of overestimation of 230Th, the effect of overestimation of 230Th to cause overestimation of U-Th age should be cancelled out or negligible. Therefore the pivotal conclusion in Ito (2014) that simultaneous U-Pb and U-Th dating using LA-ICP-MS is possible and useful for Quaternary zircons holds true.\n\nGHR1 - A new Eocene natural reference material for U-Pb and Hf isotopic measurements in zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIbanez-Mejia, M.; Eddy, M. P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe present chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionization (CA-ID-TIMS) U-Pb zircon geochronology and solution multicollector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) Hf isotopic data from a proposed natural zircon reference material for use during in situ analyses of U-Pb and Hf isotopic ratios. The sample, GHR1, was collected from the rapakivi intrusive phase of the Eocene Golden Horn batholith in Washington, USA. Zircons separated from this sample range up to 250-300 Î¼m in length and have moderate aspect ratios. A weighted mean of 15 Th-corrected 206Pb/238U zircon dates from GHR1 produced at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is 48.132 Â± 0.023 Ma (2Ï analytical and tracer uncertainties only, MSWD=1.70) confirming that there is little or no inter-crystal age heterogeneity at the scale of a few 10 kyr. Solution MC-ICP-MS measurements of chemically purified aliquots give a 176Hf/177Hf weighted mean of 0.283050 Â± 17 (2Ï, n=10), corresponding to a ÉHf0 of ca. +9.3. The 2Ï variability of these measurements is comparable to our reproducibility of the JMC-475 Hf isotopic standard 0.282160 Â± 14 (n= 13), suggesting that GHR1 zircons are homogenous with respect to 176Hf/177Hf. In situ 206Pb/238U dates from collaborating secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP), and laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) laboratories are in excellent agreement with the CA-ID-TIMS date and illustrate the reproducibility and potential value of this reference zircon. The mean values of 176Hf/177Hf measurements from two LA-ICP-MS laboratories are in agreement with the solution MC-ICP-MS value, but show slightly greater dispersion and higher (Lu+Yb)/Hf values. We attribute this discrepancy to apatite inclusions that are high in REE and may lead to greater isobaric interferences on 176Hf. These inclusions and potential isobaric interferences from REE were removed during the chemical abrasion step prior to bulk\n\nUsing U-Pb Detrital Zircon Geochronology to Study Ice Streams in the Weddell Sea Embayment, Antarctica\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAgrios, L.; Licht, K.; Hemming, S. R.; Williams, T.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nTill from major ice streams of the Weddell Sea Embayment contain detrital zircons with distinct U-Pb age populations that can be used as a provenance tool to better understand ice stream dynamics. The ice streams in this study include the Foundation Ice Stream, and Academy, Slessor, and Recovery glaciers, all of which drain ice from the continent's interior into the Weddell Sea. Characterizing the U-Pb detrital zircon ages in till and rocks will (1) provide the zircon provenance signatures of the material carried by the ice stream - when these signatures are found in LGM and older deposits downstream they can enable interpretation of past ice flow history; and (2) constrain ice-covered upstream bedrock geology that supplies the till carried by ice streams and glaciers. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons were measured in 21 samples of onshore till, erratics, and bedrock of potential source rocks. Grains were analyzed by LA-ICPMS at the University of Arizona (n=300). Relative probability U-Pb age density plots of till in moraines along the Foundation Ice Stream and Academy Glacier show prominent peaks at 500-530 and 615-650 Ma, which overlap with the timing of the Ross and Pan-African orogenies. Zircon ages of 1000-1095 Ma are also present. Local bedrock in the Patuxent Range has the most prominent peak at 510 Ma, suggesting the till is predominantly derived from local Patuxent Formation. However, local bedrock also has fewer grains at 1030 Ma which suggests that this age population is carried in the till as well. Prominent peaks in U-Pb ages from till transported by the Recovery Glacier are 530, 635, 1610 and 1770 Ma. Bedrock of this area contains similar age peaks, with the exception of the 635 Ma peak, suggesting that this ice stream is carrying a signature from an unexposed source of this age completely buried by ice. The Slessor Glacier carries zircons with prominent populations at 1710 and 2260-2420 Ma, which overlap with a high-grade metamorphic event in the\n\nOxygen isotopic composition and U-Pb discordance in zircon\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBooth, A.L.; Kolodny, Y.; Chamberlain, C.P.; McWilliams, M.; Schmitt, A.K.; Wooden, J.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nWe have investigated U-Pb discordance and oxygen isotopic composition of zircon using high-spatial resolution ??18O measurement by ion microprobe. ??18O in both concordant and discordant zircon grains provides an indication of the relationship between fluid interaction and discordance. Our results suggest that three characteristics of zircon are interrelated: (1) U-Pb systematics and concomitant age discordance, (2) ??18O and the water-rock interactions implied therein, and (3) zircon texture, as revealed by cathodoluminescence and BSE imaging. A key observation is that U-Pb-disturbed zircons are often also variably depleted in 18O, but the relationship between discordance and ??18O is not systematic. ??18O values of discordant zircons are generally lighter but irregular in their distribution. Textural differences between zircon grains can be correlated with both U-Pb discordance and ??18O. Discordant grains exhibit either a recrystallized, fractured, or strongly zoned CL texture, and are characteristic of 18O depletion. We interpret this to be a result of metamictization, leading to destruction of the zircon lattice and an increased susceptibility to lead loss. Conversely, grains that are concordant have less-expressed zoning and a smoother CL texture and are enriched in 18O. From this it is apparent that various stages of water-rock interaction, as evidenced by systematic variations in ??18O, leave their imprint on both the texture and U-Pb systematics of zircon.

The analyses were performed on unpolished zircon prism faces (termed rim analyses) and on crystal interiors exposed through mechanical grinding an polishing (interior analyses). 206 Pb/ 238 U ages are corrected for Th-disequilibrium based on published and calculated distribution coefficients for U and Th using average whole-rock and individually analyzed zircon compositions. The data presented in this article were used for the Th-disequilibrium correction of (U-Th)/He zircon geochronology data in the research article entitled \"The onset of the volcanism in the Ciomadul Volcanic Dome Complex (Eastern Carpathians): eruption chronology and magma type variation\" (MolnÃ¡r et al., 2018) [1].\n\nSmall Volume Isotopic Analysis of Zircon Using LA-MC-ICP-MS U-Pb and Lu-Hf and Sub-ng Amounts of Hf in Solution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBauer, A.; Horstwood, M. S.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nCrust-mantle evolution studies are greatly informed by zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic datasets and the ease with which these data can now be acquired has seen their application become commonplace. In order to deconvolute geochemical change and interpret geologic variation in complexly zoned zircons, this information is most ideally obtained on the smallest volume of zircon by successive SIMS U-Pb and LA-MC-ICP-MS Lu-Hf isotopic analyses. However, due to variations in zircon growth zone geometry at depth, the Lu-Hf analysis may not relate to the lower volume U-Pb analysis, potentially causing inaccuracy of the resultant age-corrected Hf isotope signature. Laser ablation split-stream methods are applied to be certain that U-Pb and Lu-Hf data represent the same volume of zircon, however, the sampling volume remains relatively large at 40x30Âµm1. Coupled ID-TIMS U-Pb and solution MC-ICP-MS Lu-Hf work traditionally utilize whole-zircon dissolution ( 10-50ng Hf), which has the potential to homogenize different zones of geologic significance within an analysis. Conversely, modern ID-TIMS U-Pb methods utilize microsampling of zircon grains, often providing < 5ng Hf, thereby challenging conventional Lu-Hf acquisition protocols to achieve the required precision. In order to obtain usable precision on minimal zircon volumes, we developed laser ablation methods using successive 25um spot U-Pb and Lu-Hf ablation pits with a combined depth of 18um, and low-volume solution introduction methods without Hf-REE separation utilizing Hf amounts as low as 0.4ng, while retaining an uncertainty level of ca. 1 ÉHf for both methods. We investigated methods of Yb interference correction and the potential for matrix effects, with a particular focus on the accurate quantification of 176Lu/177Hf. These improvements reduce the minimum amount of material required for U-Pb and Hf isotopic analysis of zircon by about an order of magnitude. 1Ibanez-Mejia et al (2015).

A.; Vervoort, J. D.; Fisher, C. M.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe Acasta Gneiss Complex (AGC) of northwestern Canada preserves some of Earth's oldest granitic crust (>4.03 Ga) and thereby contains important insight into crust forming processes on the early Earth. In general, rocks of the AGC have undergone a complex history of metamorphism and deformation (Archean and Paleoproterozoic)1,2, and, as a consequence, the zircons retain a complex history including inheritance, magmatic and metamorphic overgrowths, recrystallization, and multi-stage Pb loss. Previously published Hf isotopic data on zircons show within sample variability in excess of analytical uncertainty2,3,4. In order to assess the meaning and significance of this apparent isotopic variability, we are using two different methods to obtain coupled U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data in zircon from a suite of rocks ranging in age from ca. > 3.9 Ga to 3.3 Ga. To obtain these data from the same volume of zircon, our approach involves: 1) split stream LA-ICPMS for U-Pb and Lu-Hf; 2) mechanical isolation of zircon domains for chemical abrasion and ID-TIMS U-Pb analyses and solution ICPMS for Lu-Hf recovered from U-Pb ion exchange chromatography. The deconvolution of complex histories requires this integrated approach and permits us to take advantage of both high spatial resolution and highest precision measurements to ultimately decipher the age and isotopic composition of discrete domains of multi-phase zircon. We demonstrate our approach with both relatively simple and complex grain populations in an attempt to understand within and between grain heterogeneity. The samples with the simplest zircon systematics have increasingly negative ÉHf from oldest to youngest, consistent with involvement of 4.0 Ga or older crust in later generations; also, none of our samples have been derived solely from strongly depleted sources. The presence of intra-zircon variability within samples from the AGC reflects a complex history of magmatic additions requiring melting/assimilation of older\n\nU-Pb age constraints for the La Tuna Granite and Montevideo Formation (Paleoproterozoic, Uruguay): Unravelling the structure of the RÃ­o de la Plata Craton\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPamoukaghliÃ¡n, Karina; Gaucher, Claudio; Frei, Robert; PoirÃ©, Daniel G.; Chemale, Farid; Frei, Dirk; Will, Thomas M.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe RÃ­o de la Plata Craton is a continental block that crops out in Uruguay, eastern Argentina, southernmost Brazil and Paraguay. It comprises in Uruguay the Piedra Alta, Tandilia and Nico PÃ©rez terranes, separated by the Colonia and the SarandÃ­ del YÃ­ megashears. The La Tuna Granite, which intrudes the Araminda metasandstones in the Tandilia Terrane, was considered Cambrian in age and the intruded sandstones were assigned to the Neoproterozoic Piedras de Afilar Formation. We show that the granite is Paleoproterozoic in age and that the host metasandstones do not belong to the Piedras de Afilar Formation, but to the Paleoproterozoic Montevideo Formation. U-Pb LA ICP-MS of zircon ages for the La Tuna Granite yielded a concordant crystallization age of 2156 Â± 26 Ma. Furthermore a metamorphic event at 2010 Â± 9 Ma is revealed by Pb stepwise leaching dating of monazites. U-Pb detrital zircon ages of the host Araminda metasandstone yield an upper intercept discordia age of 2152 Â± 29 Ma, which marks the intrusion of the La Tuna pluton, and which is in accordance with the zircon U-Pb LA ICP MS constraints. A concordant U-Pb detrital zircon age of 2465 Â± 40 Ma provides a maximum depositional age constraint for the metapsammites. Comparing quartz arenites of the Ediacaran Piedras de Afilar Formation with the Araminda metaquartzites, we conclude that they are very similar regarding petrology but they differ in age and metamorphic overprint. Detrital zircons in quartz arenites of the Piedras de Afilar Formation show youngest ages of 1.0 Ga. On the other hand, detrital zircons recovered from the Araminda metasandstones and the age of the intruding granite allow interpreting a depositional age between 2465 and 2150 Ma. Nd model ages show crustal residence times in average more than 200 myr older for the Tandilia Terrane both in Uruguay and Argentina, with a significant Neoarchean component, which is lacking in the Piedra Alta Terrane.

Albite gneiss of the lower Rogdia Beds includes Cambrian and Neoproterozoic rounded zircons with main U-Pb age peaks at 628 and 988 Ma. These and minor Paleoproterozoic and Archean peaks, together with the lack of Variscan-aged and Mesoproterozoic zircons, are similar to the age spectra obtained from the Phyllite-Quartzite Unit s.str. of the Peloponnesus and eastern Crete and from the Taurides. All of these zircons should be derived from the northeastern passive margin of Gondwana (Cimmeria). Metatuffites of the uppermost Rogdia Beds and metasandstone of Bali beach, on the other hand, include euhedral detrital zircons displaying a Variscan U-Pb age spectra at ca. 300 Ma with concordia ages at 291 Â± 3, 300 Â± 1 Ma (Rogdia) and 286 Â± 3, 300 Â± 3, 313 Â± 2 Ma (Bali). Both types of metasediments and their zircons are similar to those of the pre-Alpine basement and overlying Tyros Beds of eastern Crete, revealing a provenance at the southern active margin of Laurasia. Thus, in central Crete the Paleotethys suture should be situated inside the Rogdia Beds. Magmatic zircons separated from a rhyolite boulder of the lower Achlada Beds yielded a concordant U-Pb zircon age at 242 Â± 2 Ma placing a maximum age for the deposition of the (meta)conglomerate from which the boulder was collected. This age is compatible with an Olenekian-early Anisian age of the underlying Vasilikon marble suggested by new findings of the foraminifera Meandrospira aff. pusilla. Both the Achlada Beds and the Vasilikon marble can be attributed to the lower Tyros Beds of eastern Crete. The Alpine deformation led to a pervasive mylonitic foliation, which is affecting most of the studied rocks. This foliation results from D2 top\n\nLaser Ablation in situ (U-Th-Sm)/He and U-Pb Double-Dating of Apatite and Zircon: Techniques and Applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcInnes, B.; DaniÅ¡Ã­k, M.; Evans, N.; McDonald, B.; Becker, T.; Vermeesch, P.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWe present a new laser-based technique for rapid, quantitative and automated in situ microanalysis of U, Th, Sm, Pb and He for applications in geochronology, thermochronometry and geochemistry (Evans et al., 2015). This novel capability permits a detailed interrogation of the time-temperature history of rocks containing apatite, zircon and other accessory phases by providing both (U-Th-Sm)/He and U-Pb ages (+trace element analysis) on single crystals. In situ laser microanalysis offers several advantages over conventional bulk crystal methods in terms of safety, cost, productivity and spatial resolution. We developed and integrated a suite of analytical instruments including a 193 nm ArF excimer laser system (RESOlution M-50A-LR), a quadrupole ICP-MS (Agilent 7700s), an Alphachron helium mass spectrometry system and swappable flow-through and ultra-high vacuum analytical chambers. The analytical protocols include the following steps: mounting/polishing in PFA Teflon using methods similar to those adopted for fission track etching; laser He extraction and analysis using a 2 s ablation at 5 Hz and 2-3 J/cm2fluence; He pit volume measurement using atomic force microscopy, and U-Th-Sm-Pb (plus optional trace element) analysis using traditional laser ablation methods. The major analytical challenges for apatite include the low U, Th and He contents relative to zircon and the elevated common Pb content. On the other hand, apatite typically has less extreme and less complex zoning of parent isotopes (primarily U and Th). A freeware application has been developed for determining (U-Th-Sm)/He ages from the raw analytical data and Iolite software was used for U-Pb age and trace element determination. In situ double-dating has successfully replicated conventional U-Pb and (U-Th)/He age variations in xenocrystic zircon from the diamondiferous Ellendale lamproite pipe, Western Australia and increased zircon analytical throughput by a factor of 50 over conventional methods\n\nZircon U-Pb Age Distributions in Cogenetic Crystal-Rich Dacitic and Crystal-Poor Rhyolitic Members of Zoned Ignimbrites in the Southern Rocky Mountains by Chemical Abrasion Inductively-Coupled-Plasma Mass Spectrometry (CA-LA-ICP-MS).\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSliwinski, J.; Zimmerer, M. J.; Guillong, M.; Bachmann, O.; Lipman, P. W.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe San Juan locus of the Southern Rocky Mountain Volcanic Field (SRMVF) in SW Colorado represents an erosional remnant of a mid-Tertiary (~37-23 Ma) ignimbrite flare up that produced some of the most voluminous ignimbrites on Earth. A key feature of many SRMVF ignimbrites is compositional zonation, with many volcanic units comprising both dacitic and rhyolitic horizons. Geochemical, field and petrographic evidence suggests that dacites and rhyolites are cogenetic. Here, we report U-Pb zircon ages by chemical abrasion inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (CA-LA-ICPMS) for rhyolitic and dacitic components in four units: the Bonanza, Rat Creek, Carpenter Ridge and Nelson Mountain Tuffs. All units show zircon age spectra that are either within analytical uncertainty of Ar/Ar ages or are appreciably older, indicating prolonged magma residence times (~500 ka) prior to eruption. Anomalously young Pb-loss zones in zircon have been largely removed by chemical abrasion. Older, inherited zircons and zircon cores (60-2000 Ma) are rare in all samples, suggesting limited assimilation of upper crustal Precambrian country rock or complete resorption during recharge events and magma chamber growth.\n\nInterpreting U-Pb data from primary and secondary features in lunar zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrange, M. L.; Pidgeon, R. T.; Nemchin, A. A.; Timms, N. E.; Meyer, C.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we describe primary and secondary microstructures and textural characteristics found in lunar zircon and discuss the relationships between these features and the zircon U-Pb isotopic systems and the significance of these features for understanding lunar processes. Lunar zircons can be classified according to: (i) textural relationships between zircon and surrounding minerals in the host breccias, (ii) the internal microstructures of the zircon grains as identified by optical microscopy, cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) mapping and (iii) results of in situ ion microprobe analyses of the Th-U-Pb isotopic systems. Primary zircon can occur as part of a cogenetic mineral assemblage (lithic clast) or as an individual mineral clast and is unzoned, or has sector and/or oscillatory zoning. The age of primary zircon is obtained when multiple ion microprobe analyses across the polished surface of the grain give reproducible and essentially concordant data. A secondary set of microstructures, superimposed on primary zircon, include localised recrystallised domains, localised amorphous domains, crystal-plastic deformation, planar deformation features and fractures, and are associated with impact processes. The first two secondary microstructures often yield internally consistent and close to concordant U-Pb ages that we interpret as dating impact events. Others secondary microstructures such as planar deformation features, crystal-plastic deformation and micro-fractures can provide channels for Pb diffusion and result in partial resetting of the U-Pb isotopic systems.\n\nZircon U-Pb age and Hf-O isotopes of felsic rocks from the Atlantis Bank, Southwest Indian Ridge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, C. Z.; Zhang, W. Q.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHole U1473A was drilled to 790 meters below seafloor on the Atlantis Bank, an oceanic core complex in the Southwest Indian Ridge, where the upper crust has been removed by detachment faulting. The recovered core consists dominantly of olivine gabbro, with subordinate gabbro, gabbro with varying Fe-Ti oxide concentrations. Felsic veins intermittently occur throughout the whole core section. Zircons separated from twenty-four felsic samples have been conducted for U-Pb dating and O isotope analyses on the Cameca 1280 and Lu-Hf isotopes by laser ablation coupled with a MC-ICPMS. The zircons have highly variable contents of U (12-2078 ppm) and Th (5-801 ppm), yielding Th/U ratios of 0.33-0.81. They are typical oceanic zircons as defined by the trace element discrimination plots of Grimes et al. (2015). The weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages of the analyzed zircons vary from 11.29 to 12.57 Ma. Age differences between felsic veins throughout the whole core are not resolved within analytical uncertainty of the SIMS measurements. All felsic samples have similar zircon Hf isotope compositions, with initial 176Hf/177Hf ratios of 0.283126-0.283197 and ÉHf values of 12.76-15.27. Zircons from all felsic samples but one have mantle-like Î´18O values of 5.14-5.50â°. Zircons from one sample show partial resorption or total recrystallization; in comparison, they have lower Î´18O values of 4.81Â±0.21â°. Such characteristics provide clear evidence for hydrothermal alteration after magmatic intrusion.\n\nZircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic compositions indicate multiple sources for Grenvillian detrital zircon deposited in western Laurentia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoward, Amanda L.; Farmer, G. Lang; Amato, Jeffrey M.; Fedo, Christopher M.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nCombined U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data from 1.0 Ga to 1.3 Ga (Grenvillian) detrital zircon in Neoproterozoic and Cambrian siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in southwest North America, and from igneous zircon in potential Mesoproterozoic source rocks, are used to better assess the provenance of detrital zircon potentially transported across Laurentia in major river systems originating in the Grenville orogenic highlands. High-precision hafnium isotopic analyses of individual â¼1.1 Ga detrital zircon from Neoproterozoic siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in Sonora, northern Mexico, reveal that these zircons have low ÎµHf (0) (-22 to -26) and were most likely derived from â¼1.1 Ga granitic rocks embedded in local Mojave Province Paleoproterozoic crust. In contrast, Grenvillian detrital zircons in Cambrian sedimentary rocks in Sonora, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert, have generally higher ÎµHf (0) (-15 to -21) as demonstrated both by high precision solution-based, and by lower precision laser ablation, ICPMS data and were likely derived from more distal sources further to the east/southeast in Laurentia. Comparison to new and existing zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopic data from Grenvillian crystalline rocks from the Appalachian Mountains, central and west Texas, and from Paleoproterozoic terranes throughout southwest North America reveals that zircon in Cambrian sandstones need not entirely represent detritus transported across the continent from Grenville province rocks in the vicinity of the present-day southern Appalachian Mountains. Instead, these zircons could have been derived from more proximal, high ÎµHf (0), â¼1.1 Ga, crystalline rocks such as those exposed today in the Llano Uplift in central Texas and in the Franklin Mountains of west Texas. Regardless of the exact source(s) of the Grenvillian detrital zircon, new and existing whole-rock Nd isotopic data from Neoproterozoic to Cambrian siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in the Mojave Desert\n\nU-Pb Dating of Zircons and Phosphates in Lunar Meteorites, Acapulcoites and Angrites\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZhou, Q.; Zeigler, R. A.; Yin, Q. Z.; Korotev, R. L.; Joliff, B. L.; Amelin, Y.; Marti, K.; Wu, F. Y.; Li, X. H.; Li, Q. L.;\n\n2012-01-01\n\nZircon U-Pb geochronology has made a great contribution to the timing of magmatism in the early Solar System [1-3]. Ca phosphates are another group of common accessory minerals in meteorites with great potential for U-Pb geochronology. Compared to zircons, the lower closure temperatures of the U-Pb system for apatite and merrillite (the most common phosphates in achondrites) makes them susceptible to resetting during thermal metamorphism. The different closure temperatures of the U-Pb system for zircon and apatite provide us an opportunity to discover the evolutionary history of meteoritic parent bodies, such as the crystallization ages of magmatism, as well as later impact events and thermal metamorphism. We have developed techniques using the Cameca IMS-1280 ion microprobe to date both zircon and phosphate grains in meteorites. Here we report U-Pb dating results for zircons and phosphates from lunar meteorites Dhofar 1442 and SaU 169. To test and verify the reliability of the newly developed phosphate dating technique, two additional meteorites, Acapulco, obtained from Acapulco consortium, and angrite NWA 4590 were also selected for this study as both have precisely known phosphate U-Pb ages by TIMS [4,5]. Both meteorites are from very fast cooled parent bodies with no sign of resetting [4,5], satisfying a necessity for precise dating.\n\nFinding the \"true\" age: ways to read high-precision U-Pb zircon dates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchaltegger, U.; Schoene, B.; Ovtcharova, M.; Sell, B. K.; Broderick, C. A.; Wotzlaw, J.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nRefined U-Pb dating techniques, applying an empirical chemical abrasion treatment prior to analysis [1], and using a precisely calibrated double isotope Pb, U EARTHTIME tracer solution, have led to an unprecedented <0.1% precision and accuracy of obtained 206Pb/238U dates of single zircon crystals or fragments. Results very often range over 10e4 to 10e6 years and cannot be treated as statistically singular age populations. The interpretation of precise zircon U-Pb ages is biased by two problems: (A) Post-crystallization Pb loss from decay damaged areas is considered to be mitigated by applying chemical abrasion techniques. The success of such treatment can, however, not be assumed a priori. The following examples demonstrate that youngest zircons are not biased by lead loss but represent close-to-youngest zircon growth: (i) coincidence of youngest zircon dates with co-magmatic titanite in tonalite; (ii) coincidence with statistically equivalent clusters of 206Pb/238U dates from zircon in residual melts of cogenetic mafic magmas; (iii) youngest zircons in ash beds of sedimentary sequences do not violate the stratigraphic superposition, whereas conventional statistical interpretation (mean or median values) does; (iv) results of published inter-laboratory cross-calibration tests using chemical abrasion on natural zircon crystals of the same sample arrive at the same 206Pb/238U result within <0.1% (e.g., [2]); (v) Youngest crystals coincide in age with the astronomical age of hosting cyclic sediments. Residual lead loss may, however, still be identified in the case of single, significantly younger dates (>3 sigma), and are common in many pre-Triassic and hydrothermally altered rocks. (B) Pre-eruptive/pre-intrusive growth is found to be the main reason for scattered zircon ages in igneous rocks. Zircons crystallizing from the final magma batch are called autocrystic [3]. Autocrystic growth will happen in a moving or stagnant magma shortly before or after the\n\nIn situ location and U-Pb dating of small zircon grains in igneous rocks using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-quadrupole mass spectrometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSack, Patrick J.; Berry, Ron F.; Meffre, Sebastien; Falloon, Trevor J.; Gemmell, J. Bruce; Friedman, Richard M.\n\n2011-05-01\n\nA new U-Pb zircon dating protocol for small (10-50 Î¼m) zircons has been developed using an automated searching method to locate zircon grains in a polished rock mount. The scanning electron microscope-energy-dispersive X ray spectrum-based automated searching method can routinely find in situ zircon grains larger than 5 Î¼m across. A selection of these grains was ablated using a 10 Î¼m laser spot and analyzed in an inductively coupled plasma-quadrupole mass spectrometer (ICP-QMS). The technique has lower precision (Ë6% uncertainty at 95% confidence on individual spot analyses) than typical laser ablation ICP-MS (Ë2%), secondary ion mass spectrometry (<1%), and isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (Ë0.4%) methods. However, it is accurate and has been used successfully on fine-grained lithologies, including mafic rocks from island arcs, ocean basins, and ophiolites, which have traditionally been considered devoid of dateable zircons. This technique is particularly well suited for medium- to fine-grained mafic volcanic rocks where zircon separation is challenging and can also be used to date rocks where only small amounts of sample are available (clasts, xenoliths, dredge rocks). The most significant problem with dating small in situ zircon grains is Pb loss. In our study, many of the small zircons analyzed have high U contents, and the isotopic compositions of these grains are consistent with Pb loss resulting from internal Î± radiation damage. This problem is not significant in very young rocks and can be minimized in older rocks by avoiding high-U zircon grains.\n\nFrom opening to subduction of an oceanic domain constrained by LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating (Variscan belt, Southern Armorican Massif, France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPaquette, J.-L.; BallÃ¨vre, M.; Peucat, J.-J.; Cornen, G.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn the Variscan belt of Western Europe, the lifetime and evolution of the oceanic domain is poorly constrained by sparse, outdated and unreliable multigrain ID-TIMS U-Pb zircon dating. In this article, we present a complete in situ LA-ICP-MS dataset of about 300 U-Pb zircon analyses obtained on most of the ophiolitic and eclogitic outcrops of Southern Brittany, comprising new dating of previously published zircon populations and newly discovered rock samples. In situ dating and cathodo-luminescence imaging of each zircon grain yields new absolute time-constraints on the evolution of the Galicia-Moldanubian Ocean. The new results confirm that the opening of this oceanic domain is well defined at about 490 Ma. In contrast, the generally-quoted 400-410 Ma-age for the high-pressure event related to the subduction of the oceanic crust is definitely not recorded in the zircons of the eclogites. In light of these new data, we propose that the obduction of oceanic rocks occurred at about 370-380 Ma while the high-pressure event is recorded at 355 Ma in only a few zircon grains of some eclogite samples. Additionally, this large scale dating project demonstrates that the zircons from eclogites do not systematically recrystallise during the high pressure event and consequently their U-Pb systems do not record that metamorphism systematically. These zircons rather preserve the isotopic memory of the magmatic crystallization of their igneous protolith. Another example of an eclogite sample from the French Massif Central illustrates the frequent mistake in the interpretation of the ages of the early hydrothermal alteration of zircons in the oceanic crust versus partial or complete recrystallization during eclogite facies metamorphism.\n\nIsotope U-Pb age on single zircon and REE distribution in rocks and zircon from paleoproterozoic Kandalaksha-Kolvitsa complex Baltic shield\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSteshenko, Ekaterina; Bayanova, Tamara; Drogobuzhskaya, Svetlana; Lyalina, Ludmila; Serov, Pavel; Chashchin, Viktor; Elizarov, Dmitriy\n\n2017-04-01\n\nKandalaksha-Kolvitsa paleoproterozoic complex located in the N-E part of Baltic shield and consists of three zones. Marginal zone (mesocratic metanorite) lies at the base of the massif. Main zone is composed of leucocratic metagabbro. The upper zone is alteration of mataanorthosite and leucocratic metagabbro. All rocks were subjected to granulate and anorthositic metamorphism. Age of magmatic crystallization of the massif was determined for the first time, using the U-Pb isotope method for single zircon grains. Three fractions of single zircons from anorthosite of the Kandalaksha massif gave precise U-Pb age of 2435.5 Â± 4.8 Ma. For the first time REE concentration (WR) was determined using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent 7500 ce ICP-MS) in the main varieties of rocks of the Kandalaksha-Kolvitsa paleoproterozoic complex. Anorthosite and leucocratic metagabbros (main zone) are characterized by a flat spectrum distribution of HREE, which were normalized by [1]. The REE pattern is characterized by significant positive anomalies of Eu ((Eu / Eu *)n = 3.72-3.91) in anorthosite and leucogabbros and 7.26 - in ortoamfibolitah. General content of individual elements that are common for this type of rocks: Cen = 5.82-8.54, Ybn = 1.54-1.58, which indicates that the process of crystallization of the rock occurred with predominant accumulation of plagioclase. According to geochemical and Nd-Sr isotopic data (ISr=0.702 - 0.706, ÉNd(T) = +1 - (-3)) Kandalaksha Kolvitsa complex, appear to have a general plume source with Paleoproterozoic layered intrusions of the Baltic Shield [2] Distribution of REE (ELAN-9000 ICP-MS) in zircon have a typical magmatic species: a positive Ce, negative Eu anomaly and HREE flat spectrum. Titanium content in zircons were measured for the calculation of their crystallization temperature with 8350C. These data are evidence of magmatic origin of zircon [3].

Differences in bulk chemical composition are small as well. Here we examine the feasibility to assign an age to a distal tephra layer in the La Sal Mountains, Utah, by U-Pb dating of zircons and to correlate it with one of the two Jemez eruptions. We also dated original Jemez tephras for comparison. Even though the tephras are very young, we obtained reasonable age determinations using the youngest cluster of zircon grains overlapping in age at 2Ï. Thereafter, the Guaje tephra is 1.513 Â± 0.021 Myr old. The La Sal Mountains tephra is correlated with the Tsankawi tephra. Three samples yielded a common age range of 1.31-1.40 Myr. All ages are in slight disagreement with published age determinations obtained by 40Ar / 39Ar dating. These findings indicate that distal Jemez tephras can be distinguished by U-Pb dating. Furthermore, we encourage giving this method a try for age assignments even of Quaternary volcanic material.\n\nImplications of Bishop Tuff zircon U-Pb ages for rates of zircon growth and magma accumulation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nReid, M. R.; Schmitt, A. K.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nRates of geologic processes obtained from natural studies rely on accurate geochronologic information. An important benchmark in geochronology as well as a valuable source of insights into the evolution of voluminous explosive eruptions is the >600 km3 Bishop Tuff (BT). A recently determined weighted mean 206Pb/238U date of 767.1Â±0.9 ka for a BT zircon population [1] is indistinguishable from the recalibrated 40Ar/39Ar sanidine date of 767.4Â±2.2 ka [2], potentially providing a key intercalibration point between astronomical and radio-isotopic dating approaches. Consequences of these results are linear zircon growth rates of >1Ã10-14 cm/sec and magma accumulation rates of >200 km3/ka. In contrast, spatially selective SIMS U-Pb dating of BT zircons yielded mean pre-eruption ages of 850 ka [3], a difference that raises questions about the validity of intercalibration between U-Pb and K-Ar dating methods and the history of magma accumulation. We obtained new SIMS analyses of the BT zircons using more spatially and analytically sensitive methods and verifying our accuracy against the TIMS dated Quaternary zircon 61.308A (2.488Â±0.002 Ma). Analyses were performed on zircon rims and on oriented cross-sections exposed during optical interferometry-calibrated serial sectioning removing the outermost ~31 Î¼m. Sputtering by a 100 nA ion beam versus the normally employed 10-12 nA beam resulted in enhanced radiogenic Pb yields and analytical uncertainties for Quaternary zircon approaching the U-Pb age reproducibility of the primary zircon standard (~1-2 % for AS3). Ages obtained at ~31 Î¼m depth (representing <5% of crystal growth in most cases) average 892Â±26ka (MSWD=0.29), corroborating previous evidence for residence times of several tens of ka. Rim ages average 781Â±22 ka (MSWD=0.61), overlapping Ar/Ar determinations of eruption age and corroborating the importance of near-eruption aged zircon growth.

However, for zircons compromised by open system behavior, achieving robust dates can be difficult. Chemical abrasion (CA) is a routine step prior to thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) dating of zircon to remove radiation-damaged parts of grains that may have experienced open system behavior and loss of radiogenic Pb. While this technique has been shown to improve the accuracy and precision of TIMS dating, its application to high-spatial resolution dating methods, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), is relatively uncommon. In our efforts to U-Pb date zircons from the late Eocene Caetano caldera by SIMS (SHRIMP-RG: sensitive high resolution ion microprobe, reverse geometry), some grains yielded anomalously young U-Pb ages that implicated Pb-loss and motivated us to investigate with a comparative CA and non-CA dating study. We present CA and non-CAÂ 206Pb/238U ages and trace elements determined by SHRIMP-RG for zircons from three Caetano samples (Caetano Tuff, Redrock Canyon porphyry, and a silicic ring-fracture intrusion) and for R33 and TEMORA-2 reference zircons. We find that non-CA Caetano zircons have weighted mean or bimodal U-Pb ages that are 2â4% younger than CA zircons for the same samples. CA Caetano zircons have mean U-Pb ages that are 0.4â0.6Â Myr older than theÂ 40Ar/39Ar sanidine eruption age (34.00Â Â±Â 0.03Â Ma; error-weighted mean, 2Ï), whereas non-CA zircons have ages that are 0.7â1.3Â Myr younger. U-Pb ages do not correlate with U (~Â 100â800Â ppm), Th (~Â 50â300Â ppm) or any other measured zircon trace elements (Y, Hf, REE), and CA and non-CA Caetano zircons define identical trace element ranges. No statistically significant difference in U-Pb age is observed for CA versus non-CA R33 or TEMORA-2 zircons.

With the galvanometric optics, laser ablation of two or more sample materials could be achieved in very short time intervals (~10 ms). The resulting sample aerosols released from different ablation pits or different solid samples were mixed and homogenized within the sample cell and then transported into the ICP ion source. Multiple spot laser ablation enables spiking of analytes or internal standard elements directly into the solid samples, and therefore the standard addition calibration method can be applied for the determination of trace elements in solid samples. In this study, we have measured the rare earth element (REE) abundances of two zircon samples (Nancy 91500 and PreÅ¡ovice) based on the standard addition technique, using a direct spiking of analytes through a multispot laser ablation of the glass standard material (NIST SRM612). The resulting REE abundance data show good agreement with previously reported values within analytical uncertainties achieved in this study (10% for most elements). Our experiments demonstrated that nonspectroscopic interferences on 14 REEs could be significantly reduced by the standard addition technique employed here. Another advantage of galvanometric devices is the accumulation of sample aerosol released from multiple spots. In this study we have measured the U-Pb age of a zircon sample (LMR) using an accumulation of sample aerosols released from 10 separate ablation pits of low diameters (~8 Î¼m). The resulting (238)U-(206)Pb age data for the LMR zircons was 369 Â± 64 Ma, which is in good agreement with previously reported age data (367.6 Â± 1.5 Ma). (1) The data obtained here clearly demonstrate that the multiple spot laser ablation-ICPMS technique can become a powerful approach for elemental and isotopic\n\nNew zircon (U-Th)/He and U/Pb eruption age for the Rockland tephra, western USA\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCoble, Matthew A.; Burgess, Seth; Klemetti, Erik W.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEruption ages of a number of prominent Quaternary volcanic deposits remain inaccurately and/or imprecisely constrained, despite their importance as regional stratigraphic markers in paleo-environment reconstruction and as evidence of climate-altering eruptions. Accurately dating volcanic deposits presents challenging analytical considerations, including poor radiogenic yield, scarcity of datable minerals, and contamination of crystal populations by magma, eruption, and transport processes. One prominent example is the Rockland tephra, which erupted from the Lassen Volcanic Center in the southern Cascade arc. Despite a range in published eruption ages from 0.40 to 0.63 Ma, the Rockland tephra is extensively used as a marker bed across the western United States. To more accurately and precisely constrain the age of the Rockland tephra-producing eruption, we report U/Pb crystallization dates from the outermost â¼2Â Î¼m of zircon crystal faces (surfaces) using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).

Accurately dating volcanic deposits presents challenging analytical considerations, including poor radiogenic yield, scarcity of datable minerals, and contamination of crystal populations by magma, eruption, and transport processes. One prominent example is the Rockland tephra, which erupted from the Lassen Volcanic Center in the southern Cascade arc. Despite a range in published eruption ages from 0.40 to 0.63 Ma, the Rockland tephra is extensively used as a marker bed across the western United States. To more accurately and precisely constrain the age of the Rockland tephra-producing eruption, we report U/Pb crystallization dates from the outermost â¼2 Î¼m of zircon crystal faces (surfaces) using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Our new weighted mean 238U/206Pb age for Rockland tephra zircon surfaces is 0.598 Â± 0.013 Ma (2Ï) and MSWD = 1.11 (mean square weighted deviation).

We report a LA-ICPMS analytical procedure for UâPb dating of this mineral with no need for an independently dated matrix-matched cassiterite standard. LA-ICPMS U-Th-Pb data were acquired while using NIST 612 glass as a primary non-matrix-matched standard. Raw data are reduced using a combination of Ioliteâ¢ and other off-line data reduction methods. Cassiterite is extremely difficult to digest, so traditional approaches in LA-ICPMS U-Pb geochronologyÂ that utilize well-characterized matrix-matched reference materialsÂ (e.g., age values determined by ID-TIMS) cannot be easily implemented. We propose a new approach for in situ LA-ICPMS dating of cassiterite, which benefits from the unique chemistry of cassiterite with extremely low Th concentrations (Th/U ratio of 10â4Â or lower) in some cassiterite samples. Accordingly, it is assumed thatÂ 208Pb measured in cassiterite is mostly of non-radiogenic originâit was initially incorporated in cassiterite during mineral formation, and can be used as a proxy for common Pb. UsingÂ 208Pb as a common Pb proxy instead ofÂ 204Pb is preferred asÂ 204Pb is much less abundant and is also compromised byÂ 204Hg interference during the LA-ICPMS analyses.Our procedure relies onÂ 208Pb/206Pb vsÂ 207Pb/206Pb (Pb-Pb) and Tera-WasserburgÂ 207Pb/206Pb vsÂ 238U/206Pb (U-Pb) isochron dates that are calculated for a ~1.54â¯Ga low-Th cassiterite reference material with varying amounts of common Pb that we assume remained a closed U-Pb system. The difference between the NIST 612 glass normalized biased U-Pb date and the Pb-Pb age of the reference material is used to calculate a correction factor (F) for instrumental U-PbÂ fractionation. The correction factor (F) is then applied to measured U/Pb ratios and Tera-Wasserburg isochron dates are obtained for the unknown\n\nSignatures of mountain building: Detrital zircon U/Pb ages from northeast Tibet\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLease, Richard O.; Burbank, Douglas W.; Gehrels, George E.; Wang, Zhicai; Yuan, Daoyang\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAlthough detrital zircon has proven to be a powerful tool for determining provenance, past work has focused primarily on delimiting regional source terranes. Here we explore the limits of spatial resolution and stratigraphic sensitivity of detrital zircon in ascertaining provenance, and we demonstrate its ability to detect source changes for terranes separated by only a few tens of kilometers. For such an analysis to succeed for a given mountain, discrete intrarange source terranes must have unique U/Pb zircon age signatures and sediments eroded from the range must have well-defined depositional ages. Here we use â¼1400 single-grain U/Pb zircon ages from northeastern Tibet to identify and analyze an area that satisfies these conditions. This analysis shows that the edges of intermontane basins are stratigraphically sensitive to discrete, punctuated changes in local source terranes. By tracking eroding rock units chronologically through the stratigraphic record, this sensitivity permits the detection of the differential rock uplift and progressive erosion that began ca. 8 Ma in the Laji Shan, a 10-25-km-wide range in northeastern Tibet with a unique U/Pb age signature.\n\nAir abrasion experiments in U-Pb dating of zircon\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGoldich, S.S.; Fischer, L.B.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nAir abrasion of zircon grains can remove metamict material that has lost radiogenic Pb and zircon overgrowths that were added during younger events and thereby improve the precision of the age measurements and permit closer estimates of the original age. Age discordance that resulted from a single disturbance of the U-Pb isotopic decay systems, as had been demonstrated by T.E. Krogh, can be considerably reduced, and, under favorable conditions, the ages brought into concordancy. Two or more events complicate the U-Pb systematics, but a series of abrasion experiments can be helpful in deciphering the geologic history and in arriving at a useful interpretation of the probable times of origin and disturbances. In east-central Minnesota, U.S.A., Penokean tonalite gneiss is dated at 1869 ?? 5 Ma, and sheared granite gneiss is shown to have been a high-level granite intrusion at 1982 ?? 5 Ma in the McGrath Gneiss precursor. Tonalite gneiss and a mafic granodiorite in the Rainy Lake area, Ontario, Canada, are dated at 2736 ?? 16 and 2682 ?? 4 Ma, respectively.

This assemblage is known to have experienced multiple deformation and metamorphic events followed by emplacement of voluminous granites and basaltic dykes. Based on Sm-Nd whole rock data on the basement Mewar orthogneisses of Jhamarkotra region (Gopalan et al., 1990) and Pb/Pb ages of zircon from Gingla Granites which intrudes the basement (Wiedenbeck et al., 1996), it has been inferred that the whole magmatic episode leading to the formation of the basement spanned from 3300 to 2400 Ma and that the Aravalli cratonic block had broadly stabilized by 2500 Ma on which the younger Aravalli and Delhi Supergroup unconformably deposited. However, no comprehensive age data on the basement gneisses from the study area spanning the entire magmatic episode is available. This work attempts to provide a time frame work for evolution of the basement gneisses of the Aravalli Craton. We present here U-Pb zircon ages from the Precambrian basement TTG gneisses of the Aravalli Craton of north western India. Pb and U were measured on multicollector Finnigan-MAT 262 mass spectrometer. The temperatures of measurements were 1300Â°C for Pb and 1500Â°C for U. Pb isotope ratios were corrected for mass fractionation with a factor of 0.10% per amu, based on repeat analyses of the standard NBS SRM 982. The U analyses were corrected for mass fractionation with a factor of 0.003% per amu, based on repeat analyses of the NBS U 500 standard. Reproducibility of the U-Pb ratios was determined from the repeated analysis of standard zircon IGFM-87 (Ukraine) and taken as 0.5% for 207Pb/235U and 206Pb/238U ratios, respectively, at 95% confidence level. All calculations were done using the programs PBDAT and ISOPLOT (Ludwig 1991, 2008).

For maximum reliability, it is critically important that the utilised standard be homogeneous at all scales of analysis. It is equally important that the standard has been precisely and accurately dated by an independent technique. This study reports the emergence of a new zircon standard that meets those criteria, as demonstrated by Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe (SHRIMP), isotope dilution thermal ionisation mass-spectrometry (IDTIMS) and excimer laser ablation- inductively coupled plasma-mass-spectrometry (ELA-ICP-MS) documentation. The TEMORA 1 zircon standard derives from the Middledale Gabbroic Diorite, a high-level mafic stock within the Palaeozoic Lachlan Orogen of eastern Australia. Its 206Pb/238U IDTIMS age has been determined to be 416.75??0.24 Ma (95% confidence limits), based on measurement errors alone.

The origin of zircon, i.e., magmatic or metamorphic, is commonly assessed by its external morphology, internal structure, mineral inclusions, Th/U ratios and trace element composition. In this study, we present an unusual case of metamorphic zircon from the Qiangtang eclogite, north-central Tibet. The zircon grains contain numerous eclogite-facies mineral inclusions, including omphacite, phengite, garnet and rutile; hence, they are clearly of metamorphic origin. However, they display features similar to common magmatic zircon, including euhedral crystal habit, high Th/U ratios and enriched heavy rare earth elements pattern. We suggest that these zircon grains formed from a different reservoir from that for garnet where no trace elements was present and trace element equilibrium between zircon and garnet was achieved. U-Pb dating of zircon gave an age of 232-237 Ma for the eclogite, and that of rutile yielded a slightly younger age of ca. 217 Ma. These ages are consistent with the reported Lu-Hf mineral isochron and phengite Ar-Ar ages. The zircon U-Pb and mineral Lu-Hf isochron ages are interpreted as the time of the peak eclogite-facies metamorphism, whereas the rutile U-Pb and phengite Ar-Ar ages represent the time of exhumation to the middle crust. Thus, the distinction between metamorphic and magmatic zircons cannot be made using only Th/U ratios and heavy REE compositions for HP-UHP metamorphic rocks of oceanic derivation.\n\nDetrital zircon U-Pb Geochronology of the Boleo Formation of Santa RosalÃa Basin, Baja California Sur, MÃ©xico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHenry, M.; Alvarez Ortega, K. G.; Banes, A.; Holm-Denoma, C.; Busby, C.; Niemi, T.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Santa RosalÃ­a Basin (SRB) is a rift basin related to the opening of the Gulf of California. The Boleo Formation is the oldest and dominant sedimentary fill of the SRB, with a poorly constrained age. We carried out a U-Pb detrital zircon (DZ) study of the Boleo Formation to constrain its maximum depositional age. The Boleo Formation has a basal limestone-gypsum section, overlain by an up to 250 m thick clastic sequence, with coarsening upward cycles of mudstone, sandstone, and conglomerate. Cu-Zn-Co-Mn stratiform ore deposits (\"mantos\") cap the conglomerate in each cycle, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 (from top to bottom of section1). Sandstone samples were collected for U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology from four stratigraphic levels beneath a manto, including one each below mantos 1, 3 and 4, as well as two localities beneath manto 2. Additionally, one sample was collected above the gypsum. The sandstones are lithic feldspathic wackes derived from erosion of andesitic arc volcanic rocks, which generally lack zircon, so large DZ samples were collected. A field Wilfley table was constructed from local materials as a first step to concentrate heavy minerals, from 88 kg/sample to 16 kg/sample. The field-processed samples were further concentrated in the lab using standard zircon separation methods. Yields were excellent, 1,000 zircons per sample. We analyzed 315 zircons per sample by LA-ICPMS, using the Arizona LaserChron Center. DZ ages from the Boleo Formation range dominantly from Late Miocene through Early Cretaceous, with minor Paleozoic and Precambrian ages. However, the maximum depositional age of the formation is constrained by 40 Ar/39 Ar age of 9.42 +/- 0.29 Ma on underlying volcanic rocks2. Only 5 to 22 zircons per sample are less than 10 Ma, and of those, all stratigraphic levels are dominated mostly by 9 Ma zircons, except for the stratigraphically highest sample. Zircons from this form a coherent group of 3 with a TuffZirc age of 6.04 +/- 0.02 (75\n\nComplex Histories of Two Lunar Zircons as Evidenced by their Internal Structures and U-Pb Ages\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPidgeon, R.

K.; Bachmann, O.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nLaser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) of eight zircon reference materials and synthetic zircon-hafnon end-members indicate that corrections for abundance sensitivity and molecular zirconium sesquioxide ions (Zr2O3+) are critical for reliable determination of 230Th abundances in zircon. Other polyatomic interferences in the mass range 223-233 amu are insignificant. When corrected for abundance sensitivity and interferences, activity ratios of (230Th)/(238U) for the zircon reference materials we used average 1.001 Â± 0.010 (1Ï error; mean square of weighted deviates MSWD = 1.45; n = 8). This includes the 91500 and PleÅ¡ovice zircons, which were deemed unsuitable for calibration of (230Th)/(238U) by Ito (2014). Uranium series zircon ages generated by LA-ICP-MS without mitigating (e.g., by high mass resolution) or correcting for abundance sensitivity and molecular interferences on 230Th such as those presented by Ito (2014) are potentially unreliable.\n\nInvestigating sources of ignimbrites in the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex using U-Pb dating of zircons\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKern, J. M.; de Silva, S. L.; Schmitt, A. K.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nLarge silicic volcanic fields (LSVFs) are thought to represent the surface expression of upper crustal batholith emplacement, with the spatiotemporal distribution of the vents and eruptions representing the development of the system. The Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC) in the Central Andes is a LSVF active from 11-1 Ma that erupted over 13,000 km3 of magma from large, multicyclic caldera centers and smaller ignimbrite shields during 3 distinct pulses of volcanism at 8.4, 5.5, and 4.0 Ma. Links to the magmatic system beneath are being pursued through U-Pb zircon dating of APVC ignimbrites. Initial results comprise 61 238U/206Pb zircon ages of mostly marginal crystal domains from five APVC ignimbrites-the 0.98 Â± 0.03 Ma Purico, 3.96 Â± 0.08 Ma Atana, 4.0 Â± 0.9 Ma Toconao, 4.09 Â± 0.02 Ma Puripicar, and 8.33 Â± 0.06 Ma Sifon ignimbrites-dated by high-resolution secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS). Each zircon analyzed was less than 350 Î¼m in length and cathodoluminescence images reveal zonations within individual zircons, though significant core-rim age differences are rare. The ~1 Ma Purico ignimbrite displays multiple zircon age populations significantly predating the 40Ar/39Ar eruption age, but younger than ages from the nearby large-volume Atana ignimbrite erupted from La Pacana caldera. Some peaks do, however, coincide with later resurgent activity within La Pacana as expressed by the 2.7 Ma Cerro Bola dome. Zircon ages in the Atana ignimbrite are indistinguishable from its eruption, while those from the 4.0 Ma Toconao ignimbrite-the volatile-rich cap of the Atana magma chamber-contains three populations of xenocrystic zircons from the Proterozoic-Ordivician, ~13 Ma, and ~9 Ma. The ~9 Ma zircons correlate with K-Ar ages from an underlying ignimbrite, whereas the 13 Ma xenocrysts likely have a plutonic source. The Purico ignimbrite thus provides direct evidence of zircon inheritance from previous eruption cycles, while the Toconao records a\n\nProvenance of the exotic Northern Sierra terrane (North American Cordillera) based on U-Pb detrital zircon data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPowerman, V.; Girty, G.; Hanson, R. E.; Grove, M.; Miller, E. L.; Hourigan, J. K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAges of detrital zircons from the Northern Sierra terrane (NST) suggest an exotic provenance with respect to NW Laurentia. We have acquired U-Pb LA-ICPMS dz ages from 16 samples collected from the uppermost NST allochthon, the Sierra City mÃ©lange, and 1 sample from the lower Culbertson Lake allochthon. Age distributions can be divided into 3 partly intersecting groups: (a) 6 mÃ©lange samples and the 1 Culbertson Lake allochthon sample are dominated by >1 Ga grains; (b)5 samples are characterized by the additional presence of Early Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic grains (520-640;680-800;840-1000Ma); (c) 9 samples, 8 feldspathic, 1âqtz-rich, can be also characterized by the presence of 360-520Ma grains. These results strengthen the non Laurentian nature of detrital sources:(1)most of the detrital age distributions possess ages in the 1.49-1.61Ga interval, the \"N.American magmatic gap\";(2) Ediacaran zircons cannot be linked to any igneous event within West Laurentia. Most samples possess detrital age distributions that include the 1.0-2.0 Ga peak, characteristic of Baltica rather than Laurentia. These data, supplemented by SHRIMP-RG data (353-368Ma) from stitching igneous units suggest the following model: parts of NST were located at the NE margin of Baltica in the early Paleozoic, receiving \"Baltica\" (1.0-2.0 Ga) and \"Timanide\"(Late Vendian â Early Cambrian) zircons. This crustal block was later rifted away from Baltica and by mid-Paleozoic was juxtaposed with allochthons of presumably NW Laurentia provenance. The assembled terrane was involved in a subduction zone, resulting in the emplacement of 353-368Ma igneous rocks. The U-Pb detrital zircon age distributions presented here are similar to signatures of strata in along strike exotic terranes of the North American Cordillera (such as the Yreka terrane of the Klamath Mts., the Alexander terrane of S.Alaska and the Arctic Chukotka-Alaska terrane) by having Timanian, Baltica, and Caledonian signatures. Hence, it\n\nTectono-magmatic evolution of the Chihuahua-Sinaloa border region in northern Mexico: Insights from zircon-apatite U-Pb geochronology, zircon Hf isotope composition and geochemistry of granodiorite intrusions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMahar, Munazzam Ali; Goodell, Philip C.; Feinstein, Michael Nicholas\n\n2016-11-01\n\nWe present the whole-rock geochemistry, LA-ICP-MS zircon-apatite U-Pb ages and zircon Hf isotope composition of the granodioritic plutons at the southwestern boundary of Chihuahua with the states of Sinaloa and Sonora. These granodiorites are exposed in the north and south of the Rio El Fuerte in southwest Chihuahua and northern Sinaloa. The magmatism spans over a time period of 37 Ma from 90 to 53 Ma. Zircons are exclusively magmatic with strong oscillatory zoning. No inheritance of any age has been observed. Our new U-Pb dating ( 250 analyses) does not support the involvement of older basement lithologies in the generation of the granitic magmas. The U-Pb apatite ages from granodiorites in southwest Chihuahua vary from 52 to 70 Ma. These apatite ages are 1 to 20 Ma younger than the corresponding zircon U-Pb crystallization ages, suggesting variable cooling rates from very fast to 15 Â°C/Ma ( 800 Â°C to 500 Â°C) and shallow to moderate emplacement depths. In contrast, U-Pb apatite ages from the Sinaloa batholith are restricted from 64 to 61 Ma and are indistinguishable from the zircon U-Pb ages range from 67 to 60 Ma within the error, indicating rapid cooling and very shallow emplacement. However, one sample from El Realito showed a larger difference of 20 Ma in zircon-apatite age pair: zircon 80 Â± 0.8 Ma and apatite 60.6 Â± 4 Ma, suggesting a slower cooling rate of 15 Â°C/Ma. The weighted mean initial ÎµHf (t) isotope composition (2Ï) of granodiorites varies from + 1.8 to + 5.2. The radiogenic Hf isotope composition coupled with previous Sr-Nd isotope data demonstrates a significant shift from multiple crustal sources in the Sonoran batholithic belt to the predominant contribution of the mantle-derived magmas in the southwest Chihuahua and northern Sinaloa. Based on U-Pb ages, the absence of inheritance, typical high Th/U ratio and radiogenic Hf isotope composition, we suggest that the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene magmatic rocks in this region are not derived from\n\nPre-Variscan evolution of the Western Tatra Mountains: new insights from U-Pb zircon dating.\n\nPubMed\n\nBurda, Jolanta; KlÃ¶tzli, Urs\n\nIn situ LA-MC-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon geochronology combined with cathodoluminescence imaging were carried out to determine protolith and metamorphic ages of orthogneisses from the Western Tatra Mountains (Central Western Carpathians). The metamorphic complex is subdivided into two units (the Lower Unit and the Upper Unit). Orthogneisses of the Lower Unit are mostly banded, fine- to medium-grained rocks while in the Upper Unit varieties with augen structures predominate. Orthogneisses show a dynamically recrystallised mineral assemblage of Qzâ+âPlâ+âBtâÂ±âGrt with accessory zircon and apatite. They are peraluminous (ASIâ=â1.20-1.27) and interpreted to belong to a high-K calc-alkaline suite of a VAG-type tectonic setting. LA-MC-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon data from samples from both units, from crystals with oscillatory zoning and Th/Uâ>â0.1, yield similar concordia ages of ca. 534Â Ma. This is interpreted to reflect the magmatic crystallization age of igneous precursors. These oldest meta-magmatics so far dated in the Western Tatra Mountains could be linked to the fragmentation of the northern margin of Gondwana. In zircons from a gneiss from the Upper Unit, cores with well-developed oscillatory zoning are surrounded by weakly luminescent, low contrast rims (Th/Uâ<â0.1). These yield a concordia age of ca. 387Â Ma corresponding to a subsequent, Eo-Variscan, high-grade metamorphic event, connected with the formation of crustal-scale nappe structures and collision-related magmatism.\n\nU-Pb systematics in coexisting zircon, rutile and titanite from granophyres in the Archean Stillwater Complex: metamictization and the fate of radiogenic Pb\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFriedman, R. M.; Wall, C. J.; Scoates, J. S.; Meurer, W. P.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nSelf-irradiation of zircon causes structural damage (metamictization) that can result in the loss of radiogenic Pb during interaction with aqueous solutions. To evaluate this behavior in metamict zircon, and in other U-bearing accessory phases like titanite and rutile, we are examining the U-Pb systematics of granophyric rocks from the ca. 2.7 Ga Stillwater layered intrusion, Montana. Four samples were studied in detail, including a pegmatitic ksp-qtz core to a gabbroic pegmatoid in the Lower Banded Series (N1), an alaskite and an amphibole-rich reaction zone between the alaskite and anorthosite (AN1) in the Middle Banded Series, and an amphibole-bearing granophyre from the Upper Banded Series (GN3). Except in the pegmatite, zircon is variably metamict with amorphous zones characterized by distinctive Ca-enrichment. Single zircon grains were analyzed by ID-TIMS following annealing and chemical abrasion, and multi-grain (n=4-5) fractions of titanite and rutile were analyzed by conventional ID-TIMS; the UBC 233-235U-205Pb isotopic tracer is calibrated against mixed U-Pb gravimetric reference solutions made available through the EarthTime initiative. The U-Pb systematics are coherent only for the pegmatite yielding both a Concordia age of 2709.60 Â± 0.80 Ma (2Ï, including tracer calibration, decay-constant errors not included) for low-U zircon (76-237 ppm) and concordant titanite results with 207Pb/206Pb ages from 2701-2710 Ma. The results for high-U zircon (up to 1438 ppm) for the other three samples are strongly discordant (9-43%, 85-89%, 28-71%, respectively) with a wide range of 207Pb/206Pb ages (2583-2647 Ma, 2210-2357 Ma, 2345-2499 Ma). Given the extreme incompatibility of Pb2+ in zircon and the highly metamict state of zircon in these granophyres, we are investigating the extent to which radiogenic lead is selectively removed during the chemical abrasion and annealing process from step-wise leaching experiments and image analysis (CL, SEM).

Poorly exposed, its age and correlation are uncertain. Is it part of the Pigeon Point section west of the San GregorioâHosgri fault? Does it rest on Nacimiento block basement? Is it dextrally offset from the Oligocene Cambria Felsite, â¼185 km to the southeast? Why is a calc-alkaline hypabyssal igneous rock intrusive into the outboard accretionary prism? To address these questions, we analyzed 43 oscillatory-zoned zircon crystals from three incipiently recrystallized pumpellyite Â± prehnite Â± laumontite-bearing Pescadero felsite samples by sensitive high-resolution ion microprobeâreverse geometry (SHRIMP-RG) and laser ablationâinductively coupled plasmaâmass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) techniques. Thirty-three zircons gave late Mesozoic U-Pb ages, with single-grain values ranging from 81 to 167 Ma; ten have pre-Mesozoic, chiefly Proterozoic ages. A group of the four youngest Pescadero zircons yielded an apparent maximum igneous age of ca. 86â90 Ma. Reflecting broad age scatter and presence of partly digested sandstone inclusions, we interpret the rest of the zircons (perhaps all) as xenocrysts. Twenty-three zircons were separated and analyzed from two samples of the similar Cambria Felsite, yielding a unimodal 27 Ma U-Pb age. Clearly, the origin of the Upper Oligocene Cambria Felsite is different from that of the Upper Cretaceous Pescadero felsite; these rocks are not correlated, and do not constrain displacement along the San GregorioâHosgri fault. Peak ages differ slightly, but relative probability curves for Mesozoic and pre-Mesozoic Pescadero zircons compare well, for example, with abundant U-Pb age data for detrital zircons from Franciscan metaclastic strata â¼100 km to the east in the Diablo RangeâSan Francisco Bay area, San Joaquin Great Valley Group turbidites, Upper Cretaceous Nacimiento block Franciscan strata, and Upper\n\nCoordinated U-Pb geochronology, trace element, Ti-in-zircon thermometry and microstructural analysis of Apollo zircons\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCrow, Carolyn A.; McKeegan, Kevin D.; Moser, Desmond E.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWe present the results of a coordinated SIMS U-Pb, trace element, Ti-in-zircon thermometry, and microstructural study of 155 lunar zircons separated from Apollo 14, 15, and 17 breccia and soil samples that help resolve discrepancies between the zircon data, the lunar whole rock history and lunar magma ocean crystallization models. The majority of lunar grains are detrital fragments, some nearly 1 mm in length, of large parent crystals suggesting that they crystallized in highly enriched KREEP magmas. The zircon age distributions for all three landing sites exhibit an abundance of ages at â¼4.33 Ga, however they differ in that only Apollo 14 samples have a population of zircons with ages between 4.1 and 3.9 Ga. These younger grains comprise only 10% of all dated lunar zircons and are usually small and highly shocked making them more susceptible to Pb-loss. These observations suggest that the majority of zircons crystallized before 4.1 Ga and that KREEP magmatism had predominantly ceased by this time. We also observed that trace element analyses are easily affected by contributions from inclusions (typically injected impact melt) within SIMS analyses spots. After filtering for these effects, rare-earth element (REE) abundances of pristine zircon are consistent with one pattern characterized by a negative Eu anomaly and no positive Ce anomaly, implying that the zircons formed in a reducing environment. This inference is consistent with crystallization temperatures based on measured Ti concentrations and new estimates of oxide activities which imply temperatures ranging between 958 Â± 57 and 1321 Â± 100 Â°C, suggesting that zircon parent magmas were anhydrous. Together, the lunar zircon ages and trace elements are consistent with a â©½300 My duration of KREEP magmatism under anhydrous, reducing conditions. We also report two granular texture zircons that contain baddeleyite cores, which both yield 207Pb-206Pb ages of 4.33 Ga. These grains are our best constraints on\n\nProvenance of Modern Soils and Limestone and Chert Bedrock of Middle Tennessee Assessed Using Detrital Zircon U-Pb Geochronology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAyers, J. C.; Katsiaficas, N. J.; Wang, X.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nRelatively thick soils mantle limestone bedrock throughout much of middle TN. Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology was used to test two hypotheses: 1) That soil formed by accumulation of insoluble residue during chemical weathering of \"dirty\" limestone bedrock. 2) That an exotic component, perhaps wind-blown loess, was deposited and weathered to form soil. Samples of soil and underlying bedrock were collected from flat surfaces at the tops of cliffs. At Site 1 the Mississippian cherty limestone of the Fort Payne Formation was collected along with the B1 and B2 horizons of the overlying ultisol. At Site 2 a composite sample of A and B horizons of an alfisol and a sample of the underlying Ordovician limestone of the Hermitage Formation were collected. Zircon was recovered from soil and limestone samples, imaged using cathodoluminescence, and analyzed for trace elements and U-Pb isotopes using a 193 nm laser and quadrupole ICP-MS. Discordant analyses were discarded and 206Pb/238U ages are reported. Trace element concentrations and ratios in zircon seem to not be useful as provenance indicators. However, comparison of U-Pb age spectra showed that soils at both sites predominantly formed by weathering of limestone, with a small exotic component. The Hermitage has significant age peaks at ~1330, 1043, 955 and 439 Ma, and its overlying soil has age peaks at 1410, 1235, 1036 and 442 Ma. The age spectra are significantly different (Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability P = 0.01 < 0.05 significance). The Fort Payne has age peaks at ~1253, 967 and 417 Ma, while the B1 has age peaks at 1440, 1182, 1012 and 450 Ma (K-S P = 0.051) and the B2 at 1240, 941, 362, 81 and 33 Ma (K-S P = 0.073). The young ages in B2 require an exotic component that may account for ~25% of the measured ages. The source of the exotic material has not yet been identified, but its zircon age spectrum does not match previously published age spectra for the regional Pleistocene Peoria loess.

F.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFaraday cups equipped with high gain amplifiers provide a means to measure small ion beams in static mode without the limited linear range of ion counting systems. We tested the application of newly available 1013 Ohm resistors to ID-TIMS zircon U-Pb geochronology using a range of natural and synthetic reference materials. The TritonPlus-RPQ at the Institute of Geochemistry and Petrology, ETH Zurich, is equipped with five new 1013 Ohm resistors and one MasCom secondary electron multiplier, allowing to measure the 202-204-205-206-207-208Pb masses in static mode. U is measured subsequently as U-oxide (265-267-270UO2) during a second step, also in static Faraday mode. The gain calibration of the 1013 Ohm resistors was performed using the procedure of Trinquier (2014), with 144Nd-146Nd being measured using 1011 Ohm resistor and 142-143-145-148-150Nd being measured using 1013 Ohm resitors (Trinquier, 2014; Koornneef et al., 2014). Standard deviations of the noise in all five new 1013 Ohm resistors are lower than 5.0 x 10-6 over a 6 month period, with no shift occurring over this time interval. This new detector set-up was tested by analyzing natural zircon standard materials and synthetic U/Pb solutions (www.earthime.org), ranging in age from ~2 Ma to ~600 Ma. All natural zircon standards were chemically abraded (Mattinson, 2005) and all samples were spiked with the ET2535 tracer solution. U-Pb dates obtained using the static measurement routine are compared to measurements employing dynamic peak jumping routines on the MasCom multiplier. This study illustrates the benefits and current limitations of using high gain amplifiers to measure small ion beams for zircon U-Pb geochronology compared to conventional dynamic ion counting techniques.

Precise U-Pb zircon dates for the Virgilina sequence, the oldest exposed part, constrain the timing of the earliest known stage of magmatism in the terrane and of the Virgilina orogeny. A flow-banded rhyolite sampled from a metavolcanic sequence near Chapel Hill, North Carolina, yielded a U-Pb zircon date of 632.9 +2.6/-1.9 Ma. A granitic unit of the Chapel Hill pluton, which intrudes the metavolcanic sequence, yielded a nearly identical U-Pb zircon date of 633 +2/-1.5 Ma, interpreted as its crystallization age. A felsic gneiss and a dacitic tuff from the Hyco Formation yielded U-Pb zircon dates of 619.9 +4.5/-3 Ma and 615.7 +3.7/-1.9 Ma, respectively. Diorite and granite of the Flat River complex have indistinguishable U-Pb upper-intercept dates of 613.9 +1.6/-1.5 Ma and 613.4 +2.8/-2 Ma. The Osmond biotite-granite gneiss, which intruded the Hyco Formation before the Virgilina orogeny, crystallized at 612.4 +5.2/-1.7 Ma. Granite of the Roxboro pluton, an intrusion that postdated the Virgilina orogeny, yielded a U-Pb upper"
