(“SCREENDOLLARS”, “we”, “us” and “our”) operates websites (each a “Site”) and services made available through the Sites (collectively, the Site and such services, are referred to as the “Services”). Certain features of the Services may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted in the Services in connection with such features. All such additional terms, guidelines, and rules are incorporated by reference into this Agreement.\n\nThis Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the Services whether you are simply a “Visitor” (which means you are just browsing the Services), or an “Authorized User”, which means you have registered to use them. Collectively, Visitors and Authorized Users are referred to as “Users” or individually as a “User” or “you”. By accessing or using the Services, clicking on the “I accept” button you are accepting this Agreement (on behalf of yourself or the entity that you represent) and you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement (on behalf of yourself or the entity that you represent). You may not access or use the Services or accept the Agreement if you are not at least 18 years old. If you do not agree with all of the provisions of this Agreement, do not access and/or use the Services.\n\nThese terms require the use of arbitration to resolve disputes and limit the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute as set forth in section 8.\n\n01 – Registration\n\nRegistering Your Account.

Depending on the SNS Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such SNS Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your SNS Accounts may be available on and through your Account for the Services. Please note that if an SNS Account or associated service becomes unavailable or our access to such SNS Account is terminated by a Third-Party Service Provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Services. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Account and your SNS Accounts at any time by [accessing the “Settings” section of the Services]. YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR SNS ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND WE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO US BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH SNS ACCOUNTS.\n\nRegistration Data.
