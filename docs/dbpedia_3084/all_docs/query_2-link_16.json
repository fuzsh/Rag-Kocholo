        "text": "Rivkin has transformed the Motion Picture Association since he became CEO and Chairman. We operate in almost 20 countries, ensuring our members can produce and distribute their content in every major market, and protecting that content by combatting digital piracy across global jurisdictions.\n\nAmerican parents overwhelmingly believe the Motion Picture Association’s film ratings are accurate and that they help them make better movie choices for their families, according to a new report released by our Classification and Rating Administration, which administers the rating system.\n\nVersion 4.0 of the California Film and Television Tax Credit program — which Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law — will build on the program's success by creating new commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion and establishing a pilot program on production safety, among other provisions.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association hosted Republic of Korea (ROK) President Yoon Suk-yeol at our global headquarters, marking the first time a Korean president has formally met with the American entertainment industry. The event brought together some of the most important and culturally influential content creators from the United States and the ROK.\n\nThe Trusted Partner Network (TPN) — the leading global film and television content security initiative, which is fully owned by the MPA — is launching its enhanced program with a new membership model, application and cloud content security assessments, and the TPN+ platform.\n\nWith this expansion and the launch of the new TPN+ platform, TPN is bolstering its program to keep pace with rapid change and evolution throughout the media and entertainment industry."
