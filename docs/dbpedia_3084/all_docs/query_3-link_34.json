        "text": "Album artwork\n\nStressed Out is a song by Twenty One Pilots. It is the second track on their fourth studio album, Blurryface. Stressed Out is the most well-known song by the music duo, topping many American charts.\n\nIt served as the third single from the album, released on April 28, 2015. The video was released the day before on Fueled by Ramen's YouTube channel.\n\nThe song was nominated for Record of the Year at the 2017 GRAMMY Awards.\n\nBackground[]\n\n\"Stressed Out\" discusses Joseph's desire to return to his childhood years, where things were less complicated. As an adult, he's stressed out, and is constantly forced to make decisions regarding finances, jobs, and growing up.\n\nChart performance[]\n\nIn the United States, \"Stressed Out\" climbed 13–9 for the chart dated January 16, 2016, becoming the group's first top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. The track topped Billboard's Hot Rock Songs chart for a second week, led the Alternative Songs Airplay chart for a ninth week, also crossing over to mainstream audiences, rising 14–13 on the Mainstream Top 40 and bulleting at number 20 on Adult Top 40.\n\nFor the chart issue dated January 30, 2016, the song ascended 5–4 on the Hot 100. The single entered the top 10 on both Radio Songs and Streaming Songs. A commissioned house remix by Dave Winnel helped the single reach number nine on Dance/Mix Show Airplay in its February 13, 2016 issue.\n\nThe song reached number 2 in its 21st week on the Hot 100, behind \"Love Yourself\" by Justin Bieber. The single, which led Billboard's Hot Rock Songs chart for an eighth week, is the first title that has also appeared on Hot Rock Songs to rank in the Hot 100's top two in more than a year, since Hozier's \"Take Me to Church\" spent its third and final week at its number 2 peak on the January 3, 2015, Hot 100.\n\n\"Stressed Out\" is the first former Alternative Songs number one to top Mainstream Top 40 in more than two-and-a-half-years, since Lorde's \"Royals\" in 2013. It was the first by a duo or group to do so in nearly four years, since Fun's \"We Are Young\" (featuring Janelle Monáe) in 2012.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Stressed Out\" became the duo's first single to chart on the UK Singles Chart, debuting at number eighty six on in February 2016, rising to number thirty four in the third week before entering the top 20 at number nineteen in March 2016 and peaking at number twelve in April 2016.\n\nLive performances[]\n\nTwenty One Pilots performed \"Stressed Out\" on Late Night with Seth Meyers on September 14, 2015. The song was part of their setlist at Lollapalooza 2015. Twenty One Pilots performed \"Stressed Out\" on their 2016 Emotional Roadshow World Tour in Ohio, Tyler Joseph, the lead singer of the band changed the lyrics of the first verse, however. In the changed lyrics, he talked about how fans of the band thought the song was overplayed, and the success of the song.\n\nTrack listing[]\n\nNo. Track Writers Length 1.
