        "text": "These are some of the longest movies ever made in the English language.\n\nThere are, of course, movies shot in other languages all over the world that are just as long, if not longer, than some of the movies in this list such as Béla Tarr's seven-hour episodic film Sátántangó. Recently, audiences may remember the Russian film Leviathan that kept us gripped to our seats for two hours and twenty one minutes.\n\nHere are 20 of the longest movies ever made, many of which film aficionados love watch over and over again—no matter the running time.\n\n1. Gone With the Wind\n\nRunning time: 238 min (3 hrs, 58 mins)\n\nA classic American film from 1939 produced by David O.Selznick and directed by Victor Fleming, it is based on the novel by Margaret Mitchell. Movie goers the world over loved the epic love story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) set during the American Civil.\n\nBack in 1939, the film swept the board at the Oscars and it soon become one of the most famous movies of all time. However, this film classic has a complicated legacy and has long been criticised for its wrong, racist depictions and the way it portrays slavery.\n\n2. Once Upon a Time in America\n\nRunning time: 229 min (3 hrs, 49 mins)\n\nSergio Leone's 1984 gangster epic tells the complex story of a small group of New York's Lower East side Jewish gangsters spanning over 40 years.\n\nThe original version was almost four-and-a-half-hour (269-minute) long, but it was cut for European audiences to 229 minutes.\n\n3. Lawrence of Arabia\n\nRunning time: 216 min (3 hrs, 36 mins)\n\nDirected by David Lean, the 1962 film is a much loved classic over three hours long. A British take on key developments in the Middle East at the beginning of the 20th century, particularly in regards to geopolitics and the development of the oil industry and its pivotal contribution to British society.\n\n4. Ben Hur\n\nRunning time: 212 min (3 hrs, 32 mins)\n\nDirected by William Wyler, this 1959 film stars Charlton Heston as a Jewish prince betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend. He eventually regains his freedom and comes back for revenge.\n\n5. Cleopatra\n\nRunning time: 248 minutes (4 hrs, 8 mins)\n\nJoseph L Mankiewicz's four-hour Cleopatra (1963) received mixed reviews but there is no question that Cleopatra is quite the filmmaking extravaganza with spectacular scenes such as the famous queen's entrance into Rome.\n\nElizabeth Taylor is Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt, who seduces two Roman rulers: Emperor Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) and his general Mark Antony (Richard Burton). Their passionate romance could decide the fate of the throne.\n\n6. The Irishman\n\nRunning time: 209 minutes (3 hrs, 29 mins)\n\nThe 2019 Martin Scorsese's film is based on Charles Brandt's novel I Heard You Paint Houses.\n\nThe epic saga is 209 minutes long but audiences love to follow the life and times of former labour union official and hitman Frank Sheeran in post-war America.\n\n7. Apocalypse Now\n\nRunning time: 202 min (3 hrs, 22 mins)\n\nInspired by the Joseph Conrad's 1899 novel Heart of Darkness, the movie is not only over 3 hours long but it took Francis Ford Coppola a very long time to finish it due to a series of problems while filming.\n\nCaptain Willard (Martin Sheen)is a U.S. Army officer serving in Vietnam tasked with a mission to assassinate a renegade Special Forces Colonel (Marlon Brando), who sees himself as a god and is accused of murder.
