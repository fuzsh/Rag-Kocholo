Now they are cutting back.\n\nGood afternoon from Los Angeles, where I’ve returned after a few weeks on the road. The biggest cultural story in Europe was not the writers strike or the Trump town hall but a soccer star (Vinicius Jr.) who has been subject to racist taunts all season.\n\nThere is a long history of racism in European soccer, and this story blew up in part because Vini plays for one of the world’s premiere clubs, Real Madrid. It didn’t help that the head of the Spanish soccer league criticized Vini."
