        "text": "The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index reached the highest reading of the year in June at 91.5, a one-point increase from last month. The last time the index was higher was in December of 2023 when it reached 91.9. Even so, this marks the 30th month below the historical average of 98. Inflation is still the top small business issue, with 21% of owners reporting it as their single most important problem in operating their business, down one point from May.\n\n“Main Street remains pessimistic about the economy for the balance of the year,” said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. “Increasing compensation costs has led to higher prices all around. Meanwhile, no relief from inflation is in sight for small business owners as they prepare for the uncertain months ahead.”\n\nKey findings include:\n\nSeasonally adjusted, a net 22% plan to raise compensation in the next three months, up four points from May.\n\nA net negative 2% (seasonally adjusted) of owners viewed current inventory stocks as “too low” in June, up six points from May’s lowest reading since October 1981.\n\nA net negative 2% (seasonally adjusted) plan inventory investment in the coming months, up four points from May.\n\nFifty-two percent reported capital outlays in the last six months, down six points from May and the lowest reading since August 2022.\n\nFour percent of owners reported that all their borrowing needs were not satisfied, up one point from May and the highest reading since August 2022.\n\nAs reported in NFIB’s monthly jobs report, a seasonally adjusted 37% of all small business owners reported jobs openings they could not fill in their current period, down five points from May. Of the 60% of owners hiring or trying to hire in June, 85% reported few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill.\n\nFifty-two percent of owners reported capital outlays in the last six months, down six points from May and the lowest reading since August 2022. Of those making expenditures, 35% reported spending on new equipment, 22% acquired vehicles, and 14% improved or expanded facilities. Ten percent spent money on new fixtures and furniture and 5% acquired new buildings or land for expansion. Twenty-three percent (seasonally adjusted) plan capital outlays in the next six months, unchanged from May.\n\nA net negative 12% of all owners (seasonally adjusted) reported higher nominal sales in the past three months. The net percent of owners expecting higher real sales volumes was unchanged at a net negative 13% (seasonally adjusted).\n\nThe net percent of owners reporting inventory gains rose four points to a net negative 3%. Not seasonally adjusted, 17% reported increases in stocks and 16% reported reductions.\n\nA net negative 2% (seasonally adjusted) of owners viewed current inventory stocks as “too low” in June, up six points from May, which was the lowest reading since October 1981. A net negative 2% (seasonally adjusted) of owners plan inventory investment in the coming months, up four points from May.\n\nThe net percent of owners raising average selling prices rose two points from May to a net 27% seasonally adjusted. Twenty-one percent of owners reported that inflation was their single most important problem in operating their business. Unadjusted, 12% reported lower average selling prices and 41% reported higher average prices.\n\nPrice hikes were the most frequent in the construction (55% higher, 5% lower), retail (49% higher, 8% lower), wholesale (46% higher, 17% lower), finance (38% higher, 7% lower), and services (37% higher, 9% lower) sectors. Seasonally adjusted, a net 26% plan price hikes in June.\n\nSeasonally adjusted, a net 38% reported raising compensation, up one point from May. A seasonally adjusted net 22% plan to raise compensation in the next three months, up four points from May. Eleven percent of owners cited labor costs as their top business problem, up one point from May and only two points below the highest reading of 13% reached in December 2021. Nineteen percent said that labor quality was their top business problem, remaining behind inflation as the number one issue.\n\nThe frequency of reports of positive profit trends was a net negative 29% (seasonally adjusted), one point better than May, but still a very poor reading. Among owners reporting lower profits, 34% blamed weaker sales, 17% blamed the rise in the cost of materials, 12% cited labor costs, and 9% cited lower selling prices. For owners reporting higher profits, 37% credited sales volumes, 27% cited usual seasonal change, and 20% cited higher selling prices.\n\nFour percent of owners reported that all their borrowing needs were not satisfied. Twenty-four percent reported all credit needs met and 61% said they were not interested in a loan. A net 7% reported their last loan was harder to get than in previous attempts.\n\nFour percent of owners reported that financing was their top business problem in June, down two points from May.\n\nThe NFIB Research Center has collected Small Business Economic Trends data with quarterly surveys since the fourth quarter of 1973 and monthly surveys since 1986. Survey respondents are randomly drawn from NFIB’s membership. The report is released on the second Tuesday of each month. This survey was conducted in June 2024.\n\nLABOR MARKETS\n\nThirty-seven percent (seasonally adjusted) of all owners reported job openings they could not fill in the current period, down 5 points from May. Thirty-one percent have openings for skilled workers (down 6 points) and 16 percent have openings for unskilled labor (up 2 points). The difficulty in filling open positions is particularly acute in the construction, transportation, and retail sectors. Job openings in construction were down 3 points from last month and over half of the firms (51 percent) have a job opening they can’t fill. Openings were the lowest in the agriculture and finance sectors. Owners’ plans to hire were unchanged in May at a seasonally adjusted net 15 percent. Overall, 60 percent reported hiring or trying to hire in June, unchanged from May. Fifty-one percent (85 percent of those hiring or trying to hire) of owners reported few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill (unchanged). Thirty-one percent of owners reported few qualified applicants for their open positions (up 2 points) and 20 percent reported none (down 2 points). Reports of labor quality as the single most important problem for business owners fell 1 point to 19 percent. Labor cost reported as the single most important problem for business owners rose 1 point to 11 percent, only 2 points below the highest reading of 13 percent reached in December 2021.\n\nCAPITAL SPENDING\n\nFifty-two percent reported capital outlays in the last six months, down 6 points from May and the lowest reading since August 2022. A recovery in investment is needed to support stronger productivity, but this is unlikely to occur while interest rates remain high, and more owners anticipate slower sales. Long term, the worker shortage has given firms an incentive to invest in labor saving technology. But, overall, capital spending is sluggish and not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. Of those making expenditures, 35 percent reported spending on new equipment (down 5 points), 22 percent acquired vehicles (down 3 points), and 14 percent improved or expanded facilities (down 2 points). Ten percent spent money on new fixtures and furniture (down 1 point) and 5 percent acquired new buildings or land for expansion (down 1 point). Twenty-three percent (seasonally adjusted) plan capital outlays in the next six months, unchanged from May.\n\nINFLATION\n\nThe net percent of owners raising average selling prices rose 2 points from May to a net 27 percent seasonally adjusted. Twenty-one percent of owners reported that inflation was their single most important problem in operating their business (higher input and labor costs), down 1 point from May. Unadjusted, 12 percent (unchanged) reported lower average selling prices and 41 percent (up 1 point) reported higher average prices. Price hikes were most frequent in the construction (55 percent higher, 5 percent lower), retail (49 percent higher, 8 percent lower), wholesale (46 percent higher, 17 percent lower), finance (38 percent higher, 7 percent lower), and services (37 percent higher, 9 percent lower) sectors. Seasonally adjusted, a net 26 percent plan price hikes in June (down 2 points).\n\nCREDIT MARKETS\n\nFour percent of owners reported that all their borrowing needs were not satisfied, up 1 point from May and the highest reading since August 2022. Twenty-four percent reported all credit needs met (down 5 points) and 61 percent said they were not interested in a loan (up 3 points). A net 7 percent reported their last loan was harder to get than in previous attempts (up 1 point). Four percent reported that financing was their top business problem in June (down 2 points). A net 15 percent of owners reported paying a higher rate on their most recent loan, down 5 points from May. This was the lowest reading since May 2022. The average rate paid on short maturity loans was 9.5 percent, up half of a point from last month. Twenty-eight percent of all owners reported borrowing on a regular basis, down 3 points from May.\n\nCOMPENSATION AND EARNINGS\n\nSeasonally adjusted, a net 38 percent reported raising compensation, up 1 point from May. A seasonally adjusted net 22 percent plan to raise compensation in the next three months, up 4 points from May. Eleven percent cited labor costs as their top business problem, up 1 point from May and only 2 points below the highest reading of 13 percent reached in December 2021. Nineteen percent said that labor quality was their top business problem (down 1 point), remaining behind inflation as the number one issue. The frequency of reports of positive profit trends was a net negative 29 percent (seasonally adjusted), 1 point better than May. Among owners reporting lower profits, 34 percent blamed weaker sales, 17 percent blamed the rise in the cost of materials, 12 percent cited labor costs, and 9 percent cited lower selling prices. For owners reporting higher profits, 37 percent credited sales volumes, 27 percent cited usual seasonal change, and 20 percent cited higher selling prices.\n\nSALES AND INVENTORIES\n\nA net negative 12 percent of all owners (seasonally adjusted) reported higher nominal sales in the past three months, up 2 points from May, but clearly recession-level readings. The net percent of owners expecting higher real sales volumes was unchanged at a net negative 13 percent (seasonally adjusted), a recession level reading. The net percent of owners reporting inventory gains rose 4 points to a net negative 3 percent. Not seasonally adjusted, 17 percent reported increases in stocks (up 6 points) and 16 percent reported reductions (up 1 point). A net negative 2 percent (seasonally adjusted) of owners viewed current inventory stocks as “too low” in June, up 6 points. A net negative 2 percent (seasonally adjusted) of owners plan inventory investment in the coming months, up 4 points from May.\n\nCOMMENTARY\n\nThe next six months will be loaded with uncertainty, the U.S. election, elections of U.S. allies, several wars that involve the U.S., and an economy that is not growing much, to name a few of the big ones. Inflation is still above the Federal Reserve’s target (which many feel is too high, should it be 2%?) and interest rates remain historically high. Housing has become unaffordable for many young people and builders can’t build enough new homes to ease the market, constrained in part by a short supply in construction workers. Housing costs (rent or own) have been a major contributor to inflation.\n\nThe Supreme Court pushed back against the crush of regulations currently being promulgated, reducing regulatory costs for small businesses going forward. Tax uncertainty is substantial, with one presidential candidate promising to end the tax cuts passed by the prior administration and to raise tax rates on corporations and the wealthy (whatever that means) who allegedly don’t pay their “fair share” (whatever that is). The interest cost of servicing our current government debt is larger than the defense budget or Social Security payments, crowding out important domestic spending. The government is expected to run substantial deficits, adding to interest costs in the future, as deficits require more federal borrowing.\n\nMain Street remains pessimistic about the economy for the balance of the year. The Optimism Index stayed in a tight range around 90 (98 is the 50-year average). Only 8 percent expect business conditions to improve by year-end, basically the same as in prior months. Inflation remained the top business problem. The percent of firms raising average selling prices remained well above 40%, higher than earlier in the year, not a good sign for lowering inflation. Nearly 40% raised compensation, a major cost for most firms and a driver of higher prices. This will keep inflation and interest rates “higher for longer” than hoped for. Equity markets have remained exuberant, creating a lot of paper wealth for some consumers. But most don’t own a lot of stock. Owning a house has also been a good investment on paper, but not very liquid for owners to utilize. Meantime, record high mortgage rates have added to the housing affordability problem. Overall, uncertainty will oversee developments over the next six months and small business owners will play the Fed’s waiting game, watching the “incoming data,” especially the elections later this year."
