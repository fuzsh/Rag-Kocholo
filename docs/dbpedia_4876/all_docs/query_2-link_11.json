The Crips and Bloods are two of South Los Angeles' most notorious African-American gangs. While many outsiders simply cannot understand the decades-long cycle of despair and destruction that has come to define their daily lives, the individuals who comprise each gang are not simply mindless, gun-toting thugs, but real people with real families who have become caught up in a struggle from which the only escape is often death.\n\n\"The Garden\" (Oscilloscope Laboratories) - An Academy Award� Nominated film, \"The Garden\" shows how the politics of power and greed (backroom deals, land developing, green politics, money) tragically intersect with working class families who rely on this communal garden for their livelihood.

The stakes rise for Jack and Ripley when Ripley s goddaughter (Mitchell) is kidnapped by the KGB. Staying one step ahead of the NYPD, the FBI, the diamond merchants and the vicious Russian KGB crime boss determined to have the priceless eggs for himself, Jack and Ripley must find a way to pull off the heist and make it out alive.\n\nAbout First Look Studios\n\nFirst Look Studios, a leading independent supplier in the entertainment marketplace, acquires, markets and distributes feature films, television series and specialty programming.
