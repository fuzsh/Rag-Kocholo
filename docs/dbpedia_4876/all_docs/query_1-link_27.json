        "text": "Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis are finally back together on set as Disney has released a first behind-the-scenes look at the production of “Freaky Friday 2,” which is officially now filming. Lohan and Curtis are reprising their roles of Anna and Tess Coleman, respectively.\n\nDisney has not yet announced plot details for the follow-up to the 2003 comedy favorite, but the studio has now confirmed “Freaky Friday 2” will open in movie theaters in 2025. Rumors the sequel might be exclusively for Disney+ are not true. The original film grossed $160 million in theaters worldwide.\n\nJoining Lohan and Curtis in the sequel are returning cast members Mark Harmon, Chad Michael Murray, Christina Vidal Mitchell, Haley Hudson, Lucille Soong, Stephen Tobolowsky and Rosalind Chao. New cast members include Julia Butters, Manny Jacinto, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan and Sophia Hammons.\n\nWhile Lohan and Curtis teased “Freaky Friday 2” during much of 2023, it wasn’t until this March that Disney officially announced the sequel was moving forward. Nisha Ganatra is directing the movie. She most recently helmed episodes of Hulu’s “Welcome to Chippendales” and directed the feature films “The High Note,” starring Dakota Johnson and Tracee Ellis Ross, and “Late Night,” starring Mindy Kaling and Emma Thompson.\n\nCurtis first drummed up interest in a second “Freaky Friday” movie when she told “The View” in October 2022 that she had personally “written to Disney” about wanting to making the sequel. The original film’s producer Andrew Gunn is back for the follow-up alongside former Disney exec Kristin Burr."
