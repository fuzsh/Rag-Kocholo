        "text": "Lionsgate Revenue was $834.7 Million\n\nNet Loss Attributable to Lionsgate Shareholders was $59.4 Million or $0.25 Diluted Net Loss Per Share\n\nAdjusted Net Income Attributable to Lionsgate Shareholders was $20.9 Million or $0.09 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\n\nLionsgate Operating Income was $18.8 Million\n\nLionsgate Adjusted OIBDA was $104.5 Million\n\nNorth American Media Networks and Motion Picture Segment Profits Increased Year-Over-Year by 54% and 24%, Respectively\n\nSANTA MONICA, Calif., and VANCOUVER, BC, Aug. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LGF.A, LGF.B) (\"Lionsgate\") and Lionsgate Studios Corp. (Nasdaq: LION) (\"Lionsgate Studios\") today reported first quarter results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This press release includes consolidated financial results for parent company Lionsgate as well as operating results for Lionsgate Studios (also referred to as the \"Studio Business\"), comprised of its Motion Picture and Television Production segments.\n\nLionsgate reported first quarter revenue of $834.7 million, operating income of $18.8 million, and net loss attributable to Lionsgate shareholders of $59.4 million or $0.25 diluted net loss per share on 235.6 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Adjusted net income attributable to Lionsgate shareholders in the quarter was $20.9 million or $0.09 adjusted diluted net earnings per share on 240.4 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Adjusted OIBDA was $104.5 million in the quarter.\n\n\"We're pleased to report a solid quarter despite unprecedented industry disruption and the aftereffects of the strikes,\" said Lionsgate and Lionsgate Studios CEO Jon Feltheimer. \"Our Motion Picture Group, STARZ and our library performed well, though financial results in our television segment reflected a heavily backloaded year. Importantly, we generated great momentum during and after the quarter by taking a number of steps toward full separation by calendar year-end, subject to the timing of normal regulatory approvals.\"\n\nTrailing 12-month library revenue was $882 million.\n\nFirst Quarter Results\n\nThe Studio Business, comprised of the Motion Picture and Television Production segments, reported revenue of $588.4 million, a decrease of 5.9% from the prior year quarter. Studio Adjusted OIBDA of $58.3 million decreased by 5.5% from the prior year quarter.\n\nMotion Picture segment revenue decreased by 15% to $347.3 million and segment profit increased by 24% to $86.1 million. The year-over-year revenue decline was due to the difficult comparison with the prior year's first quarter, which included carryover theatrical revenue from John Wick: Chapter Four. Motion Picture performance was driven by strong theatrical results from The Strangers: Chapter One, robust home entertainment performances from several theatrical titles, and lower P&A spend and content amortization.\n\nTelevision Production segment revenue increased 10% to $241.1 million while segment profit decreased 53% to $10.7 million. Revenue growth was driven by contributions from eOne, while segment profit growth was impacted by lingering impacts of the strike on the timing of deliveries in a heavily backloaded year.\n\nMedia Networks North American revenue grew 1% to $345.3 million and segment profit grew 54% to $58.5 million. Revenue growth was driven by the June 2023 price increase and OTT subscriber growth, partially offset by linear declines. Segment profit growth was driven primarily by lower content amortization. North American OTT subscribers increased 5.5% to 13.2 million compared to the prior year quarter, while on a sequential basis, North American OTT subscribers decreased by 180K. Overall North American subscribers decreased by 500K sequentially. Earlier this week, STARZ notified its U.S. customers of a $1.00 rate increase to the service's monthly cost.\n\nLionsgate and Lionsgate Studios senior management will hold their analyst and investor conference call to discuss fiscal 2025 first quarter results today, August 8th, at 6:00 PM ET/3:00 PM PT. The consolidated financial results of Lionsgate and the operating results of Lionsgate Studios' segments will be discussed on a single call.

Alternatively, interested parties can join the webcast directly via the following link. A full replay will be available this evening by clicking the same link.\n\nAbout Lionsgate\n\nLionsgate (NYSE: LGF.A, LGF.B) encompasses world-class motion picture and television studio operations and the STARZ premium global subscription platform, bringing a unique and varied portfolio of entertainment to consumers around the world.

Trending schedules containing certain financial information will also be available.\n\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\n\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nThe Company's reportable segments have been determined based on the distinct nature of their operations, the Company's internal management structure, and the financial information that is evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker.\n\nThe Company has three reportable business segments: (1) Motion Picture, (2) Television Production and (3) Media Networks. We refer to our Motion Picture and Television Production segments collectively as our Studio Business.\n\nStudio Business:\n\nMotion Picture. Motion Picture consists of the development and production of feature films, acquisition of North American and worldwide distribution rights, North American theatrical, home entertainment and television distribution of feature films produced and acquired, and worldwide licensing of distribution rights to feature films produced and acquired.\n\nTelevision Production. Television Production consists of the development, production and worldwide distribution of television productions including television series, television movies and mini-series, and non-fiction programming. Television Production includes the licensing of Starz original series productions to Starz Networks and LIONSGATE+, and the ancillary market distribution of Starz original productions and licensed product. Additionally, the Television Production segment includes the results of operations of 3 Arts Entertainment.\n\nMedia Networks Business:\n\nMedia Networks. Media Networks consists of the following product lines (i) Starz Networks, which includes the domestic distribution of STARZ branded premium subscription video services through over-the-top (\"OTT\") platforms, on a direct-to-consumer basis through the Starz App, and through U.S. and Canada multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") including cable operators, satellite television providers and telecommunication companies (collectively, \"Distributors\"); and (ii) Other, which represents revenues primarily from the OTT distribution of the Company's STARZ branded premium subscription video services outside of the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company's reportable segments enter into transactions with one another. The most common types of intersegment transactions include licensing motion pictures or television programming (including Starz original productions) from the Motion Picture and Television Production segments to the Media Networks segment. While intersegment transactions are treated like third-party transactions to determine segment performance, the revenues (and corresponding expenses, assets, or liabilities recognized by the segment that is the counterparty to the transaction) are eliminated in consolidation and, therefore, do not affect consolidated results.\n\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\n\nSEGMENT INFORMATION (Continued)\n\nSegment information is presented in the tables below. The Motion Picture and Television Production segments include the results of operations of eOne from the acquisition date of December 27, 2023.\n\nThe Company's primary measure of segment performance is segment profit. Segment profit is defined as segment revenues, less segment direct operating and segment distribution and marketing expense, less segment general and administration expenses. Total segment profit represents the sum of segment profit for our individual segments, net of eliminations for intersegment transactions. Segment profit and total segment profit excludes, when applicable, corporate general and administrative expense, restructuring and other costs, share-based compensation, certain programming and content charges as a result of changes in management and/or programming and content strategy, certain charges related to the COVID-19 global pandemic, and purchase accounting and related adjustments. Segment profit is a GAAP financial measure.\n\nWe also present above our total segment profit for all of our segments and the sum of our Motion Picture and Television Production segment profit as our \"Studio Business\" segment profit. Total segment profit and Studio Business segment profit, when presented outside of the segment information and reconciliations included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. We use this non-GAAP measure, among other measures, to evaluate the aggregate operating performance of our business.\n\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\n\nSEGMENT INFORMATION (Continued)\n\nThe following table sets forth segment information by product line for the Media Networks segment for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\n\nSEGMENT INFORMATION (Continued)\n\nSubscriber Data. The number of period-end service subscribers is a key metric which management uses to evaluate a non-ad supported subscription video service. We believe this key metric provides useful information to investors as a growing or decreasing subscriber base is a key indicator of the health of the overall business. Service subscribers may impact revenue differently depending on specific distribution agreements we have with our distributors which may include fixed fees, rates per basic video household or a rate per STARZ subscriber. The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, subscriptions to our Media Networks and STARZPLAY Arabia services, excluding subscribers in territories exited or to be exited:\n\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\n\nTO ADJUSTED OIBDA AND TOTAL SEGMENT PROFIT\n\nThe following table reconciles the GAAP measure, operating income (loss) to the non-GAAP measures, Adjusted OIBDA and Total Segment Profit:\n\n________________\n\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS FOR NET BORROWINGS UNDER AND REPAYMENT OF PRODUCTION AND RELATED LOANS\n\nThe following tables reconcile the non-GAAP adjustments for net borrowings under and (repayment) of production and related loans to the changes in the related balance sheet amounts and the consolidated statement of cash flows:\n\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\n\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThis earnings release presents the following important financial measures utilized by Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") that are not all financial measures defined by generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP.\n\nAdjusted OIBDA: Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income (loss) before adjusted depreciation and amortization (\"OIBDA\"), adjusted for adjusted share-based compensation (\"adjusted SBC\"), purchase accounting and related adjustments, restructuring and other costs, certain charges (benefits) related to the COVID-19 global pandemic, certain programming and content charges as a result of management changes and/or changes in strategy, and unusual gains or losses (such as goodwill and intangible asset impairment), when applicable.\n\nAdjusted depreciation and amortization represents depreciation and amortization as presented on our consolidated statement of operations, less the depreciation and amortization related to the amortization of purchase accounting and related adjustments associated with recent acquisitions. Accordingly, the full impact of the purchase accounting is included in the adjustment for \"purchase accounting and related adjustments\", described below.\n\nAdjusted share-based compensation represents share-based compensation excluding the impact of the acceleration of certain vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements, which are included in restructuring and other expenses, when applicable.\n\nRestructuring and other includes restructuring and severance costs, certain transaction and other costs, and certain unusual items, when applicable.\n\nCOVID-19 related charges or benefits include incremental costs associated with the pausing and restarting of productions including paying/hiring certain cast and crew, maintaining idle facilities and equipment costs, and when applicable, certain motion picture and television impairments and development charges associated with changes in performance expectations or the feasibility of completing the project resulting from circumstances associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, net of insurance recoveries, which are included in direct operating expense, when applicable. In addition, the costs include early or contractual marketing spends for film releases and events that have been canceled or delayed and will provide no economic benefit, which are included in distribution and marketing expense, when applicable.\n\nProgramming and content charges include certain charges as a result of changes in management and/or changes in programming and content strategy, which are included in direct operating expenses, when applicable.\n\nPurchase accounting and related adjustments primarily represent the amortization of non-cash fair value adjustments to certain assets acquired in recent acquisitions. These adjustments include the accretion of the noncontrolling interest discount related to Pilgrim Media Group and 3 Arts Entertainment, the non-cash charge for the amortization of the recoupable portion of the purchase price and the expense associated with the noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings related to 3 Arts Entertainment, all of which are accounted for as compensation and are included in general and administrative expense.\n\nAdjusted OIBDA is calculated similar to how the Company defines segment profit and manages and evaluates its segment operations. Segment profit also excludes corporate general and administrative expense.\n\nTotal Segment Profit and Studio Business Segment Profit and Studio Business Adjusted OIBDA: We present the sum of our Motion Picture and Television Production segment profit as our \"Studio Business\" segment profit, and we define our Studio Business Adjusted OIBDA as Studio Business segment profit less corporate general and administrative expenses. Total segment profit and Studio Business segment profit and Studio Business Adjusted OIBDA, when presented outside of the segment information and reconciliations included in our consolidated financial statements, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. We use this non-GAAP measure, among other measures, to evaluate the aggregate operating performance of our business.\n\nThe Company believes the presentation of total segment profit and Studio Business segment profit is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view total segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enables them to understand the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses before non-operating items. Total segment profit and Studio Business segment profit is considered an important measure of the Company's performance because it reflects the aggregate profit contribution from the Company's segments, both in total and for the Studio Business and represents a measure, consistent with our segment profit, that eliminates amounts that, in management's opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses, are infrequent in occurrence, and in some cases are non-cash expenses. Not all companies calculate segment profit or total segment profit in the same manner, and segment profit and total segment profit as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to differences in the methods of calculation and excluded items.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is typically defined as net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures. The Company defines Adjusted Free Cash Flow as net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus or minus the net increase or decrease in production and related loans (which includes our production tax credit facility), plus or minus certain unusual or non-recurring items, such as insurance recoveries on prior shareholder litigation, proceeds from the termination of interest rate swaps, and payments on impaired content in territories exited or to be exited.\n\nThe adjustment for the production and related loans, exclusive of our production tax credit facility, is made because the GAAP based cash flows from operations reflects a non-cash reduction of cash flows for the cost of films and television programs prior to the time the Company pays for the film or television program through the payment of the associated production or related loan which occurs at or near completion of the production, or in some cases, over the period revenues and cash receipts are being generated, as more fully described below.\n\nThe cost of producing films and television programs, which is reflected as a reduction of the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, is often financed through production loans. The adjustment for production and related loans is made in order to better align the timing of the cash flows associated with producing films and television programs with the timing of the repayment of the production loans, which is consistent with how management views its production cash spend and manages the Company's cash flows and working capital needs. Borrowings on production loans offset the spend on investment in films reflected in the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities and thus increase the Adjusted Free Cash Flows as compared to the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities and subsequent payments on production loans reflect the payment for the production of the film or TV program and reduce Adjusted Free Cash Flows as compared to the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities.\n\nThe adjustment for the production tax credit facility is made to better reflect the timing of the cash requirements of the production, since a portion of the amounts expended initially are later refunded through the receipt of the tax credit, as more fully described below. The production tax credit facility reduces the timing difference between the payments for production cost and the receipt of the tax credit and thus reflects the cash cost of the film or television program at or near the time the film or television program is produced and completed.\n\nPart of the cost of a film or television program is effectively funded through obtaining government incentives, however, the incentives are not received until a future period which could be a few years after the completion of the film. The tax credit facility reflects borrowings collateralized by the tax credits to be received in the future and thus by including these borrowings in Adjusted Free Cash Flow it has the effect of better aligning the receipt of the tax credits with the timing of the production and completion of the film and television programs, which is consistent with how management views its production cash spend and manages the Company's cash flows and working capital needs. Borrowings under the tax credit facility reduce the cash spend reflected in the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities and thus increase adjusted free cash flows and payments on the tax credit facility offset the tax credit receivable collection reflected in the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities and reduce adjusted free cash flows as compared to the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities.\n\nThe Company believes that it is more meaningful to reflect the impact of the payment for these films and television programs when the payments are made under the production loans and the receipt of the tax credit when the film is being produced in its Adjusted Free Cash Flow.\n\nThe adjustment for the payments on impaired content represents cash payments made on impaired content in territories exited or to be exited under the LIONSGATE+ international restructuring. The adjustment is made because these cash payments relate to content in territories the Company has exited or is exiting, and therefore the cash payments are not reflective of the ongoing operations of the Company.\n\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders: Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. shareholders is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. shareholders, adjusted for share-based compensation, purchase accounting and related adjustments, restructuring and other items, insurance recoveries on prior shareholder litigation and net gains or losses on investments and other, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, certain programming and content charges, COVID-19 related charges (benefit), and unusual gains or losses (such as goodwill and intangible asset impairment), when applicable, as described in the Adjusted OIBDA definition, net of the tax effect of the adjustments at the applicable effective tax rate for each adjustment and net of the impact of the adjustments on noncontrolling interest.\n\nAdjusted Basic and Diluted EPS: Adjusted basic earnings (loss) per share is defined as adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. shareholders divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but is adjusted for the effects of securities that are diluted based on the level of adjusted net income (loss), similar to GAAP.\n\nOverall: These measures are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the SEC and are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP.\n\nWe use these non-GAAP measures, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our business. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and cash flows before non-operating items. Adjusted OIBDA is considered an important measure of the Company's performance because this measure eliminates amounts that, in management's opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses, are infrequent in occurrence, and in some cases are non-cash expenses. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is considered an important measure of the Company's liquidity because it provides information about the ability of the Company to reduce net corporate debt, make strategic investments, dividends and share repurchases. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders and Adjusted EPS are considered important measures of the Company's business operations as, similar to Adjusted OIBDA, these measures eliminate amounts that, in management's opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are commonly used in the entertainment industry and by financial analysts and others who follow the industry to measure operating performance. However, not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner and the measures as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to differences in the methods of calculation and excluded items.\n\nA general limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of operating income, cash flow, net income (loss), or earnings (loss) per share as determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the adjusted metrics utilized to their corresponding GAAP metrics are provided below.\n\nLIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP.\n\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nLionsgate Studios' reportable segments have been determined based on the distinct nature of their operations, the Company's internal management structure, and the financial information that is evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker.\n\nLionsgate Studios has two reportable business segments: (1) Motion Picture, (2) Television Production.\n\nMotion Picture. Motion Picture consists of the development and production of feature films, acquisition of North American and worldwide distribution rights, North American theatrical, home entertainment and television distribution of feature films produced and acquired, and worldwide licensing of distribution rights to feature films produced and acquired.\n\nTelevision Production. Television Production consists of the development, production and worldwide distribution of television productions including television series, television movies and mini-series, and non-fiction programming. Television Production includes the licensing of Starz original series productions to the Starz Business, and the ancillary market distribution of Starz original productions and licensed product. Additionally, the Television Production segment includes the results of operations of 3 Arts Entertainment.\n\nSegment information is presented in the tables below. The Motion Picture and Television Production segments include the results of operations of eOne from the acquisition date of December 27, 2023.\n\nThe following table reconciles corporate general and administrative expense allocated to the Studio Business to the Studio Business's total consolidated general and administration expense:\n\nLionsgate Studios' primary measure of segment performance is segment profit. Segment profit is defined as gross contribution (revenues, less direct operating and distribution and marketing expense) less segment general and administration expenses. Segment profit excludes, when applicable, corporate and allocated general and administrative expense, restructuring and other costs, share-based compensation, certain charges related to the COVID-19 global pandemic, and purchase accounting and related adjustments. The Company believes the presentation of segment profit is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by Lionsgate Studios' management and enables them to understand the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses. Segment profit is a GAAP financial measure.\n\nWe also present above our total segment profit for all of our segments. Total segment profit, when presented outside of the segment information and reconciliations included in the notes to our combined financial statements, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. We use this non-GAAP measure, among other measures, to evaluate the aggregate operating performance of our business.\n\nLIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF OPERATING INCOME\n\nTO ADJUSTED OIBDA AND TOTAL SEGMENT PROFIT\n\nThe following table reconciles the GAAP measure, operating income to the non-GAAP measures, Total Segment Profit and Adjusted OIBDA:\n\nLIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS FOR NET BORROWINGS UNDER AND REPAYMENT OF PRODUCTION AND RELATED LOANS\n\nThe following tables reconcile the non-GAAP adjustments for net borrowings under and (repayment) of production and related loans to the changes in the related balance sheet amounts and the consolidated statement of cash flows:\n\nLIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP.\n\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThis earnings release presents the following important financial measures utilized by Lionsgate Studios Corp. (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") that are not all financial measures defined by generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP.\n\nAdjusted OIBDA: Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income (loss) before adjusted depreciation and amortization (\"OIBDA\"), adjusted for adjusted share-based compensation (\"adjusted SBC\"), purchase accounting and related adjustments, restructuring and other costs, certain charges (benefits) related to the COVID-19 global pandemic, certain content charges as a result of management changes and/or changes in strategy, and unusual gains or losses (such as goodwill and intangible asset impairment), when applicable.\n\nAdjusted depreciation and amortization represents depreciation and amortization as presented on our combined statement of operations, less the depreciation and amortization related to the amortization of purchase accounting and related adjustments associated with recent acquisitions. Accordingly, the full impact of the purchase accounting is included in the adjustment for \"purchase accounting and related adjustments\", described below.\n\nAdjusted share-based compensation represents share-based compensation excluding the impact of the acceleration of certain vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements, which are included in restructuring and other expenses, when applicable.\n\nRestructuring and other includes restructuring and severance costs, certain transaction and other costs, and certain unusual items, when applicable.\n\nCOVID-19 related charges or benefits include incremental costs associated with the pausing and restarting of productions including paying/hiring certain cast and crew, maintaining idle facilities and equipment costs, and when applicable, certain motion picture and television impairments and development charges associated with changes in performance expectations or the feasibility of completing the project resulting from circumstances associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, net of insurance recoveries, which are included in direct operating expense, when applicable. In addition, the costs include early or contractual marketing spends for film releases and events that have been canceled or delayed and will provide no economic benefit, which are included in distribution and marketing expense, when applicable.\n\nContent charges include certain charges as a result of changes in management and/or changes in content strategy, which are included in direct operating expenses, when applicable.\n\nPurchase accounting and related adjustments primarily represent the amortization of non-cash fair value adjustments to certain assets acquired in recent acquisitions. These adjustments include the accretion of the noncontrolling interest discount related to Pilgrim Media Group and 3 Arts Entertainment, the non-cash charge for the amortization of the recoupable portion of the purchase price and the expense associated with the noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings related to 3 Arts Entertainment, all of which are accounted for as compensation and are included in general and administrative expense.\n\nAdjusted OIBDA is calculated similar to how the Company defines segment profit and manages and evaluates its segment operations. Adjusted OIBDA is also adjusted to reflect the corporate general and administrative expenses allocated to the Studio Business and included in the historical combined or consolidated financial statements, plus amounts that were allocated to Starz prior to the separation such that the total corporate general and administrative expenses reflect the same amounts as historically presented in the Lionsgate consolidated corporate general and administrative expenses less any allocations to Starz post the separation pursuant to the shared services and overhead sharing agreement. Segment profit includes general and administrative expenses directly related to the segment and excludes corporate general and administrative expense.\n\nTotal Segment Profit: We present the sum of our Motion Picture and Television Production segment profit as our total segment profit. Total segment profit, when presented outside of the segment information and reconciliations included in our combined financial statements, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. We use this non-GAAP measure, among other measures, to evaluate the aggregate operating performance of our business.\n\nThe Company believes the presentation of total segment profit is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view total segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enables them to understand the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses before non-operating items. Total segment profit is considered an important measure of the Company's performance because it reflects the aggregate profit contribution from the Company's segments, and represents a measure, consistent with our segment profit, that eliminates amounts that, in management's opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses, are infrequent in occurrence, and in some cases are non-cash expenses. Not all companies calculate segment profit or total segment profit in the same manner, and segment profit and total segment profit as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to differences in the methods of calculation and excluded items.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is typically defined as net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures. The Company defines Adjusted Free Cash Flow as net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus or minus the net increase or decrease in production and related loans (which includes our production tax credit facility), plus or minus certain unusual or non-recurring items, such as insurance recoveries on prior shareholder litigation, proceeds from the termination of interest rate swaps.\n\nThe adjustment for the production and related loans, exclusive of our production tax credit facility, is made because the GAAP based cash flows from operations reflects a non-cash reduction of cash flows for the cost of films and television programs prior to the time the Company pays for the film or television program through the payment of the associated production or related loan which occurs at or near completion of the production, or in some cases, over the period revenues and cash receipts are being generated, as more fully described below.\n\nThe cost of producing films and television programs, which is reflected as a reduction of the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, is often financed through production loans. The adjustment for production and related loans is made in order to better align the timing of the cash flows associated with producing films and television programs with the timing of the repayment of the production loans, which is consistent with how management views its production cash spend and manages the Company's cash flows and working capital needs. Borrowings on production loans offset the spend on investment in films reflected in the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities and thus increase the Adjusted Free Cash Flows as compared to the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities and subsequent payments on production loans reflect the payment for the production of the film or TV program and reduce Adjusted Free Cash Flows as compared to the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities.\n\nThe adjustment for the production tax credit facility is made to better reflect the timing of the cash requirements of the production, since a portion of the amounts expended initially are later refunded through the receipt of the tax credit, as more fully described below. The production tax credit facility reduces the timing difference between the payments for production cost and the receipt of the tax credit and thus reflects the cash cost of the film or television program at or near the time the film or television program is produced and completed.\n\nPart of the cost of a film or television program is effectively funded through obtaining government incentives, however, the incentives are not received until a future period which could be a few years after the completion of the film. The tax credit facility reflects borrowings collateralized by the tax credits to be received in the future and thus by including these borrowings in Adjusted Free Cash Flow it has the effect of better aligning the receipt of the tax credits with the timing of the production and completion of the film and television programs, which is consistent with how management views its production cash spend and manages the Company's cash flows and working capital needs. Borrowings under the tax credit facility reduce the cash spend reflected in the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities and thus increase adjusted free cash flows and payments on the tax credit facility offset the tax credit receivable collection reflected in the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities and reduce adjusted free cash flows as compared to the GAAP based cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities.\n\nThe Company believes that it is more meaningful to reflect the impact of the payment for these films and television programs when the payments are made under the production loans and the receipt of the tax credit when the film is being produced in its Adjusted Free Cash Flow.\n\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Lionsgate Studios Corp. Shareholders: Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Lionsgate Studios Corp. shareholders is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Lionsgate Studios Corp. shareholders, adjusted for share-based compensation, purchase accounting and related adjustments, restructuring and other items, insurance recoveries on prior shareholder litigation and net gains or losses on investments and other, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, certain content charges, COVID-19 related charges (benefit), and unusual gains or losses, when applicable, as described in the Adjusted OIBDA definition, net of the tax effect of the adjustments at the applicable effective tax rate for each adjustment and net of the impact of the adjustments on noncontrolling interest.\n\nAdjusted Basic and Diluted EPS: Adjusted basic earnings (loss) per share is defined as adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Lionsgate Studios Corp. shareholders divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but is adjusted for the effects of securities that are diluted based on the level of adjusted net income (loss), similar to GAAP.\n\nOverall: These measures are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the SEC and are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP.\n\nWe use these non-GAAP measures, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our business. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and cash flows before non-operating items. Adjusted OIBDA is considered an important measure of the Company's performance because this measure eliminates amounts that, in management's opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses, are infrequent in occurrence, and in some cases are non-cash expenses. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is considered an important measure of the Company's liquidity because it provides information about the ability of the Company to reduce net corporate debt, make strategic investments, dividends and share repurchases. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Lionsgate Studios Corp. Shareholders and Adjusted EPS are considered important measures of the Company's business operations as, similar to Adjusted OIBDA, these measures eliminate amounts that, in management's opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are commonly used in the entertainment industry and by financial analysts and others who follow the industry to measure operating performance. However, not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner and the measures as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to differences in the methods of calculation and excluded items.\n\nA general limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of operating income, cash flow, net income (loss), or earnings (loss) per share as determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the adjusted metrics utilized to their corresponding GAAP metrics are provided above.\n\nSOURCE Lionsgate; Lionsgate Studios"
