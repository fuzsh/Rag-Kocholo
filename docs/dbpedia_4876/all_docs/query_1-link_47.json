        "text": "Talk about awkward timing.\n\nThe first look at “Unstoppable,” the sports biopic that features Jennifer Lopez and is produced by Ben Affleck, came out on Thursday — while the couple reportedly is living apart and working out the details of their divorce.\n\nAmazon MGM Studios released photos of the upcoming film, which will premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September.\n\nLopez, 55, is one of the leads in the project while Affleck, 51, produced it via his and BFF Matt Damon’s production company, Artists Equity.\n\n“Unstoppable” is about the real-life story of wrestler Anthony Robles, who won the 2011 NCAA individual national championship despite being born with one leg.\n\nLopez plays Robles’ mom, Judy, while Robles is played by Jharrel Jerome.\n\nThe cast also includes Bobby Cannavale as Robles’ dad, Michael Peña and Don Cheadle.\n\nIn one of the first-look photos, shared with Vanity Fair, Lopez wraps her hand around Jerome’s neck and kisses him on his forehead.\n\nThe “Let’s Get Loud” singer posted the picture on her Instagram Story, tagging Amazon MGM Studios and producer Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas.\n\nShe didn’t mention Affleck or his production company.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair, director William Goldenberg said that Lopez being married to one of the film’s leading producers is not why she got cast.\n\nJudy need to be portrayed by “somebody who’s lived a life, and I felt like Jennifer was one of the few actresses who could play the part,” Goldenberg said. “I think that she was right for it, and it was also serendipity that he happened to be married to the person we sort of wanted all along anyway.”\n\nRobles, 36, said the “Hustlers” actress spent hours talking to his mother to prepare for the role.\n\n“She really made us feel comfortable and safe,” he shared.\n\nThis is Lopez and Affleck’s second film collaboration since they got married in 2022. Their first was Lopez’s “This Is Me … Now: A Love Story” musical film that came out in February.\n\nAffleck talked about working with his wife on “Unstoppable” last year.\n\n“What fun, what a joy to do something with her, see her be great, go to work with your wife, go to work with your best friend,” he said in an interview with CBS News.\n\n“Can’t make it look like she’s doing it as a favor to me, but actually she is,” he also said about Lopez.\n\nAfter two years of marriage, Bennifer is rumored to be getting divorced, though they haven’t officially confirmed a breakup.\n\nThe stars have been on the rocks since May, when it was reported that Affleck was staying at a separate house from Lopez.\n\nSince then, the pair have put their $60 million Beverly Hills mansion on the market, while Affleck purchased his own home in Los Angeles for $20.5 million.\n\nThe “Gigli” co-stars didn’t spend their second wedding anniversary or Lopez’s 55th birthday together last month.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Affleck and Lopez are no longer in contact as their business managers hash out the details of their divorce.\n\n“They’re moving on separately. Jennifer is trying to find a new home to start fresh,” a source told People earlier this week.\n\nThe insider also said Lopez “is having a good summer” and is focused on “what’s next” in her life and career."
