        "text": "House music has Marshall Jefferson’s ‘Move Your Body’. Techno has DJ Rolando’s ‘Knights Of The Jaguar’. Trance has Paul van Dyk’s ‘For An Angel’. None of these were the first tracks of their type, but they have all become definitive anthems that stood the test of time and remain iconic in their own right. ‘For An Angel’ was actually German producer van Dyk’s debut release back in 1994. It came originally on his ‘45 RPM’ album on the MFS label, but didn’t make much impact the first time around. It was a 1998 ‘E-Werk Remix’ (named in homage to an influential Berlin club of the time where van Dyk was resident) and subsequent re-release that saw it become a Gold-certified global dancefloor staple, and top the UK Dance Chart for several weeks. From that moment on, ‘For An Angel’ was cemented into trance folklore. It went on to influence a whole generation of producers, while also sending the man behind it stratospheric.\n\nAlthough often lumped in with the turn-of-the-millennium explosion of big-room trance and brands like Gatecrasher and Cream, ‘For An Angel’ pre-dated that. Van Dyk, whose real name is Matthias Paul, had honed in on his own subtle take on ’90s progressive techno and enriched it with heart-swelling melodies way before anyone else. Most likely, it was the track’s huge success that sped up trance’s rapid transition out of underground clubs and into more commercial realms. And it’s easy to see why: every element of the track serves to uplift, from the speedy drums and surging synth hook to the Balearic piano chords that glow with a cuddly, fuzzy warmth. The whole thing encapsulates the feeling of being lost in the heart of a dancefloor. It washes over you like the waves of an ecstasy rush between flashing strobes, as the breathy vocals drift in and out to bring pleasurable hits of sensuous release.\n\nPaul van Dyk grew up in East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall. His first brush with electronic music came from the other side of the great divide, when he would tune into the radio while doing his homework after school. There were a number of specialist shows that catered to the international population of West Berlin, so he heard all the latest sounds from the UK, the US and even France. “I was hooked right away when I heard the free-spirited type of music that was played,” says van Dyk, who would record as much of it as he could off the radio to play back at local parties.\n\nBack then, the music wasn’t defined by the same genre terms that it is today. “It was all electronic, and it was all danceable.” He remembers hearing everything from deep house to Detroit techno, but says he always enjoyed “the musical side of things. So not just a drum pattern that’s filtered up and down. Some of my favourite bands when I was a kid growing up were Depeche Mode and New Order, so I was very influenced by chord structures. The combination of that in electronic music is actually what I enjoyed so much about it.”\n\nThough keen to start his own music-making journey, circumstances didn’t allow it in those early years. Van Dyk grew up as the only child of a single mother. “We didn’t have any money,” he says. “I didn’t have any sort of studio because I could simply not afford it.” When the Berlin Wall came down, he had more access to cheaper gear and so managed to buy a second-hand Roland JX-1. It was a budget keyboard with basic editing parameters and simple filters, but no arpeggiator.\n\n“It looks more like a toy, but it had some really essential sounds in it,” he remembers. Without a computer to add to his basic setup, he says his brain became his sequencer. “I had a bassline that I enjoyed, and I looped it in my head and then played something along to it. With those ideas and basic elements, I went into a studio and played them to recreate what I heard in my head.”\n\nAs for ‘For An Angel’, it was mainly the legendary Roland Juno-60, 106 and trusty JX-1 that formed the basis of the track, along with a tightly compressed 909 bass drum. \"I used an 808 for the little 16th-note hi-hats and delayed them a little, which is why you get this shuffling kind of movement from the drum section,” he recalls. As well as the Roland gear, van Dyk credits his early mentor and co-producer Johnny Klimek for having taught him many of the skills he knew back then.\n\n“I had this clear idea of how the music should sound in my head,” he says. “I tried to kind of vocalise it and bring it across and tell him it should sound like this, and I made funny noises, and he was looking at me like, ‘Oh, he’s gone mad’, so the only way really was for me to learn how to do it. He was the biggest help, and I’m very grateful he taught me these things.”\n\nHis most legendary track was first produced in 1993, right after his first trip to Los Angeles exposed him to something he had never experienced before. “I’m a kid from East Germany, so I had never seen a proper sunset going into the ocean because I had never even been to the west coast of Germany,” he says. The “overload of inspiration from that magical moment” made a lasting impact and is what defined the last two days of his time in the studio while writing his debut album. “I just started playing around and suddenly that hook came up,” he says of how the indelible synths of ‘For An Angel’ came to be. As for the title, there was no great thinking behind it other than attempting to capture the otherworldly feel of that LA sunset, which it does perfectly.\n\nNot long after the track was finished, van Dyk started playing it in the club. It had been recorded on a mobile digital audio tape, a DAT machine, which he took with him to early gigs and connected to his mixer. But the first time he really saw the impact the track could have was a few years later in 1998 when he began playing the E-Werk remix. “I played at Creamfields and I wasn’t that known back then, so I played in the afternoon and I played it from the DAT. The whole place just went absolutely crazy bonkers and I knew, ‘Okay, there’s something extremely special about that piece’. Obviously, as an artist, if you create something that connects and resonates so well, it makes you really, really happy.” The German was soon being hailed as ‘the leader of the trance nation’ — a title he wasn’t comfortable with.\n\n“I don’t want to be the leader of anything,” he says. “I’m a musician, my favourite music is electronic music, and that’s what I do. I was very glad to be involved and be around when that music happened, but at the same time, if you listen to my work you don’t really find any of those stereotypical trance pieces, you don’t really find those sequences that go like left and right and up and down. There’s always a little bit more structure to it because that’s what I love, and that’s always been my musical ambition.”\n\nDespite his protestations, van Dyk has and likely always will be known as a trance titan. He says “it was great” to be part of it and he had “an amazing time” being one of the residents at the legendary Gatecrasher club in Sheffield. “I’m just very, very happy, not just about being part of the trance developments in the late ’90s, but also going back to the beginning of the ’90s. The music we wanted to hear did not really exist, we had to make it. That creative impulse was an amazing time, I’m very glad that I was part of it and have been able as an artist to play my little part in what became probably the biggest music culture in the world.”\n\nUnusually, ‘For An Angel’ has three music videos, which are all quite different. The original is from 1994 and was filmed in Xcaret Eco Park south of Cancun in Mexico. “It was different then from what it is now. They had these theme parks with a big sort of butterfly cage, and we wanted to film the butterflies flying around me. They put butterfly food on my face, a sticky, slimy kind of thing so they would land on it. It was pretty disgusting, to be honest.” The butterflies originally appeared during the track’s spine-tingling breakdown but were later edited out, though this version can still be found on YouTube.\n\nThe second video, from 1998, features shots of van Dyk sitting under a palm tree on Xpu Ha beach watching local kids playing football interspersed with shots of the rich array of local flora and fauna, a wise old Mayan man, Incan ruins at El Rey, and the glistening green-blue sea. It’s got a hippie edge and a Balearic vibe that chimes perfectly with the music. The third video, from 2009, features footage from the Berlin Love Parade interspersed with footage from LA, the original inspiration for the track.\n\nGatecrasher is where van Dyk truly made his name. Those golden years of trance defined an entire clubbing generation and left a lasting mark on the man himself. “It was very intense,” he says now. “People had just learned about the music, it was fresh, they were really excited about it and so they lived it with every cell of their body.” What van Dyk became known for was his extended six-hour sessions. “It was a very different dynamic because unlike a normal peak-time set at 2AM or 3AM, I maybe would play something by Layo & Bushwacka!, not a big trance banger people would have expected. We all celebrated the music together and I was like the conductor in a way, that sort of created the journey, but completely inspired by what the audience in front of me was doing — so these moments were absolutely intense.”\n\n‘For An Angel’ was the Gatecrasher anthem, but even to this day van Dyk knows that no matter where he plays, he pretty much has to drop it at one time or another. “If I don’t, people are gonna go home disappointed somehow. There seems to be this ongoing expectation, but I understand it. If I go and see Depeche Mode and they don’t play ‘Enjoy The Silence’, I’m pissed, so you know...” he says sagely. Like Depeche Mode with their most famous hit, van Dyk never quite plays the same version every time. “Because of the equipment that I use on stage — I’m not playing CDJs or USB sticks on my computer, it’s more like a portable recording studio that I use — so somehow it’s always different even though I have probably played it in every single set.”\n\nIn the decades since, van Dyk has made countless albums and put out an endless stream of singles and several mixes under his The Politics Of Dancing banner. He was the first artist to receive a Grammy Award nomination in the then-new Best Dance/Electronic album category in 2003, and has worked on several film soundtracks and video game scores. To him, all his work has equal importance, but none of it has had quite the same the lasting impact on the wider scene as ‘For An Angel’.\n\n“I don’t know why particularly that piece of music connected so well to the audience, but it has been very good to me,” he says, before revealing that a series of special remixes will arrive later in the year to mark the track’s 30th anniversary. In those three decades of playing his game-changing tune, one occasion sticks out more than any other, and that was during torrential rain at an outdoor gig in New York’s Central Park.\n\n“It was the ultimate celebration of joy and fun and excitement,” he beams. “I was on stage, I was almost dry, but what I saw was like a positive earthquake that I will always remember and will always stand out.” To be lost in the magic of ‘For An Angel’ is a personal, emotional experience, but one that has now been shared by millions of people across the world.\n\nPaul van Dyk headlines his SHINE night every Thursday at Eden in Ibiza until Thursday 26th September"
