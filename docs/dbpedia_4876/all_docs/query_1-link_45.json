The movie centers around the life of wrestler Anthony Robles (Jerome), who was born with one leg and went on to win a national championship in 2011 while competing at Arizona State University.\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nBen Affleck, Matt Damon Developing Hulk Hogan Movie About Gawker Case\n\nMatt Damon and Casey Affleck Debut 'The Instigators,' Will Smith Celebrates 'Bel-Air' and This Week's Best Events\n\nMatt Damon on Teaming With Casey Affleck for 'The Instigators': \"43 Years Into This Friendship, It's Just the Joy of Doing What We Love\"\n\nAs for Lopez, she portrays Anthony’s mother, Judy, while Bobby Cannavale stars as his father Rick. Michael Peña, who plays coach Bobby Williams, and Don Cheadle, who portrays wrestling coach Shawn Charles, round out the cast.\n\n“Anthony Robles, despite being born without a right leg, rises to become a NCAA Division 1 Champion wrestler ultimately winning a national championship against the school that rejected him, national powerhouse Iowa,” the film’s official synopsis reads.\n\nUnstoppable was produced by Lopez’s husband Ben Affleck via the production company he shares with Matt Damon, Artists Equity. Robles also served as a producer on the movie and worked as Jerome’s stunt double, performing the complex wrestling moves.\n\nThe movie marks Goldenberg’s directorial debut. He has previously won an Academy Award for his work as an editor on 2013’s Argo, as well as scored Oscar noms for The Imitation Game, Zero Dark Thirty, Seabiscuit and The Insider.\n\nThe biopic, based on Robles and Murphy’s book Unstoppable: From Underdog to Undefeated: How I Became a Champion, is set to make its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. Then it will hit select theaters in December.\n\nBest of The Hollywood Reporter"
