        "text": "Call me a crank, if you will, but I am overall, extremely exhausted by the superhero genre. And, yes, all the never-ending, extended universes that come with it. Now that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy the occasional example, such as Thor: Ragnarok or Wonder Woman. Too often though, these overblown, over-hyped CGI fests raise stakes to an insurmountable level – That another “OH MY GOD” the end of the world is near… becomes essentially meaningless.\n\nHowever, even my curmudgeon-self can admit that not only is Black Panther a fantastic ideal of the Marvel brand, particularly in terms of acting and script, but also a film where the central conflict is superbly pragmatic, with social relevance that resonates beyond the purview’s of the narrative.\n\nThe film picks up after the events of Captain America: Civil War (actually one of my favorite superhero movies), which featured the assassination of King T’Chaka (John Kani) of Wakanda. Because of his ill-timed death, his son (Chadwick Boseman) must lead this very nation that’s purposely remained clandestine from the rest of the world. This is mainly due to the country’s reserve of the metal Vibranium, stronger than any other metal, the element has other properties that are used to facilitate innovative technology, as well as give powers to those who take the role of the Black Panther, King of Wakanda.\n\nAs with most origin tales, the film has to take its time dispensing all of the background information, and, as compelling as it may be, it prevents the movie from getting to the speed I had hoped for. BUT, the main conflict is in fact, a masterful achievement, as T’Challa’s claim to the throne is challenged by his unknown cousin Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\nPart of what makes Black Panther so fascinating is the result of its complicated villain. Killmonger is never wrong to long for a better world for his brothers and sisters, but his methods are flawed… and his ambiguous personality makes him an imperfect vehicle for the message, even with a point hard to argue. While the action sequences rely far too heavily on CGI effects, they are still relatively exciting once T’Challa’s pursuit of his autocrat begins.\n\nThe most intriguing aspect of the film, in my eyes, is the adjacency of these two young men. T’Challa has been raised to seek a peaceful resolution to most problems, while Killmonger’s evident street-upbringing prompts him to use violence as a first response to every dilemma.\n\nIs this, perhaps, a polemic aimed at American foreign policy? It’s quite possible, as it’s examined even further when Wakanda’s stance of isolationism is put under the microscope. If there is indeed a subtext to this film, it’s that of globalization, and the effects it has on relations – Both foreign and domestic.\n\nThe rest of the cast easily hold their own against the two leads, including Lupita Nyong’o (12 Years a Slave) as Nakia, a warrior princess who is T’Challa’s main love interest; Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead) as Okoye/the head of Wakandan security; Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out) as W’Kabi, a disgruntled prince; and Martin Freeman (Bilbo in the recent Hobbit films) as a CIA officer who unexpectedly finds himself fighting alongside T’Challa and his family. Everyone has talent on full display, and their easy rapport… whether as friends or enemies – truly is a delight to watch.\n\nDirector Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed) does an astounding job creating a cinematic world that makes sense within the rules established in its first scenes. He and cinematographer, Rachel Morrison (Mudbound), give us images of great enticement, with a consistent composition throughout. The film is nearly 2 1/2 hours long, although, it rarely feels as such.\n\nBlack Panther delivers an exquisite new take on the superhero origin story, crisp in its perspective and dynamic in its plotting. Even with my most recent superhero fatigue, I still very much recommend.\n\n4/5 STARS\n\nBy Brandon Colón\n\nbcolon324@gmail.com\n\nThe crowd gathered for the not-so-secret Kumite clamors for the next spectacle of Bloodsport. They have already received their first dose of action based on the first of countless waves of montages showcasing fighters from around the world engaged in full contact fighting.\n\nWhat they receive next is an anomaly of sorts. He stands 6’4”, weighs probably north of 250 and might as well be from Bad Street USA. He sports a Harley Davidson bandana, black sweatpants, and an out of place orange sash that seems mandatory like ties and jackets in certain restaurants. His connection with the crowd is a combination of awe-struck excitement and genuine fear that he might suddenly bring his attack upon them. Similar to the Ultimate Warrior’s energy, running around the canvas, pumping his arms and chanting his name.\n\nRay Jackson could have come straight out of Vince McMahon’s WWF in the 1980’s. However, his opponent on the other hand, looks like the lead singer of the local Wham! cover band. Meorge Gichael gets in a quick kick that would rattle any other opponent. But of course, Jackson seemingly eats Mario’s mushroom and delivers the super rabbit punch from hell that turns Gicheal’s nose into cherry pie, ending the fight rather quickly. If only this was Ray Jackson’s movie, the fish out of water martial arts comedy we all very much deserve.\n\nInstead, Bloodsport is Frank Dux’s movie, based on the life and likely fiction of the same man. This week marks 30 years since this film brought a mainstream audience to the talents of Jean Claude Van Damme. Here, we have a movie that’s 100% product of its time. It’s pure 80’s from endless montages, synth instrumental beats and reliance on action first, while developing characters and plot later. It brilliantly suffers from painful dubbing, obvious ADR (automated dialogue replacement), and one-take no direction acting by most of the supporting cast. What should also be noted is the most ambitious flashback prologue ever conceived in the history of cinema – Bringing another level of parody from how Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story deconstructed the biopic formula.\n\nBut there’s still a reason why it carries a 6.8 on IMDB, and it has nothing to do with any of the above mentioned. Bloodsport succeeds at being exactly what its supposed to be: It’s Rocky IV in a karate gi.\n\nVan Damme’s character might not feel like a real underdog, but he elicits enough sympathy based on his backstory to be a solid protagonist that we all want to root for. And if that wasn’t enough, once Jackson turns into a near dead Apollo Creed at the hands of Chong Li, it becomes vastly evident who the big fight has to be against. Watching them both journey toward that end is quite enjoyable, as Dux executes his martial arts like a ballet or symphony, where as Li dismantles opponents with brute force and styles of other fighters mixed in between.\n\nIt’s hard to say whether younger audiences nowadays would care about Bloodsport like the kids in the 80’s and 90’s did, revering Van Damme’s sub genre of martial arts films. It is indeed outrageous to call Warrior a comp to this film, but if the former was made in 1988… it would surely resemble the latter.\n\nEven as it was a product of its time, that didn’t stop Van Damme from trying to remake the movie in the form of 1996’s The Quest. Bringing back the martial arts with an immense budget upgrade, it relied way too heavily on the bathos surrounding his character’s journey through yet another perilous tournament. Bloodsport is brilliant, if you will, in that it has just enough melodrama to check off the box before moving back into more fighting. It knows exactly what it is… and that is its greatest strength.\n\n2.5/5 STARS\n\nBy William Renken\n\nwilliam.renken@gmail.com\n\nSo the other day when I was bed ridden with the flu, I thought to myself, what better way to pass the time than watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy… since those last an eternity and perhaps I might feel better by the time they finish. I popped in the films and about an hour into The Fellowship of the Ring, I saw a familiar face. This handsome, yet almost foreign man, was that of Orlando Bloom. Staring at him dumbfounded, wondering what the hell happened to him – My middle school memories of this heartthrob emerged, stealing the attention of every girl I was ever into.\n\nI suddenly had to pause the movie to investigate the “disappearance” of Orlando, because my sheer curiosity just wouldn’t let me focus on the little hobbits running around. I went onto IMDB and looked at his filmography. I learned how in 2001 within 2 weeks of finishing acting classes, he was given the role of Faramir in LOTR, but was soon switched to that of Legolas. This massive role instantly catapulted him into stardom and plastered his face on posters bought by teenage girls around the world.\n\nThis was just the beginning for him, though, as he went on to star in the next two LOTR films released in 2002 and 2003. Between them, he was also involved in a couple of other flicks – The very successful Blackhawk Down and Ned Kelly, playing alongside Heath Ledger. Everything is going great right? Well it actually even gets better…\n\nMost actors would be lucky to star in one successful movie trilogy, but Orlando ended up starring in two, being cast next in the role of Will Turner for the Pirates of the Caribbean. No longer a sexy elf, he was now a sexy swashbuckling pirate, even harder to compete with in Middle School. So the posters of Elf Orlando were swapped for Pirate Orlando as he starred in his next successful trilogy from 2003-2007.\n\nFurthermore, Orlando found himself in popular movies Kingdom of Heaven and Troy with Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. While not scoring the most points with critics, both films did relatively well at the box-office. Then, the daunted year of 2007 comes, and he no longer has a successful trilogy to fall back on. But it’s okay! Because this is Orlando’s moment to shine… to prove to the world that he’s able to be successful on his own, regardless of a franchise! Well, that never really happened.\n\nThe more I looked at his IMDB page, the more it became clear that Orlando was always the supporting man with a team of people behind him to sorta take the focus off. In LOTR, he was juxtaposed with one of the greatest film ensembles in recent memory. Don’t get me wrong, Orlando as Legolas was fine, but if you really dig deep, you come to find he was pretty one dimensional and wasn’t slated with much depth. Same goes for his role as Will Turner; while suave and swashbuckling, his emotional persona wasn’t what made the character. It was decent humor, yes, and his physicality needed for the role, but after that you really do hit a bit of a dead end.\n\nWe all know Johnny Deep was the main reasons for that franchise’s unprecedented success. Without Deep, who knows if Pirates of the Caribbean would’ve even made $100 mil at the box-office, even though with him it came close to $1 bil.\n\nI realize this is very silly, but if you take out all the films in which Orlando is a supporting character prior to 2007, we are left with films such as: Sympathy for Delicious, The Good Doctor (which went straight to DVD), the horrific Three Musketeers, Zulu, Unlocked, and The Shanghai Job.\n\nNow let us not forget, he was also in two of the recent “Hobbit” films. But in those productions his character felt so grossly forced, out of place, and had outrageous action sequences that only made us long even further for the old glory days of LOTR.\n\nSo what happened to him? After pausing the movie for well over an hour, the answer seems that between off-screen binge drinking, blackouts, a divorce, a fight with Justin Bieber, paired with his inability to lead a film, A-list Hollywood simply won’t cast him (And I don’t blame them). Today he is a man settling for B-grade movies, as he’s simply fallen into the dark and gloomy category of actors or actresses that used to be something. Harsh, right? Yeah, almost as bad as this flu. Anyhoo, back to my movie.\n\nHonorable mentions: Chris Tucker, Katherine Heigl, Jessica Alba, Hilary Swank, Michael Cera.\n\nBy Nick Weininger\n\nnickweninger@gmail.com\n\nIG: @theaveragemanreview\n\nThere’s always been a Venn diagram that exists involving movies and their releases on television. One side of the circle labeled movies constantly on cable and the other side being movies I’d watch if I actually came across them… on cable. The Replacements turns 18 this year, and though I realize this is not quite a landmark or rounded out milestone, it’s a film that has constantly found its way into this interesting intersection.\n\nReleased in August of 2000, The Replacements by and large came and went in the aftermath of summer. I, personally, have a special place for The Replacements in my heart – Being that it was my first year working at the movie theater. But in all honesty, most people don’t concur (“WHY DIDN’T I CONCUR”, Catch Me If You Can hospital scene) Anyways… moving on.\n\nIt carries an above average 6.5 on IMDB, but also a less-than-stellar 41% on Rotten Tomatoes, and a pretty dreadful 30% Metacritic rating. Combine that with the basic plot summary that comes right out of the sports movie handbook, and it does indeed feel like a forgotten 2000 film on paper.\n\nHowever, cable television has always found a way of being a great equalizer. Not long after it left theaters (in a hurry), The Replacements found a home on multiple channels to the point where even right now in our glorious year of 2018, if you’re clicking through your guide in any given month… you’re likely to stumble upon it. Whether that be Comedy Central, TBS, or TNT – It has this very weird staying power, and not by coincidence either.\n\nTo circle back to the plot, it is, again, as plain as a Nilla wafer. Professional football players (no NFL licensing used) ultimately go on strike and team owners recruit replacement players to finish the rest of the season. Specifically, the film follows the Washington Sentinels (Redskins, if this was NFL licensing) and how they took on the task of fielding a team finding scrubs.\n\nThe interesting thing about The Replacements is how it’s based mostly on truth. There in fact was a NFL players strike in 1987. Recently, ESPN tackled the actual incident in the 30 for 30 Year of the Scab, an excellent companion to the film we’re dissecting today. Also based in truth is how the Washington Redskins were considered the most successful of the teams fielding replacement players, but, after that parallel… the similarities end.\n\nI absolutely love the opening of this film. We’re brought to a harbor where the sun has just made its appearance. A man emerges from the cabin of his house boat, yawning and wishing he could go back inside, but knowing it’s time to get to work. A precise feel of your typical Monday morning reaction.\n\nWe then come across Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves) who puts on his wet suit and proceeds to scrape muck from the bottom of another boat. Presumably this is his job, and it’s evident he’s content with this sort of work. That is until, he spots a metallic football resting on the shallow ocean floor beneath him. Sure enough it has his name engraved along with “All-American” underneath. (Which brings up an interesting thought as to how it got there in the first place, which is never really explored.)\n\nFalco takes a moment to pretend underwater that he is coming under center. Snapping the ball on what is likely a first and goal barely inside the ten yard line. “DOWN. SET. HUT!” He screams inside his mind, dropping back and delivering a slow driving spiral through the thick water that goes… wherever. His fantasy is like Montana hitting Taylor in Super Bowl XXXIII to win the game. He celebrates, fist pumps, and has a brief solitary moment of simultaneous nostalgia and longing. It is here we discover he was once a pretty darn good football player, still holding onto the game, but in no position to do anything more than toss a ball for fun.\n\nWhat follows next is an attempt to assemble a motley group of football players who are either has beens or a never was. There’s a SWAT team member (the most jacked we’ll ever see Jon Favreau), an inmate, two club bouncers, a sumo wrestler, a deaf tight end, a hard drinking Welsh soccer player, and a lightning fast convenience store clerk that can’t even catch a ball. Sure, the band of marginally athletic misfits don’t get along early and frequently get in their own way, but it’s nothing a bar fight and an impromptu Electric Slide to “I Will Survive” in a jail cell won’t fix.\n\nDon’t look too hard, but the next rendition of Vince McMahon’s XFL will certainly have plenty of these types returning for another chance at everlasting football glory.\n\nOddly enough, I’ve made it this far without mentioning that Gene Hackman is also in this film as the coach of the wild bunch. This is four years from retirement-Hackman, and it’s a pretty docile performance for the most part. This isn’t a Popeye Doyle or Little Bill kind of role. It isn’t even a Mississippi Burning type of performance where you can tell there’s an incredible amount of inner turmoil masked by slick charisma. Hackman’s Jimmy McGinty, like Falco and the others, is just looking for another shot. Though, there is one great scene that really helps glue the movie together, showcasing its surprising depth for a cliché sports movie.\n\nThe “quicksand” scene brings the ensemble collectively in the locker room either before or after a practice. McGinty writes on the blackboard F E A R in big letters, asking the players to talk about theirs. The brilliance of the scene is how it starts off lighthearted with Orlando Jones confessing his fear of bees and spiders, which seems to stray from the point that McGinty is trying to make. But once Falco speaks up and says that his is quicksand – The room gets quiet and re-centers the discussion. It’s a nice understated sequence from Reeves where he equates the struggle of escaping quicksand to life in football. How a mistake can easily be followed by another, and another, and how the desperate action to reverse the trend can ultimately lead to being “in over your head” or translated better: out of football forever.\n\nEvery single actor nails their non-verbals, displaying how they can exactly identify with what Falco is saying. Everyone is afraid of going back to being, in their minds, nobodies. McGinty rounds out the scene by describing what all of them have that so many people wish they had: A second chance.\n\nAny more than that and The Replacements would come off as being a film it just simply isn’t. The only extensions beyond the main plot are really reserved for Falco and his budding relationship with the head cheerleader, Annabelle. They get a tremendous scene towards the end of Act II – Needing everything to be in shambles in order to make Act III”s victory and reconciliation special.\n\nThe sneaky good soundtrack The Replacements has is also worth mentioning. The opening scene described previously carries Lit’s “Ziplock” to underscore the beginning of Falco’s day. The lyrics totally help you grasp where Falco is in his life, along with the instrumentals that capture the innocence of the 90’s and the pre-9/11 world.\n\nNearing the end of Act II there’s also a fantastic slow pull in on Falco, with Rolling Stone’s “Blinded by Rainbows” being heard aloud, he sits calmly by the water feeling at his lowest. BOOM! His replacement career seems over, while Washington’s previous MVP quarterback crosses the picket line. Now Falco conveys emotions of insecurity, wondering if his burgeoning relationship with Annabelle will work – Being that he’s back to “scraping crap off the bottom of other people’s toys.”\n\nReeves is immensely underrated as an actor who can communicate without speaking. Only in the last five years or so has he broken free of the ridicule received for speaking almost any line not in The Matrix or Speed and sounding like he’s still in Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure. Selling the scene wonderfully as a man who has been gutted and cut off at the knees, you can’t help but feel sympathetic.\n\nHe finally started to overcome the mental blocks that held him back from becoming the great quarterback he was supposed to be… only to have it all end in an instant because his resume doesn’t stack up to the returning Eddie Martel. Of course being the anti-Ron Shelton sports movie The Replacements is, there’s still a big game to play at the end, and you can bet your bottom dollar that Falco will be a part of it. But it’s still a nice brief scene that anyone can identify with.\n\nYou know from the moment Pat Summerall, operating as the exposition of plot, says that Washington needs to win three of the four replacement games, the script will probably have them being 2-1 heading into that fourth crucial contest… likely coming down to a dramatic conclusion. The drama is especially hyped because the opposing Dallas team had all of its players cross the picket line, thus making them at full strength. Washington, on the other hand, has to win with its same roster of scrubs. This is another great callback to the actual 1987 NFL strike since the same was true of the Redskins playing the Cowboys in the final game of the season.\n\nThe way the game plays out in the movie is fine, and it’s for sure satisfying. However, the epilogue or lack of one is particularly brilliant. McGinty watches the team celebrate with handshakes and more Electric Slides with a bittersweet expression of glee and despair. The ride is over for all of them now, as players have officially crossed the picket line at season’s end.\n\nWe hear a monologue where McGinty romantically closes our experience with the team, saying that there weren’t any endorsement deals waiting for the replacement players. Just a locker to clean out and bus ride to catch. He closes with a fitting final line: “Most people dream of a second chance. These men lived it.” And that’s the movie.\n\nAfter all of the clichés it leaned onto, it avoided probably the one that would have taken the story down a few pegs. No one, including Falco, presumably continues on with the Sentinels (which is highly unlikely if you go by how the Redskins kept some of their replacement players on the roster through the playoff run they had). We can make assumptions, but McGinty’s monologue leads us to believe that the four game stretch they had playing professional football was all they were going to get. And if that is so, we can only hope that maybe the experience will leave them in a better place once they catch that bus ride home. It really has this nice 48 Hours feel to it, where at the end Eddie Murphy goes back to jail and a fast one isn’t pulled where magically he’s done with the rest of his term.\n\nWhat makes The Replacements such a watch no matter where you may come across it – Whether that be the middle of the day or a during a prime-time showing, is the fascination and lovable attributes around the team. Forget all the other stuff. There’s an argument that the mark of a good movie should be on how much you enjoy repeatedly dropping in on the world they’ve set up, as well as the characters its brings before you.\n\nThe Replacements may never top somebody’s list of even the best sports movies, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t facets of the film to treasure. My favorite being an important message they channel from the very beginning. That just because what you love might have seemingly passed you by, doesn’t mean you won’t necessarily catch up to it somewhere later in life.\n\nBy William Renken\n\nwilliam.renken@gmail.com\n\nWhat happens when you add female writer/director Augustine Frizzell with two perfectly matched female leads? One fucked up comedy that will have you laughing your ass off while desperately rooting for them to succeed. Sundance is stuffed to the brim with exquisite films and definitely deep, dark dramas are the ring leaders. So seeing Never Goin’ Back was the dose of comedic relief that I yearned for.\n\nThis film certainly breathes life into serious subject matter, but doesn’t stay too focused on it. For anyone who has or is living through an adventurous, or perhaps, difficult upbringing, Never Goin’ Back will make you cackle at the ludicrous situations only your teenage-self could have gotten away with.\n\nAngela (Maia Mitchell) and Jessie (Camila Morrone) share a bed, living under one roof with Jessie’s older douche-bag brother Dustin (Joel Allen). Also Jessie’s legal guardian, the two girls don’t only live with him, but his perverted friend Brandon (Kyle Mooney) as well. The lack of parental oversight is faintly pressed upon, leaving us to assume the world has not been kind to them – But regardless of whatever circumstances they may have withstood, it’s clear the two have found a way to still lead their own lives with much tenacity and grit.\n\nOpening on Angela waking up Jessie with a drawn dick on her face, sums up a precise foreshadow for the fun this film brings as well as the structure of their relationship. Sure, it’s just a dick, but the love the girls have for each other is vehemently on display through their comfortabity. Is that a word? Probably not, but it doesn’t matter here – Because its the perfect way to describe the situation and their very serene relationship.\n\nIn a sense, they’re also saviors to themselves. Consistently helping one another from going mad, because being two waitress high school dropouts is still better than living that life alone.\n\nAngela soon decides to surprise Jessie with a beach condo in Galveston, Texas for her birthday – Admitting that she used most of their rent money to do so. But, nothing can go wrong, as they have a plan all worked out… covering all shifts possible during the week so they come out even.\n\nFor the sake of the film, it’s great how all goes to shit when their brother’s future best friend Tony (Kendall Smith) robs them in a drug deal gone bad, as cops then find the girls drugs whilst them getting a quick trip to juvie. Stressing over the rent money, their trip goes out the window, while bad decisions and roadblocks get in the way of keeping them together.\n\nThe obstacles faced, include, but are not limited to: Spilled bong-water drenched uniforms, beer drenched uniforms, being called whores by a bigot, accidental intake of space brownies before asking for your job back, a bitch-and-half hostess, fake threesome promises, a dick in a hot dog bun with spicy mustard, or was it dijon? Constipation, shitting in a bucket…Still hungry? A little vomiting… and some good ol’ fashion blackmail!\n\nThe girl’s here are indeed charming, and do definitely stand out, but veer from the typical Hollywood prototypes – Being beautiful in a time where it’s okay to be both petite and curvy. Even the obnoxious band of pin-headed men lead by Dustin make you love them for… being just that. Also, scenes such as when the girls are handcuffed, being taken to the police car and when they’re walking off a public bus, stoned as hell, are just two examples of many comically timed moments that will form immense guttural laughter.\n\nThis film isn’t perfect, because life itself isn’t. The energy and effort screams independent and personal, so much so that on those attributes alone it’s a wild success. These girls who want nothing more than to escape for the beach, grasp the fact their static existence needs change, and they do so together.\n\nSome will love it… and others will judge. However, in the real world, there are plentiful amounts of shitty people and predicaments – And with the storytelling in Never Goin’ Back, you come to understand we all need laughter at times… particularly in dire situations, to help hold your head up high. I mean, lets be real here, everybody has a little racthetness inside – And sometimes that’s exactly what you need to make sure you’re never goin’ back to a place you don’t want to remain.\n\n4/5 STARS\n\nBy Amanda Nova\n\namesquilin@gmail.com\n\nIG: @filmyanimal\n\nIn this 2018 Sundance Film Festival premiere, we have the story of young army vet, Mike Burden – A man raised by his family to carry the Ku Klux Klan’s torch under any means necessary. But, just as in any true fairy-tale, Burden falls for a delightfully dysfunctional woman who is down on her luck. The problem for him, of course, is that she views Negros as her equal.\n\nIn order for their aspired relationship to continue, he has a life altering decision to make: Stay in the KKK, which he’s been raised to know and fight for, ultimately losing the only girl he’s ever loved – Or leave the Klan behind for said girl, whilst standing with her and for equality.\n\nHeckler’s Burden opens with a scene involving a building demolition, featuring exhausted, yet ecstatic men ready to pounce and break every last wall and window. Progressing through the same sequence, we see the rebuild – A careful persistence and joy in this family’s eyes as they finish building their main stage.\n\nAlas, their work of art isn’t complete until one canvas hangs proudly for its creator, his prodigy, and the rest of the town to see… The Confederate flag. This sets a mood for what’s about to transpire throughout. From the assembled museum of bigotry, to the Sunday night cook outs followed by an all too common, and oddly routine cross burning ritual – Heckler paints the picture of what this group truly wants: The rise of the white race. One would think this was a scene straight out of the 1950’s, but no. In fact, Heckler wastes no time letting us know this is Laurens, South Carolina in 1996.\n\nGriffith (Tom Wilkinson) the god-like father of this KKK chapter in Laurens, is a man whose violent and sadistic behavior actively encourages deprived conduct of his famed disciple, Mike Burden (Garrett Hedlund). Burden, an orphan who Griffith crafts into a mirror-like image of himself, becomes inculcated with the roots and beliefs of segregation while spewing hatred for all blacks and foreigners.\n\nFighting a battle with a local black rights movement led by Reverend Kennedy (Forest Whitaker), Griffith desperately seeks a win in a world that is evolving and becoming far more inclusive of POC’s (people of color), instead of protecting what he believes is right.\n\nBurden, who is viewed by Griffith as a pawn on his radical racist chess board, works for him as a repo man. Malleable, ignorant, and a puppet who hangs by Griffith’s strings, Burden is in a desperate search to belong to anyone or anything. Relenting any self-power and identity to the desires of his clan superiors, he finds himself habitually committing ignorant acts that are nothing other than horrid hate crimes.\n\nSuch racist idiocy include: Driving by with buddies and peeing on an unsuspecting black girl who was walking home because he found it amusing, and beating up an innocent young black man to prove his authority over an arrogant “nigger” who was in his way. His list of transgressions is long, but what we can see throughout the film that this sentiment was taught and not inherent.\n\nDuring one of his repo runs with Clint (Austin Hebert), Griffith’s son, he meets Judy (Andrea Riseborough) – A single mother in distress struggling to make ends meet while taking care of her son. Her constant disheveled look and bruises convey some sort of intimate struggle that we, as an audience, may not pick up on, but that Burden is intrigued by. Fixated on her at first sight, he sees part of himself in her eyes.\n\nThe kind of character that would defend a black woman and apologize on behalf of her white peers, she keeps Reverend Kennedy in high regards while allowing her son to play with whomever regardless of race. It is unclear at what age Burden begins to have distasteful sentiments towards people of color, but we learn through an encounter with Clarence (Usher Raymond III), his childhood best friend, that he must have changed during his army years\n\nThe film examines Burden’s internal conflict as he battles between maintaining a relationship with those who welcomed & molded him, and fighting for what he knows to be right.\n\nThough the script was written over a decade ago, it was based on a story that seems too far from current historical recollection – Yet still very poignant as ever today. With this tantalizing piece of visionary art, Heckler manages to complete two tasks: Captivate us with a storyline so down to earth it invokes an empathetic emotional roller-coaster, and encourages us to dig deep within ourselves to explore our own biases.\n\nReminiscent of David McKenna’s, American History X, Burden teaches its audience that hatred is not within us and that anything which can be taught can also be deconstructed through love, unity & ally ship.\n\n“If we die to go to heaven I’ll fight to get you in, if we die and go to hell, I’d fight to get you out” – Mike Burden.\n\n3.5/5 STARS\n\nBy Karen Rodriguez\n\nkarenrodriguez329@gmail.com"
