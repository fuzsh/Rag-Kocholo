        "text": "Jennifer Lopez costars with Jharrel Jerome, Bobby Cannavale and Don Cheadle in 'Unstoppable,' a biopic about wrestler Anthony Robles\n\nJennifer Lopez will soon return to the big screen in an inspiring wrestling biopic produced by her husband Ben Affleck.\n\nOn Thursday, August 8, Amazon MGM Studios shared first look images at Lopez, 55, and her costars Jharrel Jerome, Bobby Cannavale, Michael Peña and Don Cheadle in their new movie Unstoppable, which follows the real-life story of wrestler Anthony Robles, who was born with one leg and won a NCAA national championship in 2011 while competing for Arizona State University.\n\nLopez portrays Anthony's mother Judy in the upcoming movie, while Cannavale, 54, portrays the wrestler's father Rick. In one first-look photo, Lopez can be seen in character planting a kiss on Robles' head. (He's played in the film by Moonlight actor Jerome.) Other images show Cheadle, 59, as a wrestling coach named Shawn Charles. Peña, 48, portrays another coach named Bobby Williams in the film.\n\nUnstoppable was produced by Affleck and Matt Damon's production company Artists Equity. The movie marks Lopez's first film since her Netflix movie Atlas began streaming earlier this year and the second project she and Affleck have collaborated on since they married in 2022, including her February release This Is Me ... Now.\n\nRelated: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck Are 'Moving on Separately': 'She Hasn't Seen Ben for Weeks' (Source)\n\n\"Anthony Robles, despite being born without a right leg, rises to become a NCAA Division 1 Champion wrestler ultimately winning a national championship against the school that rejected him, national powerhouse Iowa,\" reads an official synopsis for the movie.\n\nA press release for the film additionally notes that real-life wrestler Robles also worked on the film as a producer and is credited as a stunt double for Jerome, 26.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"What fun, what a joy to do something with her, see her be great, go to work with your wife, go to work with your best friend,\" Affleck told CBS Sunday Mornings of working with Lopez on Unstoppable back in March 2023. \"If you don't like who you're working with, and if you have difficulty or trouble at work, I think it's one of the things that can really cause depression, anxiety and pain for people,\" he added at the time. \"And conversely, [if] you love the people at work, you probably have a pretty good life, you know?\"\n\nRelated: Jennifer Lopez 'Always Has Good Attitude Even When Things Are Not Perfect' as She and Ben Affleck Spend Summer Apart: Source\n\nThe upcoming movie also marks a directorial debut for William Goldenberg, who has worked as an editor a number of Affleck's movies and previously won an Oscar for his work on 2012's Argo.\n\nUnstoppable is making its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
