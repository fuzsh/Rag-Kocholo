        "text": "An impressive 12 films have followed, ranging from movies about the whole X-Men clan to origin stories for individual characters.\n\nBut the timeline is admittedly a little fuzzy, particularly when you throw the likes of Days of Future Past and Logan into the mix.\n\nWondering how to watch the X-Men series in release or chronological order? Read on for everything you need to know.\n\nMore like this\n\nAnd with Deadpool & Wolverine acting as both the latest instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a continuation of Fox’s X-Men universe, you might also want to check out how to watch the Marvel movies in order in preparation.\n\nThe X-Men movies in chronological order\n\nAlthough the first three X-Men movies followed a straight linear order, soon the franchise jumps back in time to explore the backstory of Wolverine, arguably the saga’s most successful character.\n\nFrom there, the time-hopping is constant, with prequel movie First Class exploring the younger days of Professor X and Magneto, and Days of Future Past splitting the movies into two timelines (more on that below).\n\nSound confusing? That’s because it is. However, there’s an easy way to simplify things: watch the films in chronological order.\n\nAnd before you ask: it's currently unclear just how the upcoming superhero film Deadpool & Wolverine will fit into the X-Men story, but we'll update this page as soon as we have more details.\n\nThe chronological order for the previous 13 films is as follows:\n\nX-Men: First Class (set in 1962, released in 2011)\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past (primarily set in 1973, released in 2014)\n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine (set in 1981, released in 2009)\n\nX-Men: Apocalypse (set in 1983, released in 2016)\n\nX-Men: Dark Phoenix (set in 1992, released in 2019)\n\nX-Men (set in 2000, released in 2000)\n\nX2: X-Men United (set in 2003, released in 2003)\n\nX-Men: The Last Stand (set in 2006, released in 2006)\n\nThe Wolverine (set in 2013, released in 2013)\n\nDeadpool (set in 2016, released in 2016)​\n\nDeadpool 2 (set 2018, released in 2018)\n\nThe New Mutants (set in 2020, released in 2020)\n\nLogan (2029, released in 2017)\n\nHow to watch X-Men movies in release order\n\nHere’s how to watch the X-men movies in order of their cinematic release dates. Although the timeline will be somewhat jumbled, most viewers will be able to understand the overall plot arc. Studio Fox wouldn’t have released the movies in this order if they thought cinemagoers would be left completely miffed.\n\nThe X-Men movies by release date order is as follows:\n\nX-Men (2000)\n\nX2 (2003)\n\nX-Men: The Last Stand (2006)\n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)\n\nX-Men: First Class (2011)\n\nThe Wolverine (2013)\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past (2014)\n\nDeadpool (2016)\n\nX-Men: Apocalypse (2016)\n\nLogan (2017)\n\nDeadpool 2 (2018)\n\nDark Phoenix (2019)\n\nThe New Mutants (2020)\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine (2024)\n\nWe asked a panel of pop-culture enthusiasts to share their thoughts on the release of The Marvels. Watch the full Marvel versus DC debate show now.\n\nX-Men (2000)\n\nWatch X-Men on Disney Plus\n\nThe debut instalment of the X-men franchise introduces audiences to Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), founder of the prestigious Institute for Higher Learning. Attending pupils and students don’t just possess genius-level IQ, though: each wields a special superpower, result of genetic mutation.\n\nThe students aren’t the only ones with superpowers – the teachers are also mutants. The telepathic Xavier – or Professor X – joins lightning-summoning Storm (Halle Berry), telekinetic Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Cyclops (James Marsden), a man who fires uncontrollable red beams from his eyes. And, last but certainly not least, there’s the almost invincible Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman.\n\nWhile this team of superhumans use their powers to protect society, their position is threatened by a gang of rogue mutants led by the metal-manipulating Magneto (Ian McKellen).\n\nX2 (2003)\n\nWatch X2 on Disney Plus\n\nThe events of the first X-Men saw the titular team of heroes battle against Magneto’s Brotherhood of Mutants, but both sides are forced to form an alliance in the sequel.\n\nBased on the graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills, X2 sees the ruthless Colonel William Stryker launch a deadly attack on the X-Mansion. The reason? To hijack the mutant-tracking computer Cerebro for his own evil purposes.\n\nX-Men: The Last Stand (2006)\n\nWatch X-Men: The Last Stand on Disney Plus\n\nAlthough the first two X-Men movies focused on virtually the same cast of heroes and villains, The Last Stand threw every mutant possible into the climax to the original trilogy. A real highlight here is the outstandingly ridiculous Juggernaut, played by Vinnie Jones.\n\nHowever, despite the new cast, one mutant takes centre stage: Jean Grey. Following the classic Dark Phoenix saga of the original comic books, the film sees the telepath struggle to deal with newfound limitless powers.\n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)\n\nWatch X-Men Origins: Wolverine on Disney Plus\n\nDelving into the backstory of, you guessed it, Wolverine, the action-packed adventure documents Logan’s time with William Stryker and the black ops Team X group. Although criticised for its use of CGI (particularly those godawful computer-generated claws), the movie gives Hugh Jackman a fantastic platform as the franchise’s most popular hero.\n\nAlso, another reason to watch: it features the first appearance of Ryan Reynolds's Deadpool. Although not as you know him.\n\nX-Men: First Class (2011)\n\nWatch X-Men: First Class on Disney Plus\n\nA prequel to the first X-Men movie, the 1960s-set First Class follows the early days of Professor X (now played by James McAvoy) and his then-friend Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Against the backdrop of the Cuban missile crisis, the pair battle the Hellfire Club, led by mutant supremacist (Kevin Bacon) - who’s hell-bent on launching nuclear war.\n\nSignificantly, First Class also introduces the Oscar-winning Jennifer Lawrence to the franchise, the actress playing shapeshifter Mystique.\n\nThe Wolverine (2013)\n\nWatch The Wolverine on Disney Plus\n\nFollowing the events of The Last Stand, The Wolverine follows the titular mutant as he journeys to Japan to meet an old acquaintance – and deal with the guilt of a close friend’s death.\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past (2014)\n\nWatch X-Men: Days of Future Past on Disney Plus\n\nArguably the best instalment in the film series, Days of Future Past connects the prequel stars with the franchise’s original cast in this time-bending tale. Starting off in a dystopian 2023, Wolverine (once again played by Jackman) is forced to jump back to 1973 to prevent the rise of an army of evil Sentinels.\n\nDeadpool (2016)\n\nWatch Deadpool on Disney Plus\n\nAlthough set in the X-Men universe, this is by no means your average superhero film. Starring Ryan Reynolds as the red-suited merc-with-a-mouth, Deadpool offers a comedic and downright meta twist on the mutant saga.\n\nX-Men: Apocalypse (2016)\n\nWatch X-Men: Apocalypse on Disney Plus\n\nA sequel to Days of Future Past, Apocalypse is set in 1983 and sees Xavier’s band of mutants battle it out against the world's first mutant, played by Oscar Isaac in some very heavy prosthetics. And he’s no easy match, summoning powers of telekinesis and teleportation – plus the ability to change powers of other mutants.\n\nLogan (2017)\n\nWatch Logan on Disney Plus\n\nWhile Deadpool offered a refreshingly comedic take on the X-Men franchise, Logan goes the opposite direction, serving up a gritty and downright violent tale centred on Wolverine (Jackman). However, he isn’t the indestructible mutant from previous movies: set in 2019, the film portrays an ageing Logan whose powers are fading.\n\nDeadpool 2 (2018)\n\nWatch Deadpool 2 on Disney Plus\n\nSequel to Deadpool’s 2016 outing, Deadpool 2 offers more of the same: meta gags aplenty, a stellar performance from Ryan Reynolds and a surprisingly emotional punch. This time the titular hero battles time-travelling cybernetic hero Cable (Josh Brolin), a fight that requires him to form the X-Force – with mixed results.\n\nDark Phoenix (2019)\n\nWatch Dark Phoenix on Disney Plus\n\nThe franchise’s second attempt at portraying the Dark Phoenix saga, the 2019 outing sees Sophie Turner (Sansa from Game of Thrones) take centre stage as a young Jean Grey. Exactly like The Last Stand, her new powers threaten not only her fellow mutants, but the entire planet.\n\nThe New Mutants (2020)\n\nWatch The New Mutants on Disney Plus\n\nThe New Mutants is the thirteenth X-Men release, although it tends to be seen more as a standalone film, mimicking Chris Claremont's original The New Mutants comic run in the 1980s.\n\nFeaturing another Game of Thrones star in Maisie Williams (Wolfsbane) alongside Anya Taylor-Joy (Magik) and Charlie Heaton (Cannonball), it sees a young group of mutants locked up in a secret facility which claims it will cure them of their powers.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine (2024)\n\nRyan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman will soon be returning in the upcoming superhero film Deadpool & Wolverine, which is set to land in cinemas this week, but things will look a little different this time: the new film is officially in the MCU.\n\nThe film will also introduce several new faces into the fold, including Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova, Matthew Macfadyen as TVA Agent Mr Paradox and dog actor Peggy as Dogpool.\n\nFans can also expect some exciting cameos, with director Shawn Levy recently teasing that there are some shock appearances that fans haven't predicted yet.\n\nX-Men movies in dual timeline order\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past is, according to most of the franchise’s fanbase, the best film of the lot. However, it’s a movie that scrambles the timeline of the entire franchise. Why? Well, it’s complicated.\n\nDays of Future Past kickstarts in a dystopian future of 2023, a time when all X-Men are hunted down by killer robots known as sentinels. In these scenes, the main mutants are played by their original actors – Ian McKellen is Magneto, while Patrick Stewart portrays Professor X.\n\nTo ensure their survival, the remaining mutants adopt a drastic plan: launch Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to prevent the genocidal bots from ever existing. How? Logan has to stop the capture of a young shape-shifting Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) by scientists who go on to use her DNA to develop the sentinels.\n\nAs you’ve probably guessed by now (SPOILER INCOMING) Wolverine succeeds, with the help of younger versions of Professor X (played by James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender).\n\nHowever, by altering the past, Wolverine created two contradicting timelines, which split at 1973. There are now two versions of history: one depicted by the original three X-Men movies, and one by the more recent movies set in the 1980s and early 1990s. Although they contain the same characters, different events occur in each timeline.\n\nSure, it’s a little perplexing, but these parallel timelines offer viewers two possible binges…\n\nTimeline A\n\nX-Men: First Class (set in 1962, released in 2011)\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past (primarily set in 1973, released in 2014)\n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine (set in 1981, released in 2009)\n\nX-Men (set in 2000, released in 2000)\n\nX2: X-Men United (set in 2003, released in 2003)\n\nX-Men: The Last Stand (set in 2006, released in 2006)\n\nThe Wolverine (set in 2013, released in 2013)\n\nTimeline B\n\nX-Men: First Class (set in 1962, released in 2011)\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past (primarily set in 1973, released in 2014)\n\nX-Men: Apocalypse (set in 1983, released in 2016)\n\nX-Men: Dark Phoenix (set in 1992, released in 2019)\n\nDeadpool (set in 2016, released in 2016)​\n\nDeadpool 2 (2018, released in 2018)\n\nThe New Mutants (set in 2020, released in 2020)\n\nLogan (2029, released in 2017)\n\nUpcoming X-Men movies and TV series\n\nWith Disney's acquisition of Fox, X-Men fans are awaiting the inevitable introduction of their favourite mutants into the MCU.\n\nIn fact, we've already seen mutants in the MCU, with Professor X making an appearance in an alternate universe during Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness.\n\nThe Ms Marvel finale also confirmed Kamala Khan's identity as a mutant, potentially tying in The Marvels to the mutant saga.\n\nHowever, the only upcoming film firmly relating to X-Men is Deadpool & Wolverine, which will see the return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.\n\nThe movie is set to hit cinemas this week on 26th July.\n\nWhich X-Men movies are on Disney Plus?\n\nAs studio Fox is now owned by Disney, you can watch every X-Men movie by subscribing to the streaming service Disney Plus, alongside a handful of other Marvel films created in the same era, including Fantastic Four and Daredevil.\n\nAlongside the X-Men movies, several other X-Men properties are also available on Disney Plus. These include:\n\nLegion (TV series, 2017-2019)\n\nThe Gifted (TV series, 2017-2018)\n\nX-Men (Animated TV series, 1992-1996)"
