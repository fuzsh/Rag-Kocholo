        "text": "1996 - 1997\n\nColdplay formed in 1996 after members Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland, Guy Berryman and Will Champion met whilst at University College London together. The band was initially called Pectoralz, and at that time was just Chris and Jonny, who had met during the university's orientation week.\n\nBassist Guy joined the group soon after, being in the same classes as the other two, and the group was renamed to Starfish in 1997 when the band would play gigs in Camden. Chris appointed his old school friend Phil Harvey to be the band's manager, and Will joined the group as percussionist - learning the drums quickly as he'd no previous experience, although he was already musically gifted. The band settled on the name Coldplay.\n\n1998 - 1999\n\nColdplay released their first EP in 1998, entitled 'Safety'. There were only 500 copies made, and only 50 of those made it into public circulation as the rest were given to record labels, and friends and family of the band. It contained tracks 'Bigger Stronger', 'No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground' and 'Such a Rush'.\n\nThe band signed to independent label Fierce Panda in December 1998, and released their first single 'Brothers & Sisters' in 1999 before signing to Parlophone.\n\n2000\n\nThe band made their Glastonbury debut in 2000, having recorded their second EP 'The Blue Room' in October 1999, spawning songs 'Don't Panic', 'See You Soon' and 'High Speed', as well as including 'Such a Rush' and 'Bigger Stronger' from the previous release. Whilst making the record, it's reported that the band fell out quite severely - but this led to them putting down ground rules, which seem to have served them well over the last 20 odd years.\n\nColdplay embarked on their first tour in June 2000, and achieved their first Top 5 single in 'Yellow', which appeared on their debut album 'Parachutes', released in July that year. The album debuted at Number 1, and was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize.\n\n2001\n\nColdplay won the BRIT Awards for Best British Group and Best British Album for 'Parachutes' in 2001 - as well as the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. At this point, Phil Harvey resigned from his role as manager due to stress, and took on the role of creative director. He's now referred to as the official fifth member of the band.\n\nColdplay began recording their second album 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head' in September 2001, and after writing 'In My Place' had a breakthrough after feeling creatively stalled. After writing more than 20 songs for the album, the track list was whittled down to the final 11.\n\n2002 - 2004\n\nThe album was released in August 2002, followed by a worldwide tour which included a slot at Glastonbury, and finished in October 2003. At the BRIT Awards 2003, Coldplay once again won Best British Group and Best British Album, as well as three awards at the MTV Video Music Awards and the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.\n\nAfter winning Record of the Year for 'Clocks' at the 2004 Grammys, Coldplay spent most of that year out of the spotlight recording their third album, 'X & Y', which was released in May 2005 and was the UK's third fastest-selling album.\n\n2005 - 2007\n\nColdplay spent 2005 to 2007 on the road, taking the 'Twisted Logic Tour' all around the world and even bringing The Verve's Richard Ashcroft onto the stage at Live 8 to sing 'Bitter Sweet Symphony'. In February 2006, they won Best Album and Best Single at the BRIT Awards, and in October that year began recording album number four: 'Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'.\n\nAfter taking a break from recording, Coldplay toured Latin America and Spain, and said that this would give the upcoming album a 'Hispanic influence'. Regarding their first three albums as a 'trilogy', Chris described 'Viva La Vida' as a new direction for the band.\n\n2008- 2012\n\n'Viva La Vida' was released in June 2008, and became the world's best-selling album of that year. EP 'Prospekt's March' followed in November, and the 'Viva la Vida Tour' also began in June. They released free album 'LeftRightLeftRightLeft', which was made up of live recordings from the tour. Taking the rest of 2009 off, Coldplay released 'Christmas Lights' in December 2010, with Chris' pal Simon Pegg starring in the music video.\n\nThe band had finished making fifth record 'Mylo Xyloto' in the summer of 2011, and also headlined Glastonbury Festival. The album was released in October 2011, receiving three Grammy nominations and two BRIT Award nominations as well as the band winning Best British Group for the third time at the 2012 awards. They performed at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Paralympic Games, and released documentary film and live album 'Coldplay Live 2012'.\n\n2013 - 2015\n\nColdplay contributed to the soundtrack for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire with 'Atlas', and released sixth album 'Ghost Stories' in May 2014 which was followed by a six-date tour of 'intimate' shows around the world. The album received two Grammy nominations, and the themes of heartbreak throughout the album were thought to reflect Chris' real-life separation from wife Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nIn December, Chris announced their upcoming seventh album 'A Head Full of Dreams' could be their last, and it was released one year later in December 2015. Prior to that, the band performed at the Global Citizen Festival, which is curated by Chris himself, at Central Park in New York.\n\n2016 - 2017\n\nIn February 2016, Coldplay headlined the Super Bowl halftime show, bringing on guests Beyonc√© Knowles-Carter and Bruno Mars. They then embarked on their 'A Head Full of Dreams Tour', with a total of 122 shows around the world. They performed at Glastonbury Festival 2016, singing a duet of 'Stayin' Alive' with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees.\n\nColdplay collaborated with EDM duo The Chainsmokers on 'Something Just Like This', released in February 2017, and they performed it together at the BRIT Awards. The 'Kaleidoscope EP' was released in July 2017, featuring the single, and was described as being a \"leftover bag of ideas\" from 'A Head Full Of Dreams'. In August, live album 'Live in Buenos Aires' was released, and the group performed at a benefit concert in Mexico, with proceeds going towards relief and aid for affected countries. They also performed at the 'One Love Manchester' benefit concert for the victims of the Manchester Arena attack.\n\n2019\n\nThankfully, Chris' prediction that 'A Head Full Of Dreams' would be their last record proved to be incorrect, as the band announced in October 2019 that their eighth album was on the way. The double album, entitled 'Everyday Life', is set to be released on 22nd November 2019, with the track listing being announced in a newspaper.\n\nThey released two singles, 'Orphans' and 'Arabesque', from the upcoming album in October 2019, with official press from the band revealing that the unusual album artwork is based on a '1919 photo of guitarist Jonny Buckland's great-grandfather's band'.\n\n2019\n\nAfter announcing they would not be touring their new album 'Everyday Life' due to environmental concerns, explaining that they're \"taking time to see how our tour can be actively beneficial,\" Coldplay gave an incredible one-off concert at the Natural History Museum in London in November 2019, which was later broadcast on Absolute Radio.\n\nThey performed underneath a 25.2-metre-long blue whale skeleton, with proceeds going to the environmental charity Client Earth. Their set-list included old classics 'Lovers In Japan', 'Fix You', 'Viva La Vida' and 'Sparks', as well as new tracks 'Daddy', 'Arabesque', 'When I Need A Friend', 'Orphans', 'Guns' and 'Everyday Life'.\n\n2021\n\nThe group released 'Higher Power' in May 2021, their first single in almost 18 months. They said of the track: ''Higher Power' is a song that arrived on a little keyboard and a bathroom sink at the start of 2020. It was produced by Max Martin who is a true wonder of the universe.'\n\nColdplay are also set to open the BRIT Awards 2021, performing from a pontoon on the River Thames.\n\n2021\n\nOn 11th May 2021, in what was their first TV performance in over a year, Coldplay opened the show at The BRIT Awards 2021. Not only did the band perform their new track 'Higher Power', but they did so from a pontoon on the Thames near The O2, along with a vibrant lights and fireworks show.\n\n2021 - 2022\n\nColdplay's album 'Music of the Spheres' was released on 15th October 2021 and the band performed an exclusive album launch show in London on 12th October.\n\nOn 14th October, they announced four UK dates for their world tour. Coldplay will be performing in the UK in August 2022, with the tour set to take place in London Wembley Stadium on Friday 12th, Saturday 13th and Tuesday 16th August and they will then perform at Glasgow Hampden Park Stadium on Tuesday 23rd August.\n\n2023\n\nIt's fair to say that Coldplay's 'Music of the Spheres Tour' took fans' breath away - with plenty of viral videos going around showing the gorgeous scenes of wristband lights filling the arena as they sing huge tracks like 'Fix You' and 'Yellow'.\n\nDue to phenomenal demand, the band delighted fans as they added extra dates to their summer UK tour in 2023! In addition to the already announced dates in May and June, Coldplay added a third date in Manchester, which took place on Saturday 3rd June, and a fourth on Sunday 4th June.\n\nBringing out special guests such as Manchester-born rapper Aitch, Coldplay also delighted the crowd as they performed a cover of James' 'Sit Down'.\n\n2023\n\nColdplay set off on the 'Music Of The Spheres Tour' on a mission to reduce their direct carbon emissions by 50%, and in June 2023 they revealed the emissions data from the first 12 months of the tour. They wrote: 'The emissions data from the first 12 months of the tour has now been collated, assessed and independently validated by Prof. John E. Fernandez of the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative.\n\n'On a show-by-show comparison, the Music Of The Spheres Tour has so far produced 47% less CO2e emissions than our last stadium tour (2016-17). This is a good start - and something that our incredible crew should be very proud of - but clearly there's still room for improvement.\n\n'Now that we're into the second year of the tour, we've started to run the entire show (audio, lights, lasers etc) from an electric battery system that allows us to use 100% renewable energy as efficiently as possible. We have been using electric vehicles and alternative fuels wherever we can, as well as reducing waste and plastic usage to a minimum.'\n\nThe band went on to thank their fans, as well as all of the 'brilliant' and 'creative' minds that have helped them so far."
