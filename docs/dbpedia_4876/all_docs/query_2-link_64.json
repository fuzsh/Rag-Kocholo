        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nOn this day in 2003, during a concert in London, England, Natalie Maines, lead singer of the Dixie Chicks (now known simply as The Chicks), said that the band was \"ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas\". This was during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, and the comment sparked intense controversy and outrage among Americans, including a large share of country music fans. The Dixie Chicks were blacklisted by thousands of country radio stations, and the band members received death threats. The backlash also damaged sales of their next album and tour.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1956 - Elvis Presley was proclaimed \"the new singing rage\" by RCA Victor Records in a half-page spread in Billboard magazine.\n\n1964 - Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel recorded the acoustic version of \"The Sound of Silence.\" Later, the record company would add electric guitar, bass and drums, without the knowledge of either performer, and release the song as a single. The single reached number one on New Year's Day 1966 and was included in the 1966 album Sounds of Silence. The song was also used by Mike Nichols in the 1967 film, The Graduate, alongside \"Mrs. Robinson.\"\n\n1977 - The Sex Pistols inked a contract with A&M Records on a little table that was set up in London near Buckingham Palace. The contract lasted for six days.\n\n1979 - James Brown played at the Grand Ole Opry.\n\n1988 - Younger brother of The Bee Gees, Andy Gibb died in the hospital. His death from myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) followed a long battle with cocaine addiction, which had weakened his heart.\n\n2000 - Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde was arrested for leading an animal rights protest against Gap, who was accused of using leather from cows \"slaughtered illegally and cruelly\". The protest took place in a store in Manhattan.\n\n2003 - Johnny Cash was admitted to Baptist Hospital in Nashville, Tenn., to undergo treatment for pneumonia.\n\n2009 - Tickets for a one-off gig by Paul McCartney in Las Vegas sold out seven seconds after going on sale. The former Beatle was booked to perform at the opening of the New Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino on April 19 for 4,000 fans. Tickets were $750 each.\n\n2010 - Pink Floyd won a court battle with EMI that prevented the record company from selling single downloads and ringtones on the Internet from the group's albums. Pink Floyd's back catalogue was second only in sales to The Beatles.\n\n2015 - A jury awards Marvin Gaye's estate (his children Marvin III, Frankie and Nona) $7.3 million, finding that the Robin Thicke song \"Blurred Lines\" is too similar to Gaye's 1977 hit \"Got To Give It Up.\"\n\n2017 - Singer/songwriter, actress and producer Joni Sledge died from natural causes at age 60. She was best-known as a founding member of Sister Sledge, who were known for their hits \"We Are Family\" and \"He's The Greatest Dancer\".\n\n2019 - Guitarist, singer, and songwriter Asa Brebner died at age 65. He was a member of The Modern Lovers, led by Jonathan Richman. They are best-known for their 1976 hit \"Roadrunner\" which Rolling Stone ranked No. 274 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n2021 - Mariah Carey files an application to trademark the phrase \"Queen Of Christmas.\"\n\nBirthdays:\n\nEdie Arlisa Brickell was born on this day in 1966, making her 56 today. She is a singer-songwriter best-known for her band Edie Brickell & New Bohemians.\n\nTom Scholz of Boston is 76.\n\nGary Louris is 68.\n\nPearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament is 60.\n\nProducer Rick Rubin is 60.\n\nNeneh Cherry is 59.\n\nDave Krusen, former drummer of Pearl Jam and Candlebox, is 57.\n\nProducer Timbaland (Timothy Z. Mosley) is 51.\n\nCarrie Underwood is 40."
