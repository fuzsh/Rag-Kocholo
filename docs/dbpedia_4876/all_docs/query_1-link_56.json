        "text": "Jason Reitman’s upcoming biopic about the start of Saturday Night Live is beginning to be teased across the internet, and although it’s very exciting to see pictures of the actors playing Lorne Michaels and Garrett Morris and Jane Curtin, it’s so much more important to see what they’re going to do with Jim Henson.\n\nAs you know, Jim Henson and the Muppets appeared throughout the first season of Saturday Night Live with their strange “Land of Gortch” sketches, making them a present – if not integral – part of SNL history.\n\nThanks to Vanity Fair, we now have a bunch of new photos, and Jim is included among them. Take a gander at our first peek at Jim below.\n\nAnd there he is! Portrayed here by Nicholas Braun (who, for some reason, is also playing Andy Kaufman… and possibly others?), and seen alongside King Ploobis from “The Land of Gortch”.\n\nWe’re holding out hope for more photos coming soon, including Frank Oz, Bernie Brillstein, and the rest of the Gortch cast, all of whom we’re presuming will appear in the film as well.\n\nSaturday Night (previously titled “SNL 1975”) will be released on October 11, 2024, at which time we’ll see what this Jim Henson guy can really do.\n\nClick here to return to Gortch on the ToughPigs Discord!"
