        "text": "Paramount Pictures began humbly in 1912 when Adolph Zukor, the owner of a New York nickelodeon, released the first full-length drama shown in the United States (Queen Elizabeth, starring Sarah Bernhardt) and founded the Famous Players Film Company. A year later, Zukor began distributing his films through a start-up company called Paramount Pictures.\n\nIn 1916, Zukorâs Famous Players merged with The Jesse L. Lasky Company, which was producing films in Hollywood (including the first feature-length film ever produced in Hollywood â The Squaw Man) and also using Paramount Pictures as a distributor. The newly formed Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, soon consolidated with the distribution company (in which Zukor was a major stockholder) and all three companies became what you now know as Paramount Pictures.\n\nAfter the merger, audiences first began seeing the iconic logo with the mountain and stars, which was created by Paramount (the distribution company) founder W. W. Hodkinson. Hodkinson had borrowed the Paramount name from an apartment house that he frequently passed in his neighborhood. A mountain peak he remembered from his childhood in Utah inspired the logo, which he designed. Legend has it that the stars surrounding the mountain represented the original 22 film stars Hodkinson had under contract. Another implication was that Paramount had more stars than there were in the universe.\n\nIn 1926, Lasky supervised the construction of a new Hollywood studio, which was the foundation of the Paramount Pictures studio lot today. The original studio, which cost $1 million to build, stood on a 26-acre lot and contained four large sound stages.\n\nIt only took a year after moving onto our current studio lot for Paramountâs success to become evident. In 1927, Paramount received the very first Academy Award for Best Picture with its release of Wings, a silent movie about World War I fighter pilots. In addition, Wings is the only silent film in movie history to win that award.\n\nThere was no looking back after that.\n\nMemorable Movies (1912-1929)\n\nâ¢ The Sheik (1921)\n\nâ¢ Wings (1927, Winner of the 1st\n\nAcademy Award for Best Picture)\n\nâ¢ Interference (1928, Paramount's 1st All Talkie)\n\nâ¢ Coconuts (1929)\n\nFamous Stars (1912-1929)\n\nâ¢ Cecil B. DeMille\n\nâ¢ Mary Pickford\n\nâ¢ Clara Bow\n\nâ¢ Douglas Fairbanks\n\nâ¢ Gloria Swanson\n\nâ¢ Rudolph Valentino\n\nThe 30s through the mid-50s proved to be an immensely successful period for Paramount. Many of the classics weâve all come to know and love were created during this time. In the midst of the Great Depression, the memorable Bing Crosby musicals, Cecil B. DeMille spectacles and the outrageous comedies of Mae West were all created.\n\nThroughout our history, Paramount has nurtured and aided the industryâs most legendary movie talent. From the earliest years and through the 1930s, actors and actresses were more like professional football players of today. They were contracted by the different studios to only appear in each particular studioâs movies. They were also traded back and forth for particular productions between studios. (In more recent times, actors, directors and other talent now have the freedom to work on any production they wish, with any studio.)\n\nDuring the mid to late 40s, the critical acclaim of films from Paramount also became prominent. In 1944, Paramount won its second Academy Award for Best Picture for Going My Way. The very next year, The Lost Weekend took the top prize. Throughout the early 50s, Paramount dominated the Academy Award nominee lists with enduring classics, including Sunset Boulevard, The Greatest Show on Earth (1952 Academy Winner), Shane, The Rose Tattoo and DeMilleâs remake of The Ten Commandments.\n\nMemorable Movies (1930-1959)\n\nâ¢ Bob Hope & Bing Crosby\n\nâRoadâ Series (1940-1962)\n\nâ¢ Going My Way (1944)\n\nâ¢ Sunset Boulevard (1950)\n\nâ¢ The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)\n\nâ¢ White Christmas (1954)\n\nâ¢ The Ten Commandments (1956)\n\nFamous Stars (1930-1959)\n\nâ¢ Cecil B.
