First Look Studios was a former American independent film distributor, that specialized in home video releases of films and television series.

First Look Pictures was formed in 1993 as the North American distribution unit of Overseas Filmgroup, a Los Angeles-based film company that was established in 1980. In January 2001, as part of a restructuring, the companies formed a holding company known as First Look Media (not to be confused with the news organization of the same name). In July 2005, First Look Media merged with Capital Entertainment into First Look Studios, which Nu Image acquired a majority stake in in March 2007. In November 2010, First Look went bankrupt; sister company Millennium Films acquired its film library and assets afterwards, reorganizing it as their distribution company.
