In fact, he shunned material things as his slogan was service to humanity.\n\n“There was a time he said to me that ‘Turai, I pity you because when I die you will have quarrels with my relatives because they will think I have so much money in my possession”, she said.\n\nShe said the situation in Nigeria would have been better had the late president survived his ailment because he was a “focused, committed and determined leader”.\n\nClick to signup for FREE news updates, latest information and hottest gists everyday\n\nAdvertise on NigerianEye.com to reach thousands of our daily users"
