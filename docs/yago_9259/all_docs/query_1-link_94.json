Tonight, we remember and honor President Yar’Adua’s profound personal decency and integrity, his deep commitment to public service, and his passionate belief in the vast potential and bright future of Nigeria’s 150 million people.\n\nPresident Yar’Adua worked to promote peace and stability in Africa through his support of Nigerian peacekeeping efforts as well as his strong criticism of undemocratic actions in the region. He was committed to creating lasting peace and prosperity within Nigeria’s own borders, and continuing that work will be an important part of honoring his legacy.\n\nUnder President Yar’Adua’s leadership, Nigeria and the United States took steps to deepen the strong bilateral relationship between our two nations and that work has continued even in recent months when President Yar’Adua’s illness forced him to step back from his governing duties. The Nigerian people and government should know that in this time of national mourning they have a friend and enduring partner in the United States and that together we will continue to work to address the common challenges we face.”"
