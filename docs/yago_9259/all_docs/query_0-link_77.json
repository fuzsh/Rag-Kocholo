        "text": "Born on August 16, 1951 in an aristocratic Fulani family of a former governor of Lagos state, his early education started at Rafukka Primary School and later he joined Dutsinma Boarding Primary School. He went to Ahmadu Bello University from 1972 to 1975, earned a BSc in Education and Chemistry there, and then returned in 1978 to acquire an MSc Degree in Analytical Chemistry.\n\nYar'Adua became the governor of northern Katsina State after joining the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from a Leftist political background.\n\nThe late president, who took over the reins from Olusegun Obasanjo in 2007, was not seen in public following his illness since November 2009.\n\nOn his inauguration, he had promised a lot of reforms including changing the electoral system which was considered as highly-flawed. He had also vowed to fight corruption and fight poor power supply in Africa's foremost oil producing nation where politicians are known for their corruption.\n\nYar'Adua articulated all these in a seven-point agenda which he was yet to complete before disappearing from public view. The late president succeeded in quelling the raging rebel onslaught in the Niger Delta region by granting blanket amnesty to the fighting members and promising rehabilitation."
