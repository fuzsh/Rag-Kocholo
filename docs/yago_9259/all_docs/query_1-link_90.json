        "text": "Olusegun Adeniyi said that Mr Yar'Adua, who had a history of kidney problems, died Wednesday night at the Aso Rock presidential villa.\n\nMr Yar'Adua, a former chemistry teacher elected in May 2007, had not been seen in public since last November since he flew to Saudi Arabia to be treated for heart trouble. He was diagnosed with acute pericarditis, an inflammation of the membrane around the heart.\n\nIn January, reports surfaced that he was \"seriously brain-damaged\" following medical treatment. Earlier this month, senior Nigerian clerics claimed they met the ailing president, saying he had difficulty speaking."
