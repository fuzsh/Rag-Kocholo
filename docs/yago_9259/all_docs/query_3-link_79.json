        "text": "… As Erekosima Warns Tinubu\n\nPresident of the Foundation for Peace and Non-Violence (FOFPEN), Mr Onengiya Erekosima presenting the award to a representative of Yar’Adua family at the event held at Silverbird Galleria in FCT, Abuja.\n\nBy Anthony Okechukwu\n\nLate President Umaru Musa Yar’Ardua whose Amnesty Policy brought an end to militancy in Nigeria’s South-south region has been given a post-humous award for his role in changing that frightening era in the country’s history.\n\nHis widow, Hajiya Turai Yar’Ardua was also among several other Nigerians who received awards for their roles in promoting non-violent approach to the resolution of Nigeria’s multi-faceted and growing security challenges.\n\nThe awards were presented to them by President of the Foundation for Peace and Non-Violence (FOFPEN), Mr Onengiya Erekosima at the 15th anniversary of the Foundation held on Saturday 27th January 2024, at the Silverbird Galleria in Abuja.\n\nThe anniversary, with the theme: “Remaking Nigeria Through Non-Violence”, attracted dignitaries from all over the country.\n\nOther recipients of the Foundation’s award were the DG Nigerian Institute of Animal Science, Prof Eustace Iyayi, Rtd AIG, Barr Felix Ogbaudu, Rtd AIG Hassan Karma, former Deputy Speaker of the House of representatives Chief Austin Adiele Opara, Chief (Barr) Samuel Nwosu, ace journalist Mohammed Bello; owner of Human Rights Radio (Brekete) Dr Ahmad Isah; Alabo Nengi James, Chief Samuel Tuta Pukat and Claire Adelabu Abdulrazak.\n\nAlso honoured were award-winning journalist and one-time editor of Zest Traveller magazine, a stablemate of True Vision, Mr. Anthony Awunor, Amb. Kingsley Amafibe, Comrade Dogo Shagari Ejeke, Soni Daniel, Anayochukwu Agbo, Omoaefe Ejere.\n\nSome of the guests, awardees and members of the Foundation shared their views on the occasion, stating that the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu should listen to Erekosima who had earlier assisted to stop the activities of Niger Delta militants\n\nSpeaking at the occasion, Erekosima warned President Bola Tinubu that if the Yar’Ardua non-violent approach was not adopted urgently to arrest the widespread insecurity, the situation could degenerate to guerilla warfare.\n\nErekosima fingered lack of political will, duplicity of those benefitting from security votes, poverty and frustration as the catalysts for the nationwide upsurge in insecurity.\n\nHe therefore, called on President Tinubu who he acknowledged had previously supported his non-violent approach to muster the political will to do the needful before the onset of guerilla war.\n\nUmaru Musa Yar’Adua GCFR, was a Nigerian politician who served as the president of Nigeria from 2007 to 2010. He was declared the winner of the Nigerian presidential election held on 21 April 2007, and was sworn in on 29 May 2007.\n\nUnder Yar’Adua, Nigeria’s oil-rich Niger Delta became increasingly militarized and insecure. Scores of civilians were murdered by armed gangs and security forces in 2007, and the violence further impeded the impoverished region’s development.\n\nWith a dint of hardwork and commitment, Yar’Adua brought lasting peace into the Niger Delta through his Amnesty Programme.\n\nTurai Umar Musa Yar’Adua is the widow of the former Nigerian president and former Katsina State Governor, Umaru Musa Yar’Adua. She was the First Lady of Nigeria from 2007 until the death of her husband on 5 May 2010."
