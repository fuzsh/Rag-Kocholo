        "text": "Former President Umaru Musa Yar’adua was described by Nigerians as one of the best Presidents we have had in this country, however, his health did not allow him to rule the country for long.\n\nPresident Umaru Musa Yar’Adua ruled the Federal Republic of Nigeria as the 13th president and was identified by many as the right leader for the country.\n\nHowever, the wife of the former president, Turai Yar’adua has revealed what may have been some of the last words of her husband to her before his death.\n\nShe noted that the ex-president told her that his family members might want to fight with her after his death due to a belief that he has many properties and a huge stack of money.\n\nThe former first lady who spoke some years back at a memorial lecture in honour of the late president in Katsina said “the late Yar’adua was not a materialist leader who believed in accumulating wealth. In fact, he shunned material things as his slogan was service to humanity.\n\n“There was a time he said to me that ‘Turai, I pity you because when I die you will have quarrels with my relatives because they will think I have so much money in my possession“, she said.\n\nThe former first lady added that the country would have developed if the former president did not die.\n\nShe added that the former President takes time to monitor every project he approves. We pray that his soul rests in peace."
