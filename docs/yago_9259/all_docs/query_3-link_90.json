He was Chairman, Nation House Press Ltd, Kaduna from 1995-1999. Yar’Adua foray into party politics began as a Lecturer when he became an active member and mobilizer for the defunct Peoples’ Redemption Party (PRP). During the Transition Programme of President Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, Yar’Adua was one of the foundation members of the Peoples’ Front, a political association under the leadership of his elder brother, the late Major-General Shehu Musa Yar’Adua. That association later fused to form the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Yar’Adua was a member of the 1988 Constituent Assembly.

Governor Yar’Adua is best remembered as the first Governor to publicly declare his assets and has promised to do same again at the end of his tenure. During his tenure as Governor, the state passed through an unprecedented development, culminating into profoundly transformation of the educational and health institutions, provision of rural and urban roads, electrification, water supply and agriculture. In the year 2000, he became the fifth northern Nigerian state governor to adopt sharia, or Islamic law. In 2002 Amina Lawal, a woman from Katsina was sentenced to death by stoning by a sharia court in the town of Bakori for committing adultery; the story attracted international attention. Her sentence was at first upheld by a court in the town of Funtua, and then overturned a year later following an appeal.
