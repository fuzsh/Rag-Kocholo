        "text": "His presidential victory was controversial: not only was he the nominee of the outgoing Obasanjo and considered by many to be his puppet, but also the election, in which Yar'Adua had swept to power with 70 per cent of the poll, had been marked by allegations of rigging and gross fraud.\n\nYar'Adua was a Muslim, and in 2000, as governor of the northern Nigerian state of Katsina, had introduced sharia law to his fiefdom. When a sharia court sentenced a local woman to death by stoning for committing adultery, the story attracted headlines around the world and her sentence was overturned on appeal. But overall, Yar'Adua's gubernatorial record was flawless, and he remained untainted by the usual whiff of corruption.\n\nAs president, his claim to transparency even extended to fulfilling a promise – made during the campaign – to disclose the size of his financial assets, by way of an example to other Nigerian politicians. These were said to amount to some $5 million, or £2.5 million.\n\nHis principal problem was his health: Yar'Adua suffered from a chronic kidney condition, and during the run-up to his presidential bid in early 2007 rumours circulated that he had collapsed with a heart attack. Although he had flown to Germany for treatment, his office attributed his medical problems to stress; and Yar'Adua himself dismissed the speculation and, in an attempt to silence his critics, challenged his critics to a game of squash.\n\nThe rumours multiplied, however, in November 2009 when he was flown to a clinic in Saudi Arabia for treatment for pericarditis, an inflammation of the membrane around the heart. By February 2010 the country was languishing in a dangerous power vacuum, and the Nigerian senate transferred presidential powers to Yar'Adua's deputy, Goodluck Jonathan, pending the president's full return to health. A fortnight later Yar'Adua flew back to Abuja.\n\nUmaru Musa Yar'Adua was born on August 16 1951 in the northern Nigerian state of Katsina, into an aristocratic family of the Fulani tribe. His father had been a post-independence minister for Lagos, and Umaru inherited his royal title of Mutawellen (custodian of the treasury) of the Katsina emirate.\n\nAfter various lecturing jobs, Yar'Adua worked as general manager of a farm business and held several company directorships and chairmanships throughout the 1990s. Having declared himself a Marxist at university, he subsequently joined the People's Front, then led by his elder brother Shehu. The People's Front later merged with other groups to form the Social Democratic Party (SDP), with Yar'Adua earning a reputation as a formidable grassroots activist and campaigner.\n\nHaving failed in an attempt to be elected governor of Katsina, in 1998 he founded the K34 Party (Katsina state has 34 local administrations); this in turn merged with the People's Democratic Party (PDP), and in 1999 Yar'Adua successfully ran for the state governorship, a post in which he proved remarkably successful.\n\nAlthough re-elected in 2003, Yar'Adua found himself the object of scrutiny by observers from Europe and the United States, who reported voting irregularities and declared his victory fraudulent. Nevertheless, he was chosen as the PDP’s presidential candidate in 2007 to succeed Obasanjo as Nigeria’s 13th president, and he swept the primary elections. Yar'Adua duly nominated Goodluck Jonathan, the university-educated governor of the Niger Delta state of Bayelsa, as his running mate.\n\nAlthough he claimed 70 per cent of the votes cast in the elections in April 2007, Yar'Adua again faced allegations of fraud, although he was not held personally responsible. In his inaugural address he said: \"We acknowledge that our elections were not perfect and had lapses and shortcomings. I also believe that our experiences represent an opportunity to learn from our mistakes.\"\n\nHe proceeded to appoint a cabinet, installing himself as energy minister to oversee the country's massive oil reserves. Oil has been Nigeria's main export since the 1970s and has brought the country enormous wealth; but huge areas remain gripped by extreme poverty, and militants have kidnapped foreign oil workers and bombed installations. There have also been violent clashes between Christians and Muslims."
