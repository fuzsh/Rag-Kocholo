        "text": "Irrespective of what is said about Yar adua, I think he was a fine gentleman with strong passion to live and make a mark.\n\nHe was transparent enough to declare his asset, which most of his successors refused to do. He had great heart to pursue justice, moral uprightness.\n\nDespite his failing health, he strived to achieve, maximize the use of his personal potentials which many are afraid of. He disallowed health challenges to stop his vision.\n\nIn terms of policy achievement, he might have been slow as Nigerians would have expected more.In summary, he did his best even though that might not have been all Nigerians expected.\n\nIt is a Sad day and also a sad thing to happen in the life of a Nation and to the family of the departed.\n\nYar adua has been above board amongst his peers in all standards and he his a man without reproach even from opponents.\n\nHe was not willing to cling to power at all cost even when people that surrounds him and the ones he surround himself with are ready to do all for him to remain in power.\n\nThis may have been avoided has the former leader listen to the voice of reasoning from many quarters that the man to be saddled with the affairs of the nation must be well in all aspect to be able to cope with the stress of the office he refused.\n\nMedical test should be one of the requisite for contesting for any office in Nigeria as it is in entering most employments.\n\nThe Nation should move forward and not hang on any one man no matter the formal status.\n\nYar Adua is not the first Nigerian president to die on the throne (1) Aguyi Ironsi (2) Murtala Mohammed (3) Sani Abacha and now (4) Yar Adua!!! 2 things are on my mind: (1) we have to be very careful in selecting the VP who may run in 2011, (2) whoever is contesting in 2011 should be properly checked (medical)… if not these list will keep increasing more and more!!! & my question is; who should be the next VP?\n\nHeartfelt condolences to the family of our late president elect- President Umaru Yar'Adua.\n\nTo Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan, Congratulations on your post as new head of state!! Wisdom from Persident Abraham Lincoln :\n\nLet the people know the truth and the country is safe.\n\nI am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts.\n\nPublic opinion in this country is everything!!!\n\nAnd to Citizens of The Federal Republic of Nigeria:\n\nAsk not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy\n\nPeace at last to this good man!\n\nMr. Yar'Adua has not been well since he took office, like the office was too much for him, or too much for those who disliked his policies, or maybe his religion. Then suddenly, he’s gone, gone to Arabia. There follows total silence for month after month.\n\nMr.Yar'Adua came to power in 2007 holding forth reforms, acting against corruption, and hoping to redesign the electoral system, but it was the Delta where he made the biggest difference: amnesty to the rebels.\n\nHere was a man whose time was wrong for Africa, at least the exploitive, oil-seeking greedy sort.\n\nMr Yar'Adua is dead.\n\nAmong early callers were\n\n- the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Dimeji Bankole;\n\n- Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Paul Dike;\n\n- Peoples Democratic Party National Chairman, Chief Vincent Ogbulafor…\n\nSecurity was tight in the Presidential Villa. State House correspondents were not allowed to go to the complex. Journalists were only allowed to get into Aguda House, the official residence of the Acting President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nMr. Yar'Adua will go home, back to Katsina State.\n\nGoodluck Jonathan has the power. The Christian South has the power.\n\nMr. Yar'Adua’s former ministers such as:\n\n- former Agriculture and Water Resources Minister, Dr. Sayyadi Abba-Ruma;\n\n- former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Senator Adamu Aliero –\n\nall Mr Yar'Adua’s best Ministers have been ousted. This happened when Goodluch Jonathan assumed power. Also dropped were\n\n- ex-Petroleum Resources Minister, Dr. Rilwan Lukman; and\n\n- ex-finance minister, Dr. Mansur Muhtar.\n\nNigeria ia almost back to that point from which Mr Yar'Adua wanted to move her forward. A good man too soon gone for some, a bit late for others.\n\nDeath is a painful event and we all pray that God will gives the Yar’Adua’s family the fortitude to bear their loss. But, at the same time the rest of Nigeria heaves with a sign of relief that at last they opened up (Turai Yar’Adua and the cabal). I can’t truly recall any legacy that Yar’Adua will be remembered for, not with the way the issue of his health was handled. I believe that has rubbished any achievements he might have made while in office and to Turai thank you for giving up. The days of your(Turai) clever manoeuvre is over.\n\n\"...Yar Adua is not the first Nigerian president to die on the throne (1) Aguyi Ironsi (2) Murtala Mohammed (3) Sani Abacha and now (4) Yar Adua!!! 2 things are on my mind: (1) we have to be very careful in selecting the VP who may run in 2011, (2) whoever is contesting in 2011 should be properly checked (medical)… if not these list will keep increasing more and more!!!....\"\n\nI thought Aguyi Ironsi and Murtala Mohammed did not exactly die of 'natural causes' but were actually killed during coup attempts.\n\nAnyway, my main hope is that things will remain peacful and not disintegrate into mindless violence. Nigeria really needs peace at this time.\n\nPresident Olusegun Obasanjo knew before hand that Yardua was not healthy but he handpicked him for presidency because he (Obasanjo) wants him (Yardua) to continue using him for his self agenda which would not be in the interest of Nigerians. So here comes the setback. Now the vice president, who is from the East, among the peolple whom Obasanjo did not want to see taking power in the country will be the president until elections is held. You see, if you try to sideline others, God intervenes in another way. It is a lession for you Nigerians, otherwise your country will not be better aheat.\n\nJames Deng Dimo\n\nFrom Wau South Sudan.\n\nthey took him too far, let him be they dont want, let him peacefully resign and go and take care of himself they said no, even the wife insisted, now see he letf in death.his a strong man shar,cos me i never thought he could stay this long when he won in 2007, but he tried.what am concine now is were he will be,do they said he is peaceful,cand,humble,have the heart of the nation,a good leader,so on and so fort,but let me read the bible to u,go to john 3v3,jesue said,essept a man be born again,he can not SEE the kingdom of GOD(HANLA).I pray he is in his religion,he will see no rest,no matter the billions of people in the world that will wish him rest,if he is not born again. it aply to all that will read this note, if yau a president will die,they who will not,the most impotantly is to die knowing that u will have inter rest. UMARU as obj call him, sleep well,now the northans PDP will live u in peace,if they still dont want u to be,invit them over,is alowed there.\n\nPresident Olusegun Obasanjo knew before hand that Yardua was not healthy but he handpicked him for presidency because he (Obasanjo) wants him (Yardua) to continue using him for his self agenda which would not be in the interest of Nigerians. So here comes the setback. Now the vice president, who is from the East, among the peolple whom Obasanjo did not want to see taking power in the country will be the president until elections is held. You see, if you try to sideline others, God intervenes in another way. It is a lession for you Nigerians, otherwise your Country will not be better.\n\nJames Deng Dimo\n\nFrom Wau South Sudan.\n\nPresident Olusegun Obasanjo knew before hand that Yardua was not healthy but he handpicked him for presidency because he (Obasanjo) wants him (Yardua) to continue using him for his self agenda which would not be in the interest of Nigerians.

You see, if you try to sideline others, God intervenes in another way. It is a lession for you Nigerians.\n\nThe emergence of Goodluck Jonathan as President and commander in chief is a clear justice done by God because power belongs to Him alone. It was the late Ken Sarowiwa who said that ‘Niger delta is like the golden hen that lays the egg others are using for breakfast’. Yaradua in his 7 point agenda included this region, but nobody knows the weight of a shoe more than the person wearing it. Today a son of that ‘hen’ is commanding and I see the hand of God in the crisis our country has been facing lately just to balance the equation. Sometimes when our life is shaking, we run to God to ask why our life is shaking, without knowing that God indeed is the one doing the shaking. God is gradually restructuring this country for good, but in a very mysterious way no man can understand.\n\nThis is a reminder that whatever we live for thereafter live after us while we have gone. I just hope the World and African leaders (in particular) have a lesson to learn from this gentleman's demise. The likes of former AGF (Mr Anodoaka), former first lady Hajia Turai, former President Obasanjo and a host of other members of the cabal should be made to answer some questions on their role towards the early passage of our darling 'serious but incapacitated' President to the great beyond. I suspect they now must have accomplished their mission. Posterity awaits everyone. Adieu! Mr Yaradua.\n\nPerhaps a good place to start is to thank God that the theatre of absurb that played out in the last few months has come to an end -unfortunately, tragically! My condolences go to the immediate family members of the good man, Mr. Yar'Adua. The job managing a family when one is healthy is difficult enough. How much more trying to rule a nation as complicated and diverse as Nigeria with ill-health! One would never under why Late President Yar'Adua agreed to take this kind of job. It is more stressful than managing English Premiership Club struggling to get out of relegation. Now we know the amount of energy required to govern Nigeria, in future all presidential aspirants must be made to run a clear 2 kilometres as part of their physical fitness. I feel very sad, deeply saddened that we just lost yet another good person as a result of unneccessary political immaturity engineered by foes who pretend to be friends.\n\nMay his sould rest in peace. He had a good personality and integrity but was weak as a president as he unwittingly allowed some politicians to hijack his government by using law enforcement agencies to terrorise their private opposition for personal gains.\n\nHe was peace loving and would definitely have frowned at the way his immediate family and close political associates tried to use his illness for political gain if he was conscious.\n\nHe probably would not have sought a re-election except pushed by his associates as he was known not to be power hungry.\n\nThe late President’s life was an exemplary example for other Nigerians to follow in his footsteps of sincerity, especially those in power now. Quite unfortunate, his untimely death has brought a very big loophole or vacuum of sincere leadership role in this country. Mr. Yar’Adua, a man who believed in honesty and integrity as a necessary ingredient for good leadership. Which most Nigeria leaders ranging from local government councilors to the executive arms of Nigeria Government lacks. My sincere condolence to the late Mr. Yar’Adua’s family may his soul rest in perfect in the hands of Allah (God).\n\nHis legacy to all Nigerians and the world at large was his honesty, fairness, sincerity to solve problems that matter so much to his people. Most importantly, his reconciliatory tone for peace and atonement for his people, it doesn’t matter whether you’re northerners or southerners.His principle remained the same for all. My only candid message to Nigeria leaders, stop corrupt practices, allow all Nigerians to elect you, don’t appoint yourself to electoral offices by stealing votes. There’s so much joy of serving and building your community. Nigeria could be US tomorrow if you’re ready to serve with integrity and do the work you’re elected for, instead of stealing money. Have the fear of God in your hearts as you serve your motherland…NIGERIA. God bless Nigerians and the land we cherished so much.\n\nTo Goodluck, God has always favoured you such golden opportunity, you must serve to reform and redeem Nigeria image. You must hold anybody accountable for their wrong deeds. God blesses and guides you as you take the leadership role of the country. Let the fear of God be your guiding principles as rule this great nation a land of opportunities. May God help you.\n\nMy prayer for the family is for strength and fortitude to bear this great loss. A loss of this magnitude is a loss to the nation, and his lingering illness was a set-back of monumental proportion to Nigeria.\n\nYaradua will be remembered for well-meaning intentions for Nigeria which the cold hand of death has twerminated.\n\nNow we must put the past behind us and work assiduously to concretize his vision of a better Nigeria. President Goodluck Jonathan must now exercise the full right of leadership and get the nation out of the precipice of decay. He must marshall all forces to move the nation forward. He must do all within his power to tame the monster of corruption; harness the vast but redundant potentials of Nigerians for progress and prosperity. He must provide the base for sustainable development. He needs moral rectitude and tenacity of courage to do this. We have stayed \"too long on this side of Jordan\", we need to move forward!\n\nI have repectful memories of late President Umaru Yar'Adua of Nigeria. He was the cleanest and most incorruptible leader Nigeria had in recent times. As the President he was the supreme adinistrator.But he had utmost regard for transparency and accountability in govrnance as is evident from his declaration of wealth after assumption of office as President.This is a rare example in corruption-ridden developing countries of Asia and Africa.It is not for nothing that the Acting President Goodluck Jonathan has called him the jewel in Nigeria's crown. President Yaru'Adua was a peace-maker.In the strife-torn country that Nigeria is, he will be remembered for ever in Nigeria for bringing the rebels in Niger delta to the fold of peace by granting them amnesty. But for his death due to long illness, he could have implemented his reform programmes and changed the face of Nigeria.\n\nPresident Umaru Yar'Adua is dead. Long live Umaru Yar'Adua!\n\nIt's a pity that a man of dignity just died like that, this man have so many things to fulfil like 7 point Agenda, fighting against corruption, fulfilling his promise in rural area but, they did not let this man to fulfil all this promise. His aman of boldness, a man that is ready to fulfil all human wants, a man that want peace of the nation, a man that is willing to do his best for the Country. May his soul rest in perfect peace. R.I.P. Mr. President. My consolation go to his Family.\n\nSincere condolences to the Yardua family.\n\nWhy it makes sense for Jonathan to run - Why much has been said about the rightness or otherwise of President Jonathan contesting next year's election in view of the rotation agreement in the ruling party, no mention has been made of the spirit and intent behind the agreement.\n\nThe agreement to rotate power between north and south came up as a result of the peculiar circumstances the nation found itself in 1998/1999 and it was entirely to ensure the abatement of the feeling of northern hegemony and give other parts of the country a sense of belonging in the Nigerian enterprise. I truly believe that the present circumstances lends itself to the spirit and intent behind the rotation agreement as it presents the south-south region what is rightly a once in a generation opportunity to preside over the Nigerian nation.\n\nTo deny the region the auspicious opportunity based on the agreement can only re-enact the feeling of alienation and detachment for the south-south and reinforce the malaise it is meant to cure. Afterall the north has had several shorts at the presidency.\n\nIts quite unfortunately that such a good soul has passed on, but this brings a lesson to mind about African Politics. Ex-president Obasanjo try puttin in someone who mite cover his prior mis-governance and gross corruption without thinking on the influence it might to the Country at large. As can be seen over africa, most leaders are now grooming their sons and relatives to take over after them like a dynasty. Its bout time African leaders accept the full meaning of Democracy and the electoral process.\n\nMy deepest condolence to the people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nMy president lives on.Today is one of my saddest days.It bequeaths the reality of a world of betrayal and sycophancy.In the circle of the Nigeria morals and truth, Umaru musa yardua will be remembered.He is a sacrificial lamb for this country having to gamble his health for us Nigerians.He is better than all the Nigerian leaders who have plugged this nation into penury and considered their self interest before the Nation's.Though a Muslim, he saw himself as the father of all.The truth and humility seen in him is the greatest treasure to me .This places him in the hall of the greatest.\n\nWith a trait towards religion and ethnicity and corruption, there are those who would be happy about his death but death would come to all of us.Umaru is happy wherever he is because he has done his best and had very good intentions for Nigeria.\n\nBravo to my hero. 92 gun salutes to you, my president. Your legacy lives on.Rest in peace.\n\nThe death of President Yaradua is a divine providence towards restoring our lost consciousness of \"love, peace and unity\" that is expressed in our coat of arm. Nigerians should see his death as a sacrifice and an indemnity condition towards leading us to the zenith of our universal providence, as the Giant of Africa, not in size but in responsibility. Nigeria should not only mourn the death of Yaradua but also the dilapidation of our national monuments such as \"love, peace and unity\", by declaring 1st October of this year as a day of national morning and not a day of celebration. That for 50 years after independence we still lack basic infrastructures like: steady power, good hospitals, roads and good economy, simply as a result of the vices of corruption and egocentrism, despite her vast natural and human resources. Simply put, we as a nation have lost our vision and national consciousness. What a shame! If we do not unite to restore our nation now. In all Yaradua was a noble man, may his soul rest in peace.\n\nMy sincere and heartfelt condolences go to the Yaradua family as an entity, as well as all fellow Nigerians as we mourn the demise of President Umaru Yaradua, the second in that family that gave selfless and remarkable impetus to public service, after their late father who was a Minister in Balewa Administration (Minister of Lagos Affairs)-1964.\n\nThe travails of his administration, shortlived due to illhealth, and the political intransigencies surrounding his death remind everyone that death is the inescapable fact of end-of-life, which ultimately will come one way or another, ultimate and absolute power belong to Almighty God, afterall. On this note, we ask that God should give us all the fortitude to bear the loss, and allow his gentle soul to rest in perfect peace, as as we mourn let us also remember all the principles and values such as integrity, humility and unparalleled dignity, the man, Umaru brought to the highest office in our land, the presidency, encourage his family, especially his aged mother, by sympathetic and supportive gestures from all and sundry, at this crucial time as they grief. On the flip side, our politicians should practise the sacred oaths of their offices, walk and thread with dignity, devoid of rancour and bitterness, with fear of God in mind, as to Him alone will all be accountable sometime in the future. As a Peace Scholar, and a Reformer, the undersigned strongly believes our country, Nigeria will survive this transition period, if we all work towards these noble goals and objectives. Long Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and we also salute His Excellency, Dr Goodluck E. Jonathan, the Commander-in-Chief, as the new President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. As a die-hard patriot, wish you more blessing and inner peace.\n\nMay his soul rest in perfect peace. Nigeria need to stop where the president is coming from or who will be the president, north and south, and let so called PDP stop that their blind gentlemen agreement, that is not good for Nigerians. According to them dragging that the president most come from North, for me that is not accepted, because North has been ruling Nigeria for more than 50 years still they are dragging to lead again. Is that their birth right? Let the masses select their president by voting whom they want, but i think Mr Jonathan is good for that. Lets change base now.\n\nVery sad and my condolences. Shame that nothing will ever stop the blatent corruption and thievery that is Nigeria. When a country does not respect itself, when the government takes all the oil wealth and puts it in Swiss bank accounts and when people have nothing to lose you have Nigeria. It should be more than a Dubai, it is a total failure.\n\nThe Nigerian government must get a grip and make a country that is fair to all, and overcome selfish greed. Join teh 21st Century and prove to the world that an African country run by Africans can be a glowing jewel , an example to all. That could be Nigeria if greed and corruption, poverty and desperation doesn't ruin it all..\n\nGood luck\n\nYar'Adua Has no legacy bcus he is not democraticlly elected by Nigerian people by their votes, he is OBJ chosen choice. And this is why he had to shoose all the lions surrounding him who made Nigeria not to move forward. Who are the people showering praises to him but his likes. I wish now that he's finally gone, I hope,(that is if only Nigerians have physically seen his corpse and identified that he had not been buried since in SA until this lions can no longer hold on any longer, and decide he is dead) Nigerians can now be allowed to vote and choose a person of their choice like democratic world. BBC, I'm still waiting for you to show us as a proof Yar'Adua's face before he is buried, becus nothing BBC as well as the Nigerian govt tells Nigerians that they believe any longer. All the same, May his gentle soul RIP. May God bless Nigeria.\n\nI am surprised Yar'Adua's wife and the cloak-and-dagger individuals (who pulled the strings behind the scene and almost pushed Nigeria to the precipice in their power-mongering while he was sick), did not issue a communique refuting his death. It is a shame how greed for power went into the head of an otherwise faithful wife to the extent she used her husband's ill-health for personal gains. At last Yar'Adua can now rest in peace because he could not have had any consolation on his sick bed as he watched his wife and supposedly close collaborators scheme for power.\n\nMay the soul of our departed president Umaru Yar`dua rest in peace.\n\nAs the country will have to move forward and there is a constitutional need for a vice president, I`d suggest that President Goodluck Jonathan should appoint a female vice president. That will be a tremendous development in the history of Nigeria. With disregard to the irrational and selfish zoning policies of PDP, I`d nominate Prof Dora Akunyili for this post. President Jonathan this is your chance to immortalise your name for the good reasons and ensure an irreversible growth and development of Nigeria. We are loosing grip of our integrity and status in Africa and the world at large. Put us back on track. May God be with you.\n\nPresident Yar'adua was a good man with a gentle heart. His health did not allow him to complete his plans to quietly change the country for good. He was one of the few Nigerians, quietly struggling to positively change the country, amidst many others, trying to do good for themselves at the expense of Nigeria. There is a sorrow in my heart to note that Nigeria always succeeds in squeezing to death, those that would be her saviour. May his soul rest in peace, as we pray for Nigeria."
