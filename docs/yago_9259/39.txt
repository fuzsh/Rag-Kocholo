Turai, the wife of the late former President of Nigeria, Umaru Musa YarâAdua has recounted how her husband passed away 13 years ago.

YarâAdua served from 2007 to 2010.

He was the first elected president in Nigeria to have died in office.

In an interview with BBC Hausa, Turai revealed that her husband died moments after she left him to break her fast.

According to her, she returned to meet him struggling to breathe, before he eventually gave up the ghost.

“When it was time for me to break my fast, he was lying down looking at me. I felt he did not want me to leave, so I told him I was going to break my fast.

âI was later called back in and I met him struggling with his breath. That moment still lingers in my mind.

“I even quarrelled with myself on why I left to break my fast, I should have stayed,” Turai said.
