Turai, wife of the late former President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, has recounted how her husband died 13 years ago.

Yar’Adua was President from 2007 to 2010. He was the first elected president to have died while serving.

Yar’Adua died in office due to ill health after spending three years in power.

Speaking in an interview with BBC Hausa on Friday, Turai explained how her husband died moments after she left him to break her fast.

“I was fasting on that day. In fact, I had been fasting non-stop from when he took ill and even after he died, I did not stop,” she said.

“So when it was time for me to break my fast, he was lying down looking at me. I felt he did not want me to leave, so I told him I was going to break my fast. He then shook his head and I left.

“I was later called and I met him struggling with his breath. That moment still lingers in my mind. I even quarrelled with myself on why I left to break my fast, I should have stayed.”

Turai said her late husband led a simple life and was not “carried away by worldly things”.

“For example, he could be using a wristwatch continuously until the strap gets broken into two. Unless I see it, he would continue to use it like that,” she said.

“My husband was not taking alcohol, he would not go after women and he was not corrupt. He was a very simple person who did not attach importance to worldly things.

“I think about him every day. Every day seems like any other day. The only difference is that today, people gathered to pray for him, eulogize him and I’m happy. I thank them.”

Turai said she has no plan to venture into politics, adding that she lost the interest when her husband died.
