Turai married Umaru Yar'Adua in 1975[1] and they have five daughters and two sons. Her two sons are Shehu Umaru Musa Yar'adua and Musa Umar Musa Yar'adua.

Also, in attendance at the event were the Vice President's wife, Patience Jonathan, and the wives of other state governors.[4]

Turai was rumored to be one of her husband's closest advisors during his tenure as president of Nigeria.[1] For example, it was believed that Turai Yar'Adua influenced the choice of Professor Babatunde Osotimehin, the former Director-General of the National Action Committee on AIDS, as Nigeria's Minister of Health, during her husband's administration.[1]

Turai started her career as a teacher, before assuming the role of Katsina state's first lady, serving from 29 May 1999 – 29 May 2007, where she was noted for her empathy towards the plight of the less privileged. Turai Yar’Adua visited the First Lady, Aisha Buhari at the presidential villa, Abuja, early February 2020. The former first lady came visiting with her daughter Zainab Dakingari. The president's wife, stated that the two of them discussed gender-based violence, drug abuse, and the development of the country generally. Buhari added that she got Yar’Adua's perspectives on the issues, adding that Yar’Adua reminisced on the past, especially the years she spent at the State House.[5]
