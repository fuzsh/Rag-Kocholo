        "text": "The Messina crime family are an Italian and Italian-American La Cosa Nostra organized crime syndicate, who were founded in 1931 by Alex Messina, a Sicilian Mafia boss. The Messina Family were one of the strongest Italian families, one of the Five Families of New York City.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Messina crime family was founded by Alessandro Bertandiero, who was later known as \"Alex Messina\" due to his nickname and his birthplace. The Messina Mafia suffered from infighting in the 1970s and required the aid of the Gambetti crime family to put down the old order, with Harvey Noto purging the Messina bloodline. The Messinas then participated in warfare against the weak Ancelotti crime family, as well as the North Harlem Hustlers. The Messinas allied with the Jewish Mob, Gambetti crime family, Pavano crime family, Lupisella crime family, and the Manhattan Triads.\n\nThe Ancelotti family struck back in 2008 by blowing up an LTA Crane, a passenger train, and a private plane, weakening the Messinas. Capo Rocco Pelosi fought a series of mob wars against the Messinas, but by 2009, almost all of their made members were dead. Rudy D'Avanzano made a gamble where he fooled Triad mobster Huang Lee into thinking that Jimmy Capra was an FBI informant, but he was innocent, and relations between the Messinas and Triads were in the toilet. The relationships ended and the Messinas fell under deep FBI pressure when Fredo Volpe turned informant."
