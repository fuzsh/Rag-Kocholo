        "text": "Editor's note: The following article originally appeared in the April 2013 issue of Informer: The History of American Crime and Law Enforcement. It was initially revised for this website in January 2018, and it was updated in February 2022.\n\nPolice remove Alfredo Santantonio's body from a Brooklyn flower shop.\n\nNipped in the bud\n\nSantantonio\n\nOn July 11, 1963, two men wearing makeup disguises to hide their identities entered the Flowers By Charm flower store at 197 Avenue T in Brooklyn, New York. They approached the store owner behind the counter and fired five bullets into him before fleeing. Left lying dead on the floor was forty-year-old Gambino Crime Family member Alfredo Santantonio. [1]\n\nThe murder had the hallmarks of a professional killing. The shooters stole nothing, and Santantonioâs father-in-law, who was in the store, was left unhurt. Police ruled out any connection to the Gallo-Profaci War, then raging in Brooklyn between different factions of the organization headed by Joseph Profaci. However, it didnât take investigators long to figure out that it was a mob hit.\n\nNearly eighteen months earlier, authorities sentenced Santantonio to eight years in prison for selling stolen bonds. [2] He was appealing his conviction when he was gunned down. Colombo Crime Family member Gregory Scarpa, who had begun secretly cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation the year before, advised that âit was common talk in Brooklyn that [Santantonio] was killed because he was cooperating with the Government.â [3]\n\nScarpa confided that Mafia bosses intended to use Santantonioâs murder to undermine informant Joseph Valachiâs upcoming appearance before a U.S. Senate committee investigating organized crime. [4] The government, according to Scarpa, âwas planning to back up Valachiâs testimony with testimony from Santantonio.â By killing Santantonio, bosses hoped the government âwould not be able to use Valachi now because we got rid of their corroborator.â\n\nThe FBI never publicly confirmed Santantonioâs cooperation even though newspapers reported that the Mafia likely killed him for âcooperating with investigations into narcotics and counterfeiting activities on the East Coast.\" [5]\n\nHowever, recently declassified FBI intelligence reports confirmed that between December 1962 and July 1963, Santantonio secretly furnished valuable Intel under the informant symbol code âNY 3864â.\n\nSantantonio family background\n\nAlfredo Santantonio was born on March 13, 1923, in Brooklyn, New York. He was named for his maternal grandfather, Alfredo Calderone. Santantonioâs parents, Philip and Rosa, were Italian immigrants. Philip was a stenographer, and Rosa was a presser in a textile factory.\n\nSantantonio grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Nicknamed âFreddie the Sidge,â he completed his education at Edward B. Shallow Junior High School in the eighth grade. Santantonio served two terms in the United States Navy, 1943 to 1947 and 1947 to 1949, before being honorably discharged. He married Marie Colombo in 1954.\n\nAfter leaving the Navy, Santantonio was arrested in February 1950 at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York, and charged with illegal possession of heroin worth $336,000. [6] Authorities alleged that Santantonio and an associate delivered heroin and other drugs to contacts throughout the southern United States, including New Orleans. His criminal record also included arrests for assault and robbery in Florida.\n\nHis surname appears variously as âSan Antonio,â âSanantonio,â and âSantantonioâ in census records and newspaper reports. Santantonio spelled and signed his surname as âSantantonioâ when he registered for military service during World War II. His grave marker also used the spelling âSantantonio.â\n\nGambino secrets\n\nParisi\n\nAlfredo Santantonio told federal agents that he was inducted into the Gambino Crime Family in 1953 in the presence of boss Albert Anastasia. [7] His sponsor was his brother-in-law Joseph Parisi. [8] Fifty-seven-year-old Parisi married thirty-eight-year-old Marie Santantonio in 1953. Born and raised in Manhattanâs Lower East Side, Parisi was secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 27, which controlled the city's waste management industry.\n\nParisi had a criminal record dating to 1921 with eleven arrests. He served two and a half years in prison following a conviction for rape. In 1934, he was arrested with mob bosses Charles âLuckyâ Luciano and Louis Buchalter for organizing an illegal cartel in New Yorkâs paper box industry. Parisi was a prime suspect in the murder of union rival John Acropolis in 1952. [9]\n\nParisi enriched the coffers of the Gambino Crime Family by creating a cartel in New York Cityâs private waste management industry and charging customers exorbitant fees. He enforced control through violence and threats of strikes against uncooperative businesses. He reported directly to Anastasia.\n\nAnastasia assigned newly inducted Santantonio to caporegime Charles Dongarra. The Sicilian-born Dongarra controlled a large crew that included Joseph N. Gallo, who would one day become the crime familyâs consigliere. Anastasia took a âlikingâ to Santantonio and gave him the responsibility to oversee a craps game. It allowed him to see Anastasia every day. Santantonio was in the process of establishing a close relationship with Anastasia when the boss was murdered in 1957.\n\nAdelstein\n\nIn 1956, Joseph Parisi died of a heart attack at age sixty. Anastasia was convinced that Parisiâs union associate, Bernard Adelstein, withheld $40,000 collected by Parisi before his death from shaking down private waste management companies. Anastasia intended to use the money to bribe politicians to make new laws to force businesses to use mob-controlled companies.\n\nAnastasia ordered Santantonio to collect the money. Santantonio assaulted Adelstein twice, but he refused to admit he stole the money. Anastasia called off another beating after law enforcement began investigating the waste management industry, and things got âtoo hot.â\n\nSantantonio said Gambino Crime Family members paid regular dues between $10 to $25, depending on their income level. Sometimes they had to pay a âspecial assessmentâ if a member was in trouble. Individuals were too fearful ever to question how the bosses spent the money.\n\nCrew leader Charles Dongarra spent his summers at a farm in Windham, New York. While he was away, Joseph N. Gallo acted in his place. Gallo had many contacts in Baltimore and Philadelphia and often visited on business. [10]\n\nDongarra\n\nAccording to Santantonio, Gambino Crime Family member Anthony Scotto replaced Anthony \"Tough Tony\" Anastasio, Albertâs younger brother, as boss of the Brooklyn waterfront. [11]\n\nGambino Crime Family members living in Miami reported to Joseph Silesi, one of approximately two-dozen caporegimes in the crime family. [12] Thomas Altamura acted in his place when he was away.\n\nSantantonio said the organization recently suspended Miami-based member Joseph Indelicato because of excessive indebtedness. Indelicato had to report daily to Altamura until he repaid his debt and could get reinstated. [13]\n\nSantantonio cleared up the mysterious disappearance of former Gambino Crime Family caporegime Tommy Rava. Rava, Carlo Gambinoâs chief rival to replace Anastasia as boss of the crime family, attended the underworld conclave in Apalachin, New York, in 1957, before dropping out of sight. Rava was presumed murdered, but his body was never found.\n\nAccording to Santantonio, Joseph Indelicato and Thomas Altamura murdered Rava at a funeral parlor in Florida. They put Rava in a body bag, stuck him numerous times with an icepick and dumped his body in the ocean. [14]\n\nIndelicato and Altamura also murdered a swindler named Louis âBabeâ Silvers at the Blue Bay motel in Miami. Silvers was allegedly murdered on the orders of Gambino Crime Family member Carmine Lombardozzi after he stole money from the organization. Santantonio said Indelicato and Altamura got away with the Silvers murder after allegedly paying the district attorney a $40,000 bribe.\n\nCommission and other Intel\n\nAlfredo Santantonio fed the FBI Intel about mobsters outside the Gambino Crime Family.\n\nBonanno Crime Family member Benjamin Valvo told Santantonio that Frank Garofalo, a narcotics trafficker, used to be the underboss of the crime family. Valvo said that Garofalo âgot frightenedâ and fled to Italy when Vito Genovese and Carmine Galante received lengthy prison sentences for dealing heroin.\n\nValvo said his brother Matteo Valvo replaced Giovanni Tartamella as a caporegime after Tartamella suffered a stroke. Salvatore Bonanno, the son of crime boss Joseph Bonanno, was elected to the position of consigliere, also formerly held by Tartamella. Santantonio said John Morales was the âacting bossâ when Joseph Bonanno was absent from New York City. [15]\n\nValachi\n\nSantantonio said the ultimate decision-making body in the Mafia underworld was called the âHigh Commission.â Santantonio said itâs called the âHigh Commissionâ to distinguish it from dispute-resolving commissions in each crime family. Cleveland's John Scalish was allegedly a member of the âHigh Commissionâ as early as 1955. Philadelphiaâs Angelo Bruno joined in 1962. Gerry Catena represented the Genovese Crime Family while boss Vito Genovese was incarcerated. [16]\n\nAccording to Santantonio, Dongarra updated his crew every few years about the new policy decisions made at the national level. For example, in December 1962, Dongarra advised that Carlo Gambino passed on word the âHigh Commissionâ had strictly forbidden members from participating in bombings, kidnappings and narcotics distribution.\n\nSantantonio said the bombing prohibition was in light of the recent car bomb in Cleveland that killed mobster Charles Cavallaro and his son. The narcotics ban had been in place for years due to pressure from law enforcement.\n\nSantantonio identified hundreds of Mafia members in New York City's five crime families, some of them for the first time. [17] And he helped to ensure the existing FBI membership lists were accurate. For example, until he pointed it out, the FBI had Santantonio listed as a member of the Colombo Crime Family. [18]\n\nBecoming a âmadeâ man\n\nAlfredo Santantonio gave a breakdown of the actions necessary to become an inducted member of the Gambino Crime Family. The FBI was still in the dark about much of this stuff in early 1963. Joseph Valachi and other informants were only beginning to fill in the blanks about the Mafiaâs inner workings.\n\nSantantonio said the organization's purpose was âself protection and self preservation from the underworld itself.â He said individuals who operated on the fringes of the law, like bookmakers, needed to be affiliated with the organization to avoid being robbed or assaulted. He said the organization took a percentage of the profits for this service. [19] He said virtually all bookmakers in New York City were Mafia members or had the backing of one. [20] He advised that New York City had about two thousand Mafia members. [21]\n\nMembers of the organization werenât required to engage in illegal activity, but given their criminal backgrounds, most members did. [22]\n\nAccording to Santantonio, if an individual wanted to join the organization, his sponsor would perform a background check on him, contact friends and relatives in the neighborhood and Italy, check with sources in the police department and talk to other crime families. An existing member could sponsor a relative into the organization without a background check. An individual would be disqualified for membership if he was a pimp or if his wife was a prostitute. Family leaders liked to induct âgood earnersâ because they meant more money in the leaderâs pockets.\n\nTo test if an individual was worthy of membership, the organization might ask him to participate in a killing - what Santantonio called âdirty work.â If the individual was with a member and he happened to kill someone because of some unexpected trouble, he would be inducted into the crime family immediately. Or, if he didnât perform well, the organization would kill him.\n\nIf the background check panned out, the sponsor would seek his caporegimeâs permission to induct him.\n\nInduction ceremonies usually occurred within a month of the sponsor extending the invitation to the individual. Because the organization was so âvicious,â individuals always accepted for fear of being killed if they refused. The induction ceremony could occur in the basement of a memberâs home when his family is away or on some remote farm. [23]\n\nThe ceremony\n\nThe boss, underboss and consigliere attend each Gambino Crime Family induction ceremony. The caporegime conducts the ceremony, not the boss. All members of the caporegimeâs crew are present. The meeting begins with the members standing and holding hands. Then, in Italian, the caporegime says, âIn the name of our âCausa,' the meeting is open.â\n\nThe caporegime starts by reminding members late with their assessments to pay up before moving on to agenda items. At the end of the meeting, the caporegime announces that the crime family intends to induct a new member. Finally, he gives the name of the proposed member and his sponsor.\n\nIf an existing member furnishes credible proof of why a proposed member should not be inducted, the organization will kill the proposed member on the spot. Hearsay allegations are not accepted. According to Santantonioâs experience, a member will sometimes throw out some bogus accusation to make the sponsor look bad in front of the boss. If there are no objections, members stand up, hold hands again, and the caporegime will close the meeting.\n\nAt this point, the caporegime will bring the proposed member into the room and ask him if he knows why he is there. The proposed member will state that his sponsor invited him to join the crime family. The caporegime then asks if he knows anything else about the organization. The proposed member will say âno,â as his sponsor has coached him.\n\nThe caporegime will break down the membership rules for the new member, including paying the assessment, clearing all legal and illegal activities, and avoiding selling narcotics or using bombs. According to Santantonio, Gambino Crime Family members are not required to put the organization before their religious faith or country like other families.\n\n\"I swear that I will not reveal anything that was said here, and I will do anything that I am told to do.\"\n\nAfter the proposed member agrees to all the terms, everyone stands, the members hold hands, and the induction ceremony begins.\n\nThe sponsor will prick his finger and the finger of the proposed member with a needle. Then they touch their two bloodied fingers together. Next, the sponsor places a burning picture of a saint in the proposed member's hands and gets him to repeat the following oath, âI swear that I will not reveal anything that was said here, and I will do anything that I am told to do.â\n\nThe sponsor kisses the new member and introduces him to his caporegime with the words, âamigo nostraâ or âhe is a new friend of ours.â Next, the caporegime provides the new member with information about the leaders of the other crime families and the Commission members. The meeting ends when everyone stands, holds hands, and the caporegime announces in Italian, âthe meeting is closed.â Members leave the meeting location in groups of two to avoid raising suspicion.\n\nSantantonio said in 1963 that the books were closed, preventing the induction of new members, and would remain closed until the bosses decided that they needed money. He said the âact of âmakingâ individuals is a business proposition.â\n\nAccording to Santantonio, the Gambino Crime Family had between seven hundred and one thousand members. The Genovese Family had about five hundred members. The Lucchese and Bonanno Crime Families had about two hundred members. The Colombos were the smallest at a hundred and fifty members. [24]\n\nAnastasia murder\n\nCostello\n\nThree shootings rocked the New York underworld in 1957. The shootings were connected, although that was not clear to the FBI until a few years later when member-informants like Joseph Valachi and Santantonio talked.\n\nOn May 2, 1957, Frank Costello, the Genovese Crime Family boss, was shot and wounded when Vincent Gigante surprised him entering his Central Park apartment. Gigante was charged with attempted murder, although a jury acquitted him at trial. Santantonio advised federal agents that Thomas Eboli and Dominick Alongi were with Gigante the night of the shooting. However, witnesses never identified them, and they were never charged. Valachi provided similar Intel.\n\nOn June 17, 1957, two gunmen shot Albert Anastasia's underboss Frank Scalise as he shopped at a vegetable market in the Bronx. Authorities never solved the murder, but Santantonio told federal agents that Anastasia ordered Scalise's murder for complaining to Frank Costello about Anastasia's alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking. By the late 1950s, the Commission prohibited members from dealing narcotics because of the fear of lengthy prison sentences.\n\nScalise accused Anastasia of forcing drug dealers to make him a secret partner in their transactions. Scalise's murder, according to Santantonio, had nothing to do with selling Mafia memberships as Valachi claimed in debriefings with federal agents but for exposing Anastasia's illicit drug dealing.\n\nSantantonio cleared up the mystery of who shot Albert Anastasia on October 25, 1957. Santantonio's understanding of how the murder happened is probably close to the truth since he learned the details firsthand from one of the alleged conspirators. [25]\n\nSantantonio advised that Anastasia's murder was orchestrated by three underlings named Joseph Riccobono, Joseph Biondo and Charles Dongarra. All three were Sicilian-born caporegimes active on Manhattan's Lower East Side. They received a tip from another caporegime named Joseph Franco that Anastasia intended to kill them. [26] However, Santantonio never explained why Anastasia targeted them. [27]\n\nAnastasia\n\nRather than wait for Anastasia to take them out, Riccobono's group struck first while Anastasia was having a shave and haircut in a Manhattan hotel barbershop. Santantonio said the killers knew he frequented the location, making it ideal.\n\nDongarra told Santantonio that the actual shooters were Gambino Crime Family member Stephen âStevie Cooganâ Grammauta and his associate, Joseph Cahill. [28] Grammauta was a convicted heroin dealer in the crew of his cousin Steve Armone. Joseph N. Gallo and Andrew Alberti were also part of the murder conspiracy.\n\nThe shooters hid the murder weapons in the hotel room of boxer Johnny Russo, the nephew of Gambino Crime Family member John âJohnny Connecticutâ Russo. After the shooting, Grammauta and Cahill took the subway home.\n\nSantantonio said Commission members never learned the identities of the two individuals who pulled the trigger. In the absence of other information, underworld rumors flourished that Larry and Joey Gallo or Carmine Persico were responsible. [29]\n\nAfter the murder, Riccobono reached out to Gambino Crime Family caporegime Domenico Arcuri to declare that he represented the group that killed Anastasia. He requested that Arcuri notify the other caporegimes in the crime family about what happened. Riccobono also contacted New York bosses Thomas Lucchese and Vito Genovese. [30]\n\nAccording to Santantonio, Riccobono appeared before an underworld âtrialâ at the estate of Genovese Crime Family caporegime Richard Boiardo in New Jersey. Representatives from New York's five crime families were there, including Carmine Galante, Thomas Lucchese, Vito Genovese, Tommy Rava, Johnny Robilotto, and Joseph Biondo. [31]\n\nRiccobono, speaking on behalf of the group, took full responsibility for the murder. According to Santantonio, Riccobono spoke eloquently and persuaded the bosses that the group acted in self-defense. As a result, the bosses issued pardons to everyone involved, including Grammauta and Cahill.\n\nAccording to Santantonio, mob leaders convened the Apalachin meeting three weeks later, on November 14, 1957, to notify other crime bosses not in attendance at the New Jersey meeting about the reasons behind Anastasia's murder. [32]\n\nSantantonio implied Vito Genovese had reason to support a strike against Albert Anastasia. Frank Costello and Anastasia were close allies. Santantonio claimed that after Genovese sent Vincent Gigante to shoot Frank Costello, Costello retaliated by providing Anastasia with a $250,000 war chest to gather an army to kill Genovese. [33]\n\nSuspects in the killing of Santantonio\n\nHit team\n\nThe valuable Intel furnished by Santantonio abruptly ended after eight months when he was shot dead. [34] Authorities determined an execution squad led by Brooklyn-based caporegime Peter Ferrara killed Santantonio. As part of an unrelated investigation, law enforcement planted a listening device in a mob-controlled Coney Island service station. The bug unexpectedly recorded Ferrara discussing details of the murder conspiracy.\n\nFerrara suspected Santantonio revealed details about the organizationâs heroin trafficking network to law enforcement. As a result, family leaders, including Paul Castellano, ordered Ferrara to kill Santantonio to silence him and serve as a warning to others to keep quiet. The shooters were allegedly Angelo Meli and Joseph Farinella, while Ferrara and Nicholas Russo acted as backups and waited outside the flower store in getaway vehicles. [35]\n\nMafia member Meli was a convicted heroin dealer. Meliâs father, Giosue, and brother, Philip, were also identified as Gambino members. Russo and Farinella were Trenton, New Jersey-based members. [36] Informer Salvatore Gravano implicated Russo and Farinella in two murder conspiracies in the 1980s.\n\nAuthorities arrested Ferrara, Meli, Farinella and Russo after the shooting. However, the district attorney tossed the murder charges in 1967 after the United States Supreme Court banned using evidence obtained from illegal electronic surveillance. [37]\n\nSantantonio, a Navy veteran, was buried at the Long Island National Cemetery in East Farmingdale, New York.\n\nA capoâs tough times\n\nAround the time Alfredo Santantonio was killed, another Gambino Crime Family member faced his own life and death struggles in Brooklyn. Carmine Lombardozzi was a caporegime with one of the largest crews in the crime family. He replaced the deceased Joseph Franco in 1957.\n\nLombardozzi\n\nLombardozzi made a fortune in gambling, loan sharking, labor racketeering and selling stolen securities. He was at the forefront of white-collar crime long before it became the hallmark under the future boss, Paul Castellano. Lombardozzi was one of five Gambino Crime Family members to attend the mob meeting at Apalachin in November 1957. But two missteps nearly cost him his life.\n\nHis first mistake was an ill-advised romance with the daughter of crew member Sabato Muro. Lombardozzi was a married man, and it was against the organizationâs rules to keep a relative of another member as a mistress. As a result, Muro brought a formal complaint against him. To save himself, Lombardozzi divorced his wife and married Muro's daughter.\n\nLombardozzi found himself in hot water again when his brother and nephews attacked a federal agent conducting surveillance at his fatherâs funeral. The assault led to increased federal scrutiny of the Gambino Crime Family and further soured the low-key Carlo Gambino on him. [38]\n\nLombardozzi's superiors demoted him to soldier and replaced him with Joseph Gennaro. Many in the underworld suspected he would wind up dead. [39]\n\nDespite these incidents, Carmine Lombardozzi continued to prosper in the criminal underworld and lived to age seventy-nine, dying of natural causes in 1992. Gambino Crime Family leaders attended his wake.\n\nLombardozzi and the informant\n\nOn August 22, 1968, authorities charged Carmine Lombardozzi with violating federal laws for fraud and transporting stolen goods. Soon afterward, an informant thought to be Lombardozzi began to share confidential information with the FBI. [40] The informant, assigned the symbol code âNY 6436,â identified Mafia members and provided valuable historical information.\n\nLombardozzi and the informant match on four key points:\n\nInducted member\n\nâNY 6436â and Lombardozzi were Mafia members. [41]\n\nCrime family affiliation\n\nâNY 6436â and Lombardozzi were Gambino Crime Family members. [42]\n\nApalachin\n\nâNY 6436â attended the Apalachin meeting in 1957 as part of the Gambino Crime Family delegation and was still active in the New York underworld. [43] This limits the possible informant to the any of the five Gambino Crime Family members known to have been there: Carlo Gambino, Paul Castellano, Tommy Rava, Joseph Riccobono and Carmine Lombardozzi. [44] (A sixth member, Armand Simonetti, may have been present but was not named in Apalachin reports.)\n\nWhen the informant cooperated in 1968, Rava was deceased and Riccobono was inactive. Carlo Gambino and Paul Castellano were running the crime family and unlikely to be cooperating. By eliminating the other attendees, Lombardozzi becomes the best suspect from this group.\n\nBaltimore\n\nâNY 6436â visited Baltimore on business. [45] Frank Corbi, a Gambino Crime Family member, operated gambling and strip clubs in the city. [46] The informant said there were approximately fifty crime family associates in Baltimore.\n\nThe informant advised that he and Joseph Franco (Lombardozziâs former crew leader before he died) attended the wake of Corbiâs brother and the wedding of another memberâs daughter in the 1950s. [47] FBI intelligence reports show Lombardozzi also attended the same wake and wedding. There may have been other Gambino attendees, but they were not noted.\n\nMoreover, the informant who furnished details about the activities of Lombardozzi and the informant in Baltimore was the same informant who attended the Apalachin meeting. [48] Examining all the Gambino Crime Family members that fit the profile, Lombardozzi appears to be the only one who attended Apalachin and handled mob business in Baltimore. Therefore, in all likelihood, Carmine Lombardozzi was informant âNY 6436â.\n\nWide-ranging Intel\n\nIntel furnished by âNY 6436â is included in FBI intelligence reports produced between 1968 and 1969. He may have cooperated beyond then, but publicly available reports citing âNY 6436â are confined to that period.\n\nâNY 6436â estimated that New York City had two thousand Mafia members, but five hundred were dead. [49] He said there is no official retirement process in the Mafia. However, members usually retired in their mid-seventies when the organization stopped calling on them to perform a service for the crime family. A member must abide by all the organization rules until he dies. The organization does not provide retired members with a pension.\n\nThe informant said the Commission had forbidden members from engaging in narcotics or counterfeiting since 1953. The penalty was death.\n\nFather and sons, or brothers, can belong to different crime families as long as they have permission from the bosses'.\n\nâNY 6436â told federal agents that Pittsburgh boss John LaRocca and Raymond Patriarca from the New England Crime Family attended the Apalachin meeting but escaped undetected by law enforcement. [50]\n\nHe said Russell Bufalino headed his own fifty-member crime family based in Pittston, Pennsylvania. [51] Members lived in the small towns near Pittston and were active in the garment industry. The informant said he met Bufalino at Apalachin and had lunch with him often when he came to New York City. He described Bufalinoâs underboss as an âold time greaseball.â âNY 6436â dispelled misinformation supplied by Philadelphia Crime Family member-informant Rocco Scafidi that claimed Bufalino was a Lucchese Crime Family member.\n\nThe Gambino Crime Family informant told federal agents that Chicago Outfit leader Sam Giancana was part-owner of Capraâs restaurant in Miami. He said Tampa boss Santo Trafficante was there âalmost every night.â [52]\n\nRava\n\nHe stated that Tommy Rava and Neil Dellacroce killed former Gambino Crime Family member Johnny Robilotto after he decided to back Carlo Gambino to head the crime family. He said Robilotto had initially supported Rava to succeed Albert Anastasia but changed his mind. According to âNY 6436,â Robilotto was popular, and other crime families still talked about the murder.\n\nHe told the FBI that Genovese Crime Family member Salvatore Granello was investigating the murder of his son and threatening to kill those responsible. Michael Granello was killed gangland-style in December 1968 after ignoring warnings about stepping on the toes of Mafia members. (Salvatore Granello was murdered a short time later.) [53]\n\nThe informant told federal agents about Tampa Crime Family member Lennie (last name unknown), who had been slated for death by boss Santo Trafficante. Trafficante farmed out the contract to the Genovese Crime Family because Lennie had moved to Coney Island, Brooklyn. The first attempt to kill Lennie was unsuccessful. The contract passed to the Lucchese Crime Family, who also âmissed.â Eventually, the Gambino Crime Family got in on the act, but Lennie got wind of what was going on and fled to San Francisco. The informant said that Lennie was still living there as far he knew. [54]\n\nMafia meetings\n\nLike Alfredo Santantonio, informant âNY 6436â told federal agents about a pre-Apalachin meeting at the estate of Richard Boiardo. The gathering, larger than Apalachin, was an âinquiryâ into the killing of Albert Anastasia. Attendees included Commission members Joseph Bonanno and Vito Genovese from New York, Sam Giancana from Chicago, Steve Magaddino from Buffalo, Joseph Ida from Philadelphia, and Joseph Zerilli from Detroit. According to the informant, the Commission members were âfeeling the pulseâ everyone there. He said he got the impression some of the bosses knew beforehand why Anastasia was killed, but others were in the dark. The meeting ran all day until the following morning at five o'clock. [55]\n\nCarlo Gambino spoke at the meeting, justifying Anastasiaâs murder because âhe was using people from other âfamiliesâ to kill people, and he was killing some people should not have been killed.â [56] âNY 6436â didnât disclose the results of the âinquiry,â only that âit was decided to continue [the] meeting at another location.â [57] This second gathering turned out to be Apalachin.\n\n\"[Anastasia] was using people from other 'families' to kill people and he was killing some people who should not have been killed.\"\n\nAlthough âNY 6436â claimed he attended both meetings, Santantonioâs account of the pre-Apalachin meeting that followed Anastasiaâs murder appears to be more accurate. âNY 6436â advised that the meeting at Richard Boiardoâs estate occurred âtwo months prior to the Apalachin meetingâ and âwas to discuss the Anastasia killing,â which is impossible since Anastasia died less than three weeks before Apalachin. [58]\n\nEven if âNY 6436â mixed up the dates, it's hard to imagine bosses from Philadelphia, Buffalo, Detroit and Chicago traveling to New Jersey for a meeting and then proceeding to Upstate New York in the short window between Anastasiaâs murder and the Apalachin conclave. (Santantonio made no mention of Commission members outside of New York attending the pre-Apalachin meeting.)\n\nIn his recollection of events from ten years earlier, âNY 6436â although an eyewitness, may have conflated details from three separate meetings that occurred in 1957: 1. The reconciliation meeting between Vito Genovese and Albert Anastasia after the Costello shooting in May; 2. The pre-Apalachin meeting (or underworld trial) after Anastasia's assassination; 3. The Apalachin conclave in November.\n\nJoseph Bonanno provided a glimpse of the first of the three meetings. According to his autobiography, after the Costello shooting, he and the other New York bosses attended a dinner where Anastasia and Genovese kissed and hashed out a (temporary) truce. [59] Additional evidence of this meeting came from a secret FBI listening device, which intercepted a conversation between Philadelphia mob leaders about a gathering in the âlast quarter of 1957â including Albert Anastasia, Sam Giancana, Anthony Accardo, Dominic Pollina and others. [60]\n\nMeeting details are scant, but Anastasia acted âfearfulâ and wouldnât go to the originally proposed venue at the estate of Richard Boiardo. As a result, mob leaders moved it to the basement of a restaurant.\n\nThe meeting that âNY 6436â said occurred âtwo months prior to the Apalachin meetingâ may have been the reconciliation dinner between Anastasia and Genovese that ultimately failed. And contrary to what he told the FBI, the pre-Apalachin meeting that followed Anastasiaâs murder probably was as Santantonio described it - an underworld trial of Anastasiaâs killers conducted strictly by the New York bosses.\n\nHow long âNY 6436â cooperated is unknown. But it appears his cooperation was short-lived, and his information had little lasting impact. Special agent Bruce Mouw took charge of the FBI's investigation of the Gambino Crime Family in 1980. Mouw commented that he found the Intel furnished by informants âwas ancient history, at least a decade oldâ and was like âstarting with zero.â [61]\n\nNotes\n\n1 âEx-convict is slain by 2 in flower shop,â New York Times, July 12, 1963; New York and Brooklyn Daily, July 12, 1963. âWhen reporters asked [Santantonioâs father-in-law] to tell his story he turned away icily and said, âI donât know nothing.ââ\n\n2 âThree sentenced in U.S. bond fraud,â New York Times, Feb. 6, 1962.

The induction date or Anastasiaâs position is off, since Anastasia was underboss between 1931 and 1951 and boss between 1951 and 1957.\n\n8 Santantonio entered the Navy at twenty years old and left at twenty-six in 1949.

Putnamâs Sons, 1968, pp. 248-249. According to Valachi, bosses Vito Genovese and Thomas Lucchese orchestrated Anastasiaâs murder. They feared Anastasia, a strong supporter of Genovese rival Frank Costello, may have wanted to avenge Costelloâs shooting. Both versions may be accurate: Riccobono and his group went after Anastasia because he intended to kill them, and Lucchese and Genovese took advantage of the opportunity to remove Anastasia when it presented itself.\n\n26 Franco died before Commission members could test the veracity of his accusation.\n\n27 An aspect of Anastasiaâs murder was the tension between the primarily non-Sicilian faction that supported the Calabrian-born Anastasia and the Sicilians coalescing around Frank Scalise, Joseph Riccobono, Joseph Biondo and Carlo Gambino.\n\n28 Mob reporter Jerry Capeci broke the story in 2001. Capeci claimed the shooters were Stephen Grammauta and his associate Arnold Wittenberg (rather than Joseph Cahill).\n\n29 FBI, LCN, New York Office, Feb. 12, 1969, NARA Record No. 124-10297-10003, p.12. Killers from outside the Gambino Crime Family were always unlikely since use of outside gunmen was one rationale put forward by the anti-Anastasia faction to justify the murder.\n\n30 FBI, Criminal Intelligence Program, New York Office, Jan. 3, 1963, NARA Record No. 124-90066-10007, pp. 8-10. Vito Genovese and Thomas Lucchese were likely aware of the assassination plot in advance, although not necessarily behind it. As a result, the outcome of the underworld trial may have been predetermined.\n\n31 The only New York City crime family without a representative was the Colombo Crime Family. Joseph Bonanno, who wrote a candid memoir about his life in organized crime, didnât mention this meeting.\n\n32 The Valachi Papers, pp. 251-252.

In 1962, Philadelphia Crime Family member Pasquale Massi attended a meeting in New Jersey involving Anastasia and other Commission members. It can be dated to âlast quarter of 1957â because: Dominic Pollina had succeeded Joseph Ida as Philadelphia boss, Sam Giancana had succeeded Tony Accardo as boss of Chicago (Accardo could have been introducing Giancana to the other Commission members on this trip), and Anastasia was acting âfearful,â which would be consistent with the loss of his mob protector, Frank Costello."
