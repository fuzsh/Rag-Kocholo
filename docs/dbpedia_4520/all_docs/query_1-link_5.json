        "text": "THE Gambino mob family was founded in the 1900s and was known as one of the \"Five Families\" that dominate organized crime activities in New York City.\n\nOver the years, multiple family members have passed away but their story will live on in a new ABC documentary.\n\nWho are the Gambino mob family and where are they now?\n\nThe family was first formed under the leadership of Salvatore D’Aquila in the 1900s but following his murder in 1928, control was left and taken by multiple people.\n\nThe Gambino mob family includes:\n\nAlbert Anastasia\n\nItalian-American mobster Umberto \"Albert\" Anastasia, famously took control of the Gambino family in 1951.\n\nHe was also known as the co-founder of Murder, Inc., an organization that was known for mob-related assassinations.\n\nAlbert was considered extremely dangerous and some even went as far as to call him insane, according to the Crime Museum.\n\nHe was ultimately assassinated in 1957 after members of his crew had plotted against him.\n\nCarlo Gambino\n\nCarlo Gambino is known today as one of the most successful crime bosses of all time.\n\nHe was known for strengthing the family and increasing their profit levels all while staying out of the public eye after taking over control following Albert's death.\n\nCarlo was able to avoid being linked to any criminal activity from 1957 to 1976 and never spent a day in jail.\n\nHe ultimately passed away on October 15, 1976, after suffering a heart attack.\n\nAniello Dellacroce\n\nAmerican mobster Aniello John \"Neil\" Dellacroce was known as the Gambino family's underboss.\n\nHe was appointed to the position by Carlo and took over for Joseph Biondo.\n\nAniello was known as John Gotti's mentor but was ultimately sent to jail in 1973 after being convicted of tax evasion.\n\nHe was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $15,000.\n\nAniello ultimately passed away on December 2, 1985.\n\nPaul Castellano\n\nPaul Castellano took control of the family business in 1976 following the death of Carlo Gambino.\n\nDespite being Carlo's brother-in-law, many were not happy with the way he ran the family.\n\nHe was ultimately assassinated on December 16, 1985, after a hit was was ordered on him by John Gotti.\n\nJohn Gotti\n\nJohn Gotti notoriously took over control of the Gambino family in 1985 following the murder of Paul Castellano, with Salvatore “Sammy the Bull” Gravano as his second-in-command.\n\nOver the years, John was able to avoid criminal charges and was found not guilty at three different trials, which led to his nickname, “The Teflon Don.\"\n\nDespite his success, his Underbook later turned on him which led to him being sentenced to life in prison in 1992.\n\nJohn later died on June 10, 2002.\n\nJohn Angelo Gotti Jr.\n\nFollowing John Gotti's death, his son, John Gotti Jr., 57, took over in 1992.\n\nThe law eventually caught up with John Jr. as well and in 1999, he pled guilty to four acts of racketeering including bribery, extortion, and the threat of violence.\n\nHe was later sentenced to six years and five months in prison.\n\nAfter his sentence, he reportedly left the criminal life behind and has become an entrepreneur and writer.\n\nDespite serving his time, John Jr. revealed that he sometimes feels guilty because of his freedom.\n\n\"I’m home with my family and friends, and I run numerous businesses, while some of my former peers are serving life sentences, many for crimes they did not commit, often because rats lied about them,\" he wrote in an essay for Men's Journal.\n\n\"I often feel guilty I’m free and they’re not.\"\n\nSammy \"The Bull\" Gravano\n\nBorn March 12, 1945, Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano, 76, is known as a former mobster who served as the underboss of the Gambino crime family.\n\nSammy is responsible for helping the FBI bring down powerful Gambino boss John Gotti for good after he turned against the family.\n\n\"Being a gangster, actually in my life, was a curse,\" Gravano told ABC News, \"and it did affect my family.\"\n\nAfter confessing to 19 murders, including the killings of his best friend, Louis Milito, and his brother-in-law, Sammy spent five years in prison.\n\nHe was then arrested again in 2000 for his ecstasy drug ring which ran drugs from Arizona to New York in the 1990s. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and was released in September 2017.\n\nAfter getting out, he continued to tell his story and even hosts a podcast.\n\nKaren Gravano\n\nBorn May 8, 1972, Karen Gravano, 49, is known as Sammy's daughter.\n\nShe is known today as a television personality and became a household name after debuting on the VH1 series, Mob Wives. Over the years, she has also appeared on MTV's Families of the Mafia.\n\nKaren has also had some run-ins with the law throughout the course of her life and was even arrested in February 2000 for her involvement in Sammy's ecstasy drug ring.\n\nShe ultimately pleaded guilty to the use of wire communications and other drug-related transactions, according to ABC News, and was sentenced to three years of probation.\n\nKaren is also known as a published author and famously wrote the 2012 book, Mob Daughter: The Mafia, Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano, and Me!\n\nGerard Gravano\n\nGerard Gravano is known as Sammy's son and has also famously appeared on MTV's Families of the Mafia.\n\nLike his sister, he was also arrested in 2000 due to his involvement in Sammy's ecstasy ring and later pleaded guilty to “illegally conducting an enterprise and offering to sell and transport dangerous drug,\" according to ABC News.\n\nGerard was sentenced to nine years in prison and later moved to Arizona after he was released and settled down with Amy Lynn Price Gravano, whom he married in 2018.\n\nThe couple started a business together in 2016 called Impact Payment Options, LLC, which is known for serving the Credit Card Service industry.\n\nOutside of the company, Amy is known as a hairstylist and a health coach.\n\nThey have also welcomed four children together.\n\nWhat is The Last Gangster?\n\nTruth and Lies: The Last Gangster is an ABC News special that tells the story of Sammy Gravano.\n\nThe two-hour special, which is set to premiere on January 27, 2022, at 8:00pm EST, will feature an interview with Sammy as well as other former members of the Gambino family including John Jr, Gerard, and Karen.\n\nThere will also be interviews with former FBI and NYPD officers who led the Gambino investigation."
