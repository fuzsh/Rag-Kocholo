Gotti strutted around Manhattan and the Gambino family virtually dominated New York City’s organized crime world.\n\nIn the years since, the organization’s power has declined, and apart from a few relatives starring in reality television shows, Gambino bosses have kept a relatively low profile.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the family was vaulted into the spotlight after its reputed boss, Francesco Cali, was fatally shot outside in his home on Staten Island.\n\nThe killing was striking for how it seemed to connect Mr. Cali, a publicity-shy don, with the ill-fated ends of past Mafia bosses."
