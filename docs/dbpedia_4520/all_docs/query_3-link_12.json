After the trial, Tom Andreopoulos, deputy chief federal prosecutor, said that this was the first time in Canada that the 'Ndrangheta was targeted as an organized crime group since 1997, when the Criminal Code was amended to include the offence of criminal organization.[19] He offered this comment about the organization:[20]\n\nWe're talking about structured organized crime. We're talking about a political entity, almost; a culture of crime that colonizes across the sea from Italy to Canada. This is one of the most sophisticated criminal organizations in the world.\n\nQuebec\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Quebec there are two types of Italian organized crime: Cosa Nostra and 'Ndrangheta. While Canadian law enforcement agencies consider the Rizzuto and Cotroni crime families to be separate, the FBI considers them to be sub-units of the Bonanno crime family's Montreal faction.[21]\n\nCotroni crime family – a \"'Ndrangheta\" family, the Calabrian faction – defunct 2000s\n\nCuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan – a Canadian extension of the Sicilian family\n\nRizzuto crime family – a \"Cosa Nostra\" family, the Sicilian faction\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n[edit]\n\nEngland\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Italian mob – led by Charles 'Darby' Sabini during the interwar years.[22]\n\nBert \"Battles\" Rossi – also known as the \"General of Clerkenwell\".
