        "text": "Estimate member count: around 200.\n\nFirst Boss: Vincent Mangano\n\nPrimary rackets: Drug trafficking, loansharking, gambling, extortion, car theft, union corruption, construction, internet fraud, waste management.\n\nBoss: Domenico “Italian Dom” Cefalu\n\nShort history of the family: The Gambino crime family is one of the five La Cosa Nostra families operating in New York City. It was founded after the Castellammarese War and led, at that time, by boss Vincent Mangano. The Italian-American Mafia families formed the Commission to ensure big wars between crime families would be a thing of the past. Also, it would protect mob leaders from getting killed on a whim.\n\nStill, being the leader of the Gambino family was no guarantee for a long and healthy life. Vincent Mangano disappeared in 1951 and is presumed murdered on orders of his underboss Albert Anastasia. As a result, Anastasia assumed power and led the family until he himself was whacked sitting in a barber chair in the barber shop of the Park Sheraton Hotel in 1957.\n\nHis successor was Anastasia’s underboss Carlo Gambino. Though the family was named after him, this was simply a case of authorities, at that time, investigating organized crime and labeling each Cosa Nostra family by using the name of its alleged leader.\n\nRegardless, Gambino deserved to have the family named after him. His reign was extremely successful and he turned his clan into one of – if not the – most powerful crime families in the United States.\n\nAs his life neared its end, Gambino appointed his brother-in-law Paul Castellano as his successor. This caused resentment among the troops as most viewed Castellano as a businessman first and a gangster… not so much. It especially angered an up-and-coming capo named John Gotti.\n\nGotti began plotting a takeover and had his way in 1985 when he orchestrated the murder of Castellano and his underboss Tommy Bilotti. He quickly emerged as boss and refused to hide like most Mafiosi.\n\nKnown as the Dapper Don, Gotti thrived on the media exposure and flaunted his power in the face of law enforcement. He put the Gambino family in the spotlights and turned it into a prime target for local, state, and a bunch of federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nGotti’s reign ended in prison. He tried hanging on to power through his brother Peter and son John Junior, but eventually the Gottis had to step down.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, the Sicilian faction within the Gambino family had enormous influence and placed itself at the head of the group. Bosses Domenico Cefalù and Frank Cali ran the family at a time when law enforcement seemed to know a mobster’s every move and anyone in the family could be a snitch.\n\nPROFILES:\n\nBOSSES:\n\nFrancesco “Franky Boy” Cali (whacked)\n\nDomenico “Italian Dom” Cefalu\n\nPeter Gotti (dead)\n\nJohn “Junior” Gotti (quit the mob – interview 1 – interview 2)\n\nJohn Gotti (dead)\n\nPaul Castellano (whacked)\n\nCarlo Gambino (dead)\n\nVincent Mangano (whacked)\n\nUNDERBOSSES:\n\nArnold “Zeke” Squitieri\n\nSalvatore “Sammy The Bull” Gravano (flipped)\n\nFrancesco Scalice (whacked)\n\nCONSIGLIERI:\n\nFrank Locascio (dead)\n\nCAPI:\n\nAnthony “Tony Pep” Trentacosta (dead)\n\nGene Gotti\n\nAndrew Campos\n\nBartolomeo “Pepe” Vernace (dead)\n\nRobert “Bobby Cabert” Bisaccia (dead)\n\nNicholas “Little Nicky” Corozzo\n\nGeorge DeCicco (dead)\n\nMichael “Mikey Scars” DiLeonardo (flipped)\n\nSOLDIERS:\n\nVincent Squillante (whacked)\n\nAnthony Mascuzzio (whacked)\n\nCarmine Agnello\n\nCharles Carneglia (prison)\n\nSamuel “Little Sammy” Corsaro (dead)\n\nASSOCIATES:\n\nPeter Tuccio\n\nJoseph Gambino (dead)\n\nJoseph “Joe Marco Polo” Chirico\n\nGennaro “Jerry” Bruno\n\nRobert Sasso\n\nAnthony Pandrella\n\nARTICLES:"
