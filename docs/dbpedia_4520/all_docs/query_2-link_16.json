        "text": "Gambino\n\nThe Gambino crime family is one of the \"Five Families\" that control organized crime activity in New York City. It is a part of the United States-wide criminal network known as the Mafia (or Cosa Nostra). The group is named after Carlo Gambino, boss of the family at the time of the McClellan hearings in 1963 when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention. The group's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California. Its illicit activities include labor and construction racketeering, gambling, loansharking, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering, prostitution, murder for hire, solid and toxic waste dumping violations, construction, building and cement violations, fraud and wire fraud, hijacking, pier thefts and fencing.\n\nThe rise of what for a time was the most powerful crime family in America began in 1957, the day Albert Anastasia was assassinated while sitting in a barber chair at the Park-Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan. Experts believe Carlo Gambino helped orchestrate the hit to take over the family. Gambino partnered with Meyer Lansky to control gambling interests in Cuba. The family’s fortunes grew through 1976, when Gambino appointed his brother-in-law, Paul Castellano, as boss. Castellano infuriated upstart capo John Gotti, who orchestrated Castellano's murder in 1985. Gotti's downfall came in 1992, when his underboss Sammy Gravano decided to cooperate with the FBI. Gravano's cooperation brought down Gotti, along with most of the top members of the Gambino family. The family is believed to be currently run by street boss John \"Jackie\" D'Amico.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe origins of the Gambino crime family can be traced back to the emergence of Italian mafioso, Salvatore \"Toto\" D'Aquila upon the New York mafia scene around 1906, which is when D'Aquila's name first appears on police records for running a confidence scam, a racket that requires a great deal of intelligence and patience. D'Aquila had immigrated to the United States as an influential Palermitano mafioso, and quickly used his ties to other mafia leaders across the country to create a network of connections and to gain influence within the Italian-American underworld. By 1910 D'Aquila had become the leader of his own New York–based Sicilian mafia group, one of four that emerged by the mid 1900s.\n\nThese four crime families included D'Aquila's own crime family based in East Harlem, Manhattan, which was also the base of the \"first family\", the Morello crime family. The Morello family was originally led by Giuseppe Morello and his half-brothers, Vincent, Ciro and Nick Terranova, and then by Joe Masseria, who became D'Aquila's biggest rival in New York. Two Brooklyn-based crime families emerged: one was the Castellammarese clan, led by Nicola \"Cola\" Schiro from Roccamena, Sicily (not from Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, where the majority of his Brooklyn crime family members came from), and second was a group led by Alfred Mineo based in Brooklyn. Eventually, two more Mafia groups emerged in New York City during Prohibition: This was a break-away faction from the Morello crime family based in the Bronx and led by Gaetano Reina, who was once aligned with boss Ciro \"The Artichoke King\" Terranova, and the last group formed in the late 1920s based in Brooklyn and led by Joe Profaci. Profaci became boss of one of the Five Families of New York that soon emerged once power in New York's Italian underworld was consolidated and the factions re-structured into the crime families that ruled organized crime in the city and across the country for the next eight decades.\n\nBy the mid 1910s D'Aquila had become the most influential Mafia boss in New York, in part because former New York Mafia \"boss of bosses\", Giuseppe Morello and his brother-in-law and second-in-command, Ignazio Saietta, had been imprisoned for 30 years in 1909 for counterfeiting. D'Aquila continued to amass power and influence within New York's Sicilian underworld and across the nation as his crime family grew in numbers and territory.\n\nThe expansion of the D'Aquila crime family was aided by the decimation of the Brooklyn Camorra led by Neapolitan mafia boss, Don Pellegrino Morano, when Morano and his second-in-command, Alessandro Vollero were imprisoned for life in 1917, following a war with the Morello crime family, which led to the murder of boss Nick Morello (born Terranova) in 1916, for which Morano and Vollero were convicted.\n\nBy the beginning of Prohibition, the remaining Neapolitan Mafia members and the territory once under control of bosses Morano and Vollero were absorbed into the D'Aquila crime family. Soon after the Brooklyn-based Mineo group was also absorbed into Toto D'Aquila's crime family, making it the largest and most influential in New York City. The only remaining rival that D'Aquila needed to fear was the expanding forces and growing influence of boss Giuseppe \"Joe the Boss\" Masseria. Masseria had taken over the Morello crime family interests and territory by 1920, and quickly began to amass a great deal of power and influence, enough to rival D'Aquila by the mid 1920s.\n\nBy the late 1920s D'Aquila and Masseria were headed for a showdown and inevitable war, but Masseria struck first and D'Aquila was killed on October 10, 1928 by Masseria family gunmen. The crime family D'Aquila had led passed into the hands of his second-in-command or underboss, Alfred Mineo and his top lieutenant Steve Ferrigno, who at the height of the Prohibition era commanded the largest and most influential Sicilian crime family in New York City.\n\nThe Castellammarese War, between rival New York bosses Joe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano claimed many victims, including Mineo and Ferrigno who were ambushed and killed on November 5, 1930, outside Ferrigno's home at 759 Pelham Parkway South. It was the latest in a long line of killings on both sides of the war, which ultimately ended with the deaths of both principals - Masseria in April 1931 and Maranzano five months later. The main beneficiary (and organizer of both hits) was Charlie \"Lucky\" Luciano, who rearranged New York's organized crime and established the basis of the \"Five Families\" of New York, which became known as the Commission of the Cosa Nostra.\n\nAfter the Castellammarese War\n\nVincent Mangano\n\nFollowing a brief period under the control of Frank Scalice, the first recognized leader of what became the Gambino family was Vincenzo \"Vincent\" Mangano, an old-school Mafia don in the style of Masseria and Maranzano, but one who was tolerated due to his close ties with Emil Camarda, the vice-president of the International Longshoremen's Association. Through the association, Mangano and the family controlled the New York and Brooklyn waterfront with activities including extortion, union racketeering, and illegal gambling operations including horse betting, running numbers and lotteries\n\nMangano also established the City Democratic Club, ostensibly to promote bedrock American values but in reality as a cover for Murder, Inc., the notorious band of mainly Jewish hitmen who did the bidding of the Italian-American run families, for a price. Phil Mangano was a member, as was Albert Anastasia, known as the \"Lord High Executioner\". Around this time, Carlo Gambino was promoted within the organization, as was another future boss of the family, Gambino's brother-in-law Paul \"Big Paul\" Castellano.\n\nMangano brothers murdered\n\nAnastasia and Mangano never entirely saw eye to eye. Mangano resented that Anastasia had a girl's name, preferred to keep the company of various members of the other families, and on numerous occasions the two almost came to blows. This was only ever going to end badly for Mangano, and in April 1951, Phil Mangano was discovered murdered, while his brother disappeared without a trace. Although it has never been proven, it is generally believed that Vince was murdered by Anastasia.\n\nCalled to answer for the crimes of which he was suspected by the other New York bosses, Anastasia never admitted to his involvement in the deaths of the Manganos but did claim that Vince had been planning to have him killed. He had since begun running the family himself, and few in the organization found themselves inclined to depose one of the most feared killers of the age. Carlo Gambino, a wily character with designs on the leadership himself, maneuvered himself into position as underboss to Anastasia.\n\nAnastasia eliminated\n\nAlbert Anastasia\n\nThe fortunes of the family around this time were closely linked to those of another—that run by Frank Costello, and which is known today as the Genovese crime family. Vito Genovese was the power-hungry Underboss in the family and needed a way to remove the close ties between Costello and Anastasia, which provided solidarity in the National Crime Syndicate for the two bosses.\n\nGenovese thus jumped on the 1952 killing of a Brooklyn man named Arnold Schuster, who Anastasia had killed for the most minor of indiscretions (acting as a prosecution witness against a bank robber Anastasia didn't even know), as evidence that Anastasia was unbalanced and a threat to the syndicate. With Gambino secretly siding with Genovese against his own boss, the wheels were in motion for the removal of Anastasia.\n\nOn October 25, 1957, Anastasia was murdered while sitting in a barber's chair at the Park Sheraton Hotel on West 56th Street. For many years, the murder was believed to have been committed by Joseph \"Crazy Joe\" Gallo. Later, Colombo crime family boss and Gallo foe, Carmine \"Junior\" Persico claimed credit. Modern historians believe that Carlo Gambino ordered caporegime Joseph \"Joe the Blonde\" Biondo to kill Anastasia and Biondo gave the contract to soldier Stephen Armone. On the morning of October 25, 1957 Armone, along with Arnold Wittenburg and Stephen Grammauta, murdered Anastasia in the barbershop of the Park Sheraton Hotel. As Anastasia sat in the barber chair the three assailants rushed in, shoved the barber out of the way, and started shooting. The wounded Anastasia allegedly lunged at his killers, but only hit their reflections in the wall mirror. Anastasia died at the scene. Anastasia's underboss Carlo Gambino took the reins of the family, which from then on bore his name. Biondo was rewarded with the underboss position, which he kept until being demoted in 1965. Stephen Grammauta eventually became a caporegime in the 1990s.\n\nGambino promotes the family\n\nGenovese was sent to prison for 15 years, where he died in 1969. The Gambino family soon became the most powerful crime family in the United States, with close ties to Meyer Lansky's offshore gaming houses in Cuba and the Bahamas, a lucrative business for the Mafia. The failure of Joseph \"Joe Bananas\" Bonanno, the head of the Bonanno crime family and Gambino's top rival, to kill off Gambino and the heads of other New York crime families in the aftermath of the Bonanno War, saw Gambino become the most powerful leader of the \"Five Families\".\n\nGambino allegedly stretched his power as far as to organize the shooting of Joseph Colombo, head of the Colombo crime family, on June 28, 1971. More likely, Colombo shooter Jerome Johnson was a lone nut attracted to Colombo for his Italian civil rights movement. Or as Michael Franzese, an informer later said, it may have been set up by rogue law enforcement, or by Carlo Gambino himself. Colombo survived the shooting but remained in a coma until his death in 1978. He was buried next to Joseph Gallo. Johnson was killed by Colombo's bodyguard.\n\nIn either case, Gambino's influence stretched into behind-the-scenes control of the Lucchese crime family, led by Carmine \"Mr. Gribbs\" Tramunti. Gambino also allegedly influenced the selection of Frank \"Funzi\" Tieri as boss of the Genovese crime family, after the murder of Thomas Eboli, whom Gambino, allegedly, had had killed over a $4 million drug debt.\n\nOn October 15, 1976, Gambino died of a heart attack, and control of the family passed not to the obvious choice, Underboss Aniello \"Mr. Neil\" Dellacroce, but to Paul Castellano, whose sister was married to Gambino. Allies of Dellacroce were thoroughly unhappy about that move, but Dellacroce himself kept his men in line, and was kept on as Castellano's Underboss.\n\nThe FBI closes in on Castellano\n\nPaul Castellano\n\nThe Dellacroce faction remained displeased, believing that Castellano had inherited the role rather than earning it. Castellano did retain a degree of muscle to keep Dellacroce's allies in check, including the notorious crew run by Anthony \"Nino\" Gaggi and Roy DeMeo, which was believed to have committed over 200 murders during Castellano's regime from the late 1970s and mid 1980s. While Castellano was still in charge, most of the family affairs were run and controlled unofficially by a 4 man ruling-panel which included powerful Garment District leader Thomas \"Tommy\" Gambino, bodyguard and later Underboss Thomas \"Tommy\" Bilotti, and powerful Queens faction-leaders Daniel \"Danny\" Marino and James \"Jimmy Brown\" Failla, all top rivals of John Gotti.\n\nIt was not a time for the family to be embroiled in inner turmoil and argument, as the Federal Bureau of Investigation had targeted the Gambino family as the easiest of the five families to infiltrate - FBI tapes obtained from a bug planted in a lamp on Castellano's kitchen table caught him discussing illegal deals with his subordinates, and by the early 1980s Castellano was up on a number of charges and faced with conviction. He let it be known that he wanted Carlo Gambino's son Thomas to take over the family should he be sent to jail, with Thomas Bilotti (Castellano's chauffeur and bodyguard) as his Underboss, which further enraged the Dellacroce faction, particularly John Gotti.\n\nIn 1983, a federal indictment charged 13 members of the Gambino family with drug trafficking. This group included John Gotti's brother, Gene, and his best friend, Angelo \"Quack Quack\" Ruggiero, who got his nickname for his non-stop talking. The feds had in fact been listening in on his home phone conversations since 1980 - they had Ruggiero on tape discussing family business, making drug deals, and expressing contempt for Castellano. If Castellano knew they were dealing drugs, in violation of his no-drug policy, Ruggiero would be killed. By law, the accused were allowed transcripts of wiretap conversations to aid their defense, and Castellano demanded to be shown them, though Dellacroce did his best to put him off\n\nDellacroce was by this time suffering from cancer, but with Ruggiero desperate for help, his friend John Gotti stood up for him. All the same, Castellano maintained that he wanted the transcripts, or he would have Ruggiero and Gotti removed. Gotti realized he had to act fast, and the death of his mentor Dellacroce on December 2, 1985, paved the way for him to take out Castellano.\n\nJohn Gotti takes over\n\nJohn Gotti\n\nOn December 16, 1985, Bilotti and Castellano arrived at the Sparks Steak House in Manhattan for a dinner meeting with capo Frank DeCicco. As the two men were exiting their car, four unidentified men shot them to death. Right after the shootings, John Gotti proclaimed him the new boss of the Gambino crime family. Gotti appointed DeCicco as underboss and promoted Ruggiero to caporegime. At that time, future underboss Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano was allegedly elevated to caporegime.\n\nKnown as the \"Dapper Don,\" Gotti was well-known for his hand-tailored suits and silk ties. Unlike his colleagues, Gotti made little effort to hide his mob connections and was very willing to provide interesting sound bites to the media. Gotti's home in Howard Beach, Queens, was frequently seen on television. Gotti liked to hold meetings with family members while walking in public places so that law enforcement agents could not record the conversations. One of Gotti's neighbors in Howard Beach was his dear friend Joseph \"Big Joe\" Massino, underboss of the Bonanno crime family. Another of Gotti's neighbors, John Favara, accidentally killed Gotti's 12-year-old son in a traffic crash. Soon after the boy's death, Favara was kidnapped and murdered\n\nMob leaders from the other families were enraged at the Castellano murder and disapproved of Gotti's high-profile style. Gotti's strongest enemy was Genovese crime family boss Vincent \"The Chin\" Gigante, a former Castellano ally. Ironically, Gigante had participated in the last unsanctioned hit on a Cosa Nostra boss, that of Frank Costello in 1957. Gigante allegedly conspired with Lucchese crime family leaders Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso and Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso, to put out a contract on Gotti's life. On April 13, 1986, a car bomb meant for Gotti instead killed DeCicco.\n\nEventually, Gotti's brash demeanor and belief that he was untouchable (he was acquitted on federal charges three times, earning the nickname the \"Teflon Don\") proved his undoing. The FBI had managed to bug an apartment above the Ravenite Social Club in Little Italy, where an elderly widow let mobsters hold top-level meetings. Gotti was heard planning criminal activities and complaining about his underlings. In particular, he complained about Gravano, portraying him as a \"mad dog\" killer. Gravano responded by turning state's evidence and testifying against Gotti.\n\nOn April 2, 1992, largely on the strength of Gravano's testimony, Gotti and current Consigliere Frank \"Frankie Loc\" LoCascio were convicted and received a sentence of life without parole.\n\nThe family since Gotti\n\nGotti continued to rule the family from prison, while day-to-day operation of the family shifted to capos John \"Jackie Nose\" D'Amico and Nicholas \"Little Nick\" Corozzo. The latter was due to take over as acting boss but was himself sentenced to eight years in prison on racketeering charges. Gotti's son, John \"Junior\" Gotti, took over as head of the family, but in 1998 he too was convicted of racketeering and sentenced to 77 months in jail.\n\nWhen Gotti Sr died in prison in 2002, his brother Peter took over as boss, allegedly alongside D'Amico, but the family's fortunes have dwindled to a remarkable extent given their power a few short decades ago, when they were considered the most powerful criminal organization on earth. Peter Gotti was imprisoned as well in 2003, as the leadership allegedly went to the current administration members, Nicholas Corozzo, Jackie D'Amico and Joseph Corozzo.\n\nAs former rivals of John Gotti took completely over the Gambino family, mostly because the rest of Gotti's loyalists were either jailed or under indictments, and that Gotti, Sr died in prison in 2002, then-current head of white collar crimes and caporegime, Michael \"Mikey Scars\" DiLeonardo turned state's evidence due to increased law enforcement and credible evidence toward his racketeering trial, and was forced to testify against mobsters from all of the Five Families. One of the last Gotti supporters, DiLeonardo testified against among others Peter Gotti and Anthony \"Sonny\" Ciccone from 2003 to 2005, and disappeared into the Witness Protection Program. At the same time, Sammy Gravano, Gotti's former Underboss, had evaded the program in 1995 and was arrested and jailed for operating an Ecstasy-ring that stretched from Arizona to New York City in 2003. During that same year, he was sentenced to 19 years in prison, ironically due to informants amongst his associates.\n\nIn 2005, Nicholas Corozzo and his longtime underling Leonard \"Lenny\" DiMaria were released from prison after serving ten years for racketeering and loansharking charges in New York and Florida. That same year, US law enforcement recognized Corozzo as the Boss of the Gambino crime family, with his brother Joseph Corozzo as the family Consigliere, Arnold \"Zeke\" Squitieri as the acting Underboss and Jackie D'Amico as a highly regarded member with the Corozzo brothers.\n\nJack Falcone\n\nRetired FBI agent, Joaquin Garcia infiltrated the Gambino crime family under the alias of Jack Falcone beginning in 2002. Greg DePalma, the Gambino family capo, offered Garcia the position of made man. However, the FBI investigation ceased in 2005 when Garcia's cover was in danger of being blown. But, with sufficient evidence to convict DePalma and several other high-ranking mafiosi, DePalma was arrested and convicted to twelve years in federal prison thanks in large part to Garcia's efforts.\n\nOperation Old Bridge\n\nOn Thursday, February 7, 2008, an indictment and four-year-long FBI investigation known as Operation Old Bridge was issued, leading to 54 people affiliated with the Gambino crime family being arrested that very day in New York City and its northern suburbs, New Jersey and Long Island. A federal grand jury later that day accused 62 people of having ties to the Gambino crime family and offenses such as murders, conspiracy, drug trafficking, robberies, extortion and other crimes were included in the indictment. By the end of the week, more than 80 people were indicted in the Eastern District of New York. The case is now referred to as United States of America v. Agate et al. It was assigned to Judge Nicholas Garaufis. The FBI was able to collect the needed information through informant Joseph Vollero, the owner of a truck company on Staten Island, who secretly recorded several conversations between him and members of the Gambino family about three years prior to when the indictment was handed out.\n\nAmong the arrested were the current Gambino crime family leaders John \"Jackie Nose\" D'Amico, Joseph \"Jo Jo\" Corozzo and Domenico \"Italian Dom\" Cefalu, including Gambino family caporegime Leonard \"Lenny\" DiMaria, Francesco \"Frank\" Cali, Thomas \"Tommy Sneakers\" Cacciopoli. However, recognized captain and co-acting boss Nicholas \"Little Nick\" Corozzo, one of the main indicted in the case, fled his home on Long Island, acting on prior knowledge, and was considered a fugitive by US law enforcement until his arrest before turning himself in on May 29, 2008 after almost four months on the run.\n\nThe federal operation broke up a growing alliance between the Gambinos and the Sicilian Mafia, who wanted to get further into the drug trade. One of those arrested in the raids in the US was Frank Cali, a captain in the Gambino family. He is allegedly the \"ambassador\" in the US for the Inzerillo crime family.\n\nCurrent position and leadership\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, federal authorities successfully prosecuted the Gambino administration, several capos, and many soldiers and associates. Since both federal and New York State authorities rounded up the entire Gambino family hierarchy in early 2008, there is an apparent power-vacuum in the Gambino family. Many speculate the new acting boss is the legendary Castellano-loyalist Daniel \"Danny\" Marino of the Queens faction of the family. Fresh out of jail, Carmine Agnello is also being watched very closely.\n\nA March 2009 article in the New York Post stated that a three-man panel of street bosses Daniel \"Danny\" Marino, John Gambino and Bartolomeo \"Bobby\" Vernace was running the Gambino family while the administration members were in prison. The article also stated that the family included of approximately 260 \"made\" members. Both street boss Jackie D'Amico and acting underboss Domenico Cefalu had finished serving prison terms on November 3, 2009, but D'Amico was kept in custody and pled guilty to new charges that will keep him in prison for up to three more years.\n\nIn 2009, former National Basketball Association (NBA) referee Tim Donaghy said that Gambino associate James Battista used Donaghy's knowledge of NBA games to pick winners in illegal sports gambling. Today the Gambino family still controls the piers in Brooklyn and Staten Island through infiltrating labor unions. A pair of indictments in 2009 and 2010, respectively, show the family is still very active in New York City.\n\nOn November 18, 2009, the NYPD arrested 22 members and associates of the Lucchese and Gambino crime families as part of \"Operation Pure Luck\". The raid was a result of cases involving loan sharking and sports gambling on Staten Island. There were also charges of bribing New York City court officers and Sanitation Department officials. On April 20, 2010, Gambino capo Daniel Marino and thirteen other members/associates were arrested and indicted for numerous criminal activities. In additions to the racketeering charges, the fourteen defendants were charged with murder, sex trafficking, sex trafficking of a minor, jury tampering, extortion, assault, wire fraud, narcotics trafficking, loan-sharking and gambling.\n\nHistorical leadership of the Gambino crime family\n\nBosses (official and acting)\n\n* 1910–1928 — Salvatore \"Toto\" D'Aquila (by the start of Prohibition what was left of the Brooklyn Camorra and the Al Mineo group had merged with the D'Aquila's group to form the largest family in New York. D'Aquila was killed on orders of boss Joe Masseria in 1928)\n\n* 1928–1930 — Alfred \"Al Mineo\" Manfredi (killed in Castellammarese War 1930)\n\n* 1930–1931 — Francesco \"Frank/Don Cheech\" Scalise (demoted after murder of boss of all bosses Salvatore Maranzano)\n\n* 1931–1951 — Vincenzo \"Vincent\" Mangano (disappeared in April 1951, allegedly killed on orders of underboss Albert Anastasia)\n\n* 1951–1957 — Albert \"Mad Hatter\" Anastasia (murdered in October 1957 on orders of underboss Carlo Gambino)\n\n* 1957–1976 — Carlo \"The Godfather\" Gambino (died of natural causes 1976)\n\no Acting 1974–1976 — Paul Castellano (acting boss during Gambino's illness, became official boss after his death)\n\n* 1976–1985 — Paul \"Big Paul\" Castellano (killed on orders of capo John Gotti)\n\n* 1985–2002 — John \"Dapper Don\" Gotti Sr. (imprisoned in 1990, died in 2002)\n\no Acting 1992–1999 — John A.

At that time, Gambino was Anastasia's new underboss and Vito Genovese was the underboss for Costello. Their first target was Costello on May 2, 1957. Costello survived the assassination attempt, but immediately decided to retire as boss in favor of Genovese. Their second target was Anastasia on October 25, 1957. The Gallo brothers (from the Colombo family) murdered Anastasia in a Manhattan barber shop, opening the was for Gambino to become the new boss of the now-Gambino crime family. After assuming power, Gambino started conspiring with Lucchese to remove their former ally Genovese. In 1959, with the assistance of Luciano, Costello, and Meyer Lansky, Genovese was arrested and Gambino assumed full control with Lucchese of the Mafia Commission. Under Gambino and Lucchese, the Commission pushed Bonanno boss Joseph Bonanno out of power, triggering an internal war in that family. In the 1960s, the Commission backed the Gallo brothers in their rebellion against Profaci family boss Joe Profaci. In 1962, Gambino's oldest son Thomas married Lucchese's daughter, strengthening the Gambino and Lucchese family alliance. Lucchese gave Gambino access into the New York airports rackets he controlled, and Gambino allowed Lucchese into some of their rackets. After Lucchese death in July 1967, Gambino used his power over the Commission to appoint Carmine Tramunti as the new Lucchese family leader. Gambino later continued the alliance with Tramunti's successor, Anthony Corallo. After Gambino's death, new Gambino boss Paul Castellano continued the Lucchese alliance. In 1985, the original Gambino-Lucchese alliance dissolved when John Gotti ordered Castellano's assassination and took power in the Gambino family without Commission approval.\n\n* The Gambino-Lucchese alliance (1999–present) was initiated by acting Lucchese boss Steven Crea in 1999.

The members were arrested in 2005 leaving to reveal that Gambino acting Capo DePalma had allowed an FBI agent Joaquin Garcia (know as Jack Falcone) work undercover with his crew since 2002.

Merola was indicted in 2008 and Taccetta was returned to prison in 2009.\n\n* The Gambino-Genovese alliance (1962–1972) was between Carlo Gambino and Genovese family acting boss/front boss Tomas Eboli. The alliance was short-lived because Eboli was unable or unwilling to repay Gambino money from a bad narcotics deal. The alliance ended when Gambino ordered Eboli's murder on July 16, 1972.\n\n* The Gambino-Bonanno alliance (1991–2004) started with John Gotti and new Bonanno boss Joseph Massino. As a member of the Mafia Commission, Gotti helped Massino regain the Bonanno commission seat that was lost in the early 1970s. The Gambino family influenced the Bonanno family to give up narcotics trafficking and return to more traditional Cosa Nostra crimes (loan sharking, gambling, stock fraud, etc.) By the late 1990s, the Bonannos had become almost as strong as the Gambinos.\n\n* The Gambino-Westies alliance (1970s-present), The alliance started when the Genovese family went to war with the Westies over control of construction at the Jacob Javits site which Genovese family front boss Anthony \"Fat Tony\" Salerno wanted to control.
