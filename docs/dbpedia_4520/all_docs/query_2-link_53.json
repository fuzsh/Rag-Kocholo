        "text": "Vinny Fiore says he just builds homes\n\nGoshen — Vinny Fiore builds houses.\n\nAt least, that's what he told a federal judge. He runs a construction and remodeling company with his wife, Desiree, and they live with their three kids in sleepy little Goshen.\n\nHis lawyer said in court that Fiore made $25,000 to $35,000 last year. If that isn't exactly setting the world on fire in the hot Orange County real estate market, at least it's an honest living.\n\nWhich is a far cry from what the U.S. Attorney's Office says about Vinny Fiore.\n\nThe feds say Fiore's a gangster, a \"made man\" in the Gambino crime family. On June 28, they'll ask a judge to put him in prison for smacking around a club owner during a shakedown attempt.\n\nProsecutors say Fiore, 42, is an enforcer for a crew of wiseguys out of Bridgeport, Conn., and New York City. His bosses are the heirs to John Gotti's throne, and Fiore is a soldier in the family, prosecutors say.\n\nOn April 4, Fiore pleaded guilty to his role in a federal racketeering case that netted 18 wiseguys in three states involved in cocaine dealing, gambling, extortion and punishment beatings.\n\nHe's been held without bail in a Rhode Island prison since his arrest last September, deemed too dangerous to be released before trial.\n\nBefore his arrest, no one around here had ever heard of him. According to his lawyer, Fiore moved from the Bronx to 78 Maple Ave. in Goshen in 1998.\n\nIt's in a sedate neighborhood off Route 17M, on a 66-acre parcel. Fiore's development company recently won approval to subdivide that land into 17 lots.\n\nNeither town nor village police have had any dealings with Fiore.\n\n\"I don't know anything about him — never heard the name,\" said Honey Bernstein, the plugged-in town supervisor.\n\nUnlike other gangsters who've made their homes here, Fiore has kept a low profile.\n\nSince his arrival here, Fiore's Venice Land Development Co. has put up small subdivisions, like the six-unit Meadows of Goshen on School House Road, and two homes on Carboy Road in Mount Hope, down the street from the federal prison in Otisville.\n\nState records list Fiore as the manager of Venice Land Development LLC.\n\nHERE'S WHAT THE FBI says Fiore's other job is like:\n\nOn Aug. 5, 2003, Fiore went looking to collect protection money — $30,000 just to start with, and then a straight $200 a week — from a Connecticut nightclub owner, according to FBI reports in court papers. Fiore beat up the man when he protested. Sent the guy's 73-year-old dad to the hospital, too.\n\nA month before the beating, the FBI says, Fiore met with other wiseguys at an unknown location. He pricked his trigger finger, held a burning card with the image of a saint in his cupped hands and swore he'd kill to protect La Cosa Nostra. He was then accepted as a soldier in the Gambino family of the American Mafia, the outfit made infamous by the late John Gotti.\n\nVincent Fiore, the house builder from Goshen's Maple Avenue, was now a made guy.\n\n\"The government's talking all about organized crime and the like, but I can tell you that my client has been gainfully and lawfully employed his entire life,\" his lawyer, Thomas Lee, told a federal judge last September.\n\nLee didn't return phone calls for this story. Earlier this year, Lee said he never discusses pending cases with reporters.\n\nFiore even has a college education: a bachelor's degree in finance from Mercy College in Westchester County. He has spent the last 14 years in the New York construction scene, Lee told a judge.\n\nBut Fiore also picked up an arrest sheet. He was convicted of a weapons charge in New York City in the early 1990s.\n\nHis roots in organized crime aren't spelled out in government filings for the federal racketeering case. Mafia members routinely spend years as \"associates,\" proving their value and loyalty to a crime family before being \"made.\"\n\nIn court documents, Lee says Fiore moved to Goshen in 1998, the same time many Bronx residents were discovering Orange County's appeal.\n\nBY THAT TIME, a Connecticut faction of the Gambino family was picking up the pieces of the organization shattered by Gotti's imprisonment. Gotti died in prison in 2002.\n\nAnthony Megale, a caporegime, or captain, in the Gambino family, was known to his peers as \"The Genius.\" As the new No. 2 man in the family, Megale controlled all the bookmaking, extortion, protection, drugs and other Gambino rackets in Connecticut, according to the FBI. New York gangsters referred to Megale as \"Tony Connecticut.\"\n\nOne of the crews working for Megale was headed by Victor Riccitelli, now 72. Riccitelli was involved in cocaine dealing, illegal gambling and the Mafia's age-old money-maker, protection, according to federal court documents. Riccitelli used Fiore as muscle, prosecutors say.\n\nBut Tony Connecticut's reign was brief.\n\nIn September 2004, Megale, Riccitelli, Fiore and 15 others were indicted on racketeering charges in Connecticut.\n\nRiccitelli was then convicted in a separate federal cocaine case. Megale was charged in a second racketeering case out of New York, along with his Gambino boss, Arnold \"Zeke\" Squitieri.\n\nBy April, the new Gambino leaders were all in prison, and Goshen's made guy, Fiore, had pleaded guilty to the single shakedown charge.\n\nIt's not the only recent violent act prosecutors attribute to Fiore.\n\nIn phone conversations recorded by the FBI, Riccitelli berated another Mafia crew chief for using Fiore to handle a dispute with an unnamed Connecticut contractor over some construction equipment.\n\nNic Melia, a 72-year-old Mafioso known as \"The Old Man\" and \"The Greaseball,\" had two men assault the contractor in the parking lot of an Off-Track Betting parlor in Bridgeport last July, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors told a judge the phone conversations make clear that Fiore was one of the two assailants. But the contractor said he could not make a positive identification.\n\n\"Perhaps that's because his jaw was broken in the assault,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Gustafson said in court last year.\n\nFIORE'S PLEA AGREEMENT doesn't require him to admit membership in the Mafia, which was once a traditional — and humiliating — part of mob plea deals.\n\nNor does it ask for any forfeiture of ill-gotten assets. Fiore is expected to get a prison sentence of 27 to 33 months. With time already served, he could return to his four-bedroom, three-bathroom, double-lot home on Maple Avenue by early 2007.\n\nThe home is valued at $595,000, and the land it's on is approved for those 17 new house lots.\n\nNot bad for a guy who cleared $35,000 last year."
