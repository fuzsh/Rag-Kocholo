        "text": "Address: 234 Bowery\n\nStatus: In business\n\nBy the early 1980s, the mafia’s last generation of godfathers were in serious trouble. Hounded by state and Federal anti-organized crime units and a new law called RICO, the old but wiley mob bosses relied on an elaborate system of clandestine meetings and secret conferences to manage their elicit kingdoms.\n\nKnow as The Commission, the dons of the Five Families met to approve murders, settle beefs, air grievances, make new members, and most importantly, to divide the proceeds from the biggest cement and construction jobs in New York City.\n\nThe feds wanted to bust up the Mafia Commission with the help of RICO, but first they had to catch the bosses in the act. With over 300 Special Agents, 100 NYPD organized crime detectives and the New York State Organized Crime Task Force, chasing the Commission often got chaotic. On June 13, 1983 the FBI, NYPD, and NY State Organized Crime Task Force were literally tripping over themselves to surveil a Commission meeting set for the Bari Restaurant Supply Company located on the Bowery.\n\nThe Concrete Club\n\nThe dons knew the meetings were risky, but in the name of greed, the meetings were essential to divide the plunder from all major cement work in New York City. According to According to FBI agent Jules Bonavolonta:\n\n“On any cement work in New York over $2 million, only six firms, all of them previously selected by the Cosa Nostra, would be allowed to bid. In exchange for that privilege of bidding on the jobs, the six firms had to pay the Colombo, Gambino, Lucchese, and the Genovese Families two points on every contract…”– Jules Bonavolonta, The Good Guys\n\nFrom top to bottom, the Five Families squeezed the New York cement industry, controlling the unions, the contractors, the construction companies and the people who owned them. Gambino chieftain, Paul Castellano, ruled over Local 282, the Concrete Divers Union. With little more than a nod of his aquiline head, Castellano could shut down a jobsite by having drivers refuse to pour cement, letting it solidify in the trucks. Mafia turncoat Fish Cafaro later recalled in a Senate hearing:\n\n“So many jobs, and so many were given out. And everybody got a piece of the action. Every family’s representative that was there got a job. With the contractors. Or for the contractors.” —Fish Cafaro, Mafia turncoat (Click to read his testimony)\n\nThe Genovese, Gambino, Lucchese, and Colombo families would divide all profits on all projects over $2 million. By 1983, the Five Families held New York’s construction industry in a stranglehold.\n\nTony Ducks and the Bugged Jaguar\n\nEarlier that year, Ronald Goldstock and the NY Organized Crime Task Force’s spymasters planted a bug in the Sal Avellino’s Jaguar. As chauffeur to Tony Ducks Corallo, boss of the Lucchese Family, the bug would topple the Luccheses and inadvertently alert the FBI to the meeting at the Bari Restaurant Supply Company.\n\nOn June 14, a horde of investigators and a hovering helicopter, tailed Avallino, Corallo, and underboss Tom Mix Santoro through the back streets of Manhattan. The Feds had no idea where the trail would end, but they needed photographic evidence of a Commission meeting to build a RICO case. The trail ended at Bari. Fish Cafaro reminisced,\n\n“It was in Bari’s on Houston Street…They sell restaurant equipment.”–Fish Cafaro, Mafia informant (Click to read his testimony)\n\nThe Mafia Commission Meeting at Bari\n\nHuddled among the pizza ovens and industrial mixing bowls, the leaders of the Five Families gathered to discuss the business of crime. There was Jerry Lang and Donny Shacks for the Colombo Family and Big Paul Castellano and Joe Gallo from the Gambinos. Tony Ducks Corallo and Tom Mix Santoro represented the Lucchese Family, while Vincent the Chin Gigante and Fat Tony Salerno represented the Genovese Family. Outside, the FBI, NYPD and New York State Organized Crime Task Force prowled around the restaurant depot.\n\nThe Dons Scatter\n\nFrom the inside, Big Paul Castellano spotted Joseph O’Brien, a hulking six-foot-five FBI agent, peering through Bari’s plate glass window. O’Brien had been stalking Castellano for months, the Gambino boss immediately recognized him and sounded the alarm. Fish Cafaro recalled,\n\n“He [Fat Tony] says, there was the agents there…He says, I had to go through a window…they had to push me through the window to get out. He couldn’t fit; he was too fat.” Fish Cafaro, Mafia informant (Click to read his testimony)\n\nThe mafia dons scattered into the street, narrowly avoiding the agents, but time was running out for Cosa Nostra. At the next Commission meeting, the bosses wouldn’t be so lucky.\n\nThe Commission Case\n\nOn November 19, 1986, the Feds slapped Tony Salerno and the rest of the Mafia Commission members with 100 year prison sentences for their involvement with the Concrete Club and other illicit enterprises, breaking the power structure of Cosa Nostra.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAddress:870 7th Avenue\n\nStatus: Starbucks\n\nNow a Starbucks like everything else in New York City, the old barbershop in the Park Central Sheraton Hotel may be one of the most infamous spots in Manhattan. The Park Sheraton hosted two of Manhattan’s most notorious mob hits. On November 4th, 1928, Arnold Rothstein walked into the Park Central’s front door and few hours later he spilled out of the service entrance with a bullet in his gut (click to read the Death of Arnold Rothstein). 29 years later, the Park Central would see blood again, but this time in its barbershop.\n\nAlbert Anastasia’s Last Shave\n\nAt 10:30 A.M., October 25, 1957, Albert Anastasia, the highlord executioner of the mob and retired CEO of Murder Inc., strutted into Grasso’s Barber shop in The Park Sheraton Hotel with his pint sized godson and protege, Vincent Squillante. The duo plopped down into barber chairs (now in the Mob Museum) and ordered shaves and haircuts, unusual behavior considering a massive mob war had just been averted.\n\nAnastasia nearly went to the mattresses five months earlier by declaring war on Vito Genovese for an attempted rubout of Frank Costello (Click to read the story about Frank Costello). After threatening scorched-earth revenge, The Highlord Executioner had assurances from the Five Families that there would be no bloodshed. According to Joseph Bonanno:\n\n“…Anastasia and Genovese met at a select dinner gathering… Albert and Vito exchanged accusations and made counter charges. They clarified and rationalized their positions. But at last, though reluctantly, they renounced going to war against each other. The rest of us raised our glasses in a toast for peace. Albert and Vito kissed each other on the cheek.” – Joseph Bonanno, Man of Honor\n\nNow at the apex of his power, Anastasia sat back and let his barber cover his face with piping hot towels. The bad blood had coagulated and Genovese could be trusted, or so Anastasia thought. According to Bonanno, Albert finally conquered his explosive temper. He had matured, and it would cost him his life.\n\nThe Trifecta: Gambino, Genovese, Lucchese\n\nRather than blood feuding with Genovese, Anastasia spent the next few months expanding his empire into Cuban casinos with Santos Trafficante and built a mansion in Fort Lee., while Genovese maneuvered to overthrow the CEO of Murder Inc.\n\nGenovese and Lucchese crept through the underworld seeking tacit approval for the death of Anastasia. They contacted Meyer Lansky and wooed Carlo Gambino, Anastasia’s underboss, to set up Anastasia’s downfall.\n\nThe Missing Bodyguard\n\nFor a man who dealt in death his entire life, Al Anastasia threw caution to the wind. Arrested for homicide six times with diverse weapons which ranged from ice picks to revolvers, Anastasia perfected the unsolvable mob hit and the “one way ride”.\n\nDespite the homicidal resume, Anastasia had gotten lax. On the day of his assassination, his bodyguard and chauffeur, Anthony Copolla, was nowhere to be found. Copolla dropped Anastasia off at the barbershop, parked the Chevy in a lot and never returned. Even more unthinkable, the mobster took a barber chair with his back facing the door. A setup loomed and the new mature Anastasia missed the tell-tale signs.\n\nThe Barbershop Quintet\n\nThe attack was a classic mob hit. Two identically dressed gunmen hidden beneath aviator sunglasses, fedoras, and scarves wrapped around their faces walked into the hotel lobby. A wheelman and lookout in the lobby were waiting for them outside.\n\nEntering from the lobby, the gunmen walked around a partition which screens the shop’s chairs and walked directly to Chair No. 4, taking aim at Anastasia’s back. One hitman strode to the left of Anastasia and pushed aside the barber with the muzzle of his gun. The other killer strode to Anastasia’s right. Suddenly, they opened fire with their .32 and .38 caliber revolvers.\n\nFive bullets tore into the mafia chieftain. Dazed, Anastasia lunged at his own reflection in the mirror before collapsing into a heap of bloody towels. The hit squad fled through the lobby sparing both the barber, and Squillante, Anastasia’s protege, who yelped, “Let me outta here!”\n\nWho Murdered Anastasia?\n\nThe police never apprehended the mob hitmen and the crime remains unsolved. According to New York magazine, a police informant named Sidney Slater claimed Crazy Joe Gallo bragged that the rubout was the handywork of his hit team. According to New York Magazine, Crazy Joe remarked:\n\n“From now on Sidney… You can just call the five of us the barbershop quintet.” New York Magazine, 1972- The Mafia at War.\n\nUnsanctioned by the Mafia Commission, the hit squad consisted of Crazy Joe Gallo, Joseph Gioielli, Carmine Persico, Albert Gallo and an unidentified co-conspirator.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAddress: 247 Mulberry Street\n\nStatus: Shoe Store http://cydwoq-ny.com/\n\nOn first glance, 247 Mulberry Street looks like nothing more than another high-end boutique in NoLita, but the cracked tiled floors of the CYDWOQ shoe store offers a glimpse back to the days when the mob ruled New York. Once a mafia nerve center entrenched in the core of Little Italy, the Ravenite Social Club hosted the Anastasia and later Gambino Crime Family for 66 years.\n\nThe Knights of Alto Social Club\n\nThe mafia social club started life in 1926 as the Knights of Alto Social Club. A regular den of thieves, patrons included Lucky Luciano, Carlo Gambino, Albert Anastasia and his chief enforcer, Aniello Dellacroce. Tzar of the Brooklyn docks, Albert Anastasia operated the Knights of Alto Social club as his Manhattan outpost and drop off point for pay offs.\n\nFather O’Neil Dellacroce\n\nNeil Dellacroce, an old time Murder Inc. hitman, made his bones with Anastasia in the wild days of prohibition. The mobster, who lived across the street from the Ravenite, had a slew of nicknames including Neil, Mr. Neil, O’Neil, The Polack, The Tall Guy and most interestingly: Father O’Neil on account of the time he went on a hit dressed like a Roman Catholic Priest. According to NYPD Detective Ralph Salerno:\n\n“You looked at Dellacroce’s eyes and you could see how frightening they were…The frigid glare of a killer.” Organized Crime Detective Ralph Salerno\n\nThe 1963 Organized Crime and Illicit Traffic in Narcotics hearings had this to say about Mr. Neil:\n\n“Aniello Dellacroce, he is known as O’Neil. He is in gambling, shylocking, and extortion and strong arm. He has 10 arrests, 5 convictions…he has been involved in floating dice games, gambling, shylocking. He was involved with Al Anastiasia in Cuba in gambling and dice.” –Hearings on Organized Crime and Illicit Traffic in Narcotics, 1963\n\nThe Ravenite Under New Management:\n\nAfter Carlo Gambino and Vito Genovese toppled Albert Anastasia, Gambino purchased 247 Mulberry Street, renamed the club the Ravenite and installed Dellacroce as his underboss. The relationship proved to be incredibly lucrative with Gambino providing the brains and Mr. Neil providing the trigger-men. With Dellacroce’s help Gambino inched his way into total control of the Mafia Commission. By the time of his death in 1976, the Gambino Family boasted 500 made men and thousands of associates, but with Carlo gone, a chasm threatened to rip the Gambino’s in half.\n\nShowdown With Big Paul Castellano\n\nOn his deathbed, Don Carlo named his son in law Big Paul Castellano the new boss of the Gambino family. A schism immediately erupted between the Dellacroce’s blue collar soldiers and Castalano’s white collar followers. Big Paul had dreams of taking the Gambino’s legitimate, but Mr. Neil’s followers preferred gunplay and drug dealing.\n\nTo prevent an underworld war, Dellacroce swore fealty to Castellano and all was well in mob land. Around this time, Dellacroce would take an up-and-coming hoodlum named John Gotti under his wing. The Queens based Gotti would do much to exacerbate the friction between Mr. Neil and Big Paul. Gotti openly trafficked narcotics, despite Castellano’s ban, punishable by burial in the East River.\n\nBy the mid-1980’s the center did not hold. Dying of cancer Dellacroce, Castellano, and the rest of the Mafia Commission were facing a RICO trial with 100 year prison sentences. After the death of Dellacroce, Gotti struck, rubbing out Big Paul.\n\nThe Short Reign of Gotti\n\nTo celebrate his status as the new Gambino chieftain, Gotti picked up his headquarters, moving it from Queens to the Ravenite in 1985. With Castellano in the morgue and the other bosses imprisoned for 100 years, Gotti became the FBI’s top target. Gambino capos paraded in and out of the Ravenite to give Gotti their blessings as the new boss, providing FBI surveillance teams with a road map of the Gambino Family. However, the FBI needed more, they needed wiretaps.\n\nThe Ravenite Gets Bugged\n\nTo take Gotti down, the FBI knew it needed to penetrate the Teflon Don’s inner sanctum: The Ravenite. Jim Kallestrom’s FBI electronics wizards bugged the club in 1988 but their recordings proved to be fruitless. According to Jules Bonavolonta’s The Good Guys:\n\n“Once it was in, however, the thing was virtually worthless. Gotti and his boys played jazz and old show tunes on a radio—constantly… ”-Jules Bonavolonta, The Good Guys\n\nThe paranoid gangsters even went as far as to install a white noise machine to further thwart FBI bugs. Bruce Mouw’s Agents listened and waited. Gotti it seemed disappeared for long stretches of time and nothing incriminating was recorded.\n\nPerplexed, the agents questioned their informants and discovered whenever Gotti needed to discuss “real heavy stuff” he exited the Ravenite. Using a side door that entered into the apartment building’s hallway, Gotti crept to an apartment on the third floor rented by the widow of a former wiseguy.\n\nAn FBI special operations team planted wiretaps in this apartment and hit paydirt. In this inner sanctum, Gotti discussed murders, mayhem and a bevy of other crimes with his top henchmen, Sammy the Bull Gravano and Frankie Loc Locascio. The Teflon Don was convicted in 1992 of murder, illegal gambling, bribery, tax evasion and a host of other crimes. Federal Marshals later seized the building and auctioned it off to the highest bidder.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nLittle Italy Mafia Walking Tour Map\n\nLittle more than a 3-block tourist trap, New York’s Little Italy is on the verge of extinction. With Chinatown closing in from the east and SoHo gobbling up its southern real estate, only the section of Mulberry Street between Broom and Canal remain visibly Italian. Gone too is the dreaded presence of the Mafia which was once inextricably woven into the fabric of daily life. This Mafia walking tour will take you back to the days when mobsters, rather than hipsters, ruled the streets of Little Italy.\n\n1 Giuseppe “The Clutch Hand” Morello’s Spaghetti Restaurant\n\nAddress: 8 Prince Street\n\nStatus: Standing\n\nHe was the patriarch of the first America Crime Family. A Sicilian bandit with a deformed right hand, Giuseppe Morello earned his nickname “the Clutch Hand” from his twisted talon. The undisputed boss of Manhattan’s uptown and downtown Italian districts, Morello led a vicious band of old world cutthroats from a spaghetti parlor at 8 Prince Street. Morello’s gang included his half brother Ciro Terranova, the self styled “Artichoke King”, his second in command and brother-in-law Ignazio “Lupo the Wolf” Saietta, his chief enforcer Tomaso Petto the Ox, and a multitude of kinfolk.\n\nMurder, robbery and Black Hand extortion, the Mafiosi did it all, but counterfeiting was their art, a passion that would lead to a gristly murder at 8 Prince Street. On April 14, 1903, Benedetto Madonia, one of The Clutch Hand’s counterfeiters, was stabbed to death, stuffed into a barrel and unceremoniously dumped on East 11th Street as a gangland message. However, the message proved to be too strong and both the Secret Service and Joseph Petrosino, a rising star in the NYPD, would be on Morello’s trail, ultimately bringing about his downfall.\n\n2 Lupo The Wolf’s Import Market\n\nAddress: 9 Prince Street\n\nStatus: Standing\n\nAs ferocious as his namesake, Lupo The Wolf was a terrorist long before the word became fashionable. Through violence, bombings, Black Hand letters and murder, he extorted everyone and everything in turn-of-the-century Little Italy. Related by marriage to Clutch Hand Morello, Lupo became head of Downtown Little Italy for the Italian Harlem based Morello. Lupo operated one of many grocery stores he owned from 9 Prince Street.\n\n3 Barrel Murder Arrest\n\nAddress: Bowery and Delancy Street\n\nHoping to smash Morello’s counterfeiting ring and solve the Barrel Murder, the Secret Service and Joe Petrosino pounced on Petto the Ox and Giuseppe Morello on the corner of Bowery and Delancey Street. The Mafiosi were armed to the teeth with daggers and licensed revolvers. Unfortunately, the charges did not stick to Morello, but a pawn ticket for Benedetto Madonia’s watch linked Petto the Ox to the Barrel Murder. The mafia enforcer disappeared while on bail and was never imprisoned for the crime.\n\n4 Joe Petrosino Square\n\nKenmare and Spring Street\n\nStatus: NYC Park\n\nWhen it came to New York firsts, Lt. Joseph Petrosino could claim many. He was the NYPD’s first Italian speaking officer, the first Italian American on the Force to obtain the rank of lieutenant, and the first, and only, NYPD officer killed on foreign soil. The city built this park on Kenmare and Spring Street to honor him in 1987.\n\nTo combat the rise of Italian Black Hand crimes, the city formed the Italian squad with Petrosino at its helm. In 1909, Petrosino traveled to Sicily in search of a secret society of criminals infiltrating America and Vito Cascioferro, the powerbroker behind the Morello Crime Family. The trip would be Petrosino’s undoing. Mafia assassins put the Police Lieutenant on the spot, assassinating him on the streets of Palermo. (Click to read more about Joe Petrosino)\n\n5 Salvatore Toto D’Aquila’s Home\n\nAddress: 91 Elizabeth Street\n\nStatus: Standing\n\nAfter Giuseppe Morello’s conviction for counterfeiting in 1909, the Clutch Hand’s remaining brothers retreated to 107th Street in Italian Harlem, allowing Salvatore Toto D’Aquila to become the ruler of Downtown Little Italy, and the Italian Mafia’s boss of bosses in New York. By the time of Prohibition, D’Aquila became quite wealthy despite his lowly tenement home at 91 Elizabeth Street. His encroachments on Giuseppe “Joe” Masseria’s open-air liquor markets on Kenmare, Broom and Grand Streets would erupt into all out war in 1920.\n\n6 Umberto’s Clam House, the Murder of Crazy Joe Gallo\n\nAddress: 129 Mulberry\n\nStatus: Moved\n\nhttp://www.umbertosclamhouse.com/\n\nAs crazy as they came, Joe Gallo earned a reputation for shaking up the mob. With his Red Hook Brooklyn based brothers, Larry and Albert, Gallo and his gang took on a succession of bosses for control of the Profachi and later Colombo Crime Family.\n\nOn April 7, 1972, Gallo, his family and Mafia crew walked into Umberto’s Clam House, a well-known mafia restaurant owned by Matty the Horse Ianniello, to celebrate Gallo’s birthday, a completely insane move. The mob wanted Gallo dead for the slaying of Joseph Colombo at an Italian-American Civil Rights League rally at Columbus Circle.\n\nAt 4:30 a.m. four gunmen slipped into Umberto’s back door and violated a mafia ban on brazenly killing gangsters on the streets of little Italy. Bullets slammed into Gallo who limped out and collapsed on the street. Gallo’s gang opened fire on the escaping hitmen. Bullet pockmarks can still be found at Graziano’s funeral home across the street. Gallo’s murder remains unsolved.\n\n7 Joe The Boss Masseria’s Bootleggers Curb\n\nAddress: Kenmare, Broom and Grand Street\n\nBy some quirk of geography, Giuseppe “Joe” Masseria, a small time hood and recent mafia import, struck prohibition gold. His small gang ran the streets of Kenmare, Broom and Grand in the shadow of NYPD Headquarters. For whatever the reason, these streets became know as the Whisky Curb or Bootleggers Curb, an open air booze market where speakeasies and saloons came to trade bottles of pre-prohibition hooch.\n\nA quick hand with a gat and even quicker feet made the portly Masseria’s reputation as a supernatural Mafiosi. Masseria grew incredibly wealthy and Toto D’aquila wanted a cut. Bootleggers Curb soon became shootout central. Dodging bullets and leading shootouts, Masseria led a prohibition gang war against New York’s Boss of Bosses Toto D’Aquila for control of Little Italy.\n\nAfter his release from prison in 1920, Giuseppe “the Clutch Hand” Morello joined forces with Joe Masseria against Toto Aquila. With the help a new recruit named Charley Lucky Luciano and his Jewish Mob friends, Toto Aquilia was bumped off in 1928.\n\n8 NYPD Headquarters, The Central Office\n\nAddress: 240 Centre Street\n\nStatus: Landmark (Luxury Condos)\n\nMost mobsters of any consequence have spent at least one overnight in the basement of 240 Centre Street. From 1909 to 1973 this beaux-arts masterpiece served as NYPD Headquarters, the nerve center of the New York Police Department. Click to learn more about Old NYPD Headquarters.\n\n9 Lucky Luciano Rats\n\nAddress: 164 Mulberry\n\nStatus: Standing\n\nSalvatore Luciana kept his fingers in many pies. Gambling, bootlegging, prostitution and murder for hire all kept him wealthy, but Lucky wanted more. Under the direction of his mentor Arnold Rothstein, Charley Luciano turned to narcotics, and it proved to be a mistake. By 1923, the mobster was the darling of prohibition high society, and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics collared Lucky with a pocket full of dope. In exchange for his freedom, Luciano revealed the location of a trunk of Heroin stashed in the basement of 164 Mulberry Street. The arrest tarnished Lucky’s reputation among Manhattan’s socialites, inspiring him to throw the biggest party of the decade.\n\n10 Café Roma\n\n385 Broome Street\n\nStatus: Open for Business\n\nBack in the 1970s, Eli “Joe the Baker” Ziccardi did more than make cannoli at the Café Roma. The Genovese capo ran the policy games for Fat Tony Salerno from this downtown café, making Zicardi a target for opportunistic gangsters like the Irish Westies. In the 1977 under the orders of Hells Kitchen’s gang lord Mickey Spillane, the Westies put the snatch on Zicardi. Salerno begrudgingly paid the $100,000 ransom to the Irish Mob, but Zicardi was never seen again. Because of the kidnapping and construction projects on the Westside, all out war broke out between the Irish and Italian mobs resulting in Spillane’s murder and the death of three of his lieutenants.\n\n11 John DeSalvio Playground or Jimmy Kelly Park\n\nAddress: Spring and Mulberry Street\n\nStatus: NYC Park\n\nAn original gangster who predated the coming of the Mafia, Jimmy Kelly knew all of the angles. His real name was Giovanni DeSalvio, but the middleweight boxer changed his name to Kelly to make inroads in the Irish controlled boxing world of turn-of-the-century New York. However, Kelly failed to make it as a pro-boxer and put his knuckles to work at Mike Salter’s Pelham café protecting the club’s singing waiter Irving Berlin (click to read the story). Under Salter’s wing, Kelly took up politics and full time gangsterism. When Salter fled the country for election fraud, Kelly took his place as a Tammany ward heeler running into innumerable gang wars with hunchback mobster Humpty Jackson.

Nowhere else in the city was the intertwining of crime and politics more apparent than 225 Lafayette Street. Built in 1909 in the heart of Little Italy to house the East River Savings Bank, 225 quickly evolved into a mafia hub.\n\nA close personal friend of Lucky Luciano, Albert Marinelli set up the political headquarters of his Al Marinelli Association at 225 Layafette. With the help of Luciano’s gunmen, Marinelli unseated Tammany’s Irish incumbent to become the first elected Italian-American Distract Leader in the city. Luciano and Marinelli were so chummy that they shared a room at the 1932 Democratic Convention. The politician made a fortune with Luciano, which attracted the attention of Special Prosecutor Thomas Dewey.\n\nDewey later accused Marinelli of voter fraud and corruption. Dewy explained:\n\n“He has a luxurious estate surrounded by an iron fence on Lake Ronkonkoma, way out on long island. From his several motorcars he chooses to drive a Lincoln limousine. His Japanese butler, Togo, serves him well.” Thomas Dewey\n\nWith the spotlight on him, Marinelli stepped down, making way for John DeSalvio to become the 2nd Assembly District Leader.\n\nOn another floor of 225 Layafette, Jimmy Doyle Pulmeri and his nephew Johnny Dio Dioguardi set up their Five Boroughs Trucking Service Association, a thinly veiled shakedown scheme. Their strong arm racketeering tactics eventually won control of all Garment Center trucking. Business was brisk. So brisk that Doyle and his partner Dominick Didato shot each other in their offices. Neither man could explain to police why their legally licensed revolvers simultaneously malfunctioned. Didato was found dead days later. After the Castellmarese Mafia war, Dio and Doyle joined the Gaetano Reina and later Lucchese Crime Family.

Dellacrose maintained a life long address at this tenement at 232 Mulberry Street across the street from his headquarters, The Ravenite.\n\n14 John Gotti’s Bunker: The Ravenite Social Club:\n\nAddress: 247 Mulberry Street\n\nStatus: Shoe Store\n\nThere is no better place to conclude a Mafia walking tour of Little Italy than the Ravenite Social Club at 247 Mulberry. Buried in the heart of historic little Italy, the once bricked up, fortified storefront encapsulated the entire history of the mafia in New York. The club started life as a mob joint in 1926 as the Knights of Alto Social Club. Regular patrons included Lucky Luciano and Albert Anastasia. After Carlo Gambino and Vito Genovese toppled Anastasia, Gambino purchased the building, renamed the club the Ravenite, and installed Dellacroce his underboss.\n\nHoused within the wall’s of today’s CYDQOG Shoe Store (the Ravenite’s original floors remain in the store), Dellacroce would take an up-and-coming hoodlum named John Gotti under his wing. After years of underworld dealings, Dellacroce was terminally ill and on trial for being a member of the Mafia Commission.\n\nAfter the death of Dellacroce, John Gotti rubbed out family boss Paul Castalano, took over the Ravenite and installed himself as boss of the Gambino Family. FBI electronics wizards eventually bugged the club and recorded hours of incriminating evidence. Gotti was convicted in 1992 of murder, illegal gambling, bribery, tax evasion and a host of other crimes. Federal Marshals later seized the building and auctioned it off to the highest bidder.
