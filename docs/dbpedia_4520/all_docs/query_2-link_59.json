In response, he declared his intention to feed the federal prosecutors useless or entirely false information, vowing never to testify against anyone.\n\nHis strategy aimed at securing a favorable plea deal while implicating two adversaries, reputed capo Daniel Marino and associate Joseph (Joe the German) Watts, with the federal authorities.\n\nDespite its uncertainty to others, particularly his ex-underling John Alite, Gotti pursued this plan, resulting in him being criticised as a \"rat.\"\n\nHow did John Gotti Jr. make his money?\n\nAs of 2024, John Gotti Jr's net worth is $10 million.
