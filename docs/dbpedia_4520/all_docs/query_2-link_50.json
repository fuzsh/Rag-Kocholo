        "text": "The Sawyer Place development, previously known as Larkin Plaza, in Yonkers’ Getty Square has been linked to a federal investigation of associates of the Gambino crime family in New York City.\n\nAs first reported by The Real Deal, a letter sent to a U.S. magistrate judge alleges that Matthew Kachmar of development firm RXR Realty, the real estate firm behind the $190 million, two-building high-rise apartment complex in downtown Yonkers, received free labor and materials for a gym in White Plains.\n\nKachmar is a senior project manager at RXR and also the CEO of White Plains-based East Coast United Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu.\n\nWhen completed, the Sawyer Place complex will include 442 apartments, 539 parking spaces and 33,000 square feet of retail space in the heart of the city's ongoing redevelopment revival.\n\nLohud reported RXR began leasing the first 168 units in November 2018. The second tower, totaling 272 units, is under construction.\n\nYonkers City Council President Mike Khader called for increased oversight of the city's Industrial Development Authority, who approved a $27 million tax incentive for the construction of Sawyer Place.\n\n\"Developers and their general contractors must have better compliance,\" he said.\n\n“This is one instance that we know about; how many others are we not aware of?”\n\n“With better oversight, compliance and enforcement, these type of things can be avoided.\"\n\nThe letter sent to U.S. Magistrate Judge Ramon Reyes Jr. alleges the project manager for Sawyer Place is linked to a bribe and kickback scheme by members and associates of the Gambino family.\n\nMembers and associates of the family, through carpentry firm CWC Contracting, exchanged monetary bribes and free labor with employees of various construction and real estate development companies, the U.S. Attorney's office said.\n\nThe individuals awarded CWC of New York City contract work and work order modifications for the bribes, according to authorities.\n\nThe case was mentioned in an indictment that unsealed in December. At that time, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York revealed racketeering and loansharking charges against 10 members of the Gambino crime family.\n\nThe indictment charged defendants with paying bribes and kickbacks to employees of numerous construction companies and real estate developers.\n\n\"In exchange, these employees took steps to benefit CWC, including awarding contracts and approving change orders to add or delete from the original scope of a contract,\" the indictment continued.\n\n“[Vincent] Fiore and codefendant Benito DiZenzo [associates of the Gambino family] provided free labor and materials at a location in White Plains, New York, which became a jujitsu gym, that was performed at the request of an employee of Construction Company #2 &mldr; a project manager for the construction project at Larkin Plaza in Yonkers who was associated with the gym,” according to the letter.\n\nA spokesperson for RXR Realty said Hudson Meridian Construction Corporation, the construction manager at the Sawyer Place, subcontracted CWC at the Yonkers development.\n\nKachmar could not be reached for comment.\n\n\"We concluded that our employee in question had not done anything wrong,\" a spokesperson for RXR Realty said. \"We shared our findings with the U.S. Attorney’s office and our employee has agreed to cooperate fully with their investigation.”\n\nThe letter alleges employees from four other real estate companies were involved in the scheme.\n\nThe indictment states John Simonlacaj of Scarsdale was the recipient of free labor and materials from CWC for renovations at his home in exchange for fraudulent changes to work orders for New York firm HFZ Capital where Simonlacaj served as a managing director."
