        "text": "Sixteen alleged leaders and associates of the Gambino crime family have been arrested in the US and Italy, American prosecutors said on Tuesday.\n\nThe charges against them include racketeering, extortion, witness retaliation, conspiracy and fraud.\n\nTen were arrested in the New York area and six by Italian authorities in Palermo in Sicily.\n\nAnother suspect is still at large, according to the US Department of Justice.\n\nThe US-based suspects were due to appear in court in New York on Wednesday.\n\nIn an indictment, prosecutors outlined a pattern of intimidation and violent assaults intended to embezzle funds and defraud unions and employee benefit plans.\n\nThe syndicate targeted demolition companies and the carting industry - also known as waste management or rubbish collection.\n\nAccording to the indictment, members of the group threatened businessmen and demanded protection payments. They evaded union rules and rigged bids for lucrative demolition contracts.\n\nThe defendants were also charged with threatening witnesses, money laundering and firearms offenses.\n\nAmong those arrested was a leader or \"captain\" in the Gambino family, Joseph \"Joe Brooklyn\" Lanni, alleged Gambino soldier Angelo \"Fifi\" Gradilone, and Francesco Vicari, also known as \"Uncle Ciccio\", an alleged Sicilian mafia associate and Gambino associate.\n\nThe Gambino family is one of the five prominent New York-area mafia syndicates collectively known as La Cosa Nostra.\n\nThe family was led by boss John Gotti until his death in prison in 2002 and later by Frank Cali, who was killed outside his Staten Island home in March 2019.\n\nHis death marked the first targeted killing of a Mafia boss in the city since the death of the then head of the Gambino family, Paul Castellano, in 1985."
