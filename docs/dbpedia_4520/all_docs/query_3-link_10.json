        "text": "The Gambino crime family first emerged in New York in 1906 and was led by Carlo Gambino during the McClellan hearings in 1963 that exposed organized crime. The Gambino family operated throughout the US from New York to California and was one of the most powerful crime families. Carlo Gambino was boss from 1957 until his death in 1976, after which Paul Castellano led until he was assassinated in 1985 outside his home. John Gotti then became boss but was convicted of murder in 1992 and died in prison 10 years later."
