        "text": "Ten men linked to the Gambino crime family were arrested for allegedly using baseball bats and other intimidation tactics to muscle into New York City garbage hauling and demolition businesses, authorities said Wednesday.\n\nThe men associated with the infamous Brooklyn crime syndicate were arrested and charged on a 16-count indictment unsealed in federal court, which includes allegations of racketeering conspiracy, extortion, witness retaliation, and union-related crimes \"committed in an attempt to dominate the New York carting and demolition industries,\" according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nIn addition, federal prosecutors said Wednesday that Italian law enforcement arrested six members of the mob there in coordination with the actions of the FBI and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the 10 arrested are:\n\nJoseph Lanni, also known as \"Joe Brooklyn\" and \"Mommino,\" an alleged captain in the Gambino organized crime family\n\nDiego \"Danny\" Tantillo\n\nAngelo Gradilone, also known as \"Fifi,\" an alleged Gambino soldier\n\nJames LaForte, an alleged Gambino soldier\n\nVito Rappa, an alleged U.S.-based Sicilian Mafia member and Gambino associate\n\nFrancesco Vicari, also known as “Uncle Ciccio,” an alleged U.S.-based Sicilian Mafia associate and Gambino associate\n\nSalvatore DiLorenzo, an alleged Gambino associate\n\nRobert Brooke, an alleged Gambino associate\n\nKyle Johnson, also known as “Twin\"\n\nVincent Minsquero, also known as “Vinny Slick”\n\nTantillo, Rappa, Vicari, and Johnson are alleged to have demanded money from an unnamed person who ran a carting business by threatening him with a bat, setting fire to the steps of his house, damaging one of his trucks, and assaulting an associate.\n\n“As alleged, for years, the defendants committed violent extortions, assaults, arson, witness retaliation and other crimes in an attempt to dominate the New York carting and demolition industries,” U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. \"Today’s arrests reflect the commitment of this Office and our law enforcement partners, both here and abroad, to keep our communities safe by the complete dismantling of organized crime.”\n\nRappa is alleged to have said that Vicari “acted like the Last of the Samurai” in threatening to cut the unnamed carting business owner in half if he didn’t make extortionate payments commonly referred to as \"tribute\" on a FBI recorded call.\n\nProsecutors also allege “Tantillo arranged for Gradilone to receive a 'no-show' job at a construction company with which Tantillo was associated, which enabled Gradilone to receive paychecks and union health benefits to which he was not entitled.\"\n\nThey say, “DiLorenzo provided Rappa with a “no-show” job at DiLorenzo’s demolition company so that Rappa could receive paychecks and union health benefits, among other benefits.”\n\nIn a detention memo prosecutors say that Tantillo received $50,000 in direct payment from owners of a demolition company in 2019. And in 2020, they say Tantillo’s demands became more contentions with prosecutors alleging he attacked an employee with a hammer who was taken to the hospital.\n\nAfter the assault occurred, another mob associate, Johnson, texted Tantillo the following:\n\nProsecutors say they were able to capture text messages and photos from October 17, 2019, when Tantillo and LaForte were “made” or inducted into the Gambino crime family.\n\nRappa allegedly texted Tantillo saying: “Good morning Dani have a great day so happy for your new job and when you sign the contract even if I’m not there is like I am very proud good luck !!”\n\nTantillio then responded: “Ty Vito I really wish you were there since you were one of the people help me get this contract. I hope we continue getting more work and everything gets even better than before. Ty as always.”\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if the men had hired or been assigned attorneys by early Wednesday afternoon.\n\nNine of the defendants appeared in court on Wednesday and pleaded not guilty. The tenth, Laforte, was not arraigned because he is jail in Pennsylvania and will arraigned at a later day.\n\n\"These defendants learned the hard way that the FBI is united with our law enforcement locally and internationally in our efforts to eradicate the insidious organized crime threat,\" said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge James Smith. \"The FBI will continue to lead the fight against organized crime and ensure that individuals will to cross the line face punishment.\"\n\nNYPD Commissioner Edward Caban said in a statement, “today’s arrests should serve as a warning to others who believe they can operate in plain sight with apparent impunity – the NYPD and our law enforcement partners exist to shatter that notion.”"
