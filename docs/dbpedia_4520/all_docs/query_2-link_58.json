        "text": "FBI agents have been digging up land since Wednesday at two upstate New York horse farms in connection with ongoing federal investigations into the Gambino crime family, according to a report by the New York Post.\n\nThe properties, which are five miles apart and located on Hampton Road in Goshen and on Hamptonburgh Road in Campbell Hall, became the scene of the investigation following claims by a tipster that bodies were buried in the area, law enforcement sources told the Post.\n\nThree Staten Island men are among the alleged Gambino crime family members and associates who were charged last week in an attempt to take over the carting and demolition industries of New York City through force, witness tampering and arson, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nJoseph Lanni, 57, who prosecutors identified as a captain in the Gambino family; Angelo Gradilone, 57, an alleged Gambino soldier, and Vincent Minsquero, 36, an alleged Gambino associate — all from Staten Island — were among 10 defendants charged in the indictment.\n\nProsecutors contend that during one harrowing encounter in early September, Lanni and Minsquero allegedly terrorized the owners of Roxy’s Bar and Grille, a Toms River, New Jersey, restaurant."
