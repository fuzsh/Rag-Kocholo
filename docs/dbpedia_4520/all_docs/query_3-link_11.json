        "text": "Exactly when bands of men in Sicily started acting as “protectors against the arrogance of the powerful\" or mafioso isn't clear but, according to historian Selwyn Raab, there wasn't a criminal connotation to the word mafia until the 19th century. By the mid-1800s, the Sicilian mafia became increasingly defiant of the government and integrated itself into politics and economic activities, using manipulation, coercion, extortion, and other methods to get what it wanted.\n\nIn nearby Naples, Italy, the Camorra also emerged by the 1800s. Likely an extension of the prison gang system, the Camorra similarly took part in criminal activities and extended its influence into the United States. As Europeans flocked to cities in the US, New York City grew to become one of the most international cities in the world. By 1920, a substantial portion of the four million Italians who had arrived in the United States since 1880 lived in New York City.\n\nNeapolitans settled in Brooklyn while Sicilians established themselves in Harlem and Manhattan. The two groups came into violent contact with each other, especially as their criminal enterprises like racketeering and gambling crossed paths. The so-called “First Mafia War” played out during the late 1910s.\n\nIn late 1916, the leader of the Camorristas, Don Pellegrino Morano, set his sights on eliminating the head of the Sicilian group, Nicholas Morello (also known as Nicholas Terranova) to bring the war to an end. Morano invited Morello and his bodyguard to a meeting in 1916 under the guise of peace. Morello and his bodyguard were ambushed and killed in September 1916. This didn't end the conflict and the back and forth of death continued.\n\nWhen Ralph Daniello, one of Morano's men, turned on his gang in 1917, it signaled the end for the group from Camorra. Daniello implicated Morano in the murders of Morello and his bodyguard, Charles Ubriaco. Morano was tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison. In the end, the Sicilians emerged as the dominant group, even taking in some former Camorristas after their fall.\n\nAmong the large numbers of Sicilian living in the city who became key figures in the mafia during the early 20th century were Giuseppe “Joe” Masseria and Salvatore “Toto” D'Aquila.\n\nMasseria arrived in New York around 1903 after he fled a murder charge in Sicily. He became a member of the first major crime family in the city, the Morello Gang, as did D'Aquila, who established roots in East Harlem after immigrating from Palermo, Sicily, in 1904.\n\nBoth D'Aquila and Masseria were in the Morello gang, and when leader Giuseppe Morello and associate Ignazio “The Wolf” Lupo went to prison in during the 1910s (avoiding much of the activity of the \"First Mafia War), D'Aquila assumed control of the group. He was, according to sources, considered to be the capo di tutti capi or “boss of all bosses.”\n\nMasseria was less than pleased and worked to undermine D'Aquila. By the time Morello and Lupo were released during the early 1920s, Masseria had usurped much of the bootlegging racket in New York. D'Aquila tried to prevent Masseria's rise to power and sent hitman Umberto Valenti to eliminate him several times. Valenti was ultimately killed, allegedly by Salvatore “Charles Lucky” Luciano, an ally of Masseria. Masseria's survival secured him two monikers, “Joe the Boss” and ”the man who could dodge bullets.\"\n\nFor his part, D'Aquila held his title until 1928 when he was killed. D'Aquila's death signaled the end of the rivalry between the man who laid the foundations for the future Gambino crime family and Joe the Boss. Masseria took over as capo di tutti capi but, unfortunately for him, another threat from Sicily, Salvatore Maranzano, had arrived the previous year.\n\nSalvatore Maranzano's arrival in the US in 1927 represented what would be a big shift in organized crime in the country. Sent by Sicilian Don Vito Ferro, Maranzano was tasked with establishing ties with existing gangsters on his behalf.\n\nMaranzano based himself in Brooklyn where he grew a reputable real estate business as well as a bootlegging operation. He made contact with men who had immigrated from his hometown Castellammare del Golfo and was soon aligned with the likes of Giuseppe “Joseph” Bonanno and Giuseppe “Joseph” Profaci. He also attracted the attention of Giuseppe “Joe the Boss” Masseria, a fellow Sicilian.\n\nFactions led by Maranzano and Masseria openly sabotaged and undercut each other, and, by 1930, the tension between the two groups was at its breaking point. The Castellammarese War broke out, with Maranzano supported by the aforementioned Bonanno and Profaci as allies. Masseria had Lucky Luciano and Vito Genovese on his side at first. With the struggle leaning in Maranzano's favor by early 1931, Luciano turned on Masseria. In cahoots with Marananzano, Luciano had Masseria killed on April 15, 1931, ending the Castellammarese War.\n\nAfter Masseria's death, Maranzano called together hundreds of gangsters in New York City for a groundbreaking meeting. It was there that Maranzano officially established La Cosa Nostra (Italian for “our thing”) and divided organized crime in New York into five families. Maranzano was the capo di tuti or “boss of the bosses” - the man above the rest. The five families were headed by Joe Profaci, Joseph Bonanno, Tom Gagliano, Vincent Mangano, and Lucky Luciano. Each man had an underboss with a sub-boss, lieutenants, and soldiers rounding out the family structure.\n\nMaranzano told the group that peace and prosperity would rule the day but was aware that Luciano had higher ambitions. By September 1931, Maranzano knew he had to eliminate Luciano and made plans for his assassination. On September 10, 1931, however, Maranzano was killed by assassins sent by Luciano who had found out about the “boss of the bosses” plan.\n\nLuciano engaged men from his friend and Jewish crime boss Meyer Lansky for the job. Killing Maranzano propelled Luciano to the top of organized crime in New York City and also united Italian organized crime activities with non-Italian groups. Luciano created a national crime syndicate called “The Commission” and continued with the five-family structure initiated by Maranzano.\n\nThe formalization of the crime families leaned on a solid organizational structure. Bosses or “Dons” headed crime families, while underbosses (sotto capo) were second in command. A boss likely had a consigliere or trusted adviser who generally ranked third in power. Underbosses oversaw capos, men who more or less commanded soldiers and associates. Soldiers were “made men\" and had been vouched for by some other member of the family before approval by the Don. Soldiers also took the code of silence (omerta) required for membership. Associates were akin to errand boys who followed orders but didn't hold sway in the family.\n\nWith the establishment of The Commission, Lucky Luciano - the man who “organized organized crime” - built upon the idea of Salvatore Maranzano and expanded the reach of New York organized crime. The emphasis on loyalty, familial bonds, and maintaining peace remained but The Commission was essentially a way for the five families in New York to reign over families around the US. Described as an “underworld Supreme Court” by author Selwyn Raab, The Commission allocated one vote to each family and seats to men from Chicago and Buffalo.\n\nThe five families then focused inwardly. Headed by Joseph “Joe Bananas” Bonanno until the late 1960s, the Bonanno family remained steeped in Sicilian tradition and practices. Bonanno had been a protege of Salvatore Maranzano and the family undertook gambling, loansharking, and drug trafficking operations with members who had bloodlines tied to Sicily.\n\nGuiseppe “Joe” Profaci took control of the family named after him (later called the Colombo family,) while Lucky Luciano ran a family of his own group (essentially what was left of Masseria's men.) Luciano went to prison in 1936 and his underboss, Vito Genovese, took over in his absence. When Genovese fled the United States in 1937, Frank “the Prime Minister” Costello took over, but after Luciano was deported in 1947, Costello officially became the boss until 1957.\n\nVincent Mangano led what would later be called the Gambino family until his disappearance in 1951 and Tommaso “Tommy\" Gagliano became boss of the future Lucchese family.\n\nChicago and Buffalo were the two non-New York City crime families represented on The Commission. The former was led by Alphonse “Al” Capone, while the latter saw Stefano Magaddino at the top.\n\nCapone and his Chicago mafia (called “The Outfit”) were considered more or less on par with New York organized crime. Capone had a relatively short tenure on The Commission because he was convicted of tax evasion in 1931 and sentenced to 11 years in prison. The reason Magaddino and Buffalo were given a seat had to do with the group's control of illegal trade going in and out of Canada.\n\nIn addition to The Commission, Luciano formalized links among crime families in the US through a national syndicate. The idea of such a confederation may have been the brainchild of Chicago crime boss Johnny Torrio (Al Capone's mentor) as early as 1929, but it was Luciano who brought it to fruition. The Syndicate, as it became known, wasn't synonymous with the mafia because it wasn't exclusively Sicilian entities. The Syndicate extended from coast-to-coast as a network of Italian, Irish, Jewish, and other criminal organizations under one umbrella."
