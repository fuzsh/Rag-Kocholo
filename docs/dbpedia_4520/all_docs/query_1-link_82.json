        "text": "THE notorious Gambino crime family were one of the five families in charge of organized crime all around New York City since the 1910’s.\n\nItalian boss John Gotti began leading the mob in 1985 after allegedly organizing the murder of the previous boss, Paul Castellano.\n\nJohn Gotti\n\nJohn Joseph Gotti Jr., 61, was born in Bronx, New York and was the fifth of 13 children of John Joseph Gotti Sr. and Philomena \"Fannie\" DeCarlo.\n\nHis ancestry hailed from San Giuseppe Vesuviano, in the province of Naples, Italy, where his parents were from.\n\nGotti was allegedly involved in New York street gangs as a teenager and reportedly worked with the Mafia-associated Fulton-Rockaway Boys gang for some time.\n\nThe mob boss had five children: Victoria, Angel, John A, Peter, and Frank Gotti with wife Victoria DiGiorgio.\n\nHe worked as a presser in a coat factory and as an assistant truck driver in 1962 before forming part of the Gambino crime family.\n\nEventually, Gotti alongside his brothers Gene, Peter, Vincent, and Richard were initiated to the Gambino crime family.\n\nGotti’s work in the Gambino crime family led to multiple arrests and charges.\n\nHowever, after a series of acquittals, he wound up serving a life term for racketeering and murder.\n\nHe died of cancer in 2002.\n\nVictoria DiGiorgio\n\nVictoria DiGiorgio, 78, is the widow of Gotti.\n\nShe is of Italian and Russian descent.\n\nHer parents migrated to the US in the 1950’s and worked in factories to make ends meet.\n\nThey divorced when she was 2-years-old and later inherited a family fortune through her mother’s ancestral properties.\n\nDiGiorgio and John’s son, Frank passed away when he was 12-years-old in a car accident.\n\nLittle is known about her career life as she lives a low-profile life.\n\nVictoria Gotti\n\nVictoria Gotti, 58, is the daughter of Gotti and a reality TV star and writer.\n\nVictoria was a columnist at the New York Post and a reporter for WNYW, the New York City flagship station of the Fox Television Network.\n\nShe wrote her first book, Women and Mitral Valve Prolapse, in 1995 and published five others through the years.\n\nOne of those books included a 2009 memoir titled This Family of Mine: What It Was Like Growing Up Gotti.\n\nVictoria grew up in Howard Beach, New York.\n\nShe married her high school sweetheart, Carmine Agnello in 1984 but divorced in 2003.\n\nThe couple had three children: Carmine, Frank, and John.\n\nCarmine Agnello\n\nCarmine Agnello, 61, is the nephew of Gotti and the husband of Victoria.\n\nHe ran a scrap metal recycling operation prior to joining the Gambino family mob.\n\nAgnello was charged with racketeering and arson in 2000 but accepted a plea bargain in return for a reduced sentence.\n\nVictoria reportedly divorced him as he was serving his sentence under grounds of constructive abandonment.\n\nIn 2008, Agnello married Danielle Vangar, the daughter of activist Mourad Topalian.\n\nThe pair have a son who was born in 2009.\n\nIn 2015, Agnello was arrested in Cleveland, Ohio on charges of theft, money laundering, and conspiracy.\n\nHe was also charged with drugging his own race horses with performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nAgnello accepted a plea deal two years later but only paid a fine and evaded prison time.\n\nJohn A.
