        "text": "The death last Friday of Carlo Gambino, the most powerful Mafia boss in the country, will bring about marked changes within organized crime in the New York City area, according to law enforcement officials and underworld informants.\n\nAt the height of his power, Mr. Gambino imposed his philosophy, which called for discipline and caution, not only on his own crime family, but also on the other four families in the city. He also dominated the national commission that makes policy for the 26 Mafia families in the United States.\n\nThe most significant changes the police expect as a result of Mr. Gambino's death are the initiation of new members into the city's five families on a broad scale, which Mr. Gambino discouraged because it carried the risk of bringing in informants; the expansion of the families into rackets such as hijacking and narcotics, which he discouraged because they invited Federal intervention, and the possible flare‐up of fighting among the families, which he kept to a minimum because of the immense respect he received in the Mafia.\n\nNew Members Initiated\n\nThe initiation of new members, in fact, began several months ago when Mr. Gambino, greatly weakened by a severe heart ailment, was unable to prevent the opening of the books on a limited scale. The five families were allowed by the national commission to initiate 10 new members each, according to informants.\n\nMr. Gambino believed the changes he was struggling to prevent—changes that are now likely to come about—would weaken the Mafia in New York, and most experts on organized crime agree.\n\n“The infusion.of new members and the expansion into new rackets will pump new blood and new money into the families, but ultimately these changes will make them more vulnerable to prosecution,” said Tony Villano, a retired agent for the Federal Bureau ‐of‐ Investigation who “turned,” or converted into informants, five Mafia members during his career.\n\nMr. Gambino took over his family in 1957 from Albert Anastasia, who was assassinated with Mr. Gambino's approval, according to Joseph Valachi, a Mafia informant. Mr. Gambino immediately called for the closing of the books, citing the high number of indictments against Mafia members as evidence that informants were being brought into the families,\n\nMr. Gambino, who came to the United States from Sicily as a stowaway when he was 19 years old, believed in caution and in the old ways, the traditions and practices that have sustained the Mafia as a strong force in Sicily for centuries.\n\nTo Carlo Gambino, this philosophy meant that you deal only with those you know and trust absolutely, that you punish those who violate the rules and that you avoid doing anything personally or professionally that could invite undue attention to the family or create unnecessary risks for it.\n\nThe 500‐member crime family that has been shaped into the most powerful in the country was built on a core of about 150 men who were not only bound together by membership in the same group but were blood relatives, even if the relationship stretched to fourth and fifth cousins.\n\nIn fact, there was such frequent intermarriage among Gambino relatives that a study of the crime family by the F.B.I. showed a higher than normal incidence of retardation among offspring. Carlo Gambino himself married his first cousin, Catherine Castellano, although no problem resulted with the offspring of their union.\n\nAvoided Attention\n\nMr, Gambino was not loath to punish those in his family who had violated the rules, according to informants. But rather than have them shot down in the street, inviting headlines, ‘he made certain that they simply disappeared.\n\nHe also avoided undue attention by living modestly, devoting himself to his wife and family and making sure that those closest to him followed his example.\n\nMr. Gambino abandoned his conservative philosophy only once, in 1970, when he lent his support to Joseph A. Colombo Sr., the leader of another Mafia family who had ascended to his position with Mr. Gambino's backing. Mr. Columbo led the Italian‐American Civil Rights League to demonstrate against the F.B.I. and to disclaim the existence of the Mafia.\n\nBut instead of discouraging pressure from law enforcement agencies, Mr. Colombo's tactics increased it, and Mr. Gambino eventually withdrew his support. Shortly afterward, Mr. Colombo was shot during an Italian unity day rally at Columbus Circle by a black who was immediately killed by an unknown assassin.\n\nAfter that, Mr. Gambino persuaded the Mafia families in the city to retreat to the shadows, where they had traditionally operated, and to return to their old ways. According to underworld informants, Mr. Gambino defended his conservative style of operating in contrast to that of the more flamboyant Mafia bosses by pointing out that the members of his crime family had not only prospered under his leadership but had also avoided prison.\n\n2 Groups to Family\n\nOf all the Mafia families on the East Coast, his was the least affected by the mounting campaign against organized crime during the last decade. Of his close associates, only his under boss, Aniello Dellacroce, who is now on Rikers Island serving the last two months of a prison sentence, was convicted of any serious crime.\n\nThe crime family Mr. Gambino leaves behind is divided into two groups—blood relatives of the Gambinos, who are now led by Paul Castellano, Mr. Gambino's brother‐in‐law, and those who are not blood relatives, led by Mr. Dellacroce.\n\nThe 62‐year‐old Mr. Dellacroce is considered to be the more forceful of the two and is expected to take command of the family when he is released from prison.\n\nBut the most respected of the Mafia bosses in the city, now that Mr. Gambino is dead, will probably be Carmine Galente, the reputed head of the Joseph Bonanno family.\n\nMr. Galente, 64, who recently completed a 15‐year prison term for a narcotics conviction, was reported to have been the primary force in persuading the commission to allow the five New York familiies to initiate 10 new members each a few months ago.\n\nThe number was limited in deference to Mr. Gambino. but with his death, the gates to new members are certain to be opened wider.\n\nMany gangsters have been waiting for a long time to be “made,” or initiated fully into a Mafia family. Being “made” holds the same prestige in the Mafia that being initiated into the best fraternities used to have in some colleges.\n\n‘A Good Fellow’\n\n“Made” members, who refer to one another as “a good fellow” or “a dear fellow,” can participate in “sitdowns,” or Mafia conferences. They canals orely on the support of the family in operating their rackets and can count on its protection from harassment by members of other families. But the existence of five families in the city competing for the\n\nsame rackets results in animosity that will make them vulnerable to penetration. “The best way you get to a wise guy [Mafia member] in one family is to field out who hates him the most in another,” said a Federal agent.\n\nTwo years before his death, Mr. Gambino suggested that the five New York families be merged into one, pointing out that the Chicago, Detroit and New Orleans families had been able to resist law enforcement pressures more effectively because they were not divided into several competing groups.\n\nHis proposal was not received with enthusiasm, however, and by that time he was too sick to press the issue.\n\nWith Mr. Gambino gone, Mafia gang wars appear inevitable to law enforcement officials. They point out that the Gambino and Bonanno families have been traditional enemies since 1963, when Joseph Bonano tried to have Mr. Gambino assassinated. Now that the Bonanno family has a strong leader in Mr. Galente, its members may try to encroach upon Gambino rackets, which will certainly result in conflict.\n\nIn the last months of his life, Mr. Gambino was not able to prevent internal fighting in the Joseph Colombo family. During the last two months, two members Of the family were shot down by assassins believed to be members of the same family, and more violence within the family is expected by law enforcement officials."
