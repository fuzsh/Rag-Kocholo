"10 Questions for the Dalai Lama" is a tedious title for an anything-but-tedious film that expertly merges the mystical and the mundane.

Arizona RepublicRichard Nilsen

The film never rises above the spiritual or intellectual level of a TV news anchor. It is a dispiriting film to watch, if you have any real interest in the subject.

There have been several documentaries about the Dalai Lama, but few have done a better job of packaging the Tibetan religious leader's circumstances, both historical and current, along with his philosophies, than 10 Questions for the Dalai Lama.

One comes away from 10 Questions emboldened, energized, and sadder -- aware that peace remains so radical a concept that most of us aren't yet worthy of it.

With luscious cinematography and awe-inspiring humanity, 10 Questions for the Dalai Lama is one of the most electrifying documentaries to be released this year.

[Ray's] particular interest in Asia serves him well as he explores the Dalai Lama's world.

Milwaukee Journal SentinelGraham Killeen

[Director] Ray interjects observations about his own travels like a backup musician who thinks he's the frontman. A little less cowbell, please.

Hollywood ReporterFrank Scheck

Part history lesson and part profile, the film presents a concise, cogent account of recent Tibetan history as well as an engrossing onscreen conversation with one of the world's great spiritual leaders.

The 11th question would be: Does a TV-grade travelogue followed by a halfway-decent Q&A warrant a theatrical release?

Washington PostStephen Hunter

A nicely crafted, economic (it's only 85 minutes) introduction to that most eminent of men, the spiritual leader and deposed head of state of Tibet.
