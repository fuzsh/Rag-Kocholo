        "text": "Friday Harbor Film Festival, in collaboration with Frame of Mind Films and the San Juan Island Museum of Art, presents The Great 14th: Tenzin Gyatso, The 14th Dalai Lama In His Own Wordson Saturday, June 1 at 7 pm at the San Juan Community Theatre.\n\nThis award-winning production from Frame of Mind Films uniquely and exclusively features Tenzin Gyatso as both subject and narrator as he presents the full arc of his epic and very public life as the 14th Dalai Lama. Director Rosemary Rawcliffe will be present to discuss the film and answer questions following the screening. Tickets are available for $15 now at www.fhff.org.\n\nThis film The Great 14th offers a unique glimpse into the life and teachings of this extraordinary individual, and is a must-see for anyone interested in spirituality, compassion, and the human experience.\n\nHow does one capture the essence of one of the most legendary lives of our time? A boundless and heroic life filled with extraordinary loss, resilience, and achievement - and a man whose philosophy of kindness continues to inspire millions of people around the world, regardless of faith or political persuasion? In this profound and inspiring portrait of the 14th Dalai Lama, the answer is: In his own words.\n\nThrough intimate conversations and previously unreleased archival images, the Dalai Lama reveals his story and his experience of the personal, political, spiritual, and historical events that shaped his life. The Great 14th offers an extraordinary, unprecedented insight into the complexities of his life - from past lives of the 5th and 13th Dalai Lamas to his current life as the spiritual and former political leader of Tibet and as a tireless Nobel Peace Laureate.\n\nThis is a story - and a film - for the ages, revealing the soul of the simple monk who aspires every day to walk the enlightened path of the Bodhisattva."
