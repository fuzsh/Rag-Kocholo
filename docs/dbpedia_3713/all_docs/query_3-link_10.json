        "text": "RLST 10100. Introduction to Religious Studies. 100 Units.\n\nWhat is religion? Is it the source of truth? Is it fiction? Believe it or not, religion affects what we think, what we do, and how we situate ourselves and others. In this introductory course, we will examine the intertwined histories of the concept of religion and the academic study of religion. We will familiarize ourselves with classical and contemporary theorists of religion and consider the methods, motivations, and historical contexts that have made their theories of religion possible. Along the way, we will survey key concepts such as myth and ritual and relate them to a broader set of problems concerning places, bodies, and politics. Throughout the course, we will apply what we learn about religion to issues within and outside the field of Religious Studies and consider the importance of the study of religion both within and beyond the university. There are no prerequisites for this course. All students are welcome.\n\nInstructor(s): Richard Rosengarten (autumn 2024), Foster Pinkney (winter 2025) Terms Offered: Autumn Winter\n\nNote(s): This is the required introductory course for RLST majors.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SOCI 20541\n\nRLST 11004.

Through course lectures and readings, students will gain familiarity with the historical, geographical, social, religious, cultural, and political contexts of New Testament literature and the events they narrate. We will also learn about the central literary genres found within the collection of texts that came to form the canonical New Testament, including \"gospels,\" \"acts,\" \"letters,\" and \"apocalypses\"), and we will examine how awareness of genre conventions enhances our reading of these works. Students will also learn about the distinctive theological and cultural viewpoints contained within various New Testament texts. As we learn about the history of biblical scholarship, especially the goals and methods of biblical interpretation, we will practice refining our questions. Assignments and discussion will allow students to develop their skills as attuned readers of both ancient texts as well as modern biblical scholarship. PQ: No prior knowledge of biblical literature, the ancient world, or Christianity is expected.

The Bible Throughout History: From the Dead Sea Scrolls to King James. 100 Units.\n\nWhile the collection of ancient texts found in modern Bibles appears fixed and is read by many people as a source of edification or theological insight, it has not always been this way. Though absent from most Bibles, there is an entire body of literature commonly known as \"rewritten bible\": early translations, retellings, or entirely new stories with familiar names and faces that update, retcon, or subvert their \"biblical\" sources. How might we understand these ancient forms of fan fiction? The class will introduce this corpus (including some of the Dead Sea Scrolls) and its sources, production, and historical contexts. We will confront significant problems in understanding religious texts: how is it that some texts become authoritative while other very similar texts do not? Who gets to retell foundational religious narratives, and within what social or political constraints? What does it mean to relate to sacred texts as artistic prompts or imperfect points of departure? Can a biblical text be rewritten for an entirely different religious tradition? We will consider similar questions for contemporary religious practice, asking: how did rewriting the Bible get started, and has it stopped?\n\nInstructor(s): Doren Snoek Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): JWSC 20924, CMLT 20124, HIST 29908, MDVL 20124, FNDL 20124\n\nRLST 20149.

Magic, Miracles, and Medicine: Healthcare in the Bible and the Ancient World. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the complex issues surrounding the body, disability, and medical care in antiquity. It will be guided by a variety of questions, such as what was the root cause of bodily infirmity and disease in antiquity? How did cultural views of sex, gender, and race influence perceptions of the body and what it meant to be able bodied? Such questions are significant when considering what kind of access to healthcare marginalized groups had. In order to explore these questions, we will examine ancient Mediterranean views of medical care through material remains (e.g., magical amulets and healing shrines) and textual evidence (e.g., Galen and Hippocrates). After considering this wider cultural context, we will examine treatments in the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and early Christianity. We will also explore how Christian concepts of medical care evolved in light of accounts of Jesus as a divine healer. In addition to this ancient evidence, we will engage with modern disability studies and sociological analyses to better orient our readings. At the end of the course, students will be better acquainted with the complex relationship between religion and medicine and how that affects modern healthcare decisions.\n\nInstructor(s): Richard Zaleski Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HLTH 20223, KNOW 20223, CCTS 21021, HIPS 20223, HIST 25305, JWSC 20923\n\nRLST 20228. History of Jews in the Middle East. 100 Units.\n\nThis class examines the history of Jews in the Middle East from the early modern period, when many Jewish refugees fleeing Spain and Portugal settled in the Ottoman Empire, to the modern Period, when Jews debated and challenged colonialist, reformist, nationalist, leftist, and secular ideologies. Reading novels, memoirs, and new works in the fields of Jewish and Middle Eastern Studies, we will examine how early modernity and modernity gave birth to new identity formations and new frames of belonging. We will visit the unknown histories of early modern Jews who produced translations and explications of the Hebrew Bible in Arabic, of Jews and Muslims who fought together Christian missionary activities, of Arab Jewish feminists, and of Jewish communists who established anti-Zionist societies in the Middle East.\n\nInstructor(s): Orist Bashkin Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 25810, NEHC 20228, JWSC 23405\n\nRLST 20300.

We will focus on affinities between Christianity and the classical tradition as well as ways in which the Christian faith may be considered radically different from it. Some of the more important issues that we will analyze are: \"The spell of Homer.\" How the Homeric poems exerted immeasurable influence on the religious attitudes and practices of the Greeks. The theme of creation in Greek and Roman authors such as Hesiod and Ovid. The Orphic account of human origins. The early Christian theme of Christ as Creator/Savior. Greek, specifically Homeric conceptions of the afterlife. The response to the Homeric orientation in the form of the great mystery cults of Demeter, Dionysus, and Orpheus. The views of the philosophers (esp. Plato) of the immortality of the soul compared with the New Testament conception of resurrection of the body. Ancient Greek conceptions of sacrifice and the crucifixion of Christ as archetypal sacrifice. The attempted synthesis of Jewish and Greek philosophic thought by Philo of Alexandria and its importance for early Christianity.\n\nInstructor(s): David Martinez\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CLCV 26216, MDVL 20505\n\nRLST 20510.

The Ecumenical Church Councils and the Making of Christian Doctrine. 100 Units.\n\nThe Church Councils of late antiquity (fourth-seventh centuries) were huge conferences of bishops, priests, monks, secular officials, and emperors, who met to decide on the rules that would govern the Church and the doctrines that all Christians had to believe. They combined philosophical debate, criminal trials, committee meetings, and Senate procedure. Some were rowdy and acrimonious, while others were meticulously organized in advance, usually by the court. Some remain obscure, while others are the most thoroughly documented events in all ancient history and reveal in detail how the later Roman government operated. In this course we will read, in Greek, a number of fascinating narratives and official acts stemming from the most important Councils, including Nicaea I (325), Ephesos I (431), and Chalcedon (451). We will also discuss the Councils from a historical perspective to understand the complex negotiations that gave rise to Christian doctrine and canon law.\n\nInstructor(s): Anthony Kaldellis Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GREK 34523, GREK 24523, HCHR 34523\n\nRLST 20600.

In general we will address topics such as the important contribution of papyrology to the language of the New Testament, the form of papyrus letters compared with the NT \"epistle,\" and the contribution of historical, social, and religious insights gleaned from the papyri to the early Christian context.\n\nInstructor(s): David Martinez Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): 2 years of Greek.\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CLAS 45200, BIBL 51000, HCHR 51001, GREK 45400\n\nRLST 21430. Religion and American Capitalism. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will introduce students to the intersection of religion and capitalism in the United States. Through a variety of primary and secondary readings, we will explore how religious people and institutions have interacted with, affirmed, and challenged American capitalism. We will pay particularly close attention to the alternative moral economics envisioned by religious communities in the United States.\n\nInstructor(s): William Schultz Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 27716, AMER 40200, HIST 37716, AMER 21430, RAME 40200, HCHR 40200\n\nRLST 21550. Innerbiblical Exegesis. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will explore the phenomenon of literary revision in the Hebrew Bible and, to a limited extent, its precursors and successor texts. In addition to analyzing various examples of innerbiblical exegesis, we will consider the theoretical issues related to literary revision, including the question of criteria for determining literary dependence and direction of dependence and the intents of texts that reuse source material. All biblical texts will be read in their original languages.\n\nInstructor(s): Jeffrey Stackert Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): Strong Biblical Hebrew\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS or LMCS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): BIBL 45100\n\nRLST 21613. Saints and Sinners in Late Antiquity. 100 Units.\n\nBetween the third and seventh centuries, Christian communities came to flourish throughout the Middle East and neighboring regions in the Roman and Iranian empires as well as the kingdoms of the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Ethiopia. This course will examine the development of Christian institutions and ideologies in relation to the distinctive social structures, political cultures, economies, and environments of the Middle East, with a focus on the Fertile Crescent. The makers of Middle Eastern Christianities were both saints and sinners. Holy men and women, monks, and sometimes bishops withdrew from what they often called \"the world\" with the intention of reshaping society through prayer, asceticism, and writing; some also intervened directly in social, political, and economic relations. The work of these saints depended on the cooperation of aristocrats, merchants, and rulers who established enduring worldly institutions. To explore the dialectical relationship between saints and sinners, we will read lives of saints in various Middle Eastern languages in translation.\n\nInstructor(s): R.

Buddhist Thought in Japan. 100 Units.\n\nIn this seminar we will explore the intellectual history and social contexts of fundamental motifs of Buddhist thought in, especially but not exclusively, premodern Japan. Eschewing narrow sectarian boundaries, we will focus on the four traditions of the Lotus sūtra, the Pure Land, the tantric teachings and Zen construed inclusively as trans-sectarian sources of religious meaning and models of cultivation. Building on an initial exploration of the wider East Asian context of Japanese Buddhism, we will deepen our understanding of these four traditions through a careful examination of primary sources in translation. The course will also incorporate field trips to Japanese Buddhist groups in the Chicago area.\n\nInstructor(s): Stephan Licha Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): EALC 21702\n\nRLST 22010-22011-22012. Jewish Civilization I-II-III.\n\nJewish Civilization is a three-quarter sequence that explores the development of Jewish culture and tradition from its ancient beginnings through its rabbinic and medieval transformations to its modern manifestations. Through investigation of primary texts—biblical, Talmudic, philosophical, mystical, historical, documentary, and literary—students will acquire a broad overview of Jews, Judaism, and Jewishness while reflecting in greater depth on major themes, ideas, and events in Jewish history. The Autumn course will deal with antiquity to the medieval period; the Winter course will begin with the early modern period and continue to the present. The Spring course will vary as to special topic; for the Spring course to count towards the general education requirement in civilization studies, the student must also take the Autumn and Winter courses. Note: Jewish Studies revised its civilization studies courses in academic year 2018–19. Students who began the requirement prior to Autumn Quarter 2018 under the previous course options, may complete it with those courses that remain available, or (with prior approval from the JWSC director of undergraduate studies) they may combine them with the new course options, provided that they fulfill the requirement to take one JWSC course in the ancient or medieval period and one in the modern period. Only students who have taken JWSC courses prior to academic year 2018–19 are eligible to complete the program under the prior system.\n\nRLST 22010. Jewish Civilization I: Ancient Beginnings to Medieval Period. 100 Units.\n\nJewish Civilization is a three-quarter sequence that explores the development of Jewish culture and tradition from its ancient beginnings through its rabbinic and medieval transformations to its modern manifestations. Through investigation of primary texts-biblical, Talmudic, philosophical, mystical, historical, documentary, and literary-students will acquire a broad overview of Jews, Judaism, and Jewishness while reflecting in greater depth on major themes, ideas, and events in Jewish history. The autumn course will deal with antiquity through the Middle Ages. Its readings will include material from the Bible and writings from the second temple, Hellenistic, rabbinic, and medieval periods. All sections of this course will share a common core of readings; individual instructors will supplement with other materials. It is recommended, though not required, that students take the three Jewish Civilization courses in sequence. Students who register for the Autumn Quarter course will automatically be pre-registered for the winter segment. In the Spring Quarter students have the option of taking a third unit of Jewish Civilization, a course whose topics will vary (JWSC 1200X).\n\nInstructor(s): Larisa Reznik Terms Offered: Autumn Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): JWSC 12000, MDVL 12000, HIST 11701, NEHC 22010\n\nRLST 22011.

Jewish Civilization III: Language, Creation, and Translation in Jewish Thought and Literature. 100 Units.\n\nJewish Civilization is a three-quarter sequence that explores the development of Jewish culture and tradition from its ancient beginnings through its rabbinic and medieval transformations to its modern manifestations. Through investigation of primary texts-biblical, Talmudic, philosophical, mystical, historical, documentary, and literary-students will acquire a broad overview of Jews, Judaism, and Jewishness while reflecting in greater depth on major themes, ideas, and events in Jewish history. The Spring course in 2021 will start with two stories from Genesis-the creation story and the story of the Tower of Babel in chapter 11-and consider the intertwined dynamics of language, creation, and translation in Jewish thought and literature. In addition to commentaries on both of these key texts, we will read philosophical and literary texts that illuminate the workings of language as a creative force and the dynamics of multilingualism and translation in the creation of Jewish culture. Through this lens, we will consider topics such as gender and sexuality, Jewish national identity, Zionism, the revival of the Hebrew language, Jewish responses to the Holocaust, and contemporary American Jewish culture.\n\nInstructor(s): Na'ama Rokem Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): Students who wish to take this course for Civilization Studies credit, must also take Jewish Civilization I and II.

Jewish Civilization III - Narratives of Assimilation. 100 Units.\n\nThis course offers a survey into the manifold strategies of representing the Jewish community in East Central Europe beginning from the nineteenth century to the Holocaust. Engaging the concept of liminality-of a society at the threshold of radical transformation-it will analyze Jewry facing uncertainties and challenges of the modern era and its radical changes. Students will be acquainted with problems of cultural and linguistic isolation, hybrid identity, assimilation, and cultural transmission through a wide array of genres-novel, short story, epic poem, memoir, painting, illustration, film. The course draws on both Jewish and Polish-Jewish sources; all texts are read in English translation.\n\nInstructor(s): Bozena Shallcross Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): JWSC 12005, NEHC 12005, REES 27005\n\nRLST 22015. Jewish Spaces and Places, Imagined and Real. 100 Units.\n\nWhat makes a ghetto, a ghetto? What defines a Jewish neighborhood? What determined the architectural form of synagogues? Taught in Special Collections in Regenstein Library and making extensive use of the textual and visual sources there, this course will analyze how Jews (in all their diversity) and non-Jews defined Jewish spaces and places. Sources will include: Jewish law and customary practice, cookbooks, etiquette guides, prints, films, novels, maps, memoirs, architectural drawings and photographs, and tourist guides. We may also take a field trip to the Oak Woods Cemetery. The focus will be on Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, but we will also venture back into the early modern period and across the Mediterranean to Palestine/Israel and North Africa and the Atlantic to the Caribbean and the Americas. We will study both actually existing structures and texts and visual culture in which Jewish places and spaces are imagined or vilified. Parallel to our work with primary sources we will read in the recent, very rich, scholarly literature on this topic. This is not a survey course; we will undertake a series of intensive case-studies through which we will address the larger issues. Assignments include: presentations (individual or collaborative), short papers, Canvas postings, and there will also be the option of making a digital map or an on-line exhibition. This is a limited-enrollment, discussion-based course. No previous knowledge of Jewish history is expected.\n\nInstructor(s): Leora Auslander Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): In order for a Spring course to qualify as a civilization course for the general education requirement, the student must also take Jewish Civilization I and II.

Interpreting the Gospel According to Matthew. 100 Units.\n\nAn exegesis course on \"the church's gospel,\" which will seek to create a constructive conversation between modern redaction-critical readings of Matthew as a document forged in heated interaction with a specific historical context (particularly defined by inter-/intra-Jewish polemics and the emergence of the \"ekklesia\" as distinct from the synagogue) and the history of interpretation and effects of this gospel in the ancient church and up to the present, including in film and other media. Each student will select an interpreter or interpretation--ancient, medieval, modern, post-modern--to impersonate in class discussions.\n\nInstructor(s): Margaret M. Mitchell Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): No language prerequisites. Greek skills are not required for this course, but ample opportunity will be provided for those who have Greek skills to exercise them (in reading the gospel itself in its original language), and students are encouraged to exercise their skills in any languages of translation and interpretation of this gospel, ancient, medieval or modern.\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HCHR 43103, BIBL 43100\n\nRLST 22035. The Acts of Paul and Thecla and the Pastoral Epistles. 100 Units.\n\nIn the early second century there were bitter battles over the legacy of Paul and his preserved letters in terms of gender, sexuality, family life, asceticism, church administration, and theological vision. We can see these well by reading the narrative text The Acts of Paul and Thecla alongside the \"Pastoral Epistles\" (1 and 2 Timothy, Titus), the former championing a female, cross-dressing ascetic Christ-missionary and the latter, in pseudepigraphical epistolary texts written in the dead Paul's name, insisting on patriarchal family life and women's adherence to traditional roles. In this course we shall read both sets of texts carefully in Greek, noting points of similarity and contestation, and test various models of how these sources-each of which seeks to \"fix\" the Pauline legacy in its own way-are related to one another. Time allowing, we shall also look at the later reception of the cult of Saint Thecla and late antique interpretations of \"the apostle,\" Paul, on these issues of sexuality and gender roles, and their perduring influence in contemporary debates.\n\nInstructor(s): Margaret Mitchell Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): At least one year of Greek, or equivalent.\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): BIBL 42035, GNSE 22035, GREK 27423, FNDL 22035, GNSE 42035, HCHR 42035, GREK 37423\n\nRLST 22036. The Johannine Epistles. 100 Units.\n\nThe Johannine Epistles raise fascinating theological and interpretative questions. In this course students will read the Greek text closely, examining the composition, genre, structure, theology, and purpose of these letters. Readings will also include New Testament and early Christian texts that help illuminate the hermeneutical questions and place of the Johannine epistles. Special attention will be paid to the questions surrounding the texts' authorship and reception within later Christian traditions.\n\nInstructor(s): Erin Walsh Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): Students must have completed two quarters of Koiné Greek or equivalent to enroll.\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CLCV 22024, BIBL 36000, CLAS 32024\n\nRLST 22110.

Athanasius on the Incarnation. 100 Units.\n\nAthanasius was born and reared in Alexandria where he received a thorough classical education. He eventually became secretary to the bishop Alexander, with whom he attended the Council of Nicaea in 325 and whom he succeeded as bishop of Alexandria in 328. For the rest of his life, both in his theological writings and in his turbulent ecclesiastical career, he was a fervent advocate for the Nicene formulations, resisting Arianism at every turn. His most famous work, the De Incarnatione, expounds how Jesus the Word, by becoming flesh, restores to fallen humans the image of God in which they were created. We will read a good part (about 60 pages) of this celebrated treatise with attention to Athanasius' straightforward Greek style, his portrait of the logos, and his enduring contribution to Trinitarian theology.\n\nInstructor(s): David Martinez Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): 2 years of Greek\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GREK 24124, GREK 34124, BIBL 42215\n\nRLST 22303.

It is meant both for students who have completed the first year Hebrew sequence in the Divinity School and others who would like to read Second Isaiah in Hebrew. We will focus on interpreting texts by attending to their grammatical, literary, and historical features.\n\nInstructor(s): Jeffrey Stackert Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): One year of Biblical Hebrew\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS or LMCS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): BIBL 45400\n\nRLST 22320. Colloquium on Ancient Christianity. 100 Units.\n\nA critical reading of influential narratives--both ancient and modern--of \"the 'rise' of 'Christianity'\" in the first four centuries, and the sources from which they are composed, asking the question: can such a narrative be told (if it can be told) in a way other than as a romance or a tragedy? Each week we shall analyze select primary sources (textual, artistic, architectural, on which students will give presentations) that illuminate crucial issues (e.g. demographics, conversion, race, persecution, martyrdom, asceticism, gender, ecclesiological and ritual structures, intellectual lineages, orthodoxy and heresy), personalities (e.g., Ignatius, Perpetua and Felicitas, Irenaeus, Antony, Melania the Elder and Melania the Younger, Eusebius, desert Fathers and Mothers, Constantine, Macrina, Augustine) and events. On-going reflection on the nature of historiography as a science and an art, involving both discovery and invention.\n\nInstructor(s): Margaret M.

Zen Before Zen: Chan Buddhism in China. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is part of a two-sequence series, to be followed by a course on Japanese Zen Buddhism taught by Professor Stephan Licha in Winter 2025. \"Chan\" is a partial Chinese transliteration of the Sanskrit word \"Dhyana,\" meaning meditation practice; the same Chinese character is pronounced \"Zen\" in Japanese. This course will consist of the close reading (in English translation) and discussion of both the Indian Buddhist scriptures and indigenous Chinese sources that form the core of the tradition spanning Chan and Zen, with a few secondary descriptions of Chan institutions and cultural influences. Our focus will be on the development of ideas concerning the nature of sentience and the implications this has for understanding the existential predicament of sentient beings, touching on central themes of dependent co-arising, non-self, Emptiness, consciousness-only, Buddha-nature and original enlightenment, and the methods of realization (doctrinal, non-doctrinal, and indeed anti-doctrinal) proposed to redress this existential predicament at each stage of Chan history. This will be done both with an eye to the historical continuity of these sometimes seemingly contradictory forms thought and practice, and also to extract from them whatever transhistorical philosophical and spiritual valences we care to derive from the texts.\n\nInstructor(s): Brook Ziporyn Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS or CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): DVPR 32402, EALC 22401, HREL 32400, EALC 32401\n\nRLST 22402. Japanese Zen Buddhism. 100 Units.\n\nWhat is Zen? Impossibly, seemingly, everything to everybody. In this course, we will explore Zen's protean transformations through a close reading of primary sources in translation. Rather than asking what Zen is, we will focus on how in these materials the Zen traditions are continually de/re-constructed as contingent religious identities from medieval Japan to the contemporary United States and Europe. The focus of the course will be the premodern Japanese Zen tradition, its background in Chinese Chan, and its reception in the West. The course will include field trips to Zen communities in the Chicago area. Students wishing to take this course are strongly encouraged to also take Prof. Ziporyn's course on Chan during the fall quarter.\n\nInstructor(s): Stephan Licha Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS or SCSR Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): EALC 32402, EALC 22402, HREL 32402\n\nRLST 22501. Foundations of East Asian Buddhism. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is an introduction to Buddhism in East Asia, examined through lenses of texts, art, and thought. We will examine important sources of the major currents of East Asian Buddhist thought and practice stretching from the earliest days of the religion in China to the East Asian Buddhist world of today, giving special consideration to major textual and artistic monuments, such as translated scriptures, Chan/Zen literature, paintings and sculptures, and pilgrimage sites.\n\nInstructor(s): P.

The Reformation in Britain, 1450-1660. 100 Units.\n\nThe Reformation in Britain is one of the most contested areas in early modern history. Was it mostly a political event, triggered by Henry VIII's desire for a divorce? Was it an organic movement from the ground up, inspired by the enthusiasm of ordinary believers in the same way as many reform movements in continental Europe? Did it have a distinctive theology of its own: can we call this 'Anglicanism'? Should we be studying the 'British Reformation' on its own terms at all, or should it be viewed simply as an offshoot of the continental European Reformations? And did the puritans really want to cancel Christmas? This course will give students a thorough grounding in the Reformation in Britain c.1450-1660, paying especial attention to the complex historiographical issues that still plague the topic to this day. Students will have the opportunity to study a range of key primary texts from the era, from John Foxe's Book of Martyrs to the letters of Queen Elizabeth I, as well as to examine the modern-day legacies of English reform.\n\nInstructor(s): Kirsten Macfarlane Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 31206, HCHR 32604, HIST 21206\n\nRLST 22655. Themes in the European Reformation(s) 100 Units.\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the study of the Reformation(s) in early modern Europe. As well as covering the key theological ideas of famous Protestant reformers (Luther; Zwingli; Calvin), it will give ample space to the impact that these religious revolutions had on contemporary society, including attitudes to gender, politics, economics, and visual/material culture. It will cover the reformations and renewals undergone by Catholicism in the same period, and discuss the key arguments, questions, and concerns which have preoccupied historians of the Reformation since the nineteenth century. Students will have the opportunity to read and engage with famous texts from the period (for instance Erasmus's On Free Will; Luther's 95 Theses; Calvin's Institutes) as well as lesser-known but still influential works (e.g. the poetry of the female Italian humanist Olympia Fulvia Morata and the writings of early Jesuit missionaries to China and Japan), in addition to historically significant documents (such as contemporary witchcraft confessions and extracts from Reformation demonologies). Finally, there will be time devoted to unpacking the complex legacies of the Reformation and the 'unintended consequences' attributed to it, focusing especially on the afterlives of Max Weber's analyses.\n\nInstructor(s): Kirsten Macfarlane Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 23010\n\nRLST 22667. The Christian Right. 100 Units.\n\nFrom the Gilded Age to the age of Donald Trump, conservatives Christians have played a major role in shaping American politics and culture. This course will use primary and secondary sources to explore the development of the Christian Right in the United States. We will answer essential questions about the movement: Who joins it? Who leads it? And who funds it? We will examine how conservative Christians approach not only \"moral\" issues like abortion but also issues like economic regulation and foreign policy. Finally, we will seek to answer the question: What is the future of the Christian Right in an increasingly diverse America?\n\nInstructor(s): William Schultz Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 27719, RAME 35700, AMER 22667, HIST 37719, HCHR 35700, AMER 35700\n\nRLST 22812. Introduction to Hinduism. 100 Units.\n\nWhat is Hinduism? Variously described as a world religion, a way of life, the basis of a national culture, and more, this course will consider how a multiplicity of traditions has become a singular \"Hinduism\" and, critically, what is left out. Beginning with the Vedic period in the first-millennium B.C.E and moving to our present day, we will track how complex historical interactions between Buddhists, Jains, Muslims-and eventually the British-produced the modern category of Hinduism. Students will become familiar with central religious tenets (including dharma, artha, kāma, and mokṣa), sectarian traditions such as Vaiṣṇavism, Śavism, and Śaktism, and religious literature ranging from epic to devotional poetry. As we will see, Hinduism is a flexible and elastic term that names a shifting religious identity and community.\n\nInstructor(s): Sarah Pierce Taylor Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course counts as a Gateway course for RLST majors/minors.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SALC 22812\n\nRLST 23002. Technê and Technique. 100 Units.\n\nIn European thought, the relationship between technê (craft or art) and epistêmê (knowledge) has long been a fraught one. Crucially, the practical knowledge associated with skill or art in making is often subordinated to more abstract forms of knowledge production such as mathematics or philosophy itself; and in the sphere of art, poets and critics often make a distinction between 'mere' technique and higher or unmediated forms of artistic expression. In this course, we will examine philosophical and artistic assumptions and arguments about technê, technics, and technique by staging a broad conversation between poets and philosophers; and we will consider recent discussions of technê and the impact that modern scientific technology has on the nature of thinking and artistic making. Readings will be drawn from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Heidegger, and from poetic works ranging from ancient epics to Wallace Stevens and beyond. Final projects may include critical essays, creative projects, or creative/critical works.\n\nInstructor(s): Ryan Coyne and Srikanth Reddy Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course meets the CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENGL 43002, ENGL 23002, DVPR 43002\n\nRLST 23023. Self-Deception: What is it and How is it possible? 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar considers philosophical, theological, and literary accounts of self-deception, with the goal of helping participants understand why the very idea of self-deception seems paradoxical, even as it also seems to be a ubiquitous phenomenon. Self-deception seems paradoxical because the very same agent is both the deceiver and the deceived. What must the self be like, such that this paradoxical behavior is possible? The seminar will first consider a variety of theoretical accounts of self-deception and related phenomena, drawn from a wide array of sources, that range from Freud and Sartre to contemporary analytic philosophy. We will then consider whether literary portraits of self-deception do a better job of revealing its key aspects. Finally, we will consider the original question, \"What must the self be like, such that self-deception is possible?\" as a religious and theological question that invites to think about self-deception functions in the lives of religious adherents.\n\nInstructor(s): William Wood Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): This course meets the CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): THEO 33023\n\nRLST 23104. Immanuel Kant's Critique of Practical Reason. 100 Units.\n\nContemporary ideas about Human Rights, the relation of moral norms and the good life, the character of human freedom, conceptions of human evil, and the very definition of morality and ethics have been decisively shaped by the work of Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). This course is the examination of one of Immanuel Kant's magisterial works in moral philosophy, The Critique of Practical Reason. The course is a careful reading of Kant's text in order to grasp the argument and to assess its significance for current work in Ethics. The course ends with one of Kant's famous political essays, \"On Perpetual Peace.\" Engaging Kant's work will enable student to engage a wide range of thinkers from the 19th to the 21st centuries who accept, modify, and reject his work. In this way, the course is crucial for further work in philosophical and religious ethics. This class will be conducted through conversation over assigned reading. Those who can read German may use those texts and bring them to class. There will be two papers for the class on topics assigned by the instructor. The papers are to be 5-7 pages in length, double spaced.\n\nInstructor(s): William Schweiker Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Graduate students must petition to enroll.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): FNDL 23104, GRMN 23104\n\nRLST 23150. Capitalism and Doing Good? 100 Units.\n\nThis class asks the question: is it possible to believe in capitalism (i.e., the private ownership of wealth) and do good for society? Restated, are there values that can accompany capital accumulation for positive social impact on people and the environment?\n\nInstructor(s): Dwight Hopkins Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): This course meets the Perspectives requirement for the Business Economics Specialization in ECON.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GLST 23150\n\nRLST 23200. Faith: A Conceptual History. 100 Units.\n\nA close examination of the concept of faith in Christian theological sources and in modern European philosophy: what is faith? How does its meaning change over time? What are the major models of faith among recent and contemporary Christian theologians? To what extent is theology the \"self-understanding of faith\"?

We will explore questions such as: What are the common realities that religious and psychiatric frameworks seek to explain? Are being \"divinely inspired\" and being \"mad\" mutually exclusive? How do religious and other cultural categories shape the development of what are called \"mental disorders\"? Are cognitive behavioural therapists more effective than witchdoctors at restoring people to health? We will begin with a brief overview of the history of psychiatry, before analyzing a famous case of mass demonic possession in 17th century France. We will take several weeks to explore contemporary psychiatric diagnoses, contrasting how psychiatrists and religious authors describe similar symptoms in different ways. We will compare diverse therapeutic methods, modern and traditional, to ask what makes each of them effective or ineffective. Finally, we will survey proposed alternatives to the prevailing diagnostic frameworks within psychiatry, asking which, if any, our study of the overlapping domains of religion and psychiatry might lend support.\n\nInstructor(s): Owen Joyce-Coughlin Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ANTH 23301, HLTH 23300, CCTS 23300\n\nRLST 23304. Abolitionist Theologies. 100 Units.\n\nHow might religions activate the abolitionist imagination? The contemporary abolition movement is not just about dismantling prisons or the police. It is about imagining alternatives to this apparatus of fear, punishment, and scarcity-and experimenting with new modes of living together premised on mutual aid rather than state power. Many abolitionist thinkers thus see abolition as a sacred force interrupting the normalized brutalities of everyday life. This course focuses on Jewish, Christian, and Islamic theologies that interrogate incarceration, capitalism, the war on terror, and the settler colonial state. We will analyze the possibilities and limits of these theologies as revolutionary resources. Our readings will include a variety of genres: scriptural interpretation, spiritual autobiography, and speculative fiction. No prior experience with academic theology or abolition required.\n\nInstructor(s): Olivia Bustion Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GLST 23304, RDIN 23304\n\nRLST 23507. Power and Responsibility in the Anthropocene. 100 Units.\n\nHumanity's immense impact on Earth's systems has led some scientists to claim that we have entered a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. Humans' influence on Earth's landscape, climate system, and biodiversity inspires many to ask, in turn, What should be done about humankind's planetary powers? Some scholars and religious leaders claim that people should take responsibility and influence Earth's systems for good ends, while others argue that we should radically scale down such power. Still others suggest that the Anthropocene requires us to entirely revise our ideas of power and responsibility and even develop new religious sensibilities. Through discussions and focused writing assignments, students in this class will explore and evaluate these and additional responses to the Anthropocene, paying specific attention to how Anthropocene ethical thought wrestles with the place of religion on a changing planet. The course culminates in an extended examination of how Anthropocene discourse conceals racial antagonisms and contemporary decolonial struggles.\n\nInstructor(s): Colin Weaver Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CEGU 23507, GLST 23507, ANTH 23507, RDIN 23507\n\nRLST 23590. Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil. 100 Units.\n\nA close reading, in translation, of Nietzsche's famous 1886 work, Beyond Good and Evil. We will consider its major themes and arguments, paying close attention to the transition which this book marks in Nietzsche's corpus as a whole. Themes to be discussed: the doctrine of the Will to Power, the Revaluation of Values, the doctrine of the Eternal Return, the critique of religion.\n\nInstructor(s): Ryan Coyne Terms Offered: not being offered 24-25\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GRMN 23590, FNDL 23590\n\nRLST 23599. Christian and Anti-Christian: Kierkegaard and Nietzsche on Religion and Morality. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores two radically different assessments of religion and morality, one by the Protestant thinker Søren Kierkegaard, and the other by an arch-critic of religion and \"morality,\" Friedrich Nietzsche. The course will focus on their assessments of religious faith and its relation to morality and the human good. We will explore Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling and also Nietzsche's works, On the Genealogy of Morals. The course moves in interlocking moments: an inquiry into Kierkegaard's and Nietzsche's account of religion and its moral outlook, and their outlooks on how best to live given their assessments of religion and morality. Additionally, the course will explore their styles of writing and the relation between style and the purpose and content of their thought. The general aim of the course, then, is to explore two seminal minds in the development of Western thought with the question in mind of their possible contribution to current religious and ethical thinking.\n\nInstructor(s): William Schweiker Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course meets the CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RETH 33599, THEO 33599, FNDL 23599\n\nRLST 23600. Evil: Myth, Symbol and Reality. 100 Units.\n\nFrom the horrors of the Shoah to violence suffered by individuals, the question of the origin, meaning, and reality of evil done by humans has vexed thinkers throughout the ages. This seminar is an inquiry into the problem of evil on three registers of reflection: myth, symbol, and reality. We will be exploring important philosophical, Jewish, and Christian texts. These include Martin Buber, Good and Evil, Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem, Immanuel Kant, Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone, Paul Ricoeur, The Symbolism of Evil, Edward Farley, Good and Evil, Hans Jonas, Mortality and Morality and Claudia Card, The Atrocity Paradigm. There will also be a viewing of the movie Seven (1995) directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. Accordingly, the seminar probes the reality of evil and the symbolic and mythic resources of religious traditions to articulate the meaning and origin of human evil. The question of \"theodicy\" is then not the primary focus given the seminar's inquiry into the fact and reality of human evil. Each student will submit a 5-7 page critical review of either Jonathan Glover's Humanity: A Moral History of the 20th Century or Susan Neiman's, Evil in Modern Thought. Each Student also will write a 15 page (double spaced;12pt font) paper on one or more of the texts read in the course with respect to her or his own research interests.\n\nInstructor(s): William Schweiker Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS or CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GRMN 23623, RETH 33600, GRMN 33623, FNDL 23600, THEO 33600, JWSC 23600\n\nRLST 23608. Worshipping the God that Dances: Embodied Forms of Knowledge, Self, and Divinity. 100 Units.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche wrote, \"I would only believe in a god that knows how to dance.\" This course will use Nietzsche's comment as a springboard for critical philosophical exploration of embodied theories of knowledge, reality, and the divine. Along the way, we will leverage the image of a 'dancing god' to interrogate philosophical and religious dichotomies in both Western and Eastern traditions (e.g., between sacred/profane, theory/praxis, transcendence/immanence, masculine/feminine). Some traditions have used the metaphor of dance to theorize about a god of dynamic becoming vs. a \"wallflower\" god of static being. Contemporary cognitive scientists, inspired by Buddhist philosophy, speculate that selfhood might resemble something like an embodied form of \"dance,\" rather than a substantial mode of existence. How, then, can the notion of a \"dancing god\" challenge orthodox, atemporal, or disembodied conceptions of God, reality, and human experience? In what ways does a practical 'knowing how' differ from a purely theoretical 'knowing that'-and how does this impact the meaning and purpose of religious life? Readings will include Nietzsche, Durkheim, William James, Charles Hartshorne, Michael Polanyi, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others; no prior experience with the philosophy of religion is required.\n\nInstructor(s): Jesse Berger Terms Offered: Spring\n\nRLST 23816. Hope in Theological, Philosophical, and Political Perspective. 100 Units.\n\nWhat is hope? What role does it play in our lives? What role can it play in our politics? Is it a virtue-theological or otherwise? When is hope problematic? What happens when people lose hope? To address questions like these, this course will consider a wide range of recent work on the topic, from authors including Gabriel Marcel, Josef Pieper, Adrienne Martin, Cheshire Calhoun, Katie Stockdale, Kelly Brown Douglas, and Michael Lamb.\n\nInstructor(s): Kevin Hector Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): This course meets the CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): DVPR 43816, KNOW 23816, THEO 43816\n\nRLST 23830. Simone Weil: Spirituality, Metaphysics, and Politics. 100 Units.\n\nSimone Weil, one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century, developed her thought as an extension of her spirituality and her political commitments. In this course, then, we will read her principal works together in order to see how these three themes hang together: spirituality, metaphysics, and politics.\n\nInstructor(s): Kevin Hector Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): This course meets the CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): DVPR 43830, FNDL 23830\n\nRLST 23880. Villains: Evil in Philosophy, Religion, and Film. 100 Units.\n\nYou don't really understand an antagonist,\" screenwriter John Rogers writes, \"until you understand why he's a protagonist in his own version of the world.\" This principle holds true of movie villains, but also raises important questions about disagreement, dehumanization, and the diabolical in the real world. Are our enemies truly malicious, or just misunderstood? How does a person become a monster, and how does a person avoid it? Why are some villains so compelling, and what does this say about the good life? Do Hollywood movies enrich or distort how we imagine and respond to real-world evil? Did Thanos do anything wrong? This course combines readings from philosophical classics and religious traditions with comparative analyses of villains in films from 101 Dalmatians (1956) and Jaws (1975) to The Dark Knight (2008) and Black Panther (2018). Students will discuss antagonists' motivations, evaluate the visions of morality filmmakers are presupposing, and develop more nuanced understandings of ethics and moral psychology. No prior experience in religious studies or film criticism is required.\n\nInstructor(s): Russell Johnson Terms Offered: Winter\n\nRLST 23908. Bergson and China: Buddhist and Confucian Reboots. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will explore Henri Bergson's philosophy as set forth in Time and Free Will, Matter and Memory, and Creative Evolution, and its reception in late Imperial and early Republican China (late 19th and early 20th centuries). Of special interest will be the role played by Bergsonian ideas in the Yogacara revival and the formation of New Confucianism during this period, with particular focus on figures like Zhang Taiyan, Xiong Shili and Liang Shumin. This will require us to deeply engage Bergson's idea of \"duration\" (durée) and its interpretation, particularly in relation to a reconsideration of the Yogacara Buddhist notion of ālaya-consciousness (storehouse consciousness) and the Confucian idea of ceaseless generation and regeneration (shengsheng bu xi) as derived from interpretive traditions centered on the Book of Changes (Yijing).\n\nInstructor(s): Brook Ziporyn Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): All readings will be available in English.

Modern European Philosophy of Religion: 17th Century to the Present. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will examine the historical emergence of the philosophy of religion, in the European context, as a discrete area of inquiry. Thinkers to be considered include Descartes, Pascal, Spinoza, Locke, Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Feuerbach, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Arendt. No prerequisites.\n\nInstructor(s): Ryan Coyne Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS or CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): DVPR 34001, THEO 34001\n\nRLST 24002. Is Religion Bad for Women? 100 Units.\n\nSome scholars working in the study of gender and sexuality view religion as the conservative enemy of progress, irreconcilably antagonistic to the flourishing of any non-normative gender or sexuality. At the same time, some religious practitioners view feminism as a Western or liberal invention, an imposition that attempts to manage the lives of religious subjects. Still others find feminism and religious commitment mutually reinforcing, and have developed feminist, womanist, and queer rituals and theologies. This course examines contemporary texts, ethnographies, memoirs, and films that grapple with these tensions. In so doing, the course also helps students develop familiarity with foundational categories both in religious studies and in the study of gender and sexuality. Further questions to be explored include: Does religion facilitate or oppose the flourishing of women, queers, and people of color? Is religion a guardian of tradition that resists politically progressive aims, or do religions offer resources for interrogating secular liberalism? The course primarily considers Islamic, Christian, and Jewish traditions. Prior coursework in religious studies or gender and sexuality studies is helpful but not necessary.\n\nInstructor(s): Hannah Jones Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GNSE 12130, RDIN 25002, GLST 24002\n\nRLST 24102. Justice in an Unjust World: Theories of Justice. 100 Units.\n\nJustice as a possibility, an ideal, and as a telos is fundamental to theological and philosophical systems of ethics. Yet, each theory was formulated within and against a deeply unjust world. Every theory of justice implies an anthropology and an ontology, and each asks the question: Why isn't life fair? How can we can we create a just society against a world that is so obviously unjust? Each theory then proposes a just solution and every theory implies a set of practices that can be interrogated. As our contemporary society becomes more sharply divided, the issues of distribution, obligation, entitlement, fair exchanges of social goods and labor, and the fair sharing of social burdens becomes more important and demanding of more inquiry. This seminar will interrogate several theories of justice, beginning in classic Hellenistic texts and moving forward to the animating theories of the classic liberal tradition: libertarianism, utilitarianism, social contract theory, and Marxism. We will then turn to other sources of justice theory such as Catholic liberation theology, capacity theory, and Jewish justice theory. We will also use our seminar to explore contemporary cases in law, medicine, science and policy that raise issues of justice and injustice. While the seminar will focus on distributive practices, we will also explore how these practices structure our systems of retributive and restorative justice.\n\nInstructor(s): Laurie Zoloth Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course counts as an elective course for the \"Inequality, Social Problems, and Change\" minor.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GLST 24202, PBPL 23305\n\nRLST 24116. Buddhism and the Good Life. 100 Units.\n\nForbes Magazine has styled the Tibetan Buddhist monk Mingyur Rinpoche, \"the happiest man alive.\" Like no other religion, Buddhism in the public imagination is associated with providing us with an accessible way towards leading a good and happy life. But what is the \"good life\" according to the Buddhist tradition, and what is \"happiness\" supposed to lead us towards? In this course, we will explore these questions through a close reading of Buddhist sources in translation. Through these readings the course will introduce the doctrinal and practical foundations of the Buddhist traditions and serve as a gateway to more specialized studies.\n\nInstructor(s): Stephan Licha Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): This course counts as a Gateway course for RLST majors/minors.\n\nRLST 24200. Philosophy and Literature in India. 100 Units.\n\nIs philosophy literature? Is literature philosophy? What constitutes either of these seemingly disparate enterprises, formally and thematically, and what kinds of conjunctions can we imagine between them (philosophy in/of/as literature)? Can one translate these terms across cultures? Are they the sole prerogative of leisured elites, or can they harbor and cultivate voices of dissent? Above all, what does it mean to reflect on these categories outside the parochial context of the Western world? This course explores these questions by introducing some of the literary cultures, philosophical traditions, religious poetry, and aesthetic theories of the South Asian subcontinent. Students will encounter a variety of genres including scriptural commentary, drama and courtly poetry, and the autobiography. Readings, all in translation, will range from Sanskrit literature to Sufi romances and more.\n\nInstructor(s): Anand Venkatkrishnan Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CMLT 24202, SIGN 26073, SALC 20903\n\nRLST 24550. Major Trends in Islamic Mysticism. 100 Units.\n\nAn examination of Islamic mysticism, commonly known as Sufism, through secondary English literature and translations of premodern Arabic Sufi texts. The goal is to gain firsthand insight into the diverse literary expressions of Islamic spirituality in their historical context, and to understand exactly what, how, and why Sufis say what they say.\n\nInstructor(s): Yousef Casewit Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): This course meets the CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GLST 24550, NEHC 24550, NEHC 32419, MDVL 24550, SIGN 26068, ISLM 32419\n\nRLST 24567. Islamic Psychology. 100 Units.\n\nAn exploration of the growing body of secondary literature on Islamic psychology.

Buddhist Meditation: Tradition, Transformation, Modernization. 100 Units.\n\nFrom the Satipaṭṭhāna sutta of the Pāli canon to the \"mindfulness\" boom of recent years, Buddhism and meditation often appear inseparable. The aim of this seminar is to historicize and critically question this seemingly natural intimacy, for while it certainly cannot be denied that the various Buddhist traditions have always had on offer a plethora of techniques for mental (and physical) cultivation, it is far from clear how or even if all these could be subsumed under the in its current usage relatively recent category of \"meditation\". Drawing on Buddhist meditation literature from various traditions, historical periods, and literary genre, in this seminar we will take up a twofold question: First, how has the encounter with Buddhist techniques of cultivation shaped the modern understanding of \"meditation\", and second, up to which extend, and at what cost, has this very modern understanding conversely conditioned us to see Buddhism as a \"meditative religion\" par excellence?\n\nInstructor(s): Stephan Licha Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SALC 34600, SALC 24600, EALC 34600, HREL 34600, HIST 34122, HIST 24122, EALC 24609\n\nRLST 24806. Creation and Human Creatures: Theological Explorations. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will explore the intersection between theological symbols (doctrines) of creation and human creatures. How are macrocosm and microcosm drawn into theological reflection and construction? How have human and other living creatures and nature served as reference points, exemplars, even counter examples for interpreting divine creation and the enhancement (or diminishment) of life? Explorations will include traditional theological themes of human creatures as the imago Dei and of nature as a mirror of God's providence and majesty, as well as philosophical and literary texts on human and animal nature, the moral sense of nature, and cultivation and devastation.\n\nInstructor(s): Kristine Culp Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course meets the CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): THEO 44806, CHSS 44806\n\nRLST 24901. Religion and Human Rights. 100 Units.\n\nReligion played a crucial, but often overlooked, role in the development of post-World War II conceptions of human rights, providing principles and ideas that continue to influence contemporary human rights debates in the fields of law, public policy, and international relations. This no-prior-knowledge-necessary course explores the complex, sometimes fraught, relationship between religion and human rights from World War II to the present. We will begin by juxtaposing the role religious ideas played in the drafting of core post-war human rights documents (e.g. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, etc.) with the decision by drafters to omit direct references to the divine or the beliefs of specific religious communities. Using case study analysis and close reading of primary religious texts, scholarly commentary, and historical accounts, we will examine the ways in which individuals and groups from multiple religious (and non-religious) traditions both apply and push back against existing human rights norms. Throughout the course we will discuss the role religion might play in debates surrounding emerging, but still contentious, conceptions of human rights. This includes: universal healthcare, LGBTQIA+ rights, ever more complex manifestations of religious freedom, as well as whether human rights as conceived of in the mid-20th Century can be reconciled with decolonial and post-colonial perspectives.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): DEMS 24901, GLST 24902, HMRT 24901, GNSE 24903\n\nRLST 24920.

What is the role of contemplation in such theologies? How do they approach metaphysics, ethics, and politics?\n\nInstructor(s): Kevin Hector Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course meets the CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): THEO 44920, DVPR 44920\n\nRLST 25122. Modern Philosophy of Religion: A Historical Perspective. 100 Units.\n\nThe course will start by looking at the intellectual connections of several major figures in 18th and 19th century philosophy of religion. We will examine David Hume's \"Essay on Miracles\" and Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, Søren Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling, John Stuart Mill's \"The Utility of Religion,\" Friedrich Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morality, and selections from William James's The Varieties of Religious Experience. In the last third of the course we will examine more recent writers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Emmanuel Levinas. The goal of the course is to present and to assess different ways in which philosophers have conceived of and argued for or against religious belief.

History, Religion, and Politics in Augustine's City of God. 100 Units.\n\nAugustine's City of God is a major work of history, politics, and religion. Written after Rome was sacked by the Visigoths in 410, the work begins an apology (justification) of the Empire's turn to Christianity and expands to offer a sweeping and deeply theological account of human history and society in terms of earth-bound versus heaven-centered community. Augustine's citizenship and politics entails living out membership in either fellowship while commingled on earth with the other. Augustine analyzes Roman history and politics as well as the new religion first encouraged and eventually imposed in the wake of Constantine's conversion. We shall read the entire work in translation, attending to historical observations, political stances, and religious views. Augustine made arguments of his own but saved huge swaths of Varro and other otherwise lost sources to fashion his historical critique of Rome, social analysis, and many ultimately fresh views on matters like human sexuality in paradise and in heaven. The class will meet once a week. A supplementary Latin reading group will also convene once a week for close reading of important and demanding selections in the original. There will be some invited international guest speakers.\n\nInstructor(s): Willemien Otten and Michael I. Allen Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Latin is helpful but not necessary.

The Bible in U.S. Politics: The Use and Abuse of Sacred Texts in the Public. 100 Units.\n\nPeople across the political spectrum continue to cite the Bible to justify their viewpoints. Black Lives Matter protestors carried signs citing scriptural support for the rights of African Americans to life and justice, while some of those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6th first marched around their state capitols in recreation of biblical Israel's circling of the doomed city Jericho. How can the same book serve the political ends of such ideologically distinct movements? In this course, we will explore the variety of ways in which the Bible, especially the Christian New Testament, informs contemporary political discourse. We will discuss what the Bible is and where it comes from, and how an interpreter's social location and culturally and historical-bound assumptions shape their interpretation. We will build upon this foundation by examining several contentious political issues in which the Bible is commonly invoked, including abortion, sexuality, immigration, and gun rights. We will analyze the key passages used by supporters of various policy positions to support their claims, situating these texts in their original contexts and highlighting the historical distance that problematizes their use today. Prior familiarity with biblical literature is not required.\n\nInstructor(s): Douglas Hoffer Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): FNDL 25405, GNSE 25403, AMER 25400, KNOW 25400\n\nRLST 25510. Christianity, Nonviolence, and Realism. 100 Units.\n\nThis course investigates the connections between personal spiritual development and social engagement with justice movements. What, if any, effect does personal belief and faith have in directing political will? How does nonviolent resistance encounter the institutional realities of social advocacy? And lastly, in what ways are religious orientations challenged by globalized financial systems and power structures? The nonviolent religious philosophies of Howard Thurman and Daniel Berrigan will be contextualized within their respective Christian traditions and interreligious commitments. We will then encounter the challenge of Political Realism through the works of Reinhold Niebuhr and Samantha Power to interrogate the place of personal faith commitments within a pluralized society and the concrete realities of war, peace, and international conflict.\n\nInstructor(s): Foster Pinkney Terms Offered: Spring\n\nRLST 25591. Never Forget? Memorialization and the Ethics of Memory. 100 Units.\n\nPhilosopher George Santayana famously stated that \"those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" This widely shared sentiment presupposes an uncomplicated responsibility to remember the past. Is memory, however, an unalloyed good? Can there ever be too much memory or even harmful memory? How do we commemorate past injustices? Do we ever have an obligation to forgive and forget? In this course, we will examine different conceptions of memory offered by religious thinkers, philosophers, and historians. We will then compare theories that articulate the basis for memorial norms, duties, and responsibilities. To conclude the course, we will use the theories canvassed in the first two parts to evaluate two contemporary memory issues: the debate over \"working-off-the-past\" (Vergangenheitsaufarbeitung) in relation to crimes perpetrated by Nazi Germany, and the legacy of the Civil War in the United States. By the end of this course, students will be able to address a wide array of moral problems related to memory, such as whether and how we should remember the dead, past atrocities, revolutionary triumphs, and terrorist attacks. There are no prerequisites for this course.\n\nInstructor(s): Zachary Taylor Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nRLST 25704. Environmental Justice in Chicago. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will examine the development of environmental justice theory and practice through social scientific and ethical literature about the subject as well as primary source accounts of environmental injustices. We will focus on environmental justice issues in Chicago including, but not limited to waste disposal, toxic air and water, the Chicago heat wave, and climate change. Particular attention will be paid to environmental racism and the often understudied role of religion in environmental justice theory and practice. Throughout the course we will explore how normative commitments are expressed in different types of literature as well as the basis for normative judgments and the types of authorities authors utilize and claim as they consider environmental justice.\n\nInstructor(s): Sarah Fredericks Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Graduate students can enroll with permission of instructor and will have additional requirements.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 25704, KNOW 25704, ENST 25704, HMRT 25704, PBPL 25704, CHST 25704, CEGU 25704, AMER 25704\n\nRLST 25706. Climate Justice. 100 Units.\n\nClimate injustice includes the disproportionate effects of climate change on people who benefit little from the activities that cause it, generally the poor, people of color, and people marginalized in other ways. Given the complex economic, physical, social, and political realities of climate change, what might climate justice entail? This course explores this complex question through an examination of classical and contemporary theories of justice; the gendered, colonial, and racial dimensions of climate change; and climate justice movements.\n\nInstructor(s): Sarah Fredericks Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Graduates may enroll only with permission of the instructor.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GLST 25766, RDIN 25706, KNOW 25706, CEGU 25706, PBPL 25706, ENST 25706, GNSE 25702, HMRT 25706\n\nRLST 26001. Religion and Visual Culture in the Late Antique Mediterranean. 100 Units.\n\nIn this seminar, we examine sacred sites and artifacts of early Christians and their neighbors in the regions around the Mediterranean from the third century to about 750 CE. Case studies will illustrate the wealth of religious art and architecture associated with different religions that existed side by side-Christianity, Judaism, polytheism, and emerging Islam. This course has five main objectives: (1) to examine how the designs of religious spaces, buildings, and objects respond to specific spiritual or ritualistic needs; (2) to gain familiarity with typical features characterizing the arts of each religion or sect; (3) to identify elements of a common visual language that result from shared traditions or artistic cross-pollination; (4) to examine different ways in which material artifacts were employed as means of ideological propaganda; and (5) to study art and architecture as evidence of doctrinal competition and conflict. While this course foregrounds the study of material culture, written sources (in translation) complement the analysis of the visual evidence.\n\nInstructor(s): Karin Krause Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS or LMCS Committee distribution for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HCHR 36001, MDVL 26001, CLAS 36024, NEHC 26001, JWSC 26020, ARTH 26001, RLVC 36001, ARTH 36001, CLCV 26024\n\nRLST 26006. Embodiment and the Senses. 100 Units.\n\nThis course approaches bodies as points of insight into governance, the varied experiences of being governed, and efforts to evade and reconfigure institutional expressions of authority. First, we will examine bodies as targets of governance, objects to be reformed, regulated, contained, disciplined, educated, incarcerated, treated, trained, and \"cared\" for. Next, we will consider how bodies accrue power as sites of resistance, refusal, and critique. Certain bodies in certain places elicit discomfort, unsettling familiar divisions such as of private and public space, of developed and backward, of religious and secular, of reason and madness, of citizenship and (often racialized) non-citizenship. Finally, we will ask how bodies and sensory practices figure in ethical projects of crafting exemplary kinds of subjectivity or collectivity. In this way, the course will introduce students to anthropological approaches to embodiment as well as related questions of bio-politics, gender and race, political subjectivity, care and self-making, post/colonialism, sensory politics and the aesthetic. Along the way, students will gain a new appreciation of the political potency of bodies and bodily practices near and far-from Lenin's preserved body to Trump's \"small\" hands, reproductive labor to sex work, dirty protest to women's marches, indigenous eco-rituals to queer intimacies.\n\nInstructor(s): Mareike Winchell\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ANTH 20006, GNSE 24006\n\nRLST 26337. Race, Justice, and the Assemblage of American Moralities. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores the racial and moral imperatives that are encapsulated within concepts of \"Americanness\" and the theoretical notions that define the discursive, historical, and sociopolitical boundaries of American identities. How have claims to American identity relied on created religious or religiously-inflected Others? Together, we will consider how the human phenomena of religion and race have developed across our histories in concert with one another. How do racial and moral imperatives the define discursive, historical, and sociopolitical boundaries of American identities? We will examine how these formations have been deployed, defined, and bent to fit particular historical and cultural contexts while continuing to inform each other in a variety of permutations, especially in the United States. How do race and religion also intersect with gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and politics? Our theoretical grounding in migration, encounters, and transnational mobilities will provide insigh"
