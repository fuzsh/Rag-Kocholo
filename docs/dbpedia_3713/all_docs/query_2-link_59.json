        "text": "A look at the Dalai Lama’s quest to understand the relationship between Buddhism and science. “An uplifting and optimistic documentary about the Dalai Lama’s meetings with scientists from around the world to find commonalities among Buddhist science and western science to promote health, understanding and compassion for all.”\n\nSource: IMDB\n\nBuy or rent: Vimeo\n\n“Under cover of darkness and with no word of his plans, much-beloved Tibetan Buddhist Meditation Master Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche walked away from his life on the international stage to live that of a wandering yogi. Unheard of among eminent teachers today, such a practice is rife with hardships. For Mingyur Rinpoche, these challenges – begging, finding food and shelter, illness, and all the attendant risks of wandering incognito from place to place with the barest of possessions – present fertile ground for deepening insight into the true nature of the mind.”\n\nPremiering soon and available for pre-order.\n\n“Tiger’s Nose is an 80-year-old Tibetan.

Told through the eyes of one of Kangyur Rinpoche’s first Western students, New Zealander Kim Hegan, who now after more than forty years since Kangyur Rinpoche’s passing will trace the journey he made from New Zealand to Darjeeling 45 years earlier, to tell Rinpoche’s story.”\n\nLearn more.\n\n“In September 2006, two unlikely groups of people crossed paths in the snow-capped Himalayas, one seeking freedom, the other adventure. A brutal murder threw them together, changing their lives forever. In an incident that shocked the world, a teenage nun, Kelsang Namtso, was killed when Chinese border police opened fire on a group of pilgrims, as they fled Tibet over the famous Nangpa Pass, the gateway to Nepal and to freedom. The shooting was witnessed by international mountain climbers, some of whom photographed the events, helped rescue survivors and sent the story out to the world.”\n\nBuy or stream.\n\nA journalist is given 1 hour to ask the Dalai Lama ten questions. “Filmmaker Rick Ray examines some of the fundamental questions of our time by weaving together observations from his own journeys throughout India and the Middle East, and the wisdom of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

In Northern India near the Himalayas, a band of Buddhist monks from Tibet have set up a monastery in exile from their native land.
