        "text": "I’ve been teaching Humanities English 11 for the past seven years at Albert Lea High School. I couldn’t have asked for a better assignment.\n\nWe study literature, religious movements, philosophy, and popular music in the American tradition, all within their historical contexts. From ancient Native American myths and 18th century patriotic anthems, to modern novels and Bob Dylan’s protest songs, we cover a lot of ground and generally have a good time doing it.\n\nTo study humanities is to study what it means to be human. So on the first day of class, I typically ask students to work in small groups and generate a list of five to 10 “big questions” that thoughtful people should ask themselves at some point in their lives. Their lists often include the following:\n\n1. Do I really control my own destiny? (Fate versus free will.)\n\n2. What is my purpose in life?\n\n3. Does God exist?\n\n4. Is there an afterlife?\n\n5. Is there one true religion?\n\n6. What is justice?\n\n7. Can true freedom really exist?\n\n8. Is there one true moral code?\n\n9. What responsibility do I have to others?\n\n10. What motivates us most, or what should?\n\nDepending on the enthusiasm of each group, these lists can go on and on, and I typically wrap things up when questions start focusing too much on space aliens and fashion trends.\n\nI love this exercise because it allows students to collectively acknowledge that they are thoughtful people who don’t go through life with blinders on, that they are seekers who hunger for truth. Moreover, these questions will be addressed again and again in different ways by the writers and artists we will study throughout the year.\n\nI feel energized by the young scholars in my classes, mostly because they possess something many adults have over the years — “negative capability.” I’ve borrowed this term from the poet John Keats.\n\nNegative capability is basically the ability to embrace uncertainty and doubt. It’s a special type of humility, a willingness to keep our ears open and honestly consider other perspectives rather than simply insist that ours is the only acceptable one.\n\nMany mystics and great spiritual minds throughout history have displayed negative capability despite being incredibly committed to their own traditions. They recognize there are many paths to the same values and answers, that it’s a waste of time to argue about which path is best, provided neither harms the other.\n\nI benefited from an example of this type of negative capability as a first-year student at St. John’s University back in the early 1990s. St. John’s is a Benedictine Catholic university in central Minnesota, and the monks there had invited a group of Tibetan Buddhist monks to come and demonstrate their unique style of prayer and chanting.\n\nAt 18 I was initially shocked to see Catholic monks and Buddhist monks walking arm and arm together on campus.\n\n“Haven’t these guys devoted their lives to two completely different belief systems about where we came from and why we’re here?” I thought.\n\nDifferent, yes. But complementary and beautiful too. Their negative capability allowed them to see and appreciate what they had in common rather than feel intimidated and defensive about their differences.\n\nLater that day I was honored to have witnessed these Buddhist monks praying in The Great Hall at St. John’s, which had been the monastery’s original church. I witnessed a sacred practice from their tradition, performed inside a sacred space from my tradition.\n\nThe Dalai Lama (the leader of Tibetan Buddhism) perhaps embodies this type of openness and wisdom better than any other spiritual leader.\n\nSeveral years ago, broadcast journalist Charlie Rose interviewed him and mentioned that scientists were reportedly close to isolating what people of faith commonly refer to as “the soul” in a way that could prove the soul to be something physical, something that cannot exist past death. What would Buddhism do, Rose asked, faced with something so contrary to its core belief in an eternal soul and reincarnation?\n\nWithout much of a pause, His Holiness calmly smiled and said, “Buddhism would adapt.”\n\nHis humility and negative capability astounded me.\n\nPaths to Peace in Freeborn County is offering an opportunity to share in some of the Dalai Lama’s tradition and wisdom next Thursday, Oct. 1, when we offer a free showing of the award winning documentary “10 Questions for the Dalai Lama.”\n\nThe film follows American director Rick Ray, who is granted a private audience with His Holiness and allowed to ask 10 questions of his choice. The questions aren’t exactly the same as the ones my students generate, but a few are close. The film offers a wonderful glimpse into the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader as well as his own personal history and the history of Buddhism itself.\n\nThe film shows at 7 p.m. in the Lecture Hall at Riverland Community College’s Albert Lea campus. Admission is free.\n\nFor more information, visit the new Paths to Peace in Freeborn County Facebook page. You can see the page without a free Facebook account, but for easier access and notifications of upcoming events, you’ll need to join Facebook and become a fan.\n\nJeremy Corey-Gruenes is an English teacher at Albert Lea High School and a member of Paths to Peace in Freeborn County."
