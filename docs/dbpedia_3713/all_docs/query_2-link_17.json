        "meta_description": "How do you reconcile a commitment to non-violence when faced with violence? Why do the poor often seem happier than the rich? Must a society lose its traditions in order to move into the future? These are some of the questions posed to His Holiness the Dalai Lama by filmmaker and explorer Rick Ray. Ray examines some of the fundamental questions of our time by weaving together observations from his own journeys throughout India and the Middle East, and the wisdom of an extraordinary spiritual leader. This is his story, as told and filmed by Rick Ray during a private visit to his monastery in Dharamsala, India over the course of several months. Also included is rare historical footage as well as footage supplied by individuals who at great personal risk, filmed with hidden cameras within Tibet.",

        "text": "An interestingish documentary. Apparently when you are granted an audience with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, you are given the opportunity to ask him 10 questions. If he feels insincerity or arrogance from you, he will end it. I did not like the narrator/interviewer at all, found him very smug. I was kind of hoping His Holiness would be all like, “Nyeahhh, you’re a tool. Game over.” But then we wouldn’t have a documentary, would we? Some of the questions he poses are solid, some weak. But, whatever, they are his questions, I guess. The movie is saved somewhat by an abundance of incredible historical footage and information. So it doesn’t suck.\n\nAlso- it leaves you with an interesting premise to play around with all day long: what would your 10 questions be?"
