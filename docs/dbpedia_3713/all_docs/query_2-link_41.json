        "text": "My favorite Buddhist films:\n\nZen (2009)\n\nUn Buda (2005)\n\nWhy Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East? (1989)\n\n10 Questions for the Dalai Lama (2006)\n\nPeace is Every Step (1998)\n\nIf you want to find more one way is to click on the links above and look under \"People who liked this also liked...\"\n\nAlso there are these organizations:\n\nBuddhist Film Foundation\n\nThus Have I Seen\n\nThe Buddhist Film Foundation is working on an archive of Buddhist films but at the time of writing i couldn't find anything public\n\nHope this answer helps you and others\n\nBooks:\n\n-Hesse's Siddhartha is interesting, but it is not an account of the Buddha himself. It touches on elements of Buddha dharma, but can be somewhat confusing in its intermingling of dharma and Hindu Advaita\n\n-I highly recommend Deathbed Sutra of the Buddha, but then again, I am the author, so I have a bit of a bias!\n\nFilm:\n\n-Kundun, for Tibetan Buddhism\n\n-The Buddha (PBS production)...with some annoying cartoon segments\n\n-Little Buddha\n\n-The Tibetan Book of the Dead - the version narrated by Leonard Cohen. Available on Netflix, and quite good in the sense of a not being too \"Hollywoodish\"\n\n-The Fountain: philosophically, it's a bit of a mess, but it's an entetaining story that explores key Buddhist themes such as impermanence, self, and suffering. Great acting (Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz), directiong by Aronofsky, very \"trippy\" special effects,\n\nThe french born Wanderer and former Bhikkhu Isidhamma has specialed himself in producing dhammic stories in Burma which he/their give as present of Dhamma. Some are in burmese, french and english, or with subtitles.\n\nYou may contact him and get known his work on dhammadana.org\n\nSome of them are:\n\nThe Great Legacy\n\nAye Mi is an ambitious photographer eager to start a career in advertising but doesn't have enough money to buy a camera. Her only hope is to recover a lost inheritance, a valuable ruby.\n\nAye Mi discovers that the jewel has been taken by some young evil witches who have menacing and corrupting powers. Facing her worst fears, she makes big sacrifices and will not stop for anything until she retrieves the stone.\n\nWill Aye Mi ever doubt the value of what is unexpectedly discovered along the way?\n\nDeliverance 2007\n\nThe box of desires\n\nDhamma Pictures has the pleasure to presents to you the uploading of our latest movie : \"The box of desires\". Quality Full HD. Don't forget to activate the English subtitles (\"CC\" button right & above the screen under Youtube). \"The box of desires\" is a love story beetwen two Myanmar teenagers who try to meditate in order to get a pure heart.\n\nThe taste of the Dhamma\n\nIt's good enough to experience this taste only once…\n\nIt's enough to know its flavour one single time…\n\nYati, 14 year old, is accused to be a witch because she knows many things that's usually impossible to know. Otherwise, she prodided powerful potions which have unwishable effects. Phu Phu, who accuses Ko Saing to make her drink a potion, had herself strange behaviors before to get the potion. In order to clarify this affair full of intrigues, the teacher organise a judgment with the three teenagers. Therefore, the most important will be to know how to find an antidote, the only one which is efficient…\n\nThis movie is offered to all. We − which include PDO's school's children of Mandalay − would appreciate that it been LIKED and SHARED. One clic is so easy. ; )\n\nOne may find a small collection of other movies and documentaries (not all really Dhamma Dana) here: \"Buddhist\" Documentary films - \"Buddhistische\" Dokumentarfilme\n\nNot many are watched, so there no quality garanty can be given at large.\n\n[Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.]"
