        "text": "Photo: imagem-tv2\n\nOver the past month or two I’ve slowly found myself in an intense, committed relationship with Netflix. It was years in the making, but moving to the East Coast of the US where our winters are cold (what?!) and dark really took things to the next level. I know I have a problem, but I can’t stop. Sound familiar?\n\nIf you’re the kind of person who actually likes to leave your home and engage in social, human activities, then this article is not for you. But, if you love nothing more than curling up for an epic Netflix binge with your snacks and comfy socks, read on.\n\nBecause I have no intention of abandoning my relationship, at least not in the near future, I have developed a plan. In addition to watching Sons of Anarchy back to back, I’m challenging myself to throw some movies into the mix. Specifically, documentaries and films that seek to educate and inspire.\n\nThis is my personal list that I plan to work through in the coming months. While I’ve seen a few, many of these have been recommended to me and others just peaked my interest. If you have additional recommendations, let us know in the comments. Happy Netflixing!\n\n1. Girl Rising\n\n“Nine filmmakers each profile a young girl from a different part of the world to weave a global tapestry of youth in the 21st century. From a 7-year-old Haitian earthquake survivor to an Afghani child bride, these stories inspire and captivate.”\n\nI had the good fortune of seeing this film a couple of years ago with friends. You won’t want to miss this.\n\n2. Hotel Rwanda\n\n“Amid the holocaust of internecine tribal fighting in Rwanda that sees the savage butchering of hundreds of thousands of men, women and children, one ordinary hotel manager musters the courage to save more than 1,000 helpless refugees.”\n\nI’ve already seen this several times, and highly recommend it. Don Cheadle gives the performance of a life time.\n\n3. The One Percent\n\n“In this eye-opening documentary, filmmaker Jamie Johnson examines the gap that exists between America's poor and the 1 percent of the population that controls half the country's wealth. Johnson, himself an heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, interviews Milton Friedman, Bill Gates Sr., Steve Forbes, and other wealthy men, revealing the enormous social and political effect financial disparity has on America's current state.”\n\nThis is what we’re talking about when we say it’s the systems in place that keep people poor.\n\n4. It’s a Girl\n\n“This grave documentary spotlights the cultural traditions that surround widespread female \"gendercide\" and violence toward women in India and China.”\n\nWe know that achieving gender equality is vital to eliminating extreme poverty. I hope this documentary can shed some light on some of the challenges to making that happen.\n\n5. 10 Questions for the Dalai Lama\n\n“This fascinating documentary blends an interview with the Dalai Lama with a look back at the spiritual leader's history and an exploration of the small city of Dharamsala, India, where he was exiled some 50 years ago.”\n\nBecause who doesn’t love the Dalai Lama? Such an inspirational individual.\n\n6. Bottled Life\n\n“Journalist Res Gehriger investigates how Swiss-based corporation Nestlé has plundered the world's water resources in the name of big business.”\n\nThis sounds pretty scandalous to me, I’m nervous for what I’m going to find out.\n\n7. City of God\n\n“Growing up in a Rio de Janeiro favela, Rocket is able to avoid being drawn into a life of drugs and crime by having a passion for photography. Through his eyes, the dramatic stories of several of the slum's colorful residents unfold.”\n\nI saw this a little bit ago. Very good, but very violent.\n\n8. Rising from Ashes\n\n“This film follows Rwanda's first national cycling team as they struggle to move past their country's horrific genocide and make it to the 2012 Olympics. Coached by cycling legend Jock Boyer, the eclectic group fights against huge obstacles.”\n\nI have a feeling this one will be a real tear jerker.\n\n9. Honor Diaries\n\n“Explore the lives of nine inspiring women's rights advocates in Muslim-majority societies fighting against oppression, forced marriage and more.”\n\nI’m all about girl power, especially in places where women aren’t treated as equals.\n\n10. Farmageddon\n\n“Americans' right to access fresh, healthy foods of their choice is under attack. This documentary tells the story of farms that were providing safe, nutritional foods to their communities but were forced to stop, sometimes through violent action.”\n\nThis sounds a little alarmist, but I do know there is some truth to this.\n\n11. They Call It Myanmar: Lifting the Curtain\n\n“This documentary exposes everyday life in Burma, an isolated country that has been held in the iron grip of a brutal military regime for 48 years.”\n\nEducating ourselves on the issues affecting people around world is an important aspect of being a Global Citizen.\n\n12. Which Way Home\n\n“Fulbright Scholar Rebecca Cammisa and her crew follow a trio of children who set out on their own from their homes in Latin America on a dangerous trek through Mexico en route to the U.S. border, hoping to reunite with their parents.”\n\nThere are so many reasons people decide to migrate, and it’s never a decision made lightly.\n\n13. Haiti Untold\n\n“Chronicling the journey of those who put their heads and hearts to work effecting radical change in Haiti following the devastating 2010 earthquake.”\n\nI’m happy people like this are getting the recognition they deserve.\n\n14. Half the Sky\n\n“Filmed in 10 countries, this series introduces women who are struggling with some of the most difficult and oppressive circumstances imaginable -- including sex slavery and the systematic murder of women -- and are bravely fighting to change them.”\n\nI’ve heard some amazing things. And if you enjoy watching a series, this one is for you.\n\n15. Dark Girls\n\n“This fascinating and controversial film goes underneath the surface to explore the prejudices dark-skinned women face throughout the world. It explores the roots of classism, racism and the lack of self-esteem within a segment of cultures.”\n\nWith people up in arms over the mistreatment of young, black men by the American police, addressing race couldn’t be more relevant. #Blacklivesmatter\n\n16. A Whisper to a Roar\n\n“This rousing documentary examines how protesters dedicated to democracy and nonviolence have changed the political landscapes in five tumultuous countries -- Venezuela, Egypt, Malaysia, Ukraine and Zimbabwe -- that have been ruled by corrupt regimes.”\n\nEqually relevant to the current climate in the US.\n\n17. Best of TEDx\n\n“Featuring local voices that reverberate globally, these talks celebrate the best of TEDx and its mantra of \"ideas worth spreading.\"\n\nHad to finish this list off with something uplifting! I always find inspiration when I watch TED talks, even when I don’t suspect the subject relates to me in any way.\n\nSo heat up some popcorn, pick up some froyo, and assemble your pillows. We’ve got work to do!\n\n----"
