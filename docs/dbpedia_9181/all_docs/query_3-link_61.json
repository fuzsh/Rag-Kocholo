        "text": "As for the current Polish zloty coins, they offer a unique look in terms of their design, with the obverse displaying the State title and the eagle of the coat of arms. The reverse side is where you’ll find some interesting differences based on denomination. For example, on the 1 grosz coin, there’s a value alongside one leaf, whilst for both the 2 grosze and 5 groszy coins, there are two or five leaves, respectively. On the 10 groszy coin, however, you can expect to find ten encircling leaves. Even larger denominations like 20 groszy feature twenty square-shaped leaves, whilst 50 groszy come with a semicircular line of fifty leaves. Finally, higher denominations such as 1 zloty have a full circle of one hundred leaves within the ring portion, with 2 zloty featuring just two leaves and 5 zloty coming with five.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, gold coins, especially those of German and Ruthenian duchies, were used as currency in Poland, known as zloty. In 1496, a national currency equivalent to 30 groschens from Prague was established, with the name Polski Złoty (which means Golden Polish).\n\nUnder the reign of Stanisław August Poniatowski in the second half of the eighteenth century, this currency was adopted as the official one. During 1850-1917 it was replaced by the Russian rouble and from 1917 to 1924 by the Polish mark. After experiencing hyperinflation and monetary chaos happened following the first World War in the early twentieth century, zloty was reintroduced in 1924 and has been actively used ever since.\n\nIn 1945, the National Bank of Poland was established together with a new printing facility in Łódź. The series II and III banknotes were designed by Wacław Borowski and Ryszard Kleczewski. Two years later, legislation was signed introducing a new złoty with a revised coinage system, with all notes issued up to 1948 becoming obsolete and being replaced at the rate of 100 to 1.\n\nIn 1989, after the fall of communism, Poland was forced to reevaluate their currency as it was greatly affected by hyperinflation. The National Bank of Poland (NBP) developed a project in 1994 to successfully redenominate the złoty and make it the new stable standard on the 1st of January 1995. The new zloty coins and banknotes with revised designs were printed by two well-known printing companies, PWPW located in Warsaw and De La Rue in London. These notes featured Polish monarchs, a move that highlighted national recognition.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, the polski złoty was updated with additional security features, such as a white-coloured field with a watermark on the obverse and randomly arranged dotting that form part of the EURion constellation. Furthermore, in 2017, a 500zł banknote featuring John III Sobieski was brought into circulation. Further developments are due to take place this year when the National Bank of Poland is set to introduce a 1000zł note. The currency’s design is not greatly dissimilar from the original series, but the updated features make each banknote significantly more secure.\n\nWhether it’s your first time or you are a regular visitor, here are some helpful tips on how to show appreciation for good service.\n\nCafés: Tipping at cafes is not required, but not uncommon either. If you like your coffee and service, consider rounding up to the nearest PLN, typically 3-5PLN. This small gesture shows that you appreciate their work and efforts.\n\nRestaurants: Tipping at restaurants is a personal preference and is not expected by servers in Poland. However, if the service was particularly good or if they were very helpful during your visit, 10 to 15%of the total bill is greatly appreciated. Alternatively, saying “dziękuję” (thank you) when paying will have the server keep any change as a tip.\n\nBartenders: There’s no obligation to tip bartenders at bars in Poland but saying “dziękuję” (thank you) when paying can have them keep any change as a small tip for their service.\n\nTour Guides: When taking a tour, it’s customary to leave a 10-15% tip at the end of your journey as a sign of appreciation for your guide and driver. This should reflect the level of service you received during your tour; if you were particularly impressed with their efforts, feel free to increase the amount.\n\nTaxis: A safe and speedy ride deserves an appropriate reward – 10% is usually enough to show your gratitude and encourage them to continue providing quality service. If they provided anything less than impressive service, there’s no obligation to tip at all.\n\nHousecleaning: To express your gratitude, consider leaving zł10 (AUD $3.36) per night after housekeeping has finished tidying up your room. This is completely optional but will certainly put a smile on their face.\n\nStylists: Not sure how much to tip? It’s simple – just follow your gut feeling. Consider factors such as how long it took, whether or not you liked the end result, and if you felt comfortable throughout the session when deciding how much money you want to leave behind.\n\nSpas: If you found yourself exceptionally pleased with your spa experience, then don’t hesitate to give a generous tip (zł10 should do) before checking out. The receptionist may even provide you with an envelope if asked!\n\nBudget\n\nWhen travelling to Poland on a budget, you should limit yourself to zł180 (AUD $60) per day. This can cover a hostel dorm, groceries for self-prepared meals, and normal usage of public transport. To save money, take free walking tours or visit the many free museums across the country. If you plan on drinking alcohol during your trip to Poland, keep in mind that an additional 10-20 PLN should be added daily to your budget.\n\nModerate\n\nFor a more comfortable budget, a mid-range budget of approximately zł320-400 (AUD $107-134) per day can provide an enjoyable experience. You can cover better accommodations such as Airbnb or private hostels. Eating out at the affordable milk bars is also an option for most meals, with the possibility to have some drinks and take taxis here and there when needed. Furthermore, paid activities like visiting the Uprising Museum or taking a tour of Auschwitz are sure to enhance your stay by providing interesting cultural experiences.\n\nLuxury\n\nExploring Poland on a luxury budget will surely be the trip of a lifetime! With zł750 (AUD $251) or more to spend each day, you can stay in quality hotels, eat sumptuous meals and tantalise your taste buds with delicious beverages. What’s more, you can rent a car to get around and take any guided tours or activities that are must-sees while in the country. There is no limit to how luxurious your trip can be – treat yourself and experience Poland like royalty!"
