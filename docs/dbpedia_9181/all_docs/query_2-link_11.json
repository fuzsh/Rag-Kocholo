        "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe European Union has given Croatia the green light to begin using the euro- and join the Schengen zone- from next year.\n\nThe country will join 19 other EU member states that use the currency.\n\nIt will adopt the currency from 1 January 2023, making Croatia the latest nation to join the eurozone since Lithuania in 2015.\n\nFrom next year, it will mean that just seven EU countries still use their own currency.\n\nWhy is Croatia adopting the euro?\n\nCroatia will continue to use its own currency, the kuna, until January next year. Currently, one Croatian kuna is worth around €0.13.\n\nIn order to adopt the euro, a country has to fulfil a set of economic conditions including having a stable exchange rate and low inflation.\n\nBy adopting the euro, the eastern European nation hopes to gain more financial security and improve the living standards of its citizens.\n\nCroatia will also benefit economically from closer financial links with the single currency area’s other members and the European Central Bank.\n\nFor visitors to Croatia from the eurozone, this will also mean no need to exchange money.\n\nWhich European countries still use their own currency?\n\nAs Croatia becomes the 20th EU nation to adopt the euro, there are still a number of members that haven’t taken this step.\n\nIn total, seven EU countries don’t use the euro: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden.\n\nIn these countries, visitors from the eurozone still need to exchange money before they travel. Here’s a list of the currencies they use and some more information about these non-eurozone EU member states.\n\nTake in Denmark’s haute cuisine and hygge\n\nDenmark is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries but it is big on gourmet food, culture and design.\n\nAs the land of hygge, Denmark is the perfect place for a holiday focused on wellness. Travelling its vast coastline is a great way to unwind and recharge.\n\nVisitors to Denmark will need to exchange their money for the Danish krone.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nExperience the midnight sun and northern lights in Sweden\n\nSweden is a great destination for nature lovers with nearly 100,000 breathtaking lakes, rugged mountain ranges and swathes of forest.\n\nIt’s the perfect country to watch one of nature’s greatest spectacles, the northern lights, or stay up all night under the midnight sun.\n\nSweden uses the Swedish krona following a 2003 referendum where the public voted not to adopt the euro.\n\nBook budget beach holidays in Bulgaria\n\nBulgaria is gaining fame as an attractive budget holiday destination offering both stunning beaches and spectacular mountain ranges with glacial lakes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe country is also full of fascinating historical monuments from monasteries to fortresses.\n\nBulgaria currently uses the lev although it intends to switch to the euro when it fulfils the required conditions.\n\nVisit a pristine river delta in Romania\n\nRomania combines some of the most impressive natural landscapes in Europe with quaint medieval villages and dramatic castles.\n\nThe Danube Delta is one of the best preserved on the continent and a paradise for birdwatchers while the spectacular Scărișoara Glacier is Europe’s second biggest underground glacier.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRomania uses the leu and, like Bulgaria, hopes to adopt the euro in the future.\n\nDelve into Europe’s history in Poland\n\nPoland is the perfect destination for history buffs with plenty of medieval castles.\n\nYou can also reflect on Europe’s World War II history at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, Warsaw Uprising Museum and the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews.\n\nVisitors to the capital will also be impressed by the stylish bars and new vegan restaurants that have popping up in recent years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPoland uses the zloty as its local currency.\n\nTaste the local cuisine in Hungary\n\nHungary has a rich and hearty local cuisine with mouthwatering dishes like Goulash - a paprika-seasoned meat stew - and lángos, a deep fried flat bread.\n\nThe country is also renowned for its thermal baths of architectural splendour. Lake Héviz, the world’s largest thermal lake accessible to bathers, is also worth a visit.\n\nVisitors to Hungary will need to exchange their money for the forint.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCzech Republic is the county of castles\n\nWith the highest density of castles in Europe, Czech Republic is a paradise for architecture and history lovers. Some of these ostentatious buildings date back to the 1300s and the capital city Prague is home to the world’s largest castle complex.\n\nVisiting historic buildings is thirsty work, but luckily the country is also famed for its tradition of beer brewing that began as early as 993 AD.\n\nCzech Republic’s local currency is the koruna."
