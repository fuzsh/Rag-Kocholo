With that in mind, it is encouraged for customers to call ahead to place an order. This will allow our branch to make sure we have enough currency in stock for you and the next customer that may want the same currency. If it is not in stock, we will take your information and call you as soon as it comes into the branch. No down payment or deposit is required unless you are ordering a large amount of a minor currency, in which case a deposit may be required to hold the currency.

No prepayment is needed for most foreign currency orders. This beats the old way of always having to run around trying to make sure you have the foreign currency you need before that next international trip or feeling empty-handed when you had to get it exchanged last minute abroad.\n\nTake control of how much you spend by saying yes to reserving your currency online. With this step-by-step guide you’ll be stress-free and confident you’re getting the best exchange rate.\n\nStep 1:\n\nGo to our branch locations page at www.ceifx.com/locations or simply visit https://order.ceifx.com.\n\nStep 2:\n\nOnce you find the CXI-owned branch location closest to you (not affiliate companies), click on reserve currency online.\n\nStep 3:\n\nEnter your country of destination or currency name you need to reserve. You can also select one of the most exchanged major currencies listed under the selection box.\n\nStep 4:\n\nEnter how much currency you want to reserve and submit with your contact information. An indication rate will be used for your reference.\n\nAfter you've submitted your order:\n\nOur representative will contact you shortly to confirm when the reserved currency order will be available\n\nOnly pay for your order when you pick it up using the rate of that day\n\nThat’s it! No more going back and forth to your bank branch or working within banking hours. Stop in one time and you’re ready for your trip. Try online currency reservation now.\n\nMake sure to arrive with cash in hand. At your destination, you have no easy way to know what your exchange rate or fees will be. Instead of enjoying your travel, you will need to search and shop around for the best rates. Most importantly, CXI is federally regulated by the Department of Treasury and provides a safe, secure way to exchange currency. Travelers love us - we're highly rated on Trustpilot. As for banks, CXI has a Best Rate Guarantee that its CXI City Center (company-owned) branches will match or beat the exchange rate given by a local bank for the same foreign currency (cash) and service on the same day. Not only do we guarantee this, but we also keep most major currencies in stock daily and allow you to place orders over the phone, where most bank branches will require you to be an account holder, come into their branch (during banking hours) to request currency, and then return another day to pick up the currency. Most of CXI's locations are open seven days a week and have much longer business hours to help you on your schedule.\n\nMost Banks\n\nSpecialize in services other than foreign currency exchange. Their expertise lies in traditional banking services and not in foreign exchange, and as a result, foreign exchange knowledge and services may be limited.\n\nCan charge higher exchange rates and fees.\n\nMake customers wait for currency when ordering and visit twice—once to order and once to pick up the order.\n\nOnly deal with account holders and can have minimum or maximum order amounts.\n\nAre closed on holidays and only operate during bank hours.\n\nCXI City Center (company-owned) Branches\n\nSpecialize in foreign exchange—it is all we do, offering rare and exotic currencies in addition to more commonly used currencies.\n\nGive great rates and a low fee, leveraging our access to foreign currency as a wholesaler and retailer.\n\nOffer a Best Rate Guarantee that we will beat any bank or airport exchange rate on the same day for the same amount of currency.\n\nHold most major currencies in stock daily for immediate availability, while providing a wide variety of foreign currencies with only a minimal waiting period.\n\nBuy foreign currency from customers and issue immediate payment.\n\nExchange select foreign coins (CAD, EUR, GBP, and MXN).\n\nGive customers a range of options, including traditional foreign banknote exchange, and cashing American Express traveler's checks at select locations.\n\nAll CXI branches are safely and conveniently located in major areas, many in shopping centers or malls offering extended operating and holiday hours.\n\nThis guarantee means CXI City Center (company-owned) locations will match or beat the exchange rate given by any local bank or airport for the same foreign currency (cash) and service on the same day and time of the exchange. If you find a better rate within the same city and on the same day as the CXI branch you plan to exchange with, notify the CXI branch. Our branch will confirm that the rate you present is for the same amount and currency as you plan to exchange with CXI. Once confirmed with the bank or airport, CXI will match or beat the given rate. This is only valid prior to an exchange and is not valid after an exchange has already been completed.\n\nPlease note that the policies of agent locations including CXI Airports and affiliate-owned locations listed on our website may vary. The Best Rate Guarantee is only available at CXI City Center (company-owned) locations.\n\nCXI can buy and sell select foreign coins at any of its owned locations. We currently exchange the most popular foreign coin denominations: £1 British pound, £2 British pounds, $1 Canadian loonie, $2 Canadian loonie, €1 European euro, €2 European euros, $10 Mexican pesos, and $20 Mexican pesos. To help reduce lines and wait times for all customers, all foreign coins must be sorted prior to coming to the branch to exchange them.\n\nFor all other foreign coins, you can donate them to the UNICEF Change For Good program. It's also a good idea to use foreign coins to pay for any of your last meals or snacks because it will be extremely difficult to get rid of the coins at a good value otherwise.\n\nVisit our news page for more information on how to exchange select foreign coins.\n\nCurrency Price Protection (CPP) allows you, for a low fee of $5.95, to take advantage of a Special Buy Back rate that protects your currencies when you purchase banknotes from CXI. This price protection allows you to sell any eligible leftover currency back at a Special Buy Back rate plus you receive no exchange fee, saving you the most money compared to the Standard Buy Back rate. CPP is available for nearly all currencies. There is no required minimum or maximum required to be ordered, however, only the currencies and amounts in your original CPP order will be eligible for the improved Special Buy Back rate.\n\nFor more information, visit Currency Price Protection.\n\nThis is one of the most common foreign currency exchange questions out there and it is easy to understand why. The rates posted online and in newspapers is what is called the interbank rate.\n\nThe currency market is a decentralized market where there isn't one exchange where every foreign currency exchange trade is recorded. Instead, each market maker records its own transactions and keeps it as proprietary information. The primary market makers who make bid-and-ask spreads in the currency market are the largest banks in the world. They deal with each other constantly, which is why the market on which banks conduct transactions is called the interbank market. This market contains deals done in the millions and billions of dollars and is not done in a public forum for others to participate in.\n\nThis means there is no central entity that governs currency exchange rates. The interbank market is a credit-approved system where banks trade based on the credit relationship they share with each other. The larger the forex retail, the more favorable pricing it can get from the interbank market.\n\nCXI is unique in that it is a net buyer of foreign currency. The company-owned branches provide an influx of foreign currency that it can, in turn, make available for sale through its wholesale network relationships. This synergy effectively allows CXI to minimize the currency costs of buying and selling on the interbank market, affording CXI the ability to offer its customers and clients extremely competitive rates while providing its Best Rate Guarantee*."
