The lettering is in Latin and reads as follows:\n\nObverse: MONETA:SIGISMVNDI:1514 (Coinage of Sigismund)\n\nReverse: MAGNI:DVCIS:LITVANIE (Grand Duchy of Lithuania)\n\nSigismund I the Old, a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty, ruled as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1506 until his passing in 1548. His reign began at the age of 39 when he succeeded his brother, Alexander, to both titles. Sigismund was a capable monarch known for his patronage of the arts and his contributions to Polish culture and diplomacy. He expanded Polish rule to include Ducal Prussia and the Duchy of Mazovia, ensuring political dependence from his nephew Albert, Duke of Prussia. Sigismund also achieved notable military victories against Moldavia and Muscovy, strengthening Poland's eastern borders. His reign witnessed the flourishing of the Polish Renaissance, marked by Italian influences in architecture, cuisine, and customs, largely promoted by his second wife, Bona Sforza. Sigismund I was commemorated on contemporary currency, and his only son, Sigismund Augustus, succeeded him as the last Jagiellon king upon his death in 1548."
