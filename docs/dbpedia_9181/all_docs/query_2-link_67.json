        "text": "Charging options\n\nThe charging options available to you will depend on the destination country of your payment:\n\nEEA payments are payments to a country in the European Economic Area*, made in any currency using SWIFT or non-urgent payments in euros using the SEPA scheme.\n\nNow that the UK has left the European Economic Area (EEA), European banks are allowed to take bank fees out of payments you make to accounts in the EEA.\n\nSo, while we, Santander UK plc, aren't changing our charges when you send or receive payments to or from the EEA, you may find that European banks now apply charges.\n\nFor payments in EUR - Payments you send using SWIFT to an EEA beneficiary may arrive with deductions having been taken along the way, either by the beneficiary’s bank or by a correspondent bank. However deductions cannot be taken from SEPA payments. You may therefore prefer to send and request payments this way.\n\nIt’s also possible that payments you receive from an EEA bank, both in foreign currency (other than SEPA payments) and in GBP, may have deductions taken before the payment reaches Santander in the UK.\n\nFor other EEA currencies we offer including Czech koruna, Danish krone, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, Polish zloty, Hungarian forint and Romanian leu, SWIFT is the only payment method available and these payments may be subject to deductions. Payments in Pound sterling (GBP) to/from EEA countries may also be affected.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the charges which could be applied within the EEA, the owner of the account held in the EEA should check with their bank as we can’t see what charges other banks will apply and are unable to advise on this.\n\nInternational payments - these are payments anywhere in the world outside of the European Economic Area*, made in sterling or any other currency, using SWIFT. For these payments:\n\nthe beneficiary can pay all the charges or\n\nyou can pay the beneficiary’s charges in addition to your own (sender’s) charges. This option will make it more likely (although not guaranteed) that the beneficiary will receive the full amount that you send.\n\nIf you want to change the charging option from the default setting (which is that you pay the sender’s charges only), this can be found in the section ‘Expenses paid by’ in Online Banking - alternatively the telephone operator or branch staff can select the correct option for you.\n\n* European Economic Area Countries;\n\nAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.\n\nYou can ask us for a cheque in a different currency. When you do this, we’ll take the money out of your account straight away. And we’ll issue you with a type of paper cheque called a draft. So when the person getting the cheque pays it into their account, we’ll already have the money to pay it.​\n\nWhen you ask for a foreign-currency draft we charge you £10. You can ask in a branch, or call us on 0330 9 123 123.​\n\nWe can provide currency drafts to be drawn in:​\n\nEuros​\n\nUS dollars​\n\nCanadian dollars​\n\nSwiss francs.​\n\nYou can ask us to cancel a cheque or draft once it’s been issued. If we do this, we'll charge you £25. If the person you’re paying hasn’t paid in the cheque after 6 months, we may cancel it.​\n\nOnce a cheque is cancelled, it takes at least 5 working days for us to credit the funds back to your account. Changes in exchange rates may mean you may get back less than you originally paid.​\n\nMore options​\n\nPaying by cheque can mean costs and timings you don’t want. So you may like to pay a different way. An international transfer or CHAPS payment are 2 of your options.​\n\nFor more on how to make international payments, look at the top of this page.\n\nIf a cheque’s in a foreign currency you may be able pay it into your account with us. But this can mean costs and timings you don’t want. So you may like to ask the person giving you money to get it to you a different way. This could be something like an international transfer. For more on this, go to ‘How to receive an international payment’ at the top of this page.​\n\nHere's how to pay a foreign-currency cheque or draft into your account with us:​\n\nOn the back of the cheque, sign your name and write the sort code and account number you want it paid into. ​\n\nOnce you're happy, send it to: Santander UK, Payments Team, PO BOX 13220, Foreign Cheques, Harlow, Essex, CM20 9UF.​\n\nBe sure to keep a copy of the cheque or draft in case you need it later. Please also note, it’s not down to us if cheques go missing in the post. Think about using recorded delivery for your cheque or keeping proof of postage.​\n\nOnce we have your foreign-currency cheque or draft, we'll try to clear it either by: ​\n\nCollection – You’ll only get the money in your account once the bank paying it has the cheque or draft and sent us the money. It’s down to the cheque, banks and countries involved, but this usually takes 2-8 weeks. ​\n\nNegotiation – You’ll usually get the money in your account around 6 working days after we have the cheque.​\n\nEither way, your cheque may take longer if we need to do security checks.​\n\nWhich way will my cheque go through?​\n\nWe can’t always say how your cheque will go through.​\n\nIf it’s for less than £5,000 your cheque may go through by negotiation or collection.​\n\nIf it’s for more than £5,000, or in a different currency to the country it was issued in, or from a country that only accepts collection, your cheque will go through collection. For example, a USD $20,000 cheque from a US bank, or a USD $1,000 cheque from a Canadian Bank, would each go through collection.​\n\nFor an update, call us on 0330 9 123 123 or go to a branch.​\n\nEither way, it may take longer for your cheque to go through if we need to do security checks. We'll convert the money from your cheque into pounds. We'll use our standard exchange rate on the date the money's paid into your account. ​\n\nHow much will it cost me to pay in my foreign-currency cheque or draft?​\n\nWe charge you £10 to pay in a foreign-currency cheque. If it goes through by collection, the other banks we work with may also charge us ‘correspondent charges’ for processing it. We’ll take these off the final amount that goes into your account.​\n\nWe can’t tell you what these charges will be because we don’t set them and won’t know what they are until we're asked to pay them for you. They can be high, and sometimes be a percentage of the cheque's value.​\n\nStuff you need to know​\n\nIt could be we get a foreign-currency cheque that we can’t put through. If this happens, we'll return it to you as soon as possible, telling you what the problem is. It could be that the correspondent charges are higher than your cheque’s value.​\n\nUp to 7 years after you’ve put in a foreign-currency cheque, we can return it to you. In this case, or if we see it’s fraud, we may take back the money we paid into your account. If exchange rates have changed, the amount we take from your account could differ from what went in. ​\n\nYou might ask the person who wants to pay you by cheque, to do so another way. An international transfer is quicker and cheaper. And there’s less chance it’ll be returned once it’s gone through.​\n\nBe wary of fraud​\n\nSometimes fraudsters send our customers foreign-currency cheques, and ask that they transfer the money back to them. With this scam, once the fraudster gets the transfer, their cheque bounces. Leaving our customer out of pocket.​\n\nOur Security Team is ready, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to help protect you instantly. Please tell us if:​\n\nyou get a cheque for more than the value of any goods or services you’re selling​\n\nthe buyer asks you to return or forward any overpayment once the cheque’s cleared​\n\nthe cheque clears, but the buyer then asks for the money to be returned​\n\nan online contact asks you to cash a foreign-currency cheque and forward them the money."
