        "text": "If you’re looking for a combination of old world charm and natural beauty, Lithuania is definitely worth a visit.\n\nFrom the enchanting cobbled streets and quaint courtyards of the capital, Vilnius, to lush green forests and the white sands of the beautiful Baltic coastline, this Eastern European gem is a delight to discover.\n\nBut what’s the best way to pay your way in Lithuania? And how do you get enough money to fund your trip?\n\nRead on to find out everything you need to know about using your money in Lithuania.\n\nCurrency in Lithuania\n\nAs from the 1 January 2015, the official currency of Lithuania is the Euro (€). The Euro is a floating currency; and its value fluctuates on a daily basis. One Euro is made up of 100 cents.\n\nBefore it switched to the Euro, Lithuania’s official currency was the Litas. This has now ceased to be legal tender though, which means it’s no longer accepted anywhere in the country. However, it’s still possible to exchange Litas for Euro at a fixed rate. One Lita is equivalent to €0.29.\n\nEuro coins are available in denominations of 1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, €1 and €2. Banknotes are available in denominations of €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500. The most frequently used banknotes are €5, €10 and €20. The highest two denominations (€200 and €500) are rarely used; and some shops won’t accept them.\n\nExchanging currency in Lithuania\n\nThe Euro is the second largest reserve currency in the world and the second most traded currency after the US Dollar. This means getting your hands on Euros ahead of time shouldn’t be a problem. That said, it’s worth waiting until you land in Lithuania to exchange your money, as you can usually get a much better exchange rate than you’ll be offered at home.\n\nUS Dollars and British Pounds are very easy to exchange, provided your bills are unmarked and undamaged. You’ll also need to present your passport or other proof of ID. Currencies from neighbouring countries such as Poland and Russia are also quite easy to exchange.\n\nTry to avoid changing your money at the airport or at a hotel. The exchange rates on offer here are normally bad, and you’ll also be charged a fee on top. Banks and exchange bureaus in the city offer far better rates. ATMs offer the best exchange rate possible - the mid-market rate.\n\nIf you choose to buy Euro from a bank or foreign exchange bureau, always compare the rates you’re offered to the mid-market rate. There’s no such thing as a fee-free foreign exchange transaction. While you may not be charged an outright fee or commission, chances are the profit will be built into the exchange rate you’re offered.\n\nYou can check the current mid-market rate by using our handy currency converter.\n\nEurozone Citizens\n\nOf course, if you’re visiting Lithuania from another Eurozone country, you won’t need to exchange currency at all. In fact, you don’t even need to bring cash with you.\n\nATM withdrawals, credit card transactions and debit card transactions from a Eurozone account are considered domestic, so they don’t attract any foreign exchange fees or international transaction fees. Instead, you’ll pay exactly what you’d have paid at home.\n\nIf your home bank charges an ATM fee for out-of-network withdrawals, you’ll pay the exact same fee when you use an ATM in Lithuania. You won’t pay any fees if your bank does not charge out-of-network fees. The same withdrawal limits you have back home will also apply in Lithuania.\n\nThe same goes for credit and debit card payments. Whether your transaction attracts a fee will depend on the situation back home. It’s worth checking your bank’s fee schedule so that you’ll know what to expect.\n\nUsing travellers’ cheques in Lithuania\n\nAvoid taking travellers’ cheques with you to Lithuania. Very few banks will change them and they’re practically unheard of anywhere else. Besides, travellers’ cheques rarely offer attractive exchange rates. It’s much simpler and cheaper to exchange cash or make an ATM withdrawal.\n\nUsing credit and debit cards in Lithuania\n\nVisa and MasterCard are widely accepted in Vilnius. They’re less popular in the smaller towns and villages, where cash payment is preferred. The traditional markets in Vilnius also expect cash payments.\n\nAmEx isn’t used as much as Visa and MasterCard in Lithuania (or in most of continental Europe for that matter). Always have some cash in your pocket as back up.\n\nWhen you pay by card, never agree to perform the transaction in your home currency. If you do, you’ll be given with an unfavourable exchange rate made up using Dynamic Currency Conversion. In Lithuania, always pay in Euros, so the conversion will be made using the mid-market rate.\n\nAnd don’t forget to advise your bank where you’re travelling to. If you don’t warn them about being away, they’ll consider any activity in a foreign country suspicious and block your card.\n\nATMs in Lithuania\n\nATMs offer the best euro exchange rates, because the transaction is worked out at the mid-market rate.\n\nThere’s a good network of 24-hour ATMs throughout Lithuania, even in some of the smaller towns. Most of them have an English language option; and they accept Visa (Plus), Cirrus and Maestro (both operated by MasterCard). Unfortunately, only Citadele ATMs accept AmEx.\n\nYou can find the nearest ATM using the following online locators:\n\nVisa ATM locator\n\nMasterCard ATM locator\n\nAmEx ATM locator\n\nCitadele ATM locator\n\nATMs tend to issue higher denominations, so if you want smaller notes, punch in a specific amount such as €80, rather than €100.\n\nMost ATMs do not charge a fee. Those that do will clearly display the amount and give you the opportunity to cancel the transaction before you’re charged. Your bank back home may levy charges. Usually, these include a foreign currency exchange fee and an international transaction fee.\n\nAs mentioned above, be sure to perform the transaction in the local currency. Never choose to be charged in your home currency, or you’ll be given an unfavourable exchange rate and unnecessary extra fees.\n\nBanks in Lithuania\n\nThere are various banks in Lithuania, but the major ones are predominantly foreign. Lietuvos is the premier Lithuanian bank, and Šialių is also popular. However, the largest network of ATMs in the country belongs to two Swedish-owned banks: Swedbank and SEB.\n\nHere’s a list of the most popular domestic retail banks in Lithuania:\n\nBankWebsite Citadelehttps://www.citadele.lt/ Lietuvos Bankashttps://www.lb.lt/ Medicinos Bankashttp://www.medbank.lt/ Šiaulių Bankashttp://www.sb.lt/\n\nThe following foreign banks have branches in Lithuania:\n\nBankWebsite Nordeahttp://www.nordea.lt/ SEBhttps://www.seb.lt/ Swedbankhttps://www.swedbank.lt/\n\nIf you’re not from the Eurozone, it’s worth checking whether your home bank has a partnership with a bank in Lithuania. You may be able to use their ATMs for free or pay lower fees."
