        "text": "The Polish zloty is this week's top performing currency, rising 2.4% since national elections were held.\n\nThe votes put the pro-European coalition in power, bringing the potential to unlock EU funding.\n\nWarsaw's WIG20 stock index gained nearly 3%, in contrast to declines in other emerging markets.\n\nPoland's currency and stocks have defied the emerging-market slump, as investors flocked back to the country amid political shifts in Warsaw.\n\nThe zloty is up 2.4% against the US dollar for the week, outperforming all 30 of the other major global currencies in that span, according to Bloomberg data. As of Friday, zloty traded at 4.21 against the dollar.\n\nAlongside the zloty's strength, Poland's WIG20 stock index gained nearly 3% this week, contrasted by a 2.6% slide in the equity benchmark for emerging markets.\n\nThe upswing is especially notable given the headwinds. A historic Treasury market sell-off has sent US bond yields soaring, lifting the dollar and weighing on other currencies. Meanwhile, the threat of a larger Middle Eastern conflict has shifted capital toward lower-risk assets.\n\nThe rally in Poland's markets came after last Sunday's national elections, which are expected to push the populist Law and Justice party, or PiS, out of power.\n\nA pro-European coalition, which could have the potential to unlock new funding and investment opportunities in the country, is seen replacing the PiS.\n\nWhile PiS garnered the most votes, three opposition parties together made up 54% of the ballot, putting the block in a position of power.\n\nThis PiS' eight years in power were notable for its clashes with EU policy, friction with Ukraine, and a medley of national reforms, including the politicization of the country's judicial and media landscape.\n\nLikely to be led by Donald Tusk, a former European Council President, opposition leadership will look to dismantle many of these overhauls, as well as rebalance Poland's ties with its European partners.\n\nIn doing so, investors could expect $37 billion in EU funding to be made available to Poland, aid that was previously blocked by Brussels in protest of PiS' judicial reforms."
