        "text": "On 1 January, Lithuanians will be saying goodbye to the litas, their national currency, which will soon be replaced by the euro. But the Lithuanians will be retaining the coat of arms that currently decorates the litas and, as a decoration on the country’s coinage, can be dated back to the 14th century.\n\nThe name litas for the country’s currency was introduced after the First World War, when it replaced the Ostrubel and Ostmark. In 1941, Following Russia’s occupation of Lithuania, the litas was replaced by the rouble. In 1993, after Lithuania had regained its independence from the Soviet empire, the litas was introduced again.\n\nThe modern-era litas coins come in nine different denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 centas and 1, 2 and 5 litas. In addition there are banknotes of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 litas. (The exchange rate of the litas has been fixed at 3.45280 to the euro.) The coins were struck by a mint located in Vilnius, and the banknotes were printed by printing houses across the country.\n\nAll litas coins bear an image of a knight in armour on horseback holding a sword and shield. It is known as “Vytis” or “the chaser”. Article 15 of Lithuanian’s constitution of 1992 declares that: “The coat of arms of the state shall be a white Vytis on a red field”. As far back as the 15th century this figure became the coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nThe litas coins show, on the opposite side from the coat of arms, a graphic pattern. The 1, 2 and 5 centas are decorated with different symbols. ‘The pillars of Gediminas’ are on the one centas coin, which is also a coat of arms and one of the country’s earliest symbols, first used by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later as part of aristocracy. The two-centas coin shows a sun pattern and the five- centas a leaf with small snakes.\n\nThe banknotes show people who have played an important role in the country’s history. An image of Vincas Kudirka (1858-99), a writer and author of the national anthem, is displayed on the 500-litas note. The ten-litas note shows portraits of the pilots Steponas Darius and Stasys Girėnas, who are considered national heroes. In 1933, they attempted a non-stop flight from New York to Kaunas, but died in an air crash.\n\nFor the euro currency, there is less possibility for variation. The banknotes are all of a common design, whatever the country. For the coins, one side of the coins is common to all eurozone countries, while one side of the coin bears a national design. Some countries opt for a different design for each denomination.\n\nLithuania has opted for the same design – the Vytis – on each denomination of euro coins. In addition to the Vytis, the coins feature the year and country of issuance, ‘Lietuva’ in Lithuanian, on the national side. The coins, designed by sculptor Antanas Žukauskas, also feature the twelve stars of the European flag. The two-euro coin has an inscription in Lithuanian on the edge: “laisvė, venybė, gerovė” which means “freedom, unity, well-being”."
