        "text": "If you’re planning a trip to Poland, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with the country’s main currency, the Polish złoty. The złoty has been the official currency of Poland since 1924, and it’s used by over 38 million people in the country. The złoty is abbreviated as PLN and is subdivided into 100 groszy.\n\nThe złoty is the most traded currency in Central and Eastern Europe and ranks 21st most-traded in the world. While many places in Poland accept credit cards, it’s always a good idea to have some złoty on hand for smaller purchases or transactions.\n\nThe history of the złoty dates back to the Middle Ages when it was a silver coin used in Poland and other countries in the region. Today, the złoty is made up of coins and banknotes, with denominations ranging from 1 grosz to 500 złoty. Whether you’re exchanging money before your trip or withdrawing cash from an ATM in Poland, it’s important to understand the value of the złoty and how it works in the country’s economy.\n\nHistorical Journey of Polish Złoty\n\nThe history of Polish currency dates back to the Middle Ages when the Kingdom of Poland used various coins such as pennies, ducats, and florins. The first Polish zloty coins were introduced in the second half of the 17th century. The name “zloty” means “golden” in Polish and was used to describe a gold coin that was worth 30 groszy. The Polish monetary system was complex and intricate until a monetary reform was done in the 18th century, which removed all other monetary units except the zloty divided into 30 groszy.\n\nDuring World War I, the zloty lost its value due to inflation. After the war, Poland introduced a new currency called the Polish mark, which was later replaced by the second zloty in 1924. The second zloty was pegged to the US dollar until 1939 when Poland was invaded by Germany. During World War II, the zloty lost its value again due to hyperinflation. After the war, Poland introduced the third zloty in 1950, which was pegged to the Soviet ruble until 1990.\n\nHistory of Coins\n\nThe history of the Polish currency, the złoty, is a fascinating journey through centuries of economic evolution and transformative reforms. The journey began with the denarius in the 10th century, a tangible form of currency circulating through Poland. During this era, Polish coinage was predominantly silver-based, with the denarius minted from bullion, also including copper and other precious metals. The grzywna, not the pound, served as the standard unit of mass, with one grzywna equivalent to 240 denars. The Prague groschen held sway from the 1300s to the mid-16th century, overshadowing the need for a national currency in Central Europe.\n\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, the term “złoty,” meaning “the golden one,” initially referred to various foreign gold coins. The Sejm parliament, in 1496, debated and approved the creation of a domestic currency – the złoty. An exchange rate of 30 grosz for one gold piece was established, maintaining this traditional subdivision until the 19th century. In the years 1526–1535, King Sigismund I, as part of a monetary reform proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus and Justus Decius, defined the złoty as a legal tender in a 1528 minting ordinance.\n\nThe monetary landscape remained intricate until Stanisław II Augustus implemented a reform in the 16th to 18th centuries, removing all other monetary units except the złoty divided into 30 groszy. Poland’s currency became linked to the Holy Roman Empire, setting exchange rates and standards.\n\nRadical changes occurred during the Kościuszko Uprising, responding to economic collapse and territorial loss. Tadeusz Kościuszko introduced paper money as an alternative to coinage in 1794. The złoty persisted through the Partitions of Poland, Napoleon’s Duchy of Warsaw, and subsequent geopolitical shifts.\n\nThe Second Złoty, introduced in 1924, faced economic challenges, stabilizing after initial inflation. It was pegged to the US dollar and later reintroduced to the gold standard. World War II brought occupation, with the Germans establishing an Emissary Bank in Kraków. Post-war, the Third Złoty was introduced in 1950, denominated and linked to gold.\n\nThe fall of communism in 1989 led to hyperinflation in 1990, requiring the Fourth Złoty in 1995. The currency underwent redenomination, with redesigned coins and banknotes featuring Polish monarchs.\n\nLooking ahead, Poland’s accession to the European Union in 2004 includes an obligation to adopt the euro eventually. Discussions on joining the Eurozone continue, though constitutional amendments are required. Recent polls indicate around 60% support for adopting the Euro, reflecting a dynamic future for the złoty within the European economic landscape.\n\nHistory of Bills\n\nPoland’s banknotes, ranging from 12 to 15 centimeters in length and 60 to 75 millimeters in width, showcase a unique design and historical chronology. The obverse features the left profile of Polish monarchs in armor or royal regalia, arranged chronologically based on their reigns. The reverse displays significant landmarks, early coinage, or historical objects, adorned with architectural elements like portals, columns, windows, or floral motifs. Predominant colors include brown, pink, purple, blue, green, and gold.\n\nThe face value is numerically indicated in the upper corners of the obverse and reverse, with the written form embedded vertically and horizontally, respectively. Each note boasts the shieldless coat of arms of the Republic of Poland and bears signatures of the President and General Treasurer of the National Bank of Poland (NBP).\n\nThe series, introduced in 1994, includes denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 złoty, each featuring monarchs like Mieszko I, Boleslaus I the Brave, Casimir III the Great, Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila), and Sigismund I the Old, respectively. Additionally, a 500 złoty note was introduced in 2016, featuring John III Sobieski. The dimensions of each note increase with higher denominations, reflecting a thoughtful design approach. These banknotes, with their historical depictions and architectural elements, contribute to Poland’s rich cultural narrative and provide a visually engaging representation of its heritage.\n\nInflation and Buying Power of the Polish Złoty\n\nIn Poland, the inflation rate is currently 5.3%, which means that the cost of living is rising at a faster rate than in many other countries. This can have an impact on the buying power of the Polish currency, as it may become more expensive to purchase goods and services.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the Polish government has taken steps to combat inflation, such as increasing interest rates and implementing policies to support small businesses. These measures may help to stabilize the economy and prevent inflation from spiraling out of control.\n\nThe exchange rate of the Polish currency, the zloty, is another important economic indicator. The exchange rate determines how much one currency is worth in relation to another currency.\n\nThe exchange rate can have a significant impact on the economy, as it affects the cost of imports and exports. A weaker zloty can make it more expensive to import goods from other countries, while a stronger zloty can make it more expensive to export goods to other countries. As such, the exchange rate is closely monitored by economists and policymakers to ensure that it remains stable.\n\nOverall, the Polish Zloty is a stable currency with a relatively low inflation rate. It is widely accepted throughout Poland, and you can exchange foreign currencies at banks, exchange offices, and some hotels. When traveling or doing business in Poland, it is always a good idea to have some Polish Zloty on hand for small purchases and tips.\n\nThe Polish Złoty\n\nThe Polish zloty (PLN) is the official currency of Poland, introduced in 1924 but with origins dating back to 1919. The Narodowy Bank Polski (National Bank of Poland) is the central bank responsible for issuing and regulating the zloty. Banknotes are available in denominations of zł10, zł20, zł50, zł100, zł200, and zł500, while coins come in values of zł1, zł2, and zł5, with 100 groszy making up one zloty.\n\nThe zloty operates with a free-floating exchange rate in the foreign exchange markets, meaning it is not tied to any specific currency. Common pairings for the zloty include the U.S. dollar (USD), euro, Swiss franc (CHF), British pound (GBP), and Australian dollar (AUD). Over the years, the PLN exchange rate has fluctuated, ranging from two PLN to one U.S. dollar to over 4.5 PLN to one U.S. dollar. Since the Great Recession in 2008, it has typically ranged between three to four PLN to the dollar. As of June 4, 2023, the exchange rate stands at approximately zł4.19 for one U.S. dollar.\n\nzł10\n\nThe 10 Polish Złotych note, the lowest denomination in the złoty currency, has been in circulation since the currency’s redenomination in 1995. The 10 złoty note, measuring 120×60 mm, is predominantly brown and features a portrait of Duke Mieszko I on the obverse, along with a denarius coin and Romanesque columns from the Tyniec Abbey on the reverse.\n\nzł20\n\nThe 20 złoty note, sized 126×63 mm, has pink and purple hues, showcasing Boleslaus I the Brave on the obverse and a denarius coin, along with the Rotunda of Saint Nicolas and a fragment of Gniezno Doors on the reverse.\n\nzł50\n\nThe 50 złoty note, 132×66 mm in size and blue in color displays Casimir III the Great on the obverse, and the reverse features the Polish white eagle with royal regalia, Kraków, and Kazimierz by Hartmann Schedel.\n\nzł100\n\nThe 100 złoty note, measuring 138×69 mm and in green tones, presents Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila) on the obverse, with the reverse showcasing the Polish white eagle with Grunwald swords and Teutonic armor, along with Malbork Castle.\n\nzł200\n\nThe 200 złoty note, sized 144×72 mm and in gold and yellow, features Sigismund I the Old on the obverse and the Polish white eagle from the Sigismund’s Chapel, Wawel Castle, on the reverse.\n\nzł500\n\nThe 500 złoty note, measuring 150×75 mm and combining light blue, pink, gold, and brown, highlights John III Sobieski on the obverse and the Polish white eagle, along with Wilanów Palace, on the reverse. These banknotes were introduced in 1994 and entered circulation on January 1, 1995, except for the 500 złoty note, which was released on February 10, 2017.\n\nCurrency Usage in Poland\n\nThe official currency of Poland is the Polish złoty (symbol: zł), which is divided into 100 groszy (symbol: gr). Currently, there are nine denominations of coins in circulation (1 gr, 2 gr, 5 gr, 10 gr, 20 gr, 50 gr, 1 zł, 2 zł, 5 zł) and six denominations of banknotes (10 zł, 20 zł, 50 zł, 100 zł, 200 zł, and 500 zł) 1.
