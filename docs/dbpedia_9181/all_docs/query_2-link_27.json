        "text": "Indicators of Competitiveness\n\nAn important determinant of a country’s external position is its international competitiveness. One approach to evaluating the role of the exchange rate in external sector performance is to examine its impact on indicators of competitiveness. An assessment of the appropriateness of the exchange rate based on measures of competitiveness involves a comparison of past movements in prices or costs at home relative to those in major trading partners, converted to a common currency using nominal exchange rates. It should be recognized at the outset that while focusing on relative price and cost effects, these indicators do not reflect the effects on the equilibrium real exchange rate associated with, as examples, differential income or technological growth rates among countries. Second, they are backward–looking, as they assess competitiveness relative to an equilibrium period in the past.\n\nThe developments in the Polish real effective exchange rate (REER) indices based on three alternative price and cost measures—namely, consumer prices, producer prices, and normalized unit labor costs—were shown in Chart 4–1.10 The chart indicates a clear structural break in the REER indices after January 1990. All indices rose sharply and have stayed thereafter at a level significantly higher than in the prereform period. This break is hard to interpret, since the equilibrium real exchange rate is unknown. While the initial sharp appreciation might be attributed to the substantial price shock and the fixing of the nominal exchange rate at a constant level until May 1991, more fundamental factors, including the dramatic liberalization of trade and various structural changes, including shifts in trade patterns, might have brought the real exchange rates to a new equilibrium level.\n\nDuring 1991 and most of 1992, the zloty appreciated sharply in real terms relative to its levels in 1990, despite the devaluations in May and June and the subsequent switch to a crawling peg regime. The real appreciation was most pronounced in the ULC-based REER index, which mainly reflected the continued sharp fall in relative labor productivity, while the rate of growth of wages exceeded that of inflation (Chart 4–1, lower panel). Since the last quarter of 1992, there has been a significant depreciation of the ULC–based REER index that reflected, mostly, the sharp rise in labor productivity in Poland relative to its major trading partners. The CPI–based index appreciated from mid–1992 until the beginning of 1993. The indicators as measured by both CPI and PPI have been fairly stable since then.\n\nIn the Polish case, the step devaluations of the zloty have been viewed as necessary to redress competitiveness problems, in the first instance following the hyperinflation in 1989, and subsequently in reaction to concerns that the rate of crawl had been insufficient. Against this background, the developments in the REER indices following the devaluations of the zloty are summarized in Table 4–2. The first two columns of the table indicate the percentage change in the REER indices from the point of a discrete devaluation until December 1993. The final column gives the changes that occurred after the adoption of the crawling peg regime.\n\nTable 4.–2.\n\nCompetitiveness Indicators1\n\n(Percent change as of December 1993)\n\nSources: IMF staff calculations based on six major trading partners of Poland (France, Germany, Japan, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States).\n\n1A positive figure indicates a real appreciation and, thus, a loss in competitiveness.\n\n2As of November 1993.\n\nTable 4.–2.\n\nCompetitiveness Indicators1\n\n(Percent change as of December 1993)\n\nSince the Devaluation of: Since the Crawling Peg, May 1991 February 1992 October 1991 Real exchange rate based on: Consumer price index (CPI)2 2.4 2.0 1.0 Producer price index (PPI) -5.2 -10.0 -16.6 Unit labor costs (ULC) -17.4 -21.4 -23.7\n\nSources: IMF staff calculations based on six major trading partners of Poland (France, Germany, Japan, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States).\n\n1A positive figure indicates a real appreciation and, thus, a loss in competitiveness.\n\n2As of November 1993.\n\nTable 4.–2.\n\nCompetitiveness Indicators1\n\n(Percent change as of December 1993)\n\nSince the Devaluation of: Since the Crawling Peg, May 1991 February 1992 October 1991 Real exchange rate based on: Consumer price index (CPI)2 2.4 2.0 1.0 Producer price index (PPI) -5.2 -10.0 -16.6 Unit labor costs (ULC) -17.4 -21.4 -23.7\n\nSources: IMF staff calculations based on six major trading partners of Poland (France, Germany, Japan, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States).\n\n1A positive figure indicates a real appreciation and, thus, a loss in competitiveness.\n\n2As of November 1993.\n\nTrends in the REER indices can also be used to compute the “effectiveness index” of the three devaluations of the zloty. The index can be viewed as the cumulative ex post elasticity of the real exchange rate with respect to the nominal exchange rate, E, for k periods after a given devaluation and, in effect, shows how much of the nominal devaluation was eroded in the periods following the exchange rate change:\n\nCalculations based on consumer prices indicate a loss of external competitiveness after both the May 1991 and the February 1992 devaluation. When producer prices are used, there is some gain in competitiveness after both discrete devaluations. Similarly, based on indicators measured by ULC, competitiveness has improved significantly. Moreover, the competitiveness of Polish exports as measured by ULC and PPI has improved since the switch to crawling peg.\n\nE f f e c t i v e n e s s ⁢ I n d e x k = Δ R E E R K Δ E k\n\nwhere k refers to the period after the devaluation. (k = 0, 1, 2, 3…). Both variables are measured in terms of a percentage change over the k periods following the devaluation. If the index takes a value of one, it means that the nominal exchange rate adjustment has been transferred into a one–to–one real devaluation over the k periods. A negative value indicates that more than 100 percent of the devaluation has vanished. (Note that in this discussion, an increase in the index indicates a real depreciation.) Edwards (1989) identifies a devaluation episode as “successful” if three years after the devaluation, the effectiveness index exceeds 0.3 (i.e., no more than 70 percent of the devaluation impact is eroded by price increases), and the current account or net foreign assets have improved.\n\nThe effectiveness indices for the three devaluations of the zloty in 1990–92 are set out in Table 4–3. Calculations based on all three indices show that the January 1990 devaluation was quickly reversed, since the exchange rate was fixed at a constant level until mid–1991 and inflation was high following the trade and price liberalization. Three years after the devaluation, the effectiveness index had become negative. Nevertheless, the trade and current account showed a substantial improvement in 1992 relative to 1989, and the reserve position strengthened significantly.\n\nTable 4–3.\n\nIndex of Effectiveness of Nominal Devaluations\n\nSource: IMF staff calculations.\n\nTable 4–3.\n\nIndex of Effectiveness of Nominal Devaluations\n\nNumber of Quarters Following Devaluation: Quarter of\n\nDevaluation Devaluation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 (Based on consumer price index) 1990.1 0.02 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 1991.2 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 … … … 1992.1 0.21 0.18 <0 <0 <0 <0 … … … … … … (Based on producer price index) 1990.1 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 1991.2 0.89 <0 0.34 0.34 <0 0.08 0.38 0.22 0.23 … … … 1992.1 0.67 <0 0.19 0.58 0.35 0.34 … … … … … … (Based on unit labor costs) 1990.1 0.29 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 1991 2 0.54 <0 0.31 0.63 0.06 0.39 0.64 0.64 0.61 … … … 1992.1 1.23 0.26 0.68 0.97 0.93 0.86 … … … … … …\n\nSource: IMF staff calculations.\n\nTable 4–3.\n\nIndex of Effectiveness of Nominal Devaluations\n\nNumber of Quarters Following Devaluation: Quarter of\n\nDevaluation Devaluation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 (Based on consumer price index) 1990.1 0.02 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 1991.2 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 … … … 1992.1 0.21 0.18 <0 <0 <0 <0 … … … … … … (Based on producer price index) 1990.1 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 1991.2 0.89 <0 0.34 0.34 <0 0.08 0.38 0.22 0.23 … … … 1992.1 0.67 <0 0.19 0.58 0.35 0.34 … … … … … … (Based on unit labor costs) 1990.1 0.29 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 <0 1991 2 0.54 <0 0.31 0.63 0.06 0.39 0.64 0.64 0.61 … … … 1992.1 1.23 0.26 0.68 0.97 0.93 0.86 … … … … … …\n\nSource: IMF staff calculations.\n\nBased on consumer prices, none of the devaluations seems to have translated into real depreciations. On the basis of PPI–based calculations, the most effective devaluation episode seems to be in February 1992, when a real depreciation was maintained for a longer period of time, due to a substantial reduction in inflation. Based on ULC, however, the discrete devaluations in 1991 and 1992 were broadly successful: the index exceeded 30 percent in all six quarters following the February devaluation.\n\nThe trends in the effectiveness index are broadly consistent with the results of Table 4–2; the nominal devaluations of the zloty were not very effective in maintaining real depreciations in the exchange rate based on relative consumer prices. One explanation is the relatively small size of the devaluations, particularly since the switch to a crawling peg regime, and the fact that inflation has remained relatively high, though substantial reductions have been achieved since 1990. More importantly, these computations emphasize that the interpretation of a country’s competitive position can be quite different based on alternative indicators of competitiveness. Several factors underlie these differences.11\n\nFirst, movements in the index based on producer prices, which contains mostly traded goods in the case of Poland, are only likely to indicate the degree of substitutability between Polish goods and those of its trading partners. Its small variation, especially during 1992–93, supports the view that Poland’s traded goods are close substitutes for those of its trading partners. When traded goods are close substitutes, exporters can “price to market” in response to exchange rate changes by squeezing profits in the short term. Hence, such indices provide little information on the relative profitability of domestic versus foreign traded goods and on incentives to shift resources into these sectors. Reliance on such indices as a measure of competitiveness is made more difficult by the lack of cross–country comparisons with respect to the commodity composition of the index. In addition, some features of the transition process might have artificially depressed producers’ prices during the early years of transition, which might mean that the observed prices are not a good guide to underlying competitiveness. For example, the sale of excessive stocks typically held by enterprises in command economies and the absence of hard budget constraints on many enterprises during the early years of transition might have distorted prices (see Turner and Van’t dack (1993), p. 70).\n\nSecond, an indicator based on ULC can offer a measure of the underlying profitability of nonlabor factors in producing manufactured (traded) goods, and thus is likely the most useful of the indicators used here for assessing competitiveness. Nevertheless, while they avoid certain limitations of the PP1–and CPI–based indicators, ULC–based indicators might also have certain drawbacks. First, apparent gains in labor productivity due to the substitution of capital for labor are frequently associated with an increase in unit capital costs, so that improvements in terms of measured ULC may overstate the underlying gains in competitiveness. Similarly, additional nonlabor costs in production, such as intermediate goods costs, may distort the return to capital. 12 Finally, ULC indices may reflect measurement errors in their components. In the case of Poland, resources have likely shifted to more labor–intensive industries, indicating that the depreciation in the ULC–based index understates the real depreciation. The recent declines in ULC and improvements in labor productivity are, thus, encouraging and point to significant competitiveness gains. Nevertheless, trends in the ULC–based indicators should also be interpreted with caution, as they might reflect the recent labor shedding in manufacturing and a possible misreporting of wages owing to the then–prevailing punitive tax on excessive wage increases.\n\nThird, competitiveness indicators based on consumer prices are one of the most comprehensive indices, including traded and nontraded goods, and are calculated on the basis of a basket of goods fairly comparable across countries. However, they may be poor proxies for the competitiveness of the trading sector, as they in addition include imported goods and nontraded goods and services, while at the same time excluding some important traded goods such as intermediate inputs. More importantly, consumer prices are subject to the influence of price controls, subsidies, and indirect taxes. In the case of Poland, the change in the structure of prices following the elimination or reduction of subsidies, the introduction of the VAT, and the import surcharge would tend to bias consumer inflation upwards, resulting in a distorted picture of international competitiveness. Furthermore, if the country has a faster growth of labor productivity in the traded goods (manufacturing) sector than in the service sector, CPI–based indicators show a tendency toward a real appreciation with no adverse implications for competitiveness, at least in the short run. This possibility is supported by the movements in indicators based on unit labor costs. The implication of these considerations for Poland is that the recent appreciation of the CPI–based real exchange rate is indeed normal and the deterioration in competitiveness based on consumer prices is more apparent than real.\n\nIn short, while overall the trends in the real effective exchange rate indices suggest that Poland’s competitiveness is not an issue of immediate concern, one should keep in mind the long–term implications of a change in the equilibrium real exchange rates and use caution in deriving conclusions about the competitiveness of a country based on such indicators. That is, the examination of trends in competitiveness alone–independent of, among other things, considerations of structural and cyclical developments in output and demand–generally provides only a partial account of the developments in external trade. In order to get a broader picture of the external sector’s performance, one needs to combine these indicators with direct measures of competitiveness, such as the country’s market shares.\n\nExternal Sector Balances and International Reserves\n\nThe examination of a range of indicators in the external sector supports the findings of the previous subsection: overall. Poland’s competitiveness position has been favorable. Indeed, during the period under review, Poland has increased its share in western markets, attained a favorable foreign reserve position, and witnessed a sharp decline in its premium in the parallel over the official foreign exchange market—the premium fell from about 40 percent at the end of 1989 to within a 2 percent margin in 1992–93. In this subsection, an overview of developments in the external sector will be provided by incorporating a number of other macroeconomic indicators, including the differential growth performance among trading partners.\n\nThe main performance indicators are provided in Chart 4–6 and Appendix Table A9. The performance of the external sector improved significantly in the first year of the program, as measured by the trade and current accounts, and the increase in foreign reserves. The improvement in the trade balance from a small surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 1989 to a surplus of 3.6 percent in 1990 reflected not only the impact of the devaluation, but also the shift of goods from domestic to external markets following the alleviation of shortages, and as households suffered income losses from a sharp fall in real wages. Consequently, the current account shifted to a surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP in 1990 from a deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP in 1989. Foreign reserves rose sharply, in part reflecting the strengthened current account position.\n\nThe balance of payments deteriorated sharply at the end of 1990, reflecting not only the real appreciation of the zloty, but also the rise in domestic demand as financial and incomes policies were relaxed. The significant fall in reserves and the worsening of the current account were followed by the May 1991 devaluation, which, together with the subsequent switch to a crawling peg, failed to prevent a real appreciation, as the increase in real wages was combined with a decline in labor productivity. Despite an overall appreciation based on relative prices in 1992, sharp gains in productivity led to an improvement in competitiveness in terms of the ULC measure, and the external sector showed a small improvement. Reflecting the impact of the devaluations in 1991–92, the reserve position remained higher. Even though the REER indices based on ULC and producer prices point to no loss in competitiveness in 1993, the trade and current account balances deteriorated sharply. Reserves started to fall in the second part of 1992 until mid–1993, likely reflecting expectations of a devaluation and deteriorating current account position.\n\nThe weakness of the external position, and in particular of the trade balance, in 1993 may be attributed to several factors. First, the sharp rise in imports in the first half of the year was in part due to some transitory influences, including a systematic advancing of purchases as a hedge against a widely perceived devaluation risk and in expectation of sharp price rises from tax and tariff changes in midyear. There is also some evidence that there are significant unrecorded exports (see Section VI, “Integration into the World Economy”).\n\nThe most important factor behind the weak external sector performance in 1993, however, may have been a sharp recovery–driven rise in import demand in Poland, whose economy has been growing at a faster rate than the economies of its trading partners, and which needs to modernize its stock of capital.;13 In fact, import volumes grew by about 25 percent in 1993, a surge that was not offset by a gain in exports. Exports rose only marginally over the same period, reflecting the continued slowdown in economic activity as well as protectionist tendencies in Poland’s western European trading partners. 14\n\nWhile trends in external sector performance were a source of concern in the first half of 1993, Poland registered a current account surplus in October and November, mainly reflecting the reduction in the trade deficit in these two months. Import volumes fell sharply in the last quarter of the year attributed, in part, to the August devaluation and in part to the introduction of the VAT, while export volumes rose slightly.\n\nIt is important to note that despite the adverse developments in the external accounts in 1993, reserves have remained at a sustainable level, the parallel market premium has been small and negative, and more importantly, Poland increased its share of western markets. The share in Germany’s imports more than doubled between 1989 and the first half of 1993—a substantial increase, though the share is small in absolute terms (about 1.5 percent). Focusing only on imports from the Eastern European countries indicates that Poland’s share in the German market rose about 9 percentage points, to 30 percent, between 1989 and the first three quarters of 1993.\n\nClearly, one cannot attribute the changes in the external sector’s performance to the exchange rate policy alone. The policy contributed to the improvement of the external sector in the first year of the program, when it was accompanied by tight financial and incomes policies. The performance of the external sector should thus also be evaluated in the context of accompanying financial and incomes policies. Moreover, other factors, including the income effects that are associated with differential growth rates between Poland and its trading partners, have also played a role in the external sector’s performance."
