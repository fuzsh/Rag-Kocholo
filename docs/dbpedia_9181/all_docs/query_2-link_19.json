        "text": "The National Flag of Poland was officially adopted on August 1, 1919.\n\nThe National Flag of Poland features two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red. The flag colors have long been associated with Poland and its coat of arms. The white color represents the hope for peace by all the people of Poland. The red color symbolizes the many struggles for freedom over the centuries. The flag has a height-to-width ratio of 5:8.\n\nHistory of the flag of Poland\n\nSeveral different flags have been used in Poland before the current flag was adopted. In 1138, the Kingdom of Poland was made up of several duchies, each of which had its banner. In 1320, Poland became unified under King Wladyslaw, whose coat of arms consisting of a white eagle with a crown on its head, was used as the national symbol. In 1569, through the Union of Lublin, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania united to become a commonwealth. The colors of the flag were adopted from the coat of arms of both the nations and consisted of the eagle of Poland and the mounted knight of the King of Lithuania. At the end of the 18th century, Austria, Russia, and Prussia collaborated to dissolve the commonwealth and break the union between Poland and Lithuania. Subsequently, Poland became a partitioned territory for the next 123 years. A new coat of arms was adopted by most of the partitioned regions, while some of them chose to retain the white eagle. During WWI, the German control over the Western-Polish Lithuanian region broke due to the Bolshevik Revolution, resulting in the crippling of Russia’s authority over the region. As a result, Poland became independent of these foreign powers. However, the previous red flag with the white eagle was rejected and a simple horizontal bicolor (white-red) flag was adopted as the national flag.\n\nThe National Coat of Arms of Poland\n\nThe National Coat of Arms of Poland consists of a white eagle resting against a red shield. The eagle wears a golden crown and has a golden beak and talons. It also has outstretched wings and its head is turned to its right.\n\nLegend has it that the founder of Poland - Lech, saw a white eagle's nest, and as he looked upon the bird, a ray of sunshine fell on its wings making it appear as if they were tipped in gold. Delighted, he decided to settle and made the eagle his emblem.\n\nThe current National Coat of Arms of Poland has been designed by Professor Zygmunt Kaminski.\n\nThe current official currency of Poland is Polish złoty (zł, PLN). The Polish złoty is subdivided into 100 groszy (cents). In 1990, Poland redenominated the złoty, where, one new złoty was equal to 10,000 old złotys. The National Bank of Poland, the country's central bank, is responsible for producing and maintaining the stability of the złoty. In 1990, a fourth version of the złoty was introduced and is the country's current currency. Coins were minted in 1994 and circulated in 1995.\n\nCoins\n\nThe current version of polish złoty coins were first minted in 1990, but not circulated until 1995. There are one hundred groszy (gr) to one złoty (zł). The coins in circulation are the one grosz, two grosze, five groszy, ten groszy, 20 groszy, 50 groszy, 1 zł, 2 zł, and 5 zł.\n\nBanknotes\n\nUnlike the minting of coins, the production of banknotes posed a bigger challenge. In 1990, a new version of the banknotes was printed in the denominations of 10 zł, 20 zł, 50 zł, 100 zł, and 200 zł. In 2012, the National Bank of Poland introduced a new feature on its banknotes. Apart from the new feature, everything else remains the same except for the 200zł note, whose color was changed."
