        "text": "Although the foreign exchange market is often billed as a banker's game, currencies can sometimes be a great way to diversify a portfolio that has hit a bit of a rut. It's a market that can also offer tremendous opportunities when other global forums enter the doldrums.\n\nKnowing a little bit about forex and the fundamentals behind it can make significant additions to any trader, investor, or portfolio manager's arsenal. Let's take a look at eight currencies every trader or investor should know, along with the central banks of their respective nations.\n\n1. U.S. Dollar (USD)\n\nCentral Bank: Federal Reserve\n\nCurrent Interest Rate: https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/\n\nEstablished in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed is the central banking body of the U.S. The system is headed by a chair and board of governors, with most of the focus being placed on the branch known as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which supervises open market operations as well as monetary policy or interest rates.\n\nThe current committee is comprised of five of the 12 current Federal Reserve Bank presidents and seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York president always serving on the committee. Although there are 12 voting members, non-members can share their views on the current economic situation when the committee meets every six weeks. This includes additional Fed Bank presidents.\n\nThe Almighty Dollar\n\nSometimes referred to as the greenback, the USD is the home denomination of the world's largest economy, the United States. As with any currency, the dollar is supported by economic fundamentals, including gross domestic product (GDP), and manufacturing and employment reports.\n\nBut the dollar is also widely influenced by the central bank and any announcements about interest rate policy. The USD is a benchmark that trades against other major currencies, especially the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound.\n\n2. Euro (EUR)\n\nCentral Bank: European Central Bank (ECB)\n\nCurrent Interest Rate: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/key_ecb_interest_rates/html/index.en.html\n\nHeadquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, the ECB is the central bank of the 20 member countries of the eurozone. Just like the FOMC, the ECB has a main body responsible for making monetary policy decisions, the Executive Board, which is composed of four members plus a president and vice-president.\n\nThe ECB policy heads are chosen with the consideration that four of the seats are reserved for four of the five largest economies in the system, which include Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. This ensures that the largest economies are always represented in the case of a change in administration. The board meets almost every week.\n\nIn addition to having jurisdiction over monetary policy, the ECB also holds the right to issue banknotes as it sees fit. Similar to the Federal Reserve, policymakers can interject at times of bank or system failures.\n\nHowever, the ECB differs from the Fed in an important area: Instead of maximizing employment and maintaining the stability of long-term interest rates, the ECB works toward a prime principle of price stability, with secondary commitments to general economic policies. As a result, policymakers will turn their focus to consumer inflation in making key interest rate decisions.\n\nThe Dollar's Nemesis\n\nAlthough the monetary body is somewhat complex, the eurozone's currency is not. The euro tends to be a slower currency against the USD compared to its colleagues like the British pound or Australian dollar. On an average day, the base currency can trade between 50 and 100 pips or percentages in point with more volatile swings averaging slightly more, at 130 pips wide per day.\n\nAnother trading consideration is time. Because the FX market is open 24/7, forex traders must strategically set FX trading schedules. Trading in the euro-based pairs can be seen during the overlap of London and U.S. sessions. This occurs from 8 a.m. through 12 p.m. EST.\n\n3. Japanese Yen (JPY)\n\nCentral Bank: Bank of Japan (BoJ)\n\nCurrent Interest Rate: http://www.boj.or.jp/en/index.htm\n\nEstablished as far back as 1882, the BoJ serves as the central bank of the world's third-largest economy. It governs monetary policy as well as currency issuance, money market operations, and data/economic analysis.\n\nThe main monetary Policy Board tends to work toward economic stability, constantly exchanging views with the reigning administration, while simultaneously working toward its independence and transparency. Meeting about monetary policy eight times a year, the central bank governor leads a team of nine policy members, including two appointed deputy governors.\n\nTechnically Complex, Fundamentally Simple\n\nThe Japanese yen (JPY) tends to trade under the identity of a carry trade component. Offering a low interest rate, the currency is pitted against higher-yielding currencies, especially the Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and British pound.\n\nAs a result, the underlying tends to be very erratic, pushing FX traders to take technical perspectives on a longer-term basis. Average daily ranges are in the region of 50 to 130 pips, with extremes well over 200 pips.\n\n4. British Pound (GBP)\n\nCentral Bank: Bank of England (BoE)\n\nCurrent Interest Rate: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\n\nAs the central bank of the United Kingdom, the BoE serves as the monetary equivalent of the Federal Reserve System. The Court of Directors is a governing body appointed by the Crown, made up of five executive members and as many as nine others, including the chair and deputy chair.\n\nThere is also a Monetary Policy Committee, headed by the governor of the bank and made up of nine members, four of whom are appointed by the Chancellor of Exchequer. Announcing policy at least eight times a year, the MPC decides on interest rates and broader monetary policy, with primary considerations of total price stability in the economy.\n\nAs such, the MPC also has a benchmark of consumer price inflation set at 2%. If this benchmark is compromised, the governor has the responsibility to notify the Chancellor of Exchequer through a letter, one of which came in 2007 as the U.K. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose sharply to 3.1%. The release of this letter tends to be a harbinger to markets, as it increases the probability of contractionary monetary policy.\n\nThe Queen's Currency\n\nA little bit more volatile than the euro, the British pound, also sometimes referred to as pound sterling or cable, tends to trade a wider range through the day. With swings that can encompass 100 to 150 pips, it isn't unusual to see the pound trade as narrowly as 50 pips.\n\nSwings in notable cross currencies tend to give this major a volatile nature, with traders focusing on pairs like the British pound/Japanese yen and the British pound/Swiss franc. As a result, the currency can be seen as most volatile through both London and U.S. sessions, with minimal movements during Asian hours between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m. EST.\n\n5. Swiss Franc (CHF)\n\nCentral Bank: Swiss National Bank (SNB)\n\nCurrent Interest Rate: http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/stat/statpub/zidea/id/current_interest_exchange_rates\n\nDifferent from all other major central banks, the SNB is viewed as a governing body with private and public ownership. This belief stems from the fact that the SNB is technically a corporation under special regulation. As a result, a little over half of the governing body is owned by the sovereign cantons or states of Switzerland and other public institutions.\n\nIt is this arrangement that emphasizes the economic and financial stability policies dictated by the governing board of the SNB. Smaller than most governing bodies, monetary policy decisions are created by three major bank heads who meet on a quarterly basis. The Governing Board creates the band (plus or minus 50 basis points) of where the interest rate will reside.\n\nA Banker's Currency\n\nThe euro and Swiss franc have an interesting relationship. Similar to the euro, the CHF hardly makes significant moves in any of the individual sessions. As a result, look for this particular currency to trade in the average daily range of 80 to 100 pips per day. High-frequency volume for this currency is usually pitted for the London session, which is 3 a.m. to noon EST.\n\n6. Canadian Dollar (CAD)\n\nCentral Bank: Bank of Canada (BoC)\n\nCurrent Interest Rate: https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/key-interest-rate/\n\nEstablished by the Bank of Canada Act of 1934, the BoC serves as the central bank called upon to focus on the goals of low and stable inflation, a safe and secure currency, financial stability, and the efficient management of government funds and public debt.\n\nActing independently, Canada's central bank draws similarities with the Swiss National Bank because it is sometimes treated as a corporation, with the minister of finance directly holding shares.\n\nDespite the proximity of the government's interests, it is the governor's responsibility to promote price stability at an arm's length from the current administration while simultaneously considering the government's concerns. With an inflationary benchmark of 2%, the BoC has tended to remain a shade more hawkish rather than accommodative when it comes to any deviations in prices.\n\nThe Loonie\n\nKeeping in touch with major currencies, the Canadian dollar, also called the loonie, tends to trade in similar daily ranges of 50 to 100 pips. Many currency prices and commodities move together, and one unique aspect of the CAD is its relationship with crude oil.\n\nThe country remains a major exporter of the commodity, and as a result, plenty of traders and investors use this currency as either a hedge against current commodity positions or pure speculation, tracing signals from the oil market.\n\n7. Australian/New Zealand Dollar (AUD/NZD)\n\nCentral Banks: Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ)\n\nCurrent Interest Rates: http://www.rba.gov.au/ and http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/\n\nOffering one of the higher interest rates in the major global markets, the RBA has always upheld price stability and economic strength as cornerstones of its long-term plan.\n\nHeaded by the governor, the bank's board is made up of six members-at-large, in addition to a deputy governor and the Secretary to the Treasury. Together, they work toward targeting inflation between 2% and 3%, while meeting eleven times throughout the year.\n\nThe RBNZ looks to promote inflation targeting in a similar fashion. As such, it hopes to maintain a foundation for prices.\n\nA Carry Favorite\n\nBoth currencies have been the focus of carry traders, as the AUD and NZD offer the highest yields available on most platforms. As a result, volatility can be experienced in these pairs if a deleveraging effect takes place.\n\nThe currencies tend to trade in similar averages of 60 to 100 pips. Both currencies also maintain relationships with commodities, most notably silver and gold.\n\n8. South African Rand (ZAR)\n\nCentral Bank: South African Reserve Bank (SARB)\n\nCurrent Interest Rate: https://www.resbank.co.za/\n\nPreviously modeled on the Bank of England, the SARB stands as South Africa's monetary authority. Taking on major responsibilities similar to those of other central banks, the SARB is also known as a creditor in certain situations, a clearing bank, and a major custodian of gold.\n\nAbove all else, the central bank is in charge of the achievement and maintenance of price stability. This also includes intervention in the foreign exchange markets when the situation arises.\n\nThe bank only allows shareholders who reside in South Africa to vote at the annual general meeting. Every 200 shares allow for one vote and there is no limit on the amount of holdings except for the rule stipulated by the South African Reserve Bank Act, which states that \"no shareholder shall hold, or hold in aggregate with his, her, or their associates, more than 10,000 of the total number of 2,000,000 issued shares.\" That comes out to 0.5%. This is to ensure that the interests of the economy precede those of any private individual.\n\nTo maintain this policy, the governor and 15-member board head the bank's activities and work toward monetary goals. The board meets regularly during the year.\n\nEmerging Opportunity\n\nSeen as relatively volatile, the average daily range of the ZAR can be as high as several thousand pips. But don't let the wide daily range fool you. When translated into dollar pips, the movements are equivalent to an average day in the GBP, making the currency a great pair to trade against the USD—especially when taking into consideration the carry potential.\n\nTraders also consider the currency's relationship to gold and platinum. With the economy being a world leader when it comes to exports of both metals, it is only natural to see a correlation similar to that between the CAD and crude oil. As a result, consider the commodities markets in creating opportunities when economic data is scant.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs financial markets continue to evolve and grow globally, foreign exchange and currencies will play an increasingly large role in day-to-day transactions. Notional volumes for the market sector are already averaging over $7.5 trillion per day.\n\nAs a result, whether a conversion for physical trade or a simple portfolio diversification play, currencies continue to offer more opportunities to both retail and institutional investors."
