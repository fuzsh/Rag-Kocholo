        "text": "Now that you are familiar with the look and different types of Polish money then the next question is how do you get your hands on them !\n\nThere are three main options.\n\nIn the UK there are an increasing number of places where you can buy Polish money including travel agents and banks.\n\nIt really depends on how determined you are to get the best exchange rates.\n\nYears ago, options were a lot simpler. If you wanted to buy Polish zloty or any other currency then you would either go to your high street bank or to a travel agent.\n\nThese options still apply but there are other methods of squeezing the most out of your cash, some of which we will discuss below.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense to have some Polish money on you BEFORE you arrive in Poland. It saves you running to the first exchange counter at the airport upon arrival and as we all should know…..airport foreign exchange counters offer the worst exchange rates!\n\n1/ Buy Polish currency at home\n\nIt should be a no brainer to prepare yourself at least with some Polish money before you land on Polish soil.\n\nYou could either go all the way and buy all your Polish spending money before you fly out or use our preferred method of buying enough Polish money to last you 1-2 days and then buy the rest in Poland (exchange rates are better in Poland).\n\nThe old school method, and probably still THE most popular way of buying currency, is to walk into a bank, post office or travel agent and buy your Polish zloty over the counter.\n\nThere is a simplistic beauty about this method. You walk in, you walk out, you get your money. Is it THE most competitive rate on the market? No. Is it the least hassle? Yes.\n\nThere are plenty of comparison sites around where you can compare exchange rates around your area. The truth is that if you wanted to exchange £ 100 to Polish zloty then the difference between all the different exchange counters would be around £ 1 so it’s not really worth the hassle of driving around for the best rate.\n\nAnother method is to use specialist foreign exchange companies where you buy online and the money is delivered to you. They will offer a better exchange rate than the high street but there will usually be a delivery charge for the service and that charge can skew the exchange rate in their favour. You can save money by collecting the money yourself but that comes with all the related hassle of finding somewhere close enough to make it worthwhile.\n\nA specialist travel credit card can be a good option if you shop around. Unlike other cards which will charge you an exchange fee whenever you make a purchase specialist travel cards do not charge a fee. However, if you use these cards to withdraw cash from a machine in Poland then most of these type of cards will charge you interest (even if you pay the amount off in full).\n\nPrepaid cards are also a good option for avoiding card transaction fees. You can load up the card with the amount of your choice (useful if you want to stick to a budget)\n\n2/ Take no cash and use ATM machines in Poland\n\nQuite a risky strategy as it’s always a good idea to have some cash when you arrive in a foreign country. It is true that some ATM machines may convert your money at a more favourable rate than you can get back home but you would need to locate the correct banks that offer the best rates and do you really need this hassle when you’re supposed to be on holiday ?\n\n3/ Buy Polish currency in Poland\n\nIn my opinion this is the best policy for getting a favourable rate and there are plenty if places in Poland where you can easily exchange your currency. Banks will be happy to exchange your foreign currency for Polish currency.\n\nHotels can sometimes offer currency exchange services but be vigilant about the rates they charge as they can sometimes be expensive\n\nBy far the best method of buying Polish money in Poland is getting your money at currency kiosk.\n\nThere are also thousands of kiosks around the country that specialise only in buying and selling foreign currency. Known as a “kantor” they are a very common sight in Polish cities, towns and shopping malls. They usually have the rates displayed outside and it’s always good practise to make sure the rates are favourable so you do not buy blindly.\n\nOne word of advice is to avoid using a kantor in the heart of any tourist spot as the rates are likely to be hiked up whilst the ones just off the main tourist centres usually offer better rates."
