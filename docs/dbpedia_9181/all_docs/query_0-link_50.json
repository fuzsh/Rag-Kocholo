        "text": "How to choose the best money transfer operator?\n\nYou need to fill out the comparison form - take 3 simple steps:\n\nSelect Poland as the sender and Lithuania as the recipient from the drop-down menus.\n\nEnter the amount to send (please note, currencies are delivered automatically).\n\nClick on the \"Compare\" button.\n\n3 options for receiving money will appear (to a bank account, to a card, with cash withdrawal), and for each of them, there is a list of operators capable of performing such a money transfer. Online comparison service Strumok has partnerships with such money transfer operators as TransferGo, Wise, Paysend, Remitly, XE, WorldRemit, Profee, Instarem, CurrencyFair and many others. The list of Partners is constantly growing to meet customers' increasing demand for money transfer services.\n\nCompare these offers. Focus on the final amount: the higher it is, the more profitable it is for you. Also pay attention to the following nuances:\n\noperation confirmation duration (clock icon) — the shorter it is, the better;\n\ncommission (coin icon) — the lower the final percentage, the better;\n\napplication reception and service time (graph icon) — the wider this window is, the more convenient it is.\n\nWhich option should I choose? It's up to you.\n\nHow to get money in Lithuania?\n\nBy card, bank transfer or cash. The last option is relatively fast (requires the least amount of time to carry out the operation), but it is not the safest, because money can be issued in some public place, for example, in a shopping center.\n\nBanks often charge a high commission for their services or offer no very profitable rates (as a result of which even 10 euros lose a few hryvnias). Well, when transferring money to a card, there are monthly limits.\n\nEach method of receiving money has its pros and cons. That is why it is so important to be able to visually compare them before shipping.\n\nComparison service Strumok covers offers for each of three fundamentally different ways of making transactions. Money transfers payouts methods are presented in separate sections of the pop-up menu:\n\nto the map — for those who like to perform financial transactions online;\n\nthrough a bank — for those who are used to offline service;\n\ncash — for fans of relatively fast transactions.\n\nWhich of these options is the best? The one that is most convenient for you personally.\n\nTop money transfer operators from Poland to Lithuania\n\nThese are the services that are licensed in both countries. They operate under the financial supervision of both Poland and Lithuania supervisory authorities and are able to guarantee the security of transactions. These popular operators have gained a reputation, value it and claim the maximum exchange rate, minimum transfer time, and other benefits. We only show offers from operators that meet all of the above conditions.\n\nTransfer from Poland to Lithuania with a minimum commission\n\nHow to make it? Compare the conditions of different services and pay special attention to the coin icon. Click \"More\" and learn the nuances. The lower the percentage, the better. Even if the maximum commission can reach 5% of the amount for some operators, then others conduct a transaction in general with 0%.\n\nThe fastest transfer from Poland to Lithuania\n\nThe most efficient way — with payment and receipt of funds in cash, but it is not always available. The average transfer time from Poland to Lithuania is 1-2 hours. Although the transaction can be carried out faster, in 5-30 minutes, or longer, the next calendar day.\n\nThe slowest — to a bank account. In this case, the maximum translation time — up to 72 hours. Think about what benefits you will get in exchange for waiting.\n\nThe real exchange rate when making a money transfer Polish zloty to Euro for August 2024\n\nIt is 0.23443. All Partners of the Strumok comparison service, namely TransferGo, Wise, Paysend, Remitly, XE, WorldRemit, Profee, Instarem, CurrencyFair and other well-known money transfer operators compete for the client. Therefore, the difference in the applied exchange rates is sometimes minimal, however worth your attention. In addition to currency exchange commissions, the money transfer operator receives its income from the money transfer fee.\n\nTherefore, choose the maximum rate and transfer on the best terms for yourself."
