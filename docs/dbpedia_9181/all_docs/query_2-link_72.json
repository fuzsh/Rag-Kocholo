        "text": "United States (U.S.) currency is formatted with a decimal point (.) as a separator between the dollars and cents. Some countries use a comma (,) instead of a decimal to indicate that separation. In addition, while the U.S. and a number of other countries use a comma to separate thousands, some countries use a decimal point for this purpose.\n\nFor these reasons, itâ€™s critically important to recognize the differences in the placement of decimal points and commas in international currency. Failure to do so could result in the loss of significant amounts of money for Cornell.\n\nTo help staff members identify the formatting for currency, below is a list of countries and their respective currency formats. It is also important to note that most currencies utilize the format of threes and twos for dollars and cents (see the examples below), which means that the decimal or comma should be irrelevant, especially when the cents are shown. This is what staff members should look for when converting currencies.\n\nExamples:\n\n500 or 500,00 or 500.00 = five hundred dollars and no cents\n\n500,15 or 500.15 = five hundred dollars and fifteen cents\n\n500,150 or 500.150 or 500,150.00 or 500.150,00 = five hundred thousand, one hundred fifty dollars and no cents\n\nCountries Using a Decimal Point | Countries Using a Comma\n\nCountries Using a Decimal Point to Separate Dollars and Cents\n\nAustralia\n\nBotswana\n\nBritish West Indies\n\nBrunei\n\nCanada (English-speaking)\n\nDominican Republic\n\nGuatemala\n\nHong Kong\n\nIndia\n\nIreland\n\nIsrael\n\nJapan\n\nKenya\n\nKorea (both North and South)\n\nLebanon\n\nMalaysia\n\nMalta\n\nMexico\n\nNepal\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNicaragua\n\nNigeria\n\nPakistan\n\nPeople's Republic of China\n\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore\n\nSri Lanka\n\nSwitzerland (only when the amount is in Swiss francs)\n\nTaiwan\n\nTanzania\n\nThailand\n\nUganda\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States (including insular areas)\n\nZimbabwe\n\nCountries Using a Comma to Separate Dollars and Cents"
