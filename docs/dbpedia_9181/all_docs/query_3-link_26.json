        "text": "Key information about Polish złoty\n\nThe Polish złoty underwent a period of inflation in the 1990s, resulting in a redenomination of 10,000 to 1 in 1995. The first ever złoty banknotes were issued in 1794, prior to which gold coins were predominantly used as the country’s currency.\n\nThe Polish złoty currency code is PLN and its symbol is zł.\n\nAlthough Poland has been a member of the European Union since 2004, it doesn’t yet use the euro as an official currency — though the country is planning to do so soon.\n\nPolish złoty denominations\n\nThe Polish złoty is broken down into grosz (gr), with 1 zł being divided into 100 gr.\n\nThe złoty comes in the following banknotes:\n\n10 zł\n\n20 zł\n\n50 zł\n\n100 zł\n\n200 zł\n\n500 zł\n\nBanknotes come in different sizes, getting bigger in size as the value increases. They feature the portraits of various Polish rulers throughout history, including Mieszko I, the first ruler of Poland.\n\nPolish złoty coins come in the following denominations:\n\n1 gr\n\n2 gr\n\n5 gr\n\n10 gr\n\n20 gr\n\n50 gr\n\n1 zł\n\n2 zł\n\n5 zł"
