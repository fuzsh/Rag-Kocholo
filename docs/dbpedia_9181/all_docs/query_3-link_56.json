        "text": "Poland is a picturesque town famous for its medieval architecture, powdery-sand beaches and dense forests. However, it has become famous for its two cities: Warsaw and Krakow.\n\nMoreover, the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial & Museum is one of the most visited tourist sites due to its grim distinction of being the largest concentration camp during the Nazi period. In addition, Malbork Castle, located in Gdansk in Poland, is one of the world's largest castles.\n\nBefore you visit the country, check what currency is used in Poland to plan your finances. So read on and learn more about its official currency.\n\nHistory of the Polish Zloty\n\nZloty is the official currency of Poland and is known by PLN. It is Poland's legal tender and has a rich history like the country. 'Zloty' means 'golden' in Polish.\n\nTill the 10th century, denar was the tangible currency that remained in circulation. The coinage had a single face value and was primarily minted from bullion in this period. However, from 1300 to the 16th century, groat was in high demand, reducing the need for a national currency across Central Europe.\n\nHowever, zloty was used to refer to several foreign gold coins in the 14th and 15th centuries. Finally, in 1496, a domestic currency was introduced, and the Sejm Parliament approved Zloty.\n\nFurthermore, Zloty remained in circulation even after Partition of Poland. On 19th November 1915, the monetary system of Congress Poland law pegged it at 15 kopeks and 1, 2, 5 and 10 zlotych coins issued from 1816 to 1855.\n\nPolish marka, a currency equivalent to German papiermark, was introduced during WW1. However, the Ministry of Finance introduced the second Zloty in 1924, and it soon replaced marka.\n\nZloty began to stabilise in 1926. It was freely exchanged into gold and foreign currency up to 1933. After that, Poland introduced the third Zloty in 1950.\n\nIn 1990, the fall of Communism and hyperinflation caused redenomination of coins. Finally, in 1995, new coins and banknotes were released and featured Polish monarchs clothed in armour. In these coins, sovereigns are arranged chronologically based on the period of their reign.\n\nOn the other hand, the obverse features important objects or early coinage. Between 2013 and 2014, several additional features were added to the bank notes."
