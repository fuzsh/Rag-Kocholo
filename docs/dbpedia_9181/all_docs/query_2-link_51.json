        "text": "Depositing Domestic Checks and Cash Received in Over the Counter (OTC) Collections\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis chapter prescribes instructions for federal entities to deposit domestic checks and cash.\n\nSection 2010—Scope and Applicability\n\nThis guidance is being issued to ensure federal entities:\n\nMake timely deposits to fund the federal government,\n\nAdhere to proper procedures for making OTC deposits, and\n\nUse efficient collection solutions.\n\nSection 2015—Authority\n\n12 U.S.C 90, 265-266, 1767, 1789a, and 31 U.S.C 3301-3303, 3720.\n\nSection 2025—Policy\n\n2025.10—No-Cash or No-Check Guidance\n\nFederal entities may decide not to accept payments made in cash or by check. Before adopting a no-cash or a no-check policy, a federal entity should decide that the policy will be more beneficial than not to the operation of the program generating the payments. Factors that a federal entity must consider when making its determination include:\n\nFederal entity’s statutory and regulatory authorities,\n\nCosts and benefits associated with implementing the policy,\n\nProgrammatic or economic reasons for adopting the policy,\n\nEfficiencies to be gained by adopting the policy, and\n\nAnticipated impact of the policy on the federal entity’s constituents.\n\nIf, after examining these factors, a federal entity determines that it is more beneficial than not to adopt a no-cash or no-check policy, Fiscal Service considers such a decision to be consistent with Treasury’s move to an all-electronic Treasury, as well as the purposes of federal cash-management statutes.\n\n2025.20—Funds Received for Another Federal Entity\n\nIf a federal entity receives funds that must be deposited under another ALC, it must:\n\nDeposit the funds under its own ALC,\n\nClassify the transaction to its budget clearing account F3875, and\n\nIntra-Governmental Payment and Collection funds to the ALC for which the funds were deposited.\n\nSection 2030—Deposit Procedures\n\n2030.10—Deposit Reporting\n\nThe federal entity must prepare an OTCnet Deposit Ticket and itemize the deposit in OTCnet. The federal entity must provide the make-up of the deposit content (i.e., cash, coin, check) and print and forward the same to the financial institution along with the check or cash deposit. The deposit must reach the financial institution by its designated cut-off time. When creating an OTCnet Deposit Ticket, the federal entity must enter the voucher date as the date the deposit will reach the financial institution prior to the cutoff time. Federal entities can post date vouchers up to 5 days to allow for time if using couriers or mail-in TGA (MITGA). Entities must follow depositing frequencies per Section 2065- Frequency of Deposits.\n\nFederal entities should make copies or digital images of all checks. Copies/images should be safeguarded and retained based on the federal entity’s internal policies. Treasury recommends that federal entities retain these copies or images for up to 10 business days, which will enable federal entities to recreate deposits if checks are ever lost or stolen.\n\n2030.20—Designated FIs for TGA Deposits\n\nFederal entities must deposit funds at their designated financial institution. Federal entities must hand-deliver the deposits to their designated financial institution or hire a courier or armored car service to make scheduled deliveries. Except as provided in *Section 2040.30, deposits must not be mailed to a financial institution, nor will ACH or Fedwire deposit activity be accepted. Federal entities cannot make deposits at a Federal Reserve Bank.\n\n[Note: For ACH or Fedwire deposits, federal entities should refer to TFM Volume I, Part 5, Chapter 7500, “Fedwire and Automated Clearing House (ACH) Credit Deposits to the Account of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service”.]\n\nFederal entities must request permission from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank (FRB St. Louis) to establish or change their financial institution. See the Contacts section for more information.\n\nTo establish or change a financial institution, the following information will need to be provided to FRB St. Louis:\n\nName of the federal entity,\n\nOTCnet endpoint name,\n\nAgency location code (ALC),\n\nName, mailing address, phone number, and address of the local federal entity contact,\n\nName and location of the federal entity’s current financial institution,\n\nTime and way the federal entity makes deposits with the current financial institution,\n\nName and location of the proposed financial institution,\n\nName and phone number of a contact person at the proposed financial institution,\n\nTotal dollar amount deposited monthly,\n\nTotal number of checks deposited monthly,\n\nDollar amounts and number of Treasury checks deposited monthly,\n\nAmount of cash deposited monthly, and\n\nA brief justification statement.\n\nAfter the appropriate arrangements have been made, FRB St. Louis will notify the requesting federal entity that the setup is complete.\n\n[Note: The requested financial institution has 10 business days from the date of receipt of the federal entity profile sheet to respond to the request. Federal entities requesting a financial institution need to provide FRB St. Louis with a 30-day notice prior to the federal entity’s first deposit.]\n\n2030.30—Frequency of Deposits\n\nFederal entity depositors must limit deposits to one per day. Federal entities must make deposits for credit to the U.S. Treasury's account without delay following the procedures below:\n\nCoordinate processing schedules that allow deposits to reach the financial institution before that financial institution's designated cut-off time,\n\nFederal entities must deposit receipts totaling $5,000 or more on the same day received prior to depositary cutoff time. Deposits will be made as late as possible prior to the specified cutoff time to maximize daily deposit amounts. Collections totaling less than $5,000 may be accumulated and deposited when the total reaches $5,000. However, deposits must be made by Thursday of each week, regardless of the amount accumulated, and\n\nIf using Check Capture, the federal entity must scan checks daily even if the checks total less than $5,000.\n\n2030.40—Reporting Large Deposits\n\nFederal entities must report daily aggregate deposits (excluding Treasury checks) of $50 million or more to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s Cash Reporting Branch. See \"Cash Forecasting Requirements\" chapter atTFM Volume I, Part 6, Chapter 8500, section 8530, for instructions. However, federal entities must not accept any check written for more than $99,999,999.99, as the Federal Reserve banks will not process checks over that amount. See Federal Reserve Banks Operating Circular 3, “Collection of Cash Items and Returned Checks,” section 3.3.\n\n2030.50—Counterfeit Currency\n\nFinancial institutions must surrender to the Secret Service any suspected counterfeit currency deposited to Treasury's General Account. In such cases, the federal entity will receive from the financial institution a photocopy of the Secret Service Form 1604: Counterfeit Note Report, and/or any other documentation that accompanied the surrendered currency. At that point, the federal entity must contact the Secret Service to find out if the surrendered currency was determined to be counterfeit. The federal entity must ensure that the financial institution processes an OTCnet Deposit Ticket for surrendered currency that the Secret Service determines is not counterfeit. See the Contacts section for more information.\n\nSection 2035—Checks Received\n\n2035.10—Record of Checks Received\n\nIt is strongly encouraged to process checks received through OTCnet Check Capture or Mobile Check Capture. If using Check Capture, Federal entity depositors are not required to follow the procedure to keep records of checks as those checks received and delivered to a Treasury General Account (TGA) bank. For checks received and delivered to a TGA bank, Federal entity depositors must keep records of these checks, including the following information:\n\nAmount,\n\nName of the drawer,\n\nName of the person from whom received (if other than the drawer),\n\nBank on which drawn,\n\nDate drawn,\n\nCheck number (if cashier's check or similar item),\n\nChecking account symbol and serial number (if drawn on Treasury), and\n\nSerial number (if postal money order).\n\nIf a check is lost, mutilated, or destroyed, refer to the instructions in TFM Volume I, Part 5, Chapter 5000, Section 5035 (Uncollected, Lost, Destroyed, and Mutilated Checks).\n\n2035.20—Depositors' Endorsement on Checks Deposited at a Financial Institution\n\nDepositors' endorsements on checks deposited at financial institutions for credit to the Treasury's account must, at a minimum, include:\n\nThe agency location code (ALC), and\n\nThe words “For credit to the U.S. Treasury\".\n\nDepositors must show the same ALC as shown on the OTCnet Deposit Ticket in the endorsement on checks deposited at a financial institution.\n\nDepositors are not required to endorse checks processed through OTCnet Check Capture or Mobile Check Capture\n\nSection 2040—Collection Solutions\n\nFiscal Service is committed to maximizing electronic revenue collection options to ensure timely deposits to fund the federal government. Federal entities should utilize OTCnet Check Capture and/or Mobile Check Capture for all checks received. These solutions accelerate the deposit processing, and the deposit of funds into the Treasury’s account.\n\n2040.10—Check Capture\n\nFederal entities must process checks via OTCnet Check Capture or Mobile Check Capture. The following items cannot be processed through Check Capture:\n\nForeign items drawn on non-US financial institutions (i.e., foreign banks), and\n\nSavings Bonds.\n\n[Note: Since these items are not deposited at the federal entity’s financial institution, there is no need to endorse the back of the check.]\n\nDaily deposits must be received by 9:30 PM ET for next-day settlement.\n\nAfter being scanned, Treasury recommends retaining physical checks for up to 5 business days to ensure that there are no problems with file transmission, image quality, and processing of the checks. Checks should be safeguarded prior to destruction, and shredding is the method by which checks should be destroyed.\n\nSection 2040.20—Seized Currency Collection\n\nThe Seized Currency Collection Network (SCCN) provides a method for law enforcement federal entities to deposit funds that they receive from seizures. Federal entities can use the SCCN for depositing seized currency from criminal activities as follows:\n\nAgents must call the nearest cash vault customer service in advance to schedule a seized currency deposit count,\n\nSeized currency only accepts US cash, no US coins or foreign currency,\n\nSeized currency will be counted at a vendor vault only,\n\nLaw enforcement agents are allowed to bring firearms into vault facilities,\n\nAgents verify the count and sign the deposit slip after the count has been validated,\n\nFederal entities will be given customized pre-printed deposit slips,\n\nAny deposit discrepancies will be handled by the financial agent and forwarded to Treasury, and\n\nTreasury will oversee all meetings with federal entities regarding seized currency issues and concerns.\n\n2040.30—Mail-In Treasury General Account (MITGA)\n\nThe MITGA Program was developed to provide federal entities with an alternative to make TGA deposits when access to a local FI is unavailable. Federal entities that wish to use MITGA must contact FRB St. Louis to obtain an agency profile sheet, which must be filled out and returned to FRB St. Louis. The agency profile sheet is sent to the commercial bank administrator of the MITGA program. The MITGA commercial bank will send the federal entity instructions for sending deposits through the U.S. Postal Service. The federal entity will update its profile in OTCnet with the MITGA commercial bank’s routing and transit number and the account number. The federal entity will process a deposit in OTCnet and send the deposit to the MITGA commercial bank for confirmation.\n\nPostage, registration, and other expenses incurred in mailing deposits may not be deducted from the amount of the deposit.\n\nSection 2040.40—Emergency Procedures\n\nThe Contingency Mail-In Treasury General Account (CMITGA) program was developed to provide federal entities a temporary contingency solution to their standard OTCnet deposit reporting process. This contingency is used in the event the federal entity’s designated financial institution is temporarily unable to accept deposits for any reason, including (but not limited to) the following reasons:\n\nWill not open for business,\n\nWill be delayed in opening,\n\nWill have limited hours of operation, and\n\nIs affected by an environmental limitation that prevents the physical delivery of the federal deposits.\n\nContact the OTCnet Customer Service Team at 866-945-7920 and notify the customer service representative that your federal entity intends to use the CMITGA program. This notification will ensure that the federal entity is set up properly in the OTCnet application prior to mailing deposits to the CMITGA commercial bank for contingency purposes. Once the CMITGA commercial bank receives a mailed deposit from the federal entity, the CMITGA commercial bank will confirm it in OTCnet.\n\nAdditionally, when temporarily switching to the CMITGA process, the affected federal entity should email their federal entity location name, address and ALC to govlbxcustsvc@usbank.com.\n\nDetailed Contacts\n\nDirect inquiries concerning this chapter to:\n\nBureau of the Fiscal Service\n\nRevenue Collections Management\n\nOver the Counter Division (OTCD)\n\n3201 Pennsy Drive, Building E\n\nLandover, MD 20785\n\nEmail: TGAops@fiscal.treasury.gov\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nOTC Support Team Telephone: 866-771-1842\n\nEmail: stls.tga.support@stls.frb.org\n\nDirect inquiries concerning counterfeit currency to:\n\nSecret Service\n\nU.S. Currency\n\nDeposits For Credit to Treasury's General Account\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis chapter establishes procedures to be followed by the Depositaries located within the 50 United States and the District of Columbia (domestic Depositaries) when making deposits for credit to Treasury's General Account (TGA).\n\nSection 1010—Scope and Applicability\n\nThis chapter applies to Treasury's General Account Depositaries located within the 50 United States and the District of Columbia (domestic Depositaries) and others to whom specifically extended.\n\nSection 1025—Background\n\n1025.10—Use of Domestic Depositaries\n\nA TGA is maintained with an authorized Depositary to accelerate the collection and availability of funds to Treasury. Government officers who wish to deposit receipts with a domestic Depositary must make the necessary arrangements with the Banking Operations Branch (BOB). The Depositary may only accept deposits from Government agencies for credit to a TGA when specifically authorized to do so by BOB (see contacts page). In the event a Depositary is requested to accept a deposit from an unauthorized Government agency, the Depositary will notify BOB, and will advise the agency to refer to I TFM 5-4000 for the proper disposition of the deposit.\n\n1025.20—General Description of CA$H-LINK\n\nCA$H-LINK is a cash concentration system designed to concentrate funds and accounting details for deposits made by Federal agencies to TGAs maintained at designated Depositaries. The system consolidates agency accounting records at the Depositary level, performs data entry via a Financial Agent, and transfers the funds to the FRB through electronic funds transfer technology. Funds are transferred from the Depositaries directly to the Treasury's account at the FRB via the ACH system or wire transfers.\n\nThe Financial Agent collects accounting information from the Depositaries on a scheduled basis, prepares information to initiate funds transfers, and provides accounting details to the Fiscal Service. The accounting details of deposits reported by banks are reconciled by Fiscal Service with those reported by Federal agencies.\n\nCompensation for services provided by a domestic Depositary in operating a TGA will be in the form of an ACH credit to the Depositary's specified account, in the form of the imputed value of a noninterest bearing Treasury Time Balance (TTB) placed at the Depositary, and/or the imputed value of collected overnight balances maintained in the TGA (immediately available funds). The method of compensation will be at the discretion of Fiscal Service.\n\n1025.30—How to Become a Depositary\n\nA financial institution interested in obtaining TGA deposits may market its services to Federal agencies in its area. Treasury establishes a Depositary based upon the request of a Federal agency and evaluation of the efficiencies offered by such a relationship.\n\nTo be designated as a Depositary, the financial institution must meet the eligibility requirements of 31 CFR Part 202, be able to accept ACH debits (subsection 1030.50), agree to a written MOU with Fiscal Service, and be specifically authorized by Treasury to accept deposits.\n\nSection 1030—Operational Requirements\n\n1030.10—Deposit Proof Requirements\n\nThe Depositary will proof each deposit received by balancing the dollar amount printed on the face of the SF 215 with the sum of accompanying remittance items. The Depositary will correct any out-of-balance occurrence caused by the Federal agency in preparing the deposit by either preparing an additional SF 215 or SF 5515 to balance with the sum of the accompanying remittance items. Depositaries will not adjust the amount by changing the amount on the face of the SF 215 submitted by the Federal agency. See Supplement #2 to V TFM, the CA$H-LINK User Guide, for specific details on processing adjustments.\n\n1030.20—Crediting the Deposit\n\nEach deposit received by a Depositary from Government agencies for credit to Treasury will be credited in the TGA on the day of receipt if received prior to the cutoff time.\n\n1030.30—Depositary Reporting Requirements\n\nDepositaries will report deposit information according to instructions provided in Supplement #2 to V TFM, the CA$H-LINK User Guide. Deposits will be reported by either personal computer with modem interface, or by touch-tone telephone response to the Financial Agent. Treasury may determine the method of reporting for a Depositary.\n\n1030.40—Backup Processing Requirement\n\nIn some instances, the Financial Agent may be incapable of accepting deposits due to power failures or other unforeseen difficulties. Under these circumstances, Depositaries will transfer funds and accounting information according to Supplement #1 to V TFM: CA$H-LINK Operating Instructions for Domestic Treasury's General Account Depositary Banks, Section 11, Exception Processing. Depositaries affected by this requirement will be specifically designated and formally advised by Treasury. Liabilities in Section 1055 will apply for all Depositaries.\n\n1030.50—Funds Transfers\n\nTGA Depositaries are required to transfer the full amount of the deposit less debits in the TGA to the Treasury on the business day following the Federal agency deposit. Depositaries failing to so transfer will be liable for the imputed value of these funds in accordance with Section 1055. Depositaries will monitor the TGA on a daily basis for the correctness of the funds transfers. A Depositary is compensated for the imputed value of Uncollected Funds transferred to Treasury as described in subsection 1055.10. Funds will be transferred from the Depositary to Treasury via ACH debits or wire transfers.\n\nACH Debits - For Depositaries that complete their deposit reports prior to 8:00 p.m., eastern time, on the day of deposit, the Financial Agent will prepare, in ACH format, requests to debit the Depositaries' accounts or their correspondents' accounts, and credit the Treasury's account at the Richmond FRB. The Depositaries' accounts will be debited and Treasury's account credited on the next business day by the Richmond FRB.\n\nAll Depositaries, except those specifically exempted, will report through the CA$H-LINK system prior to the ACH cutoff on the day of Federal agency deposit. Any Depositary that can show a legitimate need to be authorized to report after the ACH cutoff will request and receive a written Late Call-in Authorization from BOB (see Contacts page). The request will include appropriate justification and documentation so that an evaluation can be completed in an efficient manner. BOB will notify Depositaries in writing of the disposition of their requests for Late Call-in Authorization.\n\nIn all cases, the deposit report to the Financial Agent must occur no later than 1:00 p.m., eastern time, on the business day following the day of deposit. All Depositaries that have been granted written Late Call-in Authorizations will wire transfer TGA funds to the New York FRB immediately upon receipt of the 1031 Wire Request. The funds transfer message will reference the acceptance number given by the CA$H-LINK system.\n\nWire Transfers - For Depositaries that complete their deposit reports after the 8:00 p.m., eastern time ACH cutoff, but before the wire cutoff time, the Financial Agent will collect the information necessary to prepare a 1031 Wire Request. The cutoff for completing a deposit report for which funds will be transferred by wire is 1:00 p.m., eastern time, on the business day following the day of deposit.\n\nTo improve Treasury's cash management position, if operationally feasible, Depositaries will make their deposit report to the Financial Agent by 9:30 a.m., eastern time, on the business day following the day of deposit. The Financial Agent will send the 1031 Wire Request directing the Depositary to transfer the funds by wire to the New York FRB. Depositaries will act on the 1031 Wire Request by preparing and sending a responding wire transfer no later than 1 hour after receipt of the request for funds. All wire transfers will be formatted as specified by the FRB and received at Treasury's account with the New York FRB, by 2:00 p.m., eastern time, on the business day following the day of deposit.\n\nMultiple Accounts Per CA$HLINK Account Key - Although a Depositary may utilize more than one account to facilitate the processing and reconciliation of TGA deposits into a single CA$H-LINK Account Key, the CA$H-LINK Deposit Report consolidating those deposits will result in Treasury debiting only one account. Depositaries requiring Treasury debit more than one account will request written authorization from BOB. BOB will notify Depositaries in writing of the disposition of their requests.\n\nReturned ACH Debits - If Treasury receives a dishonored ACH debit request, BOB will contact the Depositary to determine the reason the request was dishonored and instruct the Depositary to wire transfer the funds to Treasury's account at the New York FRB. Treasury reserves the right to charge the Depositary for the cost of the wire transfer when an ACH debit has been refused.\n\n1030.60—Deferred Account Requirements\n\nDeferred Accounts - In specific cases, at Treasury's sole discretion, Treasury will give written authorization to Depositaries to defer the transfer of Uncollected Funds. Supplement #1 to V TFM, CA$H-LINK Operating Instructions for Domestic Treasury's General Account Depositary Banks and Supplement #2, the CA$H-LINK User Guide, specify the procedures to be followed when processing a deferred account.\n\nDescription of the Automated Deferred Accounting Process - Each deferred Depositary will record the deposit report deferred information and report it to CA$HLINK via the deposit reporting system screen. Each deferred report will be processed through an edit routine to ensure that the report is accurate. The CA$H-LINK system will track any funds not transferred.\n\n1030.70—Returned Item Requirements\n\nThe Depositary may debit the current day's deposit for the amount of checks dishonored and returned unpaid. The procedures specified in Supplement #1 to V TFM, CA$H-LINK Operating Instructions for Domestic Treasury's General Account Depositary Banks, provide the details for processing such an adjustment.\n\nSection 1035—Compensation\n\n1035.10—Eligibility for Compensation\n\nDuring negotiations between Treasury and a financial institution regarding the establishment of a TGA, the subject of compensation will be addressed. If a financial institution requires compensation, it will formally advise Treasury during the negotiations. Alterations in the amount of compensation subsequent to the establishment of a TGA will be based on the results of an analysis of the information provided in accordance with subsection 1035.50.\n\n1035.20—Product Categories and Standard Item Rates\n\nBOB will provide a schedule of income and recognized expense categories (to be recognized for purposes of compensation). For each category, a per-category item rate will be provided and made a part of the MOU between Treasury and the Depositary, in accordance with Supplement #1 to V TFM.\n\nSuch categories and per-category item rates will remain in effect until superseded. Treasury will revise these rates periodically.\n\n1035.30—Sources of Income\n\nDepositaries may be compensated for services provided to the Treasury by means of ACH credits, the imputed value of TTBs, and/or the imputed value of collected overnight balances maintained in the TGA (Immediately Available Funds). The method of compensation is at the sole discretion of Treasury.\n\nACH Credits - Treasury may compensate the Depositary by means of an ACH credit for the recognized services provided. The amount of the credit is determined by the volume of recognized expenses, based on the applicable per category item rates, less the imputed value of any Immediately Available Funds of the delayed transfer of funds. Treasury will compensate the Depositary on a monthly basis.\n\nImputed Value of a Treasury Time Balance - Treasury may compensate the Depositary by maintaining a balance in a time deposit entitled ''U.S. Treasury Time Deposit - Open Account'' at the Depositary. The amount to be maintained in the time account will be determined by Treasury by the projected volumes of recognized expenses, which are based on the applicable per-category item rates, less the projected imputed value of any Immediately Available Funds or the delayed transfer of funds. The balance will be adjusted or removed at the sole discretion of Treasury. At all times, TTBs are subject to withdrawal by the Treasury. When feasible and when in the Government's best interest, Treasury will provide the Depositary with written notice of its intent to withdraw the TTB and will not ordinarily withdraw the TTB until the expiration of 14 calendar days after the date of the written notice. However, nothing will preclude Treasury from withdrawing TTBs without notice to the Depositary. Treasury will not be liable for any costs realized by the Depositary in the event of a TTB withdrawal.\n\nAs provided in subsection 1035.60, Depositaries will pledge collateral security for the entire TTB in advance of any TTB being placed at those Depositaries.\n\nImputed Value of Collected Overnight Balances (Immediately Available Funds) maintained in the TGA - As partial or complete compensation for the services provided by the Depositary in operating the TGA, Treasury will calculate the imputed value of the Immediately Available Funds in the TGA.\n\n1035.40—Analysis Earnings Rate (AER)\n\nThe imputed value of TTBs and Treasury's General Accounts are calculated using the AER, which is the 3-month Treasury Bill Auction average (investment) rate. Such computations occur on a monthly basis by using the following calculations:\n\nTreasury Time Balances (TTBs)\n\nTGA Average Daily Collected Balance (Immediately Available Funds)\n\nTGA Average Daily Uncollected Balance (Uncollected Funds)\n\nAverage Daily Uncollected Balance\n\n(multiplied by)\n\n(equals)\n\nAER Factor\n\nImputed Value of\n\nTGA Average\n\nDaily Uncollected\n\nBalance\n\nAverage Daily Immediately Available Funds is calculated as follows:\n\nAverage Daily Uncollected Funds is calculated as follows:\n\nStep 1\n\nStep 2\n\nStep 3:\n\nSubtotal +\n\nfor Step 1\n\nSubtotal =\n\nfor Step 2\n\nTotal\n\n1035.50—Income and Expense Reporting\n\nDepositaries will report recognized income and expenses on a monthly basis to Treasury in order to receive compensation using the procedures in V TFM, supplements and bulletins thereto, and any amendments to any of the foregoing.\n\n1035.60—Collateral Requirement\n\nDepositaries will pledge collateral security in accordance with Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 202, to secure all public funds maintained with the Depositary, including Immediately Available Funds in excess of recognized insurance coverage, as determined by the Treasury. In addition, Depositaries will pledge collateral security in the amount of any Treasury Time Balance placed with the Depositary, in advance of such placement.\n\n1035.70—Excess Earnings/Deficient Earnings\n\nExcess earnings occur when a Depositary's income earnings as defined in V TFM, any supplements or bulletins thereto, and any amendments to any of the foregoing, are greater than its recognized expenses. Deficient earnings occur when a Depositary's income earnings are less than its recognized expenses.\n\nThe Depositary will be liable to Treasury for all excess earnings, and will return such to Treasury when requested. Treasury will determine in its sole discretion the method by which the Depositary will make Treasury whole. Treasury's methods include, but are not limited to:\n\nA direct payment to the Treasury's General Account at the New York FRB, and\n\nOffsetting past or future cumulative losses in the form of deficient earnings and/or the imputed value of funds.\n\nSimilarly, Treasury will be liable to the Depositary for deficient earnings, and will in its sole discretion determine the method by which it will make the Depositary whole. Treasury's methods include, but are not limited to:\n\nAdjustments to the TTB,\n\nACH credits, and\n\nOffsetting past or future cumulative gains in the form of excess earnings and/or the imputed value of funds delayed.\n\nSection 1040—Forms\n\n1040.10—Standard Form 215: Deposit Ticket (SF 215)\n\nDeposits made with Depositaries for credit to a TGA will be submitted with the prescribed SF 215.\n\nPreparation - The SF 215 will be prepared by the depositor who will enter the date the deposit is presented to the Depositary. Instructions for completing the SF 215 are printed on the reverse side of the form. The date of credit (confirmed date) that the Depositary has inserted on the SF 215 and the Date of Deposit provided to the Financial Agent by the receiving TGA Depositary should always be the same. Depositaries may also be required to prepare the SF 215 in complying with the Deposit Proof Requirements (subsection 1030.10).\n\nAcknowledgement of Receipt - The Depositary will date and sign the original and all copies of the SF 215, certifying that the deposit has been received for credit to the TGA. This signature will be in one of the following forms: (1) a handwritten signature of an authorized officer or employee, followed by the title of the officer or employee, followed by the title of the officer or employee; or (2) a rubber-stamp impression showing the name of the Depositary, supported by the handwritten initials of the receiving authorized officer or employee, followed by the title; or (3) a facsimile or rubber stamp impression of the signature of an authorized officer or employee placed over the officer or employee's official title, supported by the handwritten initials of the officer or employee. All initials or signatures will be in ink.\n\nDisposition of Original and Copies - The Depositary will retain the original of each SF 215. Copies of the SF 215 will be distributed according to the instructions printed on each copy. The Depositary will not forward any copies of the SF 215 to the FRB or Treasury.\n\nCopies of SF 215 - The Depositary will furnish copies of a processed SF 215, upon request, to a Government agency or Treasury even after the TGA is closed. When a copy is provided, the Depositary will plainly stamp \"COPY\" across the face of the SF 215.\n\n1040.20—Standard Form 5515: Debit Voucher (SF 5515) and Counterfeit Currency Procedures\n\nThe Depositary will prepare an SF 5515 to reduce the balance in the TGA as a result of a correction to a deposit (subsection 1030.10) or to process a returned check. The Depositary will handle any check that is not paid for any reason by the bank on which it is drawn according to the procedures described in V TFM, any supplements or bulletins thereto, and any amendments to any of the foregoing.\n\nPreparation and Use of an SF 5515 - When an unpaid check is returned to the Depositary or when a check is lost by the Depositary prior to microfilming and/or forwarding for collection, the Depositary shall immediately (1) prepare and execute an SF 5515 and (2) charge the amount of the unpaid item to the TGA (subsection 1030.70).\n\nDepositaries will not add or charge depositing agencies or the Treasury for any service charges, returned check charges, non-sufficient funds charges, or any other non-recognized charges or expenses, on the SF 5515 or otherwise. Endorsements on the reverse of checks deposited will include the depositor's Agency Location Code (ALC) in the top 1 1/2 inches on the check. Depositaries will then prepare an SF 5515 from the information furnished on uncollectible checks without referring to the related SF 215. If the depositor's ALC or address is unreadable, or if the check has been lost, the Depositary will refer to the related SF 215 to obtain this information. As finding an SF 215 may be time consuming, Depositaries are permitted to compile a list of regular depositing agencies showing their respective ALCs and addresses.\n\nDepositaries will retain a record of the drawer, drawee bank, and the amount of each unpaid check. The original of the SF 5515 shall support the charge to the TGA and shall be retained by the Depositary. All unpaid checks will be delivered or forwarded to by Depositaries to the depositing agency, together with the memorandum and confirmed copies of the SF 5515. If an unpaid check is not recovered by a Depositary, a notification to the depositing agency citing the reason the check was not returned will accompany the copies of the SF 5515.\n\nCharging Returned Items to the Treasury's General Account - The TGA will be charged with the total amount of the unpaid items recorded on the SF 5515. No service charges, returned check charges, non-sufficient funds charges, or any other non-recognized charges or expenses will be added or charged to the depositing agency on the SF 5515. At the close of business of the same day, the Depositary will distribute all copies of the SF 5515 according to the instructions printed on each copy.\n\nHandling of Excess Returned Items - If a Depositary has an SF 5515 that cannot be fully offset by the deposits in the TGA without causing an overdraft in that account, the Depositary will not charge the total amount on the SF 5515 to the TGA on the Depositary's books, unless the procedure stated in subsection 1040.30 is followed. The Depositary will contact BOB for authorization to send the SF 5515 directly to the local FRB with instructions to charge the TGA at that FRB and credit the Depositary's reserve account or the reserve account of the Depositary's correspondent for the total amount on the SF 5515. If BOB authorizes the above procedure, Treasury will notify the FRB to accept and process the transaction submitted by the Depositary as an exception item.\n\nCharging Returned Items After the TGA Has Been Closed - If a Depositary receives a returned item after its TGA has been officially closed by Treasury, the Depositary will contact BOB for written authorization to send the SF 5515 directly to the local FRB. The SF 5515 will be accompanied by instructions to charge the TGA at that FRB and credit the Depositary's reserve account or the reserve account of the Depositary's correspondent for the total amount on the SF 5515. After the Depositary has received BOB's written authorization, the Depositary will prepare the SF 5515 as instructed above. The original of the SF 5515 will be forwarded to the FRB with notification that Treasury has approved the transaction, and the returned item (unpaid check) will be forwarded to the depositing agency, together with the memorandum and confirmed copies of the SF 5515. If BOB authorizes the above transaction in writing, Treasury will notify the FRB to accept and process the transaction submitted by the Depositary as an exception item. If Treasury does not authorize the above procedure in writing, no charge to the TGA at the FRB will be permitted.\n\nCounterfeit Currency - A debit voucher (SF 5515) will be processed for the amount of suspected counterfeit currency deposited to TGA. Depositaries will surrender the suspected counterfeit currency to the Secret Service. On the debit voucher, Depositaries will reference the SF 215 used to deposit the surrendered currency to the TGA. Depositaries will also provide the depositor with a photocopy of the Secret Service Form 1604: Counterfeit Note Report, that accompanied the surrendered currency to the Secret Service. An SF 215 accomplishing the reversal action will be processed for the amount of surrendered currency that the Secret Service subsequently determines is not counterfeit.\n\n1040.30—Special Arrangement Between Depositary and Depositing Agency\n\nUpon written approval from depositing agencies, Depositaries may defer charging the TGA for returned items by having uncollectible checks automatically reprocessed for collection, returned to the depositing agency to be presented again, or replaced by new checks. Under this arrangement, SF 5515s will not be prepared to charge the account unless the checks are not collected or replaced within an agreed period of time. A Depositary will not use such an arrangement prior to obtaining written approval from a depositing agency. If such written approval is granted, it is limited to deposits from the approving agency only.\n\n1040.40—Forms Requisition\n\nSee \"Contacts\" page for forms ordering instructions.\n\nSection 1045—Document Retention\n\nTGA Depositaries will retain original copies of each of the following documents for 6 years and 6 months from the date of origin of the completed document, regardless of whether the TGA is subsequently closed. At the end of the 6-year and 6-month retention period, the Depositary may destroy the documents. The documents will be maintained in either paper or microfilm or microfiche form. Depositaries will not add or charge either the Treasury or any depositing agency for any service charges, copying charges, researching charges, or any other charges for requesting photocopies, or any information regarding retained documents either before or after the TGA is closed. Depositaries will retain the following documents for the above period of time:\n\nSF 215, SF 215A, and SF 215B,\n\nSF 5515,\n\nTrace Numbers from CA$HLINK Deposit Reports, and\n\nStatements of Account Activity (SAAs).\n\nTGA Depositaries which cannot produce copies of any of the above documents upon a request by Treasury or a depositing agency within 30 days will be liable for any amount(s) owed to the Government, as calculated by Treasury.\n\nSection 1050—Resolving Differences\n\nThe receiving Depositary will provide for accounting detail movement to Treasury via a telecommunications network and truncate the flow of all paper documents in the system. The Depositary will retain the original copies of source documents. When there is a difference between agency and Depositary reporting of deposits, the agency will contact the Depositary. Depositaries will cooperate with agencies in resolving differences in reporting deposits for credit to the TGA at the earliest practical date. Failure to cooperate in resolving differences may result in termination of the TGA.\n\nSection 1055—Value of Funds\n\nThe party holding TGA funds longer than permitted will be responsible for the value of those funds. If a Depositary holds funds that were required to be transferred to the Treasury, the Depositary will be liable to Treasury for the imputed value of the funds erroneously held. Conversely, if the Depositary transfers funds in excess of the proper amount, Treasury will be liable to the Depositary for the imputed value of funds erroneously transferred. These liabilities automatically apply without regard to fault.\n\nTreasury will in its sole discretion determine the appropriate manner in which to adjust the party-who-lost value under these circumstances. Value will generally be computed as stated in this section.\n\nTreasury may collect the imputed value of any delayed funds by methods including, but not limited to, increasing the Depositary's income on the periodic income and expense analysis by the imputed value of the amount delayed, or by direct billing to the Depositary for such value, or by liquidating any collateral pledged by the Depositary. Direct billing may take the form of an ACH debit against the Depositary. By accepting deposits from Government agencies, the Depositary is deemed to authorize Treasury to collect the imputed value of delayed funds by charging through the FRB either the reserve account of the Depositary or its correspondent. Imputed value of funds delayed is computed on the average of the daily Federal Funds Rates for the period for which the funds were delayed.\n\n1055.10—Uncollected Funds Transferred to Treasury\n\nTreasury will reimburse eligible Depositaries for the imputed value of Uncollected Funds transferred to Treasury, based upon periodic review of the deposit activity and analysis of the TGA's income (as defined in V TFM, any supplements or bulletins thereto, and any amendments to any of the foregoing) and recognized expenses. The imputed value of Uncollected Funds is computed as provided in V TFM, any supplements or bulletins, and any amendments to any of the foregoing.\n\n1055.20—Depositary Transfer Delays\n\nIf a Depositary does not comply with reporting requirements or delays the transfer of funds from the Depositary to Treasury for any reason, the Depositary will be liable for the imputed value of funds delayed. The imputed value of such funds is calculated utilizing the Federal Funds Rate.\n\nSection 1060—Processing Treasury Checks\n\nDepositaries will clear all checks received in deposit from Federal agencies via its normal banking arrangements. The Depositary will not reduce the amount of the net transfer to the FRB by the amount of Treasury checks received in the TGA deposit.\n\nDetailed Contacts\n\nForms prescribed in this chapter can be obtained from:\n\nSupply and Property Management Branch\n\nDivision of Facilities Management\n\nBureau of the Fiscal Service\n\n3361-L 75th Avenue\n\nArdmore East Business Center\n\nLandover, MD 20785\n\n301-344-8577\n\n301-344-8583\n\nDirect inquiries regarding this chapter to:\n\nDepartment of the Treasury\n\nBureau of the Fiscal Service\n\nOver the Counter Division\n\n3201 Pennsy Drive, Building E\n\nLandover, MD 20785\n\n202-874-6893"
