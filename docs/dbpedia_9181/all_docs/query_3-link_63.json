        "text": "What is the currency in Poland?\n\nThe official currency in Poland is the Polish Złoty, which is issued and overseen by the National Bank of Poland. If you’re buying your travel money online you may also see the official code being shown - PLN. In stores and restaurants, Polish Złoty prices are likely to use the currency symbol zł.\n\nOnce you’re in Poland you’ll see costs of items shown in PLN and you’ll need to start paying for things in local coins and notes which are often found in the following denominations:\n\nbanknotes - 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 PLN and coins - 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 grosz; 1, 2, 5 PLN.\n\nCan you officially pay in AUD when you are in Poland?\n\nYou’re unlikely to be able to officially transact in AUD in Poland, which is why it’s time to start getting used to PLN and learning more about the currency exchange rates so you’ll know what you’re spending on your trip.\n\nThis guide will walk through all you need to know, including US dollar/Polish Złoty rates and where best to get your travel money from.\n\nPolish ZłotyCurrency namePolish ZłotyISO codePLNSymbolzłSubunitGroszCentral BankNational Bank of PolandBest travel cards to take to PolandWise\n\nPLN coins and banknotes\n\nHere’s a full rundown of the PLN coins and banknotes you’ll need to be familiar with when you’re in Poland.\n\nPLN banknotesPLN coinsbanknotes - 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 PLNcoins - 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 grosz; 1, 2, 5 PLN\n\nHistory of Polish Złoty currency\n\nThe Polish Zloty (PLN), meaning 'golden', was introduced in the Middle Ages. Post-World War II, hyperinflation hit Poland, leading to a new zloty in 1950. Another redenomination in 1995 replaced the old zloty at a rate of 10,000 old for 1 new zloty, as a countermeasure to inflation and to stabilize the economy.\n\nIs AUD accepted in Poland?\n\nAs we’ve seen, the official currency in Poland is PLN. If you carry AUD with you on your trip, you’ll probably need to exchange it before you can spend.\n\nSometimes when you’re away on a trip abroad you’ll find that merchants will take payments in a selection of major foreign currencies. However, the chances are that where this is offered, you won’t get a good exchange rate for your AUD. Planning smart and convenient ways to spend in PLN when you’re away is likely to mean you save on costs in the end.\n\nUsually, having a few different ways to pay and get cash is the best option for travelers and tourists. That’s because you’ll have a back up plan in case one payment method isn’t accepted for any reason, and you can pick the method that’s best suited to the specific transaction. Having a multi-currency card from a provider like Wise, plus your normal bank debit card, and some local cash in PLN should mean you’ve always got options. You can use your cash for small purchases and tipping, and make low cost payments and cash withdrawals with your multi-currency card, while keeping your bank card in reserve for emergencies.\n\nUse a travel card on your next trip to Poland\n\nUsing a travel debit card in Poland is usually cheap, safe and convenient. A few providers in Australia offer multi-currency cards which come with a linked payment account that lets you convert, hold and spend in PLN. That allows you to add a balance in AUD and switch over to PLN to lock in the exchange rate and set your travel budget.\n\nOnce you have PLN in your account there are no extra fees to make payments, and you’ll not have foreign transaction charges to worry about, either.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of a couple of handy travel debit cards you may want to order and use in Poland.\n\nWhat is the currency exchange rate for A$ 1 AUD/PLN?\n\nIt’s helpful to get to know the live AUD/PLN rate so you can easily calculate how much things are costing you while you’re on your trip abroad. The rate you need to focus on is the mid market rate, which is the one banks and major currency services get when buying and selling currencies. This rate isn’t always passed on to customers. Instead you may find that the AUD/PLN rate you get when exchanging travel cash includes a markup - an extra fee.\n\nFind the AUD/PLN mid-market rate from a currency conversion site or a website like this, so you can keep an eye on the market and compare the rates you’re offered as you travel against the mid-market rate easily. Right now, the mid-market rate for 1 Australian Dollar to PLN is 0.60734.\n\nShould I exchange AUD to PLN before traveling to Poland?\n\nIt’s a good idea to exchange AUD to PLN before you head off to Poland, as you can often find a better exchange rate and lower overall costs before you travel.\n\nWhen you’re in Poland you’re going to need PLN in cash for some of your spending - particularly when tipping or making smaller value purchases. Buying your PLN travel money in advance can get you better AUD/PLN exchange rates, and saves you wasting precious time shopping around for a good deal once you arrive in Poland.\n\nTips for exchanging money in Poland\n\nCards are widely accepted in Poland, but you’ll still need to watch the exchange rate given when making a transaction from AUD to PLN. Some merchants offer to let you pay in AUD instead of PLN, but this will usually mean paying more because of dynamic currency conversion costs.\n\nBest place to exchange currency in Poland\n\nYou can get your PLN in Poland in a couple of ways.\n\nYou’ll be able to use a travel debit card from a provider like Wise to make convenient payments and cash withdrawals and to convert funds online.\n\nOr if you prefer an offline solution you can carry some cash in AUD to exchange when you arrive. Currency exchange providers are often in airports and hotels, although the exchange shops in a city center are likely to be cheaper overall.\n\nHow to pay in Poland?\n\nYou’ll need to have PLN to spend in Poland. However, generally having a few different payment methods is a good plan. That means that if a merchant won't accept one, you’ve got a back up. It’s also reassuring to know you have a different way to pay if you were unlucky enough to have a card or some travel cash stolen. Here are your key payment options in Poland.\n\n1. Debit or credit card\n\nCard payments can be helpful in shops, restaurants and hotels but there will be places where cash is also important. Order a travel card from a provider like Wise for cheap and fast transactions, including card payments and cash withdrawals as and when you need travel money in PLN.\n\n2. PLN cash\n\nCash is widely used in Poland, so it’s worth having some with you at all times. You may want to exchange money to PLN before you leave, but it’s also usually convenient to make ATM withdrawals locally once you arrive in Poland.\n\nYou’ll usually find you can use a card to make payments in Poland, but carrying some cash in PLN is also reassuring. It’s often easier for tipping and making smaller purchases, plus you’ve got a nice backup if your card is ever out of action for some reason.\n\nIt’s a smart idea to have both a card and some cash in PLN when you’re in Poland. Some merchants will prefer cash, but having a card for higher value payments and in busier more tourist places is also convenient. Consider using a travel card from a provider like Wise or Revolut alongside your cash for flexibility.\n\nPaying for the trip in AUD\n\nIf you’re paying for things in Poland with a AUD bank card you might find a foreign transaction fee is added. This pushes up your costs when you spend in a foreign currency, and can be tricky to calculate.\n\nTravel debit cards don’t always work this way. When you make purchases in Poland using the Wise card you can either choose to convert your account balance to PLN in advance in the Wise app, or just leave your balance in AUD and let the card handle the transaction when you pay. You’ll always get the lowest available fee and there are no extra foreign transaction charges.\n\nConclusion - Currency in Poland\n\nYou won’t be able to pay in AUD when you visit Poland - so learning about the currency you need is essential. Whether you decide to use a travel debit card from a service like Wise , or stock up on PLN in cash in advance, knowing the mid-market exchange rate can help you get the best available deal. Use this guide to learn all you need to know about the options, rates and fees for exchanging AUD to PLN, and make your money go further while you’re away.\n\nThe official currency in Poland is PLN. You can’t usually pay in AUD in Poland, so you’ll need to plan in advance to get your travel money sorted. Consider ordering a travel debit card from a service like Wise, for low cost conversions to PLN and convenient spending and withdrawals - and remember that knowing the AUD to PLN mid-market exchange rate is essential to check you’re getting a fair deal on currency exchange.\n\nFAQ - Currency in Poland\n\nWhat is the currency in Poland called?\n\nThe official currency in Poland is the Polish Złoty.
