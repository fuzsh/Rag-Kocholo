Fantastic/mythical elements are the one group of more than ten groups of the motives in creating coats of arms nowadays. The fusion of two animals or one animal and one plant etc. into one fantastic being is praiseworthy in the contemporary Lithuanian heraldry when it is decided to create civic coat of arms using fantastic elements. The idea of using fantastic creatures in the heraldry of Lithuania persists almost six centuries but the ways how these fruits of human imagination came to the various coats of arms are different. Historical, political and cultural context shaped the function and meaning of such heraldry over the years making interesting stories.\n\nTHE FIRST PATRONS OF VILNIUS FRIARS MINOR CONVENTUAL: A STUDY OF THE 1522 CHARTER OF KING SIGISMUND THE OLD Darius Baronas Summary On December 3, 1522, king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania Sigismund the Old issued a charter whereby... more\n\nTHE FIRST PATRONS OF VILNIUS FRIARS MINOR CONVENTUAL: A STUDY OF THE 1522 CHARTER OF KING SIGISMUND THE OLD\n\nDarius Baronas\n\nSummary\n\nOn December 3, 1522, king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania Sigismund the Old issued a charter whereby he confirmed all donations and emoluments granted by his predecessors, by magnates, boyars and townspeople to the Franciscans of Vilnius established there in about 1387. The documents were brought to the royal attention by guardian George of Cracow who asserted that he managed to collect only 54 ones, while the rest must have perished due to the lack of care on the part of his own predecessros. Fortunately, the guardian was not quite right as no less than 27 pertinent documents do survive to this day. The analysis of all of them (81) allowed us to break down the patrons into such groups as grand dukes 4 (4,9%), magnates 15 (18,5%), boyars 55 (67,9%) and townspeople 7 (8,6%). It was then possible to establish what kind of relations and by what families were maintained between the lay people and friars. It has turned out that the grand dukes and magnates provided only grants and did this up to the mid-15th century, while the townspeople and boyars displayed a more variegated pattern of relations ranging from grants to sales for real price to sales below the real value. The most intense relations between the friars and the boyars started sometime from the mid-15th century onward, and this correlates well with the advancement of boyars as founders and patrons of churches and other charitable activities. The 1522 charter contains information relevant to the establishment of this mother-house of the Lithuanian Franciscans and its subsequent rise to prominence. It also displays data valuable in terms of historical geography and persons involved. The reason for the making of this charter itself is to be viewed in the attempts of the Franciscans to safeguard their holdings around the manor of Kena and inside Vilnius by having them declared to be exempt from secular authorities and placed under the regime of ecclesiastical immunity. This concern was timely enough as the movement of Protestant Reformation was gathering pace in German lands and was beginning to be felt in this part of Europe too.\n\nAppendix 1 contains a critical edition of this hitherto unpublished charter. Its original is kept at Cracow, in Biblioteka Naukowa PAU i PAN – Ms. 481.\n\nThe scientific research on the history of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the Jagiellonian era, being conducted nowadays in the Polish scientific community as well as among foreign historians, does not place particular emphasis on the... more\n\nThe scientific research on the history of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the Jagiellonian era, being conducted nowadays in the Polish scientific community as well as among foreign historians, does not place particular emphasis on the economic history of this country.\n\nIt is evident that the scientists have not been particularly interested in the very important issue of the use of the aquatic resources in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and their impact on the economic activity conducted there in the Jagiellonian era by the representatives of the dynasty and other private landowners. This lack of interest was brought to my attention while I was studying the administration and exploitation of the forest resources of Lithuania. It identified the need of addressing this issue, especially with regard to the increasing scientific enquiries leading to recognizing and understanding the mutual influence of humans and environment.\n\nThis paper is devoted to one of the aspects of exploiting the aquatic resources of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 16th century, which is the development of the legal, administrative, ownership, economic and technical conditions in which the rivers and lakes owned by the Grand Duchy in the western Grodno region have been used for fishery in strict relation to the resources of this geographical environment.\n\nAmong the issues that constitute the discussed scientific achievement, arranged according to the chronology-issue system was the characteristics of the political and administrative development of the territory of the western Grodno region from the late 14th century almost to the close of the 16th century. The dissertation also presented the administrative foundations of the emerging Grodno county. The starting point for further analysis was to attempt to reconstruct the geographical environment of the western Grodno region for the period of the Middle Ages and the early Modern Era in relation to its various elements. I took it as an important issue, because of the crucial impact of the natural conditions of the region on the development of its economic potential, also in terms of exploitation of aquatic resources, which have been of our interest.\n\nAutor characterized the legal regulations regarding the exploitation of aquatic resources in the royal lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 15th and 16th centuries one by one, since the whole system of this exploitation was based on them. Also discussed the important matters related to the development of the ownership structure of the aquatic resources of the western Grodno region in the private properties of nobility, Lithuanian boyars and most importantly in the Grand-Ducal lands until the end of the 16th century.\n\nIt has been particularly significant for the subject matter of the dissertation to present the forms of management of the standing and running waters used in the Grand-Ducal lands of the western Grodno region. In the dissertation shown their evolutionary nature – transitions from the management, through territorial administration officials to qualified niewodniczy (fishery official). Reconstructed the composition of the territorial administration officials group along with the other Grand-Ducal subjects connected with the exploitation of the aquatic resources. Such reconstruction has been undertaken for the first time in historiography.\n\nThe reconstruction of the organisation of the aquatic resources exploitation is a separate, important issue which has been raised. The dissertation concentrated mainly on the role of niewodnictwa, as the administrative-economic structures created for their intense exploitation, catering for the needs of the grand dukes of Lithuania.\n\nAn important part of the discussion was the characterization of the tools to catch fish, closely related to the forms of fishing used at that time. In the dissertation discussed the composition of the fish fauna of the waters of western Grodno region on the basis of the sources until the end of the 16th century, referring to comparisons to its state in the twenties and thirties of the 20th century and its state now. The last problem was to introduce the fish farming of the region, supplementing fishing in the natural waters and to outline the impact of the development of milling on the state of aquatic resources of the region in the light of the selected sources of the 15th and 16thcenturies.\n\nAn indispensable complement of the dissertation was the cartographic representation of the analysed area in terms of the contemporary hydrographic structure and the hydrographic structure of the 16th century – reconstructed in the studies on the basis of original maps which were analysed in terms of content, using the sources.\n\nThe article examines the political relations between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, especially Žemaitija as a constituent part, and Žemgala (Semigallia), from the beginning of the 1279 Žemgalian uprising against the Teutonic Order until... more\n\nThe article examines the political relations between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, especially Žemaitija as a constituent part, and Žemgala (Semigallia), from the beginning of the 1279 Žemgalian uprising against the Teutonic Order until the rule of Grand Duke Gediminas of Lithuania. The author tries to explain why Gediminas used the title of Duke of Žemgala in his letters of 1323, although in other cases, the title of the Lithuanian rulers does not include the name of Žemgala, and neither do other sources describing the territorial structure of the grand duchy mention Žemgala as part of it. Some historians have already argued that Žemgala was joined to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1279. The article re-examines this argument, and tries to validate it. The cooperation of Lithuania (especially Žemaitija) with the Žemgalians during the war of 1279–1290 shows that the integration of Žemgala into the Lithuanian state was in fact its integration into Žemaitija during the war. The author concludes that this integration was not denied by the time Gediminas took power, despite the fact that the Teutonic Order had already initiated a new phase in the invasion of Žemgala. Gediminas used the title of Duke of Žemgala because he actually controlled most of Žemgala. A substantial part of it remained permanently within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nDear Reader, Your attention is invited to the first edition of the catalogue of early Lithuanian half-groats (1495–1529).

The current time is extremely generous in the new discoveries thereof that enrich our collections.\n\nThe Lithuanian half-groats of Alexander became the first nation-wide currency in Grand Duchy of Lithuania at the end of the 15th century. Prior to that the individual regions of the country had different coins in circulation. The central regions of the state in the third quarter of 14th century began minting the Lithuanian small groats that initially emerged as a half fraction of the base currency of the Eastern Europe of the late Middle Ages — the Prague groat. With time, as a result of the depreciation, this kind of coins degraded into a lower denomination — a penny, which was in circulation mainly in the north-west of the country. The southern and eastern regions saw the emergence of their own coinage that oriented itself towards the monetary systems of the neighbours — Poland and the Golden Horde. Even at the end of the 15th century, in addition to Prague groats, countermarked Eastern (Crimean and Jujid) coins were also in circulation in the southern territories. A common tender was also the silver rouble bullions.\n\nSeeking to supply the state with money for the war with the Duchy of Moscow, in 1495 Alexander Jagiellon pushed through a currency reform. The monetary system was simple: it was projected to mint two currency units — the penny and the half-groat. The countable unit was the groat, which consisted of 10 pence. This decimal system was the only one in Europe at that time. Lithuanian half-groats penetrated the Polish market since their value was 20 per cent higher than that of the Polish ones.\n\nLithuanian half-groats of Alexander Jagiellon – the oldest Lithuanian coins with the inscription including the name of the state – with the legends MONETA ALEXANDRI (coin of Alexander in Latin) on obverse and MAGNI DVCIS LITVANIE (the Grand Duke of Lithuania in Latin) on reverse were minted from 1495 to 1506. Lithuanian half-groats of Sigismund I the Old – the first dated Lithuanian coins – with the legends MONETA SIGISMVNDI ( coin of Sigismund in Latin) and date on obverse and MAGNI DVCIS LITVANIE ( the Grand Duke of Lithuania in Latin) on reverse were minted from 1508 to 1529 in Vilna mint. The total quantity of coins issued was estimated as approximately 15-20 million half-groats in times of Alexander and approximately 25-30 million half-groats in times of Sigismund (Remecas 2002, pages 58-77). Lithuanian half-groat has a diameter of 20-22 millimeters (18-20.5 millimeters from 1509), weighed 0.90-1.46 g (but the eхample of even 2.36 g weight is also known), silver fineness 6/16.\n\nThe fundamentals of classification of the half-groats of Alexander and Sigismund the Old by type were laid in the works of D. Huletski (2006) and A. Hramyka (2008). These classifications are, with minor adjustments, the foundation of this catalogue.\n\nJokūbas Gierkė (Jacob Gercke, Gerich, Gierke, Gierck, Geirke) was one of the most famous 17th century clockmakers of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

The Vilnius craftsman is the only Lithuanian included in a directory of the world's best clockmakers. His mechanisms were interesting and important to the development of the craft, because he used nearly all the best achievements in clockmaking made by the middle of the 17th century, including the use of a pendulum in clocks. Table clocks made by J. Gierkė in 1626 - 1650 clearly showed his improving skills: each mechanism was increasingly intricate, included additional indications (calendar dates, the phases of the moon). Decoration of clocks could be compared to jewellery and showed quite a high level of Vilnius crafts achieved in the middle of the 17th century. Based on the old Vilnius archive materials and Polish archival data, this article considerably expands the knowledge of J. Gierkė’s personal life and family (wife and children), provides data on his business and the date of his death. It also discusses the technical qualities of clocks made by the craftsman and compares them with global achievements. A supplement to the article provides J. Gierkė’s letter, the last recognition of his financial status - a kind of a will and a list of clocks that have survived to date. There is only one clock made by the craftsman left in Lithuania; five clocks are at Polish museums. Keywords: development of crafts, historical clockmaking, Jokūbas Gierkė, Vilnius city residents."
