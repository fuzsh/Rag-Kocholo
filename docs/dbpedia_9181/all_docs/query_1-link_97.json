        "text": "Yes, in the disclaimer I promised not to talk about tourist routes, but rules are made for breaking, right?\n\nBut I like Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania myself, I really do. And I think it‘s totally worth visiting — I‘ve been there for several times and will I definitely go again. And no, not because of changing expositions (I don‘t think it‘s being changed very often) — I just like the spaces, the exhibition and there‘s a lot to see.\n\nOh, and they allow to photograph (without flash, of course).\n\nDevelopment\n\nPart of Lithuanians don‘t like Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania (or Palace of Rulers, what it would sound in common Lithuanian language). Most stupid thing is that they hate it even without visiting it. The reason of dissatisfaction is kind of a scandal of whole Palace rebuilding project, which was began many years ago, but was accelerated by former Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, and many believe this whole thing was a big matter of corruption and money washing scheme, and unnecessary costs for whole state — the price of construction was 337 millions litas / 97,6 million euros / 132 millions US dollars. Or some say Mr. Brazauskas was building a monument for himself (yes, there is a memorial board at the Palace with his name).\n\nI’m not sure what it really was or how it really went, but all that matters for me is that the Palace is nice and interesting museum — or even some modest theme park, as I call it.\n\nThe first ideas of rebuilding the Palace arose in the 1983, even before the Reform Movement of Lithuania (or Sąjūdis, in common Lithuanian). Firs stage of the idea was to rebuilt it and use it as the Gallery of Arts — it was kind of idea-undercover, to mask the idea of nationalism in Soviet times.\n\nThe historical excavation began in 1987, so during my whole childhood I saw just a fenced territory where archeologists were doing their research. The first time I visited the place was 2001 or 2002 — it was far from opening and even beginning of construction, but my professor of history in University was fan of his field, he was working there as the volunteer laborer during the research, so he took group of his students to unofficial excursion.\n\nThe constructions began in 2002 and lasted until 2009, but the Palace was officially opened only in July of 2013, on the day of Crowning of King Mindaugas, 6 of July.\n\nNot the whole palace, to be exact, only part of it. The rest should be finalized in 2-4 years.\n\nHistory\n\nReconstructed Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania represents how the palace should have looked during 1520-1530. It was a part of Lower Castle complex, and it was a residence of Sigismund the Old, Sigismund Augustus and Władysław Vasa.\n\nIn 1655 Russia was attacking Vilnius (yeah, they rose a problem even then), and during the battles the Palace was heavily damaged and plundered. Later it was decided to use the Palace only for representational purposes.\n\nYou can read all detailed history at the Wikipedia.\n\nExhibitions\n\nThe palace has 4 floors. In the cellar you’ll find authentic base of the Palace and excavations from the oldest time. For example, collection of ritual staves — “krivulės” in Lithuanian — that supposed to be confiscated from pagan priests and hidden during the Christianization era. This is only such finding in whole Europe. Also some weapons, arrow heads, examples of medieval sewerage, plenty of authentic artesian works.\n\nThe first floor is dedicated to the findings related to the Palace itself — the tiles, the crockery, dishes and other wares. Many nice miniature models of the complex of the Palace, during different ages.\n\nThe second floor is more like a theme park (without actors) — there is reconstructed Office of the State, copies of paintings and tapestry (and I believe some original ones — not from the XVI c. Palace, but from the same series in other palaces of the Europe).\n\nAlso there are some stands of for weaponry and armory exhibitions.\n\nThere is also a stand of authentic (imaginary) portrait of Duke Vytautas Magnus and his wife Ona (Ann), painted in the beginning of XVI century by unknown artist (Vytautas died in 1430).\n\nOn the third floor you’ll get to the complex of presence-chambers and (tiny) treasury with coins, some luxury wares and models of how crowns of the Grand Dukes might look like.\n\nIf you visit the Palace, I strongly recommend you to take a guide — there a lot’s to be heard and to be told — without them whole exhibition looks like a pile of artifacts, and guides may tell you everything from how noblemen were waiting (and being sorted) in presence-chambers, to love of the opera of Władysław Vasa and how strong and important were duchess and queens in the political life of Lithuania and Poland. And if you really care, I can give you contacts of one really great guide, just ask me."
