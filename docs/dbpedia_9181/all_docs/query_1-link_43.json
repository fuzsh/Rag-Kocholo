Manufacturing crosses is rooted in especially deep tradition. This unique form of Lithuanian folk art is included ​​in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. While in Lithuania, the eye catches a great number of wooden and wrought iron crosses, wooden pillars, chapels . They are erected at crossroads, forest edges, in estates to remind of the events important for Lithuania or for the person who installed them. They protect from evil eye, make the traveler’s eyes rise to heaven and his heart turn to prayer. Almost in every Lithuanian village one can find a master of this art form .\n\nThe largest museum of crosses is near the city of Siauliai . Today, it is declared by UNESCO a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity . In our time, this tradition is passed over to craftsmen who create wooden crosses and chapels . Decorated with geometric and floral ornaments (with a symbolic meaning) , such traditional crosses serve a specific purpose when set in cemeteries near roads or intersections and homes .\n\nLithuanian culture was influenced by various factors and traditions . It is an interesting mixture of elements of pagan mythology and Christianity. During the Renaissance period and later , professional Lithuanian art was greatly influenced by traditions of Western Europe. Indigenous variety of Lithuanian culture is rooted in the multicultural heritage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (XIV-XVIII c.) . Lithuanian cultural borders go beyond the ethnic borders of Lithuania which enclose different famous people who live in present-day Poland , Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.\n\nFor more than a hundred years, Lithuania has cherished its national tradition of the song and dance holiday. This is one of the biggest cultural events in Lithuania held every four years. Song and dance festival is known as the most universal expression of the Lithuanian national , cultural, artistic , social and political identity in the modern state . It is a living link connecting ancient folklore heritage, contemporary national culture and professional art .\n\nTradition and symbolism of song and dance festival in Lithuania 2003 was declared a UNESCO Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity .\n\nThe history of modern professional Lithuanian art and music began with the artist and composer Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis ( 1875-1911 ) . The works of this talented artist combined symbolism and romanticism . The early years of Lithuanian Independence were marked by flourishing of literature , art, theater and music.\n\nDramatic events of the XX century were the reason that a number of Lithuanian writers , artists, scientists chose to emigrate to the West. The works of those writers and artists who emigrated to Western Europe and the U.S. nowadays have become part of the cultural heritage of Lithuania.\n\nThe latest cultural phenomena in Lithuania have thrived on the fertile soil of ethnic culture and traditions of the European context . Lithuanian theater repeatedly enjoyed high appreciation from the audience and from critics of Lithuania and foreign countries. Directors Eimuntas Nekrošius , Donatas Banionis , Oskaras Korshunovas , Rimas Tuminas Jonas Vaitkus and Gintaras Varnas occupy deserved places in the hall of the national cultural fame . The country boasts of many well-known professional symphony and chamber orchestras , choirs and opera soloists , ballet performers . Throughout the year, one can witness numerous cultural events that include excellent annual international festivals of classical music , theater, film and poetry, which are attended by the famous Lithuanian and foreign artists .\n\nLithuania is also well known as a country of jazz. Annually, artists and lovers of jazz hold several international festivals in Kaunas, Birštonas and Vilnius. Having returned its independence in the XX century , Lithuania opened itself again to the world culture . Commonality of unique symbols , mentality of the people comprising the core of culture became available to every interested citizen of the world. Lithuanian culture has withstood many tests. Extremely strong potential of its creators is entering the next stage of development , greatly contributing to the world culture.\n\nLANGUAGE\n\nLithuanian language belongs to the Baltic group of Indo-European languages. Of all living Indo-European languages, Lithuanian language ​​is the best preserved collection of ancient sounds and morphological features . In the XIX century, the similarity of the Lithuanian language and Sanskrit was established. Lithuanians are especially fond of their language , as one of the last living Indo-European languages. Lithuanians proudly quote the French linguist Antoine Meillet , who claimed that anyone who wishes to hear ancient Indian language should listen to Lithuanian peasants speaking.\n\nLinguists divide main dialects into a large number of subdialects that survived to the present time. This is a unique phenomenon in Europe. It is assumed that the first book to be published in the Lithuanian language is “Catechism” by Martynas Mazhvidas ( in 1547 ) . “Postill ” by Mikalous Daukša (in 1599 ) , trilingual (Polish- Lithuanian -Latin ) dictionary by Konstantinas Sirvidas (in about 1620 ) and grammar textbook by Danelyus Kleynas ( in 1653 ) greatly influenced the language formation.\n\nAfter the Russian Empire’s ban on the Latin font in 1863-1904 , Lithuanians did not succumb to the requirement to write in Cyrillic (Slavonic lettering) . Lithuanian books and newspapers were printed in East Prussia and secretly smuggled by bookmen to Lithuania. Russian authorities tried to stop the illegal delivery of books , many bookmen were killed or exiled to Siberia . Lithuania is the only country that has put up a monument to a bookman.\n\nLinguistic and cultural resistance was so strong that the ban on the Lithuanian press laid the foundations of the literary language . In 2004, Lithuania celebrated 100 anniversary of the ban on the Lithuanian press . The beginning of the XX century saw the establishment of the modern Lithuanian alphabet. Lithuanian Language Institute has accumulated a corpus of four and a half million words and published a fundamental 20-volume “Dictionary of the Lithuanian language .” The Constitution of Lithuania pronounced Lithuanian as a state language."
