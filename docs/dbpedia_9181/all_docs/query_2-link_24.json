        "text": "Federal agencies should require payment in U.S. dollars whenever possible, especially with checks or money orders.\n\nAll foreign collection services for TGA deposits will be processed by one or more financial agents. The financial agent for foreign check processing will initially accept and process all foreign checks (see List of Currencies, subsection 6070.10) from Federal agencies, regardless of USD equivalent value.\n\nThe financial agent for foreign currency processing will purchase foreign banknotes (including coins) of various countries from Federal agencies. The financial agent will publish the exchange rates for all traded foreign currencies (see List of Currencies, subsection 6070.30).\n\nThe Federal agency depositor must determine whether the deposit item is a foreign check or a domestic check prior to creating a deposit in OTCnet.\n\n6030.10—Foreign Check\n\nAll of the following attributes appear on a foreign check:\n\nA foreign bank drawee name,\n\nThe address of a foreign bank drawee located outside the U.S., and\n\nA non-consecutive nine digit routing transit number.\n\n6030.20—Domestic Check\n\nThe following attribute(s) appear on a domestic check:\n\nA U.S. bank drawee name, and/or\n\nA consecutive nine digit routing transit number.\n\n6030.30—Ineligible Check Items\n\nThe following items are ineligible for processing as a domestic or foreign check:\n\nChecks with dates missing and/or incomplete information,\n\nChecks previously dishonored and so marked on the face of the item,\n\nChecks post-dated or stale-dated (i.e., six months or greater),\n\nTraveler checks,\n\nStop payment on checks,\n\nChecks written on closed accounts, and\n\nFraudulent/counterfeit checks.\n\n6045.10—Foreign Checks Listed\n\nChecks that are drawn on foreign banks, payable in foreign currency, and listed on the tradable currency list (Section 6070), or listed in OTCnet’s currency code drop down box, will be processed in OTCnet as foreign check items. These items will be treated as cash letter items. Cash letter items are immediately cleared and are granted provisional credit within two business days following the day the financial agent receives the check.\n\nA separate deposit must be created for each type of foreign currency.\n\nThe agency depositor will:\n\nLog into OTCnet Deposit Processing,\n\nCreate a deposit for a foreign check item,\n\nSelect the appropriate currency code (under Foreign Currency Information),\n\nEnter the foreign currency amount (under Foreign Currency Information), and\n\nMail the OTCnet deposit ticket and foreign check to:\n\nBank of America\n\nForeign Transit Items\n\nGA 4-004-02-02\n\n6000 Feldwood Road\n\nCollege Park, GA 30349\n\nThe financial agent will:\n\nDetermine the exchange rate and USD conversion amount and enter the amount into OTCnet,\n\nConfirm the deposit in OTCnet, and\n\nPopulate field #4 on the OTCnet deposit ticket.\n\n6045.20—Foreign Checks Not Listed\n\nForeign checks not listed on the foreign check tradable currency list (Section 6070) will be treated as collection items. Collection items are forwarded to the foreign banks that the checks are drawn on for clearance, prior to credit being granted. This collection process takes approximately six to eight weeks to complete.\n\nThe agency depositor will:\n\nLog into OTCnet Deposit Processing,\n\nCreate a deposit for a foreign check item,\n\nSelect 'Other' in drop-down box (under Foreign Currency Information),\n\nEnter the foreign currency amount (under Foreign Currency Information),\n\nSelect Financial Institution from drop-down box,\n\nSelect an Agency Accounting Code from the drop-down menu and add 'enter foreign amount',\n\nSave for Approval, and\n\nMail the OTCnet deposit ticket and foreign check to:\n\nBank of America\n\nForeign Clean Collections\n\nTX1-160-06-18\n\n1950 N. Stemmons Fwy\n\nDallas, TX 75207\n\nOnce the check item clears, the financial agent will:\n\nNotify the agency,\n\nEnter the USD equivalent amount and confirm the deposit in OTCnet.\n\nCash letter items and collection items can both be mailed in the same envelope to the same address. However, cash letter and collection items must have separately created OTCnet deposit tickets (i.e., vouchers). They cannot be listed on the same voucher.\n\nForeign checks drawn on Canadian and specific United Kingdom (UK) clearing banks (subsections 6070.10 and 6070.20), payable in U.S. dollars, will be processed as foreign check items (subsection 6045.10) in OTCnet. The agency depositor must:\n\nSelect the currency code for \"Other\" in OTCnet dropdown box, and\n\nAdd information in Block 6 that the check is written in US Dollars.\n\nForeign checks drawn on foreign banks outside of Canada and the UK, payable in U.S. dollars, will be processed as collection items (subsection 6040.20) in OTCnet.\n\nChecks drawn on foreign banks made payable through a bank in the U.S. or reflecting a consecutive 9-digit routing number will be processed in the same manner as checks in U.S. currency.\n\nThe depositary will reprocess all items over $200 not successfully cleared on initial presentation, unless the item is ineligible (subsection 6030.30).\n\nEligible return items are reprocessed as collection items and will be subject to a six to eight week processing period. In such cases, the Federal agency will receive a notice and the check.\n\nIf a foreign check is returned for any reason, the financial agent will use the Returned Item Adjustment in OTCnet. The amount of the debit will equal the credit that was given to the agency because the exchange rate applied when the item is returned will be the same exchange rate applied when provisional credit was given. The Federal agency will receive a copy of the debit advice along with the foreign check.\n\nFederal agencies may incur foreign collection charges or bank fees that are deducted from the proceeds by the foreign bank, prior to the settlement of the credit. Foreign collection fees (usual and customary fees) assessed after credit has been given in OTCnet may be charged back to the Federal agency upon notification from the Fiscal Service. Federal agencies may wish to consider setting higher minimum check limitations because of these substantial charges associated with foreign checks.\n\n6060.10—Foreign Currency Listed\n\nSeparate deposits must be created in OTCnet for each type of foreign currency.\n\nThe agency depositor will:\n\nLog into OTCnet Deposit Processing,\n\nCreate a deposit for foreign currency,\n\nSelect the appropriate currency code (under Foreign Currency Information),\n\nEnter the foreign currency amount (under Foreign Currency Information), and\n\nMail the OTCnet deposit ticket and foreign currency, if under $5000.00 (5K) USD value, by registered mail, to:\n\nBank of America GBN-LA\n\nMail Code: CA9-924-01-11\n\n2706 Media Center Drive\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90065-1733\n\n6060.20—Foreign Currency Not Listed\n\nThe agency depositor will:\n\nLog into OTCnet Deposit Processing,\n\nCreate a deposit for foreign currency,\n\nSelect the appropriate currency code (under Foreign Currency Information),\n\nEnter the foreign currency amount (under Foreign Currency Information), and\n\nMail the OTCnet deposit ticket and foreign currency, if under 5K USD value, by registered mail to:\n\nBank of America GBN-LA\n\nMail Code: CA9-924-01-11\n\n2706 Media Center Drive\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90065-1733\n\nOnce the currency clears, the financial agent will enter the USD equivalent amount and confirm the deposit in OTCnet.\n\n6060.30—Foreign Currency Over 5K USD Value\n\nIf the foreign currency deposit is over 5K USD value, OTCnet will prompt the agency depositor to call the financial agent’s Banknote Trading Desk for an armored courier pick up. The foreign currency deposits will be delivered to a specific location of the financial agent (see Contacts).\n\nThe agency depositor must confirm the legitimacy of the armored courier prior to releasing the foreign currency deposit. Once the deposit has been picked up and signed for by the financial agent’s armored courier, responsibility and liability of the deposit transfers to the TGA bank. The armored courier acts as the agent of the financial institution, not the Federal agency.\n\n6060.40—Place Orders to Sell Foreign Currency Banknotes\n\nFederal agencies may place orders to sell banknotes and selected coins in OTCnet to the financial agent. The agency depositor will communicate the appropriate instructions to the financial agent, who will receive the information in OTCnet and act upon it.\n\nFederal agencies will send the shipment of foreign currency banknotes to the financial agent in the same manner as foreign currency deposits for under and over 5K USD (subsections 6060.10 and 6060.30).\n\nSend foreign check items to:\n\nBank of America\n\nForeign Transit Items\n\nGA 4-004-02-02\n\n6000 Feldwood Road\n\nCollege Park, GA 30349\n\nSend foreign currency under $5K USD value, by registered mail, to:\n\nBank of America GBN-LA\n\nMail Code: CA 9-924-01-11\n\n2706 Media Center Drive\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90065-1733\n\nCall the financial agent’s Banknote Trading Desk for foreign currency over $5K USD value:\n\n1-800-387-1012\n\nThe foreign currency deposits over 5K USD value will be delivered by armored courier to:\n\nBank of America GBN-LA\n\nMail Code: CA 9-924-01-11\n\n2706 Media Center Drive\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90065-1733\n\nDirect inquiries concerning foreign currency issues or concerns with specific transactions to:\n\nForeign Currency Customer Service\n\n1-800-268-8144\n\ndg.bn_desk@bankofamerica.com\n\nDirect inquiries concerning foreign check deposit setup to:\n\nKaren Dolores\n\n888-715-1000, ext. 21600\n\nDedicatedService101@bankofamerica.com\n\nDirect inquiries concerning foreign check concerns with specific transactions to:\n\nBank of America\n\nForeign Transit Items\n\nGA 4-004-02-02\n\n6000 Feldwood Road\n\nCollege Park, GA 30349\n\nDirect inquiries concerning the ACR Form to:\n\nOTC Customer Support\n\n1-866-945-7920\n\nfms.otcchannel@citi.com\n\nDirect inquiries concerning the placing of orders to sell banknotes to:\n\nBank of America Global Foreign Exchange\n\n1-800-523-7860\n\nhttps://www.bankofamerica.com/foreign-exchange/foreign-currency-exchange.go\n\nDirect general inquiries concerning this chapter to:\n\nOver The Counter Division\n\nTGA Program\n\n202-874-7132\n\ntamara.whitaker@fiscal.treasury.gov\n\nor\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nOTC Support Team\n\n1-866-771-1842"
