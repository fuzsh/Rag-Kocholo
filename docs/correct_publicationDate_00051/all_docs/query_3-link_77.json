        "text": "It's like listening to a movie!\n\nWhat made the experience of listening to Battlefield Earth the most enjoyable?\n\nThe production quality of this audiobook is like nothing I have ever listened to. I have listened to other multi-cast performances with a few actors, but this was something else. Every character was unique, the sound effects were spot on, it really was an immersive experience. I sometimes have problem with my mind wandering while listening to audiobooks, but with this, I really felt IN the story.\n\nWhat other book might you compare Battlefield Earth to and why?\n\nIn a way, it is relatable to a lot of the dystopian books prevalent today like the Hunger Games, Maze Runner, etc. Except it isn't geared towards the YA market and the fight for freedom isn't a contrived game, but a real fight against alien conquerors.\n\nWhich character – as performed by the narrators – was your favorite?\n\nI really liked Terl. Char was a smaller character, but I loved the actor's performance.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nIt is way too long to listen to in one sitting, but I wanted to keep listening.\n\nStill my favorite book\n\nHave read this book twice and now listened to it.\n\nThe story is great and for 90% of the performance it is very good. The parts I didn't like were how they treated the villains. Throughout, they make them sound stupid or childish or naive. Terl was one of the smartest Cyclos on a planet of 400Billion, but they played him like he was below average intelligence and singularly focused. That is probably a fault of Hubbard as well, but the actors could have made this better.\n\nBrown Limper was played in a whinny voice that no one would have followed in the story. I think that really betrayed what Hubbard was after. Brown was sly, and not stupid. He was misguided and took an evil path. This was the worst performance in the story, which is a shame.\n\nHad Brown Limper and Terl been played better it would be 5 star for everything, but these two performances really hurt the audio version.\n\nBest audiobook EVER\n\nthe story is super interesting and actually I don't think very far from what could be a possible future. but beside that how the story is made is awesome, the sound effects are incredible, the whole audio book is very involving. you feel really there with Joni good boy. I will recommend it to anyone!\n\nA Longtime Favorite\n\nI typically do not like a multicast recording for audio books, and this is definitely that. However I did enjoy it and found that it was very well done. The addition of background noises and voices was not disruptive to the store being told. And while there were some places the music seemed excessive, overall this was a fantastic production of a story I have enjoyed several times since the mid-80s"
