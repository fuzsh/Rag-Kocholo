        "meta_description": "I am not sure about you, but reading is my favorite past time and I grab a good book to read anytime that I have the spare time. There is nothing better than immersing yourself into a good book as reading is everything to me and has been for the past 22 or so years. I can admit as a kid, I really did not love reading but when I was in my 20’s and read a fabulous series that I could not put down, I was hooked and have been building my reading library ever since. I am also a fan of actual books and love collecting them but I do admit that I have about 1000 books on my kindle too making either option perfect for any avid reader. I have been on the hunt for a new good book to read in a genre that I love which is why I jumped at the chance to check out Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 by L. Ron Hubbard. This book is a dystopian story that I am totally loving and that I am finding very hard to put down. I had no idea this book was out there and am so glad that I found it as it is truly a must-read for anyone that loves a good book and saga. Battlefield Earth is a wonderful book that is the perfect addition to my book collection. It is a sci-fi classic like Dune and Ender’s Game and it has been compared to the likes of Lord of the Rings and The Foundation. That speaks volumes about the world building of this immersive novel & since the book is rolling around to its 40th Anniversary, I wanted to give it a shout-out as I am loving it that much. Battlefield Earth is a science fiction novel of adventure, daring, and courage in which the human race is an endangered species and the future survival of the humanity is at stake. I absolutely love a good dystopian, Sci-Fi book and am so glad I stumbled upon this one as they are my favorite genres. I am almost done with this book and am loving it and in all honesty if it had not been for the Holidays… I would have been done with it but with family around for the week… time has been hard to find. It is really hard to pull myself away from it which speaks volumes about how great the book is too. Take a look at the overview below…. Battlefield Earth Overview: Sadistic Aliens… …Man is an endangered species. Is it the end of the world or the rebirth of a new one? In the year A.D. 3000, Earth is a post-apocalyptic, dystopian wasteland that has been plundered of its natural resources by alien conquerors known as Psychlos. The great cities stand crumbling as a brutal reminder of what we once were. When the aliens invaded, all the world’s armies mustered little resistance against their advanced weapons and now fewer than thirty-five thousand humans survive in a handful of communities scattered across the face of a post-apocalyptic Earth. From the ashes of humanity rises a young hero, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler. Setting off on an initial quest to discover a hidden evil, Jonnie unlocks the mystery of humanity’s demise and unearths a crucial weakness in their oppressors. Spreading the seeds of revolt, Jonnie and a small band of survivors pit their quest for freedom in an all-out rebellion that erupts across the continents of Earth and the cosmic sprawl of the Psychlo empire. For the fate of the Galaxy lies on the Battlefield of Earth. Sounds really good right!? I am so loving it and will be checking out other books from author L. Ron Hubbard when I am done with this one. L. Ron Hubbard has 19 New York Times best sellers and more than 350 million copies of his works are in circulation today. He is among the most enduring and widely read authors of our time and as a leading light of American Pulp Fiction through the 1930s and ’40s, he is further among the most influential authors of the modern age. Even the likes of Ray Bradbury to Stephen King (my moms favorite author) pay tribute to L. Ron Hubbard and his magnificent stories. You probably also know L. Ron Hubbard as the founder of Diabetics and Scientology which is pretty much the only religion born in the 20th century and regardless of that… he is a crazy good author which is what I know him for. He is inspiring as he presents the culmination of science and spiritual technology as embodied in the religion of Scientology and the end result is an epic Sci-Fi Classic to a new generation. Take a look at some author endorsements which speak volumes: “With great heroes, battles, wonders, and interstellar intrigue, this is a book that you won’t put down.” —David Farland (Star Wars novels)  “Non-stop and fast-paced. Every chapter has a big bang-up adventure.” —Kevin J. Anderson (co-author of the Dune Sagas) “Pulse-pounding mile-a-minute sci-fi action-adventure that does not stop. It is a masterpiece of popular adventure science fiction.” —Brandon Sanderson (Way of Kings) “Over 1,000 pages of thrills, spills, vicious aliens and noble humans. Un-put-downable.” —Neil Gaiman (Good Omens) “Battlefield Earth is one of my favorite works of science fiction ever. I’ve probably read it eight times or so. It’s always in my top five. It’s really brilliant.” —Hugh Howey (author of Wool) “Battlefield Earth is a terrific story! A masterpiece.” —Robert A. Heinlein (Starship Troopers) “A character-driven epic that grabs you from the start and never lets go. A compulsively-readable science-fiction tour de force, complete with breathtaking action, non-stop adventure.” —Douglas E. Richards (Unidentified) So what do you think of this fabulous book that will have you reading like crazy!? Are you looking to escape for a few hours or maybe like 50 or so to read the entire book, Battlefield Earth is for you.
