Ron Hubbard was a well known American author popular for his excellent writing works based on the fantasy and science fiction genres. He was also the founder of the group Church of Scientology. After establishing himself as a successful author, Hubbard went on to develop a system called as Dianetics. The system was first expounded in the form of books during the year 1950. Subsequently, he developed his ideas into a set of wide ranged rituals and doctrines as a part of his new religious movement called as Scientology. Later, his writing began to be used by various affiliated organizations as well as by the Church of Scientology as guiding texts for addressing the people on diverse topics such as literacy, drug rehabilitation, and business administration. Hubbard was born on March 13, 1911 in Tilden, Nebraska, United States. He was the only child of Harry Ross Hubbard, who was a former Navy officer in the U.S. Navy, and Ledora May, who was a trained teacher. Hubbard moved with his family to Kalispell, Montana during the First World War, where his father rejoined the navy while her mother began working for the state government as a clerk.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard went on to become a prolific American author of pulp fiction and became famous for his works based on the western, science fiction, adventure, and fantasy genres. He published a number of self-help books in his career such as the ‘Dianetics’, which became the number one bestselling novel in the New York Times list. Most of the writings of Hubbard are based on diverse topics. As many as 19 of his novels have featured in the New York Times bestseller list and have been translated into more than 72 languages all over the world. Hubbard also holds a number of world records in the Guinness Books such as ‘Most Audiobooks published by a single author’, ‘Most works published by a single author’, and ‘Most translated author of the world’. He has produced over 250 published fiction works in his career. This allowed him to become a prolific author for a number of pulp fiction magazines during the decade of the 1930s. That era came to be known as the Golden Age of the science fiction genre mainly because of the instrumental written works of Hubbard. In the science fiction genre, he used to consider the illustrators of the stories equally important to the readers as well as the writers.\n\nDue to his excellent works in the genre, he is said to have joined the ranks of the prominent authors like Issac Asimov, Theodore Sturgeion, A.E. Van Vogt, and Robert Heinlein. The columnists of many newsletters described the writing works of author Hubbard as quite entertaining and better than many of the pulp literature of his era. Hubbard’s literary career began with his important contributions to the student newspaper of the George Washington University, for which he worked as a reporter for several months in the year 1931. After a little while, he peaked in his writing career and began writing more than 100,000 words every month. His excellent writing speed was due to a special electric typewriter from IBM. Then, during the course of the next 6 years, various pulp fiction magazines published about 140 of the short stories written by Hubbard under various pen names such as Winchester Remington Colt, Rene Lafayette, Legionnaire 148, Kurt von Rachen, and Joe Blitz. Eventually, he went on to sell around 50 million copies of fiction and nonfiction novels all over the world. After a series of success in his writing career, author Hubbard died on January 24, 1986 at the age of 74 in Creston, California, United States. The cause of his death was found to be as stroke.\n\nThe Mission Earth series written by author L. Ron Hubbard consists of a total of 10 books published between the years 1985 and 1986. The first novel of the series was published by the Bridge Publications in the year 1985. It was titled ‘The Invaders Plan’ and features the secret invasion of the Earth by the aliens, who have been described by the author as unrecognized and already working and living with the humans. The characters of the novel seem to be sharp and the places are places in the plot are described as cloaked in menace, mystery, and splendor. In the opening sequence of the plot of the novel, Palace City in the Joy City is shown as the forbidden prison fortress of the Spiteos, which is considered as the violent fall of Voltar Confederation. It is also seen that the Confederation had planned a long-range strategy to invade and use the Earth as a staging area of their strategies, in their conquest of the galaxy. However, when they learn that the humans have destroyed the Earth with drugs, pollution, and a number of other menaces, Jettero Heller, the Combat Engineer of the Confederation is sent to the Earth to save it from self-destruction, as a part of their top-secret mission. One more Voltarian faction, who is unknown to Jettero Heller is already using the Earth secretly as a base for supplying drugs. When it comes to know about the plans of Jettero Heller, it begins a counter mission for thwarting him. The novel went on to become very successful which allowed it to become an international and a New York Times bestseller. It went on to sell more than 5 million copies all over the world and continued to appear on the bestseller lists of in a number of countries all over the world.\n\nThe second novel of the series was published in the title ‘Black Genesis’ and was released by the Bridge Publications in the year 1986. The plot of this novel is full of instances of betrayal, intrigue, and blackmailing. Author Hubbard has set the plot of the novel in Turkey and America. In the opening sequence of the plot of the novel, it is shown that the streets of Turkey are riddled with drugs such as heroin. At the same time in America, it is shown that the government has become corrupt. The novel relentlessly hurls into the underworld of the Earth, which seems to be torn by the criminal rivalries and Mafia wars. Everywhere, the normal human beings are seen less and the killers, drug-runners, assassins, prostitutes, and corrupt government officials, are seen more. As the plot of the novel moves forward with its heart pounding pace, it depicts the interesting twists and turns filled with a unique blend of ingenuity, betrayal, tension, tragedy, and humor. The success of the novel allowed it to be nominated for the Hugo Award in the Best Novel category in the year 1987."
