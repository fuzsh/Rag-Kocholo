        "text": "He grabbed the hilt of the knife and tried to yank it out of Snith’s heart. It was stuck. He looked at Terl.\n\nThe Psychlo, still raving, was clawing at the access plate. Tearing his claw points he was actually cutting into the hard metal to make a circle and remove the core.\n\nIt was quieter outside. Dwight’s voice came out of the mine radio at his belt, “Ten seconds to withdraw!”\n\nJonnie knew he was late.\n\nThe wires were still humming.\n\nJonnie made himself concentrate. He still had a job to do. He could feel his heart revving up.\n\nHe got a hand under Sir Robert’s armpit and dragged him through the slush. He got to the console. He knew it had a bomb in it he would have to disarm fast. But he tucked Sir Robert in close to the console so the dome coming down would not amputate his arms or legs.\n\nHe glanced at the console. The switch was in the up position. It would have to be in the down position when next this was fired. He wished he had time to tell somebody.\n\nHe fumbled for his remote control box. There was broken glass in his pouch. His arm felt like it was on fire. The broken glass was the serum ampule! He had no serum.\n\nThe remote shook. No, it was his hand shaking. He threw the switch and swung the crane. No. He had to turn off the armor curtain first. He was getting flashes of blackness. His heart was beating faster and faster.\n\nThe armor curtain! He crawled to the bus bar and got it off. Back at the console he looked up at the dome. He operated the remote, positioning the dome exactly above them so it would come down correctly. He threw the switch to lower it. It was coming down too slowly. The cables must be stiff. He could not help that.\n\nHe got a hatchet out of his belt for the cables. He would have to be ready to hack them off the instant the humming stopped.\n\nJonnie lost track of time. He could still hear the humming of the wires.\n\nHe looked toward Terl over the platform. The monster seemed to have succeeded in opening the access plate. He was handling the bomb with great care, extracting the heavy metal core.\n\nSuddenly Jonnie knew what Terl was going to do. He would throw that core at him. It would travel like a bullet! It could go straight through him.\n\nAbruptly Jonnie saw something else.\n\nBrown Limper!\n\nHe was rushing forward with a Thompson submachine gun in his hands. He had gone through where the armor curtain had been at the far end of the platform. He was trying to get so close to Jonnie he couldn’t miss.\n\nThe dome was not yet down.\n\nTerl had the core in his paw now. He was going to throw it at Jonnie.\n\nIt was quieter. There was only smoke and falling snow and the creak of the cables lowering the dome. Jonnie pointed at Brown Limper.\n\n“Terl! He is going to shoot!” he shouted.\n\nTerl spun around and saw Brown Limper. He saw him raising the Thompson to aim it. One shot at this moment would shatter the firing.\n\nTerl threw. He threw with all his strength.\n\nThe core hit Brown Limper in the side. It ripped through and hit his spine. The Thompson clattered to the ground.\n\nBrown Limper fell in a jerking tangle of arms and legs, screaming: “Damn you, Tyler! Damn you!” He laid still.\n\nThe wires were still humming.\n\nTerl yelled at Jonnie, “I still win, rat brain!” He knew better than to move now.\n\nJonnie’s head was pounding. His heart was going too fast. But he could shout back. And he felt he had to pin Terl there, distract him.\n\n“Those coffins are full of sawdust! They were changed in your bedroom this morning!” shouted Jonnie.\n\nTerl whirled to look at them.\n\n“And the gold never went to Psychlo! We changed those too!” yelled Jonnie.\n\nTerl opened his mouth to shout.\n\nThe platform cargo shimmered. The coffins full of sawdust shimmered. The Brigante corpses on the platform shimmered. Terl shimmered. And it was all gone. The platform was empty, clean even of slush.\n\n-27.470933 153.023502"
