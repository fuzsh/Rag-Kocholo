        "text": "Sisters Rose and Alice Robilliard have been named the winners of the L. Ron Hubbard Writers of the Future Contest under the pen name Rosalyn Robilliard. Winning has earned the pair a week-long masterclass workshop, an invitation to an awards event and the publication of their winning story in the international bestselling anthology 'L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future Volume 40'.\n\nGrowing up in a tiny English village on the Essex coastline, their imaginations were sparked at an early age by the ancient woodland and salty marshes. As children, they drew comics, wrote stories and constructed elaborate fairy worlds.\n\nLater on, they shared a house in Manchester and began talking about writing stories together more seriously. Much studying and research ensued, in which time they realised that writing was the only place they could really return to the freedom and imagination of their childhood.\n\nIt was an escape but also a place where they felt most at home. When Alice moved across the country to Norwich and Rose stayed in Manchester, writing gave them the perfect excuse to stay connected, spending a few hours each week nattering away on video calls, exploring realms beyond everyday reality.\n\nTheir story, The Wall Isnâ€™t a Circle, was born from their fascination with the past and their longing to step back in time. An evening spent discussing the consequences of being able to drop into the consciousness of any human in history quickly grew legs and eventually ran wild as their finished story.\n\nThe contest is one of the most prestigious writing and illustrating competitions in the world and is currently in its 41st year. It is judged by some of the premier names in speculative fiction.\n\nThe Writers of the Future Contest judges include Tim Powers (author of On Stranger Tides), Kevin J Anderson and Brian Herbert (Dune prequel series), Robert J Sawyer (The Oppenheimer Alternative), Brandon Sanderson (Mistborn series, The Stormlight Archive), Larry Niven (Ringworld), Orson Scott Card (Ender's Game), Nnedi Okorafor (Who Fears Death), Hugh Howey (Wool), and Katherine Kurtz (Deryni series) to name a few.\n\nFollowing the 1982 release of his internationally acclaimed bestselling science fiction novel, Battlefield Earth, written in celebration of 50 years as a professional writer, L. Ron Hubbard created the Writers of the Future in 1983 to provide a means for aspiring writers of speculative fiction to get that much-needed break. Due to the success of the Writers of the Future Contest, the companion Illustrators of the Future Contest was inaugurated five years later.\n\nIn the 39 years of the Writers of the Future Contest, there have been 547 winners and published finalists. The past winners of the Writing Contest have published 2,000 novels and nearly 6,300 short stories, have produced 36 New York Times bestsellers and their works have sold over 60 million copies.\n\nThe Writers of the Future Award is the genre's most prestigious award of its kind and has now become the largest, most successful, and demonstrably most influential vehicle for budding creative talent in the world of speculative fiction. Since its inception, the Writers and Illustrators of the Future contests have produced 39 anthology volumes (with this event) and awarded upwards of $1m in cash prizes and royalties.\n\nFor more information about the contests, visit www.WritersoftheFuture.com.\n\nSubmitted by Galaxy Press"
