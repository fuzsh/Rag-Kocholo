Except that right now, he doesn't know that. He can't even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it. All he knows is that he's been asleep for a very, very long time. And he's just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nBazinga\n\nBy Davidgonzalezsr on 05-04-21\n\nGeorge Orwellâ€™s 1984\n\nAn Audible Original adaptation\n\nBy: George Orwell, Joe White - adaptation\n\nNarrated by: Andrew Garfield, Cynthia Erivo, Andrew Scott, and others\n\nLength: 3 hrs and 27 mins\n\nOriginal Recording\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 5,603\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 5,363\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 5,362\n\nItâ€™s 1984, and life has changed beyond recognition. Airstrip One, formerly known as Great Britain, is a place where Big Brother is always watching, and nobody can hide. Except, perhaps, for Winston Smith. Whilst working at the Ministry of Truth, rewriting history, he secretly dreams of freedom.

Since then, sheâ€™s been trying to live a normal life (whatever that means), but ending up single, unemployed, and living on a boat outside her godfatherâ€™s pub definitely wasnâ€™t part of the plan. So, when Tansyâ€™s ex-husband â€“ fellow monster hunter Rex Barclay â€“ turns up like a bad penny and asks for her help with his latest investigation, Tansy reluctantly agrees. At first, the job appears to be a straightforward monster hunt â€“ following a spate of large creature sightings, Rex believes a werewolf is on the loose in Norfolk.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nRomance Whiplash\n\nBy Julie on 07-18-24\n\nThe Martian\n\nBy: Andy Weir\n\nNarrated by: Wil Wheaton\n\nLength: 10 hrs and 59 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n5 out of 5 stars 36,694\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 32,673\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 32,569\n\nSix days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that heâ€™s alive - and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. But Mark isn't ready to give up yet.\n\n1 out of 5 stars\n\nI love Wil Wheaton but why not R. C. Bray?\n\nBy L.

Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down.\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nA ferrari with no motor\n\nBy will on 11-18-17\n\nStarter Villain\n\nBy: John Scalzi\n\nNarrated by: Wil Wheaton\n\nLength: 8 hrs and 5 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 8,673\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 7,711\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 7,705\n\nInheriting your uncle's supervillain business is more complicated than you might think.

A divorced substitute teacher living with his cat in a house his siblings want to sell, all he wants is to open a pub downtown, if only the bank will approve his loan. Then his long-lost uncle Jake dies and leaves his supervillain business (complete with island volcano lair) to Charlie.
