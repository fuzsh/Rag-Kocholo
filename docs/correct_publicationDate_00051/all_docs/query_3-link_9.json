        "text": "January 1, 2011\n\nAs a Mormon I feel a sense of gratitude to L. Ron Hubbard for coming up with a religion with followers that most people perceive as being bigger weirdos than Mormons.\n\nThe book is good fun. An against all odds, buckskin rags to laser beam riches, story of a poor caveman named Johnny Goodboy who ends up the most powerful entity/person in the galaxy and annihilates an entire race of nasty overlord bugbears in the process. Yea it is pure crap but its pure crap with a Tom Selleck mustache\n\nJanuary 27, 2021\n\nBack in the 80s when I was just a little nerd I mowed many a lawn to afford the then-outrageous sum of $39 for the hardcover of this book. I had no idea who L. Ron Hubbard was back then, of course. I just saw a post-apocalyptic sci-fi book that seemed to be cool and I wanted it. I was a fairly well-read little kid back then even if it was only classic or now-obscure science fiction authors.\n\nSo... this was the first book I ever HATED. I think it went off to a used book store years later but if I could I would go back and repurchase it so I could take it and BURN the stupid thing. If you though the movie was bad, this was agony incarnate. Hundreds of pages of generic sci-fi Scientological DRIVEL. Anyone who thinks this book is good. All I have to say is you're clear.\n\nThere. I am done. Thank you.\n\nAugust 9, 2007\n\nDon't be fooled by the fact that the movie adaptation was the worst movie ever made, or that L. Ron Hubbard is responsible for the spiritual pyramid scheme that is scientology. This book is the coolest.\n\nNovember 17, 2015\n\nMy kingdom for an editor! At over 1000 pages, this novel really needed one, but I guess it’s not so easy to edit a paranoid madman (for that’s what L. Ron Hubbard was at this point). He states in the introduction that he didn’t make any effort to contain himself while writing Battlefield Earth and it shows. What also shows is the era when Hubbard did the majority of his science fiction writing. Battlefield Earth may have been published in the 1980s, but it reads much more like a novel of the 1950s.\n\nThe main character is Jonnie Goodboy Tyler. That middle name says it all really. Tyler is very much a Gary Stu character—he can and does learn anything. He masters the language of the invading aliens, the Psychlos. Despite coming from a material culture that has been reduced to the horse, he easily adapts to machines. He also becomes an expert diplomat after a half hour of coaching from one of his assistants. Also telling is that computers are not introduced until very much towards the end of the novel—just like the Lensman series of E.E. Smith, complicated craft are run without their benefit. This makes sense, as in the late 1970s computers were uncommon and expensive (so it also makes sense that the first characters in the book to use them are the inter-galactic bankers). Plus, Hubbard had been isolated from mainstream society for years, hiding from the authorities on his ship, and may have been unaware of the importance of computers in aviation.\n\nAnother 1950s aspect to the novel is Jonnie’s relationship with Chrissie, his love interest. In the beginning, he barely acknowledges her and during her ordeal of being held captive by Terl, a Pscyhlo who needs leverage over Jonnie, the most contact they have is an almost-hand-holding incident. Somewhere after page 990, they finally get to embrace. By book’s end, they have two children, leaving the reader to assume that they eventually get beyond the embrace. It is ironic that in his introduction to the novel, Hubbard admonishes other writers that sci fi is more about people than about science and then he goes on to create absolutely wooden, almost-emotionless characters. The best realized emotion is anger (something that may accurately reflect Hubbard himself).\n\nWhat I found truly fascinating was the duality of Jonnie and Terl (his Psychlo captor). Jonnie is upright, able to do anything, a leader of men, smart—in short everything good thing that Hubbard liked to believe he himself possessed. Terl, one of the Psychlo overlords, is almost a parody of a sadistic, crazy-like-a-fox bad guy. He is cunning, given to fits of temper, a substance abuser, cares about no one but himself, and is acknowledged as being mentally unstable. This being the description of Hubbard the Scientology leader, especially in his later years (when this novel was published), one wonders how much of himself he realized that he was channeling into this character!\n\nIncidentally, it seems that bad guys always smell bad. The Psychlos are furry, mangy and stinky. The Brigantes, a nasty human tribe, are not only cannibals but don’t wash and can often be smelled before they are seen.\n\nBy about page 530, I was wondering why in the world I was reading this monstrosity. By about page 770, I was actually committed to finishing and wanted to know how in the world Hubbard would wrap things up. Turns out, Battlefield Earth is 1066 pages written in order for Hubbard to stick out his tongue at the psychiatric profession! Hubbard spent his entire life trying to be the one in control, controlled by no one. Jonnie actually manages that (and goes one better, as he not only runs Earth, but out manoeuvres other planetary races plus the inter-galactic bank). Hubbard has fun with his depiction of the bankers (they seem to be descended from sharks and have insatiable appetites), but he saves his venom for the psychiatric field. It turns out that it was it was evil “catrists” (i.e. psychiatrists) who took the smartest among the Psychlo population (Hubbard calls them the “brain-brains”), recruited them to the Security Service, and taught only them the valuable secrets of controlling inter-galactic trade. No one knew the previous name of the race—they were known as Psychlos, after the evil people who conquered them from within. All non-security members of the race have brain implants that kill them if they try to even think about maths and sciences.\n\nThis is richly ironic, as Hubbard probably wished for such a mind control device often, when dealing with his Scientology followers, who had an unfortunate tendency to think for themselves! He worked hard to set up a very punitive system to keep them in line and thinking only what he wanted them to think.\n\nIn real life, Hubbard hated psychiatry (probably because they could have recognized his mental illness and would have confined him for treatment). There is a point in the book where Jonnie realizes that he has “cured himself of an injury through the power of his mind,” a not-so-subtle plug for Hubbard’s Dianetics program. No wonder this novel is so popular among Scientologists (including John Travolta who insisted in starring in the dog of a movie).\n\nThis is book 191 in my science fiction and fantasy reading project.\n\nFebruary 23, 2009\n\nThis was a horrible book (and even worse movie). I read it in 2000, so it has been a while, but I remember just how stupid of a book it was. I struggled through every page. I can't believe I even finished it, but i wanted to read it before I saw the movie. Big mistakes.\n\nTo get an idea of what it is like, go play with a 5-8 year old boy. Pretend to shoot him with a laser. He will then pretend to put up a forcefield to block the laser. Then you have to pretend to have some weapon that will break through the forcefield or go around it. But the kid will then pretend to have some other forcefield or superspeed or something else that will protect him. At every stage of the book it is as if the main character knew exactly what to do, and the materials he needed were at hand. There was no real struggle, no suspense because the book trained you to expect that the main character would get what he needed at just the right time.\n\nThere were some subplots that had potential, but definitely not worth reading the book.\n\nJuly 19, 2010\n\nI know right? 5 stars? How is that even possible? And yet here we are. This book is SOOO amazingly good. It is detailed, specific, imaginative, technical, possible and impossible all in one breath. The world Hubbard has created here is so detailed it's hard to believe it doesn't actually exist.\n\nAlso, for once, this book is long enough. Few Sci-Fi books in my opinion tell the entire story, they gloss over or cut out before getting to the completion of the event. This book does none of that, you are spared nothing, and yet it never becomes boring or monotone. Truly an amazing book, I'm ashamed it took me so long to read it.\n\nFebruary 23, 2008\n\nI Had to Bathe my Eyes in Fire:\n\nI read this in high school as I was curious about many different ideas, philosophies, religions, and had a vague notion that it was attached to the founder of the Dianetics thing and more importantly, I loved reading just about anything. I finished the book and spent a few relaxing minutes with coals in my eye sockets to get the awful plot loopholes, the Deus Ex Machina every five pages, and the painfully awkward rhythm and flow of the story to leech out of my brain.\n\nAfter college, I came back to this fond old chestnut as it somehow kept reappearing on bestseller lists and incredible reviews. Maybe I had judged it too harshly; maybe I had been going through my Ayn Rand phase and just didn't read it the right way.\n\nAbout halfway through it book I enjoyed a brief soak in a tub of acid to wash away where it had touched me. This book is just inexcusably, unmitigatedly, painfully awful. Every chapter should be titled \"Then Yet Another Unexplained Miracle Happens, While the Antagonists Trip Over Themselves.\" \"Ha-ha!\" This wasn't about the triumph of the Hero or Man, or The Human Spirit, it was about aliens are so ridiculously incompetent they can't even take a bath.\n\nAhhhh yes, sweet skin just beginning to grow back. It itches a little.\n\nApril 5, 2009\n\nPost, post-apocalypse novel that goes a step further than most. Don't let the L. Ron Hubbard part scare you, no Scientology mentioned. The John Travolta movie sucked, so ignore that, too. The book is multi layered in meaning and probably has more truth in it than most apocalypse novels. Johnny Goodboy Tyler has been living in his village in a primitive mountain lifestyle for all of his eighteen or so years. The village is dying, with people sick, passed out on herbs, or just apathetic in their hard scrabble lives. He hunts with skill and has explored all the lands that aren't forbidden, but he wants to go further. He has been warned about the giants who kill for enjoyment, but doesn't really believe in the threat. He ends up going beyond the boundary of his people to explore what was once Denver, discovers books in a library, as well as ruins of a civilization he had never imagined. But then he gets caught by a Psychlo, the very giants spoken of in feared legends of his people, becoming the Psychlo's pet and prisoner. Johnny is smart enough to work it to his advantage, which is where this adventure begins. The brilliance of this tale is in the hierarchy of alien nationalities scoping out Earth, the bankers, especially. I won't spoil it, read it yourself for more. It's got all the elements of a good post-apocalyptic read plus science fiction alien adventures, but you have to look beyond that story to what this book is REALLY saying. Who is really in charge here? The legal title, the money, the greys, pay attention to that more than the hero saves the day story and you can actually learn something valuable from this book.\n\nJuly 29, 2016\n\nBattlefield Earth has long been one of my favorite science fiction reads. This is a reread for me. It has a great plot with lots of action. The aliens are some of the most interesting (I would compare them to Niven quality). I never felt that the story dragged, which is saying something for a 1,000 page book.\n\nIt is a fun and inspiring read.\n\nThere is a \"pulpish\" element that sometimes raises the quality of the story and sometimes brings it down. Jonnie Goodboy is our protagonist and he is straight out of the pulp action stories of the 40s. There is nothing he can't do if he puts his mind to it. He is the embodiment of the \"bootstrap\" philosophy. But he pulls it off without being cheesy and he comes across as a down to earth personality.\n\nOk the quality that brings the story down, is the role of the female characters. There just really is not a strong personality among the few females that play a part in the story. Patty comes the closest but that only really surfaces toward the end of the book. Chrissie is a true sweetheart and is very endearing, but she never grows or broadens her understanding of the world as the story progresses. Given the overall mood of the book, this does not takeaway from my enjoyment but it could have been so much better.\n\nThanks to Net Gallery for the ebook. I also listened to the new audio version with an amazing (both in quality and quantity) of readers. I loved the music ever between chapters.\n\nI know the PR on this book suffered from the terrible movie (I can't even watch the trailer without cringing). Don't let that dissuade you. This is a great story and if you like sci-fi action; I believe you will really enjoy the escapism this book provides.\n\nMay 22, 2007\n\nWithout a doubt the worst book I ever read. It was loaned to me by a co-worker and I read the whole thing. There is nothing to recommend this book. No redeeming qualities at all. Big Fat Waste of Time.\n\nJanuary 24, 2014\n\nI know but I enjoyed this book (too bad about the movie). I found it a fun read and really there weren't a lot of \"hints of things to come\". It's also too bad Hubbard didn't stick to writing science fantasy...I mean while admitting that's what it is.\n\nThere are some silly touches here (I mean Johnny \"Goodboy\" Tyler...) but it's also readable (for such a huge tome). Earth is dominated by a star spanning alien intelligence that pretty much rules the galaxy (at least) because it possesses a \"science\" that no one else does. While everyone (all other races) have to truck along through space dealing with physics, space time, worm holes etc. the conquerors (the Psychlos) can teleport instantaneously.\n\nCan humanity ever throw off the yoke of slavery (the few that remain after the \"almost\" genocide of the human race!!!???\n\nRight okay, so anymore and it's a spoiler. As I said not a bad read. I go three stars as it can be fun at times (and is possibly a primer for Dianetics elsewhere)a novel that amounts to total brain candy that unfortunately some people try to find mysteries of the universe in.\n\nJust my opinion of course. If you see this as part of a deeply insightful cannon of truths, well sorry. Just remember I'm obviously one of the uninitiated.\n\nBrain candy, space war, a bit over the top. Read it years ago. I've read all kinds of reviews of this book, some hate it condemning the writing, the science (yeah, you can condemn that...I mean I called it \"science fantasy\" for a reason), the plotting etc. I've read others who love it and say they couldn't put it down. I fall in between. The plot moves along and doesn't drag. The characters are fairly cookie cutter and a little cardboard. The writing is serviceable and not bad (Hubbard was at the time already a veteran writer with a lot of short story and novella work under his belt...and lets not forget \"other types of books\"). As I said, readable and pretty enjoyable. An adventure book where the facts of science are a bit malleable and stereotypes proudly abound. Enjoy.\n\nJanuary 8, 2008\n\nDon't be put off by the fact that the founder of Scientology wrote this novel, and definitely don't let the horrendous movie throw you off. This book is incredible! Well, at the least the first 3/4 of the book is. The last few chapters are interesting, but not gripping, as they detail the events that occur in the aftermath of the climax.\n\nJune 22, 2008\n\nIt's times like these I really wish you could rate a book zero stars. I read this out of curiosity but the horrible writing and thinly veiled attack on psychology and modern medicine made it just painful to get through.\n\nAugust 22, 2013\n\nThere seems to be an inordinately large number of detractors of this work of science fiction; that for my part seems undeserved. For me, I loved most everything about this book, the social commentary, the science fiction, the author’s conceived universe, the satire and comic relief, the pulse pounding drama and adventure and above all, the sure satisfaction of good triumphing over evil. This book has all those things.\n\nHubbard was a gifted writer whose conceived images flow through our minds to create plush landscapes and rich characters of imagination.\n\nLike many others have commented, the movie version was a major disappointment and failure and I would urge all not to judge the quality of the prose by the quality of the film; that would be a big mistake. Additionally, there is NO link that could cause anyone to possibly think that Battlefield Earth is a covert document designed to weaken the resolve of readers and create mindless robot Scientologists; laughable but plausible certainly in the minds of ever active conspiracy theorists; you know who you are.\n\nThe action takes place on Earth in the year 3000. An alien species, the Pychlos, have conquered our planet over 1,000 years ago and have established a mining operation that is designed to deplete the Earth of its natural resources and leave it a useless husk and then move on to the next target. Such is the way of the Pychlos, giant humanoid creatures over 9’ tall. They only breathe the purple noxious (to us) gas of their home world; that explodes when it comes in contact with radioactivity. They are unmercifully cruel, sadistic and selfish beyond all reason, even to each other. In the eons past they have all but obliterated the human race and what’s left doesn’t look like it will be around much longer. “Man is an endangered species,” comments one Pychlo to another in a passing remake that carries no significance other than “small talk”.\n\nWell, there is a surprise coming and it will come from the most unlikely and unexpected place; a small clan of sick and dying humans protected from the Pychlos due to their location next to a radioactive mine that spells “stay away” to the highly reactive gas that all Pychlos breathe. Up rises handsome and heroic Johnny Goodboy Tyler, a member of the primitive clan that leaves the security of his small community to search for a cure to the radiation sickness that many of his fellow clan members are stricken with. Johnny and his community and for that matter all of mankind have been reduced to simplistic near prehistoric times and have little understanding of the sciences and technology. What chance does he possibly have?\n\nFrom this simple beginning, Pychlo greed will impact with human ingenuity and nobleness to create a page turning frenzy dear reader. Each page builds on the previous to incrementally advance the story into the holy grail of, “I’ve got to see what happens next,” thereby creating a mostly satisfying read. The story gets a bit lost towards the second third of the book but regains its footing as events come to an end. The final ending left me still wanting a bit more but I think that is only because the adventure that brought me there was such a rich and fun ride.\n\nYou will find Battlefield Earth a deep well of science facts pushed and tugged by Hubbard to create fictional representations that are fun and necessary to the story. There are some glitches to be sure; “You want me to believe what??!!” But they few and minor. This is not a work of hard science fiction. It is first and foremost a story of adventure told in the spirit of the pulp magazines of old and that is a good thing.\n\nJuly 27, 2013\n\nScanning the first page of reviews I am baffled. Apparent to me is that readers (if you truly read this book) are hung up on other issues than what makes a good sci-fi read, or base opinion on a poorly done film. This book contains over 1000 pages of smooth rock em sock em edge of your pants adventure set in the not so distant future. Perhaps its the lack of vampire sex that turns off readers?\n\nPurely speculation, but I bet Stephen Hawking after reading this novel would say to himself, yep! This will happen...if only we are so lucky.\n\nSpoiler:\n\nAdvanced (egotistical) Aliens find our mineral rich earth, destroy most of its clearly non-sentient human vermin, set up mining operations, rinse repeat throughout the galaxy... Only greed and ego sets the scene for the Brave, the Few, the um, well, humans to perhaps fight back using the aliens own advanced (stolen) technologies.\n\nThis is a very good read! It contains Missiles, Drones, Radiation, Teleportation, Treasure, Love, Loss and good old science. Yeah its fantasy because like Stephen Hawking, I don't believe WE PEOPLES will like a true alien encounter, but 'Battlefield Earth' leaves us humans with hope.\n\nFebruary 26, 2013\n\nThe best part about this book was when I used it to kill a wasp.\n\nI couldn't even make it halfway though. I was really hoping I'd kind of like this, so I could say to myself, \"Well, L. Ron was totally bats, but at least he wrote some good sci-fi!\" NO. No he did not.\n\nI have never sympathized more with a 'villainous' character, (although I disliked every character I encountered in this book, the alien was definitely my \"least\" least-favorite) hoping he'd slowly kill Johnny friggin Goodboy more and more with each paragraph I dragged myself across.\n\nI'm not even going to re-donate this to the used bookstore I got it from; It's going directly into the recycling bin. I'm *that* bitter.\n\nDecember 14, 2013\n\nHa, Ha, Ha.\n\nI just remembered I read a fucking L. Ron Hubbard book!\n\nAugust 25, 2016\n\nI read this book many years ago and have recently listened to the soon to be released unabridged multi-cast audiobook. I found this book to still be incredibly well written with a high volume of fast-paced adventure (which I like a lot). Hubbard really creates memorable characters, sometimes with a minimum of words, such that you know that person. I also like how the evolution of the hero rapidly moves out of his personal plight and that of his girlfriend and the town he grew up in, to that of attempting to solve the the dilemna of mankind and then expanding from there. While it is a classic hero's journey, Johnny is a character that I would like to think I could somehow imagine myself being (at least in part), which makes the story all the more appealing to me.\n\nI also prefer stories where honor, integrity and doing what is right ultimately triumphs. And this story has that in a big way!\n\nI highly recommend this book to anyone who likes science fiction and adventure.\n\nApril 5, 2016\n\nTotal dogshit.\n\nScientologists must - repeat MUST - give this book good reviews and say how well written it is. They are not permitted to disparage L. Ron Hubbard or any of his works.\n\nDecember 2, 2008\n\nI suffered through this book until the very end - just so I could say I had read it. I love good sci-fi. This is NOT good sci-fi. Unless you enjoy psychic pain, avoid this book.\n\nDecember 13, 2017\n\nA luxurious unrushed performance which extracts to the maximum every moment of drama inherent in the original story with the voice acting, sound an musical accompaniment. If I had a psycho hand I would give this audio performance a 6 of 6 stars!\n\nThe story starts out in the the year 3000 with an Alien bar scene on earth where hard pressed misused Psycho mine workers discuss the likely extinction of humanity over drinks of Kerbango and shooting mayflies with laser guns. *belch* worthless native animals those humans.\n\nThe scene then switches to a tiny village in the mountains of Denver not far away where the last 35 humans in that area have resided under primitive conditions since the gas drones dropped by the psychlos wiped out most of humanity many generations before.\n\nJohnny Goodboy Tyler, of that village, at the time of his fathers death, wonders why the people of his village are so unhealthy, unmotivated and poor. So many things don't make sense. So many questions. Johnny wants some answers...\n\nThus begins this epic saga of the imagination where the tyrannies of war, oppression and bigotry eventually fail after enduring great trials. Nothing ever goes off quite smoothly there are many surprises.\n\nA very satisfying read. This story is LOADED with cool bits of SO many items of interest.\n\nA very satisfying read and even more fun on audio. I found the tone and expressions used by the voice actors enhanced the story accurately and created a bit better portrayal that when I read Battlefield Earth.\n\nMarch 1, 2019\n\nOh my God is this book long, and not well written! The plot seems to drag and go on forever with tons of useless pages. The storyline is full of bad plot devices and concepts. Only recommended if you don't like the person you are giving the book to, just remember many trees will have died for you to get your revenge. It is however huge and makes a great Doorstop\n\nApril 5, 2016\n\nThis is one of my all time favourite SF novels, and it has nothing to do with the author's Scientology nonsense! Also, don't be fooled by the horrid film adaptation.\n\nRead the unabridged edition it when I was 15 or 16. I used sit in the back row in Music class, and read it, but on the second day the teacher saw me. Fortunately, he didn't say or do anything except keep the book during that period. Believe it or not, I am is his landlord now!\n\nCritical Acclaim:\n\n\"A terrific story.\" - Robert A. Heinlein\n\n\"I read Battlefield Earth straight through in one sitting.\" - Frederik Pohl\n\n\"Over 1,000 pages of thrills, spills, vicious aliens and noble humans. I found Battlefield Earth un-put-downable.\" - Neil Gaiman\n\n\"Pure Science Fiction... written by a super writer of the Golden Age of Science Fiction... the great pulp music in every line... will be talked about for a decade... wonderful adventure... great characters... a masterpiece.\" - A.E. Van Vogt\n\n\"Battlefield Earth is like a 12-hour 'Indiana Jones' marathon. Non-stop and fast-paced. Every chapter has a big bang up adventure.\" - Kevin J. Anderson\n\n\"A legendary master of the Golden Age of Science Fiction returns after thirty years with a monumental new work, a gigantic achievement.\" - Forrest J. Ackerman\n\n\"This has everything: suspense, pathos, politics, war, humor, diplomacy and intergalactic finance.\" - Publishers Weekly\n\nFor many more, see:\n\nhttp://battlefieldearth.com/reviews-c...\n\n[All reviews are from the above site, except Van Vogt's and Ackerman's which are from the just jacket of the St. Martin's Press edition.:]\n\nJanuary 27, 2014\n\nThis pulpy mishmash of \"Flash Gordon\" and \"Planet of the Apes\" is actually fairly enjoyable light adventure for a good portion, but it eventually collapses under the ponderous weight of Hubbard's ceaseless moralizing and bloated sense of self-importance. The main character is named Jonny Goodboy Tyler, for Glob's sake - Hubbard's self-consciously on-the-nose reaction to Luke Skywalker, written with the aim of turning the thick tome into a \"major motion picture,\" as the jacket copy proclaimed for so many years before the actual fact. It actually might have been much more fun as a schlocky, mid'80s film spectacle with John Travolta in the heroic role rather what eventually turned out to be.\n\nFolks accuse Hubbard of doing nothing but proselytizing for the Church of Scientology here, but aside from the general pulp SF vibe and his naming the bad guys Psychlos - psychiatry is viewed as dangerous and evil by the church - I really didn't see much of that. I certainly can't imagine anyone being inspired to join up after choking down this turgid paperweight. More than anything, it's basically a glorified vanity project for a washed-up \"master\" of bottom-rung science fiction, long past his glory days.\n\nFebruary 12, 2009\n\nBattlefield Earth is a good science fiction novel. One of the most remarkable ideas from this book is the complete unity of the population of earth. I know that world unity and peace may be just as science fiction as aliens and advanced technologies, but I hope we can make progress in that direction. I just hope it doesn't take a severe global disaster (like aliens threatening to destroy or enslave all of us) to accomplish world unity.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard leaves his philosophical ideas, for the most part, out of this book. I was hoping I would pick up a little insight to scientology while reading this book, but there is little to no illusion to Hubbard's philosophies. If you want to find something out about scientology, this is not the book to read.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want an entertaining science fiction novel full of alien races, advanced technology, struggle for survival of the human race, and intergalactic polotics, this is a great book to read.\n\nI didn't really know what to expect when I picked up this book, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is very long, so make sure you have a lot of time before you start it.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe opening line is one that has stuck with me over the years. I first read this book as a young boy, and it was firmly one of my favourites. Then adulthood and awareness of the author's other interests influenced my opinion, which I suppose is unfair. I have re-read the book, and from an adult's perspective would give it 3 stars. The storyline is a little longwinded, to say the least. However, I have to consider my childhood perspective, when I would have unreservedly given this 5 stars. Back then, I was fully immersed in this book and couldn't wait for the \"motion picture\" (do NOT watch this!!!). I wouldn't hesitiate in recommending it to young readers who love science fiction and love reading, but it is not for adults. It's just a bit silly.\n\nIf you enjoy alternative histories, then you might like Deception, a tale in which the Nazis have gained the upperhand and are exploring ways to solve a planet hurtling towards environmental disaster.\n\nFebruary 16, 2016\n\nI am an easy reader to please, and am willing to put up with a lot, but this is probably the worst book I've ever read. I know some people enjoy it, and I'm glad that they had a better time with it than I did, but this was the first book that I honestly contemplated quitting after over 500 pages of investment. Interminably long, indescribably stupid, and inexcusably boring. 0 stars.\n\nMarch 31, 2016\n\n-Tan intrascendente como entretenido en su vacuidad.-\n\nGénero. Ciencia-Ficción.\n\nLo que nos cuenta. Los psiclo invadieron la Tierra hace siglos y ahora el ser humano, al que conocen como chinko, es una leyenda para ellos pero en realidad todavía quedan personas en zonas salvajes e inhóspitas, lejos de las industrias alienígenas que aprovechan los recursos del planeta. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler es uno de los humanos que vive lejos de los invasores, en lo que una vez se conoció como las Montañas Rocosas, pero que tiene tanta curiosidad por el pasado de su raza que se adentrará en los restos de una Gran Aldea, donde tendrá un peligroso encuentro que marcará su futuro y el de la humanidad. Primer volumen de la saga Campo de batalla: la Tierra, cuya edición en español de la obra original se dividió en varios libros (un número distinto según qué ediciones; yo las conozco de dos y de tres, como ésta).\n\n¿Quiere saber más de este libro, sin spoilers?
