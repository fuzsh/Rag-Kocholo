        "text": "In the Mission Earth dekology (published 1985 - 1987 posthumously), criticism of psychology is a common theme. As is criticism of corrupt power holders and drugs.\n\nBattlefield Earth (1982) explores the exploitation of the banking system for extreme profits and once again, he attacks psychology with the use of the Psyhclo Catrists who use implants and surgery to turn the Psychlos into violent sociopaths.\n\nBoth of these works are written well after Scientology gained a foothold and he is very careful not to directly include references to his religious beliefs in his science fiction works. However, it is almost certain that he used his church to bolster sales (link) and in the case of 'The Church of Scientology vs Gerry Armstrong' (1984) Judge Paul G. Breckenridge ruled in favor of Armstrong's biography of hubbard stating:\n\nThe evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history, background and achievements\n\nTaking these points into account it can be inferred that he did use his later science fiction works as a tool to further the cause of his Church.\n\nAccording to the plot description in Wikipedia on his fist novel; Buckskin Brigades (1937) (well before he wrote Excalibur which is supposedly an unpublished precursor to Dianetics) it would seem the theme of corrupt evil power holders is explored.\n\nUnfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to read any of his early pulp fiction works so I cannot comment on their content.\n\nAs for recommended reading order; that would depend on if you are interested in the Church or his Science fiction works. I cannot comment on recommended reading order for his religious works (your local Scientology church would be happy to advise you on this). For his science fiction works I would start with Battlefield Earth. It received scathing reviews but it was one of his better books and at least it is not 4,000 pages long.\n\nIt was first in 1948 he started to talk public about this Dianetics. He was short of money and had started to \"volunteered his time in hospitals and mental wards, saving the lives of patients with his counselling techniques.\" (As said by the Scientology Church, but it has been said that he probably was forced to take these jobs because he was found guilty of stealing). He then wrote Dianetics, and started using his scifi-fans as guinea pigs for his ideas about the human mind.\n\nThe only reference I have found (when writing a short school-paper on this man some years ago) of him mention Dianetics is a book he wrote that nobody would publish, called Exalibur. There is a reference of this in Wikipedia as well. He stopped trying to get it published when he started his Dianetics, so I can only guess its shares some ideas.\n\nI guess his earlier works written before he took his time exploring the occult (more of this on Wikipedia) was mainly written for money. Everywhere I looked on the net and in real books the one thing he always complained about was the money.\n\nThe wikipediapage mentioned: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard"
