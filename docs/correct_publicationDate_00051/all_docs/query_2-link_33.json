        "text": "This month, I made a deal with the devil (Mandy Albert). I told her whenever Battlefield Earth came up in the Raspberry rounds, I would cover the same movie in my own column. Well, my ticket got punched sooner rather than later, and I had to watch this stupid movie in addition to reading a bunch of books about Scientology. Apologies to reader Margaret, whose choice is next and who picked one of my favorite films of the decade-in-progress. But first, this pile of crap.\n\nNoah Cross (played by legendary director John Huston), the execrable villain of Roman Polanski’s Chinatown, shares this bon mot with Jack Nicholson’s detective Jake Geddes at their first meeting: “Course I’m respectable. I’m old. Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores all get respectable if they last long enough.” So do religions. Of the five major world religions, Islam is the youngest at a sprightly 1400 years. Say what you will about Islam, but it isn’t going anywhere, and, like Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism, it has built entire civilizations and contributed enormously to the sciences and the arts.\n\nToday, we are going to talk about a religion that is as old as my Dad. Now, he is very old, but he is not nearly old enough to be respectable, and neither is the Church of Scientology, which has its origins in the 1950 publication of Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health and was officially founded by that book’s author, L. Ron Hubbard, a few years later. Before he went mental, Hubbard was a writer of pulp science fiction during its Golden Age and was a frequent contributor to magazines like Astounding Science Fiction (whose editor, John W. Campbell, first published Dune in three installments). Hubbard’s day job as religious leader kept him from returning to overt fiction for more than thirty years, when he endeavored to write the longest science fiction novel ever published. The result was 1982’s Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000.\n\nThat novel might have languished in obscurity (like its follow-up, the ten-volume sci-fi satire Mission Earth) if not for the efforts of devout Scientologist John Travolta to turn the Master’s swan song into a major motion picture. He succeeded… in making the movie, I mean. I deliberately avoided reading Mandy’s column until the publication of this one, but it’s well-known that 2000’s Battlefield Earth is roundly considered one of the worst movies ever made. This past quarter- century it has been the butt of jokes, with ENDLESS OPTIONS FOR RENEWAL.\n\nHow did we get from a 50s self-help fad to an unintentional camp classic? It’s an interesting journey, if not exactly an edifying one. Let’s begin!\n\nSects!\n\nYou might be vaguely aware that the Church of Scientology is slightly controversial. The Church itself publishes reams and reams of books, many of them from the pen of Hubbard, who never ceased being a prolific writer. There are also loads of anti-Scientology books, many of them tell-alls by ex-Scientologists. In researching this column, I wanted to go a little deeper than the Internet, but I also wanted sources that at least tried to be impartial about the subject matter.\n\nThat’s very hard to do with Scientology. According to Wikipedia, there are only four academic monographs, one of which the same article classifies as “apologetics” (meaning the Wikipedia editor found it too deferential). In any case, I hunted down those four books and an edited collection (James R. Lewis’ Scientology, from 2009) as well as George Malko’s Scientology: The Now Religion, the first book-length exposé, which is notable for being published in 1970, when Hubbard was still alive and Battlefield Earth was just a twinkle in his eye. I also consulted A Piece of Blue Sky (1990), a polemic written by the aptly named John Atack, which has the reputation of being the best account written by a former insider. Finally, I managed to find Joseph Winter’s Dianetics: A Doctor’s Report (1951), the first evaluation of Hubbard’s method written by a medical professional.\n\nWinter is particularly interesting because he is also the author of the original introduction to Dianetics. You might be familiar with Dianetics as the “sacred scripture” of Scientology, the book with the corny volcano cover translated into a billion languages that is plastered all over the display shelves of Scientology centers. If you crack it open expecting to learn a damn thing about Scientology, you are going to be very disappointed. Like the Book of Mormon, it was only the first step in the author’s development of a new religious system.\n\nHere are some words you will not find in the first edition of Dianetics: Thetan, E-meter, Xenu, or even Scientology. What you will find is a lot of talk about the “reactive mind” and how to rid yourself of “Engrams.”\n\nDianetics is primarily an outline of a new type of therapy, comparable to hypnosis. Two dialogue partners sit down and revisit a negative memory. They interrogate this past memory until it is no longer negative, and the bearer enters a “Dianetic reverie.” Congratulations, you have just erased an Engram, a stain on the “reactive mind” that, like Original Sin, is responsible for all of your woes. Once you have eliminated all your Engrams, you become “Clear.”\n\nBecoming Clear was the original goal of Dianetics and Scientology. Eventually Dianetics ceased being a DIY home project and became an organized system. The most notable development is that talk therapy was replaced by the Electropsychometer (or E-meter for short), a doodad that, according to the FDA-enforced warning label, does literally nothing. Access to this tech and knowledge of its use requires going to classes, and in order to go to those classes, you have to pay.\n\nOnce people began attaining the baptismal “Clear” status, Hubbard revealed the potential for humans to unlock their latent psychic powers and become “Operating Thetans” or OTs. When you reach the coveted stage of OT-III, you get the packet of information about Xenu (or Xemu; he—Hubbard, I mean—spells it both ways), the intergalactic dictator who packed a bunch of Thetans around the world’s volcanoes and blew them up, populating our planet with space ghosts.\n\nThis background mythology was not part of the original Dianetics course, although it was in place by 1967, when Hubbard formed his notorious “Sea Org” and took to the ocean on a more or less permanent basis. After the manner of a Gnostic religion, this foundational story is withheld from neophytes and, of course, the wider public (Malko was unaware of it), although it is well-known today thanks to the loose lips of ex-Scientologists and the two lungs of free information: Al Gore’s infernal machine and South Park.\n\nThe constant refrain from ex-Scientologists is not that their beliefs are ridiculous or that their religion is organized like a pyramid scheme, but that Hubbard was an insufferable personality. Dr. Winter was the first victim. He believed that he had cured his young son of his fear of ghosts using Dianetics, and he remained convinced of the method’s viability after he parted ways with Hubbard for being an authoritarian dick. Many, many, MANY others would follow in Dr. Winter’s path, believing in the essential goodness of Scientology’s therapeutic aspects but wanting to modify it in various ways. They caught Ron’s bad side. His rivals engaged in questionable practices like transparency and colluded with local governments by paying their taxes.\n\nBy the time Malko wrote his book in 1970, Hubbard had already developed the “Ethics” committee to punish dissidents, a practice that remained in place (despite occasional proclamations of amnesty) throughout the 70s and into the 80s, when there was a huge purge of Scientologists and Hubbard, beset by internal dissension and external legal woes, went into occultation. What he was actually doing was writing Battlefield Earth.\n\nLies!\n\nHere is your occasional reminder that the “Lies!” section is about how a given movie adapts tenets of the featured religion, frequently in a misleading manner (hence, “Lies!”). In this case, we are dealing with two levels of adaptation. The movie Battlefield Earth is an adaptation of the novel of the same name. That novel just happens to be written by the founder of Scientology. Does this mean that Battlefield Earth is a vehicle for Scientology?\n\nNot necessarily. What struck me about the movie is how little it has in common with the beliefs and practices of Scientologists. We have aliens taking over the earth, sure, but that’s a pretty broad parallel. Closer to home is the name of the alien overlords, the Psychlos. This, as many have noted, is Hubbard’s dig at his mortal enemies (beyond the three-letter federal agencies): psychologists and other mental health professionals. The novel—but not the film—reinforces this hypothesis by introducing an upper caste of Psychlos called Catrists. Psychlo-Catrists. Psychiatrists. Very clever, Elrond.\n\nThese nine-foot-tall stand-ins for the medical establishment keep humanity in a debased and feral state. Our hero, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler—the full name is never used in the film, so I’ll course-correct—unlocks humanity’s full potential through what I can only describe as a form of Gnostic initiation. But he does it rapidly. And for free. So there’s no Scientology there, either.\n\nI wanted to know why this story even exists, so I picked up a copy of the novel and read Old Mother Hubbard’s introduction and a puff-piece interview he did for some Denver newspaper (a newspaper is like toilet paper with words written on it), skipping the long middle portion. This is the closest I came to direct contact with the man himself.\n\nHubbard gives his rationale for the novel right off the bat: He was bored, he had little to do, and he wanted to celebrate his “Golden Anniversary” with the Muse (barf) by writing a proper science fiction novel. Most of those past fifty years, he was not writing fiction at all but had been engaged in what he calls his “serious research.” The introduction is partly autobiographical (how he got into the game), partly a discourse on the history of science fiction, and it gives one the impression that all he really wanted to do was write another novel as a capstone to his career and use his (ahem) cult following mainly to promote it.\n\nSpeaking of cults, Scientology is, above all, a cult of personality. To put this in perspective, Daniel Boyarin describes “Judaism” as whatever Jews happen to be doing. Well, Scientology is (or was) whatever Hubbard happened to be doing, whether that was refining Dianetics, searching for treasure in the Mediterranean, writing more novels, or delving into electronic music. In the interview at the end of the book, Hubbard deftly avoids any questions relating to Dianetics and Scientology but enthusiastically hypes up Space Jazz, the concept album he commissioned to serve as the “soundtrack” to his book. It is to music what the film adaptation is to cinema. And what about that film adaptation, hmm?\n\nVideotape!\n\nIs the movie version of Battlefield Earth any good? Let’s see what the cast has to say about that.\n\nI am inclined to agree. It is not good. But it is entertaining. Allow me to explain.\n\nJohn Travolta and Forest Whitaker are both Respectable Actors who have done fine work in other projects. And yet they are both in this film. That’s on them: They are both Scientologists (Whitaker only fleetingly, apparently: the Internet cannot decide what Whitaker believes). They are also pretty much the only actors who understood the assignment (Kelly Preston—Mrs. John Travolta—also understood the assignment, but she only has a cameo). The problem is the assignment is DUMB. The principals DON’T understand this. It has the X-factor that separates classic bad movies from the merely bad: the sincere belief that what the filmmakers were doing was big and important.\n\nIn the transparently self-penned biography of Hubbard at the back of the novel, the pulp writer makes the absurd claim that his thousand-page brick was received as an instant classic and is considered one of the greatest books of the twentieth century. How would he know? When he moved on to his next life (Scientologists, alas, believe in reincarnation), fourteen percent of the century was still left. Tuesdays with Morrie hadn’t even come out. Granted, I haven’t read the thing, so maybe Battlefield Earth is up there with Ulysses and 1984. But I have seen this movie and listened to Space Jazz, so I have my doubts.\n\nOne person who never doubted was John Travolta. My knowledge of the production is limited (that’s Mandy’s beat), but my understanding is that Travolta, who already had a thing for pulp fiction, viewed this as his pet project. The production went smoothly, and everything turned out how he wanted. And what he wanted was THIS.\n\nTravolta and Whitaker took their prodigious talents and channeled them into a pair of performances with the psychological depth of the relationship between Duke Igthorn and Toadie. The results are astounding. Magnetic, even.\n\nTravolta plays Terl, the Psychlo chief of security, and Whitaker is his bumbling subordinate Ker. Terl considers himself a mastermind because he graduated top of his class on Planet Psychlo and can use “leverage” correctly in a sentence (Which he does. Often.). In reality, he is a dumbass. The primary illustration of this is his strict adherence to Bay’s Theorem, the principle developed by Michael Bay that it is easier to train miners to be astronauts than it is to teach astronauts how to mine.\n\nTerl sees the untapped potential for using humans as slave labor, against the views of his superiors, who think humans are too stupid for this task (Then what are they used for?! Food?!!). Terl himself seems to think this every other scene. He knows humans hunt, but he also thinks our favorite food is raw rat. He trains Jonnie Goodboy Tyler to speak Psychlo, to fly Psychlo ships, and to do all manner of other Psychlo things you shouldn’t teach someone with the means, motive, and opportunity to organize a slave rebellion.\n\nDoes Terl speak “Human,” the name given to Jonnie Goodboy Tyler’s tongue, which is identical in all respects to English circa a millennium earlier? Haha. No. Would it have been hard to learn? No. The Psychlos have Clinko language slaves.\n\nBut it would have been time-consuming, right? Nope. The language slaves just zap all of their knowledge into your brain in a matter of seconds. Terl puts Jonnie Goodboy Tyler through the process and then takes him to a library built by our rat-eating forebears so he can do even more independent research.\n\nThe apex of Terl’s incuriosity comes when Jonnie Goodboy Tyler delivers gold bars he has taken from Fort Knox rather than ore from the mines. “Why are they smelted?” Terl asks, a question that had not occurred to me because the movie’s world-building really can’t survive that level of scrutiny. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler’s response is something along the lines of “We thought you wanted it that way.” Terl doesn’t smelt a rat here. He just buys it!\n\nThis sounds like I am being critical of the movie. I am not. Travolta’s performance is a scream. Every moment with him onscreen is better than any moment without him. Unless it’s Forest Whitaker by himself. He’s great too.\n\nAlas, there are plenty of moments without them. Until the insult/homage to Blade Runner about ten minutes into the picture, when Jonnie Goodboy Tyler is first captured by the Psychlos in glass-smashing slo-mo, there is precious little to keep one entertained apart from counting the number of Dutch angles (over 9000). The main problem is Jonnie Goodboy Tyler as played by Barry Pepper. His performance is also a scream.\n\nPepper’s name was not familiar to me, but his screen credits suggest that he is actually a good actor with a knack for choosing worthy projects. Except, you know, this one time. He no doubt read the tea leaves. I suspect his multiple escape attempts in the film are clandestinely taped moments when Pepper tried to flee the set. The poor guy has to play the hero and doesn’t get to do anything fun. He’s so boring. All the humans are.\n\nWithout scenery-chewing celebrities to distract me, the film’s myriad other faults became readily apparent. Those damn Dutch angles, for one. There are more Dutch angles in this film than Dutch people on this planet. The movie could have been called Sideways. The title would have been more apt (“Earth” my ass; the entirety of the film takes place in America).\n\nThen there’s the color palette, which switches between steel blue, snot green, and puke yellow-orange. The special effects will remind you of the finest graphics the PlayStation One could produce. You might think you’re playing Warhawk or Jumping Flash! It will definitely renew your appreciation for practical effects. You will wonder how Roger Christian et al. could make the explosion of a planet-shaped object look more convincing for George Lucas in 1977 than Christian could for himself in 2000.\n\nSo yeah, it sucks. But I would totally watch a sequel.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve covered a film Tim has reviewed.\n\nIf you missed Mandy’s take, atone here.\n\nFor more Sects, Lies, and Videotape, see the Index!"
