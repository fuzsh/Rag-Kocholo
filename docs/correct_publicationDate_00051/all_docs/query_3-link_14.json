        "text": "So this movie was just on Encore and i had seen it before but i decided to watch it again. Again, thoroughly bored and i can see why it's one of the worst movies ever. What did confuse me though is that my friend says its a propaganda piece for Scientology. I don't get it. I know who John Travolta \"is\" and all the controversy when it came out and everything outside of the movie... but the movie itself just seemed like a terrible piece of Hollywood filth like most other movies that seem to be coming out. What about the movie itself is suppose to scream \"scientology\"?? I asked a friend who is the self-proclaimed expert and she threw a bunch of links at me about what scientology is and how evil it is and what its doing... of course, that didn't answer my question at all and she eventually said she had never even seen the movie. So what about the actual movie is suppose to scream out scientology? at least nazi propaganda mentioned \"Nazism\" at some point...\n\nSigned,\n\nClueless in Antarctica.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_Earth_(novel)#Scientology-related_themes\n\nScientology-related themes\n\nDuring his lifetime, L. Ron Hubbard maintained an opposition to psychiatry, a viewpoint the novel reflects by portraying the Psychlos as being ruled by the Catrists (a word similar to psychiatrist), described as a group of evil charlatans. Those among the Psychlos who do not share the views of the Catrists or oppose them are subjected to various forms of persecution; particularly, the Catrists use surgical mind control in order to maintain their power base. Hubbard frequently claimed in Scientology that psychiatrists used such tactics to maintain their influence and funding. Early in its history, the Psychlo species had no fixed name, instead being named after the Emperor of the day. The word \"Psychlo\" is revealed to have originally meant \"mental patient\" in the alien language, signifying that the Catrists feel (or in any case claim) that the entire population requires treatment as mental patients. Scientology portrays modern society as being the battleground for a war between psychiatry and Scientology for the future of humanity.[13]\n\nOne supporting character, a Psychlo mathematician named Soth, is described as having been shaped by the views of his mother. She was a member of a resistance group, referred to as a \"church,\" which held religious meetings secretly. This \"church\", much like Church of Scientology in the real world, opposes psychiatry.\n\nIn one passage of the book, a human doctor recalls a long-ago \"cult\" called psychology which existed before the Psychlo invasion, but is \"forgotten now.\"\n\nIn December 1980, two months after he completed the book, Hubbard told fellow Scientologists that \"I was a bit disgusted with the way the psychologists and brain surgeons mess people up so I wrote a fiction story based in part on the consequences that could occur if the shrinks continued to do it.\" [31]\n\nSpace opera tropes are common in Scientology doctrine. Scientology works describe intergalactic battles between alien races and a powerful galactic ruler known as Xenu. Hubbard went as far as to claim that the sub-genre of space opera was merely an unconscious recollection of real events from millions of years ago. [32] He described Earth to Scientologists as being a \"prison planet\" known as Teegeeack.[33]"
