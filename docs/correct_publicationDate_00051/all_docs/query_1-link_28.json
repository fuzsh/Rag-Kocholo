Item #11880\n\nISBN: 9781619865099\n\n\"In response to the Voyager launched in 1977, an alien race, the Psychlos, remorselessly wiped out the humans with a poisonous gas barrage, and ground and air bombings. They killed more than 99.9% of the people on Earth, not to mention their sadistic hunting sprees of people for pure pleasure for the ensuing 1,000 years. Now, there are about 3,000 Psychlos stationed on Earth, mining her remaining natural resources, and mankind is an endangered species.\n\nTerl, the greedy and sadistic Psychlo Planetary Security Chief assigned to Earth, has a selfish plan for a future of abundance and prosperity. This plan requires enslaving humans to mine precious gold in the treacherous Rocky Mountains, and then wiping out all of the evidence, including all remaining human life.\n\nEnslaved by Terl, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler must turn a small desperate band of the last survivors into a tightly coordinated rebel force.\n\nPitted against impossible odds, they must outsmart this cunning and vicious alien adversary that has conquered all opposition throughout the galaxy into total oblivion.\n\nIs Jonnie’s fight to save humanity from these gigantic, technologically superior, and cruel monsters a losing battle where mankind will become forever extinct? Or will humans regain the Earth once more after centuries of domination by the alien invaders in this high-stakes science fiction adventure?\n\nExperience the book that changed the shape of science fiction forever.\n\nWhen first published, Battlefield Earth dominated the best-seller lists for 32 weeks. A Random House Modern Readers Library Poll voted Battlefield Earth one of the Best 100 English language novels of the 20th century.\n\nThe great SF author Robert Heinlein called Battlefield Earth “a masterpiece.”\n\nThis new 21st Century Edition contains these bonuses:\n\n- Cover art by legendary SF and fantasy painter Frank Frazetta.\n\n- The author’s never-before-published handwritten notes.\n\n- An exclusive interview with the author. \" Goodreads.\n\nPrice: $9.99 save 10% $8.99"
