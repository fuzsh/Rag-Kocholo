He began his career writing short fiction winning the Gold Award in the Writers of the Future Contest, which vaulted him into prominence in the mid-1980s. His science fiction novels include the highly praised On My Way to Paradise, which won the Philip K. Dick Memorial Special Award for Best Novel in the English Language.\n\nDave has also written novels in the Star Wars and Mummy Universes, and has worked as a video game designer, most notably for Starcraft’s Brood War.\n\nIn 1999 he set the Guinness record for the world’s largest single-person, single-book signing.\n\nIn the mid-1990s he began to follow his love for writing fantasy under the pen name David Farland, where he became best known for his international bestselling Runelords series; he has also won the Whitney Award for best novel of the year for his historical novel In the Company of Angels, and the International Book Award for Best Young Adult Novel of the Year, along with the Hollywood Book Award for Best Book of the year for his young adult fantasy thriller Nightingale.\n\nDave now serves as Coordinating Judge for the Writers of the Future Contest.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWelcome to a remarkable anthology.\n\nIt’s remarkable for a number of reasons, the first of which is simply the history of how it got here. At the young age of twenty-nine, this is one of the longest-running short story competitions of all time.\n\nIt’s also a remarkable competition for what it offers to its winners. It inspires thousands of people every year to produce new stories and art. It offers the winners the chance to be seen and encouraged by top-ranking authors and illustrators in their fields. It grants significant cash prizes to the winners, and also offers what may be their first publication credits. Winners are also treated to a free seminar taught by accomplished professionals, along with an elaborate award ceremony. No other competition in the field of fantasy and science fiction offers so much.\n\nIt’s also remarkable because of the talent associated with it. It was initiated by L. Ron Hubbard, one of the greatest writers of popular fiction in the twentieth century. His career began during the pulp era of fiction, helped launch the Golden Age and continued on into modern day with hits like Battlefield Earth and Mission Earth. The author judges have included many of the best-known science fiction and fantasy writers of our time—people like Frank Herbert, Anne McCaffrey, Jerry Pournelle, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, Kevin J. Anderson, Tim Powers, Mike Resnick, Fred Pohl, Gregory Benford and many more.\n\nThe Illustrators of the Future Contest is also one of the longest-running art contests around, initiated in 1988, with celebrity judges who are no less famous, people like Frank Frazetta, Diane and Leo Dillon, Will Eisner, Jack Kirby, Bob Eggleton, Stephan Martiniere, Frank Kelly Freas, Stephen Hickman, Paul Lehr, Stephen Youll and others who’ve had a tremendous impact on the world through their graphic art, animations, and film design.\n\nThe contests have also helped launch the careers of a remarkable number of writers and illustrators who have gone on to publish thousands of novels and short stories, and literally more than a million pieces of art. In fact, a few of our judges got early starts with the contests. People like Eric Flint, Dean Wesley Smith, Nina Kiriki Hoffman, K.D. Wentworth—and myself—went up through the ranks of contest winners, became professional writers who went on to win major awards and become international bestsellers, and later were invited to become judges based upon their merits.\n\nIn the same way, illustrators like Sergey Poyarkov, Robert Castillo and Academy Award Winner Shaun Tan also started out first as illustrator winners, established enviable careers and later came to the helm as judges.\n\nEach year, we receive thousands of short stories and illustrations from every continent around the world. In the third quarter alone this year, we had entries from over thirty different countries. At the end of the year, we present the best of our new discoveries. Many of these artists will go on to have their own stellar careers, and some of them we hope will become your favorite authors and illustrators in decades to come.\n\nFinding those people has become difficult. The level of talent is so high that at times it’s hard to choose the winners. That’s as it should be. In any one quarter, we may have a mixture of great comedy, astonishing science fiction, truly creepy horror, thrilling adventures and wondrous fantasies. Which one is best?\n\nThe answer of course is up to you, in part. You’ll find your own personal favorites.\n\nMeanwhile, thanks to L. Ron Hubbard and the many other writers, artists and fans who have dedicated so much time and effort, this contest will continue to become the premiere vehicle for inspiring and discovering new artistic talent in the field of fantasy and science fiction. If you or someone that you know is interested in becoming a writer or illustrator, don’t hesitate to enter. The contest is open to anyone, and there is no fee to enter!\n\nWar Heroes\n\nwritten by\n\nBrian Trent\n\nillustrated by\n\nJON ENO\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nBrian Trent was born in a post-industrial factory town in Connecticut. He was rapidly introduced to speculative fiction through a lavishly illustrated edition of One Thousand and One Nights. As a child, he became a haunter of libraries and old ruins and developed a keen interest in both ends of history: the ancient past and far-distant future. Reading everything from Asimov to Xenophon, he began crafting his very first stories on a metallic-blue Brother 11 typewriter. After earning college degrees in English and philosophy, Trent worked as a professional journalist when not piloting expeditionary shuttles through the soupy atmospheres of alien worlds (otherwise known as going for long drives in the rain). His nonfiction writings have graced the cover of The Humanist magazine. His Writers of the Future win is his second professional sale, the first being to COSMOS, and he has since sold fiction to Apex Magazine. He recently completed the second novel in a future history series and, when not writing, Trent works in film. His website is briantrent.com.\n\nABOUT THE ILLUSTRATOR\n\nJon Eno worked as an ambulance jockey when he was a teen and as a medic in the military. He has also worked the coal mines of Kentucky and sold securities as a stockbroker. He has owned a construction company and been a consultant and is currently a critical care RN, working in an intensive care unit. Jon can’t remember how many times he has done chest compression in his career. He has worked ICU, CCU, ER and open heart, and he was a clinic administrator at one time.\n\nIn his spare time, all he wants to do is crack open a book and learn from it. Art comes naturally for him, and he is self-taught.\n\nThroughout his life, art has been a big part of his world. One day he plans to find the time to advance his skills further and learn whatever it is he wishes to do next.\n\nJon also has a passion for writing science fiction. He has one novel completed, is starting a second, and has three more outlined and ready to go. Recently, he published a book of medical humor illustrations.\n\nJon lives in a log cabin in the foothills of north Texas. He prefers blue jeans and a T-shirt to a coat and tie. He drives an old pickup and still gets his hands dirty working on his property. He is married and has a son, who is the most incredible thing he has done yet in his life. He is thankful to have both his wife and son.\n\nWar Hero\n\nThree days pass before I decide to get saved.\n\nThey bump me to the head of the list, of course, and six hours later, I’ve got a military escort from the colony tram to the facility. Shane is my tech today. He resembles a young Abe Lincoln cut out of pale alabaster, elongated limbs in the classic indigenously Martian look, and a frilly beard hugging his jaw.\n\nHe sits in the neighboring control room, hunched over his buglike monitor-spread, and gets to work stimulating my brain. His machine-prompted queries crackle over the intercom. Part friendly handball, part firing squad. My brain on TV, lighting up different branches like a blinking Solstice Tree. My head encased in the neuroreader that’s about the same as wearing a cooking colander for a hat.\n\nI flip through a magazine, watching the firework images of the Phobos victory unfold across the smartpaper.\n\nWhat are your favorite movies? Shane asks. How long did you serve the Resistance? How many times have you been offworld?\n\nYet every so often comes an indelicate prod. Do you look in the toilet before flushing? Have you ever fantasized sexually about a relative?\n\nWhat’s it like to kill a dog?\n\nI look up from the magazine, anger flashing in my thoughts like a red siren.\n\nThe pace of the questions has been winding down, and I thought we were just talking to pass the time. So I try to catch his eyes through the glass. Excuse me?\n\nThe Martian beanpole doesn’t return my stare. He hunches in his chair, hugging himself with his freakishly long arms like a Cycladic statue. In another few generations, humans on Earth and Mars will have diverged into different damned species.\n\nWant me to repeat the question?\n\nAll business, this kid.\n\nI clear my throat, uncrossing and crossing my legs. It feels … I swallow a lump. \"Ugly. Like you’re a monster, and not this sixty-pound slavering beast who has just turned your little brother’s face to a Halloween mask of red pulp. So you bite down harder on its throat. You hug it fiercely in a death embrace, knowing if it gets free, it will kill you. You think of your brother. Your fear begins to change. It turns to … revenge.\"\n\nShane looks over at me guiltily. Sorry. Machine says I had to ask. Needed to light Zone 8 back here. He taps an emerald-green screen.\n\nI wouldn’t mind having that memory erased, Shane.\n\nRemove one block and it impacts the structure’s integrity. Canned response, drilled in from his tech training. He sips from his water-bottle straw and swivels around in the chair, straining his giraffe neck to check the upload status. You saved your brother’s life.\n\nI return to my magazine. Dazzling surface captures of the Phobos base explosion parade at my fingertips.\n\nShane’s voice pierces from the intercom. In the years since, did you ever have to kill something again?\n\nJust the people here, I say, tapping the magazine.\n\nCorporal Peznowski. Doctor Javier Daigle. General Chatfield. Shane throws up his hands. Worst war criminals since the Nazis. Head cocks, curious sideways tilt. How did you ever infiltrate their ranks? The Partisans were famous for being able to sniff out a mole.\n\nIs this a machine question, or your own curiosity?\n\nDoes it matter?\n\nI swallow hard, not wanting to think of the vast setup the resistance had perpetrated to convince the Partisan ministry of intelligence that I was one of their isolationist, fearmongering, powercrat fanatics … the grotesque mutation of early Martian pride in having a planet of their own, pumped through a filter of jingoism and fundamentalism across Mars’s burnt-orange deserts. Or in the illegal torture wards led by sadistic thugs like Peznowski and Chatfield.\n\nBut Shane isn’t done. Eyes glinting in unabashed interest, he presses, How did you get that scar on your chin, Mr. Pope?\n\nI shift awkwardly in my seat. I was shot. The flechette grazed right through my chin.\n\nThat was only two Martian days ago, high above the planet’s war-torn surface in the Partisans’ tactical command center on Phobos. I had just set the last of the explosives, wrapped in CAMO mesh so they blended in with the Phobos station weld points. The timer ticking down in red overlay in my vision as I walked the glossy length of the main corridor, dizzy, chest tight. Atlas with the world on his shoulders. Below on the Martian surface, the tide was turning. Resistance fighters had finally captured Olympus, and the Partisans were hemmed in by northern and southern rebels. Their headquarters on Phobos was clamped shut, no shuttles in or out. Just me and Corporal Peznowski and Partisan generals squawking in the war room while the blue tactical map on the wall updated every few minutes with more bad news from the planet below.\n\nRed countdown to a new year. Eight minutes. Heart broiled in an adrenaline stew, flushing cheeks, sweat squeezing from my pores. It was almost relief when I heard my name shouted from behind.\n\nHarris!\n\nI turned to see Corporal Peznowski and four blue-uniformed agents rounding the corner with flechette guns drawn. The first blaze tore inches past my head, one of the pencil-thin projectiles opening my chin like a zipper, before I could throw myself through the nearest double doors. Two-minute dash to the shuttle bay. Surprising and killing a pair of guards there. Charlotte’s hackpick in hand, wresting me control of my escape shuttle—a steel-gray Thunderwing bomber loaded with medical supply freight. Shuttle dropping from Phobos to Mars’s burnt-orange vista, while the base seemed to cough behind me, flash of light, shockwave, two hundred and sixteen bodies flung out, debris streaking the bubble-gum planetside sky.\n\nShane laughs in the glass chamber.\n\nWhat’s so damned funny?\n\nHe stops right away, looking pained. Sorry, Mr. Pope. I was just thinking that most people die when they get shot in the head. You just get pissed. He checks again on the upload status. Almost done here, war hero. Save complete in seven seconds.\n\nI’m anxious and tired, suddenly needing to get drunk, get laid and pass out for a month.\n\nLet me tell you, Shane, I say, \"May you live a long life and never—\n\nI’m naked in a steel tub filled with warm water and slimy gel. There’s a small console on the wall. A glossy black camera eye studies me from the ceiling.\n\nI don’t even remember opening my eyes.\n\nMy half-spoken reply to Shane is still on my tongue, but he’s nowhere to be found. It’s like having a stage backdrop whisked away and a new background springing from unseen theatrical compartments. Knowledge floods into me, recognition springing from old brochures. I’m in a regeneration pod, where new bodies are grown for mental downloads.\n\nWhich means I died at some point following my last save.\n\nMy contract states that if I flatline on Mars, I’m to be regenerated at Bradbury station, and this was not Bradbury. Commercial clinics are bright and welcoming and filled with flowers and ferns, as if you’ve been resurrected in a Buddhist paradise. Partisan clinics are antiseptic and cold, eschewing comfort for the military necessity of getting you back on your feet as soon as possible.\n\nThis room is neither. It looks bolted together by cheap screws and spit. A place built out of rawest necessity; four walls, a ceiling, and optional towels. The camera peers down at me like a dark crystal ball. I try not to move, letting myself float in the thick water.\n\nAnd this is not my body.\n\nMy thoughts spin into a whirlwind of panic. When I had talked with Shane I was six-foot-one, one hundred eighty-five pounds, leanly muscled. My new shell is stunningly at odds with that. Shorter, skinnier, darker. Arms and pubic region covered in light-blond hair. My new hand moves clumsily for the wall console and the screen flashes to life at the slightest, dripping touch.\n\nThe first thing I see is the Vector Nanonics LifeTree logo emblazoned beside the keyboard. Not very helpful in betraying my location. All the best upload tech is manufactured by Vector. Scumbags have a virtual monopoly on the trade.\n\nThe logo clears and I see an inbox with two unread messages. The first is from me, recorded on December 13, 2274, a date which puts it three weeks past my save with Shane. But the second entry is from Doctor Traci Cucinella, recorded April 6, 2315! What the hell?\n\nI select the first entry. A strange face appears onscreen.\n\nMy initial impression is that this is a burnt, deformed old man who has somehow left me a message under my own login. His face is horrifically blistered, dirtied and ruined. Behind him is a dim, nondescript room.\n\nHello, Harris, he says through a choking wheeze, as if part of his throat has collapsed. I swallow the lump in my own.\n\nI’m recording this with the few minutes we have left. You will remember that your last upload followed the explosion on Phobos. Without their tactical center, the Partisans were finished. The Resistance achieved total victory four days later. A few pockets of stubborn holdouts in the west, a lot of groups suicided rather than surrender.\n\nIt takes until that moment for me to realize who the burnt man is. There’s no use denying it.\n\nI stare into the blistered face and recognize my own.\n\nThe monitor-me sighs in difficulty, glassy-eyed and dazed. They must have had a contingency plan to poison the well in the event of defeat. An orbital stealth platform we never knew about bombarded the planetary surface with three hundred nukes.\n\nMy stomach drops. The fledgling colonies of Mars, with all the innocence of scattered college campuses, now laid to waste?\n\nI was in my apartment when the first bombs hit. The explosion threw me out into the hallway like a doll. I remember crawling through rubble, trying to find the staircase. Some of the residents and I punched our way through the floor and got to the basement, where we were able to send a message to the outside. I have no idea if Charlotte survived. I reached Traci, and I’m recording this message on her bandwidth.\n\nThe eyes find mine—hideous funhouse mirror reflection. It makes for a queasy math in my head: one soul across 41 years, two bodies and divergent lines of consciousness in an unfolding fractal pattern like diamond gloss.\n\nHarris, yesteryear’s self tells me, I’ve been mortally irradiated, and we can’t reach any of the labs for treatment. When you get this … A sad smile forms on his melted face. Good luck. A pause. I slept with Charlotte the night before the bombs fell. Neither one of us seemed to regret it in the morning. Traci will regen you as soon as possible.\n\nThe message ends.\n\nI hit the next message, from Traci, recorded 41 years later.\n\nIllustration by Jon Eno for the story \"War Hero\"\n\nIllustration by Jon Eno\n\nMy finger is a hummingbird kiss on the monitor. Traci’s message stirs.\n\nHarris, she says, and I suck in a panicked breath at how she looks. My God! She is old and gray, enough to account for the passage of 41 years with only the most limited longevity treatments. Her myostatin blockers appear to be cranked too high, giving her a famished appearance.\n\nOr maybe it wasn’t blockers at all. What the hell had happened in the space of a single sentence?\n\nI can just imagine how confused you’re going to be when you hear this, she says. We tried to bring you back right away. But the bombardment was cruelly calculated, Harris. A second wave, much weaker and more scattered, hit a few hours after the first. It destroyed our facilities. I took the save files and fled. It’s taken this long to get our equipment up and working again. We had to cannibalize several labs, and then trade with other survivors for equipment. You can’t …\n\nTears leak from her eyes.\n\nThings have been difficult, Harris. I lost Charlie … he was murdered a few weeks ago in New Haven.\n\nSo bring him back, I think hotly. The way you brought me.\n\nTraci’s eyes lock onto mine with prescient intensity. The only city on Mars which still has a working Regen facility is the one you’re just waking up to. New Haven. And it’s not the way you remember it.\n\nMy memory hunts down a map of Mars. New Haven is a shuttle port city seventy miles south of Cydonia. It’s where, after detonating Phobos station, I had landed in my stolen shuttle and enjoyed my first victory meal of Pad Thai noodles in the mall rotunda while my guards kept cheering crowds at bay.\n\nTraci wipes her eyes with a harsh, angry motion.\n\nWe hacked you straight into the Regen list, making the system believe you were an approved regeneration in Peznowski’s circle. You’ve probably noticed by now that you are in a different body. Even the doctors at the clinic won’t know who you really are.\n\nPeznowski? My fists clench at the name.\n\nHe’s alive, Traci says onscreen. And he’s on the governing board of New Haven. Calls himself Deputy Mayor Matthew Bayne. Has a whole new body, new voice, but our AI pat-match scoured his speeches and gave a ninety-one percent match with Peznowski’s cadence, word choice, and style. Peznowski is back from the dead and practically in charge of the town you’re in.\n\nI stand up, naked and dripping synth-placental slime. The message scrollbar shows me there’s just seconds left to the content.\n\nWe need you to kill Peznowski again.\n\nAs if I’d needed her to say the words. I nod wearily, feeling as if my stomach has a bloated worm crawling inside it.\n\nHarris, we included a subfile with your download. It has blueprints of New Haven, an injectable dom patch—\n\nMy jaw drops like a collapsed drawbridge. Why in the hell would I need a dom patch? Who should I inject?\n\n—and a total workup of the body you’re occupying. We chose you because you’re a quick study. Memorize the info ASAP.\n\nWhy? I ask the monitor.\n\nTraci sighs deeply, her body shrinking. It’s as if she can hear me across time and geography.\n\nThe body that you’re in, she says, is Peznowski’s son.\n\nThe message ends. I delete it instantly, the blood pounding in my head. Then I slide open the pod hatch"
