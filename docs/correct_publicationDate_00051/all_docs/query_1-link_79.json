Frazetta was renowned for the iconic, groundbreaking imagery he created as both an illustrator and painter. Sought after by book publishers, the entertainment industry and art collectors, his artistry is featured on books, posters, album covers and in museums. Mr. Hubbard called Frazetta the King of Illustrators—a tribute to the artist’s mastery, popularity and enduring influence over the world of illustration.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nDedication\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nIntroduction\n\nBattlefield Earth:\n\nA Saga of the Year 3000\n\nPart 1\n\nPart 2\n\nPart 3\n\nPart 4\n\nPart 5\n\nPart 6\n\nPart 7\n\nPart 8\n\nPart 9\n\nPart 10\n\nPart 11\n\nPart 12\n\nPart 13\n\nPart 14\n\nPart 15\n\nPart 16\n\nPart 17\n\nPart 18\n\nPart 19\n\nPart 20\n\nPart 21\n\nPart 22\n\nPart 23\n\nPart 24\n\nPart 25\n\nPart 26\n\nPart 27\n\nPart 28\n\nPart 29\n\nPart 30\n\nPart 31\n\nPart 32\n\nEpilogue\n\nAddendum\n\nL.

Ron Hubbard\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecently there came a period when I had little to do. this was novel in a life so crammed with busy years, and I decided to amuse myself by writing a novel that was pure science fiction.\n\nIn the hard-driven times between 1930 and 1950, I was a professional writer not simply because it was my job, but because I wanted to finance more serious researches. In those days there were few agen­cies pouring out large grants to independent workers. Despite what you might hear about Roosevelt relief, those were depression years. One succeeded or one starved. One became a topliner or a gutter bum. One had to work very hard at his craft or have no craft at all. It was a very challenging time for anyone who lived through it.\n\nI have heard it said, as an intended slur, He was a science fiction writer, and have heard it said of many. It brought me to realize that few people understand the role science fiction has played in the lives of Earth’s whole population.\n\nI have just read several standard books that attempt to define science fiction and to trace its history. There are many experts in this field, many controversial opinions. Science fiction is favored with the most closely knit reading public that may exist, possibly the most dedicated of any genre. Devotees are called fans, and the word has a special prestigious meaning in science fiction.\n\nFew professional writers, even those in science fiction, have written very much on the character of sf. They are usually too busy turning out the work itself to expound on what they have written. But there are many experts on this subject among both critics and fans, and they have a lot of worthwhile things to say.\n\nHowever, many false impressions exist, both of the genre and of its writers. So when one states that he set out to write a work of pure science fiction, he had better state what definition he is using.\n\nIt will probably be best to return to the day in 1938 when I first entered this field, the day I met John W. Campbell, Jr., a day in the very dawn of what has come to be known as The Golden Age of science fiction. I was quite ignorant of the field and regarded it, in fact, a bit diffidently. I was not there of my own choice. I had been summoned to the vast old building on Seventh Avenue in dusty, dirty, old New York by the very top brass of Street and Smith publishing company—an executive named Black and another, F. Orlin Tremaine. Ordered there with me was another writer, Arthur J. Burks. In those days when the top brass of a publishing company—particularly one as old and prestigious as Street and Smith—invited a writer to visit, it was like being commanded to appear before the king or receiving a court summons. You arrived, you sat there obediently, and you spoke when you were spoken to.\n\nWe were both, Arthur J. Burks and I, top-line professionals in other writing fields. By the actual tabulation of A. B. Dick, which set advertising rates for publishing firms, either of our names appearing on a magazine cover would send the circulation rate skyrocketing, something like modern TV ratings.\n\nThe top brass came quickly to the point. They had recently started or acquired a magazine called Astounding Science Fiction. Other magazines were published by other houses, but Street and Smith was unhappy because its magazine was mainly publishing stories about machines and machinery. As publishers, its executives knew you had to have people in stories. They had called us in because, aside from our A. B. Dick rating as writers, we could write about real people. They knew we were busy and had other commitments. But would we be so kind as to write science fiction? We indicated we would.\n\nThey called in John W. Campbell, Jr., the editor of the magazine. He found himself looking at two adventure-story writers, and though adventure writers might be the aristocrats of the whole field and might have vast followings of their own, they were not science fiction writers. He resisted. In the first place, calling in topliners would ruin his story budget due to their word rates. And in the second place, he had his own ideas of what science fiction was.\n\nCampbell, who dominated the whole field of sf as its virtual czar until his death in 1971, was a huge man who had majored in physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated from Duke University with a Bachelor of Sciences degree. His idea of getting a story was to have some professor or scientist write it and then doctor it up and publish it. Perhaps that is a bit unkind, but it really was what he was doing. To fill his pages even he, who had considerable skill as a writer, was writing stories for the magazine.\n\nThe top brass had to directly order Campbell to buy and to publish what we wrote for him. He was going to get people into his stories and get something going besides machines.\n\nI cannot tell you how many other writers were called in. I do not know. In all justice, it may have been Campbell himself who found them later on. But do not get the impression that Campbell was anything less than a master and a genius in his own right. Any of the stable of writers he collected during this Golden Age will tell you that. Campbell could listen. He could improve things. He could dream up little plot twists that were masterpieces. He well deserved the title that he gained and kept as the top editor and the dominant force that made science fiction as respectable as it became. Star Wars, the all-time box office record movie to date (exceeded only by its sequel), would never have happened if science fiction had not become as respectable as Campbell made it. More than that—Campbell played no small part in driving this society into the space age.\n\nYou had to actually work with Campbell to know where he was trying to go, what his idea was of this thing called science fiction. I cannot give you any quotations from him; I can just tell you what I felt he was trying to do. In time we became friends. Over lunches and in his office and at his home on weekends—where his wife Doña kept things smooth—talk was always of stories but also of science. To say that Campbell considered science fiction as prophecy is an oversimplification. He had very exact ideas about it.\n\nOnly about a tenth of my stories were written for the fields of science fiction and fantasy. I was what they called a high-production writer, and these fields were just not big enough to take everything I could write. I gained my original reputation in other writing fields during the eight years before the Street and Smith interview.\n\nCampbell, without saying too much about it, considered the bulk of the stories I gave him to be not science fiction but fantasy, an altogether different thing. Some of my stories he eagerly published as science fiction—among them Final Blackout. Many more, actually. I had, myself, somewhat of a science background, had done some pioneer work in rockets and liquid gases, but I was studying the branches of man’s past knowledge at that time to see whether he had ever come up with anything valid. This, and a love of the ancient tales now called The Arabian Nights, led me to write quite a bit of fantasy. To handle this fantasy material, Campbell introduced another magazine, Unknown. As long as I was writing novels for it, it continued. But the war came and I and others went, and I think Unknown only lasted about forty months. Such novels were a bit hard to come by. And they were not really Campbell’s strength.\n\nSo anyone seeking to say that science fiction is a branch of fantasy or an extension of it is unfortunately colliding with a time-honored professional usage of terms. This is an age of mixed genres. I hear different forms of music mixed together like soup. I see so many different styles of dance tangled together into one dance that I wonder whether the choreographers really know the different genres of dance anymore. There is abroad today the concept that only conflict produces new things. Perhaps the philosopher Hegel introduced that, but he also said that war was necessary for the mental health of the people and a lot of other nonsense. If all new ideas have to spring from the conflict between old ones, one must deny that virgin ideas can be conceived.\n\nSo what would pure science fiction be?\n\nIt has been surmised that science fiction must come from an age where science exists. At the risk of raising dispute and outcry—which I have risked all my life and received but not been bothered by, and have gone on and done my job anyway—I wish to point out some things:\n\nScience fiction does NOT come after the fact of a scientific discovery or development. It is the herald of possibility. It is the plea that someone should work on the future. Yet it is not prophecy. It is the dream that precedes the dawn when the inventor or scientist awakens and goes to his books or his lab saying, I wonder whether I could make that dream come true in the world of real science.\n\nYou can go back to Lucian, second century AD, or to Johannes Kepler (1571–1630)—who founded modern dynamical astronomy and who also wrote Somnium, an imaginary space flight to the moon—or to Mary Shelley and her Frankenstein, or to Poe or Verne or Wells and ponder whether this was really science fiction. Let us take an example: a man invents an eggbeater. A writer later writes a story about an eggbeater. He has not, thereby, written science fiction. Let us continue the example: a man writes a story about some metal that, when twiddled, beats an egg, but no such tool has ever before existed in fact. He has now written science fiction. Somebody else, a week or a hundred years later, reads the story and says, Well, well. Maybe it could be done. And makes an eggbeater. But whether or not it was possible that twiddling two pieces of metal would beat eggs, or whether or not anybody ever did it afterward, the man still has written science fiction.\n\nHow do you look at this word fiction? It is a sort of homograph. In this case it means two different things. A professor of literature knows it means a literary work whose content is produced by the imagination and is not necessarily based on fact; the category of literature comprising works of this kind, including novels, short stories and plays. It is derived from the Latin fictio, a making, a fashioning, from fictus, past participle of fingere, to touch, form, mold.\n\nBut when we join the word to science and get science fiction, the word fiction acquires two meanings in the same use: 1) the science used in the story is at least partly fictional; and 2) any story is fiction. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines science fiction as fiction in which scientific developments and discoveries form an element of plot or background; especially a work of fiction based on prediction of future scientific possibilities.\n\nSo, by dictionary definition and a lot of discussions with Campbell and fellow writers of that time, science fiction has to do with the material universe and sciences; these can include economics, sociology, medicine, and suchlike, all of which have a material base.\n\nThen what is fantasy?\n\nWell, believe me, if it were simply the application of vivid imagination, then a lot of economists and government people and such would be fully qualified authors! Applying the word imaginative to fantasy would be like calling an entire library some words. Too simplistic, too general a term.\n\nIn these modern times many of the ingredients that make up fantasy as a type of fiction have vanished from the stage. You hardly even find them in encyclopedias anymore. These subjects were spiritualism, mythology, magic, divination, the supernatural, and many other fields of that type. None of them had anything really to do with the real universe. This does not necessarily mean that they never had any validity or that they will not again arise; it merely means that man, currently, has sunk into a materialistic binge.\n\nThe bulk of these subjects consists of false data, but there probably never will come a time when all such phenomena are explained. The primary reason such a vast body of knowledge dropped from view is that material science has been undergoing a long series of successes. But I do notice that every time modern science thinks it is down to the nitty-gritty of it all, it runs into (and sometimes adopts) such things as the Egyptian myths that man came from mud, or something like that. But the only point I am trying to make here is that there is a whole body of phenomena that we cannot classify as material. They are the nonmaterial, nonuniverse subjects. And no matter how false many of the old ideas were, they still existed; who knows but what there might not be some validity in some bits of them. One would have to study these subjects to have a complete comprehension of all the knowledge and beliefs possible. I am not opening the door to someone’s saying I believe in all these things: I am only saying that there is another realm besides dedicated—and even simpleminded—materialism.\n\nFantasy, so far as literature is concerned, is defined in the dictionary as literary or dramatic fiction characterized by highly fanciful or supernatural elements. Even that is a bit limited as a definition.\n\nSo fantasy could be called any fiction that takes up elements such as spiritualism, mythology, magic, divination, the supernatural, and so on. The Arabian Nights was a gathering together of the tales of many, many countries and civilizations—not just of Arabia as many believe. Its actual title was A Thousand and One Nights of Entertainment. It abounds with examples of fantasy fiction.\n\nWhen you mix science fiction with fantasy you do not have a pure genre. The two are, to a professional, separate genres. I notice today there is a tendency to mingle them and then excuse the result by calling it imaginative fiction. Actually they don’t mix well: science fiction, to be credible, has to be based on some degree of plausibility; fantasy gives you no limits at all. Writing science fiction demands care on the part of the author; writing fantasy is as easy as strolling in the park. (In fantasy, a guy has no sword in his hand; bang, there’s a magic sword in his hand.) This doesn’t say one is better than the other. They are simply very different genres from a professional viewpoint.\n\nBut there is more to this: science fiction, particularly in its Golden Age, had a mission. I cannot, of course, speak for my friends of that period. But from Campbell and from shooting the breeze with other writers of the time, one got the very solid impression that they were doing a heavy job of beating the drum to get man to the stars.\n\nAt the beginning of that time, science fiction was regarded as a sort of awful stepchild in the world of literature. But worse than that, science itself was not getting the attention or the grants or the government expenditures it should have received. There has to be a lot of public interest and demand before politicians shell out the financing necessary to get a subject whizzing.\n\nCampbell’s crew of writers were pretty stellar. They included very top-line names. They improved the literary quality of the genre. And they began the boom of its broader popularity.\n\nA year or so after The Golden Age began, I recall going into a major university’s science department. I wanted some data on cytology for my own serious researches. I was given a courteous reception and was being given the references when I noticed that the room had been gradually filling up. And not with students but with professors and deans. It had been whispered around the offices who was in the biology department, and the next thing I knew, I was shaking a lot of hands held out below beaming faces. And what did they want to know: What did I think of this story or that? And had I seen this or that writer lately? And how was Campbell?\n\nThey had a literature! Science fiction!\n\nAnd they were proud of it!\n\nFor a while, before and after World War II, I was in rather steady association with the new era of scientists, the boys who built the bomb, who were beginning to get the feel of rockets. They were all science fiction buffs. And many of the hottest scientists around were also writing science fiction on the side.\n\nIn 1945 I attended a meeting of old scientist and science fiction friends. The meeting was at the home of my dear friend, the incomparable Bob Heinlein. And do you know what was their agenda? How to get man into space fast enough so that he would be distracted from further wars on Earth. And they were the lads who had the government ear and authority to do it! We are coming close to doing it. The scientists got man into space and they even had the Russians cooperating for a while.\n\nOne can’t go on living a naive life believing that everything happens by accident, that events simply follow events, that there is a natural order of things and that everything will come out right somehow. That isn’t science. That’s fate, kismet, and we’re back in the world of fantasy. No, things do get planned. The Golden Age of science fiction that began with Campbell and Astounding Science Fiction gathered enough public interest and readership to help push man into space. Today, you hear top scientists talking the way we used to talk in bull sessions so long ago.\n\nCampbell did what he set out to do. So long as he had his first wife and others around him to remind him that science was for people, that it was no use to just send machines out for the sake of machines, that there was no point into going into space unless the mission had something to do with people, too, he kept winning. For he was a very brilliant man and a great and very patient editor. After he lost his first wife, Doña, in 1949—she married George O. Smith—and after he no longer had a sounding board who made him keep people in stories, and when he no longer had his old original writing crew around, he let his magazine slip back, and when it finally became named Analog, his reign was over. But The Golden Age had kicked it all into high gear. So Campbell won after all.\n\nWhen I started out to write this novel, I wanted to write pure science fiction. And not in the old tradition. Writing forms and styles have changed, so I had to bring myself up to date and modernize the styles and patterns. To show that science fiction is not science fiction because of a particular kind of plot, this novel contains practically every type of story there is—detective, spy, adventure, western, love, air war, you name it. All except fantasy; there is none of that. The term science also includes economics and sociology and medicine where these are related to material things. So they’re in here, too.\n\nIn writing for magazines, the editors (because of magazine format) force one to write to exact lengths. I was always able to do that—it is a kind of knack. But this time I decided not to cut everything out and to just roll her as she rolled, so long as the pace kept up. So I may have wound up writing the biggest sf novel ever in terms of length. The experts—and there are lots of them to do so—can verify whether this is so.\n\nSome of my readers may wonder that I did not include my own serious subjects in this book. It was with no thought of dismissal of them. It was just that I put on my professional writer’s hat. I also did not want to give anybody the idea I was doing a press relations job for my other serious works.\n\nThere are those who will look at this book and say, See? We told you he is just a science fiction writer! Well, as one of the crew of writers that helped start man to the stars, I’m very proud of also being known as a science fiction writer. You have satellites out there, man has walked on the moon, you have probes going to the planets, don’t you? Somebody had to dream the dream, and a lot of somebodies like those great writers of The Golden Age and later had to get an awful lot of people interested in it to make it true.\n\nI hope you enjoy this novel. It is the only one I ever wrote just to amuse myself. It also celebrates my golden wedding with the muse. Fifty years a professional—1930–1980.\n\nAnd as an old pro I assure you that it is pure science fiction. No fantasy. Right on the rails of the genre. Science is for people. And so is science fiction.\n\nReady?\n\nStand by.\n\nBlast off!\n\nL. RON HUBBARD\n\nOctober 1980\n\nhalf-title page for Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000\n\nPart 1\n\nPART 1\n\nChapter 1\n\nMan, said Terl, is an endangered species.\n\nThe hairy paws of the Chamco brothers hung suspended above the broad keys of the laser-bash game. The cliffs of Char’s eyebones drew down over his yellow orbs as he looked up in mystery. Even the steward, who had been padding quietly about picking up her saucepans, lumbered to a halt and stared.\n\nTerl could not have produced a more profound effect had he thrown a meat-girl naked into the middle of the room.\n\nThe clear dome of the Intergalactic Mining Company employee recreation hall shone black around and above them, silvered at its crossbars by the pale glow of the Earth’s single moon, half full on this late summer night.\n\nTerl lifted his large amber eyes from the tome that rested minutely in his massive claws and looked around the room. He was suddenly aware of the effect he had produced, and it amused him. Anything to relieve the humdrum monotony of a ten-year* duty tour in this gods-abandoned mining camp, way out here on the edge of a minor galaxy.\n\nIn an even more professorial voice, already deep and roaring enough, Terl repeated his thought. Man is an endangered species.\n\nChar glowered at him. \"What in the name of diseased crap are you reading?\"\n\nTerl did not much care for his tone. After all, Char was simply one of several mine managers, but he, Terl, was chief of minesite security. I didn’t read it. I thought it.\n\nYou must’ve got it from somewhere, growled Char. \"What is that book?\"\n\nTerl held it up so Char could see its back. It said General Report of Geological Minesites, Volume 250,369. Like all such books, it was huge but printed on material that made it almost weightless, particularly on a low-gravity planet such as Earth, a triumph of design and manufacture that did not cut heavily into the payloads of freighters.\n\nRughr, growled Char in disgust. That must be two, three hundred Earth-years old. If you want to prowl around in books, I got an up-to-date general board of directors’ report that says we’re thirty-five freighters behind in bauxite deliveries.\n\nThe Chamco brothers looked at each other and then at their game to see where they had gotten to in shooting down the live mayflies in the air box. But Terl’s next words distracted them again.\n\nToday, said Terl, brushing Char’s push for work aside, I got a sighting report from a recon drone that recorded only thirty-five men in that valley near that peak. Terl waved his paw westward toward the towering mountain range silhouetted by the moon.\n\nSo? said Char.\n\nSo I dug up the books out of curiosity. There used to be hundreds in that valley. And furthermore, continued Terl with his professorial ways coming back, there used to be thousands and thousands of them on this planet.\n\nYou can’t believe all you read, said Char heavily. On my last duty tour—it was Arcturus IV—\n\nThis book, said Terl, lifting it impressively, was compiled by the Culture and Ethnology Department of the Intergalactic Mining Company.\n\nThe larger Chamco brother batted his eyebones. I didn’t know we had one.\n\nChar sniffed. It was disbanded more than a century ago. Useless waste of money. Yapping around about ecological impacts and junk like that. He shifted his bulk around to Terl. \"Is this some kind of scheme to explain a nonscheduled vacation? You’re going to get your butt in a bind. I can see it, a pile of requisitions this high for breathe-gas tanks and scoutcraft. You won’t get any of my workers.\"\n\nTurn off the juice, said Terl. I only said that Man—\n\n\"I know what you said. But you got your appointment because you are clever. That’s right, clever. Not intelligent. Clever. And I can see right through an excuse to go on a hunting expedition. What Psychlo in his right skull would bother with the things?\"\n\nThe smaller Chamco brother grinned. I get tired of just dig-dig-dig, ship-ship-ship. Hunting might be fun. I didn’t think anybody did it for—\n\nChar turned on him like a tank zeroing in on its prey. \"Fun hunting those things! You ever see one? He lurched to his feet and the floor creaked. He put his paw just above his belt. They only come up to here! They got hardly any hair on them except their heads. They’re a dirty white color like a slug. They’re so brittle they break up when you try to put them in a pouch. He snarled in disgust and picked up a saucepan of kerbango. They’re so weak they couldn’t pick this up without straining their guts. And they’re not good eating.\" He tossed off the kerbango and made an earthquake shudder.\n\n\"You ever see one?\" said the bigger Chamco brother.\n\nChar sat down, the dome rumbled, and he handed the empty saucepan to the steward. No, he said. Not alive. I seen some bones in the shafts and I heard.\n\nThere were thousands of them once, said Terl, ignoring the mine manager. Thousands! All over the place.\n\nChar belched. Shouldn’t wonder they die off. They breathe this oxygen-nitrogen air. Deadly stuff.\n\nI got a crack in my face mask yesterday, said the smaller Chamco brother. For about thirty seconds I thought I wasn’t going to make it. Bright lights bursting inside your skull. Deadly stuff. I really look forward to getting back home where you can walk around without a suit or mask, where the gravity gives you something to push against, where everything is a beautiful purple and there’s not one bit of this green stuff. My papa used to tell me that if I wasn’t a good Psychlo and if I didn’t say sir-sir-sir to the right people, I’d wind up at a butt end of nowhere like this. He was right. I did. It’s your shot, Brother.\n\nChar sat back and eyed Terl. \"You ain’t really going hunting for a man, are you?\"\n\nTerl looked at his book. He inserted one of his talons to keep his place and then thumped the volume against his knee.\n\nI think you’re wrong, he mused. \"There was something to these creatures. Before we came along, it says here, they had towns on every continent. They had flying machines and boats. They even appear to have fired off stuff into space.\"\n\nHow do you know that wasn’t some other race? said Char. How do you know it wasn’t some lost colony of Psychlos?\n\nNo, it wasn’t that, said Terl. \"Psychlos can’t breathe this air. It was man all right, just like the cultural guys researched. And right in our own histories, you know how it says we got here?\"\n\nUmp, said Char.\n\nMan apparently sent out some kind of probe that gave full directions to the place, had pictures of man on it and everything. It got picked up by a Psychlo recon. And you know what?\n\nUmp, said Char.\n\nThe probe and the pictures were on a metal that was rare-rare-rare everywhere and worth a clanking fortune. And Intergalactic paid the Psychlo governors sixty trillion Galactic credits for the directions and the concession. One gas barrage and we were in business.\n\nFairy tales, fairy tales, said Char. Every planet I ever helped gut has some butt and crap story like that. Every one. He yawned his face into a huge cavern. All that was hundreds, maybe thousands of years ago. You ever notice that the public relations department always puts their fairy tales so far back nobody can ever check them?\n\nI’m going to go out and catch one of these things, said Terl.\n\nNot with any of my crews or equipment you ain’t, said Char.\n\nTerl heaved his mammoth bulk off the seat and crossed the creaking floor to the berthing hatch.\n\nYou’re as crazy as a nebula of crap, said Char.\n\nThe two Chamco brothers got back into their game and intently and alternately laser-blasted the entrapped mayflies into smoky puffs, one by one.\n\nChar looked at the empty door. The security chief knew no Psychlo could go up into those mountains. Terl really was crazy. There was deadly uranium up there.\n\nBut Terl, rumbling along a hallway to his room, did not consider himself crazy. He was being very clever as always. He had started the rumors so no questions would get out of hand when he began to put into motion the personal plans that would make him wealthy and powerful and, almost as important, dig him out of this accursed planet.\n\nThe man-things were the perfect answer. All he needed was just one and then he could get the others. His campaign had begun and begun very well, he thought.\n\nHe went to sleep gloating over how clever he was.\n\nTime, distance and weight have been translated in all cases throughout this book to old Earth time, distance and weight systems for the sake of uniformity and to prevent confusion in the various systems employed by the Psychlos. —Translator ↩\n\nPART 1\n\nChapter 2\n\nIt was a good day for a funeral, only it seemed there wasn’t going to be one.\n\nDark, stormy-looking clouds were creeping in from the west, shredded by the snow-speckled peaks, leaving only a few patches of blue sky showing.\n\nJonnie Goodboy Tyler stood beside his horse at the upper end of the wide mountain meadow and looked with discontent upon the sprawled and decayed village.\n\nHis father was dead and he ought to be properly buried. He hadn’t died of the red blotches and there was no question of somebody else catching it. His bones had just crumbled away. So there was no excuse not to properly bury him. Yet there was no sign of anyone doing so.\n\nJonnie had gotten up in the dawn dark, determined to choke down his grief and go about his correct business. He had yelled up Windsplitter, the fastest of his several horses, put a cowhide rope on his nose, and gone down through the dangerous defiles to the lower plain, and with a lot of hard riding and herding, had pushed five wild cattle back up to the mountain meadow. He had then bashed out the brains of the fattest of them and ordered his Aunt Ellen to push the barbecue fire together and get meat cooking.\n\nAunt Ellen hadn’t cared for the orders. She had broken her sharpest rock, she said, and couldn’t skin and cut the meat, and certain men hadn’t dragged in any firewood lately.\n\nJonnie Goodboy had stood very tall and looked at her. Among people who were average height, Jonnie Goodboy stood half a head taller, a muscular six feet shining with the bronzed health of his twenty years. He had just stood there, wind tangling his corn-yellow hair and beard, looking at her with his ice-blue eyes. And Aunt Ellen had gone and found some wood and had put a stone to work, even though it was a very dull one. He could see her now, down there below him, wrapped in the smoke of slow-roasting meat, busy.\n\nThere ought to be more activity in the village, Jonnie thought. The last big funeral he had seen was when he was about five years old, when Smith the mayor had died. There had been songs and preaching and a feast and it had ended with a dance by moonlight. Mayor Smith had been put in a hole in the ground and the dirt filled in over him, and while the two cross-sticks of the marker were long since gone, it had been a proper respectful funeral. More recently they had just dumped the dead in the black-rock gulch below the water pool and let the coyotes clean them up.\n\nWell, that wasn’t the way you went about it, Jonnie told himself. Not with his father, anyway.\n\nHe spun on his heel and with one motion went aboard Windsplitter and with the thump of a hard bare heel sent the horse down toward the courthouse.\n\nHe passed by the decayed ruins of cabins on the outskirts. Every year they caved in further. For a long time anybody needing a building log hadn’t cut any trees: they had just stripped handy existing structures. But the logs in these cabins were so eaten up and rotted now, they hardly even served as firewood.\n\nWindsplitter picked his way down the weed-grown track, walking watchfully to avoid stepping on ancient and newly discarded food bones and trash. He twitched his ear toward a distant wolf howl from up in a mountain glen.\n\nThe smell of new blood and the meat smoke must be pulling the wolves down, thought Jonnie, and he hefted his kill-club from where it dangled by a thong into his palm. He’d lately seen a wolf right down in the cabins, prowling around for bones, or maybe even a puppy or a child. Even a decade ago it wouldn’t have happened. But every year there were fewer and fewer people.\n\nLegend said that there had been a thousand in the valley, but Jonnie thought that was probably an exaggeration. There was plenty of food. The wide plains below the peaks were overrun with wild cattle, wild pigs and bands of horses. The ranges above were alive with deer and goats. And even an unskilled hunter had no trouble getting food. There was plenty of water due to the melting snows and streams, and the little patches of vegetables would thrive if anybody planted and tended them.\n\nNo, it wasn’t food. It was something else. Animals reproduced, it seemed, but Man didn’t. At least not to any extent. The death rate and the birth rate were unbalanced, with death the winner. Even when children were born they sometimes had only one eye or one lung or one hand and had to be left out in the icy night. Monsters were unwanted things. All life was overpowered by a fear of monsters.\n\nMaybe it was this valley.\n\nWhen he was seven he had asked his father about it. But maybe people can’t live in this place, he had said.\n\nHis father had looked at him wearily. There were people in some other valleys, according to the legends. They’re all gone, but there are still some of us.\n\nHe had not been convinced. Jonnie had said, There’s all those plains down there and they’re full of animals. Why don’t we go live there?\n\nWell, Jonnie had always been a bit of a trial. Too smart, the elders had said. Always stirring things up. Questions, questions. And did he believe what he was told? Even by older men who knew a lot better? No. Not Jonnie Goodboy Tyler. But his father had not brought any of this up. He had just said wearily, There’s no timber down there to build cabins.\n\nThis hadn’t explained anything, so Jonnie had said, I bet I could find something down there to build a cabin with.\n\nHis father had knelt down, patient for once, and said, You’re a good boy, Jonnie. And your mother and I love you very much. But nobody could build anything that would keep out the monsters.\n\nMonsters, monsters. All his life Jonnie had been hearing about the monsters. He’d never seen one. But he held his peace. The oldsters believed in monsters, so they believed in monsters.\n\nBut thinking of his father brought an unwelcome wetness to his eyes.\n\nAnd he was almost unseated as his horse reared. A string of foot-long mountain rats had rushed headlong from a cabin and hit Windsplitter’s legs.\n\nWhat you get for dreaming, Jonnie snapped to himself. He put Windsplitter’s four hoofs back down on the path and drummed him forward the last few yards to the courthouse.\n\nPART 1\n\nChapter 3\n\nChrissie was standing there, her leg being hugged as always by her younger sister.\n\nJonnie Goodboy ignored her and looked at the courthouse. The old, old building was the only one to have a stone foundation and stone floor. Somebody had said it was a thousand years old, and though Jonnie didn’t believe it, the place sure looked it. Even its seventeenth roof was as swaybacked as an overpacked horse. There wasn’t a log in the upper structure that wasn’t gaping with wormholes. The windows were mainly caved in like eyeholes in a rotted skull. The stone walkway close to it was worn half a foot deep by the bare horny feet of scores of generations of villagers coming here to be tried and punished in the olden days when somebody had cared. In his lifetime Jonnie had never seen a trial, or a town meeting for that matter.\n\nParson Staffor is inside, said Chrissie. She was a slight girl, very pretty, about eighteen. She had large black eyes in strange contrast to her corn-silk hair. She had wrapped around herself a doeskin, really tight, and it showed her breasts and a lot of bare leg.\n\nHer little sister, Pattie, a budding copy of the older girl, looked bright-eyed and interested. Is there going to be a real funeral, Jonnie?\n\nJonnie didn’t answer. He slid off Windsplitter in a graceful single motion. He handed the lead rope to Pattie, who ecstatically uncoiled herself from Chrissie’s leg and snatched at it. At seven, Pattie had no parents and little enough of a home, and her sun rose and set only on Jonnie’s proud orders.\n\nIs there going to be meat and a burying in a hole in the ground and everything? demanded Pattie.\n\nJonnie started through the courthouse door, paying no heed to the hand Chrissie put out to touch his arm.\n\nParson Staffor lay sprawled on a mound of dirty grass, mouth open in snores and flies buzzing about. Jonnie stirred him with his foot.\n\nParson Staffor had seen better days. Once he had been fat and inclined to pomposity. But that was before he had begun to chew locoweed—to ease his toothaches, he said. He was gaunt now, dried up, nearly toothless, seamed with inlaid grime. Some wads of weed lay on the stones beside his moldy bed.\n\nAs the toe prodded him again, Staffor opened his eyes and rubbed some of the scum out of them in alarm. Then he saw it was Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, and he fell back with lost interest.\n\nGet up, said Jonnie.\n\nThat’s this generation, muttered the parson. No respect for their elders. Rushing off to the bushes, fornicating, grabbing the best meat pieces.\n\nGet up, said Jonnie. You are going to give a funeral.\n\n\"A funeral?\" moaned Staffor.\n\nWith meat and sermons and dancing.\n\nWho is dead?\n\nYou know quite well who’s dead. You were there at the end.\n\nOh, yes. Your father. A good man. Yes, a good man. Well, maybe he was your father.\n\nJonnie suddenly looked a little dangerous. He was standing there at ease, but he was wearing the skin of a puma that he himself had slain and he had his kill-club on a wrist thong. The club seemed to jump of its own volition into his palm.\n\nParson Staffor abruptly sat up. Now don’t take it wrong, Jonnie. It’s just that things are a little mixed up these days, you know. Your mother had three husbands one time and another, and there being no real ceremonies these days—\n\nYou better get up, said Jonnie.\n\nStaffor clawed for the corner of an ancient, scarred bench and pulled himself upright. He began to tie the deerskin he usually wore, and obviously had worn far too long, using a frayed woven-grass rope. My memory isn’t so good these days, Jonnie. One time I could remember all kinds of things. Legends, marriage ceremonies, hunt blessings, even family quarrels. He was looking around for some fresh locoweed.\n\nWhen the sun is straight up, said Jonnie, you’re going to call the whole village together at the old graveyard and you’re—\n\nWho’s going to dig the hole? There has to be a hole, you know, for a proper funeral.\n\nI’ll dig the hole, said Jonnie.\n\nStaffor had found some fresh locoweed and began to gum it. He looked relieved. Well, I’m glad the town doesn’t have to dig the hole. Horns, but this stuff is green. You said meat. Who is going to kill and cook it?\n\nThat’s all taken care of.\n\nStaffor nodded and then abruptly saw more work ahead. Who’s going to assemble the people?\n\nI’ll ask Pattie to tell them.\n\nStaffor looked at him reproachfully. Then there’s nothing for me to do until straight up. Why’d you wake me up? He threw himself back down on the dirty grass and sourly watched Jonnie walk out of the ancient room.\n\nPART 1\n\nChapter 4\n\nJonnie Goodboy sat with his knees to his chest, his arms wrapped around them, staring into the remains of the dance fire.\n\nChrissie lay on her stomach beside him, idly shredding the seeds from a large sunflower between her very white teeth. She looked up at Jonnie from time to time, a little puzzled but not unduly so. She had never seen him cry before, even as a little boy. She knew he had loved his father. But Jonnie was usually so tall and grand, even cold. Could it be that under that good-looking, almost pretty face, he felt emotions for her, too? It was something to speculate about. She knew very well how she felt about Jonnie. If anything happened to Jonnie she would throw herself off the cliff where they sometimes herded wild cattle to their death, an easy way to kill them. Yes, she'd just throw herself off that cliff. Life without Jonnie Goodboy would not only not be worth living, it would be totally and completely unbearable. Maybe Jonnie did care about her. The tears showed something.\n\nPattie had no such troubles. She had not only stuffed herself with roast meat, she had also stuffed herself with the wild strawberries that had been served by the heap. And then during the dancing she had run and run and run with two or three little boys and then come back to eat some more. She was sleeping so heavily she looked like a mound of rags.\n\nJonnie blamed himself. He had tried to tell his father, not just when he was seven, but many times thereafter, that something was wrong with this place. Places were not all the same. Jonnie had been—was—sure of it. Why did the pigs and horses and cattle in the plains have little pigs and horses and cattle so numerously and so continuously? Yes, and why were there more and more wolves and coyotes and pumas and birds up in the higher ranges, and fewer and fewer men?\n\nThe villagers had been quite happy with the funeral, especially since Jonnie and a couple of others had done most of the work.\n\nJonnie had not been happy with it at all. It wasn’t good enough.\n\nThey had gathered at sun straight up on the knoll above the village where some said the graveyard had been. The markers were all gone. Maybe it had been a graveyard. When Jonnie had toiled—naked so as not to stain his puma-skin cloak and doe britches—in the morning sun, he had dug into something that might have been an old grave. At least there was a bone in it that could have been human.\n\nThe villagers had come slouching around and there had been a wait while Pattie tore back to the courthouse and awakened Parson Staffor again. Only twenty-five of them had assembled. The others had said they were tired and asked for any food to be brought back to them.\n\nThen there had been an argument about the shape of the grave hole. Jonnie had dug it oblong so the body could lie level, but when Staffor arrived he said it should be straight up and down, that graves were dug straight up and down because you could get more bodies into a graveyard that way. When Jonnie had pointed out that there weren’t any burials these days and there was plenty of room, Staffor had told him off in front of everybody.\n\nYou’re too smart, Staffor had rapped at him. \"When we had even half a council they used to remark on it. Every few council meetings, some prank of yours would come up. You’d ridden to the high ridge and killed a goat. You’d gone clear up Highpeak and gotten lost in a blizzard and found your way back, you said, by following the downslope of the ground. Too smart. Who else trained six horses? Everybody knows graves should be straight up and down.\"\n\nBut they had buried his father lying flat anyway, because nobody else had wanted to do more digging and the sun was now past straight up and it was getting hot.\n\nJonnie hadn’t dared suggest what he really wanted to do. There would have been a riot.\n\nHe had wanted to put his father in the cave of the ancient gods, far up at the top of the dark canyon, a savage cleft in the side of the tallest peak. When he was twelve he had strayed up there, more trying out a pony than going someplace. But the way up the canyon had been very flat and inviting. He had gone for miles and miles and miles and then he had been abruptly halted by giant vertical doors. They were of some kind of metal, heavily corroded. One couldn’t see them from above or even from the canyon rims. They were absolutely huge. They went up and up.\n\nHe had gotten off his pony and climbed over the rubble in front of them and simply stared. He had walked all around in circles and then come back and stared some more.\n\nAfter a while he had gotten brave and had walked up to them. But push as he might, he couldn’t open them. Then he had found a latchlike bar and he had pried it off and it fell, just missing his foot. Rusted but very heavy.\n\nHe had braced his shoulder against one door, sure that it was a door, and pushed and pushed. But his twelve-year-old shoulder and weight hadn’t had much effect on it.\n\nThen he had taken the fallen bar and had begun to pry it into the slight crack, and after a few minutes, he had gotten a purchase with it.\n\nThere had been a horrible groaning sound that almost stood his hair up straight, and he had dropped the bar and had run for the pony.\n\nOnce he was mounted, his fright had ebbed a bit. Maybe it was just a sound caused by the rusted hinges. Maybe it wasn’t a monster.\n\nHe had gone back and worked some more with the bar, and sure enough, it was just the door groaning on the pins that held it.\n\nAn awful smell had come out of the cracked opening. The smell itself had made him afraid. A little light had been let in and he peeked inside.\n\nA long flight of steps led down, remarkably even steps. And they would have been very neat, except—\n\nThe steps were covered by skeletons tumbled every which way. Skeletons in strips of clothing—clothing like he had never seen.\n\nBits of metal, some bright, had fallen among the bones.\n\nHe had run away again, but this time not as far as the pony. He had suddenly realized he would need proof.\n\nBracing his nerve to a pitch he had seldom before achieved, he went back and gingerly stepped inside and picked up one of the bits of metal. It had a pretty design, a bird with flying wings holding arrows in its claws, quite bright.\n\nHis heart almost stopped when the skull he had removed it from tipped sideways and went to powder before his very gaze, as though it had reproached him with its gaping eyes for his robbery and then expired.\n\nThe pony had been in a white-coat lather when he pulled up in the village.\n\nFor two whole days he had said nothing, wondering how best to ask his questions. Previous experiences in asking questions had made him cautious.\n\nMayor Duncan was still alive at that time. Jonnie had sat quietly beside him until the big man was properly stuffed with venison and was quiet except for a few belches.\n\nThat big tomb, Jonnie had said abruptly.\n\nWhat big what? Mayor Duncan had snorted.\n\nThe place up the dark canyon where they used to put the dead people.\n\nWhat place?\n\nJonnie had taken out the bright bird badge and shown it to Mayor Duncan.\n\nDuncan had looked at it, twisting his head this way and that, twisting the badge this way and that.\n\nParson Staffor, brighter in those days, had reached across the fire in a sudden swoop and grabbed the badge.\n\nThe ensuing interrogation had not been pleasant: about young boys who went to places that were forbidden and got everybody in trouble and didn’t listen at conferences where they had to learn legends and were too smart anyway.\n\nMayor Duncan, however, had himself been curious and finally pinned Parson Staffor into recounting an applicable legend.\n\nA tomb of the old gods, the parson had finally said. \"Nobody has been there in living memory—small boys do not count. But it was said to exist by my great-grandfather when he was still alive—and he lived a long time. The gods used to come into these mountains and they buried the great men in huge caverns. When the lightning flashed on Highpeak, it was because the gods had come to bury a great man from over the water.\n\nOnce there were thousands and thousands living in big villages a hundred times the size of this one. These villages were to the east, and it is said there is the remains of one straight east where thousands lived. And the place was flat except for some hills. And when a great man died there the gods brought him to the tomb of the gods.\n\nParson Staffor had shaken the badge. This was placed on the foreheads of the great when they were laid to rest in the great tomb of the gods. And that’s what it is, and ancient law says that nobody is supposed to go there and must not go there and had better stay away from there forever—especially little boys. And he had put the badge in his pouch, and that was the last Jonnie ever saw of it. After all, Staffor was a holy man and in charge of holy things.\n\nNevertheless, Jonnie thought his father should have been buried in the tomb of the gods. Jonnie had never been back there again and thought of it only when he saw lightning hit Highpeak.\n\nBut he wished he had buried his father there.\n\nAre you worried? asked Chrissie.\n\nJonnie looked down at her, his reverie broken. The dying fire wove"
