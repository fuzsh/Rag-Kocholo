        "text": "JD Shapiro thinks he may be the only person in the history of the Writer’s Guild of America who fought to share a screenwriting credit. “Which, by the way,” he laughs, “cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars!”\n\nThe credit – or blame, if you prefer – that Shapiro wanted to split was for writing the John Travolta sci-fi stinker Battlefield Earth, from which Shapiro had already been fired for refusing script notes from, or so he believes, original author and Scientology founder, L. Ron Hubbard, more than 10 years dead by that point.\n\nReleased in May 2000, Battlefield Earth sucked the brains of all who dared see it into the abyss of its critical and commercial black hole. It was – and still is – like a film making fun of science fiction. Travolta stomping around as a 9ft alien, with fake dreadlocks, rubber talons for hands, and ridiculous giant boots; poor Barry Pepper as a heroic savage, whose efforts to save humanity were rewarded by (or so it seemed) dropping off the face of the planet for years; dodgy special effects, laughable dialogue (“Why don't you vapourise me!”), and everything shot through skewwhiff Dutch angles.\n\nIt’s so bad that John Travolta – then one of the biggest stars in Hollywood – hasn’t been quite the same since.\n\nAt the movie’s premiere, JD (Jake David) stormed out after 40 minutes. “I asked someone for a cigarette and I don’t even smoke!” he says. “I paced a lot, I cursed a lot.” He eventually returned. When his name rolled on the credits, his friend – for a joke – leapt onto his seat and applauded, shouting “Alright Jake!”\n\n“Thanks a lot,” Shapiro recalls thinking. “You just outed me to everyone in the f–––––– theatre! I remember Forest Whitaker [Travolta’s alien co-star] coming up and going, ‘Isn’t this great?’ I was like, ‘Forest, are you on crack?! This is a train wreck!’”\n\nShapiro’s limo driver told him: “I have done this for twentysomething years and I have never heard someone trash their own movie like that.”\n\nNow, 20 years since the film’s disastrous release, I tell Shapiro that I‘ve just watched Battlefield Earth. His response is immediate and dry: “I’m sorry.”\n\nL. Ron Hubbard’s Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 was reported to be a passion project for Travolta as far back as the Eighties. Published in 1982, it tells the story of a future Earth, which has been ruled for 1,000 years by a race of aliens called Psychlos (a none-too-subtle dig at Hubbard’s real-life nemeses – psychologists and psychotherapy).\n\nHubbard envisioned the mammoth, 1,000 page-plus space opera on-screen in the wake of Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Speaking in 1983, Hubbard hinted there was interest from the movie biz in Battlefield Earth.\n\n“It was precious to him,” Shapiro says he later learned. “This was the book, out of all his books, that L. Ron Hubbard wanted to be a movie.”\n\nAs detailed in James Robert Parish’s book, Fiasco: A History of Hollywood’s Iconic Flops, Hubbard sent Travolta, a Church of Scientology member since 1975, a copy of the book shortly after publication. Travolta described it as being “like a fine wine of the genre”.\n\nBut Travolta’s career was on the first of several downswings – he didn’t have the clout to get a project of that scale moving. There was an early attempt at Battlefield Earth by producer William J. Immerman, who tried to develop two $15 million movies, with The Longest Day director Ken Annakin attached.\n\nL Ron Hubbard, meanwhile, died in 1986.\n\nWith Travolta’s star rising again the Nineties – with Pulp Fiction, Face/Off, and Get Shorty and others – Travolta talked publically about wanting to make Battlefield Earth. A potential project bounced between MGM and Fox, but – with a budget earmarked at £100 million – it was dropped. According to Fiasco, studios believed the plot was “out of date and naïve” and feared the Scientology connection would put off cinemagoers.\n\nJD Shapiro – fresh from writing the Mel Brooks comedy Robin Hood: Men in Tights – became attached following a trip to the Scientology Celebrity Center in Los Angeles (he later said, because he’d heard it was a good place to meet women).\n\nAfter meetings with Author Services – a literary agency arm of Scientology – and John Travolta, and an attempt to adapt Hubbard’s psychological horror novella Fear, Shapiro was offered Battlefield Earth. He read the book – which he knew needed work for a big screen version – and met with high-ranking Scientology members.\n\n“I felt like a cartoon character, sunk in this tiny chair, with these ten very tall people on one side of the table,” Shapiro laughs. “I said ‘You’ve got understand, there are things in this book that work cinematically, and there are things that don’t – I’m going to add things to make this a movie. I was expecting pushback but they said, ‘No problem, we understand, you’re a writer, you’ve got to own it.’ I thought, ‘This is great!’ Little did I know it was a complete f–––––– lie.”Travolta wouldn’t officially attach himself to the project but intended to play the film’s hero, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler.\n\nShapiro pitched his vision for the script to MGM president Mike Marcus, which, he recalls, was “Planet of the Apes meets World War II Nazi Germany.” He was later summoned to Travolta’s house, where he found Travolta in bed, looking deathly ill, and surrounded by people. It was a bit of Simon Cowell-style trickery.\n\n“He looks like he’s dying,” recalls Shapiro. “He says, ‘JD – cough cough – I need to tell you something…’ and he beckons me closer ‘… Mike Marcus called…’ and a big smile comes on John’s face and he jumps up and goes, ‘He wants to do the movie!’”\n\nShapiro had unusually close access to the Church of Scientology, though not without mischief. “I used to get in trouble everywhere I went in the Church,” he laughs. Shapiro also believes he was the only non-Scientologist allowed onboard the Church’s cruise ship, Freewinds.\n\nAfter writing the script, which Travolta called “The Schindler’s List of sci-fi”. Shapiro recalls three directors were approached: Oliver Stone, John Woo, and Brian De Palma. “I was told all three got the script and were interested,” he says. “Then all of a sudden it’s like a record screech – everything comes to a stop.”\n\nDuring a break at Palm Springs, Shapiro received a fax of script notes. Confused at first (“Why are they sending me notes when we’re looking for a director?”), he read the notes and called MGM.\n\n“Is this a joke?” Shapiro asked Mike Marcus. “Ninety percent of these notes are godawful! This will kill the movie. Where are the notes coming from?”\n\n“They’re coming from us,” Marcus said.\n\n“Bulls–––.”\n\n“Well, they came from the Church of Scientology,” admitted Marcus, “but we agree.”\n\nShaprio refused to incorporate the notes. Two days later, he was fired.\n\n“What I realised in retrospect,” Shapiro says, “was they were taking away a lot of what I was adding – stuff that wasn’t in the book. I’d found out from someone in John’s camp who wasn’t a Scientologist that L. Ron Hubbard had done extensive notes, so MGM was getting pressure from higher-ups at Scientology to incorporate that vision.”\n\nCorey Mandell – whose only other script credit is the 1991 erotic thriller Love Kills – was hired to rewrite. Shapiro remembers seeing the new script. It was so bad he had to take a break every few pages and hammer his frustrations into a punching bag. “This was seriously the worst script I ever read,” he says. “And I’ve read a lot of bad scripts!”\n\nShapiro spoke with a friend at the William Morris talent agency, which represented Travolta. “Won’t somebody stand up and say, ‘John, don’t make this movie, go back to the other script?!’”\n\n“Are you crazy?” they replied. “Do you think an agent’s going to say that to their star client?!”\n\nMGM put the project into turnaround, leaving it to be picked up by Elie Samaha and his independent company Franchise Pictures. The Lebanon-born wheeler-dealer specialised in rescuing movie stars’ pet projects, which enabled Samaha to save money on development and rewrites – “We pick the scripts the stars already want to make,” he once said – and bag big-name stars for knock-down fees.\n\nRoger Christian, Academy Award winner for set decoration on Star Wars and a second unit director on The Phantom Menace, was hired to direct. Barry Pepper took the role of tribesman-turned-revolutionary Jonnie Goodboy Tyler.\n\nTravolta produced and opted instead to play the villain, a corrupt Psychlo named Terl, who enslaves Jonnie in a plot to steal Earth’s gold reserves.\n\n“I’m too old,” Travolta said about not playing the hero. “Imagine me, fat as I am, running around with guns.” Shapiro wonders if Travolta preferred to hide under the costume and makeup for “plausible deniability.”\n\nProduction began in Montreal, Canada in July 1999. Shooting over the border was one of Samaha’s many tricks to keep budgets down. Reports say he whittled it down to $50 million, but it ballooned to $73 million during production.\n\nSpeaking with Den of Geek, director Roger Christian recalled “the pressure was horrendous” ­because of budget and time restraints. Though he praised Travolta for his support as a producer.\n\nAccording to James Robert Parish’s book, production looked worryingly cheap, with minimal CGI and model effects, and little preparation time given to the (terrible) alien costumes. To make the Psychlos look 9ft, they had to be shot from below. But watching the film now, it seems like a deliberate – and mind boggling – creative choice, resembling the kind of direct-to-TV tat you’d find on a low-rent science fiction channel.\n\nMarty Rathbun, the former high-ranking Scientologist-turned-whistleblower, alleged that Scientology leader David Miscavige had a hand in the creative process, and saw rushes every day, feeding back orders to Author Services. “He micromanaged that movie, for months,” said Rathbun.\n\nCritics could see Battlefield Earth was a 9ft, dreadlocked turkey before filming had even finished. Parish’s book details how security guards were deployed on the set to stop press getting access and that crew members signed non-disclosure agreements.\n\nMean Magazine obtained a copy of Mandell’s script and sent it to studios for assessment under a different title. “As entertaining as watching a fly breathe,” said one of the reports.\n\nThe Guardian reported that technicians who worked on the film had put together a mock-up poster, featuring some of the very worst quotes: \"A million monkeys with a million crayons would be hard-pressed in a million years to create anything as cretinous as Battlefield Earth\" – Washington Post. But Travolta was already talking about a sequel.\n\nAfter JD Shapiro had ducked out for part of the film’s premiere (“I still haven’t see the movie all the way through!”) he spoke with Elie Samaha on the phone. “I told him, ‘If you add two or three musical numbers to this, like Rocky Horror, it’s going to be massive!’” recalls Shapiro. “He hung up on me.”\n\nLater that year, a German investor partner Intertainment AG filed a $100 million lawsuit, alleging that Samaha’s Franchise Pictures had fraudulently inflated budgets. Franchise was later ordered to pay $121.7 million ($77 million for the inflated budget, plus a punitive $29 million and $15.6 million in damages) and went bankrupt.\n\nBattlefield Earth opened to just $11.54 million in the US. In week two, its box office takings plummeted by 67 per cent. It’s total take was an embarrassing $29.73. Travolta continued to defend the film.\n\n\"The bottom line is that I feel really good about it,” he said at a press junket in October 2000. “Here I was taking big chances, breaking a new genre… The book stood for something classic and this [sequel] hopefully will too… I am so thrilled, believe it or not, at the outcome because I didn't believe I could get it done... My whole career has been based on trying something new. If I don't try something new, I worry.\"\n\nThe film won seven Razzies in 2001 and a further Razzie in 2010 for “Worst Movie of the Decade”. JD Shapiro collected the award in person.\n\nScientology critics accused the film of devious tactics. FACTNet – founded by former Scientologist Lawrence Wollersheim – accused the film of containing \"subliminal messages to surreptitiously recruit new members from the movie audience\" and critic Mark Bunker suggested that Travolta’s book tour was a recruiting tool. The Church of Scientology has always denied having any involvement with the movie."
