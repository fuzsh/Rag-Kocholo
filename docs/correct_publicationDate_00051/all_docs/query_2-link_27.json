        "text": "May 4, 2015\n\nThe Mission Earth series is a big, bloated, fun and funny dekalogy* of pulp and satire and non-stop action. It's not a serious work, nor was it intended to be; I believe Hubbard wrote it simply out of fondness for the field, the way it was when he was beginning his career. He surely didn't need the money. It lampoons everything from economics to law enforcement to crime to space opera to science and all stops in between. It's not a particularly well-written work of literature, but is engaging and interesting and, despite the length, fairly fast-paced throughout. It was de rigueur in the publications of the field when it first appeared to vilify it entirely, I suspect both because of who Hubbard was and the old-fashioned themes and tropes of the work... not to mention the ubiquitous advertising campaign that surrounded the publication with the ever-present asterisk definition that I just couldn't resist reproducing here. However, I decided to see what all the fuss had been about and gave it a shot, thought it was fun, and read the whole thing straight through one summer. It was fun; I liked it.\n\n*A series of ten books.\n\nAugust 18, 2008\n\nI read these 10 books out of sheer morbid curiosity. Plain and simple, they are Scientology propaganda. Avoid at all costs.\n\nJanuary 21, 2019\n\nNow I finished the whole series again. Last time I read them was 22 years ago, and I must say I did not remember much (It was actually the first books I ever read in English, from cover to cover and it took me almost a year then). I will definitely read them again, but this time I will not wait so long. They are entertaining, fast and a guidebook to earth.\n\nJuly 19, 2009\n\nGreat Series of Science Fiction novels.\n\nJuly 20, 2012\n\nThis book was, I think, the only one I struggled to get through in this series.\n\nJanuary 23, 2020\n\nThis book had its moments, but overall, it was a chore to read. The end (not the ending) was painful, but I had come that far, so there was no turning back. All I can say is, \"I DID IT!\" Yes, my reading quest is complete. (Hopefully, I'm not scarred for life.) If you read this far, you more or less have to read this book. The Monte Pennwell crap at the end is a must read to say you read the series, but it doesn't add much.\n\nLooking back at the entire series, I enjoyed Babe Corleone and her mafia gang. Although she often spoke and did not listen like Lombar Hisst, she has an excuse - she saw Jettero Heller as an adopted son. So I can excuse her behavior. Hisst on the other hand, is simply insane.\n\nHeller is a complicated subject. In the beginning, I hated his smug, holier-than-thou arrogance. There were times I found myself rooting for him, but his \"my farts don't stink\" attitude kept reminding me why I didn't like him from the start. It's a shame, because he's supposed to be the hero of the story. In my opinion, Mister Calico (the cat) would've made a better hero for the story. (Heck fire, Mister Calico even fights a lepertige in this book).\n\nThe worst characters in the series (out of so many) were Teeny Whopper (the lying, nymphomaniac pothead), Miss Pinch (the sadistic lesbian), and Torpedo Fiaccola (the necrophiliac hit-man). They can not only turn your stomach, they can inspire you to quit reading. I now know why I stopped reading at book 5 so many years ago.\n\nOverall, I would say this series is a pass. There are too many other great works to read. Your time would be better spent finding an unknown Indie (Independent) Author and reading that. My average rating for the 10 books is a 2.2 - just slightly better than it was okay, but I was often generous and there were times I should have given a book or two a big fat zero. Therefore, I rate the series below a 2 (less than okay). Don't waste your time.\n\nOctober 29, 2020\n\nIn some ways this almost has to be the favorite volume... So much has gone on in this epic, so many characters in play, so many twists and turns, and you get so invested in the good characters that it is a palpable relief as the threads begin to resolve. Given the disastrous influence of J. Walter Madison and the pernicious machinations of Lombar Hist (the madman behind Soltan Gris) it is almost impossible to see, at the start, how it can possibly all resolve in this last volume. Well, that's the fun of it. And (spoiler alert), Mr. Calico survives and makes it all the way to the end of volume 10.\n\nI read this series when it first came out. Reading it again in 2020, I should add that Hubbard's observation of our society were prescient and the satire is still exactly on point. I highly recommend this series. Great fun.\n\nLastly, I listened to some of the audiobook version to see how it translated. It is pretty spectacular with all the audio effects and huge cast of voice actors. If I come back to Mission Earth again (or take a long road trip), I will dive into the audio version!\n\nOctober 16, 2020\n\nI have read this series twice, once on Kindle and once on paperback. It is so fun, so fast-paced, and written in a very digestible style, that you can blast through the roller-coaster ride and adventure. It is a fabulous piece of science-fiction.\n\nThis book is the fantastic finale to the story which started on Voltar in volume 1 and ends on Voltar in Volume 10, with two/third of the adventure taking place on planet Earth. This series was written in the 80s as a satirical look at our current society, and predictions of what was going to happen over the next 30 to 40 years. It is interesting, albeit worrying, to see that most of the predictions and observations have been borne in this now 2020s.\n\nAbsolute must-read series.\n\nIt does open one's eyes to what is happening and that we need to do something about it.\n\nMarch 24, 2019\n\nWow! I read it 4 times now. Just amazing. It has everything. Aliens, the CIA, FBO, Rockefeller, the Illuminati, Mafia, Nazis, KGB, finances, the stock market, Wal street, PR, press, fake news, media, Homosexuality, sex, politics, intergalactic warfare -- earth in its fullest picture. YOU NAME IT. It is there!\n\nThe hero is awesome, and his girl is a bombshell (but you better do not mess with her).\n\nIt is all there - everything you would ever want from such an Epic! A 1.1 million words series -- 996 characters in 10 volumes! Wow! Fantastic! I lost a lot of sleep! It is that good!\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\nI jump to this last volume before I write about 8 and 9.\n\nBecause what happened the 2nd time I read the series is that, having read the end of the story, I started understanding WHY Hubbard wrote these 10 books, and what is the purpose and significance behind it all.\n\nIt has to do with our planet, yes, but in more ways than one.\n\nThere is a lot to understand, especially when you start again after you read them all.\n\nThere are lots of things to learn, and most probably a major datum, in the mist of the fiction, satire, aliens, sex, drugs and intergalactic entertainement.\n\nGood findings!\n\nApril 22, 2019\n\nThe most wonderful thing is that this series is finally over. This book wasn’t the worst in it, but that isn’t saying a huge amount. This whole series would have been better condensed into a single volume. Definitely serious editing needed.\n\nJune 30, 2022\n\nBrilliant\n\nAlmost biter sweet in its satirical approach of planet earth. It comes so close to the real earth it makes you consider our fate. A very entertaining story. I couldn't put these down.\n\nFebruary 22, 2023\n\nThe last two books lost me a bit. I had become a bit used to the tone that Soltan Gris had been setting in the prior books and the switch in the last two lost humour that I had been enjoying. But saying that, it was great to conclude the series.\n\nJuly 19, 2017\n\nWell at least the series is finished I guess...\n\nMarch 22, 2019\n\nVery Funny\n\nGreat read. I'm sorry it's ended. Even though fiction, plenty of it is true, it rightly badges psychiatry as the scam science that it is.\n\nApril 29, 2019\n\nVery Enjoyable\n\nA very enjoyable and entertaining book. There is a very good message and it was very funny as well. I wish there was an eleventh one!\n\nNovember 29, 2019\n\nMuch of the 10 books is a waste of time. This could have been a trilogy and been much better. Books 1, 8, 9 and 10 could have been written as 3 and most of books 2 to 7 omitted.\n\nJanuary 19, 2021\n\nI’m just glad to be done this series. The first few were alright followed by a lot of messed up books. Thankfully the last two were slightly redemptive.\n\nAugust 28, 2022\n\nSeries was fun to read. Nothing all that serious, but fun nonetheless.\n\nOctober 17, 2020\n\nOur savior comes from Voltar\n\nSplit in ten volumes for editorial (and practical) reasons, the Mission Earth series can be seen as a continuous narrative whose chapters are identified by the different books. This “space operatish” saga (not a lot of space travels, but alien technological gizmos are everywhere!) will follow the comically clumsy actions of corrupted Voltarian agent Soltan Gris as he narrates his attempts to sabotage and destroy the brave Jettero Heller, another native from planet Voltar, bent on “cleaning” the polluted planet Earth to meet voltarian colonial standards. The extremely grotesque way used to paint earthlings' corruption and other... “faults”, however, becomes rapidly a double-edged weapon for reader’s appreciation and may cause some annoyance if the comments read are not thought coming from the corrupted alien venting in his journal, but from the author himself trying to slip his personal (Scientology's) propaganda into the narrative. The suggestion here is to forget the author and have a long light-hearted read, laughing at alien stupidity and their lack in understanding human complexity!\n\nSeptember 6, 2015\n\nSoooooo... broad overview. This is the tenth book of the series. All ten books are written as satires directed toward Earth's follies. I.E. Governments, drugs, sex, crime lords, ecosystem and the corruption of each. The first 5 books were a novelty, but the negativity gets old. Books 6 and 7 are when it really begins to hit you and your eyes start to roll as you put down the books more and more often. Books 8 and 9 you know what your getting into and you doggedly trudge through just to complete the series. Book 10 was pure torture. It almost seems that the satire was inadequately trying to mask the authors true feelings of all governments and newspapers and drugs related venues role in misleading, misdirecting or misinforming the population into believing whatever they want the current ideology to be. It took me 25 years to read these 10 books. Don't even think about picking these books up.\n\nSeptember 30, 2014\n\nGreat satire\n\nif you like satire and science fiction this series is for you. if you get caught up in details and have no imagination this series isn't for you. L Ron Hubbard isn't for everyone but personally I am fond of his style and his composition techniques. He is quite a strange and full character himself if you haven't checked him out. I am not a scientology believer, but this series has nothing to do with it. This series is all about calling out things he (L Ron Hubbard) disapproved of here on this rock we call earth. He basically, within the borders of an incredibly good story, makes fun of how ridiculous we can be as humans. quite funny and good. this book being one of my favorites along with the previous (book 9).\n\nAugust 20, 2011\n\nC1987: FWFTB: galaxy, Voltar, invasion, clandestine, pollution. After ploughing my way through the first nine books it was inevitable that I had to find the energy to read this final instalment.It is a big thick book with some big thick paragraphs. I knew that this series was a huge undertaking but did not know that Mr Hubbard wrote under a further 16 pen names. “Tremendous fun, great satire” says the Baltimore Evening Sun” FCN: Fleet Combat Engineer Jettero Heller, Lombar Hisst (head of the Apparatus), Soltan Gris (the nasty sidekick of Lombar. Jury's out IMHO.\n\nJanuary 3, 2017\n\nI read this so you don't have to. Yes, I finished the whole series. The first book was awful. And every book was worse than the previous.\n\nIt's a complete mess. Didactic, inconsistent, repulsive, smug. These are some of the absolute worst books I have ever read. The misogyny, racism, and \"ubermench idealism\" drip from the pages. I know that it's supposed to be satirical … but it kind of seems like the author just genuinely believes that some groups of people are \"lesser.\"\n\nFrankly, I'm astonished that they were published.\n\nFebruary 10, 2016\n\nWhile not as totally horrible as the Battlefield Earth book these aren't that great. There are some good plots themes and a sorta pulpish feel to the characters, but overall it seems to fall short of what it could be. The story seems to ramble and could have been cut by 1/3 and still got the point across. The random sex and sadistic events just seem to be placed in there not for storyline but for shock value. Not recommended\n\nFebruary 21, 2015\n\nTake all ten of these books and boil 'em down all night... no, leave it on the burner for a whole week. Reduce it too a thick dense sticky sauce. And still, this will have very little flavour.\n\nThere was the seed of a decent parody in there within the first two books then the joke was over. The joke became, \"...let's make it ten books, just so we could call it a \"dekalogy\".\n\nMay 6, 2009\n\nI am happy to have finally finished this series. L. Ron Hubbard was very obnoxious trying to pound Scientologist ideas into his readers and showing what is wrong with Earth culture using humongous exagerations. I think I might have enjoyed this series if Hubbard was subtle about his agenda."
