        "text": "Doing some research and trying to get a grip on this contest. Is it still considered legitimate? I've found videos from 5-6 years ago where authors claim that it (then) helped their careers. Their anthology is still a SFWA qualifier. But on the other hand, there are some ominous articles out there about their connections to Scientology. And when I checked the Amazon page for their latest anthology, Anne McCaffrey is listed as a judge, though she hasn't been with us these past seven years. Any constructive input much appreciated (and please no blanket anti-religious responses; I'm an atheist myself but to each her own). Thanks!\n\nPS searched but didn't find any similar threads on Chrons. Apologies if this is a tired trope\n\nI'll let you decide what you think from this information, courtesy of Wikipedia.\n\nThe original sponsor of the contest was Bridge Publications, Inc., the publishing arm of the Church of Scientology. Prior to the 2004 contest, the sponsorship moved to Author Services Inc. under the trade name Galaxy Press, which was spun off from Bridge to publish Hubbard's fiction and the contest anthologies.\n\nThe contest has also been characterized as a promotional vehicle for Hubbard himself, who returned to science fiction writing with Battlefield Earth at about the same time as he began the contest. On the covers of the annual WOTF anthologies, Hubbard's name appears \"above the title\", and in at least as prominent a font. The prominence of Hubbard's name and the lavish funding of the contest awards, publicity and ceremonies have led some to speculate that the contest is part of a campaign by the Church of Scientology to promote Hubbard's status in the science fiction and literary communities.\n\nEntering or winning the contest does not require or imply endorsement or membership in the Church of Scientology, and the contest itself has been endorsed by a wide range of well-known speculative fiction writers (see Judges and Winners above) who have no relationship to Scientology.\n\nAccording to Director of the Writers and Illustrators Contests Joni Labaqui, the funds to underwrite the contest—including the cash prizes, the gala awards ceremony and the weeklong pre-awards festivities—come from the Hubbard estate. The Hubbard estate is separate from the Church of Scientology and earns royalties from sales of Hubbard's books, including his fiction. Labaqui also reports that staff of Author Services Inc. is entirely made up of Scientologists.\n\nSo, there is some connection to Scientology, and the contest certainly gives the name of the late L. Ron Hubbard a lot of publicity, but you don't have to agree with that religion or admire that person to enter the contest, which, other than the association noted above, seems entirely legitimate.\n\nHave you read any of the books? I recommend doing so - you'll see the quality of the stories. Two of my favourites are Stars That Make Dark Heaven Light by Sharon Joss and Switch by Steve Pantazis - both from issue 31. Many recent WotF authors continue to be published in other top SFWA markets. It's still considered one of the best launching pads for new writers.\n\nThe current judges are some of the top names in the science fiction and fantasy field - and I don't know how many (if any) are Scientologists. The slush-pile reader (and also million-selling-author), David Farland, is mormon - it's not like you have to be a Scientologist to be a judge or anything. There's no entry fee, and a great prize. One of my aims in the next year is to get an Honorable Mention, and then hopefully the next step...\n\nThe Illustrators of the Future contest runs alongside it too - and again features some excellent artists.\n\nSo yes, legitimate in my book!\n\nTo a certain extent it depends on why you enter. In my case I used the quarterly competitions as aim points for getting individual chapters of my novel drafted. And yes the novel got written. Along the way I collected Honourable Mentions for eight out of the nine chapters I entered. Yes, I know chapters are not short stories, which is where I would lost some marks. In all my dealings with them, I have never had any reason to complain and there was certainly no mention of scientology. My advice, if you think it's going help your writing in whatever way, then enter.\n\nIt's your call, and I don't want to preach here, but just the name of Hubbard alone sounds alarm bells to me. Even if there is no longer any technical or legal connection to Scientology, why is this contest named for him, an otherwise mediocre writer, when that cult is by far his largest claim to fame (or notoriety)? I'm not suggesting conspiracy or deception (not that it would surprise me) but I am suggesting a character like Hubbard is the last person who warrants or deserves a literary competition in his \"honour\", and on principle alone I, personally, wouldn't go within a lightyear of it. This contest contributes to the name and posthumous reputation of Hubbard, which effectively contributes to the name of Scientology.\n\nThere are hundreds of competitions a year, and loads of ways to gain exposure and network. A contest named after that guy shouldn't be one of them. I would find another contest."
