        "text": "About the Book\n\nSadistic Aliens loom...\n\nNoble humans rise...\n\nIs it the end or a new beginning?\n\nBattlefield Earth is an enormous epic of adventure set in the year 3000, when the future survival of what's left of the human race is at stake. When Jonnie Goodboy Tyler decides to venture out of the small and dwindling community of humans barely surviving in their Rocky Mountain retreat, he has no thought of challenging the order that for a thousand years has held the earth prisoner to the oppressive alien race of the Psychlos.\n\nThe Psychlos and their vast intergalactic mining corporation have dominated and exploited all known galaxies for centuries, ruthlessly destroying races who dare to resist. How one man - with the aid of a few surviving Scotsmen--tackles the greatest malignant power in the universe makes for a sprawling adventure of thrilling heroics, full of dangerous underground work, interplanetary wars, intergalactic financial intrigue, monster races, and complex political manipulation spread across a vast canvas of epic scale.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nSadistic Aliens loom...\n\nNoble humans rise...\n\nIs it the end or a new beginning?\n\nBattlefield Earth is an enormous epic of adventure set in the year 3000, when the future survival of what's left of the human race is at stake.

It's a real page-turner.\" --Rocky Mountain News\n\n\"In the year 3000, Earth has been conquered by nine-foot-tall, gas-breathing alien invaders called Psychlos. The few surviving humans are treated as nothing more than pack animals worked to death mining the Earth of all its resources.

Ron Hubbard is among the most acclaimed and widely read authors of our time. As a leading light of American Pulp Fiction through the 1930s and '40s, he is further among the most influential authors of the modern age. Indeed, from Ray Bradbury to Stephen King, there is scarcely a master of imaginative tales who has not paid tribute to L. Ron Hubbard."
