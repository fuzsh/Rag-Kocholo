        "text": "Today’s Wiki-est Amazonian Googlies\n\nAcross\n\n1 Tie with a cord : BOLO\n\nI’ve never worn a bolo tie, and was surprised to discover that it is a relatively recent invention. The first bolo tie was apparently produced in Wickenburg, Arizona in the late 1940s by a silversmith. The bolo takes its name from the boleadora, an Argentine lariat.\n\n5 Unctuous flattery : SMARM\n\nThe word “smarm” describes insincere flattery. The term comes from a colloquial word “smalm” that was used in the mid-19th century to mean “smear the hair with some sort of styling product”.\n\nA person described as “unctuous” is oily and insincere. “Unctum” is the Latin for “ointment”.\n\n16 Animated garden snail who dreams of racing in the Indy 500 : TURBO\n\n“Turbo” is a 2013 computer-animated sports comedy film about a garden snail (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) who dreams of becoming the greatest racer in the world. The snail is named Theo, although he prefers “Turbo”, a nickname he gave himself. Spoiler alert: Theo attains his dream by winning the Indy 500.\n\n17 The MLB’s Angels, to fans : HALOS\n\nThe Anaheim Angels baseball team is today more correctly called the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (LAA). The “Angels” name dates back to 1961 when the team was founded in the “City of Angels”, Los Angeles. When the franchise moved to Anaheim in 1965 they were known as the California Angels, then the Anaheim Angels, and most recently the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The Angels are also known as “the Halos”.\n\n18 Specialty concerned with player experience : GAME DESIGN (giving “Love Is a Game”)\n\n“Love Is a Game” is a song from Adele’s 2021 studio album “30”. It is in fact the album’s closing track.\n\n20 Greek yogurt brand : OIKOS\n\nOikos is a brand of Greek yogurt made by Danone.\n\n21 Henna, for one : DYE\n\nHenna has been used for centuries as a dye, for leather and wool as well as hair and skin. In modern days, henna is often used for temporary tattoos.\n\n25 DIY publication : ZINE\n\nA zine is a magazine. The term “zine” is often reserved for noncommercial publications, including those issued online.\n\n27 MRI output : SCAN\n\nMRI scans can be daunting for many people as they usually involve the patient lying inside a tube with the imaging magnet surrounding the body. Additionally, the scan can take up to 40 minutes in some cases. There are some open MRI scanners available that help prevent a feeling of claustrophobia. However, the images produced by open scanners are of lower quality as they operate at lower magnetic fields.\n\n29 Leadership styles that encourage transparency : OPEN-DOOR POLICIES (giving “Love Is an Open Door”)\n\n“Love Is an Open Door” is a romantic duet from the 2013 animated feature film “Frozen”. It is performed by Kristen Bell as Anna, and by Santino Fontanan as Prince Hans.\n\n36 PC file suffix : EXE\n\nIn the Windows operating system, a file with the extension “.exe” is an “executable” file.\n\n37 Slalom marker : GATE\n\n“Slalom” is an anglicized version of the Norwegian word “slalam” that translates as “skiing race”. There is a longer version of the traditional slalom that is called giant slalom\n\n40 Egg-shaped tomato : ROMA\n\nThe Roma tomato isn’t considered an heirloom variety but it is very popular with home gardeners, especially those gardeners that don’t have a lot of space. It is a bush type (as opposed to vine type) and needs very little room to provide a lot of tomatoes.\n\n46 “Dude … ” : BRO …\n\nOur term “dude” arose as slang in New York City in the 1880s, when it was used to describe a fastidious man. In the early 1900s, the term was extended to mean “city slickers”, easterners who vacationed in the West. The first use of the term “dude ranch” was recorded in 1921.\n\n48 John Travolta film that won nine Razzies, including Worst Picture of the Decade : BATTLEFIELD EARTH (giving “Love Is a Battlefield”)\n\n“Battlefield Earth” is a 2000 sci-fi film based on a 1982 novel of the same name by L. Ron Hubbard. A lot of controversy accompanied the release of the film. It stars John Travolta, who had been trying to get the film made since the mid-1990s. Travolta is a noted Scientologist, and the book’s author L. Ron Hubbard was the founder of Scientology. Critics of Scientology labeled the movie as a recruitment tool for the church.\n\n“Razzie” is the familiar name for the Golden Raspberry Award, an award presented annually for the worst in the world of film. The Razzies have been presented on the day before the Oscars since 1981.\n\n“Love Is a Battlefield” is a 1983 song released by Pat Benatar. The song’s music video was also a hit. It features Benetar as a rebellious teenager, and was one of the first music videos to include dialogue. As the video opens, Banatar’s “father” shouts out, “If you leave this house now, you can just forget about coming back!”\n\n54 Single __ whisky : MALT\n\nSingle malt whisky is made from malted barley and distilled at a single distillery. It is typically aged for at least three years in oak casks. Single malts are typically more expensive than blended whiskies, as they are made from a single type of barley and are aged for a longer period of time.\n\n56 Free, as legal work : PRO BONO\n\nThe Latin term “pro bono publico” means “for the public good”, and is usually shortened to “pro bono”. The term applies to professional work that is done for free or at a reduced fee as a service to the public.\n\n60 Rideshare alternative : CAB\n\nA hansom cab is a very specific design of horse and buggy that was patented by Joseph Hansom in 1834 in England. The “cab” in the name is short for “cabriolet”, an earlier design of carriage on which the hansom was based. It’s from “hansom cab” that we get our modern term “cab”.\n\n63 Ames resident : IOWAN\n\nThe Iowa city of Ames was founded as a stop on the Cedar Rapids and Missouri Railroad in 1864. It was named for US Congressman Oakes Ames from the state of Massachusetts in honor of the role that Ames played in the building of the transcontinental railroad.\n\n64 1993 dance hit, and a musical question answered by the starts of 18-, 29-, and 48-Across? : WHAT IS LOVE and WHAT IS LOVE?\n\n“What Is Love” was a big hit around the world in 1993 for Trinidadian-German singer Haddaway. It is described as a Eurodance number, but I don’t know what that means. Regardless, I quite like “What Is Love” …\n\n69 Niagara River source : ERIE\n\nThe mighty Niagara River flows from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, and forms part of the border between the US and Canada. The river is only about 35 miles long, so some describe it as a “strait”. It has a drop in elevation of 325 feet along its length, with 165 feet of that drop taking place at Niagara Falls.\n\nDown\n\n1 Mavs’ city : BIG D\n\nThe Mavericks (also “Mavs”) are an NBA franchise in Dallas, Texas. The team was founded in 1980, and the Mavericks name was chosen by fan votes. The choice of “Mavericks” was prompted by the fact that the actor James Garner was a part-owner of the team, and Garner of course played the title role in the “Maverick” television series.\n\n4 Lorca work : ODE\n\nGarcía Lorca was a Spanish poet and dramatist. He is as famous for his poems and his plays as he is for the circumstances of his death. Although it has never been irrefutably proven, many believe that Lorca was shot and killed while in the custody of Nationalist militia, one month after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.\n\n5 Vinyl lover’s setup : STEREO\n\nMonophonic sound (“mono”) is sound reproduced using just one audio channel, which is usually played out of just one speaker. Stereophonic sound is reproduced using two audio channels, with the sound from each channel played out of two different speakers. The pair of stereo speakers are usually positioned apart from each other so that sound appears to come from between the two. Quadraphonic sound (4.0 surround sound) uses four audio channels with the sound played back through four speakers that are often positioned at the corners of the room in which one is listening.\n\n6 Euterpe, to musicians : MUSE\n\nEuterpe was the Muse presiding over music in Greek mythology. In later times, she was honored as the Muse of lyric poetry.\n\n7 “Casta diva,” e.g. : ARIA\n\n“Norma” is an opera written by Vincenzo Bellini that was first performed in 1831. One aria from the work is “Casta diva”, which is one of the most popular arias of the 1800s.\n\n8 Justice impersonated by Kate McKinnon on “SNL” : RBG\n\nAssociate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (RBG) served on the US Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg was the second woman to join the Court, and was nominated by President Bill Clinton. She was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1999 and underwent surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. During that time she did not miss one day on the bench. In 2009 Justice Ginsburg had surgery for pancreatic cancer, and was back to work 12 days later. She had left-lung lobectomy to remove cancerous nodules in 2018, which forced Justice Ginsburg to miss oral argument in January 2019, for the first time since joining the court 25 years earlier. She finally succumbed to pancreatic cancer in 2020. Much of Ginsburg’s life is recounted in the excellent 2018 movie “On the Basis of Sex”.\n\nComedian and impressionist Kate McKinnon’s career took off when she became a cast member of “Saturday Night Live” (SNL) in 2013. Famously, McKinnon portrayed Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. She also co-starred in the 2016 reboot of the movie “Ghostbusters”, playing Dr. Jillian Holtzmann.\n\n9 Grand Prix locale : MONACO\n\nThe Principality of Monaco is on the Mediterranean coast, and is otherwise surrounded by France, even though it is just under 10 miles from the Italian border. Monaco is the world’s most densely populated country, and the world’s second smallest country (the smallest being Vatican City). The principality has been very prosperous since the late 1800s, with the economy given a tremendous boost with the opening of several gambling casinos.\n\nEven though the term is used in many competitions, I think that we most associate “Grand Prix” with the series of Formula One motor races. These Formula One Grand Prix races trace their roots back to organized automobile road races from one French town to the next that date back to 1894. “Grand Prix” translates from French as “grand, big prize.”\n\n10 Most populous U.S. state capital : PHOENIX\n\nPhoenix is the capital of the state of Arizona. The city started out as a farming community founded by a Civil War veteran. Key to the success of the community was the construction of canals that were really contemporary improvements to canals that had previously been built by the local Hohokam people.\n\n12 Basic substance : ALKALI\n\nThe “opposite” of an acid is a base. Acids turn litmus paper red, and bases turn it blue. Acids and bases react with each other to form salts. An important subset of the chemicals called bases are alkalis, hydroxides of the alkali metals and of ammonium. The term “alkali” is sometimes used interchangeably with “base”, especially if that base is readily soluble in water.\n\n13 Knuckle-headed antic? : NOOGIE\n\nA noogie is a childish move in which someone rubs his (and it’s always a guy!) knuckles into a person’s head to create a little soreness.\n\n24 Driving force in fine dining? : VALET\n\nA varlet was an attendant or servant, and perhaps a knight’s page. The term “varlet” comes from the Old French “vaslet” meaning “squire, young man”. “Vaslet” also gave us our contemporary word “valet”. The term “varlet” came to be pejorative, describing an unprincipled person.\n\n29 Texter’s “Crikey!” : OMG!\n\n“Crikey!” is an exclamation, and is probably a euphemism for “Christ”.\n\n30 Samosa vegetable : PEA\n\nA samosa is quite the tasty appetizer. It is usually a triangular-shaped savory that often has a vegetarian filling. The word “samosa” is primarily used on Indian menus, and the name comes from “sanbosag”, the name for the dish in Persia.\n\n31 Unit of resistance : OHM\n\nThe unit of electrical resistance is the ohm (with the symbol omega) named after German physicist Georg Simon Ohm. Ohm was the guy who established experimentally that the amount of current flowing through a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage applied, (V=IR) a relationship that every school kid knows as Ohm’s Law.\n\n32 Trix mascot : RABBIT\n\n33 Trix, e.g. : CEREAL\n\nTrix is a corn-based breakfast cereal that has been around since 1954, produced by General Mills. Ads for the cereal featured Trix Rabbit, who would try hard to get hold of bowls of the cereal. He would always get caught though, and be admonished with, “Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!” With 46% sugar content, the rabbit probably wouldn’t have liked it anyway …\n\n39 Early ISP : AOL\n\nAOL was a leading Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the 1980s and 1990s. The company does still provide dial-up access to the Internet for some subscribers, but most users now access AOL using faster, non-AOL ISPs.\n\n42 Summer hrs. in the Navajo Nation : MDT\n\nThe Navajo Nation of the Southwestern US is the largest Native-American tribe in the country. The Navajo reservation is located in the Four Corners region and is the largest reservation in the US, covering over 27,000 square miles.\n\n45 Polvorones nuts : ALMONDS\n\nPolvoróns are shortbreads that are popular in Spain and Spanish-influenced countries. Key ingredients are flour, sugar, milk and almonds (although other nuts can also be used). They are very crumbly, and the name “polvorón” comes from the Spanish “polvo” meaning “powder, dust”.\n\n47 Dr. for kids? : SEUSS\n\n“Dr. Seuss” was the pen name of Theodor Seuss Geisel. Geisel first used the pen name while studying at Dartmouth College and at the University of Oxford. Back then, he pronounced “Seuss” as it would be in German, i.e. rhyming with “voice”. After his books found success in the US, he went with the pronunciation being used widely by the public, quite happy to have a name that rhymes with “Mother Goose”.\n\n48 Hasbro toys that issue commands : BOP ITS\n\nBop It is a line of toys with a speaker that issues commands to activate input devices on the toy, devices such as handles, cranks, wheels and switches. The commands come in a series of increasing length, and at increasing speed. So, I guess Bop It is a test of memory and dexterity.\n\n49 High lights? : AURORA\n\nThe spectacular aurora phenomenon is seen lighting up the night sky at both poles of the earth (the Aurora Borealis in the north, and the Aurora Australis in the south). The eerie effect is caused by charged particles colliding with atoms at high latitudes.\n\n52 Extras in “Star Wars” films : DROIDS\n\n“Droid” is short for “android” and is used to describe a robot that resembles a human. The Latin word “androides” was used in English in the 18th century to mean “like a man”. Science fiction writers introduced us to “android” in the early 1950s.\n\n57 Curse : BANE\n\nToday, we tend to use the word “bane” to mean “anathema, a source of persistent annoyance”. A few centuries ago, a bane was a cause of harm or death, perhaps a deadly poison.\n\n62 Nectar collectors : BEES\n\nThe sugary liquid known as nectar is produced by plants to attract animals needed for the plant’s survival. The classic example is the nectar produced in flowers that attracts insects needed to facilitate pollination. Some plants produce nectar in leaves that attracts favorable insects that in turn prey on insects that can harm the plants.\n\n65 Med. network : HMO\n\nHealth Maintenance Organization (HMO)\n\n66 Hall of Fame MLB manager Durocher : LEO\n\nBaseball player and manager Leo Durocher was noted for being outspoken, and was given the nickname “Leo the Lip”. In 1946, while he was manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Durocher expressed the opinion that teams like his successful Dodgers would always do better than teams replete with personable individuals (naming Mel Ott in particular). He used his most memorable phrase to encapsulate the sentiment … “nice guys finish last”."
