        "text": "The book is decoratively bound in brown leather with gilt page edges, decorative gilt on boards, and raised spine bands, and housed in the slipcase, this modern volume is a scarce author signed edition of this book written by the founder of Scientology. This volume is a limited edition, number 357 of 500. L. Ron Hubbard was an American science fiction author who developed a self-help system called Dianetics, which was first published in 1950.\n\nOver the following three decades, Hubbard developed his self-help ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and rituals as part of a new religion he called Scientology. Hubbard's writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration, literacy and drug rehabilitation. The volume shows beautifully, with a few very small nicks on the top of the spine, and is solidly bound with clean, crisp pages. The leather slipcase also shows very well, with bright gilt embossing on the front board. The book measures approximately 6.5\" x 9\" and contains 819 pages."
