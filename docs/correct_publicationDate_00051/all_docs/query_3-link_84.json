        "text": "As art director on Life of Brian I witnessed first hand religious censorship when the finance was withdrawn on grounds of blasphemy. It was later that George Harrison who saw the script for what it was, fully funded it. Martin Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ caused a similar outcry, severely damaging its release. Christians were objecting to the way that the life of Christ was being depicted in the movie.\n\nJohn Travolta and I have been questioned by almost every journalist about the connection between Battlefield Earth and the Church of Scientology. This is a presumption made because L. Ron Hubbard, the author of the novel on which the movie is based wrote Dianetics and founded the Church of Scientology of which John Travolta is a member. Hubbard wrote the following in the preface to the novel, worried that he would be blamed by members of the Church for not including any of its beliefs and philosophies: 'I know that I will be accused of not including any of my serious work in this book, but I have put on my professional writers hat and written a science fiction novel.'\n\nIn 1982 science fiction was mostly about the cold technical world of robots and computers. Hubbard wanted to write a fast-paced, Pulp Fiction style tale of villains and heroes, with the archetypal hero's journey at its heart. He was the biggest selling author of pulp-fiction of his era and Stephen King calls Fear - another of his novels - 'a classic of its genre'.\n\nI was offered the script of Battlefield Earth due to a combination of my film Nostradamus and my experience on Episode I: Phantom Menace and other Star Wars movies. What director would turn down the chance to work with John Travolta? So accepting a near impossible schedule and low budget restraints, I set out to try to pull off something unusual, aware that science fiction usually receives a lukewarm critical reception.\n\nIn America the inference is that Battlefield Earth contains scientology's philosophy and that subliminal messages are buried in the film. It is also suggested that revenues from the movie will somehow end up in the Church. This is not true.\n\nTo set the record straight, I am not a member of the Church of Scientology, nor, to my knowledge is any other member of the crew. The film was put together and produced by John Travolta's manager Jonathon Krane and entirely funded by Eli Samaha, both Jewish, and distributed by Warner Brothers. I believe we all have a right to choose whichever philosophy or religion fulfils our needs.\n\nIf a Jewish producer hired a Jewish writer to write a script, and then hired a Jewish director to make the film, do we cry 'Judaism' or judge the film for what it is?\n\nThe second myth put over in the US which I wish to dispel is that the movie cost $75-100 million dollars. I only had $14m for production and $9m for the special effects. When I directed the second unit for Phantom Menace, the special effects budget alone was $60m. The total Battlefield Earth budget including above the line costs is $51m, less than the cost of the sets of an average studio sci-fi action film. We grossed $12.5m on our opening weekend with a quarter of the advertising budget of any rival studio picture. With the entire budget of the film covered by foreign pre-sales, the US box office is already showing a $20m dollar profit.\n\nThe movie is obviously not to everyone's taste. Our decision was to follow the book closely and make the movie into a fast-paced comic strip with an ironic side to it. It's been labelled 'pulp science fiction'. Every shot in the movie was 'dutch-angled' (the camera was always slightly tilted in the way that comic illustrations are never level). George Lucas, Billy Bob Thornton and Quentin Tarantino have all told us how much they loved the movie. Tarantino told John Travolta that it would become a cult classic. They and the bulk of the audiences who have seen the movie so far, have enjoyed it for what it is - comic strip fun without pretension."
