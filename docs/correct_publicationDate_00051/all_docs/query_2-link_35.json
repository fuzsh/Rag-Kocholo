For many Dragon Con fans, the quality of the cosplay and costuming distinguishes this one convention from all the others. Under Pat Henry’s leadership, Dragon Con has become one of the largest pop culture conventions in the nation, based on attendance. The convention attracted over 77,000 unique individuals (over 250,000 turnstile) for the thirtieth anniversary in 2016. Over nearly three decades, Dragon Con has grown from the little Atlanta convention that defied the rules to one of the largest pop culture conventions in the world. Along the way, it changed the expectations for a successful convention. While small conventions still focus on one or two genres, the largest conventions combine literature, television and movies, comics and gaming, just as Dragon Con did for the first time back in 1986.

Ron Hubbard created the Writers of the Future Contest (www.writersofthefuture.com) in 1983 to provide a means for aspiring writers of speculative fiction to get that much-needed break. Due to the success of the Writing Contest, the companion Illustrators of the Future Contest was created in 1988.\n\nThe intensive mentoring process has proven very successful. The 380 past winners of the Writing Contest have published 1,150 novels and 4,450 short stories. The contests have produced 32 New York Timesbestsellers. Collectively, the winners of the contests have sold over 53 million books over the years. The 310 past winners of the Illustrating Contest have produced over 4,500 illustrations, 356 comic books, graced 594 books and albums with their art and visually contributed to 36 television shows and 46 major movies."
