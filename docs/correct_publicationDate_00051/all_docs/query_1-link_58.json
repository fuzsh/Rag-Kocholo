        "text": "L. Ron Hubbard\n\nAudio Book (Cassette). Condition: used. Review Battlefield Earth is a magnificent, sprawling 820-page, \"Star Wars\"-type novel, lavishly written with wit and adventure and the occasional curlicue in plot. This also is a novel featuring the most deliciously despicable villain of all times, the insidious Terl, member of a master race, genius, eccentric, and certifiably psychotic. (You can tell when Terl is up to something nasty by his chuckle.) Terl is introduced to the reader with the near-prophetic words, \"Man is an endangered species.\" The story is set in the year 3000. Our civilization had been wiped out centuries earlier by a malevolent race of conquerers known as the Psychlos, who establish a mining colony on the planet. The handful of humans remaining are considered little better than animals. Think of the \"Star Wars\" sagas, and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" mix in the triumph of \"Rocky I,\" \"Rocky II\" and \"Rocky III\" and you have captured the exhuberance, style and glory of \"Battlefield Earth.\" -- Baltimore Evening Sun, November 14, 1982Back in the fray after 30 years of absence is L. Ron Hubbard, one of the great formula and pulp writers of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Battlefield Earth is the huge, rollicking saga of Jonnie Goodboy Tyler. A youth from the hills where remnants of mankind hide from a high-technology race of aliens who have occupied Earth for a thousand years, Jonnie is captured by the aliens and ends up turning their own technology against them. The pace starts fast and never lets up. With Battlefield Earth, Hubbard comes across as a powerful science writer comparable to Robert Heinlein. -- Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 1982Hubbard celebrates 50 years as a pro writer with this huge (800+ pages), swarming, sometimes gripping slug-fest. The Earth has been occupied by monsters, imperial Pyschlos representing the Intergalactic Mining Corporation, who use \"breathe-gas\" (air is poisonous to them) and whose power derives from the closely guarded secret of teleportation. Furthermore, ambitious, devious Psychlo security chief Terl schemes to enrich himself by clandestinely mining gold, using humans as slave labor and he is soon exploiting explorer-bravo Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (holding Jonnie's girlfriend as hostage). But Jonnie, learning that breathe-gas explodes on contact with radioactive materials, quickly amasses allies, arms, equipment, and expertise for a war of liberation: he plots to doublecross the snarling Terl by substituting nuclear bombs for the gold to be teleported to planet Psychlo. -- Kirkus Review, August 1, 1982In the year 3000, Earth and her few remaining people are dominated by the cruel Psychlo aliens whose greed for wealth and power obliterates whatever compassion may have once existed. When Jonnie Goodboy Tyler's destiny leads him from a small Rocky Mountain community to confront the tyrannical aliens, he finds himself facing insurmountable odds no mortal man could hope to conquer. An epic in science fiction adventure, the absorbing story captures the mind and imagination in this tale of an Earth-destroying future war. -- Orange County Register, Nov 14, 1982 Product Description The works of L. Ron Hubbard--one of the top science fiction writers of the '30s and '40s--continue to be top sellers. 5 cassettes. About the Author L. Ron Hubbard, whose work includes 17 New York Times best sellers, has been acclaimed as one of the most widely read and influential authors of the 20th century. His phenomenal writing career spanned over 50 years. During that time he wrote and published over 260 works of fiction in such genres as science fiction, fantasy, western, mystery, detective and adventure. From AudioFile This first-class adventure novel is imbedded in mediocre science fiction, which contains no trace of Hubbard's Scientology. One thousand years after his sadistic race nearly destroyed humanity, an alien teaches a human too much, and we prevail. McDowell's voice is perfect with accented voices and pas.
