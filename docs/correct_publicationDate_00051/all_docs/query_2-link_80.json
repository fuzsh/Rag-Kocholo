It sounds pretty awful according to the description:\n\nThe Warrior of Earth faces new dangers as he pursues the evil Prince Khuramani across the alien Praesepean landscape to stop his vendetta against his sister Princess Charni and his dreams of linking with the Evil Ones.\n\nJason's path crosses the kingdom of the Undead as Khuramani flees to Zorastra and he has to challenge the evil God Cocuba. Jason 's anger grows as fast as Khuramani's list of innocent victims...\n\nThen again, that L. Ron Hubbard book sucked, and they STILL got a religion started. OK, I'm buying one. - And I got Kick out the Jams.\n\nLast edited: Dec 15, 2007\n\nGibsonGirl\n\nONE love, blood, life\n\nJoined\n\nJun 8, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n13,270\n\nHow could it suck?

You have me there. I'm not sure I could hang out with Diamond at the Sea of Tranquility. Or any sea for that matter.\n\nI guess I could see how it could suck. But still, the fact that it's about a moon in space could surely negate its shortcomings in part.\n\nUberBeaver\n\nBreakdancing Soul Pilgrim\n\nJoined\n\nSep 23, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n20,318\n\nLocation\n\nthe most serious...douch hammer ever\n\nGibsonGirl said:\n\nHow could it suck? It involves a moon. In space.\n\nWell, it's only redeeming quality is that is truly about Space Moon, but I am sure the author lacks the true appreciation of such a moon in space, for no one truly has a right to try to capture the essence of Space Moon in literary fiction - I mean, who has such talent to take on such a task. That's like saying 5000 years ago, \"You know what, I'm going to write the Bible. Yeah, I'm going to write that shit.\" No one man can write The Bible, just as no one man can truly tell of Space Moon. That's why the book will suck. Plus I'm also betting the guy can't write for shit - I'm sort of a snob like that.\n\nNo spoken words said:\n\nLook at my face:\n\nThat's how I look on Space Moon.
