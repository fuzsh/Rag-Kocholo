Ron Hubbard\n \nThis science fiction is an appealing read with great storytelling by the author. It is combined with adventures and suspense, giving the feeling of a cliffhanger that had me hooked.\n \nThe mankind is wiped off with advanced technology by the Psychlos, and a mere few survivors have retreated to inaccessible locations to avoid them. This adventure is set in the year 3000, when human survival is at stake and people think of aliens as monsters and aliens think of them as animals.\n \nJonnie is leaving with his tribe in the mountains and questioning the existence of a smaller population. He plans to leave the tribes and use the secrets and knowledge of the feared weapons of Psychlos to double-cross them and save the Earth.\n \nThis story has suspense, war, action, humor, and is fast-paced, making it enjoyable. With the POVs of both aliens and Jonnie, this was fascinating and showed the human instinct and zeal to survive.\n \nThis is a tad long book with characters being one-dimensional and not with many traits and also some unbelievable things; however, all the interesting aspects kind of overlapped these. The story and background were well-written.\n \nThe author's interview and notes while writing this book were a nice insight, with the lyrics included, which showed the thought process, story, views on writing, and more.\n\nOverall, it was a good read. Pick up if you enjoy good vs evil, hero journey stories.\n\nThank you @bookinfluencerscom and @galaxy_press for having me on tour.\n\nQOTD: What are you reading this week?\n\n#BattleFieldEarth #battlefieldearthasagaoftheyear3000 #lronhubbard #scififantasy #Scifi #bookinfluencers #ScienceFiction #BookReview #newedition #booksofinstagram #bookstoread #GalaxyPress #Booktok #summerreads\".",
