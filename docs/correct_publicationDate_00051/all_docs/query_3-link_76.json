        "text": "Battlefield Earth\n\nUSA 2000\n\nReviewed by Kim Newman\n\nSynopsis\n\nOur synopses give away the plot in full, including surprise twists.\n\nA thousand years hence. The Earth has long since been occupied by the Psychlos, an aggressively capitalist species of giant humanoid aliens. Humans live either in servitude to the invaders or in small tribes. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, a young tribesman, leaves his homestead and falls in with Carlo, a hunter. They are soon captured by a Psychlo raiding party rounding up slaves.\n\nTerl, Psychlo Security Chief on Earth, is condemned by his superiors to stay indefinitely at his post. Assisted by his deputy Ker, Terl plots to make a fortune by secretly training humans to mine gold in radioactive areas. Terl trains Jonnie for the job, subjecting him to a machine that fills him with Psychlo knowledge. Jonnie counterplots against Terl, using his newly acquired skills to scavenge gold from Fort Knox and fighter jets and nuclear weapons from a US military base. In a mass uprising against the Psychlos, Carlo sacrifices himself to destroy the dome over Denver, letting in air fatal to the Psychlos. Jonnie uses a teleport link with the Psychlos' home planet to send the aliens a suicide raider with a nuclear device, which ignites the atmosphere of the planet. Ker sides with the humans; Terl is imprisoned as insurance against reprisal from other Psychlo colonies.\n\nReview\n\nThe 1066-page novel Battlefield Earth was L. Ron Hubbard's first published science fiction after a prolonged break from the genre spent inventing Dianetics, the peculiar system of DIY psychic self-improvement that forms the basis of the Church of Scientology. At the time of publication, it was remarked that Hubbard had retrofitted his belief system into pulp plotting by setting out a story - young man overcomes initial ignorance to achieve mastery of Earth - which could easily be read as an allegory of an initiate's progress through Scientology. It was also clear that Hubbard had taken little notice of how the genre had changed since his days in the late 30s writing at a penny a word for such magazines as Astounding Science Fiction. Full of gosh-wow devices that had long since become clich√©s, Battlefield Earth's juvenile tone was more in tune with the post-Star Wars science-fiction films of the late 70s than the literary field which had nurtured Philip K. Dick, Harlan Ellison and Alfred Bester.\n\nFor this reason, Battlefield Earth is likely to go down better with Scientology devotees - for whom Hubbard is an almost sacred figure - than with serious science-fiction fans. The path to enlightenment taken by the film's pouting, callow hero Jonnie is as fuzzy as any other post-Skywalker attempt to yoke in teachings from Joseph W. Campbell to add mythic muscle to an action scenario. It doesn't help that the film's premise, which sees stoneage cavemen turn into ace fighter pilots with only a week's training, is as naive as that of the 1939 serial Buck Rogers, where Buck mastered futuristic flying machines in as ludicrously short a period.\n\nRoger Christian presumably won this big-budget science-fiction gig on the basis of his second-unit work on the The Phantom Menace. Unfortunately, star and co-producer John Travolta seems to have failed to notice that among Christian's mixed, often interesting directorial credits (The Sender, Nostradamus) was a previous science-fiction action film Lorca and the Outlaws that managed with far fewer resources to be exactly as muddy, silly and tedious as this effort. Battlefield Earth has the added misfortune to arrive as the latest in a line of similar exercises (Waterworld, The Postman) that have become standing jokes in the genre, failing entirely to match the hairy mix of satire and spectacle found in the first Planet of the Apes films or the Mad Max series. With sub-Gene Roddenberry bathos, villain Terl's big mistake is not filling Jonnie's head with science (basic algebra, the ability to fly a spaceship) but encouraging him to examine a dusty copy of the Declaration of Independence that inspires his rebellion.\n\nThough he originally intended to play the hero, Travolta presumably switched to the role of alien villain because he recognised that the scheming baddie is a far meatier part. Scientology at least notionally stands as a reaction to the grey-flannel-suit excesses of early-50s US corporate culture, and the most deeply felt aspect of the novel that transfers to the film is its depiction of the Psychlos as members of a corrupt corporation where every executive is out to maximise his own personal profit. It's panto-level satire, but one that allows for welcome moments of camp - notably Travolta and Forest Whitaker's blustering, back-stabbing double act - that break up the pompous rebel-rousing. An ending which leaves them both alive while wiping out their homeworld (a blithe genocide prompting the Clerks cry of \"What about the builders?\") raises the possibility of a sequel, drawn from the second half of the novel. Since the plot hinges on the aeronautical prowess of stoneage-like tribesmen, it's futile to complain about lesser demands on suspension of disbelief such as the Psychlo homeworld's possession of an atmosphere that can fortuitously combust after the detonation of a simple atom bomb.\n\nCredits"
