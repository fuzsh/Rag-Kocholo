Mission Earth is approaching climax . . . And it will rock your world! Who will control Voltar? What is Earth's ultimate fate? And what is the big mystery?\n\nThe wait is over. Powerful forces are on the move. Entire planets hang in the balance. The moment of truth is finally at hand--and it's a real blast! In the middle of it all stands Royal Officer of the Fleet, Jettero Heller, a man determined to save both Voltar and Earth from extinction.\n\nTogether with an outlaw emperor and an army one hundred thousand strong, Heller lays siege to Palace City, which has fallen into the depraved and diabolical hands of Lombar Hisst. But the success of Heller's great adventure is far from a sure thing. For in order to achieve victory, he will not only have to break the laws of Voltar--but defy the laws of physics.\n\nHere is your ticket to travel beyond the boundaries of space and time. Experience the unfolding mysteries, the violent pleasures and the biting, inescapable truths you can only find in the final reckoning of THE DOOMED PLANET.\n\n\"Marvelous satire by a master of adventure.\" --Anne McCaffrey\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\" Hubbard is a thinker who writes, rather than a writer who thinks, as most masters are. \" SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE\"\n\n\" Marvelous satire by a master of adventure. \" ANNE MCCAFFREY\"\n\n\" Mr. Hubbard has managed in this book to bring out things that were not always talked about in those days when he put pen to paper.

Ron Hubbard is among the most acclaimed and widely read authors of our time. As a leading light of American Pulp Fiction through the 1930s and '40s, he is further among the most influential authors of the modern age. Indeed, from Ray Bradbury to Stephen King, there is scarcely a master of imaginative tales who has not paid tribute to L. Ron Hubbard."
