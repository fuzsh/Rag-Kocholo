        "text": "Modern Library 100 Best Novels (The Reader’s List) [MLR]\n\nPublished in 1998\n\nHere’s the list of the people. The Modern Library, beside its own “Board” assembled list, produced this one which was voted on by an Internet poll of readers. The results tell you more about who was on the Internet in 1998 than anything else. Four things summarize this list: Objectivism, Scientology, sci-fi/fantasy, and bestsellers. This is actually great! Here are four subjects sorely underrepresented on the master list, but each one was very much a part of the zeitgeist of 20th century America. If the [MLB] reflects what we ought to be reading, the [MLR] shows what many people were reading. And yet, like all of these lists, there is more to the [MLR] than that. It has many thoughtful, challenging books on it, a number of them absent from the board’s supposedly more pedantic list, among them Gravity’s Rainbow, Absalom, Absalom!, Beloved, At Swim-Two-Birds, and Blood Meridian.\n\nBut when it stoops, it stoops mightily. First, Ayn Rand and L. Ron Hubbard make up seven of the top ten books. Please. Secondly, there’s Charles de Lint. De Lint is a Canadian sci-fi hack who makes this list seven times. That’s seven books that make the list over, say, Rabbit Run or Native Son, Mrs. Dalloway, or Pale Fire. I don’t mind coming off as snobbish here; the fact is Charles de Lint does not belong on any list of great books. None of his works gets another nod from the other twenty-three lists.\n\nClick here to see the full Modern Library (Readers) list or scroll below. Works in RED appear on at least one other of the 24 lists I surveyed and so are on the Master List."
