Whether you have lunch in your garden with their favourite teddy‚Äôs, have a day in your creche or school you don‚Äôt need much to take part, just the bear necessities!!! üß°üåüüß∏üß∏\n\n‚ÄúThe children were all bringing in their own teddy bears, and we had a series of activities, like walks within the grounds of the school, a bear hunt, story times and games. It finished with the children bringing their teddies on a picnic. The families then donated what they could.\n\nIt was such an amazing day, and we plan to do this every year for Jack and Jill.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Quote from Evelyn and Jess from the Liffey Champion, July 3rd, 2021. Read the full interview here.\n\nThis marks the fourth consecutive year of our Annual Event, and we‚Äôre thrilled to elevate it to new heights this year. We‚Äôre adding exciting elements like activity packs, goodie bags, and adorable teddy bear masks, ensuring it‚Äôs a day to cherish for our local children and #communityheroes. Together, we aim to raise crucial funds for Jack and Jill families.\n\nWhat could be more heartwarming than children supporting children all while doing what they love‚Ä¶ having fun!"
