        "text": "At historic Pier 57, you can explore food, art, music, hands-on environmental education and more—always with spectacular views.\n\nTransformed from its original maritime industrial use through an award-winning historic restoration, Pier 57 features ample indoor and outdoor public space for year-round enjoyment.\n\nHere you will find a rooftop park, a waterfront food market that celebrates NYC’s independent food culture, City Winery, community spaces, and an interactive gallery and classroom focused on local wildlife and waterways. This pier is one of several locations in Hudson River Park where limited commercial uses are permitted to support the Park’s overall care and operations.\n\nPublic Open Space\n\nThe nearly two-acre rooftop park and the walkway around the perimeter of Pier 57 are open to the general public daily 6:00 AM–1:00 AM.\n\nOffering incredible views of Hudson River Park, the New York City skyline, and New York Harbor, the rooftop is the perfect place to add to your morning walk routine, meet for a lunchtime picnic and gather with friends for an unforgettable sunset. Read more about the rooftop park.\n\nIndoors, a new 7,400 square foot public gathering place called the “Living Room” provides seating and tables with extraordinary views of Little Island and Lower Manhattan. Enjoy a coffee or just relax in a comfortable place to connect and gather in all weather conditions.\n\nDiscovery Tank\n\nThe Discovery Tank is an interactive technology-powered gallery and classroom that is free for the public to enjoy. Explore beneath the surface of the Hudson River with interactive games to learn about the fascinating critters that call our local waterways home. Dive in to learn more about Guided Gallery visits and field trip opportunities.\n\nBookable Community Spaces\n\nTech-enabled, bookable spaces are available for hosting educational, recreational and cultural experiences in an accessible environment, provided to community organizations and nonprofits free-of-charge with the support of Google. Community Classrooms are free to book and open year-round. Visit Pier 57’s website for a schedule of community programming and booking information.\n\nUnique Food and Entertainment\n\nPier 57’s redevelopment includes the relocated City Winery, a new food market and two future full-service restaurants — making the historic pier a must-visit site in NYC, especially if you love food.\n\nLocated on the ground floor, City Winery offers a unique culinary and cultural experience for urban wine enthusiasts and anyone passionate about music. This popular performance venue includes a restaurant, tasting room and its signature wine production facility — all overlooking the Hudson River and Lower Manhattan.\n\nCurated under the guidance and mentorship of The James Beard Foundation, the new Market 57 features something for every palette. The dining hall’s 15+ vendors showcase the culinary and cultural diversity from New York City’s local, independent food culture.\n\nThe James Beard Foundation brings its mission of Good Food for Good™ to life with PLATFORM by JBF at Market 57. Through rotating chefs-in-residence, this educational space and modern show kitchen offers culinary arts programming, cooking demonstrations, expert-led classes and more. Please visit their website for daily programming, details and tickets.\n\nThe Players\n\nThese exciting new offerings are part of the larger repositioning of Pier 57 commissioned by the Hudson River Park Trust in 2009. Led by RXR, Youngwoo & Associates, The Baupost Group and Jamestown, the consortium of partners embarked on a $410 million redevelopment of the Pier where Google serves as anchor tenant."
