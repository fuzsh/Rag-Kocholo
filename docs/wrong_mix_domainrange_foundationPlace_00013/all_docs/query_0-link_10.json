Their programs are well-organized and effective, and the volunteers are passionate and dedicated.\n\nDeborah, Assistant Principal, PS 196K\n\nBrooklyn üåâ\n\nNew York Cares is a constant for us, standing by us in good times as well as challenging ones. We had communication with them virtually during the shutdown and they continually assist us in finding solutions when the need arises.\n\nChloe, Volunteer\n\nManhattan üåÜ\n\nIt's an honor, privilege, and a life-changing experience to give back to a city who gives us so much in return.\n\nKai, Team Leader\n\nBrooklyn üåâ\n\nNew York Cares has given me the opportunity to broaden my horizons by serving others.\n\nMaanya, Volunteer\n\nQueens üå≥\n\nVolunteering is really rewarding. As somebody who is from the New York City public school system, it feels great to give back to the community that gave me so much and made me the person I am today.\n\nAkeem, Team Leader\n\nQueens üå≥\n\nVolunteering can provide a healthy boost to your self-confidence, self-esteem, and life satisfaction.
