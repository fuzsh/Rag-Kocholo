        "text": "Q&A\n\nQ: I am considering running, and I wanted to confirm they are still planned to be held.\n\nA: YES, the date is March 18th at the times listed above!\n\nQ: I have registered for the 6 hour event. I have never run a time limited event like this before and unfamiliar with the rules. I have reviewed the website and don't find an explanation of how it works. So if a runner does say 10 laps (33) miles in say 5:40 but can't complete another lap before the 6 hours expires is he/she given credit for 33 miles if they stop?\n\nA: Yes you nailed it, that’s how it works! We are going to use the Picnic Island Loop for anyone who wants extra millage after the 5 & 9 hour marks, if you aren't able to complete a full loop in the time remaining. You can then run the Picnic Island Loop for the remaining time. That loop is 0.85 miles long! However ONLY completed loops are counted.\n\nBecause of the time limit we've been given by the park, even measuring partial laps and being out of the park by 7pm would be a stretch! It would also delay any official results and the awards! We could do it for the 6 hour but couldn’t do it for the 10 hour, so not fair to do it for one and not for the other!\n\nHere’s another difference, unlike other events, after the first full loop, you’re a Finisher!!\n\nFixed time events are unlike other events where you run a set distance and see what your time is, here your run as much as you can in a set time on a given course and see what your mileage is! So one lap of the course and when you come through the finish line your technically a finisher. You just get that distance recorded as you mileage, for the time of your event ( 6 hours! ) So if the loop is 3.32 miles and you do 1 loop in 6 hours, your results will show you as completing 3.32 miles in 6 hours. Someone who runs 10 loops in 5:40 will show as going 33.2 miles in 6 hours!\n\nQ: What is the distance of the loop?\n\nA: The LONG Loop is 3.32 continuous miles ( No out and backs ) At the 5 & 9 hour marks in the race, we will switch to staying on the Picnic Island Loop so you can get in as many miles as possible. The smaller Picnic Island SHORT loop is .85 miles around\n\nQ: Where can I get my chip and shirt?\n\nA: Race morning at the River Pavilion which is the Start/Finish Area, you can pick up your race shirt and bib with the disposable timing tag attached to the back!\n\nQ: Where can I park race morning?\n\nA: Parking is along the road after the trailhead parking lot, you can park on either side of the road; Note the road is a One Way road around the Island!\n\nQ: Is there and aid station?\n\nA: Yes, one fully stocked aid station will be at the Start/Finish line, which you'll pass every 3.32 miles. You can also bring your own stuff and leave it under the pavilion, or set up on the path, so you're never more than a few feet from your things!\n\nQ: Are their bathrooms on the course?\n\nA: Yes there are. There are two brand new bathrooms that have recently been built in the park. One is a few steps away from the Start/Finish line the 2nd is up front near the entrance. There are also several port-a-lets at various locations in the park and along the course!\n\nQ: Is there a finisher medal?\n\nA: Check back, something is brewing!\n\nQ: Is the race timed and where will results be posted\n\nA: The race is being timed by Mike Melton and LIVE results will be available for family and friends to follow along! Mike's site will have a link to the results website posted near the top. His page is www.MCMTiming.com\n\nQ: Where can I find out more about Riverbend Park & Battlefield Park\n\n​A: At any of the following links...\n\nhttp://discover.pbcgov.org/parks/Locations/Riverbend.aspx\n\n​http://discover.pbcgov.org/parks/Pages/Riverbend.aspx\n\n​​http://discover.pbcgov.org/parks/Riverbend/LoxahatcheePark.aspx\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/loxahatchee.battlefield/?fref=photo\n\n​Some pictures on the trails in Riverbend Park on 1.6.2019"
