        "text": "When local businessman Ted O’Hara saw a video about the Make-A-Wish® Foundation back in 1985, he was hooked. He shared the video with some friends, with the idea of starting a local chapter, and by 1987 that idea became a reality. The first wish granted by Make-A-Wish® Northeast New York was for a girl from Amsterdam, whose wish was to visit Costa Rica to visit grandparents she had never met.\n\nO’Hara said that those early wishes were challenging, especially as they were breaking ground for a new organization few were familiar with. Now, more than three decades years later, more than 2,000 wishes have been granted in our local area, with around 90-100 granted each year. Whether a heartfelt wish is for a Walt Disney World® Resort trip or a puppy, a treehouse or to meet a celebrity, it sparks hope, strength and joy in children, as well as families, donors, sponsors, the medical community, volunteers and whole communities.\n\nLooking back at more than three decades, a future filled with amazing and meaningful wishes is truly something to look forward to for all of us.
