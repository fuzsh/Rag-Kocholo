        "text": "Last week Foundation students had a Teddy Bears Picnic!\n\nOur platters with food that start with all the stage 1 letters we have learnt so far in Foundation. S for strawberries, P for popcorn and pears, A for apples, C for cupcakes, F for fairy bread, T for tiny teddies, M for Mango. We shared our platters with our friends and families. We loved having our Teddies with us for the day. We had so much fun!\n\nWe counted our bears using the touch and move strategy. We sorted our teddies into small medium and large groups and by their colours.\n\nWe loved seeing so many parents come and support their child with this event. We all loved having you with us."
