We make manipulation algorithms easier and faster to deploy.\n\nAny Brand of Arm\n\nBring your favorite COTS arm, or build a custom arm to fit your needs. A ROS driver is all that’s needed.\n\nAny End Effector\n\nOur algorithms currently support both vacuum picking as well as 2-finger end effectors, but anything is possible.\n\nAny Depth Camera\n\nCan be used with most brands of 3D depth sensor cameras. Intel Realsense is our affordable favorite.\n\nModel based design with Behavior Trees\n\nAn integrated behavior tree editor and debugger allows developers to create the proper abstractions to enable complex reasoning composed of simpler behavior primitives.\n\nDevelop. Simulate. Deploy. Repeat.\n\nRapidly iterate your robot behaviors and parameters on the fly within the integrated development environment, and instantly deploy on your hardware or simulator for testing."
