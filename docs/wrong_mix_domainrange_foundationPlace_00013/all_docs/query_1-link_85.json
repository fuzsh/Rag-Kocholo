        "text": "Saxon Woods Park is a 700-acre property offering a variety of recreational facilities. In colonial times, the park area was called Saxton Forest, after William Saxton, who operated a saw mill on the western branch of the Mamaroneck River. Local usage changed the name to Saxon Woods.\n\nThe park contains an 18-hole golf course as well as a miniature golf course, the county’s largest swimming pool, a children’s aquatic playground and picnic areas. It is also the site of the county’s only playground that is accessible to the disabled.\n\nA trail system connects the southern section to the upland wooded northern part of the park, characterized by mature hardwood forests. The trails are very popular with hikers, cross country skiers and horseback riders. The entire system extends along the Hutchinson River Parkway to Twin Lakes Park and north to Maple Moor Golf Course. It also links to the Leatherstocking Trail and Colonial Greenway and contains archeologically sensitive areas.\n\nTrails Without Limits\n\nA Westchester Parks Foundation program that makes unpaved trailways accessible to people with disabilities. Park visitors, who need hiking assistance, have an opportunity to explore rustic hiking trails in an All-Terrain Trackchair. Reserve your experience or get more information. Limited availability."
