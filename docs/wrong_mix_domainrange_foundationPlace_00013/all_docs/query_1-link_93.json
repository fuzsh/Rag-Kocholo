        "text": "Bremen Basket (AI54-UE)\n\nCONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:\n\nItem to be stored in a Black Rock panelled cell. Keep away from lab animals when not in use.\n\nDESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:\n\nA simple wicker basket with cloth lining. No food items inside.\n\nThe item produces a hypnotic effect that solely affects non-human animals, forcing them to congregate passively around the object. Animals from every genus and species that have thus far been tested are susceptible. Single-cell organisms do not appear to react to the effect.\n\nAPPENDIX:\n\n6/97 â€” Item was taken to a forest upstate for testing. Results of the test provided contradicting data as some of the attracted animals exhibited hyper-aggressive behavior. The exercise unfortunately resulted in [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. Further testing should be restricted to more low-risk animal species with medical staff on standby."
