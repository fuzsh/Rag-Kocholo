Several industry greats trained him, including Martin Berasategui in Spain and Charlie Palmer, Jean Georges Vongeritchen, Gray Kuntz, and David Bouley in the U.S. His culinary vision finds inspiration in a life-long love of seafood and the global breadth of his cooking experience.\n\nView On Map\n\nAniwat Khotsopa (Tong)\n\nBryan Chunton was born into a restaurant family; his parents owned and operated Thai restaurants in the 1980’s. Chunton started working in kitchens at the early age of 12 and introduced NYC to the authentic flavors of Northeastern Thai Cuisine with the help of Chef Aniwat Khotsopha and Pei Shan Wei.

His vision was to blend the best of New York’s diverse cultures into each bite.\n\nRachel’s passion for the bustling atmosphere of the food service industry, which she loved during her college days as a server, drew her back into the hospitality world. She missed the adrenaline of working through lunch and dinner rushes during baseball games, the joy of meeting people from all walks of life, and the satisfaction of seeing happy customers.\n\nNikki, a dedicated teacher, brought her nurturing spirit and educational insights to the team, keen on applying her organizational skills and passion for community engagement to help start and grow a small business.\n\nView On Map\n\nRaymond Z Mohan\n\nA New York Restaurant School graduate, Executive Chef Raymond Z.
