        "text": "DUMBO, which stands for “Down Under Manhattan Bridge Overpass,” was an industrial neighborhood transformed into an artsy hub for shops, restaurants, and start-up businesses. You can get to it by crossing the Manhattan or Brooklyn Bridge. Shower in the sun and picnic on open, grassy or waterfront areas with skyline views before heading to an art venue like Minus Space, Smack Mellon or A.I.R. Gallery, and a restaurant like Westville Dumbo, Lex Restaurant, or ALMAR for dinner to round out your Brooklyn adventure.\n\nPicnic spots: The lawns or the stone steps near the Jane’s Carousel.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: Grimaldi’s Pizzeria, Juliana’s, or Cecconi’s Dumbo. If you want something light, try Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill or Atrium DUMBO.\n\n3: Prospect Park\n\nDesigned by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who also designed the famous Central Park, this 585-acre green space offers a variety of activities and events throughout the year, making it a fun destination for both locals and tourists. Take a stroll through the beautiful grounds, go picnicking, fishing, or bird watching, or stop by landmarks like Grand Army Plaza, Lefferts Historic House, or Litchfield Villa. There are also free events like Celebrate Brooklyn, Philharmonic in the Parks, and the Metropolitan Opera in the Park in the summer.\n\nPicnic spots: Concert Grove Pavilion, which can be accessed from the Lincoln Road & Ocean Avenue entrance, is a great option. It is also a special part of the park, lined with the busts of figures like Beethoven, Mozart, and Washington Irving.\n\nAnother great picnic spot is The Nethermead, an open and expansive meadow in the middle of the park. You can reach it by entering the park at Prospect Park West and 9th Street.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: During select days in summer, Smorgasburg, the largest food fair in the country, will be held at the park’s Breeze Hill. Also, before you enter the park, stop by Culpepper’s for some Caribbean take-out.\n\n4: Fort Tryon Park\n\nLess than a mile south of The Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park in Inwood features a small, beautiful garden, an easy trail, and majestic views of the Hudson River. This is also one of the quiet places in New York City, and on a warm day, you may meet squirrels and young bluejays as they come out for food. Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., son of the famous Central Park architect, Fort Tryon Park is perfect for picnicking, relaxing, or finishing your favorite book.\n\nPicnic spots: The lawns and benches along the Heather Garden.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: One great option is New Leaf Restaurant and Bar, an eatery housed in a restored stone building from the 1930s that serves lunch, dinner, and weekend brunch.\n\n5: Astoria Park\n\nLocated between the Robert F. Kennedy and Hell Gate Bridges along the East River, Astoria Park is a beloved spot among the outdoorsy. While wildly known for its beautiful pool, the oldest and largest in the city, Astoria Park offers more than aquatic pleasures. You can play tennis or basketball at the courts, roll out a blanket and picnic, or enjoy panoramic views on the central Great Lawn.\n\nPicnic spots: The Great Lawn or benches dotted in the park.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: Agnanti, a Mediterranean restaurant famous for its tyrokafteri (a spicy feta dip) and the Agnanti wrap (a pastry filled with creamy cheese and bacon) is a great option.\n\nThe restaurant also has a patio overlooking the park, so you can enjoy the food and the views without doing any of the work yourself.\n\n6: Clove Lakes Park\n\nIf you are looking for a waterfront eat-and-nap, look no further than Glove Lakes Park. Located in the Sunnyside of Staten Island, this protected site has a rich natural history and a few remnants of the past, including the 300-year-old and 107-foot tall tulip tree that continues to thrill visitors. Stroll down hiking trails and paddling on the park’s bodies of water before rolling out a blanket and picnic — the park has plenty of space for that — and there is also a permit-free BBQ area near the southeast corner of the lake for parties of four or fewer.\n\nPicnic spots: You can picnic on the middle lawn by the field house or under a cherry tree by one of the walkways.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: The locals fancy Beans and Leaves Coffee and Tea Cafe for their brews, fresh bread, and baked goods.\n\n7: Marsha P. Johnson State Park (East River State Park)\n\nThis park showed up when we searched for the best places to see the 4th of July Fireworks. With a 7-acre lawn that stretches along the East River near North 7th, 8th, and 9th Streets, the park offers unobstructed views of Manhattan and several barbecue platforms and picnic tables, which makes it a great spot to roll out a blanket and chow down your favorite burritos.\n\nPicnic spots: Anywhere on the seven-acre lawn that faces the East River.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: Head to Rosarito Fish Shack and Bagelsmith for burritos or bagels. If you visit in summer on select Saturdays, you can also grab a bite from Smorgasburg, the largest food fair in the country.\n\n8: Governors Island\n\nThis 30 acres of parkland is open year-round and features 50 lounge-ready slings, two natural turf ball fields, and human-made hills, one of which is as high as 80 feet above the harbor, from where you will enjoy breathtaking views of Manhattan. You can take a free guided tour to Castle Williams, Fort Jay, or the surrounding National Historic Landmark District or enjoy occasional festivals, concerts, and outdoor exhibitions like Nature Painting, Twilight Winter Bird Stroll, and more! Our favorite activity is to picnic on the Play Lawn or take a nap on the slings.\n\nPicnic spots: Anywhere on the Play Lawn.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: Neapolitan Express and Makina Cafe. To indulge your sweet tooth, try ice cream, desserts, and pastries from vendors like Joe Coffee, Melt Bakery, and People’s Pops.\n\nRead More: Best Things to Do on Governors Island\n\n9: Madison Square Park\n\nLocated on Fifth Avenue and 40th Street, Bryant Park is a piece of paradise for New Yorkers working and living in Midtown. Here, you can grab a chair and read a book or get some sun, or catch up with an old friend over coffee or a bite. You will feel completely secluded from the noise and crowds outside. During select days in summer, Bryant Park will transform into an outdoor theatre playing classic movies, from Little Miss Sunshine and Big Daddy to Coming to America and more! If you are interested, check out the calendar for this year.\n\nPicnic spots: The central lawn or tables and chairs dotted around the edges.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: You can get coffee at Joe Coffee Company, pastries at Le Pain Quotidien, or indulge your sweet tooth at the Wafels & Dinges stand.\n\n12: Secret Garden at St. Luke in the Fields\n\nThis two-acre oasis in the West Village welcomes you into a pristine world surrounded by high brick walls, where the din and chaos of the city fade to nothing. You will find a series of gardens, like Barrow Street Garden, separated into four quadrants; Gene Morin Contemplation Corner with blooms in lavender, white, and pink; Rectory Garden, the oldest section that houses a rose garden and the ruins of the former parish hall that burned down in 1981. This garden is the best-kept secret among the locals, and no one speaks louder than a whisper!\n\nPicnic spots: The South Lawn, a large, grassy area that bleeds into the cheery-tree-lined alley, which curves around the church’s back wall into the North Garden, which is shaded by two-hundred-year-old maple trees.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: Oscar’s Place, Little Owl, or Hudson Clearwater.\n\n13: The New York Chinese Scholar’s Garden\n\nThe weather in New York is like a teenager, emotionally unpredictable. It can be clear in the morning and turns cold and rainy in the afternoon. If you’re looking for an indoor spot to picnic on one of these days, this is your best bet. The space is open to the public until 6:00 PM. You can roll out a blanket and snack in a tropical garden encased in a 10-story glass atrium. Over 40 species of trees, vines, and shrubs, with the scent of gardenias and the sound of water, create a pleasant ambiance that makes you barely feel like being inside.\n\nPicnic spots: The tables hidden amid the cluster of trees.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: You can head to Sakagura for classic Japanese dishes or fine Italian food from Pietros.\n\n16: Elevated Acre\n\nTucked three stories up a hidden escalator between two office towers in the Financial District, Elevated Acre is a popular park for those in the know to escape the din and chaos of the city or their workplace. People also come here to picnic, read a book, or walk on the Brazilian hardwood boardwalk 30 feet above the East River and overlook the city as it comes alive at night.\n\nPicnic spots: The central lawn or the tables dotted around the lawn.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: Adrienne’s Pizzabar, Sky55 Bar, or Kome Waza for Japanese dishes and create-your-own poke bowls.\n\n17: The Creative Little Garden\n\nThe Creative Little Garden, on 530 East Sixth Street, between Avenues A and B, has been an oasis of tranquility since 1978. While this just over a quarter of an acre space might not be as popular as others on this list, it offers an enchanting experience and is run by volunteers and maintained by community members. Long and narrow, the garden winds around a gravel path, rock garden, flagstone patio, and many seating areas. Here, you can relax, read, have lunch, work on your laptop, or just enjoy the sights, sounds, and smells of the garden.\n\nPicnic spots: There are many seating areas for a sit-down meal.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: Get traditional American fares from The Smith, borscht or pierogi from Veselka, a Ukrainian restaurant, or fresh seafood from Lamia’s Fish Market.\n\n18: 6BC Botanical Garden\n\nJust steps from the bustling East Village, this compact Alphabet City garden features hundreds of plants and flowers plus a small pond, making it an excellent spot for picnics and free urban getaways.\n\nPicnic spots: Anywhere that has a bench!\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: Get some seasonal tempura from Secchu Yokota, comfort food from Avenue C, or tapas from Plado Tasting Bar.\n\n19: Ridgewood Reservoir\n\nSitting on the Brooklyn-Queens border, within what is now Highland Park, this 19th-century reservoir is a great picnic spot, with dramatic views of nearby cemeteries, East New York, Woodhaven, the Rockaways, and the Atlantic Ocean. Also, this area’s combination of forests, fields, and wetlands makes it excellent for wildlife viewing, where over 120 species of birds, including blue herons and cardinals, have been spotted. In addition to your favorite burritos, you might also want to bring a binocular and a camera for some awesome nature shots.\n\nPicnic spots: The grassy area around the Ridgewood Reservoir.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: Get kebabs from Bridge Turkish and Mediterranean Grill, savory Sichuan food from Sichuan Spring Chinese Restaurant, or a Black Angus beef burger from 418 Burgers.\n\n20: New York Botanical Garden\n\nThis 250-acre outdoor museum in The Bronx has over one million living plants and flowers, offering breathtaking scenery when spring and summer are around. Winter is not boring, too, thanks to its Holiday Train Show. If you visit from March to May, you can have your favorite sandwich (or burrito) under blooming cherry blossom trees. Check out their website for upcoming flower viewing events.\n\nPicnic spots: The only spot allowed for picnicking is Picnic Pavilion, located just behind the Everett Children’s Adventure Garden.\n\nWhere to grab food nearby: Hudson Garden Grill, Zero Otto Nove, or MichaelAngelo’s Pizza & Restaurant for their brick-oven pizzas and classic Italian dishes.\n\n21: Riverside Park\n\nRiverside Park, along the Hudson River, offers a quiet escape for folks living on the Upper West Side.
