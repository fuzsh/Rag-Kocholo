When you get involved with New York Cares, you’re not just “helping out.” You’re making your city more resilient by giving New Yorkers more options for how they work, live, and play.

New York Cares is a constant for us, standing by us in good times as well as challenging ones. We had communication with them virtually during the shutdown and they continually assist us in finding solutions when the need arises.

Volunteering is really rewarding. As somebody who is from the New York City public school system, it feels great to give back to the community that gave me so much and made me the person I am today.
