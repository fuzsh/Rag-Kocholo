The Mississippi Society of New York City and your New York MSU Alumni Chapter are reviving Mississippi Picnic in the Park.

Saturday, June 15

12:00 - 4:00 p.m.

Pier 64 @ Hudson River Park

163 12th Ave

New York, NY (at W 24th St.)

Admission is free.

Come join us as we go back to our roots and rebuild the foundation for an event that celebrates the culture, tastes, and sounds of Mississippi in New York City. Enjoy a relaxing day at the park visiting with Mississippi friends and listening to good music. Bring your lawn chairs, blankets, picnic favorites, food, beverages (must be in a closed container or cup) and your great Bulldog spirit. Your Mississippi State Alumni Association will be represented under the tent.

We hope to see you in wearing your MAROON and WHITE with pride.
