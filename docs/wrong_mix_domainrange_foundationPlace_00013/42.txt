From #Concept to #Completion, Construction Concepts is the proud builder behind Houston‚Äôs beloved Ume Sushi located in the Heights. We worked closely with chef and owner Chris Kinjo to bring his design vision to life, just as we did with sister restaurant MF Sushi. The approximately 3,000 square foot space is split into two main sections. The entrance and interior space feature a bar area with a large Hinoki slab communal table and high top seating. The main dining room, which overlooks the open kitchen and sushi bar, features booth and table seating, and is lit by a canopy of custom plum blossom chandeliers in various stages of bloom. What can we build for you? #BuiltByConstructionConcepts #ConceptToCompletion #UmeSushi #HeightsHouston #HoustonBuilder #HoustonConstruction

Torchy's has become a Texas institution for tacos, and we were more than thrilled to partner with them in building their new locations in the Woodlands and the Galleria! Look how stunning this design and build is in Tanglewood. We've also heard this location is making all of their flour tortillas in house! #GeneralContractors #DesignandBuild #BuildingHouston
