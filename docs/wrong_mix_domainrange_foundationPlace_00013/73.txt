This picnic table for two from Extremis is more than meets the eye. Picnik was of course primarily designed as a modern picnic table with benches for small outdoor spaces. But thanks to its striking looks, which are both solid and stylish, Picnik is also frequently used indoors. When several Picnik garden sets are combined in public or semi-public spaces, they create an almost artistic effect.
