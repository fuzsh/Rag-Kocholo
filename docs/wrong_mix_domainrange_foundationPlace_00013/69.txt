​Gusinje Foundation organizes “Ski Weekend”

With small changes, this year we will hang out on the ski slopes. Unlike previous years, the meeting place will be LAKE PLACID, a place near the lake of the same name. The mountain where the ski fields are located is WHITEFACE MOUNTAIN, otherwise it is the fifth highest mountain in the American state of New York. Lake Placid is known as the site of the Winter Olympics and a center for snow sports and other outdoor activities.

The dates of the gathering are February 17 and 18, otherwise it’s a weekend when it’s also the national holiday PRESIDENT DAY. For any information (including help with accommodation), contact this Facebook profile or the phone number on the poster.
