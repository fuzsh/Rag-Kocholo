        "text": "Milan (Italy), March 2, 2023 â€“ Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI, Gruppo FS Italiane) has announced the contract award effectiveness to the consortium formed by Impresa Pizzarotti & C. and Saipem of the works for the construction of the Florence high-speed/high-capacity railway link and station. The total value of the contract amounts to more than 1 billion euro. With a share of approximately 551 million euro, Pizzarotti is the consortium leader, while Saipem's share amounts to approximately 529 million euro.\n\nThe work consists of the construction of a new railway line of approximately 7 kilometres underground with two parallel tunnels, at an average depth of about 20 metres, completed with two above-ground terminal sections, to the north between the stations of Firenze Castello and Firenze Rifredi, and to the south near the station of Firenze Campo di Marte. The tunnels will be excavated using mechanised techniques. Along the underground route, the new HS/HC Firenze Belfiore station will be built, designed by Foster architectural firm and Ove Arup and partner engineering company. This is a strategic work in Italy for high-speed trains and for the regional railway network, which will allow a new configuration of the local network, separating the flows of high-speed trains from those of regional trains.\n\nThe awarding represents an important achievement for Saipem in contributing to the development of sustainable mobility promoted by the European Union for the development of the European TEN-T corridors, to which Saipem has contributed in Italy with the construction of the Milan-Bologna and Milan-Verona HS/HC sections (Brescia-Verona section currently under construction).\n\nSAIPEM\n\nWebsite: www.saipem.com\n\nSwitchboard: +39 0244231\n\nMedia relations\n\nE-mail: media.relations@saipem.com\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nE-mail: investor.relations@saipem.com\n\nContact point for retail investors\n\nE-mail: segreteria.societaria@saipem.com\n\nPIZZAROTTI\n\nwww.pizzarotti.it\n\nTel. +39 0521 2021"
