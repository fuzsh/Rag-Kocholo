Building roads, bridges, airports, dams and tunnels is not the only task set forth by Pizzarotti: the Nuova Fiera di Milano, one of the most iconic structures built in Europe, comes as a clear example of the diversified skills of the Company. Traditional, well designed and long lasting construction is one of Pizzarottiâ€™s targets: building solid homes or offices that will be passed on for generations to come is our goal. Impresa Pizzarotti SpA is also known for building some world-famous structures, such as the interconnection station at the Charles De Gaulle airport, linking the TGV - RER urban transport network to the Roissy Terminal, or, again, the Civil engineering works for the installation of a thermal-power plant for ENEL or Milano Malpensa airport. But building does need communication skills as well: this is why the Middle East hub of this leading Italian company has trusted the ability of Antiga Arabia to deliver the message to the Gulf market: the language is important, but the way you talk can be even more important."
