        "text": "The judge emphasised that the context in which the issue in the present case arises concerns State aid. In a section headed \"the relevant principles of EU law as regards State aid applicable in National courts\" he summarised those principles. He noted that they were largely accepted by the appellants and no issue has been taken with his summary on appeal. It conveniently sets out the most relevant provisions of the TFEU and TEU (the Treaty on European Union), together with citations from a number of leading cases, and relevant principles to be derived from them.\n\n63.....Article 107(1) TFEU provides that \"State aid\" is, in principle, incompatible with the internal market. The commission's role is to examine the compatibility of aid measures with the internal market, based on the criteria laid down in article 107(2)(3) TFEU. This compatibility assessment is the exclusive responsibility of the commission, subject to review by the EU courts. National courts have a complementary role, and must not disregard the limits of their own jurisdiction to prejudice the effectiveness of these articles—see the recent decision of the Court of Justice in Dimosia Epicheirisi Ilektrismou AE (DEI) v Alouminion tis Ellados VEAE (Case C-590/14) EU:C:2016:797.\n\n64. This is based on the duty of sincere co-operation contained in article 4(3) TEU, which provides:\n\n\"Pursuant to the principle of sincere co-operation, the Union and the member states shall, in full mutual respect, assist each other in carrying out tasks which flow from the Treaties.\n\nThe member states shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union.\n\nThe member states shall facilitate the achievement of the Union's tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the Union's objectives.\"\n\n65. As appears from article 4(3) TEU, the ambit of the principle of sincere co-operation is broad; it implies both positive and negative duties and may be engaged irrespective of to whom the relevant EU act is addressed. As the Court of Justice has held in Masterfoods Ltd v HB Ice Cream Ltd (Case C-344/98) [2001] All ER (EC) 130 ; [2000] ECR I-11369, paras 45-60, in the case of antitrust law, and in Deutsche Lufthansa AG v Flughafen Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH (Ryanair Ltd intervening) (Case C-284/12) [2014] 2 CMLR 20, para 41, in the case of State aid law, that duty is:\n\n\"... the application of the European Union rules on State aid is based on an obligation of sincere co-operation between the national courts, on the one hand, and the commission and the courts of the European Union, on the other, in the context of which each acts on the basis of the role assigned to it by the Treaty. In the context of that co-operation, national courts must take all the necessary measures, whether general or specific, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations under European Union law and refrain from those which may jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of the Treaty, as follows from article 4(3) TEU... Therefore, national courts must, in particular, refrain from taking decisions which conflict with a decision of the commission.\" (See the Deutsche Lufthansa AG case, para 41).\n\n66. This was reiterated by the Court of Justice in the Dimosia Epicheirisi Ilektrismou AE (DEI) case EU:C:2016:797, para 105:\n\n\"It must be borne in mind that the application of the EU State aid rules is based on a duty of sincere co-operation between the national courts, on the one hand, and the commission and the European Union courts, on the other, in the context of which each acts on the basis of the role assigned to it by the TFEU. In the context of that co-operation, national courts must take all the measures, whether general or specific, necessary to ensure fulfilment of the obligations under EU law and must refrain from those that may jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of the Treaty, as follows from article 4(3) TEU... Accordingly, national courts must, in particular, refrain from taking decisions that conflict with a decision of the commission (judgment of 21 November 2013, Deutsche Lufthansa (Case C-284/12) [2014] 2 CMLR 20, para 41).\"\n\n67. Article 288 TFEU provides that a decision \"shall be binding in its entirety\" and article 278 TFEU provides that the bringing of actions for annulment before the General Court, as the claimants have, does not suspend the obligations flowing from an act of the EU.\n\n68. The principle as regards State aid law as stated by the Court of Justice is, therefore, that national courts must refrain from taking decisions which conflict with a decision of the commission.\n\n69. In reliance on these and other authorities, the general principle has been stated in the same terms by the Court of Appeal in Emerald Supplies Ltd v British Airways plc (No 1) [2016] Bus LR 145, para 70:\n\n\"The duty under article 4(3)EU is binding on all authorities of the member states, including the courts: see Masterfoods Ltd v HB Ice Cream Ltd (Case C-344/98) [2001] All ER (EC) 130; [2000] ECR I-11369, para 49 (\"Masterfoods\"). The general principle of legal certainty, which underpins the duty of sincere co-operation, requires member states to avoid making decisions that could conflict with a decision contemplated by the commission: see Delimitis v Henniger Brau AG (Case C-234/89) [1991] ECR I-935, para 47 (\"Delimitis\"); Masterfoods, para 51 and National Grid Electricity Transmission v ABB Ltd [2009] EWHC 1326 at [24]. It is only where, in the words of the commission in Delimitis, at para 50, there is \"scarcely any risk\" of a conflict between decisions of domestic and EU institutions, that the national authorities should proceed. Where the EU and domestic authorities have overlapping jurisdictions i.e. considering the same or similar matters, the risk of conflicting decisions will be high.\"\n\n70. This is the jurisprudential basis for the case made by the commission and Romania...\n\n71....They submit that the duty on national courts to refrain from taking steps which conflict with a decision of the commission may require a national court to stay proceedings pending the resolution of a challenge to that decision in the European court. This is so as to avoid the risk of the national court coming to a different conclusion.\n\n72. As noted earlier, in November 2015 the claimants commenced proceedings before the General Court seeking annulment of the Final Decision, and a ruling by the General Court is awaited.\n\n73. The position in such a case was analysed by the English court in Iberian UK Ltd v BPB Industries plc [1997] ICR 164, 186 (a competition case), in which it was said:\n\n\"In my view these cases reinforce and support the following propositions. (1) The courts here should take all reasonable steps to avoid or reduce the risk of arriving at a conclusion which is at variance with a decision of, or on appeal from, the commission in relation to competition law. (2) Except in the clearest cases of breach or non-breach, it will be a proper exercise of discretion to stay proceedings here to await the outcome of the Community proceedings.\"\n\n74. The same approach applies in relation to state aid law: see Kelyn Bacon, European Union Law of State Aid, 2nd ed (2013), para 20.49.\n\n75. This is subject to a materiality threshold: in other words, the risk of a potential conflict with a decision of the European court must be a real one: see, eg, Crehan v Inntrepreneur Pub Co (CPC) (Office of Fair Trading intervening) [2007] 1 AC 333. This does not apply where there is \"scarcely any risk\" of a conflict between decisions of domestic and EU institutions: see the passage cited from the Emerald Supplies Ltd case [2016] Bus LR 145, para 70 above.\n\n76. In summary and so far as relevant, as Romania and the commission submit, in cases concerning state aid: (i) a national court must refrain from taking decisions which conflict with a decision of the European Commission; and (ii) where proceedings are on foot in the European court (ie the General Court or Court of Justice) to annul such a decision, a national court should stay domestic proceedings where there is a material risk of conflict with the decision of the European court pending its decision.\n\nThe judge's reasoning is set out at [108]-[112] of the judgment:\n\n108. It is true that the term \"res judicata\" may have several different meanings. But in the court's view the claimants are correct to submit that, as a matter of English law, the Award became res judicata in the sense of acquiring finality on 11 December 2013, not on 26 February 2016, and so pre-dated both the commission's decisions.\n\n109. The question is what follows from this conclusion. If the court proceeds to enforce the Award against the assets of Romania as if it were a judgment of the court, as the claimants invite it to do, it would be acting in direct contradiction with the Final Decision the effect of which is to prohibit payment by Romania. In this regard, the case is different from European Commission v Slovak Republic [2010] I-13489, where the proceedings in the national court had closed, and the issue was as to recovery: see para 10. In the present case, enforcement has not yet begun in the English court, and court-sanctioned steps to enforce the Award would appear to engender a direct conflict between the court and the commission.\n\n110. Further, account has to be taken of the claimants' annulment proceedings in respect of the Final Decision. The claimants' position is that the res judicata principle is not addressed in the Final Decision (this is not in dispute), and is not in issue in the claimants' proceedings in the General Court to annul that decision. In that regard, the claimants have two points, first that res judicata is not a ground that they advance for annulment of the Final Decision, and second that it does not arise for consideration before the General Court.\n\n111. The first point is not in dispute. However, the second point is in dispute. In its defence in the annulment proceedings, the commission relies on the Klausner Holz Niedersachsen v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen case EU:C:2015:742, contending that it shows that the courts will not accept an outcome that produces a circumvention of the state aid rules by way of res judicata. Whilst the claimants do not raise res judicata as a ground on annulment of the Final Decision, therefore, the issue of res judicata in the context of the decisions of national courts is raised by the commission. In the court's view, Romania and the commission are correct to say that the meaning and scope of the Klausner Holz Niedersachsen case forms part of the General Court appeals, and because it forms part of the argument in these proceedings, there would be a real risk of inconsistent decisions if this court were now to decide as a matter of European law that the Award can be enforced.\n\n112. On this basis, applying the principles set out above, the court considers that the final determination of the issue should be stayed pending the decision of the European court.\n\nIn regard to the application of the principle of effectiveness, the CJEU stated as follows:\n\n42. In that regard, it must be noted that an interpretation of national law, such as that described in paragraph 30 of the present judgment, can have the consequence, in particular, that effects are attributed to the decision of a national court, in the present case the Oberlandesgericht Hamm (Higher Regional Court, Hamm), which frustrate the application of EU law, in that they make it impossible for the national courts to satisfy their obligation to ensure compliance with the third sentence of Article 108(3) TFEU.\n\n43. It follows therefrom that both the State authorities and the recipients of State aid would be able to circumvent the prohibition laid down in the third sentence of Article 108(3) TFEU by obtaining, without relying on EU law on State aid, a declaratory judgment whose effect would enable them, definitively, to continue to implement the aid in question over a number of years. Thus, in a case such as that at issue in the main proceedings, a breach of EU law would recur in respect of each new supply of wood, without it being possible to remedy it.\n\n44. Furthermore, such an interpretation of national law is likely to deprive of any useful effect the exclusive power of the Commission, referred to in paragraph 21 of the present judgment, to assess, subject to review by the EU Courts, the compatibility of aid measures with the internal market. If the Commission, to which the Federal Republic of Germany has in the meantime notified the aid measure constituted by the contracts at issue, should conclude that it is incompatible with the internal market and order its recovery, execution of its decision must fail if a decision of the national court could be raised against it declaring the contracts forming that aid to be 'in force'.\n\n45. In those circumstances, it must be concluded that a national rule which prevents the national court from drawing all the consequences of a breach of the third sentence of Article 108(3) TFEU because of a decision of a national court, which is res judicata, given in a dispute which does not have the same subject-matter and which did not concern the State aid characteristics of the contracts at issue must be regarded as being incompatible with the principle of effectiveness. A significant obstacle to the effective application of EU law and, in particular, a principle as fundamental as that of the control of State aid cannot be justified either by the principle of res judicata or by the principle of legal certainty (see, by analogy, judgments in Fallimento Olimpiclub, EU:C:2009:506, paragraph 31, and Ferreira da Silva e Britto, C-160/14, EU:C:2015:565, paragraph 59).\n\nThe Court's conclusions may be summarised as follows:\n\nA. per Arden and Leggatt LJJ : Section 2(1) of the 1966 Act must be interpreted to give effect to the ICSID Convention in accordance with domestic principles, and, so interpreted, it does not, as the judge held, have the effect of applying EU law to the award on registration simply because the UK is a member state of the EU at that date. Nonetheless, the ICSID Convention does not prevent the national court charged with executing an award from exercising its power to stay enforcement so long as such stay is within the overall purposes of the ICSID Convention. Applying this approach, a stay on execution is justified in this case until the resolution of the GCEU proceedings or further order in the meantime for reasons which are neither dependent on those proceedings nor inconsistent with the overall purpose of the ICSID Convention.\n\nB. per Hamblen LJ: The judge was correct to hold that there was no conflict between the international obligations of the UK contained in the 1966 Act implementing the ICSID Convention and the Court's EU law duties in light of the Commission Decision.\n\nC. per Hamblen and Leggatt LJJ : If there is a conflict between the international obligations of the UK contained in the 1966 Act and the Court's EU law duties, the judge was right to conclude that there should be a stay on the grounds that the issue of whether Article 351 applies in this case is a matter before the GCEU and there is a clear risk of conflicting decisions.\n\nD. per Arden LJ: Article 351 TFEU must normally be considered when determining whether a stay of a duly registered ICSID award can be granted. It falls to be considered in this case even if the judge's ruling is not appealed. Under Article 351(1) TFEU, the rights and duties under a treaty made by a member state prior to accession to the EU with a third country are in general not affected by EU law. Moreover, EU law recognises that it is for the national court, not the CJEU, to determine the extent of obligations under international law imposed on the UK by the ICSID Convention. In addition, there appears to be little overlap between the GCEU proceedings and these proceedings. However, the stay proposed by the majority (which is made pursuant to Article 54 ICSID and section 2(1) of the 1966 Act) converges with any stay that would be given under the duty of sincere co-operation and so it is unnecessary at this stage in the proceedings to reach a final view on that point or on the question whether Article 351 prevents that duty from applying in the first place."
