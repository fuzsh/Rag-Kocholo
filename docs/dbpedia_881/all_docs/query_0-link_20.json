        "text": "The grandmother said they did not give Charlotte an island. What would they give the other 2 children? Sometimes she answers in questions so maybe she is trying to avoid a direct answer. ( I had read that it was in the grandfather's will) She said the press made it up because so little is known about Charlotte. Said Charlotte is reserved, but tough, and does whatever she wants. It says Charlotte did get a certificate from the Sorbonne (per writer). Said Pierre was the wild one and the most like Stephano. Andrea the most sensitive. Says she has met Alex but didn't know him well enough to make a judgement on him. Said that Charlotte was very sensible and was a good student. Said PC started calling her mom even before her marriage and still calls her mom.\n\nSounded like the interview was done in Monaco. The grandmother is in her 80's and still works in the family company.\n\nI don't know what kind of magazine this is. The interview could easily have been made up. Not much we didn't already know.\n\nShe respond clearly that they didn't gave her a island to Charlotte.\n\nAt no time did she say that Charlotte get a certificate from the Sorbonne. They ask her: Is Charlotte in London? and Fernanda answer: Now that she has completed the studies, she lives among London and Montecarlo. She trains for show jumping.\n\nThis es magazine \"Gioia\"\n\nGioia - Abbonati online\n\nThese are some of the answer of Fernanda,\n\n\"Charlotte always have been more calm. A very reserved girl. As the rest of Casiraghi: we are all very reserved. We don't like the reporters.\"\n\nCharlotte has been under the point of view of the press and onlookers since she was little:\n\n\"She defends herself well, being very reserved. She isn't in the point of view as her mother was. And you (referring to the journalists) have far less than talk\"\n\nThey say that with him (Alex), she is more serene.\n\n\"She always has been serene, since she was little girl. She has never had ups and downs, or crisis.\"\n\nIf you have understood me and you want that I translates more, you say me\n\nThanks a lot FanofMonaco and rerehh!\n\nRerehh-your translation was excellent\n\nIn a part of the interview Fernanda was asked about Char's friends? Maybe i'm wrong..\n\nYou're welcome . Here is the entire interview. Sorry for the mistakes, but my English is bad and moreover I've done it quickly.\n\nMy Charlotte won't suffer as Caroline.\n\nShe wants to be a journalist but she knows how to avoid gossip. Words of the grandmother Fernanda: \"She is calm and private. Like a real Casiraghi\".\n\n\"Look what a grandmother can only tell good things of her granddaughter\". Fernanda Casiraghi, Charlotte's grandmother and Stefano's mother. She has just landed in Monaco from Fino Morasco, near Como, where she lives and still works in the family company.\n\n- Has you seen your grandchildren?\n\n- I don't, I don't know where they are. They grow and go away. I'm expert. I have eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. They are the youngest members of the family.\n\n- But they that make themselves heard?\n\n- The grandmothers are always those who call. The others (grandchildren) aren't different. They are young, that's all right.\n\n- I bet you have the photos of all in the chimney\n\n- The photos and the thought in the heart, specially of these three, they grew without a father. Fortunately, they had a good mum.\n\n- Do you get along with Caroline?\n\n- Great, I'm proud of her. She started calling mom even before her marriage and she still do it.\n\n- Are you close up to them when they were growing?\n\n- Always.\n\n- Were you a strict or indulgent grandmother?\n\n- The grandparents always are affectionate, sometimes too much.\n\n- Why? Were they very dynamic?\n\n- (laughter) Pierre was the wilder. He's the most like my Stefano. He only has been with his father the first three years of his life, but he has the same personality. The DNA does not lie.\n\n- And, How was Charlotte?\n\n- Charlotte always have been more calm. A very reserved girl. As the rest of Casiraghi: we are all very reserved. We don't like the reporters.\n\n- And Andrea?\n\n- He was a big boy when his father died, of the three, he's the most suffered. He's the most sensitive.\n\n- Do they get along?\n\n- They are very close from each other, they go on holiday together, support each other. The lack of his father what keeps them close.\n\n- Can you describe to Charlotte?\n\n- She has ulterior determination ( I don't understand this part very well in Italian, so in English...). She is docile and sweet, but is tenacious, and she does whatever she wants.\n\n- Is it true the island history?\n\n- What island?\n\n- It's said that when Charlotte turned five her grandparents gave her a island off Sardinia.\n\n- No, It’s a legend. Excuse me, but, what does a kid with a island? and, with two others, what we give them? but, Who told those?\n\n- The papers say it, Charlotte's biography on the web\n\n- Before, was only the papers, now Internet does hurt also.\n\n- Charlotte has been under the point of view of the press and onlookers since she was little.\n\n- She defends herself well, being very reserved. She isn't in the point of view as her mother was. And you (referring to the journalists) have far less than talk.\n\n- Do you advise them?\n\n- If they ask me, advise. But are smart, don't need my advise.\n\n- Is Charlotte in London?\n\n- Now that she has completed the studies, she lives among London and Montecarlo. She trains for show jumping.\n\n- All her friends seems to be of the high society.\n\n- You find friends according to the circles you move in, but you don't have because look like them.\n\n- It seems your granddaughter likes to write.\n\n- She is interested journalism, but want to do it herself.\n\n- What you wish for her?\n\n- I'd like her to have a beautiful family, become a good mother\n\n- A good mother with a good job, as you?\n\n- True, I have worked hard and still work. But, I wish she would calm a little more family.\n\n- Do you know Charlotte's boyfriend?\n\n- Of course.\n\n- Does he have approved of the grandmother?\n\n- I don't know him well enough to make a judgement on him. But Charlotte is a sensible girl. I hope she has chosen well.\n\n-They say that with him, she is more serene.\n\n- She always has been serene, since she was little girl. She has never had ups and downs, or crisis.\n\nI agree. Also when she´s asked about Charlotte´s friend being socialites. She asnwers that you find friends according to the circles you move in. In part it´s true. But you also choose your friends. One thing I dislike of Charlotte is that she doesn´t have any otner type of friend. Didn´t she make fiends at university for example?\n\nRosana, We don't know all her friends"
