        "text": "Profine - the leading company in PVC window an doors profiles - is not just a company. It‚Äôs a attitude. We are aiming for producing products which are 100 % sustainable made out of material and energy which is 100 % sustainable. I have my wife, our four children and all of our relatives reminding me day by day about the current desatreous situation and a loose sense of caretaking in the world and requesting me to find answers in our small industry-universe. And so we are acting since some time: Did you know that we recycle every bits and peaces of old windows and give them a new life? That we use every gram of scrap to be reused in our production process? Did you know that the durability of our products extends more then 500 years because we can reuse the material of old windows again and again and again? Did you know that this is NOT possible with wood windows and hardly with aluminum windows? We‚Äôre taking care of a sustainable future. This is our mission right from the beginning as I took over the company in 2012. And we will continue with that - day by day. This is my promise. Company owner CEO Peter Mrosik Today for tomorrow Sustainability\n\nRode the new #RoyalEnfield #himalayan450 in the Himalayas a couple of months ago, and came back impressed. A few takeaways from that ride was a weak bottom end, sharp brakes, superb handling and very good performance. But at over 10,000 feet a.s.l., we couldn‚Äôt explore the full performance. While you can check out the full review by Kingshuk Dutta below, I rode it for sometime on home ground and here are some takeaways of mine again, this time from the plains. Pros: ‚û°Ô∏è superb balance off-road and on-road ‚û°Ô∏è engine is punchy for long highway runs ‚û°Ô∏è superb brakes ‚û°Ô∏è suspension is very impressive, both on the road and off it. Soaks up all kinds of terrain Cons: ‚û°Ô∏è weak bottom end - below 3,000 rpm torque falls drastically, so no pull at low revs ‚û°Ô∏è engine isn‚Äôt as refined as expected, particularly in highway usable range, which becomes bothersome ‚û°Ô∏è weight isn‚Äôt friendly for off-road newbies Do check out the video review and leave a comment on YouTube below: https://lnkd.in/gCmsGcRE\n\nüèüÔ∏è A new window to the sky in Montreal, promising astronomical impact! According to Radio-Canada, these renovations are expected to generate $1.5 billion over 10 years, at a rate of $150 million per year, surpassing the current annual impact of $68 million. üåê What to expect? - Delivery scheduled for 2028 after four years of construction. - A fixed, rigid, and durable structure. - A commitment to modernity with a new lightweight structure in transparent glass, allowing in natural light. - Over 150 events per year to bring life to this iconic venue. Why keep it? üèüÔ∏è - The largest stadium in Quebec with over 50,000 seating capacity. - Destruction is estimated at $2 billion, making this renovation an economic option. üåè Renovation always yields a more positive environmental impact compared to the destruction or creation of entirely new buildings.
