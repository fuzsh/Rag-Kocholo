        "text": "Kiefer Sat Jun 06, 2015 10:51 pm\n\nHello,\n\nI proudly present my new American viewing stone. The beautiful daiza is made by Patrick M., he found the stone along the Cedar River in Washington.\n\nPatrick gave the stone the name: \"Mi Fu\" - remembering the famous scholar of the Song dynasty who lived from 1051-1107 and loved greeting a beautiful garden gongshi, calling him \"elder brother\". I like the thought of this stone resembling a scholar bowing to a rock. Considering that Mi Fu was a heavy drinker, too, I am glad that the stone wasn't labeled \"The morning after...\"\n\nThe stone is uncut, naturally flat, and so perfectly balanced that it even stands without the daiza. It has two sides, I never know which view I prefer.\n\nI love my little Mi Fu!\n\nRe: A stone named Mi Fu\n\nJimLewis Sun Jun 21, 2015 1:43 pm\n\nBut I wonder why a Chinese name for a North American stone? Not that it's any of my business. . . .\n\nRe: A stone named Mi Fu\n\nPrecarious Sun Jun 21, 2015 4:50 pm\n\nMaybe it's just a matter of dimension. An Earth name for a stone from Earth.\n\nRe: A stone named Mi Fu\n\nKiefer Sun Jun 21, 2015 8:01 pm\n\nThanks for your interest! The height above the lip is 4,5 inches. I didn't dare to share Patrick's full name here - but I adore his works... And if someone recognizes his style I would be glad, too.\n\nRe: A stone named Mi Fu\n\nKiefer Sun Jun 21, 2015 9:13 pm\n\nAn American stone with a Chinese name in an European collection - that's the meaning of stone art for me.\n\nRe: A stone named Mi Fu\n\nGuest Mon Jun 22, 2015 10:22 am\n\nHi Kiefer\n\nI like your stone, and the daiza is true to the the chinese name, witch is to the chinese taste...this tell me the finder and carver like the chinese influence, and you too...a story of a stone, and a corner of two people\n\nI have a danish stone I call kappa...It look like the japanese creature. This is telling something of me and my influence.\n\nA stone I found in Kamogawa is named by my friend the president of Kyoto-Uji Suiseki Club....it is a stunning name I never could have found...Keichitsu...it describes the time of year when bugs that hypernated in the ground wake up and surface...this name because of the surfacepatern, that look like old leafes on the ground\n\nKeichitsu\n\nKind regards Yvonne\n\nRe: A stone named Mi Fu\n\nGuest Tue Jun 23, 2015 8:38 am\n\nHi Stefan\n\nFirst of all...thank you for your kind words, and then... if I can inspire people to love the stones , am I only pleased to do it, what can be better than to inspire other people, while doing it my self\n\nThe stone on FB, has had many likes, by people I like, and people I like and and respect for their work... it is one of my small darlings.\n\nA Club would be nice, but we are not enough people in Denmark who are interested, and noone live close to each other\n\nAbout exhibitions...I dont know how important it is to me to exhibit stones, I like my stones on the daily basis...There are a few exhibitions during the year...In Denmark once a year as a part of the bonsaiexhibition...ESA, as a part of EBA is a option, but this year is it too far away for me. 20 hours by car each way...I have ben told I can exhibit at the Noelanders Trophy in 2016...I would like to exhibit, but I am not sure I can go, as my friends who I drive with, may not go. And then there is the big Japan Suiseki Exhibition in Tokyo in February...I have a stone accepted again this year, and will ofcourse go there, I love being in Japan.\n\nKind regards Yvonne\n\nRe: A stone named Mi Fu\n\nGuest Tue Jun 23, 2015 6:02 pm\n\nDear Kiefer\n\nOfcourse am I very happy to have stones, worth showing in Japan... hope to see you there one day\n\nKind regards Yvonne\n\nRe: A stone named Mi Fu\n\nTentakelaertje Wed Jun 24, 2015 10:50 am\n\nHaving a rock showed is cool anyways, but it being exhibited in Japan sure gives some extra kudos!\n\nYvonne, would you mind showing us the stone you'll be having exhibited in Japan?\n\nThanks in advance, Tentakelaertje\n\nRe: A stone named Mi Fu\n\nTentakelaertje Wed Jun 24, 2015 2:34 pm\n\nThis stone is very nice Yvonne!\n\nWhen is the exhibition?\n\nOf course I got a real name! Mine's Maarten. Maarten is perhaps a little better pronouncable for you non-Dutchies\n\nRe: A stone named Mi Fu\n\nGuest Wed Jun 24, 2015 3:01 pm\n\nStefan and maarten\n\nThe next Japan Suiseki Exhibition is in the middle of february...the exact date is not up yet\n\nKind regards Yvonne\n\nRe: A stone named Mi Fu\n\nGuest Wed Jun 24, 2015 6:20 pm\n\nYvonne Graubaek wrote:Hi Kiefer\n\nI like your stone, and the daiza is true to the the chinese name, witch is to the chinese taste...this tell me the finder and carver like the chinese influence, and you too...a story of a stone, and a corner of two people\n\nI have a danish stone I call kappa...It look like the japanese creature.
