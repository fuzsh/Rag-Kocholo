He was from Ch'i-hsien in Honan province and was known as a painter of landscapes, figures, flowers, and ink bamboo. He worked in a style and developed compositions that are associated with Northern Sung painters like Kuo Hsi and Li Ch'eng.\n\nFollowing the Li-Kuo style, Kuo Min builds up forms to create this composition of towering mountains fraught with looming overhangs. This unstable landscape creates a tension that is further heightened by the bleakness of winter.\n\nThe painting is signed between two trees at the bottom right.\n\nWalking on a Path Among Flowers 15-early 16 century A.D. 1999.45.3\n\nCreator/Collector: Shen, Chou\n\nPhysical Description: Painting hanging scroll: ink and color on silk China\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nGift of James Cahill and Hsingyuan Tsao\n\nAlbum of Twelve Landscapes in Old Styles 1666 CC.212\n\nCreator/Collector: Wang Chien\n\nPhysical Description: Painting album: ink on paper China h 14 x w 10 -3/4 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nOn extended loan from the Ching Yüan Chai Collection\n\nDescription\n\nt: Yuän-chao\n\nh: Hsiang-pi, Lien-chou, Jan-hsiang an-chu\n\nFrom T'ai-ts'ang, Chiangsu\n\nThe second of the \"Four Wangs,\" and one of the \"Nine Friends in Painting,\" Wang Chien came from a family dedicated to learning and painting. He was a follower of Tung Ch'i-chang and copied from the Yüan masters, developing a conservative approach to landscape composition. He was for a time governor of Lien-chou, Kuangtung province but was more interested in painting than politics and retired from public life.\n\nSunset in an Autumn Valley: Landscape with Man in House 1544 2002.2.3\n\nCreator/Collector: Shen Shih (Shen Shi)\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Hanging scroll: ink on paper China h 38 x w 12 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nPurchase made possible through a gift from an anonymous donor\n\nDescription\n\nShen Shih was from Suchou but had also lived in Nanking. He studied the Sung and Yüan masters as well as the professional artists T'ang Yin and Ch'iu Ying and is said to have copied old paintings. Only a few works carry his own signature.\n\nIn this autumn landscape we see more of the influence of the Wu school master Wen Cheng-ming. Shen Shih's light and deft brushwork are reminiscent of other better-known painters like Shen Chou. The two poetic inscriptions on the top right of this work are by Wen Po-jen (nephew of Wen Cheng-ming, whose work is in the exhibition) and another Shen Shih. The artist Shen Shih indicates it was painted for Mr. Chu-lin of Nanking.\n\nOld Trees and Landscape (in the tradition of Miu Fu (15th c.)) mid 15 century A.D. 2002.2.6\n\nCreator/Collector: Unknown\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Hanging scroll: ink and color on paper China, Ming h 44 x w 16 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nPurchase made possible through a gift from an anonymous donor\n\nDescription\n\nA tradition of painting old, gnarled trees began as early as the Northern Sung period and extended throughout Chinese painting history. Li Ch'eng (919-967) was one of the most famous artists known for depictions of rough old trees in landscape. The Ming artist Wen Cheng-ming continued the tradition that allowed for great expression to be lent to a simple twisting of trunks.\n\nOld Tree and Bamboo (in the manner of Wu Chen (1280-1354)) 1559 2002.1.3\n\nCreator/Collector: Hsieh Shih-ch'en (Xie Shichen)\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Hanging scroll: ink on paper China h 41 -1/4 x w 21 -1/2 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nPurchase made possible through a gift from an anonymous donor\n\nDescription\n\nt: Ssu-chung\n\nh: Ch'u-hsien\n\nHsieh Shih-ch'en was from Suchou and spent most of his life painting there. His family was wealthy yet he appears to have become a professional painter in a town that was just beginning to gain prominence for both amateur and professional painters. It is recorded that he followed Shen Chou's style adding bits of his own and other professional painters' ideas to the mix. He is best known as a landscape painter with a very deft and versatile brush.\n\nLandscape with Cranes and Other Birds early 16 century A.D. cm.96\n\nCreator/Collector: Lü Chi (Lu Ji)\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Hanging scroll: ink and color on silk China h 58 -1/2 x w 33 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nOn extended loan from the Nicholas Cahill Collection\n\nDescription\n\nt: T'ing-chen\n\nh: Lo-yü\n\nLü Chi was a court painter during the Hung-chih period (1488-1506) and was known for his depictions of birds and flowers. He was from Ning-p'o, a city east of Hangchou, where a flourishing commercial center for painting had existed for centuries. In his paintings he followed T'ang and Sung masters and also imitated paintings by the later artist Pien Wen-chin (ca. 1356-1428) as well as Pien's near contemporary Lin Liang (1455-1500), who was already at court when Lü Chi arrived around 1490.\n\n\"The seal below the artist's signature reads \"Jih-chin ch'ing-kuang,\" a seal that appears on a number of works by artists who served in the Ming imperial academy. It was Wai-kam Ho [a curator at the Cleveland Museum of Art] who first [to my knowledge] figured out what it means: 'Daily approaching [being close to] the Pure and Radiant,' used by artists who had the privilege of working in the presence of the emperor. The Chinese emperors often enjoyed having artists as their companions [they were given quasi-military titles as if in the Imperial Guard] and watching them paint.The circular forms at the base of the overhanging cliff are visually confusing - some [students] in my seminar argued that the fading away above them represents a recession into a hollow of space. But if one knows earlier representations of the same motif [especially Sung], it's clear that it's an overhanging cliff, the upper part obscured in mist, the lower part eroded and hollowed by water striking against it. By the constant copying and imitating of the earlier, more naturalistic and readable form, derived from observation of natural forms and phenomena, the motif has become visually ambiguous, as commonly happened within Chinese painting traditions.\"\n\nLandscape with Scholar and Servant 18 century A.D. 2002.1.2\n\nCreator/Collector: Huang Shen\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Hanging scroll: ink and color on paper China h 42 x w 54 -3/4 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nPurchase made possible through a gift from an anonymous donor\n\nDescription\n\n\"The size and shape suggests that [this scroll] might have been mounted as a screen. This may account for the fact that it's rather beat up, as if exposed a lot, but still strong . . . Huang Shen often did big pictures, but they tended to be of large, sometimes rather gross figures. This one is better than most, although also, no doubt, done rather quickly. . . he was prolific, [and] adopted a style that would permit him to be.\"\n\nThe Wang-Ch'uan Villa (in the manner of Wang Wei (699-759)) 17 century A.D. 2002.2.2\n\nCreator/Collector: Chang Chi-su (Zhang Jisu)\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Handscroll: ink on silk China h 12 -5/16 x w 153 -1/4 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nPurchase made possible through a gift from an anonymous donor\n\nDescription\n\nChang Chi-su worked outside of the mainstream of seventeenth-century painting and was less susceptible to the critical currents of the Sung-chiang area. He was from P'u-chou, present-day Yung-chi in Shansi province. Chang's work carries the flavor of the Nanking school painters like Wu Pin. In this handscroll we also see some signs of Western influences in his style.\n\n\"Chang Chi-su apparently at some point in his career had been able to see and study what he took to be the original of Wang Wei's famous scroll of the Wang-Ch'uan Villa. Wang Wei was an eighth-century poet painter, later hailed as the forefather of literati amateur/scholar painters. Wang Wei [in his famous scroll] had painted the surroundings of his villa, the Wang-ch'uan River. Originally on the walls of his villa, the composition came down through the centuries in various ways. A version of it surfaced in the late Ming and was taken by some people to be the original - it was engraved in stone and so forth. So Chang Chi-su was able to see this and he did various versions of it. I think five of them exist, four plus this one.\"\n\nLandscape with Houses on a Mountainside (Waterfall on Mt. K'uang-Lu) 17 century A.D. 2002.2.7\n\nCreator/Collector: Kung Hsien (Gong Xian)\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Hanging scroll: ink on paper China h 44 -1/4 x w 17 -1/2 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nPurchase made possible through a gift from an anonymous donor\n\nLandscape with Figures (in the manner of Kuo Hsi (ca. 1000 - ca.1090)) Late 13-mid 14 century A.D. 2002.2.4\n\nCreator/Collector: Unknown\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Hanging scroll: ink on silk China h 29 -5/8 x w 15 -1/4 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nPurchase made possible through a gift from an anonymous donor\n\nDescription\n\nThe style associated with the Northern Sung painter and theoretician Kuo Hsi (eleventh century) can be seen clearly in this monumental landscape painting. Landscape painting of the Northern Sung emphasized the enormity of nature and the smallness of man. According to writings attributed to Kuo Hsi, the artist's state of mind played a significant role in his ability to truly depict the essence of the natural world. His son Kuo Ssu wrote of his father's teachings that: \"[The artist] must do his work with his whole soul; if he does not work with his whole soul, the essential will not be clear. He must be severe and respectful in his work, otherwise it will lack depth of thought. He must apply zeal and reverence to complete it, otherwise the picture will not be properly finished.\" (Translation from Siren)\n\nIn the Northern Sung dynasty style, large symmetrical landscape forms are built up in layers and densely textured with a variety of brush techniques. This Yüan version establishes a greater separation between the viewer and the scene, but closely follows the Northern Sung methods of multipoint perspective and the tilting of the far peak, which distorts the central mountain.\n\nScholars Gazing at the Moon and Reflections of It in the Water 17 century A.D. CM.24.a\n\nCreator/Collector: Ch'en Ch'üan (Chen Quan)\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Hanging scroll: ink and colors on silk China, Late Ming or early Ch'ing h 43 -5/8 x w 17 -7/8 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nOn extended loan from the Nicholas Cahill Collection\n\nDescription\n\nInscription by artist: Verse couplet. \"I have depicted: 'All the moons in the water are held by a single moon; One single moon can thus hold all the lakes and rivers' - an allusion to the Ch'an Buddhist poem: \"The moon imprints itself on a thousand rivers,/ and yet, in reality, is a single moon.\" Translation by Patricia Berger\n\n\"[In this painting] scholars here and there throughout the picture are all looking at reflections of the moon. There are scholars on the bridge looking at one reflection of the moon and there are people in the foreground looking at another. Then there's the real moon up in the sky. It's quite a wonderful conception . . . What the picture really is showing is a Ch'an or Zen Buddhist idea [with] the inscription meaning something like, 'all phenomena and things go back to one cause and are infinitely manifested on earth.' The idea is that everybody sees a different reflection of the moon, but they all go back to one real moon. The picture was done for a Zen monk, it turns out.\"\n\nThis is the only known work by the unrecorded artist Ch'en Ch'üan, whose influences - notably the use of lush washes of ink and vivid brushwork - appear to have come from Che school adherents in the Hangchou area.\n\nLandscape with Pavilion at the Foot of a Waterfall 1963 CT.39\n\nCreator/Collector: Wang Chi-ch'uan\n\nPhysical Description: Painting hanging scroll: ink and colors on paper China\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nOn extended loan from the Ching Yuan Chai Collection\n\nPlum Tree and Ducks by a Stream early 13 century A.D. 2000.29\n\nCreator/Collector: Ma Yüan (Ma Yuan)\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Hanging scroll: ink and colors on silk China h 31 -1/2 x w 18 -1/2 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nPurchased made possible through a gift from an anonymous donor\n\nDescription\n\nh: Ch'in-shan\n\nMa Yüan was from Ho-chung, Shansi province. He was the principal artistic exponent of a school of painting associated with the Southern Sung dynasty court; he painted during the Shao-hsi era (1190-1194) and was still active in Emperor Li-tsung's reign (1225-1264). He and Hsia Kuei lend their names to the most famous school of the Southern Sung period, the Ma-Hsia school.\n\nThis school, working from a basis established in the Northern Sung period, depicted a natural and somewhat romanticized landscape. In this painting, like many of his typical compositions, a dense corner composition is incorporated with an open, misty middle ground, with views to the distant hills. Hence the artist's sobriquet \"one corner Ma.\"\n\nThe court and the Painting Academy that Ma served were centered in the beautiful town of Hangchou, home to the scenic West Lake and long known as a place of culture, art, and poetry. Ma Yüan was firmly associated with the Academy, taking his place as the fourth-generation painter in his family to serve the Emperor. There are many paintings attributed to this artist but only a very few genuine examples of his work.\n\n\"[When I saw this painting] I immediately took it to be a genuine Ma Yüan, [with a] good signature [only trimmed at the bottom], and told [the dealer] so, asking whether the price wasn't too low. He said, 'We'll sell you this cheap this time, and something else expensive next time.' So I bought it. As it happened, I had just finished giving my course on early Chinese painting, through Sung, and had shown students how genuine Ma Yüans can be distinguished from imitations and copies: the more fluid drawing of the plum tree [stiff and angular in copies, typically]; the gradual fading and loss of detail in a three-step recession; the way the space funnels back in an S-curve, and so forth.\"\n\nA Scholar Instructing Girl Pupils in the Arts 17 century A.D. 1967.12\n\nCreator/Collector: Chen Hungshou\n\nPhysical Description: Painting ink and color on silk China h 35 -3/4 x w 18 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nGift of Elizabeth Hay Bechtel, Class of 1925\n\nThe Garden of the Secluded Villa 1706 1997.4.2\n\nCreator/Collector: Yüan Chiang (Yuan Jiang)\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Folding fan: ink and colors on paper China h 7 -1/8 x w 20 -7/8 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nPurchase made possible through a gift from Lurie Fund\n\nDescription\n\nt: Wen-t'ao\n\nYüan Chiang was from Chiang-tu in Chiangsu province, an area that had produced a number of painters. He was a court painter in the Yung-cheng period (1723-1735). He was known for large, decorative paintings in the spirit of the Northern Sung masters, but here in this small fan format he captures an intimate moment in time with a scholar seated at his lakeside pavilion. He exploits the rounded fan shape by echoing it in rocks, bridges, and water.\n\nThree Figures, Illustration to Shih Ching, Tsai Chu Poem (in the manner of Ma Ho-chih) n.d. 2001.4.6\n\nCreator/Collector: Unknown\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Fan-shaped album leaf, mounted as hanging scroll: ink and colors on silk.

He is best known as a figure painter and was often compared to Ts'ui Tzu-chung, hence the phrase \"Nan Ch'en pei Ts'ui,\" (Ch'en in the South, Ts'ui in the North). His paintings of historical characters always carry a feeling of the antique and often harbor a sense of estrangement.\n\n\"This painting is from Ch'en's middle period, the 1630s, when his paintings often seem heavy-handed and unsubtle [he was keeping up a copious commercial output to support himself, with studio assistants]. But this one, the more you look at it, turns out to be full of subtleties and intricacies, and is really quite moving in the end.\"\n\nUntitled (album of birds, flowers, and landscapes) 17 century A.D. 1996.49.2.a-l\n\nCreator/Collector: Ch'en Hung-shou (Chen Hungshou)\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Album: ink and colors on silk China, Ming Dynasty h 8 -1/4 x w 6 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nGift of James Cahill\n\nDescription\n\nAs a young boy Ch'en studied with the great professional landscapist Lan Ying and was a star pupil. His landscape paintings often show a strong decorative quality that demonstrates his ability to go beyond his teachers' example. Ch'en attempted the civil service examinations three times; after his third failure he turned his attention permanently to painting and began designing woodblocks. He also gained a reputation as a drinker and lover of women and other amusements.\n\n\"This [work by Ch'en Hung-shou] is a small, almost pocket album. It's painted in a stiff style, almost like designs for lacquer, or something decorative . . . Mostly Ch'en Hung-shou is [regarded as] a figure master, very refined. [However], before he became a really refined painter he started out rather deliberately emphasizing his craft origin. So, that this could be a genuine Ch'en Hung-shou was something I didn't originally believe, but came around to it as everyone did, and now everybody recognizes it for the real thing.\"\n\nTrilling Bird on Branch 18 century A.D. 2001.4.2\n\nCreator/Collector: Hua, Yen\n\nPhysical Description: Painting hanging scroll: ink and color on paper China h 52 x w 21 -1/4 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nPurchase made possible through a gift from an anonymous donor\n\nBrush Fire with Animals Fleeing 18 century A.D. cc.64\n\nCreator/Collector: Hua Yen (Hua Yan)\n\nPhysical Description: Painting Album leaf mounted as hanging scroll: ink and color on paper China h 21 x w 20 -3/4 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nOn extended loan from the Nicholas Cahill Collection\n\nDescription\n\nt: Ch'iu-yüeh\n\nh: Hsin-lo shan-jen\n\nHua Yen was born in Lin-t'ing, Fuchien province, but moved to Hangchou and then Yangchou, both major painting centers in the early eighteenth century. He was very active with a group of artists who had been involved in various ways with the late seventeenth-century painter Tao-chi. By the 1730s, Hua Yen's compositions follow those of that master of the spontaneous and unexpected.\n\n\"Hua Yen is a major, very versatile artist of the first half of the eighteenth-century . . . and very famous now. Quite a lot of his work is around, but this is a very special subject. [When I bought this work] it looked kind of coarse, with a five-character title, plus the seal of Hua Yen, but no signature. And it was not published. [However] the animals are very sensitively painted. You can see through the smoke and fire and see the line of red fire going across. [There is] wonderful use of ink, a highly unconventional painting. In this period, in Yangchou, and in eighteenth-century painting generally, something gives way in the restrictions on subject matter and suddenly they could do things with sort of ominous or painful overtones. This has become a favorite painting, partly because it breaks the rules. Over the years, as I have said to many people now, I have come to value more the odd corners, the dissidents, the unorthodox, I mean people who really break the rules. There are lots of painters in Yangchou who are eccentric, but [I mean] painters who really break new ground, like this one.\"\n\nUntitled (branch of flowering cherry or plum, calligraphy below) 18 century A.D. 1980.42.19\n\nCreator/Collector: Shen, Ch'üan (attributed to)\n\nPhysical Description: Painting hanging scroll: ink and color on silk China h 37 -1/2 x w 16 -1/2 inches\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nGift of the Bo-an Collection\n\nAlbum of Ten Leaves of Flower and Landscapes 1676 CC.184\n\nCreator/Collector: Yun Shou-p'ing\n\nPhysical Description: Painting album: ink and color on paper China\n\nContributing Institution: Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive\n\nCustodial History\n\nPrivate collection\n\nDescription\n\nt: Cheng-shu\n\nh: Nan-t'ien, Yün-shi wai-shih, Pai-yün wai-shih, Tung-yüan ts'ao-i\n\nIn this album Yün uses a technique known as the \"boneless\" (mogu) to depict the flowers, leaves, and stalks. This method uses shading and ink and color gradations to describe the plant without outline. It was a technique that can trace its roots to the eleventh-century painter Hsü Ch'ung-ssu. Other artists of the early Ming were also using this technique, but in Yün's hands it creates an extremely airy and light appearance, almost as if the plants were floating in space.\n\nBamboo Growing by a Rock 15 century A.D.
