        "text": "Description\n\nThe official, artist, collector, and connoisseur Mi Fu developed a personal, idiosyncratic form of running script, though he took pride in having mastered many earlier models. He especially admired the unaffected spontaneity of Eastern Jin calligraphers such as Wang Xizhi (303â361), whose brushwork seemed to reflect personal moods. Similar qualities enliven Miâs Three Letters, written when he was serving as a local official. Identified by their opening lines, the letters display subtle contrasts of brushwork that correspond to the differing circumstances under which they were written.\n\nIn Abundant Harvest, Mi refers to his good fortune in holding office during a time of peace and prosperity. His calligraphy was written at a leisurely pace with smooth, elegant turns of the brush. Escaping Summer Heat reports his satisfaction at spending summer in the cool mountains, without mention of his refusal to collect taxes after a bad harvest. In this letter, Mi employs more angular brushwork in characters that appear slightly misshapen. In Hasty Reply before Guests, Mi confesses that he is dodging a visit from a court official sent to investigate his management of district affairs. Miâs unease seems to be reflected in the impetuous, more cursive brushwork of the letter.\n\nPublished References & Reproductions\n\nShen C.Y.
