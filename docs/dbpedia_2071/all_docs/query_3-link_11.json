        "text": "Yu Ming, a close friend of Wu Changshi (1844–1927), worked in Shanghai, primarily as a figure painter. Here, Yu depicts a famous story about the Northern Song poet, politician, painter, and connoisseur Mi Fu (1052–1107), who was known as much for his outspokenness as for his refined tastes. The painting recalls Mi's appointment to the post of magistrate in the district of Wuwei (present-day Anhui). When Mi entered the official residence for the first time, he was struck by an imposing rock in the garden. He immediately called for his official robe and tablet of office, then bowed deeply to the stone, addressing it as \"Elder Brother Rock.\""
