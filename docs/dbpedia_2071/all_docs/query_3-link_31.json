        "text": "China Mifu Calligraphy Park is located in Dantu District, Zhenjiang City. It is the only cultural theme park in the country that is named after a prominent calligrapher. Against the Ten Li Hill, the park is built based on the landscape features. The scenic spots are so uninterrupted that visitors seemingly travel through time to talk with the great calligrapher and be deeply touched by the art of painting while appreciating Mi Fuâs works of calligraphy.\n\n[Mi Fu]\n\nMi Fu was a Chinese calligrapher and painter in the Northern Song Dynasty. In painting he gained renown for his style of painting unique landscapes and created the School of Mi Fu Landscapes. Mi also showed precocious talent in calligraphy and proficiency in a number of different calligraphy styles. Dantu (Zhenjiang City) had been his residence for over four decades, where his calligraphy and painting reached their peaks. After he passed away, he was buried at the Huanghe Hill of Dantu. Therefore, in order to commemorate the art master who had deep historic link with Zhenjiang, Mifu Calligraphy Park is built.\n\n[Ruimoxuan Calligraphy and Stone Carvings Corridor]\n\nThe core culture of the park is âOne Stele Corridor and Nine Galleriesâ. The former refers to Ruimoxuan Calligraphy and Stone Carvings Corridor which displays a large number of the works of Mi Fu. The 680-meter stele corridor winds up the hill in connection with 9 galleries. More than 1,300 copies of stone carvings are displayed there, including copies of the Song and Ming Dynasties as well as those newly reproduced copies from Dantu District.\n\n[Gallery of Reproduction of Dantu Mi Fuâs Calligraphy Works]\n\nIn 2009, The Complete Works of Mi Fu's Calligraphy was jointly published by Dantu District and the Palace Museum. Based on the original works of Mi Fu provided by the Palace Museum, a total of 64 pieces of works reproduced in the same size of the original ones are included in Reproduction of Dantu Mi Fuâs Calligraphy Works."
