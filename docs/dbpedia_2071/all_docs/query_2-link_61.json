        "text": "Winning out over strong competition from other museums, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has acquired a gift of 60 major works of early Chinese painting and calligraphy. It is from a collection regarded as the world's greatest concentration of such art in private hands.\n\nConservatively estimated to be worth $18 million, the promised gift - of works ranging from the 11th to the 18th century - is cited by Met officials as ''one of the finest in the history of the museum.'' They and outside authorities say the gift will raise the status of the museum's department of Chinese art - formerly thin in representation of the early periods -to one of the country's foremost.\n\nAccording to scholars, the 60 works make up the heart of the collection of 200 pieces of John M. Crawford Jr., a bibliophile, collector and patron of the arts. They represent the last paintings and calligraphies of this quality available anywhere in the world except China.\n\nPhilippe de Montebello, director of the Met, said of the gift: ''It means we now have a collection not only outstanding in depth and quality, but also in comprehensiveness. Where once we were woefully deficient, in comparison with other departments at the Met, we now have a well-rounded overview of the field.''\n\nThe 68-year-old Mr. Crawford is said to be a pioneer among Western collectors in his systematic acquisition of Chinese calligraphy - the writing of ideographs with a brush. The discipline is regarded by the Chinese as a purer, if not higher, artistic form than painting. Mr. Crawford's gift, according to Mr. de Montebello, makes the Met ''the first museum in the West to have both Chinese calligraphy and painting equally well represented.''\n\nAmong the most significant works are a group of 14 paintings and calligraphies from the Sung period (A.D. 960-1279), including two major calligraphic handscrolls by the 11th-century masters Huang T'ing-chien and Mi Fu, and one of the finest Northern Sung landscape paintings, Kuo Hsi's ''Trees Against a Flat Vista'' (about 1075). The group also includes two well-known landscape handscrolls, ''Streams and Mountains in Fresh Snow,'' attributed to Kao K'o-ming, from the first half of the 11th century, and ''Fishing Village at Hsi-sai Mountain,'' attributed to Wang Shen, from the second half of the 11th century.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
