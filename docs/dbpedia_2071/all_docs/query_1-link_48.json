        "text": "LOTS 1559-1594 PROPERTY FROM THE GENERAL HUANG FAMILY COLLECTION This collection was assembled by General Huang Jie (Huang Chieh, 1902-1995), who was also known as Dayun. Born in Changsha, Huang was one of the first graduates of the prestigious Whampoa Military Academy in 1925. General Huang served in numerous important military and administrative capacities throughout his long career. He distinguished himself early on by successfully defending important posts against the Japanese occupation. These efforts culminated in several successful sieges in 1944 and the capture of the strategic Linlong in Yunnan. In 1949 General Huang led 30,000 troops to Vietnam and occupied Phu Quoc Island until he decided to settle in Taiwan. There he served in the senior civilian capacities of Governor of Taiwan Province from 1962 to 1969 and Minister of Defense from 1969 to 1972. General Huang was an enthusiastic art practitioner and aficionado. He was a skillful poet and avid calligrapher. He befriended many of the artists of his period and enjoyed looking at paintings with them, as well as often collecting their works, including those of Zhang Daqian, Qi Baishi, and Pu Ru, as offered here by General Huang's family. Other works from the same collection will be offered in the Fine Chinese Classical Paintings and Calligraphy Sale on 25 November 2014 (Lots 1110-1112) and Important Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art Sale on 26 November 2014 (Lots 3437-3442).\n\nYE YUN (1901-1983)/WU LEICHUAN (20TH CENTURY)\n\nMi Fu Bowing to Rock/Calligraphy"
