(Eminent artists were often invited to write colophons to authenticate or simply to increase the value of the works.) Technically and conceptually, this moistly atmospheric landscape is a clear link to an earlier tradition begun by Mi Fu (1051–1107) during the Northern Song era (960–1127). Graduated ink washes have been applied in a limited range of tonal densities, and only a few brushstrokes, many consisting of simple horizontal dots, are used to construct the impressionistic landscape forms. This basic style, reliant on ink-wash technique rather than precise delineation, had tremendous influence on subsequent landscape painting in both China and Japan.",
