Van Gulik with an introduction and notes. Bibliographical list of abbreviation. This rare monograph appeared in a small print run in 1938 and was published in China. Mi Fu (or Mi Fei) was the celebrated Sung painter, critic and connoisseur. Here is an important look at Chinese painting and calligraphy. Van Gulik noted that the Yen shih furnishes material about Mi Fu's critical methods. Here the matter of the work is not merely the content but the role of ink, brushes, and silk as well as paper. Bound in black cloth over beveled boards lettered and decorated in red and white, spine lettering white, tiny chips to cloth at spine ends, lettering with a bit of rubbing. Text in English incorporating some Chinese text. A very good copy."
