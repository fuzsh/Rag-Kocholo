        "text": "Cha Sheng (1650-1707) was born in Haining, Zhejiang Province. He is known by his sobriquets, Zhongwei and Hanzhong, and by his style name, Shengshan. He studied calligraphic styles prominent in the Jin dynasty (265-420) and was also greatly influenced by the calligraphers Mi Fu (1051-1107) and Dong Qichang (1555-1637). This quatrain with seven characters in each stanza, Laohuai (Old Yearnings), expresses Cha Sheng's feelings in his later years. It appears to have been composed after he retired as a government official and returned to his native home."
