        "text": "SU SHI 蘇軾 1037  1101 AD AS AN AMATEUR OF ART COLLECTING reating collections of painting and calligraphy was an activity already practiced in the Han 漢 dynasty period (206 BC-220 AD). Nevertheless , neither then nor during the next centuries preceding Ouyang Xiu's 歐陽脩 (1007-1072 AD) collecting pursuits was a of writing on art hadn't been developed on such a scale as it was the case in the second half of the 11th century. Although, Ouyang Xiu himself showed rather little interest in painting, his writings might have been a trigger for future generations of collectors who started making records about their art collections or writing critique papers an unprecedented scale. With the advent of a new generation we can observe not only an increasing number of texts but also new ways of perceiving art. \"Interest in calligraphy became part of hao gu 好古, loving antiquity\", 1) as Ronald Egan remarked. The same author also noticed that Ouyang Xiu was somewhat torn between aesthetic and didactical principals, whereas collectors from the new generation such as Mi Fu 米黻 (1051-1107 AD) and Wang Shen 王詵 (c. 1037-1093 AD) did not have such perplexities at all; on the contrary-they valued art for itself and focused on its meaning in their lives. 2) Increased interest in collecting paintings coincided with a general flowering of painting during the tenth and eleventh century, which in turn was connected with some historical situation. 3) After a period of political disunion the Five Dynasties (907-960 AD) and foundation of the Song 宋 dynasty (960-1279 1) Egan (1989: 384).\n\nThis article examines Song-to-Ming printed illustrations celebrating the power of the Diamond Sutra, one of the most widely copied Buddhist scriptures in East Asia. An integral part of printed copies of the Diamond Sutra, these illustrations reflect a strong popular taste appealing to common folks, connecting modern readers to a wider realm of vernacular Buddhism and popular Buddhist visual culture in traditional Chinese society, where indigenous beliefs, popular images, and various religious practices are freely borrowed, converged, and re-packaged. The first part of the study, “Buddhist Records of Magical Efficacy,” identifies the round-trip of protagonists to the underworld, and the efficacy of prolonging life in Tang-to-Northern Song miracle tales of the Diamond Sutra as two recurring features carried on in the Southern Song-Ming illustrated versions. The second part, “Illustrations of Miracle Tales,” examines illustrated miracle stories of the Diamond Sutra highlighting the underworld court, messengers from the underground, miraculous fungi, and magical writing. The third part, “Women in Vernacular Buddhist and Folklore Visual Cultures,” turns to good and evil stereotypes of women pictured in selected miracle tales. The author then also explores the half-animal, half-woman demons subjugated by Buddhist guardians, whose images are juxtaposed with the illustrated miracle stories in the Ming versions. Finally, the fourth part, “Publishers and Donors,” shifts to the social and religious context of the illustrated books of the Diamond Sutra. The extant Southern Song-Yuan woodcuts were likely printed by Hangzhou’s commercial publishers. A donor’s colophon and a hybrid Esoteric Buddhist pantheon in an early fifteenth-century version points to a multicultural community in early Ming Beijing. 《通俗佛教版畫所見的金剛經靈驗力》 【中文提要】 金剛經乃東亞文化圈中流傳最廣的佛經之一。本文旨在探討南宋至明初金剛經版畫所描繪的金剛經靈驗故事。這些插圖反映了吸引大眾的民間品味，使吾人一窺傳統中國社會中，在吸納了本土信仰、通俗圖像、以及多元宗教習俗後所融匯而成的通俗佛教及視覺文化。全文共分為四大部分。第一部分「佛教靈驗記」指出，往返冥府、續命延壽的故事主題，乃源自唐宋金剛經靈驗記書寫，並流傳到南宋至明木刻插圖版金剛經靈驗記的二大主題。第二部分「靈驗記插圖」，探討金剛經靈驗記版畫中的冥府、冥使來訪，以及與書經功德有關的芝草等靈驗表現。第三部分「通俗佛教及民俗視覺文化中的女性」，關注靈驗記版畫所見的女性善、惡面，以及明代金剛經版畫中，與靈驗記插圖併列的金剛圖像所添加的半人半獸女性鬼怪形象。第四部分「出版者與施主」，將重點轉移到金剛經木刻插圖出版的社會、宗教網絡。現存南宋、元版木刻版畫，可能都產自當時杭州的坊間印書店。一套帶有漢、梵合名之施主題記，以及混雜了密教與道教神群像的明初金剛經木刻版畫，則指向宣德年間北京城中的多元文化社群。\n\nGegu yaolun 格古要論 or The Essential Criteria of Antiques by Cao Zhao 曹昭 (pseudonym Cao Mingzhong 曹明仲) is one of the oldest compendia regarding works of art and antiques to be created in China. The author of this book, published in 1388, was an ardent collector and researcher. The translation of Cao Zhao’s text into English was first made in 1971 by Sir Percival David who, in addition to the basic content, also included facsimiles from 1388 and comments from later editions considered lost in the European circles. The whole appeared under the title: Chinese Connoisseurship. The Ko Ku Yao Lun. The Essential Criteria of Antiquities. Sir Percival, in the Introduction to his work, described the intricate history of his own studies on Gegu yaolun, indicating at the same time the dates of subsequent editions of the mysterious book and the authors of extensions and additions. The completion of the book is very important as it tells us about the authority of the original textbook, which is the starting point for further research on collecting in China. The original text written by Cao Zhao was first published in 1387 in Nanjing. It consisted of three juans (chapters), one of which was later quoted in Siku Quanshu 四庫全書 (1773–1782) – the Complete books of the Four Storehouses. The entire text considered thirteen subjects, such as: ancient bronze vessels, painting, calligraphy, rubbings of model inscriptions engraved on stone steles, ancient musical instruments, ink stones, unusual stones (zhuqi 珍奇, or jades, agates, pearls, rhino horn and ivory), metal objects, faience and porcelain, textiles, unusual wooden items and strange stones.\n\nThis book contains a photographic essay entitled 'Through the Half-opened Door' is composed of excerpts from my SOAS PhD thesis on 2nd-3rd century AD cave burials in Southwest China. The publication explores parallel paths of research in archaeology and contemporary art. The publication will be followed by an exhibit entitled 'Lithic Impressions: From Stone to Ink on Paper', an exhibition cum workshop to be held in Palazzo Zen (EMGdotART Foundation), Venice, from October to December 2018. Content: 1. Lithic Impressions 2.Through the Half-Opened Door 3. Medieval Epigraphy 4. Contemporary Practice Foreword: Lithic Impressions: From Stone to Ink on Paper is a collaboration between archaeologist Lia Wei and art historian Zhang Qiang. The project departed from the wish to explore the toolkit of the Chinese antiquarian, especially the technique of full scale replication by rubbing, and to apply its techniques to the stones of Venice. Lithic Impressions stems from earlier collaborative experiments in contemporary ink art and art historical research between Lia Wei and Zhang Qiang. Two major experiments in calligraphic abstraction, entitled ‘Biface Graphy’ and ‘Open Scroll’, were led between the years 2009-2018. In parallel to the gradual growth of this artistic collanboration, between the years 2009 and 2017, Lia Wei and Zhang Qiang have investigated as series of sites dated between the 2nd and the 6th centuries CE, a troubled and culturally fertile period in Chinese history located between the great Han and Tang Empires, often referred to as ‘medieval China’. Two type of sites were investigated: the Eastern Han period cliff tombs (2nd to 3rd century CE) in the canyon and plateau landscape of Sichuan province and the monumental epigraphy of the monk and epigrapher Seng’An Daoyi (562-580 CE) in the mountaineous hinterland of Shandong province. The itineraries covered by the duo’s investigations thus do the splits between the grey limestones of Northeast China and the red sandstone of the Southwest. The duo’s survey both revisited known funerary or epigraphic sites, which are mostly abandoned to decay, and discovered previously unrecorded sites. The technique of rubbing was used to replicate sculptural or architectural elements as well as calligraphic or pictorial traces. Seng’An Daoyi’s epigraphic production, rediscovered in 1996, exploits the natural shape of limestone cliffs in an unprecedented sculptural manner, which we can relate to no followers in the history of calligraphy. Eastern Han period rock-cut reliefs in sandstone reproduce wooden architectural shapes with virtuoso high and low relief effects, the soft and fine-grained rock surface also being a lively record of chisel marks. Both examples of stone working are challenging to replicate into rubbings, and stand on the frontier between two-dimensional and three-dimensional representation. By selecting cultural traces of times and areas of ideological, political, religious and artistic experimentation, Lia Wei and Zhang Qiang hoped to both cast a fresh eye on mainstream history and on the tools traditionally used to investigate and record the Past. Mapping frontier landscapes also meant exploring disciplinary boundaries, and producing an output that would remain in-between existing fields of practice and knowledge. The rubbing process of both Northern Qi and Eastern Han remains by Lia Wei and Zhang Qiang was recorded by photographer and film maker Marie-Françoise Plissart in collaboration with anthropologist and sinologist Françoise Lauwaert in the years 2010 and 2011. The rubbings themselves form a corpus still awaiting publication, for which this exhibition represents a foretaste. Apart from the photographic and video report of survey and the rubbings themselves, research resulted in two monographs: one is devoted to the figure of Seng’An Daoyi and the other one to the funerary landscape of the Upper Yangzi River course, on the Han imperial frontier. To cast a Chinese antiquarian eye on the history of stone carving in Venice, a workshop involving the production of rubbings from Venitian stone reliefs dating from Roman times to the 18th century will be held in the three days following the opening of the exhibit, and will lead to their subsequent display in China. Departing from the exhibit in Palazzo Zen, Venice, Lithic Impressions will travel to Belgium at the occasion of the Ink Art Week in Brussels (6-11th May 2019), where one day will be dedicated to rubbing and antiquarianism."
