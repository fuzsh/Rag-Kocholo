        "text": "Paintings by Mi Youren\n\nCloudy Mountains雲山圖: Yúnshān túArtistMi YourenYear1140sDimensions28.4 cm × 747.2 cm (11.2 in × 294.2 in)LocationMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York CityAccession1973.121.1\n\nCloudy Mountains (Chinese: 雲山圖) are a set of two paintings of the same name created by Chinese Song dynasty artist, Mi Youren (1072-1151), son of painter Mi Fu. [1][2]\n\nUtilizing a technique called \"ink play\" or \"Mi dots\" (Mi Dian), Mi Youren adapted the style of his father, which involved blots of wet ink blots, moist brushes, and horizontal strokes to lay out a blurry, yet simplified mountain landscape, which represented the rainy climate of Henan Province.[1][3][4]\n\nThe subsequent techniques of Chinese landscape paintings, would have substantial influence in the Ming dynasty, as well as Muromachi Period art in Japan, including artists like Sesshū.[3]\n\nOne painting is currently held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the other is held by the Cleveland Museum of Art, the latter being Cleveland's oldest dated Chinese painting.[1][2]\n\nCloudy Mountains雲山圖: Yúnshān túArtistMi YourenYear1130Dimensions45.5 cm × 646.8 cm (17.9 in × 254.6 in)LocationCleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, OhioAccession1933.220\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nMi Youren, whose grandmother was the wet nurse of Song Dynasty emperor Yingzong, was involved in the imperial administrations like his father Mi Fu, who took on the position of military governor in Wuwei as well as secretary for the Ministry of Rites.[4] He is likely either of Xianbei descent, through the Kumo Xi tribe and/or of Sogdian descent, as the surname Mi (米) is considered a Sogdian surname.[5][6]\n\nIn addition to being a scholar and an artist, Mi Youren authenticated ancient paintings under Emperor Huizong, and also served as a vice president for the Ministry of War.[1] He also has combat experience in the Jin–Song Wars.[2][7]\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum Painting\n\n[edit]\n\nThe MET specimen (1973.121.1) is representative of the divergence between the simplified Southern Song style that Mi Fu innovated versus Northern Song styles, which placed emphasis on detailed landscape.[1] Painted in the 1140s, while under the service of Emperor Gaozong, the \"cloudy mountain\" motif became his artistic interpretation of what good governance is. [8]\n\nSubsequent colophons annotating the painting, one piece written by Wang Jie (王介) in 1200 would describe how Mi Youren would produce the paintings for Gaozong, who would then gift it to his courtiers.[1][8]\n\nProvenance\n\n[edit]\n\nThe MET painting enjoyed extensive provenance history, as though the image itself only occupied 57 cm in length, subsequent mountings and annotations extended the scroll to 747.2 cm in length. [1] The painting was passed through the Qing dynasty emperors up til the end of the dynasty.

C. Wang, 1907‒2003)\n\nPurchased by the MET through the family of C.C. Wang in 1973 [1]\n\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art Painting\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Cleveland Painting is one of the Cleveland Museum of Art's oldest dated Chinese painting, acquired in 1933.[2] It depicts the misty riverscape of the Yangtze Delta. [2] As a result of the turmoil during the Jin-Song war, Mi Youren fled the scene where upon the encounter of the landscape, he painted this piece on September 11, 1130.[2][7] Written on the landscape was:\n\n好山無數接天涯，烟靄陰晴日夕佳。 要識先生會到此，故留筆戲在君家。 庚戍歲，辟地新昌作。元暉。 [seal] 元暉戲作\n\nFine hills are endless toward the edges of heaven. So are mist and cloud, rain and shine, days and nights. Had I known that you’d be visiting here. I would have left this playful work in your home. In the year of gengxu [1130], [I painted this] while seeking refuge in Xinchang. Yuanhui. [seal] “Yuan hui xi zuo” (Yuanhui playfully made this). [2]\n\nMi Youren and his family evacuated Runzhou (潤洲) as the Jurchens sieged Kaifeng, to Jintan (金壇,), and subsequently evacuated to the town of Xinchang (新昌村) as bandits and the Jurchens advanced through Jiangnan (江南).[7]\n\nProvenance\n\n[edit]\n\nAnyang Sun shi (安陽孫氏)\n\nBi Long (畢瀧)\n\nPrince Cheng (永瑆)\n\nZigu 子榖; mid-1600s\n\nWang To (1592-1652)\n\nChen Kuang (陳爌); jinshi 1646, colophon dated 1650\n\nXisan (錫三); 1800s\n\nYangxing Studio (養性齋珍藏書畫印)\n\nZhigai \"Li Zaixian 李在銛\" (芷陔審定真跡); early 1900s\n\nYujian Studio (玉簡齋)\n\nWu Changshuo 吳昌碩 (1844–1927)\n\nLuo Zhenyu 振玉 (1866–1940)\n\nNaito Torajiro 內藤虎次郎 (1866–1934)\n\nNagao Ko 長尾甲 (1864–1942)\n\nYamamoto Teijiro 山本悌二郞 (1870–1937)\n\nYamanaka & Co.
