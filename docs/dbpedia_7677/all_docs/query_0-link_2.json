        "text": "Home * People * Ed Felten\n\nEdward William Felten,\n\nan American computer scientist and professor of CS and public affairs at Princeton University. He has done a variety of computer security research, including work on proof-carrying authentication, on security related to the Java programming language, and the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) challenge [2] [3]. While affiliated with California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California during the 80s, Felten researched on parallel algorithms for nCUBE concurrent computers. Along with Steve Otto, Rod Morison, and Rob Fatland, Ed Felten is co-author of the massive parallel chess program Waycool, which played three ACM North American Computer Chess Championships, the ACM 1986, ACM 1987 and ACM 1988, as well the WCCC 1989 [4].\n\nSee also\n\nCartoons\n\nSelected Publications\n\n[5] [6]\n\n1985 ...\n\nEd Felten, Scott Karlin, Steve Otto (1985).
