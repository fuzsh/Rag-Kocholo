WILLIAM MILLER SCHOLARSHIP\n\nHave you ever had a teacher who inspired you to take chances, explore the ends of the earth, or maybe just explore who you are and what you can do? One such professor was William Miller, who came to Carthage in 1965. He was the founder and chairman of the Geography Department at Carthage.\n\nProf. Miller received the Carthage Outstanding Teacher Award in 1990, and was honored by the Association of American Geographers in 1995 for research accomplishments and excellence in the classroom. Prof. Miller was honored with the Carthage Flame in 1999, the highest honor conferred by the College. He died in 2000. Prof. Miller took great pride in his students’ accomplishments. He was equally proud of his wife, Marge, a retired Gateway Technical College teacher, and their children, and never missed an opportunity to say so. Three of his children are Carthage graduates: Rich Miller ’92, Anna Miller ’84, and Paul A. Miller ’87.\n\nOne of those Prof. Miller mentored was Kurt Piepenburg ’77. Mr. Piepenburg is the R. W. Miller Distinguished Professor in the Natural Sciences and professor of geography and earth science. For many years he served as vice president for academic affairs and dean of the College, and was a major participant in the establishment of the R. William Miller Scholarship.\n\n“Many people will remember Bill for the enthusiasm with which he monitored and promoted the progress of his former students,” former President F. Gregory Campbell said. “Bill will serve as a model for future Carthage professors.”\n\nTHE REV. DR. MELVIN AND LINDA MIRITZ SCHOLARSHIP\n\nThis scholarship was established in 2007 by the Rev. Melvin and Linda Miritz. Pastor Miritz serves as a visitation pastor at Lutheran Church of the Resurrection in Racine, Wisconsin. The couple wishes to support students planning careers as ordained ministers.\n\nDIANNE MIZERKA SOFTBALL ENDOWMENT\n\nDianne Mizerka began to lay the foundation of Carthage’s women’s athletic program when she began teaching at the College in 1966. Dianne was inducted into the Carthage Athletic Hall of Fame in 1985 because she had developed and nurtured a department that continues to produce promising young women athletes.\n\nSuccess followed Dianne’s teams throughout her coaching career. In the early years, as charter members of the Wisconsin Women’s Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WWIAC), Carthage competed against the large Wisconsin state universities and established a winning tradition that continues today in the CCIW.\n\nAfter years of success, Dianne left coaching to teach students and direct the women’s athletic program. Each year an award is presented to the outstanding scholar-athlete on the women’s softball team. This fund is used at the discretion of the head coach and director of athletics in support of the women’s softball program.\n\nDON L. MOLDENHAUER SCHOLARSHIP\n\nDon Moldenhauer graduated the University of Iowa in 1954 with a degree in film and theater production. Following a short term of service in the military as a cinematographer, Don became a director and producer of evening news programming at television stations in Iowa and Illinois. In 1956, he joined the public relations staff at Carthage while it was still located at the Carthage, Illinois campus. He served the College in this capacity for three decades. Don and his first wife, Joy Peters, had two daughters, Karen Howell ’83 and Laura Bigirindavyi. Joy passed away in 1999. In 2001, Don married the Honorable Judge Mary K. Wagner. Don passed away in 2012. Memorial gifts were all donated to this scholarship, which provides financial assistance to students from Kenosha County.\n\nMARTIN MONSON ENDOWMENT\n\nMartin Monson was a well-rounded individual with a robust interest in sports, religion, music, finance and education. From 1946 to 1948 and 1957 to 1975, he served Carthage in many roles including College dean, men’s dean, counselor on veteran affairs, Education Department chair, professor of education and psychology, and dean of special schools (the College’s night school and summer school programs). He also served on the committee that planned the College’s move from Carthage, Illinois, to its current home in Kenosha. He died in 1980. Mr. Monson’s gift is designated for cash awards to outstanding students in elementary and secondary education, as identified by faculty in the Division of Education.\n\nTHE THOMAS AND SARAH MONTEMURRO SCHOLARSHIP\n\nThis scholarship is awarded annually to a senior student who graduated from a Kenosha County high school and is majoring in business. Preference is given to persons of Italian descent. In 2012, Gina Madrigrano Friebus ’76, Thomas Madrigrano, and Katherine Madrigrano Comi ’81 established this scholarship in memory of their maternal grandparents, Thomas (1892-1959) and Sarah (1902-1990) Montemurro. The Montemurros immigrated to the United States at young ages. This loving and caring couple, who resided in Kenosha, raised five of their own children and also helped other family members raise their orphaned children. Mr. and Mrs. Montemurro were grandparents to 14 children, several of whom graduated from Carthage.\n\nERVA MOODY MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP\n\nEstablished in February 1959, this scholarship is given to students who plan to enter one or more of the following fields: teaching, parish work, missionary work, or the ordained ministry.
