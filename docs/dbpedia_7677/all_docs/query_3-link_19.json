        "text": "My name is Edward W. Felten. I am a tenured Associate Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University, and I am Director of Princetons Secure Internet Programming Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Washington in 1993, and my B.S. in Physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1985. I have been on the faculty at Princeton for about eight years.\n\nFor the 2001-2002 academic year, I am on sabbatical leave from Princeton, at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School. The Center focuses on interactions between technology and the law. I chose to spend my sabbatical year at the Center because of my increasing concern over the impact of new laws and court decisions on technologists. Cases like this one affect the environment in which legitimate computer security researchers and practitioners work. I myself have been restricted in my work by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, as I describe in ¶ 11 below.\n\nMy main area of research and teaching is computer security, and my other research interests include operating systems, computer networks, and Internet software. I have published more than fifty papers in the research literature, and am the co-author of two books.\n\nAt Princeton I have created and taught courses on Information Security, Applied Cryptography, and Distributed Computing and Networking.\n\nI have received a number of awards for my research, including a National Young Investigator award from the National Science Foundation, and an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship. I have received Outstanding Paper or Best Paper awards at two conferences: in 1997 at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, the most prestigious academic conference on operating systems, and in 1995 at SIGMETRICS, the most prestigious conference on computer system performance analysis. I have given numerous special and invited talks at academic conferences.\n\nI am the primary computer science expert witness for the U.S. Department of Justice in the ongoing antitrust case against Microsoft, United States v. Microsoft. In that capacity, I testified twice at trial and also filed a lengthy declaration in the remedy phase of that proceeding. I also advised the Justice Department extensively during the recently concluded settlement negotiations in that case.\n\nI have also worked extensively with law enforcement agencies. I assisted the U.S. Attorneys office and the FBI with the Melissa virus case and a few other matters.\n\nMy research has been funded by government agencies, including the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and by industrial grants or gifts from IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Merrill Lynch, Sun Microsystems, Telcordia, and Trintech.\n\nI have been appointed to advisory boards and study panels by industrial, professional, and governmental organizations. Sun Microsystems, Inc. appointed me to its Java Security Advisory Council, and I serve on Technical Advisory Boards for several other companies. The Institute for Defense Analyses , working in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Defense, chose me to serve in the Defense Science Study Group, and I obtained a U.S. Secret security clearance for that purpose. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is the main research arm of the Department of Defense, appointed me to its Information Science and Technology advisory board. The National Research Council (which consists of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine) appointed me to its study committee on Fundamentals of Computer Science. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which is the leading international professional society for computer scientists, appointed me to its Advisory Committee on Security and Privacy. I also serve as the moderator of the ACM Forum on Legal Regulation of Technology.\n\nMy research has been covered extensively in the national press. I have been quoted or profiled on numerous occasions in publications such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and Newsweek.\n\nI have been personally affected in my academic work by the uncertainty and restrictions generated by the application of new laws and court decisions to the field of computer science. Last year, I led a team of researchers who performed research on a set of proposed digital music copy protection schemes. On the eve of presenting and publishing our results on the significant flaws of these schemes at an academic conference, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and others threatened to sue us under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA). They demanded the right to censor our research paper and our lecture. The chilling effect of this litigation threat caused us to initially withhold publication of our results and cancel the lecture rather than risk violating the DCMA. Because of the importance of ensuring the freedom of researchers to publish the results of their research, we brought a federal court action for declaratory relief. The RIAA and the other defendants subsequently stated they would not sue us under the DCMA, and so we published a paper and gave a lecture on our research at another scientific conference last August. The RIAA and the other defendants still claim a right to censor our further writing and speech on the topic, so our declaratory relief action is still pending.\n\nI understand that Plaintiff chose to allow wide distribution of DVD player computer software programs, running on personal computers, implementing CSS and containing valid keys. This decision to authorize software DVD players and not to limit DVD players to only hardware versions made it virtually inevitable that knowledge of CSS and its keys would become public.\n\nPersonal computer software is inherently amenable to reverse engineering. The tools to do this reverse engineering are widely available at little or no cost and run on ordinary personal computers. There are, at the very least, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide who have the skill to use them.\n\nReverse engineering tools for personal computer software are so good, and so widely available, because they have other valuable uses, especially in debugging software. Programmers spend many hours debugging the software they have written (i.e., diagnosing its malfunctions in order to fix them). Debugging is essentially the process of reverse-engineering your own software, so that you can figure out how its behavior differs from the behavior you desire. Any skilled programmer is good at debugging; and debugging is just reverse engineering. Applying the same tools, and many of the same methods, to software implementations of CSS, would yield an understanding of how CSS works.\n\nAlthough some products exist that claim to harden software against reverse engineering, these products generally impair the performance of the hardened software, and have only a limited practical effect against a skilled reverse engineer. Indeed, a recent discovery in theoretical computer science proves that it is impossible to build a tool that effectively hardens arbitrary programs.\n\nBecause so many people have the skills and tools to reverse-engineer programs, Plaintiffs decision to authorize the release of CSS in software form made it virtually inevitable that somebody, somewhere, would reverse engineer it. It is hard to imagine that Plaintiff did not foresee this.\n\nOnce CSS became public knowledge, its keys inevitably also would have become public knowledge. This is true because the designers of CSS made the rookie mistake of using only a forty-bit key. It is common knowledge that use of a forty-bit key allows an easy brute-force search to determine the key, given a sample of encrypted material (e.g., a DVD movie disk). It is virtually impossible to imagine that Plaintiff did not realize this.\n\nIn fact, because the designers of CSS made the additional rookie mistake of using a home-grown cryptosystem rather than an industrial-strength one, it was not even necessary to search the entire 40-bit key space (i.e., the mathematical universe of all possible 40-bit numbers) to determine the working keys. Frank Stevenson was apparently the first to notice this, but the flaws in CSS were not terribly difficult to find. Finding the flaws in CSS would in fact make a good homework problem for a course in cryptography. It seems unlikely that Plaintiff could have done a due-diligence evaluation of CSS without learning of these additional flaws.\n\nThese facts demonstrate that Plaintiffs decision to allow personal computer software implementations of CSS made it virtually inevitable that CSS and its keys would become public knowledge. From my experience in the academic, commercial, government, and national security arenas of computer science, I know that this is not how businesses and individuals normally treat valuable information they desire to keep secret. In my view, the actions taken by Plaintiff cannot be considered reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of the CSS algorithm and keys."
