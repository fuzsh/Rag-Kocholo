        "text": "Alison Cook-Sather is the Mary Katharine Woodworth Professor of Education and Director of the Peace, Conflict and Social Justice Studies concentration at Bryn Mawr College, and Director of the Teaching and Learning Institute at Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges.\n\nAlison holds a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education, an M.A. from Stanford University, and a B.A. from the University of California at Santa Cruz. She works with a wide range of learners and teachers, including Bryn Mawr and Haverford students and alumni/ae interested in educational and social justice, high school teachers and students who participate in the preparation of future teachers, and college faculty and students interested in partnering to explore pedagogical practices.\n\nIn 2022, Alison was selected as a recipient of the Stanford University Graduate School of Education Alumni Excellence in Education Award, which recognizes outstanding work by alumni in innovation, leadership, the advancement of knowledge, and equity. Between 2011 and 2015, Alison was the Jean Rudduck Visiting Scholar at Homerton College, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England. In this role she ran the Cambridge Student Voice Seminars that brought together scholars, teachers, students, and policy makers from around the world. Since 2007, Alison has directed the Teaching and Learning Institute at Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges, which houses the Students as Learners and Teachers (SaLT) program.\n\nAlison’s research focuses on how differently positioned participants in education can work together toward more equitable and inclusive learning. She is an internationally recognized scholar on student voice work, particularly student voice in teacher education and professional development, and on pedagogical partnership in higher education. Alison has consulted on pedagogical partnership at over 80 institutions on six continents and published over 100 articles and book chapters and eight books, including Co-Creating Equitable Teaching and Learning: Structuring Student Voice into Higher Education, Promoting Equity and Justice through Pedagogical Partnership, and Engaging Students as Partners in Learning and Teaching: A Guide for Faculty.\n\nAlison regularly delivers keynotes and workshops.
