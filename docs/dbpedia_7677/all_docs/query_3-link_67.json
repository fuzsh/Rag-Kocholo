Original article at: http://www.webreview.com/97/03/21/feature/index.html Serena ****************************************************************************** by Jonathan Steinberg Professor Edward Felten. Princeton Computer Science building. Somewhere in the halls of one of America's most respectable universities, a group of graduate students appear to be doing something kind of sleazy. Professor Edward Felten of Princeton University and several of his graduate students are creating a false sense of security around a Web user, a false World Wide Web that will trick a user into thinking he or she is actually surfing the Web. At some site within this parallel universe, they will ask for confidential information, like a credit card number. And when the user submits it -- they'll snatch it up. It's called a spoofing attack, and it's the latest security hole in the Internet that Felten and his Secure Internet Programming (SIP) group in Princeton's computer science department have sought to expose, with the higher purpose of making executable content on the Web secure. When Felten and his team began pointing out security flaws in Java code and Web browsers last year, he feared that the companies who make these programs would hate him. Most of these flaws would allow a malicious hacker to gain access to files on a Web user's computer, to alter or delete them, or to send a virus -- and that wouldn't make the software vendor look good. But to Felten's surprise, the opposite has happened: the developers have embraced him and now help fund his venture. Web Spoofing SIP was born during a late-night discussion in November 1995 when grad students Dan Wallach and Drew Dean were talking about the potential security pitfalls that executables like Java pose to the Web. They brought the idea to Felten, and together they formed the Secure Internet Programming group, with the goal of finding and exposing these flaws. Felten and Professor Andrew Appel advise the team, which includes Wallach, Dean, and grad students Dirk Balfanz and George Chesakov.

To accomplish the spoofing, an attacker lures a user to a connection with his or her server. When the user clicks to move on to another page, the attacker's server actually fetches the page, changes all the links in it to keep the user on the attacker's server, and serves it to the user. The attacker can camouflage this with some Javascript that delivers the original URL of the fetched page to the user's browser's location bar. The user is an unwitting prisoner, and any sensitive data he or she sends -- even over a secure connection -- reaches the attacker's server. Needless to say Felten keeps Java and JavaScript turned off on his browser \"unless there's a fun game or something I wanna play.\" Every Web user is at some risk from malicious applets, but Felten more than most: What hacker wouldn't love to crash his machine? Corporate Connections SIP doesn't produce any new end-products. It finds problems and reports them to companies and the press. Its resources don't allow it to develop new software and compete with Sun and Microsoft. And while they release the results of their research, they don't go so far as to release the code that would make these security flaws easy to exploit (as a true cracker might). Felten describes his team's work as \"basic research,\" but it seems highly applied. One of its strengths has been its quick response to investigating new Internet applications, with no other mandate (like development) to get in the way of that mission. Much of the support for that mission comes from the companies who may have initially been embarrassed by its revelations, but who ultimately benefit from this inexpensive R&D. SIP's $200,000 annual budget includes contributions from Bellcore, JavaSoft (a division of Sun Microsystems), and Microsoft. (While Netscape doesn't fund SIP, founder and chairman Jim Clark made a pilgrimage to the group last fall.) While helping private corporations improve their software may raise a few academic eyebrows, Felten believes the group has an important voice in making the Web a safer place, with or without corporate support. Although he has considered starting a private company, he says he enjoys academic life, teaching, and interacting with the professors and students that surround him. He recently led a seminar that developed a secure, Web-based voting system for student government elections at Princeton, and serves as the coordinator for all the independent work of undergraduate juniors. Before the Internet, he was primarily interested in parallel computing, and he continues to research and teach in that field. What's Next? The team is just beginning to look at push media like Pointcast and Marimba, which Felten feels are quite similar to browsers. \"There's a mix of push and pull in all these things,\" he says, adding that a push server's ability to automatically update the receiver's application to send programs to a user's computer is worth serious investigation. The group's broad charter -- all mechanisms for transporting information over the Internet -- is also leading it to look at the most popular browser plug-ins. Despite all he's learned, Felten sees commerce as more or less safe on the Internet, and he has no qualms about using his credit card to buy airline tickets over the Net. \"There are all kinds of things your computer can do to cost you money,\" he explains, \"but having your credit card number intercepted during a transaction is not one of the more frightening ones.\""
