The first awardees of the program were in 2023, piloted by the Earth Prediction Innovation Center (EPIC). This fellowship will provide two years of funding (around $35,000/year) to Ph.D. candidates in support of innovative weather and climate research and engineering projects. The WINGS Fellowship will enable fellows to gain insights into their respective fields, support the fellows’ integration into the workforce, and offer a unique opportunity to contribute to forecast model development.\n\nJoseph Knisely (2023), Advisor(s): Poterjoy\n\nOther Graduate Awards\n\nRecipients"
