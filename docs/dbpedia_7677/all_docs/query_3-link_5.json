        "text": "Welcome!\n\nI'm a computer scientist and researcher interested in the governance of automated decision-making systems, especially those built with machine learning. I'm a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at UC Berkeley's School of Information, working with Deirdre Mulligan. I received a PhD in Computer Science in the Security Group at Princeton University, which is an important part of Computer Science history. My dissertation on Accountable Algorithms was advised by Edward W. Felten and supported by the Center for Information Technology Policy where I studied many topics in security, privacy, and how technology informs policy decisions. For a time, I was also advised by Andrew Appel and worked on memory safety and software security.\n\nThe following facts about me may or may not interest you: I received the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship in 2011. For many years, I traveled to Boston each fall to perform Improbable feats of engineering. I got married to my secret high-school crush in 2012.\n\nDeeper in the past, I attended a small college near Boston, MA where I spent a lot of time playing with technology and making it accessible to the masses. Prior to that, I grew up in Monterey, CA where I can recommend a good dentist. It was there that I got my start as a Computer Scientist, and experienced the inner workings of government.\n\nI do occasional consulting work on policy and practical issues in algorithmic accountability. If you'd like to know more, please contact me.\n\nI don't always blog, but when I do, you can find my ramblings linked from the publications page. You might also find me making birdcalls online from time to time. You can also find a more formal bio and headshot here.\n\nBio & Headshot\n\nJoshua A. Kroll is a computer scientist studying the relationship between governance, public policy, and computer systems. Currently, Joshua is a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley. His research focuses on how technology fits within a human-driven, normative context and how it satisfies goals driven by ideals such as fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics. He is most interested in the governance of automated decision-making systems, especially those using machine learning. His paper \"Accountable Algorithms\" in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review received the Future of Privacy Forum's Privacy Papers for Policymakers Award in 2017.\n\nJoshua's previous work spans accountable algorithms, cryptography, software security, formal methods, Bitcoin, and the technical aspects of cybersecurity policy. He also spent two years working on cryptography and internet security at the web performance and security company Cloudflare. Joshua holds a PhD in computer science from Princeton University, where he received the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship in 2011.\n\nHeadshots: small, large"
