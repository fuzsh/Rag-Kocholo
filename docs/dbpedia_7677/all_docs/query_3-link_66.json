Through the STEM scholars program in 2023, the demographics of the 200 scholarship recipients were as follows: 60% were from an underrepresented racial & ethnic group, 49% were female, 34% were first generation college students, 24% identified as LGBTQIA+, and 13% identified with a disability. This kind of investment in a future diverse workforce is exactly the kind of investment we need to get to the root of solving some of the world‚Äôs most complex challenges in the defense industry for years to come. Each year, the STEM Scholarship Program awards $10,000 to 200 recipients studying engineering or computer science at a 4-year college or university. Recipients may renew the scholarship up to three times for a total potential value of $40,000 per student.. #lockheedmartin #LM #STEM #scholarships #diversityinstem #diversityequityinclusion #diveraity #workforce #futurefutureleaders #racialequity #ethnicity #lgbtqia #lgbtq #women #disability #firstgen #engineering #engineeringeducation #companyculture #computerscience\n\nRAISING THE BAR: FORGING EXCELLENCE THROUGH INNOVATION & LEADERSHIP Fostering inclusion and diversity in our schools, in our communities and our workplace should be a top priority in our society, and Airbus as a proven leader in the global aerospace sector is committed to lead the way. Airbus is proud to be invited to be part of the Annual National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week Conference (#HBCU - Sept. 24-28, 2023 - Arlington, VA) to show our engagement towards innovation, and above all to shape and support equity in higher education and career paths. #HBCU was forged following the White House Initiative on advancing educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity through historically black colleges and universities. The core objective was to reduce and eliminate barriers which may have unfairly resulted in reduced participation and benefits from federal sponsored programs. This stand-alone conference gathering college and university executive leadership, faculty, students and supporters, will feature workshops, engagements, keynote speakers and interactive exhibits that will connect federal and industry/private sector resources to the HBCU community. Airbus will have recruiters on site to present and discuss our career opportunities and education development programs. And we will have the privilege to have Amanda R Simpson (VP Research & Technology and Head of Sustainability) as well as Michelle Hurdle (Director workforce and Economic Development) as panel speakers to highlight Airbus path and strong initiatives leading the way to clean aviation, as well as Airbus career pathways and economic mobility. Airbus is a strong advocate towards the future of aviation , and inclusive education programs and career opportunities, impacting positively our communities. #HBCUWeek #HBCU #Diversityandinclusion #educationequity #AirbusFlightPath9 #Teamairbus\n\n‚ÄúWe think visibility is a primary factor that contributes towards the underrepresentation of Black scientists across the biomedical sciences. Going back as far as in secondary school, we didn‚Äôt see people who represented us in these fields, sometimes even within our own families‚Ä¶ ...It‚Äôs exciting to make a difference and know that in generations to come, the impact that we've had in our communities will still stand. Even if it‚Äôs just one Black researcher that stays in the game, it could change a person's life. The impact that research has on healthcare and people's lives is exponential. By ensuring a diverse input, the output is going to help diverse communities. We have so much hope for this project and the future as it‚Äôs giving us the space to do what we want to do.‚Äù In our new blog, Dr. Bernadine Idowu-Onibokun PhD, PFHEA, MRSB and Tomi Akingbade, members of the Black in Biomedical Research Advisory Group (BBRAG), share how they‚Äôre helping to create visibility for Black biomedical researchers. The Black in Biomedical Research project aims to overcome the challenges of underrepresentation of researchers from Black heritage backgrounds across the biomedical sciences. Through the guidance and influence of the BBRAG, the project will support activities including outreach to Black students at both secondary school and university level, paid summer internships, networking, and early-career researcher support.

From carpentry to plumbing to masonry, their contributions have helped build our communities and shape the fabric of our society. üë∑‚ôÇÔ∏èHonoring Craftsmanship and Expertise: Black artisans and tradespeople have long been masters of their craft, honing their skills through dedication and hard work. Their expertise in fields such as carpentry, masonry, and welding has left an indelible mark on the built environment, with structures that stand as testaments to their talent and ingenuity. üèóÔ∏è Building Foundations for the Future: The legacy of Black individuals in skilled trades extends beyond their craftsmanship; it encompasses their role as mentors and role models for future generations. Through apprenticeship programs, like ICCS Academy and workforce training programs, like The HABITS Group LLC, they pass down their knowledge and instill a sense of pride and craftsmanship in the next wave of tradespeople. üåâ Bridging Communities and Cultures: Skilled trades have always been a bridge between communities and cultures, bringing people together to collaborate on projects that shape the world around us. Black individuals in skilled trades serve as ambassadors of unity, breaking down barriers and fostering connections through their work. üõ†Ô∏è Empowering Economys: Skilled trades offer pathways to economic empowerment and self-sufficiency, providing opportunities for individuals to build fulfilling careers and support their families. Black individuals in skilled trades are trailblazers in this regard, paving the way for others to follow in their footsteps and achieve success. üë∑‚ôÄÔ∏è Celebrating Diversity in the Trades: It‚Äôs important to celebrate the diversity of voices and experiences in the skilled trades. By honoring the contributions of Black individuals, we not only acknowledge their impact but also reaffirm our commitment to creating inclusive and equitable workplaces for all. üåüTogether, let's recognize and celebrate the intersection of Black history and skilled trades. Their contributions have built bridges, both literal and metaphorical, that connect communities and create a brighter future for all. üöÄüî® #BlackHistoryMonth #SkilledTrades #BuildingBridges #DiversityandInclusion #apprenticeshipsmatter #tradejobsmatter Zach Johnson Carl Burnside Elaina S.
