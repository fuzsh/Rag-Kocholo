        "text": "Establishment of the Department of Anatomy:\n\nMoved to Irvine with California College of Medicine in 1968\n\nThe Department of Anatomy has a long history dating back to its association with the California College of Medicine, while that college was based in Los Angeles. However, this historical narrative will begin at the time of the move of the College of Medicine to become affiliated with the recently established (1964) Irvine campus of the University of California.\n\nThe University of California, Irvine opened as a new campus in the fall of 1964, with strengths in Biological and Physical Sciences. The California legislature along with the UC Board of Regents intended that a School of Medicine would be an essential part of this new University Campus. The UC set to acquire the independent and fully functioning California College of Medicine (at that time located in Los Angeles) and move the College to the Irvine Campus.\n\nThe move to the Irvine campus began in 1967; the fall of 1968 welcomed the first class of entering medical students. The Program in Anatomy (at the time of the move, it was not yet a full department) included faculty members Lyle C. Dearden, Ph.D, Earle A Davis, Ph.D, and newly recruited Roland A Giolli, Ph.D. Marshall Johnson, Ph.D. served as department Chair from 1970 to 1973. Lyle Dearden was appointed to serve as Acting chair from 1974 to 1975.\n\nPrimary appointee:\n\nEarle Davis, PhD, University of Illinois\n\nTeaching of Gross Anatomy\n\nRetired, 1985\n\nLyle Dearden, PhD, University of Washington\n\nTeaching of Gross Anatomy\n\nRetired, 1985\n\nRoland Giolli, PhD, UC, Berkeley\n\nNeurobiology of accessory optic system\n\nRetired, 2008\n\nJohn E. Swett, Chair 1976-1982\n\nDepartment of Anatomy, for Systems Neurobiology\n\nIn 1975, the medical school administration made the important decision to bolster the basic sciences in the College. As a part of that plan, John E. Swett, Ph.D., a neuroscientist studying the somatosensory system, was recruited from the University of Colorado to serve as Chair. Dr. Swett was awarded 6 additional FTE’s to use for recruitment to develop the department in the field of Neurosciences. Dr. Swett was a serious individual who stressed both high quality academic research as well as excellence in teaching. The Department of Anatomy had quadruple teaching load (measured in number of contact hours with medical students) as any of the other basic science departments, and so teaching commitment was an important factor. Indeed, Dr. Swett set as a goal that all faculty members would be able to teach all of the departmental courses that were part of the medical curriculum (Gross Anatomy, Microscopic Anatomy, and Neuroanatomy) and would rotate through the courses, spending 3 years on each course. This philosophy, while making some pedagogical sense, was not supported enthusiastically by the recruited faculty, who realized that research productivity was considerably more important to the advancement of their careers than was breadth of teaching expertise.\n\nDr. Swett’s vision was to build a neuroscience department focused on the theme of systems neurobiology with an emphasis on sensory systems; his own work was on spinal mechanisms of somatic sensation. He began recruiting in his first year as Chair and in 1977 brought in 3 new faculty members at the Assistant Professor level, including Leonard M. Kitzes, PhD (auditory neurophysiology), Martine J. RoBards , PhD (somatosensory system) and Richard T. Robertson, PhD (development of thalamocortical systems). Activity continued in 1978 with recruitments of Robert H.I. Blanks, PhD (vestibular neurobiology), James H. Fallon, PhD (monoaminergic systems), and Charles E. Ribak, PhD (GABA mediated inhibitory systems in cerebral cortex). Also during this time, Dr. Swett named Herbert Killackey, PhD, Associate Professor of Psychobiology at UCI (studying development of somatosensory barrel fields) to hold a joint appointment in Anatomy. In 1981, Dr. Swett recruited Christine Gall, PhD, (plasticity of limbic system structures) to join the department as Assistant Professor.\n\nThe Anatomy faculty agreed that an essential aspect of a quality neuroscience department was the existence of a graduate (PhD) training program. A committee was formed, chaired by Dr. Robertson and including Drs. Dearden and Killackey, which prepared the proposal for a Ph.D. program. At this time, most of the graduate education in the College of Medicine was administered through the School of Biological Sciences, and so the proposal was for a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences, with specialization in Neuroanatomy. The first graduate student class of four students was admitted in 1981.\n\nDr. Swett stepped down from the Chair in 1982 to return to his laboratory, and Dr. Lyle Dearden again was called upon to serve as Acting Chair.\n\nPrimary appointee:\n\nJohn E Swett, Ph.D., UCLA\n\nSpinal cord circuits of somatosensory system.\n\nRetired, 1989\n\nRobert H.I.

That search was quite successful and in 1984 recruited Edward G. Jones (MD, University of Otago; PhD, Oxford University) from Washington University. “Ted” Jones was widely regarded as one of the leading neuroanatomists among the global neuroscience community, and his recruitment was viewed quite favorably by the campus and the College of Medicine. Among Dr. Jones’ goals for the department was to support the already strong research in systems neurobiology by encouraging growth in the emerging field of molecular neurobiology. That effort was reflected in Dr. Jones’ recruitment of Stewart H.C. Hendry, PhD (plasticity of visual cortex), Martin A. Smith, PhD (plasticity of peripheral cholinergic systems), Anne L. Calof , PhD (genetic regulation of neural development), and Ivan Soltesz, PhD (hippocampal plasticity and epilepsy). Dr Hendry later left UCI to take a faculty position at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Jones added to the expertise of the department by joint appointments of W. Ian Lipkin, MD, (neuroimmunology), John H. Weiss, MD, PhD (mechanisms of neural degeneration), and Frances M. Leslie , PhD (neuropharmacology).\n\nThe academic field of Anatomy, while respected, is not among the fields widely seen as on the leading edge of scientific advancement. Dr. Jones set about to modernize the department’s name to Anatomy & Neurobiology, to more accurately reflect the scientific expertise of the departmental faculty. At a campus widely known for its neuroscience expertise, and with the use of the term “neurobiology” in other venues, this proposed change in department name met with considerable resistance from other research groups on campus. However, with Dr. Jones’ typical perseverance, the change was eventually approved by campus administration and continues today.\n\nDr. Jones was a strong supporter of graduate education and, along with Vice Chair and Graduate Advisor Dr. Robertson, in 1986 established the tradition of “Grad Day” in which all graduate students have the opportunity to present their research topics to the larger department.\n\nDr. Jones stepped down from the position as Chair in 1993 and then relocated to lead the neuroscience program at UC Davis in 1998.\n\nDepartment Faculty, 1986\n\nFront row, from left: Len Kitzes, Chris Gall, Ted Jones (chair), Lyle Dearden.\n\nSecond row, from left: Herb Killackey, John Swett, Rick Robertson, Jim Fallon, Roland Giolli, Chuck Ribak (not pictured, Earle Davis)\n\nPrimary appointee:\n\nEdward G.

Dr. Robertson sought cooperative opportunities and joined in the recruitment of Oswald Steward, PhD to head the newly established Reeve-Irvine Center for Spinal Cord Injury Research. Dr. Steward was recruited from the University of Virginia, where he served as Chair of the Department of Neuroscience. Dr. Steward was widely recognized for his work in regulation of gene expression in the nervous system and on plasticity of hippocampal systems. His expertise in these two fields were seen as ideal for leading the effort to understand the pathology of spinal cord injury and the development of therapeutic measures. After his appointment as Center Director, Drs. Steward and Robertson collaborated on the recruitment of Hans Keirstead PhD (regeneration of axons following spinal cord injury) and Aileen Anderson PhD (role of immune system and glial cells in response to injury) to join the Reeve-Irvine Center and the Department of Anatomy & Neurobiology. Also at this time, Ji-ying Sze, PhD (who studied C. elegans as a model system for neuroplasticity) was recruited from Harvard Medical School. Dr. Sze later left UCI to take a position at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine.\n\nIn an effort to relieve some of the teaching load for the very demanding Human Gross Anatomy course, Dr. Robertson obtained funding from the SoM Dean’s office to recruit Dr. Robert Leonard to direct the Gross Anatomy course and devote his full efforts to the teaching mission.\n\nDr. Robertson added to the breadth of faculty expertise by the joint appointments of Mark Fisher, MD, (Professor and Chair of Neurology, and expert in cerebral vascular biology), Fan-Gang Zeng, PhD (Professor of Otolaryngology, studying cochlear implants), Tallie Z. Baram, MD, PhD (Professor of Pediatrics and of Neurology, studying the role of early stress on seizure activity), Steven Schreiber, MD, (Neurology; neurodegenerative diseases), and David Felten, MD, PhD (Director of the Samueli Center for Integrative Medicine; neuroimmunology). Dr. Felten soon left UCI to take an administrative position at Seton Hall University.\n\nPrimary appointee:\n\nDavid Felten MD,\n\nPhD, University of Pennsylvania\n\nNeuroimmunology; Director Susan Samueli Center\n\nRelocated to Seton Hall University 2002\n\nHans Keirstead PhD, U.

Dr. Kitzes was successful in recruiting David Lyon, PhD (visual system plasticity) from the Salk Institute to become Assistant Professor at UCI.\n\nPrimary appointee:\n\nDavid Lyon, PhD, Vanderbilt University\n\nPost Doc, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, The Salk Institue\n\nStructure and function of visual system\n\nIvan Soltesz, Chair 2007-2015\n\nA national search for a new department Chair was undertaken, and culminated in the appointment of Dr. Ivan Soltesz as Chair in 2007. Dr. Soltesz had established himself as an international leader in the field of hippocampal neurobiology of normal brain and how alterations in physiology and circuitry lead to production of seizures in the epileptic brain.\n\nAs part of the package provided to Dr. Soltesz for taking on the duties of department Chair, he was given the opportunity to recruit several new faculty members. The first of these was Xiangmin Xu, PhD (cortical plasticity) recruited from a postdoctoral position at the Salk Institute to become Assistant Professor. Later, Dr. Soltesz recruited Robert Hunt, PhD, (disorders of cortical development) from his postdoctoral position at UC San. Francisco, and Kei Igarashi, PhD (sensory neural mechanism in learning and memory) from his postdoctoral position with the Nobel Prize winning Mosers from Norway. Recognizing the unusually difficult challenge of teaching the field of Human Gross Anatomy, Dr. Soltesz devoted one faculty position to recruit Dr. Jamie Wikenheiser from UCLA to head UCI’s Gross Anatomy program. In addition, Dr. Soltesz was able to facilitate some local transfers of faculty into the department, including Danielle Piomelli, PhD (nationally recognized leader in cannabinoid research) and David Reinkensmeyer, PhD (use of robotics to facilitate recovery from stroke in humans). As part of the recruitment of a new Chair for the Department of Neurology, Dr. Soltesz welcomed Ana Solodkin, PhD (human brain fMRI imaging and plasticity) to the department.\n\nAlso, Dr. Soltesz made several joint appointments to the department, including Gary Lynch, PhD (Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry, cellular mechanisms of neural plasticity), Fred Ehlert, PhD (Pharmacology of muscarinic receptors), Brian Cummings, PhD (Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mechanisms of spinal cord injury recovery) and Lisa Flanagan, PhD (Neurology, bioengineering of stem cells and the role of extracellular matrix molecules on axonal growth after injury).\n\nDr. Soltesz stepped down from his position as Chair in 2015, when he was recruited to a named Professorship in Neurosurgery at Stanford University.\n\nPrimary appointees\n\nXiangmin Xu, PhD, Vanderbilt University\n\nPostdoc, The Salk Institute\n\nNeural circuitry in learning and memory disorders, mechanisms of epilepsy\n\nDanielle Piomelli, PhD, Columbia University\n\nPostDoc, Rockefeller University\n\nFunctions of endocannabinoid system\n\nDavid Reinkensmeyer, PhD, UC Berkeley\n\nRobotics and recovery from neurological injury\n\nJamie Wikenheiser, PhD, Case Western Reserve University\n\nDirector of Gross Anatomy curriculum\n\nRobert Hunt, PhD, University of Kentucky\n\nPost Doc, UC San Francisco\n\nDisorders of cortical development, mechanisms of epilepsy\n\nKei Igarashi, PhD, University of Tokyo\n\nPost doc, Norwegian University of Science and Technology\n\nSensory systems and mechanisms of memory\n\nJoint appointees\n\nAlan Goldin, MD, PhD, University of Michigan\n\nProfessor of Microbiology & Molecular Genetics\n\nAssociate Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, UCI SoM\n\nIon channels in epilepsy and other disorders\n\nBrian Cummings, PhD, UC Irvine\n\nMechanisms of spinal cord injury recovery; stem cell biology\n\nProfessor and Vice Chair for research, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\n\nGary Lynch, PhD, Princeton University\n\nDistinguished Professor of Psychiatry\n\nDisorders of learning and memory\n\nLisa Flanagan, PhD, University of California, San Diego\n\nAssociate Professor of Neurology\n\nNeural stem cells, Bioengineering\n\nChristine Gall, Chair 2015- present\n\nThe Dean’s office launched a national search to identify the next department chair, which resulted in the naming of Christine Gall as Chair of Anatomy & Neurobiology. With her extensive experience with the department and her meteoric rise through the academic ranks, Dr. Gall quickly commenced the search for new faculty. Working on behalf of the department along with collaborative efforts with the Gross Stem Cell Center and the EpiCenter, Dr. Gall has been successful in several recruiting efforts, including Lulu Chen PhD (molecular mechanisms of neural plasticity) from Stanford University, Momoko Watanabe (mechanisms of neural development in organoids) from UCLA, Javier Diaz Alonso (mechanisms of synaptic plasticity) from UC San Francisco, and Laura Ewell (Memory and Epilepsy) from the University of Bonn, Germany.\n\nPrimary appointees:\n\nLulu Chen, PhD, UC Irvine\n\nPostDoc Stanford University\n\nSynapse development and maintenance in neurological disease\n\nJavier Diaz Alonso, PhD, Universidad Complutense, Madrid\n\nPostDoc UC San Francisco\n\nMechanisms of synapse organization and plasticity in normal and pathological brain\n\nMomoko Watanabe, PhD, UC Irvine\n\nPostDoc Riken Institute, Japan, UC Los Angeles\n\nMechanisms of neural development studied in organoids\n\nLaura Ewell, PhD, University of Wisconsin, Madison\n\nPostDoc UC San Diego, Group Leader at Universitat Bonn\n\nMemory and epilepsy\n\nJoint appointee:\n\nAndre Obenaus, PhD, University of British Columbia\n\nCerebral vasculature in traumatic brain injury\n\nMagdalene Seiler, PhD, Max Planck-Institute for Psychiatry, Munich\n\nRetinal degeneration, stem cells, transplantation, trophic factors\n\nWritten and Copyright, Richard Robertson, Ph.D."
