Wallach is a Professor in the Departments of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering and a Rice Scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. His research considers a variety of topics in computer security, including electronic voting systems security, where he served as the director of an NSF-funded multi-institution research center, ACCURATE (A Center for Correct, Usable, Reliable, Auditable, and Transparent Elections), from 2005-2011. He has also served as a member of the Air Force Science Advisory Board (2011-2015) and the USENIX Association Board of Directors (2011-2013).\n\nWallach earned his M.A. (1995) and PhD (1999) from Princeton University, advised by Profs. Edward Felten and Andrew Appel. He earned his B.S. EE/CS from the University of California, at Berkeley (1993).\n\nInternet of Things Security: What, Why, and How [slides]\n\nSpeaker: Earlence Fernandes is a security researcher who is currently interested in the Internet of Things. He approaches IoT security from multiple perspectives including attacks, measurements, and system building. His recent work, a security analysis of the popular SmartThings platform, received the Distinguished Practical Paper Award at IEEE Security and Privacy in 2016 along with widespread press coverage. Earlence holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Michigan."
