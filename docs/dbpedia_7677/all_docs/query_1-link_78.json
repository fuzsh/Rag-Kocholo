        "text": "Dr. Bridget Arend\n\nBridget Arend, Ph.D., is the associate director of teaching and learning at Metropolitan State University of Denver with 25 years of experience teaching and supporting teaching and learning in higher education. She enjoys helping college faculty develop an intentional teaching practice so that they can feel calm and purposeful in this aspect of their work. She continues to teach courses in Education and Applied Communications at MSU Denver and the University of Denver. Bridget owns a professional development organization called Intentional College Teaching and is co-author of a comprehensive text about instructional practices, Facilitating Seven Ways of Learning: A Resource for More Purposeful, Effective and Enjoyable College Teaching. Bridget spent part of this past summer revising (and revising) a chapter titled, “What makes college assignments meaningful?” for an upcoming Routledge publication. She received her PhD in Higher Education and Adult Learning and continues to pursue research interests including teaching strategies in higher education, the role of reflection in learning, encouraging critical thinking in discussions, and alternative ways to evaluate teaching.\n\nKeynote: Five Strategies to Refocus on Intentional, Meaningful Teaching\n\nAs we take a breath after the last few years, many of us find ourselves busier than ever at a time when teaching and student learning are more visible and more complex. In this interactive plenary, we identify successful strategies that strongly resonate with faculty across disciplines to provide a sense of control and purpose in our work. From designing for long-term learning, centering values and care, addressing pedagogical challenges, proactively identifying limitations, and developing reflective practitioner habits, we share strategies and examples that lead to a calm, manageable, and intentional teaching practice.\n\nKeynote Workshop: The Role of Reflection in Learning: Lessons from the Literature\n\nInstructors in all disciplines use reflection to help students engage in deeper learning. The use of active learning, inquiry-based methods, and online and hybrid formats have created even more need to make the thinking process visible. Yet student reflection can be messy, subjective, and elicit student resistance. How do we best structure and scaffold reflection? What type of feedback is best and how often should we use reflection? And how can we possibly evaluate the reflective process? In this session, we will explore emerging literature about structuring, supporting, and assessing student reflection by exploring useful frameworks and discussing cautions and proposed best practices.\n\nDr. Bryan Dewsbury\n\nFTTC 2022 featured Bryan Dewsbury, PhD, as the dynamic keynote speaker from the Florida International University (FIU). Dr. Dewsbury is a Gardner Institute Fellow and the Principal Investigator for the SEAS (Science Education And Research) program. His research is focused on the social context of teaching and learning, including questions relating to identity constructs, bias, relationships, and the effects of those variables on learning in students (from K-PhD). Dr. Dewsbury has developed a number of teaching approaches and programs relating to social belonging and higher education and draws inspiration from the possibilities of education as a force for intellectual liberation.\n\nDr. Dewsbury was born and raised in Trinidad and Tobago. He pursued a Bachelor’s degree at Morehouse College and a Masters and PhD from FIU. At FIU, he explored a number of interesting questions in marine ecology and ecological economics and developed a number of teaching approaches and programs relating to social belonging and higher education. He is personally inspired by the possibilities ​of education as a force for intellectual liberation, and as a means to increase critical consumerism. In between, he tries to find time to keep up with his never-ending reading list, try new microbrews, and teach himself and his wife Kizomba!\n\nKeynote: Power, Practice, and Pedagogy - Classrooms as Spaces for Inclusion and Equity\n\nIn this talk, Dr. Dewsbury troubled the notion of what college teaching means, especially as it relates to the agency of its participants, teachers, and students. The case was made for learning environments as formative experiences for everyone to grow and learn. We discussed how this can be thought of and practiced in our classrooms, and what strategies will help you achieve more inclusive and equity-minded outcomes.\n\nDr. Saundra Y. McGuire\n\nDr. McGuire is the Director Emerita of the Center for Academic Success, Professor Emerita in the Department of Chemistry, and retired Assistant Vice Chancellor at Louisiana State University. She is an internationally recognized chemical educator, author and lecturer who has traveled the globe promoting sure-fire strategies to help students, including those underrepresented in science and math professions, to be successful in their coursework and careers. She has delivered keynote addresses or presented workshops at over 400 institutions in 47 states and twelve countries. Prior to joining LSU, she spent eleven years at Cornell University, where she received the coveted Clark Distinguished Teaching Award. Her best-selling books, Teach Students How to Learn and Teach Yourself How to Learn were published by Stylus Publishing.\n\nDr. McGuire’s most recent accolades include being listed in the 2020 edition of Marquis Who’s Who in America, the 2019 Distinguished Lecturer Award from the National Institute for Staff and Organizational Development (NISOD), the 2019 Commitment to Excellence in Academic Support Award from the Commission for Academic Support in Higher Education, the 2017 American Chemical Society Award for Encouraging Disadvantaged Students to Pursue Careers in the Chemical Sciences, and induction in 2017 into the LSU College of Science Hall of Distinction. She is an elected Fellow of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the Council of Learning Assistance and Developmental Education Associations (CLADEA). Additionally, she was awarded Lifetime Learning Center Leadership Certification by the National College Learning Center Association.\n\nDr. Bonni Stachowiak\n\nDr. Stachowiak is dean of teaching and learning and professor of business and management at Vanguard University of Southern California.\n\nAs the creator and host of the Teaching in Higher Ed podcast, she provides a space for discussing the art and science of facilitating learning. She also explores ways to improve our productivity, so we can be more present for our students and have more peace in our lives.\n\nThe podcast has welcomed such guests (including several past FTTC keynoters!) as James Lang, Stephen Brookfield, Cathy Davidson, Maha Bali, Saundra McGuire, Todd Zakrajsek, Clint Smith, José Bowen, Ken Bauer, Michelle M. Miller, Jesse Stommel, Kevin Gannon, Ainissa Ramirez, and Ken Bain. The Teaching in Higher Ed podcast was awarded a MERLOT Classics Award (2016) and has been profiled in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Inside Higher Ed, and EdSurge.\n\nHer Doctorate of Education in Organizational Leadership degree is from Pepperdine University. She also earned a Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership from Chapman University. Her Bachelor’s degree is in social sciences, which is also from Chapman University.\n\nBonni has conducted workshops and presented keynotes at various academic conferences on how to more effectively facilitate learning. She’s also shared ways to use educational technology to improve teaching and approaches for providing greater agency to our students in their learning.\n\nShe is married to Dave Stachowiak, host of the Coaching for Leaders podcast. They have two young children, work full-time jobs, are both computer geeks, and are living joyfully ever after together.\n\nDr. James M. Lang\n\nJames M.
