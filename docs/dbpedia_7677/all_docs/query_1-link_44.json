        "text": "The Department of Anatomy has a long history dating back to its association with the California College of Medicine, while that college was based in Los Angeles. However, this historical narrative will begin at the time of the move of the College of Medicine to become affiliated with the recently established University of California Irvine campus.\n\nUCI opened as a new campus in the fall of 1964, with strengths in biological and physical sciences. The California legislature, along with the UC Board of Regents, intended that a School of Medicine would be an essential part of this new university campus. UC set to acquire the independent and fully functioning California College of Medicine (at that time located in Los Angeles) and move the College to the Irvine Campus.\n\nThe move to the Irvine campus began in 1967. In fall 1968, UCI welcomed the first class of entering medical students. The program in anatomy (at the time of the move, it was not yet a full department) included faculty members Lyle C. Dearden, PhD, Earle A Davis, PhD, and newly recruited Roland A Giolli, PhD. Marshall Johnson, PhD, served as department chair from 1970 to 1973. Lyle Dearden was appointed to serve as acting chair from 1974 to 1975.\n\nPrimary appointee:\n\nEarle Davis, PhD, University of Illinois\n\nTeaching of Gross Anatomy\n\nRetired, 1985\n\nLyle Dearden, PhD, University of Washington\n\nTeaching of Gross Anatomy\n\nRetired, 1985\n\nRoland Giolli, PhD, UC, Berkeley\n\nNeurobiology of accessory optic system\n\nRetired, 2008\n\nIn 1975, the UCI medical school administration made the important decision to bolster the basic sciences in the college. As a part of that plan, John E. Swett, PhD, a neuroscientist studying the somatosensory system, was recruited from the University of Colorado to serve as chair. Swett was awarded six additional FTE’s to use for recruitment to develop the department in the field of Neurosciences. Swett was a serious individual who stressed both high quality academic research, as well as excellence in teaching. The Department of Anatomy had quadruple teaching load (measured in number of contact hours with medical students) as any of the other basic science departments, and so teaching commitment was an important factor. Swett set a goal that all faculty members would be able to teach all of the departmental courses that were part of the medical curriculum (Gross Anatomy, Microscopic Anatomy, and Neuroanatomy) and would rotate through the courses, spending three years on each course. This philosophy, while making some pedagogical sense, was not supported enthusiastically by the recruited faculty, who realized that research productivity was considerably more important to the advancement of their careers than was breadth of teaching expertise.\n\nSwett’s vision was to build a neuroscience department focused on the theme of systems neurobiology with an emphasis on sensory systems; his own work was on spinal mechanisms of somatic sensation. He began recruiting in his first year as chair, and in 1977, brought in three new faculty members at the assistant professor level, including Leonard M. Kitzes, PhD, (auditory neurophysiology), Martine J. RoBards, PhD, (somatosensory system) and Richard T. Robertson, PhD, (development of thalamocortical systems). Activity continued in 1978 with recruitments of Robert H.I. Blanks, PhD, (vestibular neurobiology), James H. Fallon, PhD, (monoaminergic systems) and Charles E. Ribak, PhD, (GABA mediated inhibitory systems in cerebral cortex). Also during this time, Swett named Herbert Killackey, PhD, associate professor of psychobiology at UCI (studying development of somatosensory barrel fields) to hold a joint appointment in anatomy. In 1981, Swett recruited Christine Gall, PhD, (plasticity of limbic system structures) to join the department as assistant professor.\n\nThe anatomy faculty agreed that an essential aspect of a quality neuroscience department was the existence of a doctorate training program. A committee was formed, chaired by Robertson and included faculty members Dearden and Killackey, which prepared the proposal for a PhD program. At this time, most of the graduate education in the College of Medicine was administered through the School of Biological Sciences, so the proposal was for a PhD in biological sciences, with specialization in neuroanatomy. The first graduate student class of four students was admitted in 1981.\n\nSwett stepped down from chair in 1982 to return to his laboratory, and Dearden again was called upon to serve as acting chair.\n\nPrimary appointee:\n\nJohn E Swett, PhD, UCLA\n\nSpinal cord circuits of somatosensory system.\n\nRetired, 1989\n\nRobert H.I.

That search was quite successful, leading to the recruitment of Edward G. Jones (MD, University of Otago; PhD, Oxford University) from Washington University in 1984. “Ted” Jones was widely regarded as one of the leading neuroanatomists among the global neuroscience community, and his recruitment was viewed quite favorably by the campus and the College of Medicine. Among Dr. Jones’s goals for the department was to support the already strong research in systems neurobiology by encouraging growth in the emerging field of molecular neurobiology. That effort was reflected in Dr. Jones’s recruitment of Stewart H.C. Hendry, PhD, (plasticity of visual cortex), Martin A. Smith, PhD, (plasticity of peripheral cholinergic systems), Anne L. Calof, PhD, (genetic regulation of neural development) and Ivan Soltesz, PhD, (hippocampal plasticity and epilepsy). Hendry later left UCI to take a faculty position at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Jones added to the department's faculty expertise with joint appointments of W. Ian Lipkin, MD, (neuroimmunology), John H. Weiss, MD, PhD, (mechanisms of neural degeneration) and Frances M. Leslie, PhD, (neuropharmacology).\n\nThe academic field of anatomy, while respected, is not among the fields widely seen as on the leading edge of scientific advancement. Dr. Jones set about to modernize the department’s name to Anatomy & Neurobiology, to more accurately reflect the scientific expertise of the department faculty. At a campus widely known for its neuroscience expertise, and with the use of the term “neurobiology” in other venues, this proposed change in department name met with considerable resistance from other research groups on campus. However, with Dr. Jones’s typical perseverance, the change was eventually approved by campus administration and continues today.\n\nDr. Jones was a strong supporter of graduate education and, along with Vice Chair and Graduate Advisor Robertson, they established the tradition of “Grad Day” in 1986 in which all graduate students have the opportunity to present their research topics to the larger department.\n\nDr. Jones stepped down from the position as chair in 1993 and then relocated to lead the neuroscience program at UC Davis in 1998.\n\nDepartment Faculty, 1986\n\nFront row, from left: Len Kitzes, Chris Gall, Ted Jones (chair), Lyle Dearden.\n\nSecond row, from left: Herb Killackey, John Swett, Rick Robertson, Jim Fallon, Roland Giolli, Chuck Ribak (not pictured, Earle Davis)\n\nPrimary appointee:\n\nEdward G.

Dr. Robertson sought cooperative opportunities and joined in the recruitment of Oswald Steward, PhD to head the newly established Reeve-Irvine Center for Spinal Cord Injury Research. Dr. Steward was recruited from the University of Virginia, where he served as Chair of the Department of Neuroscience. Dr. Steward was widely recognized for his work in regulation of gene expression in the nervous system and on plasticity of hippocampal systems. His expertise in these two fields were seen as ideal for leading the effort to understand the pathology of spinal cord injury and the development of therapeutic measures. After his appointment as Center Director, Drs. Steward and Robertson collaborated on the recruitment of Hans Keirstead PhD (regeneration of axons following spinal cord injury) and Aileen Anderson PhD (role of immune system and glial cells in response to injury) to join the Reeve-Irvine Center and the Department of Anatomy & Neurobiology. Also at this time, Ji-ying Sze, PhD (who studied C. elegans as a model system for neuroplasticity) was recruited from Harvard Medical School. Dr. Sze later left UCI to take a position at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine.\n\nIn an effort to relieve some of the teaching load for the very demanding Human Gross Anatomy course, Dr. Robertson obtained funding from the SoM Dean’s office to recruit Dr. Robert Leonard to direct the Gross Anatomy course and devote his full efforts to the teaching mission.\n\nDr. Robertson added to the breadth of faculty expertise by the joint appointments of Mark Fisher, MD, (Professor and Chair of Neurology, and expert in cerebral vascular biology), Fan-Gang Zeng, PhD (Professor of Otolaryngology, studying cochlear implants), Tallie Z. Baram, MD, PhD (Professor of Pediatrics and of Neurology, studying the role of early stress on seizure activity), Steven Schreiber, MD, (Neurology; neurodegenerative diseases), and David Felten, MD, PhD (Director of the Samueli Center for Integrative Medicine; neuroimmunology). Dr. Felten soon left UCI to take an administrative position at Seton Hall University.\n\nPrimary appointee:\n\nDavid Felten MD,\n\nPhD, University of Pennsylvania\n\nNeuroimmunology; Director Susan Samueli Center\n\nRelocated to Seton Hall University 2002\n\nHans Keirstead PhD, U.
