        "text": "2012 Women's Institute for Summer Enrichment\n\nPROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\nWISE is a one-week residential summer program at a TRUST campus that brings together graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and professors from all disciplines that are interested in Ubiquitous Secure Technology and the social, political, and economical ramifications that are associated with this technology. Thought leaders from academia, industry, and government come to WISE to teach power courses in several disciplines, including computer science, engineering, economics, law, and public policy. The one-week program includes rigorous classes and allows participants opportunities for career development and to network with their peers.\n\nThe 2012 WISE Institute was held June 19-22, 2012 on the University of California, Berkeley campus. A copy of the agenda can be found here.\n\nSPEAKERS 2012\n\nJean Camp\n\nIndiana University\n\nJean Camp is an Associate Professor at the School of Informatics, Adjunct Professor of Telecommunications, and an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at Indiana University. Professor Camp's core interest is technical trust mechanisms in economic and social context. It was this interest that led Prof. Camp from graduate electrical engineering research in North Carolina to the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon, and it remained her core interest as a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories. At Sandia National Laboratories her work focused on computer security. She left Sandia National Laboratories for eight years at Harvard's Kennedy School. Now as a tenured Professor at Indiana Unviersity's School of Informatics her research addresses security in society.\n\nEnabling System Trust for Users\n\nEdward Felten\n\nFederal Trade Commission\n\nEdward W.

He is on leave from Princeton University, where he is a Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs and the founding Director of Princeton's Center for Information Technology Policy. His research interests include computer security and privacy, especially relating to media and consumer products; and technology law and policy. He has published about eighty papers in the research literature, and two books. His research on topics such as web security, copyright and copy protection, and electronic voting has been covered extensively in the popular press. His weblog, at freedom-to-tinker.com, is widely read for its commentary on technology, law, and policy. He is a Fellow of the ACM, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has testified before the House and Senate committee hearings on privacy, electronic voting, and digital television. In 2004, Scientific American magazine named him to its list of fifty worldwide science and technology leaders.\n\nPrivacy and Integrity in the Untrusted Cloud\n\nJennifer King\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nJennifer King is a Ph.D candidate in Information Science at UC Berkeleyâs School of Information, where she is advised by Professor Deirdre Mulligan. Ms. Kingâs work uses human-computer interaction methods to examine the privacy âgapâ between peopleâs expectations and how technological systems actually function. Her publications include privacy focused investigations into mobile systems, online social networks, radio-frequency identification [RFID], and digital video surveillance. Ms. King holds a professional masterâs degree in information management and systems also from Berkeleyâs i-School. Prior to her research career, Ms. King worked in security and product management for several Internet companies, most recently Yahoo!.\n\nGregorij Kurillo\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nGregorij Kurillo received B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, in 2001 and 2006, respectively. He has received the highest national award for his undergraduate thesis work. He was a Research Assistant with the Laboratory of Robotics and Biomedical Engineering at the same institution from 2002 to 2006. His research work was focused on the application of principles of robotic grasping to human grasping for the assessment and rehabilitation of hand function in virtual environments.
