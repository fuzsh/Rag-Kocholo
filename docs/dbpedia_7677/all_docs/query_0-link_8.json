        "text": "Katherine Yelick\n\nRobert S. Pepper Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley\n\nThe Computing Research Association (CRA) selected Katherine Yelick as the recipient of the 2022 CRA Distinguished Service Award for her outstanding and sustained service contributions to the computing research community.\n\nYelick has earned the reputation of the “go-to” person for advice to the government and the agencies within it, and to institutions of higher education on all aspects of advanced computing. She is respected for her sound judgment, her broad knowledge of computing research, and her willingness to work hard and get things done.\n\nYelick’s affiliation with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), which complements her role as a tenured professor at University of California Berkeley, began with her appointment as a research scientist in 1996. She was appointed National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Division Director in 2008. In 2010, she became Associate Laboratory Director (ALD) for Computing Sciences, the first computer scientist to serve in that role. She stepped down from that position at the end of 2019 and now assists the LBNL Director as Senior Advisor for Computing.\n\nAt the national level, Yelick worked with senior managers across the Department of Energy (DOE) national lab complex to launch the Exascale Computing Initiative, the largest DOE project of its kind. She also provided congressional testimony on “Big Data Challenges and Advanced Computing Solutions,” for the U.S. House Science, Space, and Technology Committee in 2018. Additionally, she served on the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board from 2011 to 2017 and contributed to the National Research Council of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. She also served on CRA’s Computing Community Consortium Council from 2015-2018.\n\nYelick has led efforts toward diversity, equity, and inclusion – important attributes for the future of our field. At LBNL, she improved the gender balance at all levels – postdocs, student interns, and professional leadership roles. At Berkeley, she has been the equity officer for faculty recruiting since 2014 and has been effective in leading the EECS faculty to diversify the ladder faculty through selection and successful recruitment of new faculty members.\n\nJames Kurose\n\nDistinguished University Professor, University of Massachusetts-Amherst\n\nJames Kurose was selected to receive the 2021 Distinguished Service Award in recognition of his exemplary service to the computing research community. Through a career spanning more that 35 years, he has distinguished himself as national leader in numerous impactful service roles in the computing research community. In every setting, Kurose has brought his tireless energy, enthusiasm, and extraordinary collegiality to build community, and strengthen our field.\n\nHis visionary leadership as Assistant Director for Computer and Information Science and\n\nEngineering at NSF in launching new programs and initiatives across a broad spectrum of computing disciplines has benefited nearly every computing researcher in the United States. Kurose’s service as Assistant Director for Artificial Intelligence at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, co-Chair of the National Science and Technology Council NITRD National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, and for the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as well as other groups has advanced and elevated our field. As part of his AI leadership on behalf of the community, he led an all-of-government effort to conceptualize and launch the National AI Research Institutes, a centerpiece of the American AI Initiative. The huge success of the National AI Institutes program is directly attributable to Kurose’s insightful and persistent leadership.\n\nThe CARES Movement\n\nThe Committee to Aid Reporting on Discrimination and Harassment Policy Violations (CARES)\n\nThe CARES movement was selected for positively transforming the computing research community rapidly and fundamentally. CARES provides a resource for helping people experiencing issues related to discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The role of CARES is to “serve as a resource comprising well-known and respected people in the architecture community who are approachable and willing to listen and help people who experience discrimination and harassment” at SIGARCH and SIGMICRO events. CARES members agree to be a sounding board for these people and can provide advice on the steps necessary to have the matter further investigated by parent organization ACM. In addition to addressing this specific and pressing need, CARES has also served to mobilize and engage the entire computer architecture community, resulting in a more inclusive and supportive environment for all.\n\nThe first CARES committee was founded by the 2018 ACM SIGARCH Officers, led by Sarita Adve, in response to a longstanding and disturbing reality of gender bias and sexual harassment in the computer architecture community, which were brought to the forefront in blog posts by Natalie Enright-Jerger, Kim Hazelwood, and Kathryn S McKinley, and by a statement at MICRO by Margaret Martonosi.\n\nThe CARES movement has rapidly spread to other research areas where it is having a similarly transformative impact. In particular, many other ACM SIGs have or are setting up their own CARES committees modeled after SIGARCH CARES. CARES is also expanding beyond ACM – a CARES committee is being developed for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, the theory community, and IEEE leadership is interested in exploring this model for other societies.\n\nThe transformative work of CARES is not only aimed at calling attention to issues of sexual harassment and gender bias in the computing research field, but also in identifying and taking positive steps to make our research communities and conferences more welcoming.\n\nEdward Felten\n\nProfessor of Computer Science and Public Affairs at Princeton University\n\nEdward Felten has tirelessly worked at the intersection of computer science and policy, fighting to retain the “freedom to tinker,” amongst other things. “Freedom to Tinker” is also the name of his influential blog, which contains research and expert commentary on digital technologies in public life.\n\nFelten consulted for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and went on to become its first chief technologist during the Obama administration. He had a significant role in important FTC initiatives about privacy, net neutrality, and other policy issues relating to information technology. In 2015, Felten went on to serve as deputy United States chief technology officer in the Office of Science and Technology Policy. He was in charge of shaping the Obama administration’s AI policy, including chairing its “Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence” report.\n\nFelten currently serves as a member of the U.S. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which oversees executive branch policies and procedures related to protecting the nation from terrorism, in order to ensure the protection of privacy and civil liberties.\n\nFarnam Jahanian\n\nPresident, Carnegie Mellon University\n\nFarnam served as NSF Assistant Director for CISE from 2011 to 2014, the highest profile government position for computer science research. During his tenure he fought hard for computer science and launched three presidential initiatives: National Robotics Initiative, Big Data Research and Development Initiative and US Ignite. Farnam led twenty-five new solicitations, including several cross-directorate efforts such as secure and trustworthy cyberspace, cyberlearning and future learning technologies, and big data. He reintegrated the Office of Cyber Infrastructure (OCI) with CISE. Farnam served as co-chair of the NITRD subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council Committee on Technology, providing overall coordination for the R&D activities of 17 government agencies. He often testified before congress and gave about 100 presentations at universities and conferences.\n\nFormer NSF director and current CMU president Subra Suresh writes “Farnam is both a visionary and the pragmatist, and this combination of qualities has allowed him to be effective in whatever he undertakes.”\n\nTom Kalil, OSTP Deputy Director for Technology and Innovation states “During my more than thirteen years of service at the White House for two Presidents, I have had the opportunity to work with many individuals from the computer science research community who have been willing to serve in leadership positions at federal agencies such as NSF, DARPA, and the Department of Energy. Farnam has been second to none as measured by the breadth and depth of his impact on the direction of the field, and his ability to partner effectively with the research community, and his peers at NSF and other agencies, and the White House. His leadership and hard work has resulted in increased federal investment in critical areas such as Big Data, robotics, cyberphysical systems, cybersecurity, cyber-learning, next-generation networking, and CS education.”\n\nSusan L. Graham\n\nPehong Chen Distinguished Professor Emerita at UC Berkeley\n\nThe CRA Board of Directors has selected Susan L. Graham, Pehong Chen Distinguished Professor Emerita at UC Berkeley, for the Computing Research Association Distinguished Service Award 2012. Graham was selected in recognition of the extraordinary contributions that she has made over more than three decades of dedicated and selfless service and leadership.\n\nGraham has served on countless departmental review committees, editorial committees, award selection committees, advisory committees, program committees, and search committees for both the NSF Assistant Directorship for CISE and the Harvard Presidency. She served on the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC) from 1997-2003; on the Working Group of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to assess the Federal Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program in 2010; and has been Vice Chair of the Computing Community Consortium from 2006-present.\n\nAs a member of PITAC, in addition to providing important guidance on the “mainstream” work of the committee, Susan served as Co-Chair of the Subcommittee on Open Source Software for High-End Computing, and as Co-Chair of the Subcommittee on Learning and Education. These activities helped to establish the foundation for today’s view of computer science as an expansive discipline whose advancements are essential to all aspects of our lives.\n\nAs a member of a Working Group of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) to assess the Federal Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, Susan was instrumental in creating the outline of the report, assigning the sections, editing the member contributions into a coherent whole, writing the crucial Executive Summary, dealing with the politics of comments and revisions, and marketing the report in Washington. While many others made important contributions, the co-chair of the working group stated, “I can say with utter certainty that there would have been no PCAST report without Susan.”\n\nJeannette M. Wing\n\nPresident’s Professor of Computer Science and Head, Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University\n\nThe CRA Board of Directors has selected Jeannette Wing, President’s Professor of Computer Science and Head, Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, to receive the 2011 Distinguished Service Award.\n\nWing was nominated for the award for her national and international thought leadership with respect to Computational Thinking, and for her extraordinary performance as NSF Assistant Director for CISE from 2007‐2010. Articulating the notion of Computational Thinking has been influential in identifying how computing research is indeed far different from computing per se. That is, the way key problems in biology and other sciences, for example–are considered now is in terms of core computational notions such as abstraction, exponentials, and more.\n\nWing’s leadership at NSF came at a crucial time both scientifically and politically. She has been deeply involved in a set of major NSF programs including Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation, Expeditions in Computing, Trustworthy Computing, Data-Intensive computing, and more. These have helped push research in numerous new directions, and they have been essential in further establishing computing research as a cornerstone of NSF’s full research portfolio and as a critical dimension of America’s innovation economy. In the words of Peter Lee, Managing Director of Microsoft Research Redmond, “[Simply,] Jeannette’s service work has touched, in a tangible and positive way, virtually every working academic computer science researcher.”\n\nMoshe Y. Vardi\n\nKaren Ostrum George Professor in Computational Engineering and Director of the Ken Kennedy Institute for Information Technology at Rice University\n\nThe CRA Board of Directors has selected Moshe Y. Vardi, the Karen Ostrum George Professor in Computational Engineering and Director of the Ken Kennedy Institute for Information Technology at Rice University, to receive the 2010 Distinguished Service Award.\n\nMoshe was nominated for the award for two fundamental contributions to the computing research community. The first was leading the effort to produce a definitive report on offshoring that has contributed significantly to debunking myths about the future health of the computing field and, in the process, helped ensure a steady flow of the best and brightest students into computer science.\n\nThe ACM report, Globalization and Offshoring of Software, remains a core reference underpinning the arguments many of us continue to make that the study of computer science is a viable endeavor and one that leads to fulfilling and rewarding careers. Doing this study was not only a great service to the research community at the time, but – as it has turned out – something that is serving the community long beyond the time frame initially envisioned.\n\nMoshe’s second contribution was leading the effort to redefine Communications of the ACM with the Goal of engaging the computing research community to create a compelling magazine for computing. Today, eighteen months into the new CACM, the evidence is overwhelming that Moshe has been successful with the revitalization of CACM. Whether it is the hundreds of blog posts praising the new CACM – or the fact that cover stories like October’s “The Status of the P Versus NP Problem” are being picked up by the New York Times – Moshe has indeed created a Science for computing which serves the computing research community well. And as was pointed out in the nomination, “He [Moshe] has done this not because of any allegiance to ACM, but because of his deep commitment to serving our field.”\n\nRick Adrion\n\nProfessor of Computer Science at UMass Amherst, Co-Director of RIPPLES, Co-Director of the Commonwealth Information Technology Initiative (CITI), and Director of CRICCS.\n\nAdrion was recognized for his sustained record of effective and significant service contributions spanning more than two decades. He has played a key role in building, nurturing and shaping today’s computer science community. Among these contributions are leadership in the development of the Internet; leadership in setting strategic directions at the National Science Foundation; leadership in developing a stronger political voice for computer science in national politics; leadership in strengthening the software engineering community; leadership in strengthening, modernizing and invigorating computing and information technology programs in Massachusetts public higher education; and overall service to the computer science community. Rick Adrion was general chair of the first ACM/CRB Conference on Strategic Directions in Computing. He also played a leadership role in the formation of CRA and was an active board member for many years, serving on the Executive Committee and Government Affairs Committee.\n\nRick Adrion is Professor of Computer Science at UMass Amherst, Co-Director of RIPPLES, Co-Director of the Commonwealth Information Technology Initiative (CITI), and Director of CRICCS. He served as Division Director for Experimental and Integrated Activities in the NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) from January 2000 through August 2002 and as a part-time Senior Advisor in CISE until September 2003.\n\nPeter A. Freeman\n\nWashington Advisory Group, Washington, DC; previously Assistant Director of NSF for CISE\n\nPeter A. Freeman, recently named a director at the Washington Advisory Group in Washington, DC, was selected for his service as Assistant Director of NSF for CISE over the past four years. He assumed the CISE position in 2002, following 12 years as Dean of the College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology and a term as Chief Information Officer for the Institute.\n\nDuring his tenure at NSF, Freeman brought about dramatic changes in the directions and support of computing research. He reduced the number of CISE divisions and programs, and clustered the remaining programs to create more effective and flexible program management and, ultimately, better service to computing researchers. He also shepherded the move of the Shared CyberInfrastructure Division (SCI) out of CISE and into the Office of the Director.\n\nPeter Freeman was largely responsible for three additional major initiatives that will change the face of computing research over the next two decades. He introduced the Global Environment for Networking Innovations (GENI) initiative, which will redefine networking globally as we know it. The Computing Community Consortium (CCC) will bring together computing community leaders to determine research directions and infrastructure needs in a fashion that will allow the CISE community to compete effectively against other S&E disciplines for limited research and infrastructure funds. And the Broadening Participation (BPC) program (funded at unprecedented levels) will develop the diverse human capital necessary to sustain the U.S. computing research enterprise.\n\nJohn E. Hopcroft\n\nIBM Professor of Engineering and Applied Mathematics in Computer Science at Cornell University\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s he was involved in broadening SIAM’s scope to include computing. When the IEEE and ACM started conferences such as FOCS and SIGACT, Hopcroft served on the program committees, first as a member and then as chair. He was one of the founding editors, and later managing editor, of SIAM’s prestigious journal SICOMP. He subsequently served on the Board of Directors of SIAM (1989-97) and as chairman of the board (1992-93). At NSF, Hopcroft was active on various NSF advisory boards, including the National Science Board, where he chaired the Committee on Program and Plans that oversaw all major science funding, including computer science programs and the supercomputing centers. He was instrumental in this committee making the decision to privatize the Internet.\n\nHopcroft has served on many advisory boards, including NASA’s SSAAC which helped prioritize space research missions after the Challenger disaster. He has served professional organizations such as AAAS where he has served as chair of Section T on Information, Computing and Communications (1988-91) and as council delegate from 1998 to the present. He has served as editor for a number of leading journals; on advisory boards for academic departments such as Princeton, Yale, CMU, USC, and UC Berkeley; and on numerous review committees. Hopcroft helped the Vietnam Educational Foundation build computer science education in Vietnam, and currently is working with the Millennium Foundation, with support from the World Bank, to help build science infrastructure in Chile.\n\nMary Jane Irwin\n\nEvan Pugh Professor and Co-director of the Embedded and Mobile Computing Center (emc2) in the CSE Department at Penn State University\n\nMary Jane Irwin, Evan Pugh Professor and Co-director of the Embedded and Mobile Computing Center (emc2) in the CSE Department at Penn State University, has served at high levels with distinction in three of the main computing research professional organizations. She was a long-time and active member of the CRA board and vice-chair for four years; a member of council and vice president of ACM; and a member of council of the IEEE Computer Society.\n\nIrwin played a fundamental role in founding CRA-W, and has continued to be active in this leading organization for more than a decade. She has helped to set the future research agenda for the computer architecture community by co-chairing CRA’s grand challenge conference in this area. Her record of participation in professional publications and conference activities is unusually rich.\n\nDavid Patterson\n\nProfessor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley\n\nDavid Patterson, Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, has a wide range of service activities in addition to being a leading computing researcher. He served for four years as CRA’s board chair, during which he revitalized the membership of the board, greatly strengthened the financial abilities of the organization so it could better carry out work on behalf of the computing research community, and oversaw an expansion and strengthening of the programs, in particular in government affairs and representation of women.\n\nAs current president of ACM, Patterson has used his standing to speak out forcefully and effectively for improving the innovation climate in the United States through his efforts to return DARPA to a more basic research agenda, increasing federal funding for computing research and development, making the United States a more welcoming place to foreign students and researchers, and encouraging American students to pursue a computing research career.\n\nEdward Lazowska\n\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Information Science and Technology (ISAT), President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee, CRA’s Government Affairs Committee\n\nEd Lazowska is widely recognized for his incredible effectiveness, unbridled enthusiasm, and overwhelming energy. He has furthered the computing research agenda in so many ways that are simply transparent to the entire community. Only a few of his many contributions are mentioned here.\n\nLazowska is a Member of the NAE; and a Fellow of the ACM, IEEE, AAAS, and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. Currently he co-chairs the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee. From 1992-2004, he was a member of the CRA Board of Directors, serving as chair from 1997-2001; Ed is currently a co-chair of CRA’s Government Affairs Committee. He has long been involved with ACM activities, where he served as a member (and 1999-2000 chair) of ACM’s A.M. Turing Award selection committee and as a member of the ACM Council. From 1995-2000, Ed served on (and in 1998 and 1999 he chaired) the National Science Foundation’s Advisory Committee for Computer and Information Science and Engineering. He has testified before the U.S. House Appropriations Committee concerning NSF and the U.S. House Science Committee concerning HPCC.\n\nLazowska chairs the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Information Science and Technology (ISAT) study group and served as a member from 1998-2001; he also chairs the Peer Committee for Section 5 (Computer Science & Engineering) of the National Academy of Engineering. He is a member of the Executive Advisory Council of the National Center for Women and Information Technology, and also has served on a number of industry advisory boards.\n\nRecently Ed completed six years of service on the National Research Council’s Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB), and served on the NRC Committee on Improving Learning with Information Technology. In addition, Ed served on the NRC Committee on Science and Technology for Countering Terrorism—Panel on Information Technology, as well as contributing extensively to the creation of the CSTB summary report “Innovation in Information Technology.”\n\nIn the words of one supporter of his nomination: “Ed Lazowska is a most worthy recipient of the CRA Distinguished Service Award given his prodigious service to our community over multiple decades. He has served on more committees with national impact than almost any other computer professional I know, and continued to do so even while he was the highly proactive chairman of the University of Washington’s distinguished computer science department.”\n\nDavid Clark\n\nCSTB\n\nDavid Clark has deployed his technical expertise and scientific work in networking to serve the CS community in three arenas: 1) through Internet leadership and policy work, 2) through education, and 3) in service on the National Research Council’s Computer Science and Telecommunications Board.\n\nClark’s Internet leadership reaches back to the 1970s and includes: Head, Internet Configuration Control Board, subsequently the Internet Activities Board and Internet Architecture Board; leadership of the Internet Research Steering Group, including involvement with the Internet Engineering Task Force; one of framers of end-to-end arguments; and nurturance of nation-wide collaborations among network researchers, through SIGCOMM and less formally.\n\nClark’s service on CSTB, which dates back to 1987, has been extensive. He has chaired CSTB since 1996, helping to grow the Board’s program and impact. In addition, he: 1) chaired the project that produced the report, Computers at Risk; 2) served on all the Internet series committees, which together yielded four reports; and 3) was instrumental in developing the fundamentals of computer science and innovation in information technology projects.\n\nThough a research scientist, Clark has produced many Ph.D.s, and has been responsible for the cultivation and support of several, now well known, women in the field.\n\nThe nomination statement ends by saying, “Clark has received a variety of honors and awards for his technical accomplishments. That he has balanced an ongoing program of research, continuously contemplating new approaches to network architecture, with an expanding set of service activities attests to his versatility and his commitment to the field.”\n\nBarbara Simons\n\nACM US Public Policy Committee (USACM)\n\nBarbara Simons, over the past 20 years, has served not only the computer science community, but also the general public through her advocacy of the responsible use of technology by government and business interests, her efforts in developing and supporting programs to increase the participation of women and minorities in the computing profession, and her work on behalf of scientific freedom and human rights.\n\nSimons has served the ACM community extensively, including as President (1998-2000) and Secretary (1990-92), as well as Vice-Chair of SIGACT, Chair of ACM’s Scientific Freedom and Human Rights Committee, and Member of ACM’s Committee on Central and Eastern Europe. She established the ACM US Public Policy Committee (USACM) in 1993 and currently serves as Co-Chair.\n\nSimons has been a strong advocate for individual rights, especially in the areas of privacy and anonymity, and she has often testified before state and national legislatures and at government-sponsored hearings, bringing a computing expert’s perspective to important political decisions. Her nominators note that she “formulated and was often the first person to present to the community many of the issues surrounding computer security, privacy, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, encryption, E-Voting, and Total Information Awareness.”\n\nSimons’ work to increase diversity in computing includes: Co-founding the Reentry Program for Women and Minorities in the Computer Science Department at U.C. Berkeley; Membership on the Board of the Coalition to Diversify Computing, a joint CRA/ACM/IEEE-CS committee that works at increasing participation of underrepresented minorities in computer science; participation in the Richard Tapia Conference to Celebrate Diversity in Computing and the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.\n\nOne of her nominators notes, “What is most astounding about Barbara’s contributions is the fact that she did all of this work outside of her regular job. In some cases, the Distinguished Service Award has gone to individuals for whom service is part of their regular job. Barbara is truly an example of dedication to the computer science community.”\n\nRuzena Bajcsy\n\nDirector of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at the UC campuses of Berkeley, Davis, Merced, and Santa Cruz\n\nRuzena Bajcsy has been Director of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at the UC campuses of Berkeley, Davis, Merced, and Santa Cruz since November 2001.\n\nFrom December 1998 to September 2001, Dr. Bajcsy served as Assistant Director of NSF’s Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE). During her tenure at NSF, she was instrumental in helping to establish the Foundation’s Information Technology Research (ITR) program that funds innovative, high-impact research in information technology. As a result of ITR funding, CISE’s research budget grew by about 50 percent, the largest increase in the history of CISE. Dr. Bajcsy was very effective in making the case that the bulk of this money, especially in the first year, go to researchers in computer science and engineering.\n\nRuzena Bajcsy has a record of more than 30 years of contributions to the computing field as a scientist and administrator. She is a pioneering researcher in machine perception, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

Additional information is available on his website at:http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/avd/\n\nAnita Jones\n\nUniversity Professor at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia\n\nProfessor Jones is the first computer scientist (and the first woman) to ever hold that prestigious position. Professor Jones has always been concerned with the health of science and engineering research in the United States, and as DDR&E she has created a legacy of tremendous positive impact with respect to improving the national infrastructure necessary to perform that research.\n\nAnita Jones received a B.A. in Mathematics from Rice University, an M.A. in English Literature from the University of Texas, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1973. She was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie-Mellon until 1978, when she was promoted to Associate Professor. During 1981-87 she was co-founder and vice-president of Tartan Laboratories, a successful software company. Professor Jones has devoted a total of 15 years of combined service on the Air Force Science Advisory Board, and the Defense Science Board, the latter being the most senior of the external advisory bodies to the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nIn 1988 Professor Jones came to the University of Virginia as Professor and Chair of the Department of Computer Science. Her vision, leadership, and superb mentoring of junior faculty were instrumental in forging a top-notch computer science research program at Virginia. In 1994 Professor Jones was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, and in 1996 she was named IEEE Fellow. Anita Jones’ technical interests focus on the design and construction of programmed systems. She has designed protection mechanisms and built secure systems which afford guarantees about how information is used. She has designed and built multiple processor operating systems in order to experiment with both the underlying machine architectures and the top-level applications. She implemented realistic and substantial systems to test out design and implementation hypotheses so as to ensure both functionally and cost-effectiveness. She is author or co-author of 37 scientific papers and the editor of two books.\n\nDr. Paul Young\n\nProfessor of Computer Science at the University of Washington\n\nDr. Young served as assistant director of CISE. He has provided outstanding representation and leadership for the computing research community during a period of critical changes in our nation’s approach to research and education.\n\nAs chair of the CRA Board of Directors during CRA’s formative years (1989-91), Dr. Young helped the computing research field develop a presence in science and technology policy making. He was a member of CRA’s Board from 1983-91.\n\nDr. Young also serves as vice chair of the National Science and Technology Council’s Committee on Information and Communications, which is responsible for developing research programs and overseeing research in computing, information and communications across all federal agencies, including the congressionally mandated High-Performance Computing and Communications Program.\n\nPrior to his NSF appointment, Dr. Young was professor of computer science and engineering and associate dean of engineering at the University of Washington, where he had served as chair of the Department of Computer Science from 1983-88. He joined the University of Washington in 1983, after 17 years at Purdue University, where he was one of the first half dozen faculty members in one of the first computer science departments in the United States. Dr. Young graduated from Antioch College and received his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1963.\n\nDavid Gries\n\nTaulbee Survey, CRA\n\nIn 1985, Professor Gries was one of the key authors of the trends report, “Imbalance between growth and funding in academic computing science: two trends colliding,” a report that successfully predicted the upturn in computer science Ph.D. production and documented the special research funding problems a growing academic discipline was having in the face of limited research funding. This report marked a turning point in the computer science and engineering community’s understanding that it must give increased attention to national science policy issues.\n\nProfessor Gries is also known for his dedicated work since 1985 in making the Taulbee Survey a comprehensive and reliable annual survey of Ph.D. production, faculty salaries, and faculty hiring in Ph.D. granting departments in computer science and engineering. Under his management the Taulbee Survey had come to have essentially complete coverage of these departments in the US, making it both a valuable resource for dealing with the growth of computing research and an accurate historical record of that growth.\n\nFinally, Professor Gries deserves special mention for the inauguration of the CRA news journal, Computing Research News. He served as chair of CRA’s editorial board from the inception of the news journal until mid 1990. More than any other board member of the Computing Research Association, Gries saw the need for such a journal and gave unstintingly of his time and his direction to the development of CRNews."
