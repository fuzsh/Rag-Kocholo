        "text": "Developing undergraduate research and inquiry\n\nHealey, Mick, Jenkins, Alan\n\nIn undergraduate research, students learn and are assessed in ways that come as close as possible to the experience of academic staff carrying out their disciplinary research. This report argues that all undergraduate students in all higher education institutions should experience learning through, and about, research and inquiry.\n\nDisciplinary and Professional Identities are Developed Through Writing\n\nEstrem, Heidi\n\nEstrem identifies the ways that student identities are shaped by encounters with discipline-specific writing. While these encounters at first can threaten students’ sense of self, Estrem argues that students often grapple with new disciplinary identities through their writing as they advance through the university.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nDiscovery and Broad Relevance May Be Insignificant Components of Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) for Non-Biology Majors\n\nBallen, Cissy J., Thompson, Seth K., Blum, Jessamina E., Newstrom, Nicholas P., Cotner, Sehoya\n\nCourse-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) provide opportunities for undergraduates to participate in novel research. Based on data culled from surveying groups with varying levels of CURE component incorporation, this study shows that the “discovery” and “broad relevance” levels of a CURE have insignificant effects of student performance, self-efficacy, and sense of project ownership for non-majors in biology classes.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nDiversity in the Classroom\n\nUCLA’s Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion\n\nThis booklet summarizes empirical studies on the educational benefits of diversity and examines some of the challenges associated with diversity in the classroom. It also presents research on microaggressions in order to help faculty members meet the needs of diverse students responsibly and create a classroom environment where all students feel safe, valued, and respected.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nDo Biology Majors Really Differ from Non–STEM Majors?\n\nCotner, Sehoya, Thompson, Seth, Wright, Robin\n\nThe authors survey biology majors and non-STEM majors in introductory courses in order to discern whether there are significant differences between the two groups. Specifically, they analyze patterns within characteristic differences (gender, ethnicity, academic preparation, citizenship), feelings of “science identity,” level of scientific confidence, and perceptions of science and scientific methods.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\n“Do I Really Belong Here?”: The Stigma of Being a Community College Transfer Student at a Four-Year University\n\nShaw, Spink, K., & Chin-Newman, C.\n\nThis article presents the results of a qualitative study that explored the attitudes of 14 community college transfer students. The study shows that transfer students reported a sense of stigma for having attended a community college and how they have overcome these feelings. Recommendations are provided for how community colleges and four-year universities can help students combat these feelings.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nDoes explicit teaching of critical thinking improve critical thinking skills of English language learners in higher education? A critical review of causal evidence\n\nEl Soufi, Nada, Seeb, Beng Huat\n\nThis paper presents the results of a systematic review of studies to determine the effects of explicitly teaching critical thinking to students in an English language course in higher education. Additionally, the researchers identify the most effective approaches to instruction in critical thinking in the language classroom. Findings suggest that research in this field is still rather immature, and more large-scale, replicable robust studies are needed to advance the field.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nE\n\nEngaging Families to Foster Holistic Success of Low-income, Latinx First-Generation Students at a Hispanic-Serving Institution\n\nRebecca Covarrubias, Andrea Vazquez, René Moreno, Judith Estrada, Ibette Valle, and Kimberly Zunigas\n\nThrough surveys completed by conference participants, Covarrubias et al. explore servingness by evaluating an HSI initiative - the Regional Family Conference (RFC) - which is designed to engage families in the college transition and college-going process for low-income, Latinx first-generation students.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nEnglish Language Learners in Higher Education: An Exploratory Conversation\n\nHarrison, Jamie and Shi, Hong\n\nWhile international students and other English Language Learners (ELLs) have demonstrated a strong command of English upon university admittance, they still may face language-based issues when navigating higher education. University educators should be prepared to make pedagogical adjustments that support their ELL students.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nEnglish Learners in STEM Subjects TRANSFORMING CLASSROOMS, SCHOOLS, and LIVES\n\nFrancis, David and Stephens, Amy\n\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine was supported by the Nation Science Foundation (NSF) to examine and form a report on research concerning EL’s learning, teaching, and assessment in STEM subjects. In doing so, this report addresses the factors that affect ELs’ access and opportunity to rigorous, grade-appropriate STEM learning.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nExpectations of brilliance underlie gender distributions across academic disciplines\n\nLeslie, Sarah-Jane, Cimpian, Andrei, Meyer, Meredith, Freeland, Edward\n\nSurveys revealed that some fields are believed to require attributes such as brilliance and genius, whereas other fields are believed to require more empathy or hard work. In fields where people thought that raw talent was required, academic departments had lower percentages of women.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nExperimental Evidence of Professor Engagement on Student Outcomes\n\nCarrell, Scott E., Kurlaender, Michal, Bhatt, Monica P.\n\nStudents scored higher on exams, homework assignments, and final course grade, when they received “light-touch” feedback consisting of two personalized emails from the professor.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nF\n\nFact and Fiction in Cognitive Ability Testing for Admissions and Hiring Decisions\n\nKuncel, Nathan R., Hezlett, Sarah A.\n\nStandardized measures of intelligence, ability, or achievement are all measures of acquired knowledge and skill and have consistent relationships with multiple facets of success in life, including academic and job performance.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nFaculty Perspectives on Developing and Teaching Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences\n\nShortlidge, Erin E., Bangera, Gita, Brownell, Sara\n\nThis study presents the first qualitative investigation into the perspectives of a diverse group of faculty members who have developed and taught course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) stemming from their own research interests. The faculty participants reported a number of faculty benefits that can result from a CURE, identified a variety of challenges to implementing CUREs, and speculated about the attributes of a successful CURE instructor.\n\nFive Popular Study Strategies: Their Pitfalls and Optimal Implementations\n\nMiyatsu, Toshiya, Mcdaniel, Mark A., Nguyen, Khu\n\nA meta-analysis of five popular study strategies shows that students may benefit from training to use them most effectively.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nFrom HHMI: Doubling Down on Diversity\n\nAsai, David, Bauerle, Cynthia\n\nUsing their experience with initiatives at The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), the authors offer three suggestions to guide a concerted national strategy for “doubling down” on the persistence of minoritized students in science. They argue that by insisting that institutions take responsibility for creating inclusive campuses, leveraging successful models through adaptation and adoption, and aligning strategies across the STEM ecosystem, instructors can double the persistence of students from all backgrounds in STEM.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nFrom Instructional Goals to Grading Practices: The Case of Graduate Teaching Assistants\n\nMarshman, Emily, Maries, Alexandru, Henderson, Charles, Singh, Chandralekha, Yerushalmi, Edit\n\nWhen making grading decisions in a simulated setting, the majority of TAs’ grading considerations focused on correctness and did not encourage expert-like approaches.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nFostering a Sense of Belonging in the College Classroom: Peer Interactions that Improve Student Success\n\nKevin R. Binning, Nancy Kaufmann, Erica M. McGreevy, Omid Fotuhi, Susie Chen, Emily Marshman, Z. Yasemin Kalender, Lisa Limeri, Laura Betancur, & Chandralekha Singha\n\nPerformance gaps between genders and other minoritized groups may be closed with a 30-minute exercise that allows students to address their fears of “not belonging” and identify how they have or will overcome challenges in college.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nG\n\nGrading Practices and Considerations of Graduate Students at the Beginning of their Teaching Assignment\n\nYerushalmi, Edit, Marshman, Emily, Maries, Alexandru, Henderson, Charles, Singh, Chandralekha\n\nIn a study of 43 physics TAs, a majority noticed but did not grade on solution features which promote expert-like approaches to problem-solving.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nGreater Inclusion, Equity in STEM Education for Multilingual Students is Fous of New Research\n\nUT Austin News\n\nMultilingual students are the fastest-growing student group in U.S. schools. Yet, as the country continues to promote STEM literacy for all, multilingual students still face systemic barriers in accessing high-quality instruction to confidently enter the workforce. New research is emerging at the University of Texas at Austin to study what may ensure a successful start in STEM for multilingual students.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nH\n\nHow diverse are physics instructors’ attitudes and approaches to teaching undergraduate levelquantum mechanics?\n\nSiddiqui, Shabnam, Singh, Chandralekha\n\nUnlike other subjects such as electricity and magnetism, there is no widespread agreement on the essential topics to teach in the college undergraduate QM course for physics majors, the order in which those topics should be taught and the amount of time that should be spent on various topics.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nHow Experts Differ From Novices\n\nCommittee on Developments in the Science of Learning with additional material from the Committee on Learning Research and Educational Practice, National Research Council\n\nThe difference between what experts and novices do is not rooted in general abilities, intelligence, or memory. Instead, the difference is that experts have extensive knowledge that impacts how they organize, represent, and interpret information in their environment. Novices do not yet have these skills.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nHow Learning Works: 7 Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching\n\nAmbrose, Susan et al\n\nAmbrose et al. outline seven principles of effective learning: 1. Students’ prior knowledge can help or hinder learning. 2. How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know. 3. Students’ motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn. 4. To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned. 5. Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning. 6. Students’ current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning. 7. To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning (principles 4-6).\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nHow to Assess Your CURE: A Practical Guide for Instructors of Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences\n\nShortlidge, Erin E., Brownell, Sara\n\nTo assess course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), Shortlidge and Brownell recommend that instructors first identify their anticipated learning outcomes, then work to identify an assessment instrument that aligns to those learning outcomes and critically evaluate the results from their course assessment. To aid instructors in becoming aware of what instruments have been developed, the authors have also synthesized a table of “off-the-shelf” assessment instruments that instructors could use to assess their own CUREs.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nHow To Respond to Racial Microaggressions When They Occur\n\nWood, J. Luke, Harris III, Frank\n\nEducators have a moral duty to respond when a microaggression occurs; not interceding is allowing harm to occur.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nHow universities can enhance student mental wellbeing: the student perspective\n\nBaik, Chi, Larcombe, Wendy, Brooker, Abi\n\nBased on a study that collected 2,776 student responses to the question, “What can be done to improve student wellbeing?,” this article identifies and provides insights into seven categories of student recommendations: academic teachers and teaching practices; student services and support; environment, culture and communication; course design; program administration; assessment; and student society activities.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nI\n\nIdentifying and Disrupting Deficit Thinking\n\nPatton Davis, Lori and Museus, Samuel D.\n\nWhile there are various issues within education, the ways in which these problems are identified and named are just as important to the research process as the efforts to actually address them. Understanding the language of deficiency is crucial to bring to light how even critical scholars are not immune to reproducing ideologies of deficiency when it comes to minoritized students.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nImproving Academic Performance, Belonging, and Retention through Increasing Structure of an Introductory Biology Course\n\nWilton, Mike, Gonzalez-Niño, Eduaardo, McPartlan, Peter, Terner, Zach, Christoffersen, Rolf E., Rothman, Joel H.\n\nAround 50% of Biology students leave the major by the end of the second year at UCSB. This article assesses the impact of incorporating more course structure and active-learning techniques on student retention, sense of belonging, and academic performance. To do so, the authors designed an increased-structure intervention course and compared the outcomes to the normative Introductory Biology course. Enrollees in the intervention course performed better on assessments, had a significantly higher sense of student belonging, and were more likely to proceed to Introductory Biology II.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nImproving Underrepresented Minority Student Persistence in STEM\n\nEstrada, Mica, Burnett, Myra, Campbell, Andrew G., Campbell, Patricia B., Denetclaw, Wilfred F., Gutiérrez, Carlos G., Hurtado, Sylva, John, Gilbert H., Matsui, John, McGee, Richard, Okpodu, Camellia Moses, Robinson, T. Joan, Summers, Michael F., Werner-Washburne, Maggie, Zavala, MariaElena\n\nMembers of the Joint Working Group on Improving Underrepresented Minorities (URMs) Persistence in STEM suggest stronger focus on institutional barriers. They offer five recommendations that capitalize on known successes, recognize the need for accountability, and are framed to facilitate greater progress in the future. The impact of these recommendations rests upon enacting the first recommendation: to track successes and failures at the institutional level and collect data that help explain the existing trends.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nInclusive Teaching\n\nBryan Dewsbury and Cynthia J. Brame\n\nInclusive teaching is most effective when the academic experience is based on relationships and dialogue. The other components that stem from that dialogue point to the environment and activities created to sustain the dialogue, as well as the external resources leveraged to support it. Pedagogical practices that improve sense of belonging and self-efficacy help reinforce a classroom climate that is inclusive.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nInvestigating Instructor Talk in Novel Contexts: Widespread Use, Unexpected Categories, and an Emergent Sampling Strategy\n\nHarrison, Colin D., Tanner, Kimberly et al.\n\nInstructor Talk is present and abundant across a wide range of courses, instructors, and institutions. While ?90% of Instructor Talk samples could be characterized using the originally published Instructor Talk framework, new categories emerged, which drove the development of a Negatively Phrased Instructor Talk framework, complementary to the original framework, now referred to as “Positively Phrased” Instructor Talk.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nIt Matters Long Before: How Early Exposure to Faculty and Advisors at Baccalaureate Institutions Relates to Upward Transfer\n\nWang, Lee, S. Y., Nachman, B. R., & Zhu, X.\n\nLittle is known about whether community college students’ exposure to faculty and advisors at 4 year institutions early in their educational journey has positive long-term outcomes for transfer students. This study fills this gap through longitudinal survey data, showing that such exposure supports an upward transfer process.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nL\n\nLanguage learning and use in English-medium higher education\n\nWard, Lia-Blaj\n\nThis book uses ethnographic methods to understand the outcomes of English-Medium Instruction (EMI) through the lens of students. Through productive strategies used in EMI, English language learners develop their use of English outside of the university context.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nLanguage Matters: Considering Microaggressions in Science\n\nHarrison, Colin D., Tanner, Kimberly\n\nIdentifying and addressing microaggressions in the everyday language of our scientific environments may be key to making our disciplines, our classrooms, our laboratories, and our conferences all professional contexts in which everyone can succeed.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nLearning from Mistakes: The Effect of Students' Written Self-Diagnoses on Subsequent Problem Solving\n\nMason, Andrew, Yerushalmi, Edit, Cohen, Elisheva, Singh, Chandralekha\n\nThis study highlights that an important challenge for instructors is finding the right balance between limiting support to allow deep-level engagement and providing support to allow students to connect what they are learning with their prior knowledge. A self-diagnosis activity that makes students struggle appropriately and gets them primed to learn is most effective.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nListening to Makers: Exploring Engineering Students’ Recommendations for Creating a Better Makerspace Experience\n\nJennings, Madeleine, Coley, Brooke, Boklage, Audrey, Kellam, Nadia\n\nIn a study of university makerspaces, it was generally found that women and ethnic minorities tended to recommend social change in makerspaces, while men of all ethnicities tended to recommend equipment and technology changes. The implications of this study are to establish student makerspace recommendations to create more inclusive and welcoming environments in makerspaces and other engineering spaces.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nM\n\nMaking Biology Learning Relevant to Students: Integrating People, History, and Context into College Biology Teaching\n\nChamany, Katayoun, Allen, Deborah, Tanner, Kimberly\n\nStudents model their instructors' behaviors, and follow their lead. If we integrate social issues into the biology curriculum, we model social responsibility for biology majors, and we demonstrate the need for biological literacy for nonmajors.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nMaking Hidden Resources Visible in a Minority Serving College Context\n\nRamirez, Geraardo, Covarrubiaas, Rebecca, Jackson, Matthew, Son, Ji Y.\n\nThe authors argue that introductory courses and first year seminars should share the hidden “rules” for success in university systems. Such efforts are beneficial for students, particularly first-generation students.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nMaking the Implicit Explicit: Building a Case for Implicit Racial Attitudes to Inform Mathematics Education Research\n\nBattey, Dan, Leyva, Luis A.\n\nA potentially missing piece in understanding mechanisms that produce disparities in mathematics education is implicit racial attitudes. To make this theoretical case, Battery and Levya draw on work both inside and outside of mathematics education across four literatures: (1) the quality of mathematics instruction that African American students receive, (2) relationships developed with teachers, (3) racialized teacher perceptions of behavior and academic aptitude, and (4) racial microagressions in mathematics.\"\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nMentors play critical role in quality of college experience, new poll suggests\n\nLambert, Leo M., Husser, Jason, Felten, Peter\n\nCollege is full of new experiences and challenges, and one of the best ways to succeed in college is with a mentor. In the first year of college, students should begin to build a diverse network of faculty, staff and peers who will get them out of their comfort zone and challenge them.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nN\n\n(No) Harm in Asking: Class, Acquired Cultural Capital, and Academic Engagement at an Elite University\n\nJack, Anthony Abraham\n\nUsing data collected through interviews with Black and Latino undergraduates about their engagement with authority at an elite university, Jack identifies two types of low-income students: the privileged poor and the doubly disadvantaged. He shows that colleges are not just biased towards undergraduates from privileged backgrounds, but also toward undergraduates with college preparatory experiences. Therefore, institutions—and not solely the family—can equip students with the cultural competencies needed to succeed in college.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nNormalizing Black Girls’ Humanity in Mathematics Classrooms\n\nJoseph, Nicole M., Hailu, Meseret, Matthews, Jamaal Sharif\n\nBy conducting interviews with ten Black adolescent girls with varying engagement with mathematics, the authors argue that inclusive pedagogical approaches when teaching Black girls mathematics can humanize Black girls and their experiences in the mathematics classroom.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nNothing to Add: A Challenge to White Silence in Racial Discussion\n\nD'Angelo, Robin\n\nD’Angelo argues that “White silence” functions to maintain White power and privledge. She uses Whiteness theory as a framework to explicate the common rationales that White people use to justify their silence in discussions of race and racism. Afterwards, she challenges each rational using an antiracist educational framework.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nO\n\nOn the lookout for true grit\n\nPowell, Kendall\n\nThis short article describes the impacts of the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to PhD Bridge Program on assisting minoritized scholars’ pursuit and attainment of PhDs in the sciences.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nOn the Problem and Promise of Metaphor Use in Science and Science Communication\n\nTaylor, Cynthia, Dewsbury, Bryan\n\nPaper has three goals in assessing how metaphors used by scientists can inadvertently undermine goals of inclusive science.\n\n1) Examines the generative potential of metaphors to the advancement of scientific knowledge and science communication\n\n2) Highlights the ways in which outdated metaphors may limit scientific inquiry and contribute to public misunderstandings\n\n3) Critically analyzes the implications of cryptic social and political messages embedded in common metaphors in the life sciences.\n\n\"Only Connect . . .\" The Goals of a Liberal Education\n\nCronon, William\n\nA modern liberal arts education prepares people to see and make connections in their surroundings to make sense of the world.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nOrder Matters: Using the 5E Model to Align Teaching with How People Learn\n\nTanner, Kimberly\n\nThe order in which we decide to do things with students when we teach is critical, yet the order of things happening in a class session often goes undiscussed and unexamined.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nP\n\nPerceived Barriers, Anxieties, and Fears in Prospective College Students from Rural High Schools\n\nMorton, Terrell R., Ramirez, Nestor A., Meece, Judith L., Demetriou, Cynthia, Panter, Abigail T.\n\nUsing focus group interviews framed by Social Capital Theory, the authors examine the perspectives and experiences of high-achieving students who attended a rural high school. Collectively, the researchers find that the students’ rural communities communicate norms that further complicate college attainment because of the limited resources provided to their schools.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nPromoting Student Metacognition\n\nTanner, Kimberly\n\nThis article emphasizes the importance of metacognition in biology today and suggests classroom strategies for encouraging student understanding of metacognition.\n\nR\n\nRace Matters\n\nAsai, David\n\nDespite their initial high interest in science, students who belong to excluded racial and ethnic groups leave science at unacceptably high rates. ‘‘Fixing the student’’ approaches are not sufficient at stemming the loss. Asai offers three key suggestions for making science culture more inclusive.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nRecruiting underrepresented minority students\n\nDespite investments in recruiting minoritized students in aspects of higher education, many of the efforts aren’t successful. Upon giving explanations on why these efforts fall short, Felten asks that recruiters heavily reconsider their templates for what constitutes a promising undergraduate.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nReimagining How We Define Equity Gaps: Decentering Whiteness and Privilege\n\nBrown, Tia McNair\n\nEnacting equity in higher education will require the decentering of whiteness as the marker for success and aspiration for racially minoritized or marginalized groups.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nReframing Educational Outcomes: Moving Beyond Achievement Gaps\n\nShukla, Sarita, Theobald, Elli, Abraham Joel K., and Price, Rebecca\n\nThis paper reviews the \"negative and racialized history\" of the inter \"achievement gap.\" It examines how the idea of \"achievement gaps\" perpetuates deficit frameworks and outlines alternative frameworks and the ways that students, learning, and structures are conceptualized within them..\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nResearch Mentor Training: Initiatives of the University of Wisconsin Institute for Clinical and Translational Research Reimagining STEM Education\n\nImad, Mays\n\nImad argues that any educational philosophy that does not actively integrate, affirm, and promote creativity and freedom threatens to model and reinforce conformity, fragmentation, and overspecialization.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nResearch Mentor Training: Initiatives of the University of Wisconsin Institute for Clinical and Translational Research\n\nSorkness, Christine A., Pfund, Christine, Asquith, Pamela, Drezner, Marc K.\n\nThe most recent research mentor training initiative at UW, funded by a CTSA supplement, has been creation of a Web-based Legacy Resource for mentoring development, which has been established to serve national and international mentors and mentees by dissemination of resources, most notably research mentor training curricula ( https://mentoringresources.ictr.wisc.edu/).\n\nS\n\nSmall group gender ratios impact biology class performance and peer evaluations\n\nSullivan, Lauren L., Ballen, Cissy J., Cotner, Sehoya\n\nEvidence suggests the microclimate of the classroom is an important factor influencing female course grades and interest, which encourages retention of women in STEM fields. The study varies the gender ratios in small groups in two biology courses (from 0% female to 100%) and finds that as the percent of women increases so does the overall course performance for all students regardless of gender.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nStrategies for Group-Level Mentoring of Undergraduates: Creating a Laboratory Environment That Supports Publications and Funding\n\nOverman, Amy A.\n\nThis article describes several strategies for group-level mentoring of undergraduates to foster research productivity and simultaneously provide valuable high-impact educational experiences for students.

The study investigated how three active learning practices, clicker questions, group work, and cold call/random call, increase and decrease student’ anxiety. Students reported that clicker questions and group work had the potential to both increase and decrease their anxiety. Conversely, students reported that cold call and random call only increased their anxiety.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nThe Influence of Affirming Kindness and Community on Broadening Participation in STEM Career Pathways\n\nEstrada, Mica, Eroy-Reveles, Alegra, Matsui, John\n\nSocial science theory and research provide evidence that social contextual variables—specifically kindness cues affirming social inclusion— influence chronic underrepresentation of some groups within STEM career pathways. The current STEM academic context does not consistently provide cues that affirm social inclusion to all members of the academic population, and that policies that address this disparity are essential to broadening STEM workforce development in the United States.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nThe Lecture Machine: A Cultural Evolutionary Model of Pedagogy in Higher Education\n\nGrunspan, Daniel Z., Kline, Michelle Ann, Brownell, Sara\n\nStudy examines pedagogical behaviors through a cultural evolutionary model that stresses the global nature of the issue, the generational time that change requires, and complications introduced by academic career trajectories. Cultural evolutionary theory focuses on how cultural transmission processes and selection events at different career phases shape not only who teaches in higher education, but also how they choose to teach. Change in higher education requires reforming pedagogy in departments that produce PhD students with the greatest chance of obtaining tenure-track positions.\n\nThe New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness(Chapter 5)\n\nAlexander, Michelle\n\nThis chapter critiques the stereotype of the AWOL black father, or common refrain “where have all the black men gone?” because this type of stereotype or common refrain does not acknowledge a major cause, the mass incarceration of black men. Argues that mass incarceration of black men has been normalized through an entire system that allows it to occur and compares and contrasts mass incarceration to the Jim Crow era.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nThe Validity of the Graduate Record Examination for Master’s and Doctoral Programs: A Meta-Analytic Investigation\n\nKuncel, Nathan R., Serena Wee, Lauren Serafin, Hezlett, Sarah A.\n\nThis study is a meta-analysis of previous studies that examine whether or not the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) predicts the performance of students in master’s programs as well as the performance of doctoral students. Across nearly 100 studies and 10,000 students, this study found that GRE scores predict first year grade point average (GPA), graduate GPA, and faculty ratings well for both master’s and doctoral students, with differences that ranged from small to zero.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nTo learn inclusion skills, make it personal\n\nAsai, David\n\nAsai details his personal experiences with learning inclusion skills, arguing that diversity without inclusion is an empty gesture. Inclusion is a feeling of belonging, and creating an empowering, embracing, egalitarian environment starts with the heart.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nToward a Critical Race Perspective of Transfer: An Exploration of a Transfer Receptive Culture\n\nJain, Bernal, S., Lucero, I., Herrera, A., & Solorzano, D.\n\nThrough a Critical Race Theory framework, this study highlights five elements of a transfer receptive culture and its connection to the Summer Transfer Enrichment Program (STEP) administered by the Community College Outreach Center (CCOC) at Best Coast University (all pseudonyms).\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nTurning Good Intentions into Good Teaching: Five Common Principles for Culturally Responsive Pedagogy\n\nHailu, Meseret, Pan, Joy, Mackey, Janice, Arend, Bridget\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to focus on teaching practices that go beyond inclusive intentions, and instead focus on pedagogy that is truly responsive to diverse groups of students, especially in terms of the most prominent cultural aspects, such as race, gender, and nationality.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nU\n\n'Underrepresented Minority' Considered Harmful, Racist Language\n\nWilliams, Tiffani\n\nWilliams shares her frustration with the widely used term underrepresented minority (URM) and gives rationales and suggestions for moving away from such ‘racist language.'\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nUnderstanding engineering educators’ pedagogical transformations through the Hero’s Journey\n\nBoklage, Audrey, Coley, Brooke, Kellam, Nadia\n\nThere has been much research showing how successful student-centered teaching strategies are, but despite this, student-centered teaching practices have not been widely adopted. The authors identify three engineering faculty who have made the transition to student-centered teaching strategies and detail their stories about the transition.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nUnderstanding English Language Variation In U.S. Schools\n\nCharity Hudley, Anne, Mallinson, Christine\n\nCharity Hudley and Mallinson argue that successfully educating culturally and linguistically diverse students in U.S education will depend on teachers' having awareness of language variation. By knowing the principles and patterns of language variation in both speech and writing, teachers can allow their students to use and hone different dialects without ridicule while also gaining competence in “Standardized English.”\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nUnderstanding “Zoom fatigue”: Theorizing spatial dynamics as third skins in computer-mediated communication\n\nNadler, Robby\n\nThe implications of the authors arguments are twofold\n\nFor readers interested in the underlying causes of CMC exhaustion, this work presents a framework to test the ideas proposed and develop mitigating strategies.\n\nFor readers who study SOC’s, third skins might explain previously observed limitations in the effectiveness of visuality in CMC.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nUsing Expectancy Value Theory as a Framework to Reduce Student Resistance to Active Learning: A Proof of Concept\n\nCooper, Katelyn M., Ashley, Michael, Brownell, Sara\n\nThe authors seek to understand student resistance to transitioning to an active learning classroom by using the lens of expectancy value theory, a theory that suggests that students' perceptions of expectancy, value, and cost of active learning activities impact their resistance to active learning. The authors show that positive changes in the components of expectancy value theory lead to mitigating initial student resistance and raising levels of engagement in active learning classrooms\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nUsing Learning Strategies to Improve the Academic Performance of University Students on Academic Probation\n\nSarah Renzulli\n\nHalf of all students who begin college do not complete their degrees, causing a need to help failing students improve their study skills. Through mixed methods (e.g., qualitative and comparative case studies), this study outlines how a 3-week study strategies course improved the performance of students on academic probation.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nW\n\nWe Must Help First-Generation Students Master Academe’s ‘Hidden Curriculum’\n\nChatelain, Marcia\n\nMarcia Chatelain describes a 10-week course developed at Georgetown University that helps first generation students understand and navigate the “hidden curriculum” of higher education. The article also provides links to similar initiatives at other campuses.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nWhat Are We Seeking to Sustain Through Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy? A Loving Critique Forward\n\nParis, Django and Alim, Sami\n\nThe authors provide a “loving” critique of asset pedagogies which were developed to combat deficit arguments surrounding the cultures that minoritized students bring with them into the classroom. In doing so, they offer Culturally Sustaining Pedagogies (CSP) as a viable alternative to previous iterations of asset pedagogies as it offers a framework to understand students’ cultures as pluralistic rather essentialistic, as emergent rather static or traditional, and as eligible for critique.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\n“What if students revolt?”—Considering Student Resistance: Origins, Options, and Opportunities for Investigation\n\nSeidel, Shannon B., Tanner, Kimberly\n\nStudents often resist active learning approaches because these are unfamiliar. Understanding the expressions and origins of student resistance can help instructors address it effectively.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nWhat Is Deficit Thinking? An Analysis of Conceptualizations of Deficit Thinking and Implications for Scholarly Research\n\nPatton Davis, Lori and Museus, Samuel D.\n\nDavid and Museus identify and outline four interrelated characteristics of deficit thinking frameworks - blaming victims, being part of a larger system of oppression, being pervasive and implicit, and reinforcing hegemonic systems. By doing so, they encourage scholars to begin analyzing, critiquing, and applying anti-deficit framing constructively in educational contexts.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nWhat’s in a Name? The Importance of Students Perceiving That an Instructor Knows Their Names in a High-Enrollment Biology Classroom\n\nCooper, Katelyn M., Haney, Brian, Krieg, Anna, Brownell, Sara\n\nBased on student surveys and interviews from a college-level introductory biology course, this article describes how students can benefit academically from solely perceiving that their instructors know their names.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nWhose culture has capital? A critical race theory discussion of community cultural wealth, Race Ethnicity and Education\n\nYosso, J. Tara\n\nThis article challenges deficit-based understandings of the knowledge, practices, customs, or traditions that minoritized students bring with them to the classroom, and offers an alternative framework titled “community cultural wealth.” Yosso identifies various forms of capital that align with community cultural wealth and classifies them as aspirational, navigational, social, linguistic, familial and resistant capital.\n\nCITRAL Summary\n\nY\n\n“You Never Become Fully Independent”: Family Roles and Independence in First-Generation College Students\n\nCovarrubias, Rebecca, Valle, Ibette, Laiduc, Giselle, Azmitia, Margarita\n\nThis study explores the lived experiences of first generation (FG) students and provides insights into how universities should recognize their valuable strengths. The researchers analyze “soft independence” (i.e., gaining freedom, becoming self-expressive, pursuing their individual interests, and becoming mature) as well as “hard independence” (e.g., being resilient, being self-reliant, being tough, being mature, and breaking tradition) among university students. To better serve FG students, the researchers suggest a need to explore FG students’ beliefs and practices as they navigate familial responsibilities and the middle-class norms of the university.\n\nCITRAL Summary"
