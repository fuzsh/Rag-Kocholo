        "text": "Original article: \"From the White House to Web3: A look at the past of Arbitrum founder Ed Felten\" by Jaleel\n\nEditor: Jack\n\nOver the weekend, the Arbitrum community's proposal on the distribution of DAO treasury tokens caused a heated discussion. The team transferred the tokens to the wallets of the team and investment institutions before the community vote passed or even ended. Amid the waves of condemnation that \"DAO is dead in name only\", some people began to understand the story behind the Arbitrum team. (Related reading: \"Arbitrum Foundation's transparency is criticized, and it wants to \"steal\" $1 billion through AIP-1?\")\n\n「Lab experiment」\n\nEdward William Felten was born on March 25, 1963. Felten attended Caltech and received a degree in physics in 1985. From 1986 to 1989, he worked as a programmer at Caltech on a parallel supercomputer project. He then did graduate work in computer science at the University of Washington. He received his MS in 1991 and his PhD in 1993, with a thesis on developing an automated protocol for communication between parallel processors.\n\nIn 1993, he joined the Princeton University Computer Science Department as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor in 1999, and to professor in 2003. In 2005, he became director of Princeton's Center for Information and Technology Policy (CIPT). He has also served as a consultant to law firms, corporations, private foundations, and government agencies. In 2006, he joined the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, expanding his research to public relations. From 2006 to 2010, he was a member of the board of directors of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). In November 2010, he was appointed chief technology officer of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\nEd Felten's video speech as director of CIPT, source from the Internet\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Ed returned to his teaching position and began to study Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Ed's work on Bitcoin began with a paper he wrote on the dynamics and stability of Bitcoin mining mechanisms. At the time, everyone believed that the Bitcoin system was stable, and if everyone acted according to their own motivations, then the inevitable result was that everyone acted according to Bitcoin's rules. But Ed Felten proved that this was not the case, and there were an infinite number of stable results that were different from Bitcoin's written rules.\n\nSince then, he has launched several Bitcoin-related projects, such as building tools to track and diagnose the behavior of the peer-to-peer network that Bitcoin participants use to spread information about what is happening, studying the dynamics of mining pools, new types of double-spending attacks and how participants should defend against them, and designing a decentralized prediction market using the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nAt the same time, a new concept called \"Smart Contract\" also attracted Ed's attention. For him, who has been exposed to software and programming since childhood, the concept of smart contract reminded him of the booming Internet industry in the 1990s. \"Smart contracts will become a new software platform,\" Ed told himself and his colleagues, and since then, he has begun research on the future development of smart contracts. After seeing the potential congestion problem of the Bitcoin network, Ed decisively determined his research direction - scalability solutions. Remember, there was no Ethereum in the blockchain world at that time.\n\nIn 2014, IFP (Interactive Fraud Proof) technology provided a new possibility for the scalability of blockchain: a side chain or a second-layer chain (L2-Chain) can move all computing links off-chain while enjoying the security of the underlying chain, greatly improving the operating efficiency of the blockchain.\n\nDuring this school year, Ed stayed in his office all day, holding paper money and drawing various diagrams and threads about the IFP technology stack on the whiteboard. In the fall semester, one of Ed's professor colleagues opened a blockchain course, and the final assignment was: design a blockchain-based project in groups. Not long after, a group of 6 people found Ed and began to learn and discuss with him how to build a \"capacity expansion chain\" based on the underlying chain.\n\nIn early 2015, Arbitrum was first presented to the public as a final project in a classroom at Princeton University’s School of Computer Science. Three smart students stood stiffly in front of the whiteboard, introducing this “L2 expansion chain” with only a hypothetical underlying chain to the professor and classmates.\n\nArbitrum’s final presentation, sourced from the Internet\n\nLike most of the students present, Ed was very satisfied with this final assignment and planned to use Arbitrum as a starting point to carefully study the future of Roll-Up technology. But unexpectedly, just as he was about to start showing his skills, Ed suddenly received a call from the White House, inviting him to assist in technical security work.\n\nOn May 11, 2015, Ed Felten was appointed as the Deputy Chief Technology Officer of the United States in the White House, providing technical security for the Obama administration, which had only one year left in its term. The work during this period greatly changed Ed's view of the word \"pressure\". \"Although starting a Web3 business also requires responsibility for many people, it is simply not comparable to being an advisor to the president,\" Ed often said to his friends, \"Every decision made by the president affects the life and death of tens of millions of people.\" Due to the excessive work pressure and demands, Ed Felten had no time and energy to consider his academic career, and the development of the \"Arbitrum Project\" also stagnated.\n\nEd Felten, deputy chief technology officer at the White House, picture source from the Internet\n\nIn January 2018, Ed Felten returned to Princeton University to continue his research in computer technology. At a Computing Research Association summit that year to talk about the future of AI, Ed Felten seemed to have lost interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency. In response to the audience's questions about cryptocurrency, Ed said: \"I think cryptocurrency does provide a different way of payment, but in many transaction scenarios, the costs and challenges around payment are less than the issues around trust responsibility and risk.\"\n\nIn 2018, Ed Felten gave a speech on AI technology at the Computing Research Association Summit. The picture comes from the Internet.\n\nA few months later, two of Ed's doctoral students, Steven Goldfeder and Harry Kalodner, found him and invited him: \"Hey, remember that thing called Arbitrum? Let's make another one.\" \"Sure!\" Ed accepted the invitation of his students without hesitation.\n\nIn August 2018, Harry Kalodner published an academic work jointly completed by the three of them at the 27th USENIX Security, titled \"Arbitrum: Scalable, private smart contracts\". The main content of the paper was to solve the problem of scaling Ethereum without affecting security by creating Arbitrum. In the same year, the three co-founded Offchain Labs, and Arbitrum was officially launched.\n\nHarry Kalodner introduced Arbitrum at the 2018 USENIX Security Symposium. Image source: Arbitrum A brief history of Arbitrum\n\nWe all know that as Ethereum's Layer 2 expansion solution, Arbitrum has successfully overcome many of the initial challenges and has undergone a series of developments and developments since its launch in 2020. Before talking about the recently hotly debated \"DAO incident\" and the (AIP-1) proposal, let's briefly review Arbitrum's important development experience.\n\nIn February 2020, the first version of Arbitrum's testnet was launched, which only supported DAC-specific application chains and had no contract deployment. In October 2020, a new round of Arbitrum testnets and general contract deployments were launched.\n\nIn January 2021, OffchainLabs launched a batch of Demo products for the DeFi ecosystem on the Arbitrum testnet. In May of the same year, the company deployed the Arbitrum One testnet, with more than 250 teams applying for access. In September, Arbitrum launched its mainnet, Arbitrum One, and announced the completion of a $120 million Series B financing round.\n\nIn June 2022, Arbitrum launched the Odyssey project, which allows users to earn rewards by participating in the Odyssey NFT promotion or using the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Odyssey project, which was originally planned to run for 8 weeks, was suspended after the first week. The fundamental reason for the suspension was that the large number of new users caused network congestion, resulting in too high gas fees, which even exceeded the gas fee of the Ethereum mainnet. This also led them to launch the Nitro mainnet based on the WASM architecture.\n\nIn July 2022, Arbitrum announced the construction of a new chain \"Arbitrum Nova\", and then on September 1 announced the successful upgrade of Arbitrum One to the Nitro version, which increased network speed and reduced transaction costs. It is far ahead of Optimism in transaction volume and daily active users, with a market share of 52.5%.\n\nOn February 7, 2023, the Offchain Labs development team announced that it will launch the next-generation programming environment Stylus for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova this year. Stylus is an order of magnitude faster, can reduce fees, and is fully interoperable with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It is even called an upgraded version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine \"EVM+\".\n\nSince its launch, Arbitrum has gone through a series of developments, including deploying a test network, launching the Odyssey project, and releasing Nitro. The recent Nitro upgrade and the upcoming Stylus programming environment demonstrate the platform's commitment to providing fast, efficient, and low-cost solutions for Ethereum users. Even on March 23, Arbitrum's daily transaction volume hit an all-time high of 1.3 million, compared to 1.08 million transactions on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nIt can be said that before this, Arbitrum's operations were very successful and the community loved Arbitrum very much. However, just a few days after the ARB Token airdrop, Arbitrum experienced a \"DAO incident\" storm. The cause of the incident can be traced back to the (AIP-1) proposal.\n\nAIP-1 \"rollover case\"\n\nOn March 28, the Arbitrum community launched a vote on the Arbitrum Improvement Proposal 1 (AIP-1) on Snapshot. The proposal is to introduce a decentralized autonomous organization structure, ArbitrumDAO, managed by ARB holders. The Arbitrum Foundation will also serve and be managed by the ArbitrumDAO community.\n\nHowever, the voting has not yet ended, and the AIP-1 proposal has not yet been passed. However, Patrick McCorry's blog post revealed that the Arbitrum Foundation had already created a multi-signature wallet with an address called \"Arbitrum DAO Treasury2\" in advance, received nearly 700 million ARB tokens, and had already sold ARB tokens in advance in exchange for stablecoins, which immediately caused heated discussions in the community and caused dissatisfaction among holders.\n\nThe community and some partners are extremely disappointed with the Arbitrum team and the so-called governance, believing that AIP-1 is not a real vote, but a direct throw of the DAO principles out the window. What is the point of such a vote when the proposal has been implemented without the community's consent?\n\nUnder pressure, on April 3, Arbitrum officials responded to the matter on social media several times. Arbitrum's decentralized governance is proceeding as planned, but many decisions must be made before the DAO is officially launched. The goal of the AIP-1 proposal is to involve the community in initial decision-making and ultimately allow token holders to approve initial decisions and frameworks through DAO voting. On an important point of contention, Arbitrum denied that the fund did not sell 50 million ARBs before the AIP-1 proposal was voted through. 40 million ARBs have been distributed as loans to mature participants in the financial market sector, and the remaining 10 million ARBs have been converted into fiat currency to pay for operating costs.\n\nWith the public opposition from Blockworks Research and TreasureDAO, the largest governance representative of the Arbitrum ecosystem, the impact of the \"DAO incident\" has escalated again.\n\nBlockworks Research publicly stated that it voted against the proposal and denounced AIP-1 as a regression in the current state of community governance. Subsequently, TreasureDAO also stated that it had voted against the AIP-1 proposal put forward by the Arbitrum Foundation and asked Arbitrum to resubmit a proposal that would more clearly state the scope of the special grant program and split the AIP-1 proposal. In response, Arbitrum promised to address the feedback received from the community and revise each part of the proposal this week.\n\nAs of 11:15 on April 3, when this article was written, according to the latest voting data from Snapshot, the Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP-1), a comprehensive governance package initiated by the Arbitrum Foundation, has reversed from an initial 81.7% approval rate to the current 82.58% opposition rate.\n\nThe vote for the AIP-1 proposal will end at 6:13 am Beijing time on April 4. Under such great public pressure, the possibility of the AIP-1 proposal passing is extremely small. So how will Arbitrum end up? Everyone in the community wants to know, and BlockBeats will continue to pay attention."
