        "text": "The Rev. Joshua Daniel, PhD\n\nSenior Associate Rector\n\nJoshua has failed at many things in life. For all but one year of his baseball career (which ended in Little League) he was an abysmal right-handed batter. In middle school he strove, but failed, to make honor-roll. He was a stalwart of the bench in junior high basketball, getting only one chance to prove his mettle: his coach subbed-him-in when the game was on the line and tied against his school’s archrival, the Elmwood Raiders; within moments he managed to make a quick steal with an open court and easy layup ahead of him, but instead he dribbled the ball off his foot and out-of-bounds. He “rode the bench” until he finally quit his sophomore year. Later in high school he reached above his station and signed up for honors English; however he was soon asked (“strongly requested”) to drop out by one of the most admired teachers in his school. In his early twenties he was fired from a part-time job at a fancy Italian restaurant in St. Louis, MO (mostly he thinks for not understanding the je ne sais quoi of French Red Wine). In college he graduated a semester late due to misunderstanding the rather complicated sequence of his college’s foreign language credit system. Soon thereafter he stumbled into graduate school, unwittingly entering a 12 year doom-loop of full-time studies, which he finally escaped at the age of 35. His first calling as a priest in Arkansas ended in total disaster. His three beautiful children do not agree on much but managed to find rare consensus on his “cringe” rating: an impressive 97%. In the late 2000s, his wife once compared him to Johnny Depp, circa Depp’s Edward Scissorhands days.\n\nBy the grace of God Joshua has come to work at St. Columba’s, a spirit-filled place that strives to honor every single person as beloved children of God, warts and all. Joshua delights in the never ending river of forgiveness and mercy he continually receives from Jesus; and he draws on a tantalizingly similar affection and courage from his family who somehow know just what to say to call him up off the ground and to get him to try again.\n\nJoshua loves to meet new and familiar faces from around the parish and neighborhood and hear their own journeys of faith: the stories earlily shared, the stories hard to name, the stories that seem to have slipped through the cracks.\n\nJoshua began at St. Columba’s in March 2020, arriving simultaneously with the great pandemic. He would not meet most parishioners in-person for another year and a half. You can find out more about his background and current projects here.\n\nKate Murphy\n\nHead of St. Columba's Nursery School\n\n202-363-4119, EXT. 201 |\n\nKate Murphy has extensive experience in the field of early childhood education. After graduating from the George Washington University with a B.A. in Political Science and Psychology, she began her career as the Site Manager of Jumpstart at Georgetown University, an AmeriCorps program which promotes preschoolers’ language, literacy, and social skill development.\n\nKate then taught Pre-Kindergarten at a DC charter school for five years before becoming an Instructional Specialist with District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS). In this role, she was responsible for the coaching and professional development of early childhood educators to ensure all children received high-quality services. She was then promoted to become the Manager of the ECE Learning Lab, a professional learning program within DCPS that provided visiting educators the opportunity to observe developmentally appropriate, rigorous and joyful instruction, and then set goals for implementation in their own classrooms.\n\nBefore coming to St. Columba's Nursery School, Kate served as the Executive Director at The Community Preschool of the Palisades. In this role, she was responsible for managing all preschool operations and a team of educators in their implementation of play-based programming. Kate also holds a M.Ed. in Curriculum and Instruction with a Concentration in Early Childhood Education for Diverse Learners from George Mason University."
