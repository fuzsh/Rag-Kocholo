        "text": "Hello! I’m a Lead Software Engineer at Panorama Education on the Security Squad. My role involves implementing, improving, and coordinating platform security.\n\nI received my PhD from Princeton in April 2022. My PhD advisors were Prateek Mittal and Ed Felten. My dissertation work focused on longitudinal internet measurements to address and understand consumer protection issues. I’m generally interested in cryptography, security, privacy, and tech policy. Additionally, I have experience in computational genomics and computational immunology.\n\nIn my spare time, I climb rocks, I play the guitar, I ferment things (usually intentionally), I help run a local board game group, and I run a D&D campaign. Previously, I founded Princeton University Blacksmiths, I was a director for the New Jersey Blacksmiths Association, and I taught rock climbing.\n\nMy publications and ongoing projects can be found on my resume (link).\n\nYou can reach me at ryanamos@protonmail.com.\n\nResearch\n\nRyan Amos, Gunes Acar, Eli Lucherini, Mihir Kshirsagar, Arvind Narayanan, Jonathan Mayer.
