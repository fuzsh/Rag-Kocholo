Dr. Benaloh’s numerous research publications in cryptography and voting have pioneered new technologies including the “cast or spoil” paradigm that brings voters into the verification process with minimal burden. He has served on the program committees of dozens of cryptography and election-related conferences and workshops and is a frequent speaker on the history, development, and mechanisms behind verifiable voting. Among other side interests, Dr. Benaloh recently completed two years as chair of the Citizen Oversight Panel for the Seattle region’s Sound Transit agency that is currently investing about $1 billion per annum in improving the region’s mass transit infrastructure.

He specializes in applied cryptography and network security, with a focus on cyber threats to electronic and online voting.\n\nDuring his graduate research he worked with eminent cryptographers David Chaum and Ron Rivest to develop cryptographic techniques for publicly end-to-end (E2E) verifiable elections. In 2007 he co-organized the first E2E deployment in a binding election for the University of Ottawa’s graduate students’ union. In 2009, and again in 2011, he was part of a team led by Chaum and Rivest that deployed Scantegrity in Takoma Park, MD-–the first E2E verifiable system used in a governmental election.\n\nPart of his research focuses on applications of cryptography to the sharing of health information, such as private records linkage and genomic privacy. His postdoctoral work at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario focused on the design of secure protocols for public-health surveillance. His work in applied cryptography includes the recent discovery of an RSA-based public-key encryption scheme for homomorphically computing one-sided threshold functions.\n\nHis recent work in election technology has focused on the discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities in existing online voting deployments. In 2015 his research group discovered vulnerabilities in the Helios voting website including allowing a disgruntled voter to prevent election results from being decrypted, or for an attacker to cast arbitrarily many votes (even negative votes), while presenting valid cryptographic “proof” the election was counted correctly. He was part of the research team that studied the iVote internet voting system used in the Western Australia state election in 2017, which raised important questions about extent of trust placed in cloud providers in the election setting.\n\nIn 2014 he served as a subject matter expert evaluating the security of vendor proponent systems in the city of Toronto’s internet voting RFP process. He co-authored a report finding that no proposal met the city’s security requirements, which has been made available online by Verified Voting under freedom of information.\n\nHe has contributed to several recent decisions in Canada at various levels of government declining (and in one case reversing) the adoption of online voting, including by the parliamentary Special Committee on Electoral Reform (2016), the New Brunswick Special Commission on Electoral Reform (2016), the city of Toronto (2016), and the city of Guelph (2017).\n\nDr. Essex received a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Waterloo in 2012.
