Per Wikipedia, Dennis William Siahou Sciama, Frs (1926 ?1999) Was A British Physicist Who, Through His Own Work And That Of His Students, Played A Major Role In Developing British Physics After The Second World War, And He Is Considered One Of The Fathers Of Modern Cosmology. Sciama Earned His Phd In 1953 At The University Of Cambridge Supervised By Paul Dirac With A Dissertation On Mach's Principle And Inertia. His Work Later Influenced The Formulation Of Scalar-Tensor Theories Of Gravity. Sciama Taught At Cornell University, King's College London, Harvard University And The University Of Texas At Austin, But Spent Most Of His Career At The University Of Cambridge (1950S And 1960S) And The University Of Oxford As A Senior Research Fellow In All Souls College, Oxford (1970S And Early 1980S). In 1983, He Moved From Oxford To Trieste, Becoming Professor Of Astrophysics At The International School For Advanced Studies (Sissa), And A Consultant With The International Centre For Theoretical Physics. He Also Taught At The Scuola Normale Superiore Of Pisa. From 1972 To 1973 He Was The Donegall Lecturer In Mathematics At Trinity College Dublin. Sciama Made Connections Among Some Topics In Astronomy And Astrophysics. He Wrote On Radio Astronomy, X-Ray Astronomy, Quasars, The Anisotropies Of The Cosmic Microwave Radiation, The Interstellar And Intergalactic Medium, Astroparticle Physics And The Nature Of Dark Matter. Most Significant Was His Work In General Relativity, With And Without Quantum Theory, And Black Holes. He Helped Revitalize The Classical Relativistic Extension To General Relativity Known As Einstein-Cartan Gravity. Early In His Career, He Supported Fred Hoyle's Steady State Cosmology, And Interacted With Hoyle, Hermann Bondi, And Thomas Gold. When Evidence Against The Steady State Theory, E.G., The Cosmic Microwave Radiation, Mounted In The 1960S, Sciama Abandoned It And Worked On The Big Bang Cosmology; He Was Perhaps The Only Prominent Steady-State Supporter To Switch Sides (Hoyle Continued To Work On Modifications Of Steady-State For The Rest Of His Life, While Bondi And Gold Moved Away From Cosmology During The 1960S). During His Last Years, Sciama Became Interested In The Issue Of Dark Matter In Galaxies. Among Other Aspects He Pursued A Theory Of Dark Matter That Consists Of A Heavy Neutrino, Certainly Disfavored In His Realization, But Still Possible In A More Complicated Scenario. Several Leading Astrophysicists And Cosmologists Of The Modern Era Completed Their Doctorates Under Sciama's Supervision, Notably:George Ellis (1964), Stephen Hawking (1966) Brandon Carter (1967) Martin Rees (1967) Gary Gibbons (1973) James Binney (1975) John D. Barrow (1977) Philip Candelas (1977) David Deutsch (1978) Adrian Melott (1981) Antony Valentini (1992). Sciama Also Strongly Influenced Roger Penrose, Who Dedicated His The Road To Reality To Sciama's Memory. The 1960S Group He Led In Cambridge (Which Included Ellis, Hawking, Rees, And Carter), Has Proved Of Lasting Influence. Bestandsnummer des Verkäufers 052684
