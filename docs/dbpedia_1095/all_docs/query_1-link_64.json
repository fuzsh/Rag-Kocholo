        "text": "Profile\n\nDoctor Leonardo Di G. Sigalotti D. was born in Udine, Italy, on May 10, 1961, and is currently a Professor in the Area of Physics of Irreversible Processes of the Department of Basic Sciences of the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM) Azcapotzalco Campus.\n\nHe completed his B.Sc. in Physics at the Universidad de Los Andes (Mérida, Venezuela) and his M.Sc. and Ph.D. studies in Theoretical Astrophysics at the Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati (SISSA, Trieste, Italy) under the direction of Prof. Dennis W. Sciama and Prof. Fernando de Felice. He later held a Postdoctoral position under the supervision of Prof. Sciama at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP, Trieste, Italy).\n\nIn September 2000, he accepted a position as a permanent researcher at the Physics Center of the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research (IVIC) in Caracas, Venezuela, and in 2014 he was invited by the Universidad AUtónoma Metropolitana (UAM) Azcapotzalco Campus to occupy the Francisco Medina Nicolau Chair in the Area of Physics of Irreversible Processes.\n\nHe has authored and co-authored several research articles in international journals and book chapters in the areas of astrophysics, computational fluid dynamics, thermofluidics, numerical methods, and experimental fluid mechanics as editor of several books in fluid dynamics. Some of these articles represent important contributions to Star Formation Theory, to the problem of Anisotropic Dispersion in porous media and to the Mathematical Consistency of the numerical simulation method SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics).\n\nHe currently collaborates with several research groups in Mexico and abroad and has coordinated research projects in astrophysics and applied physics. He is currently the coordinator for the Azcapotzalco Campus of the SENER-CONACYT Enerxico Project in collaboration with several Mexican and European institutions on the construction of a Multiphase Simulator for enhanced crude oil extraction in fractured reservoirs."
