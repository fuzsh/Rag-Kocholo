        "text": "Dennis Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Dennis is a boy's name of French origin meaning \"god of Nysa\".\n\nAlthough it has come to sound Irish, Dennis is one of the most widely-used French names (St. Denis is the patron saint of France) and harks back even further to Dionysius, the Greek god of wine and debauchery. It was introduced to England by the Normans.\n\nDennis was considered cool when it was near the top of the charts in the 1940s and 1950s, but has been slipping ever since, thanks in part to the devilish Dennis the Menace.\n\nDennis Barlow is the main character in Evelyn Waugh's satirical 1948 novel The Loved One. Some prominent namesakes also include Dennis Hopper, Dennis Rodman, Dennis Quaid, Dennis Leary and Dennis Wilson. Denis is a secondary spelling.\n\n# 643 in the US\n\nDennis Rank in US Top 1000\n\n# 563 on Nameberry\n\nDennis Rank in Nameberry Top 1000\n\nDennis Popularity\n\n643US2023\n\n563Nameberry2024\n\n866Future2028\n\n356England2021\n\n191Germany2016\n\nFamous People Named Dennis\n\n(John) Dennis Hastert51st U.S. Speaker of the House\n\nDennis William QuaidAmerican actor\n\nDennis ChristopherAmerican actor\n\nDennis Lee HopperAmerican actor\n\nDennis FranzAmerican actor\n\nDennis Carl WilsonAmerican musician of The Beach Boys\n\nDennis John KucinichU.S. Congressman from Ohio\n\nDennis MillerAmerican comedian\n\nDennis Dexter HaysbertAmerican actor\n\nDennis Keith RodmanAmerican basketball player\n\nDennis Leroy SpringerAmerican baseball player\n\nDennis Gregory PittaAmerican football player\n\nDennis Marvin SeidenbergGerman NHL Hockey player\n\nDennis William SciamaBritish physicist\n\nDennis GaborHungarian,British engineer; winner of the Nobel Prize\n\nDennis O'NeilAmerican comic book writer and editor"
