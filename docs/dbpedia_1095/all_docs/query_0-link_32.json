        "text": "Did the universe come into existence as the accidental result of some quantum‐mechanical twitch in the primordial ether? Does it have a purpose? Was created by a conscious god?\n\nUntil very recently, Mose questions seemed so far beyond the scope of practical investigation that most scientists shrugged them off as belonging to the domain of philosophers and theologians.\n\nBut in the last decade there has been an explosion of information about the first few instants of the universe's existence. Indeed many cosmologists, astronomers and physicists believe man may be approaching a monumental leap in knowledge,. one that would forever shape the human view of existence and purpose.\n\nThrough the increasingly sensitive “eyes” of astronomy—the giant radio telescopes on earth and the orbiting observatories tuned to gamma, ultraviolet and X‐radiations from deepest space—it may soon he possible to achieve extremely accurate estimates of the amount of matter in the universe. As startling as this knowledge would be in itself, its philosophical implications would be even more staggering.\n\nAstronomers believe that the universe contains roughly one atom for every 88 gallons of space. But if there is slightly less matter than this, the combined gravitational effect will be too weak to hold the universe together, and it will go on expanding forever, an eternity of growing colder, emptier and deader.\n\nThat would imply, many scientists believe, that the universe had only one beginning in the past, a unique and universal genesis.\n\nSuch a concept, some of them argue,; would he consistent with religion, with'’ the belief that there was a definite, purposeful beginning and that the beginning was wrought by the hand of God.\n\nOn the other hand, precise new estimates might indicate slightly more than one atom In every 88 gallons of space. In that case, gravitational force would be sufficient to slow down the observed expansion of the galaxies, finally stopping them altogether, like a ball thrown into the air with insufficient force to escape earth's gravity.\n\nThen the galaxies would inexorably fall back toward their central starting point, heating up and finally crushing one another into the tiny space from which they began. This, according to a common view, would initiate a new explosion and a new cycle of universal birth.\n\nIf that model is correct, many cosmologists believe, the universe would seem to have neither point nor purpose, but would be merely an infinitely repeating I series of accidental bounces. And that model doubtless would be cited in arguing against the Biblical version of the creation.\n\nWhen several of the world's leading physicists, astronomers and cosmologists were interviewed, some were reluctant to discuss personal views, on grounds that the privacy of faith, or lack of faith, should be respected.\n\nThey agreed that there was nothing intrinsically unknowable about the ultimate beginning. But there was disagreeiment as to the scientific theories and their philosophic implications about our ultimate fate.\n\nA majority clearly shared the ;somewhat gloomy view of Dr. Steven Weinberg, a well‐known Harvard University particle physicist whose book about the origin lof the universe, “The First Three ,Minutes,” appeared recently.\n\nDr. Weinberg wrote:\n\n! “The more the universe seems compreliensible, the more it also seems pointless.\n\n“The effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things that lifts human life a little above the level of farce, and gives it some of the grace of tragedy.”\n\nA contrasting view was expressed by one of the two scientists whose observations, in 1964 and 1965, began the current surge of cosmological discovery.\n\nHe is Dr. Arno A. Penzias, who, with Dr. Robert W. Wilson, also of Bell Telephone Laboratories, first observed the very faint radio signal left over from the “big bang” in which the universe generally believed to have begun 10 billion to 20 billion years ago.\n\nThe discovery of that signal convinced most proponents of rival theories, including the noted British astronomer Sir Fred ‘Hoyle, that the “big bang” theory of the origin of the universe was correct.\n\nBut Dr. Penzias, despite the part his observation played in shaping the thinking of such physicists as Dr. Weinstein, believes that they are wrong in asserting that the universe is pointless.\n\n“The thing I'm most interested in now,” Dr. Penzias said in an interview, “is whether the universe is open or closed. If it is open”—that is, expanding forever from a single great explosion of genesis—“and the data seems to ‘indicate that it is open, this is precisely the universe that organized religion predicts, to put it in !crude terms.\n\n“A closed universe, one that explodes, expands, falls back on itself and explodes again, repeating the process over and over eternally, that would be a pointless universe.”\n\nThe astronomer continued:\n\n“A theologian friend of mine who is ‘a priest told me once he could not conceive of Calvary happening twice. He said his faith as a Christian would be shaken if it could be proven to him that the universe, with its finite number of particles, could be reconstituted an infinite number of times.\n\n“It would mean that every event—the creation of man, this conversation we are having, everything—would be repeated again and again an infinite number of times, simply by random chance. That is the meaning of infinity. In other words, a closed universe would be pointless as the throw of dice.\n\n“But it seems to me that the data we have in hand right now clearly show that there is not nearly enough matter in the universe, not enough by a factor of three, for the universe to be able to fall back on itself ever again.”\n\n“My argument,\"/Dr. Penzias concluded, “is that the best data we have are exactly what I would have predicted, had I had nothing to go on but the five books of Moses, the Psalms, the Bible as a whole.”\n\nA different view was expressed by Dr. Robert H. Dicke, the Princeton University physicist whose theoretical work predicted that a big bang would result in exactly the faint fossil radio signal Dr. Penzias actually detected.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Dicke described as conceivable a model of successive universes, reincarnating themselves in changing form, “almost suggestive of Hindu beliefs.”\n\nDr. Dicke noted that science has not yet discovered any theoretical tools enabling it to peer back past the big bang of creation.\n\nThe “singularity” of the big bang indicated by known physical laws, but the same laws fail to describe what could happen within the “singularity” and beyond it.\n\nThere are some hints that genesis might have been like this, Dr. Dicke said:\n\n“It might have been some little quantum fluctuation that produced a universe containing only a couple of particles, lasting for only an infinitesmal period of time, collapsing and producing some more particles, then expanding again.”\n\nAfter only 300 or tso oscillations, such a process might have produced the universe in which we live, a universe regarded by many cosmologists as being remarkable in its ability to produce life.\n\nIf certain basic physical functions were only slightly different when the universe came into being, they say—and there are no theoretical reasons why such functions should have the values they do now —the stars could not have created the heavy elements, including carbon, on which life depends.\n\nSubequent oscillations, Dr. Dicke speculated, might produce other universes in which life would again be impossible.\n\nDr. Dicke said he saw no need for conflict between organized religion and the new discoveries of astronomy and physics.\n\n“Of course, the scientist must take the view that there's a rational explanation of things—the causal view,” he said.\n\nDr. Dicke said that many of the puzzles and enigmas faced by cosmologists were likely to disappear as better observations became possible, for example, X‐ray and other observations from artificial satellites.\n\nSir Fred Hoyle, the cosmologist who proposed a “steady‐state” universe with neither beginning nor end, in which matter is created spontaneously to fill the spaces left by expansion, was compelled by the observations of Dr. Penzias to abandon his theory.\n\nInterviewed by telephone at his country home in England, Dr. Hoyle said he did not consider the debate over a “closed” or “open” universe the central problem, however.\n\n“I think the main controversy is whether the so‐called origin of the universe really has to be taken literally, or whether this is a physical transition from preceding stage,” he said. “I personally have little doubt that there has to be a preceding stage, perhaps even an evolutionary process.”\n\nAsked specifically whether he saw an ultimate beginning, and if so, whether’ it came about by divine will or physical law, he replied:\n\n“I think when we understand what we call the nature of the universe, we shall, see that it fits quite clearly into a set of physical laws. So I have no time for'’ such views as that there is something outside of that.”\n\nMany scientists believe a new moister theory, one uniting existing physical field theories, is needed to look back to the instant of creation and beyond.\n\nThe noted British cosmologist, Dr. Dennis W. Sciama, believes such a theory may already be taking form in the hands of one of his former research student's, Dr. Stephen Hawking.\n\nDr. Hawking discovered in 1974 that black holes, celestial objects of such enormous density that neither light nor matter may escape them, actually radiate energy and finally explode.\n\nThe sophisticated mathematics Dr. Hawking developed in the process—“work of genius,” Dr. Sciama called it—seem to (show for the first time a relationship between three branches of physics, classical therModynamics, the general theory of relativity and quantum field theory.\n\nJust such a relationship may give scientists the theoretical tool for examining the genesis fireball that exploded our cosmos into existence 15 billion years ago.\n\n“We live in an exciting time,” Dr. Sciama said. views on the origin of the universe. Dr. Weinberg believes that the universe is pointless; Dr. Penzias sees evidence of a plan of divine creation."
