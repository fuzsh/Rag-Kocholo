        "meta_description": "IT has recently been proposed1 that the free electrons giving rise to the observed dispersion of pulsar signals result mainly from photoionization induced by the decay of dark matter particles in the Galaxy. For reasons related to conservation of energy and momentum the decay photons would have a unique energy in the rest frame of the decaying particles, and in the proposed theory this energy is close to 14 eV. A crucial prediction of the theory is that in regions where the dark matter density is approximately constant, the free electron density ne in opaque H I regions should also be approximately constant, when averaged over several mean free paths for the ionizing photons. The determination of an accurate distance for the pulsar PSR1451-68 (ref. 2), in combination with its known dispersion measure and with previous observations of two other pulsars with accurate distances, leads to a successful test of this prediction.",
