        "text": "The American Institute For Foreign Study Foundation helps people from many nations and cultures gain global competencies through firsthand, human interaction and opportunities to travel and study abroad. AIFS Foundation is a public charity that was established in 1967, with the assistance of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nOur goal is to raise funds to enable more deserving youth to learn about the world, other people and cultures, and to make the world a little smaller and a lot more enlightened. We hope you will consider joining our mission.\n\nAIFS Foundation Grants\n\nThe AIFS Foundation gives grants and scholarships annually to advance our mission. The Foundation is particularly proud of the scholarships that are awarded to youth from underserved populations to have the life-changing experience of traveling and studying abroad.\n\nDonations provide an invaluable source of financial aid to these students who otherwise could not pay for the cost of participating in a study abroad program. Our scholarship students provide us with feedback annually that confirms the benefits of the experience in providing more hope, knowledge and inspiration in their lives.\n\nWe partner with individuals and organizations that want to help promote globalization of our youth and to promote understanding between cultures."
