        "text": "Heritage Has Won Victories Benefiting All Americans\n\nFor 50 years, The Heritage Foundation has led the way for reforms in every policy area—from taxes and regulation to crime and national defense. With more than 100 policy experts, Heritage has the talent to tackle complex policy issues with simple and effective conservative solutions.\n\nThe entire Heritage enterprise—The Heritage Foundation, Heritage Action for America, and The Daily Signal—works on behalf of the American people to defend our liberties and our founding principles. This work has paid off time and again with major policy victories since we first opened our doors in 1973.\n\nSome of Heritage’s most notable achievements include:\n\n• The Reagan administration’s implementing nearly two-thirds of the 2,000 policy recommendations from our first ever “Mandate for Leadership.”\n\n• Inspiring President Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative and pushing American withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, both of which paved the way to defend America from missile attacks.\n\n• The historic 1996 welfare reform legislation that decreased child poverty and significantly increased employment.\n\n• The expansion of school choice via education savings accounts to 12 states and counting.\n\n• Success at preventing amnesty in multiple immigration bills, including major legislation in 2007 and 2018.\n\n• The Trump administration’s embrace of 64% of Heritage policy prescriptions through its annual budget, regulatory guidance, or other actions.\n\n• Recommending candidates for vacant seats that ultimately shaped the future of the Supreme Court that delivered the landmark decision overturning Roe v. Wade."
