        "text": "We’re thrilled to announce that we are now a member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), an organization that supports the growth and evolution of the cloud-native ecosystem.\n\nCounting over 500 members, CNCF is a vendor-neutral home for the fastest-growing projects on GitHub (including Kubernetes), the latest global public cloud and enterprise software companies, as well as over a hundred innovative startups like CAST AI.\n\n“The direction of cloud-native technologies CNCF fosters aligns with our approach here at CAST AI. I truly believe that Kubernetes has the potential to offer developers the freedom to deploy applications anywhere. We aim to decentralize and democratize the cloud industry to empower innovators worldwide to and reap the benefits of the autonomous cloud.”\n\nLaurent Gil, co-founder and CPO at CAST AI.\n\nWe believe that developers should focus on building unique products instead of worrying about their cloud infrastructure. Our AI-powered cloud optimization engine delivers a cost-efficient, high-performing, and resilient infrastructure for every Kubernetes workload. Its unique blend of automation and optimization algorithms empowers innovators to build future-ready solutions.\n\n“CNCF was founded to serve as a driving force for making cloud-native computing ubiquitous. In the context of a global pandemic, this mission is even more important and we have seen the resilience of our diverse community. We are very pleased to have companies like CAST AI join CNCF and help move forward innovation in the ecosystem.”\n\nPriyanka Sharma, General Manager of CNCF.\n\nWe look forward to building the future of cloud-native technologies together."
