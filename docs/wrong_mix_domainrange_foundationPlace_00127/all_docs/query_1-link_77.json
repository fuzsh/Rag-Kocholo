        "text": "With the release in June of version 5.12 ‚ÄúFirework‚Äù, OpenNebula went a step further to offer a pioneering approach that merges the strengths of an open source Cloud Management Platform with the many benefits of container technologies. Now, by joining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), OpenNebula confirms its commitment to support the deployment and management of containerized applications and Kubernetes clusters, both on premises and through its support for hybrid and edge cloud computing.\n\nThanks to its cutting-edge integration with Firecracker, the new virtualization technology developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and widely used as part of its Fargate and Lambda services, OpenNebula has managed to bridge the gap between two technological worlds, leaving behind the traditional dilemma between using containers‚Äîlighter but with weaker security‚Äîor Virtual Machines‚Äîwith strong security but high overhead.\n\nBy combining virtualization and container technologies with multi-tenancy, automatic provision and elasticity, and thanks to its native integration with Docker Hub, OpenNebula has become a powerful alternative to deploy and orchestrate containers as secure and fast microVMs. This enterprise-ready solution comes with all the features of a solid Cloud Management Platform but without adding extra layers of orchestration, thus reducing the complexity, resource consumption and operational costs.\n\nIn addition to this new native model for the orchestration of application containers, OpenNebula maintains its publicly available Kubernetes Virtual Appliance for KVM hosts and is also in the process of adopting K3s as its default technology for Kubernetes deployments at the edge. These additional options provide a simple way to deploy Kubernetes clusters whenever needed, thus helping businesses meet the growing needs of their development teams and DevOps practices while reducing their dependency on third-party vendors and Kubernetes-as-a-Service providers.\n\n‚ÄúWe are delighted to welcome OpenNebula to CNCF as a new Silver Member, and look forward to their contributions towards enabling better support for Kubernetes deployments at the edge.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Priyanka Sharma, General Manager, CNCF\n\nCheck OpenNebula.io/mastering-containers/ for more details! üöÄ"
