        "text": "A Letter from Our CEO\n\nThe path that First Foundation has taken to provide banking, trust services, financial planning, investment management, estate and legacy planning, and foundation support to our clients, all under one roof and all under the fiduciary standard of care, is a path not often traveled. But we prefer it this way.\n\nIn 2008 we created First Foundation, but our story dates back to 1990 when Rick Keller and his team at the Keller Group were providing wealth management services to individuals and businesses in Orange County. The Keller Group was one of the nation’s first wealth management firms to align their success with their clients, not just in how they invested but in how they were compensated for the work they did. In industry parlance this is referred to as ‘fee-only’ and ‘operating under the fiduciary standard’. For the Keller Group, it was just how business was done.\n\nAt First Foundation, we’ve never taken the easy path, but we’ve always chosen the right one – for our clients, our families, our communities, and each other.\n\nAs the needs of clients became more complex, First Foundation sought additional support to offer his clients true, comprehensive wealth management. In 2007, we started a bank and added it to the existing asset management platform. We would later add trust services, legacy planning, consulting, and insurance services. This was to be the core offering of our platform and delivered in a way that maintained a relentless focus on client service. I like to say that we have the capabilities of a multi-diversified financial institution, yet the personal touch of a boutique firm.\n\nWith the service offering firmly in place, we began to reach new clients and experience meaningful growth. Our talented team expanded as more and more people wanted to be a part of what we were building. This allowed us to not only grow our existing client base but expand into new regions. At each step, we looked to reinvest in the communities in which we serve, and build specific programs and solutions to help empower the non-profits affecting positive change in our own backyard.\n\nAs we sit here today, I am very pleased at what we have built, but I also know that this is just the beginning. In fact, the entire team at First Foundation is focused on continuing to find ways to better serve our clients and build on what we have started. As you will see, we have created something that is unique and we hope to have the opportunity to show you what our platform can do for your wealth and well-being."
