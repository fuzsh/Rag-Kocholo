It is taught by Alex Ellis, founder of OpenFaaS.[55]\n\nAmong many other organizations with similar offerings, The Linux Foundation has reported a 40% increase in demand for their online courses in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting social-distancing measures.[56]\n\nThe patent commons consists of all patented software which has been made available to the open source community. For software to be considered to be in the commons the patent owner must guarantee that developers will not be sued for infringement, though there may be some restrictions on the use of the patented code. The concept was first given substance by Red Hat in 2001 when it published its Patent Promise.[57]\n\nThe Patent Commons Project was launched on November 15, 2005, by the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL). The core of the project is an online patent commons reference library aggregating and documenting information about patent-related pledges and other legal solutions directed at the open-source software community. As of 2015 , the project listed 53 patents.[58]\n\nThe Linux Foundation's Open Compliance Program provides an array of programs for open-source software licensing compliance. The focus of this initiative is to educate and assist developers (and their companies) on licensing requirements, to make it easier to create new software. The program consists primarily of self-administered training modules, but it is also meant to include automated tools to help programmatically identify license compliance issues.[59]\n\nFunding for the Linux Foundation comes primarily from its Platinum Members, who pay US$500,000 per year according to Schedule A in LF's bylaws,[60] adding up to US$7.5 million.[61] The Gold Members contribute a combined total of US$1.2 million and Silver members contribute between US$5,000 and US$20,000 based on the amount of employees, summing up to at least US$6,240,000.[62]\n\nAs of June 2024, the foundation collected annual fees worth at least US$14,940,000.[63]\n\nBy early 2018, the Linux Foundation's website stated that it \"uses [donations] in part to help fund the infrastructure and fellows (like Linus Torvalds) who help develop the Linux kernel.\"[64]\n\nContributor Covenant - code of conduct intended to ensure a safe and harassment-free environment for minorities.\n\nLinux portal\n\nFree and open-source software portal"
