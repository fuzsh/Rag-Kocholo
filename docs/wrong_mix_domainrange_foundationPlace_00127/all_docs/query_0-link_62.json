The opportunity to iterate and make quick decisions is very powerful.”\n\nAmber McMillan\n\nSenior Vice President of Fitness and Weight Loss\n\n\"Building the healthcare metrics quick start app let us pull in data points from systems and departments. In doing so, we found new ways that we and other health care organizations can use data to solve problems, explore new ideas, make better decisions, and learn what works best for our staff and the patients and families we serve.”\n\nNiranjani Radhakrishnan\n\nDirector of the Center for Information and Analytics, Regional One Health\n\n\"I think the best parts of our day are spent in Domo, exploring data. Finding new ways to understand the data and then visualizing the data so that we can add value across the organization.\"\n\nDominic Blosil\n\nCFO, Traeger\n\n“Using the tiles of the Magic ETL, that is revolutionary of no code....It is where end users are empowered to take the data and do with it what they want because they don't have to write code against it.”\n\nBruce Harris\n\nDirector of Finance Applications, Torchy's Tacos"
