        "text": "Three friends with a shared dream: The story of NJTL began more than 50 years ago, as professional tennis entered a new age, the Open Era, that was full of possibilities. Arthur Ashe, Charlie Pasarell and Sheridan Snyder wanted to extend that potential to America's youth by introducing as many kids as they could to tennis, knowing first-hand the many benefits that the sport provided and lessons that it could could teach.\n\nNearly two decades later, NJTL moved under the umbrella of the USTA, and later still, it became the flagship program of the USTA Foundation. But those founding principles still guide the work of the NJTL network today."
