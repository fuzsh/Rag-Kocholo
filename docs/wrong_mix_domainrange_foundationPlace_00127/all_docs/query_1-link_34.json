        "text": "The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) serves as an open-source software foundation dedicated to advancing the adoption of cloud-native computing. Within CNCF’s extensive catalog, Kubernetes stands out as one of its major projects, operating a substantial infrastructure independently. Multiple companies contribute infrastructure resources to support activities such as builds, tests, and hosting images and packages.\n\nFor open-source project developers, the ethos of resource sharing is particularly crucial, especially in maintaining aspects like infrastructure. In 2023, the imperative arose to extend the existing infrastructure beyond Google Cloud, encompassing AWS. This expansion aimed to distribute resources efficiently, optimize the allocated budget on Google Cloud, and leverage the AWS sponsorship to sustain the project’s operations.\n\nConfronted with this time-sensitive situation, CNCF turned to Kubermatic, a renowned member of the CNCF and the leading contributor to the Kubernetes Project in Europe. In early January 2023, Kubermatic’s engineers, already integral members of the Kubernetes Community, dedicated themselves full-time to assist in the endeavor. Their focus was on designing and implementing a cross-cloud solution for the Kubernetes Project.\n\nIn Time Migration to keep the Kubernetes Project in Budget.\n\nThanks to the swift onboarding of Kubermatic Engineers into the project, the team could efficiently address multiple migrations simultaneously, collaborating closely with the sig-k8s-infra community."
