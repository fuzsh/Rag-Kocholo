Over the following 100-plus years since, we have served as a trusted partner connecting people who care with causes that matter.\n\nIn the process, we’ve awarded nearly $475 million in grants and scholarships to community organizations striving to make the world a better place. We’ve established a reputation as a regional leader by advancing change, addressing issues of importance and forging meaningful relationships.\n\nAs we turn the page on our first century of impact, it’s now time to build on this success. We view our second century of service as a unique and powerful opportunity to collaborate with our region’s leaders and changemakers to advance our shared quality of life — for today and for generations to come."
