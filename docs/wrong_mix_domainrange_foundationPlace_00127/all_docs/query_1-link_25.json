        "text": "We’re excited to announce that Northflank, provider of a self-service developer platform to automate deployments, has joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a silver member. We’re proud to be part of a community that has had such an incredible impact on the way modern software is built, deployed, orchestrated, and productionized.\n\nNorthflank is built on Kubernetes, Kata Containers, gVisor, Istio, and Cilium. Open source cloud native software is at our core, and allows us to deliver an exceptional cloud native experience for developers, devops teams, and platform engineers alike.\n\nThe Northflank engineering team has contributed to cloud-native projects including Kaniko, Buildkit, Kata Containers, Cloud Hypervisor, and more. When we’re not committing upstream, we’re deploying cloud-native projects into production, collecting performance data across thousands of diverse workloads, and presenting data upstream to enhance the cloud native technology stack. We’re committed to actively contributing to a community we believe has pulled the entire industry forward, and ensuring that open source cloud native technologies are secure, well-maintained, and accessible to everyone.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the CNCF, you can check out their website here. If you need a fully self-service unified developer platform to automate deployment of any workload, on any cloud, at any scale, take a few seconds to experience Northflank. You can launch your first app for free here →\n\nCNCF and the CNCF logo design are registered trademarks of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation."
