Cloud native computing uses an open source software stack to deploy applications as microservices, packaging each part into its own container, and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize resource utilization. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosts critical components of those software stacks including Kubernetes and Prometheus; brings together the industryâs top developers, end users, and vendors; and serves as a neutral home for collaboration. CNCF is part of The Linux Foundation.
