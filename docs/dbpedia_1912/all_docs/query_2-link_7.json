        "text": "Many employees, especially those who work for small businesses, do not have access to a workplace retirement plan. To address this gap, the State of New Jersey signed into law the New Jersey Secure Choice Savings Program Act; creating a retirement savings program for small businesses.\n\nThe RetireReady NJ program is a state-mandated Individual Retirement Account (Auto-IRA) model. Under this program, employers who do not currently offer a retirement program to their employees may be required to offer the RetireReady NJ program.\n\nWhat is the RetireReady NJ plan?\n\nIt is a state-run IRA program for private sector workers who do not have a retirement plan available to them at work.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEmployers report to the state their full employee demographics and maintain those records with the state.\n\nThe state will send communications direct to the employees to notify them of their enrollment eligibility.\n\nEmployees who do not opt out or make another election will be automatically enrolled in the plan at 3% of gross pay.\n\nThe state will report contribution elections back to the employer to properly set-up payroll.\n\nWhat does this mean for employees?\n\nEmployees who do not have a retirement plan available to them at work will now have access to one via a state-run Roth or Traditional IRA (Individual Retirement Account) through convenient payroll deductions. This new program is an easy way for New Jersey workers to save for the future.\n\nEnrollment is simple. Once you join the program, payroll contributions start automatically, unless you opt out.\n\nYou’re in control. Decide your monthly contribution amount from your post-tax paycheck.\n\nIt's your money and account. Your savings and account stay with you if you change or leave jobs.\n\nWhat does this mean for employers?\n\nIf you have been in business for at least 2 years and have 25 employees (including part-time employees); you will now be required to offer a private retirement plan of your own or implement the RetireReady NJ program for your employees.\n\nIf you currently sponsor a SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, 401(k) or Defined Benefit Plan you already meet the requirement and are exempt from the RetireReady NJ program.\n\nFiling an Exemption for an Existing Retirement Plan\n\nStarting in May 2024, the state of New Jersey will be sending communications to all businesses registered in the state. This communication will include a link and access code for your specific business. If you already sponsor a retirement plan, you will follow the instructions in the communication to file for your existing plan exemption.\n\nPlease contact us if you have any questions or concerns completing this process.\n\nEmployer Responsibilities\n\nThe employer’s only responsibilities are to maintain accurate employee records and submit payroll contributions. This includes updating contribution elections for any changes as well as adding new employees to the system and removing those who have terminated. Aside from remitting contributions to the state, the employer has NO ongoing relationship with the IRA account or access to the accounts.\n\nIf you do not currently sponsor a retirement plan and you meet the requirements (been in business for 2 years and have 25 or more employees; including part time), then you have options. You can choose to join the RetireReady NJ program or implement your own private retirement program.\n\nBelow is a comparison of some other plan types that are often used by small business owners:\n\nStill wondering how to select the right retirement plan for your business? Contact us to help you decide or learn more about how to meet the new state requirements.\n\n- Article posted on 5/29/24 -\n\nDisclaimer"
