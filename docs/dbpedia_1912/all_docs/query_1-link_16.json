        "text": "The past twelve months have seen an appalling series of deaths of people irreplaceable in my life. I am sure you have your own list of singular creators, remarkable men and women who have “moved offstage,” but my list includes Larry McKenna, Max Morath, Manfred Selchow, Harriet Choice, and most recently, Bill Allred, Robert D. Rusch, and Jan Evensmo.\n\nWhat follows, more personal history than research paper, will be short on exact dates, but I hope readers will understand the grief, astonishment, and rage that I am now feeling. John Berryman wrote a poem on the death of his friends and peers that begins “I’m cross with god,” and although shaking one’s fist at the heavens is not effective, I feel the same way.\n\nBoth Bob Rusch (who signed off as RDR) and Jan Evensmo came into my life many decades ago, and to some eyes my contact with them would seem tenuous at most: I never saw Bob face-to-face and Jan only once, but both of them were strong presences in my life for those same decades. They were very dear to me, and no one can take their place. I will explain.\n\nI was reading about jazz from my earliest teens, and I then subscribed to a few periodicals to learn more about musicians and their latest recordings, as well as historical retrospectives. First there was the IAJRC JOURNAL — IAJRC standing for International Association of Jazz Record Collectors, then the Mississippi Rag. The first of these subscriptions pre-dates any computer use; the second was a little more recent, but both began in the previous century. The IAJRC felt, at times, like an international version of the clubhouse that met in someone’s basement, and the editor solicited record reviews and other material. I don’t remember when I began writing for them, but I had time and energy (a holiday from grading freshman essays) and so I submitted reviews of records I had bought. Parallel to this, I should note, I was a thirtyish untenured instructor at Nassau Community College, someone who liked to see his name in print and was flattered that his views on, say, the latest Concord lp would be published.\n\nI wrote enough for the Journal to summon up the energy, or perhaps hubris, to ask the then editor, whose name I have forgotten, if I could be granted a free subscription, and received a haughty reply that HE had never asked for such a thing, suggesting that something was morally wrong with my doing so. I turned elsewhere. I have written about Leslie Johnson, the endearing editor of the Rag, but that association ended with her death. (Everyone who came in contact with Leslie will look wistful at the mention of her name.)\n\nNear my college was a well-stocked Tower Records, whose jazz department had a space for periodicals, and I spent some time there, after browsing the three dozen bins of my favorite artists, leaning against the browser, reading CADENCE for free. It was published montly in Redwood, New York, and its editor was one Robert D. Rusch. I suspect I wrote Mr. Rusch a letter, immodestly detailing my previous publications (I had also written for some jazz magazines that tended to stop publication shortly after I had submitted reviews, alas) and he began to send me parcels of CDs and books. Both the discs and the books came with one top corner cut off, to discourage resale as new, and they had small rectangular orange stickers with CADENCE’s contact details. I have many such benevolences still on my shelves.\n\nMany of the artists covered in that journal were new to me, and many, because I was more provincial then than I hope I am now, seemed positively weird, but Bob was a seeker after truth. Although Leslie Johnson wanted to support the fragile art of hot music with positive reviews, Bob had a pugnacious side. I remember well that when I submitted a review of a Billy Taylor compilation on the Classics label, and said Taylor, then a Jazz Eminence, bored me with his repetition of pet phrases, I called Bob to ask if such heresy was all right, and was delighted that he encouraged me to be as iconoclastic as I liked.\n\nCADENCE was and is honest, a striking rarity in the world of jazz journalism, where a favorable review of A’s new disc, book, or gig, may nestle comfortably near A’s paid ad for their work. Bob’a magazine ran advertisements, but he made sure that there was a blank page, noted as such, between the ads and the reviews. I could write quickly and hand in copy promptly, so the parcels of CDs and books came quickly and they were generous.\n\nBob wanted me to — his own word — “stretch,” perhaps beyond what he perceived as my provincialism. And when I said to him, “Suppose I — out of my limited awareness — say that a saxophonist reminds me of Dexter Gordon when people who know more will hear them as copying Hank Mobley? I don’t want to make mistakes out of ignorance?” he assured me that he would catch any such errors before they saw print. So, mixed in with the Arbors and Concords would be a solo CD by a saxophonist, four long pieces on the tragedy of Chernobyl, a CD the saxophonist had created and paid for in every detail. I might have found it difficult to listen to, like cramming a sheaf of dry crackers in my mouth and trying to swallow, and I battled with the ethical conflict between “telling the truth” and feeling that I was doing the artist an unkindness by saying that the CD was tedious. Who was I, in the name of “honest criticism,” to ensure that some ambitious creator found their art unsaleable, simply because I found it boring? I no longer wanted to parade my subjective reactions under the heading of criticism that someone might take seriously, so, with much thought, I stopped writing for Bob.\n\nBut I did so with great regret. Of course some of the pangs came from no longer receiving free CDs and books, but more than that, it meant I lost contact with the man who signed off as “RDR.” He could appear gruff; his emails were often abrupt in their presentation (he had no time to waste) but he was unfailingly kind to me. I remember phone conversations about a variety of subjects — one in particular a detailing of the dynamics of long marital car trips — that are memorable to me today.\n\nAnd he was as attentive to his fellow beings as he was to the sounds on a disc. When I began writing for his magazine, I was in an unhappy marriage, and when the phone rang in the kitchen (this, of course, dates the story) my then-wife would stand near me to eavesdrop on what was going on, which made for tension in my voice. When she and I separated, and I had my first phone conversation with Bob, I said nothing of my changed circumstances, but he made a point of telling me how different, how relaxed I sounded, which was a great gift to me, helping me to look back on the lengthy painful experience from an outsider’s perspective, all the things I had tried to pretend were not happening.\n\nAt some point, he suffered a stroke, but apparently he kept listening and writing. And he turned to painting. The obituary says that he left us at 80, which is and was all too soon. He did not look for cyber-attention, which is why there is no portrait of him here, and I have offered instead a CADENCE cover. He remains a powerful presence in my thought, and he is one of the people who, by their encouragement, gave me courage to write without hiding behind tactful veils. We all need people who stand behind us, their hand on our shoulder, saying “Go ahead. It’s OK.”\n\nSome appropriate music for RDR:\n\nI wrote about Jan Evensmo in 2016, here, but he had been a jazz-hero since the Seventies and eventually a friendly correspondent. Our most recent e-mail exchange was on December 27, 2023.\n\nHe was a remarkable and original scholar and human being, someone who codified an idea and did the arduous sustained work to bring it to life, all the while sharing it with us. Jazz had discographies — unadorned data-based listings of recordings, usually in chronological order, with the artists arranged alphabetically. And eventually more subjective essays on artists appeared, tracing the shape of their careers, recording by recording. Sometimes the latter was part of a life-study, hence the jazz biography. But Jan invented and mastered what he called “solographies,” chronological listings of recordings, broadcasts, film soundtracks and more — any aural evidence we had — of an artist, in chronological order.\n\nLet us say someone wanted to know the facts of all the times Chu Berry was recorded, in whatever medium. A discography would list the records; a biography might add to that list with life-events. But what Jan did was to listen closely to the evidence, no matter how arcane or inaccessible, state its details (not only the song and the musical context, but the length of the solo passage) and then — and here’s the beautiful part — make a judgment and give his reasons. Those judgments could be rhapsodic or sharp-edged, and, to his credit, he often went back and revised himself when he felt he had been wrong, noting his first (perhaps myopic) response and changing it, admirably. So, in reading any entry, one had a double experience: the analytical facts intertwined with highly personal (and well-reasoned) reactions. It was the printed equivalent of being invited to a wise friend’s house to listen to and discuss records, when that friend would say, “That is so very wonderful!” but also “I am disappointed by that piece of music.”\n\nThe scope of his investigations — his curiosity, his eagerness to hear something new and wonderful (because he didn’t take pleasure in loudly announcing that he thought a solo was second-rate) — was huge.\n\nWhen you visit his extraordinary site, https://www.jazzarcheology.com/, you see that the latest additions to the musicians whose work he was exploring are Sandy Williams, Ray Nance, Henry Hagemann, Phil Urso, and George Matthews. Wisely, he left the figures whose work has already been documented (Armstrong, Holiday, Parker, Ellington, Goodman, Tatum) to others. But who else was listening to everything Phil Urso had recorded?\n\nI first encountered his dazzling work in the middle Seventies, thanks to a generous collector and friend, Bill Coverdale, who shared my fascination with the trumpeter Joe Thomas. In those pre-computer days, Bill and I communicated by typed letters, phone calls, cassette tapes, and photostats. Bill lent me Jan’s booklets on Joe Thomas and Bill Coleman, if I recall correctly, and they were not only full of information and sharp-eared perspectives on music I knew or thought I knew, but they opened a treasure-box of recordings I wanted to hear . . . shiny objects to pursue and then treasure.\n\nI don’t know when I first wrote to Jan, but I believe he had noted he was looking for rare recordings by artists we revered in common, and I let him know I had them and sent cassette copies. And then, because our interchange had been kind, I took a risk and said, “Is there any way I could hear ________? (I think it was a Jerry Newman live recording of Frank Newton called FORNICULI, FORNICULA, FORNICULATE — Newman’s odd boyish humor at work.) Jan put me in touch with the collector who had given the music to him, and I received a copy in the mail. And, slowly and intermittently, our trading-friendship began. I had received some rare music; I sent it to him, asking for something rare in return, and we proceeded. (I doubt that my experience is unique in a world of collectors who are simultaneously keeping their treasures locked up but making the odd copy for someone who has something they want, both sides writing DO NOT COPY on the side of the cassette and pretending not to see their music-driven violations of their own code.)\n\nWhen he began to share his work online, in the site mentioned above, I would get an email saying that he had explored a new artist, or, more frequently, he had added material to a dozen entries on musicians one thought he’d already explored more deeply than anyone else had. I would send him new treasures or things I had uncovered, and would receive some of my own requests with kind (although sharply-focused) replies. It, and he, became a constantly-replenished feast. And the more I read of his commentary, the more endearing a person he became: his unique self, both enthusiastic and salty, came through.\n\nI met him once in person, at the Whitley Bay Jazz Party, sometime around 2012. In a room full of people talking about music and records, he came up to me, introduced himself happily, stood there while I told him (I hope briefly) how much his work meant to me, he graciously returned the compliments, we shook hands, and he went off to talk to an expert, an admirer, a friend.\n\nEveryone who benefited from his work will miss the information he gave us so lavishly and consistently. Some of us will also miss the man who apparently spent his life getting it right, making sure those of us who shared his loves did so from a platform of correct information.\n\nI do not privilege one of these men above the other. Bob helped me become braver; Jan metaphorically invited me and anyone else to his house to share what he heard. It’s been said before, but the art form called jazz is sustained and developed by people who never adjust a ligature.\n\nI mourn these losses. But what does one do with such grief?\n\nIn conversation, one of my dear friends, the superb jazz drummer Bernard Flegar, was lamenting the death of trombone master Bill Allred, and wrote, “I am truly saddened by Bill’s death and will forever try to digest losing Butch [Miles].” I thought about this for a moment and wrote back, “The way to mourn is to play.” Others have said it, but Bernard — driving the Louis-inspired ARMSTRONG’S AMBASSADORS — can make sure that Butch and others are still alive in his own playing. I can strive to be as encouraging as Bob Rusch, as generous as Jan Evensmo. Will I equal them? I don’t know. But acting in the best tradition is better than passive grief, or so I feel.\n\nI forego the usual closing flourishes. Back soon.\n\nI think sometimes that becoming a complete human being requires immense daily practice in the art of saying goodbye.\n\nOur emails (and perhaps the morning paper) tell us all about the deaths of people we love and know, or perhaps have never met. Jazz blogs like this one have to resist very strongly the urge to turn into the Daily Necrology.\n\nAnd we say goodbye to things and situations that are meaningful to us — and I don’t just mean the lost iPod or the very sweet person who used to work at the grocery store who has moved away.\n\nFor the jazz devotee, loss is tangible all around us. We awaken into this music with the sharp mournful awareness of the people we will never get to encounter in person. My readers can compile their own list of names.\n\nPlaces, too. Think of all the concerts we never got to, the clubs closed, the record stores now turned into banks and forgettable restaurants. Nick’s, the Commodore Music Shop, Swing Street, 47 West Third . . . and so on.\n\nThe past few years have been especially hard on print journalism, not simply for jazz periodicals, although in my own experience CODA and THE MISSISSIPPI RAG have both ended fruitful existences; JAZZ JOURNAL died and was reborn.\n\nAbout a week ago I got an email from CADENCE, which opened (after a polite salutation): By now you have heard that Cadence will stop publishing at the end of this year unless other arrangements come forth. (Any of you want to be a publisher?)\n\nI sidestepped the parenthetical question, but I read the announcement with sorrow and inevitability. In this century, any periodical that publishes with a minimum of advertising and a commitment to candor is remarkable. To do it for what will be thirty-six years at the end of 2011 (if my math is correct) is remarkable . . . and when you consider that the subject of CADENCE is and has been Creative Improvised Music, its continued stamina is an accomplishment to be celebrated at the same time we mourn the announced end of their epoch.\n\nI can’t speak for the world of, say, opera journalism or that of hip-hop. But about jazz publishing I do know something.\n\nAnd because it is a particularly cloistered world, with a smaller (sometimes more intense) audience than many other arts, it has certain inescapable qualities, one of them often a certain slyness.\n\nIn this world, candor is particularly rare: when the business end of a magazine must keep its advertising income up, the possibility of true assessments narrows.\n\nI have been told, explicitly, by two editors that writing negative reviews did jazz harm; their journals were there to encourage the music. So if I wrote that the Great Neck Jalapeno Boys were out of tune, my words did jazz an injustice.\n\nI was younger and more eager for an outlet, so I subsumed my criticisms in my reviews . . . and, to be fair, I was being asked to write about music I liked, for the most part. But I continue to see “reviews” (in quotations) and advertisements on adjacent pages in journals other than CADENCE.\n\nWhich came first, the chicken-journalism or the egg-money for the ads?\n\nCADENCE has been different. I confess that my first experience with the magazine goes a long way back — the Eighties — when Tower Records carried it, and I would stand in their magazine racks and skim it, looking for the names of people I recognized. My horizons were much narrower, and often I went away from my quick and selfishly unpaid-for reading thinking that it was full of discs by people I didn’t know and whose music I wouldn’t like if I did know.\n\nThat changed after I got a chance to write about some CDs that were more to my taste and after I spoke on the telephone to its editor, Bob Rusch (or RDR). He was imposing on the phone, but we got along fine — he only needled me that I was slow in sending reviews.\n\nAnd as our friendship deepened, I had — and have — the deepest respect for him as a person of feeling and perception, someone willing to commit himself to an ideal. The ideal had a hard time making money, and it would have been so much easier to be polite, take the ad money, make the deals. But Bob and the Crew are stubborn: their stubbornness coming from ethics and a love for the music.\n\nWhen, at the end of 2011, CADENCE might call it quits, I will have writen for it for about six years. They have been a rewarding experience. I haven’t liked all of what I’ve been asked to review, but I have been exposed to music and musicians — deeply gratifying — I never would have encountered otherwise. And Bob’s guidance has made me a better writer, a deeper thinker, a better listener. Hilariously, he’s only chided me when he thought I was being slippery-tactful, and he’s never asked me to change a word, even if I disliked music he thought was fine.\n\nI gather that even after CADENCE ceases to publish as a print journal, its other enterprises — creating CDs by worthy artists who aren’t well-represented in the mainstream, and promoting top-flight audio products by way of North County Audio — will continue. And there may be more, although I don’t know the details.\n\nI will be very sad when it all comes to a close — no more cardboard boxes of surprises! — but I salute Bob and the Crew for their wonderful example of loving fortitude. And if a publisher were willing to take over the magazine, I could certainly continue to do my bit . . . there is a small mound of CDs on the coffee table near me that I have to write about, now!\n\nHail, hail!\n\nREMEMBER: ALL MONEY COLLECTED BELOW GOES TO THE MUSICIANS! OH, CLICK THAT LINK!\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=VBURVAWDMWQAS\n\nSome history might be needed here. “A fig,” “a Moldy Fig,” even “a Mouldy Figge,” is now-archaic language invented during the Forties, when jazz found itself divided into warring factions called Dixieland and Bebop. This divisiveness may have splintered the music and its audiences irrevocably. Much of the noisy conflict was fomented by journalists and publicists seeking to attract audiences through controversy. At this distance, we know that GROOVIN’ HIGH is only WHISPERING with a new blouse, but people allowed themselves to ignore this. I find the poet Philip Larkin very endearing in his art and his vinegary energies, but his jazz prose embodies this point of view, where the world had reached an artistic peak in 1932 with the Rhythmakers recordings and had gone steadily downhill. I agree with the first part of this formulation but not the second.\n\nI began my devotional listening as a Fig, so it took a long gradual period of contemplative immersion before I could understand that, say, John Coltrane wasn’t The Enemy out to destroy the music I loved. In truth, I was never an extremist but I had strong, narrow likes and dislikes. I remember having a brief conversation with another student in a middle-school Music Appreciation class who was deeply immersed in the New Thing — this was forty-plus years ago and the new thing was Archie Shepp, and the conversation went like this:\n\n“Alan,” which might not be his name, but is a good guess: “I hear you like jazz.”\n\nMe (brightening at having found a fellow subversive): “Oh, yes, I do!”\n\n“Alan”: “Do you listen to Archie Shepp?”\n\nMe (horrified that he hadn’t mentioned Louis, and coming up with a wise-acre New Yorker rejoinder): “Archie Shepp?! I say it’s spinach, and I say to hell with it!”\n\n“Alan”: “Well, the hell with you!”\n\nSo goes critical discourse at its finest!\n\nI would like to boast that I’ve seen the light and the scales have dropped from my eyes, but if you told me I had to choose only one jazz recording to spend eternity with, it still might be AFTER YOU’VE GONE by the Blue Note Jazzmen, even though I can understand and appreciate music that would have perplexed and repelled me in my youth. And the music was always there, I just didn’t get it.\n\nThis self-scrutiny is provoked by a phone conversation I had yesterday with Bob Rusch (or RDR), editor and chief spiritual guide of the quarterly journal devoted to Creative Improvised Music, CADENCE. Full disclosure requires me to say that I write reviews for CADENCE, and I continue to admire the journal’s honesty. And working with Bob has always been a pleasurable lesson in Emersonian candor: when I have felt an inexplicable need to tactfully cloak the truth in polite words, he has always asked, “Why?”\n\nIf you’ve never read CADENCE, you have been missing something special and rare. See for yourself (www.cadencebuilding.com).\n\nIn the course of our conversation — we speak infrequently, but over the past five years it has always been both bracing and affectionate — Bob said gently that he thought I was “getting more figgish,” and I agreed. But it made me think, and perhaps my experience will ring true with my readers.\n\nThere used to be “the jazz record industry,” and I am not talking about sixty-five years ago, the Commodore Music Shop, and listening booths. Ten years ago, perhaps, there were many more active companies producing compact discs. (If you want to have a sobering experience, casually inspect the spines of any fifty CDs in your library and note how many of those labels no longer exist.) This, of course, has to do with the economy, an aging audience, and more.\n\nIt has had an double-edged result. On one hand, no more new issues from Chiaroscuro, no more Pablo, fewer ways for musicians to be encouraged by a label. But because labels no longer exist, many energetic musicians have gone into business for themselves and produce their own discs.\n\nThis can be a boon: musicians can record what they want, have it sound the way they want, without the interference of recording engineers or the heads of record companies . . . and splendid personal statements emerge. But this asks musicians to be both courageous and affluent (or at least credit-worthy): a self-produced CD might require a $10,000 investment that the artist might get back over ten years of selling the discs one at a time on the gig. We should all live and be well!\n\n(Musician joke: “My latest CD is a million-seller. I’ve got a million in my cellar.”)\n\nMany players I know have made a virtue of necessity, but I think many of them look back nostalgically to the dear dead days when they got a call to go to a studio at noon to make a date, they played their hearts out, they got paid, and eight months later they knew that the disc they had appeared on was being sold all over the world. Yes, their control over the music was compromised, their pay was a percentage of the profit, but someone else was handling all the annoying business.\n\nWhat this means for someone like myself, reviewing CDs, is that a good deal of what I am asked to listen to is by artists new to me (a good thing) who are offering their own music (potentially a good thing). And occasionally it leads me to sit up in my chair and say, “By God, (s)he’s got it!” Melissa Collard was new to me when I first heard her OLD-FASHIONED LOVE, and she is one of those singers whose work I most treasure. Mark Shane, Kevin Dorn, Dawn Lambeth, Marc Caparone, Danny Tobias, Lyle Ritz, Andy Brown, Petra van Nuis, and more.\n\nBut much of what I hear is both competent yet entirely forgettable. I know that Lips Page said, “The material is immaterial,” but hand me a CD full of original compositions by a player and I wonder, “Gee, you’ve already decided that there’s nothing new for you to say on the blues or on I’VE TOLD EV’RY LITTLE STAR?” Funny, that hasn’t occurred to Sonny Rollins.\n\nAnd it is sad to receive a CD by a singer or musician, male or female, where great effort has gone into burnishing the exterior at the expense of other things. When the artist credits his or her hair stylist and wardrobe person first, I think, “Oh no. Repertoire, not manicure. No one listens to the cover.”\n\nSo my “figgishness” or “figitude” (both my own coinings) is a way to get back to what music means to me — a spiritual / intellectual / experience that makes me want to grin foolishly and shout exultantly. I would indeed rather hear a wonderful performance of an original composition by musicians I don’t know than a tired rendition of OUR BUNGALOW OF DREAMS, but I need to hear jazz that makes me remember why I began to listen to the music in the first place: joy, inventiveness, clear delight in being alive in the face of death. If your listening is purely an intellectual exercise and you find that gratifying, fine, but mine is tied up with the emotions. Is the music beautiful? Does it make me feel some strong emotion, preferably happiness? Can I admire the players?\n\nSo I close this post with a new example of FINEST FIG JAM — pure, organic, and locally sourced. It’s another YouTube clip from the lucky and generous SFRaeAnn of the Eldorado Serenaders, whose front line is Don Neely on reeds, Robert Young on reeds, trumpet, and vocal, Dave Frey, plectrum banjo, Jim Young, tenor banjo, Steven Rose, sousaphone, Stan Greenberg, percussion. This performance of BALTIMORE (one of those delightful songs-about-a-new-dance-craze) honors Bix and Wingy and Red, and I think this band is terribly, admirably brave to be shouting it out in a bookstore. “Fit audience, though few,” said Milton, but he never had to worry about the tip jar. It was recorded on October 25, 2009 at North Light Books in Cotati, California.\n\nI first heard Barbara Rosene sing on a compact disc — the 2003 Stomp Off “Ev’rything’s Made For Love,” which I’d obtained serendipitously. Bob Rusch of Cadence thought I would take pleasure in this music, and (as is often the case) he was splendidly correct. I loved the sounds — plural, not singular — of Barbara’s pure, clear voice, tenderly exploring the layers of feeling in a ballad, being naughty on a double-entendre Twenties song, or simply swinging her way exultantly through one of those unashamedly happy songs that used to be the fashion. Although Barbara often sang obscure songs, she was more than an archivist delighting in artistic esoterica.\n\nSome singers sing at the song, or, worse, they present it at a distance with ironic quotation marks around it. Barbara immerses herself in the emotions of the lyrics and the melody, uniting herself with the song. Although some of her material was peripherally connected to girl singers who chose to present themselves as Twenties Lolitas (little girls lispiing through the lyrics), Barbara is serious when her material is, riotous when the song calls for it.\n\nIn October 2004, I was in the audience for a late-night jam session at the Cajun, where Barbara, at someone’s request, got up and sang a touching FOOLS RUSH IN. Later, I introduced myself to her as the Phantom Reviewer, and was delighted by her genuineness. She and Kevin Dorn are close friends, so I began to see Barbara sing more often in a variety of places — from an Episcopal church in Hicksville, New York to an uptown club whose name I forget to the now-eradicated Jacques-Imo’s.\n\nAll of this is prelude to what the Beloved and I enjoyed last night: Barbara and her New Yorkers appearing at Iridium for two sets — an engagement I hope will be repeated soon and often. She always surrounds herself with the best musicians, and the band last night was choice: Kevin on drums, Conal Fowkes on piano, Doug Largent on bass, Michael Hashim on alto and tenor, Matt Szemela on violin, and Jon-Erik Kellso on trumpet.\n\nThe lovely thing about Barbara’s Iridium gig was that the room was packed with quietly appreciative people, many of whom knew each other, so it was like a reunion — or a party in someone’s large living room. The Beloved and I sat at a table with the cheerful Joe and Carla Samolduski, the people responsible for Barbara’s appearances at “Cabaret Night” at the Hicksville church. All that was missing was the basket of potato chips in front of us.\n\nThe music began with a positively rambunctious THERE’LL BE SOME CHANGES MADE. When the gleeful dust had settled, Barbara chatted with the audience about her song choices. She believes in what she sings: GET OUT AND GET UNDER THE MOON is not just a series of words for her. Matt Szemela added his sweet countrified violin to the ensemble, a wonderful bonus. Acknowledging her debt to Annette Hanshaw, Barbara began a deeply serious (although rhythmically mobile) version of AM I BLUE. Jon-Erik growled ominously behind her, and Michael Hashim explored the low register of his horn, reminding me of Ben Webster at his Fifties best. The mood brightened dramatically when Barbara offered a chipper rendition of LOVABLE AND SWEET, composed by Oscar Levant, rhyming “nice man” and “iceman” for naughty reasons. DEEP NIGHT, which Barbara dedicated to her late father, who loved the song, was a sultry tango. Barbara is a gracious and generous leader, so she gave the band a chance to romp on I WONDER WHERE MY BABY IS TONIGHT, which featured a patented Hashim stop-time chorus and two jammed ensemble choruses, the first quiet, the second shouting. A delicate IT WAS ONLY A SUN SHOWER followed; during Michael’s solo, Barbara sat on the piano bench next to Conal, her eyes closed, rocking happily to the beat. A brisk IT HAD TO BE YOU came next: Barbara sang the familiar lyrics as if the song was new, and Conal provided a rocking minimalist solo (Basie without the cliches), supported in high style by Doug and Kevin.\n\nReaders familiar with this blog might be asking themselves, “Where was Flip all this time?” “Struggling to get out of my pocket,” would be the answer. Flip was thrilled to be at Iridium (it was his first time) and he wanted to get close to the stage, but I kept on trying to quiet him down. People had the audacity to be sitting in front of us and their heads were in the way; Flip wriggled and jumped so vigorously that I thought the waitstaff were going to ask us to leave.\n\nWhen it was clear that Barbara’s set was more than half over, I took Flip out of my pocket and aimed him at the stage — thinking that the Iridium staff would hardly eject us so close to the end. (I was right.) The result is that you are now able to see and hear some of what Barbara and her New Yorkers did so beautifully last night.\n\nHere’s Irving Berlin’s melancholy SAY IT ISN’T SO, a fully realized dramatic performance without a hint of “acting”:\n\nBarbara featured the band on AIN’T MISBEHAVIN’, which offers wonderful hot solos and ensemble joys. I especially love the trades between Doug and Kevin at the end, reminiscent of the playful jazz conversations Milt Hinton and Jo Jones had so memorably:\n\nAnd something even more special: Barbara’s ukulele feature. Faithful readers will know of my recent (and continuing) ukulele obsession — I’m still finding my way around the fingerboard. But I was thrilled when Barbara unsheathed a soprano ukulele and put on her own one-woman show. It’s not that she’s the East Coast version of Lyle Ritz (or at least not yet) but she encapsulates another world in her performance of KEEPIN’ OUT OF MISCHIEF NOW — as if we were sitting on the porch with her and she decided it was time for a little music. It’s charming! And her whistling is both casual and accomplished:\n\nFinally, a rocking version of MY BLACKBIRDS ARE BLUEBIRDS NOW — one of several songs that exploited this avian metaphor. I feel sorry for the poor blackbirds, who got a bad reputation as emblems of bad luck. All because of that one flying terrorist who pecked off the housemaid’s nose, if I remember correctly? Bluebirds are fine, of course — but the blackbirds swung. Here’s Barbara and her New Yorkers:\n\nBarbara says that she is trying to keep this music alive without turning into the guardian of a time capsule. That’s a tall order, but she is doing it heroically every time she sings, and she did it splendidly last night. I hope these homegrown video clips convey something of her special gifts. She is The Real Thing."
