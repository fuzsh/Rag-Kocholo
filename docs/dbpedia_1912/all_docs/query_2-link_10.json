        "text": "Student athletes who have advanced to the NJSIAA Meet of Champions are once again facing tough choices about participating in the meet due to conflicts. This has stirred up another round of discussion over the scheduling of the New Jersey state meet series.\n\nFor the second year in a row, coaches across the state have expressed their frustration and disappointment with the scheduling of the Meet of Champions, which was compounded by the meet being postponed from Wednesday to Thursday. The event starts at the same time, 2:00pm, and place, Franklin High School in Somerset, NJ.\n\nThe postponement, which occurred due to the threat of lightning and severe weather, means MOCs is now overlapping with the opening days of both the New Balance Nationals Outdoors in Philadelphia and the Nike Outdoor Nationals in Oregon. On top of that, the Brooks PR Invitational in Washington was today.\n\nThis scenario has caused many coaches and athletes to scramble while changing their event, travel, prom and gradation plans, as well as make very difficult and emotional choices between competing at MOCs or a national meet and or attending proms and graduations.\n\nExample of Top Stars Adjusting Travel\n\nA perfect example of having to scramble to change plans involves seniors Brian Boler of Delbarton School and Megan Donlevie of Shore Regional HS.\n\nBoler and Donlevie, two of the best distance runners in the state, both planned to race at the Meet of Champions on Wednesday and fly out on Thursday to run at Nike Nationals Outdoor.\n\nWhile they could have kept their travel plans the same if they skipped the MOCs, they didn't want to miss their last chance to run at the top level of the state championship series. They called an audible and scrambled to find flights out on Friday so they could compete in both meets.\n\nThe whole scheduling issue, which was much worse last year, has once again sparked calls for change from coaches across the state.\n\nHow Did This Happen in the First Place?\n\nAfter years of the state sectional championships being held on Memorial Day weekend, the NJSIAA, citing a shortage of officials and additional site workers, pushed the sectionals back a week later in 2021. That resulted in the Meet of Champions being held on the third Saturday of June. That same schedule remained in place last season.\n\nLast year, the Meet of Champions was held on Saturday, June 18th. New Balance Nationals Outdoor and Nike Outdoor Nationals were scheduled for June 16th-19th, and the adidas Outdoor Nationals were June 17-19.\n\nAs a result, many of the state's biggest stars had to choose where to compete, and many opted to skip the Meet of Champions, which made what has always been the greatest event of the season very diluted.\n\nNJSIAA Will Discuss a Solution for the Conflict\n\nThe NJSIAA did make a change heading into 2023 to address the issue by moving the meet to a midweek date, originally scheduled for Wednesday, June 15th, before postponement. Making it a bit easier for athletes and coaches to navigate this part of the season.\n\nBut the track and field community feels more should have be done to completely solve the scheduling dilemma.\n\nAl Stumpf, the NJSIAA Track and Field Tournament Director, said he plans to do everything he can to avoid this from happening again.\n\n\"I will be discussing at the postseason track committee meeting the possibility of changing the sectional meet to the week before Memorial Day,'' said Stumpf. \"It was presented by River Dell AD Denis Nelson and his coach (Mike Urso) to the postseason committee last year.''\n\nStumpf added that any proposal would have to be fully vetted by the NJSIAA and the Program Review Committee before it became a reality.\n\nCoaches Weigh In\n\nSeveral coaches around the state weighed in with their thoughts on the MOCs postponement and how the scheduling conflict can be avoided in the future.\n\nSome also voiced their concern about the future of the prestigious Meet of Champions, which will celebrate its 54th year on Thursday.\n\nHere is what they had to to say.\n\nRiver Dell coach Mike Urso:\n\n\"I went with my AD to the post season meeting last year and voiced my complaints about having the state sectionals so late. I proposed moving the the meet back to Memorial Day weekend or the week earlier and have the state group meet return to the traditional first weekend in June. Then SMOC the following Wednesday or weekend. I believe we had a great setup prior to Covid and put on one of the best state meet series which concluded with SMOC, one of the best meets in the country every year attended by coaches from all over.\n\nNow we have a diluted meet that has lost a lot of luster. So disappointing.\n\nI am hopeful that the sectional meets will move to the weekend before Memorial Day and the Groups and SMOC move back to the traditional first and second weeks in June for many reasons, including nationals. Seven of our seniors aren't going to the Meet of Champions. They all have Prom tomorrow night.\n\nWhile conflict with nationals is a problem, I find it to conflict more with all the senior activities that are happening this week. Awards dinners, graduations, senior trips. Track athletes are usually some of the best kids in the school and should be forced to choose when it could so easily be remedied.''\n\nCherokee coach Mark Jarvis:\n\n\"Today's news was very disappointing. We had this week all mapped out for quite some time. Our biggest conflict is the 4xmile which is tomorrow night. I can't imagine schools that are now having to navigate graduations.\n\nI guess my biggest complaint was the fact that they called it so early. The weather looks like they could have just pushed the start of the meet back. This shouldn't be more than a 3 1/2 hour meet. Even go 4 hours, start at 5 and you are done by 9. That is about the same time the State Group meet finished. So now I have to decide between a seniors last chance to compete at Meet of Champions vs a relay that could be racing at Nationals.\n\nI realize there are a lot of unhappy coaches, athletes and parents, but it seems that the NJSIAA keeps putting themselves in bad positions. Take last week. It made no sense to me to make that a one day meet while they still had NJSIAA events happening on Friday. Again a knee jerk reaction to something.\n\nThere needs to be plans put in place in terms of the protocol of making decisions like this. Maybe there is maybe there isn't, but to the outside eye there doesn't appear to be. I have half of my girls in tears over this. Upperclassman wanted an opportunity to run an individual event at the meet of champions, and my underclassmen won an opportunity to run on a relay that has the potential of medaling. As I stated before, this is for all very unfortunate.''\n\nMiddletown North coach Brock Silvestri:\n\n\"Since the state meets were pushed back a week later on the calendar a few years ago, the list of issues and problems has grown more than ever. With these meets occurring during the last week of school for many student athletes, they are forced to have to make difficult decisions on graduations, proms, senior awards, final exams, and competing at Nationals. Many students and coaches are making difficult decisions over the last two weeks of school, missing out on school and family functions to compete and attend these meets.\n\nHaving it later in the year also creates less flexibility for changes or postponements. It was a difficult conversation to have with our team today about how to handle the meet being moved. My heart breaks for these kids making difficult decisions on what to do. We have 2 individuals and 2 relays that qualified for MOC.\n\nOnly our javelin thrower will attend, to throw his three throws and leave to make graduation on time, even if he makes finals.\n\nMy suggestion for the future is to move the state meets up a weekend, back to how it originally was, and keeping MOC during a weekday.\n\nI hope that with the current issues the last few years the state does not look to get rid of this meet, but rather come up with a solution.\"\n\nPrinceton coach Ben Samara:\n\n\"As I write this, the chances of thunderstorms are slightly increasing for later in the day, so, I understand the sentiment behind this decision. However, the decision came too late, especially for teams in the far north or south of the state.\n\nThe NJSIAA has once again put athletes in a position - this time with very late notice - to have to choose between the Meet of Champions and important life events (graduation, etc.) and the National meets. Was there consideration given to athletes who may have had flights or hotels booked or to those who had families flown in for graduations? Could a decision have been made a few days ago or yesterday, when we had very similar weather reporting?\n\nAgain, I understand wanting to avoid inclement weather, but these athletes are now being put, once again, in a no-win situation. Our squad will be missing several seniors, including some potential medalists, who will be attending their graduation. We fully support them in that decision.\n\nThe bottom line is that our state meets are not the top-quality HS showcases that you might see elsewhere or that they are touted to be. Due to the unpredictable nature of these meets and the ongoing potential for problems with sites, officials, management, timing, etc., I would encourage - and have have encouraged - athletes to choose the other activity when presented with these conflicts.\n\nWe did not attend the indoor state meets this year due to the state's negligence in getting the regs posted in a timely fashion before switching the dates back and forth multiple times. Just another example of these issues we see year after year.\n\nTo those who will be competing tomorrow, congratulations on qualifying and best of luck in your events! To those who will be choosing to forgo the Meet of Champions, do not regret your decision and do not look backwards! In my opinion, there's no wrong choice here from the athlete's perspective.''\n\nPennsauken coach Phil Zimmerman:\n\n\"There isn't anything that can be done about weather. Coaching at a school that hosts these big meets, I understand the logistics surrounding what to do with large crowds when there is inclement weather. I've been involved in those conversations. I think the bigger issue is the length of our season, and the scheduling of the state meets.\n\nI get that the officials didn't want to lose their Memorial Day weekend anymore, and can't say I blame them. So if that's the case, we need to have the Sectional meet the weekend before Memorial Day. Then, teams have 2 weeks off to prepare for Groups. We could then go back to a Saturday MOC, and still be a week away from the National meets.\n\nAdditionally, seniors wouldn't have to worry about missing out on their end-of-year events and obligations with a mid-week MOC, such as senior picnics and, more importantly, graduation.\n\nOf course, part of the timing of our outdoor season is because of how late our indoor season goes. It's a domino effect. But, Pennsylvania starts their outdoor track meets a week earlier than us, which allows them to get to their State meet earlier. So, it can be done.\n\nWith a meet this size there was no way to fit it in with any delay. I believe the right call was made because any delay would of made it more of a mess. The elephant in the room is that the season is too long and as all spring sports the season should of been completed 2 weeks ago. If we had any wiggle room none of these conflicts would matter. Unfortunately it is what it is and we are looking forward to a great meet tomorrow.''\n\nScotch Plains-Fanwood coach Jeff Koegel:\n\n\"I'm hoping that this can be avoided in the future. The simple solution is to have Sectionals and Groups earlier and then have MOC the Thursday or Friday the week before Nationals.\n\nThe current solution gets caught up with final exams, graduations, and nationals. It isn't fair to the kids, and this meet is supposed to be for them. It should be one of the biggest spectacles in high school sports.''\n\nHunterdon Central coach Jon DeLisle:\n\n\"I think one solution may be to compete Memorial Day weekend the way we used to so we can create a week of separation between groups and MOC.\n\nThe state's goal should be to maintain the integrity of the MOC. If the NJSIAA continues to schedule the MOC so close to the national meets, the most elite athletes are going to choose nationals because they consider it more prestigious--right or wrong. I am not a big advocate for nationals unless an athlete or relay is elite. Let's call these meets what they are for most people--a money grab by the shoe companies. Additionally, they are basically regional meets for people who can afford to attend them.\n\nThe MOC provides access to all of our state's best athletes, which is why it must be protected.''\n\nLakeland coach Damiano Conforti:\n\n\"With a meet this size there was no way to fit it in with any delay. I believe the right call was made because any delay would of made it more of a mess.\n\nThe elephant in the room is that the season is too long and as all spring sports, the season should have been completed two weeks ago. If we had any wiggle room, none of these conflicts would matter. Unfortunately, it is what it is and we are looking forward to a great meet tomorrow.''\n\nUnion Catholic coach Mike McCabe:\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the M of C and nationals conflict still exists. My hope is that sectionals can be the weekend before Memorial Day weekend. Groups the weekend after Memorial Day and MOC the Wednesday after Groups. That allows for 9-10 days between M of C and Nationals.\"\n\nHillsborough coach Rich Refi:\n\n\"I think sectionals should be the weekend before Memorial Day followed by Groups two weeks later, and then MOC the following Wednesday. If this happened a week ago, nobody would have a problem. Tough choice today. Raining pretty well here, six miles away from Franklin.''"
