        "text": "The precocious and prodigious drummer and composer Tony Williams had already joined the Miles Davis Quintet and participated in numerous landmark Blue Note recordings including Herbie Hancock Empyrean Isles, Eric Dolphy Out To Lunch, Andrew Hill Point Of Departure, Jackie McLean One Step Beyond, and Grachan Moncur III Evolution by the time he recorded his own adventurous debut album Life Time in August 1964, when he was still just 18 years old. Williams had no intention of playing it safe on his maiden voyage as a leader and set forth to document his uncompromising expression on this program of innovative original compositions.\n\nSide 1 presents the expansive two movement suite \"2 Pieces of One\" with the drummer joined by tenor saxophonist Sam Rivers and bassists Gary Peacock and Richard Davis. Side 2 opens with the jaunty \"Tomorrow Afternoon\" featuring Williams, Rivers, and Peacock. Williams plays a variety of percussion on the freely improvised \"Memory\" which features Herbie Hancock on piano and Bobby Hutcherson on vibraphone, and lays out entirely on the ruminative piano-bass duet \"Barb's Song to the Wizard\" performed by Hancock and Ron Carter which closes the album.\n\nBlue Note Classic Vinyl Reissue Series!\n\n180g Vinyl LP!\n\nMastered By Kevin Gray From Original Analog Tapes!\n\nPressed At Optimal!\n\nThe fourth volume of The Amazing Bud Powell series, recorded in 1958, found the brilliant bebop piano master in particularly fine form on an ebullient set of his original tunes including \"Buster Rides Again,\" \"Monopoly,\" and \"John's Abbey.\" Powell's inventive solo flights shine in a trio setting with Sam Jones on bass and \"Philly\" Joe Jones on drums.\n\nThis Blue Note Classic Vinyl Edition is all-analog, mastered by Kevin Gray from the original master tapes, and pressed on 180g vinyl at Optimal.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nBlue Note Classic Vinyl Reissue Series\n\n180g Vinyl LP\n\nAll-Analog Pressing\n\nMastered by Kevin Gray from Original Analog Tapes\n\nManufactured at Optimal in Germany\n\nTime Waits: The Amazing Bud Powell"
