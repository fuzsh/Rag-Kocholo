        "text": "Music Features\n\n1) An Interview with Nick Corasaniti, author of 'I Don't Want to Go Home: The Oral History of the Stone Pony' (published 2024-06-06) -- Nick Corasaniti's I Don't Want to Go Home: The Oral History of the Stone Pony was just published by Harper Books. It is a fascinating look at both the history of the Stone Pony and the rise, fall, and rebirth of Asbury Park itself. The book includes interviews with a staggering number of people including musicians, DJs, reporters, Stone Pony employees, music industry professionals, people involved with Asbury Park, and even a few governors. It also features some exclusive, never-before-seen photos from Danny Clinch.\n\n2) Alex Biese and Somewhat Relative Expand Their Jam Band World (published 2024-04-05) -- There are bands who think of themselves as a family and there are bands like Somewhat Relative who truly are a family. About a decade ago, Alex Biese joined forces with his father-in-law (Fred Matthews) and mother-in-law (Jen Yacovelli) and began taking their music from the kitchen table to the stage. The acoustic Americana jam band is based in Monmouth County, but is branching out with shows across the state.\n\n3) An Interview with Danny Coleman on radio, writing, music and more! (published 2024-02-27) -- In the last twenty years, I don't think I've met anyone as dedicated to the local music scene as Danny Coleman. He’s a writer, a DJ, an emcee for events, and a musician himself. Most of all, he is consistent. He’s doing these things week after week after week. I have seen a lot of people come and go in the local music scene over the years, but Danny just keeps plugging away and his radio show will celebrate its 15th anniversary with a big bash on April 28th.\n\n4) Kat Falcey: 25 Years of Promoting Music (published 2023-12-17) -- Some of the hardest working people in the music industry are those who work behind the scenes. Booking, promoting, and managing artists can often be a thankless job and few have what it takes to keep going year after year, but Kat Falcey of Tunes2ya is one of the good ones. She’s been at this for over 25 years now - a truly remarkable run. To say the industry has gone through a ton of changes during this period is an understatement. I caught up with Kat to talk about her career.\n\n5) Chris Batten and the Woods release \"Live From The Bowery Ballroom, NYC\" (published 2023-11-22) -- \"The Woods may be going away for a little bit, but it ain't over and we'll see you soon.\" Those were the parting words from an interview with Chris Batten in October 2009, just before Chris Batten & The Woods were about to play their final show at Maxwell's in Hoboken. True to his word, the band did indeed return - albeit over a decade later - with new music, celebrated by a concert at the Bowery Ballroom that led to a 4 song live EP released on November 22, 2023.\n\n6) DW Dunphy Talks About Orbis Max (published 2023-09-28) -- DW Dunphy is a musician, writer, and artist from Monmouth County who has been taking part in a rather unique songwriting project called Orbis Max. It involves songwriters and musicians from around the world who put tracks together via the Internet. We reached out to him to learn more.\n\n7) Endo Warrior Benefit Preview: An Interview with Jake Thistle (published 2023-09-03) -- (ASBURY PARK, NJ) -- New Jersey artists Jake Thistle and Chris Fritz will be joined by Swedish singer-songwriter Alexandra Jardvall for the Endo Warrior Benefit Show at Asbury Lanes on Sunday, September 10, 2023. The benefit is presented by Spring-Nuts and will raise awareness and funds for Endometriosis Research and the Endometriosis Foundation of America.\n\n8) Endo Warrior Benefit Preview: An Interview with Howie Chaz, Founder of Spring-Nuts (published 2023-09-03) -- (ASBURY PARK, NJ) -- In 2015, Howie Chaz launched Spring-Nuts with about 500 fellow die-hard fans of Bruce Springsteen. The group now has over 60,000 members around the world! In addition to enjoying concerts together, Spring-Nuts follows Springsteen's lead and helps raise money for charities through benefit shows. Their next one is the Endo Warrior Benefit Show, which takes place at Asbury Lanes on Sunday, September 10, 2023.\n\n9) Endo Warrior Benefit Preview: An Interview with Chris Fritz (published 2023-09-03) -- (ASBURY PARK, NJ) -- New Jersey artists Chris Fritz and Jake Thistle will be joined by Swedish singer-songwriter Alexandra Jardvall for the Endo Warrior Benefit Show at Asbury Lanes on Sunday, September 10, 2023. The benefit is presented by Spring-Nuts and will raise awareness and funds for Endometriosis Research and the Endometriosis Foundation of America.\n\n10) Wiser Time Talks About \"Hanging Around\" and Upcoming EP (published 2023-06-25) -- Wiser Time recently released \"Hanging Around\" - the first single from an EP expected to be released in November 2023. The song features the unmistakeable vocals and guitar style of Carmen Sclafani, who founded the band over twenty years ago.\n\n11) \"sixtyandthensome\" - Bruce Tunkel Faces His Demons and Creates a Masterpiece (published 2023-05-12) -- Sometimes an album is released at just the right time for you... The lyrics sound as if the singer is singing to you or about you and the music reminds you that you are not alone; others are in the exact same place. Sometimes it’s an area we don’t like talking about like depression, but thankfully Bruce Tunkel goes there on his latest release, sixtyandthensome - a brilliant masterpiece from one of Jersey’s best songwriters.\n\n12) James Deely Talks About \"This Train Is Running Out of Track\" (published 2023-02-11) -- In February, James Deely released his 8th studio album, \"This Train Is Running Out of Track\". The former South Jersey artist may have moved to the West Coast years ago, but he's got his Jersey Shore musician friends on this album and hearing these tunes kind of feels like he never left. In fact, a few of these songs would undoubtably find their way on to a Deely greatest hits collection. It's always good to catch up with him, so we reached out to learn more about the latest record.\n\n13) James Dalton talks about \"Asbury Park & Me\" (published 2023-01-30) -- James Dalton is an Ocean County-based artist who has described himself as \"of the scene, but not part of it\", but anyone who has performed with as many artists in as many local venues as James is most certainly part of the scene. He created a show called \"Asbury Park & Me\" last year for the Brighton Fringe Festival and is bringing it to venues in New Jersey. James has performed around the world and wherever he goes the Garden State is always with him, whether in his lyrics or stories he tells on stage. NJ Stage caught up with him to learn more about his plans for the show.\n\n14) An Interview with Jim Mill (published 2023-01-20) -- Singer-songwriter Jim Mill is best known for his aggressive acoustic rock and Eddie Vedder-like vocals. His latest single, \"Never Meant To Be,\" is something of a surprise. It moves from the blistering, grunge-like sound he's known for in favor of a more 80s alt-rock feel. New Jersey Stage reached out to Jim to learn more about the song and where he's at musically after leaving Wynward last year.\n\n15) Catching Up With Ronnie Brandt (published 2022-12-30) -- Ronnie Brandt is an Americana artist from the Jersey Shore who founded Childrens Educational Assemblies, an organization that lets him perform music and teach children about musical greats like Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie. He's famous for wearing a cowboy hat, but his roots in the Asbury Park scene go back further than most people realize. In this interview, we catch up with the Jersey Shore cowboy.\n\n16) Matt O'Ree Band returns with \"Hand In Glove\" (published 2022-10-25) -- The Matt O'Ree Band is back with Hand In Glove, set for release on November 3rd. In my opinion, it is by far the band’s most musically ambitious and solid release to date. It is also the best to utilize the talents of Eryn O’Ree on lead vocals. The way the album switches back and forth from Matt on lead vocals to Eryn gives the album a special quality. This is the band's first studio album since Brotherhood in 2016.\n\n17) Jon Caspi Talks About New Version of \"Raise 'Em High\", New Beer, and New Label (published 2022-09-23) -- On September 23, 2022, New Jersey punk/americana rock outfit Jon Caspi & The First Gun shared a new version of their fan favorite barroom sing-along song, “Raise ‘Em High!”, featuring Jesse Malin on vocals, and Dez Cadena (known from Black Flag and The Misfits) on guitar. The band also announced a new EP titled, Raise 'Em High! and other delights, which will feature the new version of the song. It will be released on October 14 via Fake Chapter Records. The single will also be coming out as a 7\" in March, 2023.\n\n18) Interview with Walter Trout (published 2022-09-12) -- The New Jersey Hall of Fame is full of legendary musicians from Count Basie to Bruce Springsteen, but there’s one name that’s missing - Walter Trout. He’s a guy who was born in Jersey and lived the first 23 years of his life here. He learned how to play the guitar and fell in love with the blues while living in the Garden State. His guitar has taken him around the world, but he still writes songs about his old hometown.\n\n19) 2022 Morristown Jazz & Blues Festival a Stellar Mix (published 2022-09-08) -- The sounds of jazz and blues will float across the Morristown Green once again when the Morristown Jazz & Blues Festival takes place Saturday, Sept. 17. The festival is free to attend and this year’s lineup includes a stellar mix of swing, big band, and group jazz with a pair of blues artists — one an up-and-coming star and the other a Jersey legend.\n\n20) Kat Falcey Talks About JerseyCana (published 2022-09-03) -- Kat Falcey is one of those die-hard music fans who often wind up working in the music industry. Her company, Tunes2Ya, helps artists with networking, promotion, public relations, booking referrals, and more. She's returning to AmericanaFest in Nashville for the first time since the pandemic hit and has three of her New Jersey artists (Arlan Feiles, Mike Montrey, and Carmen Sclafani) booked for a show at The Basement on Tuesday, September 13th at 8:00pm.\n\n21) Bob Burger returns with the wonderful “The Domino Effect” (published 2022-07-29) -- \"I thought I was going to have to quit,\" recalled Bob Burger. \"Because it was too painful to play.\"\n\n22) A Tribute To David Kosciolek (published 2022-06-14) -- There are a handful of people who have made a mark in the local music scene and David Kosciolek was one of them. He opened Indigo Coffeehouse in 2003 and it quickly became host to not only live music, but a music scene literally created by the venue itself. Nearly two decades later, it’s amazing how many musicians and music fans still recall those days fondly. At the beginning of June, that community was shocked to learn that David had died from a heart attack on May 16th. Many got together to play an \"Indigo Reunion\" after the coffeehouse closed and several pay tribute to him in this article.\n\n23) Catching Up with Mick Chorba of The Successful Failures (published 2022-05-25) -- The Successful Failures formed in 2005 as a side project for Mick Chorba from the Dipsomaniacs - a garage rock band who put out many great albums during their two decade run and was one of my favorite Jersey bands. It’s amazing to think about it, but The Successful Failures have actually outlasted the Dipsos. Looking at the band’s history, they were bound to succeed...\n\n24) Catching up with Danny White (published 2022-05-01) -- Danny White is a name you may not have heard of much lately. The singer-songwriter opened Beach Music Studios 18 years ago and has primarily been involved with the business and raising a family, but he’s just released Belmar, NJ - his first album of new music in nearly a decade.\n\n25) Eighth Blackbird, an Award-Winning Ensemble, to Perform With Rowan University Wind Ensemble (published 2022-04-21) -- It’s not often that college students get to perform on stage with an award-winning sextet, but the members of Rowan University’s Wind Ensemble are getting that opportunity. They will be performing with Eighth Blackbird, a four-time Grammy winner for Best Small Ensemble/Chamber Music Performance, on Friday, April 29, 2022 at 8:00 pm in Rowan’s Pfleeger Concert Hall.\n\n26) Catching up with James Dalton: Talking Brighton Fringe and Memphis (published 2022-04-08) -- James Dalton is a performer, a storyteller, and a musician. He's someone who has managed to perform around the world based solely on talent and ambition. James was featured several times in my old Upstage Magazine and is still very much active today. In fact, he's about to compete for the third time in the International Blues Challenge in Memphis and will debut his new show, \"Asbury Park & Me,\" at the Brighton Fringe festival a few weeks later.\n\n27) Catching Up With Keith Monacchio: An interview about \"Under A Nightlight Sky\" (published 2022-03-22) -- Keith Monacchio has been one of my favorite artists from New Jersey for a long time. His career started with the Semi-Beings and then The Commons (who put out some of the best records of the era, in my opinion). He released his 5th solo record, Under A Nightlight Sky on March 22, 2022. The record explores themes of family, fatherhood, political tribalism, aging, and a hope for a better future in these very uncertain times. 2022 marks the 30th year of Keith's musical journey, which makes him the ideal subject for a new series that takes a look at artists who were part of my old Upstage Magazine days and still very much active today.\n\n28) An Interview With Gerry Rosenthal (published 2022-01-06) -- Gerry Rosenthal is an example of a hard working musician. The singer-songwriter / guitarist from Highland Park plays in multiple bands (an original rock band, Beatles tribute, wedding band, and his own Gerry Rosenthal Trio) and guests with other artists. He released a new EP on January 1, 2022. In addition to music, he's had an acting career that includes roles in Finding Forrester, \"Law & Order\", and was the star of a video game called \"Bully\", which still has a huge fanbase 15 years after its release.\n\n29) Spotlight On Christmas Tunes From Jersey Artists Released In The Last 2-3 Years (published 2021-12-24) -- Last year, I put together a mixtape of 85 holiday songs by New Jersey artists. It was a collection of nearly 5 hours of music from indie artists to some of the biggest stars to ever come from the Garden State. It's nice if you're looking for something to play in the background as you'll get great originals and cover tunes. I'm not doing a new show this year, but wanted to point out some of the holiday songs released in the last year or two. These are by no means all of the holiday tracks released by Jersey artists, but a nice sampling of originals and covers.\n\n30) Renee Maskin Talks About Her First Official Solo Record and Future Plans (published 2021-11-12) -- Renee Maskin has been a big part of the Asbury Park music scene for many years as both a solo performer and lead singer and guitarist of Lowlight. Her first official solo release is \"When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings\" - a song written by Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs - a 2018 film written, directed, and produced by the Coen brothers. Her version appears on the new Mint 400 Records compilation \"At The Movies II.\"\n\n31) Renegades: Obama and Springsteen Wrestling With Ghosts (published 2021-10-30) -- RENEGADES: Born in the USA chronicles the conversations Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen began in Spotify’s co-produced podcast of the same name. During these intimate conversations, they share exclusive stories and ruminations about life, music, and their enduring love of America, with all its challenges and contradictions.\n\n32) Renegades: Born In the USA - How Race Helped Define Springsteen and Obama (published 2021-10-27) -- Ever since he was pictured on the cover of both Time and Newsweek magazines in the same week in 1975, the world has known Bruce Springsteen was something special. But there’s still something awe-inspiring about a guy from Freehold being part of a project with a former President of the United States.\n\n33) An Interview With Bob Malone Who Comes To UCPAC On September 30th (published 2021-09-22) -- Jersey native Bob Malone has been touring the world for over two decades as both a solo artist and a member of John Fogerty's band for the past decade. He's done session work for artists like Bob Seger and Avril Lavigne, was featured on the 2017 Ringo Starr record Give More Love, and his recording of \"You’re A Mean One, Mr. Grinch\" was the theme in the Illumination/ Universal movie trailers for \"The Grinch\", heard by millions.\n\n34) Yee-haw! REV Theatre's \"Honky Tonkin'\" Hootenanny in Cape May (published 2021-07-31) -- “Yee-haw! Pounds of sequins, yards of fringe, and really big hair! This lil’ ol’ shindig puts the hoot in hootenanny and the jam in jamboree,” exclaimed Rudy Caporaso, Co-Artistic Director & Founder of REV Theatre Company.\n\n35) Bob Burger Talks About His Heart Attack, Recovery, And Return To The Stage (published 2021-07-25) -- Bob Burger has been a part of the Jersey Shore music scene since the eighties when he moved here from Erie, Pennsylvania. He's been a member of the Bobby Bandiera Band, a solo artist, performer in Beatle tributes, and is currently a member of The Weeklings with Glen Burtnik - an artist he's written songs with for decades. On June 5th, he was just finishing a show at The Vogel in Red Bank when he had a heart attack in the dressing room.\n\n36) Marc Ribler Talks About His New Record, The Pandemic, and Little Steven (published 2021-07-09) -- “It’s kind of a magical experience, you never know what the Muse has in store for the day,” explained singer-songwriter Marc Ribler. “Some songs just feel like absolute gifts. It’s almost like the words and melody are delivered.”\n\n37) Brett Altman Releases \"Waiting\" (published 2021-05-14) -- Hoboken based singer-songwriter Brett Altman released \"Waiting\" on Friday, May 14th. This is the latest single from his upcoming album, Not Quite Love. \"Waiting\" is about overcoming the fear of rejection in order to tell someone how you truly feel.\n\n38) The Wag At Bar A: Our First Show In A Long, Long Time (published 2021-05-10) -- I’ll admit we were nervous. It was our first time being to a live event in a long time. I had been in isolation even before the pandemic due to a medical treatment and it was only one week after getting our second covid vaccine shot, but it was time.\n\n39) Anthony Walker Talks About His Return To Music & More (published 2021-04-09) -- In 2008, a solid bunch of demo songs led to When Strangers Say Hello, the full length debut of Anthony Walker, a roots artist from New Brunswick. That album included wonderful tracks like \"Darlene\", \"The Year of the Flood\", and \"Lucky Numbers\" - the first two showcasing a lyrical ability far beyond his years, the latter hinting at the full band sound to come. A three-track EP was released in 2010, followed by This City Won't Sleep - another full-length which came out a year a later.\n\n40) Taylor Tote On \"21 Min Drive\" (published 2021-04-06) -- In late March, Taylor Tote released an EP called \"21 Min Drive\" - a collection of contemporary songs unlike any of Tote’s past work.

This is a record I’ve never heard of before. As a fan of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, along with their work in The Byrds & The Hollies, I was interested to see what Graham Nash and David Crosby would sound like on this album.\n\n43) The Postal Project: \"Teaser and the Firecat\" by Cat Stevens (published 2021-03-01) -- A few years ago, my long-time postal worker retired. Knowing that I wrote about music and had an online radio station, he surprised me one day by giving me a few hundred albums from his vinyl collection. It was a mix of releases from the late sixties, seventies, and early eighties - generally classic rock and folk music. After Hurricane Sandy he was downsizing and I was one to benefit.\n\n44) Dave Vargo and Sahara Moon To Take Part In First \"Not Quite Nashville\" Song Swap On Saturday, January 30 (published 2021-01-28) -- Dave Vargo has been running a weekly show online called 2forTuesday for most of the last year.

He's logged over 1500 shows with performances by the Michael Patrick Band, The Suburban Hillbillies, and his Johnny Cash tribute band - Ring of Fire. Inspired by the more traditional folk, country, rockabilly, roots and rock sounds & writing of such artists as Lyle Lovett, Hank Williams, John Prine, and the Man in Black himself, Michael Patrick has developed an appreciation of simplistic story-telling lyrics, catchy hooks and memorable melodies.\n\n46) Taylor Tote Releases \"Quarter-Life Crisis\" As Part Of Telegraph Hill Records Vol. 3 (published 2021-01-04) -- The latest song by Taylor Tote was released on Christmas Day as part of the Telegraph Hill Records Vol. 3 playlist.

Even a deadly pandemic couldn’t stop protests around the world from making George Floyd and Breonna Taylor household names, while growing a movement centered on social justice.

Around the music world some people know him as a member of Styx, some for his popular tribute shows (Summer of Love, Beatles, etc.), and some for his current band - The Weeklings; but before any of those became part of his resume, he was known for his original songs like \"Here Comes Sally\" and \"Follow You.\"\n\n56) Get Happy at MPAC with the Return of Live Music (published 2020-10-01) -- It’s been a year of reinvention for the arts world ever since the pandemic hit.

I say music world because although Joe Incagnoli (better known as Joe Harvard) had become an Asbury Park legend when he moved to the city in 2001, he was already a legend in Boston, and one who played a major role in the career of many bands who went on to become household names.\n\n93) Women Who Rock! An Interview With Meredith Ochs (published 2019-03-25) -- “Rock and roll is built of fierce women,” writes Meredith Ochs in the introduction to her fascinating book, Rock-and-Roll Woman: The 50 Fiercest Female Rockers. “Blues, jazz, R&B, and country artists who laid its groundwork. Girl groups who projected a flashy, united front. Counterculture singers who protested the establishment. Punk rockers who democratized music-making. Riot grrrls who politicized it. And so many more.

A Kipling Passion.”\n\n125) The Cryptkeeper Five (published 2017-10-23) -- One of the most unsung bands in the New Jersey music scene for decades has been The Cryptkeeper Five (CK5) from Trenton. They’ve been banging out their unique style of punk rock since 1997. Punk that includes a wide range of influences from Roy Orbison to the Misfits to Bruce Springsteen. In a way, they’re like the Ramones with a Jersey twist.\n\n126) The Story Of The Man Who Shaped The Beatles (published 2017-10-23) -- You might think that every angle of The Beatles story has been covered by now, but one very significant piece was largely left untouched - the story of George Martin, the producer who helped shape and mold the music which defined one of the greatest bands in history. Martin penned three autobiographies, but acclaimed author Kenneth Womack has stepped in to tell the rest of the story.\n\n127) A Different Take On Springsteen On Broadway (published 2017-10-13) -- ​​​​​​​Press reviews are pouring in for Springsteen on Broadway this week and, while the critics love the show, many fans are still upset at the ticket costs which started out at hundreds of dollars more expensive than his regular tour tickets. Die-hard fans who often attended multiple shows on each tour are struggling with the idea of being able to see just one performance or none at all. Rich Lynch, a writer/musician from New Jersey who now lives in Nashville, was so incensed by the comments he saw from Bruce fans that he actually wrote and recorded a \"protest\" song in their honor.\n\n128) The Pair Of Asbury Angels Who Directly Changed My Life (published 2017-10-02) -- (OCTOBER 2, 2017) — I woke up this morning to the news about the devastating Las Vegas shooting and later heard of Tom Petty in the fight for his life. After weeks of natural disasters and death, I want to end this day with something positive. So I’m going to report on a pair of Asbury Angels who helped me become who I am today. I rarely write pieces that involve me, but I'm trying to make sense of today and I think this might help.\n\n129) The inner struggles of Deirdre Forrest (published 2017-09-22) -- Deirdre Forrest has been performing for nearly a decade throughout the tri-state area. She grew up in South Amboy and is best known for her work with the bands Beannacht and May Darlings along with her solo career. You could say she’s a modern day artist - one raised on social media to the point where her life is truly an open book.\n\n130) New Brunswick Gets Ready To Rock Again (published 2017-09-02) -- When people talk about great rock ‘n’ roll scenes in New Jersey, two areas generally come to mind: Asbury Park and New Brunswick. The former spawned some of the biggest and most recognizable names in the state’s history, while the latter launched the careers of more national acts than any other place in the Garden State.\n\n131) On stage with Iain Matthews (published 2017-08-21) -- Iain Matthews first gained attention in the late 1960s as a founding member and vocalist for the influential British folk band Fairport Convention on their first three albums. He went on to create Matthews’ Southern Comfort, whose cover of Joni Mitchell’s “Woodstock” topped the charts in the UK in 1971. In addition to a lengthy solo career, he’s also released several albums with Plainsong. In a strange twist, he has brought back both Matthews’ Southern Comfort and Plainsong at various times throughout the years.\n\n132) Rick Barry Wins Another Songwriting Award He Doesn't Want To Talk About (published 2017-08-09) -- Some artists give the impression they are shooting to win awards; others act like they couldn't give a damn about them. Rick Barry is definitely the latter, which is funny because he continues to win them. He's won everything from Asbury Music Awards to earning national recognition with wins in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest and the Unisong International Songwriting Contest. Earlier this year, he added another to the list - the Akademia Award for \"So Soft, So Sweet\" which was named Best Americana Song.\n\n133) NJ Artist Brian Clayton Has Song Placed In \"The Big Sick\" motion picture (published 2017-07-31) -- Garwood native singer/songwriter Brian Clayton had his song \"She Let Me Go\" placed in the feature film The Big Sick, a romantic comedy about how a new couple deals with their cultural differences as their relationship grows. Directed by Michael Showalter and produced by Judd Apatow, Barry Mendel, the film stars Kumail Nanjiani, Zoe Kazan, Ray Romano, and Holly Hunter.\n\n134) An Interview with DJ Lee Mrowicki of Radio Jersey (published 2017-07-23) -- Radio Jersey is the flagship program of AsburyMusic.com, broadcasting every day Monday through Friday from 6:00pm to 8:00pm. Hosted by Lee Mrowicki, the long-time DJ at Asbury Park clubs like The Stone Pony and the Wonder Bar, the show puts the spotlight on the Garden State like never before. Mrowicki doesn’t just focus on one genre of music, he spins music by New Jersey artists of every genre - including songs you won’t find anywhere else. You’ll quickly realize just how amazing the state’s musical history once you tune in.\n\n135) Peter Prasa: Poets & Heroes (published 2017-07-23) -- What do you do when your music doesn�t quite fit into any particular genre? In an industry that lives on nicely packaged descriptions like rock, jazz, and country, what happens when your music is all three?\n\n136) A Special Night With Constantine Maroulis (published 2017-07-05) -- “For the first time in many years, I feel like I have something to say as a writer,” said Constantine Maroulis, the Tony-nominated actor and rock ’n’ roll star. “I’m 41 years old now and I think it’s starting to click.”\n\n137) Postmodern Jukebox (published 2017-06-22) -- “A song can be detached from its genre pretty easily,” explains pianist and bandleader Scott Bradlee, the man behind Postmodern Jukebox, a band that gives modern songs a retro twist. “I think we’re used to hearing songs covered in a certain style because the original artist did it that way. I decided to take the opposite approach and do it completely different. You find that a great song can transcend genre.”\n\n138) An Interview With Dw. Dunphy about The Co-Op Communique (published 2017-06-07) -- The Co-Op Communique distributes music from independent artists seeking to share their artistic output with an enthusiastic audience. The latest release, The Co​-​Op Communique Volume Three, went live on May 26, 2017. It contains songs by 35 different independent artists and is available for free. New Jersey Stage spoke with Executive Producer, Dw. Dunphy about the release and the artist series.\n\n139) Matthew Stephen and the Sweet Action Release Video For \"Grooving To The Beat\" (published 2017-05-22) -- Matthew Stephen and the Sweet Action might be a new name for you, but fans of Airacuda will instantly recognize the voice. Matthew Stephen Menges began his solo project in April 2016 when Airacuda went on an indefinite hiatus. He was the frontman for the band with major writing credits on both of the band's EPs, including full credit on their singles 'Pals' and 'I Got A Woman'. He has just released the video for his new single, \"Grooving to the Beat.\" The video was shot by Nelson Wong of Something Something Productions. Makeup by Jamie Leigh Artistry, with Matthew starring as the old man.\n\n140) Company of Wolves (published 2017-05-22) -- Company of Wolves was a popular rock and roll band in the early 90s in the tri-state area. They made some noise nationally with a self-titled record on Mercury/Polygram that included “Call of the Wild”, “The Distance”, and “Hangin’ By a Thread” - all of which charted on AOR (album-oriented rock) stations. The band just released its first single in 20 years and is playing a reunion show on June 3 at Club 66 in Edgewood, MD.\n\n141) Music, Dance and Collaboration Brings “Carmina Burana” to Life in Princeton (published 2017-05-16) -- When Carl Orff first conceived “Carmina Burana,” he pictured it as a “scenic cantata” with music and dance working together to create a truly beautiful experience. That combination will be on display at Princeton University’s Richardson Auditorium on May 21st when three Garden State-based arts organizations—Princeton Pro Musica, Princeton Girlchoir and Roxey Ballet—team up for a performance.\n\n142) BobFest: Songs of War & Peace (published 2017-04-24) -- Ever since 1997, Pat Guadagno has been celebrating Bob Dylan’s birthday in a grand way with BobFest. The show returns to the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank on May 25 with this year’s theme: Songs Of War & Peace. In honor of the holiday, Jersey Mike’s is providing tickets for any veterans who wish to see the show.\n\n143) Catching Up With Victoria Williams (published 2017-04-24) -- For many music fans in the 90s, Victoria Williams was their introduction to Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The Louisiana born Williams was a rising star in the indie world, touring as the opening act for Neil Young when she first began having neurological problems. Faced with a sudden bout of medical bills and without health insurance, 14 artists including Pearl Jam, Soul Asylum, Lou Reed, and The Waterboys covered songs written by Williams on a tribute album entitled “Sweet Relief: A Benefit For Victoria Williams.” The album did so well that it led to the creation of the Sweet Relief Musicians Fund, an organization that aids musicians with their medical bills.\n\n144) A look at female artists and the Artists who inspired them (part 2) (published 2017-04-15) -- For the third issue of 2017, New Jersey Stage featured an interview with Ann Wilson of Heart as the cover story. Thinking back to the classic rock songs from Heart got us wondering who were the female artists that inspired artists in the area. We spoke with 11 artists. In this piece we talk with Reagan Richards (from Williams Honor) Eryn Shewell, Meagan Brothers, Sofia Khorosh (SØF), and Alicia Van Sant (from The Wag). This is part one of two features.\n\n145) A look at female artists and the Artists who inspired them (part 1) (published 2017-04-15) -- For the third issue of 2017, New Jersey Stage featured an interview with Ann Wilson of Heart as the cover story. Thinking back to the classic rock songs from Heart got us wondering who were the female artists that inspired artists in the area. We spoke with 11 artists. In this piece we talk with Karen Mansfield, Amy Schindler (from ViRAGO), Tara Elliott, Jody Joseph, and Catherine Wacha. This is part one of two features. Click here for the second part.\n\n146) Makin Waves Comes to NJ Stage (published 2017-03-06) -- When Upstage Magazine was first launched in 2003, I wanted the publication to quickly gain credibility in the arts & entertainment world. I had a short list of music writers I wanted on board that included Bob Makin and Chris Barry. Both were in our first issue and helped us make an instant splash in the local music scene.\n\n147) Ellis Paul: 25 Years On The Road (published 2017-02-23) -- It’s never been easy to carve out a career in the music business and it may be more difficult now than ever. Despite a plethora of websites to let people discover artists, music fans are largely on their own. MTV gave up on music videos long ago, the power of radio has been greatly diminished, and even publications like Rolling Stone are arguably read more for their political writing today as much as their profiles on artists. With that in mind, it’s remarkable when artists like Ellis Paul can simultaneously build a devoted fan base throughout the country and remain under the radar for 25 years.\n\n148) #50 Brian Molnar: Brian Molnar (published 2017-01-26) -- Before he added The Naked Hearts as his backing band, Brian Molnar performed as a solo artist. On his self-titled debut, he shows a more folk-based style than the Americana/Alt-Country genre that his newer work with the full band possesses. Both styles seem to suit Brian well, and it’s fascinating to look back and see how the different musical directions changed his songs.\n\n149) #49 Echo Screen: An American Tale (published 2017-01-26) -- Echo Screen’s debut An American Tale begins with “The Things We’ve Left Behind,” a brief instrumental that sets a rather somber setting. It sort of reminds me of the cartoon character Schroeder from Peanuts tapping away at his little piano while watching bombs fall during World War III. The song then ends with a loud bang and bursts into “An American Tale,” a blistering pop punk tune that leads into a collection of songs that appear to have been somewhat inspired by 9/11 and its aftermath.\n\n150) #48 Lisa Bouchelle: Paint Your Dreams (published 2017-01-26) -- As a child growing up in Trenton, the only time Lisa Bouchelle’s parents stopped fighting was when Lisa was singing. Her mother was an alcoholic and her father struggled with three jobs to make ends meet. All of their problems seemed to subside when Lisa would start to sing. At four years old, she won a talent contest while singing “America The Beautiful” dressed in an American flag costume. It was at that moment that she knew she wanted to be a singer.\n\n151) #47 Divine Sign: Definitely Overdue (published 2017-01-26) -- Divine Sign began as a duo featuring the pairing of Lindsey Miller on guitar and Kerry McNulty on vocals. Through the years, they added additional members to round out a full band, but often went back to working as a duo. Even though the full band treatment found on this album helped develop the band’s sound from its folk beginnings to a more country/rock flavor, Lindsey and Kerry always remained the backbone of the group.\n\n152) #46 The Bouncing Souls: The Gold Record (published 2017-01-26) -- At a time when most punk bands have long since packed it up, The Bouncing Souls released The Gold Record, another amazing album from start to finish. Full of incredibly catchy tunes featuring punk and pop/rock styles, the release saw the band venturing slightly away from its punk origins.\n\n153) #45 The Gaslight Anthem: American Slang (published 2017-01-26) -- The Gaslight Anthem put a lot of pressure on themselves to make a great album after the breakthrough success of The ‘59 Sound, a release that made them practically a household name for rock and roll fans throughout the world. The band was not only up to the task, but crafted an album in American Slang, which solidified their place as one of the hottest rock bands alive.\n\n154) #44 Ken Shane: South Ridgeway Avenue (published 2017-01-26) -- Ken Shane grew up in both North Jersey (Springfield) and South Jersey (Atlantic City), but it’s clear his heart remained at the Shore. His memories of the beach, boardwalk, and summers spent at his Grandparents’ house on South Ridgeway Avenue were the inspiration behind this wonderful collection of songs.\n\n155) #43 Joe Whyte: When The Day Breaks (published 2017-01-26) -- Born and raised in Matawan, Joe Whyte is proof that even Jersey boys can sing with an honest to goodness country twang. Currently living in Rutherford, Joe is part of New York City’s Americana/Alt-Country scene.\n\n156) #42 Anthony D'Amato: Down Wires (published 2017-01-26) -- Down Wires comes firing out the gate with “Ballad Of The Undecided,” a full-blown rocker that hints at an expansion of the folk-rock sounds Anthony D’Amato was gaining a reputation for. But by the first few stanzas of “Holy War,” he also hints that he is ready to serve as a major voice of his generation.\n\n157) #41 The Dipsomaniacs: The Life You’re Faking (published 2017-01-26) -- The Dipsomaniacs got their name straight out of the dictionary. It means, “one who has an irrepressible desire for alcoholic drinks.” Tom O’Grady, the band’s drummer had it on a list of potential band names he created back in high school. Tom and Mick Chorba, the band’s songwriter and lead singer, had been in bands together since they were 13, but it was the band inspired by alcohol that gave them their shot at stardom.\n\n158) #40 The Milwaukees: American Anthems Vol. 1 (published 2017-01-26) -- For years, The Milwaukees’ band name mystified me. Who names a band from New Jersey after a city in Wisconsin? But with the release of American Anthems Vol. 1, it suddenly all made sense. The band, which has had a series of personnel changes through the years, was the true personification of American rock and roll. And what city in America represents the average blue-collar American more than Milwaukee?\n\n159) #39 James Dalton: Smile Goodbye To The Kings & Clowns (published 2017-01-26) -- Around the time James Dalton recorded Smile Goodbye To The Kings & Clowns, he could be found somewhere on stage most every night along the Jersey Shore. One night he might be seen adding mandolin to the songs of Nicole Atkins, the next he might be jamming on harp with Matt Witte. Everybody knew him as JPAT back then, a young artist with an incredible voice and an unrelenting desire to play.\n\n160) #38 Rick Barry: Declaration Of Codependence (published 2017-01-26) -- Rick Barry is a bit of an enigma. He’s got an uncanny ability to win over a crowd’s attention with even the quietest song, yet that power has rarely shown in the studio. Personally, I think this brilliant songwriter from Point Pleasant is often guilty of trying to dress up his recorded tunes too much. Maybe that’s why I love this particular release.\n\n161) #37 Maybe Pete: Pancakes And Martinis (published 2017-01-26) -- Pancakes And Martinis by Maybe Pete may only contain six songs, but six very impressive songs. There’s no fluff at all here. It contains some of the pounding rock and roll the band was known for, but also shows the band expanding their songwriting through tunes written by Kelly McGrath that sound unlike anything else they had ever released.\n\n162) #36 The Bouncing Souls: How I Spent My Summer Vacation (published 2017-01-26) -- How I Spent My Summer Vacation was the first Bouncing Souls album to feature Michael McDermott on drums. This was the first and only lineup change throughout the history of the band. From the very first track it was clear that McDermott was up to the task and the band had come through with one of their best releases to date.\n\n163) #35 Mimi Cross: I Slept... (published 2017-01-26) -- Mimi Cross is not your typical singer-songwriter. Her music is like a blend of the sound experimention of Kate Bush and the prose of Patti Smith. She lures you in and has the ability to seduce you with her voice. The combination of these attributes is a style uniquely her own; one that sounds mystical and almost spiritual.Mimi was born in Toronto, but grew up in Millburn and Long Beach Island. Later on she would settle in the Red Bank/Highlands area and become a fixture of the Asbury Park music scene.\n\n164) #34 Dramarama: Everybody Dies (published 2017-01-26) -- Dramarama remains one of New Jersey’s most underrated bands of all-time. During the ‘80s, the boys from Wayne had the distinction of holding the #1 fan voted song for KROQ in California (“Anything, Anything”) and WHTG in New Jersey (“Last Cigarette”) yet never truly rose above cult status elsewhere. They broke up in 1994, but their songs lived on through live shows by lead singer John Easdale.\n\n165) #33 Arlan Feiles: Come Sunday Morning (published 2017-01-26) -- Come Sunday Morning sounds much more polished than Razing A Nation, but the themes are similar. Arlan remains true to the ideals he believes in and isn’t afraid to speak out. While, at times, the music may be more upbeat than his previous release, it’s still a folk album at heart; focusing on love and war, and souls seeking salvation.\n\n166) #32 John Gorka: The Company You Keep (published 2017-01-26) -- There’s something about growing up in the Garden State that stays with people; it becomes part of their identity regardless of whether or not it’s readily apparent, and it’s something that’s hard to shake. Even though John Gorka has lived in Minnesota long enough for the state to claim him as one of their own, the man who once penned the song “I’m From New Jersey” has never forgotten the roots he planted growing up in Colonia.\n\n167) #31 Jon Caspi: Eddie Knows! (published 2017-01-26) -- Who would have thought a song like “What Does Eddie Know?” from I’m Not Angry... Anymore could inspire an entire rock and roll concept album? Perhaps more surprising is the fact that it led to a rock and roll concept album that actually works!\n\n168) #30 April Smith and the Great Picture Show: Songs For A Sinking Ship (published 2017-01-26) -- April Smith grew up in Toms River and became one of the stars of the Asbury Park music scene before moving to Brooklyn; there she became an indie-music darling and was placed on several national tours. She’s always had a remarkably powerful voice, it just took a few years to develop a style that took full advantage of it. On Songs For A Sinking Ship, she’s found that style.\n\n169) #29 Red Wanting Blue: These Magnificent Miles (published 2017-01-26) -- Red Wanting Blue first released These Magnificent Miles independently in 2008 as the band’s eighth full-length album. The title was a nod to the band’s lifestyle, a perpetual ride through the country performing night after night as if they were members of the circus coming to town.\n\n170) #28 The Amboys: Everything Between The Moon And The Sun (published 2017-01-26) -- The Amboys hail from Asbury Park. The band, comprised of C.M. Smith, Manny Castanon, Connor Effenberger, and Dan Effenberger (who replaced Kyle Waugh, who played on the album and was the band’s original rhythm guitarist), has been one of my favorites in the Asbury Park music scene since they first began hitting the stage in 2009. Their debut album provides brilliant country-infused garage rock and roll that reminds me of Johnny Cash waking up on the wrong side of the bed after an all night binge, taking some speed, downing a Jack and Coke, and heading out to the local punk rock bar to jam with whoever was on stage. It’s got a true kick ass spirit to it.\n\n171) #27 The Commons: Dirt Waffle (published 2017-01-26) -- Dirt Waffle represented a major change of direction for The Commons. This release moved away from the collective moodiness and introspection of Come On Get Gone towards a mixed bag of rock, pop, and even jazzy numbers. The result is somewhat akin to the music released by the Canadian band Barenaked Ladies during the ‘80s. It was something entirely unexpected from The Commons, but they pulled it off well. In fact, the album seems to get better with age.\n\n172) #26 Casual Gypsies: Crazy Places We Take Ourselves (published 2017-01-25) -- If you try searching for information about Casual Gypsies on the Internet, you won’t find much. The band literally disappeared from the face of the Earth after releasing this amazing collection of songs; a shame because when you hear this debut, you’re bound to wonder just what this band was capable of in the future.\n\n173) Why Asbury Park? (published 2017-01-25) -- Ever since Bruce Springsteen released Born To Run and became a household name, music fans have traveled to Asbury Park to learn more about the town. They came to see the Palace, the boardwalk and the rides and to hear Madame Marie tell their future. They came to have a drink at the Stone Pony and see shows at Convention Hall. They came to imagine they were cruising down the circuit on a Saturday night. And, even after the rides disappeared and Madame Marie left town, the fans kept coming.\n\n174) JPAT (published 2017-01-25) -- James P. Dalton Jr., or JPAT as he’s known, is one of the most interesting musicians along the Jersey Shore. An extremely talented singer-songwriter, he plays guitar, mandolin and harmonica and brings back the spirit of the Upstage Club to Asbury Park. Since there no longer is a place like Upstage where young musicians can go and jam, he’s created his own version of that club. One night you might see him adding mandolin to the songs of Nicole Atkins, the next night he might be playing harp with Matt Witte. He’s known throughout the musical community and he’s jammed with just about everybody.\n\n175) DeSol (published 2017-01-25) -- The faces along the Jersey Shore have been changing as more and more ethnicitys settle down here. In recent years, Spanish food markets and restaurants have opened and conversations can regularly be heard in languages other than English. So it should come as no surprise that one of the most interesting bands to hit the area in some time contains a strong Latin American influence.\n\n176) Matt Witte & The New Blood Revival (published 2017-01-25) -- Matt Witte just might be one of the most exciting artists to come out of the Jersey Shore in decades. He’s known as a brilliant songwriter and tremendous live performer but what really sets him apart from others is the type of music that he plays. Matt infuses bluegrass and country influences with folk, punk and rock and roll. The result is a sound not heard around the Shore for some time.\n\n177) Maybe Pete (published 2017-01-25) -- Maybe Pete is the latest in a long list of great Jersey rock and roll bands to find a home along the Shore. The band is based out of North Jersey, but has been playing clubs like the Saint and the Stone Pony on a regular basis. Maybe Pete was formed at the end of 2000 and includes the husband-wife team of Frankie and Kelly McGrath on guitar, Marc Gambino on bass and Sal DiMaria on drums.\n\n178) Last Perfect Thing (published 2017-01-25) -- Last Perfect Thing is a band based in Asbury Park that has a sound based more in punk music than it does with traditional Asbury sounding bands. They’ve been around since 1998 and are a regular at clubs like the Stone Pony and the Saint.\n\n179) Jody Joseph and the Average Joes (published 2017-01-25) -- Jody Joseph and the Average Joes remind you of what Jersey Shore music is all about. Each show contains the mixture of good blues, R&B, and rock and roll featuring the wonderful vocals and songwriting of Jody Joseph.\n\n180) Bob Burger (published 2017-01-25) -- Bob Burger is a member of the Bobby Bandiera Band and a longtime songwriting partner of such Jersey Shore artists as Glen Burtnick, Bobby Bandiera and Joey Vadala. In 2002, Bob headed to the studio to record a bunch of original songs for a CD called Almost an Island. Backing him in the studio is Rob Tanico from Highway 9 and TJ from John Eddie’s band.\n\n181) Danny White (published 2017-01-25) -- Danny White is proof that the Jersey Shore is still producing great singer-songwriters. The Matawan-based artist writes songs filled with stories of people you feel as if you know. His words capture their hopes and dreams like a modern street poet. He has often been compared to Bruce Springsteen, a comparison not likely to go awayanytime soon.\n\n182) Mimi Cross (published 2017-01-25) -- Mimi Cross is not just another pretty face, she’s also one of the most talented singer-songwriters on the Jersey Shore. Born in Canada, she now lives along the Shore and is a veteran of the local music scene. Mimi has graced stages from local clubs like T-Birds Cafe, the Saint and the Stone Pony to Maxwell’s and the Liquid Lounge in Hoboken. She’s played in clubs from New York to Boston, Philadelphia on down to Washington, DC and has opened for such artists as Sting, Bonnie Raitt, Lauryn Hill, Jeffrey Gaines, Jill Sobule and Chris Whitley.\n\n183) Joe D’Urso (published 2017-01-25) -- Joe D’Urso is one of the adopted sons of the Jersey Shore, mainly due to playing here often and because his music evokes comparisons to people like Bruce Springsteen. Born and raised in New York, Joe is a fine singer-songwriter who has released a bunch of records through his own independent record label.\n\n184) The Pony’s Crazy Ride (published 2017-01-25) -- The Stone Pony has always had a strange run during its history. From its early days as a disco bar to the heights of the Asbury music scene when the club would be packed night after night with lines around the block, the bar had seen it all. As the town itself moved further into ruin, the Pony remained the one constant you could count on.\n\n185) The Outcry and Blowup (published 2017-01-25) -- The Outcry started playing the clubs in the early 90s at a time when the Asbury Park scene was in trouble. But the band certainly made the most of their opportunities. They had regular gigs at the Fastlane and the Stone Pony as well as clubs in Long Branch and musicians like Bruce Springsteen and Brian Setzer jammed with them.\n\n186) Peter Scherer of Mr. Reality, Samhill, and Highway 9 (published 2017-01-25) -- At the end of the eighties a new band took over the Jersey Shore scene. Known as Mr. Reality, the band featured the songwriting of Gordon Brown and the vocals of Peter Scherer. Together, along with Rob Tanico, they formed an acoustic trio playing sets unlike anything else. Everything seemed to move fast for the band. One day Peter was opening the door for people at the Fastlane, the next day the crowd at the Fastlane was there to see him. Mr. Reality soon was signed to a deal and released a debut record. A tour of the country followed and then just as quickly as it had started the band was finished.\n\n187) Gordon Brown of Mr. Reality, Samhill & Highway 9 (published 2017-01-25) -- At the end of the eighties a new band took over the Jersey Shore scene. Known as Mr. Reality, the band featured the songwriting of Gordon Brown and the vocals of Peter Scherer. Together, along with Rob Tanico, they formed an acoustic trio playing sets unlike anything else. Everything seemed to move fast for the band. One day Peter was opening the door for people at the Fastlane, the next day the crowd at the Fastlane was there to see him. Mr. Reality soon was signed to a deal and released a debut record. A tour of the country followed and then just as quickly as it had started the band was finished.\n\n188) Soul Engines (published 2017-01-25) -- Soul Engines was one of the most popular bands along the Jersey Shore in the early 90s. Built around the brilliant songwriting of Mark Nuzzi, the band had a largely acoustic rock sound that picked up a loyal following of music fans in Shore towns like Asbury Park and Long Branch.\n\n189) T-Birds Cafe and the Saint (published 2017-01-25) -- Every good music scene needs that one person who goes out of their way to support up-and-coming bands, in Asbury Park that person is Scott Stamper. In the eighties, he was responsible for booking the bands at T-Birds Cafe, an intimate venue located on Main Street. After that club closed, he opened up the Saint and continued to provide new talent with a great place to play.\n\n190) The Fastlane (published 2017-01-25) -- Around the world the Fastlane is noted in rock and roll history for being one of the clubs where a young Jon Bon Jovi got his start. Bon Jovi played here long before becoming famous with bands like Atlantic City Expressway, the Rest and the Wild Ones.
