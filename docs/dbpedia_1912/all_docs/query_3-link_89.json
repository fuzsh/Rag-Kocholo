        "text": "I'll let someone else post the commonly known ones. Here's some that aren't so well known, especially to those younger folks.\n\nFrom the \"old days\" (before the 1980's):\n\nGlenn Miller, one of the best-known big band leaders, was born in Iowa, but grew up in Fort Morgan.\n\nPaul Whiteman (who led one of the first \"white\" jazz bands) lived in Denver.\n\nJimmie Lunceford, one of the more influential black swing band leaders in the 1930's lived in Denver for several years and studied under Whiteman. Lunceford was one of my favorites, so here is a clip. This is fun one to sing:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkkgS...ext=1&index=70\n\nPeanuts Hucko, who was a well-known Dixieland-style player, lived in Denver and played at the Navarre downtown for several years.\n\nDave Grusin, who has composed dozens of movie scores, led an all-star jazz band, and has numerous compositions to his credit, grew up in Littleton.\n\nMore recent:\n\nDiane Reeves, a Grammy-winning jazz singer, grew up in Denver.\n\nNelso Rangell, who lives in Denver, is a Grammy-nominated jazz artist.\n\nJust to name a few.\n\nLast edited by jazzlover; 10-12-2010 at 09:22 PM..\n\nSome others:\n\nPhillip Bailey of Earth Wind and Fire (and also has a solo effort) is a Denver native as is India.Arie. Judy Collins graduated from Denver East HS.\n\nThe following bands are from Colorado: Firefall (Boulder), Big Head Todd and the Monsters (Littleton), 3Oh3 (Boulder), The Fray (Denver), The Flobots (Denver), The Apples in Stereo (Denver), One Republic (Colorado Springs), The String Cheese Incident (Boulder), The Samples (Boulder), and more.\n\nSeveral prominent rockers spent time in Colorado recording at Caribou Recording Studio in Nederland, including: The Eagles, Joe Walsh, Earth Wind and Fire, Chicago, Jackson Browne, Michael Jackson, Supertramp, Steven Stills, James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, The Beach Boys, Amy Grant, Billy Joel, and Steely Dan. The studio operated until it burned down in the mid 80s.\n\nSeveral well-known bands have recorded live music at Red Rocks Amphitheater. The most famous are: U2, Dave Matthews Band, John Tesh, Blues Traveler, The Moody Blues, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Coldplay, and the Allman Brothers Band."
