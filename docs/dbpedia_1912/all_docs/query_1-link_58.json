        "text": "A word about our listings\n\nA guide for Customers\n\nThese days artists and bands tend to book their tours months in advance. In order to give you the best notice of up and coming shows we list events once they have been confirmed by the band or their management\n\nThe downside of this is that dates can change due to unforeseen circumstances, sometimes at very short notice. We do our best to ensure that this site is kept as up to date as is possible, with updates happening at least once a week.\n\nTherefore to avoid disappointment we recommend that you check these listing prior to setting out for your show especially if you are traveling any distance.\n\nNot listed?\n\nA guide for Artists and Promoters\n\nThe quickest way to get yourself included in our listings is to send an email to rideout at stayfree.co.uk once your gig is confirmed.\n\nWe also need you to do the following -\n\nPut the name of the artist or band name along with the date of your show in the email subject line.\n\nAttach a reasonable sized photograph. A 72dpi, jpeg, bigger than 200x200 pixels would be fine. Please don't email files over 1mb in size. If in doubt please drop us a line before sending. Let us have your web address so we can link to your site or Myspace page.\n\nSend us some text. Whilst we are happy to tidy up spelling or grammar, we don't have the time to write or edit copy for you. Ideally we need a nice concise 'blurb' of between 75-100 words. Please don't send a three page biography, or else we are likely to bounce it back to you. If you have a selection of press quotes send what you have as we can usually easily compile something from them. There are plenty of examples of the sort of thing we need here on the site to help you out.\n\nPlease note - If you have played at The Musician before and we have text on file, we will continue to use use it for any subsequent listings unless you supply new copy."
