        "text": "Join us in the cafe for an end of tour review from the European leg. Rosie has ensured that we have the latest ice cream delights in stock as Jeff, Dan and Mike chat through their own personal insights into the Nordic and London shows.\n\nWe also read out a few of the listener comments too. Enjoy...\n\nRobert has co-written a song with Garry Tallent at a songwriters retreat. He has been described as 'the Scouse Springsteen' by Q Magazine. The legendary Bob Harris is a big fan of this award-winning singer-songwriter from Liverpool. AND ..... his new album Barriers is riding high in the charts alongside Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Luke Combs.\n\nWe record this episode live in the cafe with the help of Rosalita's home made chocolate cookies. For more information, check out https://robertvincentmusic.com\n\nWho'll stop the rain? Not even Bruce had the super powers to stop the wet weather in Sunderland. North of England in May will more than likely need a poncho in your rucksack.\n\nJeff, Dan and Jim brave the challenging conditions to witness a 3 hour set from Bruce and the E Street Band. We manage to get some 'in the pit' conversations from a few people as well. We also name-drop a few of our listeners too as we read out your views of the Stadium of Light gig.\n\nOnce we had dried out, we meet up the morning after the night before to discuss the gig. Sit back, pour a drink and enjoy.\n\nOur listeners may be more familiar with Wesley Stace as John Wesley Harding. That guy who has been responsible for several great Bruce covers and some guest appearances with The Boss. Wesley can be often seen curating his own live show with a mixture of performing artists. One day - he hopes he can persuade Bruce to make another surprise appearance.\n\nTune in and listen to some brilliant tales about him and Bruce hanging out whilst we share some of his great music. For more information please visit www.wesleystace.com\n\nFrankfurt 1981 - the River Tour. 43 years ago this week. Our own Dan French gets an invite he can't refuse. 'Meet me in Frankfurt - I have a ticket for you' says a fellow fan. What happens next? Let's just say you couldn't make it up.\n\nNo more spoilers, but let's just say that this story is legendary in E Street fan circles and we have finally persuaded Dan to recount those amazing few days.\n\nJeff and Dan also conduct an E Street Shuffle for each other in between the refreshments provided by Rosalita and the E Street Cafe podcast team.\n\nJeff, Dan and Mike get together in the cafe to have a good old chinwag about the first 3 live gigs of 2024 in Phoenix, Las Vegas and San Diego.\n\nAlso in this episode, we each choose our Top 3 Bruce albums of all time and our favourite track from each of those albums.\n\nRosie cooks up a couple of specials to keep the boys well fed.\n\nWhat do you think of our choices? What would your Top 3 be? Let us know and we'll give you a shout-out.\n\nMay 9 1974 - Bruce Springsteen performed a show that is considered to be a watershed moment in his career. A local photographer, Barry Schneier, had seen Bruce perform a few months earlier and suggested to the promoter that Bruce should open for Bonnie Raitt that night at The Harvard Square Theatre, Cambridge, MA. The promoter agreed and Bruce was booked in to perform at short notice.\n\nAlso in the audience that night was Jon Landau, a music critic for Rolling Stone and The Real Paper. What Jon witnessed that night, and would write about afterwards, would alter Bruce's life, and indeed his own.\n\nNot only was Barry instrumental in putting Bruce on the bill that famous night, but he was there with his camera to capture this important piece of musical history.\n\nFor more details on Barry's book 'Bruce Springsteen: Rock and Roll Future' - visit barryschneierphotography.com or any other major online store like 'you know who'!\n\nPull up a chair, pour your favourite drink and rewind 50 years. Enjoy.\n\nIn part 2 of our chat with Vini 'Mad Dog' Lopez, we cover the recording of the second Bruce Springsteen album, the break up from the band, golf, Steel Mill Retro and the various reunions with Bruce and the band over the last decade or so.\n\nEntertaining and engaging as ever - Vini regales stories from his lifelong career in Rock and Roll and we make sure he partakes in our very own E Street Shuffle challenge.\n\nEnjoy and don't forget to leave us a nice review if you liked this double header!\n\nThe founding member of the E Street Band. Rock and Roll Hall of Famer. Do I have to say his name? It's only Vini 'Mad Dog' Lopez in the Cafe to join Jeff for a chat about the early years up to and including the recording of the first album.\n\nAs you can expect, this episode is crammed full of epic Jersey Shore tales from the 60s up to 1973.\n\nPart 2 is in production and covers the recording of The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle and the 'ups and downs' thereafter. Strap yourself in and enjoy.\n\nMike 'Mikipedia' Saunders and co-host Dan French compete in a winner-takes-all quiz in the E Street Cafe. Suitably refreshed for the event - the two adversaries go head to head on their specialist subjects. Who will win the BIG prize - a fresh cinnamon bun freshly served by Rosalita.\n\nIf you're in the car - wind down your windows and let the wind blow back your hair as you join in and shout the answers out. If you're in the comfort of your own home, grab yourself a pen and paper and have a go.\n\nWho'll win the battle of the Titans? Tune in and play along.\n\nMeet Jean Mikle, possibly the hardest working lady on the New Jersey shore. Not only does Jean have a day job as a reporter with the Asbury Park Press, but sh is busy on the board with The Light of Day foundation and the Asbury Angels. Oh and she also runs guided tours of famous Springsteen sites in New Jersey with her good friend Stan Goldstein. In this episode, Jean recounts her memories back to 1978 and her first Bruce concert, and we also talk about her 2024 tour hopes.\n\nWhen Phil started selling records in Evesham market with his late brother Steven 38 years ago, little did he realise that he would still be happily running Badlands today. Not only do Badlands sell records, but they provide tickets and packaged tours to Springsteen shows in Europe and the US.\n\nIn this episode, Phil joins Jeff and Dan in the cafe to reminisce over the last 38 years.\n\nSloppy Sue messes up again - and almost wipes Peppie (the Cafe dog) out too.\n\nFor more information - visit www.badlands.co.uk\n\nMark A Wright is a natural born performer. He is widely known to the Bruce community for his brilliant cover versions of Bruce's songs - and not all the obvious ones! He has performed at Bruce pre-show parties and Light of Day.\n\nNot only that, but he has an 'Elvis sings the Boss' act and many other guises. He is also a singer-songwriter. Mark is a wonderful guest and our staff really enjoyed Mark's musical performance live in the cafe.\n\nPour yourself a ginger ale or some Bruce Juice and enjoy the scintillating chat with Jeff and Mike.\n\nSlane Castle in Ireland in 1985 was a first for Bruce on many fronts. It was also a trip that will live with our intrepid podcast hosts (and 12 other fellow travellers) for the rest of our lives.\n\nThe trip was filled with mishap, adventure, danger and a lot of fun. Well, it is Ireland - we wouldn't expect any less.\n\nTune in for a bag full of stories from 38 years ago that will make you cringe and laugh at the same time. Glory Days indeed. Oh, and don't spill your Guinness.\n\nLauren Onkey has probably one of the most respected CVs/ résumés in the music industry. Not only has she interviewed The Boss online a couple of years ago, but she was asked to write the introduction to Dave Marsh's new book 'Kick Out The Jams.' In fact if it wasn't for Dave's encouragement all those years ago - Lauren's career may not have taken the turn it did.\n\nIn this episode, with the help of Rosalita and the new staff plying Lauren with ice-cold beers, she tells Jeff and Dan about how she discovered Bruce's music, her journey into music journalism and her working relationship with Dave Marsh.\n\nKen Rosen is the author and creator of the Bruce Springsteen blog - EStreetShuffle.com In this episode Ken tells us that his wife was the inspiration for him starting the blog. Well, kind of! She was fed up of him recounting Bruce stories over dinner, so asked him 'Why don't you start a Bruce blog?'. Now that Mr and Mrs Rosen talk about normal things over dinner, he has fresh vigour and energy to put out daily postings that, for E Street fans, are absolutely riveting.\n\nRosie gets the order slightly wrong today. Peppie is heard barking in the background, and staff interviews were conducted so that we can get well deserved help in the E Street Cafe. Pour yourself some Bruce Juice, sit back and enjoy the chat.\n\nIn 2015, Jake Clemons played a very intimate and special gig in the tiny front room of Deirdre and Saoirse Houston's house on the west coast of Ireland. 37 very lucky people (and a cat) were there that night as Jake pulled up in his small red rental car and proceeded to unload his saxophone and guitar. That night will stay with those lucky 37 people forever - especially as they were required to collectively help out on one song! Tune in to find out the full story of that wonderful night in Galway and to hear the fantastic memories from that living room gig.\n\nThe E Street Cafe Podcast often asks our guests: 'If you could travel back in the Gig time machine and see any concert - what would it be?' Our three intrepid hosts often state that the 1976/1977 Chicken Scratch and Lawsuit Tours would be right up there. Not only has this week's guest been to those concerts, but he was also very lucky to be in the second row of the second Hammersmith show in 1975. Are we envious of John Hersov - you bet we are! However, we are very fortunate that John dropped into the cafe to regale tales from his time on the road during this very special time and beyond. Enjoy!\n\nBruce's career is pretty well documented from 1975 onwards. In this intriguing chat, the author and researcher Craig Statham pops into the cafe to talk about his updated version of his book Springsteen: Saint in the City 1949 to 1974 - a superb and thoroughly researched book about his real formative years. On one of the hottest days of the year, Rosie keeps the guys going with iced water and other refreshments. Please contact Craig direct if you want to order a revised copy of this great book.\n\nIn this episode, we give first hand accounts of some of the recent European gigs that our hosts attended. What was the first E Street Band gig in Edinburgh for 42 years like? A welcome tour debut in Birmingham. Geezers reunited in Gothenburg, and have we uncovered a better way to 'see' Bruce in Hyde Park? Mix all that up with a random mix of predictions for 2024 and this makes for a friendly chat in the cafe.\n\nJoe Francis unexpectedly met Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney backstage at Glastonbury in 2022. He was hungover a little, but styling it out in denim shorts and Crocs whilst nursing plenty of coffee from the magical barista backstage. But, this is the important part ..... Joe is also a very talented musician and songwriter himself. He is the front man and face of Winter Mountain.

That's why the media couldn't get anywhere near him at the iconic Hammersmith '75 concert. Pete was a confident and self-assured sales rep for HP Sauce at the time, but had managed to talk his way into Bruce's inner circle on the day of Bruce's first and historic overseas concert with the help of an oversized jar of pickled onions!\n\nAgain in 1981, Pete hung out with Bruce and the band on the River tour. A larger than life character, Pete shares some of his personal stories with Jeff and Dan whilst Rosie searches around the kitchen for Pete's chosen drink of Vimto and a peculiar special bread request.\n\nWe hope you enjoy listening to this episode.

It's rather funny. We explore if Hywel (rhymes with towel) and his brother were the real characters in Highway Patrolman. Besides, Joe and Frankie does sound better than Hywel and Alan after all. Jeff and Hywel get together live in the E Street Cafe with one mic and a rather amorous dog.
