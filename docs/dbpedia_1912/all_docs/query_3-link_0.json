        "text": "American jazz musician\n\nPhil Urso (2 October 1925, Jersey City, New Jersey — 7 April 2008, Denver, Colorado) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist and composer known for his association with trumpeter Chet Baker.\n\nUrso learned clarinet as a child and switched to tenor sax while in high school. He served in the Navy during World War II and then moved to New York City in 1947. There he played with Elliot Lawrence (1948–50), Woody Herman (1950-51), Terry Gibbs, Miles Davis (1952), Oscar Pettiford (1953), Jimmy Dorsey, and Bob Brookmeyer (1954). In 1955, he first began working with Chet Baker, and was a prominent contributor to Baker's Pacific Jazz releases in 1956. Urso and Baker would collaborate sporadically for some 30 years.[1]\n\nUrso worked with Claude Thornhill late in the 1950s, but receded from national attention in later decades. He moved to Denver and continued performing locally into the 2000s.\n\nSentimental Journey with Bob Banks (Regent, 1956)\n\nSalute Chet Baker with Carl Saunders (Jazzed Media, 2003)\n\nThe Philosophy of Urso: Phil Urso's 1953–1959 Sessions (Fresh Sound, 2016)\n\nWith Chet Baker\n\nChet Baker & Crew (Pacific Jazz, 1956)\n\nChet Baker Big Band (Pacific Jazz, 1957)\n\nPlayboys (aka Picture of Heath, Pacific Jazz, 1957)\n\nThe Most Important Jazz Album of 1964/65 (Colpix, 1964)\n\nBaby Breeze (Limelight, 1965)\n\nWith others\n\nLouis Armstrong, Louis and the Angels (Decca, 1957)\n\nThe Hi-Lo's & Jerry Fielding, The Hi-Lo's and the Jerry Fielding Orchestra (Kapp, 1956)\n\nGerry Mulligan & Chet Baker, Mulligan and Baker!
