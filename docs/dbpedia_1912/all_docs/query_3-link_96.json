        "text": "This is a revised article that was published in the December 2002 issue of the Joslin’s Jazz Journal (JJJ) and the Spring 2003 issue of the IAJRC (International Association of Jazz Record Collectors) Journal. A follow-up article containing the itinerary was published in JJJ and IAJRC (winning an IAJRC award in 2003).\n\nThe Elliot Lawrence Orchestra was one of the last dance bands to come on the scene. It offered the youngest bandleader and musicians. When it started on the road, the average age in the band was 21. This article focuses on the beginning of the band and its road band period from 1946 to 1951.\n\nJoe Techner was my father. He had the jazz chair for trumpet in Elliot’s band from November 1948 to July 1951. His solos are on Elliot’s Columbia singles “Elevation” and “Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea.”\n\nI based the article on my October 1999 personal interview with Elliot at his upper East Side home, with several phone interviews, and interviews of musicians; including Howie Mann at his home in Hicksville, NY, Merle Bredwell at his home in East Sandwich, Mass., Phil Urso, Bruno Rondinelli, and Stan Weiss. A wealth of contemporary newspaper and magazine clippings filled in the gaps where memories had faded.\n\nElliot Lawrence was born Elliot Lawrence Broza on February 14, 1925. He grew up in Devon, just outside Philadelphia. “My first memories are of music, I was at the piano almost as soon as I could sit up straight,” Elliot recalled. His first public performance was at age 4, conducting a kid band on the Children’s Hour. He began taking piano lessons at the age of four from child specialist Christine Reebe, and by age six wrote his first composition, a tune called “Falling Down Stairs.” Elliot was a veteran of several public appearances when, in 1931, he was stricken with polio (poliomyelitis, infantile paralysis) and for six months fought the illness. After this time, he found that polio had affected the muscles in his fingers. Doctors did not think he could ever resume his short-lived pianist career. Initially, he returned to music by picking up a sax. Then, at the age of 8, he returned to the piano with the help of his mother. His persistence paid off, and at the age of twelve, he formed his first band, a 15-piece unit called the Band Busters.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1941, he led a children’s band on Philadelphia CBS flag station WCAU on the Children’s Hour, a Sunday show sponsored by the local restaurant chain Horn and Hardart. Since 1928, Elliot’s father, Stan Lee Broza, was an executive at the station, over the years filling the spots of general manager, vice president, and program manager. Although Stan Lee Broza was credited as producer of the show (1928 – 1958), it was Elliot’s mother, Esther, who produced and scripted it, and provided a nurturing home for Elliot. In 1949 she shed light on how she motivated her son to great success, “I firmly believe that if you handle a child with love, instead of sternness, you can get him to do just about anything.”\n\nElliot told Laura Lee of the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin that he owed his success to his mother who kept him at the piano when he wanted to be out playing basketball, by the simple expedient of pulling his hair, “There was only a short time, around the time I was nine years old when I didn’t like to practice. That was the period when I was interested in sports and thought I wanted to be a professional ball player… I’m still interested in sports, but music is the only career I have ever seriously wanted since I was grown up (35).”\n\nElliot had mastered the piano, saxophone, and clarinet by high school and participated in boxing and wrestling. Elliot continued to do local work with his Band Buster crew, including Rosalind Patton, Bruno Rondinelli, Johnny Dee, Andy Pino, and the Giamo Twins (Mike and Lou). He even wrote the Berwyn High Alma Mater song.\n\nElliot finished high school at age 16 and entered the University of Pennsylvania on a four-year scholarship. He majored in piano under the tutelage of Erno Barlough. During his sophomore year, he won a statewide competition held by the Penn State Music Teachers Association. His accomplishments at the U. of P. included directorship of the football band, winning the Hurley Cross scholarship - the Alumni prize in music, and the Thornton Oakley Gold Medal for achievement in creative art – the first time a music student awarded it. The Gold Medal was the highest award at the university.\n\nElliot participated in two Mask and Wig shows, including “Red Points and Blue.” His band, now renamed the Elliot Broza Orchestra, played proms at Villanova and Temple during his junior year. Virginia Polytech, Cornell, Princeton, Penn State and U. of P. featured his band in his senior year. He wrote “A Suite for Animals,” a tone poem submitted to the Philadelphia Symphony for performance during the fall 1944 season. Also, while at Penn, he studied piano and symphonic work under Leon Barzin, a famous New York conductor and composer, who thought so highly of him that he offered Elliot an assistantship. In 1944, after only three years, Elliot graduated at age 19 with a Bachelor of Music and received the school's Art Achievement Award in Music. This award was only the second time in history that the university gave the prize in music.\n\nElliot remembered he formed his first band at the beginning of World War II, and it played at football games. Members dressed in Penn, Army khaki, and Naval Reserve uniforms; others wore Penn uniforms. The band performed during games at Penn’s Franklin Field in front of audiences of 80,000. Elliot said that in October 1944, this football band appeared on the front page of the Evening Bulletin, the owner of radio station WCAU read it and told Elliot that when he graduated, he wanted him to become music director of the station’s house band.\n\nThe owner of WCAU was Leon Levy, president of WCAU Broadcasting Company, Director of Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and its subsidiaries. Leon Levy was the brother-in-law of Samuel S. Paley, known as the founder of the CBS radio and television network. In 1944, Leon Levy was serving in the U.S. Navy and he left his brother, Isaac D. Levy - chairman of the board for WCAU - in charge.\n\nElliot accepted and took over the band the following January with disappointment that he couldn’t bring many of the Band Busters, “after all this time I’m finally going on WCAU - But without all the fellows I stated with - the fellows I really want to build a great band.”\n\nHe did bring on two that he specifically wanted: Johnny Dee and Gerry Mulligan. Elliot’s predecessor was Johnny Warrington, who went on tour. For about a year, Mulligan was writing arrangements for Warrington’s house band.\n\nIn a January 2012 interview with Patrick C. Dorian, Elliot said his band was chosen to open for Dizzie Gillespie and Charlie Parker at the Philadelphia Academy of Music concert. Dorian’s interview is interesting because this is the only time that Elliot seems to mention this appearance.\n\nSegall was the unfortunate operator of the Down Beat Club in Philadelphia that featured Black artists including Dizzy Gillespie. Elliot’s association with the concerts was important because it was here in 1945 that Elliot Lawrence picked up trumpeter Red Rodney, a favorite of Dizzie Gillespie.\n\nThe February 11, 1948 Down Beat reported, “The Downbeat, mid-town jam spot where the color line was never in force, either on the bandstand or in admitting patrons, is no more part of Quakertown’s after-dark scene. And all because Nat Segall, who also introduced jazz concerts in classical halls here, refused to fall for the Jim Crow line. Downbeat (the club, that is) was downed during a police ‘clean up’ campaign, which gave them a chance to vent to their racial prejudices, according to Segall. As a result, they closed his room ‘because Negroes and whites mix freely there.’ The Downbeat, a must spot for all visiting musicians, had been known throughout the city as probably the most genuinely inter-racial nitery in the area. Jamming musicians were both white and colored and patronage was about half and half. Segall said the charge of minors being served in his establishment was merely a police screen and that he was being persecuted because colored and white were generally mixed at his place. ‘The Mason-Dixon line has moved up north,’ said Segall, in giving up the famous swing room.”\n\nHere is what the band sound like in 1945 with Red Rodney, trumpet, and Max Spector, drums.\n\nElliot apparently distanced himself from Segall after pressure from Columbia Records. While I didn’t ask Elliot about Segall, Elliot did share the expectations Columbia put on him after I asked about his later recording of Elevation, a be-bop tune. Columbia wanted to develop Elliot’s band as a dance band featuring ballads.\n\nElliot’s two early jazz influencers, Red Rodney and Gerry Mulligan, had just left the band and Columbia was not interested in be-bop. Nor was Columbia interested in crossing the line of Jim Crow. Elliot shared billing with Billy Holiday at Segall’s concert. In 1939, Columbia refused to record Billy Holiday’s “Strange Fruit” because they found the subject matter too sensitive. Holiday was under contract with Columbia at the time.\n\nA union rule forbade them to stay in any hotel for which they were playing. Sidemen often doubled-up in rooms to save expenses, and they “ghosted it” sometimes, as Phil Urso and Stan Weiss remembered. Phil explained that one guy would check in with a razor bag concealing two razors, toothbrushes, and enough toothpaste for the following day. Someone would flip a coin for the top bed and pillow while the other guy slept on a mattress on the floor. Traveling on the road cost money, and this was one way to save a few bucks.\n\nMore details into the routine of Elliot’s sidemen are gleaned from the Elliot Lawrence Band Manual that Bruno Rondinelli saved. Elliot prescribed that five bandsmen would travel in each car. A 1-1/2 ton truck transported the instruments and luggage sporting a clothing rack for uniforms. Bulk clothing belonged on the truck. “We allow three hours driving for 100 miles,” and musicians were obligated to arrive three hours before a job. The band reserved rooms in advance. “Of course, there will be no night driving. This is a union law,” Elliot decreed. The boys broke this rule many times over. Elliot paid for each man’s personal, disability and accident insurance premiums. Elliot employed the men in his hometown of Devon, Pa., for insurance purposes, and they all had state unemployment insurance coverage. Musicians insured their personal instruments.\n\nThe Manual noted that Elliot held orchestra rehearsals before broadcasts and before each recording. The band had a section rehearsal and one full band rehearsal each week. The Post article noted that, as preferred by the musicians, they held the rehearsals during the week in the wee morning hours after a performance. The band did the daily daytime rehearsals when the band had a couple of days off in a row during a run of one-nighters. However, as Howie Mann remembered, the band often had only about three days off a month, and there weren’t that many rehearsals because the band was traveling a lot, just a lot of warm-ups. Musicians were prohibited from “jamming” less than one hour before a performance but were allowed to warm up backstage or next to the bandstand. Tuning on the bandstand was allowed fifteen minutes prior to playing. While in New York, Elliot often conducted his daytime rehearsals at Nola Studios, 113 W. 57th St.\n\nWhen the band was free, it was usually on Monday nights because it was the one night that colleges didn’t typically hold dances.\n\nBoth Elliot and all the boys in the band hated the one-nighters. Howie Mann remembered that sometimes they finished a late-night gig and had to drive all night for a concert in the morning. Howie described working the one-nighters in my interview. Sometimes their meal was a Coca-Cola drink and a package of cookies from a service station. Other times they had plenty of time to relax and prepare for their next performance. During these times, as Phil Urso remembered, they were able to check in to the hotel, clean up, put on their red jacket and ask at the desk where the gig was. The guys looked forward to the few opportunities they had to stay in one place for a few weeks. This is why they forgot playing the many one-nighter ballrooms and proms but still remember the Hotel Pennsylvania, the Hotel Roosevelt, Galveston’s Pleasure Pier, Bop City, the Blue Note and the Paramount Theater at Times Square. The reason why they played so many one-nighters was because the colleges paid the most money.\n\nAn interesting note about the Paramount; the band was raised on a platform from a “pit” below the stage. The platform had fixed sold-wood music stands and chairs. The musicians were stuck on these platforms during their hour shows and the whole time worried that they would fall off if they moved just a few inches. It was a fifteen-foot drop. Howie Mann hovered in his seat on the platform above the piano with no back support. He had an eighteen-foot drop.\n\nThe basic uniform for Elliot’s sidemen was a maroon cardigan, gray pants, white shirts and a multi-colored bow tie that Elliot’s mother designed. The Band Manual added that musicians would carry a white handkerchief in the suit coat breast pocket, dark socks, and shined browned shoes. Howie Mann recalled additional uniforms including a tan suit with straight tie; a navy blue suit with straight tie or bow tie for formal jobs; and a brown corduroy jacket tailor made by Fox; a “hip” tailor in Chicago.\n\nElliot wore purple plaid jackets, yellow monogrammed shirts and flowered ties. Arnold Fine of the Washington, D.C. Daily News noted, “He seems a likable youngster, normal in every respect – except for the colorful ties and sporty jackets he wears.” Reviewer Michael Levin criticized the leader’s appearance, “occasionally as a result of nervous tension, he turns on a smile of such intensity that casual observers say migawd he must be a phoney – nobody can show that much teeth and mean it.”\n\nElliot paid musicians union scale that progressed over the years from $110 to $150 a week in cash. Merle Bredwell made a few dollars more to cover the cost of driving his own car (including nine cents a mile reimbursement and being the “road manager.” From their wages, personnel had to pay for their own meals and lodging. Sam Santell was the original road manager and was brought over from the George Paxton band. (Leonard Stevens temporarily replaced Santell as road manager during the band’s Hollywood stay). Then sometime about 1949-1950, Bredwell replaced Santell as road manager. During this time, it was really Bredwell’s wife Lynn that did most of the work. These managers would tend to the business of bookings, transportation and public relations. They called ahead to hotels and mapped out the drive and obtained road information from the American Automobile Association (AAA). “An organization literally on wheels is a complex affair,” noted Elliot.\n\nIn 1951, Elliot recalled how dangerous the roads were, “There are times that we have prayed together. Once we were caught in a blizzard in upstate New York. We wanted to make an engagement in New York City on time, yet, of course, hurrying was impossible. We all were very aware that not a month before, though no one had been hurt, one of our cars had rolled over an embankment. Rosalind, our singer, took out her prayer book. We were all praying. We missed the engagement but got to the city safely.”\n\nBand members Howie Mann and Bob Karch made home movies that capture life on the road. Howie credits these movies for keeping the memories after many years.\n\nThe musicians mainly carried Local 77 (Philadelphia) or Local 802 (New York) union cards for Jimmy C. Petrillo’s American Federation of Musicians (AFM). Elliot’s aggregation was predominantly from Philadelphia. Unions were segregated at the time. In Philadelphia, Local 77 was “paleface,” and Local 274 was the “Negro union” Both were AFM. Petrillo was AFM national president based in Chicago from 1940 to 1958.\n\nFrom being raised by a musician dad, and interviews with his peers, I learned that most musicians don’t see color. Their understanding, expression and appreciation of music elevates above the ignorance and stupidity of our society. And this is what I think of when I listen to “Elevation” - an Elliot Lawrence chart infused with jazz. More about this recording later in this article. Howie Mann, born in raised in Queens, NY, tells us his experience encountering racism down South in 1949.\n\nThe Elliot Lawrence Orchestra was one of the few bands that traveled to the Deep South and, as mentioned earlier, Columbia Records didn’t want to challenge Jim Crow. They also didn’t want to be too Jewish, or any other ethnicity. Bandleader Elliot Broza became Elliot Lawrence, drummer Howard Tittman became Howie Mann, saxophonist Mike Goldberg became Mike Gordon, trombonist Vincent Forchetti became Vincent Forrest, trumpet player Walt Lyszkowski became Walt Stuart, arranger Frank Huntertmark became Frank Hunter, vocalist Menna Riccardo became Ricky Riccardo, vocalist John Averona became Jack Hunter, vocalist Rosalind Piccarelli became Roz Patton, saxophonist Berton Herbert Swartz became Buddy Savitt, trumpet player Robert Chudnick became Red Rodney, and so on.\n\nAt least one tune was renamed to garner favor of Southern audiences; Mulligan’s “Apple Core” was renamed the “Texas Hop” when they appeared at Galveston’s Pleasure Pier.\n\nReviewers typed Elliot as a Claude Thornhill clone. While Elliot was at the Café Rouge in 1946, reviewer Michael Levin wrote, “As for the charge that the band imitates Claude Thornhill, Lawrence’s piano playing sounds more like CT than anything else in the band. His use of French horn tends toward a single moving voice with reeds where as Thornhill is more interested in brass section tonalities and ‘room tone.’ Both bands are concentrating on harmonic color overlaid with woodwind delicacy. It’s parallelism of effort rather than copying.”\n\nElliot responded to Levin, “My piano does not sound like Thornhill’s. Claude concentrates on effects played in the higher register against the band, whereas I play melody on the middle keys.” However, in October 1944, Elliot prepared an Arrangers Guide that stated, “piano is the featured instrument of band, and should be featured in almost every arrangement. The piano will be in the style of Teddy Wilson-Claude Thornhill – light – usually single note right hand – never heavy chorded playing.”\n\nA year later, Elliot’s December 1947 opening at the Hollywood Palladium was reviewed, “Many thought it was great and sat nodding approvingly as Elliot put the band through its paces, yet others felt that although it sounded good, it resembled too closely an illegitimate child born out of Stan Kenton by Claude Thornhill… A few dyspeptic listeners drew the Kenton-Thornhill comparison, but for the most part it was considered a good and welcomed opening.”\n\nElliot told me, that the band was two kinds; one on the ballad side, somewhat like Claude Thornhill’s band, somewhat moody; and yet on the jazz side was be-bop with Gerry Mulligan writing compositions. Many of Thornhill’s personnel were in Elliot’s band, including Red Rodney, Gerry Mulligan, Gil Evans, and Lee Konitz. “I had every intention of going into symphonic work. However, I started having fun and earning money in the dance field and just stayed there,” Elliot remembered in a 1952 interview.\n\nElliot’s piano style was suited more for symphonic performances rather than jazz solos. By 1948, Elliot completed a full-length musical score, and Robbins Music contracted for a series of his works for piano studies. Elliot reported Art Tatum as a favorite piano soloist, and his ambition was to compose “classical music.” In 1946, reviewer Michael Levin remarked, “Lawrence himself confines his piano playing to short intervals of melodic snatches. If he is to establish claim to musicianship as well as arranging and leading, there should be more straight piano and a little less cuteness.” Levin again reviewed Elliot at Bop City in January 1950 and stated, “His piano playing was never easy nor flowing, always carried with it a sense of working stiffness that hampered the ideas.” For an illustration of Levin’s points, listen to the original Columbia release of “Elevation.” Then, compare it to the alternate take of “Elevation” recorded at the same session and released on Gerry Mulligan’s posthumous Mullenium album. Bob Karch performs the piano solo on the original release. Elliot does the keyboard work on the alternate take.\n\nIn his book The Swing Era, Gunther Schuller said that Elliot was one of the five most interesting big band latecomers who belong more to the modern post-swing period. Elliot shared this distinction with George Paxton, Boyd Raeburn, Georgie Auld, and Randy Brooks.\n\nBy the time of Elliot’s arrival on the band scene, “swing music,” popular during the war, was on its way out. In a September 1947 article in PIC, author Dorn Dornbrook wrote, “Swing music is going the way of the Charleston and the Bunny Hug. It’s just a matter of time until the bobby-soxer will be something to tell the grandchildren about, along with the flapper and the red-hot mama.”\n\nWhat remained on the musical menu were quick-tempo Latin rumbas and sambas, sweet and low dance tunes and the emerging be-bop sound.\n\nElliot stayed away from the Latin jump tunes. By 1949, Elliot said that rumbas and sambas were “definitely out” on college campuses and elicited no response from the audience.\n\nThe sweet sound was Elliot’s primary commercial output. Initially, he favored it and saw it as a medium to ease in his symphonic leanings. “We’re trying to get more classical sounds, Elliot said, “That way we get a sort of purple mood. Overseas, the kids loved wild razz-ma-tazz. But now they’re back, they want to put their arm around their girlfriend and romance slowly.” Among the “classical” selections that Elliot offered were “Chopin’s Prelude in A Major” and Debussy’s “Clair De Lune” (adaptation). At the Café Rouge and Washington’s Club Kavakos, Elliot’s “Heart to Heart” band was advertised as “The Band That’s Sweet with a Beat.”\n\nAt the end of 1948, Elliot attempted to shrug the sweet profile when talking to trade pub Metronome, ”We’re not strictly a sweet band, not by any means. Maybe when you hear us in hotel rooms and spots like that you think so, but listen to us on one-nighters and on college dates, and you’ll hear us jump, too. I’d die if we didn’t and so would the guys. Trouble is, though, we’ve been typed, because when we first started at station WCAU in Philly, we had to play a lot of sweet stuff. That’s radio. You know.”\n\nElliot was playing “Elevation” as early as the Hollywood Palladium days in late 1947. It was purportedly the first tune Mulligan that ever wrote as a teenager in Philadelphia. On January 29, 1947, Red Rodney first recorded it on his Bebop album (Keynote Records). Mulligan later expanded it for Elliot. Although radio listeners heard the Elliot Lawrence Orchestra play it at the end of every broadcast and one-nighter, Elliot had not yet recorded it commercially.\n\nGerry Mulligan was from the Reading, Pa. area, and Elliot was from Devon, just outside Philadelphia. Mulligan moved to Philadelphia and dropped out of West Catholic High School after problems at home. Elliot recalled that Mulligan stayed in the Broza home for a while. Mulligan and trumpeter Red Rodney had been with the band in 1945 during its infancy. The two left together and joined Gene Krupa in January 1946 without recording commercially with Elliot. While with Krupa, Mulligan wrote arrangements for “How High the Moon” and “Disc Jockey Jump.” Mulligan’s next went with Claude Thornhill. In September 1948, Mulligan left Thornhill to stay in New York City with the Miles Davis Birth of the Cool group (Klinkowitz, pg. 28). While with them, Mulligan played anonymously off and on in Elliot’s sax section when Elliot appeared at the Paramount in March 1949.\n\nHowie Mann recalled \"Elevation\" as the only memorable recording for the band and remembered the boys had difficulty convincing Elliot Lawrence to record the be-bop tune. The band pressured Elliot and, once he agreed, Elliot had difficulty convincing Columbia’s A&R man Manie Sachs.\n\nIn a 1949 interview, Sachs noted the distinct change in the public’s music taste since World War II. “They aren’t interested in loud music, jam sessions or any kind of music that plays away from the melody itself,” he said. “Be-bop hasn’t a chance. It’s a fad. I can’t understand it, and I don’t know anyone else who can explain it and make sense.” he said.\n\nDespite this opposition, Howie said that Elliot came back from Columbia with a deal; the band could record it, but the band members had to personally promote it by going town-to-town, visiting radio stations, and handing out copies. At first, the band thought this was tacky, but they agreed.\n\nDuring a week in April that the band was initially scheduled off, Elliot secured a recording date. He wrote band members a letter with details for the “Elevation” recording session. On April 12, 1949, the band met at the AFM rehearsal hall at 18th & Arch Streets in Philadelphia. The rhythm section met at 1:45 p.m. A full band rehearsal from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m.\n\nThe second cut was “Ev’ry Night Is Saturday Night,” which allowed the trumpet section to warm up. Elliot used a vocal chorus on the record.\n\nThen came time to record “Elevation.” A Down Beat review of “Elevation” noted it was not recorded right,“ With Elevation, you can hear what happens when the boys go hog wild with resonance, and don’t control it properly. I would guess that this record was made in Columbia’s East 30th Street church studios in New York City, with the new Altec Lansing microphone, which has a wide range pickup. Because the session was done without proper attention to control, the entire side is mush, with no definition between sections.”\n\nThe recording of “Elevation” that made it on the Columbia sides was later part of the Smithsonian Institute’s Big Band Jazz Collection as one of the top 50 jazz recordings of the 20th century - was a warm-up take meant for setting recording levels. Elliot Lawrence is NOT on the piano as commonly believed. It was the first take, and Elliot was in the control room with Columbia’s engineers checking the sound. Bob Karch is the piano soloist. After performing alternate takes, the band picked the initial recording with Karch on piano as the best. Elliot didn’t object since the record was meant for the boys in the band. Years later, Elliot told jazz veteran Burt Korall, \"I believe we got such an excellent performance of ‘Elevation’ because the guys in the band were so happy to have a chance to record it. The company was a little leery about letting us do it. Columbia executives wanted to develop interest in our ballad things rather than our jazz arrangements and soloists.\"\n\nKorall’s liner notes for Jazz In Revolution eloquently reviewed the recording, “On ‘Elevation,’ Gerry Mulligan's treatment of the blues, the band gives every indication of having matured and fully come to terms with the sounds and rhythms, the language of modern jazz. The score is lean, harmonically interesting (using ninths, elevenths, and augmented elevenths), and compactly made. Based on a long sweeping twelve-bar line over blues changes, it allows sufficient room for soloists Phil Urso, Vince Forrest, Joe Techner, Lawrence [Bob Karch], and Howie Mann to have their say. Excellent ensemble writing tightly links thematic material and solos, giving the work flow and a strong pulse.”\n\nMerle Bredwell also remembered the recording, “I think we made a pretty good recording. I’m sure, you know, when you play the same arrangement every night, and each soloist has maybe a little addition he wants to put into it, it’s going to change from night to night. So, I would say probably there were a lot of other times we played the arrangement – maybe at a dance or a concert – that might have been better than the recording, but still, I think the recording was a blessing for the musicians that were involved in it.”\n\nThe following is the personnel for the \"Elevation\" recording; Joe Techner, Johnny Dee (John DeFrancesco), and Jimmy Padget, trumpets; Sy (Seymour) Berger, Vince Forchetti, and Chuck Harris, trombones; Bill Danziesen, trumpet, and French horn; Joe Soldo, Louis Giamo, Phil Urso, Bruno Rondinelli, and Merle Bredwell, saxophones; Otto (\"Bob\") Karch, pianos; Tommy O'Neill, (string) bass; Howie Mann, drums. Gerry Mulligan was also present for the recording. It was originally issued on Columbia 38497.\n\nThe band members kept their promise to Elliot. The boys in the band visited record stores and radio stations, giving out copies of the record. Howie Mann was probably the most prominent promoter and rushed a copy to Al “Jazzbo” Collins at station KALL in Salt Lake City.\n\nHowie Mann recalled how brilliant Mulligan was. Once, while rooming with Gerry, he went asleep while Gerry was working on an arrangement. When Howie woke in the morning, Gerry was still working on the arrangement. He hadn’t slept at all.\n\nTwo days after Mulligan joined, Elliot recorded his last sides on the Columbia label, including an instrumental version of “Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea” – a tune typically performed with lyrics by prominent vocal artists. The second cut was “Ritual Fire Dance” - a song not arranged by Mulligan. Arranger Frank Hunter played lead trombone on this last record date.\n\nElliot still had to contend with the heavy resistance from Columbia records. In the Down Beat interview, Elliot added, “The record companies are neglecting bands, they’re making them cut the same pop ballads that all the big singers are doing. A band vocalist can’t compete with name vocalists with those 40-man backgrounds, so naturally the band records don’t sell as well. Bands should be cutting more originals, things that are strictly instrumental pieces and which don’t have to go out and compete directly with the big vocalists.”\n\nDuring his time on Columbia Records, he also made record transcriptions. He had done many recordings for Associate Transcriptions in 1946 and 1947. Like all the bands, his studio output ceased during the 10-month AFM recording strike of 1948. He had done many recordings for Columbia while at the Hollywood Palladium immediately before the strike. From October 1949 to mid-1950, he found recording work for such transcription programs as Here’s To Veterans.\n\nOn November 17th, the band met in Columbia’s Studio D at 799 Seventh Ave. in New York and made a few cuts for an upcoming 1950 March of Dimes transcription program. Because of Elliot’s childhood struggle with polio, he was named chairman of the “bandleaders’ division” of the March of Dimes for 1950.\n\nBy the fall of 1949, the band saw the following changes in personnel over the past two years: Howie Mann (Tittman) of Glendale, Long Island, took over the drums in September 1947. In May 1948, Fred Schmidt, for years first French horn with the Indianapolis Symphony, replaced John Saint-Amour, who joined the Columbus, Ohio Symphony. Johnny Dee briefly left the band to help manage the family hotel in Atlantic City after his father became ill. Stan Kenton found him and berated him for leaving the business. Dee called Elliot, and he got his job back as first trumpet.\n\nIn November 1948, the same time as Dee’s return, Joe Techner took over the trumpet jazz chair replacing Walt Stuart. Red Rodney had recommended Joe for the position. During the war, Joe had been with the Bob Sheble band and played in the 106th Army Ground Forces Band at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. Also, in November 1948, Howie talked Elliot into getting Bob Karch as relief piano on the band, thus letting Elliot front the band in his flashy sport coats. Until Karch came, the band only had a rhythm guitar to fill in when Elliot was not at the keyboard. Joe Delaquilla joined as French horn during this time. In June 1949, Bobby Hunter came on board playing trombone, and Frank Hunter officially joined the band as a full-time arranger. This was in addition to Mulligan, of course.\n\nLike so many of the bands, Elliot’s band suffered from drug use. Howie Mann said that he didn’t like what was going on in the band when he left in May 1951, “There were seven members of the band that were addicted to heroin. I’m not going to tell you their names.” Gerry Mulligan’s addiction to heroin is well known. Howie Mann said this problem primarily started with changeovers of band personnel – the influx of the Herdsmen. Howie remembered the band was “one big happy family” and a “clean-cut bunch of guys” until the problems began.\n\nIn March 1951, Elliot saw what was happening and tried a media spin, “Because of the bad publicity some bands occasionally get, many parents didn’t like the idea of their sons touring the country with us. Some parents couldn’t believe that it was possible for a band member to live a clean and wholesome life. Sunday morning, if we are on the road and if it at all possible, we stop so that the boys can go to church.”\n\nNonetheless, all the musicians that I interviewed told me the same stories. Howie remembered a band member falling asleep on Elliot’s shoulder at the Blue Note because of the abuse. Vince Forchetti remembered guys screaming and banging their heads on the walls in their hotel rooms if they couldn’t find heroin or cocaine. They would take up a collection and send someone into another town to bring back dope. Bruno Rondinelli remembered that he and Gerry Mulligan roomed together once in Ohio. Mulligan instantly started walking around the room with a heroin needle stuck in his arm. He told Mulligan it was the last time they roomed together. Mulligan would hunch over in the car after a date waiting for a fix in a hotel room. In later interviews, Elliot readily admitted the drug problem that many in his band had.\n\nIn a 1948 article of Metronome, Leonard Feather tried to warn the musicians of the day, “The truth is that today’s marijuana is kid stuff compared with what’s been going on. Marijuana, though illegal, is not a habit-forming or dangerous drug, in the opinion of most doctors. But heroin, morphine and cocaine are other and far graver matters. Their use has spread like a vile disease among an increasing clique of musicians. It only takes a few uses of these drugs to make a helpless addict. You hear that such-and-such a musician has been “busted” (arrested), or that he is trying to “kick” (break the habit), or that he is down to “five caps” (five capsules of heroin per day). It’s not a pretty sight when your favorite horn man, after taking a terrific chorus, sneaks off to a secluded spot, hypodermic needle in pocket, and returns twenty minutes later glassy-eyed, completely out of this world. Fortunately, there are still large numbers of clean-living musicians who haven’t been contaminated, but there’s nothing a junky likes more than to create another junky, who may thus be a source of drugs to him someday when he runs short. Moreover, the depressing professional conditions in which many musicians are forced to live nowadays, and the failure of the public to accept the kind of music they believe in, drives them more and more often to artificial escapes from their neuroses.”\n\nAnother cause of the drug use was a false belief that the drugs made a better jazzman. Elliot said that many young musicians thought it was the drugs that made Charlie Parker play so great, and they emulated him (Charlie Parker died in 1955 at the age of 34). Drugs and alcohol also gave some players the ability to be on the bandstand. Elliot told me that Gerry Mulligan once remarked, “I don’t know how Elliot ever did it. How he faced the band without drugs or alcohol.”\n\nMerle Bredwell recalled the effect of the drugs, “For a lot of years there were no heavy drugs, and I would say probably only about the last couple years I knew that some of the heavy drugs had come into life. And it was too bad because some of the individuals were very talented, and I don’t know why they wanted to take the drugs because I don’t think it augmented their talent at all. And unfortunately, a lot of them lost their lives because of it. And I think the closer it came to the time when I did leave, more and more was in use.”\n\nIn addition to these problems, Elliot was craving more than leading a big band. He wanted to use more of Leon Barzin’s symphonic training and saw how the new medium of television offered many opportunities for a young and ambition man to arrange and lead orchestras. His interest in television and the camera started with an interest in developing musical film shorts way back in December 1947, during Elliot’s only visit to Hollywood. While there, he produced a ten-minute film short for Columbia featuring “Five O’clock Shadow” and the band members. Also while there, Elliot signed a deal with MGM for a musical short based on Elliot’s life. In June 1948, Lawrence noted the value of movie shorts, “Band telecasts could also capitalize on the curiosity of the public about the men behind the songs – composers, arrangers and the song pluggers.” Curiously, Elliot added, “I have other ideas, too, but these I shall not reveal just now. However, I’ll tell you this: My crew is already at work rehearsing bits and specialties for the television camera. Before we’re through, every member of our band will be a complete entertainer.”\n\nMerle Bredwell recalled that the band was not as good as it was the year before. He said the band “may have been the best band in the country a year before it broke up.” In his liner notes for The Uncollected Elliot Lawrence, Frank Driggs leaves us with the following; “Young and ambitious, Elliot Lawrence stayed at the head of an always interesting and exciting big band for ten years and wound up ill and $20,000 in debt. A poignant note, when he finally decided to throw in the towel, he was given an impassioned speech by Stan Kenton who told him how much the band business needed him, how important it was to keep going, etc. Lawrence remembers how moving it all was and how Kenton felt, but it was too late. Another chapter in music closed, leaving lots of warm memories behind.”\n\nElliot confirmed Driggs’ report and said that Stan Kenton was his friend, and when Kenton heard he was planning to move to New York to do studio work and only play on the weekends, he immediately flew in from California and stayed up all night with Elliot trying to talk him out of it. Kenton told Elliot there were only a few bands he liked, the Lawrence Orchestra was one of them, and he wanted it to continue. Elliot told me that he had $18,000 in the bank when he left Philadelphia for the road in 1946 and was $20,000 in debt when he finished. Financially, he “worked very hard for zero.” Elliot admitted that the band did well for the first several years, but it tapered off and got bad. As for being ill, Elliot explained that he had terrible allergies that couldn’t be treated like they can today with sprays. He was getting sick, and his brother told him he would have to leave the road, or it was going to kill him.\n\nBelow is an October 22, 1952 Down Beat article containing similar thoughts by Elliot about leaving the road.\n\nElliot lived in Manhattan working Monday thru Thursday doing studio work. He took out the band on weekends, accepting gigs at colleges and universities. Elliot increasingly worked in radio and television studios.\n\nFor the next eight months, starting in February 1952, Elliot worked as music director of the Philip Morris Playhouse on Broadway heard over CBS Sunday evenings. He conducted an orchestra on the Guide Right television show from February 1952 until the fall of 1953. Elliot almost returned to the road in 1952 with a concert tour with Don Cornell but quickly junked these plans in favor of a daily appearance on the early-morning CBS Jack Sterling radio show. Later in the year, Elliot also conducted a 13-piece band each week on the Red Buttons TV show, mostly CBS studio men.\n\nAn August 1952 article in Metronome noted that Elliot scrapped the Mulligan arrangements for a new Tiny Kahn-Johnny Mandel book. Elliot also dropped the French horn, referring it to an “introverted instrument,” and replaced it with the “extroverted” bass trumpet.\n\nInterestingly, Elliot’s drive to feature ex-Woody Herman personnel and get on the ground floor of TV distorted his view of the road band. At the time and afterward, Elliot viewed his original road band as only a formative band, despite the Mulligan’s charts. Elliot remarked in July 1952, “this is the finest outfit I’ve ever had. I’ve got great guys on the band and have a trio of the best arrangers in the business – Tiny Kahn, Johnny Mandel, and Al Cohn.” Meanwhile, in an October 22, 1952, Down Beat article, Elliot disparaged his former road band, “The last year I was on the road the boys in the band weren’t up to snuff, and you find that after a few months of one-nighters your ear begins to get dulled to what’s right and what’s wrong.”\n\nIn my 1999 interview with Elliot, he candidly revealed that Ollie Wilson approached him about his weekend band and told him that 14 were on heroin. The drug problem was even worse than while on the road.\n\nThe reviewers felt that the New York personnel missed the chemistry that the road band had. Metronome noted that the new band needed improvement, “It is the trumpet section that something is lacking. Nick Travis, Al Porcino, Al DeRisi and Dick Sherman are capable trumpeters with attack and precision. But the joi de vivre of the trumpets is missing. The sound is most often dull. There is a brilliance missing except in their mute work that, I think, hurts the punch that the band should have.”\n\nLikewise, in the July 16, 1952 issue, Down Beat wrote, “Certainly there are times when his band sparkles and sizzles. But the inbetween product hardly lives up the expectations. When the band produces jazz instrumentals, it is at its best. Arranger Kahn, working out on the traps, keeps things swinging happily. But along comes the medleys and the fox trot pops and standards and there’s a decided letdown. The latter arrangements are fairly dull and uninteresting, though they are competently pieced together. Likewise, on these, the greatest portion of the Lawrence library, the band plays in a decidedly ‘don’t give a damn’ manner. But comes the boppish originals and its difficult to believe that this is the same band. The arranging trio came up with a “sound” gimmick for ballads. Introduced by the maestro as “toy instruments”, the stunt turned out to be hardly illegitimate [sic]. It featured the use of two curved soprano saxes over the remainder of the reed section. The experiment didn’t seem to come off terribly well. The resulting sound was not strikingly “new,” nor did it appear to be the key to the gold lode. It took the shape, in collaboration with the section, of the Herman brothers’ sound with a bit more top added. In fact, the band has been labeled loosely “Elliot’s Second Herd.” For many of the ideas of the band stem directly from Woody’s last Herd. And the number of the members of the band are graduates of that crew – Sam Morowitz (lead alto), tenor-arranger Al Cohn, trumpet Al Porcino, trombone Ollie Wilson.”\n\nMany years later, Elliot told me that his band in New York was very good but not the same as the road band, “Your father was with my band at the height of our popularity, and after that, I had a good band, later on, a couple of times, but it never hit like that original one.”\n\nElliot told me that he had “one of those love-hate relationships” with Mulligan after he left his band, “We were very close. He got on drugs, as you know, and he was in a really bad way, and the second wife got him off drugs completely. And then what really was the big argument and fights we had was, even though he couldn’t work anywhere else, I always hired him and had him write for me. And he signed contracts for all these pieces that I published, and years later, he wanted everything back for free, and I said, ‘Gerry, that isn’t the way it worked.’ I published that music. That was our problem. Then at the end of his life, he became my friend again. When he was dying, his wife said – just like your talking about your father’s early life – she said he talked about his early life that was the best time of his life. So I talked to him, talked to her, talked at his funeral. It was a very interesting relationship that went back 30 or 40 years.”\n\nAbout 1960, Elliot began a highly successful career conducting Broadway shows, including The Apple Tree, Bye Bye Birdie, Golden Boy, Sugar, How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, Golden Rainbow, and Here’s Love. In September 1963, Bob Karch wrote in a letter to Howie Mann, “Elliot has another hit B’way show (his third big smash). And I hear everything he touches turns to gold. All the producers are after him to conduct their shows. He seems like a good luck charm.”\n\nElliot formed Elliot Lawrence Productions which made openings for popular soap operas, including One Life to Live and As The World Turns, won Emmy and Tony awards, produced the soundtrack for the movie Network, and produced many television specials. He lived in uptown Manhattan with his wife Amy and had three children. Elliot was musical director for the Tony Awards, Emmy Awards, and the Kennedy Center Honors for four decades. His son James “Jamie” Lawrence, continued his father’s music production career and wrote the theme on the PBS show Going Places.\n\nElliot Lawrence’s papers are at the University of Wyoming’s American Heritage Center.\n\nI interviewed Elliot at his Upper Eastside home in October 1999. I left him with a few phone numbers, and he immediately called Howie Mann, Phil Urso, and Merle Bredwell to ask how they were doing and talk about old times."
