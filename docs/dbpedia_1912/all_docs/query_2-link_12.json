However, Alchemy: The Art of Philip and Kelvin LaVerne, written by gallerist Evan Lobel, reveals for the first time the astonishing breadth and depth of their artistic practice, which ranges from avant-garde furniture to sculpture and painting.\n\nBy Evan Lobel\n\nAs a father and son artist team, the LaVernes’ collaboration resulted in hundreds of unique and complex works, incorporating historical references to past civilizations and art historical motifs, with modernist design principles. Alchemy: The Art of Philip and Kelvin LaVerne is a comprehensive testament to the importance of these artistdesigners who brought history, craftsmanship, and innovation into conversation with functional design and art. In writing the book with Kelvin LaVerne, Lobel provides unparalleled insight into the methods and history of the duo and introduces a bounty of beautiful and never-before-seen images and commentary. This is, and will continue to be, the authoritative account of Philip and Kelvin LaVerne’s esteemed place in the history of 20th-century art and design.\n\n10” X 12”, 254mm X 305mm\n\nHARDCOVER\n\n272 PAGES\n\nOVER 200 IMAGES\n\nISBN: 978-1-938461-62-0\n\nRIGHTS AVAILABLE\n\nNEW | Golden Glass: Verre Églomisé brings the reader into the glittering world of Miriam Ellner, the foremost practitioner of verre églomisé, the ancient process of gilding precious metals on the reverse side of glass, etching in a design, and setting it off with color.\n\nWhile it was first developed in 200 BC, Ellner is one its acknowledged modern masters.

The ocean has inspired an expansive world of vernacular and popular imagery, much of it uncanny and unique, produced by the tension between the laws of nature that rule the oceans and the miniature floating societies left to their mercy. Meticulously drawn together, and with an individuality that has become his trademark, Rozensztroch gives the reader a visual feast that ranges from antique toys and postage stamps to French artist Jean Cocteau’s beguiling sketches found in Jean Genet’s cult-classic Querelle de Brest.\n\nDANIEL ROZENSZTROCH was a longtime consultant to the magazine Marie-Claire Maison and is the former creative director of Merci in Paris, France. He is also the co-author of a number of titles in the Style Series published by Clarkson N. Potter / Random House, as well as a number of books on the subject of everyday things that include Herring: A Love Story, Spoon, and A Life of Things (Pointed Leaf Press).\n\nHardcover\n\n232 Pages 9” X 12”, 229mm X 305mm\n\nOver 200 Images\n\nISBN: 978-1-938461-56-9\n\nHardcover\n\n280 Pages / 11” X 12”\n\nISBN: 978-1-938461-19-4\n\nNEW | For what is a home really, but our soul’s residence in the outer world? Using design to bring out the innermost parts of ourselves, Lisa Staprans creates layered spaces that envelope, heal, and nurture.\n\nBy weaving the spiritual and the scientific worlds together, The Soul of Design looks at everything from the use of ritual to the latest science on the connection between the brain, design, and wellness. Equal parts personal history, manifesto, and luxurious illustration, this book places Staprans as the leading spokesperson for the neuroscience of beauty. Set in the hills and redwood forests of Northern California, aided by collaborations with artisans, furniture makers, and architects, and guided by a keen mind and sensitive spirit, The Soul of Design answers the deeper questions about what design is truly capable of.\n\nLisa Staprans is the design director and CEO of Staprans Design. She has over 25 years of interior design experience, working on high-profile, residential, and commercial projects around the country, and winning numerous awards from the American Institute of Architects. This is her first book.\n\nNEW | On any given day, more people will be “wearing” Stan Herman than any other American fashion designer. As he continues to work and thrive in his 95th year, Herman is the most acclaimed uniform designer of our time.\n\nBy Stan Herman\n\nBut that is just part of a life well-lived, and well-loved. In Uncross Your Legs: A Life in Fashion, Herman reflects on a remarkable life and career, from his childhood in Brooklyn, NY and Passaic, NJ, to WWII Army service in Europe, and back to NYC as a young freelance designer in the fashion hothouse of the Garment District. Next up, 16 years as head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, where he was instrumental in bringing New York Fashion Week to Bryant Park – all the while continuing his thriving uniform and leisurewear design business.\n\nIt’s also a deeply moving and insightful memoir, following personal triumphs and tragedies, including his nearly 40 year relationship with novelist Gene Horowitz, who suffered a heart attack and passed away in 1992. Together they lived their lives in the shadow of the AIDS crisis that decimated their personal and professional worlds. They also shared a beloved poodle named “Mozart,” who helped fill the void when Herman found himself suddenly alone. With equal aplomb, Herman writes with good humor and compassion, recalling the cruel and casual racism he witnessed in the military, his focus on animal rights in the fashion industry – as well as encountering the indignities of one’s aging anatomy. Learn the story behind the man whose vision, over 60 years, has dramatically helped forge and transform American style.\n\n8” X 10.375”, 200mm X 265mm\n\nHARDCOVER\n\n320 PAGES\n\nOVER 100 IMAGES\n\nISBN: 978-1-938461-58-3\n\nRIGHTS AVAILABLE\n\nNEW | Jorie Butler Kent has led an extraordinary life in every sense of the word.\n\nBy Jorie Butler Kent\n\nShe comes from one of the great American families–the Butlers–who have had a long and celebrated history in business, exploration, and philanthropy, not to mention their central role in the establishment of polo in the United States and founding the Oak Brook Polo Club over 100 years ago.

Revolutionizing the grand, if neglected, landscape painting tradition, she mixes paint, print, sound, video, and photography, forming what is truly a unique and unparalleled body of work. While her pratice has clear antecedents in the post-Impressionist tradition of Georges Seurat and Édouard Manet, she supersedes these influences by developing a beautiful and increasingly complex world of both images and the process of image-making itself. In addition to showing over 75 exquisite works, cataloging her unique process, this monograph contains three illuminating scholarly essays, contextualizing and analyzing Ruttenberg’s œuvre, as well as 15 scannable QR codes that allow the viewer to take in the full audiovisual experience of her works.\n\nJANET K. RUTTENBERG, is a visual artist working in New York City. She has broken her intensely guarded privacy only rarely, with a solo exhibition, Picturing Central Park (2013) at the Museum of the City of New York, and its accompanying monograph, Gatherings (2013), as well as Janet Ruttenberg: Beholder (2019) at ArtYard in Frenchtown, New Jersey.

Using gouache and a bristle brush, McMullan explores not just the drama and rhythm of bodies in motion, but the excitement and fraught psychological complexity between subject and portraitist.\n\nFor the last five decades, James McMullan has been regarded as one of America’s preeminent illustrators. He has created more than 80 posters for Lincoln Center, his drawings of Brooklyn’s nightlife inspired the creation of Saturday Night Fever, and has taught drawing for over 20 years at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. In the pages of Vanity Fair, he was described by Mark Rozzo as being “to modern- day New York what Toulouse-Lautrec was to 19th-century Paris.” He lives and works in New York City.\n\nHardcover\n\n96 Pages / 10” x 13.375”\n\nISBN: 978-1-938461-49-1\n\nNEW | Caren Rideau: Kitchen Designer, Vintner, Entertaining at Home shows Caren Rideau doing it all in her own inimitable style.\n\nBy Caren Rideau\n\nWhen she’s not designing bright, functional kitchens for clients or taste-testing wine at the vineyard she runs with her partner, Andrés, Rideau is busy traveling, cooking family recipes, and hosting warm gatherings in her California home.

When Jiun was eight years old, his mother took him aside and gave him a single sentence of advice: \"You can be poor in life, but Jiun, you should never be poor in experiences.\" Those words have gone on to influence all the decisions he has made from that day forward. Born in Malaysia, Jiun moved from his home in Kuala Lumpur in the early 1990s to study interior design and architecture in Chicago. At the age of 26—after a successful but emotionally unfulfilling career with a prestigious international architecture and design firm—he boldly launched his eponymous design company and set out to achieve his personal goal of visiting more than 100 countries by the time he turned 40 and, most important, living a life rich in experiences. Tracing his journeys across the continents with camera and sketchbook in hand, Jiun Ho: Experience is an inspiring travelogue as well as a document of the designer's best work, including luxury hotels, resorts, restaurants, and private residences around the globe.\n\nJIUN HO is an award-winning interior and furnishings designer based in San Francisco. He is the founder and president of the innovative, multidisciplinary Jiun Ho Inc., which includes Jiun Ho Interiors, Jiun Ho Furniture, Jiun Ho Light, Jiun Ho Textile, and Jiun Ho De Jia—a gallery and atelier showcasing art and antiques. His work has been published in Architectural Digest, Elle Decor, the New York Times, Robb Report, Interior Design, LUXE, and elsewhere. Jiun Ho: Experience is his first book.\n\nHARDCOVER\n\n224 PAGES | 9.5\" X 12.125\"\n\nISBN: 978-1-938461-13-2\n\nNEW | The first monograph from interior designer and visionary art collector Barbara Lane is a stunning 408-page photographic tour of art-filled homes and executive offices from New York to Miami to Paris.\n\nWritten by Barbara Lane and Tracey Pruzan\n\nPrincipal Photography by Phillip Ennis and Thierry Malty\n\nBarbara Lane Interiors takes readers on a spectacular, 408-page photographic tour of the art-filled, meticulously tailored interiors designed by Barbara Lane—whose lifelong passion for collecting avant-garde paintings, sculpture, and furniture and whose acute attention to comfort, originality, and custom detail are reflected in more than 25 homes and executive offices from New York to Miami to Paris.\n\nPresented in this book for the first time, Lane’s remarkable body of work, spanning more than four decades, focuses fresh attention on the importance of art and design in our lives.

His debut book spans a fascinating career, celebrating an impeccable, warm design sense that seeks always to turn houses into homes—to achieve the Intangible through the creation of tranquility and balance. The book covers eight homes in a surprising range of styles, from modern to traditional, urban to rustic, period restorations to entirely newly imagined houses that feel as though they are just as authentic. In addition, a charming introduction describes Joyce’s unusual path to becoming a designer, with thoughtful essays on each part of his work, from houses to interiors to his products. A special view into the creative process of an influential and multi-talented designer.\n\nA master of crafting beautiful homes, Kerry Joyce is recognized as one of the top designers in the country. He has received notable acclaim throughout his career for his unique and unparalleled design sense, seamlessly marrying fine materials, clean lines, sophisticated textures, and knowing detail into exquisite interiors and houses across stylistic boundaries. Joyce has also channeled his diverse talents into a group of highly regarded home furnishing collections, including the hallmark Kerry Joyce Textiles. With offices in Los Angeles and Connecticut, his firm, Kerry Joyce Associates, offers a comprehensive approach to design and consulting, creating a richly personal and customized sensibility on each project for his sophisticated clientele.\n\n“His fabrics, his furniture, his interiors - they all have a certain je ne sais quoi. Now Kerry Joyce, in his first book, sheds light on the intangible, taking readers through eight projects in which his quiet classicism turned mere houses into homes. You’ll want to jump right in - but don’t skip the introduction. Joyce (did know he won an Emmy?) talks about his unusual career path and describes all aspects of his work including product design.” – Traditional Home\n\n“The Intangible is overwhelmingly beautiful and pleasurable – A masterful work. His vibe, his talent is absolutely POURED into it – every page just beams! The photography is sublime and when paired with Joyce's stories (and his voice) and the textiles, it's personal and thorough; really impressive. Books like this are hard to do.“ – Sophie Donelson, Editor in Chief, House Beautiful\n\n\"Upon reading Kerry Joyce's new book, The Intangible, he makes the convincing point that his palette of materials and colors results in something that might be called the intangible, a sense of tranquility and balance in rooms that is discernible but not tactile, experienced but not visible. In this compelling book, which reads in part like an autobiography, the reader comes away knowing how he designs, what he thinks about design, and why his loyal clients continue to commission him.\" - Pamela Pierce, Editor in Chief, Milieu\n\n\"To those in the design world, it seems like Kerry Joyce has done it all. Besides conjuring warm, serene homes for his discerning clients, the Los Angeles–based designer has lent his eye to textiles, furniture, lighting, and rugs….. But somehow, there's one thing this multi-hyphenate talent hadn't found time for: A book. That is, until now; The Intangible, Joyce's debut book, comes out next month. One thing it proves? There are perks to waiting for your debut. A combination of featured homes (eight in total, ranging widely in style), essays on Joyce's various creative outlets, and a retrospective introduction that outlines his career beginnings make for a holistic representation of a creative force whose work spans many fields.\" - Architectural Digest\n\nHardcover\n\n240 Pages / 11.25” X 13.5”\n\nISBN: 978-1-938461-94-1\n\nA new journey where infusions of color are woven into breathtaking, dramatic spaces.\n\nBy Jennifer Post, Written by Anna Kasabian\n\nJennifer Post Modern, is the famed AD 100 designer’s newest collection of interiors, a select group that takes us on a new journey, one where organic translates to luxury, where infusions of color are woven into breathtaking, dramatic spaces.\n\n“It is a collection made possible by clients who have given me creative freedom to translate their desires to live and experience their spaces in very distinct ways,” she notes.\n\nThis, her second monograph, is a new design declaration for Post whose less is more philosophy continues her story, but this time, she infuses her work with softer movements, and a color palette that mines the landscape.

The breadth of Epstein’s knowledge and talents is illustrated in the 13 design projects included in Mark Epstein Designs. Via each project, he welcomes you to his design philosophy: “A successful, user-friendly interior must reflect the purposes, needs, and desires of the individuals who will live happily in that space. The home is not a static monument, but a dynamic environment designed to foster contentment.” Toward that end, Epstein has added an additional real-life feature to each project: tips on successful entertaining, great recipes, memorable table settings, how to show off your collections, and many more. The “Mark Epstein Signature” is recognized not by repetition but by unique combinations of colors, textures, and client-personalized accessories.\n\nMark Epstein was educated at Pratt Institute in New York where he studied environmental design. One of his teachers was Joseph D’Urso, who became a pivotal influence on his design style as well as informing his knowledge of space and light. Josef Albers’ color theories impacted the designer’s work, and today is still an underlying signature. The numerous homes Epstein has designed are layered with his deep knowledge of art, antiques, textiles, and color theory, which are seamlessly played out in each room while creating a cohesive flow from space to space.\n\n“Mark Epstein designs personal experiences, not just interiors.

His vision was neither ostentatious nor grandiose, but subtle and quietly magnificent. Ultramodern Samuel Marx: Architect, Designer, Art Collector is the first monograph on this lesser-known but increasingly influential American designer. In more than 200 photographs, Marx expert and decorative arts dealer, Liz O’Brien, reveals many of his undiscovered projects, including houses that have been razed despite preservationist protests, as well as his range of furniture designs. Throughout his career, Marx was sought after for his ability to integrate art in well-heeled interiors. The private art collections of many of his wealthy clients have, in the last 40 years, been dispersed to major museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nLiz O'Brien is a decorative arts dealer specializing in modern design. Her interest in Marx began more than ten years ago when she first showed his furniture designs in her New York gallery, making some of his best pieces available to interior designers and collectors. O'Brien is now recognized as a leading Marx expert and has been instrumental in placing him as an important figure in the history of twentieth-century architecture and design.\n\n“Rooms designed by Samuel A.

Author Susan Roy charts the panic-fueled evolution of the shelter from a well-stocked basement pantry to a full-fledged (and often completely decorated) home addition, revealing through extensive archival photography, nuclear-era memorabilia, and previously unpublished media, a government and people in the grip of self-delusion. Fastidiously researched and sharply written, “Bomboozled” captures the absurdity and uncertainty of a culture that knew no better than to trust its government’s message.\n\nSusan Roy is a writer and editor on architecture, design, and cultural history. The founding managing editor of Allure magazine, she has also held senior editorial positions at This Old House, SELF, Good Housekeeping and Avenue. She holds a master’s degree in architectural history from Columbia University; Bomboozled is loosely based on the subject of her master’s thesis, “The Family Fallout Shelter During the Cold War.”\n\n“Susan Roy pairs illustrations with incisive commentary to reveal just how deluded we used to be about prepping for the all-too-thinkable nuclear attack.” —The Oprah Magazine\n\nHardcover with die cut\n\n176 Pages / 9” X 10”\n\nISBN: 978-0-9823585-7-3\n\nDownload Press Release\n\nDocumenting the creation of one of the most unique and exquisite private houses built in Los Angeles in recent years.\n\nBy William Hefner\n\nChateau des Fleurs is an extraordinary book documenting the creation of one of the most unique and exquisite private houses built in Los Angeles in recent years.
