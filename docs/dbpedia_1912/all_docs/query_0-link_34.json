Along with his band Stone Caravan, he will be performing at a number of this year’s shows including “Night of Covers” at the Silverball Museum in Asbury Park where his opening act will be Dead Aire which includes WDHA’s Jim Monaghan.\n\nAmong the amazing artists performing this year, look for John Waite, Billy Hector & Albert Lee, the Weeklings, Joe Grushecky & the Houserockers, Willie Nile, and Jesse Malin."
