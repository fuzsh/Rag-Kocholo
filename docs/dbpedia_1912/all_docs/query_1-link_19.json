        "text": "Nicole Atkins reestablished that her voice is a marvel at the Outpost in the Burbs’ first OutpostFest, held at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation in Montclair on Sept. 23. (It moved there from its intended site, the grounds of the Van Vleck House & Gardens, because of the heavy rain that was forecast for that day, and that indeed came.) She sounded great on her opening song, “Neptune City.” But she coughed a little at the end of it, and then told the audience that she was suffering from bronchitis, and that “we’re going to see how this goes … I’m going to see how many songs I can get through without totally dying.”\n\nShe started another song, but abandoned it quickly, saying she need to play something that would allow her to sing in a lower register. “This is my worst nightmare,” she told the crowd.\n\nShe then sang “A Night of Serious Drinking” and, once again, sounded great, but also started coughing again. She made it through most of the song but then stopped abruptly. “I am really sorry,” she said. “I can’t do it.”\n\nIn a show of support, the crowd clapped loudly. She promised to come back, and thanked the crowd “for being so cool,” but then left the stage.\n\nThe end to the show seemed particularly disappointing since Atkins sounded so good when her illness wasn’t getting in the way. But it also was alleviated, to some degree, by the fact that the OutpostFest had already offered a lot of stellar music, by five other acts, on this rainy afternoon.\n\nJoe Pug, performing solo, added covers of the late John Prine’s “Sam Stone” and the late Justin Townes Earle’s “Mama’s Eyes” to his own thoughtful, warmly sung, originals. Though his tone was usually serious, he got a little lighter for the jaunty standard “Enjoy Yourself (It’s Later Than You Think)” and his own “I Don’t Work in a Bank,” a short song that many artists (and journalists, these days) will be able to relate to. He described it as a “tough love song” written after a fight with his wife, to express what he sees as “the nature of our domestic reality.”\n\n“I don’t work in a bank, they’re not my beans to count/If you want proof, when I go broke, no one will bail me out,” he sang. “Don’t ask me where I’m going, don’t ask how much I drank/If you want answers, that’s just fine, but I don’t work in a bank.”\n\nFreedy Johnston, who has been recording unassuming pop-rock gems for more than 30 years, was expertly backed by guitarist James Mastro (The Bongos, Ian Hunter’s Rant Band) and drummer Steve Goulding (Graham Parker & the Rumour). “I only play with legends,” Johnston said, as if awed, himself, by the musicians he was onstage with.\n\nHis set included older songs (“Bad Reputation,” “The Lucky One,” “This Perfect World,” “Responsible”) as well as some relatively new ones (“There Goes a Brooklyn Girl,” “Darlin’ “), mostly in his distinctive, reflective-but-still-catchy style, though there also was one stylistic outlier, “Remember Me,” which has a bit of folk-gospel flavor. (Watch videos of “The Lucky One” and “Darlin’ ” below).\n\nDebra Devi and her band added some blues flavor to the show. Montclair native Matthew Smith, who performs under the name Hodera, generated some feel-good sentimentality by inviting his father, J.O. Smith, to join him on vocals and harmonica throughout his set, in the same room where he was baptized. (“When they said this was getting moved to the church, it was upsetting, but also, it was like, it’s a very full circle,” he said.)\n\nAnd Adam Falcon, who opened, capped his solo set with a powerful one-two punch that seemed tailor-made for the day’s depressing weather, with the mournful ballad “Woke Up Crying,” featuring lyrics about tears falling like rain, being followed by the buoyantly hopeful “Sunshine (Woke Me Up This Morning).”\n\nBreaking Out: Adam Falcon\n\nFrank Matheis\n\nAdam Falcon is not your typical bluesman. In fact, there is nothing typical about the New York singer-songwriter. For starters, not many blues musicians can read and write music at his level of expertise. Falcon is a formally trained songwriter, who transcribes his songs, as well as a session guitarist. He does not copy typical blues riffs and licks, especially not the standard 12-bar blues. There is virtually no emulation of others, although he can play in the style of George Benson or Jimmy Johnson, depending on what is needed. His guitar technique is closer to a jazz/soul musician than typical blues players, but the blues element is omnipresent and profound. He prefers understated chords and phrasing to overt solos and snazzy showmanship. Yet, one listening to his song Woke Up Cryin’, and many of the very typical blues players would wish that they could write a deeply emotive, soulful blues song like that. It’s the blues if ever there was one. Lyrically, poetically, and emotionally, he sings the blues his own way. Even when covering others, like Robert Johnson’s Come on in My Kitchen, his arrangement leans more on jazzy chord changes than copying the song note for note. Falcon is independent, idiosyncratic, and self-assured in his direction and in his essentially organic style. He is deeply passionate and grounded in emotive feeling—essential for the blues. If that all seems unusual today, there was a time when the musical prowess to shift from jazz to blues was standard and even expected. Lonnie Johnson, Jay McShann, Amos Milburn, T-Bone Walker, and Robert Lockwood Jr. come to mind.\n\nThe dreadlocked Falcon is from the Bronx, New York, and now makes his home in Suffern, New York, not far from New Jersey. His mother was from Harlem and his father from New Orleans and the blues style of both places is integral in Falcon’s style. He heard Louis Jordan, Fats Domino, T-Bone Walker, Snooks Eaglin, and Louis Armstrong records around the house as a kid, as well as a broad selection of African American music. As a teenager of the baby-boomer generation he had his ears open to it all: the Beatles, R&B, Motown, B.B. King, Dylan, and all that music that formed sounds of the generation of the late ’60s and ’70s. He graduated from high school in the Bronx and studied music at Bronx Community College and right afterwards went on tour with the singing group Revelation. In 1975 they even opened for the Bee Gees. For years he worked as a session guitarist and road dog, backing the likes of Stephanie Mills and Phyllis Hyman. He even opened for Whitney Houston once. If you are from New York and want to make a living as a musician you need to have your skills honed, to be versatile and ready for every opportunity, no matter what style, the same way the original blues players had to adjust diverse repertoires for playing to different audiences.\n\nNo wonder his blues reflects all that. Soul, with jazz chords, call it a “blues infused” amalgam. In any given set he’ll play Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, Jimi Hendrix, Robert Johnson, and Taj Mahal songs, along with his own strong blues compositions, on his mahogany Martin and National resonator guitars. He says of his music: “The mood . . . will take you on a ride from New Orleans to the Caribbean and drop you off somewhere in the Delta, with stops along the way.”\n\nAs he told LB, “I play blues with a different beat and I like everything from reggae to Brazilian music. During my Brazilian phase I played a nylon string guitar. I switched to steel string guitar and went to a period of loving Richie Havens, Bill Withers, and Ben Harper. I also love the deep blues of Robert Johnson and Taj Mahal. Blues to me is folk music from a particular group of people; whereas, old country music is folk music for another group of people. It’s all music for people having a good time. I don’t label myself as a blues musician but I am rooted in the blues with different influences. That’s why they call it “roots music” after all. I just want to spread a good message. When people hear me play, I want them to feel good at that moment, to feel like someone else understands what they are going through. You can feel alienated in this world. Music should be uplifting.”\n\nHis own compositions pack a punch and he has written some fierce blues songs that will grab anyone’s heart. His powerful song Woke Up Cryin’ made Falcon a semi-finalist in the International Songwriting Competition and landed him a nomination in the blues category of the Independent Music Awards. The song True Blue that he wrote for the multi-Grammy winner George Benson, whose style is distinctly similar to Falcon’s when he is in a jazz mood, was noticed by the Songwriters Hall of Fame. They bestowed him the Abe Olman Scholarship in 2007. Another composition, Like a Soldier, was used in the national television series The Injustice Files.\n\nFalcon plays mostly around the New York region, with occasional trips to New Orleans. He’s a regular at top local Hudson Valley venues: the Falcon, Daryl’s House in Pawling, the Turning Point, and the Towne Crier Café in Beacon, New York. He frequently opens at big venues and he has opened shows for the James Cotton Blues Band, Matt “Guitar” Murphy, the Wailers, Jim Lauderdale, Tower of Power, Ruthie Foster, and many more.\n\nRecently, his song Colored Man Singin’ the Blues, with a distinct socio-critical view about injustice and inequality, was included in Black Lives—From Generation to Generation, an album on the European label Jammin’colorS. The record features a collective of artists who are continuing to fight for equality and social justice through music, for the cause of fighting racism worldwide. The collective is engaging in a 2022 European tour, and Falcon will join the troupe of 12 musicians as guitarist.\n\nWhile he has made a living with more popular genres, his current direction has transcended toward a more roots blues style. His distinctly blues-oriented 2015 EP The Light Shines includes a phenomenal version of Corinna, as ethereal and deep as any. The title cut features the artist playing funky slide on this original blues, which features Keith Fluitt (Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson) and Martha Redbone on backing vocals. Falcon is currently recording a new album in Philadelphia. “It’s a blues-oriented album based on my personal life experiences, my kids, New Orleans, etc.” His past albums have been a stylistic mixed bag. Bohemian 959, a record with a distinct, slick, uptown vibe, issued in 2009, is rooted in soul/ funk. The album features Nona Hendryx on vocals. I, too, Am Colored in Black and White, from 2000, is a mix of urban and roots blues. The album includes a compelling cover of Jimi Hendrix’s Up from the Skies, slow, jazzy, and sophisticated. His song Love Moves On straddles the pop folk realm with a blues bent.\n\nHe reminisces about a quarter of a century as a professional musician with an existentialist, pandemic-era recognition: “I was in Europe, working with the artist Jonathan Butler and we opened for Eric Clapton. The occasion was an anniversary celebration, at the Royal Albert Hall, commemorating Clapton’s 25 years in the music business. I remember thinking about how that must feel, doing something you love, for a lengthy amount of time. It’s been over 25 years since that Clapton anniversary and now the feeling of doing what I love has become a reality. I’m not sure how long I’ve been making music, but it’s well past 25 years with no sign of slowing down. I know I’ve been blessed to do what I’ve always wanted to do, but there comes a time when I take it for granted. Recently, there have been memorable people and friends in my life who’ve passed on. Each one becomes a wakeup call. While attending a memorial for a musician friend and seeing familiar faces, I realized the importance of every moment . . . Lately, it’s been something I’ve tried to pay more attention to. If there’s something you love doing, do it, until it can no longer be done. Try reconnecting with friends.”\n\nIt’s definitely time to tip the hat to the New York bluesman after 25 years of playing professionally. If you are unfamiliar with this stellar artist, take some time to get to know Adam Falcon as his career continues to ascend.\n\nBetter Days\n\nAs a song writer, one question that I’m asked most often is, “how do I go about writing songs?” “Is it the words or the music that come first?” Without the risk of sounding trite, my answer each time is pretty much the same - It depends on the circumstance. I believe there’s a song in almost everything that surrounds us. I read that on a visit to New York City Elvis Costello saw a song in everything imaginable. “Penny Lane” and “Strawberry Fields” by The Beatles were both drawn out of fond memories when Marvin Gaye’s classic “What’s Going On” addressed social and political commentary. The vast majority of my songs present themselves when least expected and where I least expect to find them - exemplified in my song titled “Better Days.”\n\nSometime after 9/11, I was invited to play on a recording session, not far from ground zero. Living forty-five minutes outside of Manhattan, this became one of my first visits since the devastation. Covering the city I felt sadness grabbing hold of my emotions. I grew up in this city but it resembled nothing like I remembered. Removed was the appearance of the thriving and vibrant mecca called “The Big Apple.” Landmark sights mournfully replaced by posters of missing loved ones. A somber and ominous bleak-filled shell was how I described it. My heart and spirit had become absent from everything except the current affairs in my home town.\n\nI arrived at the studio oddly located in a hotel, for most studios were closed.\n\nThis hotel accommodated firefighters com- ing to New York helping with the rescue effort at ground zero.\n\nIn the lobby stood firefighters from around the country. Without knowing each other, these men bonded together heroically referring to themselves and other firemen as ‘brothers.’ Their terminology ‘brothers’ provided hope and encouragement which became the impetus for writing “Better Days.” During that time my un-enthusiasm for playing music directly transformed into an obligation to encourage my listeners with the same encouragement that these firefighters proudly demonstrated. The opening verse to the song is: “Take a message to my brother, let him know I’ll help carry on, keep him standing strong.” Each verse justifiably speaks of reassurance, before moving into a reaffirming chorus of inspiration and faith. The song is summa- rized by the final lyric which states “... tomorrow is gonna be a better day.”\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/adamfalconfan- base/better-days\n\nhttp://www.adamfalcon.com/\n\nHis mother was from Harlem and his father was from New Orleans. Adam Falcon heard Louis Jordan, Fats Domino, Snooks Eaglin, and Louis Armstrong records around the house as a kid, as well as a broad selection of African American music. As a teenager of the baby-boomer generation he had his ears open to it all: the Beatles, R&B, Motown, B.B. King, Dylan and all that music that formed sounds of the generation of the late ‘60s and ‘70s. He graduated from high school in the Bronx and studied music at Bronx Community College and right afterwards went on tour with the singing group Revelation, and in 1975 they even opened for the Bee Gees.\n\nFor years he worked as session guitarist and road-dog backing the likes of Stephanie Mills, Phyllis Hyman, and Whitney Houston. He opened for Eric Clapton at London’s Royal Albert Hall.\n\nNo wonder that his acoustic blues reflects all that. Soulful, bluesy, with jazz chords, call it a “blues infused” amalgam. In any given set he’ll play Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff and Jimi Hendrix, Robert Johnson and Taj Mahal songs along with his own blues compositions on his mahogany Martin and National resonator guitars. He described his music as “The mood … will take you on a ride from New Orleans to the Caribbean and drop you off somewhere in the Delta, with stops along the way.”\n\nThe songwriting bard told thecountryblues.com, “I play blues with a different groove and I like everything from reggae to Brazilian music. During my Brazilian phase I played a nylon string guitar. I switched to steel string guitar and went to a period of loving Richie Havens, Bill Withers and Ben Harper. I also love the deep blues of Robert Johnson and Taj Mahal. Blues to me is folk music from a particular group of people, whereas old country music is folk music for another group of people. It’s all music for people having a good time. I don’t label myself as a blues musician but I am rooted in the blues with different influences, of blues, reggae and soul music. That’s why they call it “roots music” after all. I just want to spread a good message. When people hear me play, I want them to feel good at that moment, to feel like someone else understands what they are going through. You can feel alienated in this world. Music should be uplifting.”\n\nHis own fiery compositions pack a punch and he wrote some fierce blues songs that will grab anyone’s heart and soul. The song “True Blue” that he wrote for the multi-Grammy winner George Benson was noticed by The Song Writers Hall of Fame, which bestowed him the Abe Olman Scholarship Award for Songwriting in 2007. Another composition “Like A Soldier” was used in the national television series, The Injustice Files. His powerful blues song “Woke Up Cryin’ ” (see the video below) made Falcon a semi-finalist in the International Songwriters Competition, as well landing him a nomination in the blues category of the Independent Music Awards.\n\nHe plays mostly around the New York region, with occasional trips to New Orleans. He’s a regular at top local venues: The Falcon, Daryl’s House in Pawling, The Turning Point and The Towne Crier Café in New York. He frequently opens at big venues and he has opened shows for James Cotton Blues Band, Matt “Guitar” Murphy, The Wailers, Ruthie Foster, Jim Lauderdale, Tower of Power and many more. Adam Falcom also actively teaches in the Rockland Conservatory of Music.\n\nI watch guitarist Adam Falcon as he plays a song for me. “October Falls” captures the beauty of the moment when he first fell in love with his wife Kate. His slight frame leans over his guitar as a few rows of his of his long braids topple over his face. Raw emotion oozes from the man and guitar. His power over the music has left me spellbound.\n\nAdam had a good fortune as a teenager growing up in the early seventies. He took guitar lessons at the YMCA in Manhattan with Larry Lucie who used to play with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. He went on to study for three years with the infamous George Benson before George’s career took off. By the time George signed a record deal with Warner Brothers, Adam was ready for his own journey.\n\nAt twenty-one-years-old, Adam got a job with a group of four singers called Revelation and they toured with the Bee Gees. His greatest moment came six years later when the instrumental song he wrote “In Search of a Dream” was accepted by producer Arif Mardin for inclusion on George Benson’s Grammy-nominated album In Your Eyes. Adam became well-recognized in the music circuit. He worked with artists like Phyllis Hyman, Sophie B. Hawkins, Robert Palmer, Will Downing and Jonathan Butler. He also toured with Roberta Flack, someone he’d admired ever since his mother took him to see her in Central Park.\n\nIn 1988, Adam played in Europe with Jonathan Butler at Eric Clapton’s Twenty-fifth Anniversary. On the plane coming back, Adam made the decision to quit touring so he could focus on his songwriting. He blazed a trail, using his talents and the experience he learned from all those years on the road. “I’m happier now than I’ve ever been. I love where I am with the music. I know who I am as an artist and I’m growing. If people can walk away from hearing me play with a good feeling-the way I feel when I’m playing-then my job is complete.”\n\nAdam’s musical style has two major influences - the music aired on WNEW-FM radian from 1968 to 1970 combined with the added the pulse of today’s music. With no definable genre, he has created a sound all his own- an eclectic mix of soul, rock & roll, country, jazz, and the blues.\n\nBohemian 959 is Adam’s third solo album. The three numbers reference the address of the house where he was raised in the Bronx. This record took seven years to make and is based upon stories about Adam’s life during that period. The song “Better Days” concerns an inspiring conversation Adam had with three firemen who volunteered to help after the collapse of the World Trade Center. “Waves” was influenced by the fact that Adam’s mother died before she knew his wife was pregnant. “I was in the Caribbean when my Mom passed. Before coming home for the funeral, I went down to the beach and felt I heard Mom’s voice speaking through the waves. It was the beginning of a song about one life going out and another life coming in.”\n\nSince 2003, Adam has been teaching at the Rockland Conservatory of Music. His six-year-old daughter takes piano lessons there, as well. He loves the fact that it’s a community-based school, which offers scholarships, affordable lessons, and rehearsal and concert space. “Just to be around this environment of top-notch amazing teachers-it’s great to be part of it.”\n\nExecutive Director of the Rockland Conservatory of Music, Marigene Kettler, speaks of Adam’s success as a teacher. “Adam’s love of music and education of the guitar is so infectious that students and colleagues alike can’t help but be joyfully affected. There’s nobody who comes away from a concert or a conversation with Adam that isn’t grinning from ear to ear. He’s also the coolest guy I know.”\n\nA ukulele leans against the fireplace in Adam’s living room. He bought it for his three-year-old son after the child crooned over it in a music store. Adam speaks of a time when he was his son’s age. My dad, who is from New Orleans, bought me a plastic guitar because I watched Chuck Berry perform on TV. Gene Autry was another one of Adam’s idols at that time. “I was obsessed with being a cowboy. When I saw Gene Autry on TV with his guitar and cowboy boots, I thought, ‘There it is. Two for one. I can be a cowboy and play guitar!’” As far as I can see, Adam has fulfilled his dream.\n\nby: David Mitchell\n\nSinger, songwriter, guitarist Adam Falcon continues to assert his influence as an independent recording artists with this release of his third solo album, Bohemian 959 (Ghetto Drum Records). According to Falcon, many of his musician friends gave up their time to contribute to this album including a number of fellow SESAC writers like K.J. Denhert (contributing vocals on “Going Back for More”), Martha Redbone (performing background vocals on several songs), and singer Marc Nelson from the 90s boy-band Az Yet (contributing vocals on the song “Like A Soldier”).\n\nNona Hendryx wrote the albums first single “Sunshine Woke Me Up This Morning,” back in the day as a member of LaBelle. Falcon re-recorded it for Bohemian 959 with Ms. Hendryx as his duet partner. The album’s only other cover tune is an inspiring remake of the Jackson 5’s “I Wanna Be Where You Are” ; with the remaining songs all penned by Falcon himself, and Trevor Gale as producer. That’s no typo! SESAC Vice President of Writer - Publisher Relations Trevor Gale, an amazing musician in his own rite, plays drums on two cuts and produced the entire album.\n\nSoul, jazz, rock, alternative; all elements you feel in Falcon’s songs. “I’ve got a good feeling about this record,” says Falcon. “This album is more soulful and moves in a funkier direction. It was a labor of love for us, and is something I think people will really enjoy. It is gritty and truly from the heart.”\n\nOf course there is an explanation behind the unique title, Bohemian 959. The numbers 959 represent the address where Falcon grew up in the Bronx. His residence was like a meeting ground where musicians in the neighborhood would often come and play. In the spirit of his childhood home, a New York City loft was converted into a studio for the recording of Bohemian 959. Some of the best musicians were brought together within one room and tab the same time to record the album live.\n\nFalcon, now a father of two toddlers, a girl (3) and a boy (1 1/2), has generated quite a following with his previous works: Piece of Mine, and I, too, am Colored, in Black & White. He is appreciated by numerous icons in the business, like multi-Grammy winner George Benson who recorded two of his compositions, “In Search of a Dream” (produced by Arif Mardin), and “True Blue” (produced by Tommy LiPuma). Falcon has toured as a guitarist with the likes of Phyllis Hyman, Jonathan Butler, Will Downing, Sophie B. Hawkins and Roberta Flack.\n\n“Adam Falcon is one of those artist whose music speaks to the very core of human emotions,” says Trevor Gale. “His passion takes you from where you were to where you wanna be. It is true soul music!\""
