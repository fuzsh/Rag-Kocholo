Top Gun actress Kelly McGillis has married longtime girlfriend Melanie Leis in a civil union in Collingswood, New Jersey.

The two met 10 years ago when Leis was a bartender at a restaurant owned by McGillis and her husband at the time, Fred Tillman.

You may remember, McGillis came out back in 2009, saying, “That was one of those moments when somebody asked me a question, my kids had gone from home, so I really didn’t have to protect anyone by skirting the question, and I just decided to be absolutely honest.”

We’re so happy she found the courage to come out!

Congratulations to the happy couple!
