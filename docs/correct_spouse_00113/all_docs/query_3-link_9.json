In fact working out and taking 30min for myself daily has improved my ability to be a mother, spouse, employee, & self lover! \n\nI am a momma of two wonderful pups, two wonderful children w/ one on the way. 10 years ago I became a fur mom to probably the most loving pup (most people would disagree ðŸ˜‚ as she only loves me!). I then became a fur mom x2 to the sweetest gentlest soul, even though she knows she is a stickler for her dad she knows mom is the one who will spoil her ðŸ˜†. 9 years ago I was blessed w/ becoming a STEPmom and trust me when I say I love this boy as my own. He knows I will spoil him w/ hugs and kisses & feed him till his tummy is too bloated for more & we have to stop feeding him ðŸ˜‚! 4 years ago God blessed me with my literal pride and joy & I've been blessed again with another baby girl, whom I can't wait to snuggle up with ðŸ’œ Somewhere in the mix, at one point I was even a foster momma, to 3 beautiful girls! \n\nWearing all these hats has taught me that life is never easy and all MOM titles comes with their hardships but they also are so dang rewarding! I did in fact find out that sacrificing myself (ie not putting my own physical and mental health) does not prove I am a better mother or benefit my abilities in being a mother. If anything sacrificing myself wears me down, makes me unhappy, has me struggling with energy, & forces me to fake it till I make it. \n\nIt wasn't until I decided MY life was just as valuable as the ones I was taking care of that I TRULY BEGAN to be a mother & take care of my little ones. Admitting that we mothers aren't perfect, we need help from others, & we need to put ourselves first is far from failing. It shows strength and vulnerability! It shows that WE MATTER! & if we can't take care of ourselves we can't take care of anyone else, because let's face it. What happens when mom's sick? (Leave that for you to answer yourself ðŸ˜‚) \n\nMy team and I are running a group next month for MOTHER'S DAY, where we help women find that hidden source of EMPOWERMENT & find themselves again! \n\nDM me for more info!  #athomeworkouts\".",
