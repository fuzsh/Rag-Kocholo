        "text": "It’s been 30 years since the epic film Top Gun was released, but while you’d still recognise Tom Cruise anywhere, his leading lady is flying much more under the radar.\n\nIn fact, you’d probably barely recognise her!\n\nScroll down for video\n\nKelly McGillis played the flight instructor in the 1986 hit flick who fell in love with cheeky fighter pilot Maverick.\n\nWhile Cruise was catapulted to super stardom, McGillis has lived a much more low-key life.\n\nThe now 58-year-old has ditched the blonde curly locks and embraces her natural shade. After Top Gun, she appeared in dozens of TV shows and movies through the ‘90s but took a break for a few years.\n\nIt was then she started doing plays in the theatre. She was married twice and has two daughters Kelsey and Sonora, and in 2009, she announced she was a lesbian.\n\nThe next year Kelly went into a civil union with Melanie Leis but they broke up a year later.\n\nShe later admitted to have struggled with drugs and alcohol for a time before getting sober.\n\nKelly now teaches acting at The New York Studio for Stage and Screen in North Carolina, US."
