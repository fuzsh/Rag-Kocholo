        "text": "Melanie Leis rose to fame following her marriage to actress Kelly McGillis. Their subsequent divorce, however, left the public and media curious about the details. Till today, people continue to show interest in the affair and want to know why the relationship crashed.\n\nSo, Who is Melanie Leis?\n\nMelanie Leis biography\n\nBorn in 1967, Melanie Leis is widely recognised as the former partner of the renowned actress Kelly McGillis. Leis is from the United States of America and has carved her path as a sales executive and theatre artist.\n\nLeis studied at the Berklee College of Music, where she graduated with a degree in Arts, Music Production, and Performance. Additionally, she holds an associate degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management from Newbury College, England.\n\nOne of her notable talents lies in her musical abilities. Starting at the young age of six, she learnt how to play the piano. As time went on, she expanded her repertoire and ventured into playing the drums. Alongside her musical endeavours, Leis found her calling in the world of theatre. With her passion for performance, she dedicated herself to mastering the craft.\n\nBeyond her artistic pursuits, Leis excelled in the realm of sales. Utilising her innate communication skills, she pursued a career as a sales executive. As a multi-talented individual, she has embraced her passion for music, theatre, and sales, leaving a mark in each niche.\n\nMelanie Leis career\n\nLeis began her career in September 2001 when she joined Cingular Wireless (AT&T) as a retail manager. While at the company, she led a retail team and gained valuable experience in the telecommunications industry.\n\nFollowing her successful stint at Cingular Wireless, Leis ventured into the world of PC Management from February 2004 to January 2008. This role allowed her to expand her expertise and excel in the field of technology management.\n\nHer next career move saw her move to Sovereign Bank, where she worked as a portfolio specialist until May 2009. She gained valuable insights into the financial sector and contributed to the success of the organisation.\n\nALSO READ: Taelyn Dobson: Embracing a private life amidst sibling’s stardom\n\nLeis then joined Simply Wireless/Mobile Now as a Dist. Sales Manager. She was on the move again in 2010 as she joined Retail Business Development as a market launch team member.\n\nLeis’ career path continued to evolve as she explored new avenues for professional growth. She made valuable contributions to Independence Communications, Broadview Networks, All Covered Inc., Society Grownups, Vendeni, PD Corp and Tappit.\n\nIn 2021, Leis joined Tappit, assuming the role of vice president. As a vital member of the Tappit team, Leis plays a pivotal role in driving the company’s growth and success.\n\nMelanie Leis’ net worth\n\nAccording to reports, Leis has an estimated net worth of $600,000.\n\nMelanie Leis family\n\nLeis has not revealed any information about her parents and siblings to the public.\n\nComing to her personal life, Leis is the ex-spouse of the American actress Kelly McGillis. The couple got married in 2010 and divorced the following year in 2011.\n\nMelanie Leis and Kelly McGillis\n\nMelanie Leis and Kelly McGillis’ love story have left fans asking the question, what went wrong? McGillis is an American actress known for her roles in popular films such as Top Gun and Witness.\n\nShe gained recognition for her talent and amazing performances. Despite her success in the film industry, McGillis has faced personal challenges and experienced a tumultuous relationship with Leis.\n\nThe couple crossed paths for the first time at a restaurant in Florida. In an interview with the New York Times in September 2010, Leis recounted their initial meeting in 2000 at a local bar in West Florida.\n\nShe said: “I started working at the restaurant while Kell was out-of-town working on a movie. One day I looked up, and there she was. I did not see her from across the room or anything like that…Her presence, not the image of who she is professionally, but her sense of humour, absolutely grabbed me”.\n\nMcGillis, at the time, was married to Mr. Tillman, and the couple had two daughters, Kelsey Lauren and Sonora Ashley. According to the actress, her marriage was in a bad state at that time. One evening, shortly after meeting at a bar, she and Leis went out with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday.\n\n“We just started talking, and I was attracted to her,” McGillis recalled.\n\nAfter their initial connection, they began dating and fell into a harmful cycle. In Leis’ words: “We were partners in crime and were both drinking and abusing drugs.\n\nALSO READ: Aurora Culpo: Reality star whose husband’s infidelity ended their marriage\n\n“It was a challenging time, both of us newly sober and trying to learn how to live life differently.”\n\nBy 2001, they were staying in Mohnton, Pa. Nevertheless, despite McGillis and Leis being in a relationship, there were no photographs of them together.\n\nRegrettably, McGillis’s relationship with Leis had a significant negative impact on her children.\n\nMcGillis said: “My kids suffered a great deal because I was with Mell, and that bothered me a lot, and so I never chose to talk about it.”\n\nLeis and McGillis ended their relationship in 2009. Their breakup was an incredibly difficult period for Leis, who described it as “the absolute worst time of my life”. She had been sober for six years but found herself hitting rock bottom. Leis realised that her problems stemmed from her reluctance to confront and address her deep-rooted issues.\n\nWhile she was actively working on herself, Leis reached out to McGillis through a heartfelt letter and later paid a visit to the actress’ new residence in Collingswood, which is situated in the U.S. state of New Jersey. McGillis, however, remained uncertain about whether she could trust Leis and allow her back into her life.\n\nOver time, McGillis began to acknowledge her feelings of missing Leis and the kind-heartedness she possessed. She confessed that she was still in love with her, appreciating her compassionate nature and her ability to love others unconditionally. McGillis valued Leis for her genuine openness. As a result, they rekindled their romance.\n\nLeis and McGillis chose to get married in their second attempt at a relationship. Leis proposed to the actress, and she agreed to give it another shot. They got married on September 15, 2010. The ceremony was attended by eleven friends, including McGillis’ ex-husband, Tillman.\n\nLeis and McGillis, however, ended their relationship in 2011. The exact reason for their breakup has not been disclosed to date, leaving fans to speculate.\n\nMelanie Leis age\n\nLeis was born on July 9, 1967. She is currently 55 years old and will be 56 years old in 2023.\n\nMelanie Leis now\n\nMelanie Leis lives in Boston, Massachusetts, and is currently involved in managing ticketing and organising music festival events.\n\nShe also actively supports different fundraising initiatives, using her Facebook page as a platform to raise awareness and gather support. Leis has chosen to keep her life away from the public eye, despite enjoying fame while she was married to a celebrity."
