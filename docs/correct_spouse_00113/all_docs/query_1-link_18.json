        "text": "Kelly McGillis has found someone who takes her breath away!\n\nThe actress — who romanced Tom Cruise onscreen in 1986's Top Gun — wed girlfriend Melanie Leis in a civil union on Wednesday in Collingswood, NJ, the New York Times reports.\n\nMcGillis and Muzak sales executive Leis, 42, met in 2000 in Key West, Fla.; Leis was a bartender at a restaurant owned by McGills and her second husband Fred Tillman.\n\nThe star has been divorced twice and has two daughters with Tillman: Kelsey, 20, and Sonora, 17. The star announced that she was a lesbian in 2009 during an interview with SheWired.com.\n\nMcGillis told the New York Times this week of last year's surprise \"coming out\": \"That was one of those moments when somebody asked me a question, my kids had gone from home, so I really didn't have to protect anyone by skirting the question, and I just decided to be absolutely honest.\""
