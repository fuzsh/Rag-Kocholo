        "text": "READ THIS STORY IN THE MAGAZINE\n\n\"I need more Stevie Wonder documentaries,\" says Brittany Howard, repeating, as if singing a refrain, \"I need more Stevie Wonder biographies. I need more about Stevie Wonder's life, you know what I'm saying? Because yes, he's an icon, but still, the younger generation really needs to know more about who Stevie Wonder is and how long he's been good. He's been exceptional since he was a child. Some of the stuff he's doing with his music, to this day, is still ahead of his time. Still! It's incredible. And it teaches me so much every time I listen to it.\"\n\nSEE THIS COVER STORY IN THE MAGAZINE\n\nBen Platt has been openly gay since at least the launch of his recording career five years ago. He's also essentially been out now for more than half of his life. Yet the 30-year-old artist and actor -- known for his work in Dear Evan Hansen, Pitch Perfect, and The Politician, to name only three prominent titles -- has never been quite as out and proud, nor as self-assured in his queer identity and sense of purpose, as he is now. It's what makes his newly released third album, Honeymind, so captivating and compelling.\n\nREAD THIS STORY IN THE MAGAZINE\n\nAsk Jim Rash what it's like to work with Scarlett Johansson, and he visibly swoons.\n\n\"How much time do we have?\" he says. \"I was in heaven. I didn't know her. And I didn't know Channing , either. But they were genuinely funny and lovely. And the tone that they both set the stage with was just joy.\"\n\nRash co-stars with Johansson and Tatum in Fly Me to the Moon, a winsome, modern-day screwball about the faking of the 1969 moon landing, directed by Greg Berlanti (Love, Simon). Rash plays Lance Vespertine, a high-strung diva of a director hired to create the landing on a soundstage as a backup, in case the actual landing goes bust."
