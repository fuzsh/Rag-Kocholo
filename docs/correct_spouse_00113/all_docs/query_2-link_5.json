        "text": "The Accused was actually conceived as a vehicle for her. She had her choice of roles. (picked the wrong one.)\n\nI think she may have even had costar approval.\n\nWitness in 85, The Accused in 88 and that was about it.\n\nQuite strong-looking (okay, mannish, if you will), but striking. She always seemed to be of another era--like Stanwyck and those other strong women of the 1930s-50s. Kathleen Turner was very much the same way. Even Deborah Winger, to an extent.\n\nI don't think things have turned out too badly for Kelly. She's made her choices. She may have wanted more longevity in her career, but I seriously doubt she misses all the crap that went with it.\n\nPretty girls in the 80s were endlessly disposable and forgotten, regardless of talent, and here we are discussing her.\n\nThanks, IMDB.com!\n\nOwner of restaurant \"Kelly's\" in Key West, Florida.\n\nListed as one of twelve \"Promising New Actors of 1984\" in John Willis' Screen World, Vol. 36.\n\nWanted to play the role of \"Kathryn Murphy\", the district attorney in The Accused (1988), because she and her roommate were assaulted and raped by two men in their apartment in 1982.\n\nClaimed that she was a lonely, overweight adolescent.\n\nStudied at Pacific Conservatory of Performing Arts and Juilliard.\n\nWas fired from the film Bachelor Party (1984) allegedly because the producers thought she wasn't pretty or sexy enough.\n\nKelly McGillis actually had to return to employment waiting tables after having been a prominent character in an Oscar nominated film (her first movie, Reuben Reuben).\n\nAuditioned for the role of Catherine Tramell in Basic Instinct (1992).\n\nIn April, 2009 Kelly McGillis confirmed long-held rumors that she's a lesbian, according to an interview on the website shewired.\n\nIs also a professional counselor, primarily concerning substance abuse.\n\nThe New York Times reported that on September 15, 2010, Kelly McGillis and Melanie Leis had a civil union performed in Collingswood, New Jersey, by Judge Robert T. Zane III. Melanie Leis is a sales executive.\n\nMet former partner Melanie Leis in 2000, while McGillis was still married to her second husband Fred Tillman.\n\nGave birth to her 1st child at age 32, a daughter Kelsey Lauren Tillman on May 24, 1990. Child's father is her 2nd husband, Fred Tillman.\n\nGave birth to her 2nd child at age 35, a daughter Sonora Ashley on April 10, 1993. Child's father is her 2nd husband, Fred Tillman.\n\nCurrently working in The Graduate as Mrs. Robinson on Broadway. [November 2004]\n\nPerforming on stage as \"Mrs. Robinson\" in the national touring company of the play \"The Graduate.\" [March 2004]\n\nShe has English, Welsh, Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), and German ancestry.\n\nAs of June 2016, now lives in Henderson County, North Carolina.\n\nShe lost out on the role of Madame de Tourvel twice. The first time was in 1987 in the stage drama \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\" with other American actors Glenn Close and Kevin Spacey, where they would have replaced the acclaimed English cast, but the show closed since producers feared soft box-office because of the cast change. (This was before Close and Spacey became household names.) The second time was in 1988 in the film Dangerous Liaisons (1988) when film critic Pauline Kael talked the film's director Stephen Frears into dropping McGillis in favor of Michelle Pfeiffer, who earned an Academy Award nomination, as did Close who was cast this time, because of her star-making performance in Fatal Attraction (1987).\n\nI would think the horrifying rape moment would be a huge piece of where all her decision making must reside. She went through anyone's worst nightmare. And was an acting student at Juilliard at the time this happened. I would think this would taint NYC to a degree for her, as well as that whole young time in her life, which was the beginning of her career.\n\nAlso, not everyone who becomes a star finds that lifestyle and that hyper-crazy focus on career works for them. It always seems to the public that the career left them, when sometimes people leave their careers. Because we are such a fame and celebrity obsessed culture we never imagine someone could or would walk away from stardom of any sort. I think she honestly did. I can't believe there weren't or aren't projects she could work on. I don't think she wants that life is all.\n\nAnd she looks good now. Her face isn't botched or frozen. And she can eat as much key lime pie as she wants.\n\nIt was over for Winger when she refused to sign her contract for A League of their Own. (and not over Madonna being in it.) She had all these demands and it went right down to the wire. I can remember the whole thing being covered daily in the trades. They gave her until five o'clock Friday to show up for the film and sign her contract. When she didn't (I think she expected Penny Marshall to side with her but she didn't) they had Geena Davis on a plane the next day and the movie went off without a hitch, was a hit and Winger was done.\n\nI went to college and then worked in Washington DC after graduation in the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s. Sometime in the late 1980s, I was in a bar on Capitol Hill enjoying drinks one night with a group of friends. Kelly McGillis was doing a Shakespeare play in town. She came in and was seated at the next table. She was with some guys. We let her be, but she did smile and nod hello, as I recall. Then again, I was looking more at the guys she was with. One was really good-looking. I remember what he looked like more than her."
