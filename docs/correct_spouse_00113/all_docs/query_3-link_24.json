        "text": "Have you been stuck and unable to move on from the narcissist?\n\nIf this is where you’re at, let me be straight with you – there is an important reason for not being able to move on and it is based on a BIG LIE.\n\nI believed this lie for a long time, I fell for it too but now I know better and I will never buy into it again.\n\nWatch my latest Thriver TV episode to find out why this big lie limits you and how to totally break free from it. Your liberation from the narcissist (no matter who they are in your life) is waiting for you on the other side of this!\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nToday, I want to talk to you about the big lie, the number one reason why you can’t move on from the narcissist.\n\nLet’s get straight down to it, as well as why it sets up a whole other host of lies that are not allowing you to access your True Self and your True Life.\n\nIt’s this, “The narcissist, this person, I want them to be a healthy person in my life who loves me.” That’s the lie, and it keeps you hooked. It stops you moving on. It keeps you in false hope where you can continue to be abused, disappointed, mind-energy drained, and kept separate from the life and the love that will truly gratify you in your future.\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether this person is a lover, spouse, family member, friend, or any narcissist in your life who you are hooked into because they are robbing you of your Life Force.\n\nWhy This Big Lie Limits You\n\nLet’s explore this a little deeper, why this is so damaging and why it limits you so much to have a great life. Because your lies about them that, “They can be a good person who I can be healthy and happy with,” actually end up becoming lies about yourself.\n\nBecause if you don’t have a present, committed person, committed to being in a healthy relationship with you (meaning that they have the capacity and the desire to grant safety, care and love); and if they’re not a character of integrity or care or kindness, and they’re not wanting to openly work at being a team with you to create solutions in time of conflict – then you don’t have a relationship.\n\nEvery relationship requires those baseline essential fundaments to be a real relationship. Every relationship, even a healthy relationship, needs the ability for teamwork and the desire to want to create solutions and validate and care and be kind regarding the other person. Without that stuff, there’s no real relationship.\n\nBy you lying to yourself about there being hope with this person – despite the real-life evidence and trauma that gets you to completely lower those values to accept somebody who’s got a defunct character, with neither the desire nor the capacity to meet you at a level of real relationship – you’re going to be damaged.\n\nWhen you’re damaged, what happens for all of us is inevitably the beliefs that you have about yourself are going to start becoming, “I’m unlovable. I’m unworthy of love. I can’t have true care, kindness, respect and love.”\n\nAnd even, “I’ll never recover from this, and I can’t create true love and have a fulfilling and wonderful life.” These are all lies. They’re not the truth of your Soul. They’re not the truth of what Source wants for you or what is even possible for you at all. Lies hurt, whereas the truth can set you free.\n\nInitially, when you accept the truth about the narcissist, that this is not a person that you can have a real and true relationship with, absolutely, it’s going to hurt but that acceptance can set you free to the true path of your Soul, which is the ability to heal and create a completely different relationship with yourself, which is a true relationship.\n\nThat’s the relationship you need first and foremost, where you can embody, align with and know that you are worthy of love, that you are lovable and you have the capacity and the ability, through knowing your values and your truths and being aligned with them, to generate real love through healthy and empowered choices and boundaries.\n\nThat can put you on the trajectory of creating a truly gratifying and healthy relationship, which I promise you that when you get there one day, you’re going to look back at the relationship you left, that you were lying to yourself about as we all did, and you’ll wonder how you ever did that relationship. That will be your life one day.\n\nLeading The Way With The Truth\n\nIt’s also so important to lead the way for your loved ones with the truth, and maybe if you’re a parent, you haven’t understood this. Of course, the truth, when you know you have to split up a relationship, or an association, or leave a job or whatever it is, can be really hard to accept and it can even be heartbreaking.\n\nBut you will continue to break down and lose your heart, your Soul and your Spirit until accepting the truth. I promise you, over the last 15 years, I’ve seen so many people continue to break down in their health, emotional, mental, physical, spiritual, and financial, until they accept the truth.\n\nThe truth is this, “This person is a False Self. I can’t have a real relationship and a life with this person. I have to leave.” It’s also not even about working out what this person is, such as are they a sociopath or a narcissist, or are they just selfish or are they just unavailable?\n\nI’m going to be really straight with you, that’s actually totally irrelevant. What is relevant is they don’t match the essential values that you need to hold, of kindness and care, and they don’t have integrity, and they don’t want to work at being a team to create solutions in time of conflict.\n\nSo, it doesn’t matter what flavour this person is because you don’t have a real or healthy relationship. Or maybe they’re just refusing to commit to you. Then you don’t have a real relationship, that’s the truth. Denying that truth not only keeps creating your own breakdown, it can also affect your children really negatively.\n\nI know it’s terrifying to think of ending relationships because of your children, and the fears are so numerous, they can be things like, “How will they be without the family, the home, their familiar things and their other parent or me full time? What will happen to them if they’re being co-parented with the narcissist and I’m not with them?”\n\nYet what we may not be realizing is that our children do what we do, not what we say. If they learn from us to not honour their own Souls and the truth, then they follow our footsteps of hanging onto unhealthy relationships. This will suck out their Life Force in the future as adults, rather than leaving and choosing their True Self and their True Life.\n\nThey too will go through the self-manifested lies of, “I’m unworthy of real love and decent treatment and I don’t have what it takes to honour my Soul and be the generative Source with Source as an adult in my body to create my own True Self and my True Life.”\n\nOf course, we want to reverse that example with our children. We all do because we want our children to be able to grow up and be empowered and choose their Soul and choose their happiness and their expansion and their success and their truth, and their honour, their self-honor, and they only need one thriving, empowered parent to be that example. Then they won’t, as adults, sell their own Souls out for dependencies that aren’t serving their truth.\n\nIt’s really interesting because I’ve worked with so many adults that have had the narcissistic parent and the codependent parent who self-sacrificed and stayed for the kids, and there was a lot of pain and trauma with that – the parent didn’t stand up for themselves and didn’t stand up for the kids and didn’t lead by example.\n\nI promise you, your children are not going to feel a loyalty to you for doing that. Of course, we can keep healing if we do decide to leave or break up the relationship, keep healing ourselves, lead the way by example and parallel parent. I really suggest you Google my name and look up parallel parenting if you haven’t already because it goes into great depth about how to do it successfully.\n\nI promise you that there are many parents in our community who are working with NARP and parallel parenting simultaneously. Their children are much more empowered and healthier, even with only 50% custody whilst parallel parenting than parents who are still in the household and the relationship with the narcissist. The children are doing much better.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nI hope that this has explained how the truth can set you free and that lie of, “I can make this work. Maybe they could get better. Maybe it’s going to be different in the future.”\n\nYour power is in what is happening now, in every minute of now – that’s the truth. That will set you free.\n\nI’d love you to have a look – if you want to understand all of this more deeply, and the Quantum truths to heal yourself – at my free two-part Masterclass. Included is a free healing to start getting your power back, become aligned with the truth and get freedom from the pain.\n\nIt’s going to help you so much. I really hope that this has helped explain things."
