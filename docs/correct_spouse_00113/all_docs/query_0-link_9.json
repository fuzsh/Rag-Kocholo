        "text": "Actress Kelly McGillis, best known for her role as Tom Cruise’s love interest in the 1986 blockbuster movie “Top Gun,” and Melanie Leis joined in a civil union in Collingswood, N.J. on Sept. 15, The New York Times reported.\n\nMcGillis, 53, who was previously married twice, met Leis, 42, in 2000 when the latter was a bartender at a restaurant that McGillis co-owned with her then-husband Fred Tillman. Both McGills and Tillman have two children: Kelsey, 20, and Sonora, 17.\n\nThe actress told SheWired.com in 2009 that she is a lesbian. In explaining that interview to The New York Times recently, McGillis said: “That was one of those moments when somebody asked me a question, my kids had gone from home, so I really didn’t have to protect anyone by skirting the question, and I just decided to be absolutely honest.”\n\nAside from “Top Gun,” McGillis has also appeared in other films such as “Witness” and “The Accused.” Her latest project is the horror film “Stake Land.”"
