But she says she’s actually been a lesbian most of her life. “I tried really hard not to be who I am. I tried super hard,” she says. “It was a difficult journey for me to come to terms and be whole and happy with who I am.”\n\nShe’s back in the spolight, with her new play The Little Foxes [opening May 29 at the Pasadena Playhouse]. The Little Foxes is McGillis’s return to acting after spending eight years as a full-time mom to her two children."
