        "text": "Kelly McGillis Weds Girlfriend Melanie Leis\n\nKelly McGillis, best know for her roles in 'Top Gun' and 'Witness,' married girlfriend Melanie Leis, 42, last Wednesday.\n\nThe two were legally joined in a civil union in New Jersey, two days before McGillis, 53, walked the red carpet with her new wedding ring at the Toronto Film Festival for her vampire film 'Stake Land.'\n\nThe pair, who met when Leis worked at a bar owned by McGillis and her second husband, shared their big day with the New York Times Weddings and Celebrations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple met in 2000, although apparently the romance started (or re-started) much more recently. McGillis came out last year and in May 2009 she told People that she was single.\n\n'I am single, and I'm really happy to be so. I was with somebody for eight years, and I just want to be single.'\n\nMcGillis in Toronto:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Our Partner"
