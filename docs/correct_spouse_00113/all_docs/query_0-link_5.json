        "text": "Some people think the third time is the charm. Kelly McGillis, on the other hand, is not in this category. The Top Gun actress has been married three times, the third being to Melanie Leis the shortest.\n\nMcGillis and Leis had many ups and downs during their time together, leading many to believe that they would stand the test of time. As anticipated, they were still going strong. Leis even referred to her ex-husband as the love of her life during an interview with INTIX. “I never imagined a few years ago that I would say it so simply, but now I say it with complete honesty,” Leis added. However, after a year of marriage, the couple divorced in 2011.\n\nKelly McGillis and her third husband battled addiction\n\nMcGillis and Leis met at Kelly’s, a pub owned by the actress and her then-husband, Fred Tillman, in 2000. “I started working at the restaurant when Kell was filming a movie,” Leis explained of the meeting. One day I looked up and there she was. “I didn’t see it from across the room.”\n\nShe went on to say that she had no idea she was an actress until they started talking and that she was struck by McGillis’ wicked sense of humor. One night, the two girls went out to celebrate a friend’s birthday. McGillis developed feelings for Leis as the two grew closer. They started dating shortly after, although it wasn’t the best relationship.\n\nThey drank and did drugs together. McGillis found solace in alcohol and narcotics after being raped when she was a Juilliard student in 1982. She thought she was being punished because she was gay. The couple realized they couldn’t continue living like this and finally woke up for the sake of McGillis’ two children.\n\nThey moved to Mohnton, Pennsylvania, but life was not as easy as they expected. McGillis continued to work, but his friendship with Leis had an impact on the lives of his children.\n\nKelly McGillis split from her husband\n\nMcGillis’ children welcomed her boyfriend, but her friends and her friends’ parents did not. During an interview with SheWired.com in February 2009, she came out as gay and stated that she wanted to be open about her sexual orientation.\n\nShe and Leis, on the other hand, were no longer together at that time. They divorced months before because their relationship “was no longer working.” “We evolve and change at different rates and at different times.” “I always wanted to be with Mell with all my heart and soul, but I wasn’t willing to stay until she was willing to work on herself,” McGillis explained.\n\nLeis described the breakup as the “worst time of his life” and added that he still had issues to resolve. After realizing she had made a mistake with McGillis, Leis asked for a second chance. McGillis, who could not forget Leis, finally relented and the couple married. They promised to adore each other, but news of their breakup was leaked in 2011. No one knows why and there has been no talk of the couple reuniting."
