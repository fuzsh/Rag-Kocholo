        "text": "Kelly McGillis does not currently have a spouse. The American actress, who had been married twice to two different men before coming out as a lesbian in 2009, was last in a civil union with Melanie Leis. McGillis and her wife were together for about a year before their union was dissolved.\n\nIs Kelly McGillis Married?\n\nKelly McGillis is no longer married. The American actress has previously been in three high-profile marital relationships since she made it to the limelight as an actress. Her first marriage was to Boyd Black from 1979 to 1981. About eight years after her divorce, she married Fred Tillman, and they were together from 1989 to 2002. Her last union came after she came out as a lesbian in 2009. She married Melanie Leis in 2010, and they divorced in 2011.\n\nKelly McGillis’ First Husband Was Boyd Black\n\nDuring her days at Juilliard School studying acting, Kelly Mcgillis met Boyd Black. Boyd was her fellow student at Julliard, and they fell in love not long after they met. They started dating in 1978, and on the following year, precisely on 14th April 1979, they tied the nuptial knot in a wedding ceremony. From the start, their marriage seemed to be a perfect one, but eventually ended in divorce.\n\nThe couple officially got divorced and went their separate ways in 1981. Since then, neither Boyd nor Kelly has openly talked about what actually led to the end of their marriage. Their union did not produce any children. Following their divorce, Boyd Black kept a very low profile about his love life while Kelly, who has a good part of her life in the limelight, went back to the dating world.\n\nFred Tillman Became Kelly McGillis’ Second Husband in 1989\n\nOn 15th January 1989, eight years after the end of her first marriage, Kelly Mcgillis got married to Fred Tillman. Fred is a yacht salesman from the United States of America. There is no information about where the two met but records have it that they met in 1988. Having gotten some experience in her first marriage, Kelly seemed to be more committed in her second marriage.\n\nShe accomplished a lot with Fred as they were jointly running a business in Key West, Florida where they resided. The husband and wife founded a restaurant business called Kelly’s Caribbean Bar and Grill. Together they also purchased a 110-foot schooner worth $1.5 million though it was later destroyed by fire in 1996.\n\nUnfortunately, the marriage still ended in divorce just after the arrival of their second daughter. Kelly Mcgillis and Fred Tillman divorced in 2002 after Fred was allegedly arrested for soliciting sex from an undercover police officer who is a prostitute in disguise. They were married for twelve years and eleven months and their marriage produced two daughters.\n\nTheir first daughter named Kelsey Tillman was born on 24th May 1990 and is currently 34 years old. On 10th April 1993, they welcomed their second daughter, Sonora Tillman. She is 31 at the moment. While there is no available information about Kelsey, Sonora is taking in the footsteps of her mother as an actress and has appeared in a good number of films.\n\nMoreso, Sonora is married to Jordan Garcia and they share two kids, making Kelly a grandmother. Meanwhile, Kelly Mcgillis was at the time of the divorce denied custody of her children given her addiction to alcohol and drugs.\n\nMelanie Leis is Kelly McGillis’ Third Spouse\n\nFollowing her divorce from Tillman, Kelly Mcgillis moved on with both her professional and romantic life. Also, the fact that she had been through two marriages and divorce made her a strong woman who was able to pick herself up and move on. Kelly met Melanie Leis in 2000 in Kelly’s Caribbean Bar and Grill, the restaurant she opened with her ex-husband, Tillman, in Florida.\n\nDuring that time, Melanie worked as a bartender in the restaurant. They began talking and in a short time, Kelly started growing affection for her. Melanie, on her own side, was impressed by Kelly’s good sense of humor and both of them fell in love with each other. They got more close, attended events together, and as well, engaged in drug and alcohol abuse. Melanie would later propose to Kelly and she said yes.\n\nThe duo got married on 15th September 2010 under a civil union in New Jersey and later moved to Mohnton Pa Pennsylvania. The wedding ceremony was a private one, attended by only 11 of their friends, including Kelly’s ex-husband, Fred Tillman. The ex-lovers seemed to have a perfect union at the beginning, even though their friends and families were not in support of the union.\n\nHowever, their relationship hit the rocks in 2011, just a year after their wedding. Both of them saw that the union was no longer working out and decided to go their separate ways. They didn’t reveal the actual reason for their separation. Since then, it remains unclear what the actress’s love life looks like.\n\nKelly McGillis and Tom Cruise’s Relationship\n\nKelly McGillis and Tom Cruise did not have a romantic relationship outside of their roles in a movie. Kelly famously played the actor’s love interest in the original Top Gun. The two were a match made in heaven in the movie, but their onscreen chemistry did not translate into anything further, as they did not have a romantic relationship in real life.\n\nIs Kelly McGillis Gay?\n\nKelly McGillis is gay. She came out publicly in 2009 to declare that she is lesbian. She made this known in an interview she granted with SheWeird.com. In the interview, the actress expressed that she had long wanted to be honest about her sexual orientation because she had been attracted to women since the age of 12 and throughout her high school days.\n\nBut she was not able to embrace it because she thought that God would punish her for being lesbian. However, she has now summoned up the courage to let the world know about it. She has since then stuck to her sexual orientation as a lesbian and does not talk about changing.\n\nWhere is Kelly McGillis Now?\n\nSince the crash of her third marriage with Leis, Kelly Mcgillis has been keeping away from the spotlight, especially in regard to her love and relationship life. She might be single at the moment as there is no dating or marriage news about her. The actress seems to be entirely focused on her career as an actress and performing arts teacher.\n\nKelly is a teacher who teaches aspiring actors and actresses with the knowledge and experience she has gained over her three decades of acting. Currently living in North Carolina, She spends the bulk of her time on stage and in classrooms.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Kelly McGillis Gay?\n\nKelly McGillis is gay. The legendary American actress, who had previously been married to men, revealed she was lesbian in 2009 during an interview with SheWired. She would go on to marry a woman in the following year, but their relationship was dissolved."
