        "text": "Shortly before the news broke last week that Donald Trump would, in fact, be indicted, we learned that Melania Trump was reportedly still angry about her husband’s alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels and did not “sympathize” with the fact that he was facing criminal charges and possibly even time in prison. Now that the ex-president has been formally charged—with 34 class E felonies—and is looking at a potential century-plus behind bars if convicted on all counts, the question is whether the former first lady still feels that way. After all, it’s one thing to tell your spouse they made their bed and must now lie in it when you think there’s no chance of their becoming a convicted criminal—it’s another when they’re actually forced to surrender and could spend the rest of your marriage behind bars. Melania, of course, has not said anything publicly about the matter—but one hint that she may not be too broken up about all this? Maybe the fact that she skipped her husband’s post-arraignment speech last night.\n\nYes, following her decision to not accompany the ex-president when he appeared in court on Tuesday, the former first lady chose not to show up for Trump’s rambling remarks at Mar-a-Lago later that day, despite literally living on-site. Another no-show was Ivanka Trump, and while that was pretty much to be expected, the former first daughter still got a shout-out from her dad when he listed his “great” family members. “I have a son here who’s done a great job, and I have another son here who’s done a great job…and Tiffany and Ivanka. And Barron will be great someday. He’s tall. He is tall and he’s smart,” Trump said last night, adding: “But I have a great family and they’ve done a fantastic job, and we appreciate it very much. They’ve gone through hell.” Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Tiffany Trump were all present, as were their respective partners, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Lara Trump, and Michael Boulos.\n\nDuring her time as first lady, Melania made it pretty clear that she despised her husband. So it’s possible she’s downright thrilled at the prospect of his doing 136 years in prison and thus spent last night celebrating.\n\nAnyway, speaking of Trump’s speech, it was unsurprisingly chock-full of lies and conspiracy theories. On Wednesday, after pleading not guilty to all 34 felony charges, the ex-president and current 2024 presidential candidate declared that congressional Republicans should “defund” the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation until the agencies “come to their senses.” Which we assume means “take over the Manhattan district attorney’s office and make it drop its case against me.”"
