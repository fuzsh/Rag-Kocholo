        "text": "Kelly McGillis took our breath away in the first Top Gun film, playing flight instructor Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood – the older and wiser woman trying to tame her reckless student, Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, played by Tom Cruise.\n\nBut, unfortunately, McGillis wasn't invited to reprise her role in the sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, which is released in cinemas this week, 36 years after the original.\n\nLet's take a look at what McGillis is up to now and why she was not asked to return for the highly anticipated sequel…\n\nREAD MORE: Kourtney Kardashian marries Travis Barker in Italy wedding\n\nIs Kelly McGillis in Top Gun: Maverick?\n\nFans of the action film are not the only ones left wondering why Kelly McGillis would not reprise her role as Charlie in the film estimated to have cost US$150 million ($212 million) to make – FYI, that's 10 times the budget of the original movie.\n\nREAD MORE: What to know about Australia's new 'first lady' Jodie Haydon\n\nMcGillis herself wanted answers as to why she was mysteriously missing in the second instalment, wondering if it had something to do with her appearance now aged 64.\n\n\"I'm old, and I'm fat, and I look age-appropriate for what my age is. And that is not what that whole scene is about,\" she told Entertainment Tonight in 2019.\n\nHowever, McGillis remains unfazed by Hollywood's apparent stance on age and appearance.\n\n\"To me, I'd much rather feel absolutely in my skin and who I am at my age as opposed to placing a value on all that other stuff,\" she added.\n\nWhy is Kelly McGillis not in Top Gun: Maverick?\n\nIn the lead up to the sequel's release on May 26, director Joseph Kosinski revealed why Kelly McGillis and fellow original star, Meg Ryan – who portrayed the wife of Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (played by Anthony Edwards) – were not asked back to the sequel.\n\nSpeaking to The Insider earlier this month, Kosinski explained that he wanted to move the story along and the original characters did not have a place in the new narrative.\n\n\"Those weren't stories that we were throwing around,\" the director told the outlet. \"I didn't want every storyline to always be looking backwards. It was important to introduce some new characters.\"\n\nPlus, it makes sense that after three decades Charlie and Maverick have grown apart and moved on with their lives.\n\nREAD MORE: Scottish man travels 7,563kms for Tinder date\n\nSo Kosinski cast Jennifer Connelly as Cruise's romantic lead, Penny Benjamin, in the sequel. Penny was briefly mentioned in the original film as the 'Admiral's daughter', who Maverick apparently had relations with prior to attending the Top Gun school.\n\n\"So glad that she got that opportunity,\" McGillis said of Connelly, 51. \"I'm glad for her.\"\n\nWho is returning for Top Gun: Maverick?\n\nOne original castmate who is back for the sequel is Val Kilmer.\n\nThe actor sadly lost vocal capacity after battling throat cancer in 2014 and undergoing a tracheotomy, but his health issues were not going to stop him from reprising his role as Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky.\n\nAnd it was Kilmer, 62, who \"begged\" producers to recast him as there was no Top Gun without Iceman.\n\n\"Tom was Maverick, but Maverick's nemesis was Iceman. The two went together like salt and pepper,\" Kilmer wrote in his 2020 memoir, I'm Your Huckleberry.\n\n\"It didn't matter that the producers didn't contact me. As The Temptations sang in the heyday of Motown soul, 'Ain't too proud to beg.'\"\n\nIn the sequel, Iceman has risen in the ranks to become Commander of the US Pacific Fleet. A pivotal scene involving Cruise is one that will pull at the heartstrings as artificial voice technology was used in post-production to give Kilmer the ability to speak during his brief appearance.\n\nWhere is Kelly McGillis now?\n\nAlthough McGillis has appeared in various projects on both TV (One Life to Live and Sweet Revenge) and on the big screen over the years (Witness, At First Sight and The Accused), she has lived a relatively quiet life in North Carolina, where spends time with her two adult children she shares with ex-husband Fred Tillman.\n\nShe was also married to Boyd Black in the '70 and her ex-wife, executive producer Melanie Leis, from 2010 to 2011.\n\nMcGillis has explained in the past that she was \"on a journey to figure out who the hell\" she was while she \"got sober\".\n\nREAD MORE: What happened to Bec Hewitt?\n\n\"It was very challenging for me to have any kind of sense of self or self-identity or real self-worth other than what I did for a living,\" she told ET. \"And it just – it didn't become a priority; what became the priority initially was raising my girls and being the best sober parent I could be.\"\n\n\"I think just my priorities in life changed,\" she continued. \"It wasn't like a major decision that I made to leave, it was just that other things became more important. I love acting, I love what I do, I love doing theatre, but I don't know. To me, my relationships to other people became far more important than my relationship to fame.\"\n\nWhat is Kelly McGillis doing now?\n\nMcGillis says she made a good call to live far from the glare of Hollywood.\n\nIn 2018, McGillis was diagnosed with alpha one antitrypsin disease, a condition that could cause lung and liver problems. The actress said this is one of the reasons she stays home and focuses on self-care.\n\n\"I am a home person. I'm really rooted in my home life,\" she said in her ET interview. \"I feel really blessed that I don't have to work, you know? But I get the option to work, so I'm really blessed in that way. Not many people get that option later in life, so I feel very lucky.\"\n\nWhat is Kelly McGillis' relationship like with Tom Cruise now?\n\nIt seems the actress and her former co-star have not remained in touch over the years.\n\n\"Movies are odd things. I don't really keep in touch with anybody,\" she said in a previous interview. \"I think I've spoken to a couple of people occasionally, but the truth is, movies are very odd work situations because you have a lot of people who come together from all different parts of the world.\"\n\nSo will she tune into the sequel?\n\n\"I guess it depends on what kind of reviews it gets,\" she said in 2019. \"I'm not racing to the theatre, and I'm not racing away from theatre to see it. It's not on my little list of things that I'd like to get done.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
