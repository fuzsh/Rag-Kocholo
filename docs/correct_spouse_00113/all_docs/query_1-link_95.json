A lot. If Mel touched me in public, I would just freak out and go, 'Don't do that - stay 20 feet away from me'.\n\n\"It was also a burden on my children - it got to the point where [daughter] Sonora wouldn't allow Mel and me to come to her football matches together because she was so embarrassed.\n\n\"People say, 'Why didn't you come out earlier?' I just thought it would be incredibly selfish to put my kids through that misery because of something that I needed to do for me.\"\n\nHowever, she said that her attempts to cover up her relationship were more destructive than helpful.\n\nShe added: \"If I were more mature and healthy, I would have done it very differently, but I wasn't very well... I was completely self-absorbed. Ultimately, my children suffered a great deal because of it. But I can't take that back.\""
