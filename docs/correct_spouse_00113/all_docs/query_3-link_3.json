        "text": "Melanie Warner (AnnaLynne McCord) is a hidden villainess from the second and final season of ABC's Secrets and Lies.\n\nMelanie Warner is the wife of the youngest Warner offspring, Patrick, but as revealed in the season's progression, she was running a brothel in the affluent Mint Hill area. Patrick had vented about his inability to sell the Mint Hill properties, which led to Melanie responding by accusing John and Eric (Patrick's father and brother, respectively) of not respecting his work, while promising success for her husband. It was then that she opened her brothel and sent her escorts to cozy up to Mint Hill's wealthy men.\n\nMelanie's reveal came in Episode 7, \"The Statement,\" when one of her girls, Carly, revealed her connection to Melanie when she was with Neal Oliver, who later told Eric. After Patrick was arrested for fraud in the following episode, \"The Racket,\" Detective Andrea Cornell showed photographic evidence of his wife's criminal activities: in the form of Melanie servicing Patrick's lawyer, who Patrick attacked once he entered. Later in the episode, Melanie was at her yoga class, where she was handcuffed and arrested while in an odd position.\n\nDuring her own interrogation by Detective Felicia Sanchez, the evil Melanie justified her actions by stating that her escorts actually wanted to do what they were doing, while using female empowerment to further defend pimping out young women. Sanchez later removed Melanie's necklace and revealed a flash drive that contained a video evidence of her activities, and when Melanie asked how she knew it was in the necklace, Sanchez revealed that Patrick flipped on her. The villainess was later interviewed by Cornell, who suspected her in the murder of Eric's wife, Kate. Melanie stated that she didn't kill Kate, and her side business was done for Patrick (in her mind). Though her sister-in-law was later revealed as Kate's killer, Melanie was arrested (off-screen) for her own crimes.\n\nNavigation[]"
