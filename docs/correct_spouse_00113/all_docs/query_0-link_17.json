The couple met in 2000. Leis, who now works for a company that provides Muzak to businesses, was an employee at a Key West, Fla., restaurant owned by McGillis and her second husband Fred Tillman.\n\nSee other celebs who got married this year\n\nLast year, Ms. McGillis announced she was a lesbian. Discussing that interview, Ms. McGillis told the Times: \"That was one of those moments when somebody asked me a question, my kids had gone from home, so I really didn't have to protect anyone by skirting the question, and I just decided to be absolutely honest.\""
