        "text": "Neighbours legend Toadie Rebecchi’s (Ryan Maloney) affair with ex-wife Melanie Pearson (Lucinda Cowden) has finally been exposed – and is set to leave current spouse Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) reeling.\n\nIt’s been a whirlwind 100 episodes since Amazon Freevee revived the cult Australian soap, and during that time both Toadie and Terese have had their heads turned by their former partners.\n\nIt’s been a turbulent few months for the new couple as they struggled to fit into their new family life and with Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) constantly chasing his ex-wife’s tail, things were never going to be easy.\n\n‘I’ve always said that Terese is ‘the one’ for Paul’, Stefan Dennis told Metro.co.uk in an exclusive chat.\n\n‘There’s only been two true loves in Paul’s life and that was Gail followed by Terese. Everybody else in between sort of didn’t quite cut it.’\n\n‘Paul might go “yes, you’re the one,” and Terese might go, “you’re the one,” but it’s never going to be a smooth ride’ he added.\n\nWhen Melanie (Lucinda Cowden) returned to Ramsay Street, she explained that she’d made a hasty departure in order to save her family after she was blackmailed by twisted Eden Shaw (Costa D’Angelo).\n\nSince then, Toadie has been left debating whether he still has suppressed his feelings for her.\n\nIn shock scenes last week, the two shared a passionate kiss – and then slept together – whilst Terese reconnected with Paul at a scrapyard, hunting down her late son Josh’s missing memorial plaque.\n\n‘They have a very special connection together and I think she just wants to be there for him [in the wake of his son David’s death]’ Rebekah Elmaloglou added.\n\n‘However, the guy stood her up at the vow renewal so… I think what she finds with Toadie is a sense of security. Not with Paul. But who knows what will happen down the track?’\n\nThe affair was exposed in an explosive instalment this morning (11th March), with the residents bedding down at Lassiters for a Longest Lie-In competition.\n\nAs Melanie became uncomfortable at the prospect of spending the day lay next to Toadie and Terese, she jumped up and voiced her concerns to Holly Hoyland (Lucinda Armstrong-Hall), who was unaware that her walkie talkie had broadcast the conversation across the complex.\n\nSpeaking of the wider impact of the affair, Ryan Maloney said: ‘When it does come out, Toadie’s got to deal with the disgrace and the fall from grace within his own daughter’s eyes.’\n\n‘He’s the guiding example of what men are in her life and he’s gone and done this.’\n\nDaughter Nell (Ayisha Salem-Towner) initially came to blows with her new step-mother, finding it difficult to accept yet another maternal figure in her life and found comfort in Melanie instead – but things look set to change following the betrayal.\n\n‘I don’t know whether she can get over the loss of trust. I really hope they do, because it’s so important to Mel, that relationship’ Lucinda Cowden said.\n\n‘Melanie is just driven with ‘if I can get him back, everything will fall into place. I’ll get my life back. I’ll be able to be who I was before.’ She simplistically thinks this is just going to be OK.’\n\nWhether any of the couples will reunite remains to be seen for now, with the actors keeping it firmly under their hats.\n\n‘A wedding? I don’t think so. I don’t know. You’ve got to believe, babes’ teased Lucinda.\n\nNeighbours streams Mondays to Thursdays from 7am on Amazon Freevee.\n\nIf you’ve got a soap or TV story, video or pictures get in touch by emailing us soaps@metro.co.uk – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nJoin the community by leaving a comment below and stay updated on all things soaps on our homepage.\n\nMORE : Neighbours confirms chaos as secret explodes and child kidnap rocks Ramsay Street in game-changer of a week\n\nMORE : Neighbours legend injured in skiing accident and forced to step away from soap\n\nMORE : Much-loved icon returns as key soap reaches major milestone in 10 fresh spoilers for this week"
