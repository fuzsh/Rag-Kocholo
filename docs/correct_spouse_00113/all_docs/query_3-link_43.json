        "text": "Jenny Wilson (Anna Van Hooft) is a villainess from the 2022 Lifetime film, Big Lies in a Small Town (airdate August 21, 2022). She is the wife of Dr. Wilson.\n\nIn the film, main protagonist Rachel Baker was in a car accident caused by a driver in a black car, though after she was hospitalized, Rachel asked about her teenage daughter, Hannah Baker, only to be informed by Dr. Wilson and nurse Grace Ross that no one else was in the car. Regarding Jenny, her introductory scene saw her express sympathy for Rachel regarding her missing daughter, as she and her husband lost their own daughter, Megan, a year prior.\n\nHowever, as it turned out, Megan's death drove Jenny insane with grief, and in the time that passed, Jenny turned heel by colluding with her husband in a scheme to abduct a teenage girl to replace Megan. Their plot involved Gus, who took one girl prior to the film's events, with the villainous couple ordering their victim to refer to them as her parents, as well as never leave the house. However, their victim escaped and was killed by Gus, prompting the Wilsons to send Gus to abduct Hannah, which he does by causing the accident.\n\nTheir quest to keep Hannah hidden saw the couple send Gus to kill Grace when she ended up getting close to the truth, and once Mark joined Rachel on his search, he ended up attacked before Rachel was abducted and sent to the Wilson home. After Dr. Wilson revealed his backstory and role, Jenny emerged and callously informed Rachel that she and her husband could give Hannah a better life than Rachel could as a single mother, though Rachel was (reluctantly) allowed to say goodbye to Hannah; a scene that saw Jenny snap at Hannah and order her to refer to Jenny as her mother.\n\nHowever, Rachel used this as an opportunity to attack Dr. Wilson and help Hannah escape, with the evil Jenny attacking Rachel afterwards. Hannah returned to the house to save her mother, only for Jenny to take the knife away from Hannah and hold her hostage. Rachel retrieved the knife and attacked Dr. Wilson, and after rescuing Hannah, Jenny was arrested (off-screen) along with her husband and Gus.\n\nTrivia[]"
