After graduating from high school in 1975, she moved to New York City to study acting at the Juilliard School, where she graduated in 1983, Group 12.\n\nFilm\n\nHer breakout role was that of an Amish mother in the 1985 film Witness with Harrison Ford, for which she received Golden Globe and BAFTA award nominations. Her next high-profile role was that of flight instructor Charlie in the 1986 fighter-pilot film Top Gun with Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer.\n\nIn 1987, McGillis acted in the fantasy-comedy film Made in Heaven, directed by Alan Rudolph, which was produced by Lorimar Productions. The film also co-stars Oscar winner Timothy Hutton.\n\nMcGillis played the part of caretaker for Miss Venable (Jessica Tandy) in 1988's The House on Carroll Street, which also stars Jeff Daniels. She overhears a suspicious conversation in the house next door and suspects that she's stumbled on a conspiracy to smuggle Nazi war criminals into the United States.\n\nAfter 1988's The Accused, she appeared in Cat Chaser with Peter Weller, a film she despised and which discouraged her from pursuing an acting career. McGillis appeared in dozens of television and film roles throughout the 1990s before taking a break from acting for a few years.\n\nIn 1992's The Babe, Ms. McGillis plays a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl who becomes Babe Ruth's (played by John Goodman) second wife. She prepared for the role by reading Billie Burke's autobiography about her career with the Follies, \"With a Feather on My Nose\".\n\nIn 1999, McGillis teamed up with Val Kilmer (who plays Virgil, a blind man), for a second time as his over protective sister in At First Sight, with Mira Sorvino.\n\nShe played the suspect in the disappearance of a young woman starring Susie Porter in The Monkey's Mask, an international lesbian cult film from 2000. The film is based on the verse novel of the same name by Australian poet Dorothy Porter.\n\nStage\n\nWhile at Juilliard she performed in William Congreve's Love for Love, directed by John Bletchley.\n\nSince her graduation, McGillis has performed live theatre, including classics by Chekov, Shaw, Ibsen, Shakespeare and O’Neill.

She stars alongside Nick Damici, Connor Paolo and Danielle Harris.\n\nMcGillis was featured in a breast cancer docu-drama titled 1 a Minute, released in 2010.\n\nShe starred in Ti West's 2011 thriller The Innkeepers.\n\nWe Are What We Are and Tio Papi in 2013\n\nGrand Street in 2014\n\nLove Finds You in Sugarcreek, Ohio in 2014, TV, (McGillis' 2nd Amish themed film)\n\nZ Nation in 2014, Sisters of Mercy, Season 1, Episode 11\n\nBlue in 2015\n\nAn Uncommon Grace, on Hallmark Channel, (McGillis' 3rd Amish themed film)\n\nLead role in Mother of All Secrets in 2017 as Rose Lewis\n\nPersonal life\n\nMcGillis married fellow Juilliard student Boyd Black in 1979, but the couple divorced in 1981.\n\nMcGillis married Fred Tillman in 1989, and they have two daughters. The couple divorced in 2002.\n\nMcGillis came out as a lesbian in April 2009 during an interview with SheWired. McGillis said that coming to terms with her sexual orientation has been an ongoing process since age 12, and she was long convinced that God was punishing her for being homosexual with a rape incident. In 2010, McGillis entered into a civil union with Melanie Leis, a Philadelphia-based sales executive; she and McGillis met in 2000 when Leis was a bartender at the \"Kellys' Caribbean Bar Grill & Brewery\" in Key West, Florida, which McGillis owned with her then-husband Fred Tillman. Leis and McGillis broke up in 2011.\n\nMcGillis worked full-time with drug addicts and alcoholics at Seabrook House Drug Alcohol Rehab Center, a rehabilitation center in Bridgeton, New Jersey, when she and Leis shared a home in Collingswood.\n\nMcGillis currently lives in Hendersonville, North Carolina. She teaches acting at The New York Studio for Stage and Screen NYS3 in Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nJune 2016 Attack\n\nMcGillis was reportedly assaulted by a stranger who broke into her North Carolina home on June 17, 2016. She said the attack, as well as others she has experienced in the past, has led her to decide to apply for a concealed carry gun permit to protect herself.\n\nUpcoming\n\nMcGillis is set to star in crime thriller Annie Cook, which Angel Grace Worldwide will introduce to international buyers at the Cannes Film Market."
