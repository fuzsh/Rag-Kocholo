        "text": "Top Gun's Kelly McGillis Marries Longtime Girlfriend in Civil Union\n\nTop Gun actress Kelly McGillis and longtime girlfriend Melanie Leis were joined in a civil union, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe ceremony for McGillis, 53, and Leis, a 42-year-old sales executive, was held Wednesday at the Collingswood, N.J., Municipal Court. The couple met in 2000. Leis, who now works for a company that provides Muzak to businesses, was an employee at a Key West, Fla., restaurant owned by McGillis and her second husband Fred Tillman.\n\nLast year, Ms. McGillis announced she was a lesbian. Discussing that interview, Ms. McGillis told the Times: \"That was one of those moments when somebody asked me a question, my kids had gone from home, so I really didn't have to protect anyone by skirting the question, and I just decided to be absolutely honest.\"\n\nMcGillis, who also starred in '80s films Witness and The Accused, was married twice before, and has two children with Tillman Â— Kelsey Laure, 20, and Sonora Ashley, 17.\n\nProbably the only difference between her and most \"hot\" ~53 year old actresses is tens of thousands of dollars worth of plastic surgery.\n\nLike this woman:\n\nYou tell that she's had a bunch of work done to her face.\n\nYeah agree. Just wait kids, when you get in your 40s and 50s you'll be singing a different tune.\n\nTrue enough. She looks exactly what I expect a 53 y/o woman looks like. Actors and actresses are not gods/goddesses of everlasting youth.\n\nYeah agree. Just wait kids, when you get in your 40s and 50s you'll be singing a different tune.\n\n40s and 50s isn't that old. I know quite a few hot 40 year old women, and several hotties into their 50s. McGillis looks more like she's in her 60s.\n\nWhile she wasn't hideous, she was NOT hot in Top Gun. Her huge teeth were so distracting and there was definitely something ape-like about her face. Even my 40yo sister commented on it when we last watched Top Gun ~7-9 months ago, wondering aloud why people ever considered Kelly McGillis \"sexy.\""
