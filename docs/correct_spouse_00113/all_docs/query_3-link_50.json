        "text": "ICYMI - last month, I was on \"Amplify with Jess Ekstrom.\" Jess and I discuss leveraging LinkedIn and building an authentic personal brand. One of the topics we discuss is strategic profile enhancement. Your profile is about speaking to your network/audience about the problems you solve and how you can help them, making it easy for someone to understand: →what you do, →who you do it for, →the results you get, & →how to contact you. You can define your future, and LinkedIn is a tool to help you get there. If you want to level up your presence here, this is THE perfect podcast to listen to this weekend! This podcast is especially helpful for someone in between jobs or looking for the next step in their career. 💡 🎧 Listen here: https://lnkd.in/ghvrVhTg If you look at your own profile, does it clearly explain all of the above? If you don't know how to do this but want to start - enroll in my community and course and use the code HUMAN for $30 off per month forever! https://lnkd.in/egw4HUax\n\nNo matter where you are today, it doesn’t have to be where you are tomorrow. Too many people say “no” to their own dreams because of… → How long they think it’ll take → Not knowing how to get from point A to B (or sometimes Z!) → Lacking the confidence to start again or to start something new If that’s you, take a look at this. Some of your favorite A-List celebs felt this way at one time or another →Harry Styles Before becoming a sensational singer, he was a baker. Earning $7 an hour. He left his job and stopped attending school to audition for X Factor. This led to joining One Direction, the band that skyrocketed him to stardom. He now earns $18M. →Stephen King Before becoming one of the most prolific writers of all time, He was a janitor working to supplement his income while he kept after he dreamed of becoming an author. Now, he nets nearly $400M from his novels. → Halle Berry Just years before winning an Oscar, she was sleeping in homeless shelters. She didn’t let the Hollywood struggle stop her. And, in fact, states it made her stronger and more resilient. You see. It’s never impossible to reinvent yourself. You just need courage, conviction, and the desire to take yourself there! Here are some tips to turn your fears into excitement: → NETWORK Use platforms like LinkedIn to make connections within the industry you want to be in. Bonus: get in the room when possible! → Study your new pursuit. Learn everything you can about it. Knowledge breeds confidence. Sign up for Google Alerts, share what you learn on LinkedIn, and raise your hand! You never know what’s around the corner or whom you might connect with that will change your life. → Remember things can shift within *seconds* when you get clear on your goals! Ready to get started on your personal brand and postioning yourself for the future? Let's talk 📲 Schedule a call with me here: https://lnkd.in/gfHaKiAB\n\nA personal introduction that has zero to do with work and all about you getting to know me (plus some random facts) 1. Exercising is my world. I work out 60-90 minutes every single day. I transformed my routine/lifestyle in 2022 and shed a ton of weight (up to 50 big ones!) I started going to Pilates in February, and now I am hooked! I ran my first half marathon in April and am running another half in September. 💪🏻 2. I love to spend time with my tween daughters and teach them about everything. I am much more open to talking about and sharing things than my parents/grandparents were. 3. I love to read. So far in July, I have read Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins, Rest by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, Revenue Operations by Stephen G. Diorio and Chris K. Hummel, and I am currently reading The Untethered Soul by Michael A. Singer. Do you have any must-reads? ( I recommend all of these) 4. My dog Lola is with me most of the time. She is a 16-year-old Chihuahua with the personality of a golden retriever. She is the sweetest, most loving animal with no teeth. 😂 5. I am formerly an artist and have been having an itch lately to start up again. I grew up painting watercolors, oil, and acrylics. I also have been formally trained in portraiture. I used to be able to draw photorealistic portraits with pencil or charcoals. 6. When I was 12, I started working. My parents told me I had to earn money if I wanted anything more than what they could provide me with in terms of clothes and anything extra. This was both a blessing and a curse because now I'm a workaholic. 7. Family is number one for me. Last year, I officiated my younger brother’s wedding. 8. Both sides of my family are originally from Belarus. Unfortunately, Russian was a secret language in my family for adults only. I do know bad words and phrases in both Russian and Yiddish. In 2025, my goal is to learn how to read, write, and speak Hebrew fluently. ✡ 9. I worked two jobs (one corporate and one side hustle) while pregnant with my oldest while putting my ex-husband through law school. 10. My favorite thing(s)to do on weekends in the summer when I don't have my girls is to go for a long run in the heat, have an iced coffee (or rose), and go paddleboarding with Lola on our lake. It is hilarious how she lies down in the middle of my board. (chis are not water dogs but she is) 👇🏻👇🏻 This post was personal - not private. That was the point! I can't tell you how many times people have reached out to or met me in person and said I feel like I know you already. Don't be afraid to share yourself, and every once in a while, post something personal. In a crowded space, you are the differentiator. Save this post and make it your own. Have you ever shared a personal post about yourself? @ Galley Beach, last night ⤵\n\nTHIS is the #1 way to reinvent yourself and your career. 📣 Get great at growing beyond your comfort zone! Many of you know my story… At the start of 2020, I worked as a VP of Marketing. 95% of the company I worked for was laid off. I was terrified of what would happen if I was next. I knew the only way forward was to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. I had no digital footprint, so fear of posting (anywhere) and being on camera made me v uncomfortable. In my previous position, I managed the brand of my CEO and all of his company's brands. But never my own. I was seeing that LinkedIn was becoming a new stage — and more comparable to Madison Square Garden with its size & reach 😅 This was my personal challenge: VISIBILITY I was committed to consistently showing up & growing this aspect of my professionalism. So, this is precisely what I did to get started, and I leaned into it daily. I began seeking out virtual speaking opportunities to position myself as an expert : → I signed up for Google Alerts on specific topics to further educate myself → I started a YouTube podcast → I went on virtual panels → I held free webinars → I was a guest on LinkedIn Lives → I pitched myself to be a guest on various podcasts → I developed virtual trainings for companies on LinkedIn (also was hired to write and film a social course for a company) What helped me shake the nerves? Being CONFIDENT on the topic I was speaking and posting on & embodying SME energy. I believe that when you’re intentional in these areas, and you help others, everything will come to play 👏🏻 This exposure created a whole new pool of content for my brand, establishing trust + Credibility and opening doors to a NEW arena of business So stop waiting for the light at the end of the tunnel… light it up yourself! Let me ask you… → What areas do you resist most in your professional growth? → Are you positioning yourself for the next level of your career?\n\nAt any point, you can reimagine and rediscover what success and happiness looks like for you! I am SO incredibly grateful for the trust extended to me and The Borden Group by over 150 brands, including companies, C-suite executives, and others, over the last three years. Seeing my dreams become a reality and doing the same for others has been very fulfilling. ❤️ In honor of TBG's 3rd Anniversary and three years of lessons( SO MANY LESSONS), here are three core principles I live by: 1️⃣ Increase your speed to market—This will come with mistakes, but it will help growth 10x. 2️⃣ Eliminate questioning yourself and your decisions. Once a decision is made, that's it. Next. 3️⃣ Surround yourself with those who are at a different level than you are and who can lift you higher. You are the sum of who you are around. I have learned that if you believe in yourself, are resilient, show up, and work for it, you can be unstoppable. Most aren't willing to do any of the above, including work. 😉 Thank you for all the support and trust in me all these years! At my 40th party last weekend with my boyfriend Adam, he is my north star who inspired me to do all of this. 🌟 Happy Anniversary to The Borden Group!! What are the three principles you live by? Do you agree with mine? 👇🏻\n\nIs this holding you back from building a personal brand? 🤔 When I was working as VP of Marketing I was assigned a unique project. The project? → Create a personal branding strategy for ALL the customer-facing teams to align with the company marketing strategy. As I conducted these mini-workshops, I discovered two resounding reasons why they weren’t yet establishing a social presence: ↳Fear Looking foolish, getting trolled, losing their job, etc. ↳Uncertainty No idea what to do or where to start. → If this sounds familiar, here are the solutions: 1️⃣ Empower your team! I’m a firm believer that when your team members lean into their personal brands, it is a fantastic way to leverage leadership and drive significant benefits for the entire organization. (aka– when everyone’s on the same page, there’s nothing to fear! And it drives💰💯) 2️⃣ Support your marketing team with resources! Bring a marketing strategist or consultant specializing in personal brands to work 1:1 with your marketing or comms team. With a provided, proven-to-work framework, the content creation is simple. Often, marketing is so overwhelmed with other project work or understaffed that creating strategies and personal brand assets or posting on LinkedIn is just a box they check, so it generally has room for improvement. 3️⃣ Coordinate efforts to maximize ROI. When a company goes to market online together - you create a wave of visibility. The team is working for the same company in the same industry. They will have related but similar networks. All of a sudden - everyone in the industry is talking about your company - and that is when the opportunites start flowing in. This also leads to tangible ROI vs questioning, “Is it working?” I'll leave you with this: 65% of consumers say a brand’s CEO and employees influence their decision to buy. (via Accenture 2024) 🤯 Have you imagined how a personal branding strategy can change your company’s marketing? P.S. The Borden Group would love to support you! Let’s talk! 📲\n\nA team effort on LinkedIn can supercharge a business, but there's one case where it never will. A CEO hired me to put together a strategy for her leadership team. She knew synchronizing her exec’s messaging would amplify their impact while building their brands. I was thrilled about the collaboration. ( who wouldn't be?!) So, we got to work. 🛠 I asked for a discovery call with all of her leaders. This is when I set the stage and expectations. This is where I find out their goals. This is where we start tuning content for each person. But, it’s also the point where things could fall apart. …on the client’s side. And that's exactly what happened. I immediately picked up on those red flags. 🚩🚩🚩 I knew what the problem was. We’ve been through this before. The CEO didn’t have buy-in from her team. 👎🏻 She assumed everyone would be excited. She assumed the boost to their bottom line and their individual brands would be welcomed. But one or two people dragging their feet shuts it down. We DO create marketing magic, but we still need to buy in from all parties to make it happen! Luckily, there ARE teams out there that truly get it. We’ve been working with a client that’s all on board. From the top down, they are all in on their personal brands and working together as a team to help move company goals forward. We have helped them expand and deepen their conversations. We have helped with both employee AND client retention and acquisition. We have helped their marketing team build interconnected strategies between their leaders and the company. We have helped them earn exposure they didn’t have to pay another agency to handle for them. Today, their industry talks about them even in rooms they aren’t in because of their team’s synchronized messaging and their personal brands – 4 execs, 1 message. When everyone is on board, it works SO well! 🎉 Can you imagine the possibilities of your team of executives on LinkedIn if nothing holds you back?\n\nMemorable personal brands have this ONE component, does yours? → A unique story. This is the ‘it factor’ that will have you standing apart from your competition and resonating with your ideal audience. The tale as old as time and the oldest profession in the world. Storytelling. Just check out these numbers: → Storytelling can boost conversion rates by 30% → Storytelling increases the value of products by up to 2,706% → Adding a story to a blog post resulted in nearly 300% more people scrolling all the way through (except the ones with recipes, we just want the recipe! 😂) → One of our client's saw an increase of 272% in his comments when he started including storytelling into his content. These numbers don’t lie 🔥 Here’s how to get great at telling your story: → What experience sparked your “why” power? → What adversity / challenge did you overcome that you can help others with? → What success did you find on the other side? Now let’s leverage your story strengths on LinkedIn: → Turn the above into your ‘Top Skills’ section → Integrate storytelling into your posting strategy → Use your story to craft a compelling headline: what you do, who you help, the results → Tell a story about how you came to do what you do in your about section - feel free to use mine as your template Telling stories with actionable takeaways for your network is the way to differentiate yourself in a very crowded space. What’s your story? How do you stand out when everyone looks and sounds the same?👇🏻"
