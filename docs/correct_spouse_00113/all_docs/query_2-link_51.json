        "text": "KELLY MCGILLIS:\n\nFirst Jane Lynch, now Kelly McGillis who you likely recognize from Top Gun and Tasha’s courtroom nemesis on The L Word. The New York Times loves them some high profile gay marriages (thank God)! Kelly was “joined in a civil union” with her girlfriend, Melanie Leis, in New Jersey, on Sept. 15 and received a nice newspaper spread to celebrate.”\n\nMs. Leis, 42, is a regional sales executive in Philadelphia with Independence Communications, which provides Muzak to businesses. She is a graduate of the Berklee College of Music.\n\n(@nytimes)\n\nADAM LAMBERT:\n\nSo, on The Daily 10, Michael Catherwood thought it would be really funny to remark that were Adam Lambert to get jailed for the alleged “attack” on a paparazzi photographer (he did not attack the photographer, needless to say, although honestly I’m not sure why paparazzi photographers have rights when they are constantly violating everyone else’s privacy), that Adam Lambert would probably like it because,”From what I know about jail, Adam Lambert probably wouldn’t have too bad a time!” HAHAHAHAHAAHAAHAHA! RAPE LOL!!!!! GAY MEN LOVE RAPE! What the fuck Catherwoood. Suck it.\n\nAgain, this guy has a job and many of us and you do not. Life is so confusing. Now he’s apologized…kinda:\n\n“@adamlambert I’ve always been a vocal supporter of the Gay community. If offense was taken I’m sincerely sorry. Merely an attempt at comedy. My genuine apology to all in the GLBT community as well. Identifying me as homophobic is wrong though. Tasteless yes, but not hateful. I’ve identified that I misspoke and I sincerely apologize. All I can do is ask for forgiveness.”\n\nMaybe he should get fired? Yeah OK.\n\nLINDSAY LOHAN:\n\nLohan is going back to jail. Sigh. “Lindsay Lohan’s probation has been revoked and a bench warrant has been issued for her arrest after she admitted failing a court-ordered random drug test stemming from her DUI case. The bench warrant is being held until 8:30 a.m. Friday when the actress, 24, is due to appear in court.” (@us)\n\n.\n\nLESBIAN STALKER ROOMMATE MOVIES:\n\nSo, for some insane reason my parents took me to see Single White Female back in 1991 and I’ve been scarred ever since. And now they’re pseudo re-making that terrible/awesome stalker-lesbian film under the title The Roommate and starring Leighton Meester and Minka Kelly. Thoughts, feelings?\n\nTEGAN & SARA:\n\nOur favorite twinsies are digitally releasing The Complete Recollection this week, and it’s action packed: The Making of So Jealous and The Con: The Movie as well as 7 albums and 13 music videos, all in one place!\n\nFIONA APPLE:\n\nThis is a f*ing miracle. Fiona Apple, poet and songstress of our most intimate feelings (next to Ani Difranco and Sarah McLachlan) actually sat in a room and composed new music for the first time in 6 years, to be released in 2011. Who else spent their college dorm room days crying to Tidal & When the Pawn? (@billboard)\n\nGLEEKS:\n\nHere come the Gleeks! Exploring the playful and punny language of fandom, from Trekkies to Gleeks.\n\nGAY BOY FILMS:\n\nAfterElton has compiled a listicle of their own: Top 50 Favorite Gay Films, as voted by their readers. Coming in at #1 is Brokeback Mountain. (@afterelton)\n\nGLEE:\n\nGwyneth Paltrow will be appearing in a November episode as a love interest for Mr. Shue. (@eonline)\n\nELMO:\n\nElmo upstages Katy Perry on Sesame Street:"
