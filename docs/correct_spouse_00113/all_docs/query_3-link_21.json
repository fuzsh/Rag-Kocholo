        "text": "Topline\n\nFormer President Trump appeared to refer to his wife Melania Trump as “Mercedes” to some watching his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday—though the president’s campaign and surrogates strongly pushed back on that claim—on top of two other recent blunders, as cognitive sharpness becomes a key campaign issue.\n\nKey Facts\n\nContra\n\nIn a statement sent to Forbes, the Trump campaign said “the crazy leftists on X continue to suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome and that's why they lie about everything,” but did not clarify who Trump was referring to in the original comment.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n“My wife, our great First Lady—people love her,” Trump said while introducing his wife to the cheering crowd at CPAC. He continued seconds later as the crowd cheered: “people love her, oh look at that, wow! Mercedes, that’s pretty good!”\n\nKey Background\n\nQuestions about Trump’s mental competency have surrounded the former president as he campaigns for the Republican nomination. During the campaign season, Trump has frequently confused his Democratic opponent, President Joe Biden, with former President Barack Obama. Trump and his campaign have claimed these mix-ups were “sarcastic” and intentional. At a campaign event in New Hampshire in January, Trump continuously confused Nikki Haley, his rival for the Republican nomination, with former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. According to recent polling conducted by ABC, 62% of voters believe Trump, 77, is too old to serve a second term as president.. Trump frequently brushes off these concerns, claiming he “aced” a cognitive test—but experts say only involve simple tasks and no complex math problems. Trump repeated these claims during his CPAC speech on Saturday, lashing out at critics who question his fitness for office. “They’ll say, ‘He rambled, he’s cognitively impaired,’ the former president told the audience in National Harbor, Maryland. “Well, it’s really the opposite. It’s total genius, you know that.”\n\nNews Peg\n\nTrump went on to win the South Carolina primary on Saturday by a wide margin. The former president won 59% of the vote in his rival Nikki Haley’s home state, where she served as governor from 2011 to 2017.\n\nTangent\n\nMental competency questions have dogged the Biden campaign, especially after the report released by Special Counsel Robert Hur on February 8 described his memory as ““significantly limited.” Biden has also made his share of gaffes and name mix-ups. At a press conference criticizing to the Hur report, Biden called Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi the “president of Mexico.” In the same poll conducted by ABC, a startling 86% of respondents said Biden was too old to serve a second term as president.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nForbesTrump Has Confused Obama And Biden At Least 7 Times In Recent Months-Amid Other Notable GaffesForbesNikki Haley Questions Whether Trump Is 'Mentally Fit' After He Repeatedly Confuses Her With Nancy Pelosi"
