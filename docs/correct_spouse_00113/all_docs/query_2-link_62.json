        "text": "Fred Tillman, widely recognized as a yacht salesman, gained fame through his past marriage to the renowned American actress Kelly McGillis. Many of us know Kelly from her unforgettable roles in movies such as Top Gun (1986), Made in Heaven (1987), The House on Carroll (1988), and The Accused.\n\nIf you are curious to unravel the intriguing story of Fred Tillman, the former partner of Top Gun’s beloved actress, then join us on this captivating journey. In this article, we will unveil exclusive insights into Fred’s background, including his age, career path,, his relationship with the actress, children, and more. Prepare yourself for an in-depth exploration of Fred Tillman’s extraordinary life.\n\nBirth and Early Years\n\nFred Tillman, born Fred M Tillman, entered this world in the United States of America on 24 October 1949. Fast forward to 2023, and he is currently 74 years old. While information about his childhood remains limited, Tillman is believed to have had a satisfactory upbringing in his hometown. In terms of education, Tillman pursued his studies at American University. As for his nationality, he proudly identifies as American, and it is likely that he belongs to the Caucasian ethnicity.\n\nFred Tillman’s Journey as a Yacht Broker and Restaurateur\n\nFred Tillman, the ex-spouse of Kelly McGillis, had a thriving career in the 1990s as a yacht broker based in Newport Beach, California. However, after their marriage, Tillman decided to relocate to Key West, Florida, where he continued his passion for sailing yachts. Unfortunately, he faced a significant setback during this time.\n\nIn April 1996, tragedy struck when the schooner owned by Fred and Kelly, valued at $1.5 million, caught fire at a marina in Dania, Florida. The fire originated from a neighboring boat and quickly spread, engulfing their vessel called The Centurion. Although Fred and his two companions were on board at the time, thankfully, no one was injured.\n\nHowever, their plans to sell the boat and showcase it at the Fort Lauderdale Boat Show were abruptly dashed by the devastating flames. It remains unclear whether Fred continued his involvement in the yacht business in recent years. In addition to his maritime pursuits, Fred Tillman and his then-wife ventured into the restaurant industry.\n\nThey opened Kelly’s Caribbean Bar, Grill & Brewery in Key West, transforming what was once the PAN American Airways ticketing office into a bustling eatery. The restaurant quickly gained popularity, attracting both locals and tourists, and it continues to serve customers to this day. Alongside his ventures in the yacht and hospitality industries, Fred also worked as a marketing consultant at some point in his career. Nonetheless, his current professional endeavors remain undisclosed, as he prefers to lead a private life.\n\nThe Journey of Fred Tillman and Kelly McGillis\n\nIn a secret ceremony on New Year’s Eve, 1988, Fred Tillman, the yacht broker, and Top Gun actress Kelly McGillis tied the knot in Los Angeles, California. Seeking a quieter life away from the bustling city, the couple relocated to Key West, Florida, where they built their family and settled down. Once their hidden marriage became public knowledge, Fred faced scrutiny for being an outsider to the movie industry. He was labeled a “complete nobody.”\n\nHowever, his then-wife, Kelly, came to his defense, expressing her disinterest in solely being surrounded by actors. She emphasized that she valued more than just a career in the film industry and cherished the connection she found with Fred, regardless of his profession. Their marriage seemed strong, with Kelly even stepping away from acting to live a more ordinary life with him. However, as time passed, cracks began to appear in their relationship, and after almost 13 years of marriage, they made the difficult decision to divorce in 2002.\n\nFred Tillman: Children\n\nFred Tillman is the father of two children, Sonora and Kelsey Tillman. They were born during his previous marriage to famous American actress Kelly McGill. Kelsey was born on May 24, 1990, and as of May 2023, she is 32 years old. Sonora, on the other hand, was born on April 10, 1993, making her 30 years old in 2023. She had a job as a bartender at a restaurant called Kelly’s Caribbean Bar, Grill & Brewery, which was owned by her parents. Additionally, she actively supports and speaks up for the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nKelly McGillis’ Revelation: Finding Love and Identity\n\nKelly McGillis met Melanie Leis who worked as a bartender at Kelly’s restaurant.. They quickly got along, but their relationship wasn’t always healthy because they would often drink too much and use drugs. In the year 2009, Kelly McGillis finally revealed her true self and announced that she was a lesbian. She said she had felt this way for most of her life, even back when she was in high school.\n\nHowever, she had always been scared and upset because she thought being attracted to other girls was wrong. Then, in September 2010, after getting sober and ending her marriage with her ex-husband Fred Tillman in 2002, Kelly McGillis and Melanie Leis decided to get married in a place called New Jersey.\n\nThey also moved to a quiet area in Pennsylvania, where they could bring up Kelly’s daughters together. Unfortunately, Kelly McGillis and her third spouse ended their relationship in the year 2011, and we don’t know if she is dating someone new now. Currently, we don’t see her on television or in movies very often. The most recent project she was known for was a TV movie called “Maternal Secrets“ that came out in 2018.\n\nFred Tillman: Present\n\nEver since Fred Tillman split up with his famous wife, he has chosen to live a life away from the spotlight. He hardly shows up in public, making it challenging to determine his current relationship status. However, if we take a look at his Facebook account, which remained active until 2019, there is no evidence to suggest that he had entered into any engagement or serious relationship by that time.\n\nFred Tillman Embraces the Joy of Grandparenthood\n\nAt this very moment, both of Fred Tillman’s daughters have reached adulthood. It appears that his older daughter, Kesley, may have a child, but we do not have precise details about this little one. However, Fred’s younger daughter, Sonora, has become a mother. She has two children with her former partner, D.J. Wood. Their names are Atlas Owen Wood, born on March 19, 2016, and Harlow Wood, born on February 14, 2019. Fred Tillman now experiences the immense happiness that comes with being a grandparent.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nFred Tillman’s journey as the ex-husband of Kelly McGillis has been marked by his successful career as a yacht broker and restaurateur. While their marriage faced challenges and ultimately ended in divorce, Tillman has found joy in being a father and now a grandfather, embracing a private life away from the spotlight."
