Assured, calculated, worldly, ruthless, untouchable‚Ä¶..\n\nüñã A-mazing couple\n\nüñã Money, secrets, sex, power, intrigue & betrayal\n\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/397r9uO\n\nApple: https://apple.co/3z8J6DZ\n\nARC provided to me by author Melanie Martin in exchange for an honest rating/review.\n\nSeptember 27, 2021\n\nI‚Äôve read a lot of books but damn this heroine is dumb. It killed me to reading her part of the book. I even took a break because I can‚Äôt believe she could be so gullible. Then again she was sheltered and is young and Alex is cunning. Why would the author go through such lengths to make her so naive? She had sooooo many truths staring her right in her face. I can‚Äôt believe love for Alex made her look pass everything. His family is crazy and so is her mother. Despite all that it was not too boring just a little tiring reading how Petra‚Äôs stupidity keeps growing. I don‚Äôt think I will continue with this series.\n\nMay 21, 2024\n\nNO NO NO! It can‚Äôt be happening! It can not end the book like this!! Petra and Alex‚Äôs future is hanging in limbo and I definitely can not wait to read Defying Eternity!\n\nJanuary 11, 2023\n\nMy Stress Level!!!üò±üò±üò±\n\nThe story is getting deep and my stress level is through the roof!!! Petra and Alex gets married, the mom Tess is not a happy camper, the dad Roy attends the wedding and makes peace. Meanwhile, Tess is found dead and I think they are trying to frame Alex in an attempt to break him and Petra up, but honestly Petra has turned on her husband and sided with her friend Matthew and his dad Eric. Petra is not a strong women, she in my opinion is very weak and she over thinks too much causing her to make unnecessary decisions. I hope once Alex is cleared from the murder of Tess, I pray he leaves Petra once and for all. She is not mature enough to be married to a much older man.\n\nNovember 7, 2023\n\nThis book took me so long to finish, it was so dragged out. Although I love how the last chapter really makes you want to read the next book. I just hope its not dragged out this almost ended up on my DNF list.\n\nFebruary 11, 2024\n\nSadly, it was hard to move past the 2nd book and even worse moving on. I know I'm in the minority but I couldn't even finish... I tried so hard. Petra was SO annoying and whiny would be my biggest complaint, it's one thing to be young it's another to actually have zero maturity in a very adult relationship (but sooo mature sexually as a virgin??)! \"I hate you\" \"I love you\" \"dope\"\n\nI have never left a book review before but felt the need just because I seen sooo many great reviews on tiktok PLUS its not on KU, you pay some money for these.. normally this story line I'd love but the \"proper\" dialog was tough to get into. Not for me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nJanuary 8, 2022\n\n4 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Stars! Forbidden series, OMG it gets better and better. Beautiful. I love this series and wish it had 10 books. Recommend\n\nSeptember 26, 2021\n\nAptly named, Lured into Lies, is just that, when the author tells you to expect the unexpected, she intends just that.\n\nAlexander is adamant that his past is in the past and his secrets are his, and that is where he wants it to stay. Petra is determined to learn the truth at all costs, and when it is finally reveled to her, she got more than she bargained for, or so she thought.\n\nFor the truth, is shrouded in lies and deception, deeply rooted and intertwined like no other, a family determined to do whatever it takes, no matter what, to keep the truth hidden at all costs, to control, deceive, coerce, and manipulate those who would expose their secrets.\n\nWhen Petra is confronted with harsh truths from those out to seek revenge against Alexander and her mother Tess, having given Alexander the benefit of the doubt, repeatedly, continues to deceive her, but only to be consumed by her love for him.\n\nBut when it all becomes too much, a line is drawn, there are those out there who are determined to see their relationship fail, those who have tried to tear them apart, but they have both risked everything to get to this point, and when they finally say I do, will their future be of their own design, or the design of others?\n\nWhen Petra‚Äôs mother turns up dead, it sets in motion a chain of events neither her nor Alexander could have imagined. When those who are loyal to Tess, share with Petra, with what her mother had secreted away in the event of her sudden death, in calls her marriage to Alexander into question, after hearing a private phone call between her husband and his sister, contrary to what Alexander told her, she learns that he was complicit in her mother‚Äôs disappearance right from the get-go.\n\nStubbornly committed to knowing the truth, and always so curious, will Petra be able to follow through on the confidential agreement that she signed, with her heart torn in two, will she go against her vows, vows that her husband has disregarded repeatedly, to seek justice not only for her mother, but also for self. Will this be the first stage of failure for their marriage, indirectly knowing that the life of their child and their future, a future that they both fought so hard for is at risk.\n\nWhen so many lies are told, when you give your heart, when you are meant to love those who you have given your life to, is the truth amongst it, because there comes a time when you believe the lies so much, you do not know what the truth is anymore.\n\nThere is a perplexing tangle of hurt, anger and denial, powerful in themselves, secrets, lies, deception, manipulation, pain, motives, and truths which becomes all the clearer with those deep revelations.\n\nI was hooked from the very first chapter right up until the last. The different point of views told a telling story of heartbreak, love, and loss, especially the complex family dynamics between the protagonists and the interconnected characters.\n\nIt holds so much mystery, adrenaline seeking suspense, slow burning passion, dark romance,\n\nintrigue, revenge, mild-violence, vengeance, friendship, lust, loyalty, trust. It will hook you, have you turning the pages to find out more, with themes and triggers that will test any reader, reading this story, it enables the readers to really connect with the characters.\n\nTheir story was raw and sensual, as it was powerful and confronting. It was fast paced and thrilling, it made my heart race and soar to unfathomable heights. The author knows how to write, to ensnare her readers to ensure they will come back for more, me I will come back for more.\n\nAnd those s‚Ç¨x scenes in and out of the bedroom were downright filthy wicked, sensually dirty and erotic, the filthy dirty talk and language an absolute turn on, daring, explosive, wrong, physical, provocative, possessive, controlling, oh so steamy, deliciously wicked, dirty, hot, beautiful, dark, naughty, raw, powerful, passionate, wet, dominating, and wild. This story concludes with Defying Eternity, book 4, the final book in the Bloom in Winter series, and one we hope will give them the happily ever after they deserve. But then again, we must expect the unexpected for nothing is set in stone.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMarch 30, 2022\n\nNo no... it's can't end like this!\n\nShit. Petra is so na√Øve I can't believe she just says yes to everything. OMG!! This cliffy is brutal.\n\nMay 27, 2024\n\nThis series is so good! It‚Äôs amazing how fast the pages go! So many twists and turns! Can‚Äôt wait to read the next book especially since this one like the last two ended with a cliff hanger!\n\nOctober 17, 2021\n\nWas a bit sceptical at first since I didn't think much of the second book, BUT this is the best book in the series so far. The story keeps you on edge and I couldn't put it down. So looking forward to the next book in the series.\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nMan. This series will send you on trip.\n\nJanuary 28, 2023\n\nI‚Äôm struggling with series! This girl is an idiot! I so want to like these but wow‚Ä¶.\n\nJuly 18, 2024\n\nFavorite book of the series! Soo good page turner\n\nOctober 7, 2021\n\nAgain I'm frustrated with how incredibly naive Petra is. At EVERY turn. I understand she's 18/19 but it honestly takes away from the story. And my investment into her relationship with Alex. In fact, it becomes almost too much because she's not mature AT ALL. Like I'm down for a sexy / forbidden age gap that's big when the younger character is \"mature\" and the other is \"youthful.\" But this just feels like a dumb teen dating someone with way more life under them.\n\nI also can't understand how an heiress would not having basic understanding about so much happening here. It feels like at each turn someone is explaining something to her that based on the tropes represented she \"should\" know because she grew up in it. IDK maybe I'm being picky.\n\nIn that vein, I'm over the Alex lying / filtering bs. If you're marrying the woman and believe she's \"adult\" (despite her not acting like it) then don't lie to her. I also found his reaction to her understandable shock at the secrets unnerving AF. He's all \"forgive and forget\" but life isn't that easy. This probably is also whats impacting my impression of her lack of character development as well.\n\nIn Alex's defense, and reason number 957 I dislike Petra (despite my aforementioned frustrations with Alex) is that she begged and begged to know this big secret and immediately tells her friend after her partner asks her not to. Especially to Emma. I can't just. Like girl stop.\n\n[image error]\n\nWhile the ending wasn't surprising I'm again shocked üò≥ Petra had a hard time wondering how to handle the situation. Like I understand the idea of standing by your husband / spouse but the optics (even if he didn't do anything wrong) are bad. And what Petra witnessed (and had to do herself) after the wedding is just so ridiculous. Having a hard time understanding how anyone would stay in that type of relationship. And if they do, then this feels like par for the course. AKA - if you get in bed with the mob don't be pissed when people die around you.\n\nAlso, I love a dirty story but this is too much sex- there I said it. Where's the story line people?\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nApril 11, 2022\n\nI give credit to the story and twists but I believe they are a bit stretched. All along the main character, Petra is portrayed as immature and incapable of empathy because whilst she is annoyed at how others do not see her perspective, she does not understand others'. One would assume that after all the mishaps and heartbreak, she'd develop a thicker skin and a grasp of reality. That is, not everything goes your way and after you betray people, they would want some distance. Disappointed with some grammar that I found shockingly incorrect and some typos, I feel like this book, like the previous one, was rushed. Such a shame because the storyline has credit but it has become a bit too much. I intend to read the next book to give the author one last chance to change my mind on the whole thing. I appreciate that maybe she doesn't want a conventional story but I can't help find similarities with another series. I look forward to being proven wrong.\n\nDecember 8, 2023\n\nIt‚Äôs not lured into lies, it‚Äôs lured into this dang series!! Uggg, I just can‚Äôt with these cliff hangers.\n\nOk I‚Äôm good now. Where do I start? Petra the petulant lets everyone influence her but herself! She has made me so angry in this installment. For crying out loud if you want this big girl life, get your chesticles ready and face it head on.\n\nYou have a man that will move mountains for your love and happiness, yet you don‚Äôt have the fortitude to listen without judgement. Oh, I‚Äôm just so frustrated with her.\n\nNow kind sir, if I may? Mr. Van Dieren, You do too much ‚Äúomission‚Äù. Tell it all once and for all and give her what she needs to trust you.\n\nThe DA is shady AF and so is his son.\n\nMelanie!! Ugg. This is so dang heart wrenching, intoxicating and suspenseful. You have written a great series. Let me get to the next one so I can at least sleep at night.\n\nSpice: üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è\n\nFebruary 17, 2024\n\nDive into the tempestuous sea of Petra and Alex's love affair, a narrative so tantalizing it could only be set against the backdrop of Bermuda's enigmatic beauty. This story, dear readers, is not your garden-variety romance. Oh no, it's a labyrinth of passion, mystery, and the kind of love that writes its own rules‚Äîage gaps, societal scrutiny, and secrets be damned.\n\nLet's talk about the foundation of Petra and Alex's relationship: lies. Now, conventional wisdom would have us believe that trust is the cornerstone of love, but our intrepid lovers are far from conventional. Running from forces determined to pry them apart, they find themselves in Bermuda, an island as mysterious and full of secrets as the man Petra has given her heart to.\n\nThe allure of this tale lies not just in the \"Enemies to Lovers\" trope that we so adore but in the delicious, slow-burning journey Petra and Alex undertake, both geographically and emotionally. Their love is a ship navigating through stormy seas, with Petra at the helm, determined to steer them towards a future where secrets no longer lurk in the shadows.\n\nAlex, with his enigmatic past and refusal to share his secrets, presents a challenge as intoxicating as it is infuriating. Petra, ever the embodiment of determination and curiosity, is not one to back down. The stakes? Nothing less than their future together, a future that hangs in the balance as they face judicial battles and society's relentless gaze.\n\nBut oh, the intrigue that weaves through their story, as intricate and compelling as the patterns of the sand on Bermuda's beaches. It's a dance of shadows and light, where every revelation brings them closer, and every secret threatens to tear them apart.\n\nAnd let's not shy away from the dark spice of their intimate scenes‚Äîthese moments are not just about passion; they're a testament to the depth of their connection, a blending of souls that transcends the physical. It's in these moments that the story truly sings, a melody of desire and devotion that's as heady as the island's night air.\n\nTo award this masterpiece anything less than five stars would be an injustice to its layered complexity, its heart-stopping romance, and the sheer beauty of its execution. Petra and Alex's story is a reminder that sometimes, the foundation of a relationship isn't just about trust but about fighting for love on your own terms, about unraveling the past to build a future.\n\nSo, to those with a taste for romance that defies the odds, that dances on the edge of society's norms, and that burns with a passion as relentless as Petra's quest for the truth, I say: delve into this story. It's a journey of love, mystery, and the kind of trust that's forged in the fires of adversity. Petra hasn't said her last word, and thank goodness for that, because we're all hanging on her every whisper.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nFebruary 3, 2022\n\n4/5 stars!\n\nanother great instalment to the blossom in winter series. I really loved the suspense of this one, it goes tense at times. There wasn‚Äôt as much romance in this one as we focused more on the mystery aspect of things. I don‚Äôt mind that though, the story was still good strong to continue reading!\n\n[SPOILERS AHEAD]\n\nPetra and Alex have been through a whirlwind of a relationship, their love is really being tested. Is it strong enough to survive? Petra wants no more lies or deaths to occur in the Alex family. Alex promises her and assures that all he needs is her.\n\nYet it‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows as Petra‚Äôs mother Tess is still out to trap Alex and expose him as the criminal he is. Alongside the help of Eric and son Matthew.\n\nPetea finally learns what happened with Alex 20 years ago and must decide whether she should marry him or not. She‚Äôs got a big decision on her hands.\n\nAlex meanwhile wants to prove that he‚Äôs not that man he was back then, he doesn‚Äôt want drama and just wants to be done with the past. He wants Petra‚Äôs trust and vice verser.\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nOverall I really loved the book, there was a shocker twist at the end that I didn‚Äôt see coming and it makes me want to get on with the 4th instalment (which I‚Äôll be checking out sooner rather then later I hope). The age gap really isn‚Äôt the talking point of this story anymore. The love that Petra and Alex have though is still there, what this series is about is the drama factor and the mystery elements. But the romance is spicy when we get some ü§≠‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nSo I highly recommend this book series if you need something new to explore!\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nOctober 16, 2021\n\n4 Stars üåü üåüüåüüåü\n\nWow....this third book was quite a lot.\n\nI was conflicted in my evaluation of this third installment.\n\nFor once, it was really morbid to listen to a daughter having such a quite and normal conversation with her husband and best friend about them killing her own mother...\n\nAlex discussing such topic as he was talking about the weather left me baffled.\n\nDespite Tess being a paranoid, obsessed and a wired mother...and I despised her in the 2 first installments...she's a human being and talking about killing people is not OK, especially when is family.\n\nSecond, this book had less erotica than the other two. There were very few scenes and very short. The romance aspect was really lacking. The dialogues between H and h were very dry. I had a hard time thinking these were the same characters who loved each other so crazily in the first 2 books.\n\nAlex came out in this book as a boring middle aged man in a 2 decades relationship that has lost romantic interest in his partner. I think the writer paid too much attention to create drama and forget that this is a romance and the connection between h/H should always be there in the forefront despite stones thrown in the road.\n\nI was going to give this 3 Stars but the last chapter kinda brought back the connection between h and H even in the most absurd moment.\n\nHopefully book 4 will be better and we will see that strong connection between Petra and Alex back.\n\nMay 6, 2023\n\nI need to know why Petra trusts Matthew so much. He‚Äôs proven time and time again he already dislikes Alex. Why would he ever do anything to help support their relationship?\n\nEmma while she is one of my favorite characters because she was SLIGHTLY different than everyone else acted more like Petra than she has in the other two books. First she hates Alex then she comes to terms with being okay with Alex back to hating him because he‚Äôs stealing her best friend?????? It‚Äôs like she became book one Emma all over again.\n\nPetra‚Äî I tried SO hard to like her from book one but her flipping back and forth to I trust Alex to I don‚Äôt trust him was annoying. Honestly, you knew what you were marrying into‚Ä¶ YOU EVEN HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WALK AWAY and yet when told he‚Äôs marrying someone else you decide to come back only to do the same thing all over again AND backstab him without even hearing his side.\n\nMatt says he‚Äôs guilty so it HAS to be true?????\n\nHonestly, I just want to read the next book to see how this whole fiasco ends.\n\nMatt is the best and worst antagonist. I‚Äôve never hated a character more than him but at the same time, him and Petra actually suit one another and I‚Äôm surprised that since she trusts him soooo much she didn‚Äôt just stay with him.\n\nNeedless to say this book really pissed me off more than I thought it would.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJuly 14, 2024\n\nI may have given this one 4 stars, but let me tell you there is not much to like. I will explain...\n\nThis book was like getting repeatedly receiving an emotional bitch slap every few minutes. None of the characters are morally or mentally sound. The only sane one is Petra and on her best day she is an ignorant spoiled petulant child. Alexander is getting better, but that is not saying much when he can rationalize murder like sneaking candy on a diet.\n\nYou cannot even get me started on the rest of them. However, through all this, I still was rooting for Petra and Alex to come out on top.\n\nFrom the beginning I though Matt was not trustworthy and a bit of a creeper. Especially with the last chapter of this book. Eric, Carise, Tess and Matt, to some degree, have concocted her demise just for revenge. Not caring that Petra is being manipulated. Just my thoughts, but enough to make me go insane.\n\nI HATE these people yet, like watching a train wreck, I cannot get enough. So although I cannot stomach this book, I love it all the same.\n\nFebruary 2, 2023\n\nleast favorite book of the series so far.\n\nPetra is a naive girl, in the beginning she was so innocent and lacked street smart. The older she got and the more involved she got she still lacked a lot but remained like she was a know it all and she clearly isn‚Äôt. She thinks it‚Äôs ok for Matt to treat her the way he does and is to blind to see that he is doing this for selfish gains to be with her. His father is trying to win at all costs and she believes them all so freaking easy. It drives me nuts that she is so gullible. I feel like even her lawyer is in on this because why would matt even know her for her tell tell him where Peter was. I literally skimmed the last view chapters with her dealing with matt and his dad, I‚Äôm so mad and annoyed with Petra‚Äôs character and lack of common sense that if I didn‚Äôt pre order the next book I would have stopped reading at this point.\n\nAugust 2, 2022\n\nLured into Lies: Blossom Winter Book 3 is by Melanie Martines. Attorney General Eric Bradford has struck out twice in trying to get Roy, Hendrick, or Alex to be found guilty of something. This is their last try. Alex is charged with sexual assault of Amanda, who he had been engaged to at one time. Amanda had photo graphs of her back after being flogged. Some were permanent scars. The problem Alex had was that he had flogged Amanda and put those scars there. However, it had been with her consent. She really liked being flogged. However, it was her word against his that it was with her consent.\n\nIn addition, he had lied by omission to Petra again. This time he wasn‚Äôt sure if she was going to forgive him or not. His life was a mess. Could he get out of this?\n\nOctober 13, 2023\n\n‚ÄúThey say trust is the foundation of any relationship but what if lies are the foundation of ours?‚Äù\n\nAfter Risking everything and everyone trying to destroy their relationship, Petra and Alex leave the country to go to Bermuda.

This wonderful series has everything from love to hate , lies and truths, ups and downs of emotions.\n\nONE LIE IS ENOUGH TO QUESTION ALL TRUTHS...\n\nPetra finally has everything she could ever want with Alexander or so she thought...\n\nWhen old lies come to play in the present of their new beginning together. It will make them question each other even when they want to forget and enjoy each other's company in their future as one. Petra should be having the best time of her life, but when lies and deceit surface to everyday Life it's hard to decide who you can trust.\n\nMay 14, 2024\n\nI am trying so hard to stick with this series but there are a few things that make it really hard:\n\n1) the writing!!! I find you can skip over most of the description because it comes off as a diary entry and just read the quotes. We shouldn‚Äôt want to do that as readers!\n\n2) the characters are actually NUTS, there has been NO growth in the characters since the beginning, simply childish, lying and deceitful. After book 3 I was expecting some growth or arch of characters. There has been none!\n\n3) finally, the content of the stories is also nuts and morally questionable (I know taboo book, right?!?) but fr fr this is crazy."
