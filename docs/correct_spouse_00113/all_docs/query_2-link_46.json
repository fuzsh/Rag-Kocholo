        "text": "IT’S been more than 35 years since the release of Top Gun, but would you recognise Tom Cruise's love interest in the film if you bumped into her?\n\nProbably not.\n\nKelly McGillis played the flight instructor in the hit blockbuster that defined a generation, with her character falling in love with cheeky and brave fighter pilot Maverick.\n\nThe 1986 film about fighter pilots at America's combat flying school in Miramar saw Cruise playing cocky airman Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell.\n\nIt was the role that catapulted him to A-list stardom and inspired a whole generation with quotes like: \"I feel the need... the need for speed.\"\n\nBut the film's leading lady Kelly has barely been in the spotlight since starring in the role.\n\nThe actress, now 62, has long ditched her blonde perms for a much shorter hairstyle and often wears thick glasses.\n\nShe first found fame in 1985 after starring in Witness alongside Harrison Ford, receiving Golden Globe and BAFTA nomination for her performance.\n\nFollowing Top Gun, she starred opposite Jodie Forster in The Accused - a film, about the harrowing story of a woman who was gang raped, that she reportedly despised.\n\nAfter appearing in dozens of television and film roles throughout the 1990s, she took a break from acting for a few years.\n\nHer love for theatre saw her in plays like the Twelfth Night and The Merchant of Venice.\n\nKelly was previously married to Boyd Black and Fred Tillman, and she has two daughters, Kelsey and Sonora, from her second husband.\n\nIn 2009 she came out as a lesbian during an interview with SheWired.\n\nThe following year she entered into a civil union with Melanie Leis but they broke up five years ago. Kelly told Yahoo that she struggled with her identity and drugs for a few years before deciding to fix her life and get sober.\n\nShe moved with Leis to New Jersey, where she worked with drug addicts in a rehab facility.\n\nThe actress also volunteered to visit prisoners in a detention facility in the state.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nTop Gun 2 prepares for take off...and Tom Cruise is back in the cockpit\n\nTop Guns in sights of Ministry of Defence after being ordered to pay back £829,000 in overpaid wages\n\nTwo RAF top guns flying over golf course narrowly avoid drone which came within feet of disaster\n\nToday, Kelly lives in Hendersonville, North Carolina, and teaches acting at The New York Studio for Stage and Screen in Asheville, North Carolina."
