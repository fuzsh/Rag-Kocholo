Civil union: Kelly McGillis has married her long-term girlfriend Melanie Leis

Just over a year after she revealed that she was gay, Kelly McGillis has wed her long-term girlfriend in a civil union.

The actress, best known for her role in Top Gun, married sale executive Melanie Leis in New Jersey this week.

According to the New York Times, the couple tied the knot at the Collingswood Municipal Court in front of Judge Robert T. Zane III, on Wednesday.

McGillis, 53, and Leis, 42, a regional sales executive in Philadelphia with Independence Communications, met in 2000.

Leis was working behind the bar at a restaurant in Key West, Florida, that McGillis owned with her second husband, Fred Tillman, with whom she has two daughters: Kelsey Laure, 20, and Sonora Ashley, 17.

In May 2009, McGillis announced that she was gay, after years of being plagued about her sexuality.

McGillis, who has been married twice, came out during an interview with lesbian website Shewired.com.

She told the website that she had finally decided to 'move on with her life' and admit she was gay.

During the interview, she was asked if she was single before being questioned over whether she would now date a man or a woman. She replied: 'Definitely a woman. I'm done with the man thing'

She added: 'It's a part of being true to yourself. That's been a challenge for me personally.'

Last week, referring to that interview, McGillis said this week: 'That was one of those moments when somebody asked me a question, my kids had gone from home, so I really didnâ€™t have to protect anyone by skirting the question, and I just decided to be absolutely honest.'
