Actress Kelly McGillis, who came out last year, tied the knot with her partner, Melanie Leis, a sales executive, last week in a civil union ceremony in Collingswood, as reported in the New York Times.

The Top Gun and Witness star, married twice before, told The Inquirer's Carrie Rickey over the summer about her low-key life in Camden County.

The Times says the two met when Leis was a bartender at a restaurant in Key West, Fla., that McGillis owned with her second husband, Fred Tillman.
