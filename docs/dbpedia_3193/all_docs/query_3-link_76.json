        "text": "Ferrari’s racing DNA is one of the brand’s pride and that is seen on the F1 track. Scuderia Ferrari takes things to the next level when it comes to their F1 cars. The brand strives to achieve perfection with every year’s car and although the SF23 fell short of expectations, the names of the cars have always kept fans wondering what they will get to see next.\n\nThe thing is, Ferrari knows how to mark important milestones. For every car that will complete a milestone for the Formula 1 racing team, the machine gets a unique chassis name. While the classic name for most of the cars is Scuderia Ferrari, followed by the year number, here is a walk down memory lane across the last decade of the Prancing Horse F1 cars.\n\n2014-2024 Ferrari’s F1 evolution\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nFerrari’s history of naming their Formula 1 cars is characterized as scattered, unlike many other teams on the grid. While maintaining the normal line of SF-named cars, they often divert to share historical milestones. So let’s take a look at the evolution of Ferrari F1 car names in the last decade.\n\n2014 – F14-T:\n\nThe name F14-T follows the standard format, where “F” represents Ferrari, “14” denotes the year (2014), and “T” signifies Turbo, indicating the car’s turbocharged engine.\n\n2015 – SF15-T:\n\nThe SF15-T continues the convention, with “SF” representing Scuderia Ferrari, “15” denoting the year (2015), and “T” indicating the presence of a Turbo engine.\n\n2016 – SF16-H:\n\nThe SF16-H adheres to the tradition with “SF” for Scuderia Ferrari, “16” for the year (2016), and “H” for Hybrid, signifying the hybrid power unit.\n\n2017 – SF70-H:\n\nSF70-H signifies Scuderia Ferrari, the year 2017, and Hybrid. Additionally, “70” commemorates 70 years since the founding of the brand.\n\n2018 – SF71-H:\n\nThe SF71-H maintains the pattern with “SF” for Scuderia Ferrari, “71” for 71 years since its establishment, and “H” for Hybrid.\n\nRead More – WATCH: Charles Leclerc & Carlos Sainz Turn Into Beer Thieves as Ferrari Makes Mission Impossible-Styled Ad for Sponsors Peroni Nastro Azzurro 0.0%\n\n2019 – SF90:\n\nSF90 represents Scuderia Ferrari and the 90th anniversary of the team in 2019.\n\n2020 – F1000:\n\nF1000 follows the standard format with “F” for Ferrari and “1000” to mark the team’s 1000th Formula 1 Grand Prix in 2020.\n\n2021 – SF21:\n\nSF21 adheres to the convention with “SF” for Scuderia Ferrari and “21” for the year 2021.\n\n2022 – F1-75:\n\nF1-75 follows the tradition with “F1” for Formula 1 and “75” marking 75 years since Ferrari’s first Formula 1 race.\n\n2023 – SF-23:\n\nSF-23 continues the standard convention with “SF” for Scuderia Ferrari and “23” representing the year 2023.\n\n2024 – SF-24:\n\nFinally, we have the SF-24, which was previously named Project 676, again following the Scuderia Ferrari and year number format.\n\nWhile the SF-24 is not revealed yet, there are quite a few talks about it within the paddocks. Fans and analysts are trying to figure out what Ferrari has done to the cars to give Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz the machine they deserve to beat their competition.\n\nWhat does Ferrari have in the works for the SF-24?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nFerrari’s car for the 2024 Formula 1 season will be named SF-24, continuing a tradition established in recent years. The nomenclature involves using “SF” for Scuderia Ferrari, followed by the number of the current year. This tradition started with the SF15-T in 2015 during the second hybrid season of Formula 1.\n\nOver the winter break, the 2024 Ferrari F1 car was known by the codename “Project 676.” The brand has a history of using internal project names before revealing the official chassis name. Ferrari’s announcement of SF-24 reflects a departure from their historical inconsistency in naming their Formula 1 cars. The SF-24 follows the SF-23 from the 2023 season, marking a logical digit increase in chassis numbering.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWatch This Story | F1 veteran shocked as Charles Leclerc’s bratty behavior is overlooked by Ferrari in surprising decision\n\nNoteworthy is the mention that the SF-24 marks the first time since 2018 that Ferrari has used a logical digit increase to signify a new chassis, providing a clearer progression in their naming strategy."
