        "text": "If you put all your Hot Wheels in a bag, close your eyes, and choose one at random … you are likely to find a car maker with whom this guy had some sort of rivalry or grudge.\n\nToday’s protagonist was born with an unquenchable thirst for speed, an unbridled passion for winning, and the resolve to design & build the most powerful engines the world had ever seen. To achieve his dreams, it was only natural that he would create a few enemies along the way.\n\nHis motto was “Think and act as a winner. That’s how you will achieve your objective.”\n\nHis favorite car was “The one I haven’t designed yet!”.\n\nHis name was Enzo Ferrari, a name that needs no further introduction.\n\nFerrari\n\nvs\n\nThe Flu\n\nEnzo Anselmo Ferrari was born in Modena, northern Italy on February 18, 1898. Due to a heavy snowfall, his parents had to wait for two days before the birth could be recorded. Mom Adalgisa came from a wealthy family of landowners, while dad Alfredo had set up a mechanic workshop, employing 30 workers and providing metal parts to national railways.\n\nEnzo was the youngest of two sons. With older brother Alfredo Jr, nicknamed ‘Dino’, he shared several passions. The earliest one was for sports journalism: at the tender age of nine, Enzo had one of his articles published by the largest national sports paper in Italy:\n\n“Inter Milan defeats Modena 7 – 1”\n\nNext, Enzo wanted to become an opera singer. Every Saturday night, dad would take Enzo and Dino to the theatre: As Enzo fell in love with every other girl who could hit a high note, he figured the best chance for him to score with the ladies of the stage was to become a tenor.\n\nEnzo’s third and most enduring passion was speed. Since a very young age, the Ferrari brothers could be seen whizzing around Modena on their roller skates and bicycles, but it was clear this was not enough.\n\nIn 1908, Alfredo took the two boys to a motor race in nearby Bologna. It was a revelation, a new obsession that slowly started replacing all other interests.\n\nEnzo and Dino spent the following years building confidence on rickety motorcycles and practicing their autographs, already thinking about their successes.\n\nBut then, calendars turned to May 1915, when Italy joined the Entente in WWI, Dino was drafted into the Army and sent to fight the Austro-Hungarians. He was exposed to many dangers, of course, but the one that proved most lethal did not carry rifles nor bayonets. In 1916, an outbreak of flu claimed the boy’s life. If that wasn’t enough, the same epidemic may have been the cause for Alfredo’s Sr death, during the same year.\n\nIn the span of just a few months, Enzo had lost both his beloved big brother and father. Moreover, the family business had collapsed, and the young Ferrari had to provide for his mother and himself. Enzo dropped out of school and found a job as an instructor in a school for metalworkers.\n\nBut the experience didn’t last long. He was soon over the age of 18, and it was time for him to be conscripted, too.\n\nEnzo was assigned to the 3rd Regiment of Alpine artillery. Thanks to his skill as a mechanic and a metal worker, he was assigned the delicate task of maintaining and repairing the sophisticated machinery used by Alpine troops to carry artillery pieces up mountain tops and glaciers, i.e. mules and donkeys. So, yeah, Ferrari spent his war years changing shoe horses – mule horses? – almost frozen to death on some mountain top.\n\nNow, remember that flu that had claimed Alfredo Sr and Dino? Some believe it was an early-round of what later became known as the ‘Spanish flu’. During the winter of 1918, Enzo was unlucky enough to fall sick early on during the pandemic. However, it may have been a blessing in disguise, as he was sent to a hospital far away from the front: there, he fully recovered and was later honorably discharged, before the war ended in November.\n\nAround the same period, Enzo moved to Turin, seeking employment as a test driver and mechanic with FIAT. Enzo did not land the job but was hired instead by a much smaller company, CMN.\n\nC.M.N. stands for Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali.\n\nWhich stands for … well, whatever that caption says. By early 1919, he was still a test driver, but later that year, he was promoted to race driver and made his much-coveted debut in the world of professional car racing.\n\nFerrari\n\nVs\n\nOxen\n\nThe occasion was the uphill race from Parma to another place called Poggio di Berceto, and Ferrari was at the wheel of a CMN model 15/20, running a 4-cylinder, 2.3-liter engine. Enzo arrived in a solid 4th position, not bad for a beginner, but he knew he could do better. On the 23rd of November, the CMN team got him to race at the ‘Targa Florio’, one of the most prestigious motoring competitions in Italy. That… was a disaster. The fuel tank developed a serious problem, which lost Enzo more than 40 minutes.\n\nAfter a brief stint with Isotta Fraschini, Enzo was hired by the heavyweights of the time, Alfa Romeo. At the next Targa Florio, in November 1920, Enzo was driving an Alfa 40/60, with a roaring 6-liter engine, that got him to second position at the finishing line.\n\nThis marked the beginning of a long and fruitful collaboration between the present and future masters of the race tracks. In 1921, Enzo scored another silver medal with Alfa Romeo, but also experienced his first accident. This happened at the Grand Prix of Brescia, where a herd of oxen had decided to take a walk across the track during the race! Enzo steered away on time, but his 40/60 skidded off the road and crashed to a halt.\n\nOxen aside, Ferrari met few obstacles in his growth as a solidly famous – albeit not stellar — professional driver.\n\nIn 1923, Enzo married his fiancée Laura Garello. He had been attracted to her by her sense of humor, and she had initially been attracted to him thanks to his glamourous occupation as a jockey on wheels. But she soon started to resent Enzo’s absolute dedication to motor racing. Laura was also concerned about Enzo’s own safety and tried to steer him toward more ‘stable’ careers. But Enzo was too stubborn. He later joked that if Laura had had her way, he would have switched from driving cars to driving trams.\n\nStill in 1923, Enzo scored another important victory in the city of Ravenna, not far from his hometown. On that occasion, he got to meet two of his VIP fans, Count Baracca and his wife Paolina. The Baraccas had lost a son during WWI, as many more had, including the Ferraris. Their son, Captain Francesco Baracca, was a certified flying ace, having downed 34 enemy planes during the conflict.\n\nLegend has it that after defeating in a dog fight a German hailing from Stuttgart, he had adopted as an emblem for his fighter plane the heraldic animal of that city.\n\nAnd after that victory in Ravenna, Countess Paolina wanted to make a gift to Enzo: why didn’t he adopt the same animal, a symbol of speed and power, as a lucky charm? Enzo agreed: since that day, all his cars would be painted with the emblem, which later became almost synonymous with his name.\n\nAnd this is how the rearing black horse first became the symbol of a flying ace, then made it to the logos of not one, but two legendary sports car manufacturers, on both sides of the Alps: Ferrari and the Stuttgart-based Porsche.\n\nThe rearing horse must have worked its charm, because in 1924, Enzo won yet another cup, the ‘Coppa Acerbo’, which brought him to the attention of Italy’s Prime Minister, Benito Mussolini, who awarded Ferrari with a Knighthood.\n\nDuring the same year, Enzo got to meet the Big Man himself. The Duce was visiting a Senator in Modena and Ferrari was given the honor to lead the motorcade of the Prime Minister. After the first stop, Ferrari was accosted by Mussolini’s chauffeur with a request. Could he drive slower for the next leg of the trip? Apparently, Mussolini had insisted on driving himself in his official limo, so that he might prove he could keep up with the famous racer. He had kept up with Ferrari, but had almost killed all his passengers in the process!\n\nIn July of 1925, Ferrari experienced for the first time the death of a friend at the wheel. This was Antonio Ascari, the star pilot of the Alfa Romeo team, who crashed his Alfa P2 while in the lead at the French Grand Prix. Ascari had been more than a friend — he was a role model who would later inspire many of Ferrari’s business decisions.\n\nBut the show had to go on, and the team needed a new driver. Enzo put forward the perfect candidate: Tazio Nuvolari, a promising motorcycle racer.\n\nThe real experts among you will recognize the name of this legendary driver, whom Ferdinand Porsche described as “the greatest driver of the past, present and future”.\n\nTazio was Enzo’s polar opposite: physically diminutive but absolutely reckless, he did not have any qualms in completely wrecking his cars in order to get a victory. Thanks to his talent the Alfa team continued accumulating trophies, and so did Enzo.\n\nOver the following years Ferrari won two more Grand Prix, this time on an Alfa Romeo 6C-1500 SS;\n\nThe biggest professional achievement of this period was the 1929 foundation of the “Scuderia Ferrari”, or the “Ferrari motor stable”: this would be the new official denomination of Alfa Romeo’s racing team, managed, both on and off the track, by Enzo. Under his direction, the ‘Scuderia’ participated in 22 races, winning 8 of them.\n\nEnzo’s wife Laura may have disapproved of racing as a dangerous occupation, but took a keen interest in the managerial aspect of leading a ‘motor stable’. She was frequently seen at the garages and training tracks, sometimes providing valuable support to Enzo, sometimes overstepping the mark with her meddling – we’ll see later how this would become a recurrent problem.\n\n1929 also marked Enzo’s first significant meeting with the lady who became his long-term mistress: Lina Lardi. A daughter of an acquaintance, Enzo had briefly met Lina when she was 14.\n\nNow, Enzo was 31, and Lina was 19. He greeted the girl with the pick-up line,\n\n“How did you get so beautiful, in so little time?”\n\nWhich is kind of cringey, but it did work!\n\nFerrari\n\nvs\n\nMaserati\n\nOn August 9, 1931, Tazio Nuvolari, the new star of the Ferrari team, won the Three Provinces rally, a coveted cup. Ferrari finished a very close second. This event is significant not only because it could have been another trophy In Enzo’s cabinet, and not only because it marked the rise of Nuvolari, but because this was the last race, ever, for the racer from Modena. The tipping point was Laura’s pregnancy: he wasn’t going to risk his life and leave his unborn child fatherless.\n\nEnzo’s first child was born on January 19, 1932. His name was Alfredo, aka ‘Dino’, in honor of Enzo’s beloved brother. Just like the other Dino, Enzo’s son would face an unlucky destiny. The little boy was born with a congenital disease, muscular dystrophy, which leads to a progressive weakening of the muscles and severe disability.\n\nEnzo would remain extremely close to his son, doing anything possible to find a cure for Muscular Dystrophy, or at least alleviate his suffering. Biographers have speculated that Enzo’s constant worry at Dino’s condition may have had a negative impact on his personality, making him a more somber and short-tempered person than he used to be.\n\nDuring the 1930s, though, Enzo’s headaches were still mainly of a professional nature. A rival shop had just opened in town: the Maserati car shop and racing team. The Maserati brothers had first set up their workshop in Bologna, but in the early 1930s, they had moved operations to Modena, just a short stone’s throw from Scuderia Ferrari HQ.\n\nThe Maserati were basically doing what Ferrari had been dreaming of doing, but hadn’t realized yet: building their cars AND racing the same cars under their own name.\n\nAfter moving to Modena, the Maseratis seemed set on humiliating Enzo, so they poached his star driver, Nuvolari. During most of 1934, Maserati dominated Scuderia Ferrari thanks to Nuvolari’s victories on a 6C 34.\n\nNuvolari piled it on by having several bales of hay delivered to Ferrari – the joke being that Alfa Romeos ran on donkey-power, rather than the considerable horsepower of the Maseratis.\n\nSomeone like Enzo Ferrari would not tolerate that level of trolling, especially from someone who looked like a gnome.\n\nFerrari and his team of engineers set their minds on designing a new car that would put Nuvolari and Maserati in their place, and that was another legendary piece of engineering: the Alfa Romeo 158, or “Alfetta.”\n\nIt wasn’t long before the 158 bagged a first position at the ‘Ciano Cup’, a first AND second position at the Grand Prix of Milan, and a first, second, AND third position at the Grand Prix of Tripoli.\n\nAll this happened during the 1937-1938 period, years in which Alfa Romeo had decided to formally absorb Scuderia Ferrari within their ranks.\n\nOn September 6, 1939, Enzo Ferrari quit Alfa Romeo for good, with a special clause in his severance package: he would refrain from using ‘Ferrari’ in any mechanical, car manufacturing or racing enterprise. And so he did, naming his newly founded company ‘A.A.C.’, which stands for this name below, which you can mispronounce on your own.\n\nAuto Avio Costruzioni\n\nIn 1940, AAC debuted with the model 815, which looked like something Golden Age Bruce Wayne would fill with gadgets. The 815 participated in the ‘Mille Miglia’, a thousand-mile-long road race with legendary status, but the results were not impressive.\n\nVery soon, Ferrari would need to face challenges of another kind, as Italy broke its non-belligerent status and fully entered WWII. Like many other mechanical firms, AAC would have to serve the war effort.\n\nFerrari\n\nVs\n\nThe Partisans/The Fascists/The Allies\n\nIn 1943, Ferrari moved his plant from Modena to the smaller town of Maranello.\n\nMeanwhile, in Rome, the Grand Council of the Fascist Party had voted Mussolini out of power on the 25th of July. This was followed by the surprise declaration of an armistice on the 8th of September; as a consequence, Northern Italy would be occupied by German and Fascist forces, locked in a civil war with Resistance fighters of many denominations: monarchists, Catholics and communist partisans.\n\nThe latter were known for exacting a sort of protection money on rich landowners and factory tycoons. Ferrari was no exception, and he regularly paid his dues. The left-wing resistance brigades did not consider him in a good light, as he had gained a reputation as a supporter of the Fascist Regime. He had accepted that AAC would be converted into a plant to manufacture tank components and other spare parts for the war effort, and he was good friends with one Edoardo Weber, the king of carburettors, a staunch supporter of the Fascist Republic now installed in the North.\n\nThe communist brigades had tolerated Ferrari for several months, but in October of 1944, a special tribunal had issued a death sentence for him. Before they could carry out the penalty, though, they needed a final judgement from their man who knew him best: one Giuseppe Zanarini, the partisan who collected protection money from Ferrari.\n\nWhen Zanarini went to meet Ferrari, he found him pale, tired and solemn. He had just heard the news that Weber, his carburettor friend, had been executed by the partisans in Bologna. Enzo had a hunch that he would be next.\n\nIn his later memoirs, Zanarini reported how Ferrari did not appear scared, only sad, that he would not live long enough to fully realise the dream he had been pursuing for years, to build and develop his own cars. After a long and tense conversation, Zanarini settled on a compromise: if Ferrari could ‘donate’ to the resistance 500,000 Liras – that’s about 600,000 USD in today’s money – they would let him live. Enzo asked for 12 days to find the money, and Zanarini agreed.\n\nLater, the partisan reported back to his superiors that Ferrari could be more useful to their cause if he stayed alive. And indeed he would be useful. After paying his ticket for survival, Ferrari proceed to actively collaborate with the resistance, using his factory to hide stashes of weapons and ammo, which would then be forwarded to the partisans. He was even given custody of the underground Communist Party’s secret archives, which he hid at his home. On at least one occasion he even performed a delicate mission. he used his car to smuggle out of Modena the Fascist Mayor, a double-agent for the resistance, to secret meetings with partisan leaders. The Mayor was under suspicion from the Fascist secret police and Enzo was risking arrest, too, by facilitating these meetings.\n\nOn top of all this, Ferrari had to look after the day-to-day running of his company. He had to adapt its production to the demands of the Ministry of War, meaning that by end of 1944, most of AAC’s output consisted of hydraulic honing machines … which I confess I have no idea what they are, nor what was their importance to the war effort. The Allies must have had a better idea, because they bombed Ferrari’s plant twice, in November 1944 and February 1945.\n\nA New Beginning\n\nAfter the bloody conclusion of World War II, Ferrari had two more reasons to celebrate: first, the birth of his second son Piero, born from his relationship with Lina Lardi. Then, he officially changed his company’s name to ‘Ferrari’ and released the first vehicle on his name, the Ferrari 125 S.\n\nThe 125 S was the first of many Ferraris to carry a V12 engine, which has two banks of six cylinders each, arranged in a ‘V’ shape, at a 60° angle.\n\nThe following ten years were a decade of success.\n\nFerrari scooped a third position at the 1948 Grand Prix of Italy and then went on to win the ‘Thousand Miles’ road race. In October, at Lake Garda, Enzo scored his first victory against his old employers, Alfa Romeo.\n\nIn 1949, the Ferrari team participated in 49 competitions, winning 30.\n\nWhen the first Formula 1 World Championship took place in Silverstone, on May 13, 1950, the Ferrari team was not there. Enzo was biding his time; he wanted to make sure his ‘scuderia’ was ready for a victory.\n\nA huge victory came in July 1951, when Ferrari driver Froilàn Gonzales beat legendary Alfa Romeo pilot Manuel Fangio. This defeat was a tipping point for Alfa, whose leadership decided to abandon racing for good. Regarding the implications of this win, Enzo Ferrari said:\n\n“Today, I have killed my mother”\n\nWith Alfa out of the way, Enzo had free rein: in 1952 and 1953, his Scuderia won the F1 World Championship twice in a row. Naturally, all these victories would fill newspaper headlines, meaning plenty of free advertising for Ferrari’s other line of work, his “regular” cars for private clients.\n\nEnzo and his team designed at least 20 different models in the 1950s, mostly in their distinctive flame red. Enzo’s eldest son Dino, a gifted engineer, had been working on an evolution of the V12 engine, requiring only 6 cylinders, i.e. the V6 1500 cm3\n\nUnfortunately, Dino would not see the new line of cars to fruition. His muscular dystrophy had been degenerating his body for years, and he died on the June 30, 1956, at age 24.\n\nEnzo Ferrari never recovered from the death of his son. According to friends and co-workers, his personality became even more introverted, sombre and confrontational, almost dictatorial at work. He started wearing his signature sunglasses, which he never removed in public, as a sign of mourning. Ferrari even decided to never attend another race, and he stopped frequenting theatres, cinemas, and concert halls.\n\nLater in life, he made a confession to a biographer. Shortly before Dino’s death, Father and son had been on a mountain trip. Not bearing the thought of watching him slowly die, Enzo had been one breath away from hugging Dino and jumping to their deaths from a cliff. The only thought that had kept him from this gesture was that of his other son, Piero, who was not even 10 at the time.\n\nFollowing Dino’s death, Enzo only had a few peaceful years to mourn, before the start of the worst decade for his company, the 1960s.\n\nFerrari\n\nVs\n\nFerrari\n\n1961 was the year that risked ending it all, the year of ‘The Great Ferrari Walkout’.\n\nIt all started with Enzo’s wife Laura and her increased involvement in company affairs. This meddling did not sit well with Sales Managers Girolamo Gardini, who threatened to leave if Laura wasn’t removed from company affairs. Guess what? Gardini was fired.\n\nBut the sales manager was not the only executive with a grudge against Mrs. Ferrari. Eight more key employees had Gardini’s back. When their pal was dismissed, the eight executives staged a mass walkout, leaving Ferrari without some of his best people and with upcoming sports car projects in limbo.\n\nSome of the engineers even went to create a rival company, ATS, which still produces high-end supercars to this day.\n\nRacing-wise, Ferrari had a good year, apparently. He secured both the World Championship of Drivers and the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers title in 1961. But the glory from trophies could not hide the tragic trend of accidents involving Ferrari’s drivers.\n\nIn 1957, drivers Castellotti and Portago had fatal crashes in two separate races, both of which resulted in audience injuries, too. In 1958, it was drivers Musso and Collins, who died two weeks apart. All these accidents led to the worst tragedy by far, Wolfgang Von Trips’ accident at the Monza track on September the 10 1961, a crash which claimed the lives of the driver and 14 spectators.\n\nIt got so bad that even the Vatican was involved — inside the pages of its official newspapers, the Holy See compared Enzo Ferrari to Cronus of Greek Mythology, the Titan who devoured his own children.\n\nFerrari\n\nVs\n\nTractors\n\nSometime in 1963, Enzo had a spat with one of his clients, a local producer of boilers and tractors. This client had struck it rich with his machinery and had treated himself to a Ferrari 250 GT. He didn’t just cruise around on weekends, though; he raced full-speed at the Cannonball, an underground championship of amateur drivers.\n\nThe tractor man had noticed that the GT’s clutch would give way too often, and so he frequently went to Maranello to have it fixed or replaced straight at the source. On one occasion, he met Enzo himself and he dared to give him some advice on how to improve his clutches. Ferrari’s reply was predictable:\n\n“What do you know about cars? Go back to your tractors!”\n\nThe Cannonball driver took it as a challenge. He went back to his workshop and gathered a team of leading engineers and designers, some of them Ferrari veterans.\n\nAlong the way, they realised that Ferrari used the same basic clutch components as their tractors – only they charged them 10 times as much to existing clients! It was a revelation, which only steeled their determination: sports cars had a higher profit margin than tractors, and one single sale would generate way more continuous income through sales of over-priced parts. In November, their first model was presented at a car event in Turin: the 350 GT.\n\nThe tractor guy was called Ferruccio Lamborghini, and Ferrari had just created a fierce and worthy competitor, chipping away at the niche market of luxury sports cars.\n\nFerrari\n\nVs\n\nFord\n\nOne of the sporting events the Scuderia Ferrari had been dominating was the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a test of endurance and car reliability, more than speed.\n\nAfter Ferrari won the 1962 Le Mans, worldwide press celebrated the event – more and more free advertising coverage for the team at Maranello. Apparently, this angered Henry Ford II. He, alongside many other American car giants, was prevented from racing by a self-imposed ‘motorsport ban’. In an interview, Ford blurted out that he spent billions in ads for his cars, but ‘that mechanic’ ended up on newspapers all across the world, for free! The ‘mechanic’ retorted:\n\n“If Mr. Ford wants to be on the papers for free, all he has to do is buy a Ferrari”.\n\nThis was the initial salvo to an epic rivalry. Ford was intrigued by the chance to use motor racing as a means to promote car sales. So, to circumvent the motorsport ban on American cars, he extended an offer to buy Ferrari. The Maranello company had been struggling lately, due to the high costs involved in maintaining the racing team, and the increasing number of competitors.\n\nSo, Enzo considered Henry’s offer to acquire Ferrari. He had one condition: he would remain at the helm of the racing team, with no intervention whatsoever from Ford’s executives. When Enzo realised he may not obtain that, he abruptly put an end to all negotiations.\n\nFord was bent on revenge, now: his mission became to defeat Ferrari on the track.\n\nTossing the motorsport ban aside, Ford invested a sum that was 10 times what he had offered to Enzo, just to build his own racing team. He hired driving royalty like Carrol Shelby, Bruce McLaren, Chris Amon and Ken Miles.\n\nNext, he had his engineers develop from scratch a car to beat the Ferraris at Le Mans, the GT40. The first duel took place at Le Mans 1964, and it was a defeat for the Americans. The following year, the Italians came on top again.\n\nHenry Ford wanted that victory at any cost. He bankrolled an unlimited budget to his racing director Carrol Shelby, who went for quantity as well as quality, fielding thirteen GT40s at the race. Four of them had to withdraw, but eventually, the strategy worked out: three of the GT40s cut the finishing line, one after the other.\n\nFerrari found a revenge of sorts the following year, when three of his cars achieved a similar feat at the Daytona race … but it was Le Mans that counted! In 1967, the two car giants faced each other again, and again Ford won.\n\nSince that defeat, a Ferrari has never managed to win again at Le Mans.\n\nEnzo surely did not despair too much, as his cars kept on racking up trophies at Formula 1 Grand Prix’s. But he still had to sort out some new alliance that could keep his company afloat.\n\nEnter the Italian car giant, FIAT. The Turin corporation put forward a Godfather offer that Enzo could not refuse.\n\nFIAT pumped 2 Billion Liras in cash into Ferrari, demanding in exchange 50% of all shares, as well as the designs for Ferrari’s engines. FIAT would also use their extensive plants to mass produce the road cars, on which they could earn a revenue.\n\nBut the most important clause was the one that recognised Enzo’s full autonomy in managing the racing team. Racing – that’s what always counted to him, everything else was collateral. Ferrari gradually relinquished control over his company, leaving to FIAT up to 90% of the overall shares. This allowed him to concentrate on scoring victory after victory in Formula 1. All in all, it has been estimated that the Scuderia Ferrari – in both its pre- and post-war incarnations – collected 5,000 victories worldwide.\n\nFerrari\n\nVs\n\nThe Bodysnatchers\n\nAs Enzo entered his eighth decade on Earth, he was forced to reduce his overall activity, but he also enjoyed some well-deserved rewards. In 1970, he received the Gold Medal for Culture and the Arts by the President of the Republic, in recognition for his contribution to Italian sports and economy. This was followed by another Presidential honorific, that of ‘Knight of Grand Cross of the Italian Republic’.\n\nOn February 27, 1978, his wife Laura died of natural causes. It was only at this point that he could formally recognize his illegitimate son, Piero.\n\nPiero could take on the Ferrari surname and was given a seat on the Ferrari board of directors, progressively replacing his father in company work and social engagements.\n\nIn 1987, Ferrari unveiled the last car to be produced under Enzo’s supervision, the iconic F40. This is probably the one you had as a Hot Wheels or Burago model …\n\nFerrari was now 89 years of age and had been suffering from kidney disease for a long time. It was a very ill Enzo who walked into Modena’s University to collect an honorary degree in physics.\n\nA few months later, on the August 14, 1988, Enzo Ferrari quietly passed away. By his own wish, his funeral was a very small ceremony that was opened only to a small number of family members and old friends.\n\nDo I need to talk about Enzo Ferrari’s legacy? Given the impact of his company, the incredibly high standards of his cars, and the victories of the Scuderia Ferrari, the Italian Titan obviously led a successful, influential life. Ferrari has been celebrated in books, films, and television; either through encouragement or outright rivalry, Enzo has inspired a generation of engineers and manufacturers to push the boundaries on what a car should look and drive like.\n\nWe’ll end with an anecdote that reveals Enzo Ferrari’s enduring appeal. In March 2017, Italian military police busted a big drug-trafficking gang in a massive operation that spanned five regions. One of the 34 arrested felons confessed to one of their master plans to raise cash for the gang:\n\nThe kidnapping of Enzo Ferrari’s body from Modena’s cemetery.\n\nThe gang had already figured out an escape route and where to hide the body. Their plan was to demand a ransom of millions of Euros from a relative, presumably Piero. Luckily, they were stopped on time, but this crazy plan shows how large he loomed during his lifetime — so big that his corporeal body may never find peace.\n\nGeneral biographies and Interviews\n\nhttps://tg24.sky.it/cronaca/2018/08/13/enzo-ferrari-chi-era.html\n\nhttps://www.motorwebmuseum.it/luoghi/modena/la-storia-di-enzo-ferrari/\n\nhttps://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/enzo-ferrari\n\nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BfFHSYJwOUwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=enzo+ferrari&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSoOPbmp_mAhUFlFwKHWPgAeQQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=enzo%20ferrari&f=false\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MwVYzLHMtZE\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KfKgAG5_83c\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8ArVstXlT64\n\nFord v Ferrari\n\nhttps://www.lautomobile.aci.it/articoli/2019/11/13/ford-vs-ferrari-laltra-storia-di-rivalita.html\n\nFerrari vs Lamborghini\n\nhttps://www.quartamarcia.it/la-lite-tra-ferrari-e-lamborghini-una-grande-bugia/\n\nFerrari vs Maserati\n\nhttps://ilferraristablog.it/le-grandi-sfide-ferrari-maserati-mito-e-rivalita/\n\nFerrari vs WWII\n\nhttps://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2011/09/10/la-guerra-segreta-di-enzo-ferrari-cosi-aiuto-i-partigiani/156663/\n\nhttps://www.repubblica.it/online/cronaca/ferrari/diario/diario.html\n\nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JD2VZwEACAAJ&dq=enzo+ferrari&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSoOPbmp_mAhUFlFwKHWPgAeQQ6AEIVzAH\n\nFerrari vs The Body Snatchers\n\nhttps://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2017/03/28/sardegna-banda-criminale-voleva-trafugare-la-salma-di-enzo-ferrari/3481474/\n\nFerrari vs Ferrari"
