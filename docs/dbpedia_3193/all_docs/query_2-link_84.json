        "text": "Ferrari sure love to make things dramatic since returning to the highest levels of endurance sportscar racing, huh?\n\nIn 2023, the winning #51 Ferrari 499P nearly collapsed in the final hour after a problem trying to start the car after a pit stop. In 2024, the door of the sister #50 car wouldn’t stay fastened, backing them into an impossible fuel-save scenario to make the race without stopping again.\n\nIt wasn’t as glamorous as Danish wunderkind Nicklas Nielsen’s opening-hour dash to the front from fourth on the grid, but he, and co-drivers Antonio Fuoco and Miguel Molina, have given the proud Prancing Horse of Maranello its 11th overall victory in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the 499P’s second straight win at the fabled, mythical Grand Prix d’Endurance.\n\nNielsen had the speed early on, but it was the call to stay out on slick tyres while rivals around them pitted for wets when the first rain shower arrived that really marked the #50 out as a contender for the victory.\n\nThey had competition – not just from Porsche, Toyota, and Cadillac – but also from within, particularly from the yellow “private label” AF Corse #83 Ferrari (Robert Kubica/Robert Shwartzman/Ye Yifei) that challenged up at the front until a hybrid system failure brought a cruel end to their race with less than four hours until the finish.\n\nAnd then with three hours left, that old, sick Tifosi feeling that usually accompanies Ferrari’s modern Formula One endeavours started rolling back in.\n\nIt started with a power spike that caught the attention of the ACO’s stewards, in both red factory cars. This ended up being a non-factor as it was the first time they’d been even momentarily out of compliance all race.\n\nThe latest in a series of rain showers began with two hours left, but Nielsen had trouble keeping the cockpit door shut. He’d eventually be forced to surrender a ten-second lead to allow the AF Corse mechanics to fix the problem during the pit stop. And when that stop was done, Nielsen was released into the path of the #37 COOL Racing ORECA LMP2 which warranted an investigation into an unsafe release.\n\nWhile the explanation may not satisfy every reader – certainly not in this era of the tribalistic “football-ification of motor racing” – race control did note that the #50 Ferrari didn’t enter the fast lane in front of the #37 ORECA and, in fact, dropped behind the other car to get into the fast lane before leaving the pits.\n\nBut the fact remained that with just over an hour to go, the #50’s race was already ruined. They were out of sequence to the #7 Toyota Gazoo Racing car – and surely, after Nielsen pitted with 50 minutes left, he couldn’t squeeze another 13 laps out of a single charge of fuel and hybrid battery without stopping again. Logic dictated 12 was the limit…right?\n\nThe rain, and a slow zone for a stranded LMGT3 car, helped Nielsen avoid running at full chat longer than he needed to – but he still had to drive a mistake-free final stint in treacherous conditions, dodging slower traffic around him. He did just that, and while it was so close, Nielsen had enough to power his Rosso Scuderia Ferrari to the finish line.\n\n“It was, to be honest, a very long one,” said Nielsen. “Especially after the issue we had with the door…I actually thought everything was lost.\n\n“I knew the pace was really good in the wet by the end. I mean, it was a very long last lap as well.\n\n“I don’t even know what to say. It’s just amazing to be here. To finally win the race that I’ve always wanted to win. Seeing the sister car win it last year, was obviously a proud moment for everyone.\n\n“And then, I think for us to take it this year – it’s an even greater achievement to do it back to back.”\n\nNielsen had successfully climbed the ladder from karting champion, to one-make ace in Audis and Ferrari Challenges, to a class winner in 2021, to making the Hypercar team last year – and now, the biggest win of his life, the outright win at Le Mans, to join his countrymen John Nielsen and Tom Kristensen in the champions’ roll of honour.\n\nThis win also completes a journey for the #50 car’s talismanic young ace, Fuoco. Some time ago, Fuoco was a member of the Ferrari Driver Academy with visions of driving for the Maranello marque in Formula One, but at 22, his momentum stalled.\n\nFerrari didn’t lose faith in him, bringing him into the GT Competizione fold in 2019, and he made himself an undeniable candidate for the 499P’s inaugural roster of drivers.\n\nFuoco has often been brilliant these last 15 months since the 499P’s debut at Sebring. His pole on debut, and his pole last year at Le Mans. Spellbinding speed and ruthless aggression in wheel-to-wheel combat. At times that brilliance has descended into madness – his Rolex 24 at Daytona this year was an exercise in frustration for many, himself included.\n\nBut he had the speed, and he battled hard with the likes of his fellow FDA alum Shwartzman for positions, and today he was utterly brilliant.\n\nSpare a thought as well for the senior driver of the trio, Molina. The 35-year-old veteran enjoyed a solid if unspectacular career in the super silhouette era of DTM, and has surpassed anything he’d achieved before since joining Ferrari as a GT driver in 2017: Championship titles in America and Europe, class wins in big endurance races like the Spa 24 Hours. He and Fuoco were GTE Pro’s last winners in WEC competition.\n\nYet this is the Spaniard’s sweetest victory in his 20-year career as a racing driver, from his ascendancy as a teenager in Spanish junior formula racing to this, the pinnacle of his craft – in the elite company of the two countrymen who’ve won this race before: Fernando Alonso and Marc Gene.\n\n“Actually, a couple of times, a couple of moments in the race, we risked to stay on slicks,” said Molina about the strategy. “And also, the last call to change to the wets was the right moment.\n\n“I mean, it’s unbelievable. We’ve been looking for this result for so long, and we are really proud.\n\n“Today was our day, actually! We experienced some tense moments, but we could go through them. And at the end, the result was here. I’m really proud of everyone that is involved in this project.”\n\nAnd just as it was when they won last year – if this is the only race the Ferrari 499P wins this year? What a race to win! But after Le Mans, with half a WEC season still to run, it likely won’t be based on the formbook.\n\nUntil those final moments, the #7 Toyota should have been the favourite to win – and what an incredible story it would have been, to overcome all the adversity this crew had leading up to the big race.\n\nMike Conway suffered injuries in a cycling accident that rendered him unable to drive. Suddenly, José Maria López, who seemed as if he was done in top-tier prototypes, was back in the GR010 again as his substitute.\n\nKamui Kobayashi, the driver and honourary Team Principal who’s a national hero in Japan, spun off course trying to reel off a monster lap in Qualifying Practice, and his error actually caused his car to start from the very back of the 23-car Hypercar class field.\n\nAnd then at mid-day Saturday, Nyck de Vries – the new man in the #7 Toyota this year, fresh off Formula One’s discard pile – crashed in the Warm-Up session, into a Toyota family member: A customer Lexus LMGT3 car that was slowing on the racing line.\n\nSo with a damaged car that had to be hastily repaired just to make the start of the race on time, and after De Vries struggled to pick his way past slower cars early in the race, it seemed all hope was lost before the sun even set on Saturday night.\n\nBut they never quit and never stopped overcoming obstacles – whether it was De Vries having to pit just after the 9:10 AM restart due to oil on the windscreen, or two slow punctures for Kobayashi and Lopez respectively.\n\nThe Ferrari’s misfortune seemed like it’d be the chance for Toyota to finally make things right after the bitter frustration of last year. The perfect story – the team that had every obstacle thrown at it, coming back from a would-be-record 23rd place to win Le Mans for the sixth time in seven years.\n\nBut it wasn’t to be. Lopez had his hair-raising moments in the final stint, yes – but perhaps, the sum of all those hardships was just too much to overcome in the end. For the second year in a row, Toyota finished second.\n\nIt’s better than what some of Toyota’s supporters, and some of Toyota’s staff, had feared – given their comparatively lacklustre 2024 form heading into Le Mans versus this time a year ago. Just to persevere as the #7 crew did, was an accomplishment that everyone is genuinely proud of.\n\nBut this loss still stings, just as it did last year – and it will continue to sting for, perhaps, another 12 months until they get another opportunity.\n\n“I think it was an extremely eventful race. Very challenging,” remarked De Vries. “Conditions were changing constantly, and for us in the car, and the people, it was very stressful – and it didn’t end until the very end. I think that was a big challenge for everyone.\n\n“How do I feel? I feel bittersweet.\n\n“We feel like, you know, ‘what if?’ Quite a lot of little glitches, here and there, through the race – which weren’t, maybe, visible from the outside, but which we experienced inside.\n\n“And we felt like, we could have maybe had a closer shot. But at the end of the day, that’s part of racing.”\n\nThis could have also been the chance for the #8 Toyota (Sebastien Buemi/Brendon Hartley/Ryo Hirakawa) to avenge their own defeat from last year, but Hartley’s tangle with Alessandro Pier Guidi – coming off a slow pit stop that already cost them precious time – brought those hopes to a frustrating end.\n\nThey finished fifth overall, relegated to a supporting role in the final two hours after being Toyota’s main challenger for the win.\n\nBowing out as Le Mans champions were the trio of Alessandro Pier Guidi, James Calado, and Antonio Giovinazzi, who finished third in the #51 Ferrari.\n\nSome decisions, such as the #51 car taking new slick tyres during a Saturday night rain shower, or Pier Guidi’s clash at Mulsanne Corner with Hartley, hurt their chances at a repeat victory.\n\nIt wasn’t their day, but they still made part of another happy Le Mans memory for Ferrari – their two factory cars finished on the podium. And the #51 held on by the skin of its teeth to claim third place over a competitive #6 Porsche Penske Motorsport 963 (Kevin Estre/Andre Lotterer/Laurens Vanthoor).\n\nWhat to make of Porsche in year two of the 963? Well, it wasn’t number 20, it wasn’t Roger Penske’s first Le Mans win in his incredible lifetime as a racing architect.\n\nBut after the humiliation of the 963’s first foray, having two works cars in the top six, and two more customer cars in the top nine, is still a marked improvement.\n\nVanthoor was the iron man of the race, driving for nearly 12 hours and lightening the burden of the legendary Lotterer and the electric Estre. And with double points on offer, the trio still leaves Le Mans with a solid consolation prize – the lead of the WEC World Hypercar Drivers’ Championship.\n\nThe #5 Penske Porsche (Matt Campbell/Michael Christensen/Frédéric Makowiecki) had a strong run of its own in sixth.\n\nAnd how about the super privateers at Hertz Team JOTA? Eighth and ninth, bringing up the rear of the record nine cars that finished on the overall lead lap – before today, no more than two cars had finished on the lead lap at Le Mans!\n\nEighth was a solid reward for the crew of engineers, mechanics, and drivers for the #12 Porsche (Will Stevens/Norman Nato/Callum Ilott), who constructed a backup car from a spare tub, and then took it to the nearby airfield for a shakedown test, within 48 hours of Ilott having an uncharacteristic crash in night practice on Wednesday.\n\nIt was also good to see the #38 JOTA Porsche (Oliver Rasmussen/Philip Hanson/Jenson Button) finish ninth, a performance that breaks the crew out of its early-season malaise.\n\nIt’s just a shame that good fortune never smiled on the #99 Proton Competition Porsche (Neel Jani/Harry Tincknell/Julien Andlauer), which was plagued with a variety of issues and ended up as the last classified finisher in 16th.\n\nOr even the #4 Penske Porsche (Mathieu Jaminet/Felipe Nasr/Nick Tandy), a car that had all the potential on paper to impress, yet rarely featured at the front before Nasr crashed at Indianapolis, bringing a premature end to their race.\n\nThe “Blue Deuce”, the #2 Cadillac Racing V-Series.R (Earl Bamber/Alex Lynn/Alex Palou) run by Chip Ganassi Racing, finished seventh and led at times through diverging strategies. And until late on, it looked like a strong contender for the podium, only to fall away late.\n\nSeventh wasn’t the third-place run of last year, but it is still a great turn-around for Bamber and Lynn after a frustrating first three WEC races, and Palou smashed it in his first effort at Le Mans.\n\nAnd it says a lot that there’s a sense of disappointment that a car “only” finished seventh after being nowhere in the early stages.\n\nThey also saved face for GM’s luxury marque. The #311 Whelen Cadillac Racing car did have another costly accident, but this time ace driver Pipo Derani was in the crossfire after spinning off into the barriers at Indianapolis.\n\nThe Action Express Racing-led car was still able to finish, unlike the second Chip Ganassi Racing car, the yellow #3 Cadillac – which had a terminal rupture in the oil tank.\n\nCadillac’s impending split from Ganassi is more of a sign of frustration that the two powerhouses haven’t made it work. There’s still potential here with the loud and proud V8-powered V-Series.R, and we’ll soon know who will operate Cadillac’s future Hypercar endeavours along with IMSA incumbents Action Express.\n\nAt the very edge of the top ten and World Endurance Championship points positions, the #63 Iron Lynx Lamborghini SC63 (Mirko Bortolotti/Daniil Kvyat/Edoardo Mortara) made history for the Italian marque in its premier-class debut – by being the first Lamborghini to finish the race in the company’s history.\n\nIt’s a start, at least, for the Lamborghini team that’s had its share of trouble getting the SC63 to the track this year – but the #63 and the #19 did finish the race, which is a decent foundation to build on.\n\n11th and 12th for Peugeot’s new-for-2024 9X8 “Mk. II” can, understandably, be viewed as a disappointment. The redesigned 9X8 was hyped as a magic bullet for the French brand, and it wasn’t this week. They got a generous BoP buff ahead of the event, but some would hardly be able to tell.\n\nMore work is needed but, both the #93 and #94 did make the chequered flag within two laps of the leaders. Far from the near-glory in Qatar, yes, but also far from some of the tougher races since the 9X8 project began – including last year’s Le Mans, which ended in frustration.\n\nAnd, in the first French showdown between Peugeot and Alpine in this era, the Lions won – albeit by default.\n\nFor BMW and Alpine, Le Mans promised signs of careful optimism yet yielded bitter sorrow.\n\nAlpine’s two cars broke down with engine issues before the stroke of midnight, including the #35 that had shown real speed – yet, whose lasting image of the weekend will be the smoke stack billowing out from the rear as it stopped at Arnage.\n\nBMW M Team WRT showed flashes of speed, but Dries Vanthoor was left livid after being pushed around and into the barriers by Robert Kubica in the #83 Ferrari – it destroyed the #15 car.\n\nThe #20 ‘art car’ spent most of the race in the garage with an awful triple-whammy: a broken rear driveshaft, rear floor, and rear brake issues – and this was after a broken rear suspension from a crash.\n\nComing back out to complete the race as an unclassified finisher at least salvaged some pride.\n\nAnd then that leaves only Isotta Fraschini, the sole surviving boutique privateer in Hypercar, post-Glickenhaus, post-Kolles.\n\nA finish would have been as good as a win, and the #11 crew can truly feel like winners after their first Le Mans appearance. The machine itself suffered minimal drama, the driving crew of Jean-Karl Vernay, Antonio Serravalle and Carl Bennett were mostly fault-free, and a 14th-place overall result is a magnificent achievement.\n\nThey achieved in one attempt what Colin Kolles’ various efforts of all colours and shapes hadn’t done in over 15 – to finish the race. And that’s before accounting for the other small teams of yesteryear.\n\nIt wasn’t quite Glickenhaus’ run to the overall podium two years ago, or Jean Rondeau’s unbelievable victory in 1980.\n\nBut given the strength of the field, given all the worries that this project would amount to nothing more than vapourware, and the turbulence of the off-season leading into the car’s race debut? This is a remarkable achievement worthy of respect from anyone who considers themselves an enthusiast of this sport.\n\nLMP2 RECAP | LMGT3 RECAP"
