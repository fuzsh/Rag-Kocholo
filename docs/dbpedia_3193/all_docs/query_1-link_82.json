        "text": "The glorious Ferrari brand that we know and love today started producing sports cars in 1947, however, before that made its name with the Scuderia Ferrari Racing team.\n\nNiki Launda, Michael Schumacher and Kim Räikkönen, some of the most famous names in racing history that have one Ferrari a few of its many Championship titles.\n\nFounded in 1929 Scuderia Ferrari started of racing Alfa Romeos around the circuits before world war 2 until its first car was produced in 1947. The Tipo 125 - a 1.5 Litre engine with only two ever made.\n\nFerraris first ever win was in 1951 with Jose Froilan Gonzalez winning the British Grand Prix. The wins continued over the years with the most recent won by Carlos Sains Jr at the 2022 F1 British Grand Prix. With 243 race wins and 787 podiums I think we see a continued bright future to Ferrari in Formula One that won’t be slowing down any time soon."
