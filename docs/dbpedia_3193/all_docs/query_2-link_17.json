        "text": "For some Formula 1 teams, changing identity has become almost routine.\n\nFour of them have altered their names at least twice within the last decade. That includes two teams who have changed their names for the 2024 F1 season.\n\nAt least F1 fans no longer need worry about mixing up their ‘Alfas’ with their ‘Alphas’, as neither Alfa Romeo nor AlphaTauri will feature on the grid. But exactly what they’ve been replaced with is a unclear – one of them has indicated two different names for its operation, while the other has only revealed a ‘placeholder’ name.\n\nAt the other extreme is the handful of teams which have never changed names. Some of those have retained the same identity for decades and built a heritage of such value that even incoming owners have thought better of changing the name above the door. First among these is obviously Ferrari, the only team to have contested all 74 F1 seasons to date.\n\nSo while four teams have always had the same name, the other six have had 29 different identities between them. Here’s what each of them has been known as through the years.\n\nTimeline: The previous identities of F1’s 10 teams\n\nHover over each line for more information on each team:\n\nNotes:\n\nHonda, Aston Martin, Alfa Romeo, Renault and Lotus previously competed as other teams\n\nForce India attempted to rebrand as Racing Point in mid–2018 but it chassis name was only changed the following year\n\nRed Bull\n\nIdentities: 3\n\nThree-times world champion Jackie Stewart created the Milton Keynes-based team which now competes as Red Bull. It lasted just three years in its original incarnation, during which it scored its first victory, before Ford chose to use it as the team for its performance brand Jaguar.\n\nThis also proved relatively short-lived and by the end of 2005 the team was up for sale. In stepped Red Bull brand co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz who purchased the team and appointed Christian Horner who transformed it into the powerhouse operation it is today.\n\nAdvert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free\n\nMercedes\n\nIdentities: 4\n\nThe same driver who founded the team which became Red Bull was the man to beat in the early seventies for Tyrrell. The team never enjoyed the same sustained success after Stewart’s retirement at the end of 1973, but were still winning races a decade later. By the time Stewart’s team arrived in F1, however, Tyrrell was on its knees, and sold up to Craig Pollock and British American Tobacco which formed an entirely new team after taking over Tyrrell’s entry.\n\nAs tobacco sponsorship was increasingly outlawed, British American Racing was taken over by its engine supplier, Honda, in 2006. But within three years it had sold up, one of several car manufacturers which wound down their F1 operations in the wake of the late-noughties credit crunch.\n\nThe team was only rescued thanks to the quick work of team principal Ross Brawn and others, who led a management buy-out, agreed a new engine supply from Mercedes, and stunned F1 by winning the constructors’ championship the following year and taking Jenson Button to the drivers’ title. Mercedes saw the potential and took over the team, and within four years they were winning titles regularly.\n\nFerrari\n\nIdentities: 1\n\nThe only team to have contested every world championship, though not every round. Ferrari is a unique team, an unbroken link back to that first season, and that shared heritage gives it a special place in F1’s history.\n\nMcLaren\n\nIdentities: 1\n\nAnother one of the handful of teams which have stayed faithful to their original name. McLaren celebrated their 60th anniversary last year but arrived in F1 in 1966. Founder Bruce McLaren died in a crash testing one of their Can-Am cars four years later, since when the team has had a succession of different owners, but no other identity. Other great names which date back to the sixties and earlier – Lotus, Brabham and others – are sadly long gone.\n\nAdvert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free\n\nAston Martin\n\nIdentities: 6\n\nThe team currently known as Aston Martin has gone through more changes of name in less time than any of its competitors. The factory built to house the Jordan F1 team in 1991 was demolished last year as its latest owners scale up its operations in order to compete at the front.\n\nThe operation founded by Eddie Jordan won races in the late nineties but couldn’t keep pace with the rapid rise in spending over the years which followed. By 2005 he had sold up to the first of a succession of owners: Russian investment group Midland (surely the dullest name ever applied to an F1 team) was followed by Dutch sportscar make Spyker, then Indian billionaire Vijay Mallya. Under the latter the team regained its reputation for punching above its weight, especially during the V6 hybrid turbo era, but Mallya’s legal and financial problems eventually forced him to sell up as well.\n\nIt was bought by a consortium led by another billionaire, Lawrence Stroll, father of F1 racer Lance Stroll, who soon joined their driver line-up. The operation was initially rebranded as Racing Point (surely the blandest name every applied to an F1 team) but this was merely a placeholder before Stroll’s plans to buy Aston Martin came to fruition. That done, the F1 team took the car make’s name in 2021, and returned to a green colour scheme not unlike its original one.\n\nAlpine\n\nIdentities: 6\n\nAnother team which has gone through half-a-dozen identities, though over a longer span of time than Aston Martin. This team was originally formed by Formula 2 outfit Toleman, which came close to winning the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix with Ayrton Senna, but hit trouble the following year and sold up to Italian fashion brand Benetton.\n\nThey became race winners in the first year in their new identity, and by the mid-nineties were winning championships with Michael Schumacher. In 2002 Renault took over the now struggling team and reshaped it into championship contenders once more, this time with Fernando Alonso, but quit the sport in disgrace in the late noughties following the Crashgate controversy.\n\nThe team continued to compete under the Renault name as it squabbled with a rival over the rights to use the name ‘Lotus’, which it finally acquired in 2012. But by 2016 Renault was back, and three years ago the manufacturer chose to rebrand its team after its Alpine performance brand.\n\nAdvert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free\n\nWilliams\n\nIdentities: 1\n\nThe team founded by Frank Williams has won more constructors championships than anyone bar Ferrari, so it would have been a travesty to see their name disappear from the grid. Thankfully Dorilton saw the value of keeping the legacy name in place when they purchased Williams in 2020, and though the team now has a more American flavour its identity has been preserved.\n\nRB (AlphaTauri in 2023)\n\nIdentities: 4\n\nPerennial backmarkers Minardi were always regarded with a degree of affection by some fans. They continue to hold a historic day celebrating the team at the Imola circuit, though it hasn’t been seen on an F1 grid for almost two decades.\n\nHaving entered F1 in 1985, Giancarlo Minardi sold up to Australian businessman Paul Stoddart in 2001, but he kept its original name in place. By 2005 he was in need of a buyer too, however, and Red Bull decided it required a second team to develop young talents for its top squad.\n\nMinardi therefore became Toro Rosso – Italian for ‘Red Bull’. Ironically, it won a race before the senior squad did, courtesy of an inspired performance by Sebastian Vettel at a rain-soaked Monza in 2008.\n\nDespite Red Bull remaining in charge, the team has changed names twice since then. In 2020 it became AlphaTauri – Red Bull’s fashion brand – and on the entry last for the 2024 F1 season its name has changed again to ‘RB’. The team has advised RaceFans this is a “placeholder” name and it remains to be seen what it will eventually become. Documents filed by Red Bull indicate it could turn into ‘Racing Bulls’.\n\nAdvert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free\n\nSauber (Alfa Romeo in 2023)\n\nIdentities: 5\n\nPeter Sauber’s team arrived in F1 with Mercedes power in 1993 and was long rumoured to be the future vehicle for a works team by the three-pointed star. That never came to pass, though it has allied with another German car manufacturer and it about to team up with a third.\n\nBMW took over the team in 2006, rebranded it as BMW Sauber and looked on course to mount a title bid when it scored a one-two in the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix. But its championship challenge faded over the second half of the year and during an uncompetitive 2009 season it decided to follow Honda through the door marked ‘exit’. A late snag meant its name remained on the team the following year, which together with an enforced change in engine supplier meant the entry was officially – and bizarrely – dubbed a ‘BMW Sauber Ferrari’.\n\nAlfa Romeo took over the naming rights from 2019 until last year. In 2026 another car manufacturer, Audi, will arrive, though like BMW they will also supply the engines. Until then the team has revealed its chassis name will be ‘Kick Sauber’ and it will be officially entered as ‘Stake F1 Team’ in deference to a sponsor. It will continue to be operated by the Sauber Group, so many may simply prefer to refer to it as ‘Sauber’.\n\nHaas\n\nIdentities: 1\n\nThe fourth team to have kept the same name since it entered the sport only arrived in 2016. But as three of Haas‘ rivals have changed names twice in that short space of time, that is nothing to be sniffed at.\n\nAdvert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free\n\nFormula 1\n\nThe last four races showed Verstappen is beatable.
