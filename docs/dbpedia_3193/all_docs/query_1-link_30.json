        "text": "1898\n\nEnzo Anselmo Ferrari was born on the outskirts of Modena on the 18th of February 1898. However, his birth wasn't registered until two days later because of heavy snow. Enzo's father owned a small metal engineering company that employed around 30 people and built bridges and roofs for the state railways.\n\n1908\n\nTen year old Enzo and his brother Alfredo were brought by their father to watch a race at the motor racing circuit on Via Emilia in Bologna. The race was won by Felice Nazzaro (Vincenzo Lancia took the race fastest lap). Young Enzo was completely entranced by the action.\n\n1916\n\nThe Ferrari family was hit by a double tragedy in 1916 as both Enzoâs father and brother passed away. Enzo was forced to give up his studies after his fatherâs death and found work as an instructor in the lathing school at the fire service workshop in Modena.\n\n1917\n\nEnzo served in the Italian army during the First World War and was assigned to the 3rd Alpine Artillery Division. However, he became seriously ill and underwent two operations before being honorably discharged.\n\n1918\n\nOnce he regained his health, Ferrari attempted to get a job with Fiat in Turin but to no avail. At the end of 1918, he found work as a test-driver at a small company in Turin that built the much-sought after Torpedos which were built on a light truck chassis.\n\n1919\n\nEnzo moved to Milan to work for C.M.N (Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali), first as a test-driver and then later as a racing driver. He made his competitive debut in the 1919 Parma-Poggio di Berceto hill climb race which he finished fourth in the three-litre category at the wheel of a 2.3-litre 4-cylinder CMN 15/20. On November 23rd of the same year, he took part in the Targa Florio but lost over 40 minutes after his car's fuel tank developed a leak.\n\n1920\n\nIn 1920, after a series of races in which he enjoyed mixed fortunes at the wheel of an Isotta Fraschini 100/110 IM Corsa, Enzo finished second in the Targa Florio in a 6-litre 4-cylinder Alfa Romeo Tipo 40/60. This marked the start of 20-year collaboration with the marquee that would see Ferrari do everything from test-driving to racing to dealing before being appointed head of the Alfa Corse racing division, a position he holds until September 1939.\n\n1921\n\nFerrari competed in several races as an official Alfa driver, delivering some impressive finishes such as fifth position in the Targa Florio in May and a second at Mugello in July. He also had his first major accident in September that year when he went off the road on the eve of the Brescia Grand Prix trying to avoid a herd of cattle blocking the race route.\n\n1923\n\nFerrari won the first Circuito del Savio and met Count Baracca, father of the famous Italian First World War pilot Francesco Baracca. He later met Countess Baracca who gave him a signed photograph and invited him to use her sonâs Prancing Horse emblem as a mascot on his cars.\n\n1924\n\nIn 1924 Enzo Ferrari was made a Cavaliere (Knight) for his sporting achievements, his first official honour from the Italian state. He was made a cavaliere Ufficiale in 1925. His passion for journalism sees him become one of the founders of the famous Corriere dello Sport newspaper in Bologna that same year too.\n\n1927\n\nFerrari was made Commendatore by the Italian state in recognition of his services to the Nation in the area of racing. On June 5th of the same year, he won the first Circuito di Modena in an Alfa Romeo 6C-1500 SS.\n\n1928\n\nOn May 20th Enzo won the 2nd Circuito di Modena, once again at the wheel of an Alfa Romeo 6C-1500 SS.\n\n1929\n\nIn 1929 Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari in Modena. The main aim of this racing \"stable\" was to allow owner-drivers to race. Its foundation marked the start of a burst of frenetic sporting activity that would lead to the creation of an official team. The Scuderia fielded both cars (mainly Alfas) and motorbikes. In time it became a technical racing outpost of Alfa Romeo and effectively took over as its racing department in 1933.\n\n1931\n\nEnzo Ferrari completed his final race as a driver at the Circuito Tre Province on August 9th 1931. He finishes second to Nuvolari in an Alfa Romeo 8C-2300 MM. The decision to quit racing came as result of the impending birth of his son Alfredo, better known as Dino (19th January 1932), and his growing workload as head of the Scuderia.\n\n1937\n\nThe Scuderia Ferrari built the Alfa Romeo 158 \"Alfetta\" which went on to dominate the international racing scene.\n\n1938\n\nThe Scuderia Ferrari was wound up at the end of 1937 and at the beginning of 1938 Enzo Ferrari took up his new position as head of Alfa Course and moved to Milan.\n\n1939\n\nOn September 6th 1939, Enzo Ferrari left Alfa Romeo under the proviso that he doesn not use Ferrari name in association with races or racing cars for at least four years. From that moment on, beating Alfa Romeo in one of his own cars became a passion. On September 13th Ferrari opened Auto Avio Costruzioni on Viale Trento Trieste in Modena, the headquarters of the old Scuderia Ferrari.\n\n1940\n\nAuto Avio Costruzioni built two versions of what Ferrari calls the 815 (8 cylinders, 1500 cc) on a Flat platform for the last pre-War Mille Miglia. They are driven by a young Alberto Ascari and Marquis Lotario Rangoni Machiavelli of Modena but fail to shine.\n\n1943\n\nAt the very height of the War in 1943, Auto Avio Costruzioni moved out of Modena to Maranello where the first part of what would later become the Ferrari factory was built. In Modena, the company had worked for the National Aeronautical Company of Rome, Piaggio and RIV, but in Maranello the focus is mostly on fabricating grinding machines which were copies of original German tooling machines.\n\n1944\n\nThe factory was first bombed on November 4th 1944 and then hit again the following February but was quickly rebuilt.\n\n1945\n\nFerrari begins work on designing the first Ferrari in late 1945. His ambitious plan is to power it with a V12 engine. In fact, this particular architecture became a fixture throughout the companyâs entire history. The reason Ferrari chose a V12 was it versatility: it was just as suited to use on sports prototypes as single-seaters and even Grand Tourers.\n\n1946\n\nIn December Ferrari releases specifications and drawings of his new car to the press.\n\n1947\n\nOn March 12th, he takes the car, now known as the 125 S, out for its first test-drive on the open road.\n\n1952\n\nHaving won its first Mille Miglia in 1948, its first Le Mans 24 Hour Race in 1949 and its first Formula 1 World Championship Grand Prix in 1951, Ferrari becomes world Champions for first time in 1952 thanks to Alberto Ascari who repeated his feat the following year. In 1952, Ferrari was made a Cavaliere del Lavoro in recognition of his services to industry and to enhancing Italy's international reputation.\n\n1956\n\nEnzo's beloved son, Alfredo, or Dino as he was better known, dies of muscular dystrophy. Ferrari had kept his son involved in the design of a new 1500 cc V6 until the very end of his life. The engine finally debuts 10 months after Dinoâs death. However, it and all Ferrari V6 engines are named in his honour.\n\n1960\n\nFerrari became a Limited Liability Company and Enzo was conferred with an Honorary Degree in Mechanical Engineering by Bologna University.\n\n1962\n\nEnzo Ferrari was presented with the Hammarskijld Prize by the United Nations.\n\n1963\n\n1963 sees Enzo Ferrari build the professional industry and artisanship training institute in Maranello. Dedicated to Alfredo \"Dino\" Ferrari, it continues to provide the company with special technicians to this day.\n\n1965\n\nEnzo Ferrari won the Columbus Prize.\n\n1969\n\nFerrari became aware that he required a powerful partner if the company was to continue to develop and so signed an agreement with the Fiat Group giving it a 50% stake in the company shares.\n\n1970\n\nEnzo Ferrari was presented with a Gold Medal for Culture and Art by the President of Italy.\n\n1971\n\nEnzo Ferrari decided to build the Fiorano Circuit which would be officially opened on April 8th 1972.\n\n1979\n\nFerrari received the honorary title of Cavaliere dig ran Croce dello Repubblica Italiana from Pertini.\n\n1987\n\nThe F40, the last car to be created under Enzo Ferrariâs management, was unveiled.\n\n1988\n\nThe University of Modena confers Ferrari with an Honorary Degree in Physics. Enzo Ferrari passes away at the age of 90 on August 14th."
