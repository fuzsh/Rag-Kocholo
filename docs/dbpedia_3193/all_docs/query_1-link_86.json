        "text": "Who are the current owners of Ferrari?\n\nLuxury Italian car manufacturer Ferrari owns the Formula 1 team Scuderia Ferrari.\n\nFerrari is co-owned by Dutch holding company Exor, which is majority-owned by the billionaire Agnelli family, and Piero Ferrari.\n\nThe Italian entrepreneur Enzo Ferrari died in 1988, having founded the car brand in 1939 after leaving Alfa Romeo. Enzo Ferrari’s son Piero inherited a 10 per cent stake.\n\nInvestors hold 67 per cent of shares in Ferrari through its stock exchange listings in New York and Milan.\n\nShareholders include American investment firms BlackRock and T .Rowe Price Associates.\n\nFiat once held a major stake in Ferrari before separation in 2016. But the family of Italian businessman Giovanni Agnelli, who founded Fiat, controls Exor.\n\nWhat is the breakdown of ownership?\n\nWho is the team principal of Ferrari?\n\nFrederic Vasseur is the team principal of Ferrari.\n\nHe joined Ferrari from Alfa Romeo in time for the 2023 season, replacing Mattia Binotto.\n\nBinotto had acted as team principal for three years prior to leaving.\n\nVasseur is a French engineer who has been credited with recruiting British driver Lewis Hamilton for the 2024 season.\n\nWho are Ferrari’s manufacturers?\n\nRed Bull’s headquarters are in Maranello in Italy.\n\nThe team said its car for the 2024 season is vastly different to its last.\n\nIts manufacturing and power unit is produced in-house.\n\nWhat is Ferrari’s value?\n\nFerrari are worth $3.9bn, according to Forbes.\n\nTheir estimated revenue for 2023 was $680m.\n\nWhen was Ferrari formed?\n\nScuderia Ferrari entered F1 in 1950, the first year of the reformed F1 championship.\n\nIt has kept its place in F1 ever since, overcoming historic ownership struggles with Ford in the ‘60s, issues with sponsors and threats to leave the competition.\n\nIt is the only team to have competed in every season of F1.\n\nWhat is Ferrari’s record in F1?\n\nScuderia Ferrari are Formula 1’s most successful team, winning 16 constructor championships and 15 driver titles.\n\nF1 team Williams are a distant second with nine constructor championships.\n\nAmong some of Ferrari’s greatest drivers include legends Alberto Ascari, Niki Lauda and Michael Schumacher.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2002, it won both the drivers’ and constructors’ titles three years in a row.\n\nIt snapped up seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton in a shock move ahead of the 2024 season.\n\nFerrari’s last drivers’ title win was in 2007 with Kimi Raikkonen.\n\nIts last constructors championship came in 2008 when Brazilian driver Felipe Massa narrowly lost to Hamilton."
