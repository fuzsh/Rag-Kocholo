        "text": "Early career and formation of the Scuderia Ferrari\n\nEnzo Ferrari was a test driver for a small automobile company in Milan after World War I. In 1920 he began driving for the Alfa Romeo company, and in 1929 in Modena he founded a racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, that prepared Alfa Romeo race cars. (Scuderia means “stable”—in the sense of a place for horses—in Italian.) Its drivers and cars were soon winning championships, though Ferrari, who was just one of the Scuderia’s many drivers, called an end to his racing career after 1931. He had married Laura Garello in 1923, and the couple had their first, and only, child in 1932: Alfredo. Like Enzo’s father and brother, who both died in 1916 and for whom he was named, he was known as Dino. Ferrari, it seemed, was ready to become a family man running a successful business.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nIndianapolis 500 Quiz\n\nFerrari continued operating the Scuderia alongside Alfa Romeo’s own, increasingly mediocre racing program until 1933, when the two companies began negotiations that put Ferrari wholly in charge of Alfa’s racing efforts.\n\nSplit with Alfa Romeo and first Grand Prix victory\n\nAlthough (or, perhaps, because) Scuderia Ferrari proved successful in the mid-1930s, the relationship between Ferrari and Alfa Romeo’s leadership became fractious. In 1937 Alfa bought out most of Scuderia Ferrari, wanting to bring its racing efforts under its own roof, but the company retained Ferrari as an adviser. In 1939, however, they parted ways; a public announcement from Alfa claimed a “mutual agreement,” though Ferrari later claimed that he had been kicked out.\n\nFlush with money, he created Auto Avio Costruzioni (AAC)—what would eventually become Ferrari SpA. (An agreement with Alfa Romeo prevented Ferrari from using his own name or rebuilding the Scuderia for several years.) AAC built and repaired cars while also supplying the Italian military during World War II. AAC’s first car was the Tipo 815, developed over just a few months to compete in the 1940 Mille Miglia and based largely on another carmaker’s components. Two 815s started the race, but mechanical failures meant that neither finished.\n\nIn 1942 Ferrari began the process of moving his company from Modena to nearby Maranello, anticipating that Allied forces would attack Modena during an offensive on the Italian peninsula. (The Allies did just that, though they also bombed his new factory twice.) Maranello became the company’s corporate headquarters as well as the place where its cars were, and still are, manufactured. The first car to be designed and built entirely by his company under the Ferrari name—the 125 S—was not ready until 1947. It had a V-12 engine, which would become a signature feature of Ferrari’s cars, and it secured Ferrari’s first Grand Prix victory, in Rome in May 1947.\n\nTriumph and crisis in the 1950s\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The company was racing under the Scuderia Ferrari name in Formula One (F1), motorsport’s highest level, in 1950, when the F1 world drivers’ championship began. Ferrari’s sports cars won numerous championships in the 1950s, often dominating the competition.\n\nThe 1950s were, however, a dangerous era in motorsport, and a number of Ferrari’s drivers were killed in quick succession: Alberto Ascari in a Ferrari sports car in 1955, Eugenio Castellotti, Luigi Musso, and Peter Collins in Ferrari F1 cars in 1957−58, and Alfonso de Portago in a Ferrari sports car during the 1957 Mille Miglia. The Mille Miglia tragedy—Portago’s crash killed his navigator and at least nine spectators, and it injured many more—convinced the Italian government to outlaw racing on public roads, which ended what had become Italy’s most famous road race. Ferrari himself was charged with manslaughter after the race. (He was acquitted.) But the final Mille Miglia also brought Ferrari the glory that he craved: Piero Taruffi drove a 315 S to victory after Ferrari had convinced him to race, even though Taruffi was close to retirement at age 50.\n\nWhat is the Mille Miglia?\n\nThe Mille Miglia was an endurance race on public roads between Brescia and Rome in Italy. It was about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) in distance, and it was held 24 times between 1927 and 1957 before being outlawed as too dangerous.\n\nAmid this carnage, the Italian press cast Ferrari as Saturn devouring his sons. It was a cruel turn, given that Dino Ferrari had died in 1956 at age 24 as a result of muscular dystrophy. He had been working at his father’s company—he designed the 750 Monza, among other projects—and he was being positioned as his father’s eventual successor. His parents were devastated. Their marriage was already under pressure because of Enzo Ferrari’s affairs—one of which, with Lina Lardi, had produced a son, Piero, in 1945—and it fractured even more after 1956, though Laura Ferrari remained closely involved with company oversight.\n\nThe late 1950s were thus a time of crisis for Enzo Ferrari and his company, but he remained focused on his first principle:\n\n“Racing,” he told The Times of London some years ago, “is a great mania to which one must sacrifice everything, without reticence, without hesitation.”\n\nThat observation, from 1962, appeared in The New York Times’s obituary of Ferrari, and its resurrection in 1988 reflected the aura that had gathered around him by the end of his life. By that time, Ferrari the company had become a global luxury carmaker buoyed by a strong sporting heritage, and Ferrari the man had shaded into the legend of “the Old Man,” as he was called during his final years. Some around him grumbled that all of this was “that old Ferrari hokum,” as one English journalist noted in 1986—but, as that journalist recognized, it was exactly this legend, forged in the 1950s and elaborated on for decades, that made Ferrari Ferrari.\n\nThe 1960s and beyond\n\nDuring the 1960s Ferrari oversaw the expansion of his company’s road-car business, and his race teams met with continuing success and tragedy. In Formula One, Scuderia Ferrari won two constructor’s championships, in 1961 and 1964, but two of its drivers, Wolfgang von Trips and Lorenzo Bandini, died while racing, in 1961 and 1967, respectively. Von Trips’s crash also killed 14 spectators, an uncomfortable echo of the Mille Miglia disaster. At Le Mans, Ferrari cars dominated the 24-hour race from 1960 through 1965 with accomplished drivers such as Phil Hill, and it also won several sports-car championships. Ferrari’s memoir, Le mie gioie terribili (My Terrible Joys), was published in 1962.\n\nIn 1969 Ferrari, who had become largely indistinguishable from his company, sold a 50 percent share of his company to Fiat SpA, which expanded its ownership to 90 percent in 1988. He remained president of Ferrari until 1977 and retained control over Scuderia Ferrari until his death in 1988, at age 90. Ferrari’s F1 team resumed winning in the 1970s—it won six constructor’s championships from 1975 through 1983—but then fell into a slump not broken until 1999.\n\nFerrari’s wife died in 1978, and he acknowledged his son Piero soon afterward. Piero, who had been working at Ferrari under his mother’s surname since the 1960s, was named his father’s heir in Ferrari’s will. The owner of 10 percent of the company, he adopted the Ferrari name and later became the company’s vice-chairman.\n\nA number of movies have depicted Enzo Ferrari: he is the center of Michael Mann’s Ferrari (2023) and the disdainful antagonist of Ford v Ferrari (2019), among others."
