        "text": "The car industry is not big on the cult of personality. Except when it comes to Enzo Ferrari. As exacting as Steve Jobs, as implacable as Napoleon Bonaparte and more instinctively manipulative than Machiavelli, his story is operatic, Shakespearean, laced with Greek tragedy and yet not without its humorous moments. There is love, death (a lot of death, actually), ambition, motor racing, lifelong loyalty, betrayal, innovation, blood, sweat and tears (some of which may even have been real).\n\nIn the Ferrari Museum in Modena, Italy, the city of his birth, there's a rotating display of the many wonderful cars that bore his name, examples of the (mostly) glorious engines that powered them and technical drawings explaining their conception. But the devil is in the detail and one of this charming devil's most famous details sits in a transparent display case: a pair of black sunglasses. It was a style thing, yes, but also a useful affectation: who knew what was going on in The Old Man's eyes?\n\nMore books have been written about Enzo Ferrari than any other Italian industrialist (except perhaps Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat heir and kingpin who would take control of his family's company in 1966 and then buy Ferrari three years later). He was born in February 1898, the second son of Adalgisa and Alfredo, who ran a small foundry business that supplied the Italian national railway. Enzo watched his first motor race on 6 September 1908. The death of his father in 1916 and then his brother, Dino, later that same year from an illness contracted while fighting as part of the ground crew in the Italian Air Force was a twin tragedy that profoundly affected him.\n\nEnzo scratched out a meagre living to begin with, harbouring dreams of becoming an opera singer, a sports journalist or a racing driver. Eventually, his life would encompass elements of all three.\n\nIn fact, he raced with some success in the Twenties with Alfa Romeo, then a serious force in the rapidly evolving motor scene. Though talented, he preferred running the team to driving for it and in 1929, led the first iteration of Alfa Romeo's racing division, Scuderia Ferrari, which counted the likes of Tazio Nuvolari among its driver line-up. (Enzo would reference the so-called \"Flying Mantuan\" as his favourite driver ever after.)\n\nIt was in this period that Enzo adopted the Cavallino Rampante (Prancing Horse) as his company's symbol. Not everyone agrees, but it's generally thought to have been gifted to him by the parents of the late Italian fighter pilot Francesco Baracca (from the squadron Enzo's brother had been part of), to which he added the bright-yellow background after the city of Modena.\n\nGrand Prix racing in the Thirties pitched plucky Alfa against the technological might of the German teams Auto Union and Mercedes. Scuderia Ferrari was eventually dissolved in 1937. Enzo remained on board for a time, but then fell out with Alfa's boss. Forbidden from reigniting the Scuderia, he set up instead as Auto Avio Costruzioni and it was under the AAC banner that his first cars appeared in 1940, while his nascent company was coerced into munitions manufacture for Mussolini. Ferrari as we know it now was inaugurated in March 1947; Franco Cortese won the first race at Caracalla near Rome on 25 May that year and so it began...\n\nFerrari is almost the same age as the modern Formula One championship (which kicked off in 1950), and his upstart company rapidly became synonymous with it. Indeed, Ferrari is the only team to have contested almost every F1 race since (controversial interludes notwithstanding). The first win for the renewed Scuderia came at Silverstone in 1951. The victory was scored by the burly Argentinian José Froilán González in a Ferrari 375. In beating Alfa Romeo, Enzo opined that he had \"killed my mother\".\n\nHe was a spin doctor before the term existed and became famous for his quasi-philosophical proclamations - \"I am an agitator of men\" being the best known, along with \"My favourite Ferrari? The one that has yet to be built\", but see also \"I give my collaborators complete trust. That is the only way to see if they deserve it.\"\n\nIn parallel, Enzo realised that manufacturing road cars was an expedient way of financing his increasingly costly racing activities. Despite this fiscally pragmatic attitude, the company would go on to produce many of the most extravagant cars in automotive history.\n\nAs well as being a natural PR man, Enzo was also a born salesman. \"If you like this car, we'll make it. If you don't, we won't,\" he would tell a prospective customer. If they happened to be female, the patter would be even more flamboyant. When it came to women, Enzo was a positive gourmand.\n\nOne of his closest associates, Luigi Chinetti - who in 1949 won the first of Ferrari's nine victories in the Le Mans 24 Hours endurance race - would also be the man who turned Enzo on to the potential of the North American market. Ferrari opened a dealership on West 55th Street in Manhattan, New York, in April 1954 and before long Hollywood's finest were in thrall to the Italian newcomer. James Coburn, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood, Miles Davis and many more soon succumbed to its powerful allure.\n\nRacing is a great mania to which one must sacrifice everything without hesitation\n\nIn Europe, meanwhile, the brand quickly embodied the new Riviera chic: film director Roberto Rossellini commissioned a one-off for his wife, Ingrid Bergman, and Roger Vadim wooed any number of starlets in his 250 California Spider, including Brigitte Bardot and Jane Fonda circa Barbarella. With old royalty buying his cars and the new playboy elite (typified by Gianni Agnelli, Gunter Sachs and racing driver Porfirio Rubirosa) all committed fans, Enzo was very happy to indulge them.\n\nRacing, however, was what really mattered. \"[It] is a great mania to which one must sacrifice everything, without reticence, without hesitation,\" he said. It was also the source of what he himself referred to as his \"terrible joys\" (also the title of his memoir). During his imperial phase, many of his drivers were killed, Peter Collins, Eugenio Castellotti, Count Wolfgang von Trips, Luigi Musso and Lorenzo Bandini among them. During the 1957 Mille Miglia road race, the Marquis Alfonso de Portago, who was also a bobsleigh champion, lost control of his Ferrari 335S when a tyre blew, killing himself, his co-driver and nine spectators. The Vatican's official newspaper, Osservatore Romana, denounced Ferrari as a latter-day Saturn, happy to sacrifice his sons in the service of competitive victory. He also faced charges of manslaughter. Rumours that he favoured one driver over another, or that he was apt to set his engineers and lieutenants against each other to keep everyone on their toes, were rife. His spokesman, Franco Gozzi, loved to cultivate the mystique.\n\nHe was absolutely focused on success – but in the end, he was Italian and he had a heart\n\nEnzo had married young, to Laura Garello, but they were estranged following one of the other defining moments of his emotionally turbocharged life: the death in 1956 of his beloved son Dino from muscular dystrophy, aged just 24. \"When a man tells a woman he loves her,\" he observed, \"he only means that he desires her. The only total love in this world is that of a father for his son.\" Enzo had maintained another family, with his mistress, Lina Lardi, and their son, Piero, who was born in 1945. Only after Laura's death in 1978 was Piero allowed to take his father's name. He owns ten per cent of the company and is still heavily involved. When Ferrari was publicly quoted in 2015, Piero became a billionaire.\n\n\"Ferrari's only interest was winning. He really didn't care about the drivers,\" Niki Lauda, a double Formula One world champion for Ferrari, told me. \"He liked [Gilles] Villeneuve because he was crazy, and he liked me because I told him the truth. He was friendly with me, he accepted me. I would simply knock on his door. Looking back, after all the fights I had with him after my accident [Lauda was almost killed during the 1976 German Grand Prix], he was a very egocentric man, absolutely focused on his cars, on his ideas, being successful in a brutal way. But in the end, he was Italian and he had a heart. I had the opportunity to experience this on the odd occasion, but the rest of the time it was not funny.\n\n\"Daniele Audetto [then team manager] visited me in hospital after my accident then went back to the paddock, went up to Emerson Fittipaldi and said, 'Lauda is dead, we want to offer you a two-year contract.' This was an order from Enzo himself. \"In terms of charisma and personality, none of today's Formula One managers can compare with Enzo. Think how long he has been dead and we're still talking about him.\"\n\nThe end came on 14 August 1988. Two months earlier, he'd been too frail to meet Pope John Paul II in person during a Papal visit to Maranello - the Vatican had evidently forgiven him - but the pontiff agreed to speak with him on the telephone. A month after Enzo's death, Scuderia Ferrari scored a one-two win in the Italian GP at Monza. It was the only race that their arch rivals McLaren didn't win that year.\n\nFormer Ferrari F1 team principal (1977-1988) Marco Piccinini was one of just a handful of people who attended Enzo's funeral ceremony. \"His dream always was to become Ferrari - the team, the factory, the cars,\" Piccinini told me in 2015. \"And he did become that. But in private, he was humble. He didn't take himself overly seriously and could see the humour in the situation. What he did take very seriously was the factory, the work and the people who worked for him. Enzo Ferrari didn't need to play up to a perception. You don't need to pose like Ferrari when you are Ferrari.\"\n\nLike this?
