        "text": "This is how I know the story - if people have corrections please don't hold back!\n\nFerrari, the company, was founded for only 1 reason: to race, and to win. At the same time, Ferrari realised that success on the race track would enable him to sell cars based on his racers for a premium, and that he could use the profits of that to fund his racing.\n\nBy the early 1960's, racing had become a lot more expensive due to increased levels of professionalism, but also because Ferrari was racing so many different classes. To keep reigning supreme, Ferrari needed more money, which is why the Ford deal came close to reality in 1963. However, Ford wanted to take control of the Ferrari road cars away from Enzo, and he did not like the idea of having cars bearing his name that he could not have the ultimate say over. Apparently he found this out quite late in the process, but it was enough for him to cancel the deal. Henry Ford wasn't amused and that is how the GT40 programme was born to defeat Ferrari at LeMans (where it hurt: in racing).\n\nStill needing funding, Enzo started looking around in Italy and found a partner in Agnelli, chairman of FIAT. FIAT bought a minority stake in 1965, I think 20%. Four years later, Enzo sold the majority in his company to FIAT but under the strict rule that he would be in full control of the company. This always remained the case. I do not believe that any Ferrari model was ever produced in his lifetime that Enzo did not approve of. He was far too much a cantankerous character to allow that. But FIAT certainly influenced him, and I believe the Dino programme was the result of FIAT's pressure to produce more volume Ferrari's. By producing them under his son's name rather than the name that was legend in racing, he created a link to the race cars but at the same time Ferrari owners could still distance themselves from the cheaper models and the status quo for the Ferrari name remained.\n\nOnno\n\nThis is not correct. Enzo Ferrari realized quite early that he needed higher production numbers to fund his racing program. As early as the late fifties. I wrote an article about the Fiat Dinos a few years back. Here's the part about Enzo setting up a street car production line:\n\nThinking ahead\n\nEnzo Ferrari is often described as somewhat conservative, especially when it came down to introducing new technologies like disk brakes and putting the engine in the rear. But theres no question about his strong business sense. It seems that Ferrari was well aware that in order to keep his company alive and to keep racing, he also had to sell cars. Indeed very early on in his career as race car maker, he sold his obsolete race cars to wealthy customers. And although many quote him saying that building and selling street cars was a necessary evil to keep racing, he was clever enough to understand the vital importance of this.\n\nEnzos company SEFAC (Societa Esercizio Fabbriche Automobili e Corse) was totally geared to making race cars, as the name implies. The road car production line was secondary to this and it showed in the production numbers. Ferrari was a very small company. Only when Pinin Farina entered the frame production figures started to go up, but still nothing like those of other makes like Alfa Romeo and Fiat.\n\nIt seems that Enzo Ferrari recognized this. He saw what happened around him in the automobile industry, especially in Italy. After the war the mobility of the masses came into full swing, most notably with companies like Fiat and their little 500s. He was also very impressed by the British Mini that was introduced in 1959. It didnt take long before Ferrari came up with his own plans for a small displacement car that would be relatively mass produced.\n\nBrand awareness\n\nIt seems that Ferrari was fully aware of the possible bad reflections that a mass produced, small displacement car could have on his core business. Even though Ferrari had built all kinds of engines and with all sorts of displacements, the cornerstone of his brand by the late fifties/early sixties was the big three liter V12. But as said he was no stranger to small displacement engines. His very first car, the 125, was only 1.5 liters, albeit a V12 (imagine the size of one cylinder, its tiny!) And his very first championship winning monoposto was the 500 F2, with an inline four engine.\n\nNevertheless Ferrari began to unfold his plans for a small Ferrari in great secrecy so as to avoid any clear links to SEFAC.\n\nNot a great start\n\nFerraris first study in 1959 was later nicknamed La Ferrarina. It was officially called the Tipo 854 and was built on a chassis borrowed from the Fiat Coupe 1100. The body was designed by Pinin Farina and it looked like a small version of the Ferrari 250 GT coupe, also penned by Pinin Farina. The engine displacement started with 850cc but by 1960 it had grown into a little over 1000cc.\n\nEven though the Ferrarina was Enzos idea he didnt want to produce it himself. Mainly because his company wasnt equipped for mass production but also, as said before, because he wanted to avoid any links with his own big V12 engined creations.\n\nHowever it took an unexpected long time to find a company who would buy the license to build the Ferrarina.\n\nThe first real attempt for serious production came with the ASA 1000 with a pretty body designed by Bertone. As the name implies it had a 1.000cc engine and ASA stood for Autocostruzioni Societa per Azioni. This company was founded by Oronzio de Nora, a wealthy oil and chemicals industrialist. His son Nicolo ran the car business. Enzo Ferrari relied on Nicolo de Nora but it gradually became apparent that de Nora had no experience in the car industry. Two years after the first introduction of the ASA 1000 there still wasnt anything like a series production going on. De Nora was still looking for a company to build the bodies. He finally got a deal with Ellena, who built somewhere between 100 and 120 ASA 1000s between 1964 and 1966.\n\nDue to circumstances outside Enzo Ferraris powers, the ASA company shut its doors in 1967. The idea behind the project was healthy but bad management ruined any chances of a prolonged success.\n\nThird time lucky\n\nThe second attempt didnt work out either. It was the Innocenti 186 GT, of which only a few prototypes were built between 1962 and 1964 (so in the same period when the ASA was conceived). Again it wasnt Ferraris fault that mass production didnt materialize. Innocenti had a contract with British Leyland to built and sell Minis under license in Italy. BL didnt want an in-house competitor so the project died before it even started.\n\nBut in 1965 Ferrari finally got his break when Fiat stepped into the frame. Fiat too was aware of the Innocenti situation and also didnt want a competitor on the Italian market, where they already had to deal with Alfa Romeo. So what better way than to join forces with Ferrari and pull the idea of a small but powerful car into their portfolio.\n\nFor Ferrari this was the big break. Not only had he a formidable partner in giant Fiat to realise the mass production, it also meant he would be able to homologate the Dino engine for the new regulations in the F2 race category, that would go into effect in 1967. Ferrari would have his engine ready well ahead of the competition.\n\nGetting Fiat onboard also meant that the design stage went full steam and indeed the Fiat Dino spider by Pininfarina was presented to the world at the Turin show in 1966.\n\nYour comment doesn't make sense Marnix, unless you meant to type \"would NOT remain in charge of the competition department\".\n\nI think it is a big mistake to think Enzo wasn't really interested in the road cars. It is a popular, regularly bandied notion, but I think it is an exaggeration. The only way that the road cars would supply enough funding was for them to be one the best cars available on the market. I am sure he maintained a careful watch on the cars personally to ensure that would happen. Countless are also the stories of him dealing directly with his road car customers (IF you were important enough). I think racing was his first love and focus but that doesn't mean that the road cars didn't mean anything to him. I believe anything that bore his name was very important to him.\n\nAs for the Ford deal - you may be right, I do not know exactly. What I do remember is that the story is that he was forced to give up something he wasn't expecting and cut the deal. However, the theory that it was all just a ruse to get into bed with FIAT, as suggested by Chris, also seems quite plausible.\n\nOnno\n\nMore or less, but I meant to paint the picture of mr Ferrari walking into the conferenceroom saying to the lawyers that mr Ford send ahead the he wants to remain in charge of the competitiond department and that this would be a dealbreaker for him. Anyway, the deal didn't go through when Ford couldn't and wouldn't agree with this demand, where as Fiat could and did.\n\nTrue, but mr Ferrari was, according to the stories, first and foremost a very pragmatic person. Knowing his roadcars were the life line of the Scuderia, it would only make sense that he would do everything in his power to make the roadcar division a succes. That doesn't mean he, as a person, was interested in his roadcars. And I suppose he wasn't. He rarely owned and/or drove them and I think he, being rather lowkey in his manners and focused on the world of racing, couldn't really relate to his clientele of the rich and famous.\n\nHe understood their importance for the continuation of his beloved Scuderia and acted upon it, but that was simply his pragmatic view. Having said that, it is said he was pragmatic towards his racing cars as well. They just needed to get the job done and when they became useless for the factory, they became worthless as well. Telling is his answer on the question of what is his favorite Ferrari: \"The next one\".\n\nBut since I have never got the chance to get to know mr Ferrari first hand, I can never be sure.\n\nIMO Describing cars as Enzo era and post Enzo era is something that with never be clearly defined and is likely to change to suit the write up a dealer is doing on a Daytona, C4 or even 365GT4 2+2 that they have for sale at the time.\n\nThe only clear distinction I can see is that the Daytona was the last car with the old style engine designation (Tipo 251) and the C4 has a new style (F101).\n\nRather more subjectively the C4 feels a more modern car to me than the Daytona. If you want to waste a few minutes of your life you can read a comparision I wrote of my Daytona to my Dad's C4s on the link below\n\nhttp://www.drivecult.com/features/sibling-rivalry-ferrari-365gtb-4-daytona-versus-ferrari-365gtc-4/"
