Have an account? .\n\nFerrari is one of the most valuable brands in the world.\n\nFerrari — the Italian supercar maker and Formula One racing operation — is worth $30 billion.\n\nUnlike many of its rivals, Ferrari is a racing operation first and car company second.\n\nFerrari was founded as a racing team with the sale of road cars as a means to fund the racing operation.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

Now, the company's market cap has risen to $30 billion. This makes the car maker one of the most valuable and recognizable brands in the world; its \"prancing horse\" logo is synonymous with sex, money and the high life.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nFerrari wasn't always the global luxury brand that's now being traded in New York. The company's early days as a maker of racing cars were rather humble, and it took an Italian-American racing star named Luigi Chinetti to begin the transformation into a purveyor of glamorous supercars for the world's well-heeled. The company's success drew takeover interest, and later rivalry, from Ford – before Ferrari eventually became part of FIAT.\n\nRead more: I drove a $474,000 Ferrari 812 Superfast to see if the sports car delivers a thrill worth the price — here's the verdict.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many years, Ferrari artificially limited its annual production figures to preserve the exclusivity of its cars. However, since the IPO in the fall of 2015, the company has steadily increased the number of cars it delivers to customers.\n\nBut even if Ferrari sells 10,000 cars, those cars are still exceedingly rare. In fact, most of the company's models are supply limited in that the number it sells is limited not by how many people want to buy a car but by how many they can make.\n\nHere is the story of Ferrari's incredible seven-decade-plus journey:\n\nAn earlier version of this story was written by Benjamin Zhang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1908, A 10-year-old Enzo Ferrari saw his first car race and immediately became hooked. As a young adult, Enzo was drafted by the Italian army to fight in World War I.\n\nAfter the war, Enzo had a hard time finding work in the auto business. He applied to work at Fiat, but was rejected to due an abundance of unemployed war veterans. Eventually, he found work at smaller automakers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the early 1920s, Enzo landed a job at Alfa Romeo as a race car driver. Fellow drivers at the company included legendary aces like Tazio Nuvolari, seen here in an Alfa.\n\nIn 1929, Enzo launched Scuderia Ferrari or \"Team Ferrari.\" There was no car company yet — Scuderia consisted of a group of drivers who raced the cars they owned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team raced mostly Alfa Romeo cars. By 1933, Scuderia Ferrari had essentially become Alfa's racing division.\n\nIn 1937, Enzo shut down Scuderia Ferrari and became the head of Alfa Romeo's factory racing operation — Alfa Corse. But that wouldn't last. He wasn't happy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week after leaving Alfa Corse in 1939, Enzo started up Auto Avio Costruzioni. The AAC 815 is the first car Ferrari's startup built on its own.\n\nAAC built two 815 cars in 1940. Both were prohibited from carrying the Ferrari name due to a noncompete agreement between Enzo and his previous employers. The agreement prohibited Ferrari from using his name in relation to races or race cars for at least four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough WWII forced Ferrari to curtail his racing activities, his company got back to work immediately following the war. In 1945, the company introduced a new V12 engine that would become one of Ferrari's signature offerings.\n\nIn 1947, Ferrari launched the 125. And since the noncompete agreement with Alfa had lapsed, this was the first car to carry the Ferrari name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the late 40s, Luigi Chinetti — a successful Italian-born racing driver and newly naturalized American citizen — approached Ferrari about the prospect of building sports cars for the public.\n\nNew York Times\n\nFerrari was hesitant because his company's main purpose was to win races. At that point, the only cars Ferrari sold were for privateers. Chinetti started racing and winning in Ferrari's cars around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the early 1950s, Luigi Chinetti got the sports cars he wanted and opened the very first Ferrari dealership in the US. Chinetti's showroom was located in Manhattan, but was later relocated to Connecticut.\n\nThe US became a huge market for Ferrari's cars. Even today, it remains Ferrari's most lucrative market. This opened the floodgates for Ferrari's business. Legendary cars such as the California Spider ....\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... the GTO and ...\n\n... the Testarossa soon appeared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the 1960s, Ferrari's cars demonstrated their prowess on and off the track.\n\nIn 1963, Ford CEO Henry Ford II jumped at the opportunity to buy Ferrari's road car business. The deal failed after Enzo found out that Ferrari would have to ask Ford for money from Detroit to go racing.\n\nAutomobile\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncensed by his failure to close the deal, Ford decided to beat Enzo's team at the 24 Hours of LeMans.\n\nFerrari ruled Le Mans at the time. Enzo and his team had dominated the grueling 24 hour-long endurance sports-car race — winning six times in a row from 1960-1965.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy 1966, Ford's challenger for Ferrari's cars was ready. The legendary GT40 was set to race at Le Mans.\n\nHenry Ford II got his revenge. The GT40 won Le Mans with a stunning 1-2-3 finish, ending Ferrari's dominance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFord would go on to win four years in a row — from 1966 until 1969.\n\nBy 1969, Enzo realized his company needed additional resources not only to be successful, but also to survive. That year, Ferrari sold 50% of the business to the company that once refused to give him a job — Fiat!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnzo Ferrari died in 1988 at the age of 90. But before his passing, he signed off on one final car to commemorate the 40th anniversary of his company.\n\nThe mighty F40!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the passing of Enzo Ferrari, longtime executive Luca di Montezemolo assumed the position of President and later Chairman. Under his guidance, Ferrari was transformed into a global luxury brand.\n\nToday, the company sells its supercars for hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd its hypercars for millions.\n\nFerrari also licenses everything from clothes to jewelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's even a Ferrari-themed amusement park!\n\nClick here to read more about Ferrari World.\n\nOn the racing front, Ferrari is still at the top of its game. The company's Formula One team — still called Scuderia Ferrari — has won eight world championships since Enzo's death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith its IPO, Ferrari completed its transformation from a startup racing operation to a multibillion-dollar global brand. But true to its roots, Ferrari trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RACE.\n\nSince the IPO, the company's market cap has risen to $30 billion, thanks to big-ticket cars such as the 812 Superfast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltra-exclusive models like the Monza SP1 and SP2 — $2 million cars — have also helped.\n\nOn the auction market, Ferraris have set records. In 2018, a Ferrari went for $48 million, breaking a previous record of just over $38 million in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll eyes are on the next major new vehicle from Maranello — the Purosangue, Ferrari's first SUV. Or \"FUV,\" as the company likes to say.\n\nAnd it's rumored that Ferrari could launch an all-electric supercar. In the meantime, there's the SF90 Stradale. It's the most powerful production Ferrari ever, making almost 1,000 horsepower from its turbocharged V8 engine and three-motor hybrid drive system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nIPO Luxury Formula One\n\nAdvertisement"
