        "text": "History of Ferrari\n\nOne of the most admired manufacturers of luxury sports cars in the world is Ferrari. In 1947, the company made its public debut. Enzo Ferrari, the company's founder, and namesake was active in motorsports much earlier. Born in Modena, Italy in 1898, Enzo Ferrari started out as a race car driver. In the 1920s, he was made a driver with Alfa Romeo and won several racing awards including the 2nd Circuito di Modena. In 1929, Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari, now the official race car division for Ferrari. It began, however, as a division of Alfa that specialized in preparing race cars for gentlemen drivers. This was at a time when sports car racing was really taking off as an activity for the rich and famous, who were really the only ones who could afford it. Ferrari unveiled a V12 engine in 1945, which went on to become one of its trademarks. The first Ferrari model, the 125 S or 125 Sport, didn't leave the factory entrance of the Via Abetone Inferiore in Maranello, Italy, until 1947, nearly ten years after Enzo left Alfa. Initially, there were only two models made. The vehicle won the Rome Grand Prix on May 25 of that year after competing in its first competitive race at the Piacenza Circuit. The car was supposed to be released earlier, but because of World War II, the date was postponed. The company relocated to Maranello and built the storied factory thereafter bombs hit the Modena factory. The Ferrari legacy continued till today becoming a legendary manufacturer with the most sought-after cars like the 250 GTO, Ferrari F40, La Ferrari, and other iconic models.\n\nKey facts:\n\nFerrari was Founded in 1947\n\nFounder Enzo Ferrari\n\nScuderia Ferrari Racing Team Founded in 1929\n\nFerrari Testarossa\n\nAs the Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer's replacement, the Ferrari Testarossa (Type F110) is a 12-cylinder mid-engine sports car that Ferrari started manufacturing in 1984. With two model revisions following the end of Testarossa production, the 512 TR and F512 M, which were produced from 1992 until 1996, the Pininfarina-designed car was initially produced from 1984 until 1991. It was one of the most mass-produced Ferrari models at the time, with almost 10,000 vehicles produced overall, including revised variations. The Paris Motor Show in October 1984 saw the return of the glorious Testarossa as heir to the 512 BBi. Pininfarinaâs design broke somewhat with tradition and was striking and innovative. The side intakes were larger than on the previous model and this constraint saw the introduction of the long side strakes that would become the Testarossaâs most recognizable feature.\n\nThe 250 Testa Rossa sports racing car, which won the 1957 World Sportscar Championship, was honored with the Testarossa moniker. Italian for \"red head,\" Testa Rossa refers to the red-painted cam covers that both cars' 12-cylinder engines wear.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe 1981 512 BBi's flaws are where the Testarossa got its start. Among the issues the Testarossa was designed to address were a cramped cabin and an indoor plumbing system that ran between the front-mounted radiator and the midships-mounted engine. The Testarossa was created to be larger than its predecessor in order to address these issues. For instance, the Testarossa was half a foot wider than the Boxer at 1,976 mm (77.8 in) wide. This caused the wheelbase to increase, extending from 2,550 mm (100.4 in) to about 64 mm (2.5 in), which was used to store luggage in a carpeted storage area under the front forward-opening hood. Additional storage space was made possible behind the seats in the cabin. Headroom was also increased with a roofline half an inch taller than the Boxer.\n\nPerformance\n\nFerrari's 4.9 L (4,943 cc), 180Â° longitudinally mounted flat-12 engine powers the Testarossa. The engine is lubricated using a dry sump system and has four DOHC valves per cylinder for a total of 48 valves. The engine's maximum power is 287 kW (390 PS; 385 hp) at 6,300 rpm, and its maximum torque is 490 Nm (361 lb-ft) at 4,500 rpm. The engine has a compression ratio of 9.20:1. Early models of the car in the United States had the same engine but slightly less power, which was rated at (380 hp). The Testarossa can reach speeds of 161 km/h (100 mph) in 11.4 seconds after accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 5.8 seconds, 0-97 km/h (60 mph) in 5.2 seconds.\n\nTestarossa Spider\n\nThe Testarossa Spider is the only authorized convertible version of the Testarossa, and it was created in 1986 as a tribute to the 20 years that Gianni Agnelli had served as chairman of Fiat. It features an Argento NÃ¼rburgring exterior, a white interior with magnolia leather trim and a dark blue stripe above matte black sills, and a white electronically operated soft top that could be manually stowed away. In place of an aluminum Ferrari logo on the hood, the vehicle was delivered to Agnelli in just four months. The silver motif alludes to Ag, the first two letters of Agnelli's name, the periodic table abbreviation for elemental silver.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n1984â1996 9,939 units\n\n4.9 L Tipo F113 and F113 B flat-12\n\n290 km/h Top Speed\n\n385 hp\n\n5-speed manual Transmission\n\nFerrari Testarossa in Riyadh Car Show\n\nthe Riyadh Car Show by Seven Concours featured more than 400 Exotic and (one of) cars, Demonstrating the exclusivity and strength of the automotive industry in Saudi Arabia and the Middle east.
