        "text": "Over the past seven decades, Ferrari has come a long way since its start as a fledgling racecar builder .\n\nIn 2015, Ferrari's IPO on the New York Stock Exchange valued the company at nearly $10 billion. Now, the company's market cap has risen to $30 billion. This makes the car maker one of the most valuable and recognizable brands in the world ;its \"prancing horse\" logo is synonymous with sex, money and the high life.\n\nFerrari wasn't always the global luxury brand that's now being traded in New York. The company's early days as a maker of racing cars were rather humble, and it took an Italian-American racing star named Luigi Chinetti to begin the transformation into a purveyor of glamorous supercars for the world's well-heeled. The company's success drew takeover interest, and later rivalry, from Ford before Ferrari eventually became part of FIAT.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more : I drove a $474,000 Ferrari 812 Superfast to see if the sports car delivers a thrill worth the price here's the verdict .\n\nFor many years, Ferrari artificially limited its annual production figures to preserve the exclusivity of its cars. However, since the IPO in the fall of 2015, the company has steadily increased the number of cars it delivers to customers.\n\nBut even if Ferrari sells 10,000 cars, those cars are still exceedingly rare. In fact, most of the company's models are supply limited in that the number it sells is limited not by how many people want to buy a car but by how many they can make.\n\nHere is the story of Ferrari's incredible seven-decade-plus journey:\n\nAn earlier version of this story was written by Benjamin Zhang.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider\n\nSee Also:\n\nFOLLOW US: on Facebook for more car and transportation content!"
