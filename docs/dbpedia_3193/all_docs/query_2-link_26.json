        "text": "FERRARI – A LE MANS HISTORY?\n\nFerrari officially announced recently, that they are returning to the World Endurance Championships in 2023, in sports car prototype racing , which includes the 24hr Le Mans hyper-car class.\n\nAs 2023 is upon us, and another golden era of endurance racing is around the corner, we thought it a good idea to look back at the history of Ferrari at Le Mans.\n\nThis year, Ferrari, with their brand new 499p hyper-car will make an effort to dominate the top tier contesters and aim to win the most coveted price, the 24 hours of Le Mans.\n\nFerrari began competing in endurance racing in 1949, the company was just 2 years old and Enzo Ferrari was in his early 50’s.\n\nIt traces his roots back to 1929, when Enzo founded the Scuderia Ferrari Racing Team, under the banner of Alfa Romea, for whom he worked.\n\nThey had many racing successes between the two World Wars, although the team, and cars, were branded Alfa Romeao, in cars like the 8C-2300 and Tipo B.\n\nEndurance racing rules, at that time, stated that only two drivers were allowed to drive the car for the duration of the 24hr race.\n\nThere was no rule as to the length of each drivers stint, however.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1977 when the rule was significantly changed to allow three drivers and with specific time restrictions.\n\nAfter the end of World War 2, Enzo was out of contractual obligations with Alfa, and wanted to compete in long distance and endurance races, under the newly formed Ferrari Name.\n\nHe kicked off his dreams of winning with the 166mm Barchetta, in 1948.\n\nThe 166 was first entered in the most famous long-distance race of the time, the Mille Miglia, a 1000 mile race around the towns of northern Italy.\n\nFerrari had their first overall win at Le Mans, with the 166, in 1949.\n\nThe car was raced by Luigi Chinetti and Peter Michell- Thomson.\n\nThe formation of the World Sports Car Championship in 1953 changed the motorsport landscape forever.\n\nTeams like Ferrari, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar began to enter multiple factory backed cars (or works cars) to compete for overall wins.\n\nThe next win for Ferrari, came in 1954.\n\nThe car was the 375 Plus, driven by Jose Froila n Gonza lez and Maurice Trintignant.\n\nIn 1958, Olivier Gendebien and Phil Hill delivered Ferraris next win in the 250TR58.\n\nFerrari lost out in 1959 to the Ecurie Ecosse team, fielding a Jaguar D-Type driven by Ivor Bueb and Ron Flockhart.\n\nFerrari bounced back in 1960, winning that year and the next 5, in cars such as the Ferrari 330 TR/LM Spyder, 250 P, 275 P and the iconic 250 LM.\n\n1966 saw the start of the infamous battle with Ford and their GT40.\n\nFord would go on to win the next 3 years in succession and Ferrari sadly pulled the plug on the works team in 1973.\n\nMany privately entered Ferrari’s have won multiple WEC races but the pinnacle “24hr Le Mans overall race win” has since eluded them.\n\nIn late 2022, Ferrari also debuted the 296GT3 to replace the 488 GTE race car, although this is only likely to compete in in the 2024 season."
