Have an account? .\n\nFerrari is one of the most valuable brands in the world.\n\nFerrari — the Italian supercar maker and Formula One racing operation — is worth $27 billion.\n\nUnlike many of its rivals, Ferrari is a racing operation first and car company second.\n\nFerrari was founded as a racing team with the sale of road cars as a means to fund the racing operation.\n\nIn 2018, Ferrari delivered more than 9,250 cars, up 10% over the previous year.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

Nearly four years later, the company's market cap has more than doubled, to $27 billion. This makes the carmaker one of the most valuable and recognizable brands in the world. Its prancing-horse logo is synonymous with sex, money, and the high life.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nFerrari wasn't always the global luxury brand that's now being traded in New York. The company's early days as a maker of racing cars were rather humble, and it took an Italian-American racing star named Chinetti to begin the transformation into a purveyor of glamorous supercars for the world's well-heeled. The company's success drew takeover interest, and later rivalry, from Ford — before Ferrari became part of Fiat and eventually Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nRead more: I drove a $475,000 Ferrari 812 Superfast to see if the sports car delivers a thrill worth the price\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many years, Ferrari artificially limited its annual production figures to preserve the exclusivity of its cars. But since its IPO in the fall of 2015, the company has steadily increased the number of cars it delivers to customers. In 2018, 9,251 new Ferraris found their way to customers around the world, an increase of 852 cars, or 10.2%, over 2017.\n\nYet even at more than 9,000 cars a year, Ferraris are still rare. Most of the company's models are supply limited in that its sales are limited not by how many people want to buy a car but by how many it can make.\n\nHere is the story of Ferrari's incredible 70-year journey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1908, a 10-year-old Enzo Ferrari saw his first car race and immediately became hooked. As a young adult, Enzo was drafted by the Italian army to fight in World War I.\n\nAfter the war, Enzo had a hard time finding work in the auto business. He applied to work at Fiat but was rejected because of an abundance of unemployed war veterans. Eventually he found work at smaller automakers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the early 1920s, Enzo landed a job at Alfa Romeo as a race-car driver. Fellow drivers at the company included legendary aces like Tazio Nuvolari, here in an Alfa.\n\nIn 1929, Enzo launched Scuderia Ferrari, or Team Ferrari. There was no car company yet: Scuderia consisted of a group of drivers who raced the cars they owned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team raced mostly Alfa Romeo cars. By 1933, Scuderia Ferrari had essentially become Alfa's racing division.\n\nIn 1937, Enzo shut down Scuderia Ferrari and became the head of Alfa Romeo's factory racing operation, Alfa Corse. But that wouldn't last. He wasn't happy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week after leaving Alfa Corse in 1939, Enzo started up Auto Avio Costruzioni. The AAC 815 is the first car Ferrari's startup built on its own.\n\nAAC built two 815 cars in 1940. Both were prohibited from carrying the Ferrari name because of a non-compete agreement between Enzo and his previous employers. The agreement prohibited Ferrari from using his name in relation to races or race cars for at least four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough WWII forced Ferrari to curtail his racing activities, his company got back to work immediately following the war. In 1945, the company introduced a new V12 engine that would become one of Ferrari's signature offerings.\n\nIn 1947, Ferrari launched the 125. And since the non-compete agreement with Alfa had lapsed, this was the first car to carry the Ferrari name, establishing the company as we know it today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the late '40s, Luigi Chinetti, a successful Italian-born racing driver and a newly naturalized American citizen, approached Ferrari about the prospect of building sports cars for the public.\n\nFerrari was hesitant because his company's main purpose was to win races. At that point, the only cars Ferrari sold were for privateers. Chinetti started racing and winning in Ferrari's cars around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the early 1950s, Luigi Chinetti got the sports cars he wanted and opened the first Ferrari dealership in the US. Chinetti's showroom was located in Manhattan but was later relocated to Connecticut.\n\nThe US became a huge market for Ferrari's cars. Even today, it remains Ferrari's most lucrative market. This opened the floodgates for Ferrari's business. Legendary cars such as the California Spider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... the GTO and ...\n\n... the Testa Rossa soon appeared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the 1960s, Ferrari's cars demonstrated their prowess on and off the track.\n\nIn 1963, Ford CEO Henry Ford II jumped at the opportunity to buy Ferrari's road-car business.
