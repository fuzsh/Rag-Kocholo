        "text": "In a surprise ceremony last Friday, McPherson College received and unveiled a classic 1972 Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona, a two-seat grand tourer, a gift from Dr. Richard Lundquist, LHD. A longtime supporter of the college’s auto restoration program, Lundquist’s gift marks the first Ferrari the college has ever received.\n\n“I’m pleased to hand over the keys to one of my most prized possessions to the wonderful students and faculty at McPherson College,” said Lundquist. “It’s my hope that the car provides enhanced learning opportunities and can be restored by the students and eventually compete in prestigious events.”\n\nFor 46 years, McPherson College has been the only college in America developing the next generation of automotive restorers, with graduates securing positions with some of the top car collectors, museums, and restoration companies in the world. The program’s students study and work on historic cars, including a 1927 Ford Model A, a 1936 V-12 Lincoln Convertible Sedan, and a 1956 Austin Healey 100M, and are able to learn how to properly work on and restore cars that carry a deep history. And while they have worked on many unique and storied vehicles, the Ferrari stands alone in its prestige and history.\n\n“The magnitude of this gift is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for not only our automotive restoration students, but the entire McPherson community,” said McPherson College President Michael Schneider. “This is one of the most impactful educational tools and gifts that McPherson College has ever received. We cannot thank Richard enough for this gift and his continued friendship and support of the college.”\n\nThe 1972 Ferrari 365 GTB/4 is one of the last models manufactured by Ferrari before company founder and namesake Enzo Ferrari sold the company to Fiat. The two-seat grand tourer, designed by Pininfarina and built by Carrozzeria Scaglietti, was ranked number two in Motor Trend’s “Greatest Ferraris of All Time.”\n\n“This car is old-school. It’s largely handmade at a time when this just wasn’t done, and with its engine in the front, the 365 GTB/4 ran counter to the latest trend of putting the engine behind the driver,” Ed Barr, professor of technology at McPherson College, said. “Enzo Ferrari’s willingness to disregard the latest fad and embrace craftsmanship in pursuit of excellence are sentiments our students will appreciate. The hands-on study of this car will allow our students to retrace the steps and learn the methods of the craftspeople who built it the first time.”\n\nAfter the unveiling, students were able to come to the stage to examine the car up close and talk with Lundquist about the vehicle’s story and journey to McPherson College.\n\n“It gave me a broad smile to see the students engaging with the car up close in a way that could never happen if it was cordoned off in a museum,” said Lundquist.\n\nDuring a ceremony earlier Friday, McPherson also officially dedicated, cut the ribbon, and formally opened the Paul Russell and Company Center for Automotive Research, made possible through a generous gift from Melanie and Richard Lundquist. Last year, McPherson College announced that Florida philanthropist and automotive enthusiast, Dano Davis, gave $1 million in a match gift towards the college’s $20 million goal.\n\nIn March 2021, McPherson College conferred honorary doctorates on Richard and his wife, Melanie, to recognize the couple’s significant body of work in driving systemic change in K-12 public education, health care delivery, and innovation, as well as the environment. The Doctor of Humane Letters (LHD) degrees were awarded by McPherson College’s Board of Trustees and faculty, who voted unanimously to recognize the Lundquists with the honorary degrees."
