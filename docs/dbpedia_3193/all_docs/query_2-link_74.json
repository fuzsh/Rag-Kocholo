In Arese, next to Milan city center and the Expo area.\n\nDave Nicholas has taken many shots of Ferrari's from Sebring 59-50-61-62 and some 64-65 and other major races in the North America. Latest updates ... \"Results updates include complete nat'l races from Lime Rock and Marlboro 1957 to 1962. Bud Hofer donated some great shots from the Glen GP in 1961. Don Cooke gave us hundreds of shots and the first posted are a great glance at the very last Sunday race at Lime Rock in April 1959. These shots include the notorious Paul Richards trying to dry out the main straight in his Cessna ! A whole new look at Bridgehampton with shots from 1951, 1957, 1966, 1968.\"\n\nWho do you think you are? Stirling Moss? This, so the story goes, is what a policeman asked the legendary British racing driver following a particularly daring overtaking manoeuvre on the streets of London. Yes sir, I am was the honest reply. Theres a nod to this legendary tale  and a number of other aspects of Mosss life and career  in The Last Blast, a new short film by Mercedes-Benz Classic. A police motorcycle outrider admonishes the over-enthusiastic driver of the very Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR made famous by Mosss win in the 1955 Mille Miglia race.\n\nStarting from Maseratis roots to plan its future: the values of exclusivity, unique design and 100% Italian DNA of cars of the past are renewed today in the models that mark the Brands New Era. It is in this spirit that Maserati celebrates the 70th anniversary of the A6G 2000. The first A6G 2000, a car representative of the A6 series, built by Maserati from 1947 to 1956 and named in homage to Alfieri Maserati (hence the letter A) with a 6 indicating the engine type (straight 6) was delivered exactly 70 years ago, in February 1951..\n\nThe Ferrari SF90 Stradale Assetto Fiorano has set the fastest lap recorded by a production car at the 2.439-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, lapping the circuit at an impressive 1:29.625 seconds at a maximum speed of 174.6 mph to set this time. It was a great moment to witness, seeing how the impressive performance of the Ferrari SF90 Stradale put down this lap record on July 15, says Mark Raffauf, Senior Director of Race Operations at International Motor Sports Association (IMSA), which oversaw the test.\n\nThe Museo Lamborghini is situated to the right of the main entrance of the factory in SantAgata Bolognese, which is a historic small town in the countryside, approximately mid way between Bologna and Modena. A bonus of its location right on the factory premises is that one will see cars being taken out on test, and maybe even spot the odd prototype. The factory is on the main SP 255, Via Modena, on the outskirts of the town, but within walking distance of the historic centre, and is still the site on which Ferruccio Lamborghini established the original factory in 1963.\n\nFerrari opens its first Tailor Made Center in the United States today in New York City. The only space of its kind in the Americas, this new Center continues the long-standing tradition of car customization and personalization that began at the factory in Maranello in the 1950s and later grew into the inception of the Tailor Made Center in 2011, followed by the Shanghai Tailor Made Center in 2014.\n\nHans Herrmann, one of the most successful and popular racing drivers to join the Porsche AG works team, will be celebrating his 90th birthday this year on February 23. The endurance and Monoposto specialist, born in Stuttgart in 1928, is regarded as one of the most reliable and consistent race drivers of all time. In the course of his motor sport career, Hans Herrmann won more than 80 overall and best of class victories, most of them for Porsche.\n\nDr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG mourns the death of Eberhard Mahle. The former racing driver died on 21 December 2021 at the age of 88. Eberhard Mahle was European Champion in 1966. He was the first driver to take an international title in a Porsche 911. He had previously achieved success with other brands, such as in the 1957 German GT Championship in an Alfa Romeo and at the 1959 German Hill Climb Championship in a Volvo. He was a works driver for Abarth, Borgward and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nOn 12 March 1947, Enzo Ferrari started up the Ferrari 125 S, the first car to bear his name. The Ferrari that crossed the Maranello gates in 1947 was more than a new car, it was a declaration of intent, and the beginning of a 75-year culture of excellence built on craftsmanship, dedication, tradition and innovation. It is a culture that has created a stream of automotive masterpieces, each destined to transcend time.\n\nThe inaugural Motoring Literary & Art Festival was held in the The Wing building at the Silverstone circuit over the weekend of 02-03 December. The event was organised by Porter Press International, the renowned book publishing company, based near Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire. Despite freezing and foggy weather conditions on the Saturday, making for difficult driving conditions, especially for those travelling from the north of the country, where conditions deteriorated into snowfall, the gathering was well attended.\n\nImagine you are a wealthy entrepreneur, and you are into classic cars You own an extensive collection of significant cars, and you travel the world to show these gems on various high class concours, drive them on rallyes like the Mille Miglia or even do vintage racing. Your idea of taking vacations is spending several days a year away from home following the classic car circus leaving less time for the family than your beloved might want you to.\n\nOn 18 February 2024, the new Ferrari One of a Kind exhibition at the Museo Enzo Ferrari in Modena was officially inaugurated. The display celebrates the craftsmanship behind each unique masterpiece that emerges from the Ferrari factory gates thanks to the exclusive personalisation programme offered by the companys three Tailor Made centres in Maranello, New York and Shanghai. Now open to the public, the exhibition reveals the exclusivity of these one-of-a-kind cars, each expressing the personality, taste and desires of individual Ferrari owners.\n\nOn 18 February 2024, the new Ferrari One of a Kind exhibition at the Museo Enzo Ferrari in Modena was officially inaugurated.

The Sunday Concours concluded a week-long celebration of the automobile which included auction, seminars, film viewings and several automotive events. In total, over 27,000 automotive enthusiasts visited The Amelia between February 29 and March 3.\n\nProf. Friedhelm Loh's National Car Museum, less than 2 hours driving time from Cologne or Frankfurt, is launching a new Ferrari-themed special edition full of superlatives. Running from 23 March  03 November 2024, visitors will be treated to well-known Ferraris, but also numerous new treasures that had not previously been featured in this incredible museum which only opened last summer.\n\nInaugurated in 1921, Spa-Francorchamps is one of the worlds most famous motorsport circuits. The first edition of Belgiums most iconic race, the 24 Hours, was in 1924. In more than a century, Ferrari has amassed many victories in endurance races at Spa, achieving 13 overall wins with sports cars and prototypes. These include the first victory in the 24 Hours of Spa in 1949 by Luigi Chinetti and Jean Lucas and the triumph in the 1000 Kilometres of Spa in 1953 by Olivier Gendebien, both achieved with the 166 MM.\n\nWe are all privileged to look back on a weekend full of spectacular automobiles representing their era. The dreamlike flair of the Grand Hotel Villa dEste on the shores of Lake Como offered the perfect stage to experience the magic of mobility at this year´s edition of the Concorso dEleganza Villa dEste in all its fabulous diversity. The worlds arguably most exclusive and traditional heritage festival for automobiles captivated a host of visitors from 24th May to 26th May at the venue. The Jury selected the ultimate stellar winner from the participants campaigning in the eight glamorous classes.\n\nAfter Ferraris overall win in the 2023 centenary edition of the race with the 499P, expectations were high for a repeat performance, although this year there was a greater number of entries in the premier Hypercar class. Ferrari themselves had an additional 499P, entered by AF Corse, bringing their total to three, whilst there were no less than six Porsche 963 models, three works and three private entries. Cadillac had a trio of entries, Toyota had their pair of GRO10s, whilst other duos came from Alpine, BMW, Lamborghini and Peugeot, with a singleton Isotta Fraschini, making a total of 23 cars in the class.\n\nBarkaways held their always popular annual Open Day on Saturday 08 June, attracting around 300 clients and friends, with some 100 cars during the course of the day, to the gathering at their premises near Tonbridge, Kent. Fortunately, the vagaries of the English summer weather didnt impact on the day, although a few ominous black clouds hovered by, but didnt dispense any precipitation.\n\nThe Centenary 24 Hours of Spa concluded with the number 51 296 GT3 of the AF Corse  Francorchamps Motors team finishing in second place. Alessandro Pier Guidi, who crossed the line, shared the car with fellow Prancing Horse official drivers Alessio Rovera and Davide Rigon. The team led the race until 48 minutes from the end, but was hindered by a stationary car in the pit lane as Pier Guidi was returning for the final refuelling. This situation thwarted the 296 GT3's chances of claiming a victory that had seemed assured.\n\nThe 30th edition of charity event \"Sport et Collection\" was held as usual on the Val de Vienne racetrack near Poitiers in France at the beginning of June. I remember concluding my report on last years edition by stating \"Don't miss this 30th anniversary\"  and right I was.!\n\nThe organiser team lead by Jean-Pierre Doury prepared an outstanding edition. More than 600 Ferraris were there, beating the long-standing record of the 2009 edition, when the event had held a heat of the late \"Ferrari Historic Challenge\" and also F1 Clienti.\n\nThere were a number of other anniversary celebrations, the biggest being that of 20 years of Red Bull Racing, from when they bought the Jaguar team in 2004. Since then, they have won six Formula One Constructors Championships and seven Drivers Championships. Their display occupied the whole of the Cathedral Paddock, encompassing not only Formula One, but many of the types of motor sport on two and four wheels in which they are involved.\n\nRM Sothebys is excited to offer the ultimate version of early Testa Rossas, the 1957 Ferrari 625 TRC Spider s/n 0680 MDTR. It is an impossibly rare, exquisitely shaped, and powerfully specified touchstone of sports car racings most glorious epoch and another highlight of the RM Sothebys Monterey auction. To understand the 625 TRCs place in Ferraris history, we need to start with the man who commissioned these cars, John von Neumann. ....\n\nRM Sothebys is excited to offer the ultimate version of early Testa Rossas, the 1957 Ferrari 625 TRC Spider s/n 0680 MDTR.

Over the decades this has grown to an entire week called car week that builds up the tension with auctions, concours and parties for the Grande finale on Concours Sunday. And although most people associate car week with static car displays of perfectly restored classics gleaming in the Californian sun there is more to that and 50 years ago the historic races at the nearby Laguna Seca Race Track came to life building another pillar in the event schedule.\n\nIt is August and few other classic car events are more prestigious than the Pebble Beach concours held in the Monterey Peninsula for the last 74 years.
