        "text": "In 1947, Enzo Ferrari founded his modest factory in Maranello.\n\nThe mass vehicle market was poised to explode in the early postwar years, but he made a determined decision to go against the trend, pouring his skills instead into his ambition of creating racing cars.\n\nHe spared no personnel or financial resources in developing the 125 S, a car that was a manifesto not just for technological progress but also for Ferrari's own racing goals, and established the groundwork for a lengthy saga of triumphs.\n\nFerrari | the myth of the prancing horse\n\nThe renowned prancing horse, taken from the one used by the Italian aviator Francesco Baracca during World War I, is Ferrari's official symbol.\n\nWhen it comes to the color that has always marked the Maranello automobiles, we can say that there are numerous Ferrari reds: from the original Alfa red to today's standard Corsa red, to the many hues of racing cars.\n\nFerrari | design | Pininfarina\n\nIn terms of design, Ferrari and Pininfarina's collaboration is now legendary.\n\nA shared affinity is instantly discovered between the two, and it is evident that we can work well together.\n\nThe first result of the partnership is a convertible, the 212 Inter, which made its debut at the Paris Motor Show in 1952.\n\nDespite the two's tough personalities, a relationship of mutual satisfaction develops from this point.\n\nFrom 1951 forward, Pininfarina will be the exclusive bodywork provider for the Prancing Horse automobiles for many years.\n\nFerrari | worldwide | brand\n\nFerrari has been the most recognizable Italian brand in the world, linked with power, speed, design, style, beauty, and success.\n\nSuffice it to say that the Ferrari brand was named the most influential in the world in 2013 and 2014."
