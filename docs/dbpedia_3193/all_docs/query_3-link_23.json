        "text": "In 1929, the world was in a financial crisis, and possibilities seemed limited for many. But for a man named Enzo Ferrari, adversity was just an obstacle in his relentless pursuit of excellence. He founded Scuderia Ferrari, and with his vision and determination, transformed the team into one of the most powerful and respected in the world. But Enzo wasn't satisfied with just being a leader on the track; he wanted to create the best car brand in the world.\n\nSomething so special that not all the money in the world could buy. Ferrari became an icon of elegance, technology, and performance. But only those who truly deserved it could own a Ferrari. This exclusive attitude attracted criticism. Some saw Enzo as arrogant and haughty, but to others, he was a man who challenged limits and broke barriers. Join us to discover the complete story of Enzo Ferrari and the brand he created—a tale of passion, innovation, and above all, excellence.\n\nIn 1923, Enzo Anselmo Ferrari was born in Modena, Italy. However, due to a heavy snowstorm, his birth wasn't officially registered until two days later. Enzo's parents, Alfredo Ferrari and Edelgisa Bisbini, had two children together, with Enzo being the younger brother of Alfredo Junior, also known as Dino—a name that would later gain prominence.\n\nEnzo's father, Alfredo Ferrari, was born in Capri, and he moved to Modena in search of a better life for his family. He opened a metallurgical company in the basement of their house. One of the most significant events in Enzo Ferrari's life occurred when he was just 10 years old. Italy was involved in wars against the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, leading to the country's entry into World War I. Enzo was enlisted in the Italian Army's Third Mountain Artillery Regiment, and most of the fighting took place in northern Italy. In 1916, an Italian flu epidemic claimed the lives of his father and older brother, Alfredo Junior. Ferrari was forced to leave the Italian army after falling seriously ill during the 1918 flu epidemic. When the war was coming to an end, the family business collapsed, and Enzo began searching for jobs in the automotive industry after recovering.\n\nEnzo Ferrari offered his skills to Fiat in Turin but was unsuccessful. The following year, he joined a construction company called CMN (Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali). His competitive debut came in 1919 at the Parma-Poggio di Berceto hill climb race, where he finished fourth. That same year, he competed in the famous Targa Florio race but had to retire due to a fuel leak in his car's tank. Nonetheless, he still managed to finish ninth, a considerable achievement given the mechanical failures experienced by many cars in the race. Thanks to this experience, Ferrari landed a job at the respected Italian car manufacturer, Alfa Romeo. He won his first major Grand Prix at the Savio Circuit in Ravenna in 1923 and had his best season in 1924, winning three races, including the Targa Florio. By this time, he was already a well-known name in Italian motor racing circles and began getting involved in managerial aspects.\n\nIn 1932, Ferrari decided to retire and focus on managing and developing Alfa Romeo's racing cars. He assembled a team of superstar drivers, including the legendary Tazio Nuvolari. This decision was motivated by the birth of his son, Alfredo, who was named after his late older brother, Dino. The Scuderia Ferrari team served as Alfa Romeo's racing division, and the Alfa Romeo P3, along with the excellent drivers in the team, such as Nuvolari, helped achieve great success during that period. It was during this time that the prancing horse logo started to appear on the team's vehicles. According to the story, Ferrari received a necklace with a prancing horse pendant from the mother of Francesco Baracca, an Italian flying ace, before one of his flights during World War I. Ferrari used the prancing horse to create the emblem that would become the renowned Ferrari shield in honor of Baracca's death while serving in the war. Ferrari left Alfa Romeo in 1939 and founded Auto Avio Costruzioni, a company that supplied parts to other racing teams. Despite a contractual clause that prohibited him from racing or designing cars, Ferrari managed to produce two cars for the 1940 Mille Miglia race, which were driven by Alberto Ascari and Lotario Rangoni. For four years, Ferrari's factory was forced to produce weapons and trucks for Mussolini's fascist government during World War II. After the factory was bombed by the U.S. Air Force, Ferrari moved from Modena to Maranello, where he decided to start producing automobiles after the war. Thus, Ferrari SpA was founded in 1947.\n\nEnzo chose to compete against the dominant Alfa Romeos and lead his own team. The team made its debut in Turin in 1948, and its first victory came at the 1949 German 24 Hours of Spa with the Ferrari 166 MM. This marked the beginning of Ferrari's numerous victories in motorsport. In 1950, the first season of the Formula One World Championship, Ferrari entered the competition as a factory team. The first Formula One car to compete for Ferrari was the 125 F1, powered by a V12 engine producing around 230 horsepower at 7,000 revolutions per minute. The car's top speed was approximately 240 km/h (149 mph), and its fuel efficiency was around 1.5 km per liter (9-10 mpg) under ideal track conditions. It's worth noting that fuel consumption wasn't as significant a concern back then as it is today, and car performance was more important than efficiency. The 125 F1 made its debut at the 1950 Monaco Grand Prix, with Italian driver Alberto Ascari behind the wheel. Unfortunately, Ascari didn't perform well in the race and retired after 20 laps due to mechanical issues. However, in the second race of the championship in Switzerland, Ascari drove the Ferrari to its first Formula One victory. Ferrari continued to be a dominant presence in Formula One in the following decades, winning numerous driver and constructor championships. Legendary Austrian driver Niki Lauda secured three world titles for the team in the 1970s, while Brazilian Ayrton Senna won three consecutive championships for McLaren-Ferrari in the 1980s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Ferrari adopted a strategy called the \"Ferrari Formula\" to ensure leadership in Formula One. Essentially, the Ferrari Formula involved providing their two drivers, Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello, with identical cars and exclusive parts. The team dedicated significant resources and investments to prepare these cars, aiming for superior performance compared to other teams. With this strategy, Ferrari dominated Formula One for six consecutive seasons from 1999 to 2004, winning the constructor's championship each year. Additionally, Schumacher became the most successful driver in the history of the category, securing seven world titles.\n\nHowever, the Ferrari Formula also faced criticism, especially for limiting the freedom of drivers and reducing the excitement of races. Many believed that this strategy diminished competitiveness and made races predictable. Nevertheless, the success Ferrari achieved with thisstrategy cannot be denied. It became an example of how a team can work together to achieve their goals and emerge victorious in such a highly competitive category like Formula One.\n\nFerrari showcased to the world that it's possible to create an unbeatable racing machine capable of taking its drivers to the top of the podium. And that's just one of the many chapters in the history of Ferrari in motorsport. To this day, Ferrari remains one of the most successful teams in Formula One, with a total of 16 constructor titles and 15 driver titles. The team has a legion of fans worldwide who adore the unique combination of beauty, speed, and passion that Ferrari represents.\n\nHowever, Enzo Ferrari's relentless focus on racing hindered the company from achieving significant profits. The first Ferrari produced for the consumer market only came in 1958, a Ferrari 250 GT—a grand tourer with a V12 engine. Controversies associated with racing continued to accumulate as Ferrari had an autocratic management style known for pitting drivers against each other to improve their performance. Some sources claim that Ferrari deliberately heightened psychological tension among their drivers by promoting rivalries within the team in a fiercely competitive environment to determine the best driver.\n\nUnfortunately, eight Ferrari drivers lost their lives while operating racing cars between 1955 and 1971. In 1969, Fiat acquired a 50% stake in Ferrari, resulting in increased investment capital. The factory underwent expansion to produce the Fiat Dino with a Ferrari engine, previously manufactured at the Fiat factory in Turin. Additionally, investments were made in new models at the top of the Ferrari lineup, and Fiat's involvement played a crucial role in bringing these cars to the market.\n\nDuring this time, a curious incident occurred involving Ferruccio Lamborghini, a wealthy Italian manufacturer of tractors and sports cars. He sent a letter to Enzo Ferrari, complaining about clutch problems in his Ferrari 250 GT. Ferrari's response was reportedly rude and dismissive, stating that Lamborghini should stick to building tractors. This incident helped shape the legendary rivalry between the two Italian automotive brands and contributed to the creation of some of the most iconic and desirable machines in the world. We've just made a video about the history of Lamborghini, so after finishing this video, don't forget to watch that one too.\n\nFerrari found lucrative success in producing models like the 308 GTB/GTS, followed by the 328 and the 365 Daytona during the 1970s, a period marked by oil shortages. It was during this context that the legendary story of Ferrari's V12 and V8 engines began to unfold. Ferrari cars offered high performance and an unparalleled sense of speed, providing drivers with a unique experience. Despite this, the brand was still seen as an average Italian car manufacturer, while young wealthy executives preferred Aston Martins, Jaguars, and Lamborghinis. However, a cultural shift occurred with the launch of the Testarossa in 1984. With its sleek design and powerful V12 engine, the Testarossa captured everyone's hearts and became the best-selling Ferrari of the 20th century.\n\nIn the meantime, Lamborghini also excelled in various aspects, such as the Lamborghini Countach, which became a pop culture icon of the 1980s. And let's not forget the flamboyant F40, which gained popularity after appearing on the TV show Miami Vice, starring Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. The young executives of the time ardently desired to own a Ferrari, and the brand's image skyrocketed overnight. The white Ferrari that regularly appeared from the third season onwards became a character of its own in the series.\n\nWhile Enzo Ferrari's health was slowly deteriorating, he witnessed the launch of the last masterpiece—a machine that surpassed even his wildest dreams. The 1990s witnessed the emergence of excellent Ferrari models like the Ferrari F50, 355, and 575. In honor of the company's founder, Ferrari introduced their fastest model at the time in 2002. Originally named the F60, it was later renamed the Enzo after successfully completing the design and engineering process. Only 399 examples were produced, with the last one, number 400, donated to the Vatican for charity. The Enzo had an initial price of $650,000 and was available only to dedicated and frequent Ferrari customers. Today, each model is valued at $1.3 million, an amount that could buy you four Ferrari 599 GTBs, currently the most expensive car in the lineup.\n\nLater on, models like the Ferrari 360 and F430 were introduced, both with excellent reputations for reliability. A silver Ferrari F430 Spider made an appearance in a cinematic reboot of Miami Vice starring Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, adding a touch of nostalgia to the film's visuals. While the FCA Group formed from the merger of automakers Fiat and Chrysler struggled, the luxury brand Ferrari announced its split on October 29, 2014, with the goal of establishing itself as an independent company. In 2015, after an initial public offering (IPO), Ferrari finally freed itself from Fiat and became an autonomous company, with shares priced at $52 per share.\n\nThroughout its rich history, the Ferrari racing team has received accolades for its Formula One success, with legendary driver Michael Schumacher being one of the greatest of all time, winning multiple Formula One championships. Ferrari continues to be at the forefront of Formula One racing technology and is now preparing for the electric vehicle era. By the end of 2026, Ferrari's model lineup will consist of 40 internal combustion engine (ICE) models and 60 electrified models. The company plans for 40 of its models to be fully electric, and 40 to be hybrids. Ferrari's racing division will contribute to the development of technology for these new vehicles. The company has already established a new development facility in Maranello for electrified vehicles and may even consider in-house battery production in the future.\n\nRecently, in September 2022, Ferrari launched its first SUV, the eagerly anticipated Purosangue. While an SUV may seem out of place for Ferrari, Lamborghini has successfully shown that it can work with the genre. With an estimated valuation of $30 billion in March 2020, the future is secure and bright for Ferrari, which may dominate the next 100 years. Ferrari is one of the most valuable car brands in the world, with rare and vintage models fetching millions of dollars in auctions. In 2018, a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO was sold for over $48 million, becoming the most expensive car ever sold at auction.\n\nSuggest a story in the comments!"
