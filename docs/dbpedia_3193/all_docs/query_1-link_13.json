        "text": "Exploring Ferrari's inspirations, original photography, hand written letters, original drawings and even his driving license, the exhibition is dedicated to detailing the remorseless drive of Enzo Ferrari to create the perfect driving machine for track and road. From the 125S to the F40, discover a side of Enzo Ferrari that is rarely ever seen by the public.\n\nKnown for his passion, wisdom and attention to detail, Ferrari started his career as a driver in 1919. His competitive debut was in the Parma-Poggio di Berceto hill climb race in which he finished fourth in the three-litre category at the wheel of a 2.3-litre 4-cylinder CMN 15/20.\n\nIn 1920, after a series of races in which he enjoys mixed fortunes at the wheel of an Isotta Fraschini 100/110 IM Corsa, Enzo finishes second in the Targa Florio in a 6-litre 4-cylinder Alfa Romeo Tipo 40/60. This marks the start of a 20-year collaboration with the marque that will see Ferrari do everything from test-driving to racing to dealing before finally being appointed head of the Alfa Corse racing division, a position he held until September 1939.\n\nIn 1929 Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari in Modena. The main aim of this racing “stable” was to allow owner-drivers to race. Its foundation marks the start of a burst of frenetic sporting activity that will lead to the creation of an official team. The Scuderia fielded both cars (mainly Alfas) and motorbikes. In time it becomes a technical-racing outpost of Alfa Romeo and effectively takes over as its racing department in 1933.\n\nOn September 6th 1939, Enzo Ferrari leaves Alfa Romeo under the proviso that he does not use the Ferrari name in association with races or racing cars for at least four years. From that moment on, beating Alfa Romeo in one of his own cars becomes a passion. On September 13th Ferrari opens Auto Avio Costruzioni on Viale Trento Trieste in Modena, the headquarters of the old Scuderia Ferrari.\n\nFerrari begins work on designing the first Ferrari in late 1945. His ambitious plan is to power it with a V12 engine. In fact, this particular architecture would become a fixture throughout the company’s entire history. The reason Ferrari chosen a V12 was its versatility: it was just as suited to use on sports prototypes as single-seaters and even Grand Tourers."
