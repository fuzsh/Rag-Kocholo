The stunning Daytona SP3.\n\nTwo Steps Forward\n\nThe 348 pushed Ferrari’s V8 sports cars into new performance territory, but early examples suffered from serious quality issues.\n\nPower Trip\n\nThe F12 offers great looks and even better handling, but Ferrari’s mighty 6.3-liter V12 is unquestionably the star of the show.\n\nBrand Expansion\n\nFerrari developed the all-new California to lure GT buyers away from other marques.\n\nImpact\n\nThe 308 introduced Ferrari to a new worldwide audience and launched an era of V8-powered sports cars.\n\nFashion Sense\n\nIn the 1950s, Carrozzeria Vignale and the prolific Giovanni Michelotti provided the same coachwork for two very different automobiles.\n\nSpur of the Moment\n\nFor most of us, a 14-month road trip in a 40-year-old Ferrari would entail plenty of planning. Brian Whalen just jumped in his 308 and started driv...\n\nEastern Promises\n\nIn the early 1990s, Honda introduced an all-new supercar that promised to beat the European establishment—including Ferrari.\n\nReal Deal?\n\nWhile the Mondial has courted controversy since its debut, the owners of this early example says the dislike isn’t deserved.\n\nHomegrown Boxer\n\nThis 365 GT4 BB sat undriven for decades in Ron Caldwell’s garage. In 2018, he restored it there, too.\n\nRight the First Time\n\nA brand-new restoration shop turned this race-prepped SWB into a concours winner—in less than three months.\n\nCrunch Time\n\nThe two-year rebirth of this totaled F355 was completed two weeks before the Ferrari was due at the 2015 FCA International Meet.\n\nTwo-Pedal Blues\n\nAlthough Mike Pucciarelli liked his 575M, he wasn’t a fan of its F1 transmission—so he had the car converted to a stick-shift.\n\nUndercover\n\nMatt Peak’s 308 looks stock. It’s not, and a 485-hp 3.9-liter V8 is only part of the story.\n\nTribute TR\n\nPeter Giacobbi couldn’t afford an authentic 1950s sports racer, so he made his own.\n\nLong and Winding Road\n\nIt took nearly 18 years to create this modern-day tribute to the NART Spyder.\n\nThe Veteran\n\nAt age 49, former Formula 1 driver and Le Mans winner Giancarlo Fisichella shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nNo-Sale Blues\n\nThis 360 Spider sat unwanted and unloved at a dealership until Richard Maury spotted it.\n\nThe Multi-Talented Mr. Hobbs\n\nDuring a 30-year career, David Hobbs drove everything from sports cars and NASCARs to prototypes to IndyCars and F1 cars—with more than a few Ferr...\n\nUnbridled Passion\n\nSince Phil and Martha Bachman bought their first Ferrari in the early 1980s, they’ve travelled the world with their FXX, become longtime concours j...\n\nIn the Camp of the Enemy\n\nEvents at home in Argentina led Juan Manuel Fangio to drive for Ferrari—the team he’d been competing against for eight years.\n\nThe Milanese Connection\n\nFew episodes in Ferrari’s history are as unusual as its creation of a small four-cylinder car that was put into production by a wealthy Milan enthu...\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Scuderia Ferrari\n\nFrom its founding in 1929 until its liquidation in 1937, Enzo Ferrari’s Alfa Romeo racing stable scored an astonishing 144 wins in 225 races.\n\nThe Wilderness Years\n\nAfter being fired by Alfa Romeo then having his new company nationalized for the war effort, Enzo Ferrari turned to manufacturing mechanical compon...\n\nTrue Grit\n\nThis 208 GT4 took on the grueling, 8,700-mile Peking to Paris Motor Challenge."
