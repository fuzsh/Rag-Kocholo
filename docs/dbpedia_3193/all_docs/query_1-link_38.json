In 1947, he founded Auto Avio Costruzioni, which eventually became Ferrari S.p.A. The first road car bearing the Ferrari name, the 125 S, was introduced in 1947, but it was in racing that Ferrari initially made its mark. Notably, Ferrari competed in Formula 1 from its inaugural season in 1950 and became a dominant force in motorsport.\n\nGolden Era of Racing (1960s-1970s): The 1960s and 1970s were pivotal for Ferrari's racing legacy. Legendary drivers like Juan Manuel Fangio, Phil Hill, and Niki Lauda brought numerous Formula 1 World Championships to the Scuderia Ferrari team. Iconic models such as the 250 GTO and the Daytona were born during this era, solidifying Ferrari's status as a luxury sports car manufacturer.\n\nExotic Supercars and Technological Advancements (1980s-1990s): Ferrari expanded its road car lineup, introducing exotic models like the Testarossa and the F40. Technological advancements like the introduction of the first-ever mid-engined, 12-cylinder car, the Berlinetta Boxer, showcased Ferrari's engineering prowess. These decades also saw the company's partnership with Fiat Group, which infused fresh capital into Ferrari.\n\nTurn of the Millennium (2000s-2010s): Ferrari continued to innovate, introducing iconic models like the Enzo and the LaFerrari, which incorporated cutting-edge hybrid technology. The company's association with Formula 1 remained strong, and Michael Schumacher's dominance brought multiple championships.\n\nDiversification and Luxury (2010s-Present): In recent years, Ferrari has focused on diversifying its product line while maintaining its exclusivity. The company's initial public offering (IPO) in 2015 marked a significant milestone. The introduction of models like the GTC4Lusso and the Portofino expanded its appeal to a broader market, while limited-production models like the Monza SP1 and SP2 paid homage to Ferrari's racing heritage.\n\nSustainability and Electric Future (Future Prospects): Looking ahead, Ferrari is adapting to the changing automotive landscape. The company has announced plans to produce its first all-electric vehicle and is investing in sustainable technologies while ensuring that its performance and luxury standards remain uncompromised."
