May 11, 1947 – The first Ferrari is introduced

Brian Corey

Enzo Ferrari, a former racing driver and team manager, founded his car company, Ferrari, in 1947 with the goal of building race cars that could compete at the highest levels of motorsport. The company quickly established a reputation for excellence following the debut of the first Ferrari 125 Sport (125 S) on this day in 1947 at the Piacenza racing circuit. In the following decades Ferrari became one of the most iconic and revered brands in the automotive world. From its early days of racing to the modern era of Formula One dominance, Ferrari has consistently pushed the boundaries of what is possible in motorsports and road going cars.

Ferrari 125 Sport specs

The Ferrari 125S was the first car to bear the Ferrari name and built under the direction of Enzo Ferrari himself. The car featured a 1.5-liter V12 engine that produced 118 horsepower, giving it a top speed of around 112 miles per hour. The 125S was also the first Ferrari to feature a tubular steel chassis, a design that would become a hallmark of Ferrari’s racing cars for many years. The car made its racing debut at the Piacenza Circuit on May 11, 1947, driven by Enrico Biagini, and while it did not win its debut race, it showed promise for the fledgling Ferrari team.
