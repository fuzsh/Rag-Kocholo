In 1947, Enzo Ferrari founded his modest factory in Maranello.

The mass vehicle market was poised to explode in the early postwar years, but he made a determined decision to go against the trend, pouring his skills instead into his ambition of creating racing cars.

He spared no personnel or financial resources in developing the 125 S, a car that was a manifesto not just for technological progress but also for Ferrari's own racing goals, and established the groundwork for a lengthy saga of triumphs.

Ferrari | the myth of the prancing horse

The renowned prancing horse, taken from the one used by the Italian aviator Francesco Baracca during World War I, is Ferrari's official symbol.

When it comes to the color that has always marked the Maranello automobiles, we can say that there are numerous Ferrari reds: from the original Alfa red to today's standard Corsa red, to the many hues of racing cars.
