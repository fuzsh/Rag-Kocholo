        "text": "Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy’s farce is mildly comical without offending. Time-worn gags clutter up the earlier footage and only when Laurel and Hardy, as new initiates into Oxford, actually move into the dean’s home does the action speed up.\n\nEarly episodes have Laurel as a maid and Oliver Hardy as butler in a rich man’s home. It looks as though it had been tacked on in order to make up footage. James Finlayson is the wealthy host in this episode but not given any cast credit.\n\nA dinner party brings in all the familiar dress-tearing, pastry-flinging, corkpopping and shot-gun gags. Even that venerable nifty where the cop says ‘you are liable to blow my brains out’ and then exhibits the bullet-marked seat of his trousers is left in.\n\nBut once the comedians land in England they fare better. Outside of the lost-in-the-woods stunt and ghost-at-midnight routine, the gagging and all-round material brightens up."
