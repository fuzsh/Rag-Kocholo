        "text": "At the Paris Olympics, Chase Budinger will be compete against the best beach volleyball players in the world — but not necessarily the most famous.\n\nDuring his seven-year NBA career, Budinger said, in the offseason he played beach volleyball against NBA stars such Steve Nash, an eight-time All-Star, and Blake Griffin, a six-time All-Star.\n\nBut the NBA player Budinger credits for his success in beach volleyball did not join the others on the sand courts in Manhattan Beach, California.\n\n“Remember that movie ‘Side Out,’?” Shane Battier said, referring to the low-budget movie about beach volleyball that came out in 1990. “I would've been that chump that was out there that had no business being out in the sand if I was to step out on the court with those guys.’’\n\nBut Budinger said Battier helped shape his preparation skills and deepen his work ethic starting in 2009 with the Houston Rockets, when Budinger was a rookie and Battier was a nine-year veteran.\n\n“He kind of took me under his wing and just showed me the ropes of how a professional should be,\" Budinger said.\n\nIn turn, Budinger said, he brought what he learned to the pro beach volleyball tour. Initially with mixed success.\n\n“Some of these players that I played with were so set in their ways that it was kind of too late for them to change.’’\n\nWhat Shane Battier saw in Chase Budinger\n\nIn June, when Budinger qualified for the Olympics, he got a text message from Battier.\n\n“Chase and I were very close and I thought he was a heck of a basketball player,’’ Battier said. “I'm not surprised at all he is representing our country's at the Olympics because he is that kind of athlete. But more importantly, he has that kind of mind just to be a champion.’’\n\nBattier pointed out that they played for the Rockets when the general manager was Daryl Morey, who leaned heavily on analytics.\n\n“I couldn't jump very high, but one thing I could do is I could out-prepare everybody,’’ Battier said. “And that was one of the things I tried to teach Chase is, look, there's so much you can do that's just beyond making a jump shot or working hard in the weight room or getting extra shots up that can improve your play.\n\n“And looking at every single advantage that's available to you only makes your game better when the popcorn's popping. And Chase really took to that and was really voracious about.’’\n\nJust as Battier imparted his wisdom, Budinger has tried to do the same in beach volleyball. Budinger, who during his seven-year NBA career averaged 7.9 points and 3.0 rebounds, retired from pro basketball in 2017 and in 2018 joined the Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP), the pro beach volleyball circuit.\n\n“Make sure your body is rested and you're getting enough nutrients,’’ Budinger said, \"you're watching and studying film, you're seeing the trainers regularly, you're getting in the weight room, you're doing all these extra things that nobody really notices to be the best professional you can be.’’\n\nSo much for that scouting report\n\nBudinger no longer has to coerce or coax partners to adopt his approach. His current partner, Miles Evans, has embraced it wholeheartedly.\n\nIn fact, during a practice session in June, Evans stayed calm when Budinger dropped F-bombs in an apparent attempt to motivate Evans.\n\n“I think a lot of players who have played with me could say I could be hard on them,\" Budinger said.\n\nBattier sounded amused upon hearing about Budinger’s reputation for his intensity in light of what people said when Budinger declared for the 2009 NBA draft after three years at Arizona.\n\n“It’s funny because the knock on him was that he did not have an intense fire,’’ Battier said. “I think that was a false rep and he proved that wrong ...\n\n\"He has that kind of mind just to be a champion.''\n\nNo, it didn’t happen in the NBA. But Budinger has a shot to make it happen at the Olympics by winning a gold medal.\n\n“That's the only thing Chase wants,’’ Battier said, \"is to go over there, compete hard and bring that hardware home to the USA.’’"
