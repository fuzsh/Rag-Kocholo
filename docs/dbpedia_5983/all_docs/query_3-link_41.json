        "text": "A Wind: When you hold a roll of 16 mm or other single-perf film so that the film leaves the roll from the top and toward the right, the perforations will be along the edge toward the observer.\n\nAbrasion Marks: Scratches on film caused by dirt, improper handling, grit, emulsion pileups, and certain types of film damage (e.g., torn perforations).\n\nAcademy Aperture: In projection, the aperture cutout, designed as specified by the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that provides for a screen-image aspect ratio of approximately 1.37:1; also called \"sound aperture.\"\n\nAcetate: Actually cellulose triacetate, the base material frequently used for motion picture films. Also, in sheet form, for overlay cells.\n\nAcetate-Base Film: Any film with a support that contains cellulose triacetate; safety film.\n\nAcquisition: General term used to describe the input of media for the DI process. All source media during acquisition must be digitized or transferred digitally.\n\nAdditive Color: Color mixture by adding light from any of the three primaries: red, green, and blue.\n\nAlgorithm: A procedure to perform a task. Given an initial state, an algorithm will produce a defined end-state. Computer algorithms are used to perform image-processing operations.\n\nAliasing: A digital artifact consisting of patterns or shapes that have no relation in size and orientation with those found in the original image. This is often caused by too low a scan resolution or sampling rate. The best solution is to acquire the image at a sufficient sampling rate or use an anti-aliasing algorithm.\n\nAnalog: A recording technique (for video or audio) that is continuously variable (as opposed to digital, which is either on or off using 1's and 0's).\n\nAnamorphic: An optical system having different magnifications in the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image. Basically, special camera lenses squeeze the image horizontally at the time of exposure. This 2-to-1 squeeze uses as much of the negative available and still allows room for an optical sound track on the release print. The print is un-squeezed by the projector lens, which gives the characteristic wide screen (2.35:1) aspect ratio.\n\nANSI: American National Standards Institute.\n\nAnswer Print: The first print (combining picture and sound, if a sound picture), in release form, offered by the laboratory to the producer for acceptance. It is usually studied carefully to determine whether changes are required prior to printing the balance of the order.\n\nAntihalation Backing (Coating): A dark layer coated on or in the film to absorb light that would otherwise be reflected back into the emulsion from the base.\n\nAperture: (1) Lens: The orifice, usually an adjustable iris, which limits the amount of light passing through a lens.

It's not recommended.\n\nCINEMASCOPE: Trademark name of a system of anamorphic wide-screen presentation, the first commercially successful anamorphic system for the presentation of wide-screen pictures combined with stereophonic sound. The 35 mm negative camera image is compressed horizontally by 50 percent using a special anamorphic camera lens. Upon projection, the 35 mm print image is expanded horizontally by the same amount using a similar anamorphic projection lens. Depending on the type of sound used in the print, the screen image has an aspect ratio of 2:35:1 (optical sound), or 2:55:1 (4-track magnetic sound).\n\nCircle of Confusion (CoC): The Circle of Confusion characterizes the degree of acceptable focus. The smaller the circle of confusion is, the higher the resulting image sharpness and narrower the depth of field. Traditionally, CoC's of 0.001\" for 35mm formats and 0.0005\" for 16mm formats are used. With modern, higher contrast, sharper lenses and finer film grains, smaller CoC's may be desired since a smaller resulting spot on the film is reproducible.\n\nColor Analyzer: A device for determining the correct printing light ratios for printing color negatives.\n\nColor Balance: The perceptual appearance of a color image of film as a function of the ratio of exposures of each of the primary color records on the film.\n\nColor Channel: An RGB image is comprised of three different color channels: red, green, and blue.

One blade masks the pulldown while the other blade causes an additional light interruption increasing the flicker frequency to 48 cycles per second-a level that is not objectionable to the viewer at the recommended screen brightness of 16 footlamberts (55 candelas per square meter). In a camera, a rotating disk with a section removed.\n\nSilver Halides: Light-sensitive compound used in film emulsions.\n\nSingle-Perforation Film: Film with perforations along one edge only.\n\nSlow Motion: The process of photographing a subject at a faster frame rate than used in projection to expand the time element.\n\nSMPTE: Acronym for the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.\n\nSoft: (1) As applied to a photographic emulsion or developer, having a low contrast. (2) As applied to the lighting of a set, diffuse, giving a flat scene in which the brightness difference between highlights and shadows is small.\n\nSound Negative: The negative record of photographic sound recording.\n\nSound Positive: A positive print of the photographic sound recording film.\n\nSourcey: The tendency for a light source to be perceived as being artificial. This artificiality is a function of the light appearing too bright or too extreme on the subject and then dropping off in intensity very quickly.\n\nSpecial-Dye-Density Curve: A graph 1) of the total density of the three dye layers measured as a function of wavelengths, and 2) of the visual neutral densities of the combined layers similarly measured.\n\nSpectral Sensitivity: The relative sensitivity of a particular emulsion to specific bands of the spectrum within the films sensitivity range. Sometimes confused with Color Sensitivity.\n\nSpectrum: Range of radiant energy within which the visible spectrum-with wavelengths from 400 to 700 mm-exists.\n\nSpeed: Can be characterized in terms of absolute film sensitivity or in terms of reproduced image blacks. Absolute sensitivity is simply a measure of what level of light (exposure) begins to produce the first density signal in the film - this is known as toe speed. The toe speed of a film can also be interpreted by a cinematographer as underexposure latitude or shadow detail.\n\nThe blackness of a positive image D-max can also be used to define speed. Most cinematographers would describe a film with smokier blacks as slower than a film with blacker blacks given both were exposed similarly. Black level also relates to a cinematographer's perception of shadow detail.\n\nSpeed Point: A point that corresponds to the exposure required to produce a specific optical density, usually 0.1 above base + fog.\n\nSplice: Any type of cement or mechanical fastening by which two separate lengths of film are united end to end so they function as a single piece of film when passing through a camera, film processing machine, or projector.\n\nSpot meter: A light meter designed to measure light reflected from the subject.\n\nSprocket: A toothed wheel used to transport perforated motion picture film.\n\nStatic Electricity: Electric field that is present primarily due to the presence of electrical charges on materials.\n\nStep: An exposure increase or decrease, usually by a factor of 2.

A patch of a step tablet used for sensitometer exposures, as in \"21 -step tablet.\"\n\nStep-Contact Printer: Contact printer in which the film being copied and the raw stock are advanced intermittently by frame. Exposure occurs only when both are stationary.\n\nStock: General term for motion picture film, particularly before exposure.\n\nStop Down: To decrease the diameter of the light-admitting orifice of a lens by adjustment of an iris diaphragm.\n\nStop Motion: An animation method whereby apparent motion of objects is obtained on the film by exposing single frames and moving the object to simulate continuous motion.\n\nStorage Area Network (SAN): A high-speed network that connects computer storage devices, such as hard drives and tape libraries, to servers. A SAN allows multiple computers to access a centralized pool of storage. Files can be shared, copied, or moved quickly and efficiently on a SAN.\n\nStraight-Line Region: Portion of characteristic curve where slope does not change because the rate of density for a given log exposure change is constant or linear.\n\nSubbing Layer: Adhesive layer that binds film emulsion to the base.\n\nSubtractive Color: Cyan, magenta and yellow, the subtractive primaries used by film to reproduce color.\n\nSubtractive Lighting: This technique is typically used when shooting exteriors in available light. By using large flags, butterflies, or overheads, light is removed from the subject in order to increase the lighting ratio. It is sometimes referred to as \"Negative Fill.\"\n\nSubtractive Process: Photographic process that uses one or more subtractive primary colors, e.g. cyan, magenta, and yellow, to control red, green, and blue light.\n\nSunlight: Light reaching the observer directly from the sun. To be distinguished from daylight and skylight, which include indirect light from clouds and refract the atmosphere.\n\nSuper 16: This format offers a much greater picture area than that of standard 16mm and provides a wider 1.66:1 aspect as compared to the 1.33:1 television aspect ratio.\n\nSuper 8 mm: Formerly an amateur format, now a popular choice for special effects and teaching.\n\nSuper 35: 35 mm camera format that utilizes entire frame area on film.\n\nSupercoat: Protective coating on film.\n\nSUPER PANAVISION: Similar to Panavision 35, but photographed flat in 65 mm. The 70 mm prints produce and aspect ratio of 2.25:1 with 4-channel sound and a ratio of 2:1 with 6-channel sound.\n\nSweetening: Audio post-production, at which time minor audio problems are corrected. Music, narration and sound effects are mixed with original sound elements.\n\nSwell: The increase in motion picture film dimensions caused by the absorption of moisture during storage and use under high humidity conditions. Extreme humidity conditions and subsequent swelling of the film aggravates the abrasion susceptibility of the film surfaces.\n\nSynchronization: A picture record and a sound record are said to be 'in sync' when they are placed relative to each other on a release print so that when they are projected, the action will coincide precisely with the accompanying sound.\n\nSynchronize: Align sound and image precisely for editing, projection, and printing.\n\nSynchronizer: A mechanism employing a common rotary shaft that has sprockets which, by engaging perforations in the film, pass corresponding lengths of picture and sound film simultaneously, thus effectively keeping the two (or more) films in synchronism during the editing process.\n\nT-GRAIN Emulsion: Emulsion made up of tablet-like crystals rather than conventional silver halides crystals; produces high-speed films with fine grain. Proprietary technology developed by Eastman Kodak Company, also a trademark.\n\nT-Stop: Like F-number, measures the diameter of the lens opening. T-stop factors in the loss of light through the glass lens elements.\n\nTail Ends, Tails: The end of a film. The film must be rewound before projection if it is tails out.\n\nTake-up Reel: The reel, which the already projected film winds up on.\n\nTECHNISCOPE: A system designed to produce 35 mm anamorphic prints from a 35 mm negative having images approximately one half the height of regular negative images and produced by using a special one half frame (2 perforation) pulldown camera. During printing, the negative image was blown up to normal height and squeezed to normal print image width to produce a regular anamorphic print that provided a projected aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The system was designed primarily to conserve negative raw stock.\n\nTelecine: A device for transferring motion picture film to an electronic state.\n\nThin: As applied to a photographic image, having low density. As applied to the physical properties of film, thin base film materials provide for more film per given roll diameter.\n\nTiming: A laboratory process that involves balancing the color of a film to achieve consistent color and density from scene to scene. Also, includes adjusting exposure settings in duplication.\n\nTimecode: A frame numbering system adopted by SMPTE that assigns a number to each frame of video which indicates hours, minutes, seconds and frames (e.g., 01:42:13:26).\n\nToe: Bottom portion of the characteristic curve, where slope increases gradually with constant changes in exposure.\n\nTonality: Smooth transition from one tone to another (light to dark).\n\nTone-scale neutrality and linearity: The ability of a film to reproduce truly neutral gray tones from black to white (this is a function of how the contrast ratio from red to green to blue in the negative aligns with the ratios in the print). Closely correlated is the linearity of the film's characteristic curve in all three-color records from shadows to highlights. Poor linearity can lead to poor neutrality in smaller ranges of the tone-scale. Performance here can also be related to flesh-to-neutral reproduction and film latitude.\n\nTrailer: A length of film usually found on the end of each release print reel identifying subject, part, or reel number and containing several feet of projection leader. Also a short roll of film containing coming attractions or other messages of interest.\n\nTransmittance: Amount of incident light transmitted by a medium; commonly expressed as percent transmittance.\n\nTravelling Matte: A process shot in which foreground action is superimposed on a separately photographed background by optical printing.\n\nTrims: Manual printer controls used for overall color correction.
