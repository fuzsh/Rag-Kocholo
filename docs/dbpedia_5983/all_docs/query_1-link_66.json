        "text": "Several months ago, I met this amazing woman. We fell in love quickly, and everything seemed perfect, but it turned out she’d been speaking with her ex-husband about reuniting all along. He subsequently moved back in. Days afterward, she called me, promising their relationship was “really over.” I forgave her and started seeing her again. Of course, he never really left. I now know that she manipulated me every step of the way, but I still care for her, and want her to get the emotional help she clearly needs. How can I reconcile my feelings about what she did to me, and help her become the person I once thought she was?\n\n— Fool For Love\n\nIf you were a duck, you’d fly around during hunting season in a little gold lamé vest, towing a banner that reads “PICTURE ME NAKED ON YOUR PLATE ON A BED OF WHIPPED POTATOES!” As a man, you can simply go to a bar and be yourself — loud, clear, and needy — and women will picture you lying on the floor in a three-piece linoleum suit, shouting, “Walk all over me!”\n\nDon’t try to argue that mistakes happen. Sure they do — especially to people who cover their eyes, plug their ears, and sing really loudly to obscure any facts not in alignment with their desired reality. It’s guys like you who get hacked up in slasher movies — immediately after insisting, “I’m not letting some report of a meat-cleaver-wielding maniac on the loose stop me from exercising my right to explore this dark cellar for no reason whatsoever!”\n\nAnything for love, huh? Or rather, “love.” Sorry, but love, when it’s real, is not blind or otherwise impaired, but the product of very good eyesight. It takes time to see who somebody really is — assuming you have the inclination to discover it. So, while you might have broken some speed records for falling in something (or, more accurately, stepping in something), it definitely wasn’t love.\n\nForget “reconciling” your feelings about what she did to you, or helping her become the person she never was, and has no interest in becoming now.\n\nApparently, it’s a full-time job for you, avoiding the real problem: You aren’t simply looking for love; you’re desperate for love — which is the surest way to land in the arms of somebody incapable of providing it. This won’t change until you get comfortable being alone — comfortable enough to refrain from selling yourself down the river to the first con girl who needs a bit of man-bait to green up her ex.\n\nAll smell breaking loose\n\nIn your response to “Grossed Out,” the girl who complained that her boyfriend was only showering every other day, I think you missed a trick. Instead of telling the guy there’s a problem, why doesn’t she invite him to take a shower with her? It’s the sexy way to get him clean, don’t you think, and without wounding him in the ego?\n\n—A Man Of The (Wash) Cloth\n\nWhen somebody asks you to talk dirty to them, they probably aren’t looking to hear how you haven’t washed behind your ears. Likewise, the last man any woman wants to bathe with is one who’s seriously in need of a bath. The impulse, if any, is to take him out and hose him down, then burn his clothes. While a man should be clean if he’s looking for an invitation to get dirty in the shower, the need to turn rudimentary personal hygiene into a sex act does have its merits; namely, as a highly effective way to prevent pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and girlfriends."
