        "text": "LONG TAKE: A shot of unusually long duration. In 1984, the average length of a shot was 8.4 seconds; a long take is a shot of significantly longer duration than the average. see, for example, the opening scene of Orson Welles' Touch of Evil or of Robert Altman's The Player.\n\nLOW-ANGLE SHOT: see SHOT\n\nMATCH CUT: see PLASTIC CUT.\n\nMATTE: A mask which obstructs some of the light passing through the camera lens. It can be of a specific shape (e.g., a keyhole), which is then imposed on the film as a blank area while the photographic images are being exposed. Mattes are now most often produced with laboratory techniques rather than with a camera-mounted mask.\n\nMEDIUM SHOT: see SHOT.\n\nMISE-EN-SCENE: The arrangement of all of the elements placed in front of the camera to be photographed. Mise-en-scene refers to the settings and props, costumes and make up, the arrangements of actors in relation to the setting, lighting, etc. Writers often speak of two key approaches to filmmakers' styles: mise-en-scene to describe what goes on within the frame and editing to describe the order and length of shots.\n\nMONTAGE: The French word for editing. In the Soviet Union daring the 1920s and 1930s, montage meant INTELLECTUAL MONTAGE. 2) In Europe, the term is equivalent to editing. 3) In Hollywood, the phrase \"montage sequence~ is used specifically to describe a sequence using rapid cuts, often SUPERIMPOSITIONS and DISSOLVES, to create a kind of kaleidoscopic effect and to telescope or shorten the passage of an extensive period of time.\n\nMULTIMEDIA: An ambiguous term describing the combination of audio, video, and other information with graphics, control, storage, and other features of computer-based Systems. Applications include presentation, editing, interactive learning, and games.\n\nNARRATION: The process by which the plot conveys or withholds story information. The narration can be restricted to one character's POINT OF VIEW or it can be omniscient, encompassing more information than any one character possesses.\n\nNARRATIVE STRUCTURE: The organization of a film's narrative building blocks, as determined by the order of scenes and sequences. For instance, Citizen Kane is structured as a series of flashbacks alternated with the reporter's search in the present. Screenwriters often speak of a three-part structure to story construction: the setup, the complications, and the resolution.\n\nNEW MEDIA: Media technology or a form of media communication that surpasses, enhances, and/or alters an already-existing technology; for example, DVD (digital) technology compared to LASERDISC and VHS (both analog) technologies."
