        "text": "Ordinary and pathetic, just like you ... James McAvoy with Angelina Jolie in Wanted\n\nJust how riddled with self-loathing do you have to be to consume a mindless action blockbuster in 2008? The answer may be found in Some Come Running, the blog of film writer Glenn Kenny, calling attention to the near-identical ways in which the scripts of recent clunkers Jumper and Wanted each take time out from the CGI to verbally insult anyone watching.\n\nIn the case of the sci-fi inflected Jumper, the jibe issues from Hayden Christiansen, who breaks from 'getting \"digits\" from \"this Polish chick\"' to inform the audience: \"I wasn't always like this. Once, I was a normal person. A chump - just like you.\" As Kenny puts it in a phrase I won't attempt to better, the fact the slight is delivered by \"pouty/smirky non-acting dipshit\" Christiansen adds a faintly surreal air to proceedings - one echoed near the finale of the bloodily vapid Wanted when doe-eyed James McAvoy announces: \"Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic - just like you.\"\n\nNow, however pathetic or chump-ish are you, me or anyone else bar Christiansen and McAvoy, what might explain all this obnoxious bad-mouthing? Is it, as Kenny suggests, repressed inner rage seeping out from the screenwriters at making a living creating this bunk? Or simply open contempt for the masochist who buys a ticket for it? Either way, I'll admit to finding something unsettling here that goes beyond the idea the writers are just establishing their principals as Nietzschean demi-gods - a sour hostility to the audience also evident in Michael Haneke's remade Funny Games, albeit with that project's scornful finger-wag here transformed into a moisturized sneer.\n\nThe last film to carry out a similar tweaking of the audience's ego - although one carried out with far more wit and purpose - was Fight Club. But Fight Club is now almost a decade old, and Chuck Palahniuk's source novel an even dustier relic from a time when the rise of IKEA really seemed like something worth losing sleep over. Not that many of us will need reminding, but harder times are with us now - and how much appetite even action geeks will have from now on for being disparaged across the fourth wall by preening boy-actors seems like a moot point to me.\n\nElsewhere, the week brought forth a Where Are They Now which recalled one of those rare instances when mainstream Hollywood produced a true B-movie masterpiece - as Screengrab tracked down Christopher McQuarrie, writer of The Usual Suspects. Easy though it may be to forget it, at the time the film was released back in 1995, McQuarrie's script was an exhilarating box of tricks, directly descended from vintage noir but slyly unto-itself. Yet, while its director Bryan Singer ascended to bigger things, McQuarrie instead stumbled into development hell with a pre-Oliver Stone version of Alexander the Great. Afterwards came a single directors' credit with the under-cooked, little-seen The Way of the Gun in 2000 - and, until now, eight years of AWOL. Now, however, he's resurfaced - although, as the blog notes, the project he's involved with doesn't bode too well for a prolonged comeback..."
