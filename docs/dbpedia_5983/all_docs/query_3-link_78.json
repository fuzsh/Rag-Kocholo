Repertory revivals, restorations, festivals, and Film Forum Jr. are programmed by Bruce Goldstein, Founding Repertory Artistic Director.\n\nPremieres: Staff travels extensively to film festivals around the world to identify the best in new domestic and international cinema. Programming staff request screeners from filmmakers and distributors to preview year-round. We look for films that “break the rules”; tell stories in a new way; deal with controversial or provocative subject matter; treat relevant social, political and historical realities in innovative ways (both formally and intellectually); and give emerging filmmakers the opportunity to reach the general public for the first time.\n\nRepertory Program: Film Forum’s Founding Repertory Artistic Director Bruce Goldstein is committed to the presentation of American and international classics and re-discoveries. He regularly programs rare films culled from the world’s archives and secures new 35mm prints of classics from U.S. distributors as well as international sources. Because of this commitment to quality, Film Forum has been directly or indirectly responsible for upgrading the quality of classic film presentation across the country for the past four decades.\n\nRETURN TO TOP.\n\nQ: How do I submit a new film to be considered for exhibition at Film Forum?\n\nA: Due to the volume of submissions, WE DO NOT ACCEPT UNSOLICITED SUBMISSIONS.\n\nFor consideration, email Mike Maggiore the following information:\n\nsynopsis\n\nfilm festivals / prizes\n\npress coverage\n\ncontact info for filmmaker, distributor or sales agent\n\nThe submission should be no longer than 2 pages in length.\n\nIf we are interested in previewing your film, we will contact you with further instructions. Please no phone calls.\n\nRETURN TO TOP.\n\nQ: Do you rent the theater for screenings?\n\nA: No. As a nonprofit cinema, we program our screens with films that meet our mission and curatorial criteria.\n\nRETURN TO TOP.\n\nQ: What does it mean to be a nonprofit cinema?\n\nA: Film Forum’s mission is to present the best of new and classic films through two distinct, complementary film programs: NYC theatrical premieres of American independents and foreign art films; and repertory selections including foreign and American classics, genre works, festivals and directors’ retrospectives.\n\nAs a nonprofit, our operating income comes from a combination of earned income (ticket sales, concession, merchandise) and funding from private and public sources. Thus, we are not as beholden to “the bottom line” as are commercial theaters, and are able to take significant risks in our programming. In order to keep our films accessible, we offer a multi-level membership program that affords considerable savings on ticket purchases and a host of other benefits.\n\nFilm Forum provides significant marketing and publicity support for all of our films and programs. We produce calendars and press releases for every movie we premiere and for our repertory re-releases and festivals. We work directly with distributors, filmmakers and their subjects to promote their films—via multiple social media platforms, outreach to numerous numerous organizations to reach new audiences, and paid advertising in The New York Times. We commit significant resources towards these efforts, money that small distributors might not be able to afford on their own.\n\nRETURN TO TOP.\n\nQ: Is Film Forum accessible to people with disabilities?\n\nA: Yes, our entire facility is accessible. All 4 theaters, our restrooms, and our lobby are wheelchair accessible, located on the ground-level with no stairs.\n\nFor the hearing-impaired, we have assistive listening devices (available upon request) for all 4 theaters. We also have personalized armrest-fitted closed captioning devices available for specific titles (marked with ).\n\nFilms that are delivered with open captioning will have select showtimes scheduled with this feature. Open captions are the written, on-screen display of a movie’s dialogue and description of sounds (for example, the sound of a door slamming, music). The films with this capability will be marked with , and the film page will list which screenings will be open captioned.\n\nFor the visually impaired, select titles are offered with audio description (marked with ).\n\nAll foreign-language films are English subtitled.\n\nPlease see manager or an usher if you require assistance.\n\nRETURN TO TOP.\n\nTICKETING:\n\nQ: How can I buy tickets?\n\nA: Tickets can be purchased: online 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, or at the box office every day starting at 12:00pm Monday through Friday, and at 10:30am Sundays during our Film Forum Jr. programming.
