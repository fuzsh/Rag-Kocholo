After a job as butler and maid (Stan in drag) goes disastrously wrong they end up sweeping the streets, but when they inadvertently capture a bank robber the bank rewards them by sending them to Oxford for an education.\n\nThe local students play tricks on them but then Stan becomes Lord Paddington and gets his revenge.
