        "text": "If you’re looking for expert help and “just the facts,” give Campbell a call.\n\nPart of feeling comfortable in your own home is knowing that you have a certain level of privacy from the outside world.\n\nBut, what about when you still want to be able to see the outside world? We’re happy to tell you that there is a solution to this problem: one-way window film.\n\nKeep reading to find out how you can use this type of window film to increase your at-home privacy—without feeling like a complete shut-in.\n\nWhat Is One Way Window Film?\n\nOne way window film is a type of mirrored privacy window film that offers a high level of daytime privacy. The reflective finish of one way privacy window film gives the glass a one way mirror effect when there is more light on one side than the other.\n\nThis means that, during the day, people on the outside of the window can’t see in through the glass, while you can still see clearly through it from the inside.\n\nYou can apply one way window film to any windows into rooms that you want more daytime privacy in.\n\nFor example, applying reflective privacy film to ground floor windows, patio doors, and bathroom windows allows you to open up curtains and blinds during the day with the comfort of knowing that people outside still can’t see into your home.\n\nOne way privacy film also lets some natural light in, though how much light it lets in depends on the darkness of the tint.\n\nHow Does One Way Mirror Window Film Work?\n\nOne way window privacy film is manufactured by sandwiching an ultra-thin layer of reflective metal between an adhesive bottom layer and a protective top layer.\n\nThe one way mirror effect created by these types of privacy films occurs when sunlight reflects off of the windows they are applied to. The darker and more reflective the films are, and the more outside light there is, the stronger the one way mirror effect is.\n\nKeep in mind that this means these types of films do not provide nighttime privacy when it is darker outside than inside. The one way mirror effect essentially gets reversed when the light outside disappears and lights get turned on inside.\n\nThe effectiveness is also limited when these types of films are applied to windows that face north or are shaded because of buildings, trees, or other obstacles. One way glass film must receive direct exterior light in order to function effectively.\n\nWhat About Nighttime Privacy?\n\nSince one way mirror window film only provides daytime privacy, you will have to employ additional or alternative solutions to achieve night time privacy as well.\n\nIf you want to utilize one way vision window film for daytime privacy, the easiest way to keep people from seeing into your home at night is to close curtains and blinds. Since your views and outward visibility at night are limited at best, you aren’t really sacrificing anything by covering up your windows after the sun goes down.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want a window film that provides 24-hour privacy, you can install something like a translucent one way frosted glass film. This will allow light to pass through but won’t allow a detailed view through the glass.\n\nIf you require the highest level round-the-clock privacy, you can consider totally opaque window film, which blocks out all light and visibility.\n\nHow Is Privacy Window Film Installed?\n\nThe vast majority of the time, privacy window films are installed on the interior face of the glass.\n\nThis internal application ensures the longest possible lifespan for the window film. Though it can be applied to the exterior face of a window, exposure to the elements shortens the length of time that they function at peak performance.\n\nWindow films are applied using a liquid solution that allows them to be maneuvered precisely into place, then the liquid is squeezed out using a squeegee and the film adheres securely to the glass.\n\nAdditional Benefits of One Way Window Privacy Film\n\nBesides providing a high level of daytime privacy, one way film for windows offers several other benefits for you and your home:\n\nThe high level of reflectivity possessed by these types of films makes them great for heat reduction and UV blocking. One way vision window film blocks out 99% of the sun’s harmful UV rays that cause sunburns on our skin and fading on things like furniture and upholstery placed near windows.\n\nAdditionally, these types of privacy films are very effective at blocking out glare. This makes them an ideal treatment for windows in home offices or entertainment rooms where you want to be able to read, work on a computer, or focus on a television screen without the need to squint your eyes or close drapes and blinds. You can keep your daytime views and even let some natural light in without straining your eyes.\n\nImportant Things to Keep in Mind About One Way Films\n\nWhen you’re deciding whether or not to install one way view window film, there are a few key takeaways you should remember:\n\nFirst and foremost, remember that one way tint never works at night, and in fact, the effect works in the opposite direction when it is dark outside. There is currently no way to achieve 24-hour privacy with this glass film.\n\nThe next most important thing to remember is that no matter how dark the tint, it will have an effect on the appearance of your glass and how much natural light it lets in. That being said, if you choose a very light tint, the effect will barely be noticeable. However, if you want the highest level of daytime privacy and choose a very dark, highly reflective film, it can significantly darken your glass and inhibit higher amounts of natural light from passing through your windows.\n\nAt Campbell Corporation, we are experts in the installation of one way film for windows and all other types of privacy window films.
