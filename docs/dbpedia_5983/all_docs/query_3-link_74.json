After you start watching it, you can play it as many times as you want within 48 hours. During the rental period, you can download the rented movie on one device at any given time and also stream it on another. For example, you can start watching a movie downloaded on your iPhone, then finish watching it later on your Apple TV. Once your time is up, the movie is no longer available."
