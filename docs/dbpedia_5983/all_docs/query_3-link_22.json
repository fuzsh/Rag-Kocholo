        "text": "The JBFC is a dynamic nonprofit cultural and education organization based in Pleasantville, NY. It’s one of the most successful suburban art house film theaters in the country, with five screens and state-of-the-art technology screening independent film, foreign film, and documentaries. Our original three ground floor theaters were renovated in 2023 and a wine bar and cafe, open Thursday through Saturday, will open in late 2023. Visit our film page to see what’s playing!\n\nWe also offer pioneering 21st-century education programs, professional development for teachers and classes for all ages. Over 70% of students who take advantage of our programs each year are from underserved schools and community organizations who participate absolutely free of charge. It’s a resource for local and international mediamakers. It all started when Pleasantville resident Steve Apkon had a vision of a cultural arts and education center inspired by the power of film. This led to the 1998 purchase of what the New York Times called “The Show Place of Westchester County,” the 1925 Rome Theater, one of the first movie theaters in the area. The doors opened in June 2001 as the Jacob Burns Film Center, and the rest is history.\n\nPurchase tickets online or at the box office, open 7 days a week, beginning 45 minutes before the first screening of the day. Please check our film page and calendar for showtime hours. Members pay no online ticket fees while nonmembers pay $1.75 plus per ticket, depending on ticket price and higher fees for higher ticket prices.

One nearby metered lot available throughout the day (check signs for time limits, currently 3 hours) is on Manville Road behind Dunkin’ Donuts across from the Theater. Another lot is in the commuter lot at the train station with spaces for non permit holders available. There are mobile parking apps and kiosks at various lots. Some lots are commuter-permit only until 3:00 pm and are available after 3:00 pm for free during the week and all day on weekends. Metered street parking is available throughout the village (meters do not require payment after 6 pm Monday-Saturday or all day Sunday). View the Pleasantville parking map for full details, click here.. Please note all signs and meters for time limits when parking.\n\nAll theaters are equipped with a hearing loop system, which works with an individual’s own T-coil enabled hearing aid or cochlear implant to enhance audio during films and post-screening discussions. Moviegoers who do not use hearing instruments can also enjoy better sound with a loop receiver. This device is also equipped to function during both screenings and post-screening Q&As.\n\nClosed Captioning Glasses receive captions via infrared energy and project both film captions and descriptive text (if available) directly onto the lenses, allowing patrons to simultaneously watch the film and follow along with the dialogue. Closed captions are provided by the film studio, and are subject to availability. Not all film titles will have closed captions available.\n\nOur headphone receivers provide both HI (Hearing Impaired) and VI-N (Visually Impaired Narrative, otherwise known as “audio description”) audio. Two volume controls allow the user to mix HI and VI-N audio as needed. This device is equipped to function during both screenings and post-screening Q&As. Headphone receivers can be used in conjunction with the Closed Captioning Glasses, in the event that a film title has descriptive audio available, but not in conjunction with descriptive text.\n\nWe offer Open Captioned film screenings as the first show of the day on Wednesdays and Sundays, when captions are available. Look for the “OC” marked next to films to find Open Captioned Screenings on our film calendar. Learn more about accessibility at the JBFC.
