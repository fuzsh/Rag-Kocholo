        "text": "This article is about the different types of acting roles, such as Background, Series Regular, etc.\n\n​\n\nNote 1: If you're looking to learn about Type and see an acting character Types list, check out this guide instead: Type Casting in Acting: All You Need to Know.\n\nNote 2: ​If you're looking to learn about different acting techniques, visit this page: Types of Acting Techniques: The Ultimate Guide\n\nTypes of Acting Roles\n\nDepending on where you live and what type of acting work you do, the different roles can vary. For instance, film has different roles than TV, which has different roles than theater.\n\nThat being said, this guide should give you a baseline understanding of the different types of actors and roles in each, plus tips on how to find auditions for those kinds of roles!\n\nTypes of Acting Roles in Television\n\nIn general, television is the only medium that has very specific designations for the crediting system of actors. Film and theater are much looser in their categories.\n\n​Let's slowly work our way up from the smallest to the largest credited acting role definition in television:\n\nBackground Actor: Background actors are also called extras or atmosphere actors. These actors typically appear in the background or foreground of the scene, often out of focus. Background actors do not have lines and are there simply to provide ambience so a scene feels real and alive. Imagine if they filmed scenes without background actors – every restaurant, street, etc., would be empty! Someone needs to be in the background, and productions need to use people who sign a contract allowing their faces to be seen on camera, which is why they employ background actors.\n\nWhere can you find background actor roles? There are plenty of background role opportunities on different casting websites. Free Resource: The Top 6 Legitimate Casting Websites for New Actors\n\nWill being a background actor help my career? No (aside from the money you'll be paid and the experience you'll gain). Do NOT include background or extra roles on your resume, as they mean nothing to casting directors.\n\nRelated: How to Become an Actor With No Experience\n\nCo-Star: Co-star actors are also called day players. They are actors who typically have just a few lines and usually appear in only one or two is being questioned by a detective, or a customer placing an order at a restaurant, etc. Most screen actors begin their professional career by booking their first co-star role.\n\nWhere can you find co-star roles? There are numerous co-star role opportunities on Actor's Access. You can also find these roles by getting an agent or networking directly with casting directors through classes and workshops. Websites like Casting About and Up to Date Actor can increase your chances of getting co-star roles without an agent by giving you the contact information of the casting directors you should be networking with.\n\nGuest Star: Guest star roles are significantly larger than co-star roles. Guest stars are characters who are integral to the storyline of the episode. They are typically seen in numerous scenes and have plenty of lines.\n\nWhere can you find guest star roles? Most guest star roles can only be accessed through agents or by directly networking with casting directors. Most casting directors will only hire an actor who has at least two co-star role credits on their resume, unless they have a very unique Special Skill that is difficult to find elsewhere.\n\nFree Step-by-Step Guide: 3 Strategies to Get Casting Directors to Invite You to Guest Star Auditions (includes word-for-word email templates and a tutorial on how to become friends with any casting director – even if you've never met)\n\nRecurring: Recurring roles are characters who appear in more than one episode. Depending on the contract, a recurring role can span anywhere from two episodes all the way up to multiple seasons. Landing a recurring role is one of the major dreams/goals of screen actors who want to build a network television career.\n\nWhere can you find recurring roles? Most recurring roles can be found through agents or by networking with casting directors. You can also find recurring roles by auditioning a lot during Pilot Season when new shows are pitching to networks. Most casting directors only hire actors who have at least two guest star roles for a recurring role.\n\nSeries Regular: Considered the \"gold standard\" of television roles, most actors dream of one day being hired as a series regular on a major network television show. The series regular is in almost every episode of every season of the show – they are considered to be one of the main characters.\n\nWhere can you find series regular roles? These can almost only be found during the initial pilot episode of a new show. You'll need to make the most of Pilot Season and you should also already know the director or producer of the show.\n\nIn general, getting an agent is the fastest and easiest way to start getting speaking roles in professional television shows. Here's my Ultimate Guide to Getting an Acting Agent.\n\nTypes of Acting Roles in a Movie\n\nFilm's crediting system is significantly less structured than that of television:\n\nExtras & Background: Similar to television, these are people who do not have lines and simply sit, stand or walk in the background (or foreground) to fill in space and liven up the scene. Casting directors will bring in anyone off the street as long as they are reliable and fit the look they're going for.\n\n​Featured Extra: These are people who do not have lines, but need to perform in some special way. Imagine a taxi cab driver who doesn't have a line, but needs to drive the car. Or a person who winds up in a fight with someone but has no lines. Typically featured extras receive special credits and higher pay.\n\nWhere can you find featured extra roles? You can find these roles on the same websites as you'd find regular background acting roles.\n\nWill being a featured extra help my career? Yes, you can include these credits on your resume. Since they require special skills, casting directors take them more seriously than standard background roles.\n\nSupporting: These are all the actors who have lines in a film, whether they appear in multiple scenes or just one. In film, the bigger the name of the actor (and what's written in their contract) is what will determine where their name appears in the credits (opening vs. closing credits, etc.).\n\nWhere can you find supporting roles? It's extremely difficult to find these types of roles without an agent. You can try to do your own networking with casting directors, but it's almost impossible to find out which films are being cast by whom with resources like Casting About or Up to Date Actor. This is because films are not recurring like television shows. For that reason, I strongly suggest getting an agent.\n\nStar or Lead: These are the actors who play the main characters that the story is focused on. They're in most of the scenes and have tons of lines. They are similar to \"series regular\" characters on TV.\n\nWhere can you find star or lead roles? You should network directly with filmmakers and producers to find these kinds of roles. Having an agent and knowing casting directors can help, but being friends directly with the person creating the project will give you a much higher shot at landing the roles since casting directors usually don't have final say on who is hired for these major parts.\n\n​If you're trying to find more auditions, I highly recommend downloading my free guide: The Top 6 Casting Websites for New Actors\n\n​Types of Roles in Theater\n\nHere is a simple breakdown of the three main types of acting roles in theater:\n\nUnderstudy: This is the person who studies everyone's roles and works as a backup actor in case someone becomes sick. Most actors make their Broadway debut by starting as understudies, and one day when a key player can't get on the stage for whatever reason, they get to perform for the first time!\n\nWhere can you find understudy roles? You can find these through online casting websites like Playbill or by reaching out directly to playhouses that are casting for new shows.\n\nChorus: This is anyone who does not have a speaking role (or they only have a background singing role) in a play. There are a lot of gray areas here, however – think of the chorus as the background and featured extra roles in a film.\n\nWhere can you find chorus roles? Similarly to understudy roles, you can find these through online casting websites like Playbill or by reaching out directly to playhouses that are casting for new shows.\n\nCast: This is anyone who has a speaking or primary singing role in the play. Think of the cast as the main or supporting characters in a film.\n\nWhere can you find cast roles? Finding cast roles in theater is more difficult. Rather than trying to reach out directly by using online sites like Playbill, it's better to be more strategic and focus on small theaters first, performing as the cast in them, and slowly moving to higher and higher level theaters that are putting on the same show. Keep showing them your expertise by playing the same character over and over again, and you'll eventually get booked in a major theater playing that role. Learn how Arbender Robinson used this exact technique to build his Broadway career spanning 11 shows.\n\n​If you're trying to find more auditions, I highly recommend downloading my free guide: The Top 6 Casting Websites for New Actors\n\n​Other Types of Acting Roles\n\n​There are also a few other types of acting roles to be aware of:\n\nCameo: Sometimes, an extremely famous person will make an appearance in a show or film for one shot or one scene. They may or may not have a line. This \"cameo\" appearance is fun for the audience and fun for the famous person!\n\nBit: This is a loosely-used term to describe an acting role of just a line or two. It can be used interchangeably in film or television.\n\nStunt Double: This is someone who performs a dangerous stunt in place of a key actor in a film or television show to protect the actor from injury. Many famous actors use stunt doubles and because of the way it's filmed, the audience would never know they used someone else for the shot.\n\nStand-In: This is the person who holds the place of a key actor in a show or film during technical setup (like positioning the lights, microphones, etc.) and for certain rehearsals. Rather than paying a high rate for the main actor to stand there for hours while the crew sets up, the production hires a stand-in to do the job so they can pay a much lower hourly rate.​\n\n​How to Know if You're Ready for a Higher-Level Acting Role\n\nIn general, most actors underestimate themselves and hold themselves back for years, thinking, \"Maybe I'll be ready for that kind of role someday.\"\n\n​The problem with that is it means you're letting yourself off the hook. How? By not forcing yourself to get better as quickly as possible!\n\nI have a whole article on that here: How to Stop Getting in Your Own Way\n\nI recommend you look at your resume right now and ask, \"What's the next level up from what I've done so far?\"\n\nFor instance, if you have 1-2 co-star roles, it means you need to start looking for guest star roles. If you have one guest star role and one co-star role, I recommend you start looking for a recurring role. By simply holding yourself to a higher standard and asking what you need to do to get to that next level, you'll instantly put yourself ahead of most other actors out there and move your career forward more quickly.\n\nThat's the kind of high-level thinking needed to continue growing your career and keep from staying stuck!\n\nWANT A TALENT AGENT TO GROW YOUR CAREER?\n\nKnowing the different types of acting roles is important, but it's just one small part of growing your acting career.\n\nIf you want to act full-time, your first major goal should be to get a legitimate, hardworking talent agent.\n\nI highly recommend checking out this short podcast episode, where I share:\n\nThe exact steps to getting a great, hardworking, and legitimate talent agent.\n\nHow to shortcut the process significantly, especially for new actors.\n\nTips to avoid scammers in the industry (there are a lot of them!)\n\nListen in using the player below, and be sure to hit Subscribe (you can listen in on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and more)."
