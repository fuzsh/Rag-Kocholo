        "text": "The Texas Film Commission maintains a free database of statewide locations that are available for use in films, television shows, commercials, music videos and digital media projects.\n\nWe receive requests from media industry professionals seeking a wide range of locations including: ranches, residences, small towns, courthouses, parks, dancehalls, restaurants, and small businesses just to name a few. If you own or manage a property in Texas that you would like to be considered as a production location, we welcome your submission for inclusion in our locations database.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow To List Your Property\n\nMaximizing Your Location's Potential\n\nWhat To Expect After Listing Your Property\n\nIf Your Property is Selected for Filming\n\nAdditional Questions\n\nHOW TO LIST YOUR PROPERTY\n\nBefore uploading your photos, please read the photo requirements below. For an example of the types of photos to submit, view these sample galleries for houses, businesses and downtowns.\n\nPHOTO REQUIREMENTS & TIPS\n\nEach submission must include a minimum of 5 to 10 different pictures of the location's interior and exterior to be considered for inclusion. However, we encourage many more so you may submit up to 50 photos.\n\nFilmmakers like to see the ‘big picture,’ so think wide-angle and panorama shots. Landscape-oriented shots are better than portrait-oriented shots. We cannot accept close-up shots or those that focus on people, animals or events.\n\nInclude photos of all structures on your property to showcase everything the location has to offer. Include multiple shots of interiors and exteriors and unique features of the property even if they aren’t \"aesthetically pleasing.\" It could be exactly what a production is searching for!\n\nTry to include at least one shot of each interior room. It may be helpful to stand in the corner of a room with the lens adjusted to the widest angle setting, or using the panorama feature on a smartphone.\n\nTake photos during the day for the best lighting. When photographing interiors, turn on lights and open curtains to help brighten up photos. Dark, out-of-focus or outdated photos cannot be accepted.\n\nWe cannot accept small-resolution (thumbnail) photos or \"photos of photos.\" Modern smartphone photo resolution is more than acceptable.\n\nDo not overlay any digital watermark or include filters/effects that distort the picture. If you would like to include a photo credit, please do so in the assigned text box when submitting. Screenshots of Google Maps or similar services may not be used.\n\nIf you have multiple locations to submit, each property/address must be submitted individually.\n\nUse a laptop or desktop-based browser such as Safari, Edge, Firefox, or Chrome updated to the latest version when uploading photos as using a tablet or phone can lead to errors.\n\nWe cannot accept thumb drives, video files, or hard copy photographs/negatives.\n\nOnce submitted, photos can only be edited, changed, or updated by Texas Film Commission staff. Contact us for help.\n\nAfter you have read all the above instructions, please click the button below to digitally submit photos.\n\nUpload Your Photos\n\nMAXIMIZING YOUR LOCATION'S POTENTIAL\n\nThe Texas Film Commission’s internal locations database is powered by TEXScout, which also has a public-facing website called LocationsHub. This allows the general public to view locations in our Texas Locations Gallery at their leisure, far increasing the chances of properties and businesses to be seen by production personnel.\n\nBy default, locations are listed in both databases to maximize the chances of being contacted by a production. If, however, you would like to list your property in only our internal database, please make a note in the 'Usage Restriction' field and we are happy to accommodate. There is no cost associated to property owners at any time.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT AFTER LISTING YOUR PROPERTY\n\nOnce internally reviewed and approved, your photos will be added to our secure locations database. Approved photos are then made available for viewing by media industry professionals seeking Texas locations for their projects.\n\nPlease note that while our office will do everything we can to promote your property to industry professionals, we cannot guarantee that your property will be selected as a production location.\n\nIF YOUR PROPERTY IS SELECTED FOR FILMING\n\nIf a production company is interested in your property, initial contact is generally made by a Location Scout or Location Manager hired by the production company. If you are contacted, it will likely be to schedule a preliminary location scout. A location scout does not obligate either party; it is simply an in-person visit to see if the property might work as a potential location for the project.\n\nIf your property is ultimately selected for filming, keep in mind three important things:\n\nThe production company will make an offer for compensation based on how long they need access to your property and how much they have allocated in their budget to spend.\n\nFrom student films to indie features to studio television series, each project varies in size and scope. There is no industry standard for location fees and pricing. Keep in mind that every project has varying budgets for locations.\n\nIndustry standards and best practices encourage securing a written location agreement document executed between the production company and the property owner, outlining the agreed upon dates, rates and terms of use for any production activity taking place on your property. A location agreement will typically be provided by the production company to be thoroughly reviewed by the property owner.\n\nIndustry standards and best practices also encourage working with projects that have production insurance policies in place. Production Insurance is an industry standard that protects filmmakers, production companies and property owners supplying a location for production purposes.\n\nAll terms and conditions for location use, rates, and so forth are negotiated between the production company and the property owner—not the Texas Film Commission.\n\nADDITIONAL QUESTIONS"
