        "text": "\"I'm insane!\" mutters the prizewinning screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, played by Nicolas Cage. \"I've written myself into my screenplay!\" \"That's kinda weird, huh?\" interjects his fictional twin brother, Donald, also played by Cage. But sweating, stammering Charlie feels this assessment is too mild: \"It's self-indulgent! It's narcissistic! It's solipsistic! It's pathetic! I'm pathetic and I'm fat and pathetic!\"\n\nNot to mention bald and unable to relate to women. This is a bold and dynamic role Kaufman has written for himself: the hero as chump, and chump as hero, hunched miserably over his typewriter. No glitzy AppleMac G4 for this wordsmith. It's an entertaining tale of Hollywood paranoia and the career neurosis of a screenwriter, with Kaufman not floating face down in the pool, but raging and staggering round, whingeing and whimpering, avoiding his agent's calls, beating his head against the wall, obsessed with the challenge of writing a film about flowers and conveying their vast evolutionary narrative.\n\nHe has accepted a lucrative commission to adapt Susan Orlean's book The Orchid Thief, and after struggling for months discovers that the screenplay he actually wants to write is the story of his failure to adapt it. What chutzpah it must have taken for the real Kaufman actually to submit this screenplay to his employers, and what an incredible testament to the clout wielded by Kaufman and director Spike Jonze that this is the movie that got made.\n\nSo Kaufman cheekily writes himself into his script, or rather writes himself writing himself into his script - a paunchy loser who can't get a girlfriend. But he also creates a doppelganger, an alternative self whom he both despises and wants to be. Donald is an easygoing, sexually successful idiot who is also writing a boneheaded by-the-numbers screenplay with the aid of a raft of self-help manuals and Robert McKee's screenwriting course. It turns out to be an appalling serial-killer flick called The 3, in which the psycho is a literary critic called the Deconstructionist who cuts little pieces off his victims.\n\nSo much for the metatext. The central story, which is thoroughly upstaged and made to look very boring by the hilarious Kaufman brothers, is about Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep). She is a New Yorker staffer who writes a classy, well-turned article, and then a classy, well-turned book, about charismatic, gap-toothed orchid-poacher John Laroche, played by the perennially excellent Chris Cooper. Laroche's attractive, passionate approach to life makes Susan ask herself hard questions about her own sterile existence. And the \"adaptation\" of the title is made to earn its keep as a Darwinian metaphor for how flowers adapt - and also how the heart itself adapts.\n\nIt's all beautifully acted, but I didn't care about Susan and John and their tremulous relationship, laden with supercilious, middlebrow significance. They weren't on screen for a single minute without me wondering: \"Yes, yes, but what's happening with Charlie and Donald? Is Charlie going to get back together with Amelia? How about that cute waitress?\" This is the problem with \"levels of reality\". As Clive James wrote, there's always one which is really real, and the story of the two writers is so funny and seductive that Meryl Streep's plotline, like her 19th-century existence in Karel Reisz's The French Lieutenant's Woman, is bound to look distant and inert.\n\nCage gives one of the best performances of his recent career as the Kaufmans. He's a natural in this role, especially when that great horse face breaks into an ingratiating grin, but he's also very good at Charlie's fastidious horror at Donald attempting to use Hollywood insider jargon. He winces when his brother airily refers to \"the industry\" and when Donald blunders into his bedroom and asks if he wants to listen to his \"pitch\", Charlie all but screams: \"Don't say that!\"\n\nCharlie's current discontents get traced back to the genesis of his breakthrough work, Being John Malkovich, and there's a forbidden thrill in seeing fragments of this masterpiece crop up here - particularly Malkovich himself imperiously ordering people about during the restaurant scene - while the fictional Kaufman tries waving to the stars before being brusquely ordered off the set. It's a very tasty postmodern treat, and so is Charlie's final indignity: having to swallow his pride and attend the screenwriting seminar run by Robert McKee (Brian Cox). It is here that Charlie learns that he will have to insert the hackneyed elements that he has affected to despise: the big resolve, the overcoming of difficulties and the learning of life lessons, etc.\n\nWhen so many screenplays fall apart in the final act, there's something piquant in the fact that Adaptation does too. A very strange, frantically melodramatic ending brings Susan Orlean, John Laroche and the Kaufmans together in real time for a big showdown, for which this quirky, brainy comedy has certainly not prepared us adequately. But the ending isn't the problem - the problem is that 50% of the movie doesn't come to life. The whole story of John Laroche and Susan Orlean is placed a double-step away from us, and Orlean's own apparently effortless existence as a writer looks implausibly bland compared to Charlie's uproarious rage and impotence over the blank sheet of paper.\n\nPerhaps Adaptation wantonly mystifies the writer's work, making Charlie Kaufman's task look more wretchedly impossible than it actually is. He did, after all, do a straight job of adapting Chuck Barris's Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. But it's a funny, complex take on the idea of storytelling, the tyranny of three-act narrative and how the movies absorb literary properties. Adaptation is like a funky flip-side to The Hours. Probably more profound, too."
