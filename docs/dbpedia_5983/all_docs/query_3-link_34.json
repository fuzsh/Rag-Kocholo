        "text": "So what is slide film? That leads to a whole conversation about slide film being known as E-6 and color reversal film. But there’s a lot more to slide film than just that fancy name. What’s more, there is a range of different types of color reversal film available, and some are as rare as gold.\n\nSlide or color reversal film is a positive film. Instead of creating a negative to then print as a positive, slide film is already positive. The colors and tones correctly display on the film… but before we take a deep dive into the different types of reversal film, let’s look at the critical difference between C-41 and E-6.\n\nSlide film is commonly referred to as “E-6” because the development process consists of 6 baths which include developer, stop, and fixer. Color negatives are referred to as C-41 and use a chromogenic color print film developing process.\n\nIs slide film still available?\n\nWhile some popular slide films have ceased in production, there are still many available from Kodak and Fujifilm in 35mm, 120, and even larger formats. FujiFilm never stopped producing slide film and currently sells three different types: Velvia 50, Velvia 100, and Provia 100f. With that in mind, we thought it would be a great time to compare some of the great E-6 options available today. Sadly, as you’ll discover below, many of the best slide films are no longer manufactured by the leading brands.\n\nE-6 Film Processing\n\nThese days it can be difficult to find labs that process slide film, let alone labs that process it in-house. Here at The Darkroom, it’s one of our specialties! We have been dip & dunk processing E-6 slide film in-house since 1976.\n\nDevelop your E-6 Slide Film\n\nC-41 – Popular By Demand\n\nOn the flip side is the color negative film, otherwise referred to as C-41 due to the processing technique. A technique that was developed and introduced by Kodak in 1972. A film that relies on C-41 processing is by far the most common film type available today. C-41 or color negative film is, as the name suggests, a negative with tone and color reversed once developed. The printing or scanning process reverses the color and tone to produce the positive image we see in prints and scans.\n\nC-41 tends to be more cost-effective to purchase and develop – plus, the range of film available is considerable. A great benefit of the C-41 process is the ability to push-process a film for longer durations to obtain interesting results. Another interesting approach is to cross-process the E-6 slide film in the C-41 method. While the resolution in C-41 is not even close to E-6, the dynamic range and speed have more significant variance.\n\nFinal Thoughts On Slide Film\n\nWhile there are still plenty of options available for E-6 color reversal films, there’s undeniable mourning for those no longer in production. It’s disappointing to see that Fujifilm, in particular, has called it quits on several unique slide films. There’s a certain magic to seeing a developed E-6 slide and holding it up to the light or admiring it through a handheld slide viewer. It’s like a moment captured in a tiny world and perfectly framed. It’s no wonder that craft and second-hand markets feature stalls with boxes and boxes of pre-loved slides. What’s more, wanderers pack these stalls holding their E-6 slides up to the light. Grab your E-6 film and go out and shoot to see what you think of slide film photography."
